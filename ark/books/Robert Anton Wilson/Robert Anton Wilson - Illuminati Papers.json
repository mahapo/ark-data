Of course, we had electric lights instead of candles, and the“horseless carriage” had come into general use, but otherwise the so-calledadvanced nations remained in a primitive industrial economy and few couldforesee the Information Age dawning.Those Eolithic days seem hard to recall now. Nobody but the military and a fewuniversities had access to Internet or the World Wide Web; if I wanted to doresearch, I had to leave the “typewriter” — a device only a little less archaicthan the quill pen—and drive to a library where I’d spend a day taking noteswith a pen on a pad. No humans lived in space yet; the Mir space station did notbegin construction until 1986, eight years after The Illuminati Papers appeared.Most of what I wrote then seemed as fabulous as Oz or Wonderland to the majorityof readers; now, I fear some readers will find parts of this hackneyed—except inthe Manhattan Literary Establishment, where these ideas are still consideredwild and crazy. (Those New Yorkers still seem to think the latest radicalnotions are those of Freud and Marx. )Even the first long (or longish) chapter in this book, “The Abolition ofStupidity,” dealing with intelligence-raising technologies, seemed like fantasyor satire to most 1970s readers. By comparison, if you hunt around the WorldWide Web today, you will find over 1000 entries, dealing with DHEA, “Blast,”Hydergine and dozens of other brain-boosting substances. Since I can safelyassume most of my readers have Web access by now, let me suggest that you findout how this field has developed by clicking on smart drugs in the Extropian website athttp://www.c2org/~arkuat/extr/ [http://www.c2org/~arkuat/extr/].Back in the ‘70s, most critics did not know what the hell to make out of thesepages and generally classified the whole book as science fiction in disguise.Fortunately, readers as a group do not have the rear-view vision that seemsrequired of posh reviewers, and many of them understood me very well. Every yearnow, and in fact many times a year, I meet people who tell me their choice ofcareer resulted from reading my science faction. (Most of these people went intospace engineering, psychopharmacology, life extension research or quantumphysics.)Looking back, I feel a sense of humble astonishment. I seem to have written a1990s book in the 1970s. Only in the matter of computer networking do I appearto have missed the boat: I knew major changes would come, but I did not knowenough about that field to know how rapidly or how totally the cyber-revolutionwould shake, quake and remake our society. Otherwise, my forecasts of the comingwaves of change in space migration, longevity, and automation seem good enoughto tempt me to set up shop as a fortune teller. But I did not use any “psychic”powers in my future-scans; I used simple common-sense projections of trends thathad become more and more obvious throughout human history.• Space Migration: Whenever new territory becomes habitable, humans move in, soit did not require shamanic talent to foresee a migration into space.• Life Extension: Ever since science escaped from the tyranny of the RomishInquisition, life span has steadily increased, from less than 40 years in the18th Century, to 50 years at the end of the 19th, to 60 years around 1950, to73+ for males and 78+ for females in the advanced nations today. With theresearch on gerontology already underway when I wrote this book, it required nogenius to foresee the Life Extension Revolution, in which millions of people nowuse compounds with a high probability of increasing life span ever further, andthousands of researchers optimistically look forward to breakthroughs that willgive us lives that measure centuries rather than decades.• Intelligence Increase: My crystal ball, however, seems to have been cloudy onthe subject of Intelligence Increase. Despite all the people using the “smartdrugs” mentioned above, the majority, at least in the U.S., has grown steadilystupider. I attribute this to a deliberate policy of “dumbing down” thepopulation, instigated by our ruling Elite after the donnybrooks andkatzenjammerei of the ‘60s taught them that too many educated people representeda real danger to the status quo. Arlen, my wife, often claims that nobodyeducated since 1975 seems to know anything, and Kurt Vonnegut has made the sameobservation. I don’t think the situation has gotten quite that bad really: onlythe majority of Generation X seems to think Einstein invented the telescope orthat the Bill of Rights says the government has the right to screw us any way itwants; a saving minority, even among the under-30, seems as bright as the bestminds of any generation.A few sections of this book discuss our nation’s rapid movement towardtotalitarianism (perhaps too satirically for such a grim subject; some peoplethought I was joking. . .) These passages now seem, strangely, ratherunderstated. In this connection, let me cite a recent article by Claire Wolfe1which rather clearly shows that our present urine testing by the Piss Policeonly represents a small part of the Kafkaization of this once-free Republic.Wolfe lists some of the fascist laws enacted by the 104th Congress:• A law establishing a national database of employed people. After this isimplemented, only the homeless, the hermits and the subterraneans will remainfree of federal snooping.• 100 pages of new laws creating scores of new “health care” crimes fordepartures from A.M.A. dogma. The penalties for such heresy include, but are notlimited to, seizure of assets from both doctors and patients.• Laws allowing confiscation of assets from any escapee who establishes foreigncitizenship. (If you run, like the Jews who got out of Nazi Germany, reconcileyour-self to leaving everything valuable behind.)• The largest gun confiscation act in U.S. history.• Increased funding for the already Gestapo-like Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, andFirearms, the people responsible for perpetrating the Waco holocaust. (By theway, have you checked to find out if your church is BATF approved?)• A law enabling the government to declare any group “terrorist” by fiat,without trial and without appeal. Such groups will then have to turn membershiplists over to the Feds.• Laws allowing secret trials with secret evidence for various classes ofdefendants.• A law requiring States to begin issuing driver’s licenses only with securityfeatures (such as fingerprints, social security numbers etc.) by October 1st,2000. You won’t be able to drive without giving the Feds all the data they needto snoop into all your private affairs; if that much surveillance makes younervous, learn to hoof it.• A law establishing a national database containing everything your doctor andyou say during consultation. If you don’t like the Feds knowing all about yourrecent bout of the clap, or even about your vaginal yeast infection, you mightthink of running for the border right away; see the third item above, aboutforfeiture laws.If you think this is some of kind of joke or satire that Wolfe or I invented,look up the article I’m citing. Wolfe gives the names and numbers of all theselaws. For instance, the last one listed, mandating invasion of the privacy ofthe doctor’s office, appears in sections 262-264 of HR 3103, the innocentlytitled Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Wolfe callsthese statutes “land mines” because they are all hidden in bills with similarlyinnocuous titles.The amusing thing (if you can still feel amused after reading the above) is thatall this legislation was passed by a Republican-dominated Congress, which gotelected on a platform promising to “get the government off our backs.” (Wilson’sFourth Law: Whatever politicians promise before election, they’ll very probablydo the opposite after election.) Even funnier, the Republicans still claim thatso-called “liberal Democrats” represent the major threat to our liberties.By the way, has anybody actually seen, heard, touched, or smelled a truly“liberal” democrat in the last 30 years? Or are there any rumors, yarns, orfolklore about the survival of that seemingly extinct species emanating fromanyone else but the Republicans?Of course, even before the 104th Congress, you already had to give a urinesample whenever the Piss Police came along, and if any narc liked your countryestate, he only had to plant a small amount of cocaine in the pantry to seizethe building (and the grounds) from you without a trial. If the deliberatedumbing down of America hadn’t been so successful, the majority of thepopulation would be in open revolt by now; but a nation of sheep submits to theshears, and to the abattoir, without even bleating in alarm.Indeed, Claire Wolfe, whose summary of recent fascist legislation I haveparaphrased, comments wanly:It is very risky to actively resist unbridled power. . .For that reason, among many others, I would never recommend any particularcourse of action to anyone—and I hope you’ll think twice before taking “advice”from anybody about things that could jeopardize your life or well-being.Wolfe does mention, without endorsing, some of the methods that various bravesouls have employed in the attempt to recapture some of our lost liberties—taxrefusal; civil disobedience; non-cooperation with the authorities; boycotts;secession efforts; monkey-wrenching; computer hacking; dirty tricks; publicshunning of government agents; alternative communities that provide their ownmedical care and utilities.Whenever any of these tactics gets enough publicity or causes enough nuisance,the authorities react the way authorities can be expected to react. Never ForgetWaco. Never.Tax refusal, whatever brilliant legal arguments some libertarians produce tojustify it, usually provokes confiscation of everything you own, and a jail termusually follows. Civil disobedience and non-cooperation can also land you in thecan, or can escalate to Ruby Ridge massacres. Boycotts remain safe, if you canfigure out the tactics carefully and have a lot of associates. Monkey-wrenching,computer hacking and dirty tricks remain popular, but also lead to jail if youget caught. Public shunning is both possible and legal; it happens increasinglyin places like Idaho, Utah, Montana and Nevada. Alternative drop-out communitiesare only safe as long as they remain very low profile.Now maybe you can see why I have so much enthusiasm for civilian spacecolonization.That will still take quite a while. Meanwhile, you might consider migrating tocrypto-space.“Crypto-space” is my name for the part of cyberspace presently invisible togovernment snooping. As T.C. May writes:Strong cryptography, exemplified by RSA (a public key algorithm) and PGP (PrettyGood Privacy) provides encryption that essentially cannot be broken with all thecomputing power in the universe. . .Digital mixes, or anonymous remailers, use crypto to create untraceable e-mail.. .Digital cash, untraceable and anonymous (like real cash) is also coming. . .2J. Orlin Grabbe comments:The government doesn’t want you using cryptography because they want to knowwhere you money is so they can get some of it. And they don’t like you usingdrugs, unless the government is the dealer.3In fact, virtual communities with virtual cash already exist in crypto-space.According to the Encyclopedia of Social Inventions,4 the first non-interestbearing non-taxable virtual money came into existence in Vancouver in 1983. Theidea has not received much publicity, but it spread as far south as San Diego by1990.Unlike Fed notes, virtual money—a form of barter—does not require interest,because virtual cash is created by the people who use it for their ownconvenience. Fed notes, on the other hand, are created precisely to bearinterest, at as high a rate as the market will bear. Your share of the nationaldebt is money you owe to the Fed for using their notes, which you have to useuntil you find the Doorway to Freedom and creep off into crypto-space. Andvirtual cash is tax-free because the IRS can’t find it.Evolution proceeds, it seems to me, by challenges which force organisms to getsmarter. In a fascist state like Bill Clinton’s U.S.A., the smartest will findways out of the cage much more effective than the tactics of Randy Weaver on hismountain or the Republic of Texas, or similar groups still seeking freedomwithin geospace. There is no freedom in geospace. Every square inch has beenmapped and claimed by some nation or corporation or syndicate. The onlyremaining frontier is electronic.The Internet not only opens the door to freedom just when the Feds seem to haveus locked up forever, but it also seems to make “desovereignization,” asBuckminster Fuller called it, inevitable. According to Fuller’s analysis, theGreat Pirates—kings, emperors, mikadoes, prime ministers—who seized control ofTerra at the beginning of the Bronze Age are now sponsored entities, puppets offinance capitalism. When Fuller wrote Grunch of Giants, it required $100,000,000to run a campaign for president; it requires even more now, due to inflation.Guess where the politicians of the world get that kind of money, and then you’llhave a good idea who really runs the world today.Whether the Republicans or Democrats win an election, the Federal Reserve stillmakes the important decisions; whether the Tories or Labour win in England, theBank of England remains in control. As Fuller wrote:Never before in all history have the inequities and the momentums of unthinkingmoney-power been so glaringly evident to so vastly large a number of. ..all-around-the-world humans. . .5For more details of how Fuller expects these informed humans to “desovereignize”the planet, cooperatively “advantaging all without disadvantaging any” throughelectronic speed-of-light synergy with Internet, seehttp://www.teleport.com/~pdx4d/grunch/html[http://www.teleport.com/~pdx4d/grunch/html].As I point out in “Celine’s Laws,” later in this volume, authoritariancommunication is always blocked by SNAFU; nobody tells the whole truth aboutanything to those who have the power to jail and kill. Libertariancommunication, via Internet, allows for quicker feedback, which will also bemore accurate feedback, and Spaceship Earth will begin to move in a sensible wayat last, no longer having 150+ Supreme Commanders all steering in differentdirections.Until that planetary synergy (called the Global Brain by British philosopherPeter Russell) emerges fully, we still have jury nullification, guaranteed dejure since the Magna Carta and de facto unalienable. When you sit on a jury, nopower on earth can force you to find somebody guilty in a case where you believethe law itself is unconstitutional, tyrannous or dangerous to your own civilliberties. Here are a few citations which State Education and the mass media trytheir damnedest to keep you from ever seeing:Every jury in the land is tampered with and falsely instructed by the judge whenit is told that it must accept as the law that which has been given to them, orthat they can decide only the facts of the case.—Lord Denham6The jury has the power to bring in a verdict in the teeth of both the law andthe facts.—Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes7If the jury feels the law is unjust, we recognize the undisputed power of thejury to acquit, even if its verdict is contrary to the law as given by a judge,and contrary to the evidence.—4th Circuit Court of Appeals8When a jury acquits a defendant even though he or she clearly appears to beguilty, the acquittal conveys significant information about community attitudesand provides a guideline for future prosecutorial discretion. . . Because of thehigh acquittal rate in prohibition cases in the 1920s and early 1930s,prohibition laws could not be enforced. The repeal of these laws is traceable tothe refusal of juries to convict those accused of alcohol traffic.—Sheflin and Van Dyke9For more details on how juries can protect our civil liberties even when thegovernment is hell-bent on destroying them, seehttp://nowscape.com/fija/fija_us.html [http://nowscape.com/fija/fija_us.html].The Chinese allegedly have a curse which says, “May you live in interestingtimes.” We undoubtedly live in interesting times, but I don’t find it a curse.As Nietzsche should have said, anything that doesn’t kill me makes me smarter.The evils of the world, which involve massive starvation as well as the erosionof individual liberty I have been discussing, challenge us to use our headsbetter, and the H.E.A.D. Revolution is what this book is all about.Turn the page and you’ll find even more reason to feel braced and excited aboutthe problems we confront and our ability to deal with them. Solving problems isone of the highest and most sensual of all our brain functions.Robert Anton WilsonFreedom, California23 May 1997_________________1 “Land-Mine Legislation,” by Claire Wolfe, 1997 Summer Supplement, LoompanicsUnlimited, Port Towsend WA.2 “Crypto Anarchy and Virtual Communities,” tcmay@netcom.com [tcmay@netcom.com]3 Grabbe, via tcmay above4 Encyclopedia of Social Inventions, Institute of Social Inventions, London,1990.5 Grunch of Giants, by R.

All signals move at, or slower than, the speed of light and must beinside the light cone. Thus, only events in the past light cone can affect A.And, in turn, A can affect only those events in its future light cone. This isthe rule of special relativity. However, there may be quantum events that dohave effects outside the light cone. These effects would have to be nonenergeticeffects: information without transportation, or without signals.images [images/gl_ufig_01.jpg]ERPThe Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky paradox, which holds that if quantum theory is true,nonlocal effects must occur (outside the light cone). This was offered as areductio ad absurdum of quantum theory, since it suggests “telepathy,” asEinstein pointed out.Bell’s theoremJohn S. Bell’s proof (1964) that any objective quantum theory must includenonlocal effects: effects outside the light cone (faster than light). Thus, ifwe reject nonlocality with its suggestion of “telepathy,” we seem driven tononobjectivity, which suggests psychokinesis or the merging of physics andparapsychology into paraphysics.DecodingFinding the meaningful structure (information) within a system. Beethoven’sNinth and the Crick-Watson DNA model are both decodings of the life script ofTerra.Neuro-A prefix denoting “known by or through the human nervous system.” Thus we haveno physics but neurophysics, no psychology but neuropsychology, no linguisticsbut neurolinguistics, and, ultimately, no neurology but neuroneurology, and noneuroneurology but neuroneuroneurology, etc. See Von Neumann’s catastropheimmediately below.Von Neumann’s catastropheMore fully known as Von Neumann’s catastrophe of the infinite regress.

Ontology is the study of being; theguerilla approach is to so mix the elements of each book that the reader mustdecide on each page “How much of this is real and how much is a put-on?” Thisliterary technique seems justified by the accelerated acceleration of newknowledge, new theories, new inventions, and new possibilities in our time,since any “reality” map we can form is probably obsolete by the time it reachesprint."},{"pageContent":"Item [Contents.html#tfm5] JOIN THE HEAD REVOLUTION [Contents.html#tfm5]Want to contact Higher Intelligence?It’s easy, really.The human brain is an “organ of adaptation” (Freud).HEAD means Hedonic Engineering and Development.Using your brain for fun and profit.

Buckminster Fuller and Werner Erhard, haveproposed that we can and should abolish starvation by the end of this century.This goal is rational, practical, and desirable; so it is naturally denounced asUtopian, fantastic, and absurd.I wish to propose a similar goal, which is also rational, practical, anddesirable, and which will also be denounced as Utopian, fantastic, and absurd.I suggest a worldwide War against Stupidity.Although the stupid will naturally resent this, I address my ideas here to thosewho are not totally stupid or who are not stupid all the time, i.e., those rareindividuals who have occasional lucid moments.The arguments for this Revolutionary Notion are as follows:1. Although one sounds like a satirist to say it, this planet does seem to becontrolled by and largely populated by persons who are not in all respectsreasonable men and women. Voltaire, of course, may have been exaggerating whenhe said that the only way to understand the mathematical concept of infinity isto contemplate the extent of human stupidity; but the situation is almost thatbad. To mention just a few examples from my own lifetime: Hitler murdered sixmillion Jews for “reasons” that were totally insane; Senator Joe McCarthy led acrazy witch-hunt against Communists which ruined many innocent people and neversucceeded in uncovering one absolutely definitive real Communist; Anita Bryantis currently waging a crusade right out of the thirteenth century againsthomosexuals; etc.It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that millions of humans have been murderedin the course of such irrational scapegoating throughout history. Since each ofus belongs to some minority or other, any of us might be one of the targets inthe next witch-hunt, and if they burn us there will be nothing left tocryonically preserve.Nor is stupidity the exclusive trait of the stupid; you do not need a “vocation”for it, as you do for the priesthood. It seems to be a contagious socio-semanticdisturbance which afflicts all of us at one time or another. Notorious examplescan be found in the lives of “the Great,” such as Simon Newcombe (the astronomerwho discovered Neptune) “proving” mathematically that heavier-than-air flightwas impossible, the French Academy refusing to examine the evidence formeteorites in the eighteenth century, etc. (Some might include Einstein’scontinuous attempts to refute the random factor in quantum mechanics as anotherexample of stupidity in a fine mind.)More generally, as Thomas Kuhn has shown in The Structure of ScientificRevolutions, an exact measurement of the extent of stupidity among the learnedis provided by the fact that every scientific revolution seems to take ageneration. As Kuhn documents extensively, this one-generation time-lag seems tobe caused by the fact that elderly scientists hardly ever accept a new model,however good it is, and the revolution is only fully accomplished when a secondgeneration, with less prejudice, examines both the new and old modelsobjectively and determines that the new is more useful.But if science, the paradigm of rationality, is infested with enough stupidityto cause this generalized one-generation lag, what can we say of politics,economics, and religion? Time-lags of thousands of years seem to be normal inthose areas.Indeed, it was chiefly by contemplating religious history that Voltaire was ledto conclude that human stupidity approximated to the infinite. The study ofpolitics is hardly more inspiring, and any examination of economic debatestrongly suggests that the theologians of the Dark Ages are still among us,operating in a new department.I do not wish to enlarge upon this topic, since it has already been amplydiscussed by Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain, among others. Let us just summarizethe matter by saying that stupidity has murdered and imprisoned more geniuses,burned more books, slaughtered more populations, and blocked progress moreeffectively than any other force in history. It may be no exaggeration to saythat stupidity has killed more people than all diseases known to medicine andpsychiatry.Various cures have been attempted, of course. Socrates thought he had found thecure in dialectic, Aristotle in logic, Bacon in experimental method, theeighteenth century in universal democracy and literacy, Freud in psychoanalysis,Korzybski in General Semantics, etc. Although all these inventions have beenbeneficial to some of us some of the time, they have not stopped the worldwideravages of the plague, and they have not even abolished totally the occasionallapses into stupidity of their most accomplished practitioners (the presentauthor emphatically included). Stupidity is a contagious sociosemantic disturbance which afflicts all of us.Stupidity murders geniuses, burns books, slaughters populations, blocksprogress.There is nothing rationally desirable that cannot be achieved if rationalityitself increases.Neurochemistry means the human nervous system studying and improving itself:intelligence studying and improving intelligence.Why be depressed, dumb, and agitated when you can be happy, smart, and tranquil? 2. If intelligence could be increased, obviously solutions could be found morequickly to the various Doomsday scenarios presently threatening us.(A) For instance, if each scientist working on the energy-resources problemcould increase his or her intelligence by a factor of two, work that wouldotherwise require ten years could be accomplished in five.(B) If human stupidity in general decreased, there would be less opposition tooriginal thinking and to new approaches to our old problems.(C) If stupidity decreased, less money would be wasted on vast organizedimbecilities, such as the arms race, and more would be available forlife-enhancing projects.The same arguments apply to any other worthwhile goals: abolition of starvationand poverty, finding cures for cancer or schizophrenia, etc. There is nothingrationally desirable that cannot be achieved sooner if rationality itselfincreases. This is virtually a tautology, yet we seldom consider the corollary:Work to achieve higher intelligence is work to achieve all of our other goals.3. Although dialectic, logic, experimental method, “democracy,” literacy,psychoanalysis, General Semantics, etc. have not stopped the world-round ravagesof stupidity, they have created certain counterforces: some enclaves of(comparative) rationality in which humans function with (comparatively) lessstupidity than is normal for this domesticated primate species. “We” as aspecies have learned a few things from each of these inventions.Those who are skilled in dialectic will not be fooled by the empty rhetoric ofthe more vulgar demagogues. Logic protects some of us from the more absurd“intellectual” (or anti-intellectual) fads of the epoch in which we live.Experimental method has shown us how to avoid the pitfalls of purely abstractlogic and connect our theorizing with actuality.Democracy and literacy have made these previous inventions at least potentiallyavailable to huge masses rather than to tiny elites, although it remains truethat you can lead the horses’ asses to wisdom but you can’t make them think.Psychoanalysis has shown us why even the most “rational” can become subject tocompulsively irrational thinking. General Semantics has demonstrated theneurolinguistic reflexes that make it so difficult for humans to abandon an oldmodel and accept a new one, and offers a few gimmicks that are somewhat helpfulin breaking such reflexes.But psychology has advanced quite a bit since Freud, psychoneurology sinceKorzybski, and Behavior Mod since Pavlov. We are on the threshold of a majorbreakthrough in the war against stupidity, just as surely as we are on the edgeof achieving Life Extension and Space Migration. The Intelligence Revolution mayeven prove to be more wide-ranging in its effects than the quantum jumps tospace industry and longevity.4. Dr. Nathan Kline, who could be called a conservative in the area ofneuropharmacology (on a scale in which Dr. Timothy Leary is radical and the U.S.government reactionary), has predicted in his Psychotropic Drugs in the Year2000 that, within 20 years, we will have drugs to improve memory, drugs to eraseunpleasant memories, drugs to increase or decrease any emotion, drugs to prolongor shorten childhood, drugs to foster or terminate mothering behavior, etc. Ittakes no imagination to see that such chemicals will allow us greater controlover our own nervous systems than was ever possible in the past. Obviously,people will use and abuse these drugs in many ways, desirable and otherwise, butthe most intelligent will use them in the most intelligent way, i.e., toincrease their own neurological freedom, to deprogram their irrational programs,and generally to expand their consciousness and increase their intelligence.The potential for neurological revolution implicit in such psychopharmacologicaladvances should be quite clear to anybody who has any acquaintance even with soprimitive a psychedelic as LSD. (One of the least-known facts about LSD is thatthe longest single research project with that chemical in the U.S., at theSpring Grove Hospital in Maryland, showed an average 10 per cent intelligenceincrease for all subjects; see Stafford, Psychedelics Encyclopedia.)Walter Bowart has documented at length, in his Operation Mind Control, thathypnosis plus neurochemicals is more effective than ordinary hypnosis; thatBehavior Mod plus neurochemicals is more effective than ordinary Behavior Mod;and that any mind-altering technique is more effective with neurochemicals thanwithout. Bowart’s evidence is all drawn from the misuse or perversion of thesetechniques, in the Army and CIA research on brainwashing, but there is no reasonwhy libertarian and humane persons cannot use such knowledge to decondition anddeprogram rather than merely to recondition and reprogram. Safe and saneprinciples for such mind-expansion and intelligence-liberation are already givenin such books as Dr. John Lilly’s Programming and Metaprogramming in the HumanBiocomputer, Neuropolitics, by Dr. Leary, and LSD: The Problem-SolvingPsychedelic, by Stafford and Golightly. Please note that these books deal onlywith mind-liberation via LSD, but we are here talking about chemicals much moreprecise and predictable. (Please reread the last sentence.)5. If psychopharmacology is beginning to offer us the chance to program,deprogram, and reprogram ourselves at will, we are entering a new stage ofevolution. More than psychoanalysis or General Semantics or TransactionalAnalysis or est or whatever mind-altering techniques of the past one may like,neurochemistry represents a real quantum jump to a new level of freedom: thehuman nervous system studying and improving itself, intelligence studying andimproving intelligence.To be even more specific and definite about this, consider the October 1975McGraw-Hill poll of scientific opinion about what advances can be expectedbefore 2000. The majority of neuroscientists in that poll predicted specificdrugs to permanently increase human intelligence (see No More Dying, by Kurzmanand Gordon, p. 4). I have saved this for mention after the more general Klinepredictions to avoid the impression that I am talking only about the increase ofthird-circuit linear I.Q. There are seven other kinds of intelligence.6. There is a direct feedback loop between psychopharmacology and the otherbrain sciences, such as electrical stimulation of the brain (ESB) andbiofeedback, etc. As William S. Burroughs says, “Anything that can be donechemically can be done by other means.” Jean Millay and others have demonstratedthat yoga plus biofeedback produces detachment from imprintedemotional-perceptual sets much quicker than yoga alone. John Lilly hasduplicated LSD effects with his isolation tanks. Jose Delgado has produced withESB many effects previously found only with drugs.It is commonplace for alarmists to warn us that the full armory ofsynergetically interacting neurosciences now evolving will allow unscrupulousgovernments to brainwash whole populations more totally than ever before. Weneed to realize that the same technology, wisely used by intelligent men andwomen, can free us from every form of neurotic and irrational rigidity, allow usto dial and focus our nervous systems as easily as we dial or focus a TV set,turning any circuit on or off as we choose.Why be depressed when you can be happy, dumb when you can be smart, agitatedwhen you can be tranquil? Obviously most people are depressed, dumb, andagitated most of the time because they lack the tools to repair and correctdamaged, defective circuits in their nervous systems. The NeurologicalRevolution (chemical, electrical, biofeedback, and other) is giving us thosetools. This HEAD Revolution has the Pleasure Principle to fuel it. That is, themore internal freedom you achieve, the more you want; it is more fun to be happythan sad, more enjoyable to choose your own emotions than to have them inflictedon you by mechanical glandular processes, more pleasurable to solve yourproblems than to be stuck with them forever. Drugs to eraseunpleasant memories,drugs to increase or decreaseany emotion,drugs to prolong or shortenchildhood,drugs to foster or terminatemothering behavior. In other words, Intelligence Increase basically meansintelligence-studying-intelligence, and the first thingintelligence-studying-intelligence discovers is that the more intelligent youbecome, the more fun it is to try to become even more intelligent. (Which isjust another way of saying that, neurologically at least, the more freedom youachieve, the more fun it is to work for even greater freedom.) Nobody is moreinteresting to anybody than is that mysterious character we all call “me,” whichis why self-liberation, self-actualization, self-transcendence, etc., are themost exciting games in town. This hedonic feedback explains why anybody who hastaken even one step down the path toward neurological freedom can never becontent to stop there, but is drawn on to the next step, and the next,forever—or as long as Life Extension can give us of forever.7. In summary, Intelligence Increase is desirable, because every single problemconfronting humanity is either directly caused or considerably worsened by theprevailing stupidity of the species; it is attainable, because modern advancesin chemical, electrical, and other forms of brain change are showing us how toalter any imprinted, conditioned, or learned reflex that previously restrictedus; it is hedonic, because the more freedom and intelligence you achieve, themore you see the advantages in seeking even more freedom and even moreintelligence. It can accelerate our progress toward Space Migration and LifeExtension, and toward any other rational goals, by creating more rationality towork on those goals; and it can give us the wisdom to avoid the “bad” results ofLife Extension and Space Migration that conservatives warn us about.Like death and poverty, stupidity has been around so long that most peoplecannot imagine human life without it, but it is rapidly becoming obsolete.However many special-interest groups (politicians, clergy, advertisers, etc.)may profit from stupidity, humanity as a whole will profit more from itsabolition. From here on, we should measure our progress toward our personalgoals, and our contribution to humanity’s world-round progress, in terms of howmuch smarter we have gotten in the last year, the last month, the last week, THELAST HOUR.

I wonder how many of the Cowboys can see theHigh Frontier invisible to Oglesby? And I wonder if Oglesby has investigated howmuch Cowboy wealth is invested in space industry?

THE PARANOIDS ARERIGHT: THEY’VE GOT LOTSOF ENEMIES(Who would want to be their friends?)"},{"pageContent":"QUANTUM MECHANICS AS A BRANCH OF PRIMATE PSYCHOLOGY [Contents.html#tch4]BY SIMON MOONAccording to the Copenhagen Interpretation invented in the middle of theCarlsberg brewery 1926 by Niels Bohr the world-as-known-to-science is not amodel of the real world but is—at one step remove—a model of the human mindbuilding a model of the real world.The science of sciences, then, THE SCIENCE, the fountainhead, becomesepistemology, which is a branch of human psychology, which is a branch ofprimate psychology and of primate neurology.The primate genetic imperatives of territoriality, pack hierarchy, rage-threatreflexes, rule by an alpha male, all play a role in the theorizing/modeling ofdomesticated primates like us.Or, as Eddington said, “We have certain preconceived notions of location inspace that have come down to us from ape-like ancestors.” Get into your brain,into the Jungian “collective unconscious,” the DNA archives, to find the originof philosophy, art, and modern physics including the Copenhagen Interpretation.But according to David Bohm 1952 the quantum jump is controlled by a subquantumhidden variable which is nonlocal: here, there, and everywhere in space: now,then, and everywhen in time. If Bohm is right, the primate brain (which devisedLear and Beethoven’s Ninth and tic-tac-toe along with quantum mechanics) is theproduct of DNA architectural design to terraform Terra which is dependent uponquantum bonding of the DNA helix which, in turn, is determined by quantumjumpiness determined itself by the hidden variable nonlocal in spacetimeomniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent as any theologian’s God.If Bohr is right, the primary study is that of the brain and consciousness(primate neurology); but if Bohm is right the primary study is that of thehidden variable nonlocal in spacetime (cosmic organization: negative entropy,inc.)Since Bohr himself said “The opposite of a trivial truth is false; the oppositeof a great truth is also true,” we can synthesize Bohr/Bohm and conclude thatprimate neurology = the hidden variable which in prescientific language wouldread the soul = God except that to be true to Bohm and to Bell’s Theorem 1964primate neurology (the soul) also = any other point-event which has a view ofthe universe as accurate as that of any other point-event so that if the hiddenvariable = God so does the lampshade or the blue spruce (which is what anyBuddhist or acid-head will tell you even without studying quantum mechanics). SIMON MOON is a second-generation anarchist and holds advanced degrees inmathematics and computer science. Moon consumes gargantuan quantities of pot,hash, acid and peyote, bragging that he hasn’t “had an unhallucinated day since1968.” Easy to arouse, he is hard to pacify and most people prefer to just goaway. “Bucky Fuller says he seems to be a verb,” he told our interviewer, “but Iam definitely a gerund.” He lists his qualifications for membership in theIIluminan as fifty-five experiences of ESP, five hundred fifty-fivedemonstrations of PK, one out-of-book experience, and 2,317 synchronicities. images [images/eye.jpg] Conservatives say it is dangerous to give any group too much political power.Liberals say it is dangerous to give any group too much economic power.

Shea?Wilson: I would hate to be taken seriously. Serious people are always so grimand uptight that they make me want to dance naked on the lawn playing a flute.Of course, as Mavis says in the first volume of the trilogy, nothing is trueunless it makes you laugh, but you don’t really understand it until it makes youcry. The basic situation of humanity is both tragic and comic, since we are alldomesticated apes with marvelous 30-billion-cell brains, which we seldom useefficiently because of domination by the older mammalian parts of the backbrain. I mean, we’re living on the Planet of the Apes, man. Is that funny orserious? It depends on how broad your sense of humor is, I guess.CD: Specifically, are we really to believe that competing secret societiesinitiate and guide the various intellectual, religious, artistic, andmind-warping trends of the world? Or was the secret-society scenario just aparody of right-wing theories, a way of dramatizing authoritarian vs.libertarian trends, or simply your own brainwashing technique?Wilson: To quote Lichtenberg, “This book is a mirror. When a monkey looks in, nophilosopher looks out.” Illuminatus!, like Linda Lovelace, is all things to allmen. It’s the first novel deliberately written from the viewpoint of themulti-model agnosticism of modern quantum physics. The novelist sitting on apedestal watching the world with the allegedly Objective Eye of God is asobsolete as the tinhorn preacher bawling, “Come to my church, I’ve got the truetrue religion.” The only philosophy one can honestly embrace at this stage ofevolution is agnosticism, or ontological pluralism. The mosaic of competingconspiracies in Illuminatus! is a parody of popular demonology on both Right andLeft. It’s also a serious proposal for a more Einsteinian, relativistic modelthan the monistic Newtonian theories most conspiracy buffs favor. One of thereaders who really seems to have understood Illuminatus! is Dr. Timothy Leary,who told me last year that his experiences with the DEA, FBI, CIA, PLO, WeatherUnderground, Mansonoids, Aryan Brotherhood, Al Fattah, etc., were precisely likethe most absurd parts of Illuminatus! Tim says you meet the same 24 conspiracieswherever you go. Specifically, he mentioned that he identified the same 24palaeolithic gangs fighting over the turf in Folsom Prison that he hadrecognized at Harvard University. The ones at Harvard speak better English, ofcourse.CD: How do you react to my theory that religious cults and secret societies arenot prime movers, but simply pawns in the hands of amoral, StirneriteInternational Bankers? As I recall, you hint in Illuminatus! that theInternational Bankers are controlled by the Illuminati.Wilson: In the first place, I’m delighted that you call your scenario a theoryand don’t insist it’s a proven fact. That raises you several degrees higher onthe intelligence scale than most conspiracy buffs, who appear never to havestudied logic, semantics, epistemology, or scientific method. They think thatany wild idea that enters their heads must be true because it makes them feeleven more terrified than they were yesterday. You see, most conspiracy buffs areadrenalin freaks and really get off on frightening the blue daylights out ofthemselves (and others). This is the same weird imprint that makes people go tosadistic horror movies.Second, I think your theory is as plausible as my theory—or six or seven othertheories. In general, however, I doubt very much that the International Bankers,or any other gang of pirates, knows what the hell is going on. Like every otherconspiracy, they like to imagine they’re really on top of everything, but that’sjust ego-tripping. As I point out in the Snafu Principle in volume two ofIlluminatus!, communication is only possible between equals. Every hierarchy isa communication jam. Every ruling elite suffers from Progressive Disorientation:the longer they rule, the crazier they get. That’s because everybody lies to themen in power—some to escape punishment, some to flatter and curry favor. Theresult is that the elite get a very warped idea of the world indeed. Thisapplies to all pyramidal organizations—armies, corporations, or governments. Iteven applies to old-fashioned patriarchal families. The individual or group atthe top feed entirely on flattering and deceptive garbage (the Howard Hughessyndrome). Gloriosky, the tales I could tell about corporations where I’veworked. . . such things are only possible on the Planet of the Apes.Anyhow, the bankers are only part of a much bigger and stupider game, in whichdozens of coalitions are plotting and scheming to deceive and rip off theothers. The best model for understanding capitalist coalitions is Von Neumannand Morgenstern’s Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, which points out thatevery coalition attempts to hide or hoard important signals. (Information, likeeverything else, becomes a commodity in capitalism, and typical mammalianhoarding behavior sets in. The more secrets a coalition has, the more importantthey think they are.) Intelligence depends on rapid exchange of signals,unfortunately for conspirators, so the hoarding of signals (“Top Secret,” “YourEyes Only,” etc.) and the broadcasting of false signals (the politics of lying)reduce the IQ of those who are doing it even more catastrophically than thegeneral intelligence of the whole society. Progressive Disorientation, as Icalled it before, is the ultimate fate of all conspiratorial systems. That’s whyDr. Leary has the slogan “No More Secrets” for the Starseed Group—a coalitionwhich is attempting a triple mutation in this generation, namely Space Migrationplus Intelligence Increase plus Life Extension. (SMI2LE, in Leary’s convenientabbreviation.) Secrets are more dangerous to those who hoard them than to thoseexcluded. Of course, Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., understood this beforeLeary and always told the opposition in advance exactly what they were going todo and where and when and why. That’s the only way to end the paranoia thatinfests this planet and to get out of the mammalian territorial game into a morehuman and rational game. Taxation is robbery, based on monopoly of weapons.Rent is the daughter of taxation, the taxation of land by private groups, basedon monopoly of land.Interest is the son of rent, the rent of money, based on monopoly of coinage.In the “free market,” competition would drive price down to the level of cost(approximately).In monopoly capitalism, price always equals at least cost plus taxation plusrent plus interest.Monopoly capitalism is not a free market. I also think the conspiratorial element in banking should not be overstressed,for two reasons. First, of course, it has been impossible to talk about bankers’conspiracies since the 1930s without most of your audience thinking you are aNazi or, at least, an anti-Semite. This is what is called a conditionedassociation, or uncritical inference, and, however illogical it is, it is verywidespread. I’ve been attacking the bankers since about 1962, and I never stopgetting mail from two groups of idiots: Jewish idiots who think I’m secretly ananti-Semite, and are angry at me for it; and anti-Semitic idiots who also thinkI’m a secret anti-Semite, and are glad to welcome me to their loathsome club.(Of course, what makes this “anti-banker” = “anti-Jew” equation totally absurdis that the biggest banks in America today are controlled by old New EnglandProtestant families—the “Yankees” in Carl Oglesby’s quite plausible “Cowboys vs.Yankees” scenario, which holds that these Yankees are in a life-and-deathstruggle with Texas oilmen and other Western coalitions.)Second, and more important, I am convinced that the problem in our bankingsystem is structural, not personal. That is, if Jesus and his 12 apostles tookover the Federal Reserve tomorrow, but were not allowed to change the rules, theFed would still be a monstrosity. In other words, it doesn’t matter who theplayers are. It is the game itself, the monopoly on issue of currency, that isthe problem.Of course, none of this is meant to deny that the bankers do conspire—just asthe oil people conspire, or the marijuana smugglers, or the cliques who run theart world, etc. As Adam Smith said 200 years ago, “Men of the same professionnever gather together except to conspire against the general public.”I see the power game as resting on three levels of force and fraud. First,earliest and still most powerful is the government racket itself, the monopolyon force (military power, police power, etc.) which allows the governing groupto take tribute (taxation) from the enslaved or deluded masses. Second,derivative from this primordial conquest, is the landlord racket, the mammalianmonopoly on territory which allows the king’s relatives (lords-of-the-land) ortheir successors, today’s “land-lords,” to take tribute (rent) from those wholive within the territory. Rent is the daughter of taxation; the second degreeof the same racket. Third, the latest in historical time, is the usury racket,the monopoly on the issue of currency which allows the money-lords to taketribute (interest) on the creation of money or credit, and on the continuouscirculation of the money or credit every step of the way. Interest is the son ofrent, the rent of money. Since most people engaged in nefarious practices are,in my opinion and contrary to your model, very loathe to acknowledge what theyare doing, and are addicted to the same hypocrisies as the rest of humanity, Ithink all power groups quite sincerely believe that what they are doing isproper, and that anybody who attacks them is a revolutionary nut. Outside of theKlingons on Star Trek, I have never encountered a real predator who justifieshimself on Stirnerite or Machiavellian grounds. I really think Saroyan wasright, naive as it sounds, in saying that “every man is a good man in his owneyes. “Specifically, I don’t think Rockefeller and his friends talk among themselveslike old-fashioned stage villains, gloating over how they’re “duping” and“exploiting” the rest of us (as you portray them in your Occult Technology ofPower, otherwise an excellent book). They talk about “maintaining the civilizedorder,” like the professor who works for them in the Council on ForeignRelations scene in Illuminatus! That’s the kind of jargon used by CarrollQuigley, the one Establishment historian who really gave away the show; and inthe Trilateral Commission report, The Crises in Democracy, you find the sameself-flattering image. This is hardly surprising. All the other coalitions andconspiracies think of themselves as the Good Guys, too. Everybody thinks thecompetition or the insurrectionary forces are the Bad Guys.CD: While it may be true that conspiracy buffs are “adrenalin freaks,” isn’t italso true that the much more common and respectable “trusting souls” areself-pacifiers who are afraid to consider frightening theories of reality,regardless of evidence?Wilson: Certainly! The first circuit of the nervous system, the infantilebiosurvival imprint, tends to produce a robotic program oftrust-dependency-optimism or of suspicion-fear-withdrawal, and this usuallyremains constant for life. Both extremes of this imprint are quite mechanical.Illuminatus! is an ontological hotfoot, intended to provoke some real corticalactivity in place of these robot imprints. images [images/chap07_ufig_01.jpg]CD: It seems obvious that most people are biased in the self-calming direction,and that this complacent, attitude plays right into the hands of conspirators inbusiness and government. Comment?Wilson: Perhaps we are talking about different planets. My experience is thatalmost everybody thinks somebody else is to blame for their problems. If itisn’t the Jews or the Catholics or the International Bankers, it’s the Masons orthe ecologists or the local utility. Kids blame their parents. Parents blametheir kids. In a sense, all of these “conspiracy” theories are self-calming, inthat they put the problem outside in an “enemy” who can be hated and blamed, butthat is the only sense in which I find the average domesticated primate to beself-calming. To organize a lynch mob or a riot—to yell, “The Enemy’s overthere, fellers!” and get a crowd behind you—is still the easiest game on thePlanet of the Apes. The most important passage in Illuminatus!, to me, is the“Now Look What You Made Me Do” fable by the Dealy Lama (which is now a rock songin the English stage version of Illuminatus!) and that’s the real moral of thetrilogy. We can only be sane and responsible if we stop looking outsideourselves for strength (Big Daddy or God) or for somebody to blame (The Devil).God and Devil are real, but inside us.Of course, I got the idea for “Now Look What You Made Me Do” from Laurel andHardy. I forget which of their movies it was in, but I remember Hardy, aftersome disaster, turning to Laurel and saying, “Now look what you made me do.” Ithit me in a flash that, like all great moments in comedy, this was a profoundepiphany in the Joycean sense, a synecdoche of how people always try to blamesomebody else for their own behavior.Preceding was written in 1976; following was written in 1979.The difference between me and Conspiracy Digest is that CD defines the PowerElite as somebody else. I always define the Power Elite as myself and myfriends.CD and I are in basic agreement that certain kinds of power are vested in: (a)those who monopolize weaponry, i.e., governments; (b) those who monopolize land,i.e., landlords; and (c) those who monopolize currency, i.e., banks of issue. Wedisagree in that CD regards these traditional monopolies as possessing the onlykind of power that matters on this planet; and I recognize another kind ofpower, Brain power.Brain power (the work of all artists, scientists, and symbolizers since the dawnof humanity, but particularly those of the nineteenth century) created the “realworld” over which monopolists fight each other in the twentieth century.Similarly, Brain power right now, today, is creating the “real world” of thetwenty-first century, over which the monopolies will then be struggling. TheBrain people create the realities over which the Power people fight each other,and the Brain people even create the techniques of the fight.Specifically, World War III has been prevented by one Primus Illuminatus namedJohn Von Neumann, already mentioned in connection with his quantum-mechanicswork and his theory of games. Von Neumann also designed the first programmablecomputer, which he whimsically named MANIAC (Multiple Analyzer NumericalIntegrator And Computer). When militarists everywhere began using programmable(post-Von Neumann) computers and the Von Neumann game theory to analyze “wargames,” they quickly learned that nuclear war is a no-win situation. Their ownstrategists, examining possible war scenarios with Von Neumann’s math in VonNeumann’s computers, were forced to realize that thermonuclear showdown wasun-winnable; hence, traditional power politics now operates with cold wars, bushwars like Vietnam, wars of intelligence agencies against intelligence agencies,etc., but not with World Wars.The same Brain power can create a twenty-first century in which the powerstruggles will be, perforce, intelligence struggles, and no violence will bepossible. ROBERT ANTON WILSON is an imaginary being created by God. Since he is fairlybright, Wilson has figured this out and knows he has no real existence asidefrom the mind of God. Nonetheless, he still relapses into taking himselfseriously on occasion.© Copyright 1977, Conspiracy Digest, Box 766, Dearborn, MI 48121 images [images/chap07_ufig_02.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"NEUROECONOMICS [Contents.html#tch8] BY HAGBARD CELINESociety derives from sex, from reproductive relationships. Mammalian pair bondsand pack bonds (imprinted emotions of affection and trust) held the first humanbands and tribes together as working units. At the center, the hub, stood theorgasmic tenderness—the shared love of the genital embrace in the mating act—andout of this radiated the “sublimated” tenderness of parent-infant,brother-sister, uncles and aunts and grandparents, the whole “extended family”or hunting/food-gathering band.Society derives from sex, from mammalian pair bonds and pack bonds.The conquering State, and the subsequent fission of society into separateclasses of privileged and deprived, created poverty. Poverty as a humaninstitution derives from conquest, from the establishment of government (theinvading warrior band, remaining to rule that which they have conquered), andfrom the institution of “laws” to perpetuate the class division between Invadersand Invaded.The human, like any other primate, contains neurogenetic circuits ready to beimprinted by pair bonds and pack bonds. The evolutionary purpose of these bondsremains classically mammalian: they insure biosurvival and pack status. Theyalso program most of the seed with the heterosexual-reproductive behaviorsnecessary for the survival of the pack, which in turn provides biosurvivalsecurity for future generations.The State, fissioning society into separate classes of the privileged anddeprived, created poverty.The rise of the conquering State, the feudal State, and eventually the moderncapitalist State has progressively undermined and subverted the tribal pack bond(the “extended family”). In the most advanced capitalist nation, USA, littlepack bonding remains. Hardly any US citizens will stop for hitchhikers, give tobeggars on the street, or even trust their neighbors. Many don’t even know theirneighbors. Normal pack bonding behaviors of trust, charity, affection, etc.,still found in the feudal nations, have atrophied here. The celebrated “anomie,”“anxiety,” “alienation,” etc., of capitalist society begins from this lack ofnormal pack bonding.The circuits which normally imprint a pack bond still survive, ethologicallyspeaking. (In psychological language, the same thought would be expressed bysaying that the need for biosurvival security still survives.) This mammalianconstant must be satisfied, and in an abstract society the satisfaction becomesabstract.Paper money becomes the biosurvival imprint in capitalist society.Paper money becomes the biosurvival imprint in capitalist society.William S. Burroughs has compared capitalism to heroin addiction, pointing outthe terrible parallels: the junkie must have regular doses; the capitalistcitizen must have a regular money fix. If junk is not available, the addictbecomes a spasmodic bundle of anxieties; if money is not available, thecapitalist citizen goes through similar withdrawal trauma. When junk becomesscarce, junkies behave desperately, and will steal or even kill. When moneybecomes scarce, capitalist citizens will also rob or kill.Opiate drugs, according to Dr. Timothy Leary, function as biosurvival circuitneurotransmitters. That is, they activate neural networks keyed to themother-infant bond. (In the terms of preneurological Freudian psychology, thejunkie in the arms of Mother Opium regresses to infantile bliss.) In a societywithout the normal mammalian pack bond, similar imprinting occurs on money, byconditioning learned associations onto the infantile reflexes. The capitalistcitizen learns neurologically that money equals security and lack of moneyequals insecurity.Infantile separation anxiety (the fear of losing the all-providing Mother)became generalized to tribal separation anxiety quite early in hominidevolution. The person thrown out of the tribe for deviant or antisocial behaviorexperienced real survival anxiety. (The tribe, in primitive conditions, has muchgreater survivability than the lone individual. Ostracism then usually meantdeath, just as ostracism from Mother can mean death to the infant.)Since money has replaced the tribe in capitalist society, the majority ofcitizens have imprinted onto money the traditional mammalian emotions of theinfant-mother and individual-pack survival bonds. This imprinting is maintainedby conditioned associations created by real deprivation experience. Before therise of welfarism, people did die of money withdrawal in capitalist society, inlarge numbers; and it still happens occasionally, among the very ignorant, thevery timid, the very old. (E.g., an elderly couple froze to death in Buffalo, afew years ago, when they were unable to pay their utility bill and the localmonopoly shut off their heat, in January.)The frequent European observation that Americans “are money-mad” merelysignifies that capitalist abstraction, and decline of the tribe, has advancedfurther here than in European capitalist states.The American, deprived of money, lurches about like a frenzied lunatic.“Anxiety,” “anomie,” “alienation,” etc., increase exponentially, reinforced byreal security deprivations. The poor in less abstracted societies share a packbond and “love” each other (on a village level). The poor in America, lackingthe pack bond, hooked only on money itself, hate each other. This explains theparadoxical observation of many commentators that poverty retains dignity andeven some pride in traditional societies, but appears dishonorable and shamefulhere. Indeed, the American poor not only hate each other; often, perhapsusually, they hate themselves.The American, deprived of money, lurches about like a frenzied lunatic.These facts of neuroeconomics have been so charged with pain and embarrassmentthat most Americans will not discuss them at all. The sexual prudery of thenineteenth century has become money prudery. People will talk, in the avantthird of the population anyway, quite explicitly about the fetishistic aspectsof their sex imprints (“I get off on wearing my wife’s underwear during theforeplay,” or whatnot), but equal frankness about our money needs freezes theconversation and may empty the room.Behind superficial pain and embarrassment lies mammalian terror: biosurvivalanxiety.The mobility of modern society escalates this money-anxiety syndrome. During the1930s depression, for instance, many grocers and other “corner stores” allowedcustomers to run up quite large bills, over periods of months sometimes. Thiswas based on the last tattered fragments of the traditional tribal bond and thefact that everybody still knew everybody in the neighborhoods of those days (40years ago). Today, it would not happen. We live, as one novel said, in a “worldfull of strangers.”In the opening chapter of The Confidence Man, Melville contrasts the “religiousnut” who carries a sign saying “LOVE ONE ANOTHER” with the merchants whose signssay, “NO CREDIT.” The irony was meant to reflect on the uneasy mixture ofChristianity and capitalism in nineteenth-century America—but Christianity, likeBuddhism and the other posturban religions, appears to be largely an attempt torecreate the tribal bond on a mystical level within “civilized” (i.e.,imperialist) times. Welfarism represents the State’s attempt to counterfeit sucha bond (in a stingy and paranoid fashion, in the spirit of capitalist law).Totalitarianism appears as the eruption, in murderous fury, of the same endeavorto convert the State into a tribal nexus of mutual trust and biosurvivalsupport.The dawn of libertarian philosophy in America featured two tendencies whichmodern libertarians have neglected—unwisely, if the above analysis proves sound.I refer to the emphasis on voluntary association—retribalization on a higherlevel, through shared evolutionary goals—and on alternative currencies. Theformer of these ideas appears prominently in Warren, Greene, Spooner and Tucker,among others; the latter in all the above and in Dana, Ingalls, C. L. Schwartz,Joseph Labadie, Bilgrim, Levy, etc.Voluntary associations or communes without alternative currencies quickly becomereabsorbed into the capitalist cash nexus. Voluntary associations withalternative currencies openly declared get ground up in the courts anddestroyed. Voluntary associations using covert or secret currencies, as inIlluminants!, may actually exist, to judge from hints or codes in someright-wing libertarian publications.No form of libertarianism or anarchism (including anarchocapitalism andanarcho-communism) can successfully compete with welfarism or totalitarianism,under present conditions.Current welfare practices emerged from 70 years of struggle between liberals andconservatives; the conservatives won most of the battles. The system functionsto heighten the addiction syndrome. The recipient gets a small fix at thebeginning of the month, nicely calculated to support one extremely frugal miseruntil about the 10th of the month. Through hard experience, he or she learns tomake this last until the 15th, maybe even to the 20th. The rest of the month isexperienced as acute biosurvival anxiety. This deprivation period, as any pusheror Skinnerian conditioner knows, maintains the whole cycle. On the first of thenext month, another money fix is allowed, and the whole drama begins anew.The welfare rolls steadily increase, since—even with the most bumblinginefficiency and redundancy—the tendency of industrialism remains, asBuckminster Fuller says, to do more with less and omniephem-eralize. Eachdecade, fewer will have jobs and more will be on welfare. (Already, 0.5 per centown 70 per cent of the wealth, leaving 99.5 per cent to compete violently forthe remainder.) The end result could become a totally conditioned society,entirely abstract, motivated only by neurochemical money addiction.To measure our advance toward that condition, imagine vividly what you would doand feel if all your money and sources of money disappeared tomorrow.It is important to bear strongly in mind that we are still discussing standardmammalian behaviors. In recent research, chimpanzees have been trained to usemoney. The reports indicate that they developed normal “American” attitudestoward the mysteriously powerful tokens.Each decade, fewer will have jobs and more will be on welfare.The Illuminati pyramid on the dollar bill, like the similar “magick” emblems ofthe Fleur de Lys, Swastika, Two-Headed Eagle, Stars, Suns, Moons, etc., withwhich other nations have seen fit to festoon their State currencies ordocuments, is intrinsic to the “spookiness” of the whole monopolization of manaor psychic energy by the State. Here are two pieces of green paper; one ismoney, the other is not. The difference is that the former was “blessed” by thewizards in the Treasury Buidling.The capitalist worker lives with the same perpetual anxiety as the opiateaddict. The source of biosurvival security, the neurochemistry of feeling safe,is hooked to an external power. The conditioned chain money equals security, nomoney equals terror, is reinforced continually by seeing others “fired” andfallen by the wayside. Psychologically, this state may be categorized as chroniclow-grade paranoia. Politically, the manifestation of this neurochemicalimbalance is known as Fascism: the Archie Bunker/Adolph Schickelgruber/RichardNixon mentality.As Leary says, “Fear and rage restrictions on freedom now dominate our sociallife . . . fear and restricting violence can become addictive kicks, reinforcedby schizophrenic policymakers and an economic system which depends uponrestricting freedom, and upon the production of fear and the inciting of violentbehavior.”In Desmond Morris’s perfect metaphor, the naked ape behaves exactly like a zooanimal: despair is the essence of the cage experience. In our case, the bars areintangible, imprinted game-rules: Blake’s “mind-forg’d manacles.” We areliterally being robbed blind. We have literally taken leave of our senses. Theconditioned token, the symbol money, controls our mental well-being.This appears to be what Norman O. Brown is groping to say in his occult-Freudiantomes about our “polymorphous perversity” (natural body rapture) being destroyedin the process of conditioning sublimated sex (group bonding) onto social gameslike money. The Resurrection of the Body that Brown foresees can only happen bymeans of neurosomatic mutation or, as Leary calls it, Hedonic engineering.Historically, the only groups that have managed to detach themselves effectivelyfrom the social game anxiety have been (1) absolutely secure aristocracies, freeto explore the various “mental” and “physical” pleasures, and (2) communes ofshared voluntary poverty, a form of retribalization by sheer determination.Libertarians, like other idealists and malcontents of Left and Right, generallysuffer a wounding sense of the ghastly chasm between their evolutionary goalsand the present grim reality. This sense vastly complicates the resolution oftheir own money-anxiety syndrome, with the result that virtually all of themfeel intense guilt about the ways they acquire the money necessary to survive inthe domesticated-ape world around us.“He has sold out,” “She has sold out,” “I have sold out,” are accusations hearddaily in every idealistic clique.Any way of “making money” automatically opens one to guilt-inducing vibrationsfrom one faction, while it paradoxically spares one from further guilt-inducingvibrations from another faction. Catch-22, the Double Bind, the Snafu Principle,etc., are merely extensions of the basic neuro-economic trap: You Can’t LiveWithout Money.As Joseph Labadie concluded, “Poverty doth make cowards of us all.”“Poverty doth make cowards of us all.”There is, ultimately, a pleasure in enduring poverty. It is like the pleasure ofsurviving through grief and mourning and loss; the Hemingway pleasure ofstanding firm and continuing to fire at a charging lion; the saint’s pleasure inforgiving those who persecute her. It is not masochism but pride: I have beenstronger than I thought I could be. “I have not wept nor cried aloud.” This isthe joy Nietzsche and Gurdjieff found, in ignoring their cruelly painfulillnesses and writing only of the “awakened” state beyond emotions andattachments.Right-wing paranoia about paper money (the various conspiracy theories about howthe supply and withdrawal of money is manipulated) will always remain epidemicin capitalist society. Junkies have similar myths about the pushers.It is real food, real clothing, real shelter that are threatened when money isremoved, even briefly, and it is real deprivation that occurs when money isremoved for any length of time. The domesticated ape is trapped by a game ofmental symbols, but the trap is deadly.There is some kind of masochistic pleasure in continuing the analysis of apainful subject into every byway and intricacy of its labyrinthine torments.There is something of this beneath the “objectivity” of Marx, Veblen, Freud,Brooks Adams. “As bad as it is, we can at least look at it without screaming,”such writers seem to be assuring us, and themselves.“Only those who have drunk from the same cup know us,” said Solzhenitsyn. He wastalking about prison, not poverty, but the two are alike in being traditionalpunishments for dissent. One takes pride in having borne them, if one survivesat all.A popular opinion suggests that the counter-culture of the 1960s was beaten todeath by cops’ clubs, drug busts, other direct violence. My impression is thatit was simply starved out. The money was cut off, and after sufficientdeprivation the survivors crawled aboard the first capitalist life raft that waspassing.Capitalism, Jack London wrote, has its own heaven (wealth) and its own hell(poverty). “And the hell is real enough,” he added, from bitter experience.Fatherhood is problematical at best, but becomes a hero’s task under capitalism.When the money supply is cut off, the father of a family in the USA todayexperiences multiplied anxiety: fear for self, fear for those who love and trustone. Only the captain of a sinking ship knows this vertigo, this wound.To survive terror is the essence of true Initiation. For they live happiest whohave forgiven most, and, as Nietzsche said, anything that doesn’t kill me makesme stronger.Originally published in No Governor newsletter.

[Contents.html#tch10] I’ve been reading/studying/reveling in Finnegans Wake for 32 years now; Istarted it at 16. Joyce said in one of his joking moods, “This will keep theprofessors busy for the next thousand years,” and I believe him. I find newdepths and profundities, and more jokes, every time I reread it.For the historical record and as a politico-literary irony, it should berecorded that I was turned on to this greatnovel/symphony/jokebook/dream/myth/epic by James T. Farrell.(Who? James T. Farrell was an influential and occasionally brilliantMarxist-realist of the 1930s and 1940s. His books became unfashionable when hispolitics became taboo. Farrell wasn’t as good as the liberal-Marxoid critics ofthe ’30s claimed, but he is good enough not to deserve the oblivion that hasfallen upon him.)Farrell had a defense of the Wake in one of his books of literary criticism. Hesaid that Joyce’s epic investigation of the mind of one man asleep was notdevoid of social significance and that it was a perversion of Marxism to dismisssuch work as irrelevant to the Revolution. I don’t think Farrell convinced asingle Marxist—most of them are still hostile to Joyce—but he convinced me. Ibought the Wake on my 16th birthday, in 1948, started reading it, and haven’tstopped yet.images [images/chap10_ufig_01.jpg]There are many good literary studies of Joyce, but the best introduction toFinnegans Wake is probably Dr. Stanislaus Grof’s Realms of the HumanUnconscious, a study of the head spaces experienced under LSD. In particular,Grof’s term “coex systems” should be understood by everybody who writes aboutJoyce or tries to read him. A “coex system” is a condensed experience montage.E.g., you are reexperiencing the birth process, remembering prebirthinteruterine events, reliving ancestral or archaeological crises ofpeople/animals from whom you are descended, seeing the subatomic energy whorlfrom which Form appears, previsioning the Superhumanity of the future, andsuffering horrible guilt over your unkindness to another child when you werefour years old . . . all at once!Critics have tried to explain Finnegans Wake by means of Freud and Jung, butJoyce was a quantum jump ahead of the psychology of his time. Everything inFinnegans Wake is a coex system in Grof’s sense. We can only understand it interms of the latest findings in neurology, genetics, sociobiology, andexopsychology. To learn to read Finnegans Wake with ease and pleasure is tolearn to think with your whole brain, “conscious” and “unconscious” circuitsincluded, in holistic coex systems.Dr. Nick Herbert devised Diagram A to illustrate a possible “context-dependentlanguage” which could describe modern quantum theory.images [images/chap10_ufig_02.jpg]In such a language A would take its total meaning from the context of B, C, D,and E; B, in turn, would take its total meaning from A, C, D, and E; and soforth. This is also the way an LSD-induced coex system operates, and the way thegreat dream-myth of Finnegans Wake operates.Example: the word “thuartpeatrick” on page 1 of the Wake. With the simultaneityof a coex system, this contains the following.1. “Thou art Peter,” the English version of the pun on which the Catholic Churchis allegedly founded. (Petrus means rock, and Jesus’ pun goes on “and on thisRock I will build my church.”)2. “Tu es Petrus,” the Latin vulgate of the same phrase, superimposed upon theEnglish.3. A pun on “thwart,” relating in the total context of the book to the sexualfrustrations of the dreamer, H. C. Earwicker.4. The “peat ricks” which used to stand beside every Irish home, providing fuel.This is one of a few dozen puns on the first page which help locate the dreamerin Ireland; others more specifically locate him in Dublin.5. A pun on the Gaelic of “Patrick” (“Paidrig”), Ireland’s national saint,another reinforcement of the Irish locale of the dream.6. A pun on “pea trick,” referring to the many other “pea” puns in the book, allrevolving around the phrase “like as two peas in a pod” and referring to thefact that the dreamer’s sons are twins, physically indistinguishable butpsychologically opposite.7. In context, a reference to the repeated refrain “mind your p’s and q’s,”which refers to the dreamer’s guilts generally, and, by the association of thesound of p and “pea,” to “pee” and the dreamer’s unconscious urinary obsession.8. A suggestion that the Catholic Church, or Finnegans Wake itself, or maybeliterature generally, is a “pea trick,” or shell game, a semantic game in whichwords almost become the realities they symbolize.This is not all there is in “thuartpeatrick,” I’m sure; it’s merely what I’vegleaned in 30 or 40 readings of Finnegans Wake. Knowing Joyce’s methods, Iwouldn’t be surprised if there are references to cannibalism in Lithuanian or torivers in Russian also concealed in this word. (For instance, I was convincedfor years that “the whiteboyce of Hoodie Head,” also on page 1, concealed onlythe White Boys, an Irish revolutionary group of the nineteenth century, and theKu Klux Klan, an American parallel. Then I learned that Hode in German istesticles, and realized the phrase signified the spermatozoa in the testicles.)Another delightful example of Joyce’s coex language is “goddinpotty,” fromChapter Four [Chapter04.html]. Here we can find the following superimposed uponeach other.1. Garden party. The speaker in this scene is an Englishwoman and Joyce isparodying English upperclass speech, in which “garden party” indeed sounds like“goddinpotty.”2. Garden party also suggests the Garden of Eden theme that runs all through thebook (from the appearance of Eve and Adam in the first sentence) and, hence, theFall of Man and, thus, in the same line of dream symbolism, the Fall of Finneganfrom which the book takes its title.3. The Fall of Man in the Garden of Eden links up with the dreamer’s guilt aboutsome mysterious “sin” he committed in the bushes in Phoenix Park, Dublin.4. “God” and “din” suggest the thunder god, Thor, who is one of the principalcharacters in the dream—possibly because the thunder strikes ten times duringthe night.5. God-in-potty suggests, to anyone raised Catholic, the Host in the chalice,the bread that becomes the Body of God when the priest speaks the magic formulaover it.6. But the dreamer himself is the Host, in two senses: (a) in waking life, he isHost of an inn; (b) throughout the dream, he is periodically denounced,condemned, executed, and devoured cannibalistically, and rises from the dead.This repeats the pattern of the Christ myth, just as the blessing and eating ofthe Host in the Mass does. It also repeats all the other dead-and-resurrectedvegetation gods in Jung’s collective unconscious. (In the Freudian personalunconscious, the trials and executions represent the dreamer’s sexual guilts.)7. “Potty” again brings in the dreamer’s infantile urinary obsessions.It will be observed that in analyzing only two phrases (three words) from theWake, we have stumbled upon virtually every important theme of the dream, of thehero’s personal unconscious, and of humanity’s collective DNA archives. Joycedoesn’t pack quite that much into every phrase, of course; but if you have foundonly two levels of reference in one of his puns, you have probably missed atleast two others, and maybe as many as in these examples.Finnegans Wake is not just a great novel and a semantic symphony; it contains awhole science of psychoarchaeology and historical neurolinguistics. As JohnGardner said of it, “Joyce dredged in that book. No other human being in thehistory of the world, including Beethoven, has ever given every single piece ofemotion and thought and feeling the way Joyce did. He dredged up every ounce ofhis soul, every cell, every gene.”"},{"pageContent":"FROM: THE ORDER OF THE ILLUMINATI, SIRIUS SECTION [Contents.html#tch11]TO: GALACTIC CENTRAL [Contents.html#tch11] The progress of the domesticated primates of Terra has been advancing nicelysince we introduced the Tarot deck five krals ago. As predicted, the amusementof the Tarot game has led to wide dispersion of the cards among the primates,and some have inevitably learned to use the cards also for scanning quantumprobability waves and thus foreseeing “future” events. A few have even begun todecode the evolutionary script in the structure of the deck. We have, therefore,elected to introduce a second educational device among them, once againdisguised as a game.The new game is called “chess.” Detailed instructions for play, with a hologramof the playing board, are enclosed as an appendix to this report.The purpose of the chess board is to insinuate a correct model of the primatebrain into the semantic circuit of said brain, with the hope that, as with theTarot, the smarter primates will gradually decipher it.To begin with, we have made the board of black and white squares, although itcan be altered to black and red, or any other starkly contrasting polarity, assuits the whims of various primate artisans. The essential signal will remainthe same, although black/white is, of course, the strongest artistic expressionof the encoded symbolism.The primal message is, as Your Lucidity will readily scan, the basicpositive-negative (off-on) pulsation of all energy forms. Since we have alreadyinfiltrated this signal into Terran culture in several other artifacts and toys(see Memo 2317, “On the Chinese Yin-Yang and Related Electronic Codes”), themore intuitive primates will easily recognize its reiteration 32 times in the 64squares of the chess board. We thus hope confidentially that some of them willeventually contemplate the relation between the eight rows of the board, theeight files, the proportions of 8 × 4 = 32 and8 × 8 = 64, etc., thereby deducingthe great Law of Octaves which we are still trying to teach them.Since the chess board itself models the Terran brain, as they will graduallyrealize, the black-white symbolism will help them to intuit the relationshipbetween the active left hemisphere (Yang) and the passive right hemisphere(Yin). As in all neurogenetic codes, we include extra information in eachsignal. Thus we hope the on-off (positive-negative) symbol will simultaneouslysuggest to them the on-off nature of consciousness itself (and the unreality oftheir current static self-images or egos); the off-on functioning of theindividual synapse; the on-off of the emotional-glandular switches; the off-onof the sleep-waking cycle; etc.We cheerfully predict that, within only a few tneks, some Terran primate gazingat a chess board will intuit “in a flash,” as they say, that the repeatedpattern of black-white-black-white-black-white-black-white, etc., is the peakand crest of a sine wave, entirely similar to their own + − + − + − + − brainprocesses. In short, a philosopher will arise among them to announce that theillusion of a continuous ego is caused by insufficient self-observation.*To reiterate the basic application of the plus-minus polarity to the Terranbrain, we have encoded the signal in a more complex and subtle way into thelarger design of the chess board. That is, we have divided it into a seeminglystrong “King side” and a seemingly weak “Queen side.” We have also divided it(rather obviously) into a “strong” white side and a “weak” black side. Thestrength of the white side is so blatant, in fact, that the primates, as soon aswe introduced the game, established a tradition to “make the game more fair.”This tradition obliges the players to exchange roles, so that whoever is white(has the advantage) in one game must play black (have the disadvantage) inanother game.This is where we get sneaky. Having discovered that one side of the board isstronger, going up the ranks, they will soon try to learn if one half isstronger, going across on the files. It will seem obvious to them that the“King” side (from white’s perspective) is stronger. To make the neurologicallesson obvious even to a Terran primate, we have placed the “strong” King sidewhere the right hand of the “strong” (white) player naturally rests. Thus, eachtime primates play this “harmless game,” they will be neurologically absorbingthe information that the “strong” right hand is connected with the “King side”modes of thought, i.e., those in the left hemisphere of the brain (Yang).It is our estimate that, given the dominance of right-hand, left-hemispherefunctions in all primitive species at this stage of development, and given alsothe mode of male superiority that the primates of Terra have currently adopted,they will almost all try to win the game on the “King side.” This is one of thejokers built into our code.We estimate that it will take 1.5 krals before even the cleverest of the Terransrealizes that the “Queen side,” corresponding to the left-hand, right-hemisphereneurological mode, is actually the stronger side. This lesson should have adramatic “shock treatment” effect on their evolution.*It is further hoped that the 64 squares of the total chess board will eventuallytransmit the concept of the 64 codons of the genetic code, especially since wehave already infiltrated this suggestion into the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching.Even if the 8 x 8 structure does not totally communicate the Law of Octaves tothem, we have reason to hope that within a kral or two they will at leaststumble upon the eightfold nature of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements.To represent their present primitive stage of self-awareness, we employ eightpawns. Each pawn represents an ego state, and the primates will easily identifywith each pawn as they move it. The fact that there are eight pawns, not one,will, we expect, give them some subliminal suggestions about the narrowness oftheir “one ego” view of themselves.We have also arranged the metastructure of the game so that the quickest win canbe obtained by sacrificing the first pawn moved (if the opponent is gullibleenough to succumb to the “grab-at-once” or “attack-at-once” reflex, withoutusing the higher brain circuits). The art of sacrificing pawns skillfully, towin the larger game, will, we hope, insinuate into the Terrans an awareness ofthe necessity to sacrifice each and any ego state for the maximum functioningefficiency of the brain as a whole. In short, the player who is attached to oridentified with any given ego state (pawn) will be defeated by the player whothinks in gestalts, using the whole board, i.e., the whole-brain model.The other eight pieces, like the eight pawns, hint again at the Law of Octaves,and reiterate once more that the single-ego view of consciousness is false, foreach piece represents a different mode of consciousness or a separate braincircuit.The king’s rook, which can move only orthogonally, forward, back, or sideways,represents the most primitive amphibian circuits of the brain, having to do withbiosurvival fight-or-flight reflexes. The orthogonal symbolism also correlateswith the crawling of the newborn infant, when this circuit is being imprinted.The double symbolism is, we submit, neat but not gaudy.The king’s knight, which leaps up from the board to descend in an unexpectedplace, represents the mammalian predator who leaps upon the prey. Since thissection of the brain is imprinted in the stage wherein the infant rises up,walks, and begins struggling for power in the pack or family, the up-downsymbolism is, we think, neurologically apt.The king’s bishop, which moves on the diagonal, represents the semantic circuit,which creates Euclidean 3D reality maps in the primate brain. We put it on adiagonal, instead of at right angles to the orthogonal rook and up-down knight,because 3D chess is beyond the primates at this point.The king, which stays at home, represents the fourth circuit: mating andreproduction.Thus we have provided a complete model of the circuits of the left brain,standing before the right hand of the “white” player and hinting powerfully ofthe right-hand/ left-brain feedback loop.The queen side contains a complete model, in turn, of the extraterrestrialcircuits waiting to be activated by DNA-RNA signals at the proper evolutionarytime.The queen’s rook represents the more intense/less intense modulations of theneurosomatic circuit.The queen’s knight, which contains many surprising potentials that chess playerswill not discover for at least a tnek, represents the electronic perspectives ofthe sixth, metaprogramming circuit.*The queen’s bishop, moving diagonally like the king’s bishop, represents theneurogenetic circuit of DNA evolutionary intelligence, as contrasted with thenarrow egotistic intelligence of the individual primate.The queen herself, the only piece that can move any distance in any direction,represents the neuroatomic circuit, beyond all their concepts of space and time.(She also represents Our Lady of the Stars, but it will take an oroblram beforethey figure that out.)Finally, to illustrate that any mode of consciousness can graduate through HEADwork to the neuroatomic transtime perspective, we have arranged the rules of thegame so that any pawn, by moving upward to the eighth rank (i.e., through theeight brain circuits), can become a Queen, i.e., a space-time traveler.We confidently believe, Your Vastness, that the chess game will be one of themost successful educational devices we have introduced to the Terran primates. images [images/eye.jpg]___________* Addendum: It happened within only two krals. The philosopher was named Gotama,and his disciples made a religion (Buddhism) out of his observations, garblingthe transmission considerably. Within half a kral, however, another philosophermade the same observation; his name was David Hume, and most of the otherphilosophers are still busy trying to “refute” him. In only an eighth of a kralsince then, a group of clever investigators named Maxwell, Faraday, Planck,Bohr, and Schrödinger made the proper applications of this signal to cosmicenergy generally, and a psychologist named Jung expressed in better scientificlanguage than Gotama or Hume its application to consciousness.* Addendum: As predicted, when the superiority of the “Queen side” wasdiscovered, the event was synchronous with such related right-hemispherephenomena as the use of Oriental perspective in Occidental painting; theBohr-Schrödinger discoveries mentioned above; the rise of Feminism; rapidevolution from “psychology” to precise neuroscience; creation of synergeticgeometry and holistic philosophies of evolution; a Yin revolution; etc.* Addendum: Not until the twentieth century of their calendar did the Terranprimates discover that it was stronger to move the queen’s knight out before theking’s.

After all, it was John Adamsand his Federalists who put a cap on the American Revolution and laced theconstitution with defects that have led our current communazi synthesis!Wilson: I’m more inclined to blame the defects in the constitution on AlexanderHamilton, as Ezra Pound does in his wonderfully provocative Impact: Essays onIgnorance and the Decline of American Civilization. But finding somebody to“blame” for history is Newtonian push-pull thinking. I prefer to analyze eventsas in modern physics, in terms of relativistic signals creating alternativereality maps for different observers. For instance, the California welfaresystem, on which I lived for two years once (gasp, shudder, arrgh!), seems, iflooked at in a linear way, to be nothing but a concerted effort to degrade anddestroy the poor. When you look into it more closely, you find that nobodyplanned it that way; it grew out of constant conflict between the liberals, whowanted one type of welfare system, and the conservatives, who wanted another.The result was a gigantic snafu. The same is true of the constitution, which, asBeard showed (with much more scholarship and objectivity than either Josephsonor Pound), grew out of a real class war between Federalist proprietors andRepublican small farmers, and ended up satisfying neither of them. I’m notinterested in blaming anybody for anything. Most people, as Bucky Fuller says,are too ignorant to be responsible for what they do. I’m interested in gettingthe hell off the Planet of the Apes and building free libertarian communes inspace, where the Free Mind can develop to its full potential, without thecommunication jamming of the 24 conspiracies on Terra.CD: Getting back to Aleister Crowley, do you know anything about his allegedaffiliations with German Intelligence during World War I? In Crowley’sConfessions he admits writing for registered German agent George SylvesterViereck’s propaganda newspaper, International, while in New York (1914), butclaims he was actually a double agent for British Intelligence. Could Crowley’sinvolvement in the Theodore Ruess (German) Ordo Templi Orientis have led toCrowley’s having become involved or instrumental in Establishment conspiracies?Wilson: I don’t know for sure, but it would fit my picture of Uncle Aleister ifhe worked for both British and German Intelligence and also played his own gameagainst both of them. Never underestimate Uncle Al’s sense of humor. Crowley’sreal game, of course, was the Consciousness-Intelligence Revolution, which willeventually raise humanity out of mammalian territorial politics, as we havealready outgrown the gills or tails of earlier evolutionary stages.CD: In your book, Sex and Drugs: A Journey Beyond Limits, you advocate Dr.Timothy Leary’s principle that drug use should be voluntary and thus,presumably, oppose any sort of drug-controlled 1984-type society. In spite ofthe sincere motives of drug advocates, is it not possible that they areunconscious tools of the ruling-class conspiracy? Isn’t it probable that theEstablishment is planning for a drug-controlled culture, à la Ira Levin’s novelThis Perfect Day? Could the Carter administration’s “softening” on drugs(advisor Peter Bourne has launched a trial balloon on heroin, marijuana, andcocaine) be part of a tyrannical, forced drug plot?Wilson: First of all, I object to the term “drug advocates,” which is aninaccurate as calling Kinsey a “homosexuality advocate” because he wrotefactually and objectively, without inflammatory propaganda, on that subject. Orcalling Justice Hugo Black an “obscenity advocate” because he believed peopleshould have the right to decide whether or not they wanted to read a given book.All Leary and I have ever advocated is that the individual, not the government,should decide what experiments (chemical or otherwise) should be conductedwithin the individual’s own nervous system.Leary’s “Two Commandments for the Neurological Age,” 1966, were, first, “Thoushalt not alter the consciousness of thy neighbor without his or her consent,”and the second, which is like unto this, is “Thou shalt not prevent thy neighborfrom altering his or her own consciousness.” (Dr. Leary has recently added aThird Commandment, 1975, which says, “Thou shalt make no more commandments.”)As the first commandment shows, Dr. Leary has always been most urgently aware ofthe problem you raise. Our article on “Brainwashing” in Neuropolitics explainshow mind-programming works and how to outwit it. Dr. Leary’s Exo-Psychology is amanual on brain change and on how to become self-programming. Any brainwashingsystem, even those that use the most powerful metaprogramming chemicals likeLSD, can be successfully resisted by those who understand the techniques beingused. Programming, imprinting, and conditioning whole populations can only workwhere there is total secrecy about what is being done. I say in all seriousnessthat the more people who understand the mindfucking techniques dramatized inIlluminatus! and scientifically analyzed in Exo-Psychology, the safer we all areagainst misuse of those techniques. Meanwhile, keeping Leary’s Two 1966Commandments in print is beneficial in itself, because every reader has todecide to agree with both of them, to deny both of them, or to agree with oneand deny the other. Deciding where you stand on that issue is itself a learningexperience. Do you think anybody but yourself has the right to experiment onyour nervous system? That really is the basic philosophical-ethical questionposed by the Neurological Revolution. Remember: the nervous system is whatpre-scientific primates call the “self” or the “soul.” The “self” at the momentdepends on which circuit is activated. The “soul” or metaprogrammer decideswhich circuit or “self” to be at each time-juncture. Do you want to choose yourown “self” or do you want your “soul” on ice?CD: In Sex and Drugs you reveal your acquaintance with Dr. Joel Fort. How do yourespond to the U.S. Labor Party’s charge, in their book Carter and the Party ofInternational Terrorism, that Dr. Fort’s San Francisco Project One was a“brainwashing center” that spawned the Symbionese Liberation Army syntheticzombies for use by the Rockefeller-CIA in “social drama” operations? Purpose: tojustify a police state by creating terrorist episodes.Wilson: Well, since the USLP doesn’t offer any documentation or anything thatwould pass as evidence in a court of law or a meeting of historians, rebuttingthem is like hunting for something solid in a tapioca pudding. I would merelysay that, under the rules of evidence in civilized nations, no jury wouldconvict Dr. Fort on the basis of the kind of allegations made by the USLP; nosane District Attorney or Grand Jury would indict him in the first place; and nosober police department would even call him in for questioning.USLP says, for instance, that the Fort Help office “houses a fully equippedbrainwashing and terrorist command center.” That is not evidence; evidencerequires testimony (preferably by a qualified expert) that the equipment in FortHelp has been used for brainwashing, or at least could be so used. Without suchtestimony, a statement of that sort is allegation, or hearsay, and has noevidential value, however inflammatory it is to the imagination of the naive. Icould just as well say that USLP headquarters “houses all the equipment to makeporno movies and rape old ladies.” USLP also points out that Fort is “a formercollaborator with Dr. Timothy Leary during the 1950s government-sponsoredexperimentation with LSD.” That sentence is (a) guilt by association, a type ofargument known to be invalid in the first place, (b) factually untrue, since Dr.Leary didn’t do any LSD research, for the government or anybody, during the1950s, and (c) irrelevant even if it were true (which it isn’t), since literallyhundreds of scientists have worked with Dr. Leary on one project or another overthe three decades of Leary’s professional career, and that doesn’t proveanything, except that scientists often work in teams or groups.USLP also points out that Fort Help has a mental-patient liberation group“similar to the Heidelberg Mental Patients Collective in Germany that became theBader-Meinhof gang.” The fallacy there was pointed out by Aristotle 2,500 yearsago (similarity is not identity). I could just as well say USLP has a typewriter“similar to the one on which the Lindberg kidnap notes were written.” I feelsilly myself even having to point out such elementary logical fallacies. USLP,in general, seems to aim their publications at people of extreme gullibility andno critical faculties at all. (Also, of course, there are mental-patients’liberation groups all over the country, independent of Fort Help, and it isn’teven clear if, in this particular slander, USLP wants us to believe that onlythe Fort group is like unto the German group or that all mental-patients’liberation groups are like unto it. And, of course, they offer no documentationthat the German group did turn into a “gang.”)USLP also claims to have found one staff member of Fort Help who is, they claim(without documentation), also a member of something called Revolutionary Union.Oh, for Christ’s sake, when Joe McCarthy sank that low—finding one member of theWelch law firm who had once been a communist and trying to use that to discreditWelch—even Roy Cohn was embarrassed, and McCarthy’s most gullible dupes began towake up.Of course, the slanders against many others in USLP’s Carter book are just aslogically and legally invalid, nonevidential, and undocumented as the slandersagainst Dr. Fort.I would also like to add in this connection that every major religion, not justthe Old Testament, has some version of the commandment against bearing falsewitness against thy neighbor. When a man’s character is slandered, not just hesuffers, but his wife, his children, his parents, often his friends. Those whomake a career out of spreading unproven accusations against other humans canonly be forgiven if they really are so ignorant and stupid that they don’t knowthe difference between an assertion and an evidential demonstration. I thinkit’s awfully late to accept that kind of ignorance as an excuse. I think we havea duty to try to know, and to act rationally, responsibly, and decently. In thisconnection, I recommend Wilhelm Reich’s The Murder of Christ, especially thechapter on Mocenigo, the guy who turned Girodano Bruno in to the Inquisition.Reich points out that the slanderer and the assassin are similar types,psychologically; being ugly and unattractive personalities themselves, they canonly achieve status parasitically, by “stealing” it from the innocent victimsthey destroy. Mocenigo wouldn’t be remembered at all if he hadn’t caused theburning of Bruno, and he only gets a footnote for that. The people who havedefamed Freud, Reich, Leary, Fort, Sakharov, Oppenheimer, and other greatscientists in our time will also only get footnotes. Who the hell would rememberMildred Brady today if she hadn’t been the one who incited the FDA to burn Dr.Reich’s scientific books in an incinerator?CD: A major theme in Illuminatus! seemed to be that the authoritarianIllumi-nati seek to achieve immortality (peak experience?) by inflicting deathand suffering, while Hagbard Celine’s Legion of Dynamic Discord achieved samethrough sexual orgasm. How do you defend this apparent dichotomy against thosewho claim (perhaps like Freud and some conservatives) that sex andsado-masochism are inseparably one? Surely this seems to be the position of theMarquis de Sade in Philosophy in the Bedroom. Was Sade an Illuminatus?Wilson: Jesus, don’t confuse the peak experience with the quest for immortality.I agree with Bergson that the search for immortality is a basic human drive(after all, it’s the theme of the oldest novel in the world, the Epic ofGilgamesh) but, because of ignorance and primitive technology, it has taken manycrazy and malevolent forms. In the allegory of Illuminatus!, the Illuminati areseeking spiritual immortality through black magick (human sacrifice), RobertPutney Drake is trying to outwit Death by making it into his company cop—hispower kick—and Hagbard Celine quite intelligently is seeking immortality throughmodern science. See Segerberg’s The Immortality Factor, Tucille’s Here ComesImmortality, Ettinger’s Man Into Superman, and Rosenfeld’s Prolongevity forcurrent trends in life-extension research and eventual immortality. That’s theLE (Life Extension) part of he SMI2LE formula. I can’t see why any sane humanbeing would settle for less.As for the peak experience, that can indeed be achieved in varying degrees bysado-masochism, by polyphase orgasm, or by other methods (isolation, fasting,LSD, etc.). But actually “the peak experience” is a loose and inaccurate phrase;there are 12 ascending states of higher consciousness, catalogued by Dr. Learyand myself in our Game of Life, and each of them sequentially is a higher peak.As a libertarian I am opposed to anything that involves coercive misuse or abuseof other human beings; so I will not condone sado-masochism except among totallyvoluntary participants.I disagree with Freud about sado-masochism. I think Dr. Wilhelm Reich was right,in Mass Psychology of Fascism, saying sado-masochism is a secondary drive thatarises only when the primary sex drive is repressed or warped. Theanthropologist Malinowski, for instance, found no sado-masochism (and no rape)among the sexually free Trobriand Islanders before the Christian missionariesgot in.Making de Sade one of the Inner Five of the original Illuminati in Illuminatus!was one of my little jokes. But who knows. . . ??CD: Was black writer Ishmael Reed’s Mumbo Jumbo the inspiration forIlluminatus!} Could you give us your reaction to Mumbo Jumbo?Wilson: I didn’t read Mumbo Jumbo until about 3 years after Illuminatus! wasfinished. The same is true of Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow. The astonishingresemblances between those three books are coincidence, or synchronicity, orHigher Intelligence (take your pick). I love everything Ishmael Reed writes, andI once sent him an official Discordian certificate making him a Pope in theLegion of Dynamic Discord. One of the many hidden jokes in Illuminatus! (whichis only the tip of the iceberg, being part of a much larger artwork calledOperation Mindfuck) is that the Legion of Dynamic Discord actually exists,despite its preposterous sound, whereas some of the more plausible parts of thetrilogy are deadpan put-ons. As e. e. cummings said to Ezra Pound, “You damnedsadist, you’re trying to force your readers to think!”CD: Are you familiar with Francis King’s Satan and Swastika and Ravenscroft’sThe Spear of Destiny? Do you think black-magick Crowley-type cults were behindHitler and Nazism?Wilson: I’m familiar with most of the literature on Nazi occultism, and puerilestuff it is. The writers all disagree about which occult trade union reallycontrolled Hitler, and every writer tends to blame it on the one occult group heis personally most paranoid about. Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis was banned byHitler, and Karl Germer, Crowley’s successor as Outer Head of the OTO, spentseveral years in a concentration camp (where he very intelligently occupiedhimself with the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel and came out higher thanhe went in). My impression is that Hitler was a medium, not a true shaman, andhence subject to obsession and possession by all varieties of insane, weird,destructive influences and entities.CD: Do you think Hitler was influenced by Crowley’s mysterious Book of the Law,as claimed by Crowley in Magick Without Tears?Wilson: Crowley didn’t claim Hitler was influenced by the Book of the Law, justthat one of Crowley’s German disciples tried to get Hitler interested. If shesucceeded, and Adolph actually looked into it, the results were as prophesied inthe Book itself: “There is a great danger in me; for who doth not understandthese runes shall make a great miss” (II, 27); and “The fool readeth this Bookof Law, and its comment; & he under-standeth it not” (III, 63).© Copyright 1977, Conspiracy Digest, Box 766, Dearborn, MI 48121 The picture of the captured Viet Cong officer being shot through the head byBrig.

In theframework of the book, this seems to imply that various secret societies areworking to bring about the end of the world. Is that a valid interpretation?Wilson: The phrase was coined by a Christian historian, Eric Vogelin, and refersto the Gnostic doctrine that people aren’t really as hopelessly mired inOriginal Sin as Christians think. Eschaton, from the Greek, means the lastthing, and, in Christian theology, this would be Heaven. “Immanentizing theEschaton” means seeking Heaven within the “immanent” universe, i.e., the onlyuniverse we know.To a thoroughgoing Christian pessimist like Vogelin, anybody who tries to behappy or make others happy is dangerously close to Gnostic heresy. I am all forimmanentizing the Eschaton in this sense, next Tuesday if possible. Vogelindetects immanentizing tendencies in humanists, liberals, technologists,optimistic philosophies of evolution like Nietzsche’s, communists, anarchists,and most of the post-medieval thought of the Western World, all of which areovertly or covertly aiming at the verboten “heaven on the material plane.”In the novel, we make the point that conservatives are also in danger ofimmanentizing the Eschaton by continuing a cold war that can only result in Hellon the material plane: nuclear incineration.In one sense, Illuminatus! is a reductio ad absurdum of all mammalian politics,right or left, by carrying each ideology one logical step further than itsexponents care to go. Voltaire used that satirical judo against the Churchmen,and I decided it’s time to turn it on the Statesmen. The only intelligent way todiscuss politics, as Tim Leary says, is on all fours. It all comes down toterritorial brawling.SFR: I understand the Eschaton theme stems from an anti-Gnostic campaign in theNational Review some time ago. Could you fill us in on the origins of the term?Wilson: As I say, it was coined by Vogelin. The anti-Gnostic theme was chronicin conservative circles during the early ‘60s and even got into a Time editorialonce. As an ordained priest of the Gnostic Catholic Church, I find this amusing,since it makes most of the educated classes into unknowing disciples of usGnostics. As Marx said under similar circumstances, “I once shot an elephant inmy pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I’ll never know.”SFR: How serious are you about the rule of fives and the importance of 23?Wilson: If Illuminatus! doesn’t answer that, nothing else will. The documentedfact that I have published serious, or at least pedantic, articles on Cabalashould add to the mystery. The philosophical point of the book is the reader’sown answer to the question, “Is the 5-23 relationship a put-on or an importantCabalistic revelation?” Of course, Cabala itself is a complicated joke, but allprofound philosophies turn out to be jokes.SFR : How serious are you about the Illuminati and conspiracies in general?Wilson: Being serious is not one of my vices. I will venture, however, that theidea that there are no conspiracies has been popularized by historians workingfor universities and institutes funded by the principal conspirators of ourtime: the Rockefeller-Morgan banking interests, the Council on Foreign Relationscrowd, the Trilateral Commission. This is not astonishing or depressing.Conspiracy is standard mammalian politics for reasons to be found in ethologyand Von Neumann’s and Morgenstern’s Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.Vertebrate competition depends on knowing more than the opposition, monopolizinginformation along with territory, hoarding signals. Entropy, in a word. Scienceis based on transmitting the signal accurately, accelerating the process ofinformation transfer. Negentropy. The final war may be between Pavlov’s Dog andSchrödinger’s Cat.However, I am profoundly suspicious about all conspiracy theories, including myown, because conspiracy buffs tend to forget the difference between a plausibleargument and a real proof. Or between a legal proof, a proof in the behavioralsciences, a proof in physics, a mathematical or logical proof, or a parody ofany of the above. My advice to all is Buddha’s last words, “Doubt, and find yourown light.” Or, as Crowley wrote, “I slept with Faith and found her a corpse inthe morning. I drank and danced all night with Doubt, and found her a virgin inthe morning.” Doubt suffereth long, but is kind; doubt covereth a multitude ofsins; doubt puffeth not itself up into dogma. For now abideth doubt, hope, andcharity, these three: and the greatest of these is doubt. With doubt all thingsare possible.

Unfortunately,the mehums we placed in executive positions at the New Bavarian Conspiracy(NBC), the Conservative Bavarian Seers (CBS), and the Ancient BavarianConspiracy (ABC) are totally inept and lack all confidence in their own tasteand judgment. Since the matter of TV seemed trivial to us, we allowed them todrift and flounder in their own morass.What these dumb-dumbs did, Theo, was to abdicate all responsibility entirely.They make no decisions at all. They have turned control of the medium over to amysterious group known as the Nielsen Families.You may well ask, “Who are the Nielsen Families?”These are several thousand households selected—allegedly at random—by a pollsternamed Nielsen. What the Nielsen Families look at on the tube supposedlyrepresents the taste of the whole country (as would be the case, statistically,if they were indeed selected at random).For a long while, we were deceived along with everybody else. After all, asHenry Louis Mencken once said, “Nobody has ever gone broke by underestimatingthe intelligence of the American people.” But then, with the sinister increasein shows like Laveme and Shirley and Tic Tac Dough, we began to wonder. Weconducted our own secret investigation.What we found, Theo, was that the Nielsen Families were not selected at random.Our old antagonist, Mr. Markoff Chaney, had gained access to the Nielsen Corp.headquarters at night, reprogrammed the computer entirely, and selected his owncandidates for the Nielsen Families.Chaney, if you haven’t heard of him, is an electronics whiz with a strong grudgeagainst the establishment, based on the facts that (a) he is a genius and (b) heis three feet tall and hence regarded as “cute” by the normal-sized majority.What Chaney did was to select only the following groups to be part of theNielsen sample of American taste.1. Descendants of the famous Juke family, dull-average morons studied in apioneering genetic survey of the last century. Chaney found every surviving Jukein the United States, and included them in the Nielsen group.2. Descendants of the Kallikak family, imbeciles who were the subject of afamous Supreme Court case over fifty years ago.3. Descendants of the Snopes family of Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, a clanrenowned for bestiality, idiocy, and greed.That’s all there was to it, Theo. The Nielsen people never discovered how theircomputer had been snafued. The TV execs have never had the courage to offeranything not immediately pleasing to the Nielsen Families. And thus it has comeabout that American TV consists only of shows that are comprehensible andamusing to the idiots, morons, and imbeciles of the Juke, Kallikak, and Snopesfamilies.I know you will find this hard to believe, especially since you have more thanonce voiced your suspicion that, as you say, “a True Illuminatus is a MasterPut-on Artist.” I assure you, Markoff Chaney really exists; in fact, there areseveral novels about his exploits for sale right now.Also, Theo, if you don’t believe this explanation, how do you account for thetaste of the Nielsen Families? MORDECAI THE FOUL is High priest of the Head temple of the Bavarian Illuminati.“Since the Illuminati are all atheists,” he says, “I don’t have many priestlyduties to perform—except a Black Mass now and then—so I spend most of my timehanging around Washington and Wall Street, getting to know the TrilateralCommission people and planting evidence, here and there, that we in theIlluminati are still running the world. The gang who really run the world pay mefor it, you see, because as long as people blame us for what’s going on the realconspirators are safe. Actually, we Illuminatuses gave up politics long ago andnow devote ourselves to Cabala and quantum physics. You won’t tell Mae Brussell,will you?” Mordecai is suspected by many of being a shameless Put-On Artist.THEOPHOBIA THE ELDER is an imaginary being created by Mordecai the Foul. Sincehe is fairly bright, Theophobia has figured this out and knows he has no realexistence aside from the mind of Mordecai. Nonetheless, he still relapses intotaking himself seriously on occasion. images [images/eye.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"TEN GOOD REASONS TO GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING [Contents.html#tch16]This is for all you people who lie in bed every morning and wonder if it’s goingto be worth the trouble to get up. So the job is a drag, your friends let youdown, and the price of coffee is outrageous. Listen to me. I have survived twobouts of polio. One of my daughters was gang-raped by three hoods in 1971;another, my youngest, was brutally murdered in 1976. Yet, to quote Faulkner’sNobel Prize address, I still “decline to accept the end of man.” I firmlybelieve that we are entering an age that will make the Renaissance look like atempest in a teapot, and that each of us can play a role in turning man intosuperman.An old Sufi legend: The venerable sage Mullah Nasrudin was once condemned todeath for certain witty and satirical sayings that disturbed the local Shah.Nasrudin immediately offered a bargain: “Postpone the execution one year,” heimplored the Shah, “and I will teach your horse to fly.” Intrigued by this, theShah agreed.One day thereafter, a friend asked Nasrudin if he really expected to escapedeath by this maneuver.“Why not?” answered the divine Mullah. “A lot can happen in a year. There mightbe a revolution and a new government. There might be a foreign invasion and we’dall be living under a new Shah. Then again, the present Shah might die ofnatural causes, or somebody in the palace might poison him. As you know, it istraditional for a new Shah to pardon all condemned criminals awaiting executionwhen he takes the throne. Besides that, during the year my captors will havemany opportunities for carelessness and I will always be looking for anopportunity to escape.“And, finally,” Nasrudin concluded, “if the worst comes to the worst, maybe Ican teach that damned horse to fly!”Nasrudin was expressing the key element in the Sufi view of the world, whichholds that each man and woman is an incarnate part of God, with infinite chancesto improve his or her circumstances and likewise to improve the world. “Maybethe damned horse can fly” is a Sufi proverb, indicating that it is alwayspremature to abandon hope.We live in an age when despair is fashionable, even chic; when humanself-contempt has reached heights not known since the Dark Ages; and when it isconsidered naive to believe that anything good can ever be accomplished. This ispartly due to the trauma of the Vietnam war, in which many learned for the firsttime that Americans can be as beastly as Germans; partly due to the Nixoncounterrevolution, in which the optimism and utopianism of the Sixties wereclubbed to death; and partly due to the exposure of Nixon and his cronies, whichmade millions of previously trusting mainstream Americans aware that theirhighest officials can be liars, thieves, and worse. We have lived through theslaughter of innocence and, like embittered adolescents encountering theharshness of life for the first time, we are afraid to trust again or toentertain hope.I believe that I have as good reasons as anyone to be depressed. Besides mypersonal misfortunes, I have been visiting prisons for three years now, and Iknow the horrors of what our society looks like from the very bottom, from theblack holes of isolation cells where men are chained like beasts. Twenty yearsago, I worked as an ambulance attendant in Harlem, and I saw what poverty andracism can do at their worst. Nobody needs to teach me anything about theinhumanity of humanity. Yet I still believe that there is, as the Sufis say, adivinity within each person that can be released if love and faith and optimismcan be released.In that spirit I offer the following ten reasons for hope.One. Consider for a moment the implications of what sociologists call theself-fulfilling prophecy. Samply stated, this means that if you are sure a womanwill reject you, you won’t make a pass at her. If you believe you can’t pass theexamination, you will not bother to study. If you think you can’t get the job,you won’t go for the interview. As a result, the lady will bed down withsomebody else, the exam will be passed by those who did study, and the job willgo to one of the guys who made an effort to get it.The outstanding example of the negative self-fulfilling prophecy in our centuryis Joseph Stalin, who always believed himself surrounded by enemies. His ownparty, he suspected, was permeated by deviationists who hated him. He steadilyincreased the size and powers of the secret police, and each chief of the secretpolice, in turn, was executed as one of the plotters against him. They allsigned confessions before they died; Stalin insisted on that. He wanted it inblack and white, proof that his suspicions were justified. Eventually, itappears, his closest associates conspired to poison him.Stalin’s paranoia was a self-fulfilling prophecy; so was Bucky Fuller’soptimism.In contrast, there is the case of R. Buck-minster Fuller, who stood one day in1928 on the shore of Lake Michigan contemplating suicide. He was despairingbecause of his daughter’s death by polio and his own lack of financial successas a construction engineer. But, in a moment of Sufi insight, Fuller decided togamble that the universe had some use for him. Today, he is not only one of themost influential scientists in the world, the inventor of a new system ofmathematics and a universally respected philosopher and poet, he is also amultimillionaire. He is one of the most radiantly optimistic men on this planet,as everybody who has ever heard him lecture will appreciate.Stalin’s paranoia was self-fulfilling; Bucky Fuller’s gambler’s optimism wasalso self-fulfilling.Now, let’s not confuse self-fulfilling prophecy with the puerilities of positivethinking or other Pollyanna philosophies that ignore reality totally in favor ofa cocoon of self-delusion. Bucky Fuller, for instance, has had his share of hardtimes since his act of faith in 1928. His dymaxion automobile cracked up on atrial run and was never mass-manufactured. His most important scientific ideaswere ignored for nearly two decades during which he was dismissed as a brilliantcrank. He has experienced the usual human bereavements. Nevertheless, hetranscended all such setbacks by believing that he could do something good inthis universe.Two. There is evidence to suggest that our situation is every bit as hopeful asit is desperate. As Alvin Toffler noted in his famous book Future Shock, thereare more scientists alive and working today than in all previous historycombined, and this means that we will see more changes in the next two decadesthan in any 1,000 years of the past. These changes need not be for the worse. Ifscience gave us the atomic bombs that demolished Hiroshima and Nagasaki, sciencehas also, for example, practically abolished smallpox in just ten years. WorldHealth Organization figures are: in 1967, total reported smallpox victims onearth, 2,500,000; in 1976, total smallpox victims, less than 40 (and those wereconfined to Somalia).Societies, like individuals, are subject to the self-fulfilling prophecy. If webelieve that science will produce nothing but worse Hiroshimas, then that islikely to happen. If we believe that science can conquer every disease, as ithas vanquished smallpox, then that is also likely to happen. After all, we putour money and our energy where our beliefs lead us.1967: total smallpox victims, 2,500,000.1976: total smallpox victims, 40.Biologist Dr. W. H. Thorpe, of Cambridge University, speaks for the majority ofinformed scientists when he says that the breakthroughs of the next generationwill “rank in importance as high as, if not higher than, the discovery of fire,of agriculture, the development of printing, and the discovery of the wheel.”Our situation is in fact bluntly stated in the title of one of Fuller’s books,Utopia or Oblivion. What we need to realize is that utopia is just as likely asoblivion. It all depends on where we put our energy, our money, our beliefs, andour efforts.For instance, Fuller once took the living standard of the top 1 per cent of theUS population in 1900 as a base definition of affluence and calculated how manyAmericans are now affluent by that standard. The answer is over 60 per cent. Thetrend curve is to reach 100 per cent by around the year 2000. Despite thegloom-and-doom mongers, there is no reason why this cannot happen, althoughpessimism is certainly one of the factors that might indeed prevent it fromhappening. The abolition of poverty in the rest of the world could follow soonafter, according to Fuller’s trend curves.Three. The actual energy problem of this planet is not nearly so bad as theprophets of apocalypse would have us believe. Using the most sophisticatedmodern computer-projection techniques, physicist Dr. J. Peter Vajk studied allthe relevant technological and economic trends, and reveals in TechnologicalForecasting and Social Change that we can easily obtain all the electricalenergy we will need by the year 2000 simply by using solar power. He urges theconstruction of the L5 space colonies designed by Professor Gerard O’Neill andhis group at Princeton.O’Neill’s space habitats will not take much from the Earth in the way ofresources, since 98 per cent of the materials needed can be extracted from theMoon. No new technology is needed for these space cities; we can start buildingthem today with the hardware we already possess. And, according to Dr. Vajk’scomputer projections, the solar energy these L5 cities and towns can beam backto Earth will meet the energy needs of both the advanced nations and thebackward nations, even allowing the most underdeveloped lands to reach paritywith the US early in the next century. As many historians have noted, theprincipal cause of war has always been economic competition for the limitedresources of this planet. Once we begin tapping the unlimited resources of outerspace, there is reason to think that pragmatic alternatives to this bloodycompetition can be found.Four. None of these future possibilities is reserved for the unborn. There areexcellent reasons to believe that all the life-expectancy tables used byinsurance companies are already obsolete. You will probably live a lot longerthan you expect.In the very first article that I wrote on life extension (San Francisco Phoenix,1973), I quoted the latest estimate of Dr. Johan Bjorksten, who spoke at thetime of extending human lifespan to 140 years. This year, Dr. Bjorksten predictsthat humans will soon be able to live 800 years. Paul Segall, of the Universityof California at Berkeley, who has experimentally stopped the aging process inlaboratory animals, hopes that his work will extend the human lifespan to 400 or500 years before 1990. Dr. Robert Phedra puts the number even higher; he saysthat we can begin aiming to extend human lifespan to 1,000 years.You will probably live a lot longer than you expect.Look at it this way: life expectancy in Shakespeare’s day was about 30 years.(That’s why Shakespeare wrote of himself so often as aging and declining insonnets written when he was only in his early 30s.) In England, 100 years ago,life expectancy was still less than 40 years among members of the working class.It was 60 around the turn of the century in this country. It is now 72. Even ifBjorksten, Segall, Phedra, and the hundreds of other longevity researchers areoverly optimistic, even if we can raise lifespan only 50 per cent in thisgeneration, that still means that you will probably live at least 30 years pastthe projected 72.In the meantime, the research continues. Within even a 30-year bonus of extrayears, the leap into the hundreds of years is likely to occur. For instance, ifyou are in your 20s now, you expect to die around 2030. Add 30 years to that,and you will live to 2060. How many more years will science be able to give youby then? Even assuming that those researchers currently speaking of lifeextensions of hundreds of years are doing so too soon, in 2060 an increase of100 years will be a conservative projection. So you can live on to 2160. Andwhere will the life-extension sciences be by then?Five. The abovementioned research next opens up the most momentous possibilityin the history of evolution on this planet: the chance of real physicalimmortality. By the gradual increment of life-extension breakthroughs we havebeen discussing, it is thinkable that some people alive today will never die. Weare the first generation in history to have immortality as a scientific, notmetaphysical, possibility. Every decade you survive increases the chances thatyou will live until the crossover point where longevity blends into immortality.In Osborn Segerberg, Jr.’s The Immortality Factor, some recent estimates of thatcrossover point are quoted. Arthur Clarke, in 1961, set the point late in the21st century. A poll of 82 life-extension researchers in 1964 showed growingoptimism and a prediction that chemical control of aging would be achieved byearly in the 21st century. Another poll in 1969 found a spectrum of predictionsranging from 2017 (the highest estimate) to 1993 (the lowest). As Dr. TimothyLeary points out in Terra II, the largest amount of research with the mostencouraging results has taken place since that poll.In 1976, F. M. Esfandiary predicted the crossover to longevity would happen by2000. In 1980, Dr. Alvin Silverstein predicted it by 1990.Many interested citizens, following the lead of physicist R. C. W. Ettinger, whowrote The Prospect of Immortality back in 1964, have formed cryonics societiesto freeze their bodies at clinical death, in the belief that future science willbe able to revive them and give them a second chance. Although this method ofpreserving the body is available now only to the affluent, many believe thatcryonic preservation of the brain, which costs as little as a few hundreddollars per year, gives an equally good chance of a person’s revival—throughcloning.Six. All the possibilities we are discussing here—the abolition of poverty, theeconomy of abundance for all, the end of territorial competition for limitedresources leading to the warfare cycle, the achievement of longevity andeventual immortality—all these are appreciably increased by the appearance of atotally new phenomenon in human life; indeed, a phenomenon so new we hardly havea name for it. Dr. Leary uses the symbol I2 (intelligence squared) to representthis new evolutionary factor; it stands for intelligence studying intelligence,the nervous system studying the nervous system. Dr. John Lilly refers to it asthe self-metaprogrammer, the human brain feeding back self-change directions tothe human brain scientifically. In simple language, man is graduating from beingthe conditioned animal in the behaviorist cage to becoming whatever he wills tobecome.Part of this mutation will result from drugs similar to, but more specific than,the notorious Sixties psychedelics. Some of the change will come as a result ofbiofeedback training. Researchers have already taught their subjects how toachieve yogic bliss-outs in weeks instead of the years of training required byordinary yoga. Some have learned voluntary control over emotional-physicalstates of many sorts, including blood pressure and the erection of the penis;others have been able to increase their ESP and other psychic abilities.Electrical brain stimulation opens other doors to self-metaprogramming. Newdrugs are predicted that will allow us to foster or terminate emotional statesof many kinds. Like the incremental advance from longevity to immortality, thisopens a whole new ball game. As Leary points out, “The more conscious andintelligent you become, the more you want to become even more conscious andintelligent.” Until now, we have never come close to understanding theself-teaching capabilities of the human brain. It is possible, and not unlikely,that even such geniuses as Da Vinci, Beethoven, or Einstein are only partialforeshadowings of what the turned-on brain can do.Even such geniuses as Da Vinci, Beethoven, Einstein are partial foreshadowingsof what we may become.Seven. We are on the edge of abolishing toil and drudgery—work, in the ordinarysense of that word. As Aristotle pointed out, cynically but accurately, 2,500years ago, “There is only one condition in which we can imagine managers notneeding subordinates and masters not needing slaves. This condition would bethat each instrument could do its own work, as in a shuttle weaving of itself.”Such a totally automated society has been coming closer for nearly three decadesnow; the inventor of cybernetics, Professor Norbert Wiener, foresaw it as earlyas 1948.Fuller, Howard Scott, Dr. L. Wayne Benner, and dozens of other technologistshave pointed out that the only reason such total automation does not exist yetis misguided ideology, not lack of hardware. Politicians, for instance, arealways promising a cure for unemployment, as if unemployment were a diseaseinstead of the natural condition of any advanced technological society. AsFuller points out, if we count energy in Aristotle’s slave units (the amount ofwork one enslaved human can do in one day), then the average American owns 300mechanical slaves in the form of machines servicing her needs.We do not take the logical and practical next step of automating everything thatcan be automated only because we are blocked by traditional habits of thought.These habits cannot survive oncoming abundance, oncoming longevity, and oncomingneurological freedom. We go on squandering the most precious resource wehave—human brains—by condemning people to pointless jobs that are increasinglyunnecessary and that are maintained only by labor unions fearful of lower wages.When we fully accept unemployment as the cure, not the disease, we will findthat there are dozens of ways, outside the traditional wage system, todistribute abundance equitably: cybernation plus space colonization plus Leary’sI2 will create an abundance that will make poverty as obsolete in 2001 assmallpox is now.We need to remember that about 97 per cent of all humanity’s art, science,culture, and philosophy has come from economically secure aristocraciessupported by human slaves. When all humanity becomes an economically securearistocracy supported by mechanical slaves, Aristotle’s imagined utopia will bepractical. Immeasurable intelligence will be released to seek goals even beyondimmortality, perhaps beyond spacetime as we know it.Eight. All that we have been discussing is only the tip of the iceberg, thevisible part of the possible future. We are actually undergoing a greaterphilosophical revolution than those associated with Copernicus, Darwin, andEinstein. Our whole world view is literally mutating to a new level ofawareness.Cleve Backster, Marcel Vogel, and dozens of plant researchers claim to be ableto communicate with vegetative intelligence. Dr. Jacques Vallee, cyberneticist,asserts that, in addition to tens of thousands of laypersons who claim contactwith extraterrestrials, there are more than 100 trained scientists in the USalone who have had that experience. Dr. Jack Sarfatti, who is one of the 100 andwho has come out of the closet about it, says that the entities may beextraterrestrials or time travelers or something for which science has yet nolabel.The majority of advanced races in this galaxy may already have immortality.This revolution can’t be defined in ordinary terms, either scientific orspiritual. Our whole understanding of science and faith is being radicallymutated. Just this year, Dr. Ronald Bracewell, professor of engineering andastronomy at Stanford, and Dr. Frank Drake, astronomer at Cornell, announcedtheir belief that “we’ll learn the secret of longevity from space aliens who aretrying to communicate with us right now.” These are distinguished men who arecareful of their reputations. Dr. Drake later wrote in the prestigiousTechnology Review of M.I.T. that he now believes the majority of advanced racesin this galaxy have immortality.Nine. The worse our present crises become, the more the pressure increases on usall to find real solutions. We stand at the pivot of human evolution. We nowhave the technology to blow ourselves up 1,700 times over, thus rendering theplanet absolutely sterile, destroying flowers and fish and birds and everythingelse in a blaze of planetary madness. We also have, or are rapidly developing,the technology for all the once-utopian scenarios discussed here. A worldwithout poverty. Without national rivalries and wars. Without emotional twistingand vast waste of intelligence. A world of immortals who can explore allspacetime and who can contact more advanced immortals.The more real this paradox becomes to each of us, the greater the pressure totranscend. Every decade is important now: we can choose utopia or oblivion bymeans of only a few decisions. We cannot evade or escape for much longer. Wehave to take responsibility and stop laying it all on the other guy. We arebeing forced to understand John Donne’s deathless metaphor: “Never send to knowfor whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.”Ten. If no decisions are unimportant anymore, no individuals are unimportantanymore. Plutonium, the most explosive element known to man, is missing andnobody knows who has it. A jolly group calling itself The National Committee toOverthrow the Government Next Tuesday After Lunch has been anonymouslycirculating schematic diagrams on how to construct a homemade atomic bomb.Terrorism escalates everywhere, along with nuclear proliferation. One Olympicathlete said recently, “We’ll soon be having the games in catacombs, like earlyChristians.” Nobody is safe: remember what happened to the Hearst family. AsLeary has been saying for ten years, “We can no longer afford to have anyone onthis planet being oppressed, or even thinking he or she is oppressed.” Fuller’sutopia or oblivion is really the only choice left.“Captain Crunch” (aka John Draper) is the famous phone freak who so long amusedhimself and his admirers by defrauding the phone company. After his recenttrial, he revealed that he has found ways to tap the allegedly invulnerablewires of the FBI, CIA, White House, Pentagon, and the US Army, and even how toactivate computers to change bank records or fire missiles to start World WarThree. According to the San Jose Mercury, for revealing all this to thegovernment and for showing them how to install new fail-safes, Crunch had hissentence cut from four years to three months. But Crunch also says that otherelectronics experts eventually can get by his fail-safes, maybe by next Tuesdayafter lunch.Nobody is unimportant anymore.There we have it, the final reason to get your ass out of bed: we need you. Weneed you on our side—the side of hope and action—and we need you now. Everydecade is a scientific milestone, which means that every year counts as well,and every month, every week, every day. Indeed, at this point, every act of ourlives is either a step toward the achievement of all our visions of glory or astep back toward the stupidity and self-pity that can destroy us. Nobody reallyneeds LSD to see the cosmic importance of every minute.Any single act of love and hope may be the grain that tips the scale towardsurvival and, conversely, any single act of cruelty or injustice may be thegrain that tips the scale the other way.As Kurt Vonnegut says, “A great swindle of our time is the assumption thatscience has made religion obsolete. All science has damaged is the story of Adamand Eve and the story of Jonah and the whale.” Vonnegut goes on to say thatthere is nothing in science that contradicts the works of mercy recommended bySaint Thomas Aquinas, which include: to teach the ignorant, to console the sad,to bear with the oppressive and troublesome, to feed the hungry, to shelter thehomeless, to visit prisoners and the sick, and to pray for us all.If we can see and act on the wisdom of those suggestions, we can greet life withthe bravery and joy it deserves.

Beethoven as the bard of the recalcitrantindividualist is the Homer of music: the “hero,” not just of the Third Symphonybut of all his works, is really Odysseus, “cunning in stratagems,” of whom Zeussaid, “Why, with a mind like that he is almost one of us gods!” Such individualsdo not arise in pre-Homeric cultures, and are not allowed in Marxist cultures:they are distinctly and distinctively the heirs of Greek truculence.images [images/chap20_ufig_01.jpg]John Fowles has claimed, in a dramatic context, that eleutheria is “the mostGreek of all words.” Eleutheria means freedom, which is what Beethoven’s musicis all about.Artistic freedom, of course, is what Beethoven’s life was “all about,” theconstant struggle to push beyond all the limits of music and forge more meaningand more complexity of vision than sound had ever before carried. But theartist, as Joyce has dramatically demonstrated in Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, isfighting the struggle which every human must fight if We are not to relapse intototal robotry: the struggle to see and hear with one’s own eyes and ears, notwith the circuitry of social conditioning. Beethoven is one man, and struggles,suffers, and triumphs as one, but he speaks for all who are in any degreeconscious of their potential individuality.“Anyone who understands my music will never be unhappy again,” Ludwig is allegedto have said. Some biographers doubt the source from which we get this; but itdoesn’t matter. If he didn’t say it, he might as well have; the music certainlysays it for him. It is the music of a stubborn individual who is willing tosuffer anything, pay any price asked, to achieve greater organic vision than hasexisted in the world before him.To be blunt about it, what went on inside Beethoven’s head was more important,in the long run, than everything going on outside that head in those years. Hismusic proves it; and that is what the Marxist cannot tolerate about him: thatone man should believe himself so important, and what’s worse, that he shoulddemonstrate that he was so important.J. W. N. Sullivan, a mathematician and therefore accustomed to precision,defined in one word the deepest response we all have to Ludwig: “reverence.” Butit is reverence primarily for Ludwig’s mind, which could contain so much in suchsweet precision, and then for Mind in general, of which he was only one human orsuperhuman transceiver.Maynard Solomon has described the typical Beethoven structure as combining“irresistible motion and intolerable strain.” But that is the formula for allcreativity (it could even describe orgasm or childbirth); and it is also theformula of Illumination, of which the Sufis assure us there are three stages,which any listener can hear in the late Beethoven compositions:1. Lord, use me.2. Lord, use me but don’t break me.3. Lord, I don’t care if you break me.It is hackneyed, of course, to describe the Fifth as a meditation on Fate;Ludwig started that line of interpretation himself, saying the opening themerepresents “Fate knocking at the door.” Sullivan was hardly exaggerating when hesaid the major resolution of the theme is Beethoven “taking Fate by the throat.”Sullivan may or may not be right in his further scanning that Fate chieflyrepresents Beethoven’s growing deafness and the triumphant finale (so bitterlyattained) symbolizes Ludwig’s realization that he could still compose even whenhe could no longer hear. It is more likely that the Fifth summarizes everythingBeethoven knew about all his struggles, including but not limited to the socialproblems and artistic fears when the deafness was recognized as incurable andprogressive; that is why it reflects all my struggles and yours, all the battleswe have won and all we have lost, and what we learned in winning and losing.Nobody but Shakespeare or a damned fool would make an iambic pentameter line outof “never” repeated five times; but Shakespeare does it, and where and when hedoes it, he produces one of his most powerful tragic effects. And nobody butBeethoven or a damned fool would represent the unity of thesis and antithesis(or the individual Will and implacable Fate) by progressing from the third tothe fourth movement without the traditional pause; but Beethoven does it andmakes it work. Genius is the capacity to conceive the inconceivable, as Alekhinecheckmates with a pawn, while his opponent and every witness was wondering whathis knights or queen might be about to do.There is one moment in literature that is like the end of the Fifth. It is atthe climax of Moby Dick, when Ahab finally realizes that it was, indeed, “God’swill” that the whale should attack its attackers, but that also, in that cosmiccontext, it must be “God’s will” also that he cannot rest until he fights thewhale again. “I am the Fates’ Lieutenant,” Ahab says, and that is what Beethovenhad learned in all his struggles against Fate. “I am that which was, and is, andshall be,” a quote from an Egyptian prayer, in hieroglyphic and in his ownhandwriting, was kept under glass on the desk where he composed the late works.Perhaps some mystics have achieved higher levels of consciousness than Beethoven(perhaps!), but if so, we cannot know of it. Aleister Crowley once astonished meby writing that the artist is greater than the mystic, an odd remark from a manwho was only a mediocre artist himself (although a great mystic). Listening toLudwig, I have come to understand what Crowley meant. The mystic, unless he orshe is also an artist, cannot communicate the higher states of awarenessachieved by the fully turned-on brain; but the great artist can. Listening toBeethoven, one shares, somewhat, in his expanded perceptions; and the more onelistens, the more one shares. Finally, one is able to believe his promise: ifone listens to that music enough, one will never again be unhappy.Ludwig himself? He ended his days as a (relatively) poor, distinctly shabby oldman; deaf and lonely; shuffling around Vienna “humming and howling” in anoff-key voice as he constructed the music he couldn’t hear; furtively sneakingoff to brothels because he had accepted, finally, that the Romantic Love heyearned for was not part of his Fate. Some of his neighbors said he was crazy.But what was going on in his head was the creation of the Ninth Symphony, theMissa Solemnis, and the late quartets, the greatest artistic expressions in allhistory of the DNA script of evolution from unicellular dance to the strugglesand sufferings of complex organisms to the extraterrestrial perspective of theCosmic Immortals we are becoming. Beethoven said “Anyone who understands my music will never be unhappy again.”The mystic cannot communicate, but the artist can. FUSTIN CASE is music critic for Confrontation magazine and won the CongressionalMedal of Honor for bravery while serving with the US Army in Vietnam. He prefershis Martinis with vodka instead of gin, hasn’t voted since 1972 (“It onlyencourages them”), and says that anybody who prefers Bach to Beethoven shouldhave their head candled. Mr. Case informs us that he vigorously disapproves ofWagner, Brahms, Democrats, Rock, Soul, Republicans, the Ayatollah Khomeini, andpeople who put sugar on grapefruit, in approximately that order.

Beethoven had arrived in Vienna with a letter of introduction fromthe head of the Illuminati lodge in Bonn, Herr Neefe; the Freemasonic lodges inVienna were all, according to Robison, under Illuminati influence.These bits of evidence are, as we admitted, circumstantial. The real proof is inthe Ninth Symphony, for those who can hear it, and who can understand why thejoyous finale is both a political and a mystical statement.__________* For Mozart, see Will Durant, Rousseau and Revolution, page 408.

Are you a long-time science-fiction/fantasy fan? Aneopagan or occultist?Wilson: My style derives directly from Ezra Pound, James Joyce, RaymondChandler, H. L. Mencken, William S. Burroughs, Benjamin Tucker, and ElephantDoody Comix, in approximately that order of importance. Chandler has alsoinfluenced my way of telling stories; all my fiction tends to follow theChandler mythos of the skeptical Knight seeking Truth in a world of false frontsand manipulated deceptions. (Of course, this is also my biography, or that ofany shaman.) The writers who have most influenced my philosophy are AleisterCrowley, Timothy Leary, Alfred Korzybski, and Karl R. Popper. Korzybski andPopper (and a few logical positivists) are absolutely necessary forepistemological clarity, especially when you get to the growing edge of science,where the hot debates are going on, and even more if you wander into the occult.Sci-fi and fantasy are my favorite forms of fiction; I think the so-called“naturalists” and “social realists” have committed high treason against humanityby selling their gloomy perspective as the “real” reality. A book that lacks theelement of heroism is a crime against the young and impressionable, in myopinion. A book full of anger and self-pity is another crime. Needless to say,as a libertarian I don’t mean literally that these are crimes to be punished incourt. The only final answer to a bad, sad book is to write a good, funny book.(I love debate and hate censorship. Accuracy of signal and free flow ofinformation define sanity in my epistemology. I should have included NorbertWiener among the primary influences on my thinking.)As for neopaganism and the occult: I’m an initiated witch, an ordained ministerin four churches (or cults), and have various other “credentials” to impress thegullible. My philosophy remains Transcendental Agnosticism. There are realitiesand intelligences greater than conditioned normal consciousness recognizes, butit is premature to dogmatize about them at this primitive stage of ourevolution. We’ve hardly begun to crawl off the surface of the cradle-planet.The most advanced shamanic techniques—such as Tibetan Tantra or Crowley’s systemin the west—work by alternating faith and skepticism until you get beyond theordinary limits of both. With such systems, one learns how arbitrary are thereality maps that can be coded into laryngeal grunts by hominids or visualizedby a mammalian nervous system. We can’t even visualize the size of the localgalaxy except in special high states. Most people are trapped in one staticreality map imprinted on their neurons when they were naive children, as Dr.Leary keeps reminding us. Alas, most so-called “adepts” or “gurus” are similarlytrapped in the first postrapture reality map imprinted after their initialIllumination, as Leary also realizes. The point of systems like Tantra,Crowleyanity, and Leary’s Neurologic is to detach from all maps—which gives youthe freedom to use any map where it works and drop it where it doesn’t work. AsDogen Zenji said, “Time is three eyes and eight elbows.”SFR: Would I be right in saying you probably lean more toward the rightwing formof anarchism than the classical leftist variety?Wilson: My trajectory is perpendicular to the left-right axis of terrestrialpolitics. I put some of my deepest idealism into both the Left anarchism ofSimon Moon and the Right anarchism of Hagbard Celine in Illuminatus!, but I amdetached from both on another level.Politics consists of demands, disguised or rationalized by dubious philosophy(ideologies). The disguise is an absurdity and should be removed. Make yourdemands explicit. My emphasis is on whatever will make extraterrestrialmigration possible in this generation. The bureaucratic state, whether American,Russian, or Chinese, has all the clout on this planet for the foreseeablefuture. The individualist must fulfil his or her genetic predisposition to be apioneer, and the only way one can do that today is by moving into space fasterthan anyone else. I think the maverick Seed is included in the DNA scenario toserve that function in each epoch. I’m leaving Earth for the same reason myancestors left Europe: freedom is found on the expanding, pioneering perimeter,never inside the centralized state. To quote another Zen koan, “Where is theTao?” “Move on!”SFR: You’re involved in an organization called the DNA Society which isinterested in biological engineering and immortality, the creation andexploitation of higher forms of consciousness. How serious are you about this?How close are we to achieving this on a broad scale?Wilson: Let me refer the reader to The Prospect of Immortality and Man intoSuperman by Ettinger, The Biological Time Bomb by Taylor, The Immortality Factorby Seger-berg, Terra II by Dr. Leary and Wayne Benner, and the writings of JohnLilly and Buckminster Fuller.With that documentation, I assert that the basic longevity breakthrough willoccur before 1990. Segall, Bjorksten, or Froimovich, among others, may be veryclose to it already. The basic principles of reimprinting or metaprogramming thenervous system, as discovered by Leary and Lilly, will be accepted and used indaily practice by around 1985. A neurogenetic quantum jump in life expectancy,intellectual efficiency, and emotional equilibrium (or, as Leary calls it,hedonic engineering) will be revolutionizing human life before the twenty-firstcentury. Some of us will be alive when the Immortality Pill is found.Interview with Robert Anton Wilson copyright © 1976 Richard E.

These nosegays offlattery are almost certainly hypocritical, and merely indicate that theIlliterati are afraid to denounce Kubrick at this stage of his career. Afterall, they mostly rejected 2001 and Clockwork Orange, and some of them evendowned Strangelove; and, despite their carping, all three of those films went onto become box-office dynamite, and got elevated to High Art by the moreprestigious critics on the slick quarterlies.Afraid to denounce Barry Lyndon, the Illiterati have instead praised it for allthe wrong reasons. It is “beautiful,” they say, it is “sumptuous”; it is even“gorgeous”; one would think they were reviewing a three-hour painting by Monet.Barry Lyndon indeed swarms and bulges with exuberant, almost baroque loveliness,both visually and aurally. (Kubrick has drenched it in even more first-ratemusic than Clockwork Orange, and with more ironic effect.) But the overwhelmingtone of the film is not beautiful but tragic, mordant, even moralistic. It isprimarily a study in what Dr. Timothy Leary calls “mammalian politics,” the mostprimitive circuits in the human nervous system, concerned with power, status,and emotional game-playing. In ethological language, the subject is territorialbehavior among a domesticated primate species.Barry Lyndon is a precise neurological dissection of the robot imprints thatunderlie predatory politics.The dominant image of the film is the duel. The opening sequence is a pistolduel, which kills the hero’s father and reduces the family to poverty. Thedramatic pivot of the opening third is a second pistol duel, which sends Barryinto exile. And the climax of the entire film is another pistol duel, one of themost shattering and emotion-churning sequences Kubrick has ever given us.Other forms of the duel recur emblematically throughout. Card games, usuallydishonest, play a repetitious role in the protagonist’s rise from Redmond Barry,impoverished exile, to Barry Lyndon, rich nobleman. Duels with the sword becomehis method of collecting bad gambling debts. To capture the beautiful woman hewants (for her money and status), Barry must first duel psychologically with herinconvenient husband; when the husband is done in and the lady captured, asecond emotional duel, with her son, dominates the second half of the film andescalates with slow deadliness to the final pistol duel.In all of these second-circuit contests (as Leary would call them), the motivesare the classic mammalian drives: passion, status, territory (property). Barryis simply another primate, struggling to achieve the one-up position in atypical hominid tribe. Everybody else is struggling also for a one-up position,and each of these higher vertebrates accordingly is simultaneously pushing everyother vertebrate one-down. These violent struggles (always inflated by mammalianheroic passions and the mysterious primate sense of “honor”) eventually resolveinto grubby hustling for money. This is one of Kubrick’s prime ironies, but notreally either an advance upon or a perversion from mammalian norms. Recentresearch shows that even chimpanzees can learn to compete for money. Cash is, asethologists know, symbolic territory.The naturalistic view of humanity has always been a Kubrick specialty, mostnotably in the grim parallels between the australopithecines and the astronautsin 2001. Even in Spartacus, burdened by a typically romantic Dalton Trumboscript, Kubrick’s Darwinian irony appeared in the cross-cuts between the Romanand slave armies, in which the totems of both the reactionary and therevolutionary forces were suspiciously tribalistic. The Killing, Kubrick’s earlyheist film, portrays cops and crooks as rival predator bands. You can’t forget,in watching Kubrick, that few of our ancestors were ladies and gentlemen; themajority of them, indeed, didn’t achieve the status of mammalhood, and had themorals and courtesy of Gila monsters.But Barry Lyndon is as much Thackeray’s work as Kubrick’s—Thackeray, the leastpraised and (one suspects) least read of the great Victorians. Nobody is betterqualified to resurrect William Makepeace Thackeray than Stanley Kubrick: the twofit each other as snugly as a key in a lock. I once claimed that Joyce inventedthe “alienation effect” before Brecht; but Thackeray had it even before Joyce.Both Barry Lyndon and Vanity Fair are classic examples of Brechtian-Joyceanartistic judo, constantly moving the reader into highly chargedemotional-political situations and deftly defusing audience identification atthe most crucial points.Bernard Shaw attempted something of this sort in his Saint Joan, explaining inthe preface that he was writing tragedy, not melodrama, and defining thedifference elegantly: “Melodrama deals with the conflict of good and evil,tragedy with the conflict of good and good.” Not quite; it would be better todefine tragedy as the conflict of ambiguity and ambiguity. Here Thackeray andKubrick excel and mutually reinforce each other. The magnificent, almostEuripidean complexity of the final duel in Barry Lyndon is such that, on theemotional-reflex level, one has been manipulated to sympathize with both partiesand with neither of them. The alienation effect of the multiple shocks in thatscene—the “turn of the screw,” Henry James called it—quite obliterates anyemotional identification. One can neither rejoice with the victor nor hate him;nor can one too easily pity the loser. One has been raised above the mammalianpolitics of the antagonists, cannot take sides any longer, and can only see withobjective clarity the idiocy of the whole value system that made the tragedy aspredictable as a cycle in astronomy.But one could write a symposium, rather than a single review, about thissingularly intelligent film. The handling of the Reverend Runt, for instance, isperfect Thackeray: a caricature worthy of Dickens, but so much more human andcomplex than any of Dickens’ Hypocrites. The parallels with Oedipus and Hamletare worth a whole essay in themselves (Barry Lyndon is almost Hamlet retold fromClaudius’s point of view). Enough. Barry Lyndon is beautiful, yes, but it ismuch more than that. It is a philosophical Strangelove: a precise neurologicaland ethological dissection of the robot imprints that underlie war and predatorypolitics.FUSTIN CASE is film critic for Confrontation magazine and author of the highlypraised history of cinema, From Caligari to Vlad. He has a Ph.D. from Yale and aD.D. from the US Army. Dr. Case insists that, although he has written a book, hehas never read one, since literature is obsolete. “Only the electronic media areworthy of serious consideration as synergetic cultural signals in the emergingnonlinear postindustrial omniinter-faced global village,” he told ourinterviewer, adding acidly that “the printing press is going the way of thebrontosaurus, the dodo, the eohippus and the Vatican: from archaism, toquaintness, to Camp, to extinction.” He is usually quite stoned."},{"pageContent":"Item [Contents.html#tch24] THE EIGHTBASIC WINNERSCRIPTS [Contents.html#tch24] I.

S. Eliot, Murder in the CathedralOn the morning of February 1, 1965, the temperature in Knoxville, Tennessee,fell to 15°, and a mean dose of sleet, rain, and wind began to whip the city.Southerners hate this kind of weather more than Northerners, because they areless accustomed to it. They grumble more than Northerners; they curse more;their tempers grow shorter. When the sleet began to turn to snow around noon,and the weather bureau predicted a six-inch fall, the county schools closed forthe day, and the city schools followed suit shortly, sending their pupils homeat 1:30. As stalled cars began jamming the roads, everybody resigned themselvesto a miserable day.Records show that the Knoxville police received 117 phone calls requestingassistance during the afternoon and evening: 50 of the calls concerned trafficproblems of varying degrees of severity, one of which was a seven-car collisionon Kensington Pike; 67 of the phone calls were complaints by motorists who hadbeen pelted by snow-balls by University of Tennessee students on CumberlandAvenue, a four-lane throughway which passes in the middle of the campus andjoins US Highway 11.Cumberland Avenue has a difficult hill in its 1700 block adjacent to theuniversity, and a special patrolman was sent to handle traffic problems there,but the city police took no action about the student snowballing, assuming thatthe university’s private police could handle that, as they had in the past.Subsequent investigations revealed that the campus police broke up thesnowballing at 3:45 that afternoon, but that it had resumed around 4 p.m. Thecampus police never returned to the scene, being too busy helping facultymembers navigate the hills of the campus, many of them in cars which were,Southern fashion, unequipped with snow chains. The Knoxville policeman was onthe other side of the hill from the snowballing.French Harris has been Knoxville’s Chief of Police for five years and was adetective for 19 years before that. Many people now want to blame him for whathappened that day on Cumberland Avenue, but he has been a cop too long to beoverly sensitive to criticism. A burly 50, he started as a motorcycle officer,attended the FBI National Police Academy, and worked for three years with the USNarcotics Bureau. He is popular in Knoxville and popular at the university also.Students know that he will not insist on collecting the towaway fee on anillegally parked car if the driver’s hard-luck story is convincing to him. Theygripe about the severity of his enforcement of the laws against serving liquorto minors, but about nothing else.Chief Harris has stood trial for murder twice. Each time he shot an escapingsuspect; each time he was acquitted and returned to the force. He is known forhis compassion and for his attempt to be fair within the limits of the law.“I sat on the defendant’s side of the courtroom twice,” he has said. “I knowwhat it feels like over there.”He took morphine once before going to work with the Narcotics Bureau.“I wanted to find out what an addict is looking for,” he explains. “It’s notenough to arrest a man. I want to understand him. Maybe, then, I can help him.And maybe I won’t have to arrest him again.”French Harris attended a seminar on civil rights at New York University twoyears ago, to find out what that is all about. He is a man who wants tounderstand, and to be fair.At 3:30 that afternoon a man named Roland Lawson drove through the blizzard andthe student snowball gauntlet on Cumberland Avenue. Lawson, 58, was a welder atFulton Sylphon Company in Knoxville and had left work early to have snow chainsput on his car.Roland Lawson had high blood pressure and had been warned by his doctor thatundue excitement or strain might bring on a heart attack. The students onCumberland Avenue pelted his car with snowballs as thoroughly as they pelted allthe other cars passing.Lawson drove half a block further, after passing this gauntlet, and slumpedunconscious behind his wheel. The car drove off the road into a telephone poleand came to a stop. Pedestrians called an ambulance and, a few minutes before 4p.m., Roland Law-son was declared dead of a heart attack at University Hospital.Nobody at the hospital knew about the snowball gauntlet Lawson had passed, andFrench Harris did not hear about this incident for several hours. Nor did hehear that the widow of Roland Lawson had to drive through Cumberland Avenue onher way to the hospital and that her car was also plastered with snowballs bythe students, severely angering and frightening her.And French Harris did not learn, until too late, that when Mrs. Lawson saw herhusband’s body at the hospital and learned where his heart attack had occurred,she immediately pronounced the theory which was to be carried all over thecountry by the press on the following day: Roland Lawson’s heart attack had beencaused by the student snowballing.Chief Harris did not know this theory at 4:30 p.m., when Mrs. Lawson pronouncedit. If he had heard it at the time, he might have acted sooner. If he had,Knoxville would not have found itself with two more corpses to explain.“Who is the slayer, who the slain? Speak.…”Sophocles, Oedipus RexAt 9 a.m. that morning, Frank Wasserman was awakening his roommate, MarlandGoodman, at New Melrose Hall, one of the most modern buildings in the Universityof Tennessee. Both boys were 18 and Northerners—Wasserman from Massapequa, LongIsland, and Goodman from Swam-scott, a fashionable suburb of Boston—and they hadbeen close friends ever since the Snipe Hunt.The Snipe Hunt is an old tradition at the university. The students are mostlynatives of Tennessee, but about 10 per cent of them come from out-of-state andfrom 85 foreign countries. When each new freshman class arrives, theseoutlanders hear about the wonderful Snipe Hunt.The snipe is the most delicious bird of all, they are told, even better than thepheasant, and the woods outside of Knoxville are full of them. When the night ofthe snipe hunt arrives, most of the outlanders are eager to join. The nativeslead them out into the woods and then simply lose them there.There is no such bird as the snipe. Marty Goodman and Frank Wasserman had beenamong a group of Northerners who went on a snipe hunt in September, 1964, and,lost in the dark in an unfamiliar woods 1,000 miles from home at 3 o’clock inthe morning, their status as Northern aliens had drawn them together.They had learned something about courage and humor and loneliness and eachother. We think of the snipe hunt, or the biscuit-gun which Air Force recruitsare sometimes sent to look for, or the can of striped paint which apprentices inthe building trades are asked to fetch, as mere pranks, but anthropologists callthese rites “ordeals of initiation” and say that they provide a catharsis ofshame and anxiety necessary to mark a transition from one stage of life toanother. The Snipe Hunt meant something of this sort to Wasserman and Goodman.Of the two boys, Marty Goodman was somewhat better known on the campus. Hiscollection of folk records and folk sheet-music was large, and he was anenthusiastic folk guitarist. He would sooner talk about folk music than aboutany of his college subjects.This morning, however, he was not talking about folk music, but about hisgirlfriend, Judy Goldberg, back in Boston, and complaining about how much hemissed her. Frank Wasserman remembered that afterwards.Marty Goodman also mentioned his mid-term paper for English 112. He had reallysweated over this one, and hoped to get an A. He had received two C’s and aB-minus on his previous papers in that class. Today at 3 o’clock he would getback his midterm paper and find out if he had achieved the A he aimed for. FrankWasserman remembered that later, also.At 2:15 that afternoon, Julian Harris was in his office at the university. Agangling, Lincolnesque 50, Mr. Harris is director of Public Relations for theuniversity. It’s the kind of job that keeps you awake nights. Like every othercollege town, Knoxville seethes with hostility toward the students and regardsthem as overeducated juvenile delinquents.Knoxville, also, is the South: When you enter town on Route 11 you pass a signsaying SAVE THE REPUBLIC—IMPEACH EARL WARREN! and the John Birch Society meetsin the Hotel Farragut in midtown, and you occasionally see a car still wearing asign, bitter in defeat, saying “AuH2O—64.”In such an ambience, any university must be viewed with suspicion. When ChiefHarris noted that the sleet was turning to snow, he thought at once of thestudent volunteers who help stalled motorists on Cumberland Avenue during everysnowstorm. He hoped that the students would be at that job today; it would begood for the university’s image.By 2:30 the weather was so bad that Dean of Students Charles Lewis, in hisoffice in the administration building, told his secretary to take the rest ofthe day off. Dean Lewis, a sandy-haired man of 46 addicted to dapper bow-ties,remained in his office for a conference, scheduled for 4 o’clock, with fourstudent leaders—a conference concerning the students’ objections to theuniversity’s new service fees.He intended to give them great leeway in stating their resentment, listensympathetically as long as they cared to harangue him, and not reduce the fees apenny. It would be a grueling session.Looking out his window, Dean Lewis noticed some students engaged in a harmlesssnowball fight. Smiling, he remembered the smaller snow of a week earlier andhis own surrender to temptation crossing the yard in the morning. It is a goodfeeling, even when you are 46, to pick up a handful of snow, pack it tight andhard, and hurl it at a tree. And, when you are 46, it is good to hit the tree.Dean Lewis was glad, however, that none of the students had observed hisoutburst.The students seen by Dean Lewis were not the only ones on the campus who werebeginning to succumb to the insidious temptation of the snow. Down on WestCumberland two teams had formed on opposite sides of the Avenue and werebombarding each other over the tops of the passing cars.Some, more venturesome, were beginning to pelt the cars also. This is a favoritejuvenile sport and most of us have had our cars pelted this way once or twiceevery winter. Some of us are even willing to remember having done some of thepelting when we were young.Soon over 200 students had joined in the fun. None of them noticed the effect oftheir snowballing on Roland Lawson.Further up Cumberland Avenue, on the other side of the hill, students werehelping stalled cars get started again. Julian Harris, the PR man, driving hissecretary home, noticed them, and felt a sigh of relief at the good image theywere creating for the university. He did not know about the image being createdon the other side of the hill.The Knoxville police, however, were already getting an earful of that image.J. M. Lobetti, President of the White Star Bus Lines, called the police toreport that students on West Cumberland had broken 12 windows in a stalled busat 3 p.m., forced open the door and bombarded the driver, Robert Holder, in theface.An anonymous cab driver complained of seeing a woman dragged out of her car andpulled by the heels through the snow. “Her pants must’ve gotten full of snow,”he said. “It was awful.”John Rinehart complained that his car had received a broken window, snow waspoured in “all over the front seat,” and that students had “manhandled” him whenhe opposed them.And—in another part of town—university track students snowballed a Negro driverand he went off the road into a ditch. This last case was quickly smoothed over,however. Track coach Frank Rowe was on the scene and he forced students tocontribute $50 for repairs of the vehicle and apologize to the driver.As the mean, cold snow continued to fall, the student mob on Cumberland Avenueincreased to more than 400. The air was resounding with skids, stalled motorsgroaning, drivers cursing, and the hilarious shrieking and laughing of thestudents.Patrolman Davis Gaddis, a block away over the hill, was continually approachedby motorists with complaints about the gauntlet they had run. He told them,quite correctly, that he could not leave his post, and instructed them to phonepolice headquarters.Once or twice, students ranging this far east pelted Patrolman Gaddis himself,an act perhaps profoundly symbolic.None of the students were “thinking,” of course; they were just having fun. Butthe fun, more and more, was taking on a ritual character, a character of assaultupon every manifestation of adult authority. It was inevitable that a policeman,also, would become a target. A policeman represents the most monolithic form ofauthority: the State.“For the brothers who had joined forces to kill the father had each beenanimated by the wish to become like the father and had given expression to thiswish by incorporating parts of the substitute for him in the totem feast.…”Sigmund Freud, Totem and TabooFrank Wasserman, the freshman from Massapequa, was studying in his room at 4o’clock when Marty Goodman burst in, announcing that several snowball fightswere in progress all over the campus and he wanted to get in on the action.Marty had just had a serious disappointment. Trudging almost a mile acrosscampus to Science Hall for his English 112 class, he had found a notice thatclass was canceled for that day. His teacher, Mrs. Nancy Fisher, a resident ofOakland, Tenn., had bogged down in the snow and turned back home. Marty wouldhave to wait until Wednesday to learn whether or not he had gotten the A heaimed for on his midterm paper.Frank loaned Marty a scarf, but declined to join him in the snow carnival. “Iwant to study for a while more,” he said. “I’ll be out later.”Frank Wasserman was never able to remember what he studied that afternoon. Alittle after 6, he gave up for the day and went out to look for action. He foundsome of it, immediately, at the door of Melrose Hall, where a gang of sevenpelted him with an avalanche of snowballs.Unable to hold his own against these superior numbers, Frank ran, looking forfriends. After getting around the corner, he slowed to a walk. Then, suddenly, astudent he didn’t know ran up to him and said, “You better get back to MelroseHall. They’ll be looking for you. Your roommate’s dead.”“I laughed,” Frank Wasserman said later. “I was sure it was a joke. They wantedto get me back to the Hall to make a target out of me again. I was sure of it. Isaid, ‘Come on, you’re putting me on, fellow.’ ”The other student was pale and sober. “It’s true,” he said glumly. “Marty’sdead. He just got shot on Cumberland Avenue.”Frank Wasserman suddenly felt a chill of certainty, and heard himself saying,“Really? Really?” But the other’s face had already told him.Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?Are you marked with the mark of the beast?Come down Daniel to the Lion’s denCome down Daniel and join in the feast…T. S. Eliot, Murder in the CathedralCumberland Avenue, when Marty Good-man arrived there shortly after four, wasmidway between a carnival and a nightmare. Buses, cars, and trucks werestalling, and somewhere between 400 and 500 students were raining snowballs onthe entire scene, while the wind whipped and howled and snow continued to fall.In one of the stalled trucks, William Douglas Willett, Jr., of Greenville,Tenn., fretted and fumed. He was lost. Trying to save time in the heavy snow,Willett had taken a new route through Knoxville and now he was on a street hedidn’t recognize and snowballs were going thump, thump, thump in unending hammerblows on his windshield and he was afraid the wind-shield might break at anyminute, and then, suddenly, the cab door was torn open and a dozen grinningfaces appeared looking in at him.He opened his mouth, angry and frightened, to warn them not to go too far, butbefore he could say anything they began to dump pounds of snow all over him andhis seat and he was hit in the face repeatedly and he reached in his glovecompartment and took out the pistol provided by his company.The students saw the gun and Willett made a threat—nobody ever remembered hisexact words—and somebody (Willett later said he thought it was Marty Goodman)threw snow in his face and he got out on the running board and somebody elsethrew snow in his face and then he fired the gun, twice only.For one moment, nobody moved.The echo of the shots hung in the air and all the laughing and shouting stoppedand every student held his breath to see if he was hit anywhere and then MartyGoodman crumbled and fell hard like a tree and lay still in the snow with a redstain spreading in the snow around him. The other shot had gone completely wild,but this one hit Marty Goodman in the right eye, crashed through his brain, andexited below the left ear.With a shriek the students charged Willett. According to some witnesses, as manyas 20 students landed in one pile on the truckdriver, dragging him to theground, kicking him, hitting him, screaming. A girl student screamed, “Don’tkill him—he didn’t know what he was doing!”Willett was finally released and allowed to return to his cab, and the policewere called at 5:39, one hour and nine minutes after Mrs. Lawson had made hercharge, to the hospital staff, that the students had killed her husband.Marty Goodman’s body was carried into Evan’s Sundries, a drugstore half a blockaway. He was breathing. A student named Ken Elrod, 18, from Nashville, gavemouth-to-mouth resuscitation. When the ambulance arrived and Marty Goodman waslifted for the second time, his pulse stopped. Ken Elrod rode in the ambulanceto the hospital, but he was not surprised when the doctor in the emergency room,at 6:04 p.m. pronounced Marland Joseph Goodman, 18, a boy who liked folk music,dead on arrival.“According to the law of retaliation which is deeply rooted in human feeling, amurder can be atoned only by the sacrifice of another life; the self-sacrificepoints to blood guilt. And if the sacrifice of the son brings aboutreconciliation with god, the father, then the crime which must be expiated canonly have been the murder of the father.…”Sigmund Freud, Totem and TabooThe snowballing continued, with greater frenzy. The first two policemen on thescene, Detectives Robert Chadwell and Gene Huskey, were snowballed while helpingto lift Goodman’s body into the ambulance.Chadwell sounded off to the first reporter he saw. “They have no respect for anofficer,” he said, “or for anyone else. They don’t act like students. They actlike a bunch of idiots. One of the snowballs hit me in the back of the head, andit hurt for 30 minutes or longer.”William Douglas Willett was taken to police headquarters and questioned byInspector Fred Scruggs. Willett was “crying like a baby,” Scruggs said later,and kept repeating, “I didn’t mean to do it, I didn’t mean to do it.”Scruggs learned that Willett was employed by Bird and Cutshaw Produce Company ofGreenville, Tenn., and had been driving a load of fresh-dressed poultry toCincinnati, Ohio. Examination showed that Willett had been bruised on the lefttemple, nose, and mouth by snowballs, and that his left eye was swollen.Back at the university, the snowballing was still going on. John F. Roth, awelding truck driver, called police to complain that students on CumberlandAvenue snowballed his truck, jerked open the door, and covered the front seatwith snow “with me in it.”Dean of Students Charles Lewis had finished his conference with the studentleaders about fees and was about to leave when word of the Goodman shootingreached him. He went at once to the Student Center, where there were moretelephones than in any other campus building, and began trying to handle thesituation.Dean Lewis, first of all, was concerned to authenticate the identification ofthe dead boy. Five years earlier, while he was Dean at the University of NorthDakota, a mis-identification had been made of a student killed in an autoaccident—it turned out later that the student had exchanged wallets with anotherstudent for some inexplicable student joke—and the wrong parents were notifiedthat their son was dead.Dean Lewis, therefore, began a search for someone who could positively identifythe body as Marland Joseph Goodman.Phones in the Student Center rang continually and nobody was quite sure thatWillett’s second shot hadn’t hit another student. It was chaos. Julian Harris,the PR man, could not get back to the university in the storm, but Dean Lewisdirected all reporters to Harris’ home phone number.A search of the Records Department revealed that Marland Goodman had an uncle,Prof. Fred Blumberg, on the faculty of the English Department. Dean Lewiscontacted Prof. Blumberg and told him, gently, that his nephew might be the boywho was shot. Prof. Blumberg agreed to go with Dean Lewis to the hospital toidentify the body.The drive through the increasingly furious snowstorm was painfully slow, andboth men were too emotion-torn to speak much. At the hospital, theidentification was brief.“Yes, that’s Marty,” Prof. Blumberg said, when the body was shown.“I remember that moment every day,” Dean Lewis said a month later, “and I thinkI always will, as long as I live.”The sheet was drawn back over the dead boy’s face, and the two men walkedsilently out of the hospital and back to their car to begin again the painfulfive-mile-an-hour drive through the still-falling snow.It was 8:30, and back at the university the snowballing was finally ending, butthe incident was far from over.Frank Wasserman returned late that night to the room he and Marty had shared. Helooked at Marty’s guitar, Marty’s books, Marty’s sheet music, Marty’s records,and started to get undressed for bed. He found that he couldn’t sleep in thatroom.You read about hundreds, thousands of corpses in the Congo or Vietnam or WestBerlin and it means nothing; a boy shares your room for a few months and thensuddenly he’s not there and it means something more than you can ever speak.Frank Wasserman put his clothes back on and got out of that room, fast. Hestayed in the room of another freshman, Jack Topchick, of Passaic, N.J., thatnight.At the same time, approximately, a man named Walter Lee Yow was checking intothe Salvation Army shelter in Knoxville. His head was bothering him, and hecomplained about being hit, while driving a truck down Cumberland Avenue, behindthe ear, by a particularly hard snowball with ice in it. Neither the police northe university were to hear about Mr. Yow until the following day.February 2nd began as sheer hell for Dean Lewis and Julian Harris. Localreporters, hearing about Lawson’s heart attack, grew increasingly hostile intheir questioning of university officials.“I could feel an ulcer starting as soon as I heard about Lawson,” Harris saidlater, “and each reporter made it grow a few millimeters.”It would have grown even faster if Harris had known that Walter Lee Yow awokethat morning, in the Salvation Army shelter, with his head hurting even more,and called the police to volunteer to testify for Willett. “He shot inself-defense,” Yow said. “Those students were completely out of hand.” Yowagreed to come down to headquarters to make a statement, but said he wanted tosee a doctor first.Dr. Henry Christenberry was the doctor to whom Yow went. A genial 53, he is anative of Knoxville, although he studied at the NYU-Bellevue medical school.Examining the wound behind Yow’s ear, Dr. Christenberry decided that it might beserious. Yow suddenly stood up and began walking about agitatedly, complainingof the pain, and then, very slowly, sank to the floor in a coma.“Ken, come in here!” Dr. Christenberry shouted. His brother, Dr. KennethChristenberry, 49, rushed in from the adjoining office. The two doctors workedover Yow’s body for half an hour, administering oxygen and adrenalin and then,desperately, massaging his heart. It was no use. At 4:30, they pronounced himdead “of multiple concussions and brain damage.”The University of Tennessee now had three corpses to explain.And now that the fury of the students was exhausted, the fury of the townspeoplebegan.“Passion, I see, is catching.…”Shakespeare, Julius CaesarThe Knoxville News-Sentinel editorialized that night: “Yesterday’s terrifyingdemonstration by temporary maniacs must never happen again.” The people ofKnoxville were even more emphatic, and their letters poured into the papers.Sam T. Hodges of 712 Boggs Avenue wrote:“The only surprising thing about the shooting of a student in the customary snowriot of educated hoodlums on W. Cumberland was that it took so long to happen.“The conduct of these mobs is evidence of the vast difference between educationand intelligence.… The conduct of many of those students is nothing short ofheathen idiocy. They show a complete lack of normal human sympathy for personsalready in serious trouble.”Manning B. Kirby, Jr., of 8021 Hayden Drive wrote:“I have no hope that the students involved in the snowballing who read this willbe in any way moved by it. I know they are rude and ruthless, completely selfishand vicious.… I am completely fed up with the homes that instill suchselfishness in them. I am fed up with the university officials who cannot atleast provide safe conduct through the campus.”Mrs. Maie Roberts of 2441 Woodbine Avenue wrote:“Trying to bring a huge truck safely over snow and ice through a blindingsnowstorm is cause enough for distress without having a bunch of wild men,operating under the name of students, attack you for the thrill of seeing yourdistress.”Mrs. W. G. House of Louden, Tenn., wrote:“It seems that Webster didn’t provide a word to define the disgust, nausea, andheartaches that describe the incredible acts of the students at the Universityof Tennessee. Not only the students are to blame, but what about the staff incharge? . . . One cannot possibly believe that the heathen manner of thesestudents continued while the ambulance attendants were trying to place a dyingstudent in an ambulance. This is proof that they had no love or respect even fora fellow college mate.”Mrs. J. L. Hans of Rockwood, Tenn., wrote:“I think the crowd of boys who went into the snowballing incident should feelthat they have the blood of three people on their hands. Instead of the truckdriver being charged and under bond, they are the ones who should be charged.“The truck driver was only doing what anyone would have done under thecircumstances. He was only defending himself.”B. J. Pritchard of 5613 Scenic Hills Road wrote:“The truck driver will have to pay for the rest of his life with grief, if notin prison, and from his appearance he’s the kind that will. Had it not been forthis, he would probably have worked hard the rest of his life and harmed no one.He wouldn’t have been a doctor or lawyer like so many of the students, but he’dhave been a good man, and that’s what counts, so they say.“He’ll be tried and probably convicted of murder or something. But what aboutthose who caused the whole thing? They’re the guilty ones. Three deaths theycaused and not enough humanity about them to cease their inhuman activitiesafter they saw what they had done.”And a student named John S. Moak replied in kind, much to the distress of theuniversity officials:“I can guarantee, although not personally, that if the courts take yourprejudiced view concerning the truck driver that this campus may literallyerupt!“One of my reasons, in fact the main reason, I write this letter is that perhapsI feel that my life is quite cheap if a man can kill ‘one of my kind’ and getoff scot-free.”Dean Lewis, sensitive to the town’s emotions, warned students not to write anymore such inflammatory letters, but angry correspondence from townspeoplecontinued to pour into the News-Sentinel for two weeks.On Wednesday, English 112 met without Marty Goodman. Mrs. Nancy Fisher, theteacher, found that she couldn’t remember what young Goodman had looked like; hehadn’t particularly distinguished himself in that class. Returning the midtermpapers, she found Goodman’s and saw that she had given him the A he had hopedfor.Meanwhile, a committee was started in Greenville, by Willett’s employer,Cutshaw, and $100,000 was raised for Willett’s defense. Knoxville Police ChiefFrench Harris learned that Willett, a farm boy, was very popular in Greenville,and that his reputation with employers and townspeople was excellent.“I can understand how that farm boy felt with all those kids throwing snow andice in his face,” Chief Harris reflected to an inquirer. “I can understand thekids, too,” he added. “They were just having fun. It’s terrible, terrible foreverybody.”But Chief Harris was already ordering a skeptical reevaluation of the Walter LeeYow death. It seemed unlikely, Harris felt, that a truck driver, such as Yowclaimed to be, would be staying at a Salvation Army shelter.A check of trucking lines that pass through Knoxville failed to reveal anyWalter Lee Yow among the employees.Harris then ordered a check to determine if Yow had entered Knoxville by anyother means. A bus driver was finally located who positively identified Yow as aman who had ridden into Knoxville on his bus on February 1st at 2 p.m. The bushad not passed anywhere near Cumberland Avenue.Where, then, had Yow received his injury? Why had he lied about it? Where did hecome from, and what were his motives? Chief Harris has learned a few things, butthe major mystery remains.Walter Lee Yow was a “freight handler”—he wandered about the country takingtemporary jobs loading and unloading trucks. Evidently, he regarded his job asless dignified than a driver’s job and was in the habit of calling himself adriver. He had hitched a free ride on the bus by pretending to be a driver whosetruck had broken down in the snow. No such truck was ever found. Had he perhapswandered out to Cumberland Avenue and been struck by a student snowball? ChiefHarris had doubts about it: The bus driver recalls that Yow complained about hishead pain when he picked him up outside Knoxville over an hour before thesnowballing began.The mystery of Walter Lee Yow may never be solved.“Maybe he just wanted to get his name in the papers,” Chief Harris says. “Maybehe hoped to get the university to pay for his head injury, wherever he got it.Or maybe the injury affected his brain and he really didn’t know what happenedto him.”Chief Harris shrugged.“I try to understand everything that comes in this door, but there’s a lot aboutthe human mind I’ll never understand. Violence always brings out some people whoget mixed up in it for reasons you never understand, and you wonder if theyunderstand it themselves.”“Tell me about the rabbits, George.…”John Steinbeck, Of Mice and MenPerhaps we can hazard a guess at Walter Lee Yow’s motives. The people who wroteindignant letters to the Knoxville News-Sentinel provide a clue as to what drewYow into the maelstrom of death on Cumberland Avenue. Like them, he saw a greatbig beautiful orgy of violence, and wanted to involve himself, to impose his ownmeaning upon it.His head injury gave him his entrance.Others had to be satisfied with vicariously pulling the trigger for Willett anddefending themselves under the guise of defending him, or, like student Moak,threatening riot if Willett’s corpse were not added to the previous corpses. Inone way or another, every man sees his own image in what happened on CumberlandAvenue.A few things have been learned about Yow. He was a bachelor, 55, and came fromAubermarle, North Carolina. Natives of Aubermarle say that he was “nice tochildren” and always gave lots of candy away to the children in his neighborhoodwhen he visited home. But nobody knows where he got his head injury, and nobodyknows, for sure, why he lied about it.The police were still investigating, and so was the university. Dean Lewis saidthat every student definitely identified as being among the snowballers onFebruary 1 would be suspended.Chief Harris was not optimistic that enough evidence would ever be collected toplace definite criminal charges against any student. “College kids sticktogether and support one another’s stories,” he said. “Like police officers,” headds ironically.The university police patrol Cumberland Avenue in every snowstorm now, but thatis probably not necessary. The next “incident” of this sort will be at anotheruniversity, and will be equally unexpected when it strikes.The University of Tennessee’s students did make the news again before the end ofFebruary, however. Eleven of them were arrested on February 23rd for breakinginto Chattanooga National Park and stealing a Civil War cannon weighing one-halfton. The cannon is federal property, and the crime is a federal crime.Boys will be boys.A few months later—on May 28th, 1965—the Grand Jury of Knoxville County convenedand heard the case of the State against William Douglas Willett, truck driver,charged with homicide. After consideration, they refused to “return a TrueBill,” which means, legally, that the State had not proven an indictable charge.In other words, a case of felonious homicide “beyond a reasonable doubt” was notsupported by the facts. In effect, this verdict meant that Willett must bepresumed, legally, to have shot in defense of his life. The truck driver walkedout of court a free man, if any man is ever free.And there it ended.Why did it all happen? One can only answer as German Chancellor Bethmann Hollweganswered in August 1914, when von Bülow asked: “Well, tell me at least how itgot started?” According to von Bülow’s memoirs, Bethmann Hollweg “raised hislong, thin arms to heaven and answered in a dull exhausted voice, ‘Oh—if I onlyknew.’ ”It snowed heavily again this February in Knoxville—one storm covered the streetsfor a week, January 28th to February 4th—but there were no snowball fights onCumberland Avenue. When death falls from the air again in this “meaningless” wayit could as easily occur among a group of adults, or at a meeting of agovernment cabinet."},{"pageContent":"Item [Contents.html#tch26] SIR, ARE YOU USING ONLY HALF YOUR BRAIN?

Certainly, I have seen exactly what you describe asthe communications jam in the hierarchy while working as an engineer. However,the International Banking Conspiracy (in my view) plans destructive acts(destabilizations) through government coercion, which is much easier. Whereasindividual initiative, as expressed in the free market, struggles to efficientlyproduce what people want, “bankster” manipulators seek only to disrupt thisprocess by government regulation, spending, war, confiscation, fiat money,financed takeovers, etc. These disruptions cause swings in stock, bond, andcommodity prices, on which the banksters can speculate successfully because theyhave prior knowledge of timing. They could care less if the trains run on time,but are prepared to make a profit by causing “accidents.” Comment?Wilson: The SNAFU principle doesn’t apply just to productive organizations; itapplies even more to destructive groups, like the Army (where, in fact, the termSNAFU was originally coined). The more deception in a game, the more dishonesty,the more centralization—in short, the more hierarchy and authoritarianism—themore the SNAFU principle will fuck up its reality map. Far from being thesuperintellectual Machiavellians you imagine them as, the big bankers areprobably (if my analysis is correct) the biggest dumb-dumbs on the planet. Everyconspiratorial group becomes steadily stupider the longer it lasts. The paradigmisn’t in Illuminatus!, but in Len Deighton’s The Billion-Dollar Brain, where aTexas oil billionaire is trying to take over the world with the aid of abillion-dollar computer and a secret spy organization. Since every spy in theorganization feeds back exactly the myths that suit this nut’s fantasies, thebillion-dollar computer (following the classic cybernetic law, “Garbage in,garbage out”) comes up with a totally paranoid and bizarre world-reality map.I originally got the idea for the SNAFU principle while reading Faulkner’s GoDown, Moses, and I think I can paraphrase the sentence that gave it to me: “Tothe sheriff, Lucas was nothing but a nigger, and they both knew that; to Lucas,the sheriff was nothing but an ignorant redneck with no cause for pride in hisancestors or hope for it in his posterity, but only one of them knew that.”Anybody who thinks he’s in charge gives off a kinesic signal that discouragesaccurate feedback from others. Those who not only think they’re in charge butuse guns and lies and prisons and terror in general, get no feedback at all butthe most outrageous lies. They feed on shadows in the absence of substantialtruth.Vlad the Impaler (the model for Dracula) once asked two monks what the people ofHungary really thought about him. One monk lied and flattered Vlad and said hewas considered a stern but just ruler. The other gave him straight feedback andsaid everybody thought he was a mental lunatic who should be locked up. Whichmonk do you think he believed and rewarded? Which one did he denounce as atraitor and impale? Look it up!CD: Nesta Webster in her Secret Societies and Subversive Movements claims thatthe inner doctrine of the Illuminati was (is?) antiauthoritarian anarchism: thedestruction of Church and State. On the other hand, Illuminatus! and some of theIlluminati secret records (see Robison’s Proofs of a Conspiracy) suggest thatWeishaupt’s real goal was (or is?) a new and absolute state tyranny (nowachieved?). Was anarchism a cover for the Illuminati’s real goal? Or was theIlluminati’s anarchism sponsored by the International Bankers only until theancient order of kings and queens was destroyed, making way for the banksterdictatorship?Wilson: Beats the hell out of me. The only safe conclusion about Dr. Weishauptand his buddies is that their attempt to maintain secrecy has worked marvelouslywell: no two investigators of the Illuminati have come to the same conclusionabout the real purpose of the Order. My Cosmic Trigger: Final Secret of theIlluminati asserts that the real inner secret was that they had contact withHigher Intelligence in the system of the double star Sirius. I don’t thinkthat’s any more preposterous than any other theories about the Illuminati, andI’ll bet a lot of my readers believe it. The evidence is so good that I’dbelieve it myself if I didn’t know what a great artist I am and how easy it isfor me to produce baroque and beautiful models to fit any weird facts you giveme to work with. Of course, as Nietzsche said, we are all greater artists thanwe realize; 90 per cent of all we experience is our own imagination. InStirner’s metaphor, we have spooks in our heads. Nesta Webster had all sons ofspooks in her head (I always imagine her looking under the bed for Illuminatiagents at night), but she was so modest that she didn’t recognize herself as theartist creating all that. She imagined it was going on outside her. Blessed arethe truly modest, for theirs is the kingdom of maya. I’m vain enough to know I’mcreating my own reality tunnel; so I don’t blame it on anybody else.CD: I seem to detect what I term “virulent skepticism” in your views.Wilson: Why, thank you very much.CD: Although I agree that we must understand how subjective and mechanical thehuman mind usually is before we can even begin to approach objectivity, and mustalways be ready to throw overboard theories when better ones appear, you seem tobe suggesting that a scientific search for reality should be given up entirelyin favor of intellectual gamesmanship. Am I misconstruing you?Wilson: You certainly are. At a rough estimate, about 80 per cent of my closefriends are scientists. What I object to about political dogmas of all schoolsis that none of them are scientific propositions subject to verification orrefutation. They are defined, it almost seems, so as to be beyond testing, andexist in the realm of faith, like theology or demonology. Conspiracy theories,in particular, are often defined so that all evidence incompatible with thethesis can be explained away as “part of the cover-up.” The trouble with systemsthat do not admit of refutation, as Karl R. Popper demonstrates at exhaustinglength in several books, is that they do not yield operational instructions forpredictable technologies.In this connection, my basic philosophy can be expressed as follows: theprosperous and growing nations have nothing in common politically. Some arecapitalist, or state capitalist, some are socialist or mixed economies, some arecommunist, some fascist. The politics is obviously irrelevant to their relativesuccess. What do they have in common? Advanced technology. And vice versa! Thereis no common politics among the starving, backward nations. Some are primitivecapitalist, some feudal, some fascist, some socialist. What do they have incommon? Backward technology or no technology. How, then, will we solve theproblems afflicting this planet? Not by politics of any sort; all of it isirrelevant mammalian ritual. We will solve our problems by better, cheaper, moreefficient technology; especially space migration, the technology ofconsciousness and intelligence raising, and life extension.CD: In another interview (New Libertarian Notes, Box 1748, Long Beach, CA 90801)you indicated that there was some censorship of Illuminatus! What kind of thingswere cut out?Wilson: The best parts, of course. All publishers do this to new writers; Ithink it’s a remnant of some palaeolithic initiation rite, like having “Kickthis boob in the ass” taped to your back after arriving at a new school. It alsoproves that the publisher is a tough, pragmatic, practical businessman who knowswhat the public wants, whereas the writer is a naive, artistic fool who’d starvewithout the publisher showing him how to write. This is very necessary to thepublishers, since they are simple primates and need constant reassurance thatthey, by God, have the top perch on the tree. It is well to remember always thatwe are living on the Planet of the Apes; do not expect intelligence, decency, orsimple courtesy, except on special blessed occasions and with very rare andbeautiful people. The average domesticated ape is only interested in protectinghis own turf and his perch in the tree. You don’t exist for him except insofaras you aid or hinder his territorial and status ambitions. Nearly everybody iscontrolled by the old brain and its mammalian politics; very few have learned touse the new brain.CD: Perhaps the phenomenon you attribute to the “mammalian brain centers” iswhat I prefer to call the “pervasive dominant-submissive (sado-masochistic)conspiratorial order of human relations.”Wilson: Exactly! On Dr. Leary’s Interpersonal Grid (1957), the sadist positionis the extreme at the dominant end of the territorial axis, and the masochistposition is the extreme on the submissive side. All this is built up on neuralcircuits that go back to the pecking-order rituals of the mammalian pack, and isquite robotic. People imprint these roles before the age of 3 and are stillfixated in them at 23, at 43, at 63, or at 83—unless they are brainwashed into anew imprint, or become self-meta-programmers and learn how to “brainwash”themselves constructively. The self-meta-programmer adjusts flexibly to realsituations and does not “play” the one imprinted position over and over. AsCrowley points out, to attain that flexibility, you have to start bydeliberately doing what frightens you most: going to the opposite extreme. Ifyou’re dominant, learn to come on like “gentle Jesus, meek and mild.” If you’resubmissive, learn to bully and terrorize everybody you meet. After suchexperiments, you can gradually develop yourself from a total robot into aself-programmer.CD: Although it would be comforting to believe that ruthlessstatus-territorial-conspiratorial behaviors are instinctual and thus may beovercome by reason, I am afraid the opposite may be true! Perhaps thecommunal-tribal customs and bonds that limit competition to the productive andless-than-fatal realms are the mammalian instincts, and the more gruesome formsof competition and conspiracy are the product of reason! Reason knows no bounds!Many biologists comment that only men conduct intraspecies competition to thedeath. Doesn’t reason too easily overcome the “gentling” imprint of mammaliansuckling?Wilson: Well, from my perspective, what you say is partially true, butinadequate. To cite my distinguished colleague Dr. Leary one more time, thereare four major periods of imprint vulnerability in Homo Sap, the domesticatedape. The first, suckling imprint, recapitulates the biosurvival floating stageof invertebrate life, and is on a spectrum from trusting/loving/dependent tofearful/withdrawn/autistic. The second, territorial imprint, recapitulatesterritorial circuits of amphibious and mammalian life. The invertebrate infantmutates into a mammalian politician, toddling about the house and struggling fora “role” in the pecking order, on the spectrum from sadism-dominance tomasochism-submission. The third imprint, activated by laryn-geal-manualdexterity (human speech and artifact manipulation), recapitulates thepalaeolithic age. The first circuit is roughly what we call Will, the second isEgo, and the third is Mind or Reason. At this stage, even if they’re usinghydrogen bombs instead of sticks and rocks, you’re basically dealing with StoneAge characters. The fourth imprint, after the chemical releasers of puberty,fixates a sex role and a socially bonded Adult Personality, recapitulating theprocess of domestication and civilization. The sad fact is that all fourcircuits are subject to bizarre imprints, robot rituals that make no sense atall. That is to say, the domesticated citizen of today certainly is moredangerous than the tribal character, because Circuit III “reason” is usuallyhemmed in by Circuit I phobias and anxieties, Circuit II emotional cons andmammalian politics, and Circuit IV sexual fetishes and moralistic terrors.Circuit III is also self-referential and never gets beyond its own axioms, in asense. All creativity, in science as well as art, comes from higher circuits,even though at this stage of evolution it still has to be expressed in CircuitIII laryngeal signals (hominid grunts) or manual symbolic graphs or maps, alsoCircuit III functions.That’s the bad news. The good news is that there are higher circuits forming.Leary had identified Circuit V as the neurosomatic or Hedonic circuit; it isgenerally called “higher consciousness” or just “being high.” Circuit VI iswhere the real fun begins. Leary calls it Higher Intelligence or I2, and Dr.John Lilly calls is self-metaprogramming. Gurdjieff called it the TrueIntellectual Center, and it is three mutations above the palaeolithic CircuitIII, which is what most people mean by “mind” or the “reason.” There are alsoseventh and eighth circuits, but they’re irrelevant here.The point is that Circuit III linear-symbolic reasoning is Stone Age and notfully human. As Jung, among others, has pointed out, people whose strongestimprint is on the third circuit (the Rational Type, as Jung called them) areabsolutely as crazy as a drunken goat; e.g., Dr. Frankenstein, or Dr. Teller.They indeed know no bounds. But the Circuit IV type, Gurdjieff’s “GoodHouseholder,” although more promising as a possible candidate for Circuit VHigher Consciousness or Circuit VI Higher Intelligence, is still a domesticatedape, and usually terrorized at any idea that goes beyond either the localCircuit III reality map or the local Circuit IV moral code. The Circuit IItypes, or mammalian politicians, are, of course, totally hopeless, which is whyGurdjieff called them “tramps and lunatics.” Reich called them bigmouths. Go toany political meeting, of any ideology on the planet, and you’ll see that thesemammals are in charge, or think they are. (Actually, everybody else, as pointedout by Hagbard in Vol. II of Illuminatus!, is always using sabotage, consciousor unconscious, to get around and undermine these Circuit II alpha baboons.That’s another aspect of the SNAFU principle.)CD: Since you are clearly an Aleister Crowley enthusiast, I was surprised tofind no homosexual encounters described in Illuminatus! Were you limited toheterosexual “pornography” to maintain a wider appeal?Wilson: Crowley didn’t invent or copyright homosexuality, and his gay affairsare not the sole reason one might be interested in him. For instance, he wasalso a heterosexual, a masturbator, a mountain climber, a hunter, an explorer, abad poet, a prankster, a great poet, a novelist, a high initiate of yoga andmagick, something of a first-class amateur scientist, and a chess master. Ihappen to be interested chiefly in his works on yoga and magick, especially hisphilosophical writings. My own Agnostic Gnosticism is heavily influenced byUncle Aleister, who once wrote: “We place no reliance / On Virgin or Pigeon; /Our method is science; / Our aim is religion.”CD: Illuminatus! appears to attempt to present an integrated “sexual-spiritual”theory. How does the homosexual “perversion” fit in? Clearly, this “perversion”has been a theme in secret societies from the Templars to the Hell Fire Club.Wilson: I prefer the term “neurological” to “spiritual,” because when we say“neurological” everybody knows what we mean, but when we say “spiritual” neitherwe ourselves nor anybody else knows what the hell we mean. Illuminatus! is,among other things, a precise manual of eroto-neurological techniques forconsciousness expansion. This involves what the alchemists call sublimatedsexuality—which does not mean repressed sexuality. Repression leads to all theneuroses, psychoses, and crazy chimpanzee trips chronicled by Freud and hisschool. Sublimated sexuality, in the Tantric and alchemical sense, is HedonicEngineering, the art of getting so high that you fall in love with all sentientbeings. Obviously, homosexual Tantra is the only form of Tantra that will appealto homosexuals. I know virtually nothing about it, since I am heterosexual, butI very much doubt that it is in any way inferior to heterosexual Tantra. SomeGay magick societies have accumulated considerable psychic power. Differentstrokes for different folks, as the saying goes. Magick and faith healing areall based on Circuit V Tantric bioelectricity.CD: According to Daniel Mannix in his book The Hell Fire Club (the influentialeighteenth-century British Satanist club which Benjamin Franklin allegedlyjoined), they had “Do What Thou Wilt” inscribed over the altar on which theyconducted Black Masses. Did Crowley get his motto “Do what thou wilt shall bethe whole of the law” from the Hell Fire Club? Was Crowley a Satanist as claimedby Nesta Webster and other right-wingers?Wilson: The origin of “Do what thou wilt” is Rabelais’ Abbey of Thelema inGargantua and Pantagruel. The Hell Fire Club was deliberately copying Rabelais.Crowley, of course, had read Rabelais and undoubtedly knew about the Hell FireClub (which is more correctly called the Abbey of Saint Francis, by the way),but he claimed to have received the Law of Thelema (“Do what thou wilt shall bethe whole of the law; love is the law, love under will”) from a HigherIntelligence which contacted him in Cairo in 1904. Amusingly, the same idea alsooccurs in Saint Augustine, of all people, who wrote, “Love, and do what thouwilt.”Was Crowley a Satanist? Well, he could and did play the Satanist game onoccasion, just as he played the Buddhist game, the Taoist game, the Hindu game,the atheist game, and lots of others. It is emphatically not true that hisreputation as Satanist and Black Magician was spread entirely by his enemies; hecollaborated gleefully in blackening his own character. To understand hismotives, you must first understand the role of terror in reimprinting thenervous system for higher, post-terrestrial functioning. Aside from yoga andpsychedelic drugs, the only method for reimprinting the nervous system is shock,especially near-death trauma. Most shamans are people who have gone through thedeath-rebirth process, just as in our own society you still find people who havepassed through “clinical death,” got revived on the operating table, and cameback raving about transtime perspectives and beings of pure light. Crowley knew,as many shamans do, that you can get this result (shock and reimprint) quicklywith some students by simply scaring the daylights out of them. A classicgimmick is to steadily increase their (repressed) suspicion that the belovedguru, in whom they have stupidly placed blind faith and love, is actually adiabolist out to destroy them, drive them mad, or enslave them. Crowley usedthis technique often, just as Don Juan Matus used it occasionally on CarlosCastaneda. The students who confront their fear and conquer it achieve a higherneurological awareness. Hagbard Celine uses several variations on this inIlluminatus!, and the same games were being played in the Eleusinian rites atAthens 2,500 years ago. The Wrathful Demons serve the same function in TibetanBuddhism.CD: What do you think about the Church of Satan?Wilson: I think they’re an amusing bunch of dodos, but no worse than the averageCalifornia encounter group. I’m sorry to break up the national Hate Thy Neighborcult that’s so popular these days, but the path to awakening does not lie inexpressing or glorifying the mammalian territorial emotions but in transcendingthem. I will say, however, that LaVey’s gang are more honest than most encountergroups, in that they do deal with the Circuit II crazy chimpanzee unleashed byencounter techniques, whereas the others just invoke the crazy chimp briefly andthen banish him back into the unconscious.CD: Do you concur with Anton Szandor LaVey’s theory, in his Satanic Bible, thatSatanism has played a major role in European history and was the core doctrineof both the Illuminati and the Knights Templar? And the power behind Masonry?Wilson: No. I will undertake, if anybody will pay for the job, to prove that theHidden God of all the secret societies in European history was actually BugsBunny. With the documentary evidence as sparse and contradictory as it is forthe persecuted heresies of Europe, one can “prove” anything by selectiveediting. Margaret Murray, for instance, has proven that the Hidden God wasactually a Goddess (and most feminists believe her, of course). I think her caseis better than LaVey’s, but I don’t believe either of them. Frances Yates’modest, tentative, and scholarly books, Giordano Bruno and the HermeticTradition and The Rosicrucian Enlightenment, shed more light on these mattersthan all the dogmatic tomes of all the ideological partisans. (I think theHidden God was the student himself, or herself, after transcendingsubmissiveness and seeing through the guru game.)CD: Do you have any reaction to Dr. Emmanuel Josephson’s theory that John Adamswas the head of the Illuminati in America?Wilson: As a historian Josephson would make a good dentist. John Adams was sodamned independent that he couldn’t even get along with the Federalists, theparty he helped to found. When his son, John Quincy Adams, got kicked out of theFederalist party, old John wrote that he no longer considered himself aFederalist and hadn’t for years. Even at the Continental Congress, where Johnwas more conciliatory and less cranky than usual, he managed to offend everybodyat least once. I can’t imagine that crusty old Massachusetts farmer lasting morethan six months in any conspiracy before he’d get thrown out for intransigence.Anyway, all the literature of that period points to Jefferson as the Illuminatiagent in our government, if there was one.CD: Although Josephson’s theories of the Illuminati in America (to say nothingof his theories of the Skoptsi in Russia) are far out, I think you are givinghim short shrift. Although quick to jump to dogmatic conclusions, he is one ofthe few conspiracy theorists to develop a competing conspiracy model rather thanthe timeworn monolithic model. His theory of the role of theRockefeller/Rothschild (Standard Oil/Royal Dutch Shell) battle for oil in WorldWars I and II is quite plausible in my view (see Rockefeller Internationalist).As historians, respected Establishmentarians and Fabians are good eye doctors(as was Josephson). Establishment-Fabian types (Toynbee and Wells) usuallyforget that people, no less conspirators, are a factor!Wilson: Well, my estimate would be that Establishment historians are about 99per cent prejudice, and Josephson was maybe only 80 per cent prejudice. Historyis one of the far-out arts in which there are almost no rules that asimple-minded novelist like me tries to follow. Frankly, the reason I don’tbelieve historians is because the characters they create are too corny fornovels: tinhorn villains and superheroes who belong in comic books. It’s all warpropaganda, before or after the fact. I have been on the scene of severalimportant historical events circa 1952–1980, and never once did the press(Establishment or Underground) report what my nervous system sensed. Trying tofind out what the hell is really going on behind the buzzard of lies put out bythe 24 chief conspiracies on this planet is hard work, long hours, and low pay;and if by chance you do find out part of it, the fanatics of every ideology willjump all over you with spiked heels. Incidentally, Pound, who is generallyconsidered even more of a nut than Josephson, was probably at least partiallyright in emphasizing that wars are often provoked to establish debt, i.e., toincrease the profits of your favorite villains, the International Bankers. Butthere are other forms of predation besides oil competitions and money swindles,and all of them are, as Gurdjieff knew, “astrologically” controlled. That is,when the endocrine cycles which primitive occultists identified with planetarycycles reach certain “hot” points, the mammals start fighting. It is ourmisfortune to belong to a mammal species with technology sufficient to make thefighting increasingly omnilethal. But this probably happens in the evolutionfrom mammalhood to true intelligence on every life-supporting planet. We’re onlyhalfway through the evolutionary cycle of our star, and the more advanced formsare just beginning to appear in random mutants during the past few thousandyears.© Copyright 1977, Conspiracy Digest, Box 766, Dearborn, MI 48121"},{"pageContent":"Item [Contents.html#tch28] images [images/chap28_ufig_01.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Item [Contents.html#tch29] THE EIGHT BASIC LOSER SCRIPTS [Contents.html#tch29] I.

Freud—I imagine him with the inevitable cigar clenchedbetween his teeth—was insisting that all that stuff was nonsense, and Jung wasarguing that there was something in it, really, although he didn’t know what. Asthe argument heated up and the emotional energy began to crackle, there suddenlycame an explosive bang from Freud’s bookcase.“There,” said Jung, “that is an example of a so-called catalytic phenomenon.”“Oh, come!” Freud exclaimed. “That is sheer bosh!”“It is not,” Jung replied firmly, feeling possessed by an intuitive convictionhe could not understand. “You are mistaken, Herr Professor. And to prove mypoint, I now predict that in a moment there will be another loud report!”No sooner had Jung spoken, than the same detonation went off again in thebookcase. Freud looked so aghast that Jung, who was a bit unsettled himself,dropped the subject at once. In his autobiography, Jung says he and Freud neverdiscussed the incident again.What are we to make of such a yarn? The skeptic will label it “merecoincidence”—or, even more strongly, “sheer coincidence”—and forget about it.This does not really satisfy anybody but the skeptic himself, and leaves most ofus thinking of Ring Lardner’s immortal line: “Shut up,” he explained.Parapsychologists will offer two alternative pseudoexplanations. Some of themwill say that the bangs might have been caused by something as banal as seismictremors in the earth or traffic in the street, and the paranormal aspect of theincident was just that Jung suddenly exhibited precognition, the ability to seeahead in time. Other parapsychologists will suggest instead that what happenedwas psychokinesis (PK), what laymen call “mind over matter.” According to thistheory, Jung’s unconscious somehow made the second explosion happen. Those whobelieve in this explanation say it also accounts for poltergeists (a German wordfor “noisy ghosts”), who allegedly afflict some houses with crashes and bangsfor months on end, and even make the furniture fly. The noisy ghost, they say,is emotional-psychic energy accidentally unleashed by one of the people livingin the house.The trouble with these explanations is that, like coincidence, they are onlywords. The term precognition does not tell us what any scientist would want toknow, which is how Jung saw ahead in time. And the word psychokinesis does nottell us how Jung’s mind caused the second boom.But there is an explanation for it, and for all the other paranormal eventsyou’ve read about: the spoon bending, the out-of-body experiences, the faithhealers, even the eyes of Laura Mars. And the explanation lies in physics.“I am inclined to believe in telepathy,” Albert Einstein once said, “but Isuspect it has more to do with physics than with psychology.” When Einstein saidthis back in the Twenties, nobody in either physics or psychology understoodwhat he was suggesting. Today, new breakthroughs in a far-out branch of physicscalled Quantum Theory indicate that Einstein was, as usual, fifty years ahead ofhis contemporaries.These new discoveries seem to offer a single scientific explanation for all theweird events that parapsychologists have classified under such conflictinglabels as ESP, direct-brain perception, clairvoyance, distant viewing,psychokinesis, out-of-body experience, and cosmic consciousness (Illumination).What some physicists are suggesting is that all such mystical brain functionsare aspects of one phenomenon: a subatomic but universal intelligence systemthat receives, integrates, and transmits information at a level much deeper thanthe sensory appearances of what we call space, time, and separateness. And thisintelligence system, although outside spacetime as we know it, manifests itselfwithin space and time as electrons, atoms, molecules, cells, complicatedcritters like you and me, planets, stars, and whole galaxies.So, what is quantum mechanics? A quantum is a unit of action, just as a foot isa unit of length or a gram is a unit of weight.Quantum physics first appeared as a theory in the 1890s, when Philipp Lenardobserved that fight travels in distinctly timed, choppy units like the beats ofa drum, not in smooth, continuous waves like the singing of a violin. Thesedistinct units are called quanta; the single unit is a quantum; and quantumtheory is the body of experiment and mathematics dealing with such discontinuousactions. Furthermore, it is now known that all subatomic events occur in thisquantum, or jumpy manner—a miniature psychedelic light show.If the world of large things seen by our senses is like a straight line (——),the quantum world is like a dotted line (-------). Or, to employ three artisticanalogies, a painter would describe the quantum world as collage, not portrait.A musician would call it staccato, not legato. A filmmaker would say it wasmontage, not linear narrative.No cause-and-effect relationship has yet been found between one quantum actionand the next. Most physicists are convinced that there is no cause and effect onthat level. It is as if Law and Order function only above the atomic level;inside the atom, the surrealists, crapshooters, and anarchists have taken overthe shop.To the ordinary citizen, everything in modern physics is as queer as athree-legged duck anyway, and this lack of causality in the quantum wonderlandis no stranger than anything else physicists tell us. To the physiciststhemselves, quantum mechanics has done to traditional science what Sitting Bulldid to George Armstrong Custer. One of the greatest quantum physicists, NobelLaureate Erwin Schrödinger, was so distressed by his own equations that hedenounced “this damned quantum jumping” (verdammte Quantumspringerei) in aletter to Einstein. Science, you see, is supposed to be able to yield accuratepredictions, based on the iron law of cause and effect; and the breakdown ofcausality within the atom makes it look as if science itself may be an arbitraryhuman attempt to impose order on a disorderly or chaotic universe.Rising from the wreckage of causality, three lines of thought have attempted tomake sense of the seemingly senseless facts. These are known as the Copenhageninterpretation, the multiple-universe model, and the hidden-variable theory.The Copenhagen Interpretation was devised in the Twenties by Nobel LaureateNiels Bohr and named after his hometown, where he lived in the middle of theCarlsberg brewery, in a house given him by the crown. (Yes, Virginia, thecommercials are true: Carlsberg really is the official brewer for the King ofDenmark.)The breakdown of causality in quantum mechanics is expressed mathematically inthe concept of “the collapse of the state vector.” You don’t need to know whatthat means technically: roughly, a vector is a mathematical expression tellingyou the direction and magnitude of a force. It is enough to know that inordinary (large-scale) mechanics, the vector tells you what will happen next,and in quantum mechanics, the state vector only tells you what might happennext. There is thus a great gaping hole between what science should be able topredict and what quantum theory does allow us to predict, and it is a hole bigenough to fly a 747 through.Bohr filled in the hole by saying the collapse of the state vector exists onlyin our minds. No, that is not a misprint, and, no, I am not oversimplifying.Another physicist, Bryce DeWitt, tells us bluntly, “The Copenhagen view promotesthe impression that the collapse of the state vector and even the state vector(itself) are all in the mind.” To the ordinary person who doesn’t know the statevector from Finnegan’s feet, this may not sound too alarming, but to traditionalphysicists, Bohr sounds like a man saying the brick wall you banged your head onis only in your mind.Bohr was not a solipsist; he didn’t claim the state vector was only in his mind.But his theory does seem, at least to his critics, to imply a kind of groupsolipsism, a notion that the universe known to science is not a model of thereal universe but something once removed from that: a reflection of how thehuman mind goes about building models of the real universe. As Sir ArthurEddington, an astronomer much influenced by Bohr, states this position: “We havefound a strange footprint on the shores of the unknown. We have devised profoundand elaborate theories, one after another, to account for its origin. At last,we have succeeded in reconstructing the creature that made the footprint. Andlo! It is our own.”The Multiple-Universe Model has its roots in science fiction, and somephysicists think it should have been left there. It is, however, a logical andconsistent alternative explanation of what the hell collapses that unpredictablestate vector. Briefly: everything that can happen to it, does happen to it.This is also known as the Everett-Wheeler-Graham model, having been devised bythree Princeton University physicists, Hugh Everett, John Archibald Wheeler, andNeil Graham. I don’t know what they were smoking at the time, but this viewholds, in effect, that if you toss a coin, it lands both heads and tails—indifferent universes. The state vector collapses every which way, as the actualquantum equations imply. We see only one result, because we are in only oneuniverse; but in the universe next door, another you and another I will see adifferent result. And there are an incredible number of such possible (and bythis fundamentalist reading of quantum math, real) alternative universes.As Bryce De Witt has written in Physics Today: “I still recall vividly the shockI experienced on first encountering this multiworld concept. The idea of 10100+slightly imperfect copies of oneself constantly splitting into further copies .. . is not easy to reconcile with common sense.” Indeed it is not, but De Wittand others have accepted it as the least absurd way out of the quantumuncertainty problem.If you can deal with the idea that in the universe next door, Hitler isremembered as a popular artist who never went into politics, and in the nextuniverse over, John F. Kennedy decided not to go to Dallas on November 22, 1963,and lived to a ripe old age; and in another universe, you don’t exist becauseyour parents never met—you can take the multiworld path out of quantum anarchy.Otherwise, it is back to Copenhagen, where the universe we know is inside ourheads, or onward to the hidden variable, where space and time do not reallyexist.The Hidden-Variable Theory was started by Albert Einstein, even though he neverexplicitly used the term “hidden variable.” Nevertheless, Einstein was alwaysannoyed by quantum uncertainty, and attacked quantum mechanics from every anglepossible, summing up his view in the famous dictum: “God does not play dice withthe universe.” In 1952, Dr. David Bohm, then considered the most brilliant pupilof J. Robert Oppenheimer, showed explicitly that Einstein’s criticisms ofquantum theory were valid only if there were a subquantum level: a world belowthe quantum world. Bohm also showed that this subquantum world could be thehidden variable that collapses the otherwise anarchistic state vector, but onlyif the supposed variable functioned “nonlocally.” This means, in effect, only ifspace and time do not exist as we think they do.The trouble with the Copenhagen solution is that, however much Niels Bohr andhis defenders may deny it, this path ultimately leads to the conclusion thateverything we think we know is only a construct of our brains. Physics thenbecomes a branch of psychology; it tells us not what the universe does, but whatour brains do in organizing their impressions into ideas. The trouble with themultiple-universe model is that, however elegantly it may fit the quantumequation for the state vector, most of us simply can’t believe in skillions andskillions of universes—each as vast in space and time as the one we think we’rein—where everything that can happen really does happen.And the trouble with the hidden-variable theory has always been that nobodydared claim they had found any subquantum world, beyond space and time, in whichthe hidden variables could function.Until recently.“Your theory is crazy, but it’s not crazy enough to be true.”Niels Bohr to a young physicistIn 1964, Dr. John S. Bell published a demonstration that still has physicistsreeling. What Bell seemed to prove was that quantum effects are “nonlocal” inBohm’s sense: that is, they are not just here or there, but both. What thisapparently means is that space and time are only real to our mammalian senseorgans: they are not really real.This was the first step toward solving the mystery of Freud’s exploding bookcaseand similar enigmas of parapsychology, but nobody realized it immediately. Thenext step came—as is often the case in science—from three sources at once.In the early to mid-Sixties, Charles Muses, a mathematician interested inparapsychology, Dr. Timothy Leary, the LSD researcher, and Cleve Backster, apolygraph expert who had been investigating ESP in plants, all proposed thatconsciousness does not reside in the brain alone. Rather, they all proposed thatconsciousness goes down to the cellular level, to the molecules, to the atoms,and maybe even deeper.The first to construct a complete quantum theory on this basis was Dr. EvanHarris Walker, a physicist working for the US Army in weapons research.Dr. Walker explains this theory in a paper written with Dr. Nick Herbert: “Thehidden-variable theory of consciousness asserts: (1) there is a subquantal levelbeneath the observational/theoretical structure of ordinary quantum mechanics;(2) events occurring on this subquantal level are the elements of sentientbeing. This being the case, we find that our consciousness controls physicalevents through the laws of quantum mechanics.”That couldn’t possibly mean what it seems to say, could it? Yes, by all thepotbellied gods of Burma, it means exactly what it says: our consciousnesscontrols physical events through the laws of quantum mechanics. We are thehidden variable—or parts of it.There hasn’t been a more radical proposition since the Psalms proclaimed (andJesus repeated), “I said, you are Gods” (John 10:34).Walker and Herbert have specifically applied this theory to psychokinesis—andhere we are getting close to explaining Freud’s exploding bookcase. Using anequation devised by Walker to predict the amount of quantum wobble that can beproduced by the human mind, they have compared the results predicted with thoseactually obtained in one classic, long-range investigation of the alleged PKfunction. The experiments were conducted by Haakon Forwald, a retired electricalengineer, from 1949 to 1970. Forwald’s results exactly fit the prediction ofWalker’s equation. Subjects trying to control randomly falling cubes producedresults as far above chance as they should have, according to Walker’s math.Dr. Herbert has carried this line of thought one step further. Director of theC-LIFE Institute (a conscious robot job-shop), Herbert is a soft-spoken fellowwho dresses like Einstein did (or a Sixties hippie). He had developed Bell’sTheorem into the idea of the “cosmic glue,” which holds, in effect, thateverything is the cause of everything.The waters get pretty deep here, but fortunately the cosmic glue can beillustrated, with amusing accuracy, by an old Sufi joke. Nasrudin is out ridingwhen he sees a group of horsemen. Thinking this may be a band of robbers,Nasrudin gallops off hastily. The other men, who are actually friends of his,say, “I wonder where Nasrudin is going in such a hurry?” and trail after him tofind out. Nasrudin, feeling himself pursued, races to a graveyard, leaps thefence, and hides behind a tombstone. His friends arrive and, sitting on theirhorses, lean over the wall to ask, “Why are you hiding behind that tombstone,Nasrudin?”“It’s more complicated than you realize,” says Nasrudin. “I’m here because ofyou, and you’re here because of me.”In Herbert’s cosmic-glue theory, every quantum event is here because of anotherquantum event, which is here because of the first quantum event. At this level,causality is meaningless, and Herbert prefers to speak of “influence,” whichacts every which way in time. All of us—past, present, and future—are boundnonlocally by the cosmic glue.Dr. Herbert claims this is the only theory of quantum causality consistent withBell’s demonstration that cause and effect are nonlocal, and with theEinstein-Bohm claim that nothing in the universe is truly random. In case thefull implications of the cosmic glue still haven’t hit you, Herbert will tellyou quite bluntly: “Consciousness, nonlocal in space and time, is the hiddenvariable.”You ask at this point, “If this is true, why don’t we notice it?” Why, that is,do we generally feel that our consciousness is located in one place—a few inchesbehind our foreheads? The physicists haven’t tangled with this problem yet, butthere are answers to be found in anthropology and psychology. In the firstplace, not all people feel that the consciousness is necessarily in the brain.The Chinese have always thought it was in the center of gravity of the body, andtheir ideogram for “mind” literally shows a heart and liver, not a brain. Hindusand Sufis perform daily exercises of moving consciousness all over the body,from the toes and legs and torso onward to the top of the skull and back downagain. In the second place, modern psychology has demonstrated that where andhow we feel our selves to be is conditioned by childhood experiences, and is notbased on any innate physiological seat of ego awareness. And, finally,parapsychology and the study of other societies records ample cases of peoplewho have experienced their consciousness as far, far removed from the physicalbrain.According to the cosmic-glue theory, consciousness is everywhere and every-when;we experience it here and now only because we are trained or brainwashed toexperience it that way.“There is a sharp disagreement among competent men as to what can be proved andwhat cannot be proved, as well as an irreconcilable divergence of opinion as towhat is sense and what is nonsense.”Eric Temple Bell, mathematicanLet us, as the Chinese say, draw our chairs closer to the fire and see what weare talking about.The story so far: the parapsychologists have accumulated a great deal of strangedata about wild, bizarre behaviors of human consciousness. Although they havelabeled these strange experiences with many names, the data all seem to reduceto the phenomenon of consciousness acting as if it were not imprisoned in thebrain, as if it could migrate elsewhere occasionally (“out-of-body experience”),or as if there were nonsensory openings through which information from elsewherecan leak in.The quantum physicists, meanwhile, have found a subatomic jumpiness orrandomness that cannot be reconciled with common-sense ideas of cause andeffect. Aside from saying the whole problem is in our heads (the Copenhageninterpretation) or that everything that can happen does happen (themultiple-universe model), the most plausible theory that has been devised is thehidden-variable theory which, together with Bell’s Theorem of cosmic glue,suggests that consciousness is nonlocal in space and time (not locked into thebrain).The hidden-variable theory is gaining ground because its central assumption ofnonlocality (Bell’s Theorem) has been experimentally confirmed five times since1974. These experiments showed that two photons (light particles), once incontact, will continue to react as if still in contact, no matter how far apartthey are in space, exactly as predicted by Bell’s math—and just as would be trueif Walker and Herbert are right in claiming that quantum events are controlledby a consciousness which transcends space and time.In San Francisco, Dr. Jack Sarfatti, President of the Physics/ConsciousnessResearch Group, has gone a step beyond Walker and Herbert. “Below the spacetimelevel of the universe we perceive,” Sarfatti says, “is the subquantal world ofminimum intelligences. Imagine them as micro-micro-microcomputers. They make upthe hardware of the universe and are localized in space and time.” (Each is hereor there, not both.) “But,” Sarfatti goes on, “the software or programming isnonlocal in Bell’s sense.” (The cosmic blueprint is here, there, and everywhere;now, then, and everywhen.) “The hidden variable,” Sarfatti concludes, grinningbenignly over his Mephistophelean black beard, “is not precisely consciousness,as Herbert and Walker think, but information.”Information in modern science has a very special mathematical meaning, morespecific than in ordinary speech. Without going into the math of it, informationis coherent order, as distinguished from noise, which is incoherent chaos.Biological evolution is the gradual emergence of information out of chaos. Tothe biologist, it is information in the genetic code of the cherrystone thattells it to grow into a cherry tree and not a teakettle. To the modernsociologist, information is the roads, customs, and traditions that mold randomindividuals into a society. If Sarfatti is right, information is also coded intothe quantum foam, telling it to grow into the universe of space and time weknow.Imagine that your brain is a biological computer, as most neurologists nowthink. Imagine further that all subquantal events are alsocomputers—micro-micro-microcomputers, as Sarfatti says. Imagine finally that theuniverse is also a computer—a mega-mega-megacomputer. What Bell’s Theorem means,according to Sarfatti, is that the hardware of this interlocking system ofintelligent Chinese boxes—or computers within computers within computers—islocalized in space and time; but the programming—the subquantal hiddenvariable—is everywhere and everywhen.This sounds suspiciously like a definition of God, because God is, according toall theologians, just such a nonlocal programmer—omniscient, omnipresent, andomnipotent.But if this information system is a kind of God, or a scientific analog of God,it is also you and me . . . and the lamppost. The information, remember, isnonlocal in space and time; so the whole universe and every particle in itpartakes of the information, and is thus a cocreator of the whole, but ondifferent scales. Is this not what the pantheists have been claiming formillenniums?Currently, Sarfatti is attempting to demonstrate this interpretation of Bell’sTheorem practically by designing a faster-than-light communication system (USpatent disclosure #071165, May 12, 1978). Although Dr. Carl Sagan haspontificated that this whole project seems to him “at most a playful notion,”there is already a patent search afoot because of rumors that one or more otherinventors are trying to patent the same device. Sarfatti also claims an unnamedintelligence agency is very interested in this, and a nuclear engineer, who hasnot given me permission to use his name, claims that the Russians already havesuch a device.(Faster-than-light communication does not contradict Einstein, incidentally. TheTheory of Relativity says only that energy cannot travel faster than light.Bell’s nonlocal information system, as developed by Sarfatti, does not transferenergy but only information [order]. What is interesting to the layman about allthis is that such a device, if built, would function precisely as the brain doesin those altered states of consciousness studied by parapsychology. It would bea model of the extrasensory circuits of the brain, just as an ordinary computeris a model of the brain’s logical circuits. And Sarfatti strongly suspects that,whether the Russians have this or not, advanced extraterrestrial civilizationscertainly do. When Sagan says that Sarfatti’s hope of contactingextraterrestrials this way is “playful,” Sarfatti replies that Sagan’s attemptsto contact them by radio represents “electromagnetic chauvinism.” So there.)In fact, Dr. Sarfatti traces his ideas back to his early adolescence, when hereceived a series of mysterious phone calls from somebody (or some thing)claiming to be an extraterrestrial computer and encouraging his interest inquantum physics. The calls terminated when his mother got on the phone and toldthe entity (whatever it was) to stop playing jokes.To this day, Jack Sarfatti isn’t sure what to make of those phone calls. “Maybeit was an extraterrestrial,” he says whimsically. “Maybe they want us to tune into the subquantal, cosmic communication system. Or maybe it was just a practicaljoker, as my mother thought. Or maybe it was the CIA’s Operation Mind Controltrying to stimulate certain lines of thought among bright high-school studentswho were planning scientific careers.…”Sarfatti had his first jolting encounter with Jungian synchronicity whenneurologist Dr. Andrija Puharich published his book, Uri, concerning hisinvestigation of the controversial Israeli wonder-worker Uri Geller. Puharichclaimed that all through his association with Geller, he had also receivedmessages from an alleged extraterrestrial with a computerlike voice.UFOlogist John Keel, in his books This Haunted Planet and The MothmanProphecies, tells of hundreds of ordinary citizens who have received similarphone calls, during the past 30 years, from computerlike voices with weirdextraterrestrial messages.My favorite of Keel’s cases is a housewife who got the Zen-like rebuke: Wake up,down there!According to Sarfatti, it is premature to attribute such clusters of eerienessto actual extraterrestrials. We don’t have to say that a real ghost hauntedFreud’s bookcase that day in 1909. And we don’t have to say that the phone callsreceived by Sarfatti, Puharich, and Keel’s subjects came from literalextraterrestrials. Rather, the subquantal consciousness, Sarfatti says, wasagitated nonlocally (beyond space and time), producing these effects withinspace and time. But the source of the agitation was, he says, probably humanemotions and beliefs.Dr. Brian Josephson, 1973 Nobel prizewinner in physics, has taken the inevitablenext step. Analyzing the puzzling differences found in certain key atomicexperiments during the Sixties—in which European physicists were obtaining oneset of results over and over, while American physicists were just as repeatedlyobtaining opposite results—Josephson suggests that the conflicting beliefsystems of the experimenters were influencing the test data by unconscious PK.That is, in the most literal sense, Walker is right in claiming “ourconsciousness controls physical events through the laws of quantum mechanics.”“My goodness, Toto, I don’t think we’re in Kansas at all anymore.”L. Frank BaumAnother part of the physics/consciousness or mind/matter synthesis is emergingin Palo Alto, from the research of physicists Russell Targ and Dr. HaroldPuthoff, who have been investigating “distant viewing” for several years.“Distant viewing” is Targ and Puthoff’s label for one particular kind of ESP,which they have found particularly susceptible to replicable laboratory testing.It consists of seeing what is happening at a great distance from where you arelocated—as in The Eyes of Laura Mars.Targ and Puthoff believe not only that their work demonstrates the reality ofdistant viewing, but that everybody has the talent latently. They even claimthey can teach it to anybody, however skeptical, and have a standing invitationto all skeptics to come to their laboratory and have a go at it.As Richard Bach, author of Jonathan Livingston Seagull and one of Targ/Puthoff’sexperimental subjects, writes in the introduction to their book, Mind Reach, “Itis too late now to burn their files; what they’ve found is already beingduplicated and expanded in laboratories around the world. As I am coming to knowmore of the powers that I have, so are thousands of others, so will the readersof this book.”Puthoff and Targ explain all their results by Bell’s Theorem, which theyparaphrase as “parts of the universe apparently separated from each other cannonetheless act together as parts of a larger whole,” which is Dr. NickHerbert’s cosmic glue all over again.Saul-Paul Sirag, Vice-President of Jack Sarfatti’s Physics/ConsciousnessResearch Group, has his own weird tales to tell. Once, while involved in the UriGeller investigation, Sirag took LSD to see if in that altered consciousness hecould perceive the alleged extraterrestrial behind Geller. What Sirag saw wasthe head of a hawk, which astonished him, since Geller had never described theentity as a hawk. Six months later, this image appeared on the January 1974cover of Sirag’s favorite sci-fi magazine, Analog, illustrating a story called“The Horus Errand” (Synchronicity #1). A year later, Dr. Andrija Puharich, notknowing of Sirag’s experience, claimed that Geller’s extraterrestrial ally hadoften appeared to him as a hawk, which he nicknamed “Horus” (Synchronicity #2).Later, Sirag discovered that the face on the Analog cover was that of RayStanford, a Texas psychic, who also claimed mysterious experiences with Gellerand a hawk (Synchronicity #3). Oddest of all, Kelly Freas, the artist who haddrawn the cover, had never met Stanford and was not using his face consciously.Like Sarfatti, Sirag does not take this (yet) as evidence of realextraterrestrial intervention. “Such synchronicities,” he says, “are merelyindications that Bell’s nonlocal subquantal effects are occurring.”Or as Dr. Timothy Leary expresses it in conversation, “Your brain is created bythe nonlocal subquantal intelligence Sarfatti and other turned-on physicists aredescribing. That intelligence is both centralized—inside the atoms of yourbraincells—and decentralized, all over spacetime.”“Oh, sure,” Sarfatti agrees when this is reported to him. “By Bell’s nonlocalitytheorem, if intelligence is anywhere in the system, it is everywhere in thesystem.”Everywhere . . . not just in you and me (which is flattering), but in the louse,the flea, the rock, and (worst of all) in the people we despise. For, as the Zentradition has it, a monk once asked a Zen Master, “What is the Buddha?”“The one in the hall.”“But,” the monk protested, “the one in the hall is a statue—a piece of wood!”“That is so,” the Master agreed.“Then what is the Buddha?”“The one in the hall.”Whereupon the monk achieved illumination, and I hope the reader does too.“The Science of the Impossible,” originally appeared in OUI Magazine; Copyright© 1979 by Playboy Publications, Inc."},{"pageContent":"THE GODDESS OF EZRA POUND [Contents.html#tch31]BY MARY MARGARET WILDEBLOOD“I wish Mr. Pound would tell us what he believes,” T. S. Eliot lamented in 1932.In Make It New (1933), Pound answered tersely, “I believe the Ta Hsio.” Thiswould seem to settle the matter: Ezra Pound was neo-Confucian. We would expectthis from Pound’s admiration for Voltaire, Jefferson, eighteenth-centuryrationalism, modern science; his translations of the basic Confucian texts (TaHsio itself, Chung Yung, Lun Yu, Shih King); his absorption in economics, socialjustice, and Utopian plans to save the planet; his contempt for “Xtianity . . .a cult devised to make good Roman citizens, or slaves,” for “Hindoo squiggles”and “Bhuddist vapors,” for “all that goddam Xtian, Jew, Moslem buncombe,” for“Taozers” (a word that looks like Taoists and sounds like “dowsers”); hisunforgettable judgment in Cantos 52–71: “Shit and religion always stinkingtogether.” What other “religion” could Ezra Pound possibly embrace butConfucianism, the most ethical and least religious of all?According to “Bontrager’s Law” (created by Dr. O. R. Bontrager, University ofPennsylvania Psychology Dept.), “Everything is more complicated than it seems.”This is also true of Ezra Pound’s metaphysics. The Greek gods and goddessesappear so frequently in his poetry that the Thomistic Hudson Review has accusedhim of allegiance to “the bar-room neo-paganism of our time,” whatever that is;he has compromised his monolithic allegiance to Ta Hsio by saying elsewhere(Instigations) that Ovid’s Metamorphoses is “a Sacred Book” (in contrast to theHebrew Scriptures, “the record of a barbaric tribe, full of evil”); the laterCantos are full of admiring references to various Gnostic and Christianheresies, especially the erotic-tantric ones; Section: Rock Drill puts thedown-to-earth Confucian social-justice theme in distinctly second place to amore pagan exuberance:How to govern is from Kuan Tze but the cup of white gold at Patera, Helen’sbreasts gave that *In fact, Professor Schneider of Louisiana State University, in his book onPound, has quoted evidence that the poet was deeply embroiled in “occultexperimentation” since at least 1914; and Christine Brooks-Rose in A ZBC of EzraPound asserts that E.P. was “a practising occultist for 40 years.” Prince Borisde Rachewiltz, Pound’s son-in-law, has commented on the vast library of rare andmedieval magick manuals that Pound accumulated over the years, despite hischronic poverty; this suggests unusual devotion to the theurgic arts in a man sopoor that he made his own furniture to save money and fed all the stray cats inRappolo because he knew what it was to be hungry.Even the Ta Hsio, Pound’s favorite Confucian text, is not quite so rationalisticas other Confucian works; and the version Pound translated as The Great Digestin the death-cell at Pisa, 1945, was “edited” (in fact, rewritten) by Chu Hsi,the syneretist whose neo-Confucianism was largely Taoist-magickal-mystic inemphasis. (Joseph Needham regards Chu Hsi as largely motivated by a desire tocreate a Confucian-Taoist synthesis as a native Chinese alternative to themetaphysics of Buddhism then sweeping the Middle Kingdom.)Hugh Kenner, a brilliant neo-Thomist critic with a marked penchant forconverting every writer he studies to his own religion (his Dublin’s Joyce evenmakes the bitterly anti-Catholic Joyce into a Thomist) grants that “the mostimportant character” in Pound’s Cantos is Aphrodite.The Gracious Goddess, indeed, first appears at the end of Canto I, where Pounddescribes Her (“Thou with golden girdles and breast-bands / Bearing the goldenbough of Argicida”) and tags Her with the Latin label Venerandum, the strongesttense in the Latin tongue, only to be rendered in English by some such compoundas She-who-must-be-adored; i.e., we have no choice in the matter; She is tooadorable to be resisted. She is, in fact, like the Tao as described by Confuciusin Canto 74: “What you can depart from is not the Way,” “The wind is part of theprocess/the rain is part of the process.” (Way and process both render themysterious Tao, a glyph made up of moving feet and intelligence roots.)The unforgettable description of Helen of Troy in Canto 2 subtly incorporatesthe mortal woman into the immortal goddess:Let her go back to the ships, back amongGrecian faces,Lest evil come on our town, evil andfurther eviland a curse cursed on our childrenMoves? Yes, she moves like a god,And has the face of a goddess,and the voice of Schoeney’s daughtersAnd doom goes with her in walkingLet her go back to the ships, back amongGrecian voicesThe adjoining Greek puns—Elenaus, Elenarke, Eleptolis—subtly weave in theoncoming theme of Eleanor of Aquitaine, compounding double meanings into atriple ambiguity. (The Greek means “destroyer of ships, of cities, of men,” andcontains Helen’s name within each term. There is no way of “translating” thisinto English, although Andreas Divus caught a lovely equivalent in Latin:“perditrix naviam, perditrix urbiam, perditrix heroam, nupta bellum.” The lasttwo words, meaning “wife of war,” join Helen with Venus, bride of Mars. We areseeing the dark, Kali, “Black Goddess” side of the Lady in these early chants.)Eleanor (and her father, Guilliame of Aquitaine, whose implausible brag ofhaving copulated with 120 women in a night is soberly recorded in Canto 5)brought paganism back to Europe in the eleventh century. That the troubadours ofProvence and the singers of the Grail legend—both of whom found shelter andprotection in her court—were writing in code has often been suspected. TheTantric symbolism of the Grail legend is unearthed in Jesse Weston’s From Ritualto Romance—written, Dr. Weston remarks in her introduction, with the aid of anoccult group still practising these Mysteries in England in 1908. (I have neverbeen able to decide whether this refers to a pre-Gardnerian Witch coven, or tothe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.) The full decoding of the Grail Rite isgiven to IX° initiates of the Ordo Templi Orientis, and was knowingly employedby Richard Wagner in the writing of Parsifal. As early as 1916, Pound was aware,and wrote in “Psychology and the Troubadors,” that the “male-female magnetism”was used as a “yoga” by the troubadors and minnesingers; he quotes in thisconnection Pierre Vidal’s famous line, “I think I see God when I look upon mylady’s body nude.” (Eleanor’s famous bare-breasted ride through Jerusalem wasnot a “girlish prank” but a deliberate magick act, bringing the emblem of theGoddess back to the symbolic center of the three patriarchal religions ofJudaism, Christianity, and Islam.)By 1936, Pound was familiar enough with this yoga to speak not only of“magnetism” but of “energies that border on the visible,” like “glass seen underwater,” extending “several feet beyond the body.” This is not the kind ofknowledge one obtains from reading the troubadors, however diligently, even foras many years as Pound admittedly gave to their works. It is the knowledge of anadept. Soon he was obsessed with the teachings of Scotus Erigena, who lived inthe ninth century, and was dug up and ritually condemned as a heretic during theAlbigensian crusade of the eleventh century, when the pagan culture of southernFrance was destroyed in a genocidal fury Kenneth Rexroth has accurately called“the worst atrocity in history, before the invention of progress.” Erigena, toPound, was most notable as the author of the hermetic koan, “All things thatare, are lights.” Dr. Timothy Leary, no doubt, would call this an expression ofthe Sixth Neurological Circuit, the metaprogramming circuit opened after theimprinting of the Fifth, neurosomatic circuit by Tantric fusion. Poundregistered it as a “clean mentality . . . free of the Hindoo disease and theHebrew disease” which otherwise dominated the medieval age.Erigena’s aphorism appears, both in English and Latin (Omnia quia sunt, luminasunt), frequently throughout the later Cantos, from 74 to 110, and is oftenlinked with two lines from the troubadour Sordello, both in English and inProvencal, of which, the English (or Pound’s English) isAnd if I see her notNo sight is worth the beauty of my thoughtLike Vidal, Sordello is looking at the physical body, but seeing more than“Single Vision, and Newton’s Sleep” can discern. He is seeing the Light ofErigena, the White Light of the Tantric adept. Similarly, in Arnaut Daniel’s12th canzon, Pound was struck by “E quel remir contral lum de la lampa,” and inhis 1912 translation rendered thisand laugh and strip and stand forth in the lustreWhere lamp-light with light limb but half engagesThe thought is that the Lady’s “light limb” possesses its own luminosity; thisstuck in E.P.’s mind and in the ’20s a typically terse half-reference to itcrept into Canto 20:And the light falls, remir,From her breast to thighsOnly the word remir (sending the really obsessive Pound addict to a Provencaldictionary) reveals the origin in Daniel’s canzon. Again, in translating ananonymous Provencal alba (dawn song), he managed the tricky feat of keeping allthe original rhymes in place while moving from Provencal to English, andsimultaneously hinted again at the Tantric light mystique:When the nightingale to his mateSings day-long and night lateMy love and I keep stateIn bowerIn flower’Til the watchman on the towerCry:“Up! Thou rascal, rise,I see the whiteLightAnd the nightFlies.”In Canto 39, we move rapidly from the most unique portrait of subhuman, purelyanimal sex in English literature (“Girls talked there of fucking / Beasts talkedthere of eating / All heavy with sleep, fucked girls and fat leopards”) toanother dramatic epiphany of the Tantric suprahuman Eros:Fac deum! Est factus!Ver novum!ver novum!His rod hath made god in my bellyDark shoulders have stirred the lightningA girl’s arms have nested the fireCantat sic nuptaI have eaten the flame(The Latin: “Make the god! He is made! The spring! The spring!” “Thus the bridesings.” The bride is being wedded to the god, in a fertility ritual whichconsciously employs the Tantric light energy to protect the crops. This is theoldest of all magick secrets: the flame that is eaten is the alchemical elixir.)Even Pound’s economics become wedded to this pagan vision, in Canto 45, wherethe main charge against finance capitalism (“Usura,” a Latin term borrowed fromScotus Erigena) is that it destroys the sacrament of Eros:Usura slayeth the child in the wombIt stayeth the young man’s courtingIt hath brought palsey to bed, lyethBetween the young bride and her bridegroomCONTRA NATURAMThey have brought whores for EleusisCorpses are set to banquetat behest of UsuraThis is, whores rather than priestesses serve the Free Goddess in post-Calvinistculture; contraception and abortion are rejected, not on Roman Catholic grounds,but as “unnatural” behaviors to which the poor are driven (see Pound’s economicwritings) by the hoarding of money in bank vaults.Growing more bitter, and lapsing characteristically into Latin and Greek, Poundgoes on in Canto 46: “Aurem est commune sepulcrum / Usura, commune sepulcrum /ELENAUS, ELENARKE, ELEPTOLIS” (“Gold is the common grave / Usury, the commongrave / Destroyer of ships, cities, and men,” the epithets of destruction takenaway from the Goddess and placed where they really belong).As the Cantos progress into their last movement, the historical personages fadeinto the background and the Goddess comes forth increasingly. In the Pisansequence (1945), She is usually accompanied by the Chinese ideogram, ming (fromthe Ta Hsio), usually rendered “intelligence.” Pound, looking hard at thisglyph’s elements—the sun and moon together—found more light than rationalintelligence alone can translate. Erigena’s “All things are lights” usuallytrails Her and these heavenly lamps by no more than one or two lines.Canto 106, typically, spans the world in hymning Her (“And in thy mind beauty, OArtemis / as of mountain lakes in the dawn / Foam and silk are thy fingers /Kuanon / and the long suavity of her moving”); under Greek or Chinese names, Sheis one.A cone of power is raised in Canto 116, and the poet’s confession of failure isan indirect testimony that She has not left him, even after his rages andDummheiten, the death cells and the treason trial, the 13 years in a madhouse:“I have brought the great ball of crystal / who can lift it? / Can you enter thegreat acorn of light? / But the beauty is not the madness / Tho’ my errors andwrecks lie about me.” This rises, in Canto 120, to Her most perfectmanifestation, and that of the Tao, although neither are mentioned by name:I have tried to write Paradise.Stand still.Let the wind speak.That is Paradise.(Cf. “The wind is part of the process,” Canto 74.)More directly, Canto 113 is a statement of faith that refutes eternally thenotion of Pound as materialistic social reformer only:The Gods have not returned. They never left us.They have not returned.“Above civic order, l’amor,” he already mused in Canto 95. In fact, the wholemixed jumble of Poundian political economics—Jeffersonian, Douglasite,Mussolinian—has been put into perspective under the neo-Confucian mysticism ofChu Hsi ever since Canto 85, which introduces the repeated line, “The dynastycame in because of great sensibility” and the associated ideogram, ling, both ofwhich recur again and again in the last section of the poem. Ling is notsomething that can be taught; it can only be learned. Pound renders it as“sensibility” (as distinguished from correct knowledge, right ideas, or otherintellectual values). It might be called “orgonomic sense,” if that Reichianterm were generally known and understood. Confucius says, “It is like loving abeautiful person or hating a foul smell, also called respecting one’s own nose.”It is conspicuous lack of this virtue which leads to the general ugliness andmeanness of usurocratic civilization, as Pound observes in Canto 100: “wayrepeatedly not clean, noisy, and your hearts loveless.”The dynasty (Yin, actually, if you must know) came in because ling, sensibility,preexisted it, Confucius said. Pound quotes this repeatedly, because he wants tomake clear that he does not believe, like most Utopians, that reform of theworld is merely a matter of getting his own politico-economic ideas generallyaccepted. The higher awareness, the subtle sensibility, must first appear,before “civic order” can manifest. This sensibility, obviously, is a function ofl’amor.Looking at this ling ideogram again, we find in the middle of it ming. TheChinese dictionaries will tell you what this means: a dancing shaman, or afertility ritual. Hugh Kenner unambiguously translates this as witchcraft. It ishackneyed to say that religion preexists culture. Pound has gone further andtried to show us what kind of religion preexists humane culture.images [images/chap31_ufig_01.jpg] The male-female magnetism was used as a yoga by the troubadours.Sensibility is not something that can be taught; it can only be learned. Writing in partial sentences (for greater emphasis: the missing words functionby forcing the reader to complete the Gestalt) Pound defines the theme of theCantos, near the end, in two wistful clauses:for something not brute forcein governmentandTo be men not destroyers. Those who think Pound’s allegiance to fascist economics* meant a devotion tofascist politics miss the point entirely. There is no poem in English morefeminine, more loving, than the Cantos; the celebration of the Gracious Goddessnot only anticipates the ongoing Yin Revolution of our times, but is the mostpoignant repudiation of macho values written in this century. MARY MARGARET WILDEBLOOD was a man named Epicene Wildeblood until the Novelistwho invented her decided to change her sex. She has adapted well to themetamorphosis and has become an ardent Feminist. Originally published in GREEN EGG.___________* Pound refers to a celebrated drinking cup said to be molded directly from theright breast of Helen of Troy and, therefore, the most beautiful cup in theancient world. Decent government is important, he is saying, but a lovely womanis more important.* This was chiefly an allegiance to the idea of non-interest-bearing moneycoined by the State, as distinct from the current practise in which 72 per centof all “money” exists only in bookkeeping ledgers and serves as interest-bearingdebt for private bankers. Pound also liked the Corporate State idea of havingthe poets represented in Congress by two poets, the carpenters by twocarpenters, the doctors by two doctors, etc., instead of the system in which weare all represented by lawyers. He was wrong about Mussolini, yes; and he was anidiot whenever he got to writing about “the Jews” collectively (or about “theXtians” collectively); but he wasn’t wrong about currency. His economic ideasare similar to those of R. Buckminster Fuller and increasing numbers ofpostindustrial thinkers."},{"pageContent":"CONSPIRACY DIGEST [Contents.html#tch32]INTERVIEW 4 [Contents.html#tch32]Conspiracy Digest: Francis King in his Ritual Magic in England claims that L.Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology, infiltrated a West Coast OTO lodge for theFBI. After destroying the sex-magick cult, Hubbard supposedly used what helearned to start his Scientology cult. Can you shed any light on this?Wilson: Well, the way I heard it, Hubbard was a member of the Agape Lodge of theOTO in Los Angeles in the ’40s, but he didn’t destroy it. It was years later,when some tabloid dug up Hubbard’s link with the OTO, that he claimed he hadbeen spying on them, not for the FBI, but for Naval Intelligence. As forScientology, I would agree with Kenneth Anger’s judgment that Hubbard took thetechniques used in the OTO to liberate people and turned them backward in orderto enslave people. But that may be uncharitable. As the Sufis say, everyorganization eventually becomes a conditioning or brainwashing instrument. Itcould be that Hubbard means well, but Scientology has lasted too long and becomemonolithic and myopic. I think Crowley deliberately screwed up the succession inthe OTO (so that nobody could prove legitimate succession from him, and thereare now five competing heads), just to prevent that kind of rigidification. Aswe Discordians say, “Convictions cause convicts.” Whatever you believe imprisonsyou.CD: Alternative paradigms (or world views) fascinate me. Isn’t what you refer toas magick simply a reflection of the fact that numerous paradigms seem equallyuseful in explaining our sense data?Wilson: By God, you really understand it! The whole function of Crowley’smagick, like Leary’s Neurologic, Tibetan Tantra, and Dr. John Lilly’smetaprogramming theory, is to experiment with alternative belief systems ormodels until you realize that holding to any one model is stupid andself-limiting. (Modern physicists discovered this independently by getting downto the quantum-energy level, where things are so complex that you need more thanone model to make sense of them.) It’s like the old Jewish joke about the guywho sits playing one note on the violin, day after day, week after week, yearafter year. Finally his wife says, “Max, for God’s sake, other people who playthe violin try different notes and make whole melodies.” He says smugly,“They’re looking for the right place. I’ve found it.” Most people imprint oneset of biosurvival strategies, one emotional game, one symbolic reality map andone sex role, and then stop growing. To understand Richard Nixon, assume thatafter his first orgasm created his Circuit IV sex-role imprint around 1925 orso, his nervous system never changed again. He was literally looking at the1970s through a 1920s reality tunnel. So-called “future shock” is really presentshock, because, as Leary says, the present is the future of the nervous system.Most people are still seeing/sensing a world that vanished around the middle oftheir adolescence. Women, who take a new imprint at each childbirth, are lessrigified than men, in this respect. Which is why, as Faulkner said, to find outwhat’s really going on, ask the women. See who smiles more often—men or women.It’s the women, of course, and that’s not all sex-role playing or flirtation.They smile more because they’ve got more sense of humor: they see the realitiesthat most men are too blindly robotic to notice.© Copyright 1977, Conspiracy Digest, Box 766, Dearborn, MI 48121 Addendum 1980: I was perfectly serious in describing Nixon as a man whoimprinted the 1920s and continued looking at the world through a 1920s realitytunnel even into the 1970s. If one compares Nixon’s presidency with those ofHarding, Coolidge, and Hoover, it becomes obvious that everything that hadhappened since about 1930 was somewhat “unreal” to him. Thus, Watergate was arerun of the Teapot Dome scandal; Nixon’s economic policies were pure Hoover;even the search for “enemies” (the “enemies list”) was a reprise not so much ofthe McCarthyism of the ’50s as of the Palmer anticommunist roundups of the early’20s; etc.This hooking onto the past is not restricted to right-wing mentalities. Marxistsare largely hooked into the social sciences of Marx’s creative years (c.1850–1890); the New York Review of Books is a regurgitation of the PartisanReview in its lively days (late 1940s); and as for the “liberal intelligentsia,”Alan Harrington has defined them perfectly: “They still think the hotintellectual issue of the day is Marx versus Freud.”An explicit example of this type of neophobia and palaeophilia occurs in CityMiner magazine for Spring 1979, in an interview with the no-growth fanatic GarySnyder. Snyder says explicitly, “But what I’m talking about is not what criticsimmediately call ‘the Stone Age.’ As Dave Brower, the founder of Friends of theEarth, is fond of retorting, ‘Heck, no, I’d just like to go back to the ’20s.’Which isn’t an evasion because there was almost half the existing populationthen, and at that time we still had a functioning system of publictransportation.” In terms of the theory in this book, Snyder and Browerimprinted the 1920s as positive and are still trying to adjust the world toevolve backward into that 60-year-old reality tunnel.*Grok: when people talk about “going back,” it is really not very importantwhether they want to go back to the 1920s, like Snyder; or to the 1930s, likemany a nostalgic liberal; or to the 1960s, like Country Joe MacDonald; or to theStone Age; or to medievalism, like many Catholic intellectuals. The importantthing is that “going back” is a retreat reflex on Circuit I. The neophobia isthe same in all cases; the imaginary past into which various nervous systems arehooked may differ, but the fear of stepping forward into the future is the sameas that of the child not willing to leave the mother, the security blanket, theoriginal infantile biosurvival imprint.images [images/eye.jpg]images [images/chap32_ufig_01.jpg]__________________* At least Snyder is honest about wanting fewer people. There are only two pathsto take in dealing with the hunger problem: create a better technology, as urgedin this book, to feed everybody; or else go backward, and let most of the humanrace starve. My complaint against the no-growth people, chiefly, is that theyare not as honest as Snyder about wanting fewer people. The no-growth programdoes mean genocide (letting most of humanity starve off, and shrinking back toSnyder’s 1920s population level), and I wish they would admit frankly that suchmassive starvation is what they are proposing."},{"pageContent":"Item [Contents.html#tch33] BAVARIAN ILLUMINATITHIS IS A MAGICK LETTER [Contents.html#tch33] The science of Neurologic is easy.Humanity is trapped (temporarily) in static, repetitious neural circuits thatcreate misery, conflict, prejudice, war, stupidity.

All powerstructures try to brainwash everybody into a single tunnel-reality, with Stateeducation, Holy Inquisitions, FBIs, Gestapos, Drug Administrations, etc., andanybody who questions that tunnel-reality gets the hemlock (Socrates, 4thcentury B.C.), burning at the stake (Bruno, 17th century), the bottom cell inthe basement at Folsom (Leary, 1973), or some similar discouragement.“Communication is only possible between equals” as Hagbard Celine and I keeptelling people, and no ruling elite is ready, willing, or able to receivedissenting signals from independents or mavericks. Once you accept a pluralistuniverse, you are logically compelled to accept a pluralist society—i.e., adecentralized, libertarian, or outright anarchist society—and no ruling classcan accept that idea. Rulership only makes sense if there is one capital-RReality and one group of experts who know how to make it run.I don’t see paranoia as the ally of liberty or of anything positive, and Isuspect you are using the word in some special sense. Clinical paranoia is adysfunctional condition in which the victim loses all communication with others(signals contradictory to his fixed tunnel-reality being screened out) andgradually disintegrates into suicidal or homicidal rage. Like all other forms ofmonomania, it is of no help to the victim, to his friends and associates, or tosociety at large, and is just a tragic waste of brain cells. We should alwaystry to have a tunnel-reality this week bigger, funnier, and more hopeful than wehad last week, and we should aim even higher next week. Besides, paranoia is aLoser Script; it defines somebody else as being in charge around here except me.I prefer to define myself and my friends as the architects of the future. IfDavid Rockefeller has the same idea about himself and his friends, well, thefuture itself will decide which coalition was really on the Evolutionary Wave:the Money people or the Idea people.However, the skeptical paradigm—or, more accurately, the skeptical method, sincethere is no one skeptical paradigm—is most emphatically liberty’s greatest ally.I doubt the dogmas of the Left Wing and the Right, of scientists and mystics, ofconspiracy-mongers and those who claim there are no successful conspiracies. Atthe same time, knowing that every sentient being has a signal that might teachme something, I am ready to learn from all of those groups. I doubt myself mostof all. (But I’m also willing to learn from myself, since I don’t seem to becrazier than any of the other fanatics around.)The conspiracy I dread most is the organized churches, which have so castratededucation in this country that people regard themselves as educated (and havediplomas to “prove” it) without any training at all in scientific skepticism,logic, or elementary semantics. There is no real energy shortage, as you haveoften pointed out in this magazine, but there is a most dreadful and tragicintelligence shortage.CD: We seem to have jumped to different wavelengths on this question! I agreethat no elite encourages independent, diverse thinking and world views. However,the current Western elites do encourage their subjects to believe that there isno elite, that is, that the increasingly totalitarian state of affairs is justan inevitable accident, the unavoidable vector sum of impersonal societalforces, even the will of the people! Please recall that, contrary to theopinions of the radical circles you frequent, ordinary, moderate folk believe wefive in a democratic, pluralist country. (In fact, this is what, withEstablishment guidance, they see as the problem!) Wouldn’t resistance to Statismbe increased if people were more suspicious of their rulers? Before liberty canbe secured it would appear to me that a much larger proportion of the populationmust become “suspicious” of those who propose that liberty be given up inexchange for security, “greatness,” a “new deal” or some other conspiratorialchimera.Wilson: Certainly. But chronic suspiciousness, or suspiciousness without a senseof humor, can be just as blinding and limiting as the naive submissiveness ofthe masses. One tunnel-reality is as limiting as another. We are all blind meninvestigating the elephant. You have to jump quickly from reality map to realitymap, time after time, to begin to “see the Elephant,” in the Sufi phrase, andrealize how complex and funny this whole terrestrial drama is. For instance, Iam firmly convinced that the money lords are not nearly as clever as they liketo think they are (or as clever as you think they are) and that real control hasslipped out of their hands, maybe as far back as 1918, as Buckminster Fuller hassuggested. The real control, even more amusingly, is in the hands of people who,by and large, don’t realize they’re in control, namely the scientists andengineers. They generally feel weak, exploited, and abused by the money lords,and think the money lords still are in control. That, I think, is the greatillusion of our time, and only Fuller and Leary and one or two others have seenthrough it. That, again, is the SNAFU principle in action. All the signals arejammed because nobody knows where the real power is.All the signals are jammed because nobody knows where the real power is.CD: As a conspiracy theorist I certainly do not try to “define others as incontrol.” Despite my wishes, whoever is in charge around here, it certainlyisn’t me! Don’t we have to discover the realities of power before we are likelyto be able to improve the situation?Wilson: As Mong-Tse said, “A man must destroy himself before others can destroyhim.” Perhaps you put too much energy into resentment, anger, denunciation, andsimilar negative energy states, and don’t have enough positive energy surplus toachieve your goals. Perhaps you are too impatient and expect “freedom to dropinto your lap as a fairy’s gift,” as Nietzsche said.As Mong Tse said, “A man must destroy himself before others can destroy him.”Perhaps you are looking on too small a time scale to see the grand evolutionarypattern of higher consciousness and higher intelligence ever emerging. Perhapsyou are too attached to the superficial and temporary, and regard each setbackas total defeat, without seeing that intelligence always wins in the long run.Copernicus couldn’t publish in his lifetime, Bruno was burned at the stake,Galileo was condemned and placed under house arrest, etc., but the new astronomyfinally triumphed over the Catholic orthodoxy. Dr. Reich died in prison of abroken heart, because he believed that those who jailed him really were incontrol and, hence, saw himself as a victim of injustice. Dr. Leary stayed high(through a sentence nine times longer than Reich’s) because he knew that, evenin prison, even in the solitary-confinement cell at the bottom of the maximumbuilding in Folsom, he was more in control than his persecutors. He knew thatbecause his ideas were creating the future; whereas the gang who locked him upcan’t even control the present, which is, in fact, falling apart all aroundthem.As I said earlier, the path of intelligence is all hard work, low pay, and ahigh probability that the fanatics of all ideologies will gang up on you. If aperson can’t accept that cheerfully, he or she should give up such a dangerousoccupation, and join one of the coalitions of true believers orEstablishmentarians. If any of the conspiracies really are as all-powerful asyou think, it certainly would be the wise choice to join them, if comfort orstatus are your main concerns. We in the SMI2LE organization accept that we areliving on the Planet of the Apes and that, as Charles Fort said, it doesn’tsteam-engine until it comes steam-engine time. The stupidity, brutality, andbanditry around us are what one should expect on a primitive planet with lowtechnology and only a few hundred years of science. (As Gurdjieff said,“Fairness? Decency? How can you expect fairness or decency on a planet ofsleeping people?”)Frankly, I’d find life a bore if I weren’t playing for very high stakes in avery high-risk siutation. We do have the chance, now, for Utopia and even forimmortality. If we who see this opportunity aren’t smart enough, adroit enough,and fast enough to seize the chance, then we don’t deserve to initiate the nextstage of evolution. In that case, the age of the mammalian predators isn’tending, and we are deluded visionaries seeing a future that can’t happen yet.The order of nature is nothing to be angry about. Meanwhile, until they shovelme under, I still think our side is winning and that the power brokers you worryabout are a bunch of dying dinosaurs. © Copyright 1977, Conspiracy Digest, Box 766, Dearborn, MI 48121"},{"pageContent":"DISSOCIATION OF IDEAS, 4 [Contents.html#tch35] I deas are the source of all technology, all wealth, all changes in theenvironment by brain power.There are four sources of ideas:mechanical association, a la Pavlov;logic;experiment;intuition.Mechanical association is simple, quick, and often necessary to survival (e.g.,stove is hot: don’t touch stove).Logic can discover whether a system of ideas is self-consistent.Experiment can discover whether ideas are always true, always false, orsometimes true and sometimes false (e.g., cold stove not hot: safe to touch coldstove).Intuition ALONE can generate new ideas and associations, new technology, newwealth.Note well that mechanical association can be totally arbitrary and false (e.g.,racism).

The waiting lines at banks and post offices are growinglonger all the time, even though demographers tell us US population is no longerrising. The street signs more often than not say WALK on the red and DON’T WALKon the green. You can’t get a plumber on weekends. Nobody has been able toexplain the cattle mutilations yet. Every survey shows that the price ofconsumer goods, the number of violent crimes, and the eerie popularity of TheGong Show are ominously accelerating.I believe I have found the explanation for these distressing trends. Needless tosay, I cannot present, in a short article, all the evidence which I haveaccumulated in three decades of careful metasociological research; that willhave to await the publication of my three-volume study, Why Everybody Is GoingBonkers. Here I can only mention the thousands of depth interviews, theinnumerable flowcharts and helix-matrix equations, the vast files of computerreadouts, the I Ching divinations, and the other rigorous scientific techniquesused in developing what I modestly call Celine’s Laws of Chaos, Discord, andConfusion.Celine’s First Law is that National Security is the chief cause of nationalinsecurity. That may sound like a paradox, but I will explain it at once.Every secret police agency must be monitored by an elite corps ofsecret-police-of-the-second-order. There are numerous reasons for this, butthree are especially noteworthy.National Security is the chief cause of national insecurity.1. Infiltration of the secret police, for the purpose of subversion, will alwaysbe a prime goal of internal revolutionaries. This is an ordinary part of thespy-counterspy game. There is nothing Weather Underground would like better thanhaving a few agents in the FBI or CIA, for the same reasons that the FBI or CIAwould like to have a few agents in Weather Underground.2. Such infiltration will also be a prime goal of hostile foreign powers, forthe same reasons.Please note that these are simple facts of the secret-police game, well-knowneven to the general public, the subject of many ingenious plots in popular spyfilms, and not particularly alarming yet. Nonetheless, the seeds of Chaos,Discord, Confusion, and Paranoia are already here, for the simple reason thatonce a human being develops the habits of worry and suspicion, he or she findsincreasing justifications for more worry and more suspicion. For instance,Richard Q. (not his real initial), one of my interview subjects, becameconcerned, after ten years in the CIA, with the possibility of infiltration byextraterrestrial agents. He was eventually retired when he began to claim thatdemons in the form of dogs wanted him to assassinate Laverne and Shirley.3. Secret-police officials acquire fantastic capacities to blackmail andintimidate others in government.Stalin executed three chiefs of his secret police in a row, because of thisdanger. One of my informants claims that every president since the NationalSecurity Act was passed in 1947 has learned how to have sexual intercoursewithout making a single audible sound, because of the possible electroniceavesdroppers. As Nixon says so wistfully in the Watergate transcripts, “Well,Hoover performed. He would have fought. That was the point. He would have defieda few people. He would have scared them to death. He has a file on everybody”[Italics added.] Thus, those who employ secret-police organizations must monitorthem to be sure they are not acquiring too much power.In the United States today, the super-elite that monitors the CIA is theNational Security Agency.Here is where a sinister infinite regress enters the game. Any such elite,second-order secret-police agency must be, according to the above pragmatic andnecessary rules, subject to infiltration by native subversives or hostileforeign powers, or to acquiring “too much power” in the opinion of its masters.(It may even be subject, if Richard Q. was correct in his anxieties, toextraterrestrial manipulation.) And so, it, too, must be monitored—by a secretpolice of the third order.But this third-order secret police (such as, perhaps, Nixon’s notorious“plumbers”) is also subject to infiltration or to acquiring too much power. . .and thus, with relentless logic, the infinite regress builds. Once a governmenthas n orders of secret police spying on each other, all are potentially suspect,and to be safe a secret police of order n + 1 must be created. And so on,forever.Thus who employ secret police must monitor them to be sure they are notacquiring too much power.In practice, of course, this cannot really regress to infinity, but only to thepoint where every citizen is spying on every other citizen, or until the fundingruns out, whichever comes first.National Security in practice, then, must always fall short of the logicallyideal infinite regress which we have shown is necessary to the achievement ofits goal. In that gap between the ideal of “One nation under surveillance, withwiretaps and mail covers for all” and the strictly limited real situation offinite funding, there is ample encouragement for paranoias of all sorts toflourish. In short, every government that employs secret-police agencies mustgrow more insecure, not more secure, as the strength, versatility, and power ofthe secret-police agencies grow.For instance, a certain left-wing nation which has employed secret-policeagencies for 61 years has now reached the point where the leaders are terrifiedof painters and poets. In another, right-wing nation infested with secret-policeagencies, several purges have been caused by three practical jokers whoregularly call middle-rank officials on the phone and talk in what appears to bea code. The secret police, of course, are no fools, and are aware that thismight be what it in fact is, a form of anarchist humor; but they can’t be sure.What usually happens in such cases is this: an official receives one of thesemystery calls, saying perhaps “Pawn to queen rook, five. No wife, no horse, nomustache. A boy has never wept nor dashed a thousand kim.” He knows immediatelythat surveillance upon him will be increased tenfold. In the next few days,while memories of all his mistakes, small bribes, incautious remarks, and otherincriminating events haunt his imagination, he observes the increasedsurveillance, and begins to suspect even the most loyal of his subordinates ofwatching him with eyes that miss nothing and to give a sinister interpretationto everything. Within ten days, he usually attempts to contact a foreigngovernment to seek political sanctuary, and the secret-police net closes on him.By the same process of worry leading to more worry and suspicion leading to moresuspicion, the very act of joining a secret-police organization will eventuallyturn a man or woman into a clinical paranoid; in layman’s terms, “bananas” or“wigged out.” The agent knows whom he is spying on; but he never knows who isspying on him. Could it be his wife, his girl friend, his secretary, thenewsboy, the Good Humor man?For these reasons, secret-police agents develop elaborate and complex theoriesto account for what is actually going on. According to one of my tables of data,there isn’t a single theory held by professional conspiracy buffs which isn’talso believed by many members of our various secret-police agencies. In fact,the exact percentages of believers in these extravagant scenarios are quitesimilar among a group of 1,000 CIA agents and a control group of 1,000 readersof the underground press, as shown in Table 1.

This isthe result of the impossible infinite regress and its resultant of worry leadingto more worry.Furthermore, if there is a secret police at all, in any nation you care toimagine, every branch and department of that country’s government becomessuspect, in the eyes of cautious and intelligent people, as a possible front foror funnel to the secret police. (That is, the more shrewd citizens willrecognize that something titled a branch of HEW or even PTA might actually berun by the CIA.) Inevitably, the government as a whole, and many nongovernmentalagencies, will be regarded by reasonable persons with fear and trepidation.Proverbs like “One can’t be too careful these days” and “Better safe than sorry”become a kind of sinister folk wisdom.But further yet: any government which already has a secret police (and a secretpolice monitoring the secret police, etc.) will become alarmed on observing thatits more hip and intelligent citizens now regard it with loathing andmisgivings. The government will therefore increase the size and powers of thesecret police. This is the only rational move, within the context of thesecret-police game.Something passing as a branch of HEW might be a front for the CIA.(The only alternative was once suggested sarcastically by playwright BertBrecht, who said, “If the government doesn’t trust the people, why doesn’t itdissolve them and elect a new people?” No way has yet been invented to elect anew people; so the police state will instead spy on the existing people evenmore vigorously.)This, of course, creates additional paranoia in both the governors and thecitizens, because a sufficiently pugnacious secret police will eventually “havea file on everybody,” including its own creators. This leads to another infiniteregress: the more power the secret police has, the more people will loathe thegovernment; and the more people loathe the government, the more power will begiven to the secret police.Thus, whether any of the hypothetical conspiracies mentioned earlier reallyexist or not, a system of clandestine government inevitably produces, in boththe rulers and the ruled, a mood of paranoia in which such conspiracy theoriesflourish.This escalating sense of suspiciousness is accelerated by the fact that everysecret-police organization engages in both the collection of information and theproduction of misinformation. That is, you score points in the secret-policegame both by hoarding signals (information units)—that is, by hiding facts fromcompetitive players—and by foisting false signals (fake information units) onthe other players. This creates the situation which I call Optimum Fuckup, inwhich every participant has rational (not neurotic) cause to suspect that everyother player may be attempting to deceive him, gull him, con him, dupe him, andgenerally misinform him. As Henry Kissinger is rumored to have said, anybody inWashington these days who isn’t paranoid is crazy.One could generalize the remark: anyone in the United States today who isn’tparanoid must be crazy.“If the government doesn’t trust the people, why doesn’t it dissolve them andelect a new people?”The deliberate production of misinformation (or, as intelligence agencies moreeuphemistically call it, disinformation) creates a situation profoundlydisorienting to the philosopher, the scientist, and the ordinary Joe who wantsto know the best time to go to the bank. The desire to discover “what the hellis really going on” (the definition of science offered by physicist Saul-PaulSirag) is totally incompatible with the circulation of disinformation; we allneed to know, at least roughly, what the hell is really going on if we are notto stumble around like blind robots colliding with things we weren’t told werethere.Maybe the UFOs really exist—or maybe the whole UFO phenomenon is a cover for anintelligence operation. Maybe there are black holes where space and timeimplode—or maybe the entire black-hole cosmology was created to befuddle andmislead Russian scientists. Maybe Jimmy Carter really exists—or maybe he is, asthe National Lampoon claims, an actor named Sidney Goldfarb specially trained toproject the down-home virtues that the American people nostalgically seek.Perhaps only three men at the top of the National Security Agency really knowthe answers to these questions—or perhaps those three are being deceived bycertain subordinates (as Lyndon Johnson was deceived by the CIA about Vietnam)and are as disoriented as the rest of us. Such is the logic of a DisinformationMatrix.Personally, I find it easier to believe in UFOs than in black holes or JimmyCarter; but that may just indicate the damage to my own brain caused by theOptimum Fuckup of the Disinformation Matrix.According to a recent survey, 19 per cent of the population believe the moonlandings were faked by Stanley Kubrick and a gang of special-effects experts.Perhaps these archskeptics are the sanest ones left among us. Who among thereaders of this book has a security clearance high enough to be absolutely surethat these ultraparanoids are wrong?This general tendency toward chaos, discord, and confusion, once a secret policehas been established, is complicated and accelerated by Celine’s Second Law, towit: Accurate communication is only possible in a nonpunishing situation. Thisis a very simple statement of the obvious, and means no more than that everybodytends to lie a little, to flatter or to protect themselves, when dealing withthose who have power over them, especially the power to punish. (This is whycommunication between parents and children is notoriously befoozled.)Every authoritarian structure can be visualized as a pyramid, with very few atthe top and very many at the bottom, as in the flowchart of any corporation orbureaucracy. On each rung, participants bear a burden of nescience in relationto those above them. That is, they must be very, very careful that their naturalsensory activities as conscious organisms—the acts of seeing, hearing, smelling,tasting, feeling, drawing inferences from perception, etc.—be in accord with thewishes of those above them. This is absolutely vital; job security depends onit. It is much less important—a luxury that can easily be discarded—that theseperceptions be in accord with actual reality.Communication is only possible between equals.For instance, in the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, the agent had to develop thecapacity to see godless communists everywhere. Any agent whose perceptionsindicated that there were actually very few godless communists anywhere in thiscountry would experience what psychologists call cognitive dissonance: his orher reality grid was at variance with the official reality grid of the pyramidalauthority structure. To talk about such divergent perceptions at all would be toinvite suspicions of eccentricity, of intellectual wiseacreing, or of beingoneself a godless communist. The same would apply to any Dominican Inquisitor ofearlier centuries who lacked the capacity to see witches everywhere. In suchauthoritarian situations, it is important to see what the authorities see; it isinconvenient, and possibly dangerous, to see what is actually there.But this leads to an equal and opposite burden of omniscience on those at thetop, in the Eye of the authoritarian pyramid. All that is forbidden to those atthe bottom—the conscious activities of perception and evaluation—is demanded ofthe master classes, the elite and the super-elite. They must attempt to do theseeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, thinking, and decisionmaking forthe whole society.But a man with a gun (the power to punish) is told only what his target thinkswill not cause him to pull the trigger. The elite, with their burden ofomniscience, face the underlings, with their burden of nescience, and receiveonly the feedback consistent with their own preconceived notions. The burden ofomniscience becomes, in short, another and more complex burden of nescience.Nobody really knows anything anymore, or if they do, they are careful to hidethe fact.As the national security paradigm approaches (or attempts to approach) the idealinfinite regress of spies-spying-on-spies-spying-on-spies, etc., the resultantgeneral trepidation causes all persons to hide anything they know (if it differsfrom the official reality), not only from their superiors, but from peers andinferiors as well. Anybody, after all, might be part of the nth-degree secretpolice. “One can’t be too careful these days.” The burden of nescience becomesomnipresent. More and more of reality becomes unspeakable.But as Freud noted, that which is objectively repressed (unspeakable) soonbecomes subjectively repressed (unthinkable). Nobody likes to feel like a cowardand a liar constantly. It is easier to cease to notice where the officialreality grid differs from sensed experience. Thus Optimum Fuckup graduallybecomes Terminal Fuck-up, and rigiditus bureaucraticus sets in; this is the laststage before all brain activity ceases, and the society is intellectually dead.Celine’s Third Law is like unto the first two, and holds that An honestpolitician is a national calamity.At first glance, this seems preposterous. People of all shades of opinion agreeat least on the axiom that we need more honest politicians, not more crookedones. Please remember, however, that people of all shades of opinion once agreedthat the Earth is flat.Your typical dishonest politician (bocca grande normalis) is interested only inenriching himself at the public expense, a goal he shares with most of hisfellow citizens, especially doctors and lawyers. This is normal behavior for ourprimate species, and society has always been able to endure and survive it.Nobody knows anything, or if they do, they are careful to hide the fact.An honest politician (bocca grande giganticus) is far more dangerous. He or sheis sincerely committed to bettering society by political action. In practice,that means by writing and enacting more laws. Indeed, many groups of idealisticcitizens publish rating sheets on politicians every year, and those who havecreated more laws are estimated as having higher value than those who arefrequently absent when bills are voted upon. The assumption is that adding morelaws to the statute books is a positive achievement, like adding more money toour paychecks or more art works to a museum.A little thought, however, shows that this assumption is not tenable. Every lawcreates a whole new criminal class; for instance, when marijuana was illegalizedin 1937, several hundred thousand formerly law-abiding citizens became criminalsovernight, by Act of Congress. As more and more laws are passed, more and morecitizens become criminals. The chief cause of the rising crime rate is therising number of laws being enacted. An honest politician, who keeps his nose tothe grindstone and enacts several hundred laws in the course of his career,thereby produces as many as several million new criminals.It is furthermore mathematically demonstrable that the more laws there are, themore restrictions there are on the freedom of the individual. If there were,say, only three laws in a given society—e.g., Thou shalt not kill; thou shaltnot steal; thou shalt not lie or defraud—there would be only three restrictionson freedom, which all rational persons would accept as obviously necessary tothe maintenance of order. When there are several hundred thousand laws, as inthese states today, there are several hundred thousand restrictions on freedom,most of which are felt as extremely irksome by large segments of the populace.In fact, it would take a brigade of lawyers several weeks, minutely examiningyour affairs, to determine if you are a criminal. Certainly, no ordinary citizenhas the time or the research facilities to discover if he or she is in violationof one out of the skillions of laws currently on our statute books. In manycases, two lawyers consulted independently will give opposite opinions aboutwhether or not a given course of action is in violation of the statutes.And new laws are being enacted all the time. Obviously, unless there is a suddenpaper shortage, the number of laws on the books will eventually reach the pointsatirized by T. H. White, in which “everything not prohibited is compulsory.” Itwould then probably only take a few years or decades more for a cadre of honestpoliticians diligently writing even more laws to reach the complementary pointwhere “everything not compulsory is prohibited.”Every law creates a whole new criminal class overnight.At that stage the nightmare world of Orwell’s 1984 will be achieved. Crookedpoliticians, merely interested in the normal human activity of making themselvesrich and comfortable, could never create that ultimate horror; but honest andidealistic politicians bring us closer to it every day, with every new law theyenact.These three generalizations—that national security produces national insecurity;that authoritarianism produces miscommunication and eventual idiocy; and thathonest politicians are a plague upon society—will be found to fully explain theDecline and Fall of Rome, the Decline and Fall of the British Empire, and theDecline and Fall of any country you care to name. They are as universal asNewton’s laws of motion and apply to all cases. Of course, the AmericanSociological Association says I am mad. Mad, am I? They said the Wright Brotherswere mad. They said Edison was mad. They said Baron Frankenstein was mad. . . ."},{"pageContent":"BOOKSINFINITE CRUELTY [Contents.html#tch38]BY EPICENE WILDEBLOODAt the age of 30, Raymond Chandler, an American raised in England and thoroughlyimprinted with the stoic code of the English Public School, found himself aplatoon commander in World War I. For nearly a decade Chandler had beenstruggling to establish himself as a writer and had gotten nowhere, forexcellent reasons: his peotry was ninth-rate imitation Swinburne and his essayswere even worse. Now, suddenly separated from what was then called literature,he found himself confronting life and death. Specifically, he led severalcharges against German machine-gun fire.“Courage is a strange thing: one can never be sure of it,” he wrote in a letteryears later. “As a platoon commander very many years ago I never seemed afraid,and yet I have been afraid of the most insignificant risks.” Warming to thesubject, Chandler discussed the psychology of moving forward against amachine-gun nest: “If you had to go over the top, somehow all you seemed tothink of was trying to keep the men spaced, in order to reduce casualties. Itwas always very difficult, especially if you had replacements or men who hadbeen wounded. It’s only human to want to bunch together for companionship in theface of heavy fire.”One day in Hollywood in the 1950s, when Chandler had become rich and famous andthe Black List was speaking louder than the Box Office about who would get hirednext year, J. Edgar Hoover found himself in a restaurant at which Chandler wasdining. Hoover sent a message via a waiter that he would like to speak to themost famous detective-story writer in the country. Chandler’s reply was terseand typical: “Tell Mr. J. Edgar Hoover to go to hell.”That’s what an English education will do for you: Chandler wouldn’t forget the“Mr.” even when telling a man to go to hell; but he would offer no other meed ofgood manners to a thug like Hoover, even if Presidents of the US or reallypowerful presidents of film studios quaked before Hoover’s wrath.People who met Raymond Chandler after he became a celebrity always commentedthat he was nothing like the hero of his novels, Philip Marlowe. FrankMacShane’s Life of Raymond Chandler (1978) makes amply clear how wrong they allwere. Chandler at 5'11\" was an inch and a half shorter than Marlowe; he woreglasses and, it was usually said, “talked like a professor”—which is to say thathe talked like what he was, an English Public School graduate who had majored inclassics. Underneath these superficialities, Chandler was Marlowe and Marlowewas Chandler. The man who told J. Edgar Hoover to go to hell in thewitch-hunting ’50s was the man who, in the novels, is willing to fight alone forhis own concept of decency against oil millionaires, Hollywood producers,corrupt cops, crooked DAs, and the whole power apparatus which has made southernCalifornia the wealthiest right-wing enclave outside Dallas.It took Chandler a long time to create Marlowe. Like Pound’s Hugh SelwynMauberley, Chandler found that WWI “destroyed in him / the artist’s urge.” Hestopped writing his Romantic poetry—what the hell did that have to do with theworld he had seen in the war?—and returned to the land of his birth, where hedidn’t write a line for 15 years. Instead, he deliberately mutated himself froman English esthete into an American businessman: no small feat of neurologicalreprogramming. That he succeeded until the age of 45 is astonishing in itself;that he became a major executive in three oil firms reminds one of Paul Gauguin,another artist who spent most of his life in flight from art.As Chandler later wrote, “I have spent my life on the edge of nothing”—and, inanother place, he added, “Once you have had to lead a platoon into directmachine-gun fire, nothing is ever the same again.” He had a vision of a worldthat was made of glass, a world where anyone could be smashed in an instant,carelessly or maliciously as the case might be, but in any case shattered beyondrepair: no literary technique existed to convey that vision. Chandler spent 15years, the prime years of a man’s life, in the oil-executive game before theDaemon or Holy Guardian Angel that haunts artists got its teeth into him again.Typically, the first symptoms were pathological: he became an alcoholic, andseems to have made a career of it. MacShane makes abundantly clear that becauseof his excellent previous record, Chandler was given a great deal of tolerancebefore the patience of his Board of Directors was exhausted. He was only firedafter several monumental benders in which he stayed drunk for weeks on endwithout coming anywhere near the office.At the age of 45, with a vain and expensive wife, no job, and a heavy alcoholhabit, Chandler had no place to go but up. He stopped drinking and startedwriting again, and in a few years he had created the unique literary form whichis his and his alone, although more widely counterfeited than any othertechnique but Hemingway’s. It was a kind of detective story that had neverexisted before, not even in the bitter and bloody pages of Dashiell Hammett;some purists of the logical-deductive tale even claimed it wasn’t a detectivestory at all.images [images/chap38_ufig_01.jpg]What Chandler had invented, as Edmund Wilson was the first to note, is akin tothe espionage novels of Eric Ambler and Graham Greene, in which “it is notsimply a question here of a puzzle which has been put together but of a malaiseconveyed to the reader, the horror of a hidden conspiracy which is continuallyturning up in the most varied and unlikely forms.” Farewell, My Lovely—aRomantic title for a horrid story—begins with a seemingly senseless murder inLos Angeles’s Black ghetto, but as Marlowe investigates, the reader is ledstep-by-step into every aspect of southern California life, from the mansions ofthe very rich to the gambling casinos run by the Mafia, and the “hiddenconspiracy” is everywhere. Chandler had learned a lot in the oil business, andthe links between rich men with fine manners and delicate sensibilities downthrough corrupt politicians and crooked cops to outright hoodlums andpsychopaths are traced with clinical accuracy, foreshadowing newspaper exposesthat didn’t appear until 30 years after Chandler’s earliest novels. His world isindeed the claustrophobic landscape of Ambler and Greene, and would be aparanoid fantasy anywhere but Los Angeles, where it is simply naturalisticsocial fiction as cool as John O’Hara at his iciest.But Ambler and Greene are, compared to Chandler, relatively humorless writers;it was Chandler’s genius to treat this mean city with so much grotesque andironic comedy that he literally created the modern style of Black Humor threedecades before Lenny Bruce, Joseph Heller, William S. Burroughs, Kurt Vonnegut,Jr., or whoever wrote Illuminatus!As Chandler once wrote in the Atlantic Monthly, “Murder, which is a frustrationof the individual and hence a frustration of the race, may have, and in facthas, a good deal of sociological implications.” Which is only to say that thereare reasons, which most of us would prefer not to know, why America has onemurder every fourteen minutes and the Swedes hardly ever have a violent assault.Digging out these reasons, the frustrations of our culture as exemplified andheightened by the sun-belt hedonism of Los Angeles, is what Chandler’s mysteriesare about. His contempt for the puzzle type of detective story was based on thefact that it was only a puzzle, and didn’t face these implications; as he said,the authors preferred to forget “that murder is an act of infinite cruelty.”Chandler added, hinting at the function of humor in his work, “It is not funnythat a man should be killed, but it is sometimes funny that he should be killedfor so little, and that his death should be the coin of what we callcivilization.” When you have finally untangled the plot of The Little Sister(another deceptively sedate Chandler title for a blood-spattered horror story),the hidden conspiracy goes back to a large studio’s attempt to protect thereputation of a rising actress, and to the decisions of a producer so eccentriche allows his dogs to pee in his office even though it disgusts his secretaries.He can allow his dogs to pee in the office, or anywhere, because he has themoney and power to do whatever the hell he wants. This is satire, yes, but it isdeadly accurate.

FinaleI never saw any of them again —except the cops.No way has yet been invented to saygoodbye to them.It is commonplace to say that the humor of Chandler’s brutal stories lies in thefamous Chandler style. But that style is not merely comic; it is capable ofhaiku-like beauty, and at its best it can say literally anything. For instance,the emotional impact of Chandler’s books lies in something that critics have notwidely discussed: his capacity to render physiological sensations (neurologicalnuances) which most writers have avoided as being totally beyond words. Somehow,Chandler found the words—for the stages of hallucination and pain through whichMarlowe rises gradually to consciousness after being beaten senseless, for theghastly quiet in a room after you have found a dead body, for drug trips thateven the psychedelic writers of the ’60s have not rendered so precisely, for theintolerable boredom and sudden moments of terror that make up an investigator’slife. American English, as it is called—that is a euphemism for underworld andshow-biz slang—joins with classic Engligh English, in Chandler’s style, to formthe most genuine synthesis of Folk Art and High Art we have seen in thiscountry.It is an axiom of bon-ton literary criticism that the style should fit thesubject; Chandler meets that standard with such ease he hardly seems to betrying. When he describes Los Angeles as “a big department store of a city withno more personality than a paper cup,” he is precise the way Ezra Pound isprecise. The department store is the mot juste for both the commercialism andthe startling juxtapositions of L.A.; the paper cup is an emblem of massproduction and quick obsolescence that no Imagist poet could improve. If peopleare being stabbed, shot, beaten, framed, and betrayed all over the landscape, astyle based on deliberate semantic miscegenation (humor in the wrong place,beauty when you least expect it, the continuous shock of jumping from slums tomansions, from dirty police interrogation rooms to jacaranda trees blooming inLaurel Canyon) is a montage of Paradise Lost, a world that could be unspeakablybeautiful if power were not being so relentlessly abused everywhere in it.“In everything that can be called art there is a quality of redemption,”Chandler once wrote. This appears in his novels through the personal honor ofthe hero, Philip Marlowe, but it is only moving and convincing and exemplarybecause Chandler himself believed it and lived it. The most revealing story inMacShane’s biography concerns Chandler’s outrage when a Paramount executiveoffered him a $5,000 bonus to finish a script on time. Since Chandler hadcontracted to finish the script on time, the bonus appeared an insult to him—anhonorable man lives up to a contract signed—and he indignantly refused it. Thisexactly parallels the instances in which Marlowe refuses or returns a client’sfee, because he has failed to do an adequate job—scenes that probably seemincredible to the average reader in this cynical and swinish decade. Such scenesof old-fashioned morality remain powerful because they were written with the oneingredient no writer can fake: total sincerity.What Chandler added to the detective story was not just style and humor andsociological depth; he added his own sense of the mysterious psychology ofcourage—something noboby can ever totally own or totally lose. The eighth orninth layer of humor in his books, when you’ve read them as often as I have,lies in Marlowe’s acute awareness that his courage just possibly might not bethere when he needs it. To know that we live in a world where murder is the“coin of civilization” is to five on the edge of nothing, like theExistentialist; to build a philosophy of courage in the teeth of that high senseof vulnerability is to live with a romantic myth that might collapse abruptly,like Hemingway, who died a suicide; to believe in courage, and in honor, and ineven more old-fashioned virtues, while acknowledging that courage itself mightleave you as rudely as a Hollywood agent slams his door on a fading star, is tolive in the Black Comedy that Chandler captured better than any other novelistof our century.A 1950s poll found that only two artists were equally popular with highbrows andlowbrows. One was, of course, Marilyn Monroe. The other was, deservedly, RaymondChandler. His novels are all still in print even though the earliest of them isset in the 1930s and the last in the early 1950s and they seem superficially“dated.” They are as topical as the latest theory about the Cowboy and Yankeewar among conspiracy buffs. We are still in the world Chandler described, and hehas much to teach us about how to laugh and remain honorable and decent in sucha world. EPICENE WILDEBLOOD is the most highly esteemed literary critic in the UnitedStates. He has never been known to split an infinitive or to descend topleonasm. Due to circumstances beyond his control he has appeared in fourvulgar, common science-fiction novels, where he was not treated gently, and heis still engaged in trying to find his way back to the Real World. “I am not acharacter in fiction,” he insists, “but a critic of fiction. The differenceshould be clear to anyone with a sound mind. Don’t you believe me? Please sayyou believe me.…”Reprinted by permission of City Miner Magazine. P.O. Box 176, Berkeley, CA94701.

Stupidity is partly genetic and partly acquired.A great deal of the human nervous system is on autopilot, like the chimpanzeenervous system.2. The genetic portion of stupidity is programmed into all of us and consists of“typical mammalian behavior.” That is, a great deal of the human nervous systemis on autopilot, like the closely related chimpanzee nervous system and the moredistantly related cow nervous system. The programs of territoriality, packhierarchy, etc., are evolutionarily stable strategies and hence workmechanically, without conscious thought. These evolutionary relative successesbecame genetic programs because they work well enough for the ordinary mammal inordinary mammalian affairs. They only become stupidities in human beings, wherethe higher cortical centers have been developed as a monitoring system to feedback more sophisticated survival techniques and correct these stereotypedprograms with more flexible ones.In short, to the extent that a human follows the genetic primate-pack patterns,without feedback from the cortex, that human is still acting like an ape, andhasn’t acquired facility in using the New Brain.3. The acquired portion of stupidity is the result of enculturation, which isthe process by which the flexible, multivalued human nervous system isbrainwashed into surrendering its flexibility and repeating (miming) thestereotyped behaviors, beliefs, values, etc., of the tribe into which it isborn.4. Primate behavior only changes under the impact of new technology. A band ofchimpanzees will repeat, robotically, the same behaviors over millenniums orlonger; if somebody teaches them how to use sticks to obtain food, or a simplesign language, they will immediately change their behavior under the “shock” ofthis new technology. Human societies (e.g., China, Byzantium) can also remainstatic and repetitious for long times, until new technology triggers newbehaviors.5. Domesticated primates (humans) have changed more in the past hundred yearsthan in all previous history, under the impact of an accelerated acceleration ofnew technologies. The Wright Brothers, Edison, Einstein, Ford, etc., havetriggered more behavior change than all the political revolutionaries, Right orLeft, of this century.6. From points 3, 4, and 5, it follows that the quickest way to change primatebehavior is to introduce a new technology, and that technology is the strongestmedicine that can be administered to cure stupidity or at least to alleviate itsomewhat.7. Genetic behavior changes more rapidly than acquired behavior when newtechnology is introduced, because the genetic code contains what Lorenz calls“holes,” or points of imprint vulnerability, where new imprints (networks of newneurogenetic circuits) can be formed. Shock and confusion, two side-products ofnew technology, trigger this sort of imprint vulnerability.*Primate behavior only changes under the impact of new technology.8. High intelligence is the ability to receive, integrate, and transmit newsignals rapidly. (This follows from Wiener’s Cybernetics, especially his classicdefinition, “To live effectively is to live with adequate information,” and fromShannon’s Mathematical Theory of Communication.)9. Stupidity is a blockage in the ability to receive, integrate, and transmitnew signals rapidly. Genetic programs, if uncorrected by new imprints, can causesuch signal-blindness: genetic behavior is mechanical, “unconscious,”uncorrected by the subtle feedback circuits of the higher nervous centers.Enculturation (identifying the tribal reality map with “reality”) can also causesignal-blindness: signals not consistent with the tribal mythology arerepressed, ignored, covered over with projections or distortions until they dofit the local mythos, or are simply “forgotten” very quickly.Stupidity is a blockage in the ability to receive, integrate, and transmit newsignals.10. Domesticated primates, like wild primates, want chiefly an alpha male tolead them. The more closely this figure approximates the primordialarchetype—i.e., the meanest-tempered baboon in the herd—the more fervently theother primates will follow him. (This explains the otherwise inexplicableelevation to power of distinctly subhuman types, e.g., Mussolini, Nixon, Hitler,Stalin. The primate logic is “If he’s that baaaaaaaad”—in the sense in whichbaaaaaaaad is used in Black ghetto argot—“he’ll scare hell out of competingprimate bands.”)11. After finding an alpha male to lead them, domesticated primates then seek ascapegoat on whom to blame their troubles. They do so because solving problemsrequires intelligence, and there is still more stupidity than intelligence onthis planet. Domesticated primates are not optimistic about solving theirproblems, which seem hopeless in their confused state, midway between mammalianreflexes and objective consciousness. It is easier, to a stupid mind, to findsomebody else to blame for the problems.12. The chief function of the alpha male in a domesticated primate pack is tofind, denounce, and lead the persecution of such scapegoats, internal andexternal.13. To wild primates, as to other mammals, emotions function as emergencysignals, mobilizing energy for “threat” situations, i.e., challenges toterritoriality or to status in the pack hierarchy.14. To domesticated primates, emotions serve both of the above functions, butalso serve two new functions made possible by the new brain and its symbolizingcapacities. These new functions are (1) to stave off boredom and (2) to gainstatus or power.15. Wild primates, like other mammals, have no defense against boredom. Theysimply go to sleep when nothing exciting is happening. (This is also anevolutionarily stable strategy, since it keeps them out of trouble. You are lessvisible to a predator when still than when moving; you are less likely to getyour nose or your paws into a beehive, etc.) Domesticated primates learn, bymimicry of their elders, a skill that has been passed on among hominids formillenniums: how to use emotions to stave off this existential boredom.Domesticated primates are not optimistic about solving their problems. It iseasier to blame somebody.16. The only other way to stave off boredom, in a complex domesticated primatelike humankind, is to increase one’s consciousness and intelligence. This is notappealing to the average primate, who instead invents emotional games(soap-opera and grand-opera dramatics) to keep life exciting. The writings ofEric Berne and the Transactional Analysts are mostly concerned with catalogingthese emotional games, or cons.Emotional games (soap-opera and grand-opera dramatics) keep life exciting.17. Among domesticated primates, emotions also confer status and power. That is,the most emotional person in the room “dominates” everyone else in the room:they must all react to his or her emotions, one way or another, or surrender theturf by retreating from the room entirely.18. Almost all children begin to learn some of these stereotyped emotional gamesor cons from parents and siblings by about the age of two. They then experimentwith these power tactics (mammalian politics) until they have learned how toscore points (symbolic victories) by means of emotional blackmail.19. Very few children ever learn, from parents, teachers, or anybody else, thetechniques of rational problem-solving.20. From 18 and 19, it follows that, on this primitive planet, most people willtry to handle their problems symbolically, by emotional game-playing, andrelatively few will know how to solve their problems rationally.21. Stupidity, being partly genetic, partly acquired by enculturation, andpartly the result of mimicry of emotional status games, is highly contagious.The stupidest party in any situation drags all the others down to his or herlevel. Trying to reason with an emotional person is frustrating, becauseuseless; the only way to “deal” with them, except by escaping the scene, is tochallenge their emotional game with a strong counter-game.22. Since primate behavior can be changed by new technology, the only cure forthe stupidity of the human species must be a technology that itself immediatelyand permanently increases intelligence.23. Such an intelligence-raising technology must be hedonic; i.e., it must offergreater pleasure to the users, or it will not come into wide use very rapidly.24. When such a hedonic intelligence-raising device is invented, the rulers ofsociety will attempt to repress it as a threat to stability.(24a. If such a hedonic intelligence-raising device has been invented, it willhave been repressed. Researchers will have been imprisoned or intimidated;distributors will have been pursued more vigorously than murderers or thieves;the device itself will be pictured as terrible and dangerous in all the massmedia.)25. Until the existence of such a hedonic intelligence-raiser is unambiguouslyproven, certain steps can be taken to decrease stupidity slightly.26. Biosurvival stupidity is imprinted almost immediately after birth, is causedby traumatic fright (due to our primitive child-rearing practices), and takesthe form of chronic anxiety. This is epidemic in our society; a 1968 US PublicHealth survey showed that 85 per cent of the population have some symptom ofchronic anxiety, e.g., heart palpitations, frequent nightmares, dizzy spells,etc. Chronic depression usually accompanies this. In the extreme forms, onefinds autism or catatonia, which are biopsychic or cellular “decisions” thathuman beings are just too nasty to be worth relating to, or paranoia, the fineart of finding enemies everywhere, especially among one’s friends.27. Biosurvival stupidity causes so much stress on the organism, and so muchalienation from other humans, that it creates stupidity on all the other neuralcircuits as well, and thereby prevents the development of a high level ofintelligence on any circuit.28. Biosurvival stupidity can be alleviated by the practice of various martialarts (akido, karate, kung fu, etc.); by asana, the yogic technique of holdingone posture for long periods of time every day; or by psychotherapy. Asana andpsychotherapy take much longer to produce dramatic effects than martial arts do,but may be necessary in acute cases.Biosurvival stupidity can be alleviated by martial arts.29. Emotional stupidity is imprinted when the toddler is first learning “familypolitics” (mammalian hierarchy games). Typically, the victim confronts allproblematic situations in interpersonal relations with one stereotyped emotionalgame (e.g., a good long sulk, a temper tantrum, “depression,” a drunken bender,suicide threats, howling or blustering in traditional angry-primate manner,etc). One or another of these robotic emotional reflexes can be found in about99 per cent of the population.30. Emotional stupidity can be alleviated by the yogic breathing technique knownas pranayama, or by the Gurdjieff techniques of establishing an internal“Observer” who monitors the emotional reflexes, i.e., makes them consciousinstead of mechanical. Pranayama produces quicker results; the Gurdjiefftechniques ultimately produce deeper, more long-lasting results.Emotional stupidity can be alleviated by pranayama.31. Semantic stupidity is imprinted when the older child begins dealing withwords and concepts (abstract artifacts produced by the higher brain centersafter the human stock separated out from the other primates). The most pervasiveform of semantic stupidity consists of confusing the local (tribal) reality mapwith the all of reality. Dogmatism, rigid ideological systems, and bizarrereality maps (ideational schizophrenias) are also rampant. Symbol-blindness,ranging from verbal illiteracy to mathematical or artistic illiteracy, is alsocommon, and often found in those who are very skillful in handling one narrowrange of symbols; e.g., the painter who can’t solve a quadratic equation, thescientist who can’t or won’t read poetry, etc.32. Semantic stupidity can be alleviated by a diet rich in lecithin and protein,by courses in remedial reading, logic, and scientific method, and by practice inGeneral Semantics.33. Sociosexual stupidity is imprinted when the DNA blueprint triggers themutation to puberty. It consists of robotic repetition of one stereotypedsex-role, usually accompanied by a deep-seated conviction that all othersex-roles are abnormal (“mad” or “bad”).34. The only alleviations for sociosexual stupidity currently available are thevarious forms of psychotherapy, of which Group Encounter is probably mosteffective.35. Alleviating or totally curing these four types of stupidity would producehuman beings roughly matching the idealistic definition given by Robert Heinleinin Time Enough For Love:“A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher ahog, design a building, conn a ship, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build awall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, actalone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer,cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.”36. Roughly speaking, if you can handle 14 out of Heinlein’s 21 programs, youhave released images [images/2by3.jpg] of your potential intelligence, and areimages [images/2by3.jpg] of a human being. If you can handle seven of them, youare images [images/1by3.jpg] of a human being. Scores above 14 mean you’reprobably a genius and probably know it; scores below 7 mean you’re certainly amoron, and certainly don’t know it (i.e., you are convinced, are you not, thatthe world is really a terrible place and that your inability to cope is due tothe world’s evil rather than to your own stupidity?).If the world seems to be getting nastier, your stupidity is increasing.37. A quicker intelligence test, which also indicates the trajectory of yourdevelopment, is this:If the world seems to be getting bigger and funnier all the time, yourintelligence is steadily increasing.If the world seems to be getting smaller and nastier all the time, yourstupidity is steadily increasing.___________* For further information on the role of shock in forming new imprints, seeTimothy Leary, Exo-Psychology.

But the seeds he planted—little tiny Spirochetes, so to speak—havebloomed everywhere, and a new age of irrationalism is upon us. In particular, anew, improved strain of the old Puritan virus is loose in the land, representedon the right hand by Nixon’s Supreme Court and on the left hand by thefascisto-feminist wing of Women’s Liberation.To a libertarian there is one rule in love as in all life: non-invasiveness. Donot enter somebody’s physical or mental “space” unless invited. This is rootedin ethology, in the biological basis of animal life, and was defined, in purelylogical terms even before ethology emerged as a science, by Benjamin Tucker. Therule of non-invasiveness, also stated by Warren as “Mind Your Own Business,”means, when applied to sex, that when people make sexual overtures to you, youhave a perfect right to say “Yes!” or “No!” as bluntly as necessary and withouttoo excessive a worry about hurting their feelings or damaging their preciousegos. They have entered your territory, and it is for you to decide whether towelcome them or chase them out. However, whatever they are doing without yourparticipation, whether it be coupling in twos or in threes or in Mongolianclusters; whether it be hetero or homo or involves German shepherds, is none ofyour business, and you scarcely have the right to hold an opinion about it. Or,if you must have an opinion, you still owe them a decent respect for theirprivacy and should offer your words as a suggestion, not as a DivineCommandment.This is simple and straightforward, and, even before the invention oflibertarian ideology, has generally been accepted by highly educated men andwomen in all civilizations, although it clearly goes against the grain of mostmajor religions.Puritanism takes the opposite position, and Mencken was quite accurate indefining it as “the haunting fear that somebody, somewhere, might be having agood time.” The Puritan feels that what other people are doing in the privacy oftheir boudoirs, even if it doesn’t affect him physically, is of paramountimportance and must be supervised and policed. Some health-food crusaders steerquite close to oral Puritanism in their obsession that everybody else eat the“right” diet.The old, right-wing Puritanism generally favored heterosexuality, within legal(and, preferably, religious) monogamy. The new, left-wing Puritanism generallyfavors homosexuality or masturbation and regards heterosex as the Devil’sWorkshop. The emotional tone and the desire to butt into other people’s privatelives is the same in both cases; both are fascistoid and anti-libertarian.Puritanism invades libertarian groups via the old Marxists (who were alwaysPuritans) and the new feminists (who are not always Puritans). The key was theword “sexism,” which originally had a specific meaning akin to “racism.” Thatis, just as racism consists of a stereotyped negative response to a whole classof human beings selected by racial characteristics, sexism denoted, originally,a stereotyped negative response to another whole class of human beings selectedby sexual characteristics. Words, however, do not often retain one simplemeaning, as the semanticists know, and “sexism” soon acquired a penumbra ofsecondary and irrelevant associations. Pornography became “sexist,” eroticabecame “sexist,” and eventually, freedom itself became “sexist.”For perfect precision, let me include here an attempted neurosemantic analysisof the Puritan reflexes. Although this analysis is technical, it is also, Ihope, free of the ambiguities of most polemic on this subject.The old, conservative Puritanism and the new, radical Puritanism are both basedon phobic imprinting of the second neurological circuit (the motion-emotioncircuit), together with identification reflexes in the third (semantic) circuitand further phobic imprinting of the fourth (sociosexual) circuit.To quote Leary,“Phylogenetically the second neural circuit evolved in the early Palaeozoicperiod (500 million years B.C.), when the first vertebrates and amphibians beganto rise up against and free themselves from the pull of gravity. The ability todominate, locomote, and exert superior force became a survival asset. Theemotional circuit of man’s nervous system is thus an emergency device. When thehuman being acts in an emotional way, he or she is reverting to a most primitivephase of brute rage or terror.”Both the Old Puritanism and the New Puritanism are forms of emotional plague.Basic emotions are imprinted upon the second circuit during the crawling andtoddling stages of infancy. Puritanism is imprinted when the child is taughtaversive, loathing, shameful reflexes toward its own anal-genital parts. Theparental figures first exhibit these reactions themselves, then withdraw lovewhen the infant fails to exhibit the same reactions, then reward (reinforce) theinfant for learning to exhibit these reactions. Permanent emotions of shame andguilt are thus imprinted, with considerable blurring of anal and genitaldistinctions.These emotions, being largely glandular, function mechanically, as Gurdjieffemphasized. There is no so-called “free will,” “autonomy,” or “human dignity” onthe emotional level. As Leary says so precisely, “Emotions are the lowest formof consciousness.… Emotions are caused by biochemical secretions in the body toserve during the state of acute emergency. An emotional person is a blind,crazed maniac.” Imprinted phobic emotions are the cause of that state of“chronic low-grade emergency” epidemic in our culture, according to Perls,Hefferline, Goodman (Gestalt Therapy). The phobic person enters each situationwith the emergency reflexes already turned on.There is no free will or human dignity on the emotional level.The imprinting of the third, semantic circuit occurs when the child beginshandling and questioning. This circuit “mediates fine, precise muscularactivities, especially speech” (Leary). Depending on parental imprintingtechniques, the child can learn to handle and question freely or to be clumsy,stupid, timid, fearful, etc. Usually, the imprint encourages dexterity andfluency in some areas and total taboo in others.The blurring of anal and genital, characteristic of Puritanism, is herereinforced by parental vocabulary. The key words applying anal imagery to thegenitalia are “dirty,” “filthy,” “barnyard morals,” “open sewer of pornography,”“pig,” “animal,” etc. “Smut,” from Old English smotten, to blacken or stain, cf.smudge, acts to generalize the anal phobia beyond sex to anything dark,including black humans, who are often irrationally feared or hated by both theold Puritans and the new Puritans.The anality of the old Puritans was generally low-profile and “buried in thelanguage,” through the constant dirt metaphor associated with genitality, or insuch expressions as “Don’t be piggy, Johnny.” The new Puritans represent anunconscious irruption of these elements. Their favorite word is “shit,” whichcan appear as often as twice or more in each sentence. Jokes, of a childishnature, about flatulence are omnipresent and compulsive in their writings. The“pig” archetype is everywhere. When they rise above this infantile semantics, onoccasion, it is only to the adolescent level of compulsive masturbationmetaphor.Thus, the Puritan personality starts from aversive emotional imprints, which arethen complicated by a special reinforcing vocabulary associating all sexualitywith the anal shit-dirt-mess aversion reflexes. The semantic imprint functionsin harmony with the emotional-glandular imprint.The fourth, sociosexual circuit is then imprinted with a “Mr. District Attorney”or “Holy Inquisitor” persona. Stimuli in the external world which trigger theanal guilt-shame reflexes in the Puritan are mediated through the semanticcircuit, where the “smut” or “sexism” or whatever label is affixed, and theemotion is discharged by attacking the person who was the source of the stimuli.The Pig Archetype is everywhere: “Don’t be piggy, Johnny!”As Korzybski points out in Science and Sanity, this habitual confusion betweeninternal evaluation and external stimuli is a neurosemantic habit acquired fromtraditional education. In general semantics, this habit is called“identification.” It is comparable to the conditioned reflexes observed byBehaviorists in animal studies; although normal for animals, it is abnormal forhumans. It short-circuits the higher, cortical functions, and leaves the personoperating on thalamic circuits only, thereby preventing the characteristicallyhuman functions of reason, science, creativity, invention, etc.IDENTIFICATION IS THUS A MILD FORM OF HALLUCINATION. Those who identify theirown imprinted emotional-glandular response with the external stimuli, forinstance, cannot imagine how the stimuli appear to someone else who has not hadtheir imprinting. In Korzybski’s metaphor, they act as if the map is theterritory (or as Alan Watts says, they act as if the menu is the meal). Theirown emotions are all that is real to them, in a taboo area covered by phobicimprint, and they have never experienced any stimuli in that area withoutanxiety, in a neutral or objective way.As psychologist Theodore Schroeder pointed out, “obscenity” is the modern formof “black magic.” Both concepts are operationally meaningless; there is noinstrument which, pointed at a book or painting, will tell how much “blackmagic” or “obscenity” is in it. These things are in the nervous system of theobserver, imprinted in the manner described above. Attributing them to books,art, ideas, etc., in the external world, and seeking to punish the perpetrators,is the same kind of hallucination that produced the witch-hunts in which ninemillion innocents were killed.Clarification of this issue explains what the Buddhists mean by “maya.” Onecould lead a group of both old Puritans and new Puritans through a galleryfeaturing photographs of flowers without any problem arising, even thoughflowers are the genitals of plants, as everyone who passed Botany 101 knows.However, try to navigate that group through an exhibit of photos of animalgenitalia and almost anything could happen, when the emotional imprints areactivated. The external stimuli (natural sexuality) are the same, but theimprints are different. Contemplation of this parable should clarify what Buddhameant in saying that most people see only their own “maya” and never experienceobjective fact at all. Of course, if the exhibit featured human genitalia, thefourth and third circuits would be activated, and a great deal of angry speechabout “smut” from the first group and “sexism” from the second would be heard.All of this speech would confuse the internal glandular-emotional emergencyimprint with the objective external stimuli, and there would be a desire topunish the photographer.Emotional Identification is a mild form of hallucination.This confusion of map with territory cannot be removed by argument or evenconditioning, since it rests upon imprinting. Any attempt to discuss the problemrationally leads, inevitably, sooner or later, to some of the taboo words,phrases, associations, etc., which trigger the emergency reflexes again, and therage reflexes, as always, follow swiftly. It is even dangerous to defend anyperson chosen as a target for the punishing discharge of the Puritans’ fear-ragesecretions. The defender becomes the next target, as in the witch-hunts of thepast.Reich distinguished between neurosis, which is painful only to the carrier, andemotional plague, which is dangerous to anyone living in the same society withthe carrier. In this sense, both conservative old Puritanism and radical newPuritanism are emotional plague, and the carriers are neurosemantic TyphoidMarys. No amount of sympathy for the carriers should blind us to the fact oftheir social role. Dr. Wilhelm Reich and Dr. Timothy Leary, the only scientiststo dare to confront this problem directly, were railroaded into prison, not inNazi Germany or Soviet Russia, but in the allegedly secular, supposedlyscientific United States. “An emotional person is a blind, crazed maniac,” andthe new Puritans, having an ideology which justifies them in indulging emotionand in refusing to attempt even an effort at reasonableness or fairness, areprobably more dangerous than the old.As soon as this analysis is understood, it should be, as far as possible,forgotten. The only way to deal with the new Puritans is the same way thelibertarian deals with all human beings: non-invasively, rationally. One mustact always as if the other party is a free, rational mind and never get draggedinto their own childish and hysterical milieu. If they state that your positionis pissy, shitty, and piggy, ignore that. Do not fall into replying in kind bystating that THEIR position is pissy, shitty, and piggy. Explain the libertarianposition logically and clearly, as if you were dealing with rational adults.This will, in the long run, perform the one moral form of segregation: drawingall judicious observers onto one side of the issue and all the fools onto theother.MARVIN GARDENS is the author of two best-selling novels (Vlad the Barbarian,Vlad Victorious) and is the founder and chairman of the Linda Lovelace forPresident Committee.

I don’t think there is, or ever again canbe, a cure for unemployment. I propose that unemployment is not a disease, butthe natural, healthy functioning of an advanced technological society.The inevitable direction of any technology, and of any rational species such asHomo Sap., is toward what Buckminster Fuller calls ephemeralization, ordoing-more-with-less. For instance, a modern computer does more (handles morebits of information) with less hardware than the proto-computers of the late’40s and ’50s. One worker with a modern teletype machine does more in an hourthan a thousand medieval monks painstakingly copying scrolls for a century.Atomic fission does more with a cubic centimeter of matter than all theengineers of the 19th century could do with a million tons, and fusion does evenmore.Unemployment is not a disease; so it has no “cure.”This tendency toward ephemeralization or doing-more-with-less is based on twoprincipal factors, viz:1. The increment-of-association, a term coined by engineer C. H. Douglas,meaning simply that when we combine our efforts we can do more than the sum ofwhat each of us could do separately. Five people acting synergetically togethercan lift a small modern car, but if each of the five tries separately, the carwill not budge. As society evolved from tiny bands, to larger tribes, tofederations of tribes, to city-states, to nations, to multinational alliances,the increment-of-association increased exponentially. A stone-age hunting bandcould not build the Parthenon; a Renaissance city-state could not put NeilArmstrong on the Moon. When the increment-of-association increases, throughlarger social units, doing-more-with-less becomes increasingly possible.2. Knowledge itself is inherently self-augmenting. Every discovery “suggests”further discoveries; every innovation provokes further innovations. This can beseen, concretely, in the records of the US Patent Office, where you will findmore patents granted every year than were granted the year before, in a risingcurve that seems to be headed toward infinity. If inventor A can make a Whatsitout of 20 moving parts, inventor B will come along and build a Whatsit of 10moving parts, inventor C of 5 moving parts. If the technology of 1900 can get100 ergs out of a Whatchamacallum, the technology of 1950 can get 1,000 ergs,2000 can get 100,000 ergs. Again, the tendency is always towarddoing-more-with-less. *Unemployment is directly caused by this technological capacity todo-more-with-less. Thousands of monks were technologically unemployed byGutenberg. Thousands of blacksmiths were technologically unemployed by Ford’sModel T. Each device that does-more-with-less makes human labor that much lessnecessary.Aristotle said that slavery could only be abolished when machines were builtthat could operate themselves. Working for wages, the modern equivalent ofslavery—very accurately called “wage slavery” by social critics—is in theprocess of being abolished by just such self-programming machines. In fact,Norbert Wiener, one of the creators of cybernetics, foresaw this as early as1947 and warned that we would have massive unemployment once the computerrevolution really got moving.It is arguable, and I for one would argue, that the only reason Wiener’sprediction has not totally been realized yet—although we do have ever-increasingunemployment—is that the big unions, the corporations, and government have alltacitly agreed to slow down the pace of cybernation, to drag their feet and runthe economy with brakes on. This is because they all, still, regard unemploymentas a “disease” and cannot imagine a “cure” for the nearly total unemploymentthat full cybernation will create.Suppose, for a moment, we challenge this Calvinistic mind-set. Let us regardwage-work—as most people do, in fact, regard it—as a curse, a drag, a nuisance,a barrier that stands between us and what we really want to do. In that case,your job is the disease, and unemployment is the cure.“But without working for wages we’ll all starve to death!?! Won’t we?”Not at all. Many farseeing social thinkers have suggested intelligent andplausible plans for adapting to a society of rising unemployment. Here are someexamples.1. The National Dividend. This was invented by engineer C. H. Douglas and hasbeen revived with some modifications by poet Ezra Pound and designerBuck-minster Fuller. The basic idea (although Douglas, Pound, and Fuller differon details) is that every citizen should be declared a shareholder in thenation, and should receive dividends on the Gross National Product for the year.Estimates differ as to how much this would be for each citizen, but at thecurrent level of the GNP it is conservative to say that a share would be worthseveral times as much, per year, as a welfare recipient receives—at least fivetimes more.Critics complain that this would be inflationary. Supporters of the NationalDividend reply that it would only be inflationary if the dividends distributedwere more than the GNP; and they are proposing only to issue dividends equal tothe GNP.2. The Guaranteed Annual Income. This has been urged by economist RobertTheobald and others. The government would simply establish an income level abovethe poverty line and guarantee that no citizen would receive less; if your wagesfall below that level, or you have no wages, the government makes up thedifference.This plan would definitely cost the government less than the present welfaresystem, with all its bureaucratic red tape and redundancy: a point worthconsidering for those conservatives who are always complaining about the highcost of welfare. It would also spare the recipients the humiliation,degradation, and dehumanization built into the present welfare system: a pointfor liberals to consider. A system that is less expensive than welfare and alsoless debasing to the poor, it seems to me, should not be objectionable toanybody but hardcore sadists.3. The Negative Income Tax. This was devised by Nobel economist Milton Friedmanand is a less radical variation on the above ideas. The Negative Income Taxwould establish a minimum income for every citizen; anyone whose income fellbelow that level would receive the amount necessary to bring them up to thatstandard. Friedman, who is sometimes called a conservative but prefers to titlehimself a libertarian, points out that this would cost “the government” (i.e.,the taxpayers) less than the present welfare system, like Theobald’s GuaranteedAnnual Income. It would also dispense with the last tinge of humiliationassociated with government “charity,” since when you cashed a check from 1RSnobody (not even your banker) would know if it was supplementary income due topoverty or a refund due to overpayment of last year’s taxes.4. The RICH Economy. This was devised by inventor L. Wayne Benner (coauthor withTimothy Leary of Terra II) in collaboration with the present author. It’s afour-stage program to retool society for the cybernetic and space-age future weare rapidly entering. RICH means Rising Income through Cybernetic Homeostasis.Stage I is to recognize that cybernation and massive unemployment are inevitableand to encourage them. This can be done by offering a $100,000 reward to anyworker who can design a machine that will replace him or her, and all othersdoing the same work. In other words, instead of being dragged into thecybernetic age kicking and screaming, we should charge ahead bravely, regardingthe Toilless Society as the Utopian goal humanity has always sought.Stage II is to establish either the Negative Income Tax or the Guaranteed AnnualIncome, so that the massive unemployment caused by Stage I will not throw hordesof people into the degradation of the present welfare system.Stage III is to gradually, experimentally, raise the Guaranteed Annual Income tothe level of the National Dividend suggested by Douglas, Bucky Fuller, and EzraPound, which would give every citizen the approximate living standard of thecomfortable middle class. The reason for doing this gradually is to pacify thoseconservative economists who claim that the National Dividend is “inflationary”or would practically wreck the banking business by lowering the interest rate tonear-zero. It is our claim that this would not happen as long as the totaldividends distributed to the populace equaled the Gross National Product. Butsince this is a revolutionary and controversial idea, it would be prudent, weallow, to approach it in slow steps, raising the minimum income perhaps 5 percent per year for the first ten years. And, after the massive cybernation causedby Stage I has produced a glut of consumer goods, experimentally raise itfurther and faster toward the level of a true National Dividend.Stage IV is a massive investment in adult education, for two reasons. (1) Peoplecan spend only so much time fucking, smoking dope, and watching TV; after awhile they get bored. This is the main psychological objection to the worklesssociety, and the answer to it is to educate people for functions more cerebralthan fucking, smoking dope, watching TV, or the idiot jobs most are currentlytoiling at. (2) There are vast challenges and opportunities confronting us inthe next three or four decades, of which the most notable are those highlightedin Tim Leary’s SMI2LE slogan—Space Migration, Intelligence Increase, LifeExtension. Humanity is about to enter an entirely new evolutionary relationshipto space, time, and consciousness. We will no longer be limited to one planet,to a brief, less-than-a-century lifespan, and to the stereotyped and roboticmental processes by which most people currently govern their lives. Everybodydeserves the chance, if they want it, to participate in the evolutionary leap towhat Leary calls “more space, more time, and more intelligence to enjoy spaceand time.”What I am proposing, in brief, is that the Work Ethic (find a Master to employyou for wages, or live in squalid poverty) is obsolete. A Work Esthetic willhave to arise to replace this old Stone Age syndrome of the slave, the peasant,the serf, the prole, the wage-worker—the human labor-machine who is not fully aperson but, as Marx said, “a tool, an automaton.” Delivered from the role ofthings and robots, people will learn to become fully developed persons, in thesense of the Human Potential movement. They will not seek work out of economicnecessity, but out of psychological necessity—as an outlet for their creativepotential.(“Creative potential” is not a panchres-ton. It refers to the inborn drive toplay, to tinker, to explore, and to experiment, shown by every child before hisor her mental processes are stunted by authoritarian education andoperant-conditioned wage-robotry.)As Bucky Fuller says, the first thought of people, once they are delivered fromwage-slavery, will be, “What was it that I was so interested in as a youth,before I was told I had to earn a living?” The answer to that question, comingfrom millions and then billions of persons liberated from mechanical toil, willmake the Renaissance look like a high school science fair or a Greenwich Villageart show.

Abridge that gets you across the river without your having to stop and build araft is wealth in this sense. So is an airport. So is the furniture in yourhouse. Think of ten other examples.Illth, a term coined by John Ruskin, can be conceived as all the changes in theenvironment that are detrimental to humanity and/or to life itself. Weaponry,then, should be classed as illth, not wealth. Think of ten other examples.Money is neither wealth nor illth but merely tickets for the transfer of wealthor illth.Proof: if all the money disappeared overnight, the national standard of livingwould not change (whatever happened to individuals in the interim); things wouldbe back to normal as soon as the Treasury printed more tickets. But if all thereal wealth and illth—all the industrial plant, natural resources, roads,communications, and “real capital” generally—were to disappear, we would beplunged back into the Stone Ages and no issue of currency would improve thesituation.Note also that for all the “real capital” to disappear, all the technicalknowhow in human heads would have to vanish. No economist, to my knowledge, hastried to calculate how much of our “real capital” consists of ideas in humanheads (brain power) and/or of canned ideas stored in libraries or on tape. Areasonable guess is that 90 per cent of our wealth and illth consists of suchbrain creations."},{"pageContent":" About the AuthorVisionary, humorist, novelist, playwright, poet, popular science writer,libertarian philosopher, adept—Robert Anton Wilson is a man of many parts.One of the founders of the Institute for the Study of Human Future, Robert AntonWilson is also a director of the Prometheus Society, a Maryland-based lobbygroup engaged in promoting the scientific search for immortality.
