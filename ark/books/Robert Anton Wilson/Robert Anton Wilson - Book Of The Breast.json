Why are we so obsessed, even worshipful, of breasts? The reasons have little to do with fashions or fads. They are essentially biological, evolutionary. Look around you and count the number of people you see smoking, or chewing gum, or biting their fingernails, or eating too many potato chips, or gnawing the edge of their mustaches. We are oral creatures, always in search of a breast. Our world view is formed in large part during those first seven months of our lives when we are being nursed by breasts or breast substitutes. But it isn't just the milk that attracts us. It's our sexual nature. In fact, the human breast evolved to its present size-proportionally large compared to other mammalsn-more to suit the needs of adult sexuality than infant feeding. Combine the instinctive drives of hunger and sex, focus them on two catenary curves that promise fulfillment, and you have a force powerful enough to shape civilizations, inspire artists and poets, and give visual, tactile and emotional pleasure to each individual male. A word about the photographs: Some peo- ple will tell you that they are sinful or sexist. Pay them no heed. They are a dying breed,like the duckbilled platypus, and you will outlive them. Robert A.

When ganders are pr'ogr'zrr.nmed properll' by theil rnothers, they fall in love just like humans and form pair-bonds (the prehuman origin of rvhat rve call man'iages) that usually last for'life.

Wilhelm Reich said that traumas received during nursing from mothers who are uptight about their mammalian functions are \"the source of the human ne\"-fls dawn of the feeling that there's something \\\\'rong with the universe and it has to be fixed as bloodily and quickly as possible. We don't know lvhat sort of nursing experiences little Adolf Schicklgruber had, but bv the time he was going to school Hitler already had a strong dislike of girls and grew angry whenever thel' tried to kiss him. Ninety-r-nillion people died in the course of his attempt to correct the univelse. Women's liberationists often seem to think that the breast is rather atavistic and should go the way of the tonsils and the vermiform appendix to the dustbin of evolution. Whether they are right or not-and the author of this book can be expected to consider them wrong-the vast changes many of these ladies expect in human society probably cannot be accom- plished without some such demammalization. As long as little boys (and little girls) are nursed at the breast, certain condi- tioned expectations about womanhood will be re-created every generation. These expectations, of course, do not need to coexist with systematic economic exploitation of rvomen and can easily accommodate much more equality than is now practiced, but they sharply conflict with any attempt to create the sexless, anthill socialism the extreme liberationists want. Actually, there is reason to believe that the distinctly human breast is a response to adult sexuality rather than to the needs of the newborn. That is, the large size of the human female breast is not an evolutionary ans\\\\'er to demands made by infants as infants but rather to the needs of these infants after they were imprinted and grew up to incorporate the breast quest into their adult sexuality.

The characteristic breasts of the hunran female, Mon'is believes, are a result of standing erect. The other apes occa- sionally shamble about in a semierect position but usually go on all fours-even the gorilla leans forward and trails his fingers on the ground when upright and goes back to quadru- pedal motion 'nvhen he's leally in a hurry. Hunran beings, Morris points out, are also the only mammal species to copu- late in a face-to-face position. This, it seems plausible to suggest, is because of our habit of standing to face each other during uerbcil intercourse-it seems \"natural,\" or at least desirable, to also face eacir other whiie lying down for sexual intercourse. But the buttocks, rvhich play a large role in sexual excitation with other apes, do not get much attention this way; ergo, savs Molris, the human female has developed irn itation bttttocks on her chest. Like most nerv ideas in science, this sottnds absurd at first sight-as if we were being tolci that the long nose has devel- oped as an imitation penis. Well, evolution has many such crude girnmicks (nature is a primitive artist), and it so happens that we have a biological cousin rvhose nose tloes appear to be a penis surrogate. This is the fauous \"pnrple-assed\" baboon, or mandrill-the despised, evil-tempered species which plays a distinctly negative role in African folklore. (This ugly beast was even compared to the Chicago Police Department by Terry Southern during the Democratic Convention of 1968.) While ordinary zoo visitols remember chiefly the mandrill's spectac- ular rump, and Africans rvho have to live with his presence talk much about his sullen bad temper, ethologists have long wondered why his nose and cheeks are marked so as to resemble his penis and testicles. It has finally been decided that tlris is probably a se.i'r{aL signalitt.cl de\"-ir:e, on a much cruder and more direct level than the peacock's famous tail, the male deer's antlers or the beards ol mustaches you and I wear to notify women, \"Hey, look, I'm male!\" The mandrill, true to his clumsy nature, has just found the most blatant way of conveying thtrt ruessage.

Tlne tit-note the overtones and emotional ambience of the word-is sexual, an outgrowth of the primor- dial teat, which was just nourishing. Morris even points out that the young, both of our species and of other apes, find it easier to nurse at small, flattish breasts. The bigbazoom is not primarily for babies. It is for men. Is it also, as Morris urges, a substitute buttock? This seems scientifically plausible. A man standing erect (and perhaps otherwise erect), moving toward a woman who wishes to be mounted, is confronted by the rounded curves of her breasts in much the same way that the other, quadrupedal, apes sham- bling toward a female of their species who is waiting to be mounted see the similar rounded curves of the derriere. Nevertheless, likely as all this sounds, it is only scientific truth, laboratory truth, and one can't keep a straight face while trying to contemplate it outside the laboratory' It is definitely not advisable to think about it in the bedroom; you might burst out laughing at the wrong time. Imitation butt or not, the breasts certainly signal an unam- biguously sexual message. When Howard Hughes produced The Outlaw and introduced Jane Russell to the horny Ameri- can public of the 1940s, he originally advertised it by having a skywriting airplane inscribe in the heavens above Los Angeles the following tasteful sales pitch: THE OUTLAW oo Nobody had any trouble deciphering the symbolism. The demand for the movie was so great that even though censor- ship problems postponed its American release for nearly a decade, and we all had ample chance to inspect Miss Russell's attributes in several other films during the interlude, The Outlaw was still a box-office smash when the censors finally let it out with only a few cuts. Although Miss Russell later became something of a singer and dancer and even an actress by the standards of those days, and further distinguished ,2"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Figure 2: Jane Russell's breasts ttere literally praised in the skies by Howard Hughes, CourtesY of the Penguin Collection herself by joining a very primitive Fundamentalist church and issuing such theological pronouncements as \"God is a living doll,\" she is still chiefly remembered for the fact that from the side she somewhat resembled a filing cabinet with fihe top drawer pulled all the way out (see Figure 2). Walter Winchell, the popular columnist of the period, was calling breasts \"janerussells\" in her honor for over a decade. This is hardly unique. Ever since people became erect, and even though there are still many happily atavistic \"ass men\" among us, the front elevation of the female form (as an architect would call it) dominates sexual art and fantasy, and in that elevation the breasts are quite a bit more visible than the vulva. More: We are in the strange position of being the sexiest animal on this planet, a fact long noted by Christian theolo- gians who attribute it to Original Sin. In fact, as ethologists have commented, it seems to be the result of our peculiar weakness at birth and that all-important nursing period which we have already stressed so much. The newborn human cannot survive without a mother. But the human mother could not cope with the hazards and creatures of the wild, especially burdened with an infant, unless she persuaded a male to hang around and help her. Ergo, some form of the family was inevitable. It doesn't have to be the monogamous Judeo-Christian family, of course; it may be polygynous, poly- androus, polygamous or the \"group marriage\" of sexual com- munism in the tribe or the hippie commune, but it will be a family: A place where the young are tended until they can tend themselves. There are many forces that can and have held families together, but the one that actually performs the lion's share of the job throughout human evolution is sex. It is that simple. Although other animals are less inhibited about sex-less mental, less worried and less squeamish-it is a fallacy to think that they are therefore sexier than we are. Anyone who uses expressions like \"barnyard morals\" or \"acting like an animal\" (to castigate a human being who seems to be enjoying sex more than the speaker) is talking nonsense. A man with \"barnyard morals\" or who \"acted like an animal\" would be much less sexy than the average human. The human being is the only animal without a limited mating season: The only one who is ready, willing and able to 24"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"have sex all year long. This fact, together with our nakedness or conspicuous lack of body fur-rvhich may also be sexual, according to Desmond Morris-distinguislles us ft'om all other mammals and our closest relatives in the primate familv. Somehow, somewhere in evolution, the human or protohu- man female mutated and leaped out of the estrus cycle of other apes. She \\r'as, so to speak, in heat all year long. And this persuaded the human male to remain with her all year long instead of just visiting at mating time, and formed the founda- tion of human society-the primordial family. This constant sexiness or randiness may be the Original Sin, as Fundamentalists think, but we would not be human with- out it. We probably shecl our fur to make our naked bodies more conspicuous; we developed a year-long rutting season; we huddled together into families (monogamous or otherwise) and we became sonrething entirely new in nature. Without this great leap forward into sempiternal horniness we would have remained like the other beasts. And the sexual signaling system on the female front eleva- tion became the center of our thoughts and feelings. It could hardly be otherwise. Going around on all fours, using the normal mammalian position for copulation (\"doggie fashion,\" it is called by city dwellers), our ape cousins do not get breasts involved in their sexuality. Oul direct ancestors, as soon as they stood up, began to notice the territory between the head and the vagina, and-since love and sex were easily mergecl before Christianity arose to drive a wedge between them-this brought back cozy rnemories of infancy. Women were scarcely passive about this, of course, since the breast is a center of very strong sexual feelings, as indicated in the celebrated limerick: There was a young girl from Dumfries Who said to her beau, \"If you please, It would give nre great bliss If while playing with this You would pay some attention to thesel\" On this foundation grer.l' the entire structure of oral sexuali- ty, to the great delight of millions throughout history and the perpetual scandal of the clergy.

Whoever she was and whatever her thought, she did more for human happiness than all the politicians and revolutionaries of history. Oral sex, indeed, rvould be an extremely unlikelv invention lvithout the suckling experience of infancy among ourselves, our primate ancestors, and the mammals from whom we sprung. The art has been carefully (almost remorselessly) analyzed by Gershon Legman in his curious Orugenito,Lism: ArL Encyclopedia of Techniques, which catalogs hundreds of varia- tions (and demonstrates mathenratically that there are mil- lions of other possibilities which the author hasn't bothered to tabulate)-and yet all of these are within the three main divisions of cunnilingus, fellatio and the 69 ot' soirante-neu-f. Legman doesn't bother rn'ith the variations of breast oralism, the \"trip around the world,\" in which the whole body is licked and sucked, or the peculiar Oriental delights of toe-nibbling and finger-sucking. A real zrttempt to catalog all tlie sexual uses of the human mouth would undoubtedly run into several volumes; if it were exhaustive in its descriptions, it could easily be heftier than a complete set of the EncycLopaedia Britannica. (For instance, although sexological writers in English gen- erally use the one word fellatio for all varieties of cocksucking, the Romans had two words for two great divisions, irrespec- tive of position. Thus, in feLLatio proper, the man is entirely passive and the woman actively and vigorously sucks, licks and manually stimulates his penis; while in irrumation, the woman remains passive and the man forcibly thrusts his penis in and out of her mouth in the l.llanner of vaginal intercourse. We are on the way to building an encyclopedia when we start subdividing these into vertical fellatio, horizontal fellatio, sitting fellatio, etc.) Despite the deep-seated Christian aversion to orai sex (only relaxed a bit in recent decades), Kinsey found the practice widespread even during the sexual Dark Ages in which he '*'as writing. It is hard to see horv a mammal rvith the typical marnmalian breast-suckling experience could afterward be so conditioned that oral sex would be abolished, no matter how vehemently the clelgy might try.

Experts at this art have been known to defeat professional boxers; they can kick as high, and as fast, as anv Nijinsky, and quite a bit harder.) Today, of course, we are witnessing the amazing Linda Lovelace cult. Ms. Loveiace (see Figure 3), who starred in a porno flic called Deep Thronf, in which she portrayed a young lady whose clitoris was in her throat and who, thelefore, could only reach orgasm through vigorous fellatio, has become a sort of heroine or fantasy figure to large segments of the popula- tion. One chap even wrote a letter to the San Fra,ncisco Ball saying that he had seen Deeyt Throat 17 times and was hope- lessly in love with Linda. Esquire placed her smiling and winsome face on the cover of their June 1973 issue, but, typically, inside they joked nervously about the origin of her fame and couldn't bring themselves to sa1' bluntly that she had performed the most esthetically exquisite cocksucking ever shown in an American movie. There is even a group in California, called the Erisian Liberation Front (ELF), which is running Linda for president in 1976. Although they claim to be dead serious about this, their slogan sounds like a satirical comment on recent chief executives: \"Let's Have a Good- Looking Cocksucker in the White House!\" Ms. Lovelace has even written (with the aid of a writer named Douglas Warran) an autobiography called Inside Linda Louelctce, in which she gives detailed instructions on how to perform Deep Throaf fellatio (\"I call it cocksucking,\" she says with fetching frankness). The best posture for beginners, Linda avers, is with the head hanging over the side of the bed upside-down, giving the penis a straight line to the snug warmth of the inner throat. Yoga exercises (muscle-stretching and meditation), she adds, eventually give enough control and 27"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"\\ E- *'r.- fl 'l ',\"{,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Figure 3: Lind,a Louelace mnE not haue uon such fame for her throat had it not been for her breasts.

Among other benefits ascribed to yoga is Linda's claim that she can take a whole hutnctn .foot in her vagina; and an existing porno film short shov's her doing just this. (Mas- ters of Tantric yoga in India and Tibet are alleged to perform even more remarkable feats, including continuing coitus for seven hours at a stretch and sucking the semen back into the penis after ejaculation.) Whatever else this remarkable young woman has proven, her career at least demonstrates that there exists a certain force opposing the claims of the more rabid $'omen's libera- tionists with their papistlike proclamations that sex is always oppressive and degrading to women. Linda very clearly repre- sents the diametrically opposed viewpoint (occasionally enun- ciated by Ms. Virginia Johnson of Masters and Johnson) that a truly free woman can enjoy sex not only as much as a male but quite a bit more than a male. Perhaps she will become pres- ident after all. Of course, orality has an evolutionary background. Practi- cally all mammals practice some form of cunnilingus; that is, the male licks the female's genitalia to prepare her fol in- tercourse. It never seems to go further than that, however-at least no human scientist has reported seeing it go further. It appears that mammals are incapable of the leap of thought (or of energy) that allows that act to be contintted to orgasm and then be folLotaed by intercourse. And a female mammal fellat- ing a male mammal to orgasm is entirely unknown. This may actually require the evolution of a human-style brain and nervous system, and evolution may not yet be finished. There are already reports in medical literature about rare and lucky women who can achieve orgasm while onLy their breasts are being sucked, and there have even been cases of women who can achieve a climax while fellating their men. All this began with the development of erect posture, the transcending of the limited mating season, the use of the breasts for sexual signaling, and the foundation of the family. 30"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"It is hard to realize that in a sense the universe has only gradually been revealed to its inhabitants. There were long stretches of tin,e in which no being with eyes had appearecl, and yet everything alive was sensing and exploring its en- vironment to the limits of its abilities. The recent research of Backster and Vogel shows that plants and shrubs do much of their exploring by means which, in humans, are called ESP or telepathy. (Backster calls it primary perception.) These eye- less beings also sense their world through changes in light (which can be felt) and by gravitational sense and tempera- ture sense, among others. Out of this evolutionary background appeared eyes and the visual space created by those eyes. So marvelous was the new universe '*'hich the eyes beheld that we find it very difficult to think of the structure of realit-v without thinking of it as visual. From Maxwell and Einstein to the present, modern science has baffied ordinary minds-as well as those of some scientists-which cannot imagine or deal with a reality that is not visual. Yet, on a cosmic scale, there are likely to be countless races which perceive the realities described in Maxwell's or Einstein's equations and who would regard us as deluded primitives for thinking visual reality is the \"real\" r'ealit;'. Perhaps such cosllric minds have al- ready evolved here, sporadically ancl occasionally, and this is what the great mentaL mystics like Buddha are trying to tell us. Similarly, sex has obviously evolved flom the simple season- al program of the lower mammals to the year-round festivity that it is among humans. Among humans there are signs of slower and faster evolution also. (An old story tells of an Irishman who bedded with a young French girl in Paris. Asked how it was by another Irishman, he replied, \"Sure, back in County Westmeath sex is still in its infancy!\") Kinsey, in the 1940s, founcl that the average American male completed copu- lation in less than two minutes; sexual gourmets who prolong the act upward to an hour were astonished to read that. The women who achieve orgasm through breast manipulation or while fellating a man suggest powerfully that the evolution of sex, as part of the evolution of mind perception, is also continuing. So does the report of Baba Ram Dass (formerly Dr. Richard Alpert) that he has continued sexual activity for several hours while on LSD.

Desmond Morris tells of a woman who could reach orgasm by having her earlobes sucked. Hier- onymous Bosch in his paintings and Norman O. Brown in those remarkable books, Life Against Death and Loue's BodE, have suggested a possible evolution of sex out of the genitals into every part of the body, just as it has already evolved from being limited to one part of the year to permeating the entire year. This seems to be the direction of evolution; and Chris- tians of the year one million A.D.-if there are any-will find humanity much more \"fallen\" and \"sinful\" than at present. From a tiny rporadic acorn, sex seems to be a tree of life growing to till all space-time utterly. In this evolution, the breasts are already a first outpost of the sexual energy escaping from the genitalia. They not only lobes, behind the knee, etc.) The breasts represent the sexual- ization of a previously neutral area, and it is possible that they have been worshiped for this. And worshiped they have been, O my brothers. The caves of our ancestors are frequently found decorated with sketches very similar to Howard Hughes's skywriting advertisement for The Outlaw; it is now fashionable, among some romantic theorists, to suggest that these are flying saucers. An older and more plausible theory says they are breasts. The most famous of Stone Age artifacts, the Venus of Willendorf (see Figure 4), unambiguously protrays a woman with enormous mammaries. Similar big-breasted goddesses have been found in caves throughout Europe and the Near East. When history begins to emerge from the shadows, the earliest deities are mother goddesses, who may be considered as psychological extensions of the infant's memory of the breast: They are all-giving, all-nourishing and totally bereft of the stern an- tilife ethics of the later father gods. Many of these deities, like Diana of Ephesus mentioned earlier, were portrayed with multitudinous breasts-an iconographic revelation of their function."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"When the great patriarchal religions of gloom and damna- tion swept over the world, hell was invented to frighten the 'wits out of little children and sex became diabolical instead of divine. Men began to see the powers of nature not as gods and goddesses but as dernons, and to suspect their wonren of being witches; and the breast was put under seven and seventy curses and exorcisms. Nevertheless, it crept back into the design and architecture of the cathedrals-as every artist knows-and eventually a new mother goddess was created and allorved to enter the Christian pantheon as the \\rirgin Mary. It is important to lemember that biologicallv we have scarcely changed at all in the past geological epoch.

A female stood up to reach some- what higher on the tree for a special fruit. The male looked at her and possibilities occured to him. We haven't stopped thinking (about sex, and everything else) since then. Of course, many people resent all reference to our animal genealogy. They want to believe that all their ancestors were perfect ladies and gentlemen. It is disturbing to these folks to recall that in fact most of our ancestors didn't wear ties or corsets-or, worse yet, that the overwhelming majority of them weren't even mammals and looked like alligators or Gila monsters. Yet this is the record, and you can still see the frog in people when they swim a certain way or the lizard in them when they are lolling in the sun. There is also a notion afoot in certain quarters that we have, although harnessed to this slummy and unaristocratic back- ground, now evolved to the point where it is, or should be irrelevant to us. One might as well tell the robin that a person of his sartorial splendor should be above such grossness as eating worms for dinner. The robin, glorious as he is, is still a bird (and, if he has any sense, proud of it), and man, for all his gaudy and flashy brilliance, is still a mammal (and, if he has any sense, proud of it).

Would it be less disgraceful to have feathers like an angel (or a duck) than to have the characteristic fur of a mammal? Would it be m<_rr.e ethereal to synthesize energy directly from the sunlight, like a dandelion, than to gnaw on bones like our second cousins the dogs?

Then why, in heaven's name, feel uncomfortable when the same facts are mentioned about yourself? It sometimes seems that we haven't yet come to gr.ips with Freud, much less with Darwin. If somebody quotes Freud's opinion that the pyramids (which are religious temples as well as tombs) represent idealization or sublimation of the desire for the breast, somebody else will invariably snicker and remark that it just shows that the religious impulse is only a deflection of sexuality.

We can laugh at the many-breasted Diana of Ephesus as a crude conception of divinity, and yet perhaps the Romans weye more sophisticated than us, not less. Christian theolo- gians may proclaim from now till the last galoot's ashore that their paintings of divinity as an old man sitting on a cloud are not meant to be taken literally (was Diana taken literally by Ovid), but they continue to speak of \"He,\" thereby giving their god a biological gender and therefore (since we do not speak of plants or algae as he or she) a vertebrate natur.e. Can we imagine this gaseous vertebrate (Thomas Henrl' Huxley's phrase, and still an apt one) as truly nonhuman and nonmam- mal? Try it, and see if a rather fishy or reptilean image doesn't fill up the blank as you push mammalian images aside. \"God is a symbol of God,\" said the subtle, modern theologian Paul Tillich. It does seem that God the Father, like Diana the mother, is just an image of something else-something we cannot name but which we encounter in the family relation- ship and the sexual drive out of which that relationship grows. (All gods come in families, even the allegedly monotheistic Judeo-Christian God, Cabalistic Jews gave him a wife, Sheki- nah, and Christians, even more in keeping with Freud, gave him a virgin who is both his wife and his mother.) This something, this DNA spiral or governor or tao, made Sophia Loren out of ancestresses who a short time ago looked like the Venus of Willendorf and a while further back looked and walked much like Cheetah the Chimpanzee. What it can still make out of us staggered the imagination of Nietzsche and inspired Kubrick to produce 2001. Biology is much more mystical than theology, O my broth, ers: For, dig, out of the simple animal tit, scarcely more than a nipple, our friend the governor (or governess) sculpted these round, cup-shaped, gloriously esthetic human breasts, each consisting of 15 to 25 separate lobes which are almost whole biological systems in themselves. Each lobe contains clusters of lobules designed as intricately and functioning as smoothly as the best modern machinery, all protected and made de- lightfully soft to the touch by large amounts of insulation in"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the form of adipose (fatty) tissue. From each lobe there flows in a great network like some master biocomputer the lac- tiferous ducts, running to meet in the nipple; and without crowding or any traffic congestion, two more networks, of blood and lyrnph vessels, are also packed into these cups, providing nourishment and thermostatically regulating tem- perature. Best of all, the entire system has a neat feedback loop-\"the hot line,\" English biologist Alex Comfort nicely calls it-running down to the genitals. This hot line is activat- ed when a man sucks ol'caresses the breasts, creating sensa- tions in the clitoris which make life worth living to the lady in question and may even begin the process of vaginal lubrica- tion preparatory to intercourse. The same feedback loop, even more marvelously, goes into action when an infant nurses at the breast, and the pleasant vaginal sensations (which occasionally result in orgasm for sorre nul'sing mothers) also begin the process of healing the internal sex organs after the stretching and labor of child- birth. And all this operates on servomechanism principles, without the executive officer (ego) having to pay any attention at all. She can remain up on the bridge (i.e., in the frontal brain lobes) concentrating on other matters, at least until some of these processes become so pleasurable that she must turn cartwheels or bail out entirely, swimming in the ocean of bioenergetic bliss until the ship stops tossing about and she is able to resume command again. Most marvelous of all, as R. Buckminster Fuller points out in Nine Cltairts to the Moon,this servomechanism, and all the others in the female body and those in the male body too, and those in all our cousins throughout the mammal kingdom, and our second and third cousins in the fish and bird kingdoms, is not really a dead machine (as this terminology makes it seem) but a living presence, whom he dubs the \"Phantom Captain.\" This is not just an elaborate way of saying that living organisms are liuing organisms; it rather sharply reminds us that the execu- tive officer we usually recognize, the ego, scarcely deserves to take so much credit when things go right-or so much blame when things go wrong.

Before plunging into the heated and almost fetid hothouse of con- troversy surroullding Freud and his works, it is well to remind ourselves that whatever is true of modern infants was also true 20,000 or 50,000 or even 500,000 years ago. If modern infants have an \"oceanic experience\" of mystical oneness with the universe while at the breast-and many psychiatrists not dogmatically committed to Freudian theory continue to report clinical evidence that they do-then this was also true among our hairy ancestors crouching around campfir'es in the dawn of history. If we continue to seek this experience in adult life, then so did they. But this conclusion leads to results that few of us have ever thought about. According to David Cole Goldon's brilliant study of masturbation, SeI.f-Loue, the search for adult \"oceanic experiences\" includes such diverse behaviors as all forms of sex, gambling, u,atching football games, certain kinds of crinre, r'eligious rnysticism, mountain climbing and even sturl poker. In each of these, the person seeks to plunge into an ocean of sensation so intensely involving and pleasurable that the usual barriel between Self and World is forgotten or totally transcended. Obviously, many kinds of work-if self- chosen and deeply meaningful-also fall into the oceanic category (one thinks of scientific research, literature, art, music, etc.). So does every variety of play or game, and especially contests in u'hich fear is deliberately faced and transcended, such as auto racing or bullfighting. But once we have traced the oceanic experience this far', it is hard to see where we can draw the line at all, except at necessity itself- i.e., that which the universe forces us to do in order to survive. Everything else-everything that is part of the fabric of \"culture\" or human imagination rather than just given to us by nature-seems to have this elernent of seeking blissful transcendence.

First the Freudians found symbolism in dreams-and we'll buv that. A Iong tradition says these psychedelic night-visitors carry mes- sages. Then they found meaning in slips of the tongue, and everybody who remembers Richard Milhous Nixon saying \"This nation can't stand Pat\" knows that even the most artful dodger occasionally blurts out a home truth.

Encouraged, the analysts went on to find similar coded symbols in religion, rnythology, folklore, in science itself, in all the products of the human imagination. Eventually, Norman O. Brown was soberly writing that every sentence is a symboiic coitus, the subject being male, tl-re object fernale and the verb acting as penis. Somewhere along the line Freudian- ism had passed from science to theology and found itself the proud possessor of a system that explains everlrthing. A panchreston-an idea that expiains everything-is the logical equivalent of a panacea-a tnedicine that cures every- thing-or of the perpetual-motion machine in physics. Sr.rch ideals cannot possibly exist. We all know this intuitively, if we have any common sense at all, and Russell and Whitehead, with a strange passion for proving the obvious, have demon- strated it at length in their Principict ll[athematica. A human formula which explains all human formulas is technically in \"the class of all classes which include themselves\" and leads to iogical contradictions. It is therefore invalid in logic and mathematics. Good: We thus dispose of the more grandiose Freudians, and get rid of Thomas Aquinas, Marx, Ayn Rand and other absolutists for good measure. We are also free of that damned barber who shaves every man who doesn't shave himself, in the old riddle. (If he shaves himself, he violates the definition, but if he doesn't shave himself he also violates the definition. When we realize that he belongs to the logically invalid \"class of all classes that include themselves\" we are through with him forever.) So: However hard the Freudians drive us, there is one sanctuary to which we can flee. They literally cannot explain everything. Somewhere there is a door they cannot force, a temple they cannot enter', a iogically necessaly refuge which their panchreston cannot incorporate, and there we can still maintain our mysterious and dreadful freedom. It has to be admitted though, that outside the last bastion Freud and his satraps have explained a great deal-in fact, more than most people cared to have had explained. A man /1t"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"who is fastidiously neat, careful about balancing his budget, eager to take an authoritarian role and give orders to others -an ideal executive type in short-is probably an anal per- sonality. His whole psychic economy is involved with symbolic substitutes for the struggles of will that went on in infancy during toilet training. Bankers, accountants and mathe- maticians, as well as businessmen, are often of this type. An uncomfortable thought? Then there's the compulsively chroni- cally, monotonously promiscuous fellow-guess what? He's probably a repressed homosexual. Each woman drives him away quickly by her femininity; each new woman is grabbed just as rapidly to stave off his unconscious desire for another man. Does the shoe pinch yet? Then there's the gentle soul, the liberal, the bleeding heart who cares for all people and suffers every pain in the universe as if it were his own. He's an oral personality, still symbolically nursing at the breast. (Of course, nothing is quite as simple as these labels usould lead one to belieue. Few of us are nothing more than one of these Freudian categories, except in the literary or dramatic arts where writers can simplify for dramatic effect. Purely oral types-Chekhov's lJncle Vanya, Joyce's Leopold Bloom, the timid little guys played by Danny Kaye, Harold Lloyd, Wally Cox or Dennis Hopper-would probably not survive to adulthood in the real world.) Nevertheless, there are statistical clusters that remain fairly consistent in psychological testing, and have repeatedly been confirmed during several decades of such probing. Given 300 verbal statements to mark \"I agree\" or \"l disagree,\" certain men will agree with most of the statements consistent with an oral personality-that is, a personality largely deter- mined by conditioning and imprinting received during the nursing stage and therefore oriented chiefly toward a mother archetype. Other men will agree with most of the statements consistent with an anal personality-a personality largely determined by conditioning and imprinting received during toilet training or other early conflicts with social rules of ttmoralitytt or ttdecorum.t' For instance, the statement \"I hate to see some smart lawyer bedazzle a jury and get some no-good criminal off scot-free\"-which you must have seen on one of these per- sonality quizzes at some time in your college or business career-is always rejected by a purely oral type, who will 4.)"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"check \"I disagree,\" and accepted by a purely anal type, who rvill check \"I agree.\" This is because the oral type identifies with the underclog in every situation and assumes that the defendant is accused wrongly or got into trouble through no fault of his own. Anal types, on the other hand, have \"in- trojected\" the father archetype or authority principle, and are always looking for sornebody to punish.:l Interestingly enough, if you take the same group and give them a nonverbal test such as the TAT (Thematic Appercep- tion Test), in which they look at pictures and n:rake up stories about them, the oral types will devise oral stories, the anal types rn,ill project anal stories, introverts and extraverts will see characteristically introverted or extraverted situations, etc., thereby illustrating the dictum of the first great psycholo- gist, Buddha-that the u'orld we see is our orvn fantasy' For instance, one statrdard picture shorvs a young man facing an old lady who has a sad expression. To the oral type, they are mother and son, he has done wrong, but she is about to forgive him. To ar-r anal type, however, he. is more likely to be a bill collector', she is trying to con him by crying, but he'll get the moneyanyhow.... Before following these Freudian concepts any further, let us stop to look at tr historical incident which seerns apropos. Freckle-facecl Phryne, the most famous of the courtesans of Athens in the 4th CenturY 8.c., was approximately contempo- rary with Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades, Aristophanes and Plato-a lively group of conversationalists, to say the Ieast of them. They had other colorful traits, too: Alcibiades, one of the best generals of his time, was probably the homosexual lover of Socrates (who had a wife and a mistress on the side), and was once disgraced and sent into exile for a drunken prank in which he cut the penises off the statues of various gods in the city. Phryne herself was not only lovely (they say she posed for some of Praxiteles's voluptuous goddesses) but something of an inclependent thinker herself , like rrrost of the rvell-educated and artistically talented courtesan class. (Athenian wives, on the other hand, were encouraged to remain both stupid and submissive. Among its other glories and abominations, Athens rlsee my notes on our. anal cuss-words ass, ass-hole,.s/iit and pig in Robert Anton Wilson, Playboy's Bttok of Forbidden Wbrds (Nerv York: Playboy Press, 19?2)' 41"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"evidently pioneered what Women's Lib now calls male chau- vinism.) Phryne eventually got into serious trouble for her ideas and was accused of impiety and disrespect for the gods. This was a capital offense and Socrates later died for it. In Phryne's case the court also seemed inclined to take a harsh view-just a while before, they had sent Anaxagoras into exile for saying that the way he figured it, the sun probably wasn't a god at all but just a big hunk of burning rock. Seeing that things were going against her, Phryne (or her lawyer; accounts differ) pulled down her robe, exposed her fair bosom to the judges and said this was her testimony. She was acquitted. Cynics will say that the judges were horny old men. Esthetes generally interpret the story as a noble illustration of the religious awe that the Athenians had for beauty. Phryne had said, in effect, does this vision not prove the gods are pleased with me? Since the act of baring the breast was a traditional sign of worship among the female devotees of the great mother goddess, it is possible that Phryne was, indeed, testify- ing to her piety; see our discussions later of the breast repressed and unrepressed. A very ingenious Freudian, how- ever, might offer a more psychological interpretation. Judges, according to Freudian theory, tend to be very anal individuals, but being human they must have some oral com- ponent and a trace of tenderness and forgiveness. Phryne's dramatic gesture, whether or not it reminded them of the rites of the great goddess (at that point in decline, being replaced by those of the father god, Zeus, but still practiced at least yearly at the Eleusinian Mysteries), almost certainly startled them into oral memories and associations. . . . It might almost be considered an early example of Action or Gestalt therapy. Similar partial or total nudity is used by the more radical Encounter therapists to jar people back into awareness of primordial realities underlying our cruel and complicated social games of reward and punishment. (See Dickens's astonishing use of the nude female breast as a reminder of all we have lost in this cruel civilizalion, in the passage from Dauid Copperfield to be quoted later. I also recall Josef von Sternberg's Marked Woman, which has the most painful climax in cinema history: Marlene Dietrich, about to be shot by a firing squad, asks for a mirror and comb in order to fix her hair before dying. These are provided, and she holds"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"the mirror to her face and raises the comb to her hair; the gesture is so beautifully and delicately feminine that one soldier bursts into tears, throws down his rifle and refuses to shoot. He is led off in disgrace and a man better adjusted to our civilization takes his place. She is shot-and the audience comes out with the most ghastly silence you have ever heard in a movie theater. Nobody looks at anybody else in the lobby.) Returning to our oral and anal types: After we have identi- fied them through the verbal tests and that TAT, some inter- esting things happen if we put them in a group therapy session. The anal types will immediately try to dominate the therapist, or, failing that, they will try to compete with him for authority over the rest of the group. The oral types, on the other hand, will quickly broadcast how helpless they are and how much care they need. This is so commonplace that the therapist, without seeing the previous test results at all and without time for a real \"depth analysis,\" will still classify them into these groups, precisely as the man marking the tests has classified them. (This experiment has been tried repeated- ly, with the results as predicted by Freudian theory. Timothy Leary, Ph.D., of LSD fame, was one of the first to set up a large-scale experiment of this sort. Curiously, his own testing procedures were used on him a decade later when he entered prison.) But if this much of Freudian theory is true-if most people will show the same tendencies in their verbal responses, their visual imagination and their actual behavior in groups-we had better look a bit more closely at the good doctor Freud's ideas about breasts and oralism. At least, that might tell us why this book turns us on (and why many of us feel secretly guilty about being turned on by it). The pleasure of the child at the breast, says Freud, is sexual pleasure. The love of the child for its mother is sexual love. This does not mean that the little boy wants to possess his mother in the manner of adult sexuality or that the little girl is necessarily a little lesbian. It means that the basic physical and psychological bliss is, on an energetic and biological level, the same that we later experience in adult sexuality. Two Freudian revisionists, Wilhelm Reich, M.D., and Frederick Perls, M.D., Ph.D., have clarified this somewhat by pointing out that anriety is also the same energy running in the opposite direction. Let us call it excitement, to be simple. When .16"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"excitenrent is tu'oused, when ener.g)' seeks an outlet in actioD, one either goes forward to the goal (energy discharge) or one blocks and ]resitates.

If there is a block, the sal-ne energy' annoyingly remains \"on tap\" :rs it were' and this senszrtion is called anxiety. On the verbal level, this state is explessecl b-v such phrases as \"Oh, I don't know rvhat to rlo-I'i.n afraitl-Eithet' choice seems equalil\" bztci'\" Freud call- ecl tl-ris BesetztQig. rvhich in German has the hotrtelv I'treaning of sitting clown.

Reich cirlled it \"emotional anchoring,\" lvhich is mole poetic and sttggests a ship being held back by a heavy weight while Perls, I'i'ith typical earthi- ness, just calls it beittg stuck. Thus, there is nothing wrong with the infant's bliss at the breast; it is entirely appropriate for that age. There is nothing wl'ong with the pelsonality and behaviors he develops to enjoy that stage to its r-tttlost. Burrittg entcttional sliocA's ot' othet' enuironntetttuL o,ttcrtks ttrt hittt, he will grorv ezrsily and nat- urally into other stages, lieeping just as llluch of this love-sex experience as c.ontinues to be useful and appropriate.

Tl\"ris <ilzrl eletuent has tnanv delightful arttl beneficent func- tions ir-r latei'lifc. It makes us love $'omen's bl'easts, kissthem' cuddle them, suck them, play with them.

(Hence, prudes and women's Iibei'ationists will never get rid of such \"pol'nogt'aphic\" or' \"chauvinistic\" alt until they first {ind some wa}'to get rid of the neoteny-the prolortgetl infancy-of the httrlrttn species. Even bottle-fetl infants actluire olalistl, sir-rce the bottle I'e- nrains stubbolnly a dead bt'east substitute but still a brcust sultstitute.) The olal eielxent also makes it ltossible, if we are lucky, to expelience the \"oceanic consciousness\" of the mvs- tics, for', if Fi'eud is right, this is a development of the union-rvith-mother that the nursing child feels. It also gives us what share we hal'e in warmth, kindness, generosity and that verv oral virtue, fotgiveness. In short, if we have any tender- 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"ness at all, we haven't fully repressed our oral element. It should be obvious at this point that the historical Yeshua of Nazareth (the Jesus Christ of Christian mythology) was a man with a considerable oral element. He had a high degree of mystic oneness with the universe. He loved little children and compared them to the kingdom of heaven. He sympathized with publicans and sinners. He even forgave those who crucified him. It is not surprising that so many artists have intuitively portrayed him as a small infant nursing at the breast of Mary. His is a totally oral religion. Part of the confusing and schizo- phrenic quality of American life is the result of an official allegiance to this religion combined with an economic system of cutthroat capitalism, which is based on a totally anal rejection of all these tender oral values. Only the admixture of anality in Christianity itself, deposited by the legalistic woman-hater St. Paul, allows the incompatible mixture to come off at all. Orality becomes sick and sinister rl'hen the person is cath- ected or stuck at that psychological stage and cannot or will not develop the personality traits of later childhood and maturity. The cathected oral personality carries forgiveness much further than Jesus himself-who, after all, was capable of shouting angry denunciations at the \"generation of vipers\" around him, condemning lawyers as \"hypocrites\" and even taking a whip to the usurious money changers in the temple. In Dr. Perls's striking terminology, the mature person makes demands on others and on the world, but the oral personality only harbors resentrnents. Look hard and unflinchingly at something or somebody you resent, and there you will find a trace of pathological oralism in you. The healthy process, confronted by frustration, is to tell the frustrator to get the hell out of your way. The oral process is to submit, forgive the frustrator for his primitive and insensitive nature (so much less \"spiritual\" than the oralist himself) and then to harbor an unspoken resentment. As Dr. Perls has written: If you have any difficulties in communication with anyone, look for your resentments. Resentments are among the worst possible unfinished situations-unfinished gestalts. If you re- sent, you can neither let go nor have it out. Resentment rs an emotion of centrai importance. The resentment is the most important expression of an impasse-of being stuck. If you feel resentment, be able to express your resentment. A resentment 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"unexpressed often is experienced as, or changes into, feelings of guilt. Whenever you feel guilty, find out what you are resenting and express it and nrake your demands explicit. This alone will help a lot.a The dependent and resentful oral personality programs his life around a technique which actor-directol Mike Nichols once called \"winning by losing.\" In'any conflict, we can either win boldly and frankly by u'inning-or we can win symbolically by losing. That is, if we have the classic oral rationalizations, we can convince ourselves that our loss was a spiritual or moral victory. It showed our superiority to the crude and bullying rascal lvhom rve graciously refused to fight directly. If you watch people who are especially good at this technique, you will see that thev always convey the resentment-filled rnes- sage that they zrre the real r.vinners, eithel by tone of voice or' by posture and \"body language\" or through some other subtle form of nonverbal communication. An old cartoon shows a top sergeant shouting at a recruit: \"And wipe that opinion off your face!\" The rookie, unable to win against the army system in any ordinary way, was evi- dently regressing to his oral component and trying to signal that he was still winning-by losing. The cathected oral personality attempts to turn all human relations into a series of encounters with an enormous, rounded, firmly nippled, all-providing pair of breasts. If you can't orl,von't play that role, he then turns you into an avatar of the \"denying mother\" or \"bad mother\" (Freud's terms), who selfishly and malignantly withholds the treasured nipples. Of course, if you like being a pair of nipples, there is a fortune to be made-just acquire a psychiatrist's license and go into business. These types rvill be glad to pay your fees, whatever they are, not only for years, but even for decades. There is only one rule: Never try to be a true psychiatrist-never try to cure thenr-or they will become disillusioned and seek another therapist, another symbolic u'et nurse. \"I can't bear listening to all this misery day after day,\" one psychiatrist complains to another, in an old joke. \"So, who listens?\" says the second. The fact is that the majority of people in psychotherapy at a aFlederick f'ells, Geslall Therapll \\'arbatint (Nerv York: Bantatrr IJooks, 1971). ,19"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"given moment are likely to be pure oral types or to have a large oral element mixed with othei' traits. This is because the oralist enters every situation seeking help from somebody else, and the psychiatrist seems to offer the kind of help that is most needed-mothering. On the othel hand, the opposite extreme, the totally anal personality, is hardly ever found in psychotherapy. This is because he is seldottt rniserable himselJ; he just makes everybody around him miserable. For no txatter how you try to relate to an anal type-no matter how carefully you study his power game and tly to predict his rules-it al.,vays turns out that -vou are at least slightly wrong and need some measure of correction from his inexhaustible fount of moral superiority. (The superficially \"rational\" and lvell-adjusted anal types become business executives or judges, as we have said. They also infest mathematics, banking, accounting, professorships in the \"hard\" or' \"exact\" sciences, atomic research and the militaly. The often-repeated Freudian comment that ours is an anal culture merely rreans that it has many power and prestige positions which are attractive to anal types, who thereupon muscle into those positions and then have the socially defined authority to inflict their own anal values on evervbody else. These characteristic anal values-as contrast- ed to the childish dependency, emotional rvarmth, kindness, generosity, f orgiveness, buried resentn.rent and pervasive \"Uncle Tom\" masochism or \"Goocl Soldier Schweik\" incom- petence of the olal type-are eliciency, precision, hatred of the body and of all mess or dirt, fear of emotional contact, steln realism and n-roralistic desire to meddle in evelybody else's life. The rnore hysterical and less rational anal types tend to become policemen or collectors of bad debts for cledit corporations.) The shock and dismay of the infant when the harshness of traditional toilet training introduces the anal-rational-molal values into the previously cozy oral-oceanic state is conveyed with remarkable ovelt symbolism in Char'les Dlckens's Dru;id CopperJieLd. So Freudian is this sequence, indeed, that it is hard to believe that it was actually written half a century before Freud defined the oral and anal stages in his Three Contributions to the Theory o.l'Ser. Dickens describes an idyllic childhood in rvhich David lives with a widowed mother who can safelv be categorized as a 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"secular version of the bonadea (good goddess). Onto this happy scene intludes the horrible Mi'. Murdstone, whose \"Jehovah complex\" (as any modern psychiatrist would call it) makes him ern avatar of the archetypal punishing father god. There is no rvay of obe-ving all of Muldstone's mles; thele are too lnany of them ancl most of them are unstated and irnplicit anyway. David undergoes sonle monumental lashings on the buttocks (for his own good, of course, although Dickens emphasizes in a quite Freudian way the obvious enjoyment Mr. Muldstone obtains from these sessions). Quite natr\"rrally, Davicl begins to internalize this anal system of values (especially after Murd- stone becomes his stepfather) and imagines that he is quite a guilty little wretch ancl richly derserves this torture. Then-in a quite eerie echo of Phlyne or of Eleanor of Aquitaine baring her breasts in Jerusalem at the height of the medieval pa- triarchal i,rge-Dickens has the following scene, when David returns from a year at school: I rvent in rvith quiet, timid step.

It is normal at present to squirm rvith elnbarrassment at Dickens's sentimentality, just as it was normal to squirm with embarrassment (or prurience) at what was an equally elo- quent sex scene back in the days when hr, was writing. And -vet-if one can put aside one's resentment at the very obvious ways he is playing on the leader''s heartstrings-the only 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"intelligent response to this is frank admiration for the man's insight.

Uuless lve understand th:rt pzrrt of us is still seeking this whenever we caress a woman's so-called secondar\"v sex zones in the breasts, we will be making love in a psychological darkness as neurotic as the physical dat'kness rvhich our grandparents imposed on their bedrooms. Of course, Murdstone is soon back on the scene again and David undergoes fnrther tniseries. A Catholic bishop once complained that Jzrue Russell's breasts l-rung \"like a storm cloud\" ovel' every scene in Tht' Outluto,' David's urother''s breasts hang like the sun itself ovei'the growing darkness of the Murdstone rvorld until David finallv fr\"ees himself from it by becoming Cheu'les Dickens and der.rouncing the cruelty, hypocrisy and scarcely sublintated sadisn that made up the Victorian theory of child-rearing. It is amusing to note (although this could hardly be con- scious on Dickens's part), that the last svllable of Mr. Murd- stone's name suggests the hard, rocky ir.npression that anal types usually convey, whiie the fir'st syllable is suggestive of the French nterde, excrement. Dickens's ability to communicate movingly how insanely cruel Murdstone's child-rearing methods seem to the child himself eventually resulted in widespread repugnance for them. The same result, however, is still achieved by more subtle psychological conditioning in all but the most \"ptogres- sive\" families; David Copperfield's storlr-' is still moving be- cause we have all passed through sometl-ring like it.

The-v are carrying their orality resentfully, spitefully and neuroti- cally, not integrating it into an adult realism, but using it to stave off maturity. This is the stubborn qr-rality of the neurotic rvlrich Freud called Besetzung or Catlir'.r'i.s. But, of course, all olal traits in adulthood are not necessarily neurotic.

Orality also adds a great deal to sex.

Just as an old college song reduces all the problems of ontology to Zenlike empiricisli-t- We're here because lve're heLe, because'uve're here, because u'e'le here . -it is equally true, almost always, to say that We're scared because lve're scared, because r've're scared. because we'te scared . Fortunately, the fears that infest below-the-belt orality have not seliousl.v infected the breast quest itself. I did i'ead once, hou'ever, in some Dear Crabbv-or Ann Launders-type column, about a \\\\'oman who lvas afraid of allou'ing her husband too much gratilication of that sort for feal it might give her breast cancer. In such a case, one hardly needs Freud to see that the ostensible \"reason\" for the fear was created after the fear itself. The really significant form of repression of orality in our culture is the phobia against breast-feeding infants, which began in the 1920s, peaked in the 1950s and has been declining (very slowly) ever since. But this subject, which may relate to the paranoid trend of our society generally, will be treated in the chapter \"The Breast Repressed.\" Freudianism itself reached son,e kind of climax ol peak during those same years with the remarkable career of Edr-r,und Bergler, M.D. Dr. Bergler became convincecl that not some but all human neuroses were caused by desire for the breast-but in a very peculial sense. The oneness of the infant at the nipple, he said, was literall;q believed by the o4"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"infant, and the fundamental trauma of life was the shocked discovery that this wonderful object belonged to somebody else-to mother. Worse yet, she could withhold it on occasion. From this, Dr. Bergler claimed, there came a desire for revenge which was the secret core of every subsequent action. This, of course, is no odder sounding than most Freudian theories, but Dr. Bergler rvas just beginning. His theories became increasingly imaginative and all-inclusive. In Motrc'y and the Unconscio'us, he proved that every patient who ever had trouble meeting his high fees was actually withholding the money to punish him for being right. In Fctshiort. cntd th,e (Jtt.cortscious, he proved-and this has ahvays been tny favor- ite-that women's clothes are all hideously ugly because they are designed by homosexuals seeking revenge against their mothers for withholding the breast and are accepted by women because they, poor dears, are all masochists secretly devoted to punishing themselves. In lr{eurotic Counter.feit Sex, he proved that everything Kinsey found statistically normal is actually neurotic and that only the \"missionary position\" (as the Hawaiians call man-on-top coitus) is normal. In Writers and the (Jnconsciotts, he proved that everybody who has ever written a book was a repressed homosexual, chewing and sucking on words as \"regular\" homosexuals chew and suck on penises, as substitutes for the denied breast. In between these remarkable tomes, he wrote endless articles proving that all clitics of his theories-who by then were legion in psycho- analytical and psychiatric circles-were neurotic. He eventu- ally became the favorite hate-object of the Gay Liberation Front and it is as such that he is remembered, which is really a pity because sone of his notions rvere probably at least partialiy true. Finally, Ira Wallach, in a book that appeared to be satire, HopaLong Freu.cL Ricles Again, suggested that just as evef-v woman wishes to have a penis (according to the master'), every man wishes to have a pair of breasts. Was this really parody? Carl Jung, the most prestigious of F reud's rivals, argues soberly that each sex unconsciously wishes to become more like the other and that this desire finds increasing expression with age-as proofs of which he offered the mustaches on old women and the pendulous breasts on old men. Again, are we sure he is completely wrong? The universal human experience of prolonged infancy has conditioned and imprinted us in so OD"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"many ways that any speculation about the breast is, at very least, a fantasy that has occurred to more than one mind in history and is thus part of our human heritage. There is, for instance, the puzzling phenomenon of oral sadism. On a simple reading of Freud's original theories, this should not exist at all, since only the calamities of toilet training produce the reactive sadism of the anal types. (Petard, the old word for bomb, comes from the same root as fart, and the military mentality can be defined as the search for a satisfactorily orgasrnic superexplosion which leaves everybody dead, like the epic farts in certain jokes.) According to Freud, who may be a bit imaginative here, oral sadism, on the other hand, derives flom the inf ant's cannibalistic f antasies while at the breast. (We adults still say, \"I could eat I'ou all up\" when transported by erotic bliss.) This theme is characteristic of the werewolf and vampire legends which have been around at least since the New Stone Age and received a new currency when Hollywood discovered their commercial appeal in the 1930s. One could hazard a guess that there is not a child in America-or in any country where Hollywood films circu- late-who is not familiar with the whole grisly lore of how a man bitten by the werewolf becomes a werewolf, how these creatures are seized at the full moon (sign of the mother goddess) with the lust for human flesh, and how that other jolly fellow, the vampire, rises from the grave to suck blood from the living. Ernest Jones wrote the first psychoanalytic study of this legendry back in 1910, even before Hollywood discovered it, and pointed out the ambivalence and strange sympathy these monsters evoke-a compassionate identifica- tion rationalized by the thought, \"They can't help what they've become,\" a notion seldom rememberdd about our human enemies in wartime (or any other time for that matter). The fact is that we not only identify masochistically with their victims but also identify sadistically with the monsters them- selves-which can be seen very clearly in young children. These oral monsters represent impulses which, in any oral sex act, are close to the surface but carefully repressed either because of taboo or loving empathy with the other party. Thus, we only s{Ly \"I could eat you all up\" but content ourselves with licking, kissing and gentle nibbling. Gershon Legman suggests that male contempt for a lady who is overly enthusiastic about 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"fellatio-\"She's i'ust a cocksucker\" a fellow will say, although having enjoyed her company for precisely that reason- derives from more than the antisexual or antihedonistic bias of Christian culture. Legman thinks there is an unconscious fear that this impulse can go too far and becotne real oral sadism. Similarly, many women seem to indulge male orality largely out of a sense that the man needs to think he's a great and skillful lover-perhaps they could enjoy it more if not bothered by unacknowledged fears that he might go off his head and actually start chewing and ripping. Oral sex notori- ously gets better as the partners live together longer and learn to trust each other more totally. In this connection, an anecdote in Legman's The Rut.ionaLe of the Dirty Joke is apropos. One embittered woman, who had probably known too many male chauvinists in her life, devel- oped a singularly oral-sadistic revenge. She would lure mar- ried men to her apartment, fellate them while they were still dressed, then spit the semen onto their trousers and say, \"Explain that to your wife, you son of a bitch!\" One gen- tleman, a professor, hearing of this, allowed himself to be led into her trap. When she rvas finished with her performztnce, he calmly arose, removed his trousers, took another pair from his briefcase, put them on, tipped lTis hat and left. It is anal squeamishness about orality, of course, which has made \"sucks\" into a very, very dirty word, immortalized in the common graffiti informing the world that \"Tom sucks\" or' \"Suzie sucks\" or \"Policemen suck\" and so forth. In the 1960s, this became politicized, and graffiti saying \"Johnson sucks\" appeared wherever radicals congregated. Norman Mailer even tells of seeing \"Pentagon sucks\" written on the wall of the Pentagon itself during the huge antilr.'ar clemonstration there in 1967, and he comments that even if soldiers usually dislike pacifists, the lower ranks woulcl enjoy that particular expres- sion of pacifist sentiment. The elaboration, \"The army is like a joint?-the more you suck, the higher you get,\" now appears in latrines everyrvhere.

(His is rather an icy \"intellectual\" anger and the kind of revenge Poe describedin The Cask o.f'Am'ontil- lado.) Most of all, he rejects the homeostatic functions of the body's servomechanism system (Fuller's \"Phantom Captain\")' especially excretion itself, then urination, masturbation, the visible symptoms of pregnancy and, of course, lactation. Anal types are notorious for their food phobias and can't stand milk, tapioca pudding, creamed vegetables or anything else that reminds them of their own oral stage in infancy. The strength of the anal component in our culture, indeed, is demonstrated by the continuing efforts to roll back the ad- vance of sexual frankness in the last decade. Long after it had been made abundantly obvious that the sight of a few nipples would tzot result in the Decline and Fall of the American Empire, the attempt to restore the censorship of the past still finds its powerful allies. In January 1973, the local bluenoses scored a small victory in one of our most wide-open cities, San Francisco. The proprietor of a topless bal rvho had set up a billboard showing his star attraction revealing her lovely mammaries in all their naked glory was ordered to restore her to a more modest look. He did so, amusingly enough, by plastering a large white strip saying CENSORED across her nipples. It sometimes appears that Darwin's discoveries are as little understood as Einstein's. The phrase \"natural selection,\" for example, specifically included se^iucLl selection, but most people still do not comprehend that this means that humanity is largely its own creation. The male human, for instance, has the largest penis in the primate family; his muscular cousin, the gorilla is, by comparison, conspicuously less virile in this respect, contrary to popular lore associated with the fantasy- image of the lady carried off by one of these apes. (Average length, flaccid, for the human ntale, is around 3.7 inches; for the gorilla, two inches. The other primates are closer to the gorilla.)

Most of what rve consider our mental activity consists of sub-articulate, half-conscions semantic refl exes-reactions to key words as the situation invokes these words in our minds.

A rnetaphol is the implicit identification of two different factors.

Judeo-Christian theology has consistently spoken and written of sex in metaphorical terms as a species of dirtiness. The identification of sexuality and dirtiness has been \"built into\" the psychoiogical and neurological reactiotrs of countless mil- iions of people subliminally-without their being completely aware of the \"poetic\" or pre-logical nature of the identification. When Romantic poets associate sexuality with budding flo'\"v- ers, growing grass, sprouting shrubs, and so on, they are creat- ing an identi.fication that points to'\"vard the opposite kind of reaction.

These are palts of them- selves that they have given away to society in return for social acceptability. The surrender can be astonishingly total: Roman wor- shipers of Attis literally gave up their genitals by castrating themselves (there was a similar sect of Christians in Russia at one time).

In short, clothing is a product of our ability to think sEmbolically. Other animals evidently can think only about what is right here, right now; but we can think about things that aren't here anymore or may be here in the future or may never be here. From this ability to abstract we produce our most glorious thoughts and our most frightful insanities. Whether clothing ranks as a glory or an insanity, of course, depends on your viewpoint; but wearing it is not something we would do if,like the dogs and apes and trees and fish, we only registered what is right here, right nous. It was the egregious Carlyie who first pointed out that clothing is almost entirely psychological in its functions. Writ- ing of our primitive ancestor, the primordial hunter, Carlyle noted that \"warmth he found in the toils of the chase;or amid dried leaves, in his hollow tree, in his bark shed, or natural grotto; but for decoration he must have clothes. The first spiritual want of a barbarous man is decoration. .\" And of a barbarous woman. Indeed, the kind of attention that women traditionally pay to other women's clothes is related to everything except their alleged use in protecting the body from bad weather. \"Do you think my pearl necklace is too long?\" a lady of lusty reputation once asked Madame de Pompadour. \"Not at a11,\" was the soft reply, \"it is merely attempting to get back to its source.\" Zsa-Zsa Gabor could not have improved on that, except by adding a \"Dahhhhling.\" A maiden of the Upper Congo, where body paint, tattoo and scar patterns are used in precisely the same way, and for the same purpose, as the clothing of our own women, might seem well dressed when, actually, she is nude. The function is not to conceal or downgrade sexuality but to emphasize it in a new way. Lawrence Langner argues quite convincingly in his droll essay The Importunce of Wearing CLothes that clothing is the chief cause of the year-round sexiness of human beings as compared to the only seasonal lasciviousness of other animals. It is quite true that nobody is as sexually stimulated in a nudist colony as he expects to be before he has tried a visit. Of course, part of the sexually arousing effect of clothes resides in (a) the gradual revelation of nudity as they are slowly removed-the basis of that very interesting art form, 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"the striptease; and (b) fantasies about removing them, as typified by men \"undressing women with their eyes\" on the street.

Women's liberation will never cure this male reflex unless the organization gets a law passed to castrate male infants shortly after birth. The nude breasts of the Polynesians (see Figures 7 and 8) offended the missionaries, who forced the ladies to cover up with the well-known muu-muu or Mother Hubbard.

Clothes covering bodies which once went naked have contributed to the natives' moral de- cadence by stimulating a nasty curiosity which never before existed.\" Charlie Chaplin made the same point with wonderful wit in an early short in which he is a house painter and comes upon a nude female statue in a room where he is painting. Charlie blushes, looks away, and then fetches a lamp shade which he places over the statue to cover the territory from breasts to thighs. He then returns to his painting-for a few minutes, after which he creeps back and peeks under the shade lasciviously. That may be the whole psychology of clothing in a nutshell. The same striptease or peakaboo effect underlies fashion, which keeps men interested from decade to decade by strategi- cally changing which portion of the female anatomy will be revealed and which concealed. In a typical bit of 1920s cheese- cake (see Figure 9) the withering away and down-playing of the breast is accompanied by a full display of legs, quite typical of the flat-chested and short-skirted decade. Similarly, when long skirts began to conceal legs in the late 1940s and early 1950s, designs were cut to emphasize buttocks-which also received great attention in the early pinups of rlaYnov and its imitators. It is a general rule of female fashion: When something is being hidden, something else is being displayed. Thus, French women of the Napoleonic era (see Figure 10) quite boldly exposed their breasts in very low-cut gowns, but 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"'{ t *'r \\{':s i :*e i* FS. *, *- b'.* .. k* Yui \"*.o*' . -,.i';rli;*', !. :*: .':S..s"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"From Bali (Figure 7) to Tahiti, where Gauguin painted (Fi,gure 8), women left their breasts un- couered,, much to tlte consterna- tion of Western missionaries.

The striptease of fashion seems eternal: Whatever is lost one decade returns the next, and whatever is gained is again lost. It is worth pointing out that one item of clothing serves in itself to refute entirely all ideas that covering the body really attempts to achieve modesty. I refer, of course, to the brassiere -which has very little to do with making the breasts less conspicuous and everything to do with making, them nxore conspicuous. The brassiere, in fact, has been designed and redesigned so often that it will do virtually anything, depend- ing on the demands of the fashion of the moment. One bra will enlarge small breasts, another will conceal the size of large breasts; one will pull the breasts upward, another will flatten them downward; there is even an inflatable brassiere. Law- rence Langner's book on clothing quotes a joke about a bra manufacturer who produced three models: \"The Great Dictator\" (to suppress the masses), \"The Salvation Army\" (for 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"uplift), and \"The Yellow Press\" (to make mountains out of molehills). In all of this, vanity, not modesty, is the true motive. The new braless look, identified with women's liberation although it actually preceded the political movement by a few years in left-hippie circles, has to be understood as part of a context which includes such trends as: the no-makeup look, the choice of cheap and \"lower-class\" clothing (for both male and female), the resorting to yoga and chiropractics in place of traditional allopathic medicine, the choice of hitchhiking as the preferred mode of travel, and possibly even the choice of marijuana instead of alcohol as social drug. In all this, the determining factor seems to be a desire to auoid spending moneA unnecessariLy; that is, to resist a system which seems devoted chiefly to what the young call \"ripping off\" the public. This is revolution in the anarchist form of direct action, as contrasted with the political action urged by liberals and Marxists. It allows young people to quit jobs they dislike, to travel extensively, to live on Welfare part-time, to grab onto the freedom which the older generation has mostly lost, just by accepting a certain amount of voluntary poverty as the price of that freedom. The slogan, \"Don't own anything you can't pack in a knapsack and carry on your back\" is part of the same mystique, which is quite sane actually, if one's motive in life is to enjoy oneself. It only seems insane if one believes, like the older generation, that the purpose of life is to impress the neighbors. (We will say more about this new mentality, which Charles Reich has called \"Consciousness III,\" later on. There are ample reasons to consider it just another passing fad. There are also reasons to think it might be more than that and might represent an irreversible change.) The flat-breasted look of the 1920s is especially interesting since it paradoxically coincided with a great deal of liberalism and general loosening of previous \"Victorian\" prudery. Soci- ologists emphasize the unisex or proto-women's-lib aspect of what happened: Women were granted the vote in 1920 and surrended the typical female breast-line a few years later; both were parts of a movement toward elimination of sexual discriminations. But why then did feminism collapse so thoroughly as the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s came and went-and why did it revive with such embittered and hysterical rhetoric in the late 1960s? For that matter, why did the flat breast 171"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Figure 77: In the 1930s, moaie godd,ess Carole Lombard, showed, the continuation of the flat- chested, look, but with compen- satory attention to the legs. coincide with the decline of breast-feeding for infants (a trauma which has left visible scars on the infants of that decade, who are now rather paranoid middle-aged people quite hostile to all forms of life everywhere on the planet, including Blacks, Orientals, animals, Europeans, insects, fish and-most notable of all-their own childrenX And why was the same decade the age of official repression of the most oral of all drug habits, alcohol, together with a total nationwide rebellion against the law never again equaled until the pot revolution of the 1960s? The psychodynamics of all this begs for clarifica- tion. The Irish saying about a hard drinker, \"He'd suck whiskey off a wounded leg,\" emphasizes the orality of the alcoholic. The simple-minded notion that alcoholism could be stopped by making all drinking illegal (similar to the antimarijuana mad- ness that began a decade later) coincides with the repression of orality of that epoch.

When FDR ended alcohol Prohibition and began dis- tributing largesse to the one-third of the nation which he found \"ill-fed, ill-clothed and ill-housed,\" the conservative H. L. Mencken found precisely the right metaphor for the change, saying Roosevelt was turning the government into \"a milch-cow with 100,000,000 teats.\" But meanwhile the \"dry and lawless years\" saw women's hair retreat to a vanishing point along with the female breast. The \"boyish bob\" hairstyle, like the long hair of the young males in the late 1960s, moved society toward a unisex look, with the change coming that time from the distaff side. Was this a denial of sexuality similar to that championed by some of the women's liberationists of the 1960s? Not quite-for the hem of the skirt began to rise, and rose again and again, and female legs are also sexual stimulants. The erotic signals driven away from the female form above the navel were replaced by a secondary concupiscience below the thighs (see Figure 11). There seems to be a law of nature: Sex driven out the front door creeps back in through the side window. Still: To any male born after 1930 (or even more, to any born after 1940) photographs of the \"great beauties\" of the 1920s are a strange and eerie sight. Women they certainly are; attractive women, indeed-BUT WHERE ARE THEIR BREASTS? Hidden beneath special brassieres which pulled them down and flattened them into a boyish look attractive only to latent homosexuals (who were officially not supposed to exist in that age of Republican rectitude, Harding-Coolidge- Hoover, old-fashioned gunboat diplomacy that lacked any unctuous pretense that the people we were invading had invited us, a seeming ever-rising stock market, hip flasks and the naughty thrill of committing a crime every time you took a drink). American women had surrendered their breasts, just as Wilhelm Reich in Cltaracter Analysis, Frederick Perls in Gestalt Therapy Verbatim, Alexander Lowen in The Betragal of the Bodg and William C. Shutz in Here Comes Eaerybodg describe patients who had given up parts of their bodies in order to evade the painful conflict between biological need and social hypocrisy.

In the 1940s, reporting on women who had mostly reached maturity in those decades, Kinsey found that two out of fir'e of them '*'ere incapable of reaching orgasm until two years after beginning to have intercourse regularly. Perhaps all these symptoms were part of the price society had to pay in making the difficult transition from Victorian prudery to the contemporary \"hang loose\" ethic (see Figure 12). In that case, a lot of the crazy behavior on all sides of us today can be comfortably accepted as evidence that we are still in transition toward some kind of sexual sanitv. Nevertheless, it must be granted that the repression of the breast, historically, has often indicated the presence of an anal mentalitl' of a quite hostile nature. The nervous cover- ing-up of the female bosom in the Dark Ages ushered in the epoch of witch-burning and mass hysterias. G. Rattray Taylor, in Ser: in Histot\"y, frankly categorizes the Europe of that period as \"a cross between a madhouse and an abbatoir.\" The 1920s climaxed with 11,000,000 men unemployed and the gov- ernment and corporations clairning alternately that they were unable to do anything about the situation or that the \"lazy bums\" could so find work if they'd only look harder. Aptly enough, the sex goddess of the decade was flat-chested Theda Bara (rvhose name, self-created, was an anagram on Death Arab, and who was widely billed as \"The Vamp\"-short for vampire). Meanwhile, the fir'st generation of infants was being raised without breast-feeding. A glass or plastic bottle with a rubber \"nipple\" was shoved at them to prevent physical death (what happened to the soul is anybody's guess, but, being now grown, these plastic-nursed individuals are called \"plastic people\" by rock singer-composer Frank Zappa. Similally, a line from a popular 1960s movie, The Graduate-\"Plastics, Benjamin, Plastics!\"-applied to the same generation, immediately be- came part of folk speech, although few have traced this imagery back to its source in infant deprivation.) The female breast, in effect, had been banished from the United States, along with all legal booze. \"Normalcy,\" an ungrammatical r.vord at the time, but now accepted, was introduced by Pres- ident Wan'en Garniiiel Harding (\"Gamiliel the Stone-Head,\" in H. L. Mencken's estimation) and was the aim of the whole culture. \"Normalcy\" meant business-as-usual, everybody at 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"his or her desk on time, a huge contempt of the \"soft\" (i.e., oral) ideas of radicals and the appearance in industry of \"efficiency experts\" dedicated to destroying the last vestiges of organic human rhythms and relationships on the assembly line to keep all \"productive units,\" human and mechanical, moving to the ticking of one remorseless clock. Yes, clocks-and preoccupation with time-are very anal, according to Freud. Father Time-the old man with the scythe who mowes us all down eventually-is a version of the punish- ing father god, his irnagery directly derived from the Roman god Chronos (Time) who murdered his own children. The anal personality is created by rigid toilet-training schedules and remains preoccupied with scheduling things on time. There was even a fad, started in the 1920s, of \"schedule- feeding\" for infants. This teaching, which brought the anal temperament directly into the oral stage, insisted that infants should be fed at exactly the same times each day, no matter how hungry they became in the meantime, no matter how loud they screamed, no matter how instinctively guilty the mother felt listening to their terrified and enraged wails. The infants, lacking any sense of time or predictability, no doubt thought on each occasion (to the extent that they thought at all) that the food supply hacl been cut off permanently and they were about to starve. Eventually this sadistic doctrine-which was presented with great scientific \"authority,\" like the masturba- tion terror which convinced Victorians that any boy who pulled on his wand would go crazy, and the antimarijuana crusade of more recent date-collapsed entirely when mothers simply rebelled against it. Psychiatrists and pediatricians today almost uniformly condemn it, yet it is not something (like female circumcision) performed by ignorant savages in backward areas; it u'as done in the 1920s and early 1930s right here. The infants it was done to are now our (understandably) jumpy and suspicious 40- and 50-year-old citizens. One novelist of that age, a very talented man, once told me that almost his entire psychoanalysis was concerned with unearthing the effects which this schedule-feeding had had on his psyche. He still doesn't like women much.

She now hates doctors and in raising her own children follows nothing but her own intuition and compassion. Obviously, the flattening of the breast with special bras- sieres that pulled it down, the fad of the slim \"boyish\" look for women, the switching of infants from the breast to the bottle, the rise of \"efficiency\" and what Harry Truman was later to call \"dinosaur conservativism\" in industry, the decline of our native radical traditions like Populism, the triumph of puritanical and reactionary religiositv in such matters as the Prohibition Law and the banning of teaching evolution in schools, the sadistic tendency evidenced in schedule-feeding, the sudden rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan (rvhich became more powerful in the 1920s than at any tir.ne since the 1870s), the witch-hunt atinosphere shov'n by the Palmer Raids (in which folk-singing societies were sometimes art'ested en mo,sse if the local ptrtriots ,:ouldn't find any i'eal socialists) as well as by the later-a.tlmitted frame-up of union organizer Tom Mooney and the i,iobable frame-up of Sacco and Vanzetti-all indicate a strong sr,ving toward what G. Rattray Taylor calls a \"patrist\" orientation and the Freudians call anality. The fact that this went along with, rathel than against, an improvement of the status of u,omen (in contrast to Taylor''s patrist-n-ratrist chart given lzitel on page 88) should remind us that no period fits the generalizations of social scientists' \"laws\" exactlv, and that if history repeats, it always repeats with differences. Nevertheless, the period largely fits Taylor's schema, as do large epochs of the Middle Ages, the Empire period in Rome, etc. F. Scott Fitzgerald's booze-drinking free-lovers were not representatives of that era but rebels against it, like the pot-smoking hippies of the 1960s. The present author is not learned enough in sociology to attenrpt to sa-v rohaf caused uhut. The present tendency in the social sciences, however', is to abandon simple cause-effect and to describe clusters that seem to \"hang\" together, as I have just done. The questions, \"Did the flat-breast look cause efficiency experts to appear? Did efficiency experts cause the flat-breast look? Did Prohibition cause the banning of the teaching of evolution?\" etc., may just be versions of the old chicken-and-egg riddle. In any event, the present multanimity (a word coined by histolian Crane Brinton to signify the opposite of unanimity) in the social sciences gives us no cause 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"to expect answers until some major breakthrough places the whole field of human studies on a more scientific basis. In the meantime, we can at least note that the existence of these cultural clusters or configurations is becoming generally rec- ognized, however much the interpretations may differ. There is a story that Leo Frobenius, the German anthropolo- gist who turned Pablo Picasso on to African art and Ezra Pound to African poetry, once looked at a certain pot and said, more or less, \"If we go where that was found and dig, we will find traces of a culture having the following seven traits.\" He listed them; and after that, when an expedition was assem- bled and the digging was accomplished, Frobenius was proven right. This is not witchcraft or even ESP. Frobenius, the creator of the cluster concept-lculturmophologie, he called it-was acting on the principle that a tribe which creates a certain kind of pot will create a religion, an economic system, a fishing or hunting technique, a sexual ethic, etc., that all show the same preoccupations. Thus, the reader who has been following the clusters we have presented here, on being told that the women in ancient Crete, off the perimeter of Greek culture, wore no coverings on their breasts and even forced them upward into a prominent position, (see Figure 13) should be able to make a few educated guesses about Cretan culture. In fact, the Cretans did have most of the oral qualities, including worship of a mother goddess, sexual freedom and high status for women. Similarly, the fact that naked breasts began to appear in European painting around 1415, after being banned for centuries, should lead one to make some guesses about events following 1415; and, in fact, this was a turning point in the decline of the papal-patriarchal control of Europe and the renaissance of oral and matrist values. Of course, we are not asserting that the mere appearance of a nipple in public will bring all the other oral values in its wake; socially, causality is more complicated than that. (The Chinese saying, \"When the music changes, the walls of the city shake,\" often quoted by writers on rock, does not imply causality but what Jung calls synchronicity, as in the phi- losophy of the I Ching. The Chinese Taoist observes that changes in music and in politics occur together but does not attempt to convert one into the \"cause\" of the other; the notion that cause-and-effect explains all situations, or is appli- Figure 13: The bare-breasted, look was popular in Crete circa 1500 B.C.

Nevertheless, any item in a cluster can be taken as a sign or omen that the others must be on their way. The rooster's crow doesn't \"cause\" the dawn, but the dawn is certainly on its way u'hen you hear hinr. When the breast withers away to a vanishing point, other oral and maternal values are also drying up and atrophying; when the breast sprouts forth again, these values are also returning. By no accident, the most admired poem among Amelican intellectuals in the 1920s was T. S. Eliot's The W'aste Land; although actually dealing with his :rdopted country, England, his symbols spoke very eloquentl-v to American sensibilities also. The withdrawal of the breast is suggested in his images of wandering in the desert, of thirst, of the failed crops in the land ruled by an impotent king, of sterility in general. The most famous of Eliot's images-e.9.. \"lilacs out of dead land,\" \"The Hanged Man,\" \"the Unreal City,\" \"the corpse you planted last year in your garden,\" \"rock and no water and the sandy road\"-all revolve around the theme of life struggling to survive without nourishment. The final section, in the mduntains (breast symbols, according to Freud), brings the promise of rain and renewal. If all poets seek to summon the mother goddess in her guise as Muse, Eliot in a very real sense is calling for her to appear as wet nurse. But before looking at horv the 1930s began to ansrver that invocation, we should examine the historical background of mammary metaphysics a bit. That is the tonic of our next chapter. 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"mamfrrafY rnctaphysics TO: JEHOVA YAHWEH CARE: CELESTIAL HOTEI, (SUI'I'E #666) PRESIDENTIAI, TIER, PARADISE DEAR GOD: THIS IS TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR CT]RRENT POSITION AS DEITY IS HERE1VITH TERN{INATED DUE TO GROSS INC'ONIPE'TENCE STOP YOUR CHECK WILL BFJ MAII,ED STOP PI-EASE DO NOT I-ISE ME AS A REFERENCE RESPECTFULLY, MALACLYPSE THE YOUNGER1' -Malaclypse the Younger, Principia Discordia, or How I Fouttd Goddess uttcl Whet I did to Her When I Found Her.

In either event, it seems that the starry cosmos, in those days, was conceived as a great mother who had given birth to the life of the earth. Wise old women (tbe wiccas, wise ones, from whom we get the word witches) were thought to have a special affinity with her. Above all, this goddess was not a metaphor or an idea; she was a living presence, just as the American Indians to this day refer to the earth as a living mother and still fondly expect that eventually she will throw off the maniacal whites whose technology seems to be largely an attack on her. Quite similar- ly, the early Romans conceived the thickest band of stars in the sky as the Via Galactica, the Way of Milk, from which we get our familiar expression the Milky Way. To them and to the Greeks this was literally a mist of milk across the heavens, spurted upward from the breasts of the earth-goddess, Hera. Goethe's Faust provides a classic example of the same breast quest conveyed in a different symbolism: FAUST: A lovely dream once came to me; I then beheld an apple tree, And there two fairest apples shone: They lured me so I climbed thereon. YOUNG WITCH: Apples have been desired by you Since first in Paradise they grew; And I am moved with joy to know That such within my garden grow. Freud commented tersely on this exchange: \"There is not the slightest doubt what is meant by the apple-tree and the apples.\" In fact, a nice appLe-dumpling shop is Cockney slang for a pair of firmly rounded breasts. Some readers will be thinking of the Garden of Eden at this point, and they are probably right. It has long puzzled and provoked scholars that both Eve in that story, and the Goddess Eris in Greek mythology, are associated with apples (see Figures 14 and 15) and that the apples in both cases made a great deal of trouble. In the Hebrew story, Eve insists on eating a certain apple (actually, Genesis only says fruit, but tradition has always identified it with the apple), and Yahweh, the local volcano-god, is thrown into a fury and curses her and all mankind, for reasons that are far from perfectly clear. In the Greek story, Zeus slights Eris by not inviting her to a 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"banquet on Olympus and she gets her revenge by manufactur- ing a golden apple inscribed KALLISTI (\"To the prettiest one\") and rolling it into the banquet hall. Immediately all the goddesses begin squabbling, each claiming to be the prettiest one and entitled to the apple; this quarrel worsens until men as well as gods are drawn into it and eventually the Trojan War results. Eris became known as the goddess of chaos and the golden apple is called the apple of discord. The similarities here-the role of the female, the presence of the apple, the sequence of supernatural calamities-suggest that there might be a common origin to these myths. Such is indeed the case, according to Joseph Campbell's monumental four-volume study, The Masks of God. The Genesis text is very late and has altered the original myth to fit the patriarchal context of the religion of Yahweh. Originally, Eve was not Adam's wife, but his mother; she was not a human, but a goddess; and the outcome was not tragic, but triumphant- after the magic fruit was eaten, Adam himself became a god. (There is still a hint of this in the Genesis version, in which Yahweh says nervously, \"Behold, the man has become as one of us [the gods], to know good and evil.\") What was originally involved was probably a psychedelic sacrament,like the Eleu- sinian festival in Athens, in which the worshipers ate certain (hallucinogenic) foods and became one with the Mother God- dess Demeter. Eve and Eris, in short, are negative patriarchal versions of the bona dea (good goddess) of Rome, the earth- mother whose milk covers the sky at night, the Isis of Egypt, Ishtar of Babylon, the all-protective figure who has descended directly from the huge-breasted Venus of Willendorf-that numismatic deity who is just an extension on the cosmic scale of the vision of the infant at the breast. Nor is she entirely dead yet. Robert Graves in The White Goddess insists that all true poets have a vision of her at some time or other, at the very least in their dreams. Contemporary witch covens still worship her and I have personally attended a quite beautiful ceremony-in Minneapolis, Minnesota, no less-in which she was invoked and spoke through the witch queen to declare: You shall be free, and as a sign that you be really so, be naked in your rites, dance, sing, feast, make music and love.

Nor do I demand aught in sacrifice, for behold, I am the mother of all living, and my love is poured out upon the earth. This is quite lovely, I think; and it is also, beyond debate, a purely oral religion. The goddess is an extension of the infant's picture of the breast, if the breast could speak. Thus, Wolfgang Lederer, M.D., describes the great mother goddess as virtually an extension in space-time of the breasts themselves: Her breasts, for instance, for the sake of rvhich the Babyloni- ans called her \"The Mother rvith the fruitful breasts,\" she whose breasts never f ailed, never went dry-they were occasionally . . . reduced to stylized rings or spirals, but they were nlore often lustily stressed, and most impressively so by multiplication. The gleat Diana of Ephesus is usually repre- sented with numerous breasts-I count up to 16-and the Mexican Goddess of the Agave, Mayauel, has 400. Their function is obvious enough, and sorne of the niost beautiful and touching icons of the goddess show hel with the infant at her breast, whether she be the Egyptian Isis with the child Horus or her equivalent in Asia Minor, Ur, prehistoric Sardinia, Mexico and Peru or contemporary Africa, or of course one of the innumer- able virgins with child of Christian art: these, especially during the later middle ages, accomplish such tenderness and intimacy of expression, such union of aninial warmth and purest spiritu- ality, that one is easily long lost in contemplation. . . . Moreover, the Goddess we describe is no mere human mother, giving human milk to the child of her flesh and blood, nor yet simply a divine mother, rvith a child human or divine: fol from her nipples may flow, not milk, but honey-as in Palestine, which was the land of milk and honey on her behalf, or at Delphi, where her priestesses \\r'ere called Melissdi-\"bees\"- and her shrine'*'as likened to a beehive. Or, wondelful to behold, all kinds of fishes may drop from her nipples, as among the Eskimo. Indeed, she not only gives birth to all manner of animals, she also feeds them, giving each what it needs, and \"Alma Mater\" that she is, she tlay-wonder of wonders-give such to bearded men, to scholars, feeding them r,visdom. She is, in short, the source of all food, material or spiritual. No wonder she is proud of her breasts. And, hence, quite naturally, she holds theni, either to shol.v them off, or to offer more convenientlv their fullness .''

In contrast, and despite the orality of Jesus himself, the Judeo-Christian faiths are strongly anal13 and their stern Father God demands endless sacrifices, offers no joy on earth but only duty blindly obeyed, and threatens sadistic tortures (for an infinite number of years, according to some theologi- ans) to anyone who crosses him. It almost seems as if history, at least in the Occident, repeats the pattern Freud found in the nursery, from oral bliss to anal anxiety. This was the opinion, in the last century, of the German folklorist J. Bachofen, of the American anthropologist Lewis Morgan, and of Karl Marx's financial supporter and col- laborator, Friedrich Engels. Their hypothesis of a single his- torical pattern, in which all societies evolve from matriarchal communism to patriarchal capitalism (and then back to com- munism, according to Engels), was widely accepted for about 50 years, but then evidence that conflicted with it began accumulating. Some societies were never matriarchal; some alleged matriarchies were actually only matrilineal-that is, descent and property were passed through the female line, but men still held the chieftainships or governorships; and, if some of Bachofen's inspired guesses about prehistorical Europe were startlingly right, others were glaringly wrong. The theo- ry of primordial matriarchy was rejected by anthropologists as thoroughly as the luminiferous ether was rejected by physicists. Only in the last few years has it had some revival, under the impact of new data collected and polemically pro- claimed by female scholars more or less allied with the Women's Liberation Movement. Meanwhile, Leo Frobenius in Germany, G. Rattray Taylor in England and Joseph Campbell in our country have all collected and published voluminous data showing that if the primitive matriarchy did not exist as universally as the 19th-Century theorists imagined, something much like it existed just before the dawn of recorded history in the West and Near East and coexisted with the first patriarchal civilizations for a while. r3Martin Luther, for instance, had his peak religious experience in the privy.

It is curious, in passing, that the Women's Liberation Move- ment, the latest and most revolutionary of these waves, is paradoxically more patrist than much of what preceded it chronologically. This is noteworthy in regard to Taylor's points 1, 4, 5,7, 8 and 11-permissiveness versus restriction, welfare versus chastity, authoritarianism versus democracy, attitude toward research, inhibition versus spontaneity and ascetism versus hedonism. On all of these issues the iibera- tionists are distinctly moving backward toward an anal- patrist orientation rather than forward toward oral-matrist \"Consciousness III.\" They not only incline toward Victorian prudery, but have levived the old Victorian delight in sexual slander and blackmail. Just as the great h'ish rebel, Charles Steward Parnell, fell into disgrace and '*'as ruined when his adultery with Kitty O'Shea was discovered and denounced by the Catholic clergy, many radical heroes have been cast down from their previous emience u'hen these ladies published sexual expos6s of them (with names omitted, but all other details immediately recognizable) in their magazines. (Some- times the names are included, as recently happened to a gentle Black pacifist, who was not even accused of unethical acts but just of having the lvrong ideas, but who nonetheless suffered the humiliation of having his mind, soul, body and his \"golden penis,\" no less, roundly condemned in several issues of a radical journal.) Not onll' are their dogmas sacrosanct, demo- cratic discussion scorned and scientific research rejected (as \"male\"), but many of them have announced that reason itself is deeply suspect and now frankly embrace lhe \"credo quia u,ltsu.t'dutn\" (\"I believe because it is absurd\") of the church fathers. Rejection of science and of free discussion are, of course, characteristic of all totalitarian movements; thus, nonbiblical astronomy was heretical to the Inquisition, unpalatable an- thropology was \"Jewish\" to the Nazis, unsatisfactory biology was banned as \"bourgeois\" in Stalin's Russia and irritating ethology is \"sexist\" (and unpleasant psychology is \"chauvin- ist\") to these ladies. Like all other totalitarian fiats, this is intellectually protected by concentric circles of similar rhetor- ic. Thus, to question the concept of witchcraft or heresy in the days of the Inquisition automatically meant that one was a witch or a heretic. To say that science is neither Jewish nor gentile, socialist nor bourgeois, but merely the activity of 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"independent minds attempting to be objective, opened one to suspicion of being \"Jewish\" in Germany or \"bourgeois\" in Russia. To say that behaviorai sciences cannot be dismissed rvith epithets like \"sexist\" and \"chauvinist\" is to convince these ladies that the speaker is \"sexist\" and \"chauvinist.\" To push the argument one step further and say that such protec- tive rationalizatton prevents objective inquiry is to encounter the same rhetoric in a third concentric armor and again to be charged with heresy, Jewishness, bourgeois tendencies or sexism, etc. At the furthest extreme, where communication has been reduced to the mere stubborn hope of trying to communicate, is the \"credo qu.ia u,bsttrdum.\" or, in its modern form, \"You're just being rational-can't you feeL the truth?\" At this point reason retires from the field, defeated as usual by the v'ill to believe. One is reminded of a story about Mark Twain and his very fashionable and respectable Nerv England wife, rvho once tried to cure him of his salty riverboat speech. Mrs. Twain noted every cuss word he used all weerk long and then woke him Sunday morning and read it all back to him. Twain listened calmly and commented, \"You have the words, my dear, but you haven't got the music yet.\" Women's liberationists have the lvords of freedom, equality, human dignity, etc., but they haven't got the music at all. Perhaps this is due to the strongly anal and Germanic in- fluence exerted by Karl Marx. But a young friend of mine, more ingeniously, explains it as the desiderata of the large nurnber of ex-nuns in the women's lib camp who have brought with them the pontifical attitudes of the Roman patriarchy. Nonetheless, the movement is the latest wave of an obvious matrist floodtide and as such destined to play a large role in the next few decades. Let us hope that their shell of dogma will be softened by the noisy splashing of all the other odd and colorful fish swimming about in the free waters of Conscious- ness III. Meanwhile, their many books proving that everything worthwhile was invented by r.r'omen (like the equally excellent tomes by Black liberationists ploving that all culture is of Negro origin) at least have the virtue of reminding us of the bias that makes most history texts sound as if all progress is orving to White males.

In Babylon, Minoan Crete, early Egypt and Etruscan Italy it appears that the chief deity was the great mother, whose statues, showing her with bared breasts, look remark- ably alike whether her local name be Astarte, Ishtar, Isis or Ashtoreth (see Figure 16). Women served as judges, priest- esses, and, it appears, sometimes as governors. They had all the rights of men, could buy and sell property, engage in business, sign contracts, obtain easy divorce and they were widely considered to have a capacity superior to males in understanding what the goddess wanted and expected of her human children. From all one can gather, they had none of the misanthropy of current women's lib types or of the 19th- Century suffragettes. But why should they have hated men? At that stage, men had apparently never oppressed them. \"History begins with the emergence of men from female rule,\" Robert Graves has written, with slight exaggeration, in Mammon and the Black Godd'ess. Other historians, without any obvious promale or antifemale bias, still dissent from this broad view and suggest that female rule (in the manner of the male rule we are familiar with in later times) was compara- tively rare and that something more like that elusive ideal senual equalitg seemed to prevail in these early city-states. More remarkable yet, the absence of defenses or other signs of embattlement around these sites has convinced many arche- ologists that there was no organized warfare, either, and it even seems that slavery itself did not emerge until much later. Will Durant, in The Storg of Ciuilization, quoting a wide sampling of the best archeological evidence, argues persua- sively that slavery was created after the subjugation of women and was probablg inspired bg it. In China, curiously, a very similar pattern has been dis- cerned by contemporary scholarship. As Joseph Needham demonstrates in a remarkable six-volume study, Science and Ciailization in Cltina, the matrist and matriarchal values there were preserved in that remarkable text, the Tao T0 Ching, which praises a figure quite cognate with the great goddess of the Mediterranean area: The Valley Spirit never dies She is called the Eternal Woman Figure 16: This mother godd,ess from Ur is 4000 years old,.

Needham concludes that Chinese culture, before the Chou dynasty, was probably ma- ti'ilinetrl and vaguely along the lines of Bachofen's classic m atri:rrchies. Even after the rise of the patriarchal governing class, women retained most of their traditional rights in Sparta until well within historictrl times. (Plato, whose Republic is con- sidered pro-Sp:rrtan propaganda by sorne histoli:rns, included equality for women in his ideal nation, along with such other Spartan institutions as state socialism and the Iamentable Stalinist censorship of the arts.) Even in Athens, where the rvives u'ele rednced to a condition onll'slightly above that of the slaves, the courtesan class had rnost of the freedom enjoyed by nonslave males. The Athenians seem to have made the great divorce between serual love and sexual reproduction that chtrracterizes so many ltrter societies. Their lvric poems are alnrost alrvzrys written to courteszrns or to -vollng boys; they never seem to have felt r'omantic zrbout the lvomen who mothered their children. Throughout these first pagan patriarchies, horvever, love and sex rvere still erijolred antl praised as great olntrments of life ancl inextricably connected rvith tire religious life. The Old Testaurent, like the popular marriage manuals circa 1920- 1960, glorifies sex in marriage as the highest of hnman joys- and does not neglect the breasts. (\"Rejoice with the rvife of thy youth . . . Let hei'bi'easts satisfy thee at all times,\" Proverbs 5:18-19.) The Song of Solomon even seems, to the literal- mindecl reader', to be praising fornication-but subtle rabbis and Christian theologians have repetrtedly argued that it means quite the opposite of u'hat it appetus to say.. (Actuallv, as Robert Graves has noted, the Song looks ver'}' niuch like tire chants which accompanied rites of fertility-magic in the old matriarchal religion or in the still-surviving witch cult.)

Some cults derived therefrom survive in New Orleans and other parts of the American South.) The Nuit-Isis cults summarized their teach- ing in the aphorism, revived in our time by Aleister Crowley, \"The Khabs is in the Khu.\" (Khabs is the divine or eternal part of humanity; Khu is the female genital, origin of our word cunt.) It is not \"licentiousness\" or lack of religion, but the serual basis of their religion, that led the Egyptians to portray their gods in manners shocking to Christian observers: Atem depicted as masturbating, Isis as performing fellatio on on her brother-husband Osiris, etc. Another biological depiction of Egyptian origin, Isis nursing the infant Horus, was, however, acceptable to the Christians and some of these statues later found their way into Christian temples, with Isis renamed Mary and Horus changed to Jesus (see Figure 17). But by then the meaning had been lost and, as Kenneth Grant says in ?he Reuiual of Magic, the physical basis of Egyptian religion had become the metaphysics of the Christian and Hellenistic phi- losophers. That is, insofar as sex was admitted into religion at all, a la the Song of Solomon, it was interpreted as a symbol of a spiritual relationship. Homer's favorite adjective for well-stacked females was bathykolpos, which means having ample breasts. Considering that the poet was, according to all ancient sources, blind, he must have learned to appreciate this feature by braille sys- tem, and he evidently enjoyed the experience. Interestingly enough, Homer's values are largely matrist. Some have even suggested that Homeric works are older than usually assumed and actually trace back to a quasi or totally matriarchal period; Samuel Butler, Robert Graves and Elizabeth Gould Davis have all argued that Homer was a woman. Certainly, he regarded Achilles and the other military heroes in his poems as somewh al crazy and saved his real affection for Odysseus, who started out as a draft-dodger, went to the war reluctantly and always excercised his celebrated craftiness in trying to find a way to get home to his beloved wife and away from all that pointless bloodshed. It has also been observed that Homer has a special fondness for the old goddesses and tends to treat Zeus as something of a comic character, much like the old crank of later farcical writers. Nevertheless, one modern women's lib writer, Nancy R. McWilliams, has denounced Homer as male chauvinist because Odysseus had all the fun of Figure 17: Isis, with the infant Horus, prefigured the Christian Marg.

Whether Homer was a feminist, a nlale chauvinist or a woman himself (herself?), he (she?) has all the qualities found in recent male poets, who are notoriously antigovernment, antiwar, antiauthority and fond of women, children, nature and sexuality. Obviously, he was in Freudian terms an oral personality. In any case, his values (and those of later poets like Euripides, Sophocles, the anonyrrous authors of the Greek AnthoLogll, etc.) lvere alu'ay's compatible u.ith sexual Iove, however much the relationship between men and women had been rendered problematical by the patriarchal systern, which had reduced women to second-class citizens. With the coming of Christianity, this last vestige of the old matrist systetn crumbled. Women became less than second- class citizens: They became outcasts, pariahs, tools of Satan to be fearecl and distrusted. Their bleasts became, not a proof that the high gods loved the world and deliberately graced it rvith beauty, but a sly trap designed by Satan to lure men into fleshlv sin. Women were \"sacks of dung,\" according to Origen; they deserved to be treated like untrustworthy slaves, Augus- tine reasoned, because it was a woman, Eve, who had brought evil into the world; they were inclined to fornicate u,ith devils, according to Sprenger the Inquisitor, because their lusts were too extreme to be satisfied by mortal men. If they were not all witches, the Fathers agreed solemnly, they certainl.y* needed a Iot of careful watching. Considering that the current r,\"'omen's lib rvriters largely share the antisexual bias of the church fathers, it is curious that they haven't yet revived Augustine's celebrated argu- ment that sexual .feeling itself is a curse imposed upon us as punishment for the sin of Adam and Eve. According to the bishop's curious reasoning, Adam and Eve, before the Fall, had no sexual feelings at all, and this is the way God intended us to be. To the question, holr'did they manage to reprodnce without sensation, Augustine gave an answer that is worthy of the consideration of ladies like Ti-Grace Atkinson: The organs of generation, he says, moved by \"Will Power.\" His defense of this assertion, probably the most influential flight of reasoning in the r,r'hole histor-v of Christian theology, is worth reproducing: There ale persons who can move their eals, either otre at a 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"time, ol both together.

Does all this sound absurd and hideous to you? In F reudian terms, that is because a great many oral and female values have crept back into our society in the last few centuries. None of this sounded absurd or hideous to the totally anal personali- ties of men like Augustine and Aquinas and Luther. They u,'ere not mad, but coldly logical: Thev never beiieved anything that they could not prove in neat, technically precise syllo- gisms. In the last century, the great mathematician George Boole even proved that the whole methodology of theological logic could be converted into mathematical equations, and every bit of it lvas sound, internally consistent and valid-once the original assumptions 'i'v'ere granted. There was nothing wrong with the brains of the theologians. It was sirirply that their feelings had atrophied. Later, lvhen we examine Jungian psychology and the Hindu chukro.s, rve will see that banishing the goddess archetl'pe had impoverished their sensibilitl' and dezrdened certain emotional centers which we now assume are innate in all human beings.

That clenial of one part of the human body did not \"cause\" all the other strange behaviors rve have chronicled, but it .,vas certainly related to them. When the breast began to stage a comeback, oral values in general began to reappear in European culture (see Figure 18). The fir'st early waves of the new paganism appeared in southern France in the 11th and 12th centuries. Ideas from the Sufis and other Arabian mystics began to find an audience. The sexual doctrines of the Sufis, involving semiritualized intercourse with a beloved female as a specifically religious act, found a particularly enthusiastic support in certain cit'- cles-and have gone on to influence the vocabuiary of our poets ever since, as Ezra Pound fir'st demonstrated in his 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Figure 18: A late medieual wood, panel, showing Marg suckLing the-infant Christ, herald'ed the ,\"i*\"rg\"n\"\" of the breast and reaiual of oral aalues, Courtesy of Gabriel D.

Overtly, the new spirit began with Eleanor of Aquitaine, whose reputed bare-breasted ride through Jerusalem may or may not have actually happened, but has been widely believed for centuries. This was in many ways a historical turning point, and obviously much more was involved ihan a mere prank. At the very least, she showed a great sense of ap- propriate symbolism. Like freckle-faced Phryne, Eleanor seems to have cherished both her beauty and her.intellect and could not be persuaded by any male priesthood of a male god that she should hide either. (There were no Marxian feminists around to tell her she was making herself a \"sex object.\") She also seems to have convinced a large segment of the Flench nobility that love is a greater sport than war and that a man who wrote love poems was more virile than a conqueror of cities. This led to the outbreak of Provengal \"troubadour\" poetry and the similar verse of the minnessingers in South Germany, along with the famous \"Courts of Love\" in which subtle points of sexual etiquette and romantic decorum were taught. The cynical remark that \"love was invented in the 11th Century\" is not true, but it is emphatically true that most of our modern ideas about love were invented then, largely due to Eleanor's influence.

Her husband, Henry II, a jealous type, put her under house arrest in a rather lonely castle and firmly ended her personal involvement with the cultural re- volution she had instigated. The revolution, however, continued. The troubadour cult of love became a powerful rival to the church's cult of ascetism and the feudal lords' cult of war; the role of women was steadily elevated-and, as Ernest Jones pointed out in his psychoanalytical history of chess, the role of the queen on the chessboard changed from the weakest to the strongest piece.

Eventu- ally, the church itself was infected with the nerv spirit, and the Mother of Jesus, a shadowy and insignificant ligure previous- ly, advanced, like the queen in chess, to a dominant position which she still holds in orthodox Catholic countries. As a sort of climax, the greatest of all Catholic poets, Dante. made his childhood sweetheart, Beatrice Portinari, so important in his Diuine Comed'y that she inadvertently overshadows Jesus, God the Father and even the Virgin Mary herself, making this orthodox Christian poem a mole exalted pelsonal love-lylic than the deliberately heretical poems in which the French troubadours hacl blasphemously raised their rnistresses and girl friends above the saints.

In a Europe still totally Catholic, there was no way of legalizing such a relationship, but Sordello and cunni za evi- dently trusted the heretical \"Courts of Love\" more than the dusty tomes of the church fathers. (Dante, curiously, did not put either of them in his Hell. Sordello is in purgatory, ancl, odder yet, Cunniza is in Paradise-because she freecl her slaves. A number of scholars have qr.restioned Dante's ortho- doxy.) For Cunniza, Sordello wrote what Ezra pound arnong others has praised as the noblest hyperbole in the history of love poetry: If I see you not, lady with whom I anr entranced, No sight I see is rvorth the beauty of niy thought. This kind of thing evidently became commonplace: The troubadour cabestan was murde'ed by a jealous husbancl who then (possibly consider.ing himself a figure in Greek tragedy) cut out poor Cabestan's heart and served it at dinner to his faithless wife, telling her it was a deer's. When she had enjoyed it, the scoundrel told her what it had actually been, and she threw herself from a balcony and died on the rocks below. This near-incredible but true story is dramatizecr in Pound's Canto 4 and Richard Aldington's ,,The Eaten Heart\"; I cannot imagine rvhy Puccini did not nrake an opera of it. Eventually, the Knights Templal. were suppressed by the Inquisition (123 of them were burned at the stake after being tortured into confessing a long string of abominations which most historians regard as fictitious) and the Albigensian Cru_ sade was launched-ostensibly against the sexually pernris- sive Cathari sect, but once rolling, decirnating the population of southern France' in rvhat Kenneth Rexroth has bitterly caiied \"the ll'orst actrocity in history, before the invention of Progress.\" The Templars did not revive until the lgth Century and the Cathari only came back in the 1g20s. The values of papist patriarchy reconquered all Eu.ope until the protestant schism and retains Southern Europe to this day. Romantic poetry r.l'ith its matrist and oral values survived a'd actually prevailed. Geoffrey chauce'imported the ideolo- gl' to Engiand with his Knight's Tale and some of his shorter. t'ondels; by Elizabethan tintes this hacl virtually become the tohoLe of poetry. Thus, Shakespear.e could write about any- thing that struck his imagination wiren he was writing for the stage, but as soon as he started writing poetry for the printed 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"page, he fell inevitably into the language, the themes, the traditional conceits and the entire apparatus of troubadour love-mysticism. So great was Shakespeare's influence, in turn, that rvhen modern poets finally began writing about other subjects around 1910, established opinion was shocked and it u'as said that such material was '(unpoetic\"-as if Honrer's battles, Ovid's mysticism, Juvenal's indignation, Villon's earthiness, Lucretius's rationalism, the Greek Anthology's cynicism, Piers Plowman's social protest, etc., had never ex- isted and onLy the troubadour love-mystique had ever been poetry. Considering how anal our culture had largely been, except for the matrist interlude of Eleanor and her circle, it is astonishing to realize that (just like our religious progenitor, Jesus) our most influential poet-dramatist, Shakespeare, was a distinctly oral type. A fairly consistent imagery of interrelated themes of sucking and chewing runs through all the plays and sonnets and has helped scholars determine that contrary to more romantic theories they are all the wcirk of one person. (Examples: \"Sucking the honey of his ye1ys\"-f161mLet; \"If music be the food of love, play on\"-TweLfth Night; \"Where the bee sucks, there suck I\"-7lze Tempest; \"What a candy deal of courtesy .\"-jtsnry I\\', Part One.) Oscar Wilde's theory that the bard was homosexual, or bisexual, is not as lvell- established as gay liberation writers like to think- Shakespeare's actual imagery is virtually always heterosexu- al, as Eric Partridge demonstrates in Slta.kespeare's Bawdyby simply listing all the sexual references in the complete works. But, like Jesus, he had so strong a tender (\"feminine\") com- ponent that people who identify masculinity r.r'ith brutality are naturally inclined to think he was queer. The nicknames lecorded by his contemporaries-\"Sweet Will\" and \"Gentle Will\"-indicate lather clearly that this bearded, bald-headed, chronically impoverished, socially unacceptable and runt- sized son of a small-town butcher was much closer, in type, to AIIen Ginsberg than to Ernest Hemingway. Nevertheless, he aclored the ladies-literally-and it seems nlore than a few of them adored him in return. It is apt that Venus is the aggressive seducer of Adonis in his long poem on that legend; t.nen of this type very often \"play the waiting game\" (as Kurt Weill called it in Septentber Song) and allov' the woman to rrrake the advances. (If they are chess players, they will favor' 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"the \"soft\" Reti or Alekhine openings instead of the aggressive centel gantes.) James Joyce even argued, on the basis of the sexual imagery in the plays, that Anne H:rthaway had seduced Shakespeare; certainly, theirs was a slightly forced wedding, the first child being born six months after the marriage ceremony. The bard's romanticism, which no F)nglish or American poet has ever managecl to escape catching to some degree, comes right out of Eleanor''s and Pierre Vidal's Sufi-influenced sexual mysticism, as we have seen. Another influence, as Francis Yates has argued plausibll, in Giorcluno Brrtno and the Herme- tic Traditio??, was the ai'ch-heretic Bruno of Nola, burned at the stake ir-r Ronre in 1600. Bruuo seel11s to have been the model for Berou'ne in Shakespeare's LLtue's Lubour's Lost. He was in England around 1583-85 and his sonnet sequence, .D€ gLi eroici Juror'i, published at Oxford in 1585, is a celebration of sexual love with interspersed prose passages relating these poems to the mystic quest for Unity (Freud's \"oceanic exper- ience\"). Berowne's great speech in Loue's Laltour's Lost- For valour is not Love a Hercules Still climbing tlees in the Hesperides? Subtle as Sphinx, as sr.r'eet and musical As blight Apollo's lute, strung u'ith his hair'; And rvl.ren Love speaks, the voice of all the gods Make heaven drowsy with the hartnotry -is not mere pretty language, as such things usually are in Shakespeare's countless imitators. It is a heretical statement, following Bruno's sonnets and the tradition of Eleanor of Aquitaine, bolding declaring the path of the lover superior to that of the soldier or the ascetic. As Francis Yates suggests, it is even possible that Prospero the Magician in The Tempestis also modelecl on Bruno's magico-Hermetic plactices, which involved quite zr bit of the old Cathari-Templar'-troubadour tradition of sernal occultism. Ezra Pound, the modern poet rvho has given the most careful attention to historical resealch on the evolution of these notions, explains in somewhat guardecl language (he was writing for the prudish English public in 1933): They fthe troubadours] are opposed to tr form of stupidity not limited to Eui'ope, that is, idiotic asceticism and a belief that the body is evil. . . . 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The senses at fir'st seern to project a ferv;'ards bey'ond the body . . .

Actually-see any Tibetan painting of the yubyum position, as it is called-sitting in each other''s laps in the double-lotus position is basic to all sexual yoga. According to some rvriters there are neurological rea- sons for this-it allegedlv diverts the sexual energv or bioelec- tricity from the central nervous system and sends it into the autonomic (involuntary) system-but, from a Freudian point of view, it restores the male to the ptLrely passiae role of the infant at the breast and thus represents the oralization of the genital embrace. Not unexpectly, the purpose of this is to recapture Freud's \"oceanic experience\" or the \"tlance of Unity\" as mystics call it. In some traditions, influenced by Gnostic magic ideas, the couple stares into each other's eyes; cf. Donne's \"and pictures in our eyes to get/Was all our propagation.\" This method is also a form of birth control, since it allows the male to experience orgasm without ejaculation. It was used for contraception in the anarcho-communist \"free love\" commune of the Bible Perfectionists of the farrrous Oneida Colony in upstate New York, circa 1840-1870. Con- temporary Tantric teachers tell pupils to imitate the famous statues of the Black Temple near Benares-the one v'ith the erotic carvings-and seek a similar imnobility; cf. Donne's \"We like sepulchral statues lay.\" This position can be con- tinued far longer than any other sexual pastime, and Baba Ram Dass may have been using it on the famous occasion when, under LSD, he remained in sexual ecstasy for hours and hours; cf.

Specifically, the repeat- ed, perfectiy clear identifications of the poet's mistress with a goddess are part of the mental set, or ritual, connected with this cult.

When anthropologist Weston La Barre says, \"Motl-rers make magicians; fathers, gods,\" he means that the magic or sha- manistic trance is a return to the bliss at the breast of the all-giving tnother, while religion is an anal propitiation of a fearful god who is an enlarged portlait of the punishing father. These distinctions do not always remain sharp- Tantra managed to get incorporated into the patrist frame- rvork of Hinduism, and Sufi sex-magic into the equall.v patrist Mosient faith of Allah. In the West, however, patriarchy became extreme; Jehovah would bode no rivals, Ieast of all a goddess equal to himself, and the magic-matriarchal-oral cults were driven underground, masqueraded as pseudo-sciences like alcherny, or came forth only ir-r the fornt of poetry. Even so, patriarchy is so nervous of rivals in the West that the poet has come under considerable suspicion at many times, is often thought to be \"queer\" in one sense or another and, in the most anal cultures, often seems to be deliberately ignored or starved into submission. (If he is liind enongi-r to die young, he is then forgiven and becomes a kind of seculal Christ or' martyr, as in the Dylan Thomas cult.) In England, the preju- dice is so bad, Robert Graves notes in The White Grtdcless,that poets, when forced to identifv themselves-on government forms or in courtloottts, say-will almost al'ivavs use such terms as ttteachet',\" ttnovelist,\" tthistorian\" or whatever else they happen to be besides poets. In Mammon and the Black Goddess, Graves nicely sum- marizes the relationship between poetry and the old oral cults of magic and matriarchy: The poet is, on the whole, anti-authoritarian, agoraphobic and intuitive rather than intellectual; but his judgments ale coher- ent. Symptoms of the trance in tvhich poetic composition occurs differ greatly from those of an inducetl mediunristic trance; though both seem directed by an extertral power. In a poetic trance, which happens no more predictably than a miglaine ol an epileptic fit, this power is traditionally identified with the ancient Muse-goddess.

Poetry and magic, then, are based on a belief that thought can create its own reality-which Sir James Frazer in The Golden Bouglt called the theory of \"the omnipotence of thought\" and which Freud, in his comment on Frazer's an- thropological investigations in Totem and Taboo, traced back to the child's power, with an outcry of desire, to make the missing mother mysteriously appear again and offer the all- providing breast. It is no accident, then, that so many poems, from the Odyssey right up to Joyce's great prose-poem, Finne- gans Wake, contain magical \"invocations\" summoning the goddess to appear at once. We can now see that there might have been more than a joke in the famous exploit of Eleanor's father, Guillaume of Aqui- taine, who built a private brothel or harem on his land in the exact architectural style of contemporary convents. The \"con- vents\" of the old matriarchal religions, of course, had been devoted to what is alternately called hierogamy or sacred prostitution or sex magic; perhaps Guillaume had been con- sciously trying to revive that. And when Eleanor herself rode through Jerusalem with bared breasts, she also may have been prompted by more than high spirits. It is traditional in many schools of initiation to require some such public act, which is thought to have magical significance and also sepa- rates one sharply from the obedient servants of the existing establishment. Parading those emblems of matriarchal fertili- ty-worship through the Holy Land of the worid's three strongest patriarchal religions-Judaism, Christianity and Is- lam-may have been an act of fealty to the old mother goddess and an invocation attempting to restore her worship. If so, it has only been partially successful. . . thus far. The taboo on showing the breast is certainly odd if one considers it in relation to the attractive features of other animals. One does not read of peacocks who are ashamed of their gorgeous tail-feathers, of goldfish hiding their lovely fiery-yellow markings, of lionesses having squeamish feelings about their brutal beauty. Yet a woman of today (unless she is a professional topless dancer) might still go through the processes which the psychologist Flugel described in 1930: 110 A woman may, for exanrple, r'efrain from going to a dance in a"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"very dAcoUell dress: (a) Because, although she thinks it becomes her and she experiences a real gratification at the sight and feeling of her bare upper body, she yet expetiences a sense of shame and embarrassment at the mere fact that she should do so.

(b) Because, although she experiences none of the scruples just mentioned and freely enjoys the sight of herself in her milror, she yet fears that she may unduly stimulate sexual clesile in her prospective partners; in this case the modesty is still directed against desire, but now refers to feelings in others rather than to feelings in the seif.

Worse yet, the picture grows still rnore complex if the lady is married, for now she will consider her husband's wishes in the matter, as Flugel goes on to point out. The husband may wish her to dress daringly if he is relatively free of neurotic jealously and/or enjoys Veblen's \"conspicuous consumption.\" Flaunting her breasts, then, is his way of showing other men what a prize he has captured. On the other hand, he may fear this as leading to dangerous competition. Judging by the way Arab u'omen have traditionally beerr folced to dress, Alab tnen are particularly paranoid about such possibilities (see Figure 19).

This phrase is from conservative historian Kurt Vogelin and refers, in technical theological language, to the heresy of the Gnostics, who wished to produce heaven on this earth instead of postponing it until after death.

This is certainl-v sane, and beyond dispute; but Freud had slipped in some dubious qualifications ancl limitations u'hen \\\\'e \\veren't looking. His reality principle turned out to include a great deal of repres- sion that could not be justified by any real dangers at all, except the discomfort of colliding with Freud's own remnants of a Victorian superego. Masturbation, fol instance, does no objective harm; adultery, which admittedly can lead to fist- fights or even murder in some cases, is neutral in others ancl most certainly h:rs been beneficial at times; homosexuality' is dangerous only when discovered by a cruel and prudish socie- ty. Horv rxuch reality principle is there in the rept'ession that permeates every day of every life in this civilization? This, of course, is the heart of the Consciousness III debate. Charles Reich's The Greenirtg oJ America became a runaway best seller-despite the fact that the majority of reviews were bitterly hostile-because Reich articulated u'hat rnany others have hoped (or fei,rred) was coming to pass; his Consciousness III is tlie renaissance of all the olal, tencler', matrist values repressed for 3000 years in tl're Western World. Like Mcluhan with his electronic mysticistn, like Lear1, with his Acid Zen (\"You are God. Remen,ber?\"), like Brown and Marcuse with their concept of freedom unliniited, Reich is important whether he is right or not. He has defined that sense of vertigo which all of us experienced zrs the 1960s taught us again and again that many things we thought eternal are likely to pass away before our eyes. The very venom found in criticisms of Reich (and of Brown, Marcuse, Leary and McLuhan) inclicates that the critics themselves have a deep repressed fear that these heretics might be right after all. Here, for instance, is a typical ll'omen's lib assault on Reich, from Nancy R. McWilliams in The Con III Cont'rouersa: To me, male chauvinism in the guise of undiluted love for all humanity, liberated sensualitl', and spontaneons self-r'ealiztt- tion is far more insidious than anything Norman Mailer or Lionel Tiger represents.

Think o.f your Desires as ReaLities, a slogan of the French student rebellion of 1968, is the underlying message of all four writers, the cause of the messianic hopes of their admirers and the cause also of the terror quite visible in their critics.

There is no doubt that Freud's classic formulation of the reality principle ossumed. a great deal about things rvhich, having never been challenged, have never had to prove thentselves. Now they are being challenged, and the polemics against the challengers (\"soft-headed\" was the lrsual charge against Reich; \"incoher- ent,\" he shared with McLuhan; \"cultist\" was reserved for Leary; \"bizat're,\" for some I'eason, is mostll' reserved for Brown) suggest that the would-be defenders at'en't quite sure r,r'here to begin.

Probabiy it is still safest to be respectable and ignore such speculations, even if a little devil inside urges us to quote, in this connection, from Patrick Trevor-Roner's The ll'orld Throuoh Blutt,ted Sight: Mescaline and other hallucinogenic dlugs seem to cause all interruption of the \"zrssociation fibres\" in the posterior lobe of the brain, which nioltl the unconscious, cereblal image of the seen wollt'l into the conscious percept, aLtering it, in the liuht ol our erTteriertce q.nd needs, so th:rt it falls into line rvith our established schemas, with all the attributes that rve think proper for the object we nolv recognize.

We will soon find ourselves in company with William Blake, the altist-poet who talked to the Old Testament plophets and saw angels; batty Blake, greatest of our lyric poets but certainly the last man to trust about the question of what is real-he who said, \"The fool sees not the same tree that the rvise man sees.\" (Did his trees look like Van Gogh's, or even wilder?) Certainly, we have found reasons to believe that Freud's oral type sees not the same breasts as the anal type, but what sort of man sees blue lays coming out of nipples? To zrsk is to answer: The same sort who sees halos around heads. No, we shall not go 2rny further down thzrt very murky road. Let us give Blake one last word and then pass him by. \"The Head Sublime,\" he once wrote, \"the heart Pathos, the genitals Beauty, the hands & feet Proportion.\" W'e will nod our heads in wry agreement with the wistful comment of science- fiction writer Carol Emshrviller: \"It would be nice to live in a society where the genitals were reall;r-' considered Beauty.\" Yes, Carol, it u'or-tid.

Those women on the island of Ra'ivavae, mentioned in the lead to this chapter: What do they think, rushing to grab a piece of cloth and cover their tits when \"the European doctor\" arrives? Are they suddenly ashamed of their nakedness, or are they humoring a man they regard as a lunatic? Probably both: We believe what we do, even when we disbelieve it, and this is the schizophrenia implicit in every act of submission to an authority that we fear more than we love. \"We are all better artists than we know,\" Nietzsche said once, but he was not flattering us, he was talking about our capacity for self- deception. Watch people change everything fr.om their posture to their awareness of reality when the boss walks through the office and you will know everything Nietzsche, or Freud or.any other profound student of humanity had to teach. We are all Polynesians and we all cover up nervously when the European doctor passes by. Perhaps the only difference is that some of us trust him more of the time and some of us trust ourselves mor.e of the time. Certainly, the extent of the breast taboo in our anal culture is so extreme as to have influenced language also. We can scarcely talk about breasts in any idiom that is understood throughout the society. (According to H. Allen Smith, in Mr.. Klein's Kampf, workers in brassiere factories have a slang of their own, to describe various sizes, from \"peaches\" up to 135"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The shape of the breast uaries throughout the world, but loaelg shapes are found Jrom South America (Figure 25, far right) to Africa (Figure 26, right) to In- donesia (Figure 27, below).

We have a full, rich and even poetic vocabulary to describe a lovely woman's face-hair like the Kansas cornfields, eyes as blue as Murphy's overalls, a fine upstanding Roman nose, full sensual lips, a determined little chin, and so on and so forth, with a whole silo of clich6s which every lazy writer can count on to create the approxi- mate image he wants in the reader's head. When it comes to breasts we can't say much more than \"fairly big\" or \"fairly small,\" perhaps adding \"kinda high\" or \"sorta sagging.\" Sara Reidman, writing in Serology magzzine in 1956, proposed a roughly scientific classification of four main types of breasts-conic, discoid, hemispheric and elongated-but this is scarcely known even by other sexologists.

But that is above the chin. From the neck down our language suggests that the lights went out with the arrival of St. Paul on the seene and we haven't been able to see each other since then. Actually, in spite of our not having a clear language about such mammary matters, anthropologists do tend to agree that there are several styles of breasts among human females, and that these are related to racial, climactic and cultural factors. The beauty of Balinese breasts is renowned (they are what Ms. Reidman would call conic), while elongated breasts are typical of many African tribes. A few standard racial types are shown in Figures 25, 26 and 27. Anthropologist Max Bartels has suggested 48 types of breasts, depending on whether they are (1) highly developed and exuberant, (2) full, (3) moderate or (4) small or flat; and, within each of these categories, whether they are (a) firm, (b) soft or (c) flabby; and, then, whether they are (I) bowl-shaped, (II) hemispherical, (III) conical or (IV) elongated. Systems have even been proposed to classify the areolae around the nipples into such groups as (1) cup-shaped, (2) hemispherical, (3) almost spherical, (4) disc-shaped. What is wrong with all these scientific categories is that they evade the classifica- tions that are of real interest to lovers, husbands and infants, namely taste, responsivity, warmth, charge and excitability. We do not possess words for such concepts because it is still considered bad taste to even talk about them! Thus, those women of Ra'ivavae are no more confused than the rest of humanity. Try to think logically about the question, should the breasts-or any other part of the body-be covered or uncovered (see Figures 28 and 29). It you are at all typical, the results of your reflection will merely mirror your own ambivalences and perplexities. The case for nudism has been excellently presented by various spokesmen in the last centu- ry, but they have made few converts. Dr. Flugel's standard reference, The Psgchology of Clothes,lists a variety of motives for covering the body-including protection from the ele- ments, magic and ritual uses, social-class identification, etc.- but notes that most of our designs and fashions seem diaboli-"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Figures 28 (right) and, 29 (far right): Most North American Ind,ian women couered their breasts, but these Wichita women, photographed, at Fort Sill in 1869, were enceptions.

The two \"other purposes\" that Flugel es- pecially stresses: modesty or shame-the desire to hide, on one hand-and decoration, or narcissism-the desire to be stared at-directly contradict each other. No wonder women's fash- ions are an object of such incessant and nervous humor; they are a manifestation of unconscious drives which most of us, male and female, would prefer to keep unconscious. Dr. Flugel, like Professor Knight Dunlop in the equally scholarly mono- graph, The Deuelopment and Function of Clothing, comes to the conclusion that if we were really sane we would go bare, like the other animals. In all probability, our covering-up will be the first thing interplanetary vistors will notice about us, and it will give them the entire clue to our social lunacy. Consider Arthur Schnitzler's once-sensational novel, Fraulein Else. The heroine, a proper young German lady, is put in a position where the only way to save her beloved father from bankruptcy is to submit to the desires of the villain. He, in turn, is more a voyeur than an activist and asks only to see 138"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"her body nude. After the contract is signed and her father saved from the poorhouse, Fraulein Else gratifies, and frus- trates, the villain by disrobing before him-and everybody else-in the lobby of a huge hotel. (She then commits suicide.) This plot electrified our grandparents because it almost makes explicit the unconscious function of clothing as creating a mystery which is to be revealed only to one person at a time. Visitors to nudist camps are similarly frustrated when they realize that disrobing before a group has none of the \"magic\" of disrobing before a chosen individual. A similar indication of the irrationality of our clothing mystique is the loud warning that civilization is imperiled whenever fashion changes too abruptly, especially if the change makes more flesh visible. In 1930, for instance, the earthquakes which shook Italy were attributed, by prominent Roman Catholic bishops, to the gowns recently imported from Paris. According to Dr. Flugel, one Romish divine even de- clared that Naples had been spared from the quakes because the Neopolitans \"had resisted the present scandalous female 139"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"fashions.\" The Vatican was notably less sensitive to the moral and meteorological implications of the murders and tortures practiced by Mussolini's government at that time, and nobody suggested that the labor union leaders left in an alley with bullets in their heads would provoke the Almighty to further tremors of the earth's crust. Relatively sane people-who are still quite plentiful, al- though of course always a rninority-seldom challenge the prevailing lunacy, knowing full well that that path leads to the jailhouse or worse. In the country of the blind, after the one-eyed man has been executed, the two-eyed quickly learn to appease the blind and lunatic majority. Do we exaggerate? Cousins, chew hard on this next bit: Donald Marshall's book Ra'iua'u-ae points out that these modest women are part of a culture in which the primordial word for a supenlatural power, tiki, mistranslated as \"God\" with a capital G by Thor Heyerdahl, also appears in the words tikiroct, the penis (literally: the long progenitor) and t'ikipoto, the clitoris (literally: the short progenitor'); where the tutiki, or temple doorway, is described by a native informant as \"the two thighs of the Earth Mother\"; where religious ceremonies traditionally ended, just like the rites of the great mother in prehistoric Europe and Asia, with the priests and priestesses copr-rlating and then rubbing the sperm on their heads for good mana (luck, energy, blessing). Yet, when the European doctor comes by, they cover their breasts-just as the village drunk telling a risque joke to his cronies will lower his voice suddenly rvhen the Reverend Snoot passes on the street. Yes, and just as a11 actress like Lana Turner, despite her well-publicized amours, was compelled for decades to speak dialogue on the screen implying that neither she nor the other actors nor the writer nor anyone in the wor'ld had ever tloubted the' sexual teachings of Frar,cis Cardinal Spellman; just as pslrchologists as radical as Drs. Phillis and Eberhard Klonhausen, zrs recent- ly as 1951, took zrll the \"fucks\" out of a book on pornography and prudently substituted the parenthetical \"(vernacular for intelcourse.)\" A cvnic might sav that we have never outgrown the primitive trait of rvorshiping the tribal nradmen; and it is hald to say where humoling their fantasies leaves off and sharing those fantasies begins. (Evel hear of Emperor Norton? Joshua Norton, an English immigrant, failed as a businessman in San Francisco during 1.10"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"the 1850s. In 1861 he returned with an old army uniform and a top hat, proclaimed himself emperor of the United States and protector of Mexico, and began issuing his own currency. Being then as now a whimsical town, San Francisco humored him; restaurant owners not only accepted his strange-looking money, but competed with each other for his patronage- especially after he became a tourist attraction. Eventually, the newspapers were printing his state proclamations and his absurd open letters to personages such as Abraham Lincoln or Queen Victoria. The climax of his career, in a sense, came one night when the vigilantes decided to burn down Chinatown: The emperor stood before them in the street, lowered his head and silently began praying. The joke had become serious: The vigilantes dispersed and the Chinese were spared. When Nor- ton the First died in 1883, he had become so beloved that 30,000 people turned out for his funeral. He is already elevated to sainthood in the Principict Discordia, quoted earlier, and perhaps in another hundred years saying that he really acted like a nut much of the time will get you a jail sentence . . . .) O my brothers, rays or no rays, auras or no auras, there's something spooky about the breasts that seven and seventy taboos should be laid upon them. And if the attitudes of a Francis Cardinal Spellman seem strange to us, we can get a real jolt and a further awareness of the spook-specter-psycho wavelength by recalling Jack the Ripper''s famous note to Scotland Yard, which came in a box with a breast amputated from his latest victim: \"Hope you like this,\" Jack wrote in his cheerful way, \"I ate the other one. . .\" Old Leather Apron, as the whores called him, always performed what the press of the day evasively called \"unspeakable mutilations\" on the women he killed. It is, of course, only a coincidence that of all famous murderers (outside politics) his is the name best known to everybody. To say, as some Freudians do, that Jack's oral sadism (and peculiar sense of humor) is an expression of the frustrations all men feel in this civilization is sick, vile, un-American-the kind of thing only a Freudian can believe. Let us rush at once to the most anti-Freudian people around, the women's liberationists; in the February 1973 issue of MS. there's an article about the things men must, realize and face up to, and it is by a man named Warren Farrell. Here's the place where you better start facing yourself, according to Mr. Farrell: 111"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"My first views of women. Views as a sex object, learning to be \"superior,\" developing contempt fol women. This is the sort of thing the editors at MS. really dig. They know that all men view women as objects, feel superior to them and regard them with contempt. Any suggestion that this might contain a bit of projection on their part is im- mediately rejected with the non-Aristotelian logic that pro.iec- fiorz is a Freudian discoverv and Freud was a male chauvinist pis. Well, I am not going to argue that there aren't any men who do regard women with contempt. There are quite a few who do, and in my experience it is possible, by gauging the extent of that contempt, to predict fairly accurately how long they were educated in conventional religious doctrines as children. It was not any libertine or libertarian sexual revolutionary of the sort MS. hates who said that women are \"sacks of dung\"; it was the Christian theologian Origen. It wasn't Freud or Kinsey or any \"male scientist\" (by definition inferior to female scientists) who said, \"Every woman should be overwhelmed with shame at the very thought that she is a woman\"; it was St. Clement of Alexandria. It wasn't from Charles or Wilhelm Reich or Consciousness III that we received the noble affirmation, \"Man, but not woman, is made in the image of God. It is plain from this that women should be subject to their husbands, and should be as slaves\"; this is from Gratian, the greatest authority on Catholic canon law in the 13th Century. None of these men were sensualists or functioning heterosex- uals; they were all celibates, as was Saint Thomas Aquinas, who wrote, \"Woman is in subjection because of the laws of nature . . . . Woman is subject to man because of the weakness of her mind as well as of her body.\" Now, I don't know who's a fool and who's wise, but these men emphatically did not see the same breasts that I see. They certainly were not \"sexist,\" '\"'\"'hatever that means; they were quite clearly antisexist. They despised .women precisely be- cause, as Saint Augustine made abundantly clear, women caused them to have .feelings (sexual and otherwise), and they were determined to eliminate feelings and govern themselves entirely by willpower. I'm not sure that they all hoped to be able to wiggle their ears and break wind musically, as Augus- tine thought Adam did, but they wanted to drive the servo- mechanisms (Fuller's \"Phantom Captain\") out of the body and 110"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"become entire monarchs of the flesh. Now, this is impossible; the nervous system has been shapecl by evolution to be partly autonomic (involuntary) and only partly under the voluntary control of the brain. They were facing a biological brick rvall and trying to wilL themselves through to the other side. No wonder they sound a little bit hysterical. The normal male, on the other hand, the one who doesn't share the church fathers' aversion to women and women's bodies, has no contempt for the fernale ex(ept and to the e:r,tent that his earlE educatiort cante under the influence of this ctntiserusl teaching.In fact, the chief characteristic of normal men in our culture is not contempt for women but ambiguity: An attempt to find some compromise between their natural fondness for the other half of humanity and the paranoid attitudes acquired from religious training. There is no evi- dence in biology or anthropology that the fondness is a hy- pocrisy or social pretense; it appears in animals far down the scale of evolution and, in one form or another', in virtually every human culture. It is part of being a tnale mammal. The aversion to women, however, is a late product existing only in certain religions which have split the nervous system schizo- phrenically in two and worship the \"higher'\" (cortically con- trolled) aspect u'hile clreading the old zrutonomic, self- regulating cybernetic functions as \"lolver'.\" Caught in this trap, some men have paranoid hallucinations about women, just as the starving have paranoid hallucintrtions about food, or the infant on schedule feeding probably had paranoid hallucinations about breasts. The cynical folk-saying alnong men, \"You can't live witlt women and you can't live tL,ithout them,\" is a compromise between Christian misogyny and the biological needs of males. It would be much more true to say that you've got to either love them or hate them-to be truly indifferent is just about impossible. For good evolutionary reasons a man is aware of women in a quite different wa5'than he is aware of tea kettles or umbrellas ol' even changes in the weather. This awareness effects him on all levels of his being, whether he is conscious of it or not. For example, an experiment you might enjoy trying some time- Get a tape recorder, a newspaper, a good-looking young lady (who is hidden at first) and a male friend.

Discrimination, then, is not a sexnzrl issue at all.

Fleud's examination o{' the valious neuloses. ps.r'cltoses, hysterias. psychosomatic illnesses, etc., is only a p:rttial answer'. The full story is seemingly uruch uglier'. The drvindling and sprouting forth again of the breast betrveen 1920 and 1945 is something that needs to be seen in a much larger context. For instance: The classical Romans Iiad a curious custorn of measuring the breasts of a bride jrist before the r.vedding ancl then again on the nrorning aftet' the lnarriage was conslulr)rated. Any in- crease in size rr'as taken as evidence that she had been :r vilgin, because \"evelvbod-y knelv\" that the beginning of :r regular sex Iife causecl the bi'easts to srvell. A realiy notable increase was a sign of special vigor and virility on the part of the groom. Was this entirely superstition? We have already pointed out the existence of whtrt Dr. Alex Comfort calls a \"hot line\" between the breasts and genitalia-a feedback loop which causes sexual caresses at either end of the circuit to produce symptoms of excit:rtion at the other han<1. Excite tire clitoris 1.15"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"and the nipples harden; suck the nipples and the vagina becomes moist. (This even helps the vagina return to natural size after childbirth, if the woman breast-feeds the newborn instead of plasticizing it with a bottle.) But the body is even more amazing than this, and responds to ideas, sometimes, as if it were made of silly-putty. Witness the well-recorded cases of hysterical pregnancy, in which a sexually repressed woman imagines she has been raped and then produces quite convinc- ing abdominal swellings and even stops menstruating. Cases of hysterical blindness, deafness, paralysis and endless \"psy- chogenic\" illnesses are also well-documented. How much did the Roman superstition cause the breasts of well-satisfied brides to swell in actuality (thereby continuing the \"supersti- tion\")? How much of the vanished breast of the 1920s was arranged outside the body by special bras and clothing-and how much went on inside through self-repression? We can hardly begin to guess. Some remnant of the Roman superstition seems to linger on in the widespread male idea that large-breasted women must be more promiscuous than average. There is an element of self-debasing wish-fulfillment in this, since behind it is the unspoken notion, \"If she'll sleep with cLnaone, maybe I've got a chance.\" Women's lib writers, who have caught the wish- fulfillment here, seem to have missed the intense self-doubt also involved. On the reverse side, some large-breasted women cash in on the social myth by entering show business and becoming (as the jargon has it) sex objects; but many others become extremely shy and much more self-conscious than women with average-size mammaries. For every Jayne Mans- field sporting about in a tight dress, there is a similarly stacked woman waiting for a bus on a street corner, disguising this attribute with a loose inside sweater covered by a second sweater with buttons half-open creating a look of amorphous mystery. The direct contradiction of the Roman belief-evidently influenced by the Christian bias that sex couldn't possibly make anything better-was expressed by Dr. Theodore Bell in 1821 in a book entitled Kalogynomio (roughly, \"The Book of Female Beauty\"). Large and rounded breasts (the sign of sexual experience, according to the Romans) actually signified virginity, Dr. Bell claimed. On the other hand, women of experience had breasts which sagged or showed \"irregulari- 140"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"ty.\" The wise man, he added, would choose the first type for a wife, presumably to have the delight of causing the first sag to appear. I frankly prefer the Roman superstition, if one must choose between idiocies. A famous verse by Catullus-Norz illam nutrur, oriente luce reuisens hesterno coLLum poteret circumdare fi,lo2s-at least makes it sound like a happy accom- plishment. Dr. Bell's notions are an aspect of the great l9th-Century trend to find \"scientific\" proofs of Christian dogmas- especially, to show that every act considered sinful by the church fathers was, in some way or other, harmful to health. A general impression was created, aided by all the best medical men of the time, that sexual sins in particular left horrible effects on the body and marked the face with a clear expres- sion of \"evil.\" The last product of this hysteria, turning it at last into art, was Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, in which the hero evades this great Victorian nemesis by trans- ferring the disfigurements to his portrait. He leads a high and glorious life of vice, but forever looks young and innocent, while the painting magically turns into a monster suitable for Hollywood's horror movies, where in fact it has already landed twice. (The fact that Wilde was writing about homosexuality in code added to the shock effect of this fable; and, in all three of his trials, counsel attempted constantly, by the baiting techni- ques permissible in cross-examination, to trip him into admit- ting this. He denied everything with a straight face, but went to jail anyway.) Naturally, the Victorian attitude, like the Roman, tends to become a self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent. An old Chinese parable tells of a farmer who found some cash missing and became convinced that a neighbor's son had taken it' Sure enough, every time he looked at the boy thereafter, a flush of shame and a furtive look in the eyes revealed the conscious- ness of guilt. Then, surprisingly, the farmer found the money where he had misplaced it. The next day he saw the boy again and a more fair-faced and open-eyed lad you'd never hope to meet. This tale, of course, is a warning against what Freud later called projection and, Buddha called maA&-seeing your own fantasies wherever you look; but it also illustrates the 2eBv the light of dawn, the thread which yesterday encompassed her breasts no longel meets. 147"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"way people respond to social expectations. The boy was self- conscious because he sensed that he was being stared at in a hostile and suspicious manner. The Romans and Dr. Bell had one thing in common; they passively watched and waited to see what nature would do to the breasts. Many peoples have been more activist, as indicat- ed by the uplift bra-which goes back, in one form or another, over 2000 years. Other folk have taken even stronger action to obtain the right kind of look. For instance, in New Guinea, young girls attempt to force the breasts to grow large and round by such methods as these, quoted in Ploss's Fentirtu Libido Serualis: A number of ants of two special kinds are collected; their heads are pulled off and they are rubbed on the breasts. The sharp liquid stings the skin, causing slight swelling which is increased by dabbing with nettles. The method is naturally not efficacious at first but must be repeated. The Papuans, however, are of the opinion that it makes the breasts gro\\4' mole quickly; and if the girl endures and perserveres good results will not fail to follow. But this cure must not be applied while the gill is facing the sea, for the waves that wash the shore would otherwise . . . wash away her slowly expanding breasts. On the other hand, several African tribes, in which the low-slung or \"droopy\" look is preferred, tie the breasts down with bands of twine to prevent the upright look the Papuans (and most Americans today) treasure. The more one plunges into anthropological studies, on the breasts or on any human passion, the more inclined one is to pronounce that all men and women are mad. Horv about this one, if you happen to believe that we are reasoning animals? In Spain, during the 16th and 17th Centuries, the women covered their breasts with lead plates, creating a deliberate concave in place of the natural convexity. Further: The Amazons (who may have been histori- cal) amputated one breast, while mutilations have been prac- ticed in Africa, Oceana, the Americas and among the Skopsi sect in Russia. The human brain is in many ways like the parrot brain: It will repeat anything it hears. Its celebrated rationality seldom helps much, for it will understand and believe what it is repeating, unlike the parrot, and few at any time are resolute enough to doubt what everybody else is saying in the entire tribe. If big breasts are locally beautiful, women will torture 118"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"themselves to get big breasts; if little breasts are the local fad, again no pain is too great to achieve that goal. (Anybody who thinks this is a quality only of tire female mind should read some of the criticisms of circumcision b1' doctors who oppose the practice and ask why rve continue to inflict this on male infants.) Everywhere, at all times, folks can see the looniness of the next tribe down the road, but nobody can ever see the lunacy of his ol her own tlibe. Qriite similarly, if society expects large-breasted rvomen to be virginal, quite a few of them will follow that program; and if society expects large-breasted women to be promiscuous, a certain number of thenr will adopt that life-script. But ntore: The body, as much as the mind, can be shaped by these social definitions, and a young girl nray develop large breasts and a pronriscuous life-style to.qeth,er in joint response to some strong social force telling her that's the kind of girl she is. At least, increasing nurnbers of psychologists :rle beginning to believe this. While some biologists are still clebating the old nature versus ttut'ture controversy-u'hether we are primarily the result of inborn gene patterns or of subsequent nourish- ment after birth-and others accept the synthetic view that we are a combination of both (which celtainly sounds more leasonable on the face of it), recent evidence indicates that we are actually the product of three variables: nature, nurtur.e and mind. According to a show-biz legend, a young actress trained in the Stanisltrvski method was hired for a bit part it-r a Marx Brothers' movie. \"Noi\\,, in this scene,\" tl-re director explained to her, \"you come on in a bathing suit. Harpo sees you, honks his horn and lunges. You run off screaming. Got it?\" She nodded thoughtfully. \"What's my motivation?\" she asked. This is not as absurd as it seerns. The body responds to a mental set instantly in many subtle \"r'ays that conrmunicate at once to evely obsel'ver, even though this message is nonver- bal. The Stanislavski training, with its emphasis on permeat- ing the whole bodl' with the personality of the character being portrayed, is quite similar in many ways to certain devices of Reichian, Perisian, Lowenite and other rtrodern psychothera- peutic techniques. Reich taught young psychiatrists who studied with him to observe every characteristic movement and posture of the patient and irnitate thent, saying that in this way one r.l'ould begin to feel 'what the patient feels. 119"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Similarly, a Stanislavski actor may end up decreasing the height of his neck by two inches as he gradually \"feels his way into\" the character of a timid person. Rod Steiger, in particu- lar, has a marvelous capacity to seemingly shrink or grow depending on what sort of person he is playing. Similar \"Stanislavski exercises\" performed in dead earnest ancl not as pLay-actittg by desperate infants, children and adolescents trying to become what society around them says they should be almost certainly have some influence on the body type they eventually develop. Such at least is the hy- pothesis of researcheres as divergent as Franz Alexander, Wilhelm Reich, Alexander Lowen, Frederick Perls, William Schutz, Ashley Montague and dozens of others. Thus, with all due acknowledgment to nature and nurture, some men are burly and tough-looking because they've been trying all their lives to be human tanks or battering rams; some timid souls are short and skinny because they're constantly engaged in giving the impression \"Pay no attention, I'm too small and insignificant to bother you\"; and, almost certainly, some sagging breasts indicate profound defeatism about life and sex, while some high, pointed breasts indicate a spirit of adventure and eagerness. The \"catty\" remark, \"She's not as pretty as she looks,\" said by one envious female to another, is not as illogical as it seems. It means that the woman in question, with all the willpower in the world, has not quite compensated for mediocre nature and nurture, but has compensated well enough that it requires really close lookin g to see that she's really fairly ordinary. Nor is this entirely a matter of makeup, clothing and other ar- tificial or external beauty aids. The spark of life-whether we call it the soul or the libido or the bioenergy or the kundalini or whatnot-is either burning bright or flickering dismally; and this feeling-tone is expressed in every muscle, every gland, every tint of color on the skin. Contrary to one of Hollywood's best-loved myths, the pretti- est girls are usually the brightest ones, and the dull ones are usually dull all the way through, mentally and physically. This has been confi.rmed in test after test, even in studies perform- ed by skeptical psychologists who suspected that teachers are unconsciously prejudiced in favor of nice-looking children. No: Even when we use I.Q. scales graded by persons who 150"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"haven't seen the subjects, handsome boys and pretty girls almost always score higher than average. (Jayne Mansfield, almost always cast as the stereotyped \"dumb blonde\" by Hollywood, actually graduated with honors from a reputable university.) In the typical Hollywood college movie, the good-looking hero and heroine are dull-normal in intelligence, while their humorously presented \"best friends\" (or stooges), the homely guy and the ugly girl, are the class geniuses. In real life, it is usually the other way around. As Eric Berne has pointed out over and over, when people find a game-strategy that seems to work, they play it all the time in everything they do; and for some this consists of winning-by-winning and for others it is winning-by-losing. This is generally true of animals, also (except for the collie dog, which was deliberately bred for a long nose by several generations of misguided breeders until, as some wit said, the head got so long that the brains were pushed out through the ears). Otherwise the famous signs of \"bright eyes and bushy tails\" almost always indicate a bright, curious nature and a warm personality in a handsome body. It could hardly be otherwise. The basic processes of neuro- logy are excitation (abbreviated + in the textbooks) and inhibition (abbreviated -). As Wilhelm Reich said, with per- haps some exaggeration, you are either growing (+) or shrink- ing (-), either advancing toward your goals or retreating from them; it is the same energy in all cases, either flowing freely and felt as excitation and health, or blocked (Besetzung, cathexis, \"being stuck\") and felt as inhibition and anxiety. A rival school of depth psychology gives a different, but equally illuminating, view of what it means to stifle part of the organism. According to Carl Gustav Jung's theory of the collective unconscious, certain archetypes or numismatic symbols recur spontaneously in all peoples everywhere. These images pre- ceded the invention of language, Jung claims, and are born with us just like our hair color, our race or the rest of our genetic endowment. As Joseph Campbell points out in The Masks of God, this seemingly extravagant theory has much to support it in ethological research. Chickens, for instance, have an inborn hawk-image in their tiny brains: They will not only flee from a actual hawk but from a cardboard outline of a hawk tDt"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"if it is floated above them in the air. Any skeptical argument that the chickens' unconditioned fear of hawks is caused by the smell of the hawk collapses in the face of this experiment: It is the shape-a shape the newborn chick has never seen- which immediately triggers the fear-response. If we have similar errchetypes (as Jung called them), it is no metaphor to speak of Marilyn Monroe or Raquel Welch as sex goddesses. These actresses, by careful and intuitive study, have incorporated and projected the archtype and serve, for' us, the satne role that Ishtnr served for the Babylonians, Aphrodite for the Greeks, Venus fol the Romans, etc. Then, too, the other aspect of the goddess, the all-giving mother whom I have already categorized as an extension of the infant's fantasies at the breast, is also still alive, even in an officially Christian and patriarchal cr.rlture. For instance, Emma Lazarus projected this image onto the Statue of Liber- ty in a farnous poem. The poem struck the sanre archetypal level in the mass psyche, and the hey lines were then inscribed on the statue itself. (You'll lind thern on the book held in her left hand.) These lines are as direct an expression of the all-providing mother as the witch-queen's speech quoted ear- lier': Give nle your tired, youl poor', your hucldletl masses Yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, tempest-tossed. to rne: I lift nry lamp beside the Golden Door (American culture was too anal to live up to this totally oral fantasy, so lestrictive immigration qr\"rotas were quickly estab- Iished. ) According to Jnng, the archetypes wax and rvane just like living organisms or species. Thus, at one time society will be obsessed vvith the mother goddess, at another time with the yollnger sex goddess, then again with the father god and at another date with the suffering young hero who dies and rises again (Osiris, Tammuz, Baldur', Adonis, Christ, etc.). The rnore tolerant or psSrghslogically acute civilizations htrve deified all of these-usually together with a trickster god (Lohi, Set, the American Indians' Coyote, Satan, the joker aspect of Krishna, etc.)-and allowed each person to choose one in particnlar as personal deity, or to switch fronr one to another at different stages of life.

But, O my brothers, remember what Dr. La Barre the anthropologist said back on page 36 about the origin of the gods in the nuclear human family: There is no way of activat- ing an archetype (in Jung's telms) without starting the pro- cess that activates the others. The mother was pushed into the background by Christianity for ten centuries, but then she surged forward again and in Latin countries you will see her image more often than the Father and the Son together. The Trickster had his own cult in the Midclle Ages and still does in Anton Szandor Lavey's First Church of Satan in San Francis- co. And the sex goddess reappears not only in movies but in novels and paintings. Which oid master, however devoutly Christian, has not left us at least one glorious Venus? So, too, the body parts-cftaA:rcls, the Hindus call them-are each associated with an archetype. The pineal chakra, or \"third eye\" in the forehead, is always associated with the most destructive aspect of the father god in the West or u'ith the image of Shiva the Destroyel in the East (but this is also positive, since the highest mystic trance is destructive in the sense of exploding the rational ego and allowing the other body centers to come alive and \"speak\"). The mother goddess and sex goddess ale centered in the breast and genitals respectively (but each overlaps the other to some extent, so that the mother goddess is chiefly in the breast and the sex goddess chiefly in the genitals, but each is also at times in the other area [see Figure 30]). We still think of love in the language of this ancient symbol- ism (wl-rich underlies kundaiini yoga, sexuai occultism and the Chinese acupuncture healing methods). The seat of love is in the breasts and usually symbolized in art by a \"valentine\" heart-a conventional shape which does not resemble the real heart very much. It actually looks like a sirnplifled form of the old religious emblems of the female genital to be found in any book on the mother religions. We use this very sexy heart on valentine cards, where it is usually shown pierced by a phallic arrow, and it always appears in Roman Catholic art, sur- mounted by a cross-which was, of course, a phallic itnage in Egypt millenia before Christ. (The cross \"seems to be based on 154"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"some part of the human body,\" Budge comments with an owlish solemnity in his AmuLets ancl Talismarzs. Knight and Wright in Se:ru.al SymboLism leave no doubt that the original religious crosses symbolized exactly what thev look like. The Jehovah's Witnesses do not use crosses because Charles Rus- sell, their founder, glanced into a few texts on the matriarchal fertility-religions, found out what the cross reaiiy l,vas, and recoiled in Victorian horror'.) This valentine heart, with or without cross and arrow, is a very pervasive and resonant synbol. Even in a culture as far removed from Western traditions as China, the symbol for' human emotion included the glyph for the heart (along with the liver, curiously). Expressions such as \"I felt as if my heart would break\" or \"I felt as if nTy healt would burst with joy\" are known to be medically inaccurate, but if we take the valentine heart irs a symbol not of the heart itself but of the heart chakra which corresponds to a nerve clustel governing both the actual heart (and blood circulation) and the lungs (and respiration), these expressions seem to contain much truth. The yogis who specialize in kundalini yoga confirmed this with successful results for a few thousand years (as have the Chinese acupuncturists). So, too, has there been groli,ing confirmation frorn those Western psychiatrists and psycirolo- gists who have taken a body-centeled approach to therapy. This includes the Reichian \"orgonomists,\" the Perlsian \"ges- taltists,\" the Lowenian \"bio-energeticists\" and the Rolfian \"Rolfers\" (as they are actually called); in acldition, those rvorking with Alexander's relaxation techniques and Char- lotte Selver's \"sensory awareness\" have reported similar results-as have countless LSD trippers.

Curiously, this mythological explanation may have considerable truth in it, for Russian archeologists have re- cently found remnants of an Amazon society in southern Russia, just where the Athenian legends claim the original Amazons came from.

The occult thrillers of Dennis Wheatley are full of the same sort of nonsense; a certain type of anal-patriarchal male mind can only conceive of sexual ritual in terms of compulsive and hysterical \"going berzerk\" or swinelike \"wallowing in filth.\" (These types never realize that the filth is in their own semantic reflexes.) A man with similar hangups about food might imagine that at the Holy Communion in a Catholic church the maddened worshipers stuff themselves with the bread, roll on the floor and knock each other about trying to get at the wine. Aleister Crowley commented that Spiritualists and other holier-than-thou types were always asking him how they could attend a ritual orgy and he always answered, with literal truth, that he didn't know about such things; but he was the foremost sexual occultist of our century. (The stupidity of the question prompted and necessitated the nature of the answer. It is, after all, like asking a prima ballerina if you could attend her next wrestling match.) Sexual repression (together with the perversions that usual- ly accompany it) was quick to follow the suppression of women in Rome. Ovid was sent into exile, apparentiy because his love lyrics were considered licentious by somebody in the palace (or else, as other authorities have guessed, because the Hindu-like outburst of vegetarianism and pacifism at the end of his Metamorphoses seemed subversive); but meanwhile emperors like Nero and Caligula and Commodus set records for sexual and other perversities that were not to be equaled until De JtThe Sotir<:s of Juuenal, trans. by Hubert Creekmore (New York: New American Library, 1 963). 159"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Sade's equally astonishing but fictitious creations. If the popular clich6 says that these sadists \"had no heart,\" and if the history of Roman imperialism ancl exploitation of the world suggests that the rvhole governing class \"had no heart,\" then we can say that in a Jungian sense the decline of the mother goddess and the repression of the female had produced a deadening in the heart chakra, the seat of the loving and compassionate emotions. A mystical-sounding notion, indeed, and I blush to offet' it, br,rt Ashley Montagu, physical anthro- pologist, has published statistics in his book The Direction ol HtLman Deueloprnent showing that children deprived of mothering are more likely to become criminals than others and are also more likely to develop psychoses. One of the most famous experiments in ethology demonstrated that monkeys deprived of normal nursing at the breast in infancy failed to develop a normal sex drive in adulthoo<i. Ps1'chiatrist Joe K. Adams has reported a study in which rats, deprived of olal sex play, lost all interest in copulation and began cannibalistically devouring each other. Gershon Legman's Simple Simon slogan \"Make Love, Not War\" has an element of real truth in it. When the former is blocked, the drive toward the latter does seem to increase. It seems that when people \"give up\" or \"give away\" part of their bodies, in the sense of psychologists Perls and Schutz, they do this by repressing activity in the nerve cluster that makes up the appropriate chakra, and this is marked, in religious history, by the decline of the deity associated with that chakra. Conversely, reactivating a chakra brings the deity back into prominence. Thus, the rites which are based on concentrating the \"mind\" and/or the bioenergy in the genital chakra-such as Tantric yoga and the Western equivalants associated rvith the troubadouls, Illuminati, \"alchentists,\" etc.-reactivate the sex goddess, while anything which makes the breast or the act of breast-feeding more conspicuous tends to reactivate also the mother goddess. Thus, as Charles Seltman points out in his classic study, Women in Antiquity, very early terra cottafigurines from the Near East show females offering their breasts either fo or in imitation o/ the goddess. \"They either hold or squeeze their breasts,\" Seltman explains, \"ot' else they clasp their hands over the solar plexus beneath their breasts.\":r2 This tradition :i2Charles Seltm:rn. lI'onen in Antiquitu (London: Thames and Hudson, 1956). 160"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"may have lasted long enough to be the inspiration of Eleanor of Aquitaine's flaunting of these emblems of the goddess in the homeland of the father gods Jehovah and Allah. This is not incredible, since many scholars accept Thomas Wright's sug- gestion, in his Worship of the Generatiue Organs, that the mysterious Baphomet worshiped by Eleanor's contempor- aries, the Knights Templar, was actually Pater Met' or Father Mithra, the sun god of the Roman Legions. . . . The Virgin Mary suddenly thereafter infiltrated herself to the very center of Catholic worship and, in Latin American countries, often seems to have displaced Father, Son and Holy Ghost rather thoroughly. Portraits of her nursing her Divine Son (strikingly similar to the similar ikons of Egyptian Isis which seem to have survived from a quai-matriarchal period) were executed by almost all the major artists of the next several centuries. This totally oral archetype almost became the central symbol of Christianity for a while (one can imagine how Augustine would have felt if he had returned), and there was only a slight hiatus of Mariolatry during the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. The Protestants frequently charged, quite accurately, that the whole Mary cult was unscriptural and a reversion to paganism, but this did not stop the slow steady progression of the archetype. Objectively, a humanitarian must consider the tendency good, since it has markedly decreased the old anal paranoia of the churchmen. Legends in which a dreadful sinner is saved from the wrath of God at the very last moment by Mary's compassion are known in every Catholic country and could have come from the cheerful Greeks or the sentimental Romans. Notably, the Protestants sects which have excluded Mary have kept the greatest intensity of the traditional Christian bigotry and intolerance. As William Carlos Williams emphasized in his 1rz the American Grain, this is obvious the moment you cross the Rio Grande, for from that point southward to the bottom tip of South America the population is still largely Indian or.part- Indian, whereas from that point north the Indians have virtually disappeared.

It does seem that in some sense the goddess has returned. There is even a tendency to bring back the giant-breasted goddess image of the Stone Age; this can be seen not only in cartoons and the illustrations on adventure magazine covers but on many actual women. Some of this is nature, some is nurture, some is mind; but some is obviously silicone. In fact, the silicone injection treatment to build larger breasts is already fashionable enough to have started a debate in medi- cal and women's lib circles comparable to that raging around the oral contraceptive. Naturally, doctors who make their living off this treatment are most painfully sincere in an- nouncing its safety; while those not so intimately involved in the dollars-and-cents side of the matter are more inclined to worry about possible dangers. (Lord Macauley said a century ago that if there were a financial interest involved, the law of gravity would be thrown into dispute.) The tendency of the human being to mutate, or to imagine that he or she is mutating, to fit a social ideal, has many strange consequences erotically. We have already seen that the penis and the breasts changed and enlarged as we evolved from apes with seasonal sexuality to humans with year-round sexuality; we have also seen the breast wax and wane in accord with society's fads. Wayland Young points out some- thing that indicates either a mutation of the female torso or a mutation of the eye of the artist: We have seen how in Greece and Rome fucking was not held to be a special thing to which description and depiction were inapplicable. But in the Middle Ages the eye and ear of art were withdrawn from the meeting of man and woman. More; the eye was withdrawn from the bodies themselves of men and women, so that the Gothic nude was not a man or woman but a symbol of something else; of lust, perhaps, or wisdotn, or folly, or plenty. A11 this is ably discussed in Sir Kenneth Clark's book, The Nude, where he puts the thing in geometrical terms.

We are all more or less inclined to agree with Benjamin the Mule in Orwell's Animal Farm: \"Things will go on as they always have, that is to say, badly.\" Almost every commentator on our sexual revolution, steeped in this atmosphere of gloom and doom, ends by predicting a swing of the pendulum back to the repressions of the past. It might be amusing, and even encouraging, to remind ourselves that the pendulum metaphor is only one way of scanning the future-other models are available. Robert A. Heinlein, the science-fiction writer, Alfred Korzybski, the semanticist, and R. Buckminster Fuller, the mathematician- designer, have all argued with great plausibility that the correct model with which to gauge technological trends is the erponentiul curue, the ever-rising skyrocket line that eventu- ally goes off the top of the page and heads for infinity. There are reasons, all three of these writers have suggested, to think that social progress can also become steady and move in an ever-upward direction if certain blockages are removed. The first such roadblock to be cleared away, obviously, is the pessimistic assumption that this is impossible and that we must resign ourselves to a downward dip of the pendulum. So: If rve look into our crystal ball with an optimistic bias for once, we can discern the outlines of a future that might exist and which will be a lot more pleasant than the past. For one thing, after the big if (i/ we don't blow ourselves to hell), modern technology is fairly sure to abolish extreme poverty and make the present living standard of the average middle- class white American the bottom level standard of the world; many will live above that. Revolutions after that point will not be raggedy peasants shouting \"We want bread,\" but well- dressed and well-educated people shouting, \"We want more freedom to make our decisions\"-and they will be shouting it at both socialist commissars and capitalist legislators. Such libertarian insurrections can only lead to more liberty, not (as has too often been the case in past revolutions) to less liberty. The philosophy of hedonism, always subject to attack as \"heartlessly selfish\" in the past, will not have that drawback in such an economy of abundance. Repression of all sorts will appear more and more foolish.

The \"pursuit of happiness,\" stated as a goal itr our Declaration of Independence, rvill be accepted as the nortnal attitude trnd in the age-old debate between Desire and Autirority it is Authori- ty that (at last) will be on the defensive. Heinlein and Fuller, extrapolating florn the grolving toler- ance of nudity on European beaches (r,vhich has now reached parts of California) and the advances in heating technology, have both predicted that nudity rvill be more commonplace than clothing in the near futule (see Figule 34). Presumably, the latter will be ceremonially continued in certain religious or' political rituals, just as, according to tnany anthropologists, clothing was originally invented not for shelter from the elements but to indicate people's various functions in ritual relationships of religion, rnarlitrge, rvar, etc. (The old gitltnick, often given in character-builtiing or self-help books, of seeirtg a threatening person such :rs a boss or tax official standing in his underdrav'ers as he talks to you, is based on the fact that clothing is, indeed, one of the chief reinforcers of oul social roles and games.)

Dalliance, which is the most pleasant word for sex in the present English vocabulary, will become the rule rathel than the rare excep- tion.

Cupping, gentle squeezing, rubbing, etc., with the entire palm and fingers is, or should be, known to everybody. But the fingers alone have many interesting possibilities. Any man who has ever had the delight of enjoying the sensations while his lady traces the circie around the head of his penis with one fi.n.ger, again and again, around and around, knows that this pleasure becomes almost excruciating in only a few moments, and almost as intense as fellatio if one is able to continue it for a long period.

In the workless society foleseen by Fuller and the cyberneticists, what will remain to distract men and women from the ever-expanding consciousness which, accord- ing to trll yogis, eventually culniinates in universal love? This question, of coul'se, has to be left open at present. Meanu'hile, we can at least say that the mysterious link between sex and religion, rvhich every sensitive pelson has noticed in one \\rt'ay or another'. may contain a lot more than is evident in the fanriliar Freudian conclusion that religion is \"onlv\" sublimatecl sex (see Figure 35). As Norwegian psycho- therapist Ola Raknes wl'ites in his WilheLrn Reich and Orgono- nzgr, discussing an ear'lier book in which he had attempted to explain mysticism scientifically: The first thing I ti'ied to shorv u,as that the so-called \"niystical states of consciousness\" c:ln be rationally explained as irrup- tions into consciousness of repressed thoughts and emotions in such a way that they rvere not felt as originating in the person hiniself....

Nevertheless, it is quite definitely a streatr,ing, a very unique elation accompanying the streaming (banishing all possibilitiy of despair or depression for rveeks afterrvard), an untnistak- able sensation of being \"tn01;ed by sotttethirtgl otLtsicle one's cottsciotr.s sel.f'\" (to continue Dr. Rahnes's descliption and, above all, \"the.feeling oJ etperiencing a rteu kirtd o.f li.fe.\"Some such sensations are part of every satisfactory orgasm, of course, but to a much milder degree. Examples of what I am trying to convey: When Shakespeare wrote of orgasm as \"the nromentary trick\" (in Meusure tor Measure) he had not yet experienced this kind of olgasm; when Heningway wrote the much-mocked passage in For Wh.om the BelL ?olls about \"feel- ing the earth move,\" he obviously had (and those who have mocked it, like the critics of Lawrence's sex scenes, obviously haven't). \"The feeling of experiencing a new kind of life\" is the very essence of this experience. \"Awakening,\" \"Enlightenment\" and \"Illumination\" are the terms most commonly used by mystics, and those who have reached the highest peaks were called \"cligenes\" (twice-born) in the ancient Greek cults of Dionysus and \"born again\" in Christianity. A few weeks ago I attended a Fundamentalist service in San Francisco, osten- sibly Christian, in which all the traditional methods of tribal shamanism were conspicuously present-dancing, singing, hand-clapping, rhythmic swaying, all in an ever'-louder and ever-faster movement toward crescendo. This continued for three hours and then \"miraculous\" cures and cases of \"posses- sion by the Spirit\" began to erupt all around the hall, each one triggering tr,vo or three others. And if I wasn't convinced that 182"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"\"the Lord Jesus\" was present, as everl'bod1' rras shouting to everybody else, I don't think such footless phrases as \"auto- suggestion\" or \"crowd psychology\" quite explain it either. The diehard rationalist who says this is all \"onl1' mental\" might as well try to convince me that orgasm itself is \"only' mental.\" One might as well tell the adolescent bo1- and girl who are experiencing coitus for the first time that rvhat is happening is \"all in your head.\" They know that rvhat is happening is not at all comparable to the \"only mental\" act of fantasizing about sex, just as eating a meal is not comparable to reading the menu. This book has been written with laughter and love, and if I sometimes seem critical of those people and institutions who are guided more by gloom and bitterness-the misogynists who so often have turned the gentle religion of Jesus into a spectacularly bloody hate-trip, the misanthropists who have reduced the perfectly legitimate cause of rvomen's liberation to the shrill crackles of witches laying a verl- bad rvhammy on the world-it is only because I think this ecstasy (from the Greek ec-stasis, out of oneself) is our human birthright and should not be taken from us. Abbie Hoffman's siniple-minded mantra, \"You can't do good unless 1-ou feel good,\" does not seem less true to me as I grow older, but more true. At the age of 41 I don't mind sounding cornl at times, and I say quite frankly that what the world needs most is a little more tenderness. It is not likely to get that from people who are perpetually programming themselves (and others) with fear, hostility, resentment and bitterness. Sex is not the \"central sacrament of life\" as a few ultrahip modern poets have said. It is a late arrival in the story of evolution, and even though it perpetuates all the higher species, it is obviously of only peripheral emotional importance to them-except at mating season when they can sometimes act as foolish as you or I and when even the gentle deer will fight among themselves. The process that made us human, however, did move sex into a new importance, spreading it outward from the genitals to many other areas of the body, as we have seen, and paralleling this growth-in-space with a growth-in-time that eventually included the whole solar year. If it is not central to all life, it emphatically is central to humanity, and if evolution is continuing, it will become even more important in ways that we can scarcely begin to imagine.

Hindus have never denied that the kundalini is a sexual force, even though some of them, still reeling from the impact of Victorian English administrators on their society, prefer to speak in public only about the nonsexual and indirect \\^.ays of rousing the \"serpent\" in the chakras of the autonomic nervous system. The Shaivite and Tantric sects of Hindnism, mean- while, have always continued to use the direct sexual methods, however much this may horrifl' Occidental visitors to their land. There is cosmic humor', a jest for the gods, in the fact that these prudish visitors will often, despite their horror, snap a ro11 of photographs of the erotic carvings in the Black Temple and bring them home to show all their friends. Denving that this erotic force is spiritual, speaking of it (in direct contradic- tion of the evolutionary facts) as an \"animalistic\" part of rnankind, yet they are moved by it. There is cosmic tragedy, to make the angels weep, in the fact that they experience this stirring deep within only as-in D. H. Lawrence's fine phrase-\"the dirty little secret.\" As long as the breasts remain part of the \"dirty little secret,\" ours rvill be a fundamentally ilrational society. In- deed, as long as any part or function of humanity remains hidden in obscenity, society will be partly mad. This is sad, of course, but not nearly as exceptional as is usually thought by those u'ho, raised rvith the illusion that this is a rational and scientific civilization, suddenly discover how basically super- stitious and absurd it reallf is. Actually, all hurnan societies of which we have any record are slightly lunatic. If the locals do not worship snakes or bulls, thel'worship invisible demons and gods; if they are not ter:rified of nude breasts, they are worried that Friday is an unlucky clay or that witches have put a curse on their cornfields.

Once again we are told that parts of our bodies must remain dirty little secrefs and that the state will use its powers of coercion to enforce this code upon us. To a rationalist, it is as if the highest court had ruled that we must all believe, or pretend to believe, in the doctrine of the Trinity. Some people can believe in a three-in-one divinity, and some can believe that the human body is foul; others can no more believe these propositions than they can accept the tenets of the snake-handling cult in Georgia u'hich rve mentioned ear- lier. It doesn't matter what rationalists believe; they r-nust not get caught exercising their disbelief. The onlv consolation is that things woulcl be even more absurd if it 'nvere the snake handlers and not the sexophobes u'ho were in power in Wash- ington. There is, in fact, no reason why the notions of the snake handlers could not be enforced on the rest of us if they did get their crowd into high office, for as Mr. Justice Burger says in this recent decision (Paris Adult Theatre): But it is argued there is no scientific data which conciusively den.ronstrates that exposure to obscene materials adver.sely effects men and wolnen or their society. It is urged on behalf of the petitioners that absent such a demonstration any kind of state regulation is \"impermissible.\" It is not for us to resolve empiricai uncertainties underlf ing state legislation save in the exceptional case u'here that legislation plainly impinges upon rights protected in the Consitution itself. . . although there is no conclusive proof of a connection between anti-social behavior and obscene materials, the legislature of Georgia could quite reasonably determine that such a connection does or might exist. In deciding Roth, this Court implicitly accepted that a legislature could legitimately act on such a conclusion to protect \"the social intelest in order and morality\". . From the begin- ning of civilized societies, legislatures and judges have acted on various unproven assuntptions. In short, there is no need to prove that an act is harmful to prohibit it. If the legislators choose to prohibit it, the citizenry must acquiesce-or go to jail. As Wayland Young has pointed out: But it is difficult or even impossible to argue that the accepted limits of obscenity should themselves be redrawn without actu- aliy infringing them in the process, and having to defend one's argument against a charge of obscenity.

There is no \"obscenity\" in an-1r of these things, in fact; lhe \"obscenity\" is in the mind of the person passing judgments. It is, in Freudian terms, a plojection, in which the mind imagines that its own contents are outside itself in the external universe; or, in semantic terms, a \"confusion of the levels of abstraction,\" in which the mind's orvn machiner.v is identified with the nonmental things it is attempting to under'- stand. The man or woman who believes there is something called \"obscenity\" out there in the external world is thus in precisel-v the same state of delusion as those who imagine that gods or derrrons or strange voices out there are comlrunicating with them. As psychologist Theodore Schroeder insisted, the belief in external \"obscenity\" is the modern form of the witchcraft delusion.

Perhaps the iron wall between church and state should have been reinforced steel. Nevertheless, the rosy future we have portrayed is not impossible, only improbable. Bv and large, the clich6 about a \"generation gap\" is true: The exponents of the old-time moral- ity are generally aged people, and Consciousness III is mostly the property of the young. However many years the Nixon Court may survive Nixon, we still have the reassurance once offered by the English underground paper, If: \"Every minute, more and more of them die off; every minute, more and more of us are born.\" A society based on love and freedom is, as it has always been, possible. Someday, maybe not next August but maybe the August after, the influence of the young may become stronger than the influence of the old and we may be able to begin building a society in which the dirt and smut thrown on the breasts and the rest of the human body rvill finally be washed off.
