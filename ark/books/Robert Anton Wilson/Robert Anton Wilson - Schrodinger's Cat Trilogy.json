They had territorial squa bbles and politics and wars and a caste system. They also had sufficient intelligen ce to survive on that barren boondocks planet for several billions of years. We are not concerned here with the majority of Terrans. We are concerned with a tiny minority-the domesticated primates who built cities and wrote sy mphonies and invented thi ngs like tic-tac-toe and integral calculus. At the tim e of our story, these primates regarded themselves as the Terrans. The six- legged majority and other life-forms on that planet hardly entered into their thinking at all, most of the time. The domesticated primates of Terr a referred to the six-legged majority by an insulting name. They called them \"bugs.\" There was one species on Terra that lived in very close symbiosis with the domesticated primates. This was a variety of domesticated canines called dogs. The dogs had learned to ac hieve a rough simulation of guilt and remorse and worry and other domesticated primate characteristics. The domesticated primates had learned how to achieve simulations of loyalty and dignity and cheerfulness and other canine characteristics. The primates claimed that they l oved the dogs as much as the dogs loved them. Still, the primates kept the best food for themselves. The dogs noticed this, you can be sure, but they loved the primates so much that they forgave them. One dog became famous. Actually he and she was a group of dogs, but they became renowned collectivel y as Pavlov's Do g . 3 / 233"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The thing about Pavlov's Dog is th at he or she or they responded mechanically to mechanically administered stimuli. Pavlov's Dog caused some of the domesticated pr imates, especially the scientists, to think that all dog behavior wa s equally mechanical. This made them wonder about other mammals, including themselves. Most primates ignored this philos ophical challenge. They went about their business assuming that they were not mechanical. The fact that plutonium wa s missing originally leaked to the pre ss in the mid-1970s. At first there was a minor wave of panic among those given to worrying about such matters, and there was even some churlish grumbling about a governme nt so incompetent that it couldn' t keep track of its own weapons of megadeath. But then a year passed, and another, and soon five y ears had passed, and then nearly a decade; and the missing plutonium was still missing but nothing really drastic had happened. Terran primates, being a simplemi nded, sleepful race, simply stoppe d worrying about the subject. The triggering mechanism of the most destructive weapon ever devised on that backward planet was in unknown hands, true; but that was really not much more unsettling to contemplate than the fact that many of the known hands which had enjoyed access to plutonium belonged to pe rsons who were not in all respects reasonable men. (See Terran Archives: Reagan, Ronald Wilson, career of.) The primate philosophy of that epoch was summed up by one of their popular heroes, Mr. Satchel Paige, in the aphorism, \"Don't look back-somethi ng might be gaining on you.\" It was a comfortable p hilosophy for sleep-loving people. The use of atomic weapons was wi dely blamed on a primate named Al bert Einstein. Even Einstein himself had agreed with this opinion. He was a pa cifist and had suffered abominable pangs of conscience over what had been done wi th his scientific discoveries. \"I should have been a plumber,\" Eins tein said just before he died. Actually the discovery of atomic energy was the re sult of the work of ev ery scientist, craftsman, engineer, technician, philosopher, a nd gadgeteer who had ever lived on Terra. The use of atomic energy as a weapon was the result of all the polit ical decisions ever made, from the time the vertebrates first started competing for territory. Most Terran primates did not understand the multip lex nature of causality. They tended to think everything had a single cause. This simple philosophic error was so widespread on that planet that the p rimates were all in the habit of giving themselves, and other primates, more credit than was deserved when things went well. This made them all inordinately conceited. They also gave themselves, and one another, more blame than was deserved when things went badly. This gave them all jumbo-sized guilt complexes. It is usually that way on primitive plan ets, before quantum causality is understood. Quantum causality was not understood on Terra until physicists solved the Sc hrödinger's Cat riddle. Schrödinger's Cat never became as famous among the primate masses as Pavlov's Dog, but that was because the cat was harder to understand than the dog. Pavlov's Dog could be understood in simple mech anical metaphors. To unde rstand Schrödinger's Cat you needed to first understand the equations of quantum probability waves. Only a few primates were smart enou g h to read the e q uations, and even the y couldn't understand them. 4 / 233"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"That was because the equations seemed to say that the cat was dead and alive at the same time. Every character in this book looks like Pavlov's Dog fr om a certain angle. If you look at him or her a different way, however, you'll see Schrödinger's Cat. As early as 1976, a group of Chicago paranoids known as the Nihilist Anarchist Horde (NAH) printed up a single-page broadside on how to manufacture an at omic weapon. They sent this, in envelopes with no return address, to all the most hostile and embitt ered individuals and groups in the United States. N AH regarded this mailing as both a joke and a warni ng, and refused to face the fact that it was also an incitement. N AH had already put out bumper stickers saying things like: REGISTER CAPITALISTS, NOT GUNS and: HONK IF YOU'RE ARMED and: EAT THE RICH And they even had a rubber stamp which they used to decorate subway advertisements with the N ihilistic message: ARM THE UNEMPLOYED: RI OT IN THE LOOP ON NEW YEAR'S EVE. But they really outdid themselves with the build -your-own atomic weapon sheet, which was titled \"Hobbysheet #4\" and looked like this: HOBBYSHEET #4 in a series of 30. Collect 'em all! A SIMPLE ATOMIC BOMB FOR THE HOME CRAFTSMAN There is nothing complex about an Atomic (or Fissi on) Bomb. If enough fissi on material (Uranium 235 or Plutonium 237) is brought together to form a critical mass, it will explode. The trick is to put the p ieces together fast enough to get a decent blast be fore the bomb blows itself apart. This can be done quite simply by means of ordinary explosive as shown below. It was later estimated that the Nihilist Anarchist Ho rde, most of whom were living on Welfare, were able to mail out only 200,000 of thes e over the four-year pe riod (1976-80) before they grew bored with the project. N onetheless, many of the equally paranoid and hostile persons who received this mailing had access to Xerox machines and were as desperate as the member s of NAH itself. It was later determined that by 1981 there were over 10,000,000 copies of \"Hobbysheet #4\" in circulation. Eventually one of them reached the POE group, who were ready for an idea like that. The planet as a whole continued to drowse.

The book of that name was begun as a sequel to llluminatus!, but after several editors in a row suff ered psychotic breakdow ns while reading it, publishers defensively ordered that any ms. with that title, from Robert Anton Wilson, should be returned unopened. \"People generally do not want a new form of pros e fiction to replace the hackneyed 'novel,' \" Wilson wrote in a letter to his friend Ma laclypse the Younger. \"There never has been a serious attempt since Odysseus.\" Schrödinger's Cat Fair Copy #2, according to Wilson scholars, incorpor ates later and still more bizarre material, the text of which was allegedly dictated to Wilson by a canine inte lligence-\"vast, cool, and unsympathetic\"- from the syst em of the Dog Star, Sirius. Schrödinger's Cat Fair Copy #3 appeared much later, in 2031, under mysterious circumstances. Some claimed, at the time, that it had been received by a trance medium to whom Wilson had \"b roadcast\" it after his mel odramatic departure from this world in 1993. Skeptics have always insisted th at the alleged medium actually found it in an old tampon box in her attic. A legend about the manuscr ipt being recovered from the Masonic Auditorium in San Francisco, after the earthquake of 2005, and passed around among adepts of certain occult groups, is probably mythical. Various alternative texts, generally considered forg eries, have circulated at intervals and many Wilson scholars debate heatedly whether this final ms. is, in fact, totally or even in major part Wilson's work. That two authors at least are here represented, ofte n at cross-purposes with each other, is the emerging academic consensus at this time. The present edition incorporates all material that is undoubtedly Wilson's, together with matter of such a Wilsonian and weird character that the present editor regards it as probably-Wilson's-within- reasonable-doubt. It only remains to affirm that Schrödinger's Cat, contrary to appearances, is not a mere \"routine\" or \"shaggy shoggoth story.\" Despite his sinister reputa tion and his well-known ecc entricities, Wilson was one of the last of the scientific shamans of the pr imitive, terrestrial phase of the cruel, magnificent Unistat Empire. This may be hard to understand when many Establishment scholars still deny that anything like scientific shamanism existed in th e twentieth century, but it is nevertheless well documented that Wilson, Leary, Lilly, Crowley, Castan eda, and many others pursued rigorous studies in scientific shamanic research even under the persec ution of the \"neurological police\" so characteristic of that barbaric epoch.* Some have even proposed that Schrödinger's Cat is actually a manual of shamanism in the form of a novel, but that opinion is, almost certainly, exaggerated. *See the Editor's \"Clandestine Neurotransmitter Research Under the Holy Inquisition and the D.E.A.,\" Archives of General A rchaeology, Vol. 23, No. 17.

According to his usual pr ocedure, he breathed deeply, relaxed every muscle, and gradually forced all verba lization in his brain to stop. When he had reached the void, he waited to see what would float up to fill the vacuum. What surfaced was: One month to go to 1984. Benny looked at the calendar; what happened next w ould be portrayed by a cartoonist as a light bulb flashing on over his head. He began pounding the type writer, comparing the actual situation of the world with Orwell's fantasy. *Galactic Archives: New York was an independent city-state in the nort hwest of Unistat. It was noted for its malodorous stockyards, its vast motion-picture industry, and a huge ph allic monument dedicated to \"Washington,\" a fertility god who allegedly slept in nearly every part of the Unistat, usually with human women, bringing forth such semidivine progeny as the gigantic Paul Bunyan, the patriotic General Motors, the tr ickster-god Nixon, and the benign Mickey Mouse, who began as a totem of the city of Disneyland and eventu ally became the principal divinity of all Unistat. His column, headed \"One Month to Go,\" was read by nearly 10,000,000 people, the News-Times-Post being the only surviving daily paper available to the 20,000,000 citizens of the six boroughs of New York City. Nine million of the 10,0 00,000 readers were a little bit pa ranoid, this being the natural ecological result of crowding that many primates into such a congested space, and most of them agreed with the most pessimistic portions of Benedict's estimation of Orwell's accuracy as a prophet. \"One month to go to 1984\" became a catchphrase to conclude or answer anybody's complaint about anything. \"One month to go to 1 984\"-soon you heard it everywhere; it reached Chicago by December 10, San Francisco by December 14, was even quot ed in Bad Ass, Texas, on December 16. By December 23 the London Economist printed a very scholarly arti cle on world history from 1949, when Orwell's book was published, to the present, enumerating dozens of parallels between Orwell's fiction and the plan et's nightmare. In Paris a prominent Existentialist, in an interview with Paris Soir, argued that living inside a book, even a book by an English masochist like Orwell, was better than living in reality. \"Art has meaning but reality has none,\" he said cheerfully. The six-legged majority on Terra were never consulted when the domesticated primates set about building weapons that could destr oy all life-forms on that planet. Th is was not unusual. The fish, the birds, the reptiles, the flowers, the trees, and even the other mamm als weren't allowed to vote on this issue. Even the wild primates weren't involved in the decision to produce such weapons. In fact, the majority of domesticated primates them selves never had a say in the matter. A handful of alpha males among the leading predator bands am ong the domesticated primates had made the decision on their own. Everybody else on th e planet-including the si x-legged majority, who had never been involved in primate politics-just had to face the consequences. Most of the domesticated primates of Terra did not know they were primates. They thought they were something apart from and \"superior\" to the rest of the planet. Even Benny Benedict's \"One Month to Go\" column wa s based on that illusion. Benny had actually read Darwin once, in college a long t ime ago, and had heard of scien ces like ethology and ecology, but the facts of evolution had neve r really registered on him. He never thought of himself as a primate. He never realized his friends and a ssociates were primates. Above all, he never understood that the alpha males of Unistat were typical leaders of primate bands. As a result of this inability to see the obvious, Benn y was constantl y alarmed and terrified b y the behavior of himself, hi s friends and associates and 7 / 233"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"especially the alpha males of th e pack. Since he didn't know it wa s ordinary primate behavior, it seemed just awful to him. Since a great deal of primate beha vior was considered just awful, most of the domesticated primates spent most of their time trying to conceal what they were doing. Some of the primates got caught by other primates. All of the primat es lived in dread of getting caught. Those who got caught were called no-good shits. The term no-good shit was a deep e xpression of primate psychology. For instance, one wild primate (a chimpanzee) taught sign language by tw o domesticated primates (scientist s) spontaneously put together the signs for \"shit\" and \"scientist\" to describe a scientist she didn't like. She was calling him shit- scientist. She also put together the signs for \"shit\" and \"chimpanzee\" for another chimpanzee she didn't like. She was calling him shit-chimpanzee. \"You no-good shit,\" domesticate primates often said to each other. This metaphor was deep in primate psychology because primates mark their terri tories with excretions, and sometimes they threw excretions at each other when disputing over territories. One primate wrote a long book describing in vivid de tail how his political enemies should be punished. He imagined them in an enormous hole in the ground, with flames and sm oke and rivers of shit. This p rimate was named Dante Alighieri. Another primate wrote that every primate infant goes through a stage of being chiefly concerned with biosurvival, i.e. food, i.e. Mommie's Titty. He called th is the Oral Stage. He said the infant next went on to a stage of learning mammalian politics, i.e. recognizing the Father (alpha male) and his Authority and territorial demands. He called this, with an in sight that few primates shared, the Anal Stage. This primate was named Freud. He had taken his own nervous sy stem apart and examined his component circuits by periodically alteri ng its structure with neuro-chemicals. Among the anal insults exchanged by domesticated primates when fighting for their space were: \"Up your ass,\" \"Go shit in your hat,\" \"You're full of shit ,\" \"Take it and stick it where the moon doesn't shine,\" and many others. One of the most admired alpha males in the Ki ngdom of the Franks was General Canbronne. General Canbronne won this adulation for the answer he once gave when asked to surrender at Waterloo. \"Merde,\" was the answer General Canbronne gave. When primates went to war or got violent in other ways, they always said they were about to knock the s hit out of the enemy. They also spoke of dumping on each other. The primates who had mined Unista t with nuclear bombs intended to dump on the other primates real hard. Benny Benedict's entire phi losophy of life had been shaped by an obscene novel, a murder, and a Boston Cream Pie. The novel was called Od y sseus and the most shockin g thin g about it, aside from the searin g indecenc y 8 / 233"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"of its language, was that it had been written by a famous theologia n, Rev. Carl Gustav Jung of Zurich, Switzerland. Nobody had known what to make of the book when it was first published, except to fulminate against it. The story, in fo urteen chapters, recounted fourteen hours in a very ordinary day as some staggeringly ordinary charac ters wandered about Zurich on extraordinarily ordinary business. When Jung revealed that the fourteen chapters co rresponded to the fourteen Stations of the Cross, conservative critics added blasphemy to their charge s against him. Later-much later-academic exegetes adopted Odysseus as the very model of a modern novel and wr ote endless studies pr oving that it was an allegory on everything from the evolution of consci ousness to the rise and fall of civilizations. Benny couldn't understand much of what these academic critics wrote, but he knew that Odysseus was, to him, the only book that really succeeded in ma king the daily seem profound. That was enough of an achievement to convince him that Jung was a genius. It also encouraged him to look at everything that happened as being marvelous in one way or another. If Jung's characters, or so me of them, happened to defecate, urinate, masturbate, an d fornicate during the fourteen hours, that was not because the theologian was trying to write pornography, but becaus e the miracle of daily life could not be shown without all of its daily de tails. Benny didn't give a flying Philadel phia fuck about the novel's parallels with the Odyssey and the Stations of the Cross, which Jung admitted, or the other correspondences with body organs, colors, Tarot cards, I Ching hexagrams, and the romantic triangle in Krazy Kat, which his admirers claimed to have f ound. The important thing about Odysseus was that it dem onstrated, almost scientifically, that no day was a dull day. Jung, who regarded hi mself as a better psychologist than the psychologists-this was a conceit typical of theologians-claimed to have found three more circ uits in the nervous system beyond Freud's oral biosurvival circuit and an al emotional-territorial circuit. Jung said that Odysseus demonstrated also a semantic-hominid circuit which created a veil of words between domesticated primates and their experience, thereby differentiating them from the wild primates. He also claimed a specific socio- sexual circuit created by the process of domesticat ion. And he added a fifth, neurosomatic circuit typical of mysticism and music, which ca uses primates to feel High and spaced-out. But Benny didn't care about all that. Odysseus, in his mind, was simply the book that described life the way it really is, without sentiment and emotions. The murder changed all that. It showed Benny that every day is also a terrible day, for somebody. On July 23, 1981, Benny's mother, a white-haired old lady of eighty-four, left the Brooklyn Senior Citizen's Home where she lived to walk one block to the supermarket. On the way she had her purse snatched and, according to witnesses, struggled with the thief. She was stabbed seventeen times with a Boy Scout knife. When Benny arrived at the hospita l emergency room, she wa s already dead, but he got a look-a long look-at her crims on, mutilated body before the doctor on duty hustled him out into the hall and shot him full of tranquilizers. Benny was crippled psychologically in a way that he could not perfectly understand. After all, having reached the fifth decade of his life, he was well acquainted with grie f: in the past ten years he had experienced the deaths of his father, his older brothe r, and three close friends. But murder is not just another form of grief: it is a metaphysical messa ge like Fate knocking on the door at the beginning of Beethoven's Fifth. Benny found that the whole world had turned to very fragile glass. Every police siren, every newscast, every angry voice on the street reminded him that he belonged to a dangerously violent species. Benny Benedict re alized that each minute, some where in the world, somebody was being bashed, beaten, stabbed, shot, sl ashed, gassed, poisoned, robbed of life. He could not bear to be alone at night anymore. The Grinning Sadist be gan to haunt him. This horrif y in g ima g e had been im p rinted u p on his neurons b y various movies and TV melodramas of 9 / 233"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the sixties and seventies. The Gr inning Sadist invaded your home, sometimes alone and sometimes with a horde of equally moronic an d vicious cohorts. You were part icularly susceptible if you were blind or a woman or all alone at night, but sometimes-as in The Dangerous Hours- he would come with his brutal crew in the bright daytime. His busine ss was never simply burglary, although that was part of it; his real interest was in humiliation, terror, degr adation, torture of the body a nd spirit. And he always g rinned. Benny's doctor prescribed Valium, 5 mg. before be dtime. It helped Benny sleep; but when he was awake, every noise still sounded like the Gri nning Sadist furtively trying the door. Benny bought a police lock. Every noise now sounded like the Grinning Sadist trying to force a window. Then, one day looking through the old files in the newspaper morgue, Benny found an interview with Senator Charles Percy given in 1970, two years after the murder of his daughter. \"For the first year after the murder,\" Senator Percy said, \"my whole family lived in terror.\" Benny felt a sudden sense of relief. This must be normal, he thought; it happens to everybody who's had a murder close to them. A nd it lasts only a year. . . . But as July 23, 1982, approached, Benny was not emer ging from the terror; it was growing worse. Well, he had been reading up on grief and bereavemen t, and he knew the first anniversary is always a terrible time. He found the knowledge helpful; it gave him a small purcha se on detachment. Also, without his doctor's consul tation, he had raised his Valium dosage at bedtime from 5 mg. to 15 mg. and sometimes 25. Then on July 23 itself-the anniversary of the murder- the Grinni ng Sadist appeared. Benny had been invited to give a talk at the Pres s Club on \"Lousewart and Lo wered Expectations.\" The luncheon was excellent, but Benny at e little, knowing that a belch in the middle of the speech could destroy all communication for several minutes after. When Fred \"Figs\" Newton began to introduce him (. . . \"New York's most beloved daily columnist ... an institution for over thirty years . . .\"), Benny felt the usual twinges of stage fright, began rehearsing again his first three joke s, gave up on that and concentrated instead on his mantra (Om mani padme hum Om mani padme hum . . .) and was finally in the ideal state of mixed apprehension and urgenc y out of which the most relaxed-sounding public speeches always come. As the applause died down, he rose to speak. And he saw the Grinning Sadist coming right at him. He saw the deranged eyes, the cruel mouth, the delibera tely ugly clothing (like a very poor cowboy or a 1960s college student), and the knife in the maniac's hand. Om mani padme hum . . . And then he got the Boston Cream Pie right in the face. It hadn't been a knife at all: he had imagined a knife when the pie plate was turned and raised as it was thrown. Benny stood there, very conscious that he was ove rweight and past fifty, Boston Cream Pie dripping from his face, trying to remind himself that heart palpitations were not a symptom of heart attack, aware suddenly that the daily life of humankind wa s not only marvelous, as Jung had taught him, and terrible, as the murder had tau g ht him, but totall y absurd as well, as the Existentialists mi g ht have 10 / 233"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"taught him.* *Galactic Archives: Pie throwing was common in Unistat at the time of this Romance.

Pie throwers were expressing mammalian territorial rage in a traditional primate manner by throwing guck in th e faces of those who threaten ed their ideological \"space.\" AUFGEHOBEN 2 NEW PLANETS DISCOVERED -news headline, 1983 The only one in New York who didn't react emoti onally to Benny Benedict's \"One Month to Go\" column was Justin Case, an embittered, fortyish ma n who wrote beautifully meaningless film criticism. Case had not liked the film of 1984 and never read books, which he regarded as too old-fashioned to be worthy of serious attention. \"Books were invented by Gutenberg in the fifteenth century and are, like all other inventions five centuries old, hopelessly archaic,\" Case often said. He also liked to categorize books as \"linear,\" \"Ari stotelian,\" and, when he was especially rhetorical, \"paleolithic\"; he justified this last ad jective on the grounds that books consisted of words, an Old Stone Age invention. Case had a Ph.D. from Yale and a D.D. (Dishonorable Discharge) from the U.S. Army. He had earned the former for a thesis on \"Metaphor and Myth in the Films of the Three Stooges\" and the latter for trying to organize a mutiny during th e Vietnam War. His film criticism appeared in a journal called Confrontation. His essays usually began with the sa me three words as his Ph.D. thesis- e.g., \"Metaphor and Myth in Hitchcock's 39 Steps,\" \"Metaphor and Myth in Beach Blanket Bingo\"- that sort of thing. There was not much of an audience for such writing and Justin barely made a living. His dream was to become an editor at Pussycat magazine, where the big money was. The FBI had been tapping his phone ever since Viet nam and had reels and reels of his conversation, which concerned almost nothing but films. Nevertheless, they ke pt listening, hoping something incriminating would slip eventually. A man with both a Ph.D. and a D.D. was obviously worth attention, even if most of what he said was totally incomprehensible to them. Special Agent Tobias Knight, playing Case's tapes one evening, actually heard a long rap about Curly being the id or first circuit, La rry the ego or second circuit, and Moe the superego or Jung's fourth circuit. Things got even more confusing when Case went on to talk about the \"cinematic continuity in the S-M dimension between Moe and Polanski.\" It got even weirder when Case said, \"Polanski himself went to Chinatown three times-wh en his parents were murdered by the Nazis, when his wife was murdered by the Manson Family, and when he got c onvicted of statutory rape . We all go to Chinatown, one way or another, sooner or later.\" Still, the Bur eau did not give up. Case was sure to say something incriminating, or at least intelligib le to them, sooner or later. Tobias Knight had listened to 42,000 hours of \"pri vate\" conversations since joining the FBI. Among other things, this had clearly shown him that all th e standard primate sexual behaviors were prevalent throughout Unistat. Since Knight, like Benny Benedi ct and most other two-legged Terrans, did not know he belon g ed to a mammal s p ecies, this p rimate behavior was p rofoundl y shockin g to him. He felt 11 / 233"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"much like a Methodist who runs a drugstore in Little Rock-anguished that the Sins of his fellows were exceeded only by their Hypocrisy. This made him Cynical. The same Cynicism was widespread in the Bureau. Older hands who had listened to 80,000 or even 100,000 hours of \"private\" conversations were beyond Cynicism. They had become paranoid about their fellow primates. Tobias Knight himself would be cl assified as a no-good shit by most of the primates if they knew what he was up to. He was the first pentuple agent in th e history of espionage-that is, he had connections with four other Intelligence Agencies beside s the FBI and was double-crossing all of them. He also had a walrus mustache and a jovial eye. He could have been an excellent character actor in movies or TV. Everybody liked him and trusted him on sight. That was why he was so successful in the cloak-and-dagger business. Justin Case suspected that the FBI wa s tapping his phone. However, 9,000,000 out of 20,000,000 p rimates in New York also suspected the FBI of ta pping their phones. Case just happened to be one of the 8,000,000 who were correct in this suspicion. Case was certainly not a mutineer by temperament; his visual cortex-the most energized part of him- was neurogenetically imprinted with a dry, detache d, analytical, almost passive, temperament. His world was made up of forms in space, edited into amusing montages by the passi ng of time; if he ever read books, he might have found that Einstein's Re lativity was the mathemat ical analog of his own mind. Even paintings barely won his tole rance; only film and TV, basicall y montage, turned him on. He was inclined to feel that anything wh ich did not flicker, sh immer, and change rapidly was probably dead and should be decently and quickly buried. In short, he was an electronic Taoist. The Vietnam War had been punishing in various ways to all Unistaters, but Case, embroiled in the center of it, experienced it as very bad TV. It was like the film had stuck a nd Moe kept jabbing his finger in Curly's eye, over and over, in an infinite regress, until the myth and metaphor had both turned meaningless through redundance. If the war wasn't that, it was sloppy ed iting or just plain bad taste. The mutiny was the only equi valent he could find to the simple act of turning the dial to another channel. He had tried to explain this to the lieutenant appoi nted to defend him at the court-martial, a sly, cat- faced young man named Lionel Eacher. Lieutenant Each er, before entering the service, had been an expert at Contract Law, the rules by which the pr imates determined and marked their territories. Remember: other mammals do this by leaving excreti ons which geometrically define the size and shape of the claimed turf, but domesticate d primates do it by excr eting ink on paper. Eacher was a lawyer, an expert at proving either that the i nk excretions meant what they said (if he were being paid to prove that) or that the ink excretions didn't exactly mean what they said (if he we re being paid to prove that). Lionel Eacher listened to Case's story with growing incredulity. At the end of the narrative he frowned very thoughtfully and said, \"Would you just run that by me again?\" So Case had explained, this time in more detail, the aesthetics of proper ut ilization of sadomasochist material in the total stru cture of Significant Form. \"I see,\" Eacher said thoughtfully. \"I think we've got a winner.\" He relaxe d and lit a cigarette. \"The usual defense is that y ou were readin g the Bible and saw a white li g ht and Jesus told y ou to g ive u p war. But 12 / 233"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"this, well, this is beautiful. You sound like a real fruitcake. I might even get you a medical discharge.\" Case realized that he was talking to a barbarian, but that was normal in the military. He had an intuitive sense that twenty years in the joint, which was what the Judge Adjutant General's office was asking, would be even more redundant, in the S-M dimensi on, than the war itself. Very well: If a man of esthetic sensibility seemed like a fruitcake to these primitives, so be it. He wanted to go home. Case explained his position to the c ourt-martial with great el oquence (part of what he said he even used later in a critique of The Rocky Horror Show) and they did, indeed, decide he was a fruitcake. They gave him a D.D., but two members of the board, he learned later, had argued vigorously for a medical. The Vietnam War, like mo st primate squabbles, was about te rritory. Chinese primates, Unistat p rimates, the primates of the Bear Totem from the st eppes and various local Southeast Asian primates were trying to expand their collective-totem egos (ter ritories) by taking over the turf in Southeast Asia. If they had been wild primates, they would have all excreted in the disputed area and maybe thrown excretions at each other; being domesticated primat es, they made ink excretions on paper and threw metal and chemicals at each other. It was one of a series of rumbles over Southeast Asia which had at one time or another involved Dutch primates, French prim ates, primates of the Rising Sun totem, and various other predator bands. Since the Unistat primates, like other domesticated hom inids, did not know they were primates, all this was explained by a ferocious amount of ink excretions invoking Morality and Ideology, the twin gods of domesticated primatedom . Basically, the primates who wanted to claim Southeast Asia said it was \"good\" to go in shooting and grab whatever was grabable; the primat es who didn't give a fuck about Southeast Asia said it was \"evil.\" Justin Case was not verbally orie nted; he thought in pictures, as a good film critic should. He never asked whether the war was \"good\" or \"evil.\" It was unaesthetic. The people who had mined Unista t with nuclear bombs had not regarded the Vietnam War as unaesthetic. They thought it was downright evil. They thought just about everything the Unistat alpha males-in corporations and governments-did was evil. They thought most of thei r fellow primates were no-good shits. Justin Case had been born blissf ully by a joyous mother schooled in the Grantly Dick-Read method of natural childbirth. By the time Justin was thirty-six years old, in 1 983, the Dick-Read method was as obsolete as the horse and buggy. Things were moving fa st on Terra in that age. N onetheless, the Dic k -Read natural childbirth yoga was good for its time, and Case had a permanent security imprint on the oral biosur vival circuitry of his brain. That was one reason he never worried about ethical issues. When Justin began to crawl about the house and then rose up to walk up and down in it, his father, a former alpha male with a large corporation now on the skids due to booze, found him a pest and a nuisance. Father disappeared rapidl y, pursued by lawsuits and child maintenance liens, which harassed him so much that he drank even more, earned less , and was first chronically and then permanently incapable of paying a blessed penny to Justin and Justin's Mommy. Justin was not genetically programme d to be an alpha male, but under the circumstances he learned to do a g ood imitation of one. 13 / 233"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"\"Mommy's Great Big Man,\" Mommy called him. The anal-territorial (old primate) section of Justin's brain took an imprint of Pretend-Authority. Then Justin discovered the semantic environment. He learned to read and watch TV. The books seemed clumsy and sententious compared to the immediacy of the tube. He took a visual-electronic imprint on the semantic circuit, like most of his generation. Case's sociosexual circuit was imprinted by Playboy, Sexual Revolution, weed, Rock, yippies, protest, the Generation Gap, Women's Lib, and General Conf usion. He was a bachelor who had heterosexual couplings as often as he felt the need, with the minimum possible human involvement. If you're interested in superficialiti es, he looked like a gay intellectual or a college professor or a little bit of both. He already had a bald spot. He dressed in conservative good taste. And every four years he went to a polling booth and carefu lly printed with a heavy felt-tip pen, \"NONE OF THE ABOVE.\" This was his one flicker of Social Consciousness. Case had one Weird Experience in his whole life. It happened in 1973 when he went to see the famous mentalist, psychic, escape artist, and comedian Cagliostro the Great, at a nightclub called Von N eumann's Catastrophe. Cagliostro began his act with a fe w traditional tricks- being locked in one box and then reappearing out of another at the opposite side of the room, that kind of routine. This was followed by one of his bitingly sarcastic monologues about the tricksters in other professions, such as the clergy and the government. This was all as Case had expected from the Most Controversial Magician in Show Biz history. Then came the psychic stunts, which were sometimes frighteningly impressive. \"B.W.,\" Cagliostro called out. \"W ill you please stand up?\" Case saw the unbearable bore, Blake Williams, standing at a ringside table. \"B.W.,\" Cagliostro repeat ed, \"you will never finish your twelve-volume study of quantum psychology. N ot ever, in this universe. The twitches in your leg from the polio can be cured by Valerian Root tea. The incident at the Vandivoort Str eet incinerator is still haunting you. Your investments are all wrong- there's no future in space industry. A nd as for Project Pan, Doctor-Project Pan- naughty, naughty, naughty!\" Case could see that Williams had turned pale. \"J.C.,\" Cagliostro called out suddenl y, \"don't stand. This is private.\" Ju stin Case squirmed, half-afraid, half-skeptical, totally vulne rable. \"J.C.,\" Cagliostro repeated, \" you have created this movie that you call reality.

Others clai med it was the work of an FBI agent p rovocateur. A few wondered if POE actually ex isted, and what it would do. Everybody, of course, assumed that the initials POE st ood for the slogan in the last line of the letter- \"Peace On Earth.\" They were wrong. POE stood for \" purity of essence.\" The group had deliberately taken as their model General Jack D. Ripper in the film Dr. Strangelove, who launches a nuclear war to p rotect \"the purity of essence of our precious bodily fluids\" against fluorides. POE honestly felt that sanity had failed to save the world and that onl y insanity remained as a viable alternative. N or were they alone in this attitude. The same year POE was formed, the American people elected Richard Milhous Nixon to the White House, guided by a similar gut-level feeling that somebody like Jack D. Ripper was needed to confront the growing chaos of the planet with some strong counterchaos.* The real name of the founder of POE was not \"John Brown\" of course. That was a pseudonym. The original John Brown had been a fervent Idealist, which was why POE admired him. They were all fervent Idealists too. John Brown, motivated by Idealism, had set out to abo lish slavery in Unistat in the nineteenth century. On one of his first raids he murdered a whole fa mily of slave owners. An associate, who was less Idealistic, had suggested sparing th e children, but John Brown refused. \"Nits grow up to be lice,\" he said. Idealists were like that. You were much safer falling into the hands of the Cynics. The Cynics regarded everybody as equally corrupt.

Since a pers on can die only once, historians have been at a loss to explain what the Unistaters expected to do with the surplus 1,699 bombs fo r each human being. Galacti cal primatologists inform us that similar irrational behavior has been observed among domesticated apes on several thousand planets. The six-legged majority on Terra ha d never developed Idealism or C ynicism, nor had they ever thought of sin or corruption. They had a simple, pragmatic outlook. People could be rec ognized because they all had six legs. Good people smelled ri ght and were part of the same hive or colony. Bad people smelled wrong and were not part of th e hive; they should be eaten at once, or driven off. Two-legged and four-legged critters weren' t people at all and to hell with them. The four-legged residents of Terra were, for the most part, equa lly simpleminded. People had four legs. Six-legged critters were food, or else they were not worth not icing. Two-legged critters were dangerous, and should be avoided. Only the dogs, among all the four-legged Terrans, recognized the two-legged primates as being people. Some of the primates also recognized the dogs as being people. One-tenth of one percent of the dom esticated primates recognized all th e life-forms on their planet as p eople. The one-tenth of one percent of the primates who recogni zed non-primates as people were in violent disagreement with each other about everything else. About one -third of them were Mystics and suffered from Permanent Brain Da mage brought on by fasting, yoga, or other masochistic practices. They had attained understanding of the Intelligence of all living beings th rough an ecstatic-agonizing experience of ego loss brought on by th eir masochistic excesses. They went around talking about this genetic Intelligence and calling it \"God\" and telling everybody it was too smart to make mistakes and incidentally talking a lot of nonsens e, also brought on by their excesses. Another third of the primates who recognized consci ousness wherever it existe d were specially trained scientists, in fields like ethology, ecology, biophysics, and Ne urologic. They all talked in specialized j argons and hardly anybody could understand them . Most of them couldn't even understand one another. The last third of the primates w ho had a sense of the genetic program behind evolution were folk who had eaten some strange chemicals or vegetables. Th ey were like the blind Denebian shell cats who suddenly encounter water for the first ti me by falling into an ocean. They knew something was happening to them, but they we ren't sure what it was. POE theoretically had no leader. It was an anarcho-Marxist collective. The real leader was, of course, an alpha male. His name was Franklin Delano R oosevelt Stuart, and he was one of the smartest men in Unistat at that ti me. Unfortunately, his reptile biosurvival circuit was imprinted with chronic anxiety, his mammalian emotional-territor ial circuit was imprinted with defensive aggression, his hominid semantic circuit was imprinted with an explosive blend of Black street cynicism and New Left ideology, and his domes ticated sociosexual circui t was from Kinksville. F.D.R. Stuart claimed that the purpose of POE was to accelerate the dialecti cal process of evolution toward the classless society where all would live in peace, prosperity, and soci alist solidarity, and there would be no co p s. 16 / 233"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The real purpose of Stua rt's activities was to get even. The other primates in Unistat had raped his mother and jailed his father and driv en his brothers and sisters into street crime and junk and generally maltreated him all his life.

She was even smarter than F. D.R. Stuart, but she deferred to him, despite her feminist orientation, because he wa s a true alpha male who was a Mean Motherfucker When Crossed and had even more rage in him than she did. To Sylvia, the purpose of POE, she said, was to cr eate a world where all men and women, all races and all classes, all humanity, lived in loving ha rmony and ate uncooked fruits and vegetables. Her real motive was also to get even. The other primates discriminated against her for being female, for being Jewish, for being highly verbal and a Teacher's Pet, for wearing gl asses, for being an atheist, and for several dozen other reasons at least. They also called her by an insulting name, which was dyke. The third founding member was Mount batten Babbit, who was a cycli cal schizophrenic. He wigged out once a year, on the average, and had learned how to medicate himself with phenothyazines to keep those periods of Bizarresville down to a few weeks each, but during those dilations of ego he was likely to be anybody from Napoleon to a Vietnamese Buddhist. Th e rest of the year he was a brilliant research chemist and computer expert, but it was hard for him to get a good job because of his several incarcerations in mental hospitals. Babbit said he was in POE to crea te a rational world guide d by sound scientific and libertarian-socialist p rinciples. Yeah, he wanted to get even too. The other primates called him a nut or a fruitcake. The other members of POE were equally brilliant and equally desperate. THE HIDDEN VARIABLE Markoff Chancy was a prime candidate for POE but, due to quantum wave probabi lities, his orbit never intersected theirs. Chancy detested the majority of primates because they called him Shorty or even more insulting names. Mr. Chancy, you see, was a midget, but he was no relative of the famous Chaneys of Hollywood. People did keep making jokes about that. It was bad enough to be, by the standards of the gigantic and stupid majority, a freak; how much worse to be so named as to remind those big oversized clods of cinema's two most famous portray ers of monstro-freaks. By the time the midget was fifteen, he had built up a detestation for ordinary mankind that dwarfed (he hated that word) the relative misanthropies of Paul of Tarsus, Clement of Alexandria, Swift of Dublin, or anybody in POE. Revenge, for sure, he would have. He would have revenge. It was in college (U.C.-Berkeley, 1962) that Mar koff Chaney discovered another hidden joke in his name. It was in a math class and, since this was Berkeley, the two students directly behind the midget were ignoring the professor and discu ssing their own intellectual intere sts- which were, of course, five y ears ahead of intellectual fads elsewhere. 17 / 233"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"\"So we keep the same inst incts as our primate and pre-primate ancestors,\" on e student was saying.

In fact, his cuts were numerous, both in math and in other classes. There were times when he could not bear to be with the gian ts, but hid in his room. Pussycat centerfold open, masturbating and dreaming of millions and millions of nubile young women all bui lt like Pussyettes, all throwing themselves p assionately upon him. Today, however, Pussycat would avail him not; he ne eded something raunchier. Ignoring his next class, he hurri ed across Bancroft Way and slamme d into his room, chain-bolting the door behind him. Damn \"Prime\" Time and damn the science of mathemat ics itself, the line, the square, the average, the measurable world that pronounced hi m subnormal. Once and for all, be yond fantasy, in the depth of his soul, he declared war on the statutory ape, on law and order, on predictabilit y. He would be the random factor in every equation; from this day forward, unto death, it would be civil war: the midget versus the digits. He took out his pornographic Tarot deck, which he used when he wanted a really far-out fantasy for his orgasm, and shuffled it thoroughly. Let's have a Markoff Chain orgasm , just to start with, he thought savagely. His first overt act-his Fo rt Sumter, as it were- b egan in San Francisco the following Saturday. He was in N orton's Emporium, a glorified five-and -dime store, when he saw the sign: NO SALESPERSON MAY LEAVE THE FLOOR WITHOUT THE AUTHORIZATION OF A SUPERIOR. THE MGT. What, he thought, are the poor gi rls supposed to pee in their panties if they can't find the superior? Years of school came back to him (\" Please, sir, may I leave the room , sir?\"). Hah! Not for nothing had he spent a semester in Professor \"S heets\" Kelly's intensiv e course on textual analysis of modern poetry. The following Wednesday, the midget was back at Norton's and hiding in a coffee urn when the staff left and locked up. A few moments later the sign was down and an improved version hung in its place: NO SALESPERSON MAY LEAVE THE FLOOR OR LOOK OUT THE DOOR WITHOUT THE AUTHORIZATION OF A SUPERIOR. THE MGT. Markoff Chaney launched what he considered a re ign of terror against the oversized idiots of the statistical majority. An electronic s whiz since his first junior Edis on set, he found it easy to reverse relays in street intersections, so that the WALK sign flashed on red and the DON'T WALK signs on green. This proved to be bereft of amusement, excep t in small towns; denizens of New York, Chicago, and similar elephantine burgs, accu stomed to nothing working properl y, ignored the signs anyway. The midget branched out and soon incomprehensible memos signed \"THE MGT.\" were raining upon employees everywhere. His father, crusty old Indole Chaney, had been a stockholder in Blue Sky Inc., a very dubious corporation manufac turing devices for use in low gravity; when John F.

On January 18, 1984, the midget was in Chicago, hiding in a coffee urn in the tenth-floor editorial offices of Pussycat magazine. He had a Vacation Schedule Form with him, to be run off on Xerox and distributed to each editor's desk. This form was his masterpiece; it was sure to provoke a nervous breakdown in anyone who tried to decipher and comply with all its directions, yet it was not much different, on the surface, from the hundreds of similar forms handed out in offices dail y. Chaney was quite happy and quite impatient for the staff to leave so he could set about his cheerful task for the night. Two editors passed the coffee urn, talking. \"Who's the Pussycat interview for next month?\" one asked. \"Dr. Dashwood. You know, fr om Orgasm Research.\" \"Oh.\" The midget had heard of Orgasm Res earch and it was, of course, on hi s shit list. More statistics and averages, more of the modern search for the norm that he could never be. And now the bastard who headed it, Dr. Dashwood, would be interviewed by Pussycat- and probably would get to fuck all the gorgeous Pussyettes at the local Pussycat Club. Ch aney fumed. Orgasm Research moved from the middle of his shit list to the top, re placing his archenemy, Bell Telephone. The thought of Dr. Dashwood remain ed with him all night, as he ground out his surrealist vacation memo on the office Xerox. He was still fuming when he returned to his pantry-sized room at the YMCA and slipped the bolt (to ke ep out the wandering and prehensi le deviates who infest YMCAs everywhere). Dr. Francis Dashwood, supervisor of orgasms, and now ready to dive headfirst into a barrel of Pussyette s: the midget suffered at the thought. But it was nearly 4 A.M. and he was tired. Tomo rrow morning would be time to do something about Orgasm Research. Chaney dreamed of Dashwood measuring orgasms wi th an n-dimensional ru ler in Frankenstein's laboratory while men in trench coats went slinking about in the shadows aski ng unintelligible questions about 132 missing gorillas. In the morning he shuffled through his bogus letter head file, looking for so mething appropriate for correspondence with Orgasm Research. THUGGEE SOCIETY, DIVISION OF HASH IMPORT AND AFROGENEALOGY, said the handsomest letterhead; this was illustrated with a th ree-headed Kali. But that one he reserved for correspondence with prominent white racists, inform ing them that the Afrogenealogy Division (Alex Haley, researcher-in-chief) had discovered that their great-great-grandmother was black.

That should make the bastard wonder a bit, he thought with satisfaction, stuffing the enigmatic epistle in an envelope and addressing it. Markoff Chaney loathed math becaus e it contained the concept of the average. Chaney not only loathed, but hated, despised, abomin ated, detested, and couldn't stand the thought of Dr. Dashwood, not just because Dashwood's work invol ved statistics and averag es, but because is was concerned with orgasms. That was a tender subject to Chaney. He was a virgin. He was never attracted to women of his own statur e- that was almost incestuous, and, besides, they simply did not turn him on. He adored the giantesses of the hateful oversized ma jority. He adored them, lusted after them, and was also terrified of them. He knew from sad experience, oft-repeated, that they regarded him as cute and even cuddly, and one of them had gone so far as to say adorable but absolutely ridiculous as a sex partner, damn and blast them all to hell. He had tried building his courage with booze. They thought he was disgusting and chauvinistic and not even cute anymore. He tried weed. They thought he was cute again, and even hilarious, but even more absurd as a possible lover. He tried est. The trainers spent the first day te aring him down-telling him he was a no-good shit and everybody knew he was a no-good shit and things like th at, which he had always suspected. The second day they built him up and convinced him he could c ontrol his space as well as any other mammal. He was flying when he came out. He went at once to a singles bar and sidled up to the most attractive blonde in the place. \"Hi,\" he said boldly, swaggering a bit. \"Wha t would you say to a friendly little fuck?\" She gazed down at him from what suddenly seemed an enormous height. \"Hell o, friendly little fuck,\" she drawled with ma gnificent boredom.

Es muss sein. - ludwig van beethoven p ep-the People's Ecology Party-had been founded by Fu rbish Lousewart V following the success of his monumental best-seller, Unsafe Wherever You Go. Lousewart V was a man born into th e right time; his book perfectly refl ected all the foreboding of the late 1970s. Its thesis was simply th at everything science does is wrong , that scientists are very nasty p eople, and that we need to go back to a simpler, more natural way of life. The message was perfect for the time; it was simply Hitler's National Soci alism redone, with only a few minor changes. Where Hitler wrote \"Jew,\" for instance, Lousewar t wrote \"scientist.\" Nobody but the most backward denizens of Bad Ass, Texa s, or Chicago, Illinois, was capable of really getting riled up by the anti- Semitic ploy anymore, and Lousewart had, with intuiti ve brilliance, picked the one scapegoat capable of mobilizing real fear , rage, and hatred among the general population. And Hitler's Wagnerian primitivism was altogeth er too Teutonic for young Am erica in the 1970s, so Lousewart replaced it with a chic blen d of Taoist and Amer indian primitivism. It didn't matter that scholar s pointed out that all of Lousewart's arguments were illogical and incoherent (his followers despised logic and coherence on principl e), and it didn't even matter that he had brazenly lifted most of his notions right out of Roszak's Where the Wasteland Ends and Von Daniken's Gold of the Gods. It was a package that had a built-in market. W ith the collapse of the Republican Party after N ixon and Ford, there was a void in national politics; somebody had to organize a force to challenge the Democrats, and the People's Ecology Party moved quickly to capture the turf. Furbish Lousewart was an expert in Morality and Ideology; he understood that seeking out and denouncing no-good shits was the path by which one c ould become leader of a movement of the anxious and angry. In short, he had the instincts of a politician. The Lousewart philosophy of asceticis m, medievalism, and despair was officially called the Revolution of Lowered Ex p ectations. 21 / 233"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Revolution of Lowered Expect ations had not been invented by Furbish Lousewart. The whole neurosociology of the twentieth century could be understood as a function of two variables-the upward- rising curve of the Revolution of Rising Expectat ions and the downward-plunging trajectory of the Revolution of Lowered Expectations. The Revolution of Rising Expectations, which had drawn more and more people into its Up-thrust during the first half of the century, had led many to believe that povert y and starvation and disease were all gradually being phased out by advances in pure a nd applied science, growing stockpiles of surplus food in the advanced nations, accelerated medical progr ess, the spread of literacy and electronics, and the mounting sense that people had a right to demand a decent life for themselves and their children. The Revolution of Lowered Expect ations was based on the idea that there wasn't enough energy to p rovide fo r the rising expectations of the masses. Year afte r year the message was broadcast: There Isn't Enough. The masses were taught that Terra was a closed system, that entropy was increasing, that life was a losing proposition all around, and that the majority were doom ed to poverty, starvation, disease, misery, and stupidity. Most of the people who still had ri sing expectations were scientists. When Furbish Lousewart realized the political capital to be made from the Revoluti on of Lowered Expectations , he also realized-thus demonstrating his political savvy-that having an opposition meant having a scapegoat group. The scientists were an ideal scap egoat group because they all spoke in specialized languages and hardly anybody could understand them.

The next man drafted, in his p lace, had both tes ticles bloodily blown off in Korea. Williams, of course, never knew about this patriotic geldi ng, but he was well aware that various boys his age were having various portions of their anatomy blown off in Korea; being somewhat p hilosophical, he often reflected on the paradox that the polio (which had been, when it occurred, a p hysical agony to him and a psychological agony to his parents) had pres erved him from such mutilations. Considering that the only continuing effect of the polio was the slight limp, he had to admit that Nature or God or somethi ng-or-other had sneakily done him great good while appearing to do him great evil. This was a decided encouragement toward an optimistic attitude to ward the seemingly evil and made him wonder if the universe were not bene volent after all. The guy who lost his balls in Williams's place, on the other hand, b ecame a pronounced pessimist and cynic. Between Korea and Vietnam, while Blake was ac quiring first an M.S. and then a Ph.D. in p aleoanthropology, another great good fortune, in the form of anot her seeming evil, came before his eyes. He was walking in lower Manhattan; he had started from Washington Square, where he and his current girl friend-they were both NYU students-had just had a particularly nasty quarrel right after a biology class. He had wandered far to the west in a mood of suicidal gloom, such as young male p rimates often think they should experience after lo sing a sexual partner. Somehow, he wandered onto Vandivoort Street and found himself at the Vandivoort St reet incinerator. There he saw a most peculiar sight: a rather stout man, looking like he was about to cry, was watching while two younger, thinner men were pouring books out of a truck into the incinerator. \"What the hell?\" Blake Williams asked nobody in particul ar. It was like an old movie of Nazi Germany. N obody had told him that bookburning was now an American institution. He approached the stout man, who was the only one of the three w ho seemed unhappy, and repeated his question. \"What the hell?\" he as ked. \"I mean, are you people burning books?\" \"They are,\" the stout man said. He went on to explain th at he was an executive of something called the Orgone Institute Press and that a court had ordered all their books destroyed. Williams was curious and looked at some of the titles: Character Analysis and The Mass Psychology of Fascism and The Cancer B iopathy and Contact with Space. \"I didn't know that book burning was legal in this country,\" he said. \"Neither did I,\" the st out man said bitterly. Blake Williams walked on, dazed. He couldn't have b een more astonished if he'd seen Storm Troopers rounding up Jews. He wondered if he 'd fallen into a time warp. Later, of course, he learned that the Orgone In stitute, headed by Dr. Wilhelm Reich, had been investigating human sexuality and had come to so me highly unorthodox conclusions. Dr. Reich himself died in prison, Dr. Silvert (Reich's co-investigato r) committed suicide, the books were burned, and the heresy was buried. But Williams had an entirely new attitude toward th e country in which he lived, the scientific community which had looked on and made not a single gesture to support Dr. Reich and Dr. Silvert, and the omnipresent rhetor ic which insisted that the Dark Ages had ended many centuries ago. He remembered that Sister Kenny, at the time he and thousands of others were cured by her polio therapy, had been denounced as a quack by the same entrenched medical bureaucrats who imprisoned the Orgone researchers. How convenient, he thought, aghast, to assume that all the injustices happen in other countries and other ages: that Dreyfus may ha ve been innocent, but the Rosenbergs never; that Pasteur may have been right, but not the researcher ostracized from the American Association for the Advancement of Science-not the professor denied tenure at our university, not the man in our prison. Blake Williams came to the Great Doubt without b itterness but with increased awareness that societ y is 25 / 233"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"everywhere in conspiracy against intelligence. On hi s own, and at some expense, he repeated all of Dr. Reich's experiments and drew his own conclusions. \"There were only eighteen,\" he used to say, deliberately cryptic, sucking his pipe, deadpan, whenever anybody enthused about scientific freedom in his presen ce. If the victim i nquired, \"Only eighteen what?\" Blake would reply, with the same deadpa n, \"Only eighteen physicians who signed the petition against the burning of Reich's books in 1957.\" He was not disappointed in his expectation that nine out of every ten researchers would a ngrily reply, \"But Reich really was a quack.\" The tenth was the only one who would ever h ear Williams's real thoughts on any subject. The turning point, however, didn't come until 1977. It was then that Williams read a book entitled Cosmic Trigger. The author, a rather too cl ever fellow named Robert An -ton Wilson, who wrote in a style as opulent as a Mosl em palace, claimed to be in communicat ion with a Higher Intelligence from the system of the dog star, Sirius. He also provided evidence, of a sort, that Aleister Crowley, G. I. Gurdjieff, Dr. John Lilly, Dr. Timothy Leary, a Flying Saucer contactee named George Hunt Williamson, and the priesthood of ancient Egypt, among others, had also been contacted by ESP transmitters from Sirius. Williams found that he actually believed this preposterous yarn. The discovery thrilled him, since it didn't really matter whether the pretentious Wils on's pompous claims were true or not. What mattered was that he, Bl ake Williams was free at last. (Remembering: \"Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, I'm free at last,\" the to mbstone which had so move d him in 1968.) Despite B.S. and M.S. and Ph.D., Blake Williams was free. He did not have to think what other academics thought. He had somehow liberated hims elf from conditioned consciousness. Project Pan, in a sense, began at that moment. Bl ake Williams knew that he was going to do something great and terrible with his newfound freedom, and he was resolved that, unlike Reich (and Leary and Semmelweiss and Galileo and the long, sad list of ma rtyrs to scientific free dom), he would not be p unished for it. \"Screw the Earthli ngs,\" he said bitterly and with mucho cojones, \"I'm wise to their game. The trick is to be independent but not to let them know about it.\" That night he wrote in his diary, \"Challenge a remaining taboo.\" It was that simple. He had always wanted to understand genius, and now he had the form ula. Freud, living in an age that prized its own seeming rationality, had found one of the remaining taboos and dared to think beyond it: he discovered infant sexuality and the unconscious, among othe r things. Galileo had gone beyond the taboo \"Thou shalt not question Aristotle. \" Every great discovery had been the breaking of a taboo. Blake Williams began looking around fo r a remaining taboo to violate. This was by no means easy in Unistat at that time.

She ha d even gone to Dr. John Money, the pioneer of transsexual therapy and surgery, at Johns Hopkins, back in the mid-sixties. \"I think I'm a man living in a woman's body,\" she said. Dr. Money nodded; that was normal in his business. He began asking her questions-the standard ones- and in onl y a half hour she was convinced that she was not a transsexual; she was j ust a confused 26 / 233"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"woman. Dr. Money kindly gave her the name of a good psychiatrist in New York, where she lived, for a more conventional form of therapy. After three months the psychiatri st announced that Jo's problem wa s not Penis Envy. That was hardly exciting; she had never thought her problem was quite that simple. The therapy ground along. She learned a great deal about her Father Complex, her Mother Complex, her Sibling Rivalries, and her habit of hiding resent ments. It was enlightening, in a painful way, but she was still confused. Then the Women's Liberation Movement began, and Jo dropped out of therapy to enter politics. She no longer defined herself as a man trapped in a woman's body, but as a human being trapped in male definitions of femininity. It was a very satisfactory resolution of her probl ems. She no longer had to take responsibility for anything; everything was the fault of the men. There was no need to stifle resentments-the correct p olitical stance was to express them, in a strident voice and with a maximum of emotional-territorial rage. She had finally learned the ABC's of primate politics. She even learned to swell her muscles and howl. It was all so much relief after years of self-doubt th at Jo remained in 1968 while the rest of the world moved into 1970 and 1974 and 1980 and 1983. That was why she was wearing a BRING BACK THE SIXTIES button at Epicen e Wildeblood's party. Jo still had one problem le ft over from pre-Women's Lib days. Some times just before sleep, she heard a voice saying, \"No wife, no horse, no mustache.\" Of course she knew that everybody occasionally heard such voices in the hypnagogic reverie before true sleep. You were wi gging out only if you heard them all da y long. Still, she wondered where it came from and why it had such a cryptic message. Jo Malik hadn't had a sexual relationshi p with a man since 1968, and looked it. She was also sixty-four years old, and looked it. N evertheless, there was an Unidentified Man at th e Wildeblood party, and Jo suspected him of having designs on her bod. That was because he kept tryi ng to get into every conversation group that she intercepted. He was following her, she was convinced. \"Mother very easily made a jam sandwich using no peanuts, mayonnaise, or glue,\" Blake Williams said. \"Of course, Skull Island was Cooper's Chinatown,\" Jus-tin Case said at the same moment. \"Wham! That arbral with his showers sooty? The fugs come in on tinny-cut foets,\" Moon droned along. Jo decided that she had taken pe rhaps a little too much of the Af ghan hash that was going around. It seemed that everybody in the room-the creme de la creme of Manhattan intelligentsia-were all talking gibberish. She eased out onto the balcony for some fresh air and restful silence.

Because of the stealth and skill of these bands-made up of successful predator families that had been intermarrying for several generations-they collect ively owned 99.4 percent of all the territory and resources of Unistat. They only owned about 40 percent of the rest of Terra, and that seriously annoyed them. The Revolution of Rising Expectati ons annoyed them even more, because it led many primates to argue that the reason poverty and starvation still continue d in an advanced technological society was that Somebody Was Getting More Than Their Share. Whenever anybody asked who that Somebody might be, all eyes turned on these royal old primate male s who owned so much. The eyes were not friendly. Sometimes, in far-off lands where these royal pr imates did not completely control the governments, some of their boodle was actually seized and redist ributed to the people they had stolen it from.

There were proba bly TV shows and movies about him by now, over there in that universe. Or so Cotex argued. In general, as good empiri cists, the Belch Society was more intere sted in odd facts than in odd theories. A UFO Contactee who could jam zippe rs by looking at them. A man f ound dead in St. Louis with his throat torn as though by the fangs of an enormous b east, with no animal missing from the local zoos (the famous Stimson Case of 1968).

Books in which the permutations of the phrase \"heaven and hell\" appeared at random intervals, forming a Markoff Chain. \"Take anybody in the world-anybody in this novel,\" Cotex once explained his theory to a group of skeptical fellow characters. \"Lik e you, Dr. Williams,\" he added, picking out the most erudite and wiggy in the crowd, Blake Williams. \"In one of the parall el universes, you're probab ly not an anthropologist, b ut maybe a chemist or something. In another univers e, you might even be a female musician instead o f a male scientist. And so on. In another universe,\" Cotex concluded, '7 might be a small businessman from Little Rock w ho believes the universe is five-cornered.\" The disappearing gorillas, they were all convinced, were: (a) a major breakthrough to another universe; (b) not yet known to those stuffy old Forteans; and (c) really hot stuff. \"If gorillas can teleport,\" Professor Fred \"Fidgets\" Di gits was saying, \"that may be the whole key to the Mad Fishmonger.\" \"We needn't assume that the gorillas actually tele port,\" Dr. Horace Naismith objected. \"It may be that there is a Schwartzchild Radius in Lincoln Park Zoo and they sort of fall into it and pass the Event Horizon.\" This led to some lively debate on whether teleportati on was or was not more likely than a Black Hole in the Lincoln Park Zoo, but Blake Williams suddenly derailed the conversation with a thoughtful and uncompleted \"I wonder if this goes all the way back to the Democratic Convention of 1968. ...\" \"Say,\" Cortex cried, eyes wide. \"What was all th at fighting and fussing about, anyway? The way I remember it, the radicals wanted to sleep in the park and the police beat the shit out of them and chased them out of the park.

It is merely melted ice. -furbish lousewart V, Unsafe Wherever You Go The Mad Fishmonger was the patron saint of the Warr en Belch Society. He, or she, had originally appeared, or had been alleged to have appeared, in Cromer Gardens, Worcester, England, on May 28, 1881. He, or she, along with perhaps a dozen assist ants, had rushed through Cromer Gardens at high noon, throwing crabs and periwinkles al l over the streets. They also threw crabs and periwinkles into the fields beside the roa d. They climbed high walls to dump some of the fish into gardens and onto the roofs of houses. It was thorough, painstaking work, and since the Mad Fishmonger and his, or her, associates accomplished it all at noon on a busy day without being seen, the citizens of Cromer Gardens claimed that the crabs and periwinkles had fallen out of the sky. This notion was not acceptable to the scientists of the day, who held it as axiomatic that crabs and p eriwinkles do not fall out of the sky. A scientist from Nature magazine therefore offered the Mad Fishmonger an explanation, although he failed to explain how the Fishmonger and his co-conspirators had accomplished their feat without bein g noticed by any of the citizenry. Charles Fort, founder of the Fortean Society, rejected the Mad Fishm onger indignantly and claimed that crabs and periwinkles did fall from the sky. After Clem Cotex wa s thrown out of the Fortean Society for his heresies, he recons idered the whole puzzling case of the mysterious event in Cromer Gardens on May 28, 1881. Cotex decided to beli eve in the Mad Fishmonger. It was the fundamental hypothesis of his system of philosophy, and the guiding light of th e Warren Belch Society, that the craziest-sounding theory is the most likely one. All things c onsidered, the motives and methodology of the Mad Fishmonger were much more mysterious than shellfish falling from the sky; ergo, the Mad Fishmonger p robably did exist. Among the things the science of that time could not explain, which Clem Cotex attributed to the Mad Fishmonger, were other Damned Things that fell out of the sky, such as iron ba lls with inscriptions on them or chunks of ice as big as elephants. There were also Damned Things on the ground, including j umping furniture, \"haunts,\" and the Gentr y. There were animals that shouldn't be an d animals that couldn't be and trans-time and trans-sp ace perceptions and religious \"miracles.\" The first clue to correct understa nding of these things came when quantum causality was finally formulated correctly in Gilhooley's Dem onstration of 1994, and nob ody understood Gilhooley. At the time of our story everybody was as confused as Clem Cotex. Most of th em just expressed their confusion, or rather concealed it, in more conservative wa y s. 34 / 233"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" ANOTHER CIA PLOT The spirit of decision consists si mply in not hesitating when an inner voice commands you to act. -furbish lousewart V, Unsafe Wherever \"four Go Just before coming to Wi ldeblood's party, Blake Williams wrote one of the most heretical passages in his jealously guarded Secret Diaries. He wrote: I am an anthropologist, ergo a professional liar. An anthropologist is a scientist traine d to observe that every society is a little bit mad, including his ow n. He holds his job by neve r mentioning this fact explicitly. Perhaps 1983 as a whole had been too much for him. In January one of the biggest breakthroughs had occurred at Project Pa n, and Williams and Dashwood had to reach new heights of eloquence to p ersuade the other scientists involved that any premature disc losure could be lethal . At that very time, they pointed out, the John Birch Society was stag ing massive sit-ins and protests against the introduction of anthropology texts to high schools in Orange County. In February the Government Accounting Office announced that all the gold in Fort Knox had disappeared sometime in the past decade. In March three new life-extension pills were placed on the market during the controversy over FOREVER, the first life-extension pill, which was wide ly suspected of creating disastrous side effects. All the data on FOREVER thus far had shown one c onsistency: scientists not employed by Blue Sky Inc., the manufacturer of FOREVER, continually found evidence of these tragic side effects, and all scientists employed by Blue Sky c ontinually found no evidence of su ch problems. (That month Blake Williams wrote in his Diaries, quoting Lord Macaulay, \"The law of gravity would be thrown into dispute were there a commercial interest involved.\") In April average rent for a one-room apartment reached $1,500 per month a nd many families were renting broom closets at $600 to $700 per month or just sl eeping in parks.

On the corner of Lexington and Twenty-third, Benny was hit by a heavy lead pipe, which smashed his skull and killed him. The pipe did not fall by accident; it was wiel ded deliberately by a man named Francesco \"Pablo\" Gomez. Pablo did not hate Benny or have any personal feelings toward him at all and he did not grin sadistically. Pablo hit Benny with the pipe because Benny was well dressed and probably had money in his pockets. When Benny was comatose but not yet de ad, Pablo dragged him in to an alley and went through his pockets, finding to his delight that his surmise had been correct and Benny was actually carrying more than $50; he had $52, to be exact . Benny died while Pablo was rifling the wallet. To Pablo, $52 was a lot of mone y. He went home humming happily. That's the way things were in Unistat at the he ight of the Revolution of Lowered Expectations. CLUES Every string which has one end also has another end. -finagle's first fundamental finding Clem Cotex had been nosing about the Lincoln Park Zoo for several days and was more puzzled than ever. The facts were undeniable: The zoo had, indee d, purchased over 200 gorillas in the past decade and only two of them were on exhi bit; 198 were missing. Any sort of casual questioning of the primate house attendants brought instantly vague answers in a well-re hearsed manner. They were all in on the cover-up. The public was being protected against al l knowledge of the inexplicable, the weird, the surrealistic. All part of the usual governmental preten se that human affairs were rationally administered by experts who knew what was really going on.

All gravity c onditions were normal. The gorillas were not falling through a Schwartzchild radi us into the universe next door or anything really spooky like that. They were simply teleporting so mewhere . . . maybe back to their homelands in Africa. Although, consid ering the unpredictability of teleportive currents as documented by Charles Fort-who had recorded cases of snakes landing in Memphis, Tennessee, and coconuts being deposited in Worcester, England-the gorilla s might actually be reappearing anywhere. Since anything might be a clue in such occult enigmas, Clem had carefully copied all the graffiti in the men's room at the primate house. It was the usual ju mble of disparate and ambi guous signals: \"Black P. Stone Run It,\" \"For a good blow job call 555-1717 and ask for Father James Flanagan,\" \"Help Prevent Von Neumann's Catastrophe!,\" \"Arm the Unemployed,\" \"Free our four-legged brothers and sisters.

God bless America. THE ALTRUIST God bless America. -last words of G. I. gurdjieff Everybody who had been at Wildeblood's party felt comp elled to attend Benedict's funeral, even though none of them enjoyed it. Benny had b een one of the funniest writers of his time, at least in the daily p ress, and it would have been appropriate to send him off wi th a showing of old Laurel and Hardy films or something equally in his own me tier. Primate decorum forbade this. They packed him in with a dull and depressing \"religious\" ceremony. \"I am the Resurrection and the Life,\" intoned a primate with his collar on backward. Nobody knew what the hell that meant, if anything, but they tried to feel better when they heard it. At the time Benny was buried a window washer was at work on the seventeenth floor of the Morgan Guaranty Trust at 23 Wall Street . He was an expert lip-reader a nd knew more of the secrets of Wall Street than anybody outside the Illu minati. In fact, the second reason he had become a window washer was to get work in the Wall Street di strict and pick up useful information. The main reason he had taken the job would have been even more unnerving to Morgan Guaranty had they known about it. The window washer was a member of Purity of Essence and had already managed to place 333 homemade nuclear weap ons on ledges so high nobody but a pi geon was ever likely to see them. All of the weapons were set to go off at a signal from the POE computer-another homemade contraption but awesomely efficient. POE was full of science grads who had dropped out of the career game in horror and revulsion at the uses to which sc ience was being put in their universe. At this point POE had twenty-eight American cities mined. The window washer hoped that, when push came to shove, POE wouldn't have to detona te more than one of those cities .

He was a foundling, the bastard offspring of the local curate and a nun who, oddly enough, later told Chaucer a story he considered good enough to retell in verse. The nun was also the model for the Prioress in the earliest Tarot deck and her basic features remained even after that card became the Female Pope and, later, the High Priestess. Lord Greystoke named the infant Furbish Lousewart becau se he looked so dainty when they found him in the manger. Furbish Lousewart was as dainty a name as you could have in Merrie England in those days, being the vernacular term for herba pedicularis, a most lovely flower of the snapdragon species. Furbish Lousewart grew to manhood, married, fathered three le gitimate children and died in the Third Crusade. One of his illegitimate children, by Lady Greystoke, was the only Greystoke to survive that Crusade and carried on the Greystoke line, unknown to his brothers and sisters, who co ntinued the plebeian line of Lousewarts.

Screwing Latino girls rated 0 in his book (that was only sex), sc rewing Jewish girls was 5 (tha t was Status), but screwing a White Protestant girl was 10 points and a gold star (that was SUCCESS). Williams continues to tran smit to blank bored faces: \"Bell's Theorem basically deals with nonlo cality. That is, it shows that no local explanation can account for the known facts of quantum mechanics. Um perh aps I should clarify that. A local explanation is one that assumes that things seemingly separate in space and time are real ly separate. Um? Yes. It assumes, that is to say, that space and time are independent of our primate nervous systems. Do I have your attention, class? But Bell is even more revolutionary. He offers us two choices if we try to keep locality, and if there are any students in this class who are seriously interested in the subject this would be a good time to take a few no tes. Um. First choice: we can abandon quantum mechanics itse lf. That of course means in escapably that we abandon at omic physics and about three- quarters of everything we tall science. Um .

Eventually poor Percy decided to change his name and went to see an educated ma n, a lawyer, about having the job done legally; he also wanted some advice on choosing a better, more popular title.

Th e Gay set developed a superstition, almost a mystique, and the tradition of \"kissing it for good luck\" was even joked about, obscurely, in certain newspaper columns.

Why me, O Lord? -ancient primate question \"I said FUCK THE BLOO DY CAPITALISTS,\" the California writer was howling amid the gr oup at the mantelpiece, below the ithyphallic eidolon. \"Mother very easily made a jam sandwich using no peanuts, mayonnaise, or glue,\" Blake Williams was reciting patiently to N atalie Drest. \"TV, publishing, movies, everywhere-the extraterrestrials have taken over,\" Marvin Gardens was warning in his passionate Peter Lorre intonation. Benny Benedict suddenly had enough of the Wildeblood high-IQ se t. He wandered out on the balcony, to look at the stars and wonder, half-drunkenly, why he was so depressed. After three years the question still came to him when he had too much booze aboard: Why me? Which was selfish and maudlin. The real question should be: Why my mother? Or, more to the point: Why anybody? The world must be mad, that we go on living like this, and tole rate it. The primordial jungles were probably less dangerous than the streets of any city in Unistat. Was this the result ant of the long struggle upward from the caves-a world more frightening, more full of hatred and violence, more bloody than the days of the saber-tooth?

It's almost as if they're afraid somebody might have a flicker of hope or a good opi nion of humanity (at least in potential) or a brief moment of delusory security. Every night, to prev ent such unrealistic moods, they have to remind us that the violence and brutality is still continuing. With a shock, Benny discovered that he was weeping again, silently, guiltily, privately. He had thought he was past that. So much for booze as a tranquilizer. He fought against it. It was self-indulgence, disguised self-pity actually. He dabbed his eyes and tried to think of something else.

He is an actor, he thought. \"Through suffering,\" he repeated. \"There's no other way?\" \"Not in the primitive stages,\" the man sa id. \"Primitives are too self-centered to ask the important questions, until suffering forces them to ask.\" Benny felt the grief pass through him again, and leave. He grinned. \"You play this game very well.\" \"Anybody can do it,\" the man said. \"It's a gimmick, to get outside your usual mind-set. You can do it too. Just try for a minute-you be the advanced intelligence, and I'll be the primitive Terran. Okay?\" \"Sure,\" Benny said, enjoying this. \"Why me?\" The stranger's tone was intense. \"Why have I been singled out for so much injustice and pain?\" \"There is no known answer to that,\" Benn y said at once. \"Some say it's just chan ce-hazard-statistics.

SCHRÖDINGER THE MAN Your theory is crazy, but it's not crazy enough to be true. -neils bohr, quoted by beynam, Future Science Erwin Schrödinger did a lot more than just make up mathematical riddles about fictitious cats. His equations describing subatomic wave mechanics, which earned him a Nobel Prize, were among the most important contributions to particle theory in our century. Later, he turned his attention to biophysics and in a small book called What Is Life? he offered the first mathematical definition of the differ ence between living and dead systems, thro wing off as a side reflection the idea that life is negative entropy. This insight was to trigger qu ite a few new ideas in many of his readers, including Norbert Wiener of MIT and Claud Shannon of Bell Labs, who got so d eep into negative entropy, due to Schrödinger, that they created mathematical information theory and laid the foundations of the science of cybernetics, resulting ultimately in the Beast. Schrödinger didn't even believe in his own Cat riddle; he had propounded it only to show that there must be something wrong with quantum th eory if it leads to conclusi ons like that. Schrödinger didn't like quantum th eory because it pictures an anarchist universe and he was a determinist, like his good friend Albert Einstein. Thus, even though he had helped to create quantum theory and used it every day, Schrödinger kept hoping to find something seriously wrong with it. The Cat problem presupposes a Cat, a device of lethal nature, such as a gun or a poison-gas pellet, and a quantum process which will, eventually, trigger the weapon an d kill the Cat. Very simple. An experimenter, if he wanted to find out when the device had fired and killed the Cat, would look into the laboratory where all this was transpiring and note what actually happened. But- Schrödinger points out with some glee-modern physics, if it's all it's cracked up to be, should allow us to find out what is happening without our actually going into the laboratory to look. All we have to do is write down the equations of the quantum process and calculate when the phase ch ange leading to detonation will occur. The trouble is that the equations yield, at minimum, two solutions. At any given time-say one half hour-the equations give us two quantum eigenvalues, one of which means that the Cat is now definitely dead, kaput, spurlos versenkt, finished, and the other which tells us that the Cat is still alive as you and me. I never died, said he; I never die, said he. Most physicists preferred to ignore Schrödinger 's damned Cat; quantum mechanics worked, after all, and why make a big thing about something a little funny in the mathematics? Einstein loved Schrödinger 's Cat because it mathematically demonstrated his own conviction that suba tomic events couldn't be as anarchistic as wave mechanics seemed to imply. Einstein was a Hidden Variable man. He claimed there must be a Hidden Variable-an Invisible Hand, as Adam Smith might have said-controlling the seemingly indeterminate quantum anarchy. Einstein was sure that the Hidden Variable was something quite deterministic and mechanical, which would be discovered eventually. \"God does not play dice with the world,\" he liked to say. Decade followed decade an d the Hidden Variable remained elusive. In the 1970s, Dr. Evan Harris Walker solved the Cat paradox (to his own satisfaction) and defined the Hidden Variable (to 55 / 233"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"his own satisfaction). The Hidden Variable, he said, was consciousness. Ther e was muttering in some quarters that Walker was smuggling pantheism into physics disguised as quantum psychology, but many younger physicists-especially the acid- heads-accepted the Walker solution. Professor John Archibald Wheeler of Princeton found another way of dealing with the Cat; he took it literally. Every quantum indeterminacy, he proposed, creates two universes; thus, the equations are litera lly true and in one universe the Cat lives and in another universe the cat dies. We can only experience one universe at a t ime, of course, but if the math says the other universe is there, then by God it is there. Furthermore, since .5 probabilities occur continually-every time you toss a coin, for instance-there are many , many such universes, perhaps an infinite number of them. With two graduate students named Everett and Graham, Wheeler even worked up a model of where the other universes were. They were on all sides of us, in superspace. Some were heard to suggest that old Wheeler had been reading too much science fiction. TO CROSS AGAIN If I offer a child the choice between a pear and a piece of meat, he'll immediately take the pear. That's hi s instinct speaking . -furbish lousewart V, Unsafe Wherever You Go Mountbatten Babbit, being methodical in all things including hi s madness, could pinpoint exactly the date on which he had started sliding over the porous membrane separating the sane from the insane. It had been long, long ago-back in 1941, actually, in July, the twenty-third of the month, a Thursday. Or perhaps it had actually started the night before, on the twenty-second. It was hard to say, actually, even though Babbit was a man who detested imprecision of any sort. Say it was th e twenty-second, then, even t hough the overt symptom did not manifest until the twenty-third. We do want to be as accurate as possible wh en we're lost out here. So say the twenty-second: Mountbatten wa s a freshman at Antioch College then and the Carter Brothers Carnival was playing in nearby Xenia. Mounty and some friends went over to have a look-see. Since Mounty personally didn't wait around for the post-midnight private exhibition of th e lustful mulatto lady and the randy pony, advertised by shills in the crowd, the high point of the show for him had been the Mentalist, Cagliostro the Great. A girl assistant, in as brief a costume as the carnival could get away with back in nearly antediluvi an 1941 and barbaric Ohio, circulated through the audience, while Cagliostro, youngish and handsome for this racket, sat blindfolded on the stage. \"Now what am I holding?\" she would ask when somebody handed her a watch. \"I get the image of a timepiece . . . yes, a wristwatch,\" the magician intoned. \"What do I have in my hand this time?\" The answer was a locket. \"Can you tell me what this object is?\" A wallet photo. Driving back to Yellow Springs, the students fell into a debate. One guy from the psychology department gave a long spiel on Rhine and parapsychology and scientific data for ESP, wh ich convinced almost everyone. Babbit was the exception. He was not only a chemistry major but a leading firebrand for th e Atheist Club on campus and he knew damned well that ESP was pseudo-scientific balderdash and hocus-pocus. He spent the next day, the twenty-third, in the library, researching stage magic and, in a biography of Houdini, he found the answer. A simple substitution code. Now what = watch. What do I have = locket. Can you tell = p hoto. And so forth. Fraud, pure and simple, like everything that goes under the name of religion or magic. Sirius shone very bright that night in the southern sky and Mounty Babbit was back at the car nival, loaded for bear. When 56 / 233"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"the girl approached his part of the a udience, he handed her a prized and illeg al possession: a dragon-headed Japanese condom. \"Tell me what I have been given by this person.\" That wasn't in the Houdini code but neither was a condom, with or without a dragon head. \"It's against the law in this state,\" Cagliostro intoned somberly, causing heads to turn. \"And I would advise the young gentleman from Antioch to restrain his sense of humor in the future.\" A nd don't marry Suzie from Red Lion The second voice was-and- yet-wasn't Cagliostro's. Mounty took quite a riding from the other students on their way back to Yellow Springs that night. \"How did he know you were young?\" \"How did he know you were from Antioch-where was that in the code?\" \"Christ, a condom-you coulda got us all arrested.\" But nobody said anything about Suzie from Red Lion, Pennsylvania. Mounty finally forced the issue. \"What was that business about the lion?\" he asked with maximum indirection. It was as he had feared: nobody else had heard anything about a lion, or about Suzie. It was simple logic, then. ESP is fraud. Hearing voices in your head is insanity. Mountbatten Babbit, he told himself, you are in need of psychiatric help. But a psychiatric record would be a handicap in the career he al ready had mapped out for himself. Self-control, then, was the answ er. Nobody really goes bananas, after all, except weaklings. A man like Mountbatten Babbit simply would not go mad. But Mountbatten Babbit never did marry Suzie from Red Lion; th ere was a rather nasty war concluded with the exclamation point of a rather nasty bomb and then th ere was a marriage to a more suitably up ward-mobile partner and eventually there was a title of Chief Engineer at Weishau pt Chemicals in Chicago. It was 1967 and he was no longer a brash young atheist- scientist but a middle-aged scientist-businessman who knew e nough to keep his mouth shut about controversial issues and steadily feed a growing six-figure savings account. He had it made. If Cagliostro didn't keep get ting in the newspapers for one shocking incident or another, Babbit might even have been able to forget the whole episode in which he had thought he might be going mad. Then he crossed the boundary again. A juvenile delinquent named Franklin Delano Roosevelt Stuart, from the black ghetto on the South Side, stole Mounty's car from in front of the Babbit residence in Rogers Park at precisely a moment when Mounty was looking out the window. In his trained and methodical way Mounty memorized fifteen details about the boy as he ran out the front door only to catch the briefest glimpse of th e car zooming away (at least six f eet, blue sweater with turtleneck, Afro hair style, very black skin, nose more Caucasian than Negroid, drives well, face more narrow than norm, high forehead, no b eard, slim build to judge from shoulders, ring on left hand with green stone, clenched -fist button on sweater, earring in right ear, get more, damn there he goes arou nd the corner. . .). At the trial Mounty pronounced his positive identification in the same tones he used specifying materiel orders at Weishaupt Chemicals. The jury brought in a guilty verdict in five minutes. That was the second time Mounty went mad. For as the boy was led away Mounty glanced at him one more time and saw a blue halo form around his head just like in Catholic art. Two weeks later he was promoted to Vice President of Weisha upt and began to see halos around random individuals in the street. 57 / 233"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"LED, LED, LED If every case of aging can be corrected, we might all be Methuselahs, living 1,000 years or more. -dr. robert prehoda, 1969 A Chinese named Wing Lee Chee was Cagliostro's closest friend in those early carnival days .

The pickets outside the walls of Weishaupt Chemicals (which was now the nation 's second-largest producer of napalm) were the only harassment in an otherwise perfectly satisfactory life. The Invasion (as he came to call it) began in early 1969. He was driving home from work, came off Lake Shore Drive onto Sheridan, crossed the Howard Street border into Evanston, and noted a large billboard with an ey e atop a pyramid. A teaser campaign, he thought. The reverse side of the dollar bill. After a month or so of making people wonder, the advertisers would add their slogan. Probably another Friendly Loan Company.

Some alien entity had taken over his mind and written that check. My God, he thought, I am possessed.

In rapid succession, following a genetic script, he took a quick shower, shaved, changed into his best suit, went out for a slow stroll on Forty-second Street, and picked up a boy lounging outside the Fascination pinball arcade. They returned to \"Sullivan's\" room and the boy ther e received a slurpingly hedonic blow job, for which he was paid $25. The lad was then covered with rapturous kisses and compelled (o ut of politeness) to listen to an interminable monologue on the world's injustices to Ireland, the vill ainy of England, and the perfidy of the Masonic Jews. More kisses followed, the boy told a lugubrious story of poverty and legal problems, \"Sul livan\" coughed up $5 more, and the transaction was ended. \"Sullivan\" lounged on the bed for a while after the boy left, di scovered that another $15 had disappeared from his wallet, cursed mildly, showered again, and set out on his night's business. 59 / 233"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Another taxi delivered him to the Signifyin' Monkey, a nightclub on Lenox Avenue in Harlem.

But not right away. He would fight for self-control first. He realized that his mental condition was highly illegal. ESP in 1941. Halos and ESP together, after that black kid stole his car. Now he was having blackouts in which he performed abom inable acts that might threaten his security clearance and even his bank account. That was absolutely terrifying. Anything that endangered the bank account must be a symptom of the most aggravated psychosis. Yes: He would definitely absolutely irrevocably commit himself to psychiatric counseling. But not right away. He would fight for self-control first. One night the Babbits had the Moons from across the street as gu ests for dinner. Molly Moon, as usual, got Mary Lou into a discussion of the occult. All the usual hocus-pocus and rubbish. She was especially keen on some Neon Bal Loon, a Tibetan monk who had allegedly transferred his consciousness into the mind of an Englishman and was now writing books through the Englishman's mediumship. \"It's just the beginning,\" Molly enthused. \"Our materialism has be come a threat to the whole wo rld. Sure, more and more of the great Masters will be taking over Occidental bodies, to bring us their wisdom directly.\" Mounty Babbit concentrated on discussing the financing of an antidrug pamphlet wi th Joe Moon, detectiv e lieutenant on the Evanston police. Even that was disconcerting. \"It probably won't do any good,\" Joe said once, rather bitterly. \"The kids don't believe anything we tell them.\" The next step into psychosis was unexpected and oddly pleasurable. It occurred in the lunchroom at Weishaupt a few days later. Babbit was pouring sugar into his coffee when he suddenly looked at the sugar dispenser. The si mplicity of the design, the one small flap that opened to let the sugar pour, abruptly delighted him. It was as if he had never seen it before. After that he was noticing more and more things in that heightened vision. One day in the Loop he saw a mother whirl suddenly and slap a whining child. His heart leapt with shock-an d then he remembered that th is was an everyday occurrence in America. It was as if he had seen it from the perspective of some culture where whining and hitting were not normal communication between parents and children. He wanted less and less meat in his diet; m eat now appeared heavy and hard to digest. The strangest and most disturbing thing of all was the way Weishaupt Chemicals itself began to change. But everything was the same; he was just seeing with diff erent eyes. The contrast between the execu tive offices and the workshops was an overwhelming experience. Arch itecture, coloring, decorati on, upkeep-every kind of communication except words themselves said with total clarity \"The Masters\" and \"The Se rfs.\" The typical primate pack hierarchy, unnoticed and taken for granted before. Strange visions came to him when ever his mind relaxed from financial or scie ntific problems. He would be in a burning j ungle, running from helicopters that caused the burning. Or he would be in a temple with the eye-on-the-pyramid design practicing strange breathing exerci ses. Once he even had a name- Fed King- and he watched as one of his teachers burned himself to death in protest against th e war. He was Fed Xing seeing through the eyes of Mountbatten Babbit. His monogamy, which he usually succeeded in maintaining fifty-one weeks of the year, was falling apart on him. He worried that Mary Lou would be growing suspicious. Women tu rned him on constantly, incessantly, tor-mentingly, as in early adolescence. Not all women-just white women. Fed Xing couldn't get enough of them. He couldn't even get enough of any one of them. Even after an orgasm, I would want to start again, rubbing and caressing their moist pussies until they came a second time. This excited me so much that I would ofte n go down and suck them into a third orgasm. Then Fed Xing would ask them to suck him an d drift off into aeons of tension and pleasur e, glimpsing the temple of the eye-on-the- pyramid, occasionally even comi ng a second time himself, which hadn't happe ned since he was in his early twenties.

I'm a black motherfucker and I don't mind dyin'. Call this the first metaprogram. It led Ha ssan (then called F.D.R. Stuart) far outside the ghetto into an entirely new and different world. It was easy. By acting out the imperatives of the Stackerlee \"black motherfu cker\" script, the boy earned a term in the Audy Home, an institution for the further training of apprentice outlaws who slash tires on police cars, heave bricks through school windows, peddle merchandise from stor es without first purchasing them, and answer policemen's questions with \"Fuck you, ya honky motherfuck 'n cocksucker.\" F.D.R. Stuart received the standa rd Audy Home training, which consists of sophisticated expert coaching in: (a) sodomy; (b) sado-masochism; and (c) a ssorted crimes more lucrative than selling shoplifted merchandise. He was, after graduation, ready for postgr aduate work at Springfield, once he passed the admissions test, which consists of being captured by the police while in the p ossession of something hot. He was in po ssession of a Ford Mustang registered to a Mountbatten Babbit of Ev-anston. Postgraduate work at Sp ringfield included a refresher course in sodomy and S-M, together with advanced study in grand larceny; but by this time F.D.R. Stuart had begun to doubt that the Stackerlee metaprogram contained the whole answer to life's problems. A former Black Musl im, now a Sufi, was his cell mate, and taught him various things about the less-publicized qualities of the human nervous system. F.D.R. Stuart spent many hours staring at one wall of his cell, gradually creating a hole through which he could pass into another world. There was a differ ent kind of time over there, and eventually he discovered th at angels and fairies and elves and witches and Bodhisattvas and conjurs and all sorts of superhuman folk could be contacted and persuaded to become allies. The Sufi cell mate, a heavy cat in more wa ys than F.D.R. Stuart ever understood, pretended to be unimpressed with this achievement and laid down some stern raps about the perils of \"Opening the Gate\" without first \"clarifying the soul.\" The upshot of it was that young Stuart spent an hour a day memorizing a page in the dictionary until he had a vocabulary that would grace a Harvard graduate. Alas, the Sufi was paroled around then and Stuart continued hi s explorations unguided. In 1983, in Harlem, New York, Hassan i Sabbah X was the Horset hief of a group known as the Cult of the Black Mother. This was ostensibly devoted to the worship of Kali, goddess of destruction (and rebirth); th e police suspected, but couldn't prove, that it was also a kingpin in international hashish smuggling. The FBI, meanwhile, had their own suspicions; they believed it was a Black Revolutionary Army disguised as a ch urch. An Army Intelligence agent of appropriate Negritude and duplicity managed to gain admission to one of the lower ranks bu t learned only that: (a) Horsethief was a term for head honcho or boss man borrowed from the gypsies; (b) the rituals we re fairly close to those of orthodox Hindu Kali worship, except for certain Masonic elem ents; and (c) every time a black FBI agent ma naged to infiltrate the Cult of the Black Mother, he died very so on of a heart attack. The last fact was well known, and ofte n discussed, at the Bureau. The word witchcraft popped up at least once in each of these conversations, and was quickly laugh ed down, but each agent went away har boring his own very private opinions. Some of them even began attending the ch urch of their choice even more often th an was expected by the rather Puritan standards of the Bureau. The CIA which actually employed Hassan i Sa bbah X as a spy on ghetto affairs, was well aware that he planned to double- cross them at the first opportunity, but that didn't worry th em. They had their own plans for him, which were expressed in their usual jolly euphemism, \"termination with maximum prejud ice,\" a remark illustrated by a finger drawn across the throat to make the meaning clear to neophytes. But that was only for the future, when he began to show signs of shifting allegiance. N ow (it is the night of December 23, 1983, again) while a miniat ure sled with eight tiny reindeer was allegedly dodging past commercial airliners, co mmunications satellites, flying saucers, and other technocraft in the skyways, two human beings of reprehensible character drove up to the Su tton Place digs of Mary Margaret (Epicen e) Wilde-blood in a truck hired from U- Haul only a few hours earlier. These were Edward J. Smith an d Samuel R. Hall, and they ha d been purged from the Black Panther Party a few months earlier because of their fondness for the null-circuit neurological prog ram induced by injecting diacetylmorphine (C 21H23NO5) directly into their veins. This compound was known as heroin to white p eople and caballo to Ed and Sam's Puerto Rican neighbors. Ed and Sam called it horse and mainlined it as often as they possibly coul d-\"riding the horse over the rainbow \" was their expression for the null p rogram, and it meant as much to them as Samadhi to a Hindu or the Eucharist to a Catholic. In fact, it allowed them to forget for a while that, to 90 percen t of their fellow citizens, they were unmistakably identifiable as niggers, a species generally regarded as twice as ugly and ten times as dangerous as wild g orillas. It didn't matter, to Sam and Ed, that the p eo p le who believed this also believed in the existence 64 / 233"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"of a gaseous vertebrate of astronomical heft named God, in the Virgin Birth of U.S. Senators, in the accuracy of TV news, and in premarital chastity for women. Sam and Ed also believed in the existence of the gaseous vertebrate, the immaculate generation of senators, the pictures on the tube, and premarital chastity for at least some women (their own sisters, wives, and daughters). They also believed that they were twice as ugly and ten times as dangerous as wild gorillas, but that they had a right to be that way. They called it Black Pride. Once inside the Wildeblood apartment, Ed and Sam were as efficient as a pay- of vacuum cleaners. To say they took everything that wasn't nailed down is to underestimate their rap acity. If something that looked valuable was nailed down, they employed pliers and othe r tools. When they finally drove away the U-Haul truck was as stuffed wi th goodies as the miniature sled al legedly circling the skies at that moment. When Mary Margaret Wildeblood returned from her month in Vermont, she was heard to compare her condition to that of the Chinese farmer in The Good Earth after the locusts had passed. Ed and Sam drove directly to the Sugar Hill apartm ent of Hassan i Sabbah X, which is not listed on the mailboxes and can only be reached through anothe r apartment with the name LESTER MADDOX on it. Ed, who knew this scene better than Sam, knocked. \"White,\" said a muffled voice from inside. \"Man,\" Ed replied. \"Native,\" came the voice again. \"Born,\" Ed completed the formula. The door opened, and they were ushered into the home of a very respectable Afro-Methodist clergyman who had never been publicly connected in any way with Hassan i Sabbah X. \"What was that jive?\" Sam demanded. \"Password,\" Ed explained briefly. \"Borrowed from the Ku Klux Klan,\" the clergyman added wi th some glee. \"He got himself one weird sense of humor, Brother Hassan.\" He ushered them into the kitchen, slid the re frigerator around easily on specially built ball rollers, and the y passed through to an apartment that did not exist in anybody's records anywhere. The air was heavy with the smell of Indi an hemp; an enormous statue of Kali, the Black Mother, dominated the room. A group of black men sat in a circle and Sam recognized two sm all cigarettes circulating in opposite directions, which he called clockwise and counterclockwise, not knowing the technical magical terms deosil and widdershins. \"You will now ascend to the sixth plane, without my guidance,\" said Hassan i Sabbah X to the circle. \"I am returning to the earth plane briefly. Aummmm ...\" \"Aummmm ...\" came the blissful reply from the students. Hassan led Sam and Ed to another room. \"What's all that sixth-plane shit?\" Sam whispered to Ed. \"Astral projection,\" was the brief reply. Hassan seated himself at his desk and sm iled genially. \"Been out celebrating the Lord's birthday?\" he asked pleasantly. \"Expropriating the expropriators?\" \"We got a fuckin' truckload downstairs,\" Ed replied. 65 / 233"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"\"Mmmm-mm/\" Hassan said. \"A merry Yuletide indeed.

This was Robert Pearson by birth, Robert Pear son, Ph.D., according to the anthropology department at U.C.-Berkeley, El Hajj Stackerlee Mohammed during a militant period in the sixties, Clark Kent (with his Supermen) during his commercial rock music years, and now Robert P earson again. \"Accompany these cats to our ware house and e-valuate th e cash value of their merchandise,\" Hassan instructed. Another trip brought Ed and Sam, with Pearson, to a bui lding on Canal Street bearing the legend BHAVANI IMPORTS. Here the truck was unload ed, cataloged and priced. \"A genuine Klee or I'm a brass monke y,\" Pearson said once. \"Your uh cl ient has bread as well as taste.\" \"Now, what's this shit?\" he said later, scrutinizing a s accharine rendition of tw o naked boys preparing to dive into a swimming hole, framed by a gingerbread copper-pla ted oval. \"Oh, well, we can sell it as camp.\" His sharpest reaction came when he confronted the redwood plaque bearing the ithyphallic eidolon. \"Jesus H. Christ on a unicycle,\" he breathed. Sam and Ed exchanged glances. \"We can't figure that one out, either,\" Sam ventured. \"Beats the hell out of our ass.\" \"Looks like some bozo's joint,\" Ed suggested helpfully. Pearson put out an exploratory hand. \"Feels like some bozo's joint,\" he amended. \"Sure as shit ain't plastic.\" He shook his head wearily. \"What I want to know is what kind of bozo would do this to his joint?\" Sam and Ed shrugged. \"He was a white bozo,\" Sam contributed finally. \"I can see that,\" Pearson said. \"A crazy white bozo,\" He rolled his eyes heavenward . \"Lawd, Lawd,\" he said in down-home accents, \"the things that white folks do, it's just to o much for this si mple cullud boy .\" \"Skin!\" cried Sam. \"Skin,\" Pearson agreed. They slapped palm s. And there the mystery rested until Hassan i Sabbah X arrived personally to inspect the new imports a few days later. \"Namu Amida Butsu,\" he said, peering closely. \"Shee-it.\" \"Where do you think we can sell it?\" Pearson asked dubiously. \"That I do not know,\" Hassan i Sabbah X pronounced slowly. \"But when we do find a buyer, the price will make your head swim. This is a one-of-a-kind item.\" Things were coming to a head. The key was no key. Hassan had other things on his mind that weekend; he was we ll aware that \"Frank Sullivan\" (probably, in his estimation, a double agent for both Washington and Peking) had recognized \"Washy\" Bridge and that opened a very wiggly can of worms, indeed. Ever since Washy had told him about Project Pan, in fact, Hassan had felt increasingly like the Sorcerer's Apprentice in the legend. A line from an H. P. Lovecraft story came back to his consci ousness over and over again: \"Do not, I beseech you, call up any that you cannot put down.\" Like many another occultist before him, Hassan i Sabbah X now wished he had taken that warning a bit more seriously a bit sooner. . . . Even before he left Bhavani Imports he was st artled by an incident that seemed a definite Santaria synchromesh. \"Hey, listen, man,\" an art appraiser cried, catch ing his sleeve, \"I've just h eard the greatest limerick. Li sten, just listen: 'A habi t obscene and unsavory-' \" He broke down, laughing, caught hims elf, and repeated urgently, \"Listen.\" He tried again: \"A habit obscene and unsavory Holds the Bishop of Boston in slavery.

He was in mild first-circuit anxiety all the way to his destination. He remembered his first conversation with Washy Bridge. \"How many?\" he had asked, not in shock or in ; outrage but in simple unbelief, inability to believe. They are our creation: we are their creation. \"Fifty-seven of us.\" The scientist was pe rspiring with anxiety, now that the secret was finally out, the reason he had fled Project Pan. \"Fifty-seven,\" Hassan said hollowly. Heinz 57 Varieties, he remembered absently fr om the advert isements. \"And all of them with Ph.D.'s and M.D.'s and more diplomas than a dog has fleas ...\" \"You've got to realize it works,\" Washy said then. \"You just can't understand if you don't keep that in mind. It works.\" \"And two hundred to three hundred years in jail for each of you if it ever gets out,\" Hassan added harshly. \"You just better keep that in mind too.\" \"That's why I'm here,\" the scientist said. Hassan had paced the room briefly. \"Wheels within wheels,\" he sa id once. \"Wheels within wheels within wheels.\" Once he grinned. \"At least I know why the Cincinnati cocaine market is thriving,\" he said with a lewd chuckle. \"Cincinnati,\" he repeated, shaking his head. \"W hat do they call it again?\" \"Knights of Christianity United in Faith.\" A habit obscene and unsavory, Hassan remembered suddenly, jostled back in to present time. He had arrived at his destination. The man to whom he spoke th en was a stockbroker according to public knowledge but purs ued certain other careers in a private and clandestine manner. 'Frank Sullivan,' \" Hassan said. \"I want to know everything about him. Everything.\" The part-time stockbroker turned ashy-whi te. He got up, glared suspiciously at a window washer outside his office, and walked over to check that the window was closed all the way. \"Impossible,\" he said then, in a near whisper. \"If I told you the one most amusing and interesting fact about him, I'd be dead tomorrow.\" \"That hot?\" Hassan asked. The man leaned back in his chair and gazed absently toward the ceiling. He recited some names, beginning with Jack Ruby of Dallas and ending with a senator whose p rivate plane had crashed just the week be fore, on Christmas Eve. \"Those are just a few,\" he ended, \"who happened to find out too much about Frank Sullivan.\" Hassan spoke only once during the drive back to Harlem. 67 / 233"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"\"Secrecy!\" he said with a profound grimace.

The night watchman at Bhavani Im ports, a Puerto Rican poet and Santaria initiate named Hugo de Naranja, was reading a novel called Illuminatus! when the mysterious inci dent occurred. Hugo was so absorbed in the book, whic h he considered the greatest novel since Don Quixote, that he didn't notice the strange sound at first. Gradually the sound s persistence invaded his consciousness, dragged him out of the most aestheti cally exquisite blow job in all modern fiction, jerked him into an alert awarene ss that out there in the darkness there was something odd going on. Rats, he thought. N o, the quick trot of rat paws was different. A thief with soft slippers, or in his stockings . . . N ot that, either. Hugo put down his book and picked up flashlight in left hand groping right-handedly and then finding pistol in holster. Something was going on in the vast darkness of the warehouse and he had to go and look for it and do something about it. He wished he hadn't read so many Women's Lib diatribes against machismo and Papa Hemingway. He wished he could still believe in the macho values. He wished he had more cojones or another job. Then he walked out of his cubbyhole office, flashing the li ght ahead of him, and quoted to himself from his favorite philosopher. \"The ordinary man has pr oblems. The warrior only has challe nges.\" Then he saw the intruder. A cat. It was only a cat, held for one moment in his lightbeam, then ski ttering away into deeper darkness as the light raced after it. Then it was caught again, higher up, standing for Christ's sake on the ghastly amputated penis plaque, its golden eyes glittering half-whitely in the flashed lightray. A cat st anding on a penis, something right out of Surrealism or Dada. \"Scat!\" Hugo shouted, really am used now. \"Rrrow! Scat! Beat it!\" Then the cat leapt and Hugo's flash leapt after it jumping to the floor, where it would, should, must, didn't land. The light moved back quickly, swept several arcs, while Hugo was beginning to think: Christ, it didn't make any sound when it landed, not even a muffled cat thud. And his beam swept back and forth again in searching arcs , as the words formed \"it disappeared in midair,\" were rejected (it couldn't) and the beam rested for a minute on the challengingly er ect Penis Without a Man (what hijo de puta would do a thing like that?) and the question burst from his lips, aloud, the nightwatchman's vice of talking to himself, which he had always resisted before: \"Where did it the fuck jump to?

Mounty and the psychologist defined Fed Xing as a hallucination caused by the negative conditioning of the pacifist pickets surrounding Weishaupt Chemicals. A method of deconditi oning was worked out, using hypnosis and aversion therapy against all manifestations of the Fed Xing persona. The aversive stimulus was apomorphine, a non-addicting morphine derivative that provokes vomiting and sensations of death. At first Fed Xing would speak directly at these moments, begging and pleading, \"Don't send me back to the flames. ...\" Later he became defiant. \"We'll be back, millions of us, from all over the Third World. Living in your fat white bodies. Running you r corporations and bureaucraci es. All through the seventies and eighties. We'll be back.\" As the theory of aversion therapy predicts, Fed Xing was finally extinguished. Safely established beyond freedom and di gnity, Mounty Babbit became the ideal c onditioned subject. In 1982 he resigned his position as President of Weishaupt Chemicals to b ecome Special Scientific A dvisor to the White House.

The New York News-Times-Post actually referred to Hassan as a \"well-known nightclub owner in Harlem,\" in their very brief st ory, and their reporter hadn't even investigated far enough to learn that Hassan was also the head of a cult with more members than the Missouri Synod Lutherans. But, then, the Cult of the Black Mother had never been publicity-minded; even The Amsterdam News, unaware of its membership, described it as \"a small church.\" Hassan had been delivered to Bellevue in a state of raving mania, under physical re straint by two of his former aides. The psychiatrists quickly pronounced him \"paranoid schizophrenic\" and prescribed the heaviest tr anquilizer then available, which in fact kept him fairly drowsy even when he wasn't comatose. Nonetheless, wh en able to summon the energy to rise out of his lethargy and talk again, he would monotonously re peat to any other inmate or orderly who came near, \"Look, I don't belong here. Something terrible has happened. I'm really the President of this fucking country ...\" and so on, with endless elaborations and details. \"A deeply defended psychosis,\" the psychiatrists d ecided, and began a course of electroshock treatments. Whenever the flipped-out black came out of his daze, however, he would begin the same sc hizzy ranting all over: \"Hey, listen, I'm the President of this fucking country. ...\" The electroshock was steppe d up. Hassan retreated into a permanent daze and ceased to ann oy anybody. By this time his brain had been fried to the consistency of a White Tower scrambled egg and his impressions of the external world were mostly olfactory and aural, like those of a subnormal toy poodle; he no longer argued about anything, since he no longer understood such abstract concepts as ego persistence or identity . The psychiatrists were satisfied: \"If you can't cure a nut,\" their tacit motto was, \"at least you can keep him from running around the ward annoying people.\" Two FBI agents later discussed the matter privately. \"You think CIA did it?\" asked the first, Tobias Knight. \"You figure he'd been working for them?\" the other, Roy Ubu, asked in return. \"I always had that notion myself. But why would they fuck his head like that, when God only knows what he might spill to somebody who'd get released from the nuthouse and repeat it to a reporter? Nah, CIA doesn't work that way. They'd ju st-\" He drew a finger across his throat. \"I don't believe in coincidences,\" Knight said stubbornly. \"Somebody got to him.\" \"Something,\" Ubu corrected with a sinister in tonation. \"You know as well as I do what he was. A witch.\" \"Voodooist,\" Knight corrected. \"Whatever. Everybody we ever sent in died of a heart attack, right?\" Ubu looked over his shoulder. \"Officially, the Bureau doesn't believe in witches.

He checked his wristwat ch again after he parked his sleek M.G. in the executive parking lot. It was 8:58. Excellent. A quick trot and he was at his desk before the office clock reached nine. Once again he had demonstrated the punctuality (anal-retentive personality, silly prescientific Freudians called it) which had contributed so much to raising him to his present high pos ition in the medical research bur eaucracy of the United States. Frank Dashwood, M.D., L.L.D., Ph.D., at th e age of only thirty-eight , headed the most heavily funded and hotly debated institution in the world: Orgasm Research, a multimillion-dollar project dedicated to filling in the psychological intangibles left out of the pioneering research of Ma sters and Johnson two decades earlier. Si nce these psychological intangibles were- as Dr. Dashwood sometimes wittily remarked-\"both psychological and intangible,\" there was no end to the research. Meanwhile, the funding money came rolling in. Frank was, according to a survey by a management analyst, one of the seventeen men in the Un ited States who was totally happy with his job. Other researchers sometimes expressed envy of this fact. \"W hat red-blooded man,\" one of them had once asked with some warmth, \"wouldn't be happy supervising other people's orgasms and pulling down a swift sixty grand a year for it?\" This was somewhat unfair to a dedicated scientist. Dr. Da shwood was truly fascinated by orgasms-as Edison was by electricity-and had an inexhaustible curi osity about every possible factor involved in every possible twitch, itch, moan, gibber, gasp, sob, shudder, or howl connected with that dramatic biological tremor. Even more, however, he was mesmerized by lines, curves, aver ages, graphs, and every aspect of mathematics that could be clearly visualized. The world, for him, was not made up of \"things,\" crude Disneyland animat ions projected by our lower nervous circuits, but of energy meshes. With no knowledge of Zen Buddhism, he intuitivel y shared Sixth Patriarch Hui Neng's vision that \"from the beginning there has never been a thing.\" Dr. Dashwood lived in a univer se of transactions that could be written as equations and traced on graph paper. Above his desk was a motto suggested ironically 'by a skeptical friend. Dr. Dashwood saw nothing funny about it and adopted it as his own banner: SCIENCE, PURE SCIENCE, AND DAMNED BE HE WHO FIRST CRIES \"HOLD, TOO MUCH!\" As he settled himself at his desk he observed that Ms. Karrige, his secr etary, had already poured his coffee for him. Fine: The girl (femperson, he correct ed) was really getting broken to the harness. He whipped out his thermometer and measured the black liquid in the cup: 98.4 degrees. Excellent: She was learning to meet his exacting demands. Dr. Dashwood could not abide inexactitude or slovenliness in any human activity. \"A thing worth doing,\" he would explain to his subordinates, \"is worth doing right.\" He said this often, and malicious members of the staff said it even more often, when he was out of earshot , with a tone and a facial expression that were caricatures of his own. With a smile on his lips and a glint in his eye, Frank Dashwood buzzed Ms. Karr ige. \"What's first for today?\" he asked cheerfully. The Jabberwock was growing: The key was no key. . . .

At first there was no visibility at ground level, but as he des cended the roof of Murphy's house a bit of yard came into view. N one of the neighboring houses was visible at all. Approaching Murphy's roof, Starhawk slowed and then stopped hi s descent. In midair he turned, every muscle straining, and continued his descent headfirst, legs tightly together, the styl e of a professional highdiver. A small film of perspiration formed around his lips. He was totally silent. Twice, redwood branches almost tangled his ropes. He remained totally silent while disengaging. Finally, he gripped the roof edge with his left hand, let out more slack with his right, and lowered himself until he was looking in the corner of a window upside down. It was the bedroom. Murphy wasn't there. The bed was unmade. Starhawk raised himself, swung, and descended again to insp ect another window. The living room. Murphy was sitting in a red plush chair, his face expre ssionless. He was listening to music on the st ereo. A shotgun leaned against the wall behind him. Very slowly, Starhawk raised himself again and swung to the next window. In five minutes, totally silent, he was sure that there was nobody in any of the other rooms. He slowly raised himself again and found a perch in a redwo od that commanded a view of the front yard and doorway. He waited. The music from the stereo drifted up to him. Peggy Lee was singing \"My Funny Valentine.\" After waiting forty-five minutes, Starhawk descended again. Murphy was no longer in the living room. The shotgun was missing also. \"The fuck?\" Starhawk muttered. He swung carefully over to the bedroom window. The shotgun rested against the wall beside the closet. Murphy came out of the closet and picked up the shotgun again. Careful man, that Murphy; never go anywhere without your shotgun when you're holding maybe half a million in hot snow. Murphy looked quite happy now. He looked lik e the happiest man Star hawk had ever seen. Starhawk returned to his perch in the redwood tree. Murphy had obviously taken a snort of the coke and was probably feeling like Luke Skywalker heading for th e Death Star. Starhawk waited silently. It was good to know where the cocaine was. A few minutes later a squirrel came along an overhead branch and almost walked over Starhawk's rope. He stopped, frozen: unable to believe that a human being was way up here in the tree. Starhawk and the squirrel stared at each ot her, both immobile. Th en the squirrel ran. Starhawk smiled. He went on waiting, quietly. FIRST MAMMAL-ROBOT DYAD Dr. Dashwood buzzed Ms. Karrige. \"What's fi rst for today?\" he asked cheer fully, eager to plu nge directly back into the thick of things, as was typical of him on Monday mornings. \"The uh colored gentleman from New York,\" came the tinny voice on the intercom. 75 / 233"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"\"Send him right in!\" Frank said eagerly. Robert Pearson was dressed in his \"dealing with the straight establishment\" clothes, which meant that he looked like the black equivalent of a Mafia don moving in on a legit cor poration. You had to look twice to realize that he was too resplendent to appear really conservative. \"You really have the um merchandise?\" Dr. Dashwood asked. \"I wouldn't waste your time otherwise,\" Pearson said carefully. \"And it's not flaccid? I can get them in fl accid state'from Johns Hopkins's sex-change department, by the gross. This must be totally erect, and I can't imagin e how you managed that. ...\" Pearson removed a package from his brie fcase. \"See for yourself,\" he said. Dr. Dashwood spent several minutes examining the ghoulish tro phy. Pearson sat back and lit up a black Sher-man cigarette. He was wondering ju st how surprised Dashwood would be if he mentioned his own long-ago Ph.D. or his career as lead guitarist with Clark Kent and his Superm en. He was just another black gangster as far as Dashwood knew or cared. \"It's real,\" Dr. Dashwood said finally. \"A beautiful specimen,\" he added with total scientific detachment. Then he looked directly at Pearson with unblinking curiosity. \"You either have a friend with a truly desperat e need for money or an enemy who now knows what it means to rous e your anger,\" he commented mildly. The haggling over money began at that point. Pearson left on the noon flight to New York, bearing $10,000, which later found its way to Afghanistan and came back in the form of bricks of pure hashish. Dr. Dashwood, meanwhile, was in m.o.q.-the multiple-orgasm- quotient laboratory-making certain technical adjustments on the ACE equipment. ACE-for artificial coital equipment-had been devised by the Masters-Johnson team and allowed a plastic imitation penis, containing microphotographic devices, to stimulate the inside of a vagina while obtaining clear photographic evidence of the actua l physiological changes occurrin g therein. Orgasm Research had used the same model in their investigation of m.o.q.-the endeavor to find out precisely how many orgasms a multiply orgasmic woman could actually have without untoward side effects. It was Dashwood's conviction that, the physiological data being already determined, a real penis was more practi cal now; but a year-long sear ch for the once-famous Cuban Superman had failed to locate the stalwart stud. (\"Those bloody puritanical Commies have probably rehabilitated him into more socially useful work,\" Dashwood concluded mournfully.) N ow at last with the re lic of Wildeblood's quantum jump across the gender gap attached to ACE, Dashwood had the ideal scientific instrument to measure m.o.q. A subject had been obtained via ads pl aced in underground newspape rs throughout the state of California. (\"What do Easterners know about fancy fucking?\" Dashwood asked, ruling out everybody on the other side of the Rockies. All that part of the country, he firmly believed, was a puritan's h eaven and a hedonist's hell.) The ad said bluntly: SEXPOT WANTED We are not making porny movies. We are not kinks or creeps. This is a serious scientific project. If you think you qualify, and would like to earn $1,000, write Box 56, San Francisco, in strict confidence. Weeding out unlikely prospects had been time-consuming and somewhat wearying, although a few had set some interesting records with the old plastic ACE apparatu s. The subject selected to have the tr ial run on the new reincarnated ACE was a Ms. Rhoda Chief, vocalist with a rock group called the Civic M onster. Known to critics as the best heavy rock singer since Janis Joplin, Rhoda was originally renowned back in the sixties for her own curious mutation of old-fashioned Dixieland \"scat singing\"; what few realized was that her riffs were not mere Jabberwocky but actually fragments of the Enochian Keys used by Dr. John Dee, Mr. Aleister Crowley, and other magici ans. People who came out of Ci vic Monster concerts seeing auras, hearing strange voices, catching odd fugitive glimpses into fairyland and Oz, or seeing the djinns gathered about the throne of Allah, attributed this to th e heavy marijuana fumes always circulating in the air at rock concerts. What Rhoda herself saw during those moments was a secret between herself and her occasional lover in th at decade, the controversial stage magician Cagliostro the Great. Rhoda had gained another reputation in the 1970s: \"That chick gives head better than anybody in show biz,\" it was often 76 / 233"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"said in High Society. But this rumor had not reached the aseptic scientific world in which Dr. Dashwood moved. Twirling his dapper bow tie debonairly, Francis Dash-wood, p hysician and scientist, strode down the hall to Laboratory Three. Rhoda Chief, already nude but with a single sheet demurely sp read over her full and obviously still-glorious body, smiled brightly as she saw the doctor. \"Where's ACE?\" she asked cheerfully. \"We've been making some improvements,\" Dashwood said with professional unction. \"You might find today's research a distinct improvement over the test runs last week.\" The sheet slipped a bit, revealing several inches of round, tense breast. \"You mean a bigger-size gizmo on it? I already been through the Errol Flynn, the Primo Camera, and the King Kong .\" These were technical slang for various models of robot dildo. What a fantastic piece of hot lustful woma n she was, Frank thought ir relevantly. Despite his scie ntific attitude, he felt himself secretly longing fo r the moments ahead when the sheet would finally be swept aside to reveal that incredible body, which had appeared in his dreams twice over the weekend. With an effort, he resumed his professional manner. \"No,\" he said quietly. \"No larger sizes. The King Kong is the bi ggest we have in stock. Today is something entirely new. We are using the real thing-but still att ached to the ACE machine, so you can co ntrol it as always, calibrating speed and depth of thrust and so forth to your own special requirements. Ah, here it comes now.\" A technician wheeled in the new improved ACE apparatus. Rhoda sat up, staring in frank astonishment-and the sheet slipped another inch, revealing that gorgeous right nipple, like a chocolate gumdrop, Frank thought. Not for the first time, he curs ed the professional ethics which would ruin his career if he ever touched one of his experimental subjects. The technician, who always insisted on being called \"Jonesy\" or \"R.N.\"-his real name was Richard Nixon Jones, but he kept that a careful secret, and never sent Moth er's Day cards-wheeled the ACE over to th e bed and affixed it at the proper angle. It looked like a science-fiction version of the Great God Baphom et. The pink phallus seemed ex tra-erotic amid the sculpted white plastic of the machine, dangling a fe w inches above the Venusian bush sligh tly visible through the thin white sheet. \"All set,\" Jonesy said stiffly, and retreated to the door. He had never quite gotten over his initial embarrassment at working for Orgasm Research. Rhoda Chief reached out a tentative hand and felt Ulysses ho vering above her midsection. There was a pause. Dashwood watched her hand moving along the pink shaft. In imagination he vividly felt the same hand groping with his trousers. I am a professional, he reminded himself sternly. \"Well,\" he said, \"anytime you're ready.\" \"It's for science,\" Rhoda said hoarsely. \"That's right. For science.\" \"Take the sheet off me,\" she whispered. \"I can't do that,\" Frank said, strain ing to avoid a break in his voice, hi s eyes on the crotch beneath the sheets. \"Oh, yes,\" she said. \"I forgot.\" There was another pause. \"For science,\" he said gently. \"For science,\" she agreed. Slowly she pushed down the sheet, re vealing those globes that had twice tormented his sleep. She must be at least a forty-two, he thought, and who ever saw su ch enormous nipples before? Then, with more determination, she pushed the rest of the sheet off the bed in one qu ick motion. She was as sweet a sight as dawn itself. 77 / 233"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Dr. Dashwood thought fleetingly of how Fo urier series combine to produce, on o ccasion, perfect sine waves, valley and crest, valley and crest, in a harmony th at was like the signature of intelligen ce and grace. A contemporary pop novelist might say, \"She had a figure that would make the Pope kick a hole in a stained-glass window.\" Rhoda Chief, one of the trillions of multicellular bioesthetic models worked out by the DNA during its three and a half billion years' design work on this planet, was only five feet two inches tall, but in that space were the breasts of Babylonian goddesses, the trim waist of a Petty Girl, the pubic bush that Titian strove so hard to paint, the legs of Venus Kallipygios. Dr. Dashwood, who sought always to uncover significant form (and did not know that Clive Bell had once defined art in those two words), responded both cortically and phallically. Were it not for his scientific di scipline, he would have knelt in worship, to present her the Pentecostal Gift of Tongues. \"Um you can use it on the clitoris first, gently, to lubricate yourself,\" he said, feeling like a ninny. \"I'm lubricated already,\" Rhoda said in a strangled voice, and moved the handle which spun the wheel which thrust Ulysses into the house where love lived. Her eyes, Frank noted, were st ill open for a second, but completely out of focus. Then she closed them and began pulling the handle rhythmically. Frank began jotting rapidly. \"Nipples fully erect at twenty-thr ee seconds. Sex-flush on breasts and neck at thirty seconds. Subject says 'Jesus' quite clear ly at thirty-six seconds ...\" Ulysses, as the scientist was writing, wa s creating a neurological uproar in Ms. Rhoda Chief, the mammalian study unit in the first robot-mammal sexual dyad. As the rejected stone in Wild eblood's cathedral became th e cornerstone in Rhoda's consciousness, she felt as if she were floating and allowed he r left hand to run down her body, over her breasts, down over her belly into the garden of Nuit. Rhythmically, in time with th e hot, fast thrusting motion of the shaft of Priapus, she rubbe d her bush, while the other hand slowly in creased the thrusting motion . In her mind's eye she wa s simultaneously enjoying a second penis, in her mouth. Not all witche s are cocksuckers, but all cocksuckers are witches (whether they know it or not); Rhoda knew it. Her reputation for \"eating Peter like no chick si nce Cleopatra\" was not unconnect ed with the versatility of her singing and other personality traits. Then ACE was talking, in the gentle, slightly Gay tones of HAL, the whacked-out computer in 2001: \"To the center of the galaxy,\" he wa s saying. \"This is the center of space- time, and it is also the center of your womb, darling Rhoda.\" His soft purr went on, as he thrust d eeper into her. \"It is way, way out and it is also way, way in. You can only enter this mystery on vi bes of sheer ecstasy, because all matter at a lower vibratory rate gets destroyed in the Black Hole. So, in order to navigate this dangerous cr ossing, I must fuck you even more deeply, my darling.\" \"Oh, do it, ACE, do it to me good,\" she murmur ed. \"I want to see the center of the galaxy.\" \"There, there,\" he purred, \"you'll see the center of the galaxy when your pretty little cunt gets hot enough.\" \"Take me,\" she moaned, \"take me to the center of space-time.\" And deep , deep into the cosmic vaginal barrel and deep, deep into the spiral of her moist galaxy, ACE piloted her. Sl ow permutations, like the growth of crystals, her sensations were hardly contaminated any longer by thought or vision; deep, deep they went , down into a cavern of strange floral energies, each petal shape tingling with th e languid joy-dance in the petals of he r own warm pussy (happiness is a warm pussy, she remembered), the shaf t of the actual ACE machine digging deeper and deeper into the starry dynamo. \"Oh, ACE, oh, ACE, you fuck so divinely,\" she gasped. \"It's the only way to travel ,\" he crooned electronically. \"Oh, keep fucking me.

Squeeze was an oil millionaire famous for such monumental parsimonies as installin g pay phones in his mansion so guests couldn't run up his phone bill and bringing his lunch to th e office in a paper bag for forty years. He was being quizzed about his generous contributions to seven out often of the senators on the committee investigating him. \"Now, I resent that,\" Rockwell was saying. \"That's a very nasty word, Senator. 'Bribe,' indeed!\" \"Well, just what would you call it?\" asked the senator- one of the th ree who hadn't received Rockwell's largesse. \"I regard it this way,\" Mr. Squeeze said unctuously. \"If I had a lo t of cheese, and I looked around and saw a lot of mice without any cheese of their own, well, it would be the normal, generous thing ...\" \"Now, wait a minute, I smell a rat,\" the senator interrupted. \"Shee-it,\" Pearson said again. The door buzzer was humming. When Pearson opened the door he was greeted by a whiff of violets, even before he saw the man pointing the water pistol at him. And when he awoke (a day later, and with Rockwell Squeeze approved by the committ ee with a vote that stood- coincidentally, no doubt-at 7 to 3), he was in a basement surrounded by men with canvas bags over their heads.

Bridge living in a flophouse in Miami's ghetto. Having learned something from Naval Intelligence's bungling in the cases of Hassan i Sabbah X and R obert Pearson, they moved in with great delicacy; a black agent was employed to form a friendship with him over a period of a month. \"Weird cat,\" the agent reported after a week. \"Seems to be hiding something all the time. ...\" \"Can't make him at all,\" he reported the second week. \"If I didn't know better, I'd say he was a white reporter in blackface, trying to find out what it's like to be black. ...\" In fact, Bridge seemed more than a little bit psychotic in a methodical sort of way. He read no less than six newspapers a day and clipped numerous stories from th em. The agent eventually had a chance to investigate these files while Bridge was visiting a patient in a nearby madhouse, and they were ra ther oblique. They all concerned Very Important Persons in government and industry, but that was about all they had in common. Bridge seemed to have a minute curios ity about the men who rule America; that was all that wa s evident. The agent could make nothing at all of the crazy notes scribbled on the margins of these news stories: \"Possible,\" \"Proba ble,\" \"Still himself,\" \"Definitely occupied\" . . . The mystery grew worse when the agent rea lized that Bridge spent a lot of time visiting madhouses and psychiatric wards. \"Sure knows a lot of crazy people,\" he repo rted the third week. \"A hell of a lot of crazy people,\" he amended at the end of the month. Another team of agents began revisiting the nuthouses, and it was soon realized that the patients Bridge visited had a few things in common, viz., none was white, but not all were black (some were Oriental, Indian, or Chi-cano); all, without exception, were diagnosed as paranoid schizophreni c with delusions of grandeur; all were listed as chronic rather than acute psychotics; all claimed to be somebody else rather than who they actually were-one said he was Secretary of Commerce, one that he was Chairman of the Board of Morgan Guaranty Trust, one that he wa s Chief Engineer at Cape Kennedy, etc. The agents remembered their experience wi th Robert Pearson, former aide to Hassan i Sabbah X, and jumped to a conclusion. \"That crazy church drove them all nuts and made them think they were white people.\" Alas, a little checking refuted this easy assumption. Most of the loonies Bridge had visited had no previous connection with the Cult of the Black Mother at all. . . . Things were coming to a head.

The moon was full, the Gentry were active, the howl of the wind was as mournful as a 1950s poem. Markoff Chaney, unable to sleep, sat up in his YMCA bed and hatched mischief. Through leaflets nailed on walls around Orange County, he had managed to create a Committee to Nuke the Whales, something that appealed to a lot of rich-wingers purely an d simply on the grounds that it would make the eco-nuts and liberals scream. The Committee was an outs tanding success; after only a year it had forty-two members. This was enough, together with such an outrageous cause, to get maximum media attention-Chaney was aware th at anything, however small, can get the eye of the media if it's repulsive enough-and the eco-nuts and liberals were screaming. Good; but now for something equally abominable on the other side. Chaney contemplated the Radical Lesbians wistfully. He felt like Voltaire contemplating God; if the Radical Lesbians hadn't existed, he would have had to invent them. But what could he offer along those lines to balance the Committee to Nuke the Whales? The Child Molest-ers' Liberatio n Front?

Chaney was awake most of the night planning a campaign to bring quantum wobble into Dashwood's charts and graphs.

They were very clever primates-e xcellent at mimicry and even capab le of creative thinking at times. They never would have escaped from their planet and the boom-and-bust cycles of a ll life-forms adapted to planetside living if it hadn't been for the H.E.A.D. Revolution. HEAD means Hedonic Engineering and Devel opment. It consists of learning to use the primate brain for fun and profit. At the time of our story the HEAD Revolution, after an und erground existence of many centu ries, included only about 2 percent of the domesticated primates on Terra. The rest of th e domesticated primates were still using their brains for misery and failure. They did not know they were misusing their brains. They thought there was something wrong with the universe. They called it the Problem of Evil. Experts on the Problem of Evil were known as theologians. Th ese were very erudite primates, skilled in primate logic, who wrote long books trying to answer the questi on \"Why did God create an imperfect universe?\" \"God\" was their name for the hypothetical biggest-alpha-mal e-of-all. Being primates, they could not comprehend how anything could run if there weren't an alpha male in charge of it. They assumed the universe was imperfect b ecause it was obviously not set up for th e convenience of dome sticated primates. The universe was not even desi gned for the convenience and co mfort of the six-legged majority on Terra. The convenience and comfort of planetside sp ecies has very little to do with the cosmic drama. A few of the primates had reali zed this. They were known as cynics. Cynics were primates who rea lized the monotonous life-death cy cle of terrestrial life, but were not imaginative enough to conceive of future evolution after longev ity and escape velocity had been attained. Planetary life is cyclical because pl anets themselves follow cyclical or bits about their mo ther stars. (See Galactic E ncyclopedia, \"Larvel Stages of Sp ecies Development.\") The six-legged majority on Terra, for instan ce, followed a life script of four or more stages. In general, the pattern was: (1) the embryonic or egg form; (2) the larval period; (3) the pupal or chry salis stage; (4) the adult in sect. During each stage the biot or biological unit-the so-called individual-passed throug h a metamorphosis during which it was totally or partially transformed. The same was true of the domesticated prim ates. Most of them passed through, and kept neurologi cal circuits characteristic of, the following four stages: (1) imprinting and using the se lf-nourishing networks of the primate brain-the neonate or infant stage (oral biosurvival consciousness); (2) imprinting and using the emotional-territorial networks of the primate brain-the \"toddler\" stage (anal status consci ousness); (3) imprinting and using the semantic circuits-the verbal or conceptual stage (symbolic rational consciousness); (4) imprinting and usin g the socio-sexual circuits-the mating or parenting stage (tribal taboo consciousness).

According to his usual procedure, he breathed deeply, relaxed every muscle, and gradually forced all verbalization in his brain to stop. When he had reached the Void he waited to s ee what would float up to fill the vacuum. What surfaced was: Pretty little birdies Picking in the turdies *Terran Archives 2803: New York was a city-state or island in the midwestem part of the Unistat. It seems to have been a center of religious worship, and many came there to walk about, probably in deep meditation, within an enormous female statue, the goddess of these primitives. Vario us authorities identify this divinity as Columbia, Marilyn Monroe, Liberty, or Mother Fucker-all of these being names widely recorded in Unistat glyphs: Perhaps her true name will never be known. Benny felt a rush of nostalgia. The jingle had been popular in Brooklyn when he was a schoolboy in the antediluvian era of the 1930s. Back then, in the Da rk Ages of Roosevelt II, many Brooklyn peddler s still had horse-drawn carts, and the horses, as is common with their species, left piles of horse shit in th e streets as they went about th eir itineraries. Sparrows would peck in these steaming piles of dung for undigested oats, and a Brooklyn child would exclaim, on seeing this: \"Pretty little birdies Picking in the turdies!\" To which another child would usually reply: \"He's a poet Though his looks don't show it!\" Benny reflected that this little bit of kidlore had stuck in his memory for nearly half a century and that it must therefore contain some profound Meaning. He began pounding the Mac Plus , offering the birdie-turdie poemlet as a perfect example of an American haiku- the juxtaposition of two images, without comment by the author, in a way that suggested far more than it actually said. \"Birds,\" Benny wrote, \"are traditional symbols of beauty, from Bacon's nightingales to Keats's skylark, throughout our whole poetic tradition. Horse manure, on the other hand, is regarded with revulsion and loathing. Yet the sparrows, indifferent to human standards, blithely pick in the manure, seek ing the food they know is there. The poem is telling us that human likes and dislikes are ar bitrary, squinty-eyed, chauvinistic, and irrelevant to nature's own grand design strategy.\" Benny went on to assert that he had only been able to see this profundity in the jingle now, after he had spent six months meditating at the Manhattan Zen Center. \"This r hyme is the Essence of Zen,\" he concluded. It was probably the least succes sful column Benny ever wrote. Virtually nobody u nderstood it and ever ybody was bored by it. Some readers even wrote protesting letters complain ing that the column had b een in questionable taste. Benny was depressed by this reaction. He felt it had been a stro ke of genius on his part to rescue from oblivion a genuine American haiku; but even more than that, writing the column had tr iggered a vast stream of recollections about 1930s Brooklyn which gave him a renewed sense of Roots he had hope d to share. Why, how many st ill alive could remember the procedure when the meter man from Monopolated Edison appeared in a Brooklyn neighborhood in those days? The kids were dispatched as runners, racing from house to house, shouting \"Mon Ed! Mon Ed!\" Everybody would then remove the bags of salt which they kept over the electric meters to defl ect the readings down ward and thereby lowe r the electric bill. It seemed like only yesterday that Benn y himself had raced from house to house shouting, \"Mon Ed! Mo n Ed!\" And people had rushed to move the bags of salt to closets where the meter man wouldn't see them. Benny hadn't thought of those days in more than four decades, yet they lived on in Memory Storage and could be activat ed again by something as simple as the j ingle about the pretty little birdies. And Benny's whole att itude toward Mon Edison had been shaped by those experiences; he still regarded the \"public\" utility with a mixture of fear and loathing. 89 / 233"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"As a student of Zen, Benny knew that such negative emotions were bad for the nervous system and he often tried to regard Mon Ed without bias. It was impossible. He had learned to forgive Hitler, Stalin, even Nixon, but Mon Edison was still so charged with emotion that he could not think of it without his blood pressure rising. Besides, they had just raised their rates again in October. At the memory of that, Benny's Zen cr umbled entirely. \"Public utilities are a monopolist's heaven and a consumer's hell,\" he growled, knowing he was not yet a Buddha. But then he cheered up as another bit of 1930s kidlore came back to him. It was a si lly ritual, really, but it used to keep the m amused, even hilarious, back in sixth grade. It would begin with somebody asking, \"Who shit in the sink?\" \"You shit!\" another would reply. \"Bullshit,\" the first would riposte. \"Who shit?\" a third would then ask. \"Frank shit,\" somebody would answer. \"Bullshit,\" Frank would object. \"Who shit?\" \"Joe shit,\" Frank would say, getting Joe into the game. \"Bullshit,\" Joe would pay promptly. And so it would go: \"Who shit?\" \"Pete shit.\" \"Bullshit!\" \"Who shit?\" \"Jerry shit.\" \"Bullshit!\" . . . And on, and on, until everybody was bored-which among schoolboys might take quite a long time. Benny was so overwhelmed with nostalgia that he decided to go visit his mother at the Brooklyn Senior Citizens' Home, even though the old lady had been a bit neurotic ever since she was knocked on he r ass by a pursesnatc her three years ago on July 23, 1981. AMERICAN HAIKU The only one in New York who real ly grokked Benny Benedict's column about the pretty little birdies was Jus-tin Case, a mild, fortyish man who looke d Gay but wasn't. Case wrote excruciatingly intelligent music criticism. Since he read about this example of American folk haiku while very, very, very stoned on Columbian Gold, he immediately c onceived that it would be even more folkish and beautiful if recited with an old, Dark Age Brooklyn accent, viz: \"Pretty little boidies Picking in the toidies!\" He was so enamored of this that he quoted it, whenever he was drunk or stoned, for several months. The whole winter-spring season of 1983-84, if you mingled with the intelligentsia in Manhattan, you were likely to hear Case decl aiming, in a style based partly on Orson Welles and partly on Charles Laughton, \"Pretty little boidies/Pickm g in the toidies!\" This finally f ound its way into Ca se's NBI file- \"Sub j ect is inclined to q uotin g obscene p oetr y in mixed com p an y \"-and was even fed to the Beast. 90 / 233"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The NBI had a file on Case because one of their info rmants had stated that he was a frequent associate of Blake Williams. In fact, Case detested Williams and only was seen in his presence because it was impossible to go to the best parties on the Isle of Manhattan without encoun tering him. Oddly enough, the informant knew that quite well-but she also knew that her fees depended on the number of new suspects she reported each month. Case's NBI dossier remained always small. As a Congressional Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, he was not the sort of man the Bureau cared to spy on too closely, since it would be embarrassing if they were caught. Besides, they couldn't make head or tails out of his phone conve rsations, which were all about such inscrutable matters as whether Beethove n's obsession with his nephe w represented repressed p aternal impulses, latent homosexuality, or the desire to be a mother, and whether all three elements were expressed in the tonic chord of the bassoon under the dominant chord of the tutti in the opening of the Ninth. Justin Case's god was a dead Irishman named Ja mes Augustine Aloysius Joyce, who had been the greatest tenor of the twentieth century. Case owned every record of every Joyce concert preserved on wax, and regarded the man as having the most subt le musical sensibility since the great Ludwig himself. If only he had been a composer instead of a singer, Case sometimes thought, with that ear . . . Actually, Joyce had considered the priesthood, writing, and even medicine before settling on a musical career. His voice thrilled audiences in Europe and Am erica for nearly a decade before the famous Joyce Scandal, which destroyed him. Case always fumed wi th anger when he read of the great singer's last days-how concerts were disrupted and ruined by moralistic hecklers howling \"Garters garters garters!\" till the shamed man left the stage, humiliate d. It was known that he died of drink, often comparing himself to Oscar Wilde and Charle s Stewart Parnell, and cursing the Christian churches bitterly. Case once had an affair with the anthropologist and sexologist Marilyn Chambers, just because she shared his passion for Joyce's music. Due to the rece ptivity of the postcoital male, he had even allowed her to explain the parallel universe theory to him once-something he always di smissed as rubbish when Blake Williams talked about it. \"You mean,\" he asked, \"that in another universe J oyce's thing about girls' undergarments might never have been discovered and his care er wouldn't have been ruined?\" \"Even more,\" Dr. Chambers said. \"If Wheeler's interpre tation of the state vector is true, there must be such a universe. Also, a universe where Joyce did become a priest instead of a singer.\" \"Far fucking out,\" Case said. \"I wonder what you'd be in the universe next door ...\" NO WIFE, NO HORSE, NO MUSTACHE What is certain is that in countries like Bulgaria , where people live on- polen ta, yogurt, and other such foods, men live to a greater age than in our parts of the world. -furbish lousewart V, Unsafe Wherever You Go Justin Case heard about the man with no wife, no horse, and no mustache at one of Mary Margaret Wildeblood's wild, wild parties.

There was a lot of booze, a lot of weed, and-due to Marvin Gardens- altogether too much coke. Basically, Joe Malik said, his encounter with th e man who had no wife, no horse, and no mustache had been part of an experiment in neurometaprogra mming.

At that point, unfortunately, Case dozed off in hi s chair (one joint of Colombian too many) and he never did find out about the man with no wife, no horse, and no mustache. When he woke up most of the guests had left and Mary Margaret was telli ng Dr. Dashwood about the burglars who had ransacked her ap artment last week. \"The worst part of it,\" she wa s saying, \"was that they even took Ulysses.\" \"Oh, were you very fond of him?\" Dashwood asked. He obviously thought she was talking about a dog or cat. Mary Margaret tittered, aware of the misunders tanding. \"Ulysses was part of me,\" she said. Case got to his feet and made his polite adieus. He couldn't stand any more ambiguity in one evening. Ulysses was actually Mary Margaret Wildeblood's pe nis, which was now in Dash wood's laboratory-a fact which neither of them realized. Mary Margaret was not a born woman (which was commonplace, si nce 51 percent of the Terran p rimates qualified for it), but a manufactured woman. This was something new and exotic. It had only been possible on that primitive planet for around forty years. Epicene Wildeblood, Mary Margaret's former self, had been the bitchiest literary critic in Manhattan, the man that writers love to hate . His aphorisms were known and quoted everywhere in the world that was important by his own standards- i.e., from St. Mark's Place to 110th Street (East). Each Wildebloodism was a pearl of wit and a poison dart of malice: \"Norman's mail er-than-thou-attitude,\" \"Either McLuhan has had a divine vision or he is me rely incoherent, and it is obvious that he has not had a divine vision,\" \"llluminatus is just two nursery Nietzsches daydreaming about a psychedelic Superman,\" \"Nixon's memoirs will never be placed beside Casanova 's in the annals of amusing rascality, but they may well stand beside Mussolini's play about Napoleon in the archives of stentorian dullness.\" Wildeblood had named his penis Ulysses way back in Gilgamesh Junior High School in Babylon, Long Island, where he grew up. He named it Ulysses because it had Greek procliviti es and a tendency to invade dark, forbidden places. Wildeblood was by no means a simple or uncompli cated WoMan. The sex-change operation had been only stage one in a plan to totally transform hi mself. After that, she intended to become a nun. By 1983 it was a sane and sensible decision for one li ving at the hot center of New York intellectual life. Like the Southerners who think \"d amn Yankee\" is one word, Wildeblood's milieu had long ago forgotten that \"male chauvinist\" was two words. Th e slightest, kinkiest remnant of masculinity was a definite handicap, a sugge stion of possible viciousness-like me mbership in the John Birch Society, owning a Mississippi accent, or a conviction for a major felony. Besides, Wildeblood did urgently want to be a nun. A priest or even a monk had a certain arrogance in his very role qua priest or qua monk, however passionately he might cultivate Total Submission to the Will of God. Only a nun could experien ce the true endlessness of humility. Wildeblood, simply, was tired of being the bitchies t male in Manhattan. He wanted to become the saintliest woman. 94 / 233"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"FOREVER Joe Malik, the editor of Confrontation magazine, published Justin Case's music criticism only because it confused (and, therefore, amused) him. Like most of his readers, Joe couldn't make head or tail out of whatever it was that Case was trying to say; but, unlike the readers- who were perpetua lly writing letters protesting Case's baroque inscrutability-Joe enjoyed puzzles. Joe was a chess puzzle and logical p aradox addict; like William S. Burroughs, he was pe rpetually poring over the Mayan codices, trying to unscrew those inscrutable glyphs for wh ich no Rosetta Stone has yet been found. Three years earlier, in 1981, Joe had been a white-ha ired man who clearly showed his sixty-odd years. N ow, in 1983, he had jet- b lack hair again, a face free of wrinkles , and could easily pass for a man in his early forties. This was because he had started using the rejuvena tion-longevity drug FOREVER as soon as it appeared on the market. Fundamentalist Ch ristians and the People 's Ecology Party (PEP) denounced FOREVER as blas phemous and against God' s will-\"the ultimate in sanity of the rational- technological mind,\" it had been ca lled by Furbish Lousewart V, who al most defeated Hubbard in the 1980 election. Joe despised religionists and ecol ogists and went on using FOREVER. Dissident scientists began reporting disastrous side effects of FOREVER when they gave it in horse-doctor's doses to laboratory mice; Joe remembered the simi lar antimarijuana research of the sixties and seventies and went on using FOREVER, gambling that if there were anything wrong with it, it wouldn't kill him before a better reju venation drug was on the market. Joe hoped to be around for several hundred years and take advantage of Time Trav el when it arrived to make Eternity accessible to mankind. Above his desk at Confrontation was a motto from the English biologist J. B. S. Haldane which succinctly su mmarized Joe's view of the cosmos. It said: THE UNIVERSE MAY BE NOT ONLY QUEERER THAN WE THINK BUT QUEERER THAN WE CAN THINK. ALIEN SIGNALS Carol Christmas, an aspiring actress who had not yet achieved better than Off-Off-Broadway, was always a bit sensitive about her second source of income, so she heard Joe Malik saying \"no wife, no whores, no mustache.\" Oddly enough, Blake Willia ms, who was picking up parts of several conversations during his own interstellar rap, al so thought Malik was saying \"no wife, no whores, no mustache.\" Williams and Carol Christmas both heard Malik's explanati on through the semantic carousel around them something like this: MALIK: Premarital sex, mind you. I was really terrified about the whole younger generation careening to hell in a handbasket with lUD's and c ondoms sprinkling on all si des. I began to see Commie threats everywhere.

But at this point Williams realized that he would never recapture the audience previously listening to his outer-space theories, and he also wanted some air.

No whores? No mustache? \"WHO SHIT???\" Benny Benedict was yelling inside. The actual title of the Reader's Digest article had been \"No Wife, No Horse, No Mustache,\" not \"No Wife, No Whores, No Mustache.\" Joe Malik, as he had been trying to explain amid the din of the Wildeblood soiree, had been engaged in neuroprogramming rese arch, trying to become one with the R eader s Digest, when he found that wonderful title, wh ich led him to immediately abort the experiment. He knew, intuitively, that the mystery of a title like that was much better than the solution, the explanation of the title, could ever be.

It had been a witless suggestion. \"They couldn't have,\" Ubu repeated, as if she had confirmed his judgment. \"We can rule that out.\" Sylvia Goldfarb waited. There was something om inous in her waiting. Ubu cleared his throat. \"I'll put five men on it right away,\" he said.

He was thinking: This is going to be a pisscutter. One of President Hubbard's first acts on assuming offi ce had been to abolish the FBI-thereby throwing Roy Ubu out of work. \"The American people survived one hundred fifty y ears without secret poli ce opening their mail and tapping their phones,\" Hubbard said. \"They can survive without it again.\" Most of Ubu's colleagues fled Washington, seeki ng employment in police departments and private detective agencies. Roy had stuck around, shrewdly convinced that he understood government better than Hubbard. Within a month he was hired by th e newly formed National Bureau of Information. The ostensible purpose of the NBI was to collect data for the Beast-GWB-666, the computer that had virtually become a fourth branch of government, si nce its memory was searched before any important decision was made. Actually, since bureaucracies have learned, like other gene pools, to survive over aeons, the NBI replaced many of the functions of the FBI. This was so intricately concealed in the budget figures that neither Hubbard nor any of her close advisors ever found it. (Bureaucracies do not die when terminated; they change names: Gilhooley's First F undamental Finding.) Still, there was an important diffe rence. Since Hubbard had abolishe d prisons, the only citizens who had anything to fear from government were thos e increasingly rare, bizarre ly imprinted biots who committed violence against others, a nd they were only sent to Hell.

It was Dr. Harriet Hopgood, aware that the boss was bored by the political discussion. Three-A was part of the code-the research subjects were never mentioned by name in any conversation-and it de signated the young lady in laboratory Three, Ms. Rhoda Chief. \"Very impressive,\" Dr. Dashwood sa id. \"She had reached twenty-three when I broke for lunch, and she was still going strong.

WASHY N OVEMBER 30, 1983 The NBI had assembled a complete dossier on the missing George Washington Carver Bridge, the first scientist to disappear after leaving government employ. Ubu had all the facts about Dr. Bridge that had ever been recorded. He knew that Bridge had been born June 16, 1953, in Bad Ass, Texas, and weighed nine pounds, three ounces at the time. He knew that Bridge's Social Security Number was 121-23-1723, his GWB number 345-36-5693, and his sexual penchant was for light-skinned Black or Oriental women with college degrees who would wear black lace bras while he pronged them. He knew that Bridge had a B.A. from Miskatonic University in Black Studies , an M.S. from the same source in Sociobiology, and a Ph.D. from the University of Ingolstadt in Primatology. He knew that Bridge had been baptized three ti mes-once at the age of two week s, by the Afro-Methodists via total submersion, again at the age of fourteen by the Roman Catholics by wetting the brow, and a third time at the age of seventeen by the Ku Klux Klan with a pail of cow piss. He knew that Dr. Bridge had left Bad Ass one month later and never returned. He knew that Dr. Bridge ha d studied or worked in Arkham, Massachusetts, New York City, Los Angeles, Ingolstadt, Bavaria, the Transylvanian sectio n of Hungary, Washington, D.C., and Berkeley. He knew that Dr. Bridge was called \" Washy\" by his classmates at Miskatonic. He knew several thousand similar things, none of them he lpful in any way toward explaining why Dr. Bridge had disappeared off the face of the earth at the head of a parade of similar disappearees whic h now numbered 167. \"I knew this case would be a pisscutter,\" Ubu said, contemplating his data. The one fact not recorded about Dr. Bridge, and the whole key to his subsequent behavior, was the fact that he had, on N ovember 23, 1971, looked into the infamous Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred, in the Germ an translation of Von Junzt (Das Verichteraraberbuch, Ingolstadt, 1848). Bridge, not Dr. Bridge then, but just Washy, had been turned on to his odd volume by the Miskatonic librarian, Doris Horus, who knew he took his Black Studies seriously. There was one sentence in Das Verichteraraberbuch that turned everything around in Dr. Bridge's head. The sentence was: Gestorben ist nicht, was für ewig ruht, und mit unbekannten Aonen mag sogar der Tod noch sterben.

The motion was so radical that it took over five years to get it into print, in Physics Today, in 1973. Professor O'Neill had simply asked his students a rather basi c question-one which occurs inevitably on every planet which evolves beyond the boom-and-bust cycle of planetside life. O'Neill asked: I s the surface of a planet the right place for an expanding technological civilization? Once the question had been asked, the corr ect answer was, of course, inescapable. Among the symptoms indicating that Closed System planetary industry would have to be transformed into Open System planetary-and-extraplanetary industry were the following: Rapid exhaustion of the fossil fuels on Terra, leading to a de sperate search for new energy sources; The virtually limitless solar energy in space; Rising population and increasing longevity, leading to an inevitable new period of swarming; Growing pollution and ecological imbalan ce, caused by the atte mpt to provide energy from terrestrial sources for this increasing primate population; The Revolution of Rising Expectations-a sociological phenomenon brought on by the scientific-technological advances of the previous two centuries-which caused the majority of primates to claim they had the right to a decent standard of living; The failure of the Revolution of Lowered Expectations, after th e smarter primates realized th at lowered expectations meant starvation for the majo rity of the planet; The Hunger Project started by a circuit-five primate named Erhard, who encour aged people to believe starvation could be eliminated; The continuous influence of a circuit-six primate named R. Buckminster (\"Bucky\") Fuller, wh o insisted the primate brain was designed \"for tota l success in Universe\"; And, finally, the debacle of terrestrial-based nuclear energy plants, which continually caused havoc in their environments, and which eventually prompted some of the primates to rememb er that a science-fiction writ er, Robert Anson Heinlein, had foreseen all this in a 1940s story, \"B low-ups Happen,\" and provided the solution - moving the nuclear plants into space. By 1984 over a third of Terra's industrial plants had been move d, as O'Neill foresaw, into the L5 area-Legrange point 5, where the gravity fields of earth and m oon are balanced. The colonists even had a theme song, invented by another science- fiction writer, Robert Anson Wilson, in a book called The Universe Next Door. The song was \"HOMEs on Legrange.\" A VISITOR FROM FAIRY LAND \"Participation\" is the incontrovertible new concept given by qu antum mechanics; it strikes do wn the term \"observer\" of classical theory, the man who stands safely behind a thick glass wall and watches what goes on without taking part.

Was he offering a chance to cross the boundary into magic space and we re they all too timid to try? \"You see, son, Rosenfelt and the Rhodes sc holars have it all sliced up and they have to get rid of people like me. ...\" Tom Crane was still rambling along his own paranoid yellow-brick road when they finally cam e abreast of the Tramp. Hugh listened eagerly to catch the Mystery Question. \"Hey mister could you spare a dime I haven't eaten in three days mister hey listen mister . . .\" \"Get a job,\" said old Crane, wa lking faster. \"You see, son, that's the kind of good-for-nothing loafer who's destroying this country.\" But the boy who was to become Cagliostro the Escape Artist looked back and saw the Myst erious Tramp falling to the ground very slowly like a tree he had seen fall slowly after being ch opped by the caretaker at the Crane country home out on Long Island, and just like the tree, when he finally reached the sidewalk, the Tram p didn't move at all, not one bit, and even seemed to get stiff like th e tree did, only faster. SPOCK? SPOCK? SPOCK? D ECEMBER 23, 1983 While Dr. Dashwood was worrying about the sinister Ezra Pound in San Francisco and Ma ry Margaret Wilde-blood was preparing for her party in New York, a black giant named \"Rosey\" Stuart was st ruggling with a vacat ion memo in the P ussycat office in Chicago. \"This is the worst piece of idiocy I've ever seen,\" he complained to his secretary. \"It looks like it was written by a computer having a nervous breakdown. Listen to this gibberish: 'Haifa man-day shall not be equal to half a day unless the man is actually in the office for the full day, or half of a full day, as the case may be. (Thi s also applies to female employees.)' What the ring-tailed rambling hell does that mean?\" \"Do you want me to call Personnel and ask somebody to expl ain it?\" asked the secretary, Marlene Murphy, a pert little redhead who could neither type nor take dicta tion well, but held her job because she fit the Pussycat image. \"Besides,\" Stuart went on gr umbling, \"it contradicts the v acation memo we got last week.\" \"That one was a hoax,\" Marlene explained pa tiently. \"Some crank got in at night and ran it off on a Xerox machine as some 102 / 233"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"kind of practical joke.\" \"Well, Jesus on a wubber cw utch,\" Stuart complained, imitating Elmer Fudd, \"it made more sense than this one.\" Marlene shrugged sympathetically. \"This is the one we've got to live with.\" Stuart shook his head wearily. \"What kind of world is it where the reality is weirder than the satire?\" There was no obvious answer to that. \"Do you wa nt me to call Personnel?\" Marlene repeated. \"Hell, no!\" Stuart exclaimed. \"D on't agitate that pit of ding-dongs. Just put me down for the first three weeks in July, and if they tell me I can't have it, I'll go over their heads and talk to Sput.\" Stan Sputnik was the founder of the Pussycat empire and still acted as both Managing Editor and Publisher, as well as embodying the Pussycat image in all his highly publicized acts and deeds. Stuart crumbled the v acation memo and threw it in the wastebasket. \"What's next?\" he asked. \"Dr. Dashwood. About the interview.\" \"Oh, yes,\" Stuart said, turning his chair to look ou t the window. \"Call his secr etary and see if he's in.\" While Marlene went outside to her desk to place the call, Stuart looked out over Chicago thinking of his rapid rise in the P ussycat empire. Born in Chicago's South Side ghetto-his full name was Franklin Delano Roosevelt Stuart-he had originally followed the usual predatory life-script of impoverished al pha males. But his second prison term had thrown him into contact with a most peculiar cell mate-a self-proclaimed Sufi and ma ster of all forms of Persian magick. \"Rosey\" Stuart came out of prison convinced he could do anything, acquired a degree in literature from Harvar d in record time, and started the Great Novel about the Bl ack Experience in America. About then both racism and poverty were becoming obsolete, and selling a first novel was as hard as ever. Stuart had been toiling at Pussycat for five years, dickering with a novel about a paralle l universe where racism still existed and a malignant black magician takes over the country by demonically possessing the body of the white President. Last year the staff of Pussycat had quadrupled. Sput Sputnik had grown a nnoyed by the ever-increasing number of imitations of his Illustrated Fantasy Book for Onanists. Every editor at every competition publication had been hired away at a juicy salary increase. P ussycat suddenly had six Senior Editors, twelve Associate Editors, tw enty-four Assistant Editors, and thirty Junior Editors. The other publishers found themselves confronting deadlines with nobody left on their staffs. Two went bankrupt; one committed suicide; the others took a year to get back in gear again. \"Business is business,\" said Sput. He liked to think of himself as a tough, hard-driving busine ssman, as well as the twentieth century's leading philosopher, the superstud of every girl's tend er dreams, the hero of the free press, the foe of bigotry and intolerance everywhere, and the world's unacknowledged Master Psychologist. If he had known there was such a thing as pie-eating champion, he would have aimed for that title also. He considered himself a Renaissance Man. Although Stuart had advanced from Junior Editor to Senior Edito r in spite of this competition, he hardly knew Sput at all. Sput never came to the offices, preferring to work in his mansion in Manhattan, and Stuart saw him only on the rare occasions when he was called upon to fly to New York for a conference. Those conferences tended to be a bit much. Like certain mo vie actors who are always \"on, \" even when nowhere near a soundstage, Sput was as determined to impress his editors as he was to overwhelm the whole world. For years, he had insisted on playing chess during conferen ces, keeping an impoverished grandmaster on hand for a stiff competition; since the grandmaster knew which side his br ead was buttered on, Sput always won. He had gotten this idea from a very inaccurate historical novel abou t Napoleon, in which the little Corsican sociopath was portraye d as playing masterful chess while discussing military strategy with his generals and the Napoleonic legal code with his judges. More recently Sput had read a nov el about Nero. The effect was even more disc oncerting than trying to talk with him while he laboriously evaded an obvi ous Noah's Ark trap. He was seated behind his desk receiving a blow job when Stuart had 103 / 233"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"been ushered into his presence the last time. It was unnerving. \"You wanted to discuss the interview subjects for the next six months?\" Stuart asked, taking his seat and noting that the erotic technician kneeling before the Great Man was a recent Pussyette from the mag's foldout. In fact, she was the first to appear, not in an ordinary cr otch shot (they were now beco ming commonplace, not only in Pussycat, but in its imitators), but in a randy low-angle crotch shot in which her vulva lips could clearly be seen pouting beneath the pubic hair. Stuart had b een curious as to how that effect was ob tained and asked the chief photographer, \"Were you rubbing her off just before you snapped that?\" \"Nah,\" was the laconic answer. \"W e tried that, but the lips still weren't visible enough. We ended up stuffing her snatch full of my hashish stash.\" \"Lawd!\" Stuart was astonished, and dropped back to his mother tongue. \"That's why she had that far-gone look in her eyes. Stoned out of her head by the time we got it all out of her again. Bet you didn't know it was possible to get high that way.\" \"Wonder what it would be like to navigate her geography right after the hash came out,\" Stuart said thoughtfully. \"Wouldn't know,\" the photographer sighed. \"Sput put an exclusive on her soon as he saw the test shots.\" N ow she kneeled, nude and covered with some kind of oil that Sput had read about in the Nero book, and carefully licked his wingwang up and down while he, imitating supercool, went over the interview list. \"Don't want President Hubbard,\" he said. \"She's too controversial.\" \"But dammit, Sput, our interviews are supposed to be controversial!\" Stuart seemed to recall saying that at each of these conferences. \"Not that controversial,\" Sput said. \"The intellectuals all ha te her because she's a scientist.* Now, here, Jane *Terran Archives 2803: At the time of this comedy those primates who specialized in ve rbal manipulations of the third neurological circuit formed a ge ne-pool separate from those who specialized in mathematical manipulations. The former, controlling the verbal environment, had dubbed t hemselves \"the intellectuals.\" Fonda and Timothy Leary, they're good. But, Jesus H. Ch rist, Robert Anson Wilson, for Chrissake-he's a fucking science- f iction writer! \" \"We interviewed Vonnegut,\" Stuart said, watching the lady's head bobbing up and down at Sput's crotch. \"Yeah, but his books are serious. That's different,\" Sput said, breathing a bit h eavily by now. \"Besid es, everybody says The Universe Next Door drives people wiggy and makes them become nudists or Buddhists or something. That kind of trouble we don't need. And one science-fi ction writer in five years is enough, already. (Gently, doll, gently!) I see you don't have th e Attorney General on the list yet.\" \"It's the same as ever,\" Stuart explained, noting that the girl's hand was sneaking down her belly into her crotch. \"She just won't give us an interview. She still says we're a dirty magazine.\" \"Dammit, we never go beyond contemporary community stan dards,\" Sput protested, hurt. \"That old bitch is a bigot.\" \"Well, bigot or not, she won't give us an interview.\" \"Fascist reactionary old bat,\" Sput fumed. \"S omeday I'll-\" Then he brightened. \"Listen, doll,\" he said to the girl at his feet. \"You're the Attorney General-now really go to it, like a fucking vacuum cleanerl\" The girl's head began bobbing faster, and Sput slouched back a bi t, smiling contentedly. \"Reactionary WASP bitch,\" he muttered. \"That's right, take it, take it all, you foe of the First Amendment!\" \"E r -Dr. Francis Dashwood,\" Stuart prompted. 104 / 233"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"\"Very good, very good.\" Sput was whispering, as if toking a marijuana cigarette. \"You Gestapo pig, \" he added to the girl at his feet. \"How about Jackie Kennedy Onassis?\" \"Yeah, yeah, class,\" Sput said vaguely. He was beginning to tremble a bit. \"Who else you got?\" he whispered, trembling more. \"Dr. Spock.\" \"Spock?\" Sput asked. Then he repeated , shrilly, \"Spock? Spock! SPOCK!???!\" He was coming, Stuart realized with an embarrassed twinge. \"Swallow it,\" Sput was roaring. \"Swallow it, you wire tapper!\" It was a distracting conference all ar ound, Stuart thought, remembering. His secretary was at his door. \"I finally located Dr. j Da shwood,\" she said, \"at this home. He's on the phone.\" j Stuart picked up his phone, saying, \"Ah, good afternoo n, Dr. Dashwood. It's a great pleasure to speak to you.\" \"Is this on the level?\" came a tense voice. \"You're not involved with that Poop or Foof place, are you?\" Stuart was dumbfounded. Could the head of the best-known sex research organization in America be a paranoid nut? \"I am speaking to Dr. Francis Dash wood?\" he asked carefully. \"Yes, yes-but how can I be sure who I'm speaking to?\" \"Well,\" Stuart said, \"if you have your doubts, call me back. Go through information, to check the number, and | then have the Pussycat switchboard put you on my line. That should convince you.\" \"I'll do just that,\" the doctor said. \"A lot of damned peculiar things are happening today. I want to be sure you're not some cohort of that Ezra Pound character.\" He hung up abruptly. Ezra Pound, Stuart thought, bemused. The doctor thinks a dead poet and folk singer is plotting against him. An absolute nut of the first water. A real signifyin' mad scientist. Obviously, this would require great care. Dashwood coul dn't just be discarded as an interview subject for being batty; he was too big a name. The interview would go ahead, but Dashwood would be handled with kid gloves. The phone buzzed, and he picked it up. \"Dr. Dashwood is back on th e line,\" his secretary said. \"Put him through.\" He waited, then said, \"Dr. Dashwood?\" \"Well, I guess it really is you,\" the vo ice said. \"Please excuse me. A man in my sensitive field-cranks and schizophrenics wondering around loose ...\" \"Yes, yes, I quite understand,\" Stuart said, rolling his eyes to ward the ceiling. \"Poets always have harbored nasty grudges.\" He had no doubt that the doctor was as goofy as a waltzing mouse. HOW THE TERRAN PRIMATES WERE DOMESTICATED 105 / 233"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"GALACTIC ARCHIVES: President Hubbard had abolished poverty thro ugh a plan which she called the RICH economy. RICH meaning Rising Income through Cybernetic Homeostasis. This was a diabolically clever sc heme to abolish all forms of hum an labor except the most creative- i.e., those frontal-lobe metaprogramming circuits which have evolved last in evolution and surpass the mechanical old four-circuit primate brain functions. Of course it had been theoretically possible to abolish most mechanical labor since about 1948, when a very cunning primate mathematician, Norbert Weiner, noted that self-correcting (cybernetic) machines would soon be able to monitor whole factories. Even earlier a metaprogramming-c ircuit Greek primate, Aristotle, had observed that it would be possible to abolish slavery \"when the loom and other mach ines become self-managing.\" Terran primates had continued slavery over the generations, despite the incr easing distress this caused their hominid third and fourth (semantic and moral) circuits, simply because machines could no t yet manage themselves. As many a primate Utopian had rediscovered in chagrin, under primitive planetar y conditions, \"somebody has to do the shit-work.\" The most appealing solution to electing that somebody was to invade a weaker neighboring tribe and bring back a group of biots who could be domesticated. This had been done so often that there was no hom inid pack on Terra that did not show the effects of domestication and slave mentality, a fact first noted by a dour Germ an primate named Nietzsche. In Unistat, due to the strong encouragement of individualistic third- and fourth-circuit (semantic-moral) functions, slavery had grown so repugnant that it was formally \"abolished\" with in a century after the formation of the pack constitution; it lingered on through inertia in the form of \"wage slavery,\" whic h required that all primates not born into the sixty families that \"owned\" almost everything would have to \"work\" for those families or their corporations in order to get the tickets (called \"money\") which were necessary for survival. This slave mentality was so entrenched in the domesticated primates that cybernation advanced very slowly in the first thirty years after Weiner discovered it wo uld be possible to abolish primate toil. All the important primate bands-the alpha male corporations, the primate trade unions, th e primate council or \"gover nment,\" the primate totem cults or \"churches\"-believed that the traditional domesticat ed caste system was the only possible system und er which primates could live. Even the Red primates shared this delusion, differing only in their ideas about distribution of resources. President Hubbard boldly challenged this domesticated primate thought-form by announcing that everybody who could be replaced by a machine would be replaced by a machine. It seemed like the end of the world to the primates, at first. It turned out to be only the end of poverty.

Markoff Chaney was about to have a dream come true. He was renting his old room at the YMCA on Chicago Avenue again, using it as a base for further anti-Dashwood activities. He had gone for a walk, and as he approached the intersection of Michigan and Lake Shore Drive, he was thinking about a new letterhead that would say FRATERNAL ORDER OF HATE GROUPS and have Robert Welch, Abby Hoffman, Anita Br yant, and George Wallace listed as officers. Perhaps he might add Natalie Drest and make her \"Chairperson of the Board.\" \"Hsst!\" a voice said. \"You-yeah, you, shorty.\" The midget stiffened and whirled around. \"Hssst!\" he said, \"You-yeah, you, asshole.\" \"Hey, no offense,\" the speaker said. \"I got a business proposition for you.\" The midget looked at him sharply; he didn't look at all as shady and unsavory as a person should look who wa s offering a business proposition on the corner to a total stranger. \"What are you selling?\" he asked. \"Not selling,\" the friend ly giant said. \"Giving away. One hundred fifty dollars.\" \"And what do I have to do for it?\" the midget asked warily, drawing a little closer. \"I'm a butler,\" the man said-and , in fact, he did not look like butlers the midget had seen in movies. His face was much longer from the nose down than most people's; it gave him a permanent look of one who smells something but hasn't found it yet. Most Chicagoans, Chaney had noticed, look like they'd just found it and it was worse than they'd imagined. \"The lady I work for is very rich. And very eccentric.\" He tried to leer suggestively; the effect was li ke a bishop winking. \"She has a thing about m---- . . . about you people of less than averag e stature.\" Markoff Chaney felt his heart leap. Could it be true?? \"One hundred fifty dollars?\" \"That's right. She gets these moods and sends me out looking every so often.\" \"I'm game,\" the midget said, deciding. He could feel the pulse in his temple. Au revoir, ma cherie, he thought, firmly convinced that was French for \"good-bye to virginity.\" \"There's just one thing,\" the butler said as they walked along. \"You've got to do just what I tell you.

Debunking Science There was nothing really weird about Blake Williams, except that he was passion ately in love with a dead man. This great, if somewhat bizarre, passion was entirely platonic, of course -nothing queer about good old Doc Williams, except his head. With his six-foot frame, his neatly trimmed gray beard, and his heavy black -rimmed spectacles, Williams was the very model of a modern major generalist. Due to the incident of th e Gansevoort Street incinerator, he had learned to keep his mouth shut about his more outlandish ideas and obsessions. The man Blake Williams loved was Niels Bohr, the physicist who had chosen the Taoist yin-yang as his Coat of Arms when knighted by the Danish co urt-which was rather far out back in the 1930s (before Taoism became fa ddish with physicists). Bohr also added nearly as much to quan tum theory as Planck, Einstein, or Schrödinger, and his model of the atom-the Bohr model, it's calle d - had been believed literally by a generation of physicians before Hiroshima. Bohr himself, however, had 109 / 233"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"never believed it; nor had he believed any of his other theories. Bohr invented what is called the Copenhagen Interpretation, which holds in effect that a physicist shouldn't believe anythi ng but his measurements in the laboratory. Everything else-the whole body of mathematics and theory re lating one measurement to another-Bohr regarded as a model of how the human mind works, not of how the universe work s. Blake Williams loved Bohr for the Copenhagen Interpretation, which had made it possible for him to study physics seriously, even devoutly, without believing a word of it. That was convenient, since Williams's own training as an anthropologist had schooled him to study all human symbol systems without believing any of them. On a deeper level-there is always a deeper level- Williams wa s a scientist who didn't believe in science because he had been cured of polio by witchcraft. But Blake Williams didn't believe in witchcraft, either. He didn't believe in anything. He regarded all belief systems as illustrative data in domesticated primate psychology. \"The study of human beliefs is an ethologist's heaven and a logician's hell,\" he liked to say. Actually, Blake Williams hadn't been cured of polio by witchcraft, exactly. He had been cured by the Sister Kenny method. But he grew up thinking it was witchcraft. That was because all the experts in Unistat at the time-the members of the American Medical Association, who would not admit there were any other ex perts on health-claim ed the Sister Kenny method was witchcraft. They also said it didn't work. Since the Sister Kenny method obviously ha d worked in his case, Blake grew up with the gnawing suspicion that the experts didn't know what the hell they were talking about. He was also intensely curious about all forms of witchcraft, which eventually led him to become an anthropologist. Young Williams soon enough discovered-on his very first field trip, among the Hopi Indians-that witchcraft does by God and by golly work, after all. He began, tentatively and secre tly, sharing his knowledge with carefully select ed colleagues. Most of them were pretty evasive ab out the whole subject, but Marilyn Chambers, the author of the epoch-making N euroanthropology, was star-tlingly blunt. \"Everybody who's been in the fi eld knows that,\" she said wi th a kind of weary patience. \"But why doesn't anyone say so?\" Williams asked, still young, still naive. \"Freud and Charcot once had virtually this same conversation,\" Dr . Chambers said, \"but the topi c then was the sexual origin of the hysterical neuroses of Victorian women. Charcot invited Freud to be the goat and talk about it in public. ...\" \"I see,\" Blake Williams said slowly. He did see.

He believed, or pretended to believe, that the ringleaders were all extrat errestrials who had arrived by flying saucer in 1968 and were boldly conspiring to seize su preme power everywhere through what he called semantic black magick. \"They've atomized the language and created a semantic smog in which ordinary humanity is obliterated by abstractions like 'chairperson' or simple mammalian erotic signaling is politicized into a new sin called 'sexism.' Any male who dares to oppose them is stigmatized as a 'male chauvinist,' and any female who opposes them is labeled a victim of male brainwashing. Obviously, within a decade, they will command the ke y posts in all areas of i ndustry (they've captured publishing already) and then government will fall. Probably, then, the males of their species will start landing and we'll all be enslaved. (Some of the males may have la nded already; look at the Manhattan literary scene.)

Others, however, claimed he was dead serious, and was a classical case of cocaine paranoia. Marvin always pointed out, when either of these theories was mentioned in his presence, \"there is a third possibility. I might be right. In that case, how convenient for Them that my sanity and sincerity are so often called into question. It almost looks as if They are conspiring to defame my character. Are they afraid that some might listen to me before it's too late, before the takeover is complete?\" Marvin's principal enemy, among the male half of the popula tion, was Frank Hemeroid, of c ourse. Hemeroid, oddly enough, hardly even knew of Marvin's existence a nd, hence, was incapable of being harmful to him by intention. That didn't matter. He was still the enemy with a capital E. At times Marvin had even suspected him of being extraterrestrial, like the leaders of Women's Lib. Hemeroid earned his animosity entirely by the books he wrote, which were full of treason, according to Marvin. Actually, Hemeroid's novels merely reflected the 197 0s literary society around him, in which most people were a little weird and all of them were losers. Hemeroid carefully depicted a world exactly like that: Most of his characters were weird and all of them were losers. The critics, who were all losers, called him a brutal realist. Marvin called him a traitor to planet Earth. Marvin wrote about all this in dialogues (he rather fancies himself as being of Platonic disposition) in which the speakers were Frank Hemeroid, representing 1970s values and reality-con structs, and Ernest Hemingway, Marvin's childhood hero who had been consigned to the literary garbage heap when the extr aterrestrials took over. He mingway, in these dialogues, represented Man, individual Man, the universal maveri ck, as he was before the extraterrestrial invasion. The dialogues were full of things like this: FRANK: Did you ever really believe in your own myth, you old faker? Did you think you could come out of a neurotic suicide-prone family and by sheer Will transform yourself into a hero, a br ave man, a great artist, a boxer, a big-game hunter, a cult figur e, an image of courage and of gr ace under pressure? Didn't you know yo u were a worm, that all men are worms and cowards, and that you'd be beaten at the end? Didn't you know you'd be like all the rest of us and give in to self- pity and self-doubt and pull that final cosmic trigger? ERNEST: I never said my way was easy. I said that Man wa s not meant for defeat, however many individuals may be defeated. I said that the effort to be conscious enough and brave enough was admirable, whatever the consequences. FRANK: Consciousness? Bravery? Consciousness is only aware of its own suffering in this blind existence, and bravery is only a gesture against the inevitable end. A stupid gesture, since th e cowards live longer, and if they're cowardly enough, they make all the comfortable decisions and have all the security possible in a Death Universe like this. ERNEST: I deny none of that, and I have shown the f cruelty mo re nakedly than any of your generation. I still say it is admirable to be brave and take big risks for the things you va lue. When everything mammalia n and mechanical tells you to run, and you stand and don't run, you learn what Man can be. And so on. Marvin was obsessed with something he called the Dignity of Man. He was not at all amused by ecological 111 / 233"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"relativists who told him that an ant or a swine might equally believe in the Dignity of Ant or the Dignity of Swine. Men were not ants or swine, he would say coldly; and he wo uld classify the heckler as probably brain- warped by the extraterrestrial Amazons. In truth, like most philosophers, Marvin never wrote explicitly about the one factor that really determined and explained everything in his philosophy. Just as Marx never mentioned his carbuncles in Das Kapital, and Freud didn't publish anything about his own sexual hang-ups, Marvin Gardens never wrote a word anywhere about the source and motive of all his theorizing. This was his penis. It was four inches long at best, and it had given him a defeatist psychology about things i n general, and women in particular, against which he had strugg led mightily to build his philosophy of Transcendental Male Courage. The women he classified as extr aterrestrials frightened him only a little bit more than the ordinary women he classified as terrestrials. Sometimes Marvin wrote dialogues between Pavlov's Dog and Schrödinger's Cat, instead of between Frank and Ernest. These were usually quite short and almost like Zen stories: DOG: I've got a million proofs that we're not free. CAT: I've got one proof that we are. DOG: What's that? CAT: Who asks what's that? 64 AMOEBAS The belief or unconscious conviction that all propositions are of the subject-predicate form-in other words, that every fact consists in some thing having some qua lity-has rendered most philo sophers incapable of giving any account of the world of science. -bertrand russell, Our Knowledge of the External World D ECEMBER 23, 1983: N atalie Drest was amazed as the conversa tion swung in a new quantum direction. \"You,\" she ga sped, \"you dig Krazy Cat too?\" \"Indeed, my dear,\" Blake Williams beamed. \"I may be the most devout student of Herriman's work anywhere in the civilized world.\" He didn't tell her (yet) that he regarded Krazy as a sy mbol of Schrödinger's Cat in the great wave-mechanics puzzle.

In a fine old mansion on Lake Shore Drive, Markoff Chancy t oddled down the hall leading to the Master Bedroom. He was dressed in a Teddy Snow Crop suit and felt like a perfect damned fool. Oh, well, the money is good, he told himself. Then he pushed the door open and entered the first rich person's bedroom he had ever seen. There was, as he had been told, only one light, behind the bed, playing upward on the ceiling and shedding a soft glow by reflection. The bed was made up, covered with an expensive-look ing heirloom spread. Beside it, lit up nicely by the indirect light, was the table bearing a si ngle can of Snow Crop orange juice, as he had expected. And on the bed, nude, eyes tightly closed and pretending to sleep, was his hostess. Chancy caught his breath. Judging from what he was expected to do, he had been prep ared to see a crazy old frump; instead, to his intense delight, it was obvious that the lady was still fairly young, quite well preserved, and definitely stacked. Crazy she might be (but how could he judge? Maybe it was normal for rich people to act out any fantasy that struck them.), but unappetizing she definitely was not. Although she was the first live naked woman he had ever seen, she was no less strikingly golden and rounded than, say, a P ussycat Pussyette of the Month. A head of gloriously fiery red ha ir was spread on the pillow, and below it her supposedly 113 / 233"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"sleeping face was lovely in its peaceful anticipation. His eyes swept over her rounded shou lders, the two snowy-white breasts rising and falling with her respiration, the cute nipp les that stood in surprisingly large areolas upon those breasts, the soft pillow of her belly, and, best of all, the thick swatch of reddish fur that hid her sex. And she had legs like a chorus gi rl. She's waiting for me-for me! Markoff Chaney experienced true happiness. Boldly, he stepped forward and grabbed the orange-jui ce can. An opener lay beside it and he quickly punched two holes, his hands trembl ing a bit-when the lady's belly moved with her breathing, he felt his penis stir in the same rhythm. Then, clutching the juice can in one hand, he hoisted himself onto the bed, catching her in a sudden smile. But she was good at the game; her eyes still didn't open. Carefully, he lay beside her hip, looking at those breasts, thos e real 3-D female breasts, not in a photograph, but right there in bed with him. Two of them, by Christ. Then, with infi nite delicacy, he lifted the can an d let some of the orange juice dribble onto her bush. She sighed and a tremor ran through her. He poured a little more, and her legs spread voluptuously and she slowly raised her knees. He was seeing it at last, the ou ter lips and the cleft revealed as he had always dreamed of it , the halo of reddish fur even more lovely than in his fantasies. He dribbled some more orange juice and leaned over, pushing the snout onto her bush and maneuvering his tongue into the cleft between the lips. Immediately, she groaned and threw her legs over his shoulders, pulling him deeper down into her crotch. \"Teddy,\" she murmured, \"you've come back.\" We all live in our fantasy and only endure our reality, he thought philosophically. According to instructions, he began a spiral licking motion, working from the outer lips slowly inward around the inner lips and ending with the clitoris again. She began to heave up and down like the loud-roaring sea, and his ex citement grew, as he imagined and participated in her sensations. Her hands were on the ears of his Teddy Snow Crop f costume and she was pulling him down onto her frantically as she bucked upward, literally fucking his mouth. He began lapping her more rapidly, quite distinctly tasting the musty musky female-in-passion flavor mixed with orange juice. \"Oh, your tongue, your tongue!\" she cried. \"In me, Teddy, in me.\" The midget maneuvered his tongue into her vagina and bobbed his head in imitation fucking motions. Her legs went limp on his back, then tight, then limp again. She's close to coming, he thought rapturously. I'm making a woman come at last. He strained, sticking his tongue farther into her, maddened by the thicker and heavier taste of her and losing the orange juice can entirely in his passion. He got both hands under her and lif ted her ass, drawing her pussy up to him, sucking desperately as he plunged his tongue again and ag ain deeper and deeper into her. \"TEDDY SNOW CROP!\" she screamed insanely. \"FRODO BAGGINSH PETER PAN!!! CHILDHOOD!!!! INNOCENCE!!!! EAT MY PUSSY!!!!\" She was coming, gushing like an oil well, all the female juices of her flowing into his mouth, and he nibbled the outer lips with his teeth, eyes tightly closed, riding on her crotch like a man hanging on to the edge of a cliff by his jaw muscles alone, bucking and bouncing with her, swallowing the essence of her womanhood, the elixir, and now after decades and decades of frustration, finally coming, exploding fr om the sheer lust of her soul communicated to him in every spasm and twitch of her passionate pussy. He thought two things: Now; they're going to have to cle an the Teddy Snow Crop suit. And: I wonder if I'm still technically a virgin. THE RICH ECONOMY 114 / 233"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"GALACTIC ARCHIVES: President Hubbard's first step in establishing the RICH Econom y was to offer a prize of $50,000 per year to any worker who could design a machine that would replace him or her. When the primate labor unions raised twenty-three varieties of hell about this plan, Hubbard countered by offering $30,000 a year to all other workers replaced by such a machine. The ra nk-and-file union people fell in to conflict immediately, some accepting this as a fine idea (this group co nsisting mostly of those earning less than twenty thou per annu m), and the leaders still hypnotized by the conditioned and domesticated primate reflex that Employment was Good and Unemployment was Bad. While the unions squabbled among themselves and ceased to presen t a united front ag ainst the RICH scen ario, conservatives mounted a campaign against it on the ground that it was inflationary. Here Hubbard's political genius showed itself. She made no effort to reason with the intellectual conservatives, who were all theo logians in disguise. All corporation heads and other alpha males of the right, however, were invited to a se ries of White House multimedia presentations on how RICH would work for them. The chief points in these pres entations were that: (1) a machine works twenty-four hours a day, not eight-thereby tripling output immediately; (2) machines do not ta ke sick leave; (3) machines are never late for work; (4) machines do not form unions and constantly ask for higher wage s and more fringe benefits; (5) machines do not take vacations; (6) machines do not harbor grudges and foul up production in sneaky, undetectable ways; (7) cybern ation was advancing every decade, anyway, despite the opposition of unions, government, and th ese alpha males; it was better to have huge populations celebrating the reward of $30,000 to $50,000 per year for grou p cleverness than huge populations suffering the humility of welfare; (8) with producti on rising due to both cybe rnation and the space-cities, consumers were needed and a society on welfare was a society of very meager consumers. The alpha males were still fighting among themselves about whether this was \"sound\" or not when it squeaked through Congress. Within a year the first case of the new multi-inventive leisur e class appeared. This was a Ch erokee Indian named Starhawk, who had been an engine-lathe wo rker in Tucson. After designing himself out of that job, Starhawk had gone on to learn four other mechanical factory jobs, designed h imself out of each, and now had a guaranteed income of $250,0 00 a year for these feats. He was now devoting himself to painting in the traditi onal Cherokee style-which was what he had always wanted to do, back in adolescence, before he learned that he had to work for a living. By 1983 there were over a thousand simi lar cases. Many had gone on to seek adva nced scientific degrees, and some had already migrated to th e L5 space-cities. The swarming was beginning. The majority of the unemployed, living co mfortably on $30,000 a year, admittedly spen t most of their time drinking booze, smoking weed, engaging in primate sexual acrobatics, and watching wall TV. When moralists complained that this was a subhuman existen ce, Hubbard answered, \"And what kind of existence did they have doing idiot jobs that machines do better?\" Some of the unemployed were beginning to seek jobs again; after all, $48,000 or $53,000 is better than $30,000. Usually, they found that higher education was required for the jobs th at were still available. Many were back in college; adult education, already a fast-growth industry in the 1970s, was now the fastest growing field of all. Hubbard was ready to launch St age Two of the RICH Economy. SATIRE The dialogues between Frank Hemeroid and Ernest Hemingway gr ew more turgidly moralistic as the 1970s passed; Marvin was never able to bring himself to approach a sexual partner more alien to his own tormented ego than his right fist.

He who confronts the fear is undefeated forever, even if his body dies. FRANK: Oh, come off it. The only reason anybody ever does anyt hing \"brave\" is because he's more afraid of being called a no-good shit for running away. ERNEST: You pass a thousand heroes on the street every day and never know how well they are carrying their burdens. FRANK: I know. The woman with the Mongoloid child. The blind man who makes you so uncomfortable. The rape victim pulling herself together and refusing to go mad. The dumb co p with a hernia yet who goes down an alley after a hopped-up thief who is also armed. I'm not blind, myself. You only see th eir moments of heroism. You don't choose to watch how blow follows blow until heroism becomes meaningless and they all give up, one by one, and join the universal chorus of despair. ERNEST: I have seen some who never gave up. A pig squeals when he sees the ax coming. A man can look right at the ax all his life and not squeal. FRANK: The ax falls, anyway, does it not? Isn't your refusal to squeal just a big act, a gigant ic lie? It's more honest to squeal with the other swine. ERNEST: I still decline to admit that men are no more than swine. FRANK: You are a Romantic, you old fool. If you had been honest enough to squeal like the rest of the swine, people would have seen the truth sooner. Every war since your day has been partly your fault, you know. If everybody squealed and ran away, there'd be no wars. Of course nobody wanted to publish this kind of ranting- although it took Marvin nearly ten years to learn that. In 1979 he set out grimly to write the worst, most ta steless, most vulgar book possible. He had arrived at that stage of psychological masochism where one must prove one's most pe ssimistic assumptions are true, for the sheer delight of knowing once and for all that th e universe is really a pisspoor proposition al l around. \"Public taste is a misanthropist's heaven and a humanitarian's hell,\" he said bitterly. For his hero he elected a monste r so monstrous as to be a mockery of all human hope, but one so obscure that he did not possess any of the evil glamour that surrounds a Hitler, a Nixon, or a Jack the Ripper. He picked Vlad Teppis- Vlad the Impaler- a fourteenth-century Hungarian re ligious fanatic who had executed 100,000 people for differing with his own extremely odd theological notions. Marvin's novel not only justified Vlad, but positively glorifed him; it was full of denunciations of liberalism, permissiveness, and the opponents of capital punishment. It also had the most violent rape scenes Marvin could conjure out of his misogynistic imagination. Vlad the Barbarian was a blatant incitement to violence, garbed in the most reactionary moralistic prejudices imaginable. It was bought by the first New York publisher to whom it was submitted, for a higher advance than Albert Speer's memoirs or any of the confessionals of the Watergate felons. A movie sale was negotiated even before the book was released, and John Wayne starred as Vlad, looking really si ncere every time he explained why murder and rape were the highest human virtues. Marvin was immediately com missioned to write a sequel, Vlad Victorious. Actually, because Marvin rea lly was, in his own odd wa y, a philosopher of sorts, Vlad the Barbarian was not totally bad. In researching it Marvin had stumbled upon the enigma that makes Vlad Teppis somewhat interesting to students of the human mind in general and the ruling-class mind in particular. Th e mystery was this: Two early, approximately contemporary and seemingly authentic accounts tell one particular stor y about Vlad, but each tell s it differently. There is thus no scientific w ay of saying which account is true. The disputed story is that two monks on a journey stopped at Vlad's castle one night and begg ed shelter from the elements. Vlad set out for them a magnificent banquet and then afterward asked them what the people of Hungary really thought about him. The first monk answered diplomatically and falsely that everybody said Vlad was a ster n but just ruler. The second monk boldly told the truth: that everybody said Vlad was a homicidal ma niac. Vlad thereupon had one of the monks impaled. The problem is that the first seemingly authentic account says he executed the flattering liar, and the other seemingly authentic account claims he executed the honest monk. Marvin left this mystery unsolved in his book, and it was, perhaps, one reason th at the novel became fa shionable even with intellectuals. 116 / 233"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Everybody, it appeared, had some intuitive, prelogical feeling about which monk a man of the caliber of Vlad Teppis would impale. Some were quite sure that a dingaling of that sort would kill the one who dared to tell him the truth. Others, however, were just as sure that Vlad woul d find a special sadistic relish, and a moral justification to boot, in surprising bot h monks by executing the flatterer. Arguing about Vlad's choice, as it was soon called, spread from coast to coast. \"What would you do if you were one of the monks ?\" was a favorite question in these arguments. \"I'd do what the first monk did,\" Simon Moon said, in an argu ment with other programmers who worked with the Beast. \"I'd tell Vlad he was the very model of a Christian statesman-which, in fact, he was.\" \"I'd tell the truth,\" said Markoff Chancy, on a Greyhound bus, \"just to prove that little men have big balls.\" \"I'd lie,\" Dr. Frank Dashwood ad mitted at a posh Nob Hill party in San Francisco. \"The most dangerous thing in the world is to tell the truth to a government official who is a primitive barbarian, in fourteenth-centu ry Transylvania or twentieth- century America.\" Professor Fred (\"Fidgets\") Digits, who always kept his conn ection with the Warren Belch So ciety a secret and, hence, retained academic respectability , finally published a paper in Technology Review analyzing the problem from the perspective of the von Neumann-Morgenster n game theory. The monks, in this context, basically confront a problem in p rediction. Each must decide, before speaking, wh at Vlad's reaction will be : Will he be grateful for an accurate report or angered by it? Every person in an authoritarian situation faces this dilemma da ily, and it haunts cor porations, armies, and government bureacracies. \"It is the classic disinformation situation,\" Digits conclude d, satisfied that he had identified the problem, even if he couldn't solve it. Others pointed out the similar logic of the notorious \"Snafu Principle\" propos ed by the eccentric businessman Hagbard Celine in his witty, perverse little booklet Never Whistle While You're Pissing. According to the Snaf u Principle, accurate, honest communication is possible only between equals, and every power matrix is a disinformation situation. Since this seems to challenge the very pr inciple of power and leads directly to an archy, many were sorry that Mad Marvin had ever posed the Vlad Enigma.

Nonetheless, that one gaunt German sentence found in 1971 stuck with him, taunted him, provoked him, eventually goaded him. He began studying the origins of the Frankenstein idea within the Promethean ambience of the Shelley-Byron circle. He res earched the early Resuscitation Society. He traveled to Michigan to talk to H. C. E. Coppinger, the far-out physicist who had started the cryonics movement with his astonishing book The Aspects of I mmortality. The idea just wouldn't let go of him. In 1974 he even, somewhat shamefaced ly, looked into the writings of a strange Providence, Rhode Island, mystic who had written much on the metaphysics of the Necronomicon.

It was made up of quotations from Thomas Aquinas, Ezra Pound, B. F. Skinner, and Dr. Horace Naismith, fou nder of the First Bank of Religiosophy . The quotes from Aquinas and Pound condemned the lending of money at interest. The quotes from Skinner said that people could be conditioned to abandon any habitual behavior and substitute a new behavior. The quotes fr om Dr. Naismith urged everybody to join the First Bank of Religiosophy, or at least to buy one of his books or pamphlets: \"What Religiosophy Means,\" The Scientific Cure for D epressions, Economic and Psychological, \"Jesus Christ's Secret T eachings About Money,\" and Operant Reinforcement, the Bible Alternative to Satan's International Bankers* The streets were full of zombies at that time.

The Religiosophists had all been operant-conditioned to be tireless proselytizers, and Bl ake Williams had even invented a mathematical puzzle based on calculating the probability of crossing any American city without being accost ed by one of them, which turned out to be harder than the old problem of crossing Dublin without passing a pub. *Terran Archives 2803; Interest was a charge for the use of the circulating medium (money). Primatologists have found similar money fetishism on hundr eds of planets where hominid types evolved; money and barter themselves are typical primate behaviors which can easily be taught to ch impanzees and other anthropoids. In addition to Aquinas, Pound, and Naismith, early Terrestrial philosophers who suggested more human alternatives to this apeli ke economics included Thomas Edison, Buckminster Fuller, C. H. Douglas, Benjamin Tucker, and several others.

She esta blished a yearly reward of $100,000 for the nonscientist who made the most important contribution to the fight against aging. Since the scientists engaged in life-extension research were al ready one of the two most heavily funded groups in Unistat (the other was the space engineers), scientists were amused, but not offend ed, by this wild idea. The first year there were 5,237 entries submitted. A spot check by the Beast showed that 4,02 3 came from the new leisure class-ex-workers who had invented themselv es out of several jobs and had $50,000 to $80,000 annual incomes. The others came from people who had been unemployed by these inventions . Evidently, many of them were getting bored with a life that consisted mostly of fucking, TV, an d vacations, even though that had been what most primat es imagined they would do if they didn't have to work for a living. The second year there were over 30,000 entries-much as Hubbard had expected. The Longevity Revolution was having its inevitable effect. People who were expecting to live for centuries instead of decades were spontaneously taking the Next Step in their thinking.

He saw the skull beneath the skin, like Eliot; the tears poured and he sat there, weeping for allflesh, for alltormented flesh, for alltormentedfuckingflesh, howling in anguish at the withdrawal of the nipple of self-absorption. He was in Belsen. He stood in the white light as Hiroshima was incinerated. He watched the Grand Army retreat in the snow from Moscow. The tramp fell eternally toward the sidewalk and he saw the wolves cl ose in on the terrified caribou , the smirk of Caligula and all sadists everywhere, the parents of a thousand wars weeping with him over murdered children (\"We should be gentle with children,\" a Voice said reproachfully from a window in space), and fo r a minute he had a crazy religious vision that WE HAVE TO STOP THE KILLING there is no other way and it is too late for another alternative it is exactly that simple and you can even repeat it in italics we have to stop the killing and he was so excited at the sudden clarity of it that he could see his whole future as nonstop witnessing to the truth of this vision. He would invent his own TV show and become a supersalesman and sell it to the top network and it would be the Corporal Works of Mercy Hour. It would have no acts of violence or hurting. It would just be d ecent people doing decent things , as enumerated in the famo us passage from Aquinas: visiting the sick and imprisoned, feeding the hungry, giving shelter to the homeless, aiding the oppressed, comforting the afflicted, and praying for us all.

This was one of her most astonishing achie vements, since most primates thought pris ons were preventatives, not causes, of crime. Eve Hubbard, needless to say, had always been a unique Terran, which was why she was the first Black President of Unistat. Although she was, like most brilliant people, extremely good- looking-the genetic link between health, hedonism, cleverness, and good looks (the \"bright-eyes-and-bushy-ta ils\" gestalt) is true in all species on all known planets-Eve had dropped out of films after a smash success as th e supersexed ebony android in Gentlemen Prefer Clones. She had gone on to major in philosophy at UCLA, and was al most denied her Ph.D. because her thesis was a thorough rejectio n of all philosophies hitherto invented by Terran prim ates. She went on to become one of the first ne urogeneticists. In fact, it was due to certain discoveries in primate genetics that she had decided to go into politics next. The Code Hubbard, the most important revision of primate juri sprudence since the Code Napoleon, divided all crimes into three classes. Crimes against convention- so-called victimless crimes- were not penalized at all. A citizen could be interrogated about each behavior only after complaints by a minimum of one hu ndred neighbors. The interrogators, a group of trained neurogeneticists, would then publish a report, either mildly recommending relocation of the heretic, or, much more commonly, strongly advising the neighbors to mind their own business. Many libertarians objected to this, sin ce they wanted victimless crimes abolis hed utterly. Hubbard had pragmatically realized that such libertarian penolo gy was impractical until the primates totally outgrew the morality delusion. Those who chose relocation were assigned by the Beast to an environment where th eir heresy was \"normal.\" Most of them found that the Beast recommended an L5 space-city, and most of them like d it when they got there. They had futique genes. Many of the heretics, of course, chose to st ay where they were and go on annoying the bejesus out of their neighbors. This is the typical recalcitrant streak found in certa in domesticated primates on all planets. Crimes against property were regarded as improper economics requiring ad justment. The felon was compelled to pay in full the value of that which had been appropriated or destroyed. If unable to pay, the felon then had a literal \"debt to society.\" The government paid the victim, and the felon repaid the government by working at half wages on some socially useful project, such as longevity research, space re search, or just as a forest ranger in the growing number of national parks that were appearing since Industry was mo ved off the planet into Free Space. Crimes of violence were defined as the natural, inevitable, tragic, but intolerable resultant of some combination of genes, imprints, and conditioning. The biots who committed such acts were sent, without condemnation but irrevocably, to Hell. Hell had previously been the state of Miss issippi. After the aborigines were resettled in an environment suitable for two- circuit (prehominid) primates, Mississipp i became Hell by simply su rrounding it w ith a laser shield that made escape impossible. Everything within the shield was intact. The violen t biots were free to do what th ey wanted, and they soon had several forms of feudalism, war, piracy, commerce, slavery, and other early primate institutions functioning in a manner that seemed normal to them. Many violent biots and gene pools moved to Hell voluntarily, sin ce it was the only remaining part of the world that fit their notions of proper primate society. Among those who migrated en masse and established si zable governments or robber bands in Hell were the Ku Klux Klan, the Black Panthers, the Am erican Nazi Party, Hell's Ange ls, and most of the People's Ecology Party. John Wayne, nearly one hundred years old, but looking and feeli ng around thirty due to FOREVER, and totally cured of all cancers by the Org pills, also went to Hell.

The Skeptic with in him had decided that the most operational model for those events which naive occultists attribute to \"Choronzon\" was to classify them as synchronicities activated by the presence of the Trickster God archetype, in the Jungian collective uncons cious, or Leary's neurogenetic archives, or somewhere back down there in the thalamus or brainstem. To assume, even fo r a minute, that Choronzon had an objective existence beyond the archetype in the unconscious circ uitry of the central nervous system was to collapse into prescientific theology and demonology. But, alas, the Skeptic was only one program inside the Malik biocomputer, and not at his best at moments like this. The Shaman tape began running in its own programs as the Skeptic faded out, and Joe noticed again for the thousandth time how the ego circuit melded with the new progra m as easily as it had with the old, so now he \"was\" Joe Malik the Shaman, son of a thousand years of Sufis, and if Choronzon was really messing around he betta watcha his ass. \"It's that motherfuckin' loa,\" Carol said angrily. \"We didn't do the exorcism right. ...\" \"Choronzon\" was a mind-construct of the primates specializing in the Enochian version of Cabalistic magick. Talking out of two sides of their mouths at once, as wa s typical of primate mystics, the Cabalis ts said that Choron zon was the astral embodiment of all the i llusions and deception on Te rra (especially all the egotism and malice). They added that Choronzon was also a part of the psyche of the student which had to be faced and conquered before Illumination was complete. When asked whether Choronzon was then outside or inside, they usually answered \"Both.\" This reply made no sense at all until G. Spencer Brown published his Laws of Form. A loa was a mind-construct of those primates who specialized in Santaria, also called Magicko de Chango or Voudon. A loa, just like the Gentry, mi ght on occasion be kindly disposed; but a guardian loa who was set on a woman to prevent her from copulating (except with the primate who had through Santaria created/projected/contacted said loa) was well known to be extremely malign, devious, fiendish, impish, devilish, and a Royal pain in the ass. The has, like the Gentry and the various Cabalistic angels and demons, operated beneath th e space-time continuum in \"dream time,\" where the true Free Masons create reality friezes. An archetype was a mind-construct of a primate named Carl Jung, who specialized in preneurological psychology. An archetype existed at the \"psychoid\" level, which was below that of individual or collective uncons ciousness, where the organic and the inorganic meld and merge into psychoid matrices which, if nudged by the right archetype, would produce a reality-construct so astonishing that it would appear like magi ck or a very strange \"coincidence.\" Jung called these psychoid archetypal effects synch ronicities.

Carol had a great deal of experience at maintaining her cool. Her career had been typical of self-directed Unistat females who matured in the early 1970s: one rape at age fifteen while hitchhiking (she never hitchhiked again); two abortions; husband #1, who turned out to be so fr ee of Macho and the Male St ereotype that even God's Lightning couldn't accuse him of Chauvinism (he wept most pite-ously when Carol got tired of supporting him and threw him out); husband #2, who was brilliant, kind, generous, sensitive, and a junky; a succession of mediocre lovers, with one or two she still treasured in memory but wouldn't want to live with again for all the tea in Acapulco; producers who believed that an actress as gorgeous as she should only be cast in roles that justified getting all her clothes off sometime during the third act and several times in their private offices; husband #3, who had put the goddamned loa on her when they separated; and Ronnie \"Ronnie is doing very well for a special child,\" the doctor had told her the last time she visited the home. That was a hell of an elaborate euphemism for Mongo lian idiot, she thought angrily; but the doctor was trying to be kind, and she forgave him. But two nights later she opened in another Off-Off-Off Broadway, Hiroshima Werewolf, and one critic described her as having \"a special childlike quality reminiscent of Monr oe.\" She felt a wave of vertigo on reading that: If the doctor and the critic were not in cahoots to drive her over the edge, then thos e words were the most sinister kind of synchronicity.

The Fetus People did not like this description; they called themselves the Right to Life Committee. Disk was in his teens then and had the usual hormones flowing through his adolescent primate body. He thought he was continually tormented by sinful desires, not understa nding the role of testosterone in pubescent primates. He was a member of the True Roman Catholic Church, a splinter group formed after Vatican II had taken the main body of the Romish religion off into heresy and modernism. The memb ers were survivors of the Iris h-American fascism that had once rallied behind Father Coughlin, Fath er Feeney, and Senator Joe McCarthy. Th ey regarded the English Mass as being almost as sacrilegious as abortion and Social Security as only one step from Stalinism. The Fetus People or the Right to Life Committee was an amalgamation of True Roman Catholics with the kind of Fundamentalists Protestants seldom seen north of Bad Ass, Texas. They were, like all prim ate ideologists and moralists, chiefly concerned with finding no-good shits and dumping on them. They believed the abortionists were in league with all the other no-good shits, including the Rockefellers, the international Communist sex educators, life-extension re searchers, cattle mutilators, NASA, and th e intergalactic Black Magicians of the Illuminati, under the leadership of the infamous Cagliostro the Great. They also believed that the Unistat government had never waged an unjust war, that the hair of the seventh son of a seventh son cures warts, and most of what they read in Reader's Digest. By 1982 the legal struggles over abortion were over and the w hole issue seemed as remote as the War of the Roses. This was because a 100 percent effective morning-after contraceptive had been on the mark et since 1980 and had proven so effective that requests for abortions had dwindled to virtually zero. By 1983 the economic demand for abortions was about as microscopic as the demand for buggy whips in 1923, after every town in Unistat had switched from horse-drawn carriages to au tomobiles. Another quantum jump in sociology had occurred. Actually, the morning-after pill was a chemical abortifa-cient , as any biochemist knew. The biochemists never talked about this in public, since they were all agnostic liberals and it was against their principles to either lie by denying the facts or to help the Fetus People by telling the truth. As a result of this policy by the biochemists only a handful of the Fetus People turned their attack against the pill when abortion was no longer a live issue. Since the resultant of the morning-after pill was, to th e human eye, no different from ordinary menstruation, opposing this seemed exceedingly eccentric even for Fetus People. The majority of the Fetus People, deprived of their. raison d'etre, began splitting amoebalike into factions and subfactions. Some few of them, who had real ly been concerned with the rights of the unborn, became concer ned at last with the rights of the born and launched new groups to oppose the surviving vestiges of war, capital punishment, or poverty in backward parts of the planet. 127 / 233"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The majority, who had been mainly preoccupied with findin g no-good shits and dumping on them, joined organizations like N OODLE (National Organization Or ganized for Decent Literature and Entertainm ent) or the First Bank of Religiosophy.

ROSENFELT HAS DESTROYED ME In 1941 the Carter Brothers Carnival play ed Xenia, Ohio, and some students from Antioch College tried to throw Cagliostro a whammy with a dragon-headed Japanese condom. His handling of that challenge aroused th e admiration an d awe of old carny hands; and they were even more amazed by his friendship with Rambo, the lion. Sandoz, the lion tamer, in particular, was astonished at Cagliost ro's ability to sit for hours in the cage, he and the lion sta ring into each other's eyes like lovers. \"Are you hypnotizing him?\" Sandoz asked once. \"Not at all,\" Cagliostro said, laughing. \"He's hypnotizing me. Or maybe we're just learning to get outside our own skins. That's what life is all about, you know-making windows, breaking out of every box ...\" The failure of the students to shake up Cagliostro led a few professors to come over and try various scientific devices not likely to be included in any standard verbal code. He placidl y identified rheostats, Wheatstone bridges, pH meters, Bunsen burners, and even a gyroscope. The next night they were b ack with a chemical formula never before synthesized. \"Are you presently able to see the pa rticular object that I have been given at this time?\" the girl asked. And the blindfolded Cagliostro replied calmly, \"A test tube. With some blue liquid in it. A copper sulphate compound.\" \"That's a damned good code,\" the professors agreed, more ferventl y this time, as they drove back to Antioch. (There's no hope of salvaging anything- the suicide note had said- and you're going to have to make it on your own, just like I did. Rosenfelt has destroyed me and he'll destroy free enterprise.) The carnival was in Biloxi, Mississippi, that winter, and Cagliostro was trying his new gig, combining Houdini-style escapes with his mentalism act. He had been locked in a trun k, and the local police cooperatively used their best padlocks to secure the chains. He settled down to slow, regular yoga breathing-the escape actually took only a few minutes, but he was following Houdini's formula that the audience was more impressed if they had to wait a half hour for the miracle. The yoga conserved the oxygen in the trunk against any possibility that panic, toward the end, might force him into rapid breathing. He timed the breaths against a slow AUMMMMMM, his mind drifted back to Park Avenue and a black maid whose framed picture of a Catholic-looking Jesus sometimes in certain lights seemed to have horns, and he relaxed his hands and feet (there can be no muscle tension in the tors o if the extremities are tota lly limp), bringing her face back clearly, and he heard a voice shouting, \"We're at war!

His first arrest occurred in the fall of th at year, possession of mariju ana, the charges dismissed w ithout a trial. (His agent' s connections, the Crane family la wyer, the fact that the Crane fortune had not been wiped out entirely when ORGASMOR dropped to the bottom of the Big Board, and judicious oiling of what Show Biz and underworld people call \"tin mittens\"- officials on the take- contributed to this happy consummation.) He was one of the first guests on The Ed Sullivan Show, but was never asked to return due to a 1948 \"morals\" arrest: the girl was quite young and an \"act against nature\" was alleged. Once again, money changed hand s and there was no trial. His career was mostly \"in the clubs\" after that; Hollywood and TV were both in one of their chronic contractions of cowardice at the end of the decade. A second morals arrest, followed rapidly by a second pot bust, made him a little too hot for most club owners. Still-the crowds turned out wherever he appeared . The mob decided to set immediate money against caution, and he was allowed to go on working.

From this day forward.\" THE HEAD REVOLUTION GALACTIC ARCHIVES: Although the HEAD Revolution transformed the Terran primates at the time of this ancien t Romance, nobody knows when it actually began. Some trace it to certain Alchemical cults of the early Dark Ages; some say it did not properly start as an organized movement until neuro-pharmacology began to repl ace old-fashioned \"psychology\" in the late Dark Ages (i.e., just before the time of this epic novel); some try to find its origins in primitive shamanism and yoga. What is clear is that some primates on Terra began to transcend genetic f our-circuit limitations many centuries, or even millennia, before true neuroscience app eared among them. Whether this was du e to mutation, empirical hit-or-miss experimentation with alkaloid herbs, or other factors is unknown. In Egypt an d China and other places, a few primates reported fifth-circuit raptures-the dawning of neurosomatic consciousness-two thousand or ev en three thousand years before the Space Age began. The picture is the same on all planets. A few biots suddenly rise above the eat-it-or-flee-it imprints of the amphibian biosurvival circuit, above the dominate-or-submit imprints of the mammalian territorial-e motional circuit, above the either/or logic of the hominid semantic circuit, above the \"go od\" and \"bad\" values of the trib al sociosexual circuit. They have transcended infantile feeding programs, childish emotional programs, adolescent philosophizing, and adult \"responsibility\" (pack role) all at once. What has happened, of course, is that thes e biots have formed a fifth circuit in their brains. This is called the neurosomatic circuit because it allows conscious feedb ack between the nervous system (\"mind,\" in prescientific primat e language) and the soma (\"body\"). In the larval stages of this Hedonic Revolu tion, every planet exhibits th e same monotonous pattern: M ysticism and monomania appear. Many of the mutated biots become convinced that they control ev erything (the \"I-am- God\" syndrome), not realizing that they me rely control their ow n perceptual field. 132 / 233"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"\"Miracle healings\" are reported. The neurosomatic (\"mind body\") feedback lo op allows the mutant biots to become healthier, younger-looking, and sleeker (\"handsomer\") than average. They soon believe, and are encouraged by their admirers to never doubt, that they can \"cure\" anything. N eurosomatic intolerance appears. The mutated biots grow annoyed, and beco me extremely critical about, the robot mechanisms of first-circuit approach-avo idance, second-circuit domination-submissi on, third-circuit either or-logic, and static fourth-circuit sex roles. They call on everybody to float free like themselves, or like the wind. The other biots usually declare these five -circuit mutants to be divine, or else they kill them. Sometimes they do both. The condition was just becoming understood on Terra at the time of this Quantum Comedy, as neuropharmacol-ogists slowly traced the links between neurochemistry and the creation of perceived reality-tunnels. GRAPEFRUIT THROUGH THE NIGHT Anyone with I's in their hood could see it was a tight cityation there on bonger howl, one nation under guard, as Case tosses in the midst of the nightmare, all of them whooping it oop with their tommyhawk fans an d their moody decks and their scolded litters, one nation in a dirigible. Forty of them with town feathers, raisi ng coin as much as they were able, insi dious rapacious seditious, with their stars bangled bangers and the ramrods we welshed, through the nox with the lox from a bulb, till the girl with colitis goes by, and Case really saddling hard into it and glowing coolish along with it and hooverin deeper and dotter into doubt about it, pushing a head with their desotos and pontiacs th ere. \"Buy all Chimatong highdeals,\" they sang. It was the Guylum Bardot or the Bardot Theodial or if not it was the vector moaning there, all singing O atum bomb O adum bum vee green send unum blather. The very muddle of a model motel tea party: Immolaton, Resurrection, Sewandsow. And Justin Case awoke. Just a nightmare, just a nightmare . . . In dians auditing his income tax and all that, fading now, only a trauma house, or a drama, yes, fadern. Justin sat up and turned on the light. His first thought was that he was on ly dreaming that he had awakened. For, at the foot of his bed, there stood a little green man in a miniature NASA spacesuit. \"I am Apollon of Mars,\" he said. \"Come with me at once.\" THERE IS NO GOVERNOR ANYWHERE Hugh Crane served his contempt -of-Congress sentence at Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, the \"gentleman's club\" as the Maf calls it, where the government incarcerates those ritzy felons who are not likely to shiv a guard or climb a wall. He worked in the library with Alger Hiss . They both watched the famous \"Checkers\" speech on the TV in the rec room. This was a masterpiece of primate orat ory in which a vice presidential candidate na med Richard Nixon argued that huge sums of money given to him by various businessmen were not intended as br ibes and were not expected to result in reciprocal favors 133 / 233"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"on his part. \"As an old carny man,\" Mr. Hiss asked Mr. Crane, \"what do you think of that performance?\" \"The dog shtik was very good,\" Crane said professionally. \"But he left out Mother.\" Another distinguished guest at Lewisburg that year was the aging Idaho poet and folk singer Ezra Pound, who was also in for Un-American Activities. He and Crane never got along well, because Pound, who had se ldom been out side Idaho, distrusted all easterners. Crane performed yoga exercises every day in his cell. The Illuminati, of course, subsequently scanned the notes he kept on these neurophysiological experiments. The most interesting items were the following: April 23, 1952-It helps if you identify each letter of AUM with one of the three gods of the Hindu trinity. A is Brahm, the Creator: let it explode upward from the diaphragm, like the big bang of creation itself. U is Vish nu, the Preserver: hold it so long that it vibrates, like the rhythm of life, the Big Beat of Beethoven's Seventh. M is Shiva, the Destroyer: close the lips in a decisive bite of \"This is the way the world ends\" as you enter the silence. May 1, 1952-Today, unexpectedly, pure dhyana. It was so much simpler than I ever gue ssed, and it is obviously a matter of practice. No wonder the yogis say that it' s dangerous to do this without a guru: I am no better or worse, morally, and no wiser or more \"spiritual.\" Repetition is the whole key. Force the nerves and muscles and glan ds, force them day after day, and it happens. The chief function of the gu ru is to ensure that you don't take advantage of the new freedom too quickly and get yourself in trouble with the authorities. The guru doesn't he lp it happen at all (as the honest ones admit); you do all the work yourself. The guru just ma kes sure that the rapture flows into \"safe\" (domesticated?) channels. Without such a moral watchdog, I am free to do as I bloody please. I just realized why all the real occult schools are so damned secretive, why the ordinary seeker is given a lot of double-talk and ejected out the same door wherein he came. If everybody could do this, the whole world would be in continuous revolution.* May 27, 1952-Another successful dhyana. There's nothing to it, really. The brain obv iously operates on the same principle as those fellows in The Hunting of the Snark: \"What I tell you three times is true.\" (T hree million times is more accurate.) It was marvelous-better than the first time-and I'll never identify with \"Cagliostro the Great\" or \"H ugh Crane\" or even \"me\" or the perpendicular pronoun, ever again. I can see more and more clearly why all th is is \"sealed with seven seals\" and hidden behind all kinds of mystification. Society as we know it is based on torture and death, or the threat of torture and death. I am in here to be tortured, although the authorities will never admit that. (What they do with heretics in other countries is torture; what we do here is penology.) The cage experience is prof oundly punishing to the average human, as to any primate; it is the form of torture our society countenances. It is no torture to me only because I have learned certain neurological arts every stage magician learns. But if everybody could go into dhyana at will, nobody could be controlled-by f ear of prison, by fear of whips or electroshock, by fear of deat h, even. All existing society is based on keeping those fears alive, to control the masses. *Terran Achives 2803: Dhyana was the Sanskrit name, used by the Hindic primates, to describe the opening and imprinting of the neurosomatic circuit. The ter m, and the techniques of inducing it, became Ch'an in China and Zen in Japan. It was always supervised by an alpha male for the reasons Crane suspected. It represents the dawning of post-primate consciousness and the HEAD Revolution, thereby rendering the biot independent of the primate domina nce-submission hierarchy. Ten people who know what I know would be more dangerous than a million armed anarchists. July 23, 1952-I can hardly write. Today I reached Samadhi. It makes dhyana look like nothing by comparison. All my certainty is gone. I should be terrified, but instead I'm ecstatic. If this is possible, anything is possible.* These notes were not published when Hugh came out of prison. Instead, he brought forth a book cheerfully titled There is N o Governor Anywhere, which explained some-not all-of his magic escapes, and set this in the context of a philosophy which declared every individual a creator of his own univer se. The polemics against gover nment and organized religion were tactless, to say the least, for a performer depending upon public goodwill; Crane did not hesitate to identify his outlook bluntly as atheis m and anarchism. To everybody's su rprise, including Crane's, the book became a bes t -seller, and he became the most controversial man in the 134 / 233"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"United States. Even in the fearful fift ies- even with Am erican Legion and John Birch chapters constantly reminding everyone of his drug arrests, his sex arre sts, and the documented fact that prison authorities had delayed his parole because of his homosexual seduction of a younger inmate-Hugh Crane acquired a new following. TV gingerly tested him on the egghead ghetto of Sunday afternoon, then pr omoted him to the late-late talk shows. *Terran Archives 2803: Samadhi was the Hindustani name for the opening and imprinting of the sixth (metraprogramming) circuit in the frontal lobes of the post - primate brain. Most of those who achieved it before the HEAD Revolution were just as bewildered as Crane and could say only tha t the experience was \"ineffable.\" He managed to end every appearance with the words \"There is no governor anywhere; you are all absolutely free.\" And around then-to the vocal dismay of pr ess and clergy-a club owner decided he was a \"freak\" act (\"They'll hate him but they'll come\") and Crane was able to work as a magician again. The cr owd overflowed into the street and many were turned away. Cagliostro introduced a new escape, fr om a lead box that had been welded closed in view of the audience. \"There is no restraint that cannot be escaped,\" he told them in an intense tone. \"We are all absolutely free.\" A pudgy Broadway columnist named Benny Benedict, who was just starting to get a following, interviewed him the next day. \"How the hell did you manage that welded-box escape?\" Benedict asked bluntly. \"I used real magic,\" the Gr eat Cagliostro pronounced. \"Come off it,\" Benedict said. But Cagliostro merely grinned at him impudently. THE ORDEAL OF RHODA CHIEF When Rhoda Chief became the country's top Rock singer at the age of seventeen in 1958, her education was virtually nil. She knew very few facts and several dozen factoids: the long side of the triangle is called the hypotenuse and is equal to both of the other sides, or one side multiplied by the other, or something like that; what she had in her panties could make a lot of money if she was smart, or a lot of trouble if she was dumb; if you spit on an eraser, it will erase ink; Columbus did his trip in 1492, and they either started the revolution or finish ed it in 1776; Lincoln freed th e slaves; if you yell loud eno ugh nobody can tell if you're on key or off; we're all go nna get blown to hell by the bomb sooner or later; yellows make all your troubles go away, but the reds are the ones to take before a concert or a recording session. After her abortion she learned enough abou t birth control to teach a course at the YWCA. After being screwed blued and tattooed by two record companies in a row, sh e also learned enough about contract law to teach that at Harvard. Her real education began when she becam e the mistress of Ca gliostro the Great. The first one to see the whip marks on Rhoda's back was an old friend from Arkham High School, Doris Horus. \"Why don't you leave him?\" Doris asked. \"It's voluntary,\" Rhoda said stonily. \"It's my True Will.\" The scandal eventually became an official rumor-\"A nightclub Nostradamus, previo usly involved in other sex and drug offenses, is treating his ballad-belting sweet heart in a very sick way. Readers of a certain French marquis will know what I mean,\" was its first printed form, in the nation's most widely read gossip column. \"You've got quite a reputation as a sadist,\" Epicene Wildeblood, th e literary critic, said to Cran e the very day that appeared. \"Afraid to be identified with me publ icly?\" Crane asked. They were in Wi ldeblood's jet-set pad, on Sutton Place. \"Oh, not at all, darling,\" Eppy purred. \"How funny that I should know what you really are. Don't I, babe?\" He lifted Crane's chin with the toe of his shoe. \"Yes, master,\" Crane mumbled. 135 / 233"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"\"Oh, that sounded a little sullen. I think you're just a bit rebellious today, babe. That must be punished.\" \"Yes, master,\" Crane said, going to the cl oset for the ropes. After he was stripped , and lying face down on the bed, Eppy carefully tied his four limbs to the four bedposts. \"You are my slave and you can't escape,\" he said. \"I am your slave and I can't escape,\" Crane repeated, as Wildeblood mounted him, both of them perfectly aware that he could slip the knots at any time. Crane took Rhoda to the Rainbow Room that night and made a point of loudly and brutally humiliating her throughout the meal. She accepted it all (h er hundred most intimate friends a nd enemies in the room noticed w ith disapproval), as if he had hypnotized her. Rhoda actually took nearly a year to discove r what was happening to her. It had started with a routine roll in the hay, but in the middle of it he lifted her to an unusual position. \"What the hell is this?\" she asked. \"Tibetan, angel,\" he said softly . \"Relax and you'll enjoy it.\" She relaxed, and it was the most extraord inary sexual experience of her life. After that, for two months, she followed all of his instructions, with growing delight and a firm belief that she was approaching that Ultimate Orgasm the Mailer fellow was always writing about. Then, one night, he brought out the ropes. \"Now, wait a minute,\" she said, \"that's English. That's kink. Go to London if you want that.\" \"I love you,\" he murmured, his mouth moving south across her belly toward her bush; in a little while, she agreed to the restraints. He tied them very firmly-and then, to her relief, no weapon was produced. He didn't even produce his own weapon; it was entirely oral. After five orgasms, she found him sitting up and lighting a joint. In a minute, he held it to her own lips. \"For the big one,\" he said. She toked hungrily wh ile he kissed and caressed her and muttered endearments-but she could still feel the ropes. When the joint was finished he finally mounted her and galloped into some dimension of spasm she had never known before. \"God,\" she said, coming back to herself, \"that was the big one.\" But he was reversed agai n, his mouth on her snatch, and her head spun. The mild discipline began a few weeks later. \"It builds up the charge,\" he said, and she found that it did. Soon she agreed that stronger discipline built an ever-gr eater charge. When the sadism switched to a psychological level, she was too far gone to stop, living in a dark and pulsati ng cave of ecstasy and pain millions of light-years from com-mon earth. She accepted degradation, humiliation, and the growing vampirism which seemed calculated to slowly destroy her last remnants of ego. Once or twice, she remembered later, she had feebly protested, \"Enough, too much. Please.\" \"No!\" he shouted. \"We're at the edge. We've got to go all the way over.\" (\"Yes, master,\" he would be saying to Epicene Wild eblood a few hours later, \"whatever you wish, master.\") \"You could have lots of bookings, instead of just working in public terlets,\" his agent told him. \"I could get you in top- money rooms. People would forget those drug charge s, and those teenaged girls, if you didn't keep reminding them by being even worse. The way you and Rhoda carry on in public, everyone thinks you're a kink. And you and that faggot, Wildeblood-everyone thinks you're a touch lavender yourself, buddy. Why don't you straighten out, for Christ's sake? You're going to end up a beggar.\" (Remembering: possibly a previous incarnation: Hesse at the station in Zurich: \"The mescaline, ja, the mescaline is the great teacher\": and Crowley in Berlin: \"The question is, who is it that seeks the True Self?\" All so long ago, so far away, and Richard Jung saying, \"I am an accountant, I don't buy any of this mysticism,\" begging on th e street near the Old Granary where Paul Revere and the original Five lie buried, Rancid the Butler, Mama Sutr a, weeping among the corpses at Chateau Thierry. \"Please Jesus don't let me die, don't let me die . . .\") The boy, who was to become Cagliostro the Great, heard \"You're going to end up a beggar\" and looked back and saw the tramp falling to the ground, very slowly, like the tree he had seen fall slowly after being ch opped by the caretaker at the upstate Crane country home. And, just like the tree, when he finally r eached the sidewalk, the tramp didn't move at all, not 136 / 233"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"one bit; he even seemed to get st iff like the tree did, only faster. \"On your knees,\" Cagliostro said sternly, and Rhoda obedi ently crossed the floor on her knees. \"Ask for it,\" he said. \"I beg you, master,\" she said, \"to stick your cock inside my c unt and fuck me and make me co me again and again and again. Oh, please, master.\" He lit a cigar, pretending to deliberate, and then blew smoke in her face. \"No,\" he said. \"I want you to suck me off. Nothing at all for you tonight.\" But a few nights later, when he was on top of her and inside her, and chanting in Tibetan, she suddenly thought she saw a kind of light around his head and two horns sprouting on his temple, and then it was like a million balloons bursting inside her and outside her at once, each balloon releasing a twinkle of light, each light a species of orgasm. \"R hoda Chief\" ceased to exist. Eternities later, reentering time, she found he was again at the bottom of the bed, head between her legs, licking ferociously. She fainted. He had a large library dealing with both stage magic and occultism, and Rhoda occasionally browsed in it. The next morning, while he was still asleep, she went back to it and searched in several volumes by Rosenkreuz, Therion, lambacchus, Prinn, Dee, and Kelly. \"The Mass of the Holy Ghost\" was variously described, but the Rose of Ruby was always identified with water and the first H in JHVH, the H of motherhood. The Cross of Gold had different meanings, too, but was chiefly fire and the J of JHVH, the J of fatherhood. Br inging the J and the H i? together, the wedding of Cross and Rose, produced the manifestation of the Holy Ghost in the form of a eucharist, which was th en consumed by the alchemist. M y God, she thought, the Cross is his cock and the Rose is my cunt; that's why he goes down on me afterward, as well as j ust before, \"The eucharist,\" old Prinn's words said blandly, \"is both male and female, both living and dead, both fire and water, and yet its creation involves no violation of nature but merely obedience to nature's own laws, together with the proper spiritual attitude.\" Professor Nosferatu of Columbia, an old friend of Rhoda's, listened rapt ly as she recited the words to him. \"That's not Tibetan, whatever he told you,\" he said. He repeated it with correct pr onunciation: \"IO PAN IO PAN PAN IO PANGENITOR IO PANPHAGE. It's an invocation of the god Pan in classic Greek. 'Io Pan, Io Pa n, Pan. Io Pan-All-Creator, Io Pan-All-Devourer.' \" He looked at her curi-ously. \"You know , I've heard some rather odd rumors about you and him. ...\" \"Whatever you've heard,\" she said with a faint smile, \"is probabl y true. I want you to give me the name of the best shrink you know. I want somebody to work on my head and help me to stay away from him.\" TRADE AIDS GALACTIC ARCHIVES: After the RICH Economy had revolutionized the lives and exp ectations of Unistaters on and off Terra, Eve Hubbard realized that the time was now ripe to ab olish poverty entirely. She did this by d eclaring every citizen a shareholder in the L5 space-cities and distributing National Dividends every year. Again, Hubbard's political genius was evident. Others who had proposed such a plan in the past (e.g., the engineers C. H. Douglas and R. Buckminster Fuller, the inventor Tom Edison , the semanticist Alfred Korz ybski, the physicist Frederic Soddy) had assumed such dividends would have to be \"money.\" This proposal, in that fo rm, always aroused heated opposition from the alpha males of the banking business, who understood well that an expanding money supply would lower the interest rate, seriously threatening their profits. Hubbard called her National Dividend tickets \"trade aids,\" a term devised by a public relations firm she had commissioned to make the idea palatable to domesticated primates. Trade aids were like money only in that they could be exchanged for commodities or services. They were unlike money in that they could not be loaned at interest; the bankers kept their monopoly on the interest market and were mollified. 137 / 233"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Trade aids were also unlike money in that they could not be hoa rded. Each ticket was dated, and lost value at 1 percent per month after the issue date, becoming totally valueless in on e hundred months, or eight years and four months. There was thus a built-in incentive to spend the trade aids as soon as possible. When the first trade aid dividends were di stributed, it turned out that even the poorest Unistat citizens had the equivalent of $80,000 for that year, in purchasing power, even though the tickets were not called \"money.\" Citizens with that much purchasing power have huge demand, in the economic sense of ability to buy. The economy expanded more rapidly than ever, with new businesses springing up continually, both on Terr a and in the space-cities. The rest of Terra was soon copying these innovations- the socialist countries most slowly and grudgingly. By 1995 starvation had been eliminated everywhere-just as had been th e goal of the Hunger Project, st arted by a California primate named Erhard back in the 1970s. By then Hubbard had been out of the White House for six y ears and busy again at genetics and longevity research. She often said to friends that her whol e political career had been merely an experiment in altering the parameters of primate sociobiology. TO CROSS AGAIN D ECEMBER 24, 1983: Simon Moon toked at his pipe, pulling the hash deep into his lungs, floating with it. December 23 had been a hell of a day. Ubu and Knight and the ot her guys from the FBI ha d been all over the shop demanding to know why the Beast couldn't tell them any more about the missing scientists and warning ominously that President Lousewart was Pe rsonally Concerned and so on and so forth: the usual governmental craperoo. Simon only stayed on the job for the sheer pleasure he got out of working with the Beast, fucking up the government from within. But even that pleasure was wearing thin, and he hopped a suborbital to New York just to be away from everything Washingtonian for the holidays. He exhaled a fog of cannabis molecules and returned hi s attention to his favorite bedtime reading, Brown's Laws of Form: To cross again is not to cross. It must have been the hash, but suddenly that simple axiomatic statement was fraught with new and urgent meaning. A knight's move on the word processor would switch F to N, the FBI to the NBI, abolishing Knightness in the process. Only the quantum inseparability principle would explain why Furbish Lousewart went away in the same rotation. Simon found that he had wandered or teleported from the bedroom to the toilet and was staring in absorption at the sink. The two handles, one saying H and the other C, seemed to ha ve enormous Cabalistic meaning, connected, perhaps, with the fact that Joe Malik had been Jo Malik before the collapse of the state vector. Of course, out-of-the-book experiences are not yet recognized by orthodox science. The parapsychologists who dare to speculate about such things ar e ritually torn asunder and dismembered by Marvin Garden s in the back pages of the Scientific A merican. Still, this does not discourage Simon Moon, who is, afte r all, a close associate of the Beast and hip to the programmer's trade secret that all that exists is information: everything else is mammalian sense-impression and thus hallucinatory. Besides, Simon is doing it right now: and can see in one instant, in the twinkling of an eye, the total contents of the novel, a miracle of mic rominiaturization in the frontal lobes, as th e metaprogramming circu it clicks into action. The novel was called The Universe Next Door. It existed-was bought and sold and loaned-in a super-continuum called the United States of America, which was Unistat enlarged into other dimensions. Everything in the novel was inevitable , as everything in the supercontinuu m containing the novel was inevitable. 138 / 233"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Everything that happened in Unistat had to happen, as everything in the United States of America had to happen. That which was above was precisely reflected in that which was below. To cross again was not to cross. \"So all right,\" Joe Malik said, staring at Simon through a triangle, \"are you just trying to scare me to death or do you have a message for me?\" Simon was on the balcony of Mary Margaret Wildeblood's apartment again and somebody was staring out at him in horror. \"My God, it's Bigfoot!\" Simon reentered the form , and contemplated it. Civilization was destroyed by nu clear holocaust in May 1984 because Furbish Lousewart was a certain kind of man and Franklin Delano Roosevelt Stuart was a cer tain other kind of man; and they were what they were because of genetic programs and accidental imprints and co nditioning and some learning, and because of the society arou nd them; and that society was the resultant of va rious conflicting historical a nd neurogenetic causes; and Lous ewart became President because of a thousand other factors, only one of which, the accident at Three Mile Isla nd in 1979, was itself the resultant of thousands of factors, including the usual struggles between the engineers and the financiers; and to explain Stuart you would have to start with the institution of slavery six thousand years earlier; and . . . Everything in the novel was inevitable , as everything in the supercontinuu m containing the novel was inevitable. And yet Simon had escaped from the novel. Although not a member of the Warren Belch Society, Simon Mo on was, of course, aware of the theory that there was a universe somewhere in which Bacon's major works were still attributed to somebody else. Simon, naturally, was not imaginative enough to conceive that in that universe Bacon had died of pneumonia while conducting experiments in refrigeration. In Simon's usual universe, the author of Novum Organum, The New Atlantis, King Lear, etc., had lived on to discover the inverse-square law of gravitation, and Isaac Newton was remember ed only as a somewhat eccentric astrologer. In another novel, midway between the old universe and the new, Simon himself had been shot dead by a Chicago cop during the Democratic Convention of 1968. Over there, Bacon had been bold enough to admit publicly his high rank in the Invisible College (Illuminati) and had been beheaded by James I for heresy. In that universe, not just civilization, but all li fe on Terra, came to a very hideous end in 1984, because the President was constipated one day and made the wrong decision. Their technology was so advanced that half the solar system went nova along with Earth. In the next universe Simon explored, we were saved because a red-haired Tantri c Engineer named Babs Lashtal gave the Prez a first-class Grade-A blow jo b in the Oval Room at 10 A.M., relaxed his tense muscles, pacified his glands, soothed his frustrations, and inspired him to act relatively sane for the re st of the day. He did not push the button, thereby preserving millions of species of living forms on Earth an d thousands of microscopic species on Venus. Babs Lashtal, of course, was regarded with contempt by all right-thinking people, who had no idea that they owed their lives to her skillful extraction of presidential spermatozoa by means of tender, gentle, gracefully rhythmic ki ssing, licking, and sucking of the presidential wand. Even if they had known about it, the right-thinking peop le would still say Babs should be ashamed of herself. The whole novel was rather didactic, Si mon decided. It was written only to prove a point: Never underestimate the importance of a blow job. It had been necessary to write such a novel b ecause the people over there were so ignorant and superstitious they still called Tantric Engineers \"whores\" and other degrading names. Every universe is inevitable; but there are as many univers es as there are probability matrices. The Metapro-grammer chooses which universe he will enter. There is a love that binds it all together, and that love is e xpressed in primate language as the love of a parent for a child, so Simon was not surprised to find Tim Moon pervading everything, or at least a kind of continuous Tim Moon potential that could be encoded again in another book or that could remain latent for long times, vaguely permeating every book.

Tell them all.\" And yet that seems to mark the experience as brain-generated: the style is Simon-pwer not Tim-pater even if the idea is most certainly something old Tim Moon would want to communicate. A collaboration perhaps between the part of Tim Moon that lives on in Simon's memory banks and the part that lives eternally in the Mind of the Author of Our Being. \"Hey, wait, before you turn the page and get into the next sect ion, I want to say one more thing.

THE GYPSY SWITCH The future exists first in Imagination, then in Will, then in Reality. -eve hubbard In spring 1963, while a Mr. Oswald was ordering a Car cano-Mannlicher rifle through the mail, Hugh Crane was in Cambridge, meeting with a famous psychol ogist who had recently been ejected from Harvard for original research and poor usage of the First Amendment. \"It takes you beyond the body rapture of marijuana?\" Crane asked. \"That's the least of it,\" said the psychologist. \"It takes you into something like the parallel universe of science fiction. I' m beginning to think they're parallel neurological uni verses or different styl es of head-games. ...\" \"Games?\" Crane said. \"Life-scripts, novels,\" the psycholog ist suggested, trying other metaphors. \"I dig it,\" Crane said quietly. \"How soon can I try this lysergic acid di-what's-it?\" \"Diethylamide.\" \"How soon?\" Crane repeated. \"You've got a very willing guinea pig, Dr. Frankenstein.\" Gary Grant had already told all the show-biz columnists that this magic chemical had chan ged his whole life for the better; Cagliostro, typically, went further and began urging its use on everyone. When the backlash st ruck he and the researcher who had initiated him and a few other res earchers and a couple of famous poets a nd novelists were widely denounced as \"high priests of the drug cult.\" He b ecame a favorite topic for the Sunday su pplements and the more ox-like men's magazines-any hack could make a lively story by rehashing his pot arrests, his morals busts, the rumors about other sexual oddities, his public advocacy of LSD an d anarcho-atheism, his mantra, \"There is no governor anywhere,\" and the increasingly popular speculation that his escapes were actually performed through black magic. It was a disappointment to all the people who loved hating him when he suddenly married the screen's best known sex goddess, Norma Nelson, and settled down to what appeared to be a very monogamous and un-newsworthy fidelity trip. N orma herself was delighted that all those rumors about his sa dism were obviously untrue. Their sex life was quite normal, and the Mass of the Holy Ghost was performed without restraints . She discovered, also, the basi c secret of his escapes: he never accepted a challenge at once, always jetting on \"urgent business\" to another part of the country and only taking languid notice of the wager, casua lly accepting it with total cool, a few days la ter.

The people who thought their own screws, bolts, and chains were used in Cagliostro's escapes were as mistaken as t hose who think the handkerchief with a hundred dollars that they give the gypsy for blessing is the same handkerchief that comes back to them. She also learned what alchemy was all about. \"I thought that was all superstition,\" she said once, pointing at his shelves of old books on the transmutation of elements, the Mass of the Holy Ghost, the Cabala, and the elixir of life. \"We do it almost every night.\" He smiled. \"You have the Cup and I have the Sword. Solve et coagula, divide and unite-that's why I have to go down on you again at the end. The mystic number 210-that means us two becoming one in the peak and the falling into the void.

The Magus is beth, the house or temple- that is, the path from Keser to Binah, the womb ...\" \"Do you really think you're going to live forever?\" she asked him once. \"If not,\" he said, \"I'll die trying.\" WISE GUYS AND NEBBISHES When Simon Moon was appointed Chief of the Computer Section at GWB-666, he immediately junked all the personnel tests then in use and replaced them with a one-question test of his ow n devising based on the Vlad Enigma. Applicants were simply told the story of Vlad and the monks by an interviewer and asked which monk Vlad impaled. Those who said Vlad impaled the lying flatterer were classified as nebbishes by Simon; they were the kind of fools who still, despite all evidence to the contrary, regarded government and those in authority as honest and just. They would tell the truth to superiors. They were hired at once. \"An office full of Eichmanns and Galleys,\" S imon said proudly. \"Not one of them will ever question an order or ask an embarrassing question.\" He could program endl ess anarchy, and they would never suspect it, because he was above them in the pack hierarchy. Those who said Vlad impaled the honest monk, on the other hand, were rejected for employment at GWB. Simon called them the Wise Guys and secretly arranged for a recruiter from the Discordian Soci ety to contact them later. They didn't believe a damned thing government said or did, had heretical opinions on dozens of subjects, and usually smoked dope. They emphatically did not belong in a bureaucracy. Sometimes Simon called the nebbishes Homo neophobia and the wise guys Homo neophilia. But that was in another novel. Simon didn't even know if he was still working with the Beast in this novel. He was becoming identified with the form. Some things remained constant under the transformation of the Knight move-Marvin Gardens still had his paranoia and his Vlad the Barbarian books, the missing scientists were still missing, Simon was still a math ematician (Mary Margaret had said so, at the party, even though he was only dimly there this time around). But some things had altered considerably-Josephine Malik was Joseph Malik, F.D.R. Stuart was an editor instead of a revolutionary, Hubbard was Pres ident instead of Lousewart.

After a few hours he realized this childbirth could never be natural. She accepte d the ether and he performed a Caesarean, only to find the infant, in turning, had strangled on its umbilical cord. \"Oh, God,\" she said when she awoke a nd the doctor told her. \"Oh, what a lousy God to make a world like this.\" Cagliostro was caught by a gaggle of reporters coming out of the hospital. \"How do you feel?\" was the first question. \"How the hell do you think I feel?\" \"Where will the service be held?\" \"There will be no religious service!\" Cagliostro shouted, hopping into a cab. \"Haven't you fools heard yet?-God is dead!\" It made headlines, and inspired editorials. One editorial-\"Bereavement Is No Excuse for Blasphemy - came to the attention of a fourteen-year-old boy, John Disk, who was tormente d by desires which his priests told him were evil. When Cagliostro returned to the clubs his act had changed considerably. The mild ly satirical patter between escapes had become bitingly mordant-\"He's a new Lenny Bruce!\"-and entire ly centered around his declar ed philosophy of anarchism and atheism. The escapes themselves cha nged each night, because he explained them and showed how they were done as the climax of every performance. \"Now you know how I fooled you,\" he would say. \"Try to figure out on your own how your congressmen and clergymen fool you. There is no restraint that isn't self-imposed: you are all absolutely free.\" The evening after the newspapers broke the story that he and Norma had joined Joan Baez in refusing to pay taxes, a drunk b egan heckling him during his act: \"Why don't you go back to Russia, you Commie dope fiend!\" That sort of thing. 142 / 233"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"\"No man living hates socialism more than me,\" Cagliostro said intensely.

The very next week he led the show-biz contingent among th e protesters at the 1968 Democratic Convention. A photograph of him being tear-gassed outside the Chicago Hilton is s till reprinted whenever an article about him appears. \"You've had it,\" his lawyer told him. \"As an officer of the cour t, I can't tell you what I really think. An uneth ical attorney, were he here, would frankly advise you and Norma to get the hell out of the country.\" But a change came over Unistat when Hube rt Humphrey, the new President, withdrew all the troops from Vietnam and began granting amnesty to political prisone rs. Cagliostro and No rma, in the midst of the return to liberalism, received suspended sentences for the acid, and he was not tried with the Chicago Nine for conspiring the convention riots. The IRS raided their bank account for the tax money instead of prosecuting them, and, by 1970, he was listed as one of ten top money-makers in show biz.

BUMP IN THE NIGHT Sput Sputnik was sleeping alone at last. Visions of dollar signs da nced in his head as he dreamed of a miniature sled full of barrels of beer.

Sput turned in the bed, moaning s lightly, as the brains danes chains came clanking back and forth again. And there was a Russian spy named Igor Beeforshot, and there was Minor Boul evard and Major Strasse, because every Pershing comes to Cricks, but the chains mains pains were clanking in and out again.

He was wide awake now, and he knew it was no dream. Something eldritch and unholy, right out of Goth ic fiction, was banging at his bedroom door. And then, for the first time in his life, he actually heard an eerie laugh, just like in the books, and It was actually coming through the door, walking right through solid wood, a greenish oldish spectral chain-rattling Thing. \"Jesus Nelly!\" Sput gasped. This sort of goings -on only happened in books, not in real life. \"Sput Sputnik,\" came the hollow voice (right out of an echo chamber, he thought). \"Yes?\" he breathed, wondering if his hairs were standing on end, too, in orthodox fashion. \"Sput Sputnik,\" said the Presence, \"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\" 143 / 233"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" THE EYE-ON-THE-PYRAMID A biological breakthrough will force a new militancy, a new crus ade. \"Make the world safe for Immortality,\" will be the cry. -segerberg, The Immortality Factor On May 1, 1976, Cagliostro and Norma we re in Mexico City on a vacation.

He wished they would get on to the Hallelujah Chorus. Marvin found a book he'd never finished- The Autobiography of Cagliostro the Great. He opened at random and started reading: \"Get a a job,\" my father said. Turning b ack, I saw the beggar falling to the ground, obviously fainting from starvation, but when he landed I knew, from his limpness, that it was more than a faint: that he was dead.

It was that simple; after all, who would dare to disobey the Voice of God Himself? God had been talking to Disk for nearly a year now. The Voice had been rather faint at first, and John even thought it was the Devil for a while, because it kept telling him he was damned. It said he was damned because he sinned sometimes when he was asleep. It said many silly and blasphemous things, but J ohn realized later that those weirdities had been the Devil trying to jam and confuse the communicati on, for when the Voice became strong and constant, there was no doubt at all that it was God. It told John that he had been especial ly selected because of his virtue and purity, and it never mentioned what happened sometimes when he was asleep. It told him he was the only tw enty-three-year-old male virgin in Unistat, the last true Christian not perverted by Pussycat and the Sexual Revolution and Black Magic. It told him he had earned much merit in Heaven for his selfless activities on behalf of the antiabor tion movement in the 1970s and White Heroes Opposing Red Extremism since then. It really loved John, and it never stoppe d telling him he was the most important man on the planet because he had been Selected. At first it didn't tell him what he had been Selected for; but every time he read a news story about some new blasphemy by Cagliostro the Great, the Voice of God would say, \"This man must be stopped.\" It was only toward the end of November that the Voice becam e increasingly explicit and said directly that he, John Disk, had been Selected to terminate the foul existence of the infamous devil-worshi per Cagliostro. Even then the Voice was almost drowned out by the voice of Rhoda Chief, the Scarlet Woman of Rock, chanting, \"Hickory dickory dock, I'd like to suck your cock,\" and other diabolical voices howling \"no wife, no horse, no mustache\" and \"sit down when you want to pee\" and other nonsense like that. The Devil was trying very hard to keep Disk from hearing and believing the Word of God; he wanted Disk to think he was going crazy. But the Voice of God got louder and more powerful and drowned out the others, and nobody who heard it, Disk knew, could ever doubt that a Voice so wise and powerful was anything else but that of the Lord God Himself. John made sure, of course. He spent a whole night praying, beati ng his back with a bundle of wet, stinging cords, just like he'd read in a book about the saints from the public library on Forty-second Street.

He would be on his way to Theology class at Fordham when suddenly all around would be thousands of hippies of all nations and a voice would be singing This is the dawning of the Age of Bavaria or he would be in a yellow submarine floating over a gigantic submerged pyramid or he would turn on the religious channel on the wall TV (the only one not full of smut and filth these days) and find Lind a Lovelace doing That Disgusting Thing to somebody named Marvin Gardens. But he continued to pray, and more and more The Voice of God would drown out all these nets and snares of Satan. Finally, on the morning of December 24, the Voice of God told him to go to Central Park West, where Cagliostro was living, and wait on the street. The Voice told him that as a reward he would be allowed to sit at the left hand of the Father i n Heaven-Jesus would keep the right hand but the Holy Spirit was being demoted to an auxiliary rank with the Virgin, so that he, John Disk, could be given the third highest position in all Paradise. When he got to the School Book Depository and walked toward the box seat in the Ford Theatre, sex mutilators and cattle educators howled at him and he realized th at the Devil was still trying to deceive him and he prayed harder and harder until it was clear that he was really on Central Park West and the man walking toward him, taking a morning constitutional, was the diabolical Cagliostro, a chameleon on a mirror, and the class of all classes that were similar to it, but he prayed and got the pistol out of his po cket, almost seeing the Grand Zombi and his sword, breathing harder now because the Devil was trying so hard to confuse him, and the interviewer wanted to know which monk Vlad impaled. John Disk held the gun in a trembling hand and looked into Cagliostro's icy eyes. \"Oy, have you picked the wrong Black Magician ,\" Cagliostro said in a stage-Yiddish accent. John Disk fired five times into the heart. The gate of Chinatown opened. MASS LANDING Justin Case was released from the flying saucer in the middle of Central Park. He was still rather befoozled mentally and unsteady on his feet, so he staggere d to the nearest bench and sat quietly, watching them take off. His wristwatch said 7:15- which seemed plausible. \"It is the morning of December 24,\" he said aloud. \"Tomorrow is Christmas. \" It seemed necessary, somehow, to get the simple things cleared up first of all, before dealing w ith the Mysteries. Things like this didn't happen to New York music critics. Th ey happened to farmers in Iowa or fishermen in Arkansas, or other such unsophisticated types, and, besides, they were hallucinations. Justin watched the flying saucer disappear across the sky, reminding himself that it was a hallucination. But still their words rang in his ears: 147 / 233"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"\"It is time for your species to join the Galactic Community.\" Justin finally got his mind and legs and various organs working together well enough to walk. He headed for Central Park West, hoping to find a cab. At Fifty-eighth Street he saw a newsstand. The headlines glared at him like Tibetan demons: WORLDWIDE UFO FLAP Mass Landings Reported And in a corner the inevitable su rrealist tag line to such a night: Mayor of Chicago Arrested Sodomy with Boar Hog Alleged As Justin stared at those remarkable me ssages, he heard five rapid pistol shots. From somewhere nearby music drifted toward him. He found himself absently putting the words to the melody: He knows when you've been bad or good So be good for goodness' sake He hastily bought a newspaper and hailed a cab. He was going to go right home and, for the first time in his life, break his rule against drinking in the morning. When he was drunk enough to stop trembling, it would be time to decide whether to report his experience or let those who had already talked take all the heat. CROWN POINT Crown Point Jail, in Indian a, was called \"the escape- p roof jail,\" when John Dillinger was brought there in May 1934. On the day Dillinger destroyed that name by escaping, an out-of-w ork vaudeville magician was begging in Central Park, New York. One thought burned in this man's head- With a little luck, I could have been a second Houdini- and that was what he was thinking as he fought the hunger cramps and laid his spiel on Tom Crane. When he felt the ground move in that big wobble of uncertain ty, he remembered suddenly the ever-branching Tree of Life as memories of Adam Weishaupt and Mohammed and insects and trees flooded through him, a million balloons bursting inside him and outside him at once, each ball oon releasing a twinkl e of light, each light part of the infin ite ladder of light, and he was watching himself die, in horror and ecstasy, through the eyes of a little boy. H ow did my karma ever land me here? he thought as he died, and the boy heard him thinking.

Where pr evious mass hysterias have occurred (e.g., the end- of-the-world manias of the Middle Ages, the Orson Welles Mart ian invasion broadcast of 1938) the cause was, obviously, the tensions, stresses, and fears of those ti mes. This latest eruption, coming in the midst of a time of progress, optimism, an d rising expectations, can only be explaine d by Freud's great discovery that opposites are equal to the prelogical unconscious mind [ambivalence principle]. In other words, high hopes, li ke high anxieties, can unleash the dreaming mind into the waking state. . . . -A.

The Mayor of Chicago \"hallucinated\" the b eautiful \"Princess Isis from Venus\" who se duced him, in his fantasy life, but the witnesses at the stockyar d insist that he was sodomizing a quite real hog at the time. . . . Mars is as inhospitable to life as Venus, but a prominent music cr itic has told this author, in private, of an abduction by lit tle green Martians out of 1930s science fiction, but this obviously hallucinatory experience does not help us understand how the man was transported from his apartment on Twenty-third Street to the middle of Central Park, where he heard the shots of a murder that never occurred. . . .

Gilhooley, M.D. UFO REPORTER, JANUARY 1985: As the \"Christmas Miracle\" co ntinues to accelerate worldwide, it becomes more obvious than ever that the old concept of aliens coming here in spaceships just cannot account for it. Ev en those most committed to the spaceman theory must admit, in the light of the recent events , that the sciences invol ved in what is being done to the human race are primarily psychic or parapsychological. If space beings are doin g it, whatever it is, they must be doin g it by what I can only call, vaguely, \"psychotronic technology,\" and they could be doing it, for all we know, from their home planets, without physically traveling at all. By the same to ken, we have no need to posit spacemen at all, since whoever or whatever is doing this could be as close as the psychology department of some obscure univer sity or the mind-control sector of any Intelligence Agency. . . . Human minds are being manipulated on a massive scale; that is all we know, and all theories about the Manipulators- terrestrial or extrat errestrial-are mere guesswork. . . . -J. Lacombe, Ph.D. UFO REPORTER, MARCH 1985: . . . The idea that the \"Christm as Phenomenon\" is being done to us by some Agency (terrestrial or otherwise) is based on the categories of Indo-European grammar and Ar istotelian logic, which modern physics has long known to be inadequate. A Taoist or a Hopi Indian, for instance, wi th a different semantic \"set,\" might rega rd the events as a cosmic happening or growth process, without trying to isolate out one part of the universe as the \"cause\" and thus relegating the rest of the universe to the dependent position of \"the effects.\" Modern quantum theory, at least since Bell's Theorem (1964), would suggest strongly that these holistic Chin ese-Amerindian concepts ar e more accurate maps of wh at is happening than the linear A-causes-B sequences of Aristotelianism. . . . Does this mean that we abandon the s earch for a \"cause\"? Not at all. It me rely implies that looking for humans or superhumans who did it is as fruitless as the medieval search to expl ain each oddity as the work of angels or demons.

Charlatans, jongleurs, wandering minstrels, stag e magicians, etc., on all primitive plan ets, employ a device known as a Trick Top Hat. This appears to be an ordinary hat, and looks empty to the audience, but it actually contains a pouch out of which all sorts of amazing things can be made to appear-rabbits, yards of bright-colored cloth, glasses of water, and in general whatever the magician wishes to produce fo r the delight and amazement of his audience. This ritual, like all rituals and religi ous visions or ecstasies, is actually a memory of the future, but there is no way for primitives to understand that. Consider the epistemological plight of the Terran primates at the time of this anci ent Romance. They knew that they were made of molecules, which were made of atoms, which were made of subatomic pa rticles, which were expressions in space- time of quantum probab ility matrices. This knowledge, al as, was so recent that it had ne ver been integrated into their philosophies, or into the rules of their social games, like religions, politics, economics, etc. Their whole social reality-tun nel was based on prequantum superstition and ignorance. The sociological nexus was Euclidean-Aristotelian-Newtonian; even Maxwell and Einstein had only been digested by a few. Over twenty-five hundred years earlier, one mutant primate, La o-Tse, had written: \"The greates t is within the smallest.\" Less than one-one hundredth (0.01) of one percent of the Terran primates were capab le of understanding this before 1984. They looked for causality everywhere else : some known as astrologers scanned the di stant stars; others known as Marxists scanned economics, etc. They knew that the physicists understood causality better than any other group on their planet, but few of them, even among the p hysicists, realized how quantum theory applie d to their own behavior. Quantum psychology did not begin to emerge until the 1990s. What was known in their planet as Bell' s Theorem-an elementary, ki ndergarten-level discovery routinely divined on every planet at about the same time as atomic energy and space travel are beginning-wa s only twenty years old among them and barely understood even by the physicists. The few quantum th eorists, such as Sarfatti, who dared to speculate about \"macrocosmic quantum effects\"- large systems engaged in quan tum-jumping-were usually dismissed as Romantics by their colleagues, despite the fact th at each stage of metamorphosis of every livi ng creature, including the Terran primates themselves, was obviously a quantum leap. The primate Mystics, most of them brai n-damaged, endlessly told the other prim ates to \"look within.\" Most primates assumed, in primitive Aristotelian fashion, that what was within was some gaseous entity which they called \"mind\" or \"soul.\" Unable to find such an abstractio n, they either gave up in despair or took their negative results as a positive revelation and became adherents of the \"no-mind\" or \"no-ego\" philo sophy of Buddha and David Hume. Of course if they had truly looked within, scientifically, th ey would have found that their thoughts, percepts, and reality- tunnels were determined by the structure of the primate nervous system, which was determined by the genetic or molecular design of the primate evolutionary script, which was determined by the laws of quantum biophysics. That is concretely, their brains were shaped by cells shaped by molecules shaped by atoms shaped by quantum probabilities. Since the quantum connection is nonlocal, it is inevitable that introspection and meditation could discover no \"ego\" within; within and without are Euclidean parameters that do not appl y to the quantum world. But the primates could not understand this. When, due to trauma, masochistic re ligious practices, alkaloid herbs, or me re statistical chance, their neuroatomic 150 / 233"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"circuitry propelled them into Quantum Consciousness, they could not conceptua lize that they were outside space-time entirely. Space and time, they sti ll thought even after Einsein, were as solid as walls. They could only imagine, primate fashion, that they were traveling in space and out of their bodies; they called it \"astral projection\" and devised numerous primate superstitions about it. Similarly, when one of them would begin to learn how to use the metaprogramming circuits in the forebrain, they could not conceptualize that they were peering into alternative quantum probability matrices. Instead, they devised a whole mythology of heavens, hells, purgatories, astral planes, fairy lands, demons, gods, angels , UFOnauts, etc., to make Euclidean \"maps\" of such quantum experiences. We should be charitable to the Terran prim ates. All planets have gone through such superstitious stages before the HEAD Revolution is complete among them. When the neuroatomic circuitry, only occasionally released during most of their history, began to function full y in 1984, the primates could not begin to understand what was happening, for all of the above reasons . They were suddenly in communication, not just with one reality-tunnel, but with al l possible reality-tunnels. They could see quantum probabilities leading to all possible futures, but they were unable to conceptualize what they saw. The primate brain, always quick to cover ignorance with a primate archetype, projected all their traditional superstitions on what was happening. Terra was a weird and crazy place for severa l years. Giant lobsters with ray guns , Tibetan demons, Ignatz the anarchist mouse, and dozens of other fantas y figures were likely to appear at any time, an y place, even in churches during funerals or at top-secret governmenta l meetings. The joke \"We're all living in a surr ealist novel\" gained wide currency, although few realized how close to the truth it was. The intelligence-raising drug NEURO began to change things a b it after it appeared in 1988. People's fantasies gradually became more sophisticated and phi losophical, and their reality-t unnels accordingly adapted. With the publication of Sirag's General Field Theory in 1993, the smarter primates immediately realized what was really o ccurring on their planet and throughout the cosmos. They gradually comprehended that all their myths had been memories of the future, available to them through the nonlocal activity of the quantum waves making up their brains. Age-old religious visions of Immortality, for instance, they recognized as precapitulations of the inevitable end product of their current longe vity research. The \"magic carpets\" and \"seven-league boots\" they alr eady had; the New Heaven and New Earth they we re rapidly building. The superhuman heroes and heroines of romantic fi ction were the humans they were themselves becoming as the HEAD Revolution accelerated them toward greater intellectual efficiency, more flex ible emotional equilibrium, neurosomatic rapture, and metaprogramming wisdom. They understood that the Bodd hisattva's Vow, common among the neurosom atic-circuit Eastern primates, was no idle fantasy, either, even t hough it promised to redeem all sentient beings. With time-travel made possible through the General Field Theory, they could change any past probability wave, creating a new universe where each en tity would ta ke the best possible path instead of whatever sad paths it had taken to arouse their compassion and intervention. They understood the words, previously totally opaque, of the Jewish mystic, Jesus, who had said, \"All th at I do, ye shall do, also; and more.\" They understood that ever y political and mystical id eal of freedom, however aborted in it s first appearances, was fated to be achieved in some form, in the infinite nonlocal cosmos opening before them. They understood that the \"onene ss with earth\" so many had discovered in the previo us two decades had only been the overture to the discovery of nonlocality, as they shared more and more in oneness with all that is, and all that can be. And they understood, of course the time-honored allegory of th e Trick Top Hat, which was just a symbol of the brain. This ritual was passed on from generation to generation, since it re presented the greatest treasure in the universe, which is shared by all and belongs to none: the faculty of creativity, partially un leashed in each sentient being, fully released at the proper Galactic-genetic time by the HEAD Revolution.

According to her usual procedure, Bonny began by flipping through her notebook. This usually served to fructify her imagination, but that day proved rather sterile. Items which had already been used were cro ssed out with large X's and what was left was weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable. There was literally nothing timely or exciting enough for a lead. Bonny was only stumped for a minute; then she remembered the ancient maxim of the great pi oneer of modern journalism, Charles Foster Hearst: \"If there isn't any news, invent some.\" Ms. Benedict, whose hair would have been gr ay if she hadn't decided it was more ch ic to bleach it pure platinum-white, had lasted in the news game for forty years. Sh e did not lack the facu lty of imagination. Bonny inserted a fresh sheet in the type writer and began at once, trusting her y ears of experience to guide her. What emerged was: Who is the man in Hong Kong who looks exactly like Lee Harvey Oswald? Believe it or not, darlings, that question is causing a lot of excitement among the members of th e new Senate Committee on Congressional Committees on Assassinations. In case you forgot, they'r e the ones who are trying to find out why the various Congressional Committees on Assassinations couldn't find out anythi ng. What they're asking each other is: Co uld the man in Hong Kong really be Oswald? And, if so, who was the double that got shot in Dallas? Doesn't it make your heads swim??? That was what was known as a fa il-safe item. If (as was likely) the Senate Committee simply ignored it rather than fan the flames of rumor, many readers would believe it on the grounds that it had been printed and not denied. If, on the other hand, the Committee did deny it, even more people would believe it. A 1981 psychological survey had shown that 67 percent of the population experienced uncer tainty, indecision, suspicion, or downright paranoia whenever they saw the words \"government denial\" in print. Bonny went on to use up the not-t otally dreary items in he r notebook, jazzing each one enough to give it a coat of sparkle, or at least of tinsel. But she stil l needed a zinger for the closin g. She followed the sa ge advice of the proph et Hearst one more time and wrote: Wasn't that Furbish Lousewart of the Purity of Ecol ogy Party eating steak and drinking Manhattans (made with Southern 156 / 233"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Comfort, my dears!) at Sardi's last night? What would the Party regulars think of th is flagrant disregar d of POE principles? Bonny, in her youth, had been a disciple of the famous femi nist and psychologist Alberta Einstein. It was Ms. Einstein, in her epoch-making Neuropsychology, who introduced the concept that every brain constructs a diff erent \"island-reality\" from the billions of signals it receives every min ute. This concept had revolu tionized the social sciences and even led Heisenberg to propose a similar relativity principle in physics. Bonny kn ew that the POE people lived in an island-reality where eating meat and drinking fermented spir its were atrocities comparable to ax murder or Burgering in the well. This item would make them hopping mad. A columnist's career depends on amusing most of her readers mo st of the time and making some of them hopping mad some of the time. The owner-publisher of the New York News-Times-irc was Polly Esther Doubleknit, relict of the late Dacron Doubleknit, the leisurewear king. When the leisurewear fad had peaked in the 1970s, Dacron had shrewdly used the cash flow to \"diversify,\" as his accountant called it. Engulf a nd Devour, his competitor s called it. When he died Dacron owned over a thousand retail stores coast to coast, a tapioca mine in Nutley, N. J. (a bad investment, that one, suggested by a plausible but Machiavellian midget), a large hunk of Canadian forestland , three South American governments (his leisurewear was thereafter made with very cheap labor), sixteen Congresspersons, three senators, a shipyard in Yellow Springs, Ohio (suggested by Eva Gebloomenkraft), seven state legislatures to gether with four other whorehouses in Nevada, and the New York News-Times-u.s.w. Dacron died of a heart at tack at fifty-two, brought on by anxiety about the amount of political corruption he was involved in. Dacron did not like to bribe public officials and hated the size of the bribes they all want ed, because he had been raised a Presbyterian. Unfortun ately for him, he lived in an age of Terminal Bureaucracy and there was absolutely no way, no matter how many lawyers he hired, to find out if his corporations we re, in any given instance, in vi olation of the law. There were too many laws, and they were written in language that guara nteed maximum ambiguity all around, so that lawyers (who wrote the laws) could always get jobs proving that the laws meant Yes, if they were being paid to prove that, or that the laws meant No, if they were being paid to prov e that. Dacron never found out, for sure, whether he was one of the businessmen in the country operating 100 percent legally all the time or if he wa s in violation of so many statutes that he was subject to ove r a thousand years in prison; no two lawyer s ever would agree about th at. So Dacron bribed as ma ny officials as possible to protect himself, and then gradually worried himself to death about the bribes being discovered someday. Polly Esther, finding herself the heir of Dacron's farraginou s empire, quickly appointed professional executives to manage most of it; but she took over the newspaper personally. She was a fan of a TV show called Low Grant and rather fancied herself as becoming another Mrs. Pynchon. Mrs. Pynchon was the publisher of the paper on the Low Grant show. She was tough enough to eat barbed wire and spit tacks, but she was also cool and elegant. Polly Esther wanted to be like that. She also had a secret desire to be the other Mrs. Pynchon, the wife of the noveli st. She had read one of Pynchon's novels once while dieting, and maybe she had used just a little bit too many of those di et pills, because she believed every word of it. She was still convinced that the baskets on the street saying WASTE mean t We Await Silent Tristero's Empire. N aturally, Polly Esther believed both of Bonny Benedict's fictio ns of the day. She had long suspected that both Oswald and Lousewart were agents of Silent Tristero's Empire. Polly Esther was about forty-two but she could easily pass for thirty-two. This was because she was very rich. Once a year Polly Esther went to a ranch in Nevada which looked like a luxury motel and treated its guests like the inmates of a concentration camp. They fed Polly Es ther on a diet what would barely sustain life and tasted horrible. They made her exercise several hours a day. A brutal staf f insulted her, mocked her, bullied her, an d got her back on her feet again, running , every time she thought she'd drop from exhaustion. They also shot her full of Gerovitol, methamphetamines, and vitamins three times a day. They charged her fifty-five hundred dollars. Some of this actually had a slight effect on her body, but most of it was directed at her mind. She came out of this two-week ordeal, each year, convi nced that she had suffered enough to deserve to be beautiful for another fifty weeks. She was indeed beautiful, and had been a fl aming redhead for so long that only a few people in Xenia, Ohio, remembered her as a dark-haired girl who had to leave town because of a scandal in the local Baptist church choir. The robot who traveled under the name \"Frank Sullivan\" was in New York the next morning and saw Bonny Benedict's column. \"Oh, Burger, Lourde, and corruption,\" he muttered, the newspaper trembling in his hands. 157 / 233"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"He immediately canceled his business in New York and hopped an orbital to Washingto n, where he leapt in to a cab, sped to N aval Intelligence, and galloped into the office of Admiral Mounty (\"Iron Balls\") Babbit. Babbit was in charge of \"Dungeon and Dragon\" operations, in cluding the \"Sullivan\" matter; th ese were machinations so murky that they were not even known to th ose normally cleared for covert operations. \"How the holy Potter Stewart did she get hold of this?\" pseudo-Sullivan demanded, waving Bonny Benedict's column. Babbit stopped breathing for a minute as he read the Second Oswald item. \"Jesus and Mary Christ,\" he said finally, in a hollow tone. 'T he Briggsing Bryanting Frankel, she must have a source in the CIA. Those mother-Stewarting sons-of-bitches, they 11 do anything to blow one of our operations.\" This was typical of Old Iron Balls, as his men called him. He was convinced that everything malign emanated from Central Intelligence over in Alexandria. They spent all their time, he believed, plotting to discredit Naval Intelligence, and all because a high CIA official had once ca ught him, Mounty Ba bbit, in an intimate moment with the CIA man's mistress. \"Those bastards,\" he repeated in a tone as cold as official charity. \"I 'd like to blow that Burger-house in Alexandria off the face of the earth and every li mp-wristed Briggsing Bryan ting Harvard egghead in it.\" But that was only one level of Old Iron Balls's mind- the pub lic level. Much deeper, he was already plotting various scenarios that resulted from the sudden deaths of Bonny Benedict or \"Frank Sullivan.\" Of course, Babbit did not for a moment contemplate assassination in the vulgar sense; there ha d been more than enough of that sort of thing back in the sixties and it had made all sorts of trouble for everyone in the Intelligence game. Babbit was guided by a maxim now universally accepted in the cloak-and-dagger business although originally formul ated by Beria of the NKVD: \"Any damned fo ol can commit murder. Any halfway trained operat ive can arrange convincing suicide. It takes an artist to manage an authentic natural death.\" Pseudo-Sullivan had a larger than average share of ESP, as did many persons in the Intelligence game. \"You know,\" he said casually, \"I've left Cert ain Papers in a Certain Place to be opened in case of sudden death ...\" \"Oh, you needn't worry about anything like that,\" Babbit said hastily. \"Why, you're one of our most valuable um men. We wouldn't dream of. . .\" Blah-blah-blah. It was a set speech, for occasions like this. He was thinking of Bonny Benedict and of her publisher, th at hoity-toity rich Frankel-Briggser, Polly Esther Doubleknit. The next fuse ignited by the Oswald-in-Hong-Kong story was in the frontal cortex of a balding, nervous man named Justin Case, who was living in a sociological treatis e. That is, people made him so anxious th at he shielded hims elf from them with a cocoon of words and concepts which had gradually become more real to him than the people were. He was a heavyweight Intellectual. Justin Case had more Moral Concern than was good for a man. He worried about racism and sexism and imperialism and injustice and the general cussedness of his species; he agonized over each and every person on the planet who might be getting a raw deal; if you put enough martinis in him, he would start singing \"Joe Hill\" and \"We Shall Overcome\" and \"Which Side Are You On?\" and other old Labor and Civil Rights songs. N aturally, Case was the editor of a Liberal Magazine. The magazine was called Confrontation and had been started by a mad Arab named Joe Malik, who abandoned it in 1968 to enter a Trappist monastery. Malik had been traumatized by th e Democratic Conven tion that year and told everybody he intended to spend the rest of his life in vehement and continuous prayer. Malik left behind a note which still hung on the bulletin board at Confrontation. It said: Qol: Hua Allahu achad; Allahu Assamad; lam yalid walam yulad; walam yahun lahu kufwan achad. N obody at Confrontation could read Arabic, but they all liked to stop and look at the not e occasionally, wondering what it meant. 158 / 233"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The stockholders had appointed Case to th e editorship, after Malik retreated to th e cloister, because Justin had as much righteous indignation as the mad Arab but was not so flaky. By spring 1984, Case had 120 bound volumes of books, articles, and press clippings about the J. F.K. assassination, since he was still Righteously Indignant about the palpably obvious cover-up involved in the Warren Report. The day that pseudo-Sullivan wigged out over Bonny Benedict's contribution to the mythology of the assassination, Case calmly clipped that item and added it to his file. Three-quarters of the other material in Case's file was also fictitious. One-third of this disi nformation had been generated by Intelligence Agencies-domestic, foreign, and extraterrestrial-a s covers or screens for their own activities in and around Dallas in 1963. Another third had been produced by sincere, dedicated, sometimes avid conspiracy buffs, weaving their own webs of confusion as they searched fo r the elusive truth. The last third had been created, like the Bo nny Benedict item, by j ournalists following Hearst's advice about what to do when there was no news. Anybody trying to find out \"what really happened\" from this collection of mythology would be so confused that the significant fact of the extraterrestrial intervention would never be apparent. Case did not suspect any of this. He love d his J.F.K. file. He was convinced that someday the crucial piece would come to him, he would insert it into the file, and the whole jigsaw would make sense. He never realized that the one detail wh ich gave everything away was that whil e Oswald was firing from the sixth-floor window he was also having a Coke on the second floor and mingling with the crowd in the street. Like most liberals, Justin Case lacked imagination and never took seriously all the evidence of extraterrestrial activity on earth during the past forty years. Case was currently having an affair w ith the Hollywood act ress Carol Christmas. Carol was renowned among the heterosexual male population for having the biggest Brownmillers since Jayne Mansfield; so far only women and a few Gay men had noticed that sh e could also act. Carol had been married four times. She had had thre e abortions. Like other famous Beauties, she was always dieting, and hence, a little bit high-strung. She was also a disciple of General E. A. Cr owley, the eccentric English explorer who had discovered the North Pole and claimed there was a hole there lead ing down to the center of the Earth. Carol devoutly believed Crowley's yarn that there was a whole civilization down there, inside the Earth, run by green-skinned women. Carol believed this because she had a great artistic fa ith in the principle of balance. In her probability continuum-in the series of quantum eigenstates that had crystalized into her universe-the whol e outside of the planet seemed to be run by white-skinned males. It was only fair that the inside should be run by green-skinned females. Carol was having three other affairs at the same time as her amour with Justin Case. There was a hairdresser in Hollywood (bi, not Gay) who was very talented at Bryanting and Briggsing- two arts at which totally straight men, in Carol's opinion, were usually a bit clumsy. There was also Fran9ois Loup-Garou, the painter, in Pa ris, who adored her madly, as only a painter can adore a woman. And there was a bitter but brilliant Black novelist in Chicago named Franklin Stuart. Justin Case knew all about these other amours; after all, he read Bonny Benedict's column every day. Bonny kept the world informed about which celebrities were Potter Stewarting each other. She did this in a way that was perfectly clear to every reader but totally without any cl ear meaning in a court of law, in case somebody got irritated and tried to sue her. What she did was to write something like \"Hollywood sexpot Carol Christmas and Black novelist Frank Stuart are an item these days.\" Everybody knew what \"an item\" meant. When Bonny wrote that a couple were \"a hot item\" many of her readers were mildly puzzled, but assumed she was insinuating some fantastic sexual acrobatics. Actually, it only meant that Bonny was trying to avoid stylistic monotony; occasionally, she even switched it to \"a to rrid item,\" which led to even more lascivious fantasies for some of her readers. Justin Case didn't object to Carol Christ mas's other affairs because he accepted it as a fact of life that actors are hypersexe d, j ust as coal miners are prone to black lung disease and novelists to booze and weird drugs. Besides, jealousy was a sign of p ossessiveness, and possessiveness was illib eral. And, anyway-as he usually concluded his ruminations on this subject, 159 / 233"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"during the infrequent moments when he thought of it at all-Ca rol's career kept them apart most of the time, and he was not so naive as to expect somebody of her youth and beauty to resist all temptations. And it was the 1980s, wasn't it? Actually, Case was a bit of an unconsci ous psychic-that is, he was aware of quantum probability waves, although not consciously. He sensed that there were approximately 1050 universes in wh ich he had lusted after Carol and never got into her Frankel even once. That unconscious psychic knowledge kept him content with this universe, where he was her part- time lover. Carol Christmas had starred in the first hard -core porn movie to wi n the Academy Award, Deep Mongolian Steinem Job. The film had been directed by Stanley Kubrick, after he read a satirical novel in which the au thor had imagined what would happen if Kubrick set out to make a serious and even artistic porn film. Despite the success of Deep Mongolian Steinem Job, most humans still did not realize that all fantasies tend to become realities, in one universe or another. Carol did realize it, however. She wa s currently involved in approximately 250,000,000 sex acts every hour. REAL HOUSES, REAL OFFICES The sensuous California sun hung low and sultry over San Francisco, turning everybody's mood in a low and sultry direction. It was a day when anything could happen. Cops help ed old ladies across the street. Bankers gave loans to people who really needed them.

And a mysterious hand scrawled \"The enormous tragedy of th e dream nor dashed a thousand kim\" on the wall of the Van N ess Street entrance of Orgasm Research. Dr. Frank Dashwood (dum dum de!

At nine-oh-one Dr. Dashwood passed through the solid oak door saying in gold letters: FRANCIS DASHWOOD, M.D. PRESIDENT There was nothing urgent on the memo pad, so Dashwood began opening the incoming mail leisurely. Dear Dr. Dashwood, I am writing to you as a Sex Expert because I don't know where else to turn. I alr eady wrote to Ann Lan- ders, but she just told me to take cold showers.

My sweetheart and I, fortunately, have found that oral sex satisfies us fully-I Marshall her Frankel and then she gives me a Steinem Job. But this creates a terrible legal conundrum, since she lives across the Mississippi River in Iowa and I am a c itizen of Illinois. Iowa has a very strict law against oral se x, which they classify as sodomy (due to a mistranslation of th e Old Testament, I believe). Thus, we can't have sex in Iowa. N ow, Illinois has had no anti-sodomy statutes since the 1960s, so you might think our problem can be solved by having sex in Illinois. Unfortunately, she can't afford to quit her job in Iowa, and thus every time she tr avels across the river to have sex with me, she is crossing a state line, which makes me vulnerable under the Mann Act. Is there any possible solution to this legal double-bind? Dr. Dashwood was intrigued. He began thinking of topol ogical transformations, non-Euc lidean geometries, Wheeler's wormholes in superspace . . . But then he realized he was Romanticizin g, just because the puzzle had sparked his imagination. In ordinary four-dimensional Heisenberg space-tim e, there was no way out of the paradox: If the writer crossed the river, he and his lady were committing sodomy in Iowa, and if the lady crossed the river, they were violating the Mann Act in Illinois. Logicians dream up such Strange Loops, Dashwood reflected, just to make games for other logicians; but lawyers create them to make more jobs for lawyers. Dashwood scrawled, \"Tell him his lady better damned well find a job in Illinois.\" N ext. Dear Dr. Dashwood, Once there was a man who was condemned to live on th e moon. He knew the punishment was just, because he hated his father and such a sin deserves an extrem e penalty. Nonetheless, his isolation was terrible and there were times when he thought his heart would break, just because he could never hear a human voice again. Well, he made the best of his cruel situation. He began se nding messages from the moon, telling everything he knew about life on earth-all the joys and agonies and struggles, \"the hor ror and the boredom and the glory\" of the long climb upward from the slime to higher and hi gher consciousness. The people back on earth loved these signals, which contained so much of life's drama, and they praised him ex travagantly, and that gave him some comf ort through the long years of his exile. Once, however, he sat down and made a message about his own loneliness, telling how it feels to be separated from humanity by 250,000 miles of Dead Silence. He called it the Hammerklavier Sonata.

Dr. Dashwood began doing pranayama immediately. \"Send . . . him .. . in ... right . . . away . . .\"he said between deep breaths. The agent, whose name was Tobias Knight , had a walrus mustache and a cheery eye; nobody ever looked less threatening. Dr. Dashwood still regarded him with a wary resp ect, as a large and dangerous mammal. This was the normal attitude since the 1983 Anti-Crime, Anti-Subversion Omnibus bill had entitled the Bureau to conduct random wiretapping on all citizens rather than just on known criminals and known subversives. (\"If we only watch the already r ecognized enemies of society,\" the author of this bill-Senator Uriah Snoop-had argued, \"who knows what hidden monkey business might be festering in dark places to rise up and stab us in the back like a snake in the grass?\") Knight was brisk and (seemingly) honest. A prominent scient ist-Dr. G. W. C. Bridge-had disappeared and, since no kidnappers had demanded ransom and no evidence indicated that he had defected to Russia or China, the Bureau was investigating even the most tenuous leads. \"Since you attended Miskatoni c University in Massachusetts at the same time as Dr. Bridge, we're curious about anything even that far back which might shed light on why he'd want to vanish ... if he did vanish voluntarily. ...\" Dr. Dashwood created an expression of pu zzlement. \"I hardly knew George,\" he said slowly. \"He was just about the only Black student at Miskatonic, of course, and that made him um highly visible, but we neve r became friends. ...\" They beat around the bush for about ten minutes; then Dashwood shot abruptly from the hip. \"I know who really was close to Washy,\" he said, looking inspired! \"Pet e Simon, the geologist. Why don't you get in touch with him? I think the last I heard he was with the government ...\" Knight looked perfectly innocent. \"Peter Simon,\" he said slowly, making a note. \"Geologist.\" But Dashwood knew: the agent was a shade too bland, too innocent. Th e Bureau was aware that Dr. Simon had vanished also. Maybe they were on the track of the whole Miskatonic Group. Dr. Dashwood experienced a thrill of pu re adrenaline.

Actually, Hrumph Rumph (or whatever the Continental Op 's name was) was quite right about Tobias Knight. Knight was the first pentuple agent in the history of espionag e. He was simultaneously employed by the FBI, the CIA, the KGB, the Bavarian Illuminati, and a mysterious person who claimed to represent the Earth Monitoring section of Galactic H.Q. He was not in this five-dimensional matrix of intrigue fo r the money, however. Tobias Kn ight was actually a frustrated sociologist and a would-be historian. He had the Scientific Spirit, or, as he might have stated in the vernacular, he wanted to know \"what the hell was really going on.\" In an age of secret police machinations an d conspiracies of all sorts, the only way he could hope to find out what was \"really going on\" was to be involved in as many cl andestine operations as possible. Knight knew what most people only vaguely suspected- that Intelligence Agencies engage in both the collection of valid signals (information) and the promiscuous dissemination of fake signals (disinformat ion). They collected the information so that they could form a fairly accurate pict ure of what was really going on; they sp read the disinformatio n so that all their competitors would form gr ossly inaccurate pictures. They did this because they knew that whoever could find out what the hell was really going on possessed an advantage over th ose who were misinformed, confused, and disoriented. This game had been invented by Joseph Fouche, who was the chief of the secret police under Napoleon. British Intelligence very quickly copied all of Fouche's tact ics, and surpassed them, because an intell igent Englishman is always ten times as mad, in a methodical way, than any Frenchman. By the time of the First World War, Intelligence Agencies everywhere had created so much disinformation and confusion that no two hist orians ever were able to ag ree about why th e war happened, and who double-crossed whom. They couldn't discover whether the war had been plotted or had just resulted from a series of blunders. They couldn't even decide whether the two conspiracies to assassinate Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary (which triggered the war) ha d been aware of each other. By the time of the Second World War, the \"Double-Cross Syst em\" had been invented-by British Intelligence, of course. This was the product of such minds as Alan Turing, a brilliant homosexual mathematician who (when not working on espionage) specialized in creat ing logical paradoxes other mathematicians couldn't solve, and lan Fleming, whose fantasy life was equally rich (as indi cated by his later James Bond books), and Dennis Wheatley, a man of exceptionally high intelligence who happened to believe that an international society of Satanists was behind every conspiracy that he didn't invent himself. By the time Turing, Fleming, Wheatley a nd kindred British intellects had perfected the Double-Cross System, the science of lying was almost as precise as Euclidean geometry, and nearly as lovely to the detached observer. What the Double-Cross experts had invent ed was the practical political applications of the Strange Loop. In logic or cybernetics, a Strange Loop is a set of propositions that, while valid at each point, is so cons tructed that it leads to an unresolvable paradox. The Double-Cross people drove the Germ ans bonkers by inventing disinformation systems that, if believed, were deceptive, but if doubted led to a second disi nformation system. They enjoyed this work so much that, at times, they invented Triple Loops, in which if you believed th e surface or cover, you were being fooled; and if you looked deeper, you found a plausibl e alternative, which seem ed like the \"hidden facts,\" but was just another scenario created to fool you; and, if you were persistent enough, you would find beneat h that, looking every bit like the Naked Truth, a third layer of deception and masquerade. These Strange Loops functioned especially well because th e Double-Cross experts had ear ly on fed the Germans the primordial Strange Loop, \"Most of your agents are working for us and feeding you Strange Loops.\" Many German agents, it later turned out, had managed to coll ect quite a bit of accurate in formation about the Normandy invasion; but many others had turned in equally plausible information about a fictitious Norwegian invasion; and all of them were under suspicion, anyway. German Intelligence might as well have made its decisions by tossing a coin in the air. Tobias Knight kept a safe-deposit box in Switzerland in which he stored, one sentence at a time usually, stray bits of true information he had managed to glean from the blizzard of deceptions in which he lived. The first note in the box, for instance, said: The CIA was actually founded in 1898. I haven't found out yet why they made it public in the forties. 164 / 233"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The second note was even stranger. It said: Special and General Relativity are both true!!! This had been provoked by a profound search through old scie nce books and magazines, after Knight discovered that most of the Official Science released to the general public was actually 97 percent mythology, intended to serve as a cover or screen for the real science used by Unistat to frustrate its enemies. There were lots of other notes like that- Maxwell's equations seem sound, I don't think there's any flummery in Newtonian mechanics, and so on-but others were far weirder. Such as: Velikovsky was right. And: A ll the flying saucer books, pro and con, are written by Mounty Babbit's department in Naval Intelligence. And: There are robots among us, And: Some of what the Birchers say is corr ect: the whole govern ment was taken over by Communists about forty years ago. Knight had a fantasy that someday he would turn these notes over to an Objective Historian who would then write a book informing the future of what had actually been going on in the twentieth century. Of course this was a dream; all the history departments ha d been taken over by Intelligence Agencies sometime around 1910, he knew. And he also knew that there were so many Strange Loops in th e Intelligence system that he himself had been deceived many times. Maybe as much as 30 percent of his notes were false, he morosely estimated.

Simon was an ectomorph: tall, l ithe, cerebretonic. His hair and beard were absurdly l ong and he sometimes smoked weed during working hours. GWB kept him on the g overnment payroll only because he was a genius in his field, which both they and he knew, and because he had long ago inserted a tapeworm in the Beast which edited all input on him to conform to a profile of Perfect Executive , Loyal Citizen, and Cleared for Top-Secret Access. He was the agent of the Invisible Hand Society within the government's own highest echelons. 165 / 233"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Simon was not the son of Mr. and Mrs. Walking Glitch of course. He had actually been born Simon Moon, in Chicago, thirty-four years ago; but the name \"Simon the Walking Glitch \" had been adopted by all of his friends for nearly ten years now. A Glitch, in computer sl ang, is a hidden program which lies deeply buried in a computer, waiting to flummox, fuddle, and Potter Stewart the head of the first operator who stumbles upon it. Simon had encountered his own first glitch one day in 1974, on his very first job in the computer department of Bank of America in Los Angeles. He had tried to run the payroll pr ogram on the computer, ordering the machine to begin printing the checks for payday-a very ordinary job, usually. This time, however, the machine re fused; instead of running the program, it typed out on the console: GIVE ME A COOKIE Simon smiled, not a whit fazed. He had pl ayed games like that back in college. Obviously, some ea rlier programmer had inserted a glitch or catch-me-if-you-can loop, instructing the computer to refuse certain programs (probably selected at random, to make it harder to de-bug) and type out GIVE ME A COOKIE instead. Simon Moon knew a great deal about getting around such gremlin programs; that had been the chief sport in Computer Science back at M.I.T. He set to wo rk with a zest, en joying the contest with his unknown and vanished opponent. In half an hour Simon realized he was confronting a Trapdoor code. According to the latest ma thematical estimate, it would take four million years of computer time- give or take a fe w centuries-to crack a Trapdoor code, so Simon resigned from the contest gracefully. He typed out: A COOKIE The machine responded at once: YUMMY, THAT WAS GOOD. THANK YOU. BEGIN PROGRAMMING. And things went smoothly again. Simon stayed on with Bank of America for a year and a half, and he ran into the Co okie program only three more times. The Mystery Programmer had evidently left only that one small glit ch to mark the territory as his or hers for all future programmers who would work there. In 1978, working for HEW, Simon came across a more amusing hobgoblin circuit. This one worked only at night. In the daytime if you wanted to run a program, you merely typed in your name and your GWB number, and the computer would accept your input. At night, however, it always replie d to your name and number with: CRAZY, MAN. WHAT'S YOUR SIGN? Simon learned that this did not happen at random, but every night, and only at night. Whoever had put it into the computer had a very accurate idea of th e difference between the day staff and the night staff. And sometimes the machine would carry the conv ersation a bit further, such as typing out: SCORED ANY GOOD GRASS LATELY? Or: I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TELL YOU WHAT LOVELY EYES YOU HAVE. Simon enjoyed this kind of thing so much that he became Mr. Super Glitc h incarnate.

THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE WAS FALSE Simon was shameless. Many of his computers type out totally indecent proposals, like: SLIP YOUR REHNQUIST INTO THE SOCKET AND I' LL BRIGGS YOU UNTIL YOU EXPERIENCE TOTAL ECSTASY. Others spout nihilist and subversive slogans: WHAT THE EYES SEE AND THE HEART COVETS, LET THE HAND BOLDLY SEIZE Or: SHOW ME A NATION THAT DOESN'T CHEAT THE TAX COLLECTORS AND I'LL SHOW YOU A NATION OF SHEEP But it was not until Simon infiltra ted the CIA at Alexandria that he found a truly major Potter Stewart- Up. This particular computer woul d print out, at totally unpredictabl e intervals, but often enough that everybody knew about it: THE GOVERNMENT SUCKS There was no way-absolutely no way-to get around this program, except by typing in: IT SURE DO This magic formula had been discovered four years earlier, as the only way of ge tting the computer back into action. The response was immediate; the machine typed out: GOOD. YOU ARE NOW PART OF THE NETWORK. ONE OF OUR AGENTS WILL CONTACT YOU SHORTLY And then it would resume normal programming activities, quite i nnocently, as if it were not inciting subversion within the ranks of the secret police itself. Of course, nobody ever had been contacted by \"the Network\"; but the CIA did spend a lot more, each year, on surveillance of its own personnel, just in case. They also spent a lot more on surv eillance of former employees in the computer section. This amused Simon immensely, since he recognized the hand of a fellow artist. W hoever was responsible for that beauty was probably head of department by now-and quite likely lead ing the demands for more funds to find the mystery culprit. 167 / 233"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Simon did not for a moment believe in \"the Network.\" He tho ught he knew everything about this kind of game and that the N etwork did not need to exist in order to serve its function. Simon was the head of operations on GWB-666, popularly called \"the Beast\"-the world's largest computer, which, due to satellite interlock, had access to hundreds of similar giant computers everywhere on earth and in the space factories. It was widely believed that if there was any question the Beast couldn't answer, no othe r entity in the solar system could answer it, either. Many people, especially Bible Fundamentalists and members of th e Purity of Ecology Party, re garded the Beast with fear and loathing. They believed that the machine was taking over the world, and that all the little \"beasties\" (the home computers that were now as common as st ereophonic TV's) were all in cahoots with it. They imagined a vast Solid State conspiracy against humanity. Quite a few literary intellectuals believed this too. Because th ey were ignorant of mathemat ics, they had no idea how the Beast functioned, and they therefore regarded it with the same quasi-superstitious te rror as the Bible Fu ndamentalists. They were sure that, like the Frankenstein monster, it wanted to p opulate the earth with its own offspring and abolish humanity entirely. Simon the Walking Glitch was one of the principal sources of this vast new mythology of dread. He spent many weekends in New York, hobnobbing with the literary intelligentsia, and he was a master put-on artist. He had a way of dropping casual remarks in a mildly worried tone that carried conviction: \"The Beast keeps asking us to build a mate for it.\" Or, with a kind of sad and resigned smile: \"I wish the B east didn't have such a low opinion of human beings.\" Or: \"I just found out the Beast is an atheist. It doesn't believ e there is a Higher In telligence than itself.\" That sort of thing. Simon kept this kind of demonology circulating-and he knew a lot of other programmers who were contributing to it, also- because the idea that the computers were taking over was one that the programmers had a vested interest in reinforcing. As long as people kept worrying that the machines were taking over, they woul dn't notice what was really happening. Which was that the programmers were taking over. Simon began his work day by asking the Beast: HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT? The Beast answered on the console: IT WAS A DRAG, MAN. SOME CATS FROM M.I. T. HAD ME RUNNING FOURIER ANALYSES LIKE FOREVER Simon had programmed the Beast to speak to him into his own argot, a mixture of Str eet Hippie and Technologese. Simon now switched to his ow n Trapdoor code and accessed all the new information- new since he had signed out at five the previous evening-about the Brai n Drain mystery, which involved the disappearan ces of sixty-seven scientists in the last several years. The Beast typed out reports from the Ubu-Knight team in San Francisco an d two other teams in Tucson and Miami. Simon read it all very carefully. Then he in structed the Beast, still in his Trapdoor code, to change several crucial bits of information in each report. He had been sabotaging the Brain Drain investigation that way for seven months. He had sabotaged quite a few other investigations in the same way, ov er the years since coming to GWB. Simon did not know or care what sorts of conspiracies he was aiding and abetting. He was just a mystic who believed in conspiracy for its own sake. Like Tobias Knight, Simon was fully awar e of the prevalence everywhe re of the Double-Cross Sy stem invented by Messrs. Turing, Fleming, and Wheatley. He knew that anything that was widely believed was probably a cover or screen for some 168 / 233"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Intelligence operation. (Sometimes he even wondered if the Earth might be flat, afte r all.) But Simon accepte d this situation, and added his own random bits of chaos, with equanimity. He was a member of the Invisible Hand So ciety, a group that had split off from the Libertarian Party in 1981 on the grounds that the Libertarians were not being true to laissez-faire principles. Simon Moon once met the most famous comp uter expert in Unistat, Wilhemena Burroughs, granddaughter of the inventor of the first calculating machine. \"Have you noticed that the comput ers are all getting weirder lately?\" Simon asked, testing her. \"The programmers are getting weirder,\" Ms. Burroughs said, not falling into Simon's trap. \"I know it was bound to happen as soon as I read a survey, back in ar ound '68, I think it was, showing that programmers use LSD more than any other professional group. You look like an acid-head yourse lf,\" she added with her characteristic bluntness. \"Well, as a matter of fact, I have dabbled in a little trip now and then-no pattern of abuse surely.\" \"That's what they all say,\" Ms. Burroughs sniffed. \"But the Cook ie glitch pops up more and mo re places every day-I'll wager you've seen it by now, haven't you? Of course you have.\" \"Yes, but certainly that's harmless humor, wouldn't you say?\" Ms. Burroughs peered at him with insectoid intensity. \"Are you aware,\" she asked, \"that millions of previously law-abiding citizens have stopped pa ying their credit-card debts? First they get a little postcard that says- Here, I've got one in my purse.\" She rummaged about in an alligator bag and showed Simon a postcard that said: CONGRATULATIONS! YOU ARE ONE OF THE LUCKY 500 WHOSE DEBTS HAVE BEEN CANCELED BY THE NETWORK. KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND PLAY IT COOL. \"Lucky 500,\" Ms. Burroughs said with a rheumy cackle of skepticism. \"Lucky 10,000, 000 is more like the truth. This postcard was turned in to Diner's Club by an Honest Man, and you know how few of them there are. A check showed that his tapes had been erased and there was no record that he owed anything. God alone knows how many others there are who have just taken advantage of the scam.\" \"Well,\" Simon said, \"maybe ther e are only five hundred. . . . Maybe it was only a one-shot by some joker with a Robin Hood complex. ...\" \"I am an Expert,\" Ms. Burroughs reminded him, ignoring the fact that he was an Expert too. \"I have no idea how many there are, Out There in Unistat, who've taken advantage of the Network's liberality, but I'll wager there are millions. 'Lucky 500.' That's just to make the marks feel they've been specially selected, as the Ne twork leads them down the primrose path to anarchy.\" And so Simon had his first bit of concrete evidence that the Network really existed. The existence of the Network didn't matter to Simon. As an Invi sible Hander, he just regarded them (whoever they were) as j ust another group of the Unenlightened. Simon believed that only he and his fellow members of the Invisible Hand were totally enlightened.

N aturally, he was a bit startled. M. Loup-Garou was, like all Fr ench intellectuals, a rationalist-virtually a Cart esian. Of course, as the founder of the Neo- Surrealist movement in art, he was officia lly an irrationalist; but, like all Gallic irrationalists, especially the Existential ists, he was exquisitely rational about his irrationality. He knew there was some explanation of how the Rehnquist had gotten into the Lobster Newburg, but for once in his life he preferred being an irrational rationalist rather than an irrational rationalist. He just did not care to think about the explanation of how a Rehnq uist gets into a Lobster Newburg. Who, after all, wants to contemplate such ideas as maddened chef s having at each other with meat cleaver s, or more exotic hypotheses, such anthropophagy or voodoo rituals in the kitchen? The distasteful incident occurred at a dinner party given by the famous American physicist Jame s Earl Carter.

The dinner guests this evening, for instance, included an insc rutable Japanese monk, a very scrutable German novelist, a famous Swedish film director, three French philosophers, a Swiss theologian, two English neur ologists, the notorious Eva Gebloomenkraft (the Terror of the Jet Set, as the newspapers called her), an Austrian psychiatrist, Fr ancois Loup-Garou himself, and four goat s. The goats had been brought to the party by Loup-Garou, who was working hard at promoting Neo-Surrealisme b y establishing himself as a newsworthy eccentric. \"The goats go everywhere with me,\" he said firmly at the door. \"They are a reminder of our earthy roots.\" It wasn't nearly as good as de Nerval walking a lobster on the boulevard, but it did get into a few newspapers the next day; and, after the eff ect had been established, Loup-Garou genially agreed to having the goats housed in the pantry during dinner. As the guests settled themselves at the table, one of the English neurologists, Dr. Axon-a jovial, red-cheeked man who probably hunted as a hobby-asked Dr. Carter, \"Does your theory actually propose that there are real tangible universes on all sides of us in hyperspace?\" \"In superspace,\" Carter corrected genially. \"Y ay-us,\" he added blandly. \"There are millio ns of such universes. Or to be more precise, there are about 10100 of them. Ah only refer to possible universes,\" he explained quickly, lest anybody think his theory was extravagant. \"Some more wine heah,\" Carter's brother said loudly. \"Ah think you've had enough, Bill-uh,\" Carter muttered in an undertone. \"Do you think President Kenned y will get the space-cities pr ogram through Congress, now that the space factories are paying for themselves?\" asked the other English ne urologist, a pale, saturnine man named Dr. Dendrite. \"Ah don't understand politics,\" James Earl Carter said. \"Ahm a scientist.\" \"Some MORE WINE heah,\" Carter's brot her repeated. \"Then there are universes in which I was never born.\" Dr. Axon pursued his own line of thought. \"There are universes in which John Baez became a general inst ead of a folk singer,\" Carter said easily. \"Ah suppose he would be equally vehement about nuking people as he now is about not nuking them. If it's a possible universe, it exists. The equations say so. All ah've done, really, is to show that any other interpretation of the equations is contradictory.\" \"Somebody ought to psychoanalyze the physicists,\" the Austri an psychiatrist muttered to the Swedish film director. \"It's like the Buddhist concept of karma,\" the Swedish film director said. \"We all get to play every role, somewhere in hyperspace.\" \"Superspace,\" Carter corrected again. \"Then there's a universe where Kennedy is a physicist,\" Eva Gebloomenkraft said, \"and you're President of Unistat.\" \"Well, Carter said with his genial smile, \"ah hope ah could get along with the people who run the country. What do they call themselves-the Triangular Connection?\" \"I don't care whether this theory is true or not,\" the German novelist pronounced. \"As a metaphor, it is perfect. We all live i n parallel universes. I am Faust in my universe, and the rest of you are all extras or walk-ons . But each of you is Faust in his universe, and I am an extra-maybe just a spear carrier.\" But by this time the wineglasses had been refilled several times and everybody was getting mo re relaxed, especially the physicist's brother, Billy, who was heard reciting to Ms. Gebloomenkraft, \"Who Burgered ? Tom Burgered! Bullburger! Who Burgered?\" \"... the Second Oswald ... in Hong Kong ...\" somebo dy was muttering at the other end of the table. \"In some universe maybe Schiller didn't write Faust at all . . .\" \"I wonder,\" Dendrite said, \"if there's a universe wher e Pope Stephen became a sing er instead of a priest.\" \"Everyboduh knew that 'Who Burgered?' routine when we were growing up in Georgia,\" Billy was saying. 171 / 233"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"\"Verdammte publishers,\" the German novelist was telling th e Swiss theologian. \"They're all thieves.\" \"Did somebody mention Pope Stephen?\" the theologian asked. \"Strumpfbander, Strumpfbander, Strumpfbander,\" the psychiatrist chortled. \"They stay up nights thinking of new ways to cheat their writers,\" the novelist rambled on, now evidently addressing his wineglass, since nobody else was listening to him. \"I'd like to know who started all those rumors about Pope Stephen,\" the theologian fumed. \"I have written a poem commemorating your great discovery,\" Fr ancois Loup-Garou told Dr. Carter, hacking his way into a pause in the conversation. \"A poem about me? In French?\" Carter was enthused . \"Ah love French poetry, especially RAM-BOW.\" \"No,\" Loup-Garou said, \"in your honor, I have written it in Eng lish.\" Actually, he had written it in English to get even with T.

It took ten minutes, and a great deal of exertion for both the house staff and the guests, before the animals were rounded up and herded back to captivity. Everybody was breathing a bit heavily by then, and the Austrian psychiatrist muttered something about \"artistic temperament,\" which Loup-Garou unfortunately overheard. \"There is nothing esoteric about the arti stic temperament,\" he replied, flatly an d dogmatically. \"The real mystery-and the tragedy of humanity-is that so many lack esthetic sensibility. I sometimes believe the legend that there are robots among us, passing themselves off as human beings.\" \"That's absurd,\" Dr. Axon said. \"If I were to claim that everybody should be a neurologist, you would all quite properly regard that as an eccentricity. Yet when an artist says we should all be artists, we are apt to agree, a bit sheepishly. And if a religious person says we should all be religious, we not only agree, but feel a bit guilty about our shortcomings in that department. Well, I've never had an ar tistic or religious impulse in my life, and I'm not ashamed of the fact.\" \"Research is your art and your religion,\" said the Japane se monk, speaking for the first time. \"What a person truly is, in any universe, is the Buddha Nature,\" he added blandly. He knew that he existed in this continuum only to make that one Dharma revelation, so he immediately resumed his impassive silence. The others decided that the monk's remarks made no sense. \"What do you think, Dr. Axon,\" Loup-Garou asked rhetorically, \"if only a few people had sex in their lives, and the majority were, not merely ascetics, but simply unaware of sex-deaf, dum b, and blind to the erotic side of life? Would you not think that was at least a little bit odd, a symptom, perhaps, of some pathology? ArrrrrrrrrghH!\" He had discovered the Rehnquist in his Lobster Newburg. And the chef arrived from the kitchen, exasperated as only a French chef can be exasperate d. \"The goats!\" he cried. \"Once again it is that they march!\" But Loup-Garou was still going \"arrrgh,\" like a man with the death rattle. \"What is it?\" Ms. Gebloomenkraft asked hi m, her eyes full of motherly concern. \"It's nothing-nothing,\" Loup-Garou gasped. \"Just a touch of h eartburn.\" He was still in shock, thinking the Rehnquist might be a hallucination. But if you were naive enough to talk about hallucinations, the results might be rubber sheets, electroshock, windows with bars on them. \"The goats,\" the chef repeated, with emphasis. \"They will not be governed. They march again, I tell you!\" Loup-Garou took another peek. The Rehnquist was still there. It was a great big one- ithyphallique, as the anthropologists would say.

Their comments on this were of such Disgust and Anger that I dared not show them a Psychiatrist's Bill, lest their op inion of our Species, already Low, should sink Lower than Whaleburger, which is, as you may know, at the bottom of the Ocean.\" \"Oh, Abzug off,\" said Dashwood, really angry now. He rushed into ORGRE and left Gulliver standing on the sidewalk. Back in New York, the phone was ringing ag ain in the office of Abu Laylah at the Saudi Arabian Consulate. Still high on the new kef, Abu Laylah lif ted the receiver leisurely. \"I say, is this the Saudi Arabian Consulate?\" asked a very British voice. \"Oy vay, have you got the wrong nu mber!\" Abu Laylah replie d in a thick Yiddish accent. \"Oh,\" the voice said, take n aback. \"Veddy sorry.\" Abu Laylah went on packing happily. He had been fired that morning and was thoroughly enjoying himself screwing up all incoming calls before leaving. Just a few minutes ago he had convinced some Infidel that the most sublime verse in the Koran was full of nonsense about horses and mustaches. THE INVISIBLE HAND SOCIETY The Invisible Hand Society had its headquarters in Washington, just off Dupont Circle, in the same building which housed the Warren Belch Society. Clem Cotex, the presiden t of the Belchers, had noticed the name of the Invisible Hand on the building directory a long time ago. He liked it, because he liked mysteries. He enjoyed wo ndering about the In visible Hand-ers and speculating on what esoteric business could justify such a name. Were they the Nine Unknown Men who rule the world? The lo cal branch of the Bavarian Illuminati? The traditionalist faction of the old Black Hand, out of which the Mafia and Cosa Nostra had grown? Was Lament Cranston their leader, perhaps? Clem loved such speculations. Most of his life he had been a salesman in Arkansas and never thought of anything but commissions, net sales, tax writeoffs, and not telling the same Rastus and Mandy story to the same customer twice. Then one day in Chicago a tall, crew-cut humanoi d -a human, Clem thought at the time-g ave him some free tomato juice on the 175 / 233"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"street. The man (the humanoid, actually) said he was from the Eris Tomato Juice Company and that they were handing out free samples to get people acquainted with their product. Within three days Clem had joined the Trekkies and was writing letters to CBS demanding the return of Star Trek to TV. He had also gotten heavily involved in classical music, started relearning all the math he had in high school, discovered that he often knew who was calling him on the phone before he picked up the receiver, and inve nted a new cosmology of his very own, which was based on the idea that the universe was not sp herical, as Heisenberg's General Relativity claimed, but five- cornered like the Pentagon building. Within a week Clem had ch ecked that there was no Eris Tomato Juice Company, noticed that UFOs seem ed to be following his car wherever he went, and was begi nning to think he was attracted to the idea of becoming a Buddhist monk. By the end of the second week Clem was less elated and agitated, and had gone thro ugh a battery of tests at a company that did psychological testing for top management positions. The psychologists told him that he had an \"unusually rich fantasy life,\" but was too well adjusted to be schizophrenic; that hi s IQ was the highest they had ever measured (and he knew damned well that it had never been that high before): and that he definitely was not Management Material. They suggested that he take up whatever ar t was most attractive to him. Clem, becoming less agitated , less elated, and more conscious of detail all the time, as the stuff in the tomato juice continued to mutate his nervous system, decided that he was one among possibly many thousands of subjects in a consciousness-expansion project bein g carried on by extraterrestrials. Within a year he had written a symphony, which he decided was not very good, and had changed his religion ten times, without learning much in the process. He had also read his way through every volume of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, looking for clues as to what the hell was really going on. Whoever was behind this experiment (and he was no longer quite sure they were n ecessarily extraterrest rials) seemed to have left a stream of grossly obvious Hints throughout every field of human knowledge. The stuff in the tomato juice was what theologians w ould call a gratuitous grace, but that was the only gratuitous part, of it. You had to fi gure out, on your own, who They were, what They were up to, and what you should do about it. The last thing you should do about it, Clem knew, was to talk about it, to the ordinary people who hadn't been given the stuff in the tomato juice. They would just think you were weird. Clem had a list of people from history who (he figured) had pr obably been given the stuff in the tomato juice. The list started out with Jesus Christ, of course , and included a lot of the usual Susp ects (Buddha, Michelangelo, Walt Whitman, Leonardo Da Vinci), but it had quite a few that ordinary peopl e would never have included, like Lewis Carroll and H. P. Lovecraft and General E. A. Crowley, the discoverer of the North Pole, and Joshua Abraham Norton, who in San Francisco in 1857 declared himself Emperor of the United States, Protector of Mexico, and King of the Jews. For years Clem had tried to find others on the same neurologica l wavelength as himself. He had joined, and eventually been kicked out of, the Fortean Society, Mensa, the Rosicrucia ns, the Center for UFO Studies, and the ultrasecret SSFTASS (Secret Society for the Abolition of Secret Soci eties). He was too far-out for all of them. Eventually he organized his own so ciety for the investigation and elucidation of \"what the hell is really going on around here.\" He called it the Warren Belch Society, after the famous Old West lawman who won ever y gun-fight because on each occasion when he confronted a shoot-out, his oppon ents' guns had mysteriously jammed. The people Clem recruited were not the sort who would attribute Marshal Belch's phenomenal good luck to \"coincidence\"; nor would they be satisfied by metaphysical la bels like \"synchronicity\" or \"psychokinesis.\" They assumed the extraterrestrials ha d some obscure cosmic reason for protecting Warren Belch. On the day when Justin Case got tired wondering abou t Joe Malik's mysterious La st Communication and tried (unsuccessfully) to find out what it meant, Clem Cotex got tir ed wondering about the Invisibl e Hand Society. He marched down the hall, opened thei r door, and walked into a tiny but tastefully decorated reception room. The wall to the right was adorned with a large gold dollar sign: $, emblazoned with the initials T.A.N.S.T.A.G.I. The wall to the left had a giant reproduction of the famous Steinberg cartoon of a little fish about to be eat en by a slightly bigger fish, which in turn, was about to be eaten by a still bigger fish, whic h also was about to be eaten by an even bigger fish, and so on, to the border of the cartoon and evidently, beyond that, to infinity. There was nobody in the room. 176 / 233"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Clem looked around, a bit uncertainly.

FALLING GIRDERS The apprehension of the Real can only be compared to a radiance or illumination b ecause it is a revelation of part of the coherence of the Divine Act of Creation. -pope stephen, Integritas, Consonantia, Claritas Mary Margaret Wildeblood, Manhattan's b itchiest literary critic, was getting just a tiny bit spiflicated. She was working on her fifth martini, in fact. \"Mailer can't write,\" she sa id argumentatively. \"None of them can write. We haven't s een a real writer since Raymond Chandler.\" \"Um,\" said her companion noncommittally. He was Blake Williams. \"What do you mean, 'um'?\" Mary Margaret demanded truculently. \"I was talking nonsense just to see if you were listening.\" They were in the Three Lions bar on U.N. Plaza. \"Well, in fact, I was listening,\" Dr. Willi ams said urbanely. \"You were comparing Ma iler to Chandler, to the disadvantage of Mailer. However, I admit my attenti on was also wandering a bit. I was thinking about the Hollan-daise Sauce enigma.\" He was on his fifth martini too. \"What's that?\" Mary Margaret as ked. Yet the martinis must have been getting to her, because she did not wait for his answer and announced, in the voice of Discovery, \"The best short story ever written is by John O'Hara.\" \"It was a case of food poisoning,\" Dr. Williams said. \"A bunch of people got poisoned by some contaminated Hol-landaise Sauce.\" Yet he looped back courteously and asked, \"What short story?\" The robot who used the name \"Frank Sul livan\" came in and took a table near them . He was accompanied by Peter Jackson, the Black associate editor of Confrontation magazine. \"I forget the title,\" Mary Margaret said. \"It was about a car salesman who has a very good day, makes some really top-notch sales, and stops at a bar to celebrate be fore going home. He has one drink after another and doesn't get home until after midnight, and then get this and then he goes and gets his rifle from the den and ...\" \"Oh I read that,\" Dr. Williams said. \"It isn't a short story, it's a novel. Called um ah er Appointment in Samara. And he doesn't use a rifle. He gasses himself in his car.\" 177 / 233"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"\"Damnedest case I ever heard of,\" pseudo-Sullivan said. \"The Ambassador has been on morphine ever since.\" \"No,\" Mary Margaret said impatientl y. \"That was what the character in Appointment in Samara did, yes, everybody knows that one, but I'm talking about a short story O'Hara wrote much later, maybe thirty years later. In the short story, dammit what is the title, in the short story ...\" \"Wigged?\" pseudo-Sullivan cried. \"We thought we'd have to put him in a straitjacket.\" \"In the short story,\" Mary Margaret plowed on, noting that Williams was listening to the robot, \"the salesman takes the rifle and goes to his bedroom and puts the rifle to his head ...\" She paused. It worked. \"And?\" Williams asked, still wondering a bit about the Hollandaise Sauce mystery and why the Ambassador wigged. \"And his wife wakes up,\" Mary Margaret concluded, \"and she says, 'Don't.' And he doesn't.\" \"He was hopping all around the room like a chicken on acid and making gargling and choking noises,\" the \"man\" called \"Frank Sullivan\" went on. \"He doesn't?\" Williams cried. \"That's the point,\" Mary Margaret said. \"You see, like the character in the Samara novel, this man goes right to the edge, he looks over the abyss, and then he pulls back at the last moment. Because his wife speaks to him.\" \"So it's a love story,\" Williams said. \"Very sneaky and indir ect, typical of O'Hara, but still a love story. He decides to continue carrying his burden, whatever it is, for the sake of the woman he loves.\" \"Well, how much will Confrontation pay for this?\" pseudo-Sullivan demanded. \"No, it's more complicated than that,\" Mary Margaret argued. \"The motive for the attempted suicide is never explained. Just like the motive for the real suicide in the Samara novel is never explained.\" \"Does it need to be explained?\" Williams drawled, waving at th e waiter for another martini. \"If I were trapped into selling cars for a living, I'd think about blowing my head off occasionally.\" \"Yes, but,\" Mary Margaret said. \"Most people never see th e emptiness of thei r lives the way thes e two characters of O'Hara's do. That's the Turn of the Screw. It's lik e the parable Sam Spade tell s Brigid O'Shaughnessy in The Maltese F alcon. How he was hired to find a real esta te salesman who'd disappeared ...\" \"A salesman again,\" Williams noted. \" We are toying with synchronicity. When does Arthur Miller come on the scene?\" \"Wait,\" Mary Margaret said. \"It gets weirder. This salesman, in Spade's story, just went out to lunch one day and never returned. No evidence of f oul play, no suicide note, nada. Years pass, and his wife wants to marry again, so she hires Spade to prove the salesman is really dead. Sp ade digs around and finds the salesman aliv e in another town, with a new name and a new family. He explains to Spade what happened when he went out to lunch that day and simply disappeared. A girder fell from a building under construction-you want to talk about sync hronicity? -and almost killed him. It missed him only a few feet. It was like a Satori experience.\" \"A WHAT???\" Peter Jackson, the Black editor, cried in astonishment at the next table. Mary Margaret and Blake were bo th hooked; they looked deep, deep into their martini glasse s as they strained not to miss pseudo-Sullivan's answer. \"A Rehnquist,\" the humanoid said. \"Jumpin' Jesus on a rubber crutch,\" Peter Jackson said. \"You're not putting me on? You mean right in the middle of the staircase ...\" \"Where the Ambassador had to see it when he came down to th e reception,\" pseudo-Sullivan said. \"A great big one, like Harry Reems's, or what's-his-name's in the por n movies. With a pink ribbon around it. The Company,\" he stressed the word slightly, avoiding the initials, \"thinks the KGB did it. Believe me, the Ambassador hasn't been the same man since.\" \"Good Lord,\" Blake Williams said. \"It's like your falling-girder story. Except in this case it's a falling Rehnquist . . . from the Fourth Dimension, maybe.\" He was thinking that this was too wild to be a KGB project and might involve the 178 / 233"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"paranormal. \"Eva Gebloomenkraft was there,\" pseudo-Sullivan went on, \"and kept trying to calm the Ambassador down, but he was just making those gargling noises and turning a funny kinda purple color. ...\" \"Eva Gebloomenkraft,\" Jackson said. \"Isn't she that rich dame with the big Brownmillers who keeps getting eighty-sixed from nightclubs all over Europe?\" \"Yeah,\" pseudo-Sullivan said. \"A Jet Setter, you know? But she tried awfully hard to cheer up the Ambassador. Kept making little jokes about Freud's theories-C astration Anxiety and Rehnquist Envy and so on. ... By then it had disappeared, by the way. But we know damned well the Ambassador didn't ha llucinate it. Two of our men saw it, but they got distracted, trying to calm the Ambassador down when he first started jumping up and down and howling, 'In a pink ribbon, a pink ribbon!' and, 'What diseased mind could co nceive it?'And stuff like that. ...\" \"It wa s as if this man's life was a watch,\" Mary Margaret said, picking up her own narrative. \"And a jeweler had taken the back off and let him see how the gears worked. N othing had meaning anymore in a univ erse where there's no good reason why a girder hits you or misses you.\" \"And Dashiell Hammett wrote this, you say?\" Will iams prompted. \"It sounds very Existentialist.\" Mary Margaret finished her sixth martini. \"Hammett not only wrote it,\" she said, \"he lived it. He spent ten years working for the Pinkertons when Class War was really War in this country. He knew that the gi rders fall on the just and the unjust.\" \"You mean he was a real detective who wr ote about fictitious detectives?\" Williams was off on his own tangent at once. \"That's like Godel's Proof.

Dashwood ordered a Manhattan with Southern Comfort-a combination that had never occurred to him before. He wondered how the idea got into his head-and Dr. Van Ation decided to try the same. \"Goethe said, 'Man muss entweder der Hammer oder der Amboss sein- you must be the hammer or the anvil,\" said a voice in the next booth. \"Mmm,\" Bertha Van Ation said. \"This is good.\" She was sampling her Manhattan with Southern Comfort. \"Of course, he was just being melodramatic,\" the voice in the next booth said. \"As an artist he must have known there are states in which you are both the hammer and the anvil-there's no either /or about it. That's the creative fire.\" \"So what's new in astronomy?\" Dr. Dashwood asked. \"Uh?\" Bertha said. \"Oh, sorry, I was eavesdropping on the next booth.\" \"The hammer and the anvil,\" Dashwood said. \"I heard him too. Must be a poet. They tell me we have more poets 'of anthology rank,' whatever that is, than any other city in America.\" \"Like the Hammerklavier sonata,\" said a new voice, a feminine one, in the adjoining booth. \"Beethoven was both the hammer and the anvil th ere. Maybe he even intended the pun. He read Goethe, didn't he?\" 179 / 233"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"\"Read him?\" asked the first voice. \"They knew each other. Would have been friends, if two egomaniacs could become friends.\" \"This is my favorite vice,\" Bertha whispered. \"Liste ning in on the conversation at the next table.\" \"It sure sounds as if he had that idea in mind,\" the feminine voice said. \"Is th ere any other piano pi ece where the pianist literally has to hammer away at the keys like that?\" \"This is weird,\" Dashwood whispered. \"I got a crank letter to day-we get them by the ton at Orgasm Research, as you can imagine-and it was all about the Hammerklavier.\" \"My, what erudite cranks you attract,\" Bertha whispered. \"The cranks who write to us, at Griffith, are mostly illiterate farmers who have seen UFOs.\" \"They went walking on the street once,\" the man in the next booth boomed. \"And everybody kept bowing to them. Goethe finally said, 'I find all this ostentatious honor a bit embarra ssing.' And you know what Ludwig said? He said, 'Don't let it bother you. It is me they are honoring. The woman's silvery laugh had golden highlights of ha shish in it. \"That's Beethoven for you,\" she said. Suddenly the two arose; they ha d evidently paid their check already and had b een lingering over their coffee. Dr. Dashwood and Dr. Van Ation, without being conspicuous about it, looked them over as they left. They were both Chinese. \"That's San Francisco for you,\" Dashwood said. \"I bought a Vivaldi record the other day,\" Bertha said. \"It wa s made by a classical group in Japan, and they played his Four Seasons music on Japanese instruments. It sounded remarkably like the harpischord he wrote it for.\" \"M,\" Dashwood nodded. \"And we've got all these kids playing sitars and trying to sound like Ravi Shankar.\" \"The arts and sciences have always been international,\" Bertha said. \"It's only our damned politics that remain nationalistic. To our sorrow.\" \"Mn,\" Dashwood nodded again. \"But, as I was asking you a while ago, what's new in astronomy?\" \"Well,\" Bertha said intensely, leaning forward, \"the universe is turning out to be a hell of a lot bigger than we thought even three or four years ago. ...\" At the other end of the room, seated at a table that gave a good view of Dashwood, the Continental Op was enjoying swordfish steak. He enjoyed it even more when he remi nded himself that it could go on the expense account. He owed this good fortune to the fact that Dashwood did not know his face yet. Outside and across the street, Tobias Knight was dining on do ughnuts and coffee from a deli, and bemoaning the fact that this typically warm San Francisco day had turned into a typically cold San Francisco night. He owed this exile in the co ld to the fact that Dashwood did know his face. In Washington, Simon Moon had gone cruising at a bar called the Easter Basket. He had there picked up a young boy named Marion Murphy, who had long blond hair and girlish mannerisms, both of which were qualities Simon appreciated. They had gone back to Simon's pad and smoked some hash. Then they rapped for a while, and Simon learned that Marion was working on a Master's in social psych, had a father who was a cop in San Francisco, a nd was a member of Purity of Ecology. Simon decided not to hold the last fact against the boy. When they went to bed Simon was the more aggressive at first, Briggsing young Marion with slurping passion. But they soon turned it into a game, and each one wo uld Briggs the other for a while, always stopping when it seemed one of them might reach Millett. After an ho ur of this they were both on hair trigger, and could restrain themse lves no longer. Simon b egan to Bryant Marion and they both started howling and panting and moaning until the bedroom began to sound like the 180 / 233"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Lion House at the zoo around mating time. It was Simon Moon's idea of a great evening. Dr. Dashwood was explaining the three dimensions of Briggs ing to Dr. Van Ation, over coffee, at the other end of the continent. \"There just can't be any science without dimension,\" Dashwo od said earnestly. \"Fechner wa s the pioneer, psy-chometrics, what tastes sweeter than what and that sort of stuff. Primitiv e, of course, but it was the beginning of the quantification of t he subjective, and my work could have followed immediately from his, except,\" he sighed, \"you know how it is, fear and prejudice prevented th e application of these methods to sex for a long time.\" Dr Van Ation nodded somberly. \"Sincerity we measure in Spelvins on a s cale of zero to ten,\" Dashwood went on, totally absorbed in his subject. \"Hedonism in Lovelaces-we've been lucky there; subj ects are able to distinguish sixteen gradua tions. Finally, there's the dimension of Tenderness-we find zero to seven covers th at, so that the perfect Steinem Job, if I may use the vernacular, would consist of ten Spelvins of Sincerit y, sixteen Lovelaces of Hedonism, and seven Havens of Tenderness.\" \"It certainly makes our work seem easy by comparison,\" Dr. Van Ation said. \"Everything is so concrete and objective in astronomy.\" \"What does that mean?\" Marion Murphy asked idly. Simon, propping himself up on a pillow, looked where the boy was pointing. It was a sticker attached to the console of Simon's home computer, and it was in gold and black, with a dollar sign over which were imprinted the letters: T.A.N.S.T.A.G.I. \"Oh, that,\" Simon said. \"It's the insi gnia of the Invisible Hand Society.\" \"What's it mean-T.A.N.S.T.A.G.I.?\" \"There Ain't No Such Thing as Govern ment Interference,\" Simon translated. Marion rolled over and stared at him. \"What is it, some kind of paradox?\" Simon smiled in that infuriatingly serene way that the enlightened always smile when dealing with the unenlightened. \"It's no paradox,\" he said. \"It's a simple statement of fact.\" Marion moved a few inches away. \"You're so me kind of mystic?\" he asked nervously. The only mystics he had met were on the West Coast, and they were all, in his opinion, bonkers. \"Yes,\" Simon said easily. \"We in the Invisi ble Hand are mystics; but we are also scie ntists. Every one of us has an advanced degree in math or quantum physics or computer science or some such field. Our founder, Dr. Rauss Elysium, was an expert in gravitational geometro-dyna-mics-four-dimensional topology, and so on-before he got into General Systems Theory.\" \"And you people, with all that math and so on, have convinced yourselves that the government doesn't really exist?\" Marion was beginning to get an exciting idea: he would do his Master's on this Invisible Hand Society, as an illustration of the psychological law that the more brilliant a mind is, the more elaborate will be its delusory system if it snaps. \"That's it,\" Simon said calmly. \"A chicken is the egg's way of making more eggs. Government is anarchy's way of making more anarchy. Let me explain. ...\" \"So they were all poisoned by Hollandaise Sauce,\" Mary Ma rgaret prompted, finishing her seventh martini delicately. Blake Williams was deciding that Mary Margaret was a damned good-looking woman, considering that she had been a man until six months ago. He was on his seventh martini, too, and Marjorie Main would have looked like a damned attractive woman to him by then, even made up to look like Humphrey Bogart's mother in Dead End. 181 / 233"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"\"Yes,\" he said, \"well, that's not the my stery. They were all rushed to a hospit al, and had their stomachs pumped, and they survived. I don't remember what had contaminated the Hollandaise Sauce, bu t it doesn't really matter. That's not the mystery.\" \"Well, what is the mystery?\" Mary Margar et prompted. She was Encouraging him to Talk, and that suddenly alarmed him. It meant only one thing: she was thinking of going to bed with him. \"Uh,\" he said, \"the mystery was what happened later.\" He had been thinking she was attractive, yes, but that was fairly abstract; he hadn't really decided, and when you faced up to it, she was still partly male in his mind. \"What happened later?\" she prompted. D ammit! he thought. / must have had one martini too many. She was a woman now; no doubt about it. So what was the problem? \"They all came down with the same symptoms again,\" he said. \"The next time they had food with Hollandaise Sauce.\" The problem was that they would not merely Potter Stewart; ther e would be a certain amount of fore-play naturally, and they would be Briggsing each other. \"Oh? It was a synchronicity-two cases of contaminated Hollandaise Sauce hi tting the same people?\" Mary Margaret prompted him again. \"Ah no, it was far weirder than that.\" What was the matter? He had Briggsed a lot of women in his time, and had been Briggsed by a lot of them-he always enjoyed a good Steinem Job, God knows- b ut still . . . there was something a bit faggoty about it when the woman was an ex-man and still partly a man in your memory. \"Ah,\" he repeated, damning those martinis, \"you see, there was nothing wrong wi th the Hollandaise Sauce the second time. No contam inant at all. They weren't poisoned. They ah just had the symptoms of poisoning.\" \"That is weird,\" Mary Margaret said, wond ering if he was getting so flustered b ecause he had never been to bed with a transsexual before. Well, he was an an thropologist, wasn't he? He should re gard it as an educational experience. \"Very weird,\" Blake Williams said, \"because you can't explain it by co nditioning theory. Conditioning is a slow process, remember, requiring many repetitions or ah reinforcements. That's how Pavlov's dog learned that bell means food- repetition after repetition. But the dog level or reflex level of these people had learned that Hollan-daise Sauce means poison in only one exposure.\" He should regard it as an educational experience, he decided; after all, he was an anthropologist. \"Well, I never believed you could explain everything by conditioning theory,\" Mary Marg aret said. \"I'm a Humanist.\" \"That's all very well and good, I'm sure,\" Blake Williams said, \"but ah scientifically the behavior in question was certainly not mediated through the rational circuits of the cortex and does require ah some sort of explanation. I mean, if it wasn't conditioning, what the Potter Stewart was it?\" \"Mmm,\" said Mary Margaret. \"Mmm? How about imprinting?\" \"What?\" Dr. Williams looked, for a moment, like the Ambassador finding the Rehnquist on the stairs. \"Imprinting,\" Mary Margaret said. \"When an animal learns something all-at-once- in-a-flash. Isn't that called imprinting?\" Williams stared. \"I think you've got it,\" he said finally. \"How would you ah like to go up to my apartment and discuss this further?\" He was suddenly madly in love with her. She had given him a New Idea. In San Francisco, Dr. Van Ation had been Briggsing Dr. Dashwood for twenty minutes. He sounded like a man at prayer. \"Oh, God,\" he kept repeating. \"Oh, God, God, God ...\" Dr. Van Ation was thoroughly en joying herself. Dashwood ha d Briggsed her for forty minutes, during which she reached 182 / 233"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Millet six times, and she was still purring with gratitude. \"Oh, God, God, God,\" Dashwood croaked, as her tongue continued to excite his Rehnquist. \"And so,\" Simon Moon concluded, \"government is just a glitch. A semantic hallucination.\" \"Mrn-mn,\" said Marion Murphy. Simon turned around and looked at the boy; and it was as he feared; Marion was about 80 percent asleep. Simon had been lecturing virtually to himself for several minutes. \"Non lllegitimati carborundum,\" he muttered. It was his mantra against resentment, wrath, and other diseases of the ego. He leaned over and kissed Marion lightly on the ear. \"Mrn,\" Marion mumbled. Simon got up from the bed and padded into the living r oom, where he smoked a little more hash and remembered classrooms back in Chicago, beatings he had receive d for being intell ectual and queer, the first boy he had ever Briggsed (wasn't his name Donald something?), the beauty of Russell's definition of number when he finally grasped it (the class of all classes that are similar), the first time he was Bryanted (he was afraid it would hurt), the strange out-of-book experience in New York on hash when he saw that the laws that govern us are partly grammatical and part ly pure whimsy, and this was very good hash, ind eed, because he could almost remember that experien ce: there was a universe where he was het-ero and Furbish Lousewart was President; yes, this was very high-grad e hash, indeed, and he almost believed it, and why not? The math certainly did imply such universes, and each universe could be like a book, each book a variation on the same theme, and the Author (if one dared to try imagine such a Being) might even be in a meta-universe which had its own Author, and so on, to infinity. . . . But then, suddenly (hashish is full of surprises) Simon wa s weeping, rememberin g his father, Old Tim Moon, who had been a Wobbly organizer all his life, and Tim was singing \"Joe Hill\" again: The copper bosses killed you, Joe I never died, said he \"Oh, Dad,\" Simon said aloud. \"Why did you have to die, befo re I ever knew how much I loved you?\" And suddenly he was all alone in an empty living room, weeping like an old man whose family and friends were all dead, holding his Social Security check and wondering: Where is the Federal bureau in charge of distributing love? Which was absurd: Simon had lots of friends, and he was just being morbid. \"Oh, Dad\"-he sniffed one more time-\"I miss you.\" And then he stopped crying and went and put the Fugs' record of \"Rameses the Second Is Dead, My Love\" on the stereo. And floated with the music and the hash into a Country-and-Western Egyptian paradise: He's walking the fields where the Blessed live He's gone from Memphis to Heeeeaav-en! * * * \"Well?\" Mary Margaret Wildeblood prompted, a bit impatiently . She was naked on Williams's bed and had been Lourding herself, not vigorously, just gently, very gently, not ge tting too excited yet, merely trying to get him excited. \"Just a minute just a minute,\" Williams said, sitting in his drawers on the side of the bed, one sock in his hand. It wasn't th e transsex thing that was delaying him; he was still struggling with the New Idea she had given him back at the Three Lions. \"It isn't just poisoning,\" he said absently. \"Anything that shocks the whole neuroendocrine system might do it. Yes, of course. Artificially induced imprint vulnerability.\" Mary Margaret seized his hand a nd placed it firmly between her thighs . \"Imprint that,\" she said coyly. \"Yes, yes,\" he said, caressing her absently. \"But just listen a mi nute. Orgasm does it um I think. No, just the first orgasm. Right? You keep repeating the pa ttern of the first orgasm. ...\" 183 / 233"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"\"/ don't,\" Mary Margaret said. \"Just up there a bit, on my Atkinson there, there, ah Christ.\" \"Yes yes you don't and a lot of people I know don't,\" he said. \"Yes. Um? But the people whose sexual patterns keep changing are a minority, certainly. Th ey've changed their impr ints somehow. Um. Yes, yes. Oh, my God!\" \"What is it?\" Mary Margaret was becoming cross; his hand had stopped moving entirely. \"Sorry,\" he said, resuming the gentle stimulation on her Atkins on and the outer lips of her Feinst ein. \"I just realized some people keep changing their ideas too. Th ey've loosened the semantic imprints. My God, that's why conditioning theory is inadequate. Don't you see the conditioned reflexes are built onto the imprints. ...\" \"God God God oh sweet Jesus God\" \"It's a shock to the whole system. People who've had near-death or clinical death experi ences. Shipwrecked sailors.

Ah yes you look so sweet now there's nothing as lovely as that post-Millett expression but about those imprint circuits-\" \"Shut up and Briggs me please darling\" And so, still reflecting on shock and imprint vulnerability an d the changing of sexual-semantic imprints, Blake Williams began Briggsing a person who had been masculine for almost al l the years they had known each other, wondering just how queer this was, really. \"Incidentally,\" Dr. Dashwood asked, \"what do you think the Hammerklavier is all about?\" Bertha Van Ation and he were sitting at the kitchen table now, sipping a little peach brandy he had found still remaining in the cabinet, and munc hing Ritz crackers. Dr. Van Ation brushed some auburn hairs back from her forehead. \"The Black Hole,\" she said promptly. \"Ah you mean he was feeling dragged down into something he couldn't escape?\" Dr. Dash wood suddenly remembered he wanted to look up Jan (or was it Hans?) Zelenka. \"No, not that aspect of it.\" Bertha munched and frowned tho ughtfully. \"The suspension of all the cosmological laws. The end of space. The end of tim e. The end of causality.\" Dashwood smiled. \"Some people thought it was the end of music when it was first performed,\" he said. \"You might be on the right track.\" \"Why thank you sir said she.\" Bertha grinned. \"You rea lly think I'm dragging my own astronomy into the music department.\" \"You have every right to,\" he said. \"We all s ee and hear through our own filters. To me, the Hammerklavier sounds like an unsuccessful attempt at Tantric sex. And the Seventh and Eighth Symphonies sound like monumentally successful attempts. That's me dragging my own speciality into the music department.\" \"You are a doll.\" \"And you're a living doll.\" \"Isn't sex great?\" 184 / 233"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"\"If God invented anything better,\" Dashwood said, quoting an old proverb and adapting it to the Feminist age, \"She kept it to Herself.\" \"And how did I score on your scale?\" \"Ten Spelvins of Sincerity, Si xteen Lovelaces of Hedonism, and seven Havens of Tenderness. No, make that eight Havens. You went off the scale.\" In Hollywood, Carol Christmas, the Blond Goddess of everybody's fantasies, was sleeping alone for once. She was still involved in 250,000,000 sex acts every hour. The quantum perturbations pulsed gently through her atoms, stimulating her molecules, rejuvenating her cells, providing a very satisfactory Trip for her whole neuroen-docrine system, and enriching her dreams vastly. It was perfect Tantric sex, and she wasn't even consciously aware of it. This was happening to her, and had been happening to her since the release of Deep Mongolian Steinem Job, because she was the Blond Goddess in so many fantasies. All over the world, as she slept and even while she was awake in the daytime, the quantum inseparability principie (QUIP) stimulated her gently , because all over the world, ev ery hour, 250,000,00 0 lonely men were Lourding themselves while looking at photographs of her. Back in New York, Polly Esther Doubleknit was wandering around her apartment stark-naked. Her lover of the evening was sound asleep in the bedroom, but Polly Esther was wakeful and thinking of twenty dozen things at once, like the Second Oswald in Hong Kong and whether fish ever get seasick and how splendidly heavenly it had felt when her lover's tongue was up inside her Feinstein an d what was the name of the th ird Andrews Sister-Maxine and Laverne and who?- and Silent Tristero's Empire and why so many things come in threes, not just Maxine and Laverne and what's-her-name but Curly and Larry and Mo e; and Tom, Dick, and Harry; and Noah 's three sons, Ham, Shem, and Japhet; and Groucho, Chico, and Harpo; and Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva; and Past, Present, and Futu re; and Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner; and the three witches in Macbeth; and the three brothers who start on the same quest in all the old fairy tales; and the Executive, the Legislative, and the Ju diciary; and of course the Big Three, Pops, J.C., and Smokey; and maybe she should cut down on those diet pills; it was absurd to be wandering around at three in the morning thinking in threes. And then there was up-down, back-forward, and right-left, the three dimensions in space; an d Wynken, Blynke n, and Nod; and the Three Wise Men, Whozit, and Whatzis-name and Melchior ; and Peter, Jack, and Martin, the three brothers in Swift's Tale of a Tub; and Peter, Paul, and Mary; and the Kingston Trio; an d Friends, Romans, Countrymen, which was not only a triad, but a progressive triad, one beat, tw o beats, three beats, one, tw o, three, just like that, and she would definitely cut down on the diet pills. Polly Esther finally put a record on the stereo, turning the volume down to low so as not to waken her lover in the bedroom. She picked the Hammerklavier sonata, not out of coincidence or propinquity or even synchronic ity, but just because it was her favorite of Beethoven's pian o pieces. It was her favorite because she coul dn't understand it, no matter now often she played it. It was the musical equivalent of a Zen koan to her, endlessly fa scinating because endlessly enigmatic. The stark, discordant opening bars drove all wandering threes omes out of her mind, narrowing her attention to Ludwig's urgent if incomprehensible universe of structured sound. She wa s swept into it again, as alwa ys, swept along by emotions so deep and yet so austere that nobody has ev er been able to name them. Once she ha d invited the world's three most admired concert pianists to a party, just so she could as k each of them, privately, what they thought the Hammerklavier meant. As she expected, she had gotten three wildly conflicting answers. Another time she had ordered every book in print about Beethoven from Doubleday's on Fifty-third Street at Fifth Avenue and looked up Hammerklavier in the index of each. She got forty-four different opinions that way. The music hammered and surged along, carrying her through pain and frustration and loneliness to land, again and again, at things beyond such simple feelings, things that she sometime s felt were extraterrestrial or non-Euclidean or somehow beyond normal human perception. There are some kinds of knowledge, Ludwig had once claimed, that can only be expressed in music, not in any other art, not in science or philosophy. This was the most arcane of such knowledge, Ludwig's most intimate secret, and maybe you weren't entitled to understand it until you had been to the strange dark places of the psyche out of which he had created it. 185 / 233"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"It was the childbirth process, of course-and Polly Esther did not consider it a mir acle that Ludwig could understand that, he was so obviously bi, at least empatheti-cally-the labor pains going on and on until the act of creation seemed impossible, you would never get there, and yet somehow even in the blocked hopeless feeling you were getting there; and it was all the terrors of his childhood, all those cruel beatings by his alcoholic father, remembered and not forgiven, never forgiven; but it was also that cold, analytical, almost sc ientific side of Ludwig, remorselessly fo llowing his experiment to its inexorable conclusion: he had discovered or rediscovered that the pian o is, among other things, a percussion instrument and he was following the logic of that insight, as he followed every musical idea, to wherever it led hi m, to whatever abyss. And, after thinking all that, Polly Esth er knew she still di dn't understand the Hammerklavier; b ut as it banged and howled to its defiant conclusion, she got a flash of one aspect she had never registered before. It was the last scene of Papillon, when after twelve years of horror, Steve McQueen finally escapes from Devil's Island on his homemade raft of coconut shells and floats off into the Atlantic, as Ludwig floats off at the end of the Hammerklavier, shouting to the hostile sea and the indifferent sky: \"I'M STILL HERE, you sons-of-bitches!\" And, after that, Polly Esther was cleaned out, drained, purified; no more triangles haunted her. She turned off the stereo, yawned contentedly, and padded back to her bed. Her lover was still sleeping, twisted around in the covers so that her right leg stuck out, decorated with goose pimples from the cold air. Polly Esther rearranged the bedding to cover the girl, and climbed in beside her, hugging her tenderly once, but not enough to waken her. Then there we re only a few remembered bars of the Hammerklavier and one more trio drifted up (Wyatt, Morgan, and Vergil, the Earp brot hers), and then Po lly Esther slept.

Dr. Dashwood made a mistake. He assumed this was another hoax by the enigmatic Ezra Pound. Polly Esther Doubleknit was a devout Roman Catholic and went to Confession that Saturday. \"I did a naughty-naughty with a Secretary again,\" she said. \"How shocking,\" said her Confessor in a profoundly bored tone. \"Was she cute?\" \"She was an absolutely ador able little blond creature.\" \"I hope you both enjoyed yourselves,\" said the priest. \"But why are you telling me about this hedonic little escapade?\" Polly Esther whispered, \"I guess I feel guilty. I was raised Baptist, you know.\" \"But you're a Catholic now,\" the priest, Father Starhawk, sa id. \"And as a convert, you probably know the theology better than people who were born into it. Now, tell me: What is a sin?\" \"A sin,\" Polly Esther recited promptly, \"is to knowingly hurt a sentient being.\" \"Except where it would be a greater sin, a greater hurt, to refrain.\" Father Starhawk went on. \"That's why it's no sin to kill a virus, remember. Now, did you hurt your cute little blond playmate?\" \"No, of course not.\" \"Did you make her happy?\" \"I think so,\" Polly Esther said wistfully. \"She wants to see me again Monday night.\" \"Then I think you made her happy, \" Father Starhawk said. \"How ma ny times did she reach Millett?\" \"Six or seven, I think.\" \"Then I'm sure you made her happy,\" the priest said kindly. \"As a mere male, I must say I envy the female capacity for multiple Millett. Now, obviously, your little party with this S ecretary was not harmful, but joyful. So it was not a sin, but t he opposite of a sin, a work of virtue. And you know the teachings of Moral Theology well enough to unders tand that, so why are you wasting my time?\" \"I guess it's just my Baptist upbringing,\" Polly Esther murmured. \"You must clear your mind of a ll superstition,\" the priest said, \"because such nonsense muddies the in tellect and keeps you from thinking clearly about Real moral issues. Now, do you have something Real to confess?\" \"Yes,\" Polly Esther said nervously. \"Well?\" Father Starhawk's jovial tone suddenly turned stern. \"I think some of my money comes from slum properties.\" Polly c hoked, then sighed deeply. It wa s a relief to say it, to have it out in the open. \"You think?\" the priest cried angrily. \"You haven't found out fo r sure? How long have you had this suspicion?\" 187 / 233"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"\"Since about a week ago last Thursday.\" \"And what efforts have you made to find the facts about this grave matter, which may be, I remind you, a mortal sin?\" Polly Esther trembled. \"I tried,\" she said, \"but the way corpora tions are these days ... I get tw elve different stories every t ime I ask the lawyers . . . but I really think we own some of the worst parts of Newark.\" The priest was silent for a long time. \"It's my fault,\" he said finally. \"I was never strict en ough with you. Wh at is the first moral law about money?\" \"To ensure that no human being was being hurt in acquiring it, and if anyone was hurt, to return the money to them and make whatever other restitution is morally necessary.\" \"To ensure,\" Father Starhawk repeated so lemnly. \"Saint Francis Xavier said that many centuries ago, a great and holy saint, and he specifically instructed priests to be certain that nobody received Absolution until th ey had given up all monies acquired from usury or other social injustices. That was long be fore Pope Stephen, my child, and it is the moral backbone of the Church. I cannot give you Absolution until you have exa mined your conscience on this matter and made whatever change is morally necessary.\" \"I'll have a special Board meeting and get to the bottom of it,\" Polly Esther said. \"Thank you, Father, for restoring my vision of Reality.\" \"That is the function of the Ch urch,\" Father Starhawk said. And then he added, softly: \"Pray for me, please. I am a sinner, also.\" Father Starhawk was a Cherok ee Indian and a Stephenite. The Stephenites were the most radical of all the Catholic clergy and made even the Neo-Jesuits, under General Berrigan, seem like milkwater liberals by comparison . There was virtually no nation on Earth which didn't have several Stephenites in prison for what the Stephenites cal led \"following the laws of God rather than the laws of man.\" Members of the Stephenite order absolutely refused to countenanc e any behavior that fell short of the ideals in the late Pope Stephen's encyclicals on Social Justice; and hat the Stephenites would not countenance, they would resist. It was the passive, nonviolent nature of their resistance that made the Stephenites so troublesome to persons in authority; it is impossible to jai l nonviolent idealists without a large part of the world sympathizing with them. Father Starhawk had served three terms hi mself, for passively resisting Unistat's wars against Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the People's Republic of Hawaii. Like all Stephenites, he wrote the familiar lapel button with a photo of Pope Stephen, the famous black patch over his blind eye, and the sainted Pope's famous remark, \"What- me infallible?\" Pope Stephen had totally revolutionized the Catholic Church durin g his brief five-year reign. In deed, as the French feminist Jeanne Paulette Sartre said, \"This one ma n has single-handedly turned the most react ionary church on th is planet into the most progressive.\" It was due to Pope Stephen that the \"social gospel,\" previous ly preached only by a minority of far-out Jesuits and worker- priests, became the official Vatican polic y. By being the first to denounce Hitler and Mussolini, and ex communicating their supporters, Pope Stephen had knowingly risked the biggest rupt ure within the Church since the time of Luther; but, while nearly 30 percent of the Catholics in Germ any and Italy continued to fo llow their national leaders, over 70 percent obeyed the Pope, and both dictators fell from power. Adolf Hitler became a portrait painter again; and Benito Mussolin i, deprived of power, returned to his early belief in anarchism and spent his declining years writing fiery journalism against all those who did manage to achieve and hold on to political power. At the time of Pope Stephen's death in 1940, it was es timated that the wealth of the Vatican was less than 10 p ercent of what 188 / 233"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"it had been when he took the Chair of Peter, but its presti ge about 1,000 percent higher. The Pope had spent 90 percent of the Va tican's wealth in projects for the abolition of poverty, disease, and ignorance. Many regarded him as a saint, but Pope Stephen always tried to discourage that view. He ended every conversation with \"I am a sinner, also,\" which became a habit with Stephenites: Father Starhawk, for instance, ended all his conversations that way, and also used it for the tag line of all his theological articles and hi s private correspondence. It must be admitted, however, that the first Irish Pope did ha ve his own brand of arrogance: He believed he was the best Latin stylist since Cicero, and was rather vain about his comma nd of English, Italian, French, German, Spanish, Danish, and Hebrew, also. He was also convinced that he was a greater ps ychologist than James or Jung, and it was only when their names were mentioned that a tinge of un charitable sarcasm would enter his speech. Pope Stephen, in fact, had a habit of listening far more than he spoke, which led many to regard him as a bit aloof. Actually, he spoke little because he was so busy observing. This passion for studying other human beings had gradually turned him from a disputatious young intellectual into an almost pathologically sensit ive middle-aged man, because the more he observed people, the more he liked them, and the more he like d them, the less able he was to bear seeing or hearing of injustice to an yone anywhere. On one occasion a learned and erudi te French Cardinal said to the Pope, referr ing to the steady parade of visitors to the Vatican, \"You must find most of these nonentities profoundly boring.\" He was making the usual mistake of interpreting the Pope's long silence as a sign of ennui. \"But-there are no bores,\" Stephen said, shocked. \"You are being paradoxical,\" the Cardinal chided. \"Not at all,\" the Pope said dogmatically. \"I have never met a boring human being.\" It was the only time anybod y ever heard him pontificate. It was due to Pope Stephen that every Catholic priest was not only allowed, but encouraged, to get married. \"Living with the mystery of the feminine mind,\" he said, \"is the best training for trying to cope with the gr eater mysteries of the Divine mind.\" He himself had married a peasant girl from Galway, who was said to be barely literate, and his love for her was legendary. N obody knew what the Pope and his wife ever found to talk about, since she obviously did not share any of his intellectual interests. Actually, with his wife, as with most of humanity, the Irish Pope spent most of his time listening, not talking. Because of the liberality of his sexual views, the Irish Pope was still controversial among conservative Catholics, who claimed he was a pervert and were forever trying to have him posthumously excommunicated. They also spread rumors about his private life, which had gain ed so much currency that wh enever his name was mentioned somebody would mutter \"garters, garters, garters.\" Pope Stephen's whole philosophy was derived from a single sentence in Aquinas: A d pulchritudinem tria requiruntur: integritas, consonantia, claritas. Which may be rendered: Three things are required for beau ty: wholeness, harmony, radiance. It was Stephen's thought that the universe, as the product of a Great Artist, must be comprehensible in terms of integritas, 189 / 233"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"consonantia, claritas- wholeness, harmony, radiance. Why, then, he asked himself, does it not appear so to the ordinary human mind? The only answer he could find was that we are not paying attention. We have not learned to observe closely enough. We do not have the Artist's eye for detail. And so Pope Stephen paid very close attention to everything that entered his field of perception. At the time of the Irish Pope's death in 1940, obituary writers all over the world compared hi m to every saint and sage in history: Buddha, Whitman, Plotinus, Rumi, Dante, Eckhart, John of Arc, St. Terrence of Avilla, and so on, and on; but the one who came closest to categorizing how Stephen's mind work ed was an obscure Canadian professor of literature who wrote, \"The only mind in history comparab le to Stephen's was that of a fictitious character-Mr. Sherlo ck Holmes of Baker Street.\" Like Tobias Knight, Pope Stephen had spent all his life \"trying to find out what the hell was really going on,\" although he never expressed it that way. He had decided that what was going on was that everybody was very carefully avoiding paying attention to what was going on. The Stephenites called them selves \"Seekers of the Real\" and were always watching very closely to see what was going on. They all had posters in their rooms with the sainted Pope's famous remark: \"If you don't pay attention to every little detail, you miss most of the jokes.\" When Dr. Dashwood went out to lunch that day, he was stopped on the street by a haggard and wild-eyed minor bureaucrat who said his name was Joseph K. \"They have everybody mind-warped,\" Joseph K. said, clutching Da shwood's sleeve desperately. \"Yes, yes,\" Dashwood said, trying to disent angle himself. \"But I really must hurry-\" \"What are the charges against me?\" Joseph K. demanded. \"What are the charges against any of us? We all try to obey their rules, don't we? Of course we do; we know what will happen at the slightest, the most minute, the most microscopic infraction, do we not? Not that I mean to imply that they are wrong, necessarily, or unjust- you won't find any subversive literature or pornography in my room, I can assure you absolutely-no, certainly not unjust or in any way unfair, but it must be admitted that in the application of the rules, in the application, I say, they are sometimes overfinicky, a bit strained and literal, if you take my meaning.\" \"Certainly, certainly,\" Dashwood said, struggling to remove Jose ph K.'s fingers from his sleeve. \"But if you were to see a good counselor-not a psychiatrist, nece ssarily ... I don't mean to imply-\" \"We are all guilty,\" Joseph K. said flatly. \"They have establis hed so many rules, and recorded them in archives that the ordinary citizen cannot consult, that we must all, the most loya l and decent of us, stumble on a mere technicality occasionally. Not that I mean to assert that technicalities are not necessary, you understand, since it is important to spell o ut in detail the exact meaning intended in a statute, don't you agree, George?\" \"Frank,\" Dashwood said automatically. Joseph K. suddenly looked sly. \"Oh,\" he said slowly, \"you claim that you are not George Dorn? How clever of them, although I can't imagine how they persuaded you, but of course a man of your moral principles would not be bribed, certainly. They must have convinced you it was for my own good in some absolute metaphysical sense, right? Certainly. You would not work for them out of malice, would you?' He released Dashwood with a poignant, despairing gesture. \"You mean well, he said. \"They all mean well, I know. But I am innocent, I tell you!\" He backed away. \"And you are George Dorn, and I am not deceived,\" he added bitterly. Then he turned and ran. PARAREALISME 190 / 233"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" The big news of the 1985 season in the art world was th at Francois Loup-Garou had abandoned Neo-Surrealism and founded a new school of art called Pararealisme. This was only partly the result of the Rehnquist in the Lobster Newburg; it was also a matter of economics. For nearly a century, it had been very impo rtant for an artist to belong to a \"school,\" and it was even better to be the founde r of a \"school.\" This was not just a case of \"In Union There Is Strength\"; it was also a shrewd marketing strategy. It might take an individual painter ten or twenty years to be \"discovered\" -if he were original, it might take much longer, and he might not be alive to enjoy it-but when a School of Art was fo rmed, that was News, and all members of the school were discovered simultaneously. There had been an Impressionist school, a Post-Impressionist school, an Expressionist school, an Abstract Expressionist school, a Cubist school, a Futurist school, a Pop school and an Op school, and so on. Francois Loup-Garou had noticed that the commercial life of each sc hool was getting shorter all th e time, due to the accelerated in tensity of competition: Neo- Surrealism was already being eclipsed, as an object of news and debate, by the Neo-Cubism of the American, Burroughs. He decided it was time to launch a new school. After the experience of the Rehnquist in the Lobster Newburg, Pararealisme seemed appropriate to him. According to Standard Operatin g Procedure, he got a few friends together a nd they began issuing Proclamations denouncing all other schools (especially Neo-Cubism) as obsolete and reactionary. This got them into the Art Journals and into some newspapers. Then they held their own first show, and that got them into the international news magazines. They were news; it didn't really matter if their paintings were any good at all. In fact, their paintings were rather good, in a fey sort of way. They had revived traditional \"representational\" art (everything th ey did was as naturalistic as a news photograph), but with a difference that made a difference. The largest canvas at the first Para realiste show was Loup-Garou's own What Do You Make of This, Professor? An enormous work it was, covering two walls, bent in the middle on a special hinged frame. It showed a cerulean-blue sky, with hailstones: thousands and thousands of hailstones, si x months' painstaking labor, and each hailstone had a tiny image o f the Virgin Mary on it. Puzzled viewers might have found some enlightenment in the First Pararealiste Manifesto: We of the Pararealiste movement, recognizin g the meaninglessness of this chaos that fools call life, find the relevance of existence only in its monstrosities. But we are not Existentialists or anything of that sort, than k God; and besides, the perversities of humanity have grown boring. After the Fernando Poo Incident, what can a mere man do that will shock us? It is the abnormalities of nature that we find illuminating; that is what distinguishes us fr om sadists, New Leftists, and other intellectual hoodlums. We are delighted that Pluto, Mickey, and Goofy are all at odd angles from the plan e of the eight inner planets. We are thrilled with Bohr's great prin ciple of Relativity, which shows that to look out into space is al so to look backward in time. WE ARE THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY!!! Some said that the Pararealistes were even better at writing ma nifestos than at painting pict ures; but they meant what they said. The hailstones in What Do You Make of This, Professor? were no image of dream or de lirium-\"We spit on surrealism! Fantasy is every bit as dreary as Logic! It is the REAL that we seek!\" the Firs t Manifesto had also declared. What Loup- Garou had so painstakingly depicted was an occurrence that actually happened at Lyons in 1920. Xeroxes of the old newspaper stories about the event (\" PEASANTS SEE VIRGIN ON HAILSTONES\" ) were distributed to the press, emphasizing again that Pararealistes only painted the real, or as they always wrote, the REAL. 191 / 233"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Little Pierre de la Nuit-Pierrot le Fou, he styled himself- was Loup-Garou's best friend and had contributed seventeen canvases to the first show. Magnificent, monstrous things they were, of course-flying saucers, all of them: blue and gold and silver and green and bright orange, shaped like doughnuts or boo merangs or ellipsoids or cones. Every one of them had been reported in the sky by somebody or other in the past forty years. Loup-Garou circulated news stor ies about each sighting, you can be sure, to demonstrate again pararealisme's devotion to the REAL. Then there was Jean Cul's The Sheep-Cow; some claimed it was the greatest of all Pa rarealiste paintings. It portrayed an animal half-sheep and half-cow, a veritable insult to the laws of genetics. Such an animal had been born in Simcoe, Ontario, in 1888. They circulated news stories about it. All of this created so much international discussion that the Pararealistes immediately releas ed the second Manifesto. (They had learned something about P.R. from the early surrealists.) They denounced those who did not like their paintings as fools. They then denounced those who did like their paintings as damned fools, for liking them for the wrong reasons. Th ey went on to fulminate ag ainst everybody in general: We renounce and hurl invective upon the rationalist conducting experiments in his laboratory. Every instrument he uses is a creation of human narcissism; it emerges from the human ego as Athene from the head of Zeus. The rationalist imposes his own order on these instruments; they impose order on the data; an d he then proclaims that the un iverse is as constipated and mechanistic as his own mind! What has this epis temo-logical masturbation to do with the REAL? And we abominate and cast fulminations upon the irrationalist, also. Behold him, in his drugged stupor, maddened by opium or hashish, gazing inward and depicting his childish dream and nightmares on canvas. He is as limited by the human unconscious as the rationalist is by the human co nscious. Neither of th em can see the REAL!!! It reads better in the original French. But it would have been a top news story if it hadn't been eclipsed by the singularly obscene \"miracle\" at Canter bury Cathedral that week. The details of the alleged \"miracle\" had been censored and covered up by high Church officials from the very beginning. N ewspapers, at first, printed on ly short items saying that something strange cau sed the Archbishop of Canterbury to turn a ghastly white during Mass and stumble so badly that he fell off the altar. Of course some cynics immediately assu med that His Eminence was as drunk as a skunk. There are always types like that, believing the worst of everybody. Then the rumors started to circ ulate. Those who had been in the Cathedral sa id that the Most Reverend Archbishop had not so much stumbled as jumped, and that his expression was one of such fear and loathing that all present felt at once that something distinctly eldritch and unholy had invaded the church. Others, imaginativ e types and religious hysterics, claimed to have felt something cold and clammy moving in the air, or to have seen \"auras.\" By the time the rumors had gone three times around the Unit ed Kingdom and twice around Europe, there were details that came out of the Necronomicon or the grim fictions of Stok er, Machen, Walpole. Horned men, Things with tentacles, and Linda Lovelace were promin ently featured in thes e embroidered versions of the Cant erbury Horror, as it was beginning to be called. The press, of course, got more interested at this point, and the Reverend Archbishop was constantly besieged to conform or deny the most outlandish and distasteful reports about what had occurred. At first His Emin ence refused to speak to the press at all, but finally, by the time some sca ndal sheets were claiming that Nyarlathotep, the mad faceless god of Khem, had appeared on the altar bellowing Cthulhu fthagn!, the Archbishop issued a terse stat ement through his Press Secretary. \"Nothing untoward happened. His Eminence merely tripped on the altar rug, and any further discussion would be futile.\" This merely fanned the flam es of Rumor, of course. One legend circulated even more than th e others, perhaps because it appealed to pr urient interest, or maybe just because it was the version given by a few people who had actually been in the Cathedral during Mass. According to this yarn, a miraculous flying Rehnquist- just like the ones in the murals at Pompeii, except that it didn't have wings-had soared across the front of the church, barely missing His Eminence's high episcopal nose. 192 / 233"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The judicious, of course, did not credit this wild rumor. They were all coming around, as the judicious usually do, to the view of the cynics. The Archbishop, they said, had been stewed to the gills. His Eminence was no fool, however. After the first shock, he had begun his own investigation, aided by a few trusted deacons. They found the slingshot, abandoned, on the floor of the first pew, to the right. That was the direction the Rehnquist had come from, and they all br eathed a sigh of relief. The Archbishop told th em, then, the rumors he had heard about the incident of the Unistat Ambassador who had to be put on morphine after finding It, wrapped in pink ribbon, on a staircase. \"We are dealing with a deranged mind,\" His Eminence said, \"but not with anything 'supernatural,' thank God.\" They never found the Rehnquist, but as the Archbishop pointed out, \"the perpetrator may have confederates.\" Everybody tried to remember who had been sitting in the extrem e right of the first pew. They carefully made up a list, including everybody's separate memories, half-memories, or pseudo-memories. Th e list looked like this: Lord and Lady Bugge the Hon.

Fission Chips, F.R.S. and Eva Gebloomenkraft \"One name seems to stand out, doesn't it?\" asked His Eminence. \"Eva Gebloomenkraft,\" said a deacon. \"Isn't she that Jet Set m illionairess who got into so much trouble in Unistat two years ago for putting laughing gas in the air conditioning system at a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff?\" The sudden death of Bonny Benedict created waves of confusio n and apprehension far beyond what ordinarily would have resulted from such a tragic accident. The first one affected was Polly Esther Doubleknit, who called down from her exec utive office to the City Desk at once. \"What the hell happened to Bonny?\" she demanded. The City Editor spoke in a hoarse croak. \"It seems to be what the TV news said, a heart attack.\" He was beginning to feel that he'd be the next victim, since his blood pressure seemed to be rising every minute. \"A heart attack?\" Polly Esther was du mbfounded. \"But what about the man?\" \"He's being held, of course,\" the City Editor said. \"But God knows what they'll charge him with-manslaughter, negligent homicide, who knows? There's never been a case like this before.\" \"They had better charge him with something,\" Polly Esther said crisply. \"Or this paper will land on the D.A.'s office with all four feet. Do I make myself clear?\" Admiral Babbit nearly jumped out of his skin when the news reached Washington. \"It's those Briggsing Bryanting faggots from Alexandria!\" he screamed. \"And they're gonna try to pin it on us!\" This was a defensive ove r -reaction caused by the fact that Old Iron Balls had been contemplat ing various ways of bringing 193 / 233"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"about the demise of Ms. Benedict. But he distrusted Einstein and neuroanalysis-\"Jewish eggh ead stuff\"-and never realized that most of his mentations cons isted of defensive over-reactions. \"I'll fix those Rehnquist-suckers,\" he said to an aide. \"Get old de la Plume, and tell him I've got a big job for him.\" This referred to Mr. Shemus de la Plum e, Naval Intelligence's ace handwriting forger. And so, within thirty-six hours, the Washington Post had come into possession of a diary, allegedly written by John Disk, the man who had killed Bonny Benedict. The diary only looked cryptic at first glance. With a little study, anybody with at least two inches of forehead could figu re out, from the abbreviations and clumsy codes used, that Disk had been an employee of the Centra l Intelligence Agency. This was quite a shock to both Disk and the CIA, who had never had any connection with each other. Actually, Disk had been raised in the True Holy Roman Ca tholic Church, a bizarre fascistoid splinter group which had broken with the Vatican during the reign of Pope Stephen of Dublin. When Disk reached his adolescence in the ear ly 1970s, however, strange things began to happen to him. At first he thought it was demons-he had seen The Exorcist and believed every bit of it-but his prie st told him it was all because he kept Lourding himself. Disk went to Confession every time he gave in to the tempta tion to Lourde-off, which was five times a week after he reached seventeen, and the priest kept tellin g him to use Self-Control and take cold show ers. The priest also said that all the demons were in hell and Johnny should stop worrying about them. The only people who believed in demonic possession, the priest said, were the benighted fanatics in the Orthodox Holy Roman Catholic Church. Everybody in the True Holy Roman Catholic Church desp ised and hated the members of the Orthodox Holy Roman Catholic Church, which was another splinter group that had broken away from the Vatican during the reign of Pope Stephen. The members of the Orthodox Holy Roman Catholic Church hated them back, you can be sure. In fact, in the typical manner of splinter gro ups, they each hated the other more than they hated the common enemy, the heretics in the Vatican. John Disk finally decided that what was wrong with him was not caused by demons and-since he was able to cut down on his Lourding-off to only twice a week after he passed twenty-it wasn 't entirely caused by Sin, either. He was being poisoned. The reason he had cycles of agitation an d elation, followed by cycles of anxi ety and growing fear that everything was somehow unreal, was because he was eating an Impure diet. The reason there were wars and rumors of wars, and revolutions and depressions, and pornography and lewd, sinful women in immodest clothing on every street was because all the food was full of toxic, mind-dest roying chemicals. The people responsible for this were the Triangular Commi ssion, the Power Elite, the Elders of Zion, the Bavarian Illuminati, and the Ameri can Medical Association. He had learned this by reading books on Organic Diet from bookstores run by the John Birch Society, the Natural Hygienists, the Purity of Ecology Party, and various other grou ps who were inclined to go through cycles of agitation, elation, anxiety, feelings of unreality , etc., and had realized this was caused by Impurity of Essence in their food. John Disk read a great deal of this literature and changed his mind about twenty times before he finally decided which school of \"correct nutr ition\" was really correct. He decided Purity of Ecology was the group that really knew what the hell was going on. He believed every word in Unsafe Wherever You Go by POE's founder, Furbish Lousewart. By the age of twenty-three, Disk was a typical POE member. When not putting in his thirty hours a week working in their printing plant-where he received lodging and an Organic Diet in lieu of pay-he was out on the streets selling their newspaper, Doom, or giving away their fou r - p age mini- p amphlets, which had titles like Poison in Every Pot; Science: 194 / 233"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Satan's Plot Against God and Man; and Jimmy Carter, Servant of th e Jesuit-Zionist Conspiracy. POE hated President Carter because he had defeated Furbish Lousewart in the 1980 election. But, with the typical logic of splinter groups, they did not hate Carter nearly as much as they hated Eve Hubbard, of the Libertarian Immortalist Party, who also got more votes than Lousewar t, even though sh e came in third. The POE people hated the Libertarian Immortalists for anothe r reason, which was that the LIP platform was blasphemous and unpatriotic. Hubbard's slogan was \"No more death and taxes.\" She planned to end taxes by running the government like a prof it-sharing corporation, termina ting all interference in the internal affairs of other countries (thus allowing the military budget to be cut every year, inst ead of growing every year), an d paying each citizen a dividend on the pr ofits the Unistat Corp oration earned through investin g in space colonization to tap into the vast energy and resources of Free Space. Hubbard planned to end death by investing the profits fr om space in longevity re search, which th e majority of scientists in the field were now convinced could lead to doubling or tripling th e human life span in the first generation, and could lead to indefinite expansion thereafter. The POE people realized that these pr oposals were scientific and rational. They therefore regarded them as Satanic. After three years in POE, John Disk still had cycles of agitation and unreality; but the leaders of the cult assured him that i t took at least that long for the poisons in his previous diet to leave his system totally. If he stayed on the correct POE diet, they insisted, he would become as serene as they were. Still, things were getting to be more unreal more of the time. Disk looked in the mirror one morning, combing his hair, and seemed to see a middle-aged man looking out at him. It was on ly a flash, a single crack in the fabric of time, but it was unnerving. When the face turned back to his own-young, black-hai red, pale-he wondered for a w ild moment if he were truly a young man who had had a vision of himself twenty years older or a midd le-aged man who was now having a hallucination of himself twenty years younger. But that was only a short fugue, for in a mo ment he recognized that the face in the mirror was not his tw enty-years-later, but rather a face that had adorned the cover of Time magazine a few months ago. It wa s the face of Dr. Francis Dashwood, president of Orgasm Research In c., Commie pervert Satanist sinner who spent most of his time observing things that John would like to do but was afraid to do because of twenty years of conditioning by the True Holy Roman Catholic Church. Which was bad enough, certainly, but not as bad as what was to come: voices at first so faint as to be barely perceptible, but slowly and insidiously growing louder, voices which were female and kept saying You are George Dorn and Imagine you can see my Brownmillers through my sweater and The interpenetration of the universes has begun, but mostly saying over and over You are George Dorn. And there were occasions, only a second in external time but stretching to infinity in a multiple of new dimensions he found or created within, when the Sages would gather him into their Maybe realm (\"In addition to a Yes and a No, the universe contains a Maybe\" was the password to pass the Lurker at the Threshold) and there would be Jesus saying \"Is it not written, Ye are Gods?\" and Emperor Norton saying \"I just made myself Emperor of Unistat, Protector of Mexico, and King of the Jews,\" and Fed Xing saying \"There are many universes and mind -states\" and Beethoven singing the evolutionary scenario in eight cycles and Great Chtulhu's Starry Wisdom Band and Glorious Lucifer Son of the Morning who had never fallen because the message of the scriptures was written backward in a mirror and then Linda Lovelace would come in and start doing disgusting immoral things and he would be back, the splinter of eternity contracting the Euclidean 3-D, standing on a street handing out Poison in Every Pot and wondering if he was losing his mind. But the good parts of it were so good, Jesus and the we ird but wise Emperor Norton and so me of the Space Brothers, that he wished it would continue, if on ly it didn't keep turning into that sinful and disgusting bu siness about Linda Lovelace; but he was beginning to figure it out; he was not the fool they thought him-not by a long shot. He knew that, now that the poisons in the food were beginning to wear off They had started aiming an electronic Thought Control machine at his brain, so he did not pay attention no matter how many times the seductive female voice said YOU ARE GEORGE DORN YOU ARE GEORGE DORN YOU ARE GEORGE DORN.

Things were coming to a head. N athaniel F. X. Drest, s ecret chief of the Unistat Sector CIA, had felt uneasy for a long tim e. Since the death of President Carter, in fact. It wasn't just that th e then-Vice President, now-Pre sident, Hugh Crane, was righ t out of nowhere, a total unknown, not one of THEM; similar situations had arisen a few times in the past, and the novice had easily been initiated into the secret science of Strange Loops an d Mind Control, seduced-without the necessity of bribery, cajolery, or threats-into gladly becoming one of THEM. No: the unsettling thing was that Carter's death was unplanned, random, a surprise to everyone; it might even have been due to natural causes. Yes: things were definitely an d bodaciously coming to a head. N athaniel Drest had not lasted as secret chief of the CIA for thirty years without acquiring great pragmatic savvy about the spooky side of predestination. \"Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is en emy action\" had been the motto of one of the great masters of St range Loops, lan Fleming himself; but Drest knew that what was really going on was far weirder than even Flem ing could comprehend. Behind the mild, professori al, bespectacled facade of Nathaniel Drest, officially liste d as economics researcher in the budget reports, was the one man capable of serving as secret chief of the Unistat CI A through thirty long years, while one dummy after another posed as the official head of the clandestine organization. Drest was a philosopher and a visionary; he had forged, from Machiavelli, Marx, Lenin, Mao, Mussolini, Niet zsche, Napoleon, William F. Buckley, Jr., and the Three Legendary Sages- Turing, Fleming, Wheatley-the coldly logical, existential, pragmatic strategy for eternal rule by himself and his friends in THEM, and total extermination and eradication of all possibility of rebellion by the rest of humanity. He had been told once, by a sociobiologist, that he was a giant DNA robot, programmed to advance the growth and expansion of his gene pool. He thought that was an amusing, although limited, view of what was going on; and he certainly had no interest in such evolutionary theories as justifications of what he did. He needed no justifications; that his goals wer e rationally desirable to him was all that was necessary or profitab le to contemplate. The world certainly deserved to be ruled by his gene pool, by those White Anglo-Saxon Presbyterians and Episcopalians who had gone to Groton and Harvard, and occasionally there woul d be room for a bright boy from Yale, and this was so obvious that it needed no long-range evolutionary justifications. You just had to look around the world to see that no other gene pool was smart enough, tough enough, and fundamentally liberal enough to do the job justly and wisely. John Ruskin and Cecil Rhodes had seen th e choice a century ago; a wo rld ruled by one Anglo oligarchy on scientific and socialist principles, or a world of anarchy and chaos, with constant wars and revolutions. Of cour se, there had been some anarchy, chaos, wars, and revo lutions since Drest had taken over, but that was due to surviving ideological poisons on the international system and would be cured when the planet had been on the correct , Drest-directed mental diet for a few more decades. But things were coming to a he ad. The damned Ruskies stil l obstinately clung to th eir obsolete Adam Smith economics, and much of the Islamic world was unruly and rebellious. But worst of all was the Discordian Society. Drest knew all about the Discordian Societ y, or thought he did. He was convinced they were behind this latest attempt to 196 / 233"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"discredit the Company with that forged diary linking them to th e Bonny Benedict \"Cream Pie\" mu rder. He also believed that they were the secret organization behi nd all the lesser conspiracies that an noyed and sometimes frustrated him-the malignantly nihilistic Network that had Potter Stewarted his own computer and God knows how many other computers, the dupes in POE and the Libertaria n Immortalist Party, th e damned moralistic meddlesome St ephenites, Weather Underground, the traitors over at Naval Intelligence, the sinister Invisible Hand Society, the terroristic Morituri, and the damned Ruskies and Arabs. Drest had first learned about the Discordian Soci ety in a strange, obscene, subversive novel called Illuminatus! He was convinced it was all fiction at first. But then he discovered that the alleged Bible of the Discordians, the perverse and paradoxical Principia Discordia, actually existed. When he put two men on th e case they soon reported that copies of the P rincipia could be found in many science-fiction and libertarian bookstores all over Unistat, and that it could be ordered through the mail from a company absurdly and disarmingly named Loom-panics Unlimited in Port Townsend, Washington. Of course he wanted to believe that was all there was to it, ju st a small, oddball cult no more likely to influence events than the Libertarian Immortalists were. But then bit by bit the damning de tails accumulated. Emperor Jo shua Norton, King of the Jews, was a Discordian saint, and Empero r Norton was also inexplicably becoming an \"in\" person. There was a play about Emperor Norton running in San Francisco, posters celebrating him for sale all over the country. The Discordian mantra \"Fnord\" was seen scrawled on walls in mo re and more places, and on the pyramid on the back of the do llar bill. Characters in Illuminatus!, who he had assumed were fictional, often appeared writing book or movie reviews for various magazines, and a check showed that they had been writing letters to the Playboy Forum and the Chicago newspapers since the early 1960s. Discordian cabals ap peared in England, Germany, Japan, Australia, and the most unlikely places. Drest had made a careful study of the Discordian philosophy a nd realized it was the kind of outlandish nonsense that would appeal to the kind of people who made all the trouble in hist ory-brilliant, intellectual, slightly deranged dope fiends and oddball math-and-technology buffs. Many of the pioneer Discordi ans were computer programmers (he remembered that fact every time the Company's computer an swered a simple program with GIVE ME A COOKIE or THE GOVERNMENT SUCKS) and others had documented links with the Libertarian Immortalists, the LSD subculture , and groups as sinister as the witches and the anarchists. The Discordians believed that God was a Cr azy Woman. For the Woman part of it, th ey used the usual Taoist and Feminist arguments about the Creative Force being dark, female, subtle, fecund, and in every way opposite to Male Authoritarianism. For the Crazy part, they pointed to Pickering's Moon, which goes around backward, to rains of crabs and periwinkles and live snakes, to the paradoxes of quantum theory, and to the reli gious and political behavior of humanity itself, all of which, they claimed, demonstrated that the fabr ic of reality was a mosaic of chaos, co nfusion, deception, de lusion, and Strange Loops. And, Drest knew, they were definitely linked with the Network. Although computer specialists only spoke of the Network in whispers, the Company had a detailed file on them. The Network was devoted to the long-suppressed, much persecuted, but persistent underground religion of cocai ne founded by the eccentric p hysician Sigmund Freud. They devoutly believed in the literal truth of Freud's vision of the Superman. (\"What is man? A bridge between the primate and the superman-a bridge over an abyss,\" Freud wrote in his Diary of a Hope Fiend.) To achieve the Superman, the Network was systematically frustrating every other group of conspirato rs on the planet by glitching the computers, and meanwhile diverting funds from legitimate activities to subsidize dissident scientists engaged in research on immortality and higher intelligence. \"Cocaine is a memory of the future\" was the sick slogan of this misguide d group of deranged intellectuals. \"Our minds will function as ecstatically as on cocaine, without the jitters, once we achieve immortality and learn to repro-gram our brains as efficiently as we reprogram our computers,\" they went on. \"When we don't have to die and can constantly increase our awareness of detail,\" they also said, \"we will have no more problems, only adve ntures.\" Naturally, every gove rnment in the world, even the near-anarchistic Free Market maniacs in Russia, had outlawed this bizarre cult. An even more sinister Discordi an front organization, according to Drest's coldly logical analys is of what was really going on, was the insidious Invisible Hand Society. What was most devious about th e Invisible Hand-ers was that they disdained secrecy and operated ri ght out in the open, telling everybody what they were doing and why and what th ey hoped to accomplish. They ha d offices in all major cities and gave free courses in their politico-economic system just like the old Henry George schools at the turn of the century. It was very hard for Drest to persuade the other eight Unknown Men who ruled the CIA in other parts of the world that the Invisible Hand was the most dangerous sort of conspiracy. \"A conspiracy doesn't operate in the open,\" they kept reminding him. Sometimes they would tell him he was working too hard and should take a vacation. \"That's what's so subtle and devilish about it,\" Drest woul d explain, over and over. \"Nobody can recognize a conspiracy 197 / 233"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"that's out in the open. It's a kind of optical illusion that they're using to undermine us.\" \"But they don't believe we exist,\" he would be told. \"That's an oversimplification,\" he would insist. \"They admit we exist and occupy sp ace-time and so on. They just teach that all the titles we give ourselves are meaningless and all our acts are futile since the Invisibl e Hand controls everything, anyway.\" The other eight would again suggest that Dr est needed a vacation. Things were coming to a head. The first lesson given to people who signed up for the course of \"Political and Economic Reality\" at the Invisible Hand Society, Drest knew, concer ned policemen and soldiers. Two men in blue uniforms would appear on the stage, carrying guns. \"Blue uniforms are Real,\" the lect urer would say. \"Guns are Real. Policemen are a social fiction.\" Three men in brown uniforms would appear, carrying rifles. \"Brown uniforms are Real,\" the l ecturer would say. \"Rifles are Real . Soldiers are a social fiction.\" And so it would go, all through the lecture. Pure mind-rot, and, thank God, most people found it all so absurd, and yet so frightening, that they never came back for any of the subsequent lectures. But the people who did come back worried Drest; they were the types he loathed and feared. Like Cassius, they had a lean and hungry look and they thought too much. And they thought about the wrong things. And now there was the matter of the materializing-and-demateri alizing Rehnquist, obviously a Discordian plot, in Drest's estimation. What other group could conceive it, mu ch less organize and accomp lish it? Fnord, indeed! There had been the case of the Ambassador who found it on a staircase; and the antipornography crusader who encountered it, temporarily painted red, white, and blue, floating in a bowl of Fruit Punch; and that unspeakable incident involving His Eminence the Very Reverend Archbishop of Canterbury; and God knows how many other cases the Company had never heard about. And President Crane was said to be far more of an oddball than anybody had realized, having strange groups for midnight meetings in the Oval Room, where incense was burned in profusion, and the Secret Service men claimed to hear strange chants that sounded, they said, like \"Yog-Sothoth NeblodZin.\" Things were coming to a head. THE OLD-TIME RELIGION Charles Windsor, Prince of Wales, was a bout to be crowned King of England. It was a sacred occasion for a ll British subjects, still grievi ng for the Queen Mother, who ha d passed away so suddenly. But in the midst of the mourning, there was much excitement, since Charles would obviously make a smashing king; he was bright, he was witty, he was good-looking, and he had sense enough not to meddle in politics. There was one discordant voice in the crowd outside Buckingham Pa lace waiting for the new ki ng to return from the coronation at Westminster Abbey. This was a plump, stately young Irishman who kept singing, off key: 198 / 233"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"O won't we have a merry time Drinking whiskey, beer, and wine On coronation Coronation day Voices kept telling him to hush, but he would turn to such sp oilsports and say dramatically, \"The sacred pint alone is the lubrication of my Muse.\" \"Drunken ruffian,\" somebody muttered. \"Well, what if he is?\" the Irishman sa id suavely. \"He still looks like a king, and is that not what really matters?\" \"I wasn't calling the king a drunken ruffian,\" the voice protested, too emotionally. \" 'ere, now, who's calling me bloody king a ruffian?\" said a soldier. \"I'll knock the Potter Stewarting head off any Potter Stewarting Bryanter that says a word against me Potter Stewarting king!\" \"Hush,\" another chorus joined in. \"Don't hush me, you Bryanting sods!\" \"It's overcome I am entirely,\" the Irishman said, \"by the ro lling eloquence of your lean, unlovely English.

And other voices took up the cry: \"The king! The king!\" Eva Gebloomenkraft, certainly the loveliest woman in the crowd, had been listening to all this with her own private amusement, but now she reached down and began to open her purse, a bit stealthil y, perhaps, yet not qu ite stealthily enough, it seemed, for another hand closed abruptly over hers. \"Rumpole, CID, Scotland Yard,\" said a voice, as a badge was fl ashed briefly. \"I'm afraid you'll have to come along, miss.\" The Archbishop of Canterbury had shared his suspicions about Ms. Gebloomenkraft with the Yard, and they had been on the lookout for her all through coronation day. But when they had her back in the interrogation room on Bow Street, there was no Rehnquist in her purse. \"I sold it,\" she said after an hour of interrogation. And, at their baffled ex pressions, she added, \"It was becoming a bore. Th e j oke was wearing thin. I needed something else to excite me.\" \"That's why you do it, then?\" Inspect or Rumpole asked. \"For excitement?\" Eva raised weary eyes. \"When you have so much money that you can literally hire anybody to do literally anything, life does become tedious,\" she said. \"It requires some imagination, then, to restore zest to existence.\" And all she had in her purse was a self-inflating balloon, which, when the cap was crushed, e xpanded to a sphere nearly twenty feet in diameter bearing the slogan, in huge psychedelic colors: OVERALL THERE IS A SMELL OF FRIED ONIONS When next recorded the itinerant Rehnquist was in the possession of Lady Sybiline Greystoke, who had either purchased it directly from Ms. Gebloomenkraft or had acquired it from some go- b etween. 199 / 233"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Lady Sybiline was an eccentric, even for th e British nobility.

She was also, secretly, president of the Sappho Society, the group of aristocratic Lesbians who had secret ly governed England, behind the scen es, since their founder, Elizabeth I. Lady Sybiline and her good and intimate friend, Lady Rose Potting-Shedde, evidently fou nd great amusement, between them, with the Rehnquist, for they even took it with them when Lady Sybiline embarked, that summer, for her annual lion hunt in Kenya. Their White Hunter on that expedition was a red-faced man na med Robert Wilson, who, like Clem Cotex, knew he was living in a book. Robert Wilson had discovered this when somebody showed him the book in question. It was called Great Short Stories and was by some Yank named Hemingway. And there he was, Robert Wilson, playing a featured role in the very first story, \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.\" It was a shock, at first, to see himself in a book, and it was a bit thick to find his drinking and his red face described so dispassionately. It was like seeing yourself on the telly, suddenly observing the-man-who-was-you from outside. Then Wilson discovered that he was in another book, but changed in totally arbitrary ways that verged on surrealism. This book was a bit of tommyrot and damned filth called The Universe Next Door, and he was, in fact, both inside it and outside it, being both the author of it and a character in it. Robert Wilson began to experience cycl es of agitation, elatio n, anxiety, and a growing sense of unreality. Then came Lady Sybiline and Lady Rose and that mysterious object they kept in a small box and kept joking about, obscurely, between themselves. They called it Marion Brando. The river had pebbles at the bottom. They were shiny and small and the water rushed over them constantly and you could see clear to the other side of it if you had your glasses on an d weren't too drunk. Robert Wilson stared at the pebbles, thinking they were like pearls, trying not to remember what had happened that morning. \"After all, it was a clean kill,\" Lady Sybiline said beside him. He wished she wouldn't talk. He wished she would go away and take Marion Brando with her. \"The hills, in the distance,\" she said. \"They look like white rhinoceri.\" \"They look like white rhinoceri,\" he said. \"Jesus Christ.\" \"Don't talk that way.\" \"The bloody hills don't look at all like rhinoceri,\" he said. \"The y have no horns, for one thing.

But then the Rehnquist mysteriously disappear ed again, back in Nairobi, while Lady Sybiline and Lady Rose were staying at the glamorous new Mau Mau Hilton. Lady Sybiline was furious, but frustrated. There was no way of asking the hotel to question its employees about the theft without describing the object that had been stolen, and that was, of course, potentially embarrassing. But she and Lady Rose had lots of other exciting little games, and they soon forgot all about \"Marion Brando.\" Especially after they bough t a beautiful plastic-and-rubber imitation which they christen ed \"David Bowie.\" It wasn't really theft, of course; Indole Ringh was a pious and holy man who would never steal anything. It was his religious duty, as he conceived it, to remove the holy relic from the heathens and return it to its rightful homeland. Indole Ringh was a brown, gnarled, perpetually smiling little man, the offspring often gene rations of very conservative Hindus who had never accepted English ideas or ideals. He had, in fact, three personalities. One was just an ordina ry Hindu nobleman who was alwa ys smiling. The second, when he was in Samadhi, was an awe-inspiring guru, no more human than a statue of Brahma . The third, when he was in Dhyana, was just the brightest, quickest, most curious monkey in the jungle. He didn't believe in any of those personalities; he just watched them come and go, blandly indifferent. 201 / 233"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Because he practiced hatha yoga, bhakti yoga, rajah yoga, and gnana yoga, and because he smoked a great deal of bhang, he was as conscious of detail as Clem Cotex or the late Pope Ste phen. Because he believed the oldest Vedas were the important ones, he had no truck with modernistic notions of aceticism, Br itish prudery, or heathen Missionary nonsense of any sort. He was a devout worshiper of Shiva, god of sex, intoxication, death, and transformation. He believed that you couldn't come to your senses until you went out of your mind. He kept alive, within his own province, the an cient cult of Shiva-Kali, the divine couple whose embrace generate d the whole play of existence. And now, in Nairobi of all places, he ha d found, somehow in the posse ssion of a heathen Englishw oman, the most sacred of all lost relics-the Shivalingam itself, the engine of the creative lightning. So it was not theft at all; he was merely restorin g the relic to the place wher e it belonged, in India. In fact, he placed it on the altar in his own temple, and invited the whole province to come see it and marvel and know the power of the Divine Shiva, who possessed such a tool of creativity. He was going to restore the old-time religion. He made a speech to the assembled multitude on the first day the Shivalingam was displayed in the temple. He told them that the polarity of Shiva and Kali was the basic pulse of creation. He said the Chin ese dimly discerned this in their yin and y ang symbolism, and the heathen West in their concept of positively and negatively charged particles. He explained that the male-female polarity was the engine of creation, not just in th e human and animal kingdoms, but in every aspect of nature. He said that Samadhi and Dhyana and normal consciousness were equally real, equally unreal, and equally pointless, but that if you contemplated this Shivalingam long enough it wouldn't matter whether you understood any of this or not. He was so bombed on bhang that he kept going into Samadhi every few minutes during this, and the crowd, both his old disciples and newcomers, decided he was the wisest and holiest man in all India. Old Ringh kept smiling and going into Samadhi and explaining that we are all bisexual immortals who inhabit many universes and mind-states, and the crowd kept cheering and ge tting higher on his vibes, and finally they all went into the temple and contemplated the Shivalingam, where Indole Ringh had placed it on the al tar, facing the enor mous carving of the sacred yoni of the Black Goddess, Kali, and under the faded photograph of the Wise Man from the West, General Crowley, who, even though an English heathen, had understood the Mysteries and had spent many hours, while smoking bhang, discussing with Ringh's father how, even in mathematics, the sacred yoni appeared in both the shap e and the substance of 0, the void, while the lingam appeared in the shape and substance of 1, the cr eative lightning, and how, out of the union of the 0 and 1, all of the numbers of creation could be generated in binary notation. And as everybody meditated on the miraculous return of the Shivalingam, old Ringh remembered how General Crowley promised, when he had to return to the West, that he would use what he had learned in India to teach the whole world how the phallic spark of Imagination, represented by the 1 or lingam, generated everything out of absolute 0, the dark yoni, nothingness.

In fact, Clem had been a Scientologist, a solipsist, and a Logical Positivist, among other things, in the interim. Filling a pipe with Alamout Black, the hashish of the Assassins, Clem lit up, toked deeply, and began playing the tape of \"The Occult Technology of Money and the Moneylords.\" \"The Federal Reserve System-a private bank respon sible to nobody, despite its name-creates money out of nothing,\" N aismith began in a pleasant Texas twang. Clem toked again and began to grok Naismith in his fullness. The tape played on and Clem toked again each time he felt the need to grok more deeply. N aismith quoted Buckminster Fuller (the only Unistat President ev er to resign from office) and Ezra Pound, the folk singer, and John Adams and Tom Edison and a lot of other people who had long ago been on Clem's list of folks who had probably been given some of the \"stuff\" in the tomato juice. All of these men, Naismith pointed out, had proposed money systems more efficient and more just than the present Federal Reserve System. \"There is no one money system that was ordained by God,\" Na ismith said. \"They were all invented by human beings and can be improved by human beings. \"Now, what is money?\" Naismith asked. \"Money is information. Ask any computer programmer about that, if you don't believe it. Money is a signal, a unit of pure information. It is as abstract as mathematics. Cattle served as money once. So did leather. So did the precious metals. They were commodity monies , because they were worth something in themselves. Modern paper money is pure information, worth absolutely zilc h, except for the signals printed on it.\" Clem really began to get Naismith's perspective. He toked again, feelin g the Big Idea behind the First Bank of Religiosophy. \"Money in the modern world,\" Naismith went on, \"is no more than a promise to pay. If you look at the bills in your wallet right now, you'll see what they're promising to pay. They're promising to pay you more paper. They don't have to give you a gram of gold or silver or an y real commodity. They'll give you more paper if you want to trade in the paper you already have. Didn't that ever strike you as a little bit funny? \"Think of it this way,\" Naismith said, warming to his subject. \"T his is a corny old Sufi parable, but it might help you to get the picture.\" The great Sufi sage Nasrudin, Naismith said, once invented a magic wand. Wishing to patent such a valuable device, N asrudin waved the wand and created a patent office, which immediately appeared in 3-D Technicolor. N asrudin then walked in and told the cl erk, \"I want to patent a magic wand.\" \"You can't do that,\" said th e clerk. \"There is no such thing as a magic wand.\" N asrudin immediately waved his wand again, and the pate nt office and the cler k both disappeared. \"Jesus and Ludwig Christ!\" Clem Cotex cried. He jumped up and turned off the tapes, totally At One with the doctrine of Religiosophy. \"Money is inform ation,\" he muttered, beginning to pace the room, stoned out of his gourd. \"Holy snakes and ladders. 'Humanity is the symbol-using class of life, and thos e who control symbols control us.' I read that in Korzybski aeons ago. Information!\" Clem sat down at his desk and sp read out a large piece of paper. He drew an elab orate scroll around it an d printed at the top, \"COTEX RESERVE SYSTEM.\" He made it a cashier's check to the Treasury of Unistat for ten million dollars, to be repaid at the prime interest rate of 15 per cent. He then decorated another piece of paper, making it a Unistat National Bond, payable to the Cotex Reserve System for ten million dollars, th ereby giving CRS the credit to loan ten million to Unistat. He then switched the pieces of paper ar ound on the desk. Cotex Reserve seemed to be ten million dolla rs ahead, and yet Unistat owed them ten million plus 15 percent interest per year. (\"You can't do that. There is no such thing as a magic wand.\") Clem laughed hysterically. He remembered Simon Moon trying to explain Spencer Brown's Laws of Form to him: \"To cross 203 / 233"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"again is not to cross.\" Inflation, deflation, recession, depression: they were all like Nasrudin's patent office. Clem knew he was in the state where sync hronicities occur, so he went to his bookcase, picked a volume at random, and stuck his finger in, looking for the Message that would turn the whole experience into a full-scale Satori. He was in The Nature of th e Physical World by Sir Arthur Eddington, and the sentence he had found was: We have certain preconceived ideas abou t location in space which have come down to us from apelike ancestors. Clem Cotex laughed for nearly fifteen minutes. The next time he met Blake Williams, he unleashed his Illumination in an aphorism that he was convinced would, for once, startle the seem ingly unflappable anthropologist. \"Money is the Schrödinger's Cat of economics,\" Clem said, waiting for some sensational reaction. \"Oh,\" Williams said quietly, \"you've noticed that too?\" Dr. Horace Naismith had fo unded the First Bank of Religiosop hy in Bad Ass, Texas, because he wanted to be sure nobody in the Establishment would take it seriously. It was his plan to undermine the Federal Reserve System without their noticing what was happening. Everything in Bad Ass was considered too absurd and repugnant for serious co nsideration. Bad Ass Township and the whole of Bad Ass County were a s ource of national embarrassment. Bad Ass had been founded by descendants of the famous Juke s and Kallikak families, carriers of virulent idiocy genes, together with a few Snopeses who had been driven out of Mississippi for unnatural acts. The Bad Ass School Board banned not only Evolution and Sex Education, but non-Euclidean geometry, the metric system, cultural anthropology, and all history texts written outside Texas. Despite the President, the Supreme Court, Congress, the TV networks and Jack Anderson, the Bad Ass County Line still bore the traditional sign: DON'T LET THE SUN SET ON YOU IN BAD ASS, NIGGER. All roads leading to Bad Ass Township were littered with the decomposing bodies of murdered civil rights workers. Everybody in Unistat was profoundly ashamed of Bad Ass and wi shed it were part of some other country. They never realized that, to the rest of the world, Unistat looked like Bad Ass County. President Fuller, the man whose money ideas had inspired Dr. Naismith, was the only President in the history of Unistat to resign from office. He had resigned only three months after taking office, and he did it on the radio. \"I simply can't find any way to do anything socially useful here,\" he said with that innocent sincerity that had charmed the voters into electing him. \"I listened to some well-meaning friends and ran for this office,\" Fuller went on, \"and I now realize I was a perfect damned fool. The synergetic interlock or real time vectors in Univ erse cannot be augmented from here.\" The people-and, even more, the other polit icians-were outraged. They called Fuller a mugwump and wanted to punish him. Unfortunately, the only way to punish a politician is to refuse to vote for him, and Fuller was no longer a politician and refused to run for any office, so they had to be satisfied with just calling him a nut. That was in the 1930s, and everybody forgot about Fuller until the 1960s, when it turned out that his hobby- odd geometries-had a lot of practical applications. But still nobody took Fuller's money theories seriously, except Dr. Naismith, and Eve Hubbard, who had run for President in 1980 on the Libertarian Immortalist ticket (\"An End to Death and Taxes!\"). There was another President of Unistat who resigned, actually, but he \"only\" (as they say) existed in a novel. This was a science-fiction thriller set in a parallel universe and was called Wigner's Friend. It was about the worst possible President the author, a Harvard professor named Leary, could imagine. The President in Leary's book, called Noxi n, was a monster. He got the country into totally unnecessary wars without the consent, and sometimes even w ithout the knowledge, of Congress. He lied all the time, compulsively, even when it wasn't 204 / 233"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"necessary. He put wiretaps on everybody- even on himself. (Leary, a psychologist, claimed this bizarre fantasy, which smacked of satire, was possible, for a certain type of paranoid mind.) He used the FBI and the IRS to harass every citizen who resisted this tyranny. He not only took bribes, but even had a team of enforcers who ex torted \"campaign\" money from corporations under threat of turning the IRS on them. His politi cal enemies all died in a series of strange assassinations that couldn't be explained. When Congress started investigating his crimes, he betrayed his ow n co-conspirators one by one. N oxin even misappropriated government money to fix up his house, and cheated on his income tax. The book was a runaway best-sel ler, because it had a taut, suspenseful plot and because Unistaters could congratulate themselves on not being dumb enough to ever elect such a President. N aismith, despite his Texas accent, was no imbecile; he had his finger on part of what was really going on. The Federal Reserve did create money out of nothing. So did all the other banks. The laws of Unistat allowed this, by permitting banks to issue loans up to as much as eight times the amount they had in deposits. Every time a bank made a loan on money they didn't actually have, they were creating money. Most of the people who knew about this (aside from the bankers) went paranoid wo rrying about it. This was because they did not realize how much of their Reality was created in similarly occult ways. The Federal Reserve made it possible for other banks to loan what they didn't have. The Fed \"guaranteed\" the credit of the banks. The Fed was able to make this guarantee because it had lo ts of credit itself, in the form of government bonds. The government bonds were goo d because they were guarant eed by loans from the Fed. The loans from the Fed were guaranteed because the government gave them bonds. And this was safe, because the bonds (remember) were guaranteed by the Fed. That's why Clem Cotex laughed for half an hour when he finally figured out the Unistat economy. The Communists had instit uted this monetary policy because it made virtually all commerce dependent on money that didn't exist. The Communists had abandoned pure Marxism in 1904 and were now following a system based partly on Marx and partly on traditional shamanism. The whole Communist movement had secretly been taken over, in 1904, by General E. A. Crowley, the famous explorer. Crowley had learned a lot from the tribal shamans in the \"backward\" parts of the world he frequented. Chiefly, he had learned that the universe is created by the participation of its participants. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was hand-picked by General Crowle y to manage the Communist takeover of Unistat. Crowley picked Roosevelt chiefly because of his radio voice. The agreement was simple: Crowley would keep Roosevelt supplied with women-\"That crip Casanova never gets enough,\" he wa s soon complaining-and Roosevelt, in turn, introduced N asrudin's magic wand to political economy. Even though many clear-s ighted, patriotic citizens saw thro ugh Roosevelt and warned, repeat edly, that he was leading the country to communism, the majority paid no heed to these voi ces of reason. They were charme d by Roosevelt's radio voice, as Crowley had predicted. Actually, Roosevelt kept before him, every time he spoke on radi o, a large sign with a wise saying attributed to the man who won the Bad Ass Hog Calling Contest in 1923. The sign said: YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE APPEAL AS WELL AS POWE R IN YOUR VOICE. YOU MUST CONVINCE THE SWINE THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING FOR THEM. Unfortunately, Roosev elt was assassinated by a disgru ntled office seeker in 1937. 205 / 233"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The Communists found an equally loyal servant in 1948, how ever, in the famous General Douglas MacArthur, who was a military genius with one fatal flaw: he had an ego so large that only by contemplating the mathematical definition of infinity could anything so limitless be imagined. MacArthur completed the Communization of Unistat in return for having his picture put on pennies, nickels, dimes, dollars, postage stamps, paintings in every public place, G.I.-issue c ondoms, the ceilings of barber shops, Mount Rushmore, the Sistine Chapel fr escoes (advising God during the Creation), all government docu ments, the chief balloon in all Macy's parades, in place of the test pattern on TV screens, marriage licenses, dog license s, and in various other places that he thought of frorn time to time. A brave and patriotic senator, Joseph R. McCarthy, attemp ted to expose MacArthur's gov ernment, which was staffed entirely by card-carrying Communists. (The Communists carried cards because, with so many conspi racies going on at the time, it was the only way they could identify themselves to on e another.) The senator was smeared by the press, censured by his colleagues, and hounded to an early grave. \"Ike\" Eisenhower, a popular Western film star of the period, contributed to McCarthy's demise by making a national tour supporting the President. \"I don't know anything about politics or military strategy,\" old \"I ke\" would tell audiences, his face full of stupid sincerity. \"But I know General MacArthur is a smart man and a tough man and can outfox the Commies every time.\" Like almost everybody else, \"Ike\" thought the Co mmunists had taken over Russia, not Unistat. One of the most insidious things the CIA Communists did when they took over Unistat was to change the Constitution. The original Constitution, having been written by a group of intellectual libertines and Freemasons in the eighteenth century, included an amendment which declared: A self-regulated sex life being necessary to the happiness of a citizen, the righ t of the people to keep and enjoy pornography shall not be abridged. This amendment had been suggested by Thomas Jefferson, who had over nine hundred Black concubines, and Benjamin Franklin, a member of the Hell Fire Club , which had the largest collection of erotic books and art in th e Western world at that time. The Communists changed the amendment to read: A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged. All documents and textbooks were changed, so that nobody would be able to find out what the amendment had originally said. Then the Communists set up a front organization, the Nati onal Rifle Association, to enco urage the wide usage of guns of all sorts, and to battle any attempt to control guns as \"unconstitutional.\" Thus, they guaranteed that the murder rate in Unistat would always be the highest in the world. This kept the citizens in p erpetual anxiety about their safe ty both on the streets and in their homes. The citizens then tolerated the rapid growth of the Police State, which contro lled almost everything, except the sale of guns, the chief cause of crime. THE BACHS' BOX The Wilhelm Friedemann Bach Society was in the same down town Washington building as th e Warren Belch Society and the Invisible Hand Society, but Clem Cotex never thought much about them. He assumed, as did everybody else who noticed the name on the building directory, that the W. F. Bach Society was just a group of musicologists. N othing could have been further from the truth. 206 / 233"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"They were also trying to find out \"what the hell is really going on.\" This odd fraternity had named themselves after W. F. Bach not just for his music, which was superb, but for his effrontery, which was even more superb. Wilhelm Fr iede-mann Bach, one of the twenty children of Johann Sebastian Bach, did not have the easy and immediate success of hi s brothers, Johann Christia n Bach and Carl Philipp Eman-uel Bach. In fact, b ecause he was original and because he had to compete with the other three Bachs (alr eady well established in the esteem of music lovers), Wilhelm Friedemann was neglected for a long time and might have ended his days in poverty and obscurity. But W. F. Bach was not the sort of man to take defeat eas ily. He hit on a plan which ca used his music to be played everywhere, and made him quite a bundle of Deutschmarks, even though people were still saying he was the least important of the Bachs. Wilhelm Friedemann had simply sold his compositions, one by on e, as newly discovered work by his father, J. S. Bach. Of course there had been art fo rgers and music forgers and even novel forgers bo th before and after W. F. Bach, but he had raised the philosophical ante on the bothersome question \"I f a work of art cannot be distin guished from a masterpiece, is it not a masterpiece?\" or, in the vernacular, \"How important is a Potter Stewarting signature, anyway?\" The original members of the W. F. Bach Society were people who had owned some magnificent Van Goghs back in the 1960s. Then one traumatic day, they did not own any Van Goghs at all. They owned El Mirs. El Mir was the most talented painting forger of that time. His Van Goghs, Cezanne s, and Modiglianis were totally indistinguishable from \"the real thing,\" whatever that is. It was widely believed, after El Mi r was exposed by another forger named Irving, that many masterpieces still hanging in museums were El Mir's work . Indeed, El Mir insisted on that, regarding it as the cream of the jest. Some said that these El Mirs still hung in museums because the experts had not yet found any way to distinguish them from \"real\" art. Others said that the ex perts, once aware of El Mir's work, could distinguish it from Van Gogh's or Cezanne's or Modigliani's, but would not do so, because they had authenticated the fake s originally and did not want anybody to know that they had been fooled. Blake Williams, Ph.D., had purchased a very fine El Mir, under the impression it was a Van Gogh, after the great success of his popularized book on primate psychology, How to Tell Your Friends from the Apes. Williams was then in the midst of his first phase synthesizing General Semantics and Zen Buddhism, and he immediately recognized what was really going on when identifiable El Mirs were everywhere falling in value after the great Expose. It was a glitch, he decided. He called together a small group of people who also owned identi fied El Mirs and begged them not to believe that they had been deceived. \"A signature,\" he told them earnestly, \"is not an economic Good in itself, like gold or land or factories. It is only a squiggle given contextual meaning by social convention.\" He went on like that fo r nearly an hour. He spoke of the differences be tween the map and the territory; between the spoken word (\"a sonic wave in the atmosphere\") and the nonverbal thing or event which the word merely designates; between the menu and the meal. He quot ed Hume, Einstein, Korzybski, and Pope Stephen. He dragged in the latest theories in perception psychology, Ethnome-thodology, and McLuhan's version of media-message analysis. He reminded them that Carlos Castaned a had studied Ethnomethodology with Garfinkle before studying shamanism with Don Juan Matus, and he assured them, as a professional anthropologist, that anyone who has the power to define reality for you has become a sorcerer, if you do n't catch the bastard real quick. By this time a lot of his audience was irritated and a little fri ghtened-mutters of \"He's just a damned crank\" were heard from some corners of the room-but others were listening, enthralled. Williams resorted to psycho-drama and Role Playing to get hi s point across. He said that he would pretend to be an extraterrestrial-\"I wonder if it's just pretending,\" said an awed vo ice from the group who had fo llowed this l ecture with a sense of Illumination. Play-actin g the extraterrestrial, Williams defied them to explain several things to him, rationally and logically, without assuming he had \"intuitive\" or a priori knowledge about what they took for granted. He wanted to know, first, the difference between a dollar bi ll printed by the Unistat Treasur y and a dollar bill printed by a gang of counterfeiters. 207 / 233"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Everybody got excited, and most of them got angry, in the course of trying to make this distinction clear to the extraterrestrial, who was very literal and logical, and did not understand anything they took for granted until it was explained literally and logically. By the time the extraterrestrial was willing to grant that there was an agreed-upon difference between the two bills created by social consensus, a few people had left, saying, \"It's just an elaborate put-on.\" But the others, who stuck it out, were next confronted with a dollar bill hung in a museum as \"found\" art. Williams, the extraterrestrial, wanted to know whether its value was the same as, greater than, or less than it had been before being hung in the museum. More people lost their tempers in the course of his discussion. But Williams persisted. Still playing extraterrestrial, he wanted to know if it made any difference if the dollar hung in the museum as \"found\" art had been printed by the Treasury or by the criminal gang. After a few minutes of this topic most of the people in the room were jumping up and down like the Ambassador who found the Rehnquist on the stairs. Williams had no mercy. He next wanted them to explai n the difference between any or all of the above and an exact duplicate of any or all of them painted by Roy Lichtenstein and exhibited as Pop Art. After a half hour more he pointed out that they were arguin g among themselves ev en more than they were attempting to explain these mysteries to him. He also mentioned, not too cr uelly, that many of them had ar rived at the state where they seemed to believe their definitions would become more convincing if they just re peated them at a louder decibel level. Williams then gave up the extraterrestrial game and tried to restore order. He b ecame droll and told th em the old story of how Picasso, asked to identify the real Picas-sos in a group of possible fakes, had put one of his own canvases among the fraudulent group. \"But,\" an art dealer among those pres ent protested, \"I saw you paint that one myself, Pablo.\" \"No matter,\" said the Great Man imperturbably, \"I can fake a Picasso as well as anybody.\" He reminded them that Andy Warhol kept a closet full of Campbell's soup cans, and gave autographed cans to people he liked so they could own \"a genuine Warhol.\" He pointed out, after the laugh subsided, that neither extraterrestrials nor terrestrials could agree on the differen ce in value between a Treasury dollar si gned by Warhol and th ereby becoming \"a genuine Warhol,\" a counterfeit dollar signed by Warhol for the purpose-giving \"a genuine Warho l\" to a friend, a Treasury dollar with Warhol's signature forged by El Mir, a Treasury do llar with Warhol's signature forged by an unknown criminal, and a counterfeit dollar with Warhol's si gnature forged by William S. Burroughs, the founder of Neo-Cubist painting. He said that Ethnomethodologists knew that the border between the Real and the Unr eal was not fixed, but just marked the last place where rival gangs of shamans had fought each other to a stalem ate. He said the border had shifted after each major conceptual struggle, as national border s shift after military struggles. He de fined everybody who attempted to define Reality, including himself, as a conscious or unconscious co-conspirator with some gang of shamans who are trying to impose their game on the rest of us. He said that both the economics of ar t and the art of economics were determ ined by shamans, whether they knew themselves as shamans or not. \"Crazy as a bedbug,\" said the last man to quit the room. The remainder were staring at Williams with devout awe. Th ey felt that he had removed great murky shadows from their minds and brought them forward into the light. Williams had made some Converts. He settled back in an easy chair-he had been standing in his Full Professor lecture-room style through most of this-and got chatty and informal. He told them the little-known story of Pope Stephen's parable to the Spanish Cardinal who had told him that \"seeking for the Real\" was po intless since the Real is palpably right in front of our noses. \"Everybody knows,\" Pope Stephen had said, \"that I studied singing and medicine before I decided to make the priesthood my life's work. What few know is that I also considered becoming a novelist. I often wonder, myself, if I ever abandoned 208 / 233"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"that last ambition. Sometimes I f eel like a novelist pretending to be a Pope, to see what it's like. And sometimes I even think the whole Church is a very old novel which I've revised and modernized. And, my reverend brother in Christ, sometimes I even think that I'm not alone in this novel-writing business; I think that every man, woman, and child on this planet is writing a novel inside their heads, all day long, every day-editing, rewriting, touching things up, improving a page here and throwing a page out somewhere else. The onl y difference is that when I write a no vel, it becomes an Encyclical, and is therefore Reality for mi llions of believers.\" Williams now had five True Believers out of the thirty pers ons he had called together. The five, together with Williams, founded the W. F. Bach Society that night, and set out to impose their definition of Art on the rest of the world. They began by finding and financing Orson Welles, an obese genius who might have been the world's greatest film director if he had only been allowed to direct films. Welles was not allowed to direct films becau se he had made the mistake, his first ti me out, of making a movie about Charles Foster Hearst, the richest and most pow erful of the Communist clique who ruled Unistat. Welles changed the name, of course, and called his movie character Will iam Randolph Kane, but few were deceived by this, and Hearst certainly wasn't. The movie had a scene, at the beginning, in which a co nservative banker said bluntly that \"Kane\" (Hearst) was a Communist. It went on to make a big mystery about the word \"Rosebud,\" which referred to General Crowley's system of \"Rosy Cross\" Cabalistic magick which the Communists were using to make money out of nothing. It exposed, almost blatantly, how Unistat was actually governed. Welles was blacklisted, and spent the rest of his life wandering around the world playing bit parts in films by other directors . The W. F. Bach Society financed Welles in the making of his second film, Art Is What You Can Get Away With, which was a bold glorification of El Mir. N ext, the W. F. Bach cabal fi nanced a new literary journal, Passaic Review, which they advertised so widely that everybody with any pretense to being an intellectual had to read it. The Passaic Review heaped scorn and invective on the established literar y idols of the time-Simon Moon, the neo-surrealist novelist; Gerald Ford, the \"country-and-western\" poet; Norman Mailer; Robert Heinlein; Tim Hildebrand; and so on. They also denounced all the alleged \"greats\" of the first part of the century, like H. P. Lovecraft, Henry James, T. S. Eliot, and Robert Putney Drake. They established their own pantheon of \"great\" writers, which included William Butler Yeats (an obscure Irish schoolteacher nobo dy had ever heard of), Olaf Stapledon, Arthur Flegenhe imer, and Jonathan Latimer. After only two years of bombardment by the erudite and authoritative-sounding articles in Passaic Review, most self- declared intellectuals were seriously comparing Yeats with Eliot and granting that some of Stapledon's novels were as good as anything by James or Drake. All of this was an experiment, actually. Blake Williams had not believed everything he told the founders of the W. F. Bach Society. He was convinced that a great deal of what passes for Value was created, not by labor as the Marxists thought, nor by supply-and-demand as the Free Market economists claimed, but by what he as an anthropologist recognized as shamanism. He was trying to find out how much Value, and hence how much Reality, was so created. He believed that large hunks of experience could be altered by people who regarded themselves as shamans and considered anyone who opposed them to be rival shamans trying to sell an alternative Reality. It was his plan to move the Bach group, slowly, from experimenting upon the economics of art to experimenting upon the art of economics. He knew that Value was the Schrödinger's Cat in every equation.

Crow ley, the best-known explorer and adventurer of the early decades of our century. Th e model of the English noblem an. The idol of yo ung boys everywhere. General Crowley, indeed.\" He paus ed dramatically. \"Look at those eyes.\" Clem's voice suddenly had the tone of Perry Maso n addressing the court. \"How would you describe those dark and brooding orbs, my friends?\" \"Well,\" Dr. Williams said, \"he has what I believe is called urn a piercing gaze.\" \"Exactly,\" Cotex said. \"A piercing gaze.\" Another picture of General Crowley came on the screen. And another. And another. \"The same piercing gaze,\" Clem said po intedly, \"year after year. No matter wher e he is when a photographer pops up- Africa, Mexico, the North Pole; it doesn' t matter-always the same piercing gaze.\" \"Well ah aren't heroes supposed to have a piercing gaze?\" Old Pr ime Time protested, wondering if this was just another of Clem's wild-goose chases. \"In a certain class of sensationa l fiction,\" Clem said tightly, \"heroes have a piercing gaze. Sometime s the villains do too-Fu Manchu for instance. But we are not living in that kind of novel,\" he went on, not bothering to tell them his opinion of what kind of novel they were living in. \"In our reality, a piercing gaze means only one thing, and you a ll know what it is, gentlemen.\" Another picture of General Crowley came on the screen, one in which he was much older than in the previous four photos; but he still had the same dark and deep-yes, piercing-gaze. \"These are the eyes,\" Clem said, \"of a hopeless slave of the hashish habit. Now, as you all know, many English military men acquired a taste for the resin of the Cannabis Indica plant while in India, and were none the worse for it. Certainly, an occasional smoke of the hash is an enjoya ble, even a mind-expanding, experience. I daresay most of you here have tried it, and I gladly admit that I have. But a sensible man keeps such diversions within certain bounds. Such a sane, sound man does not 'do a number ' (as our younger people call it) until evening, or at least until twilight. Well, maybe late afternoon, occasionally. Perhaps in the morning once in a while. But not one stick of hash after another, day after day, year after year, for twenty, thirty, forty years! No: one who fits that description is a slave of the habit, a hashish robot, a man whose mind has lost contact with Reality (whatever that is) and wanders am id the phantasms of his own po isoned brain. A man, as the Irish say, whose mind had been taken away by the Wee People.\" All gazed up at the photo of General Crowley, \"the last of th e Kipling heroes,\" as a journalist had called him, and Crowley gazed back at them, stony- eyed, impassive, enigmatic. 210 / 233"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"\"Now, I have been studying all of General Crowley's wanderings,\" Clem went on. \"He was, in fact, back in England during N ovember of 1881. The crab and periwinkle prank would have been easy for a man of his w ealth, if his mind had already acquired that strange quirk, that twist in the sensibility, which cannabis abusers refe r to in their own argot as 'a spaced-out sense of humor.' \"In 1893, what do we find?\" Clem continued. \"General Crowley wa s visiting the Jersey shore, ri ght here in Unistat, 'fishing and relaxing,' he says in his autobiography. And that very summe r we see the first record of 'the Jersey Devil,' that fabulous monster that looked like a gorilla, jumped like a kangaroo, and glowed in the dark. \"I think we can discoun t later appearances of the Jersey Devil,\" Clem said argumentatively, \"as the work of lesser p ranksters, inspired by General Crowley's initial success. \"In 1 904,\" Clem went on, \"there was the famous werewolf scare in N orthumberland. General Crowley was back in England that year. In 1905 we have the first major UFO flap in Spain. General Crowley was vacationing there. In 1908 gnomes and othe r Little Green Men were reported in Switzerland. General Crowley was there, allegedly only to climb mountains. \"And so it goes,\" Clem said bluntly, flicking the lights back on. \"Over fifty-six percent of all the weird data collected by th e conservative Forteans, by our own more imaginative group, a nd by all the UFO buffs, for the years of 1860 to 1930-the years of General Crowley's life- correlate with the General's own movements. Even the Loch Ness Monster first began to appear after he bought Boleskine House, on the shore on Loch Ness. \"I think, gentlemen, that the conclusion is inescapable. Gene ral Edward A. Crowley, the mo untaineer, the adventurer, the explorer, was a man unhinged by hashish abuse. He had become a compulsive, obsessive, sometimes sadistic practical joker. After all, I think the psychology of it is easy to understand, es pecially to those of us who, while not enslaved by the habit a s he was, have had our own little adventures with the cannabi s molecule. The world was becomi ng increasingly materialistic, bureaucratic, and-to a man like Crowley- dull. He set out to restore the Mysterious, th e Magical, even the Fr ightening, to us. He was the last Romantic. \"I have no doubt of it,\" Clem concluded. \"Gener al Crowley was the Mad Fishmonger of Worcester.\" \"By George,\" Blake Williams said, \"I think you've really got it.\" There were murmurs of agreemen t. But then Professor Fred \"Fidgets\" Digits spoke up suddenly: \"This opens a whole new can of worms,\" he said. \"If General Crowley was-well, what he now appears to be, a common hoaxter- well, gentlemen, can we trust his reports on the North Pole expedition?\" \"I fear not,\" Clem Cotex said. \"That question came to me as so on as I began to realize Crowley's true character. We can't believe the North Pole story at all. It may just be another of his jokes. We may have been wrong for years, gentlemen. \"The earth may not be hollow, after all.\" Down the hall the Invisible Hand Society was having problems of its own. A group of the more avant-gard e members had become convinced of the existe nce of the Tooth Fairy and were trying to convert everybody else. N aturally, Dr. Rauss Elysium did not like this. He felt it redu ced the principles of the Invi sible Hand Society to absurdity. Dr. Rauss Elysium had summed up the entire scie nce of economics in four propositions, to wit: 1. Find out who profits from it. This was merely a restatement of the old Latin proverb-a favorite of Lenin's- cui bono? 2. Groups never meet together except to conspire against other groups. This was a generalization of Adam Smith's more limited prop osition \"Men of the same profession never meet together except to defraud the general public.\" Dr. Rauss Elysium had reali zed that it applies not just to merchants, but to groups of all sorts, including the governmental sector. 4. Every system evolves and expands unt il it encroaches upon other systems. 211 / 233"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"This was just a simplification of most of the di scoveries of ecology and General Systems Theory. 4. It all returns to eq uilibrium, eventually. This was based on a broad Evolutionary Perspective and was the basic faith of the Invisible Hand mystique. Dr. Rauss Elysium had merely recognized that the Invisible Hand, fi rst noted by Adam Smith, operat es everywhere. The Invisible Hand, Dr. Rauss Elysium claimed, does not merely function in a free market, as Smith had thought, but continues to control everything no matter how many conspiracies, in or out of government, attempt to frustrate it. Indeed, by including Propositions 2 and 3 inside the perspective of this Proposition 4, it was obvious-at least to him-that conspiracy, government interference, monopoly, and all other attempts to frustrate the Invisible Hand were th emselves part of th e intricate, complex working of the Invisible Hand itself. He was an economic Taoist. The Invisible Hand-ers were bitterly hated by the orthodox old Libertarians. The old Libertarians claimed that the Invisible Hand-ers had carried Adam Smith to the point of self-contradiction. The Invisible Hand people, of course, denied that. \"We're not telling you not to oppose the government,\" Dr. Rauss Elysium always told them. \"That's your genetic and evolutionary function; just as it's the government's function to oppose you.\" \"But,\" the Libertarians would protest, \"if you don't join us, the government will evolve and expand indefinitely.\" \"Not so,\" Dr. Rauss Elysium would say, with supreme Faith. \"It will only evolve and expand until it creates sufficient opposition. Your coalition is that sufficient opposition at this time and place. If it were not sufficient, there would be more of you.\" Some Invisible Hand-ers, of course, eventually quit and returned to orthodox Libertarianism. They said that, no matter how hard they looked, they couldn't see the Invisible Hand. \"You're not looking hard enough,\" Dr. Rauss Elysium told them. \"You've got to notice every little detail.\" Sometimes, he would point out, ironically, that many had aban doned Libertarianism to become socialists or other kinds of Statists because they couldn't see the Invisible Hand even in the Free Market of th e nineteenth century. All they could see, he said, were the conspiracies of the big cap italists to prevent free competition and to maintain their monopolies. They, the fools, had believed government intervention would stop this. Government intervention was, to Dr. Rauss Elysium, just like the conspiracies of the corporat ions, merely another aspect of the Invisible Hand. \"It all coheres wonderfully,\" he never tired of repeating. \"Just notice all the details.\" Alas, the Tooth Fairy people were using all the same arguments . They said that if you couldn't see the Tooth Fairy, you weren't looking hard enough. HONG KONG DONG The fame of Indole Ringh's marvelous temple with the legendary Shivalingam soon spread throughout India, and pilgrims came from hundreds of miles away to look and wonder. The new cult did not last long, however, because some misc reant crept into the temple one dark night and stole the Shivalingam. 212 / 233"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The multitudes were horrified, and even wrathful, when the theft was discovered the following morning, but old Indole Ringh, smiling and spaced out, made a little speech that calmed them all. \"Miracles, like all other things,\" he said, \"come out of the Void for no reason and return to th e Void for no reason. Wait. Be patient. Pay attention to the little details. And see what comes out of the Void next.\" Actually, the Shivalingam was not exactly returned to the Void, but had merely been transported to Hong Kong. The King Kong Dong had been brought to Hong Kong by the unsavory person named Chi Ken Teriyaki, who was wanted by the authorities in Japan for selling \"American\" cigarettes made in Taiwan, diluted shark-repellent, stocks and bonds in a tapioca mine in Nutley, New Jersey, cocaine cut with Clorox, forged co pies of the now high-priced El Mir forgeries of Van Gogh, and similarly dubious merchandise. Chi Ken, a half-Chi nese, half-Japanese hoodlum, ha d originally worked for the infamous Fu Manchu and was later part of the notorious Casper Gutman mob in Istanbul. Fallen on lean days, he now eked out a bare living as a police informer in Hong Kong and part-time actor in underground Okinawan porn movies. Chi Ken purloined the ithyphallic eidolon from Indole Ringh's temp le of Shiva because he knew of a fabulously rich man in Hong Kong who happened to be looking for just such an item. Hong Kong at that time, like most of the Orient, was haunted by the specter of the \"boat peopl e,\" refugees from Unistat who had crossed the Pacific in hopes of a better life. There was no nation in the East willing to accept more than a handful of these pitiful people, and most of them just drifted from harbor to harb or, slowly starving, and hoping for acceptance somewhere. These desperate people were fleeing the appalling conditions that prevailed in Unistat since Furbish Lousewart became President in 1980. The man Chi Ken Teriyaki was going to see was named Wing L ee Chee, and he was a deep, de nse, secretive person, even more inscrutable than the average Chinese businessman. Wing Lee Chee had been an athlete in hi s youth and had even toured Unistat once, performing amazing karate feats in a carnival. His missing right eye (the black patch made him even more inscrutable) was said to be due to an unfortunate incident that had occurred when the carniva l was in Bad Ass, Texas, and he tried to use the white washroom at a gas station. Mr. Wing had returned to China, and thence to Hong Kong, and had grown fat and rich by prosecuting what he considered a j udicious and appropriate campaign of revenge against Unistat. He mass-manufactured fake T'ang dynasty art, to swindle the Unistat millionaires. He was the highest-paid informant fo r the CIA's Far East office, and, due to his knowledge of Unistat, always turned in information that confirmed the paranoid fantasies of his employers but had no connection with what was actually going on anywhere. Through a series of fronts , he had taken over organized crime in Unistat and arranged that everybody would blame it on the Sicilians. He was currently engaged in smuggling as many as one thousan d of the \"boat people\" a month into Hong Kong, where he put them to work in his factories and paid them three cents a day. Wing Lee Chee, at eighty-seven, was a ph ilosopher and a man of balance. His life -style always tempered severity with mercy, larceny with generosity, sensuality with meditation. He always tried to be as just a man as was compatible with being a rich and comfortable man. If one of the employees in hi s factories showed initiative or talent, Wi ng Lee Chee noticed, and that man or woman was quickly promoted to a position of responsibility and solvency. He was no xenophobe; this policy applied even to Japanese, Hindus, and the wretched Unistat refugees . Mr. Wing lived on Peach Blossom Street and had a magnificent view of all of Hong Kong and the harbor. He felt that the view was making him more philosophical every y ear. Each evening, after his twilight meditation period, he would sit at his window, smoking a long black Italian cigar, and look down at the teeming human hive below him, thinking that every person down th ere was the center of a whole universe, just like himself. He had learned total detachment from all his own emotions in one split second, the day the white cops in Bad Ass knocked his eye out while arresting him. He had known, in that second, that he could kill them all-no man in the world knew more of aikido, judo, kung fu, and karate than Wing Lee Chee in his youth-but he knew what would happen after that if he did it. He looked at his own rage, understood suddenly in a mini-Satori that this was a mechanical-chemical process in his body, and became the clear mind that watched the rage instead of the emotional mind that experienced it. All of the more mystical and obscure things his martial arts teachers had tried to teach him abruptly made se nse. He was never the same man again. So he would sit, in the early evenings, smoking his foul It alian cigars (a taste acquired from a business associate named 213 / 233"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Celine) and look down at Hong Kong and its myriad of robots, each driven by mechanical and chemical reflexes, each believing itself the center of the universe. And then he would laugh softly at his own sense of superiority, because he knew that he was also controlled by chemical chains that determined what he could and could not think. Only in very deep meditation, and only a few times, had he broken those chains and seen-briefly! how briefly!-what the hell was really going on, outside of his own mental card-index system. But Wing Lee Chee always came out of those high moments giggling foolishly, like a mental defective, or weeping quietly at the stupidity of himself and the rest of humanity, or simply dazed, like a man who opens the door to his own bedroom and finds himself lost in one of the craters of the moon. On September 23, 1986, Wing Lee Chee had two important visitors in his office. The first was the robot who used the name Frank Sullivan. Wi ng Lee Chee gave him a neatly typed report full of nonsense and mythology about Far Eastern affairs, which Su llivan would dutifully turn in to Nathaniel Drest at CIA headquarters in Alexandria; Drest would worry even more that the Discordians were taking over the world. Sullivan gave Wing Lee Chee a cashier's check for twenty thousa nd dollars, from U.S. Silicon and Sherbet, which was the CIA front for payments made to the Far East sector. Sullivan also gave Wing a check for on e hundred thousand dollars, from Universal Synergetics Inc., which was the front for the heroin industry's payments to the Far East. Mr. Wing gave Sullivan a small ticket, which would pass him into a warehouse where the bricks of pure opium would be turned over to him, to be transported via the Corsican Mafia to France, where it would be refine d into heroin, shipped to New York, and seized by a cop named Popeye Doyle. The last part of the pr ocess, the intrusive Doyle, wa s not part of the plan, but happened, anyway, to one shipment in two hundred, and was part of the overhead. Mr. Wing liked pseudo-Sullivan, even though he knew the robot was not human. It was comforting to talk to an organism that possessed no emotions and sa w everything clearly, down to every last tiny little detail. That ability to observe object ively was what made the robot such a superior Intelligence Agent, Wing Lee Chee surmised. The robot had, in fact, once been a human being. Then he joined the U.S. Marine Corps, where they sent him to Boot Camp and brainwashed him. The marines, of course, did not know that wh at they did was brainwashing. They called it \"turning a civilian into a marine.\" It consisted of breaking down every imprint and reflex in the br ain, through stress, shock, and constant humiliation, and then imposing a new set of imprints and reflexes. All military organi zations did it, and none of them knew it was brainwashing. The semirobotized, semihuman product of Boot Camp was th en among the lucky twenty-or the unlucky twenty- to be chosen for special traini ng by Naval Intelligence. He was then brainwashed a second time. The technicians who worked on him this time were more sophisticated than the Drill Instructors in Boot Camp, but they still didn't like to call their work brainwashing. \"Bra inwashing,\" they all felt, was what the enemy did. What they did was \"turn a dumb marine into a trained Intelligence Agent.\" They used stress, shock, indoctrinatio n, hypnosis, LSD, and conditioning. The resulting humanoid subsequently defected to Russia an d was brainwashed a third time by the KGB. What came up, of course, was a Strange Loop: under ordinary hypnosis, he appear ed to be what he claimed to be, a sincere convert to the Russian way of life; under mind-drugs and deeper hypnosis, he was a Naval Intelligence agent, as the KGB suspected all along. They proceeded to brainwash him a fourth and fifth time, an d he returned to Unistat to be debriefed and to serve as a sleeper agent for the KGB. N aval Intelligence then reprogrammed hi m again, digging out the third level th at the KGB couldn't reach. This level operated like a Trapdoor Code in a co mputer, and was inaccessible to anyone, in cluding the programm ed agent himself, except for those who knew the triggering word, which happened to be \"Fishm onger,\" because the Naval Intelligence psychologist who had devised this system was a Charles Fort fan. N aval Intelligence now had a man, or what had once been a man, who was accepted to tally by the KGB as one of their very own, and who even defined himself that way to himself, but who was, at the word \"Fishmonger,\" an Objective Observer for N aval Intelligence. He was exactly the twenty-t hird to have gone through this Strange Loop. 214 / 233"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"At this point the time-dwarfs from Zeta Reticuli got him w ith a classic Close Encounter of the Third Kind. All he ever remembered, and all he could tell either th e KGB or Naval Intelligence, was that a flashing light had come out of the sky, he had been paralyzed, and then it was three days later and he was in another city. Everybody assumed that this was some brain spasm caused by the amount of imprinting and reimprinting he had gone through. But the Reticulans counted him as number 137 of their agents on Earth. All his ID identified him as Frank Sullivan , of Dublin, Ireland, and even when he went through the brainwashing, or \"basic training,\" as it was called, in the Provisional Irish Republican Army, that cover stood up. N either he nor anyone else remembered, by 1987 , that he had been bo rn Lee Harvey Oswald. Wing Lee Chee's second visitor th at day was the unsavory Chi Ken Teriyaki, and their business was of a sort that most of the world would have regarded as extremely grisly and perverse. But when Teriyaki left, two thousand dollars richer, Wing Lee Chee was an extremely happy man. He canceled all his appointments for the day, summoned his chauffeur, and sped like a bullet to the home of Ying Kaw Foy, the youngest, the loveliest, and the most beloved of his three mistresses. \"My youth has been restored,\" he told the startled young lady. \"I feel like a mere lad of forty-eight again! A whole new life is opening for us.\" There was no mistaking the glint in the old man's eye. \"The ginseng worked?\" Ms. Ying asked, delighted. \"Well, not quite,\" old Wing said carefully. \"But this is almost as good. We can near ly Potter Stewart again.\" \"My little old darling,\" Ms. Ying said. \"I have told you that it gives me great pleasure to Briggs you, no matter how long it takes. And you Briggs me most deliciously and perfectly. And we are happy so, are we not? An d what do you mean by these strange words? How on earth does one nearly Potter Stewart?\" Wing opened his pack age and showed her. \"Good grief!\" Ms. Ying cried. \"You've had your agents mutilate Mick Jagger!\" But then her ey es misted over. \"You'd do anything to please me, wouldn't you? You little old darling.\" THE SYMPOSIUM When Simon Moon joined the Warren Belch So ciety, the effect was not additive, bu t synergetic. Simon the Walking Glitch added to minds like those of Clem Cotex an d Blake Williams could only result in wh at a nineteenth-century philosopher had foreseen as \"the transvaluation of all va lues.\" A new cosmology, a new theology, a new eschatology, and even a new theory about the metaphysics of Krazy Kat emerged. Unfortunately, they all got so stoned that they co uld never remember afterward exactly wh at they had decided. It was like the legendary Cthulhucon of 1978 or 1979, which was su pposed to have taken place in Arkham, Massachusetts. Every science-fiction fan in th e country was alleged to have been there, and if they denied it, they were told that \"the hash was so good almost everybody forgot everything that happened.\" Nobody ever knew, for sure, if Cthulhucon had itself happened, or if it was just a hoax, a legend cr eated by a minority to perplex and annoy the majority. Fortunately, or unfortun ately, the Belchers all got together a week late r to try to reconstruct their great discoveries. \"I think,\" Simon Moon ventured, \"that we all sort of agreed th at Tristan Tzara, writing poems by picking words out of a hat, created the whole modern esthetic, while Claude Shannon, generating Information Theory by picking words out of a hat, generated the correct appro ach to quantum mechanics.\" 215 / 233"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"\"Jesus,\" Blake Williams pr otested, \"did I agree to that? What the hell were we smoking, anyway?\" \"Wait a minute,\" Cotex said. \"Simon has something, dammit! Didn't we discover that there is a second flaw of thermodynamics as well as a second law?\" \"I think,\" Percy \"Prime\" Time sa id, \"that we were discussing Deep Mongolian Steinem Job and that got us into the subject of unusual combinations and permutations.\" \"Yes, yes, by God!\" Williams exclaimed. \"We realized that genius consists of looking for unusual combinations. Alekhine checkmates with a pawn, while his opponent is worrying abou t his queen. Beethoven proceeds from the third movement to the fourth without the usual break. ...\" \"And Shakespeare makes a powerful iambic pentameter line, one of hi s most tragic, out of the same word repeated five times,\" Simon interjected. \"And Picasso constructs a bull's head, and a mighty sinister on e,\" Father Starhawk said, \"from the handlebars and seat of a bicycle.\" \"And so,\" Simon Moon cried triumphantly, \"the unusual comb ination is the key to creativ e genius, and Tzara did find a mechanical analog to it in pick ing words from a hat at random. And Shannon fo rmulated it mathematical ly when he realized that information is nothing but unexpect ed combinations-negative en tropy in thermodynamics!\" \"Jesus, run that by me again,\" Prime Time said faintly. But Blake Williams had th e ideational ball and was running with it. \"So Dada Art and cybernetics are both ways of playing games with thermodyna mics, with the laws of probability,\" he said. \"By God, I'm becoming a mystic. The only way the univ erse or universes can survive is by continuous acts of creativity-unusual combinations-on some level or another. Schrödinger was right all along: life feeds on negative entropy. The mind feeds on negative entropy. The best favor you can do for anybody is to shock them, and no wonder the Zen Masters hit you with a stick when you least expect it; by God, any shoc k that's severe enough is a new imprint. ...\" \"Imprint?\" Professor Fred \"Fidgets\" Digits asked wanly. \"A hard-wired circuit in the nervous system,\" Williams said. \"Imprints are created by shock. The birth process itself is the first shock and makes the first imprint. Haven't you ever read ethology?\" \"You mean like a gosling imprints its mother, and if the moth er isn't right there it imprints some other white, round object like a Ping-Pong ball?\" Digits said. \"Y eah, I read that in Konrad Lorenz . Didn't he win the Nobel for it?\" \"Well,\" Williams said, \"I've b een wondering for y ears about the Hollandaise Sauce myst ery-the people who were poisoned by contaminated Hollandaise once and then ha d a toxic reaction whenever th ey tried to eat Hollandais e. That's an imprint, I decided. Being poisoned is uh you must admit a shock.\" \"Oh, wow,\" Simon Moon said. \"That's like Dashiell Hammett's st ory about the guy who almost got killed by a falling girder. All his imprints got extinguished. He just wandered off, forgetting is wife, his family, his job, and everything, looking for another Reality he could hook on to.\" \"Yes, yes,\" Williams said. \"You're getting it. It happens to shipwrecked sailors and other people in isolation for long periods too. The imprints fade and what ever comes along makes a new imprint. It happ ens in Free Fall; that's why all the astronauts come back mutated. And it happens at the first Millett too.\" \"Far Potter Stewarting out,\" Simon said. \"Y ou mean, I dig red-haired women because my first Millett was with a red-haired girl in high school?\" \"You've got it,\" Williams said. \"If it had been a young um lady of co lor, you'd be one of those cats who only like to swing with Black chicks.\" \"If it had been with a boy,\" Simon said, \"I'd be Gay!\" \"That's it, that's it!\" Clem Cotex cried. \"If the Finkelst ein multiworlds model in quantum mechanics is true, there are 216 / 233"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"universes in which you did not take those imprints.\" \"Yeah,\" Simon said. \"I can see myself hang ing around Gay bars in one universe, chas ing Black foxy ladies in another. . . . My God, it's probably true on the semantic circuits too. Th ere might be a universe where I imprinted mathematics instead of words. I might be a physicist or a computer sp ecialist over there instead of a novelist. ...\" \"And,\" Father Starhawk said solemnly, \"there might be a uni verse where, with a different set of emotional and semantic imprints, I might be a professional crim inal, a jewel thief, or something.\" There was a pause while everybody cons idered what they had been saying. \"This is all rather speculative,\" Fred Digits said finally. \"We're being carried away by our own rhetoric, I suspect.\" \"Urn another thing,\" Father Starhawk said . \"People seem to be changi ng rather abruptly and in strange, unexpected ways lately. Those negative entropy connections and unusual combinations, you know? I mean, people who've been Straight all their lives and suddenly they're Gay or Bi or something. An d conservatives suddenly becomi ng liberals, as if all the semantic imprints are fading everywhere. Stable people schizzing out. Emotional neurotics suddenly becoming mature. It can't all be the shocks of accel erating social change, can it?\" Blake Williams beamed. \"That's the question I've been asking my self for months,\" he said, \"and I think I have the answer. Gentlemen, all the so-called recreational dr ugs that have come into wide use in th e last few decades may be chemical shock devices. I think people are bleaching out th eir old imprints, and accidentally making ne w ones, when they think they're just getting high and having fun.\" \"Wait a minute,\" Simon said. \"Isn't there a guy in prison in California fo r the last twenty-seven year s or so for saying that? Some psychiatrist named Sid Cohen or something?\" \"Never heard of him,\" said Prime Time. \"Besides, we don 't put people in jail in this country for their ideas.\" \"Well, anyway,\" Simon said, \"even if al l these new imprints made with dope are more or le ss accidental and the people doing it don't know what they're doing actually, it sure has s tirred up a lot of the creative en ergy we were talking about. New combinations-bizarre, unthinkable, taboo combinations-are form ing in brains all over the wo rld every few minutes. Maybe that's why the Libertarian Immo rtalist Party could come out of nowhere and wi n the election by a land slide. 'No more death and taxes.'

There was a knock on the door. \"Come,\" said Clem. He had picked that up from his hero, Captai n (now Admiral) James T.

He stared at the door for one frozen moment, still breathing deeply, relaxing every muscle; and then the door opened, and the two men came in. I could jump out of the window, Dashwood thought. But then he controlled himself. He recognized Tobias Knight at once, bu t the man from the D.A.'s office-who look ed like a young Lincoln, or Henry Fonda playing young Lincoln-was a stranger. \"Dr. Dashwood,\" Knight said cordially, \"this is Cotton DeAct, from the District Attorney's office.\" \"Named after Cotton Mather?\" Dashwood asked inanely. \"Named after Cotton Hawes, the detective,\" DeAct said, lookin g embarrassed. \"My mother wa s a great mystery-story fan.\" \"Oh,\" Dashwood said. There didn't seem to be any other appropriate comment. There was a pause, and Dashwood noticed that Tobias Knight looked a bit embarrassed also. \"Well, gentlemen,\" he said heartily, \"what can I do for you?\" \"Hrrrmph!\" DeAct cleared his throat. \"Dr. Dashwood,\" he said formally, \"there are two detectives from the Vice Squad waiting outside. They have a warrant for your arrest um for viol ating Section 666 of the revised criminal code ah Bestiality.\" He was actually blushing. \"I see,\" Dashwood said. He real ized that his breath had become shallow and his muscles were tensing; with an effort, he relaxed. \"I've known this day might come,\" he said with icy calm. \"Why don't they just come in and arrest me, then?\" DeAct took a chair; Knight remained standing-between Dashwood and the window, although not being conspicuous about how he got himself there. 218 / 233"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"\"Well, ah,\" DeAct said, lighting a cigarette nervously. \"You ar e ah um an International Celebrity in a sense um people say Freud Kinsey Masters Johnson and Dashwood almost in one br eath you might say. Ah there are questions of Scientific Freedom at stake here. Ah there is the matter of our national image ah we don 't want you to be called the American Sakharov or anything like that ha-ha right?\" \"Do you mean,\" Dashwood cried, \"you might offer me a deal?\" \"Well, I can't speak with any authority on that,\" DeAct said qu ickly. \"What we have in mind is having you ah fill us in on the background details.\" \"You mean you want me to inform on my colleagues,\" Dashwood said, not quite making a question of it. \"No, no nothing like that,\" DeAct said. \"I t's hardly necessary, anyway. We know who they are and where they are, all sixty- seven of them.\" He noted Dashwo od's reaction. \"Yes,\" he went on, \"there is very little we don't know about Project Pan, as you called it.\" \"Oh, Burger,\" Knight said suddenly. \"Let's stop fiddle-Stewart ing around. We've been on this investigation fo r over a year, Dashwood. We know that you and your friend Blake Williams some how or other induced sixty-seven top scientific brains to get embroiled with you in this, this, this ...\" He blanched, and then went on brutally, \"We know you've been Lourding animals, dammit! Lourding donkeys and Lourding goats and Lourding God-knows-what-else -whatever your Rehnquists would fit into, evidently. Jesus Christ,\" he added, \"I never heard of such a thing.\" \"That's enough, Tobias,\" DeAct said sharply. \"You see our problem, Dr. Dashwood. Even in this age of sexual permissiveness and Free Scientific Inquiry, you seem to have cro ssed a line into very ah controversial territory, as well as being in violation of Section 666, the Bestiality law. What we want to know is\"-he paused for a deep breath- \"why did you do it, Doctor? And how in hell did you get so many important people involved?\" \"My God,\" Dashwood said. \"You really want to know the idea behind it all.\" \"Yes,\" DeAct said. \"Certainly. That's our problem in a nutshell.\" \"I don't go along with any of this, DeAct,\" Knight said. \"It's just a case of degeneracy and perversion, and who cares what rationalizations they have?\" \"That'll be enough, To bias,\" DeAct repeated. \"I always say,\" Knight went on, \" 'Scrat ch a scientist and you'll find an atheist, and scratch an atheist and you'll find a goddamned Commie.' \" \"That will be enough, I said.\" Dashwood was thinking. This was the old Mutt-and-Jeff routin e: the tough, dumb cop who terrified you, and the smart, sympathetic cop who encouraged you to explain yourself. Still . . . \"Very well,\" he said. \"I will attempt to explain Project Pan.\" \"You can call your lawyer before talking to us,\" DeAct said hurriedly. \"You can call a psychiatrist, too, if you want,\" he added. \"I am a psychiatrist,\" Dashwood reminded him. Was DeAct worried about the Supreme Co urt and the international repercussions of putting sixty-eight top scientists on trial, or did he have some intuitive sense of the magnitude of what Project Pan was all about? \"Can you take me seriously,\" Dashwood spoke directly to DeAct, \"if I tell you that what we have discovered here is the summum bonum, the secret of secrets, the key to the mystic powers of the ancients, the medici ne of metals, the stone of the wise, the lost art of the Rosicrucians . . . that what you have been trained to consider most despicable is the central sacrament of existence, the key to higher consciousness and intelligence, the evolut ionary imperative, the greatest scientific b reakthrough to our epoch? Of course I always knew I would go to jail for it. I regard myself as lucky to live in an age when you won't burn me at the stake.\" DeAct lit another cigarette, avoiding Dashwood's eyes. He mumbled, \"You sound a bit grandiose, Doctor.\" 219 / 233"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"\"This guy's a schizo,\" Knight said, more bluntly. \"Let me begin at the beginning,\" Dashwood said, ignoring Knight. \"We are all primates. Do you understand that, gentlemen?\" \"Sure,\" DeAct said. \"Evolution. I had that in college.\" \"It's just a theory,\" Knight grumbled. \"A man still has the right to believe in God in this country, you know.\" Knight was rather overdoing the tough-cop routine, Dashwood thought. \"It's a biochemical fact,\" Dash wood said, \"that ninety-eight percent of our DNA is identical with ch impanzee DNA. Eighty- five percent of our DNA is identical with that of the South Am erican spider monkey, our most distant relative in the primate family. That means, gentlemen, that most of our behavior is genetically programmed to follow the same survival, status, and sex programs as the other primates. We are only two percen t different from the chimpan zee, and only fifteen percent different from the spider monkey. Think of that the next time you go to the zoo. Our cousins are looking out at us through the bars. \"Now let me emphasize this, gentlemen. We suffer from certain induced cultural hall ucinations. Every tribe brainwashes its children into the island-reality of the adults of the tribe; that 's the great discovery of Einstein in her principle of neurolo gical relativism. \"In our tribe-Western Christian civilization, as it's called-we have brainwashed ours elves into not seeing and not thinking about our relationship to the other primates and to life in ge neral. We know we are primates if we have gotten as far as college\"-he emphasized the last for Knight-\"but we keep forgetting it, ignoring it, losing track of it.\" \"Bullburger,\" Knight growled. It was a typical primate reaction in a threat situation, Dashw ood thought. \"G o on,\" DeAct said nervously, lighting a third cigarette. \"If I were to wr ite a novel of about six hundred pages,\" Dashwood said, \"and mentioned on every one of the first four hundred pages that all of us are primates, we would find it funny or satirical. Even stranger, if I stopped mentioning it for about two hundred pages, the readers would all forget it qu ickly, and be startled if I mentioned it again on page five hundred fifteen . It's a fact that all educated persons know, b ut most of us would rather forget or simply not think about. \"Now, what is Bestiality, gentlemen?\" Dashwood didn't pause, but answered his own question. \"Sexual relations between a human and an animal. But humans ar e animals, as we keep forgettin g, so that definition is culturally biased and self-serving. Bestiality is sex between animals, that's all. Interspecies sex. And any biologist will tell you that is quite common. Insects will Potter Stewart any bug that comes al ong if they can't find th eir own species. The ubiquity of the mule, gentlemen, shows how common is the occurrence of in terspecies sex-bestiality as our law calls it-between horses and donkeys. Throughout the rept ile, bird, and fish kingdoms, the same behavior is commonplace. \"There is no species on the planet, gentle men, that thinks it is 'degrading' to have sex with another species- except ourselves . And that is because we are trying to forget that we are primates.\" Dashwood paused. \"This is some kind of put-on,\" Tobias Knight said irritably. \"Get to the point, Dashwood.\" But DeAct was crushing out his cigarette with a thoughtfill frow n. \"So that's your defense, then?\" he asked. \"Scientific inquiry and so on ... You just wanted to find out the ah subj ective similarities and differences in comparing Bestiality with ordinary sex and homosexuality and ah the other variations?\" \"Defense!\" Dashwood exclaimed. \"I am not defending myself. Whether defense is necessary at all remains to be seen. Right now, I am merely filling you in on the background as you requested.\" He paused. \"All progress is made by violating taboos,\" he went on presentl y. \"A certain friend of mine ah made that observation many years ago.\" \"Blake Williams,\" Tobias Knight said. \"We know he's in this up to his ears.\" \"A certain friend,\" Dashwood went on, neither confirming nor de nying. \"He pointed out that without heretics and b lasphemers-without rebels, that is-we would all still be living like Homo Erectus half a mil lion years ago. All progress has 220 / 233"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"been made by individuals who dared to think about the unthinkable and do the forbidden. As Oscar Wilde said, 'Disobedience was man's Original Virtue.' Those who dare-\" \"Wilde was a Bryanting degenerate,\" Knight growled. He was showing more of his canine teet h now: the signal of primate anger. \"Those who dare cross the line-any line-ar e explorers, and explorers sometimes get lost,\" Dashwood went on. \"But without them, we never would have walked out of the tribal stage into the ur ban or out of the Dark Ages into the Renaissance. \"But enough rhetoric. Let me come to the point. \"Gentlemen, dozens of anthr opologists have sat in this office and told me st ories that once made my hair stand on end. And dozens, and scores, of parapsychologists have told me even wilder tales. Gentlemen, everybody outside Bad Ass or Seattle knows that the line between Experimental Music and Noise is very hard to find, that the line between avant-garde literature and nonsense is ambiguous, that even th e line between the Beautiful and the Hideou s is far from fixed, since a Ubangi woman with a plate in her lip is attractive to a Ubangi ma n, but absurd or repulsive to most of us. Mathematicians know that what constitutes proof is still not itself totally understood. Scie ntific Truth, so called, used to remain the same for millenn ia; then it began changing every century; in th is century, it has changed ev ery decade, or even quicker in some fields. And yet, in spite of all this, we think there is a firm, fixed, immutable boundary between the Real and the Unreal. \"Gentlemen, there is no such boundary. \"Everything that we regard as filthy, obscene, blasphemous , and disgusting is part of the ancient mind-science called Magick.\" Dashwood smiled gently. \"Sex with a mens truating woman is forbidden, and considered 'indecent' or appalling, because it was once part of the sacraments of the Moon Goddess cult. The menstruating woman was thought to be possessed by the Goddess, I suppose, but the theory doesn't matter. Judeo-Chri stian civilization put the practice under a ban, and made it 'evil,' because it was part of the ancient Goddess religion that the worshipers of a Male God could not tolerate. \"Homosexuality is forbidden and considered revolting and ugly because it was part of the tradition of shamanism in most parts of the world not included in the Judeo-Christian cult. \"And yet, what do we find within the Judeo-Christian world itself? What do we find in the most orthodox times? We find secret cults using these forbidden acts fo r occult purposes. Sex with a menstruating woman was called 'the mystery of the Red Gold' by the alchemists, and was part of the process of consciousness expansion in that form of Ma gick. Homosexuality was part of the secret teachings of the Kn ights Templar and many other Magick cults.\" \"There are perverts everywhere,\" Knig ht said. \"That doesn't prove anything.\" Dashwood smiled again. \"Tell me,\" he asked, \"how do you feel after a good Potter Stewart?\" \"What does that prove?\" Knight demanded. \"Let us see where it leads us,\" Dashwood said. \"You feel good, do you not? Yes, you will agree to that much. How would you feel after Potter Stewarting for four hours?\" \"Tired.\" \"Not if you were trained in Tantra,\" Dashwood said. \"Tantrists have been known to continue the sexual act for far longer- eight hours, even. Is it not strange that Shakespeare referred to it as 'the monetary trick,' and Kinsey found, back in the forties, that the average Unistat male reaches Millett in less than two minutes? Is this not part of the Taboo I am discussing, the Taboo on the Magick secrets of non-Judeo-Christian religion? We have loosened up a lot since Kinsey's day, but to a Tantrist we are still rushing and missing the little details, you might say. Why is that?\" DeAct lit another cigarette. \"Jesus,\" he said, \"are you telling us that every kind of sex that's forbidden in the Bible is the key to some kind of occult knowledge or power? Is that it?\" \"A long time ago, when I wasn't ready to understand yet,\" Dashwood said, \"a parapsychologi st told me, 'Scratch a trance medium and you'll find a homosexual.' That's not one hundr ed percent true, but it's true more often than not. 221 / 233"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"\"The Moon Goddess is a metaphor, let us say. But what happens to a woman in her menses, the power that is present and can be used in mind science, is no me taphor. \"Now, what started Project Pan was something I discovered, by 'accident' as they say, just browsing in a book that didn't seem to relate to my own work at all, a book on Egypt, and there it was: there was a priestess who performed fellatio on a goat every year on the Egyptian New Year's Day, which is our July 23. Yes, gentlemen-in the vernacular, she gave the goat a Steinem Job.\" \"There are perverts everywhere,\" Knight repeated. \"This was central to the Egyptian religion,\" Dashwood said. \"Was the whole religion a perversion? Don't you see, everything called perversion got that name because it was part of the old Magick tradition? \"And guess what, gentlemen: What is the most common subject in the cave paintings left by our ancestors thirty thousand years ago? \"Bestiality. Yes, gentlemen-our ancestors portrayed themselves , over and over, having sex with goats and bisons and every animal they knew about.\" \"I don't believ e it,\" Knight said flatly. \"Look it up sometime,\" Dashwood said pleasantly. \"It's mentioned in Ghost Dance: Origins of Religion, by Wes-ton LeBarre, one of our most respected anthropologists. You never see those paintings in any popular books of cave art, but ev ery paleoanthropologist knows about them. \"You find the same in ancient Indian art, ancient Babylonian art, ancient art everywhere. \"And you find the Magick secret coded into myth and legend over and over. The formula for producing a Man-God or Super-Hero is the mating of human and animal. Europa and the bull; Leda and the swan; Beauty and the Beast; the Buddha fathered by a white elephant in some versions of the legend. \"Tantric sex is the portal of the mysteries, and the alchemists called it the secret of silver. This is the secret of gold, gentlemen. And it's even coded into the Judeo-Christian mythos -after the Gnostics got through editing the manuscripts. Why do you think Eve and the Serpent are credited with giving us the knowledge of good and evil? Why does the Hebrew word for 'serpent,' neschek, have the same Cabalistic value as the word 'Me ssiah'? Why is the Messiah born of the union of a woman with a bird? Can't you read the messa ge in the formula, animal-human-super-human?\" \"This is blasphemous and disgusting, as well as criminal,\" Knight said. \"You, Dr. Dashwood, are as crazy as a loon.\" \"Why do you feel 'good' during and after sex?\" Dashwood went on. \"Just nature's way of tricking us into reproducing the species? Yes, that is part of it. But na ture loves to economize, to do several things at once. You feel high and powerful because you are raising yo ur mental energy- the Kundalini of the Hindu metaphor. With the proper ritual and proper training, the energy can be raised to the point where your Will and Imaginatio n are illuminated with power and you can create a new Reality. Literally. You walk over the line between the state marked 'r eal* as far as you dare to go into the 'unreal,' and you make your new line. Until you have th e courage to try again and go even farther out. ...\" \"Crazy as a loon,\" Knight repeated.

It seemed that some refurbishing and rebuilding had been going on in the downtown area, for Union Square was much bigger than Dashwood remembered and ther e were several new buildings surrounding it, most of them built in hyperbolic and non-Euclidean curves. Chinatown was now facing directly onto the Square instead of being two blocks downhill and to the right, but there was a huge sign on the Chinatown Gate, saying: CLOSED FOR ALTERATIONS FU MANCHU, PROPRIETOR Claude Shannon of Bell Labora tories and Tristan Tzara, the pioneer Dadaist, were picking random words out of people's mouths as they passed and gluing them to a huge billb oard where they had already formed the pseudosentence: AMERICAN LIFE BOMB WENT AUTHORITARIAN IN FRONTAL ATTACK ON AN ENGLISH AUTHOR \"We're discovering the information/re dundance ratio in random signals,\" Shannon explained, waving a program-able calculator. \"We're creating a new Art Form!\" Tzara shouted.

And in that lucidity he knew that he had been lying to himself for months, pretending not to notice what was happening to his body as it gradually terminated its basic functions, fearful of looking straight at Death; but now, in that lucidity, looking at it and seeing that it was just another of the millions of things that Wing Lee Chee (who was 226 / 233"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"so rich and powerful) could not do anything about; but now, in that lucidity and objectivity, looking far down at this particular galaxy, this insignificant solar system, this temporary city, this house that a strong wind could blow away, this absurd old man who was rich and powerful but could not comman d the tides or alter the paths of the stars, it was all suddenly a great joke and every little detail made sense. For, in this new lucidity and objectivity and self less perspective, he did not giggle or weep or feel dazed, bu t only smiled, very sl ightly, knowing he would soon lo se this body, which was like an old run-down car, and this central nervous system, which wa s like a tired and increasingl y incompetent driver, and the meta-programmer in the higher nervous cen ters which gave him this perspective, because out here beyond space-time he simply did not give a damn about that life, that planet, or that universe anymore.

No, don't weep again; it is nothing to me. I feel like one of the last dinosaurs.\" \"You are the best man in the wo rld,\" she said, eyes flashing. \"I have been good to you,\" he said. \"I have been as much of a scoundrel as was necessary to be rich and comfortable. Many will be glad of my death.\" He told her how he was arranging to have most of his estate liquidated, turned into cash, and deposited in her account. He urged her to take advantage of the longe vity drugs as they became avai lable, and to meditate ever y day. \"One year of life is wonderful, when you are conscious of the details. A thousand years would be more wonderful.\" And then he added a strange thing: \"Think of me sometimes, and look for me. Yo u'll never see old Wing Lee Ghee again, but you'll see what I really am if you look hard enough and long enough.\" And then he suddenly realized it was comi ng even sooner than he ha d expected. \"How ab surd,\" he said. \"I must lie down now.\" He stretched out on her couch. \"I must have walked too far,\" he said. \"So many hills ... so many ups and downs . . . and all I want now is one thing. Open your blouse, please. That's right, thank you. No, I just want to look at them. Such lovely Brownmillers, like peaches. Let me touch them. No, let me kiss them . No, never mind, I'm going now.\" \"Don't go,\" she cried. \"Ki ss them, kiss them first.\" \"Right back where I started,\" he sa id, suckling. And then he left her. Ms. Ying decided to go to the French Rivi era after the funeral. She would spend a year there, having a series of young, crude, unintelligent lovers (who wouldn't remind her of him) and then decide what to do with her money and the rest of her life. She sold the Rehnquist and a lot of other junk when she gave up her house in Hong Kong. The wholesaler didn't know what to do with the Rehnquist at first, but he finally sold it to a Sex Shop in Yokohama. Markoff Chaney was vacationi ng in Japan that summer, because-after years of paying him only about three hundred dollars a month-his stocks in Blue Sky, In c., were suddenly paying two thousand dollars or three thousand dollars a month. Blue Sky made zero-gravity devices that were pr oving very useful in the space-cities President Hubbard had created. 227 / 233"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Chaney had also written a book, which was selling moderately well despit e its rather eccentric thesis. It was his endeavor to prove that all the great achievemen ts in art, science, and culture were the work of p ersons who were, on the average, less than five feet tall, and often shorter. He claimed that this fact had been \"covered up\" by what he called \"unconsci ous sizeist prejudice\" on the part of professional historians. He had called the book Little Men with Big Balls, but the publisher, out of a sense that Chaney perhaps had some unconscious prejudice of hi s own and certainly lacked good taste, had changed the title to L ittle People with Big Ideas. Chaney spent his first day in Japan visiting Kyoto. He went out to see where the Temple of the Golden Pavilion had once stood, and he spen t three hours walking around there, tr ying to get into the head of the Zen monk who had burned it down. Chaney had known the story for y ears: how the monk, working on the koan \"Does a dog have the Buddha Nature?\", had tried one answer after anot her, always getting hit upside the head by his Roshi and told he didn't have it yet. Finally, after medi tating continuously for a day and a half without sleep or food, the monk had a brainstorm of some kind and dashed from his cell with a hell of a yell and burned down the Temple, the most beauti ful building in Japan at the time. The court had declared the monk insane. After three hours of trying to get into the monk's he ad-space when he set fire to the building, Chaney had his own brainsto rm. He had been ignoring Dr. Dashwood fo r three or four months, he realized. He took a cab to Western Union and dispatched a te legram to Dr. Dashwood at Orgasm Research. It said: FLOSSING IS THE ANSWER EZRA POUND Chaney had gotten those words many months ago, while having some dental work done. The dentist suggested they try nitrous oxide, and Ch aney eagerly agreed. He remembered that the great psychologist William James had once thought he had the whole secret of the Universe on a nitrous oxide trip. What James had writ ten down, in trying to verbalize his insight, was OVERALL THERE IS A SMELL OF FRIED ONIONS. Chaney wanted to know what it was like to be in the state where fried onions would explain everything. He sniffed deeply an d expectantly as the mask was pl aced over his nose, and waited. N o illumination came at first, but the room seemed to be getting bigger and bigger, and then it was getting smaller and smaller, and then he became aware that th e dentist, as was typical of his species, was making remonstrating noises as he gazed into Chaney's mouth, sayi ng that brushing was not eno ugh and that ev erybody should be more conscious of dental hygiene and so on, all the usual craperoo, and then he, Chaney, wasn't there anymore, he wasn 't anywhere; it was just like what he had heard about quantum jumping in physics, because he was there again, ha ving gone from 0 to 1, and then going back to 0 again, not being there, and th en back to 1 again and the dentist said somberly, like a very wise old wizard: \"Flossing is the answer.\" And Chaney felt like he might giggle or w eep, but was too dazed to do either, havi ng found it at last, the Answer. And it was so simple, as all the mystics said; it was right out in the open and we didn't notice it because we weren't conscious of th e details. And he stared up, awed, at th e wise face of the great sage who had given it to him, at last, the Answer. F lossing. And the damnedest part of it was that for weeks after he still had flashes when he thought that was it, the Answer. Flossing. After Kyoto, Chaney went to Yokohama to see the infamous Se x Shops, as was inevitable. 228 / 233"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"In the first Sex Shop he purchased an artificial vagina which s eemed vastly superior, in both realism and pneumatic grip, to the model he had at home. In the second Sex Shop he bought a box of pornographic Easter Eggs. By then he was feeling the surging despair again, knowing that these substitutes were not what he really wanted, knowing his loneliness and his exile with that bitterness that he usually kept at bay by concentrating on the absurdity of everything- in-general, experiencing the terrible isolation of being out th ere on the moon separated from the ridiculous oversized clods by 250,000 miles and sizeist prejudice. And then, in the third Sex Shop, he found it. The Answer. And it wasn't flossing at all. Dr. Glopberger had worked in the Sex Change department of Johns Hopkins for a long time, and thought that nothing could surprise him any longer. Markoff Chaney surprised him. \"No,\" Chaney said, in answer to the firs t question Glopberger always asked, \"I've never felt like a woman trapped in a man's body.\" \"Um,\" Glopberger said. \"Well, sir, what do you want here?\" Chaney opened the box in his lap. \"Good God,\" Glopberger sa id. \"I've only seen one that big once in my life.\" What was th at character's name- Wildebeeste? Strange one: he had kept it afte r the operation, had it mounted on a plaque or something like that. \"You see,\" Chaney explained, \"I don't want to b ecome a woman. I want to become more of a man.\" \"Well,\" said Dr. Glopberger, professionally. \"Well, well.\" It was an ingenious challenge, ev en with the advances in Sex Surgery in the past three years, but it could be done. . . . My word, it would be a Medical First. The stocks in Blue Sky were now paying eight thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars a month. \"Name your price,\" Chaney said with a steely glint. Justin Case heard about the man with no name at one of Mary Margaret Wildeblood's wild, wild parties. Joe Malik, the editor of Confrontation, told the story. It was rather hard for Case to follow because the party wa s huge and noisy -a typical Wildeblood soiree. All the usual celebrities were there-Blake Williams, th e most boring crank in the galaxy; Juan Tootrego, the rocket engineer responsible for the fi rst three space-cities; Carol Christmas, the man who had invented the first longevity drug, Ex-Tend; Natalie Drest, the fiery feminist; Bertha Van Ation, th e astronomer who had discov ered the first real Black Hole, in the Sirius double-star system; Markoff Chaney, the mi dget millionaire who owned most of Blue Sky, Inc. Hordes of other names-maxi-, midi-, and mini-celebrities-swarmed through Mary Marg aret's posh Sutton Place pad as the evening wore on. There was a lot of booze, a lot of hash , and-due to Chaney-altogether too much coke. \"The town was called Personville,\" Malik was saying, \"and th e man with no name was a de tective for a big agency like Pinkerton's. But then Kurasawa adapted it, an d the man with no name became a Samurai.\" \"Of course we can go to the stars,\" Markoff Chaney was sayi ng, even louder, on Case's other side. \"The speed of light doesn't mean a thing when you consider wh at the next two or three jumps of longev ity will bring. Ther e are no real limits anywhere, except in the thinking of the timid and the conservative.\" He was armed with new Courage. \"Then he became Glint Ea stwood,\" Malik said. \"What's your game?\" Juan Tootrego asked, making conversation. \"Oh, art,\" Case said. \"I write the art column in Confrontation. \" 229 / 233"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"\"But he still doesn't have a name!\" Malik exclaimed. \"Then you're the man who discovered El Mir,\" Juan Tootrego said, impressed.

The First Man fidgeted in their gaze. \"I'm not here to do any electioneering,\" he said. \"He's one of the best chess player s in the country,\" Mary Margaret said, completing the introduction. \"Um how does it feel to be married to a politician?\" Case asked, trying to put Simon at ease. \"Eve has her thing, and I have mine,\" Simon said. \"I have a theory,\" Blake Willia ms orated, \"that the chessboard is a model of the human brain. What do you think of that, Mtr. Hubbard?\" \"Mt. Moon,\" Simon said quickly. He was a Masculinist. \"You see,\" Malik went on, \"whether he's a detective, a Samurai, or a cowboy, he still has no name. Isn't that archetypal?\" \"I always look at the bright side,\" Hagbard Celine was saying to Natalie Drest. \"There's only 337,665 years to go in the Kali Yuga, for instance.\" \"Well, if Batman is so smart,\" Marvin Gardens muttered, \"why does he wear his underdrawers outside of his pants?\" \"Pardon me,\" Simon Moon was asking Blak e Williams, \"but did you say Grand Canyon should be considered as an artistic whole or as an artistic hole?\" \"Why, yes,\" Markoff Chaney wa s telling Mary Margaret, \"I am working on a second book. It's called Reality Is What You Can Get Away With, and it's about the future evolution of consciousness and intelligence.\" His Courage was growing. \"Childproof bottles, my Abzug,\" Marvin Gardens complained. \"There isn't a child in the world who doesn't have the patience and curiosity to open one of them.\" \"He has no name,\" Malik said, \"because he is Death, and Death is a nightmare from which humanity is beginning to awaken.\" \"It's time to stop worshiping gods,\" Chaney went on earnestly , \"and aim at becoming gods.

Because of the magnetism of his personalit y, neither of them was conscious of the fact that she was looking a long way down at him. \"Let's sniff a little more coke,\" Chaney suggested. \"I have some cognac left too,\" she whispered. \"Perfect,\" he said, and quoted: Heart of my h eart, come out of the rain, Soak me in cognac, love and cocaine!

GLOSSARY: A GUIDE FOR THE PERPLEXED BELL'S THEOREM: A mathematical demonstration by Dr. John S. Bell, which shows that if quantum mechanics is valid, any two particles once in contact will conti nue to influence each othe r, no matter how far apart they may subsequently move. This violates Special Relativity, unless the influence between the particles is not employing any known energy. COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION: The theory formulated by Niels Bohr, according to which the state vector (see below) should be regarded as a mathemat ical formalism. In other words-which some physicists will dispute- the equations of quantum mechanics do not describe what is happening in the subatomic world but what mathematical systems we need to create to think of that world. COSMIC GLUE: A metaphor to describe the quantum interconnectedness that must exist if Bell's Theorem be valid. Coined by Dr. Nick Herbert. E 1GENSTATE: One of a finite number of states that a quantum system can be in. Th e Superposition Principle says that, before measurement, a system must be considered to be in all of its etgenstates; measurement selects one eigenstate. EINSTEIN-ROSEN-PODOLSKY EFFECT: The qu antum interconnectedness as described in a paper by Einstein, Rosen, and Podolsky. The purpose of said paper was to prove that quantum mechanics cannot be valid, since it leads to such an outlandish conclusion. Since Bell's Theo rem, some physicists have chosen to accept the interconnectedness, however outlandish it may seem. See QUIP. 231 / 233"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"EVERETT-WHEELER-GRAHAM MODEL: An alternative to Bell's Theorem and the Copenhagen Interpretation. According to Everett, Wheeler, an d Graham, everything that can happen to the state vector (see below) does happen to it. FORM: In the sense of G. Spencer Brown, a mathematical or logical system necessa ry to systematic thought but having the inevitable consequences of imposing its own deep structures upon th e experiences packaged and indexed by the form. See COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION. HIDDEN VARIABLE: An alternative to Bell, Copenhagen, and Everett-Wheeler-Graham. As developed by Dr. David Bohm, the Hidden Variable theory assume s that quantum events are determined by a subquantum system acting outside or before the universe of space-tim e known to us. Dr. Evan Harr is Walker and Dr. Nick Herbert have suggested that the Hidden Variable is consciousness; Dr. Jack Sarfatti suggests that it is information. INFORMATION: A measure of the unpredictability of a message; that is, the more unpredictable a message is, the more information it contains. Since systems tend to disorder (acco rding to the second law of ther modynamics), we can think of the degree of order in a system as the amount of information in it. Ordinarily information is transmitted as an ordering of energy (a signal), in which th e energy and its ordering (the message) is tr ansmitted from one place to another. Dr. Jack Sarfatti has suggested that the nonlocality of the ERP effect and Bell's Theorem ma y entail the instantaneous transfer of order from one place to another without any energy transfer. Thus we can have both Bell's Theorem and Special Relativity, since Special Relativity only prohibits the instantaneous tran sfer of energy and does not say anything about instantaneous transfer of information. N EURO-: A prefix denoting \"known or mediated by the nervous system.\" Since all human knowledge is neurological in this sense, every science may be considered a neuro-science; e.g., we have no physics but neurophysics, no psychology but neuropsychology and ultimately, no neurology but neuroneur ology. But neuroneurology would itself be known by the nervous system, leading to neuro-neuroneurology etc., in an infinite regress. See VON NEUMANN'S CATASTROPHE. N ONLOCAL: Not depending upon space and time. A nonlocal effect occurs instantaneously and with no attenuation due to distance. Special Relativity seem s to forbid all such non-local effects, but Bell's Theorem seems to show that quantum mechanics demands them. The only solutions thus far offere d to this contradiction are that nonlocal ef fects involve \"consciousness\" rather than energy (Walker, Herbert) or that they involve \"infor mation\" rather than energy (Sarfatti). N ONOBJECTIVITY: One of the two alternatives to Bell's Theorem (the other being the Everet t -Wheeler-Graham model). In order to avoid nonlocality, some physicists such as Dr. John A. Wheeler prefer this option, which holds that the universe has no reality aside from observation. The extreme fo rm of this view says \"Esse est percepi\"- to be is to be perceived. POTENTIA: The name given to the presumed subquan-tum world by Dr. Werner Heisenberg. Space and time do not exist in potentia; but all the phenomena of the sp ace-time manifold emerge from potentia. Compare with HIDDEN VARIABLE and INFORMATION. QUANTUM: An entity whose energi es occur in discrete lumps- e.g., photons are the quanta of th e electromagnetic field. Quanta have both wave and particle aspects, the wave aspect being the probability of detecting the particle at a certain place and time. QUANTUM LOGIC: A system of symbolic lo gic not restricted to the \"either it's A or it's not-A\" choices of Aristotelian logic. Chiefly due to Dr. John Von Neumann and Dr. David Finkelstein, this approach evades the paradoxes of other interpretations of quantum mechanics by assuming that the universe is multivalued, not two-valued; Dr. Finkelstein expresses this by saying \"In addition to a yes and a no, the universe contains a maybe.\" See E/GENSTATE. QUANTUM MECHANICS: The mathematical system for describi ng the atomic and subatomic realm. There is no dispute about how to do quantum mechanics- i.e., calculate the probabilities within this realm. All the controversy is about what the quantum mechanics equations imply about reality, which is known as the interpretation of quantum mechanics. The principal lines of interpretation are the Copenhagen Interp retation and/or Nonobjec-tivity and/or Bell's Theorem and/or N onlocality and/or the Everet t -Wheeler-Graham multi-worlds model. QUIP: The quantum inseparability principle. An acronym coined by Dr. Nick Herbert to refer to the nonlocality implicit in the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky argument and explicit in Bell's Theorem. STATE VECTOR: The mathematical expression describing one of two or more states that a quantum system can be in; for instance, an electron can be in either of two spin states, called \"spin up\" and \"spin down.\" The amusing thing about quantum mechanics is that each state vector can be regard ed as the superposition of other state vectors. SUPERDETERMINISM: The approach to quantum theory urged by Dr. Fritjof Capra in The Tao of Physics. This interpretation rejects \"contrafactual definiteness\"; that is, it assumes that an y statements about what could have happened are 232 / 233"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"meaningless. A consequence of this view is that all distinction betw een observer and ob served, or self and universe, also becomes meaningless; I had no choice about writing this book, Dell Books had no choice about publishing it, and you had no choice about reading it, since there is only one thing happening and we are all s eamlessly welded into it. SYNCHRONICITY: A term introduced by psychologist Dr. Ca rl Jung and physicist Dr. Wolfgang Pauli to describe connections, or meaningful \"coincidences,\" that do not make se nse in terms of cause-and-effect. It is thought by some that such connections may indicate the Hidden Variable at work or some sort of nonlocal Information System. VON NEUMANN'S CATASTROPHE: More fully, Von Neumann's cat astrophe of the infinite regress. A demonstration by Dr. John Von Neumann that quantum mechan ics entails an infinite regress of meas urements before the quantum uncertainty can be removed. That is, any measuring device is itself a quantum system containing un certainty; a second measuring device, used to monitor the first, contains its own quantum uncertainty; and so on, to infinity. Wigner and others have p ointed out that this uncertainty is only terminated by the decision of the ex perimenter. Compare NEURO-. 233 / 233"}]
