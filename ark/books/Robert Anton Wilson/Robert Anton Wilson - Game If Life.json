The science of exo-psychology, which analyzes human affairs from an extraterrestrial (future) viewpoint, here links up with ancient, pre-scientific psychologies which were so futique that they all but disappeared into the occult (meaning \"hidden\") traditions, and have suffered distortions and loss to the scientific community until now. Before you read how Dr. Leary relates the 22 trumps of the Medieval Tarot deck, the 12 \"sun signs\" of astrology and the 8 trigrams of the Chinese Book of Changes (/ Ching) to the evolving periodic table (here spiral) of elements, the ethological concept of castes, and, most im- portant, to the next quantum leap in human consciousness (as well as the next several down the line), I want to back up a bit and reiterate two basic principles of exo-psychology. Recapitulation that ontogeny repeats phytogeny. This concept is easily demonstrated in the development of the human embryo (which at various times has gills and a tail), but seldom extended to the whole lifespan of the individual as here. You will find in Game of Life, as in In- telligence Agents and Exo-psychology, not only the idea that evolution is proceeding into pre- programmed post-human stages which will carry us off this planet, but also that some human beings are (have always been) literally ahead of their times in having activated what Dr. Leary calls \"circuits\" of their nervous systems years or even centuries ahead of general human development. Recapitulation is thus only a part of a genetic process which throws (\"castes\") out futique as well as antique forms. This would explain the development pre-scientifically of con- cepts now being explored in such modern sciences as human ethology (sociobiology) and quan- tum physics. Imprinting The idea that during preprogrammed periods in an individual's development the organism is open to fixating on certain behaviors is still mainly confined to animal psy- chology (Konrad Lorenz). That this might extend to human behaviors is only now being investi- gated by such researchers as Dr. Marshall Klaus of Cleveland and psychologist Donna Kontos of Toronto, who appear to be amassing evidence that human infants (and mothers) experience a period of heightened suggestibility following birth in which both baby and mother will imprint each other as love/care objects or in which both gain the impression, through hospital pro- cedures, that the other is not really there for hir. If you put these two ideas together, you can see the possibility that, from a genetic point of view, a whole species might experience periods of great suggestibility during which it might make great leaps ahead in intelligence learn to make fire, develop a planetary perspective. The timeliness of this book is in the context of the dominance in Southern California the last terrestrial frontier of what Dr. Leary once called \"suntanned, graceful, sensory-equipped, yogic\" Fifth Circuit (see Part III) individuals. As a result of his insight that this flowering of beau- ty and self-actualization is not the end of human evolution (nor a mere sign of Western deca- dence), Dr. Leary points to the next step a fusion of human energies to lift life off the planet and thus open up the ecological and economic system of Sol 3. The human species is ac- celerating to escape velocity. What kind of transmission would be most helpful in facilitating the exploration of human communities tolerant and knowledgeable enough to withstand the accleration/radiation of post- terrestrial individuals? One answer lies in human ethology: in the exo-psychological concept of seasonally varied genetic differences in human nervous systems. Exo-psychology's success in prediction is backed by Dr. Leary's career of anticipating the movements of human consciousness. And your success in surfing the evolutionary waves to come may be dependent on the ex- tent to which you understand the concepts presented here. As for comprehending Dr. Leary's work, I'll give you George Koopman's advice: read each sentence as though it were a paragraph. Now: surf's up! (Serfs are down!

One might object that this concept of the nervous system as relativistic center of sensation, perception, consciousness and intelligence is not new. Again we shall make the comparison with atomic physics. Democritus pointed out over two thousand years ago that all matter was composed of atoms, but in spite of this clue, Newtonian physics, which is neuro-muscular, disregarded the elemental energy-structure of matter. Assume that the larval symbolic mind, using the lower circuits of the nervous system, has, in exactly the same fashion, produced magnificent and complex systems of muscular thought in ignorance of the electro-chemical neural structure of con- sciousness and intelligence. The Einsteinian formulae demonstrated the metamorphic relativity of energy, time and matter and made possible the transmutation of elements and the release of enormous energy by means of fission and fusion.

Let Neuro-Physics be the study of how our knowledge of atomic and nuclear processes is limited and guided by the capacities of the evolving nervous system, by the genetic templating, by the neural imprinting and conditioning of the scientists who study these processes; and how the nervous system is formed and influenced by physical forces. This list defining hyphenated sciences could continue for pages. We are attempt- ing to illustrate the fact that the basic instrument for receiving, observing, recording, storing, synthesizing and transmitting information about all fields of knowledge and branches of human activity is the nervous system, along with the extensions of the nervous system which have been designed by the nervous system, e.g., computers, electronics, etc. It is obligatory in every scientific report to describe in great precision the instru- ments used to obtain the data and the methods used to analyze the data.

Exo-Psychology suggests that a rudimentary understanding of the operation and management of the nervous system would clarify and enlighten every aspect of life- allowing human beings to decode the answers to the basic genetic questions: why are we here? where are we going? how do we get there? It is time we had some answers to these riddles beyond the pompous (and unproven) dogmas of larval religion, the bland no-answer of Zen, or the humorous resignation of the wit who wrote: We're here because we're here because we're here because we're here. And our answer must begin with examination of the instrument of investigation itself: the human brain. Let us review our neurological ABC's. Nobody but the most naive would claim that a dog perceives the same room as his human companion. We know, for instance, that human beings differ from other animals in using vision more than smell to orient themselves; we use the vision circuitry of our brain as much as those quite distant relatives, the birds. The dog (like the wolf, tiger, hamster and other mammals) marks his territory by smell, identifies friend and foe by odor, lives in what would appear to us an incredibly rich and subtle olfactory continuum, and sees perhaps only two basic colors to our eight. The dog's nervous system, lacking the symbolic-linguistic circuits of ours, codes these mostly-olfactory signals into pre-linguistic categories, mostly keyed to immediate glandular-emotional response. The mosquito flying in through the window has a very different brain circuitry and realizes a room different from that of either dog or WoMan. Finally, since no two humans are alike in 1 . genetic wiring 2. neural imprinting 3. social conditioning and learning, no two people ever \"see\" (smell, hear, taste, integrate) the \"same\" room. The Sufi parable of the twenty-four Wind men and the elephant remains the paradigm of neurologic, reminding us that human beings come in very different models, wired with different brain circuits. Now, this is more or less understood in optics, in general neurology, in semantics, etc., but we still tend to attribute a kind of universal reality to our very unique neural abstractions. 6"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ADVERTISEMENT REALITY A FABRICATION OF YOUR YOU REAL- EYES THE UNIVERSE YOU IN-HABIT C Houj toMt ir*v 5o jj } HtftLTHY ftNP^ / \"TOO 1 .!

Or, as Alan Watts said so charmingly, we are a weird bunch who can't tell the menu from the meal. We do not regard our impressions as \"part of ME,\" my creation, my logical- artistic map of the world with my thoughts and aesthetics woven into its very fabric. We can be shown, with optical and neurological diagrams, how the signal from the space-time event travels to our receptors and is transmitted through the unique circuitry of our nervous system, but we still retain the paradoxical feeling that the final sensory abstraction (our \"perception\" of the event) is more \"real\" than the energy-signals themselves. We fear that accepting the proven scientific facts and redefining our concept of reality will plunge us into subjectivism, hippie Zen, agnosticism, loss of all standards, moral impotence, confusion. Or, if we can conquer this fear (which basically exists in confronting every new discovery) we still can't see the need for re-programming our circuits to remember, moment-by-moment, what is actually happening as we receive, code, classify, integrate energy signals. Thus, we voluntarily retain the lazy, inaccurate, unscientific assumption that it is reasonable and safe to continue acting as if the world were no more than our private map of it."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Each human dyad is Robinson Crusoe and Friday, two alien intelligences, groping for signals that can transmit experiences across space-time. In a deeper sense, each DNA-robot abstracts via its unique nervous system a seemingly complete model of the universe. This model seems complete in that it is \"whole,\" integrated, harmonious, includes all data consciously apprehended by the organism, meshes with continuous sensory input (or is rapidly revised), and is regarded as \"real.\" The habit of treating this private model as if it were the universe is called identification by both Korzybski, the semanticist, and Gurdjieff, the \"mystic.\" This habit produces reality dogmatism, reality intolerance, reality fanaticism. Exo-psychology assumes, in evolutionary sequence, 8 circuits or 24 stages of neural integration. At each stage, the nervous system responds to different signals, recognizes different levels of energy and meaning, integrates a new model of the universe. On the primitive levels of development there is an inescapable tendency to make the identification: my model = universe. The primitive nervous system has no way of becoming \"conscious of abstracting,\" no method of learning that the private model is not the universe. At later stages of neural evolution, this tendency still has to be battled, but is no longer irresistible. Yogis, shamans, alchemists, using primitive but direct reimprinting techniques, and modern scientists working in such diverse fields as optics, neurology, neurologic, semantics, relativity physics, bio-psychology, psychology, etc., can gradually become conscious of their own abstracting processes, recognize the relativity of nervous systems, and begin consciously evolving toward ever-higher modes of knowing and being. We may write the equations Rl = F (Stage 1) R2 = F (Stage 2) etc. R24 = F (Stage 24) where R-j, R2, etc., to R24 are the various Reality Models (or \"maps\" as the semanticists say), F as usual means \"a function of\" and Stage 1, Stage 2 ... to Stage 24 are the evolutionary stages of the neurogenetic array. Each evolutionary stage produces its own functional model of the universe, according to the signals received, integrated and transmitted by the circuitry. Slot 3 (Taurus) cannot \"share\" the universe of Slot 12 (Aquarius) because the Caste 3 brain is wired differently from the Caste 14. This theory is entirely general. My Stage 10 is never your Stage 10. We always have differences in genetic templating, neural imprinting, social conditioning and life experience. Learning, then, is endless. Each new nervous system with which we interlock, however briefly, can be a whole new learning-teaching experience.

All matter \"however dissimilar in shape, look or purpose [is] made up, in one compound or another, of only 88 natural elements . . . This limited larder of materials has produced the infinite variety of things by which man lives in much the same way a 26-letter alphabet has provided the enormous array of words by which he communi- cates: through differing combinations, arrangements, and juxtapositions. . . .\" 2 A great scientific achievement of the mid 18th century was the classification of biological families by Carolus Linnaeus. Taxonomy always precedes evolutionary revelation at any level of energy. Thus we see how the conscientious species classi- fication of Linnaeus provided Darwin with the raw material from which he deduced the evolution of genetic families interacting with each other. A great achievement of the mid 19th century was the classification of chemical elements by Mendeleyev. Like Linnaeus, Dimitri discovered that each element is a species grouped into families, division and classes. Each element being defined by its interpersonal interactions with members of other species. The taxonomy of Mendeleyev made possible the insights of the 20th century physicists that chemical elements evolve and mutate. We now understand that each of the natural and each of the experimentally produced elements is a species and belongs to a family. The octave arrangement of the Periodic Table goes from the down-to-earth metals up to the \"noble\" gases. When Mendeleyev began his task of classification 65 elements had been defined. But the elements were a jungle of disorder and no taxonomic principles existed for relating and predicting elements and their familial interaction. Chemistry was in the position of biology before Linnaeus and psychology today. What was needed was an ordering principle, a taxonomic system which would logically and empirically relate the bewildering diversity. The Periodic Table of Elements which is known to every school child is the result of Mendeleyev's intuitive genius. The realization that this periodic ordering of elements in terms of their atomic weight is also a description of the evolution of matter and corresponds in an uncanny way with the periodic rhythm of the evolution of biological species. The central thesis of this manual is that the classic alchemical-philosophic sys- tems (including I Ching, Tarot, Zodiac, Chess) are expressions of the ordinal-sequence of energy-matter as codified in the Periodic Table of Elements. Actually, the basic structure of the Periodic Table was announced by the English chemist, J.A.R. Newland, 4 years earlier. He was laughed at in a public meeting of the Royal Society and roundly rejected, evidently because the eight-part division of the table recalled the attempt of Pythagoras to relate all physical laws to the 8 notes (octave) of the musical scale and thereby suggested \"mysticism.\" 11"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Dmitri all smiles as he receives prize for neurocryptography MENDELEYEV GIVES KEY TO LIFE PLAN A grab-bag of unrelated facts does not define a science any more than a heap of bricks and lumber constitutes a house.

Group 1: The alkali metals. The elements in this unstable family have only one elec- tron in their outer shell. The one electron is easily lost, zapping off to fuse with other species. This family of metals is easily bound into molecules, heavy, terrestrial and is not found in the air or in space. Group 2: The alkaline earth metals. The species in this family are \"down-to earth.\" They are found in rocks, indeed, they are basic to geological formations and are not found as frequently in the airy atmosphere. Group 3: The Boron family. Here we deal with species which make up much of the earth's crust. They are trivalent (having three electrons in the outer layer) and thus combine easily with other species. We are again reminded of the defec- tional tendency of the families of elements they move from earth upward to the gaseous atmosphere. Group 4: The Carbon family. With four electrons in the outer shell these elements combine wildly in a wide diversity of compounds. The carbons form organic molecules almost twice as many compounds as all the other inorganic species. All living matter is organic, i.e. carbon derived. All living matter lives on the surface of the planet, which, as we have seen is formed of the alkaline, earth and boron families. The scum of film which covers the planet is carbon-based. The movement upward away from the earth's core is the direction of the periodic rhythm of matter. Group 5: The Nitrogen family. Nitrogen is a gas and makes up 78% of our atmosphere. This family exists in many forms in nature gaseous and solid. The movement upward-outward is thus continued. From the lightest (nitrogen) to the heaviest (bismuth) this family moves from non-metallic to metallic. We deal here with a group which is transitional from earth to heaven. Group 6: The Oxygen family. These elements possess six electrons in their outer shells. They are both gaseous and solid again representing the transition from earth-core to space. Group 7: The Halogens. Fluorine and chlorine are gases. Bromine is a liquid at room temperature. We deal here with fast-moving species, spacey, super- terrestrial. Group 8: The Noble Gases. Here is an aloof, haughty, aristocratic, \"high\" family that disdains to descend to form compounds with the earthy folk. The outer shell of these species are completely filled with electrons so that they have no earthly needs to combine with other elements. Here the evolutionary trip from earth core, to earth crust, to atmosphere to post-terrestrial status is completed. o o z p m O c rn z o m 13"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"HE LISTED ON CARDS ALL HE KNEW ABOUT EACH ELEMENT We are, of course, interested in the psychology of Mendeleyev because it was his nervous system which first translated, integrated and transmitted the numerical key. Mendeleyev, we are told, arrived at his insight in the most \"get-down,\" personal manner. He became friends with the elements whose nature he sought to understand. He studied their personality characteristics, literally psychoanalyzed their interactive tendencies, traced their \"family\" relations, probed the vicissitudes of their develop- ment.

To personalize, we are not surprised to learn that Dmitri Mendeleyev was, apparently, this sort of human a lover, an active, sharing person, a committed participant in the risky libertarian events of his time. As is the case with almost every monumental alchemist-philosopher in history, he was in trouble with the law and risked imprisonment because of his liberal political and cultural lifestyle. Most relevant to the theme of this book is the technique used by the Russian sage to organize his knowledge. He listed on separate cards everything he knew about each element. He carried the cards with him, continually sorting them in various arrange- ments, seeking the rhythmic sequence of relationship. He was often teased by his friends for centering his scientific activities on the game of \"Patience,\" i.e., \"Solitaire.\" This book is an attempt to relate the cards of Mendeleyev to the cards of the Tarot.

The key to scientific understanding of natural laws at every level of complexity is to personalize the events; to experience them, to empathize with them. The nervous system is the instrument for experiencing. Neurons are composed of atoms and RNA-constructed organic molecules. The nervous system, thus has within its own structure, the elemental and molecular events which scientists study in the outside world. Humans whose 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th circuits have been activated are able to directly experience -somatic -neurological -molecular -atomic-nuclear events. The unfolding, evolving sequence of the chemical elements sets up an ordinal rhythm which must be related to cycles of evolution at more macroscopic levels. If we can personalize, experience the elements as they evolve and as they interact with each other, we may understand not only chemistry but also the periodicity at the molecular-genetic and the neurogenetic levels. Popularizers of modern science, in dramatizing the high velocities of the modern metamorphic-evolutionary view (in contrast to the ancient Aristotelian-Euclidean model of a static, rigid world) often refer to the \"mad dance of atoms.\" This is inept semantic fumbling. The metamorphic dance of energy, as revealed in the 8 pirouettes of the Periodic Table, is elegant as any ballet. Swan Lake itself may look quite \"mad\" to a naive observer, before the rules, rhythms and periodicities are recognized. 15"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"ytf\\\\\\ &>S IS A FUZZ/ HfMPUL g>vr He's 6~or 7H*r R(6nr MINERALS, PLANTS, ANIMALS, HUMANS, POST-HUMANS ALL DANCE TO THE SAME TUNE As Korzybski notes in Science and Sanity: One of the most baffling problems has been the peculiar periodicity or rhythmicity which we find in life. Lately, Lillie and others have shown that this rhythmicity could not be explained by purely physical nor purely chemical means, but that it is satisfactorily explained when treated as a physico-electro-chemical structural occurrence. The famous experiments of Lillie, who used an iron wire immersed in nitric acid and reproduced, experimentally, a beautiful periodicity resembling closely some of the activities of protoplasm and the nervous system, show conclusively that both living and the non-living systems depend for their rhythmic behaviour on the chemically alterable film, which divides the electrically conducting phases. ... In both systems, the electromotive characteristics of the surfaces are determined by the character of the film. . . .3 In his seminars, Korzybski stressed again and again that, if we are going to talk sense about human behavior, we must give up words like \"mind\" and \"soul,\" which were borrowed from philosophers (who, being bankrupt, are in no position to loan anything); we must talk scientifically of the chemical, electrical and structural properties of the brain and of DNA which designed and constructed the brain. In this connection, consider the long-neglected researches of Sir J.G. Bose, who demonstrated around the turn of the century that reaction curves in metals and living systems are often mathematically identical. \"Further work began to convince Bose that the boundary line between so-called 'nonliving' metals and 'living' organisms was tenuous indeed. . . . When he chloroformed plants, Bose discovered that they were as successfully anesthetized as animals, and that when the narcotic vapor was blown away by fresh air like animals they revived.\" Bose also got similar curves on muscles and metals responding to the effects of fatigue or of stimulating, depressing and poisoning drugs. 4 Sir Robert Austen, leading authority on metallurgy, also believed metals are \"alive\" and hinted at this before the Royal Society, but was rebuffed. He later defended Bose's researches vigorously. Said Dr. Bose himself: \"It was when I came upon the mute witness of these self-made records\" of metal, plant and animal response-patterns \"that I understood for the first time a little of that message proclaimed by my ancestors on the banks of the Ganges thirty centuries ago: 'They who see but one in all the changing manifold- ness of this universe, unto them belongs Eternal Truth unto none else, unto none else!'\" 16"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"DoMr worry ...

Another line of investigation, by such physicists as Dr. Nick Herbert, Dr. Jack Sarfatti and Saul Paul Sirag, suggests a similar continuity between the sub-microscopic quantum jumping of the inner-atomic world and \"macroscopic quan- tum behavior\" of living systems e.g. the rhythmic staccato of crickets' chirping, the migratory habits of various species, the mutational cycles of insects and of nervous systems, etc. In all of these periodicities we see structure as a basic fact not in space but in space-time. 18"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"KArxx \"tf 15 THIS AN ARTHUR MUfcf^Y TFCODS QS TFDQB OOP TO7DQDCDC1 \\SE im YEAH // High Loose Always on the Make BORON FAMILY EARTH METALS Down to Earth Stable ALKALI METALS Violent Tendencies Irrational 19"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"DARWIN: DARWIN-NAMED AS DNA HITMAN THE GAME OF LIFE HAS BEEN DECODED SLOWLY, SERENDIPITOUSLY AND MOSTLY BY PERSONS UNAWARE OF WHAT THEY WERE SAYING While Mendeleyev was bringing order into the busy, buzzing world of molecular metamorphoses, a shy, timid hypochondriac, biased by a dozen varieties of racism, sexism and monotheistic chauvinism but gifted with a 21st century-model brain by name Charles Darwin was performing a like service for the bloody, brawling world of animal life.

Most of the great Victorian poets used opiates and their verse is haunted with the same vegetative death-rebirth- metamorphoses imagery, the same Gothic horror, that Darwin organized so brilliantly and painstakingly into the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. Charles Darwin was also an obsessively dedicated scientist, a hard worker of heroic endurance. It is recorded that when dissatisfied with some details in his interpretation of barnacle evolution, he laid aside all other work and remorselessly concentrated on barnacles for nearly seven years.

IS THE TAROT A GENERAL, DIRECTION SUMMARY OF THE NEUROGENETIC CODE? The genetic code is an amino-acid blueprint which preprograms the course of evo- lution. The DNA of any living creature carries the design of all the preceding forms and the forms to come. Each human being starts as a one-celled organism (at the moment of conception) and recapitulates the earlier forms of evolution during the embryonic period (gills, etc.). Recent evidence suggests that part of the DNA code is blocked by chemical masks called histones. According to Paul of Glasgow, the half of the DNA code blocked by histones may be the future-blueprinting sections of the code which are not to be manifested until later stages of evolution. The most recent summary of what is perhaps the most important area of con- temporary scientific research the suppression and activation of genetic informa- tionwas published in the February 1975 issue of Scientific American. The title of this monumental article is: Chromosomal Proteins and Gene Regulation. The authors are Gary S. Stein, Janet Swinehart Stein and Lewis J. Kleinsmith.

The article begins with a concise summary of the situation: \"As is now well known, the genes, which transmit the hereditary information from one generation to the next and direct the function of every living cell, are made of DNA. In the cells of higher organisms, however, the genes are arranged on chromo- somes, and chromosomes and nucleoproteins: complexes of nucleic acids and pro- teins. If the DNA is the genetic material, what is the function of the chromosomal proteins? Apparently they play a major role in maintaining the structure of the genetic material and in regulating the activity of the genes, that is, in determining which genes in each cell are turned on, and when. The control of genes is central to such fundamental processes as differentiation, embryonic development and hormone action, and to such abnormal processes as cancer, metabolic diseases and those birth defects that are related to the expression of genetic information.\" \"Gene Regulation A cell's genetic information is encoded in the sequences of nucleotides that constitute its DNA. To utilize this information the cell transcribes nucleotide sequences into the complementary strands of RNA that are translated into chains of amino acids to form proteins. The control of gene activity resides in the selectivity of transcription in both time and place.\" . . . \"The Histones . . . Histones [chromosomal proteins] ... are regulatory molecules involved in the con- trol of gene transcription, but they must be regulatory in a nonspecific sense.\" Whereas histone proteins seem to be fixed parts of the chromosomal structure, the nonhistone proteins seem to be in a \"dynamic flux\" and there is strong evidence that they are involved in modifying genes in very specific ways: \"Nonhistone Proteins . . . . . . Certainly the histone and nonhistone proteins play important roles in determin- ing the structural and functional properties of the genome. Where histones are involved in the maintenance of chromatin structure and in the nonspecific repres- sion of genetic sequences, nonhistone chromosomal proteins appear to recognize defined gene loci and thereby regulate the transcription of specific genetic informa- tion. It may not be long before proteins that regulate the expression of specific genes are isolated, introducing the possibility of a certain kind of genetic engineering: the proteins might be inserted into cells in order to modify abnormalities in gene tran- scription associated with development, differentiation and a broad spectrum of diseases, including cancer.\"6 25"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"FUTURE IS CODED IN DNA Even the restrained scholarly prose of these sober scientists resonates with the staggering genetic implications of the \"turn-on\" role of nonhistone proteins.

The general trend is clear the more elec- trons in the outer shell, the more likely the element is to be escaping from the Earth's gravity.

The mind controls the physical activity of the brain. Disease originates in intellectual processes. Stress has its effects on health be- cause the rational mind confronts situations (especially social situations) with which it cannot cope. Human beings have evolved new, sophisticated senses; one is an unconscious sense of order in which we anticipate the sequence of natural events and move from chaos toward unity. Will is an independent function of mind. Human beings have evolved elaborate mechanisms to ensure survival in an evolving psychological as well as physical environment. The highest-order intellectual capacities elegant and sophisticated reside in what we call the unconscious and may always reside there because they are un- recognized by society. JX THE FOUR LARVAL CIRCUITS OF EVOLUTION ACCORDING TO THE EGYPTIAN ISIS CULT \"... the Egyptian diagram might have to do with the four castes, i.e. man must experience in recurrent form four samples of lives beginning with the most menial. In other words, in crossing the ocean of existence he crosses humanity itself in its main aspects. This diagram, if it has any connection with the repetition of the life, refers to four episodes, each one retraversed seven times, i.e. the same kind of life recurs seven times, and I would take it as meaning recurrence in the same part of time for any episode, or sample of life. Once worked out, once the spiral is accomplished, a new sample of life is begun, and I suppose that this would be in a different part of time.\" 8 Maurice Nicoll, Living Time IT> A SlCiNIM.

HEROIC MEDIC DESTROYED BY HIVE ORTHODOXY Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis The additional twenty-two Tarot cards we have been examining are called the major arcana or Trumps. Each trump card carries a number, a symbolic picture, a personal title, and a library of textual-occult speculation. Let each trump card represent a stage in the DNA blueprint of evolution. The origin and evolution of the Tarot deck is \"an enigma wrapped in a mystery.\" The Tarot possesses such poetic suggest iveness, deliberate obscurity and startling flickers of profound philosophical significance that it has repeatedly inspired larval neophobia and the Semmelweis Reflex.* It has often been proscribed by orthodox priests, disappearing into the alchemical underground, surfacing in disguised and vulgar form as playing cards. Some scholars believe that the Tarot evolved from the Egyptian mystery cults. The present form of the symbol code dates to the fourteenth century which accounts for the haunting but confusing medieval flavor. SEMMELWEIS REFLEX. Mob behavior found among primates and larval homlnids on undeveloped planets, in which a discovery of important scientific fact is punished rather than rewarded. Named after Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, pre-Migration Earth physician who discovered the cause of puerperal fever, a now-obsolete disease which, in Semmelweis's primitive era, yearly killed a vast number of women in childbirth. Semmelweis was fired from his hospital, expelled from his medical society, denounced and ridiculed widely, reduced to abject poverty and finally died in a madhouse. The Semmelweis Reflex is ubiquitous among larval Euclidean civilizations and visitors to primitive planets should take at least one semester of mammalian psychology in advance to avoid any accidental offense to local superstition.

The use of the Tarot for personal divination is a superficial vulgar- ization which has led to an enormous literature of poetic, romantic, mundane, ortho- dox piety. The original precise time-script has been corrupted to a text for larval- parochial morality and cloudy sermonizing. Exo-psychology assumes (on the basis of both logic and suggestive scientific evidence) that Life is of extra-terrestrial origin, is seeded on this planet and is pre- programmed to pass through four cycles (12 stages) of embryonic neurological de- velopment, eventually metamorphosizing via emigration from the womb-planet through four cycles (12 stages) of post-terrestrial evolution. Just as the DNA of the pollywog contains the future form of the frog, so does the human DNA contain the forms of future post-terrestrial evolution. We call the Tarot a Neurogenetic script because the numerical sequence of the cards seems to describe the past twelve metamorphic stages of human evolution and to spell out quite specifically ten (really twelve) later phases involved in extra- terrestrial migration.

But surely this is a futile misuse of the script. Let us suppose that we introduce the Einsteinian equation, E = MC2 to a Newtonian human, explain- ing that the basic relativistic nature of energy, matter and time is therein revealed. And the response of the larval hive-member human is: \"Can Einstein's equation tell me if I'm going to be rich or when I'll get my release date from the parole board?\" The answer might be: \"Well, this equation predicts nuclear energy, gravitational field-force, time- dilation allowing us to live for billions of Earth-years, fusion-propelled starships, etc.\" The equation possibly can apply to your problems of hive adaptation (if you really understand it), but to understand it you have to have a post-hive nervous system which automatically makes your larval problems less significant, etc.* Shuffling and dealing the Tarot cards is like scrambling and re-arranging by chance the numbered elements in the Periodic Table of Elements. OK, you deal out the element cards and find that Carbon initiates you, Iridium crosses you, Cadmium is beneath you, Strontium is behind you, Titanium is before you, Germanium is your hopes and fears and Radium is what will come! Synchronicity and telekinesis probably exist, particularly when one is dealing with neurophysical symbols. Fortune telling by shuffling chemical element cards could be as effective as any other divinatory method particularly if it leads the Querent to think of Hir life situations in terms of molecules, electron shells, quantum leaps, migration across zones, magnetic charges, hive-castes, swarming pressures, etc. Divination using the Tarot can be a useful Psy-Phy meditation technique but the significance of the prediction is only as effective as one's understanding of the scientific neurogenetic meaning of the cards. If the cards are interpreted in a simple system of good-for-me- bad-for-me then one can only be resigned to living out ethical dramatics and hive soap operas. 'Writers on the Tarot who have had genuine initiation into societies of \"Adepts\" (practitioners of primitive neuro-programming systems) always stress the \"spiritual lessons\" in the design of the deck and play down the role of ESP.

Eschatological-Neuro-atomic (Control of Quantum Mechanics) This theory is based on the evolution of the eight-circuit nervous system through twenty-four metamorphic stages, each of increasing mobility. Why twenty-four? Because each of the eight neural circuits has three sequential functions: reception of signals; dendritic, the Siva function integration of signals (intelligence); cell-body, the Brahma function transmission of signals; axonic, the Vishnu function These three functions are based on the structure of the synapse itself. To quote from Dr. Herrick's Introduction to Neurology, \"The structure of the simple reflex circuit [may be illustrated as follows] . . . The receptor (R) may be a simple terminal expansion of the sensory nerve-fibre or a very complex sense organ. The effector may be a muscle or a gland.\" In any case, the receptor must first receive a signal, the nucleus must then integrate the signal and the effector (E) must then transmit the signal onward to whatever nerves, muscles, glands, etc. may be appropriate. 46"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The basic trinity of Hinduism symbolizing the receptive, integrative and transmitting functions of the neuron (RECEPTION) SHIVA NUCLEUS (INTEGRATION) BRAHMA (TRANSMISSION) VISHNU As Herrick notes, \"A simple reflex act involving the use of so elementary a mechanism as has just been described is probably never performed by an adult vertebrate.\" Instead, chains and networks of such reflex-arcs are activated. \"It must be kept in mind that in higher vertebrates all parts of the nervous system are bound together by connecting tracts (intemuncial pathways). . . . These manifold connect- ions are so elaborate that every part of the nervous system is in nervous connection with every other part.\" 9 But at each level of complexity, this three-beat pattern remains: reception, integration, transmission (or action). The Chinese describe the dogmas of Lao-tse, Buddha and Confucius as the Three Teachings. It is easy to discern the three neural functions in this oriental trinity: Lao-tse re-presents the passive, self-indulgent, unattached dendritic aspect of the teaching. Siva. Buddha integrating, comparing, seeking the Middle Path reasoning re-presents the neural cell-body. Brahma. Confucius re-presents the axonic stage of the neural impulse concerned with social fusion, external connections, interpersonal linkages. Vishnu. In contrast to the Newtonian rigidity of the Judaic doctrine which was to take possession of the Western world, the three Chinese teachings are seen to be primitive Einsteinian. They are personal, relativistic, tolerant doctrines. They are doctrines of a Way, a Path, a genetic Nobility. In short they are evolutionary. They avoid the dogmatic Newtonian commitment to one-church, one-static-truth, one ritual and are perfectly in tune with the neurological structure of reality. As pointed out by H.G. Wells, \"This attitude is flatly antagonistic to the state of mind that was growing up in the Jewish communities of Judea, Egypt, and Babylonia, in which the thought of the one God was first and foremost. Neither Gautama nor Lao-tse nor Confuscius had any inkling of this idea of a jealous God, a God who would have 'none other Gods,' a God of terrible Truth, who would not tolerate . . . any trifling with the stern unity of things.\" 47"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Dendrite St> t you see t th& pe^jp/C/t^' \\* RECEPTION The first stage of each circuit unfolds after migration, after rejection of adulthood.

The First Circuit infant, for example, does not receive the kinasetheic signals which are the input of the Second muscular-dominance circuit. At puberty, the post-adolescent becomes aware of myriad sexy signals (invitations to sperm-egg transfer) to which the Three Brained child is blind.

The equation of Zodiac and Tarot presented in later issue of this journal will clarify these issues. Since there are eight circuits designed for the eight ecological niches (mediating eight technologies) and since each circuit has three phases, defined anatomically and functionally, we are logically led to define 24 stages of neurogenetic evolution. The destiny of the species is to evolve through these 24 stages. History and current obser- vation suggest that species and individuals tend to emphasize one metamorphic stage. Within certain advanced species, where division of labor is used for gene survival, genetic templating has designed a range of subspecies or castes. The DNA, for example, programs certain species of the Class hymenoptera (ants, bees) to produce digger, guard, nurse, worker, warrior, drone, winged-sexual, and queen types. It is similar with human beings. The DNA produces twelve human types to keep the human hive colonies going, to play the twelve roles necessary for terrestrial evolution. The human hive needs passive receivers, active transmitters and synthesizers twelve larval human types to keep the gene-pool moving through time. Although each species and each individual humant moves through the stages, each species and each individual is wired to perform a special hive function. Assume that DNA also is designed to produce twelve post-larval human types necessary to keep the chain of post-terrestrial-hive evolution going in the future. There is apparently a similarity between the position of a slot in the terrestrial array (first twelve) and the same relative positions in the post-terrestrial array. The Pisces-Fool (Stage 1) is the mundane form of the post-hive Floating WoMan (Stage 13). The Taurus-Empress (Stage 3) is the mundane form of the new-hive Tantra-Temperence slot (Stage 15), etc. The point is this: The same caste functions are needed to keep the new hive going at the next level of reality, i.e., ecological niche. Neurological con-telligence means, among other things, freeing one's self from the old-hive genetic template, i.e., metamorphizing beyond one's mundane zodiac role. AND moving through the post-hive sequence to find the same caste-slot in the new hive.

SUMMARY In summary, Interstellar Neurogenetic theory suggests that: 1. Planet Earth is one of many million (or billion) life-inhabited planets in the local galaxy. 2. Life is routinely seeded (directed panspermia) on planets like Earth by Bio-genetic Intelligence by means of amino-acid templates which contain the pre-programmed blue-print of the multi-billion year larval planetary cycle. The planet is a womb, a hatchery. When life has evolved through 12 embryonic stages it leaves the planet and assumes self-actualized existence in the galaxy fabricating H.O.M.E.s, High Orbital Mini-Earths. The unit of life is the gene-pool. In advanced species social insects, humants the genetic unit is the hive. The key factor of evolution is the formation of new hives by the fusion of self-actualized winged elite out-castes who migrate from the old hive, into a new ecological niche. 3. The nervous system meta-morphizes through 24 stages (8 ecological niches). 1 . In water 2. On land 3. In artifact shelters (tribal) 4. In cities (insectoid) 5. In Hedonests fabricated by self-actualized bodies 6. In H.O.M.E.s fabricated by self-controlled brains 7. In self-fabricated DNA hives 8. In quantum-gravitational fields 4. The first four circuits of the nervous system (which have unfolded over the last three billion years) are larval, gravity-bound and designed for survival in the 4 niches of the placental planet. These neural circuits fabricate realities and mediate adaptation to the four directional attitudes of planetary life: 1. the ventral attitude, facing forward to accomplish bio-survival linkage in water. 2. the attitude of rising up vertically on land to the appropriate survival posture of dominance-submission, approach-avoidance. 3. three-dimensional attitude; precise manual-laryngeal manipulation of artifacts and manufacture of symbols facilitated by the dominance of the left cerebral hemisphere. 4. the in-out attitude; the development of sociosexual behavior (sexual impersonation) which manages sperm-egg transfer and the subsequent hive domestication roles necessary to protect the young. 60 HEY/- THIS NEW fcOOIC,' N LIFECLOUD\"BY riDYL WlCtfRAMA&WGHE SKVS TV\\ il\\ML THlNG //"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"DIRECTED PANSPERMIA . . . \"COULD LIFE HAVE STARTED ON EARTH RESULT OF INFECTION BY MICROORGANISMS SENT HERE DELIBERATELY .

Photos Reveal They Are 12 Basic Normal Terrestrial Castes The numerical order of the primitive Tarot cards presents a consistent directional trend. The twelve lower numbered cards portray the vicissitudes and adaptations of terrestrial hive survival. The higher number cards (12-21) portray extra-planetary hive stages. This trend in the Tarot matches the Neurogenetic theory which holds that evolution moves humanity from the Earth directly toward interstellar life. We recognize, also, that this mythic evolutionary direction has been crudely dramatized by all the larval human religions which teach that Humanity struggles on Earth for survival; then leaves for an extra-terrestrial existence. Heaven is the Hive in the Sky. The same trend, interestingly enough, is found in the ancient Chinese Yin- Yang philosophy especially as systematized in the I Ching. The two polar factors of the Taoist Book of Changes are Earth and Heaven. Eight elemental energies are defined. A Neurogenetic transformation of the I Ching will be found in The Game of Life, Vol. III. It has been mentioned earlier that ancient neurogenetic scripts should harmonize with the energy formulae and the theoretical models of science. So we are not surprised to find that the Mendeleyev Periodic Table of Elements follows the same directional trend. The Periodic Table divides the elements into eight \"families\" based upon atomic weight and number of electrons in the outer shell. The alkali and earth metals have lower numbers of outer electrons; the gases have higher numbers. Again we see the movement from earth to air. Considering the directional trend of increasing atomic weights (sometimes described as the curve of binding energy and the temporal hierarchy of matter) we find trends (increased radio-activity, instability) which may have neurophysical and neurogenetic meanings beyond the scope of this rudimentary transmission. 63"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"LAST TEN TAROT CARDS PORTRAY POST-TERRESTIAL REALITIES The Post-Larval, Extra-Terrestrial Cards Hanging Man; portrays a man floating serenely upside down in a zero gravity atmosphere Death; a skeleton riding a giant horse Temperance; an enormous winged angel; solar explosions in background Devil; a mythical winged creature Tower; lightening bolt fissioning a tower; two giant, stylized figures floating through the air The Star; an enormous red star, seven smaller stars and the naked figure of a woman The Moon; lunar landscape with stylized moon reflecting light The Sun; giant sun over a baby riding a horse Last Judgement; enormous figure of winged extra-terrestrial blowing horn; tiny naked figures arising from containers World, Universe, Galaxy A brief glance at this list of 10 cards reveals that no natural, terrestrial hive scenes are portrayed.

Answer: Neural signals come in three stages: reception, integration, transmission. Question: Why eight? Answer: The number eight (particularly expressed as 7 plus 1) seems to be involved in the basic equations of energy-matter. Neurogenetic theory looks to atomic physics for explanatory guides. The Periodic Table of Elements is a logical foundation for any model of energy manifestation, even as peripheral as the psychological and sociological. The Periodic Table defines eight (7 plus 1) families of elements. We have pointed out earlier, that the directional tendency of the Periodic Table is, in general outline, similar to the Neurogenetic array. Moving from the earth-metals to the noble gases.* Also: the oldest philosophic text is the I Ching. The Chinese Book of Changes defines eight levels of energy, again moving from earth (yin) to Heaven (yang).

In later years, when he took a second wife while not yet divorced from his first, the czar's reported comment was, \"Mendeleyev has two wives, yes, but I have only one Mendeleyev.\" As Mendeleyev was writing his classic text, Principles of Chemistry, eventually published in 1868, he, like all previous chemists, was frustrated by the absence of any systematization of the enormous body of facts about the behaviors of the different elements. Influenced by cabalist and alchemical theories he began to build up a dossier on each element. Like any good detective or intelligence agent he patiently listed all the evidence about each element on cards, shaped in the oblong form of playing cards. On each card Mendeleyev wrote the numerical properties and personality characteristics of each element seeking the \"periodic,\" repeating order the modus operandi, the hang-outs and partners-in-time. Dimitri discovered a basic rhythm of lateral rows and vertical columns which reflected the physical and chemical correspondences among the families of elements. The fascinating issue was this: Mendeleyev was able to arrange the elements in a tabular order based on symptoms, i.e., external behaviors, without understanding the underlying atomic structure and without realizing that the elements have been and still are evolving, mutating, transmutating in a predictable pattern determined by their species and familial characteristics. As Dimitri arranged the Tarot Table of the Chemical Elements he noted that certain slots in the table were empty. He therefore courageously predicted that the missing elements existed. \"It is possible,\" he said, \"to foretell the properties of still-unknown elements.\" And here we encounter, once again, the message of this book: it is possible to foretell the properties of still-unknown stages of our own evolution as species and as individuals. 70"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"hive thought: police REPRESS TAROT MEANING THE ESSENCE MEANING OF THE TAROT HAS BEEN CONCEALED BY DELIBERATE AND ACCIDENTAL DISTORTIONS The Tarot card deck is an ancient formula of neurogenetic symbols which has been passed down over the centuries.

Occult systems are time-scripts, neurogenetic messages sent across millenia.

The tides of history washing over such records inevitably wash out their meaning. Symbols lose precision, Semantic meanings are outdated. Prosody replaces numerical precision.

We have, for example, designedly incorporated three errors into this script, which will be detected by the receiver who understands the signal. Alchemical codes preceded the cryptograms of modern chemical companies. One of the classic dangers in the transmission of energy-knowledge comes from popularization and vulgar acceptance. As soon as a psychophysical principle becomes hive-orthodox, it is taught in authoritarian, rote fashion, and the experimental meaning, the direct neurological significance is lost.

These element drawings are based upon a revision of the Mendeleyev periodic table of the elements which has been designed by two brilliant 21st-century intelligence agents, Jason Saleeby and Francis Busco. The new arrangement of elements is a double spiral helix! It makes sense, does it not? While it is true that a simple-minded two dimensional table fits nicley in 19th-century books, on the wall of chemistry laboratories and in the square minds of primitive chemists, still we know that the spatial topological relationships among atoms as they evolve and build up in complexity must be at least three dimensional. And the periodicity which Mendeleyev diagrammed in the rows and columns of his table are more accurately expressed as recurring degree points on an expanding spiral. The Saleeby-Busco periodic spiral of the elements will be detailed in the next volume in the Future History Series: How to Joyfully Survive the Collapse of Civilization During the 1960's. Here, we simply call the reader's attention to the fact that every stage of neurogenetic caste development corresponds to a step in the periodic spiral of elements. We thus remind ourselves that the evolution of the individual nervous system is best understood as relating to the addition of electron-protons in evolving elements and that the fusions and connections among humans are best described by the way elements hook up in chemical molecular bonds.

Disinterest in external control or fusion biological, emotional, political, domestic. Ambition, competition, engineer- ing manipulation, have no appeal to compare with the rich visceral life. Disregard for rules, indifference to threats and punishments. The path of least resistance. Privacy. Amoral flexibility. Oral greed. The Fool is self-rewarding, self-indulgent, self-stimulating, self-contained and self-undoing. Crowiey correlates this card with such mythic Jungian archetypes as the \"April Fool\" or spirit of spring in the Frazerian vegetation cults: nature's newborn child, rising again after death (winter). The Holy Ghost, he says, is the Christian equivalent, and Hoor-par-kraat the Egyptian congate. Hoor-par-kraat is usually depicted with finger in mouth, like a newborn, and symbolizes meditation: the yogic hippy drop-out. Parcifal, also mentioned by Crowley, is a special case, in which the mutation to the extra-terrestrial equivalent (Pisces II, Stage 13 Hanging Man) is clearly indicated; Crowley calls him \"the Pure Fool,\" since his unearthly vision can give him many qualities of the prophet, wandering wise man, the Mysterious Stranger who is a Magician, etc. In many traditions, fairy tales and allegories, the king's daughter (symbolizing Gaia, earth wisdom) can only be won by such a Pure Fool, who must be an alien, a vagabond.

Domestication. The wild, selfish, idealistic, barbarian teenager mutates into a prudent, practical, docile, productive young adult. This usually occurs when conception (sperm-egg fusion) occurs. Hormonal, biochemical signals are picked up by RNA and flashed to DNA headquarters. \"Attention; this model has imprinted a sexual-impersonation role. Cool out the wild intoxicated hormonal sexual-invitation display.\" The specific Stage 11 anti-histone proteins peel off the next section of DNA and the Parental Brain (Capricorn) is activated. Typically this dramatic, all-changing metamorphosis occurs at pregnancy. In the normal course, the young woman is automatically, reflexly fertilized. On a population basis, human pregnancy is as routine as the breeding habits of fish or fowl. However thrilling and chancy to the individual fish or trembling feathered bird these pre-designed periods of fertility are totally robotized and predictable on a population basis. 146"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"YOUR DADDY-MOMMY BRAIN IS ADDICTED TO PROTECTION OF THE YOUNGER-WEAKER AND REGAL CONTROL OF YOUR OWN LITTLE BREEDING NICHE Once fertilized the expected changes occur. The physiological metamorphosis- swelling of belly and breasts are obvious. Equally predictable are the behavioral changes. Suddenly the flirty, skirty, saucy, giggling teenybopper is replaced by a sedate, serene, cautious quiescent matron. Clearly a new brain has emerged obsessed with nesting, stability, \"forever-mine\" security. Less obvious are the changes in young males moving from the Tenth to the Eleventh developmental stage. Teenage hormonal hurricanes naturally pile up hormonal debris and testosterone-byproduct pollutions, which, in time, signal DNA that the next stage is ready to be scheduled. The Eleventh Capricorn Brain is activated in the young male when he has selected his sexual-impersonation role and focussed his wild-scanning, ovary-hunting antennae. The sex roles selected are not necessarily parental. Just as adolescent sex-role-scanning can and does range wildly from promiscuity to monkish renunciation, so we move through a wide range of domesticated socio-sexual realities. Many non-parental roles are harnessed together in the domesticated society- nurses, teachers. Indeed, all domesticates are offered and encouraged to play non-parental roles as long as they contribute somehow to the ethos. Virgin celibates like J. Edgar Hoover and Pope Paul are the staunchest supporters of family life. According to the Tarot philosopher de Laurence, The Wheel of Life card portrays seven radii; in the eighteenth century, the ascending and descending animals were really of nondescript character, one of them having a human head. At the summit [of the wheel] was another monster with the body of an indeterminate beast, wings on shoulders and a crown on head.\" The mutational-genetic flavor of the imagery is unmistakable even when transmitted by pre-Darwinian agents. 147"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Wheel of Fortune card is of interest because it compactly summarizes many of the principles of Exo-psychology. The terrestrial-extraterrestrial perspective is illustrated by the circular earth surrounded by clouds. The earth is bisected by four diameters horizontal, vertical and two diagonal, perhaps symbolizing the spatial parameters of Euclidean survival. The four \"S's\" of terrestrial life: Safety, Security, Sanity (hive-acceptance) and Socio-Sexual role. On the circumference of the circle are a snake and two mythological half-man- half-animal creatures all symbolizing, perhaps, the process of evolution and mutation. Four winged creatures float on the extraterrestrial clouds, clearly forecasting the four circuits of post-terrestrial technology: Body, Brain, DNA, Atomic. The book of Ezekial is the classic biblical description of the descent of extra-terrestrial beings to Earth. The astounding technical detail and UFO specificity of the Ezekiel vision has led many to believe in the visitation of Earth by galactic astronauts. Neurogenetics does not require the physical space-ship arrival of alien cosmonauts. There is sufficient evidence to assume that throughout human history, certain pre-evolutes (futants) have been able to decipher their own DNA code and experience futique visions. Higher Intelligence, indeed, did visit this planet four billion years ago in the soft form of miniaturized genetic templates. The process of evolution centers on the beautiful, comic, carefully arranged fusion of sperm-egg, neatly symbolized by the ever-spinning wheel of fortune. D.N. A. coils are the unidentified flying organisms. This element is portrayed as Father- Mother. Yod = He in Cabala: the mysterious YAH buried in YHVH (Yahweh, or Jehovah): in short, the earliest form of the Hebrew God as male-female dyad similar to Shiva-Shakti in the East. In many places, Cabalistic and Hasidic Jews still worship the female component, now called Shekinah, as \"the embodied Glory of Jehovah,\" co-equal with Him, under the guise of conventional patriarchy. On the wedding night, the bride and groom sleep in a special hut with the roof open to the sky, so that Jehovah and Shekinah may \"enter\" them and join in the genetic roulette of the conceptual act. In another sense, the wheel on this card is the Great Wheel of all mystic traditions: Samsara, attachment. The married WoMan is involved in the world, in the eco-systems (economics, ecology from Greek eco, household) and cannot join the yogic or hedonic drop-outs without being accused of irresponsibility (betrayal of the primordial life-functions of Reproduction and Protection). 148"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"LIC HXWGtOiS IE Cm WX OG T^: gj&w:^ FORTINE Mat ^nur Utah GUjtB ularot caro autijort^efi gou to actiuate gour ELEVENTH BRAIN a no experience like a worrying-moralistic parent home-owner ruler of your own cozy niche one Ijour each, oag read the Dear Abby column or FAMILY DAY magazine watch Pat and Debby Boone or the Osmonds on T.V. and figure out why an Osmond got an ulcer at age 12 examine the pleasures that you have received by acting in a self-sacrificing parental -kid-care role imagine getting land in an ideal location and building the ideal house for you and your brood re-experience the feelings of a north-European or English bourgeois breaking out of feudalism to attain land- ownership read the history of the British transition from feudalism to middle class think like Archie Bunker; watch the soaps on T.V. reflect on the omnipotent control and pride of the parent over the house-hold kingdom think W.A.S.P. for an hour \""},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE TAROT CARD JUSTICE POR- TRAYS YOUR DEPENDENT SENIOR- CITIZEN DYING NEURO-TECHNOLOGY CASTE NEUROGENETIC TECHNOLOGICAL STAGE: PHYLOGENETIC STAGE: ONTOGENETIC STAGE: ZODIAC I: ATTITUDE: ROMAN DIVINITY: GREEK DIVINITY: *?

A genetic intelligence test designed to separate the mundane from the awakened. Those who see this card as Death, those who focus on the life-less symbol may be trapped by hive symbols, obsessed with morality, etc. Those who resonate to the vibrant energy of the Stallion- Mare are post-hive sensualists. If a real-life noble horse were to prance into your living room with a Halloween skeleton on his back, would your nervous system react to the dead bones or the live ton of quivering steaming life? Let the skeleton represent the husk, the dry shell of the four retracted larval Minds. Memory Bones. The armor is the L.M. symbolic Ego. The Bishop, symbol of the Hive Establishment, and the Mother and Child, representing the Fourth Circuit Family, express homage to the Resurrected Body.

De Laurence says: \"The veil or mask of life is perpetuated in change, transformation and passage from lower to higher, and this is more fitly represented in the rectified Tarot by one of the apocalyptic visions than by the crude notion of the reaping skeleton.\" The de Laurence cards portray, in the background, the towers, unusual, because they are in no way conventional. They are apparently not designed for habitation or defense. They resemble pylons or launching towers. Between them is a solar-star. The towers framing the sun can be interpreted as symbols of space-ship flight. Extra- terrestrial migration. Upward pointing. \"The natural transit of man to the next stage of his being . . . is . . . one form of his progress, but the exotic and almost unknown entrance, while still in this life, ... is a change in the form of consciousness and the passage into a state to which ordinary death is neither the path nor gate.\" De Laurence thus hints that the new level is a higher form of biological life. He is coming close to seeing that the first step in post- mundane consciousness is into the Body. The notion that the Soma must be turned on, that the path to evolved consciousness and accelerated intelligence lies through the Self-Rewarded Body is taught by certain Hindu, Sufi, Tantrist, Sex-magic and Buddhist schools, but this lesson of Eros and Soma is usually taught indirectly, subtly, because it outrages larval thinking, is anathema to hive-concepts of sin and social irresponsibility. It comes as a great shock to the socialized, hive mind that the first step in neural mutation is via Body consciousness. The world is my body. The first reality is Somatic. The cunning hive morality warns that it is necessary to inhibit sensual-somatic pleasures in order to survive. If you indulge yourself you cannot indulge the hive. The last terrestrial element Card 12, Justice-Virtue solidifies this insectoid repression against fleshly experience. Genetic templating, social imprinting and hive condition- ing mobilize against pleasure feed-back and somatic rapture. The RNA instructions of the first four circuits define Physiological Self-Reward and Rapture as dangerous, helpless, sinister and sinful. The first element in the Fifth Circuit the Reversed Floating-Man Hanging- Serenely prepared us for the break-through revelation. Body as Automobile Time- Ship. All the dimensions, meanings and virtues of hive-life are suspended, reversed in post-terrestrial existence. This is the lesson which the N.A.S.A. bureaucrats and Russian cosmonauts did not learn. The larval materialism of Earth does not work in space. Caterpillar ethics and strategies do not apply to the butterfly reality. The resurrected Body is the post-hive vehicle. The face of the horse merges with the launching tower. Note that the eye of the horse is on the star! In the topology of the three Fifth Circuit cards, the Horse (Stage 14) moves away from the floating passivity of the Hanging Man (Stage 13) and moves toward sensual fusion and linkage of self-actualized mates (Stage 15). We master the body, not for passive receptive rapture, not for yogic raptured detachment but for linkage. Hippie sensuality and Buddhist meditation are delightful, free forms of T.M. (Transcendental Masturbation). The horse carries the banner of life to the fusion of two vessels which replenish each other. This fusion becomes the next Stage 15. 175"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Your Caste 14 Brain Joyously, Skillfully Drives your Aeroto- Mobile Body Here we see Vishnu in the Floating Man pose of the new-born Self-in- dulgent.

The focus of exopsychology is the nervous system as transceiver of energy somatic, neuro-electric, DNA-molecular and SANE (sub-atomic). The basic tension in evolution is between the maintenance of hive survival structures that limit and channel energy and the emergence of post-hive structures which can transceive greater intensities and ranges of energy. The history of philosophy reflects this tension the laryngeal-manual mind attempting to reduce nature to what can be manipulated by the nine-membranes of the throat and the hinged-thumb, and the great Egg Wisdom energy-systems, alchemical, neuro-scientific, organic, psycho-astronomical attempting to describe the direct patterns of raw reality. Stonehenge, the pyramids point human perspective up to the stars. Newton, Planck, Einstein writing the mathematical descriptions of physical energy are caste robots responsible for fabricating futant hives.

The energy does visibly pass from one body to the other when the lovers have activated with a Fifth Circuit neuro-transmitter and arranged their skin-vessels in a tantric posture. The wavy liquid in the card is the aura, the electrical grids which tantric lovers fabricate between their bodies.

Such a synergetic union harmonizes all the neurosomatic energies and makes possible the next step in evolution: Brain Control. By 1979 the production of somatic-electricity between two self-actualized Hedonists was as obvious (and to the uninitiated, as mysterious) as Benjamin Franklin's experimental summoning down of lightening bolts. The experiment can be easily replicated at home by any intelligent scientists. 1) Retire to a comfortable bedroom where there is total privacy. 2) Ingest an adequate amount of a neurosomatic drug. The amount and the name of this neurotransmitter varies from niche-to-niche and from brain to brain. Such drugs have, at times, been called MDA, X.T.C. (New York, 1978). 3) Arrange the two naked bodies in any standard face-to-face tantric attitude- legs intertwined, woman's yoni above man's lingam. 4) The two experimenters then softly stroke each other's bodies for at least an hour. The soft friction of the two aroused skin surfaces then produces an electrical aura. This usually appears first on the hands often seen as filmlike grids between the fingers. Or as loose \"rubber-g love-like\" auras around the fingers. The grids are clearly electromagnetic structures in that objects can be passed through them. But they can be manipulated by moving the electrically-charged finger close to them. The magnetic attraction is often visible as thread-like filaments growing up from the arms. Tiny electric point-flashes are also observed. In some cases these filaments become like the threads emitted from certain marine forms (Portugese men of war, for example) which contain at the ends electrical charges. The charges in this case are pleasurable rather than defensive. The production of such magnetic auras indicates that the neuro-electric circuit (Stage 16) is being activated. 183"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"The classic Tarot nomenclature is designedly wrong in the case of the \"Hanged Man\" and \"Death.\" However, \"Temperance\" is a reasonably accurate vulgarization for this element in the sequence.

In the west, the role of alchemist classically personalizes this Tantric phase. The lesson of alchemy is solve et coagule. Fission and then fusion. The four-brained prudish, hive-bound structure is loosened when the Fifth Circuit is turned on. The body (Stage 13) floats free of terrestrial attachments. Stage 14 establishes personal control, self-reward. Stage 15 links up. The fusion is aesthetic. Merging of self- actualized minds in the Tantric union. The successful alchemists worked in secret male-female pairs; fusing the somatic magnetic polarities. The fact that the energies of the body must be transmitted, fused in erotic-aesthetic union, was the censored, well- hidden secret of European alchemy.

Numerologically, it is significant that these \"ambiot stages\" involve multiples of the number three. Two fused to create the Trinity. The Empress (Stage 3) is the first migration and the first bonding, infant-mother. The Madonna symbol. If this temporal caste imprint is not made properly, some form of deep distrust, alienation, autism or first-circuit schizophrenia results. The Hierophant (Stage 6) is the second Trinity-bonding child with herd or troop. The Man and the Boys hunting together. If this mammalian reality is not imprinted, Second Circuit schizophrenia ensues emotional alienation, the Lee Harvey Oswald, the sociopath, the loser-outlaw who cannot connect with mental linkage. Strength (Stage 9) is the third bonding. Youth-school. In T.S. Eliot's terms, the wedding of Tradition and Individual Talent. The membership in the guild, the academy, the learned body. A framework of successful collaborations which the individual can learn, adopt, adapt, alter, revise, re-create. If a consensual mental reality is not imprinted, Third Circuit schizophrenia occurs mental-ideational insanity. Cultural illiteracy. Parrot-mentality. Inability to think or reason collaboratively, Bizarre private philosophies, lumpen occultism, Know Nothing-ism, bigotries, fanatical sects of quasi-religious or quasi-scientific \"truths,\" certain forms of clinical hebephrenia and paranoia. Justice (Caste 12) represents the fourth bonding. Individual to hive. The good citizen. The docile worker. The key to a successful Stage 12 imprint is egalitarian fusion of the many castes necessary to operate an urban hive. Fair-play and hive unity everyone \"sacrificing\" (to use the word favored by Kennedy, Carter, Mao and all socialist leaders) for the good of the hive. The glue which holds the hive together is this sense of confidence in the unity principle. Note that megalomanic totalitarianism is acceptable, indeed, necessary to run a successful socialist unity. At the same time John F. Kennedy was telling the Ameri- cans to ask what they could do for the hive, the populace was pleased that the First Lady, Jacqueline, was flamboyantly and conspicuously, indulgently pleasing her own aesthetic desires. In a well run totalitarian society the need for aesthetic-hedonic exhibition is recognized when limited to the ruling caste. Fourth Circuit schizophrenia occurs when the hive leaders do not accept the caste-pluralism. When vengeful peasants take over and wish to drag the hive down to the equal itarian level of barnyard brutality e.g. the Soviet Union. Actually, Stage 12 societies can exist only on the western frontier. Eastern populations (now located behind the Iron Curtain) use mass-communication-transportation technologies to impose barbarian (Stage 10) or tribal (Stage 7, 8, 9) savageries on the monolithic hive- structure. 185"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"1 CM OMLW BL GOD if i ACcEi'r VftOt -Ditfiisnrx Tdo FIFTH CIRCUIT SCHIZOPHRENIA IS DIVINE MEGALOMANIA The Tarot card Temperance portrays the fifth bonding.

A fusion of liberated, post-hive individuals who share an amused detachment from hive- uniformity. Attraction to other self -actualized Bodies. If this linkage is not imprinted properly, Fifth Circuit schizophrenia results. Most of the weirdness that passes for \"higher consciousness,\" \"cosmic consciousness,\" \"mystic awakening,\" \"artistic genius,\" is Fifth Circuit alienation. Many post-hive, self-reward people get carried away witti the freedom and selective choice. They become megalomaniac and fail to realize that others are also attaining post-hive Self-Actualization. It is true that to evolve beyond hive-robot hood, one must pass Megalomania 1A (Caste 13) and master Simple Godmanship and Basic Narcissism (Caste 14). But a most perilous leap awaits the Self-Developer. After one has become a Self-Reward Adept it is necessary to realize that, although one is god, it's a pan-theistic universe, that other post-hive reality-creators exist. The Caste 14 artist, exalted in hir ability to create new forms, is the notorious example of Fifth Circuit alienation. The Caste 15 linkage is made by means of the paradoxical God conspiracy-contract. Yes, my body-mind is the only reality I can experience. However, I choose to trustfully believe that other self-actualized post-hivers exist, and by linking my aesthetic divinity, higher levels of con-telligence can be activated. Intelligence must fuse, or incoherence results. Integration-of-signals fails. If each trinity bonding is a new dimension of love, then we have just re-examined the first five varieties of evolving trustful linkage: THE TRINITIES CREATED BY FUSION Caste 3: Passive-infantile love linkage with the Mother (Empress) Caste 6: Admiring-childish love linkage with the Father-Leader (Hierophant) Caste 9: Intellectual love linkage with other engineer minds (Strength) Caste 12: Insectoid love linkage with Hive Authority (Justice) Caste 15: Love-linkage (Tantra) with other post-hive Self-Rewarders (Temperance) In each fusion, the nervous system acts as both receiver and transmitter in the bonding. In each case, neurogenetic resonance occurs. In each case, a new hive is formed, a new social reality, a new model of the universe is created. The political-mammalian nervous system at Caste 6 (Hierophant) wonders why those at Caste 3 (Empress) are not concerned about prestige, popularity, status, power. Simple: the reality of primate communication (Brain 6) does not exist for the amphibian (Brain 3). The rational-digital nervous system of Caste 9 (Strength) wonders why those competitive politicians in Caste 6 (Hierophant) do not attempt to be accurate, objective, responsible, collaborative. Again: the advanced brain has not been activated. Brain 6 is not Brain 9. The domesticated-hive nervous system, Caste 12 (Justice) wonders why those engineer-technocrats in Caste 9 (Strength) are satisfied to solve puzzles and have no concern about hive-morality, social uniformity, social justice, protection of the weak and crippled. Again: the hive bond has not been formed. Brain 9 is not Brain 12. Once more, the aesthetic-somatic nervous system in Caste 15 (Temperance) wonders why those at Caste 12 (Justice) never raise their eyes above earth-society, beyond hive justice to evolve personally. Again, the imprint has not formed.

The individual (and species) discovers that the brain is a relativistic instrument which can be dialed, tuned, focused. This Stage discovers that all reality is composed of electro-magnetic vibrations, patterns of energy. It has been experienced accidentally or naturally by people who in the past have been called mystics (or schizophrenics). Recently this level of consciousness has been attained by several million persons who have experimented with brain-changing drugs. We refer here to the typical LSD experience.

De Laurence has this card signifying \"the Dweller on the Threshold without the Mystic Garden when those are driven forth therefrom who have eaten the power-given fruit.\" When an individual or species evolves to a higher level of energy, the initial reaction is to use the energy for self-definition, self-gratification and to strengthen lower hive circuit programs. Externeural, electronic and atomic energies are used for War, I.T.T. profits, CIA surveillance, political control, electronic hedonism, hucksterism, \"G-rated\" movies and TV programs supportive of hive morality. On the inner side neuro-electric receptivity is used for occult mystification, spiritualism, showman-shaman-mag ic . In 1955 it was capriciously ingenious of Edward Teller, Father of the Hydrogen bomb, to arrange his facial muscles to resemble the Tarot Devil, thus illustrating the \"evil\" use of post-terrestrial energies for hive warfare. This card reminds us that Einsteinian technology and brain reward drugs are now (1978) being mis-used to pacify, tranquilize, \"passify,\" mystify, robotize humanity. The evolutionary function of electronic-atomic energy is to equip humanity for post-terrestrial linkage. To send and receive interstellar signals. To design and propel Time-ships. Telepathy. To build High Orbital Mini-Earths.

Suppose this tram were moving away from that clock on the very beam with which we see what the clock says. Then, of course, the clock would be frozen. I, the tram, this box riding on the beam of light would be fixed in time. Time would have a stop. ... in keeping up with the speed of light I have cut myself off from the passage of time.\" This simple anecdote may be the key to Einstein \"genius.\" He obviously was able to personalize the events he studied; sought to experience his subject matter.

Reception: One group expected humanity to be contacted by Higher Intelli- gence from outer space by means of radio signals or UFO's. 2. Exploration: Another group used government-sponsored unmanned space probes to explore the solar system. 3. Migration: The third group proposed migration from earth with families (gene- pools) a la Noah. A new existence in High Orbital colonies. 1 . The first group with Carl Sagan and Francis Drake as spokesman (both from the Cornell Center for Interplanetary Studies) wished to construct a five-billion dollar radio-wave reception device called Cyclops. The aim was to search the skies for signals from Higher Intelligence. Passive reception. Project Cyclops was a brilliant reflection of neuro-electric passivity, as symbolized by Caste 16. Project staff members would live near the device in a govern- ment-suburb, maintaining conventional hive life-styles while hoping to be contacted by Higher Intelligence! This plan was a more sophisticated version of passive UFO watching. 2. The second external-technological application of post-terrestrial energies involved sending neuro-electronic equipment into space for surveillance-exploration. We cite the examples of un-manned probes of Venus, Mars, Jupiter. And the Russian success in establishing permanent space-stations (Salyut-Soyuz) in High Orbit. 3. The third stage in the post-terrestrial activation of the brain involved a swarming of self-actualized persons in control of their own nervous systems. When this temporal caste appears, it is realized that linkage into new hives is the next genetic step. New personal ecological niches in High Orbital Mini-Earths.

The pervasive belief in astrology is another crude, primitive manifestation of the anticipation of post-terrestrial influence.

There are twelve stages of caterpillar tactics necessary for terrestrial survival. The individual humant does not realize that SHe is slave-wired to play a neurogenetic part in the evolutionary pattern. There is, to be sure, an unconscious, resigned sense of comfortable \"belonging-in-the-predestined-role\" that explains why humants unquest- ioningly plod through their life routines ignorant of meaning and destination. Just as the cow placidly ruminating in the stockyard accepts its role in the energy cycle, so does the Caste 17 scientist unquestioningly link into the hive network. Life on this planet is now (1978) beginning the great transformation from terres- trial to post-terrestrial existence. After three billion years of evolution DNA-directed organisms have produced the escape-velocity to leave the planet. Twelve new neurogenetic types are emerging and beginning to swarm visibly. We recall that during the earlier metamorphic stage when life crawled out of the water to reach terrestrial life there occurred an explosive radiation of many amphibian forms designed by DNA. So today we expect to find a radiation of super-futants, a variety of post-terrestrial castes. Stages 13, 14 and 15 define the three stages of neurosomatic futation the body as Auto-mobile Time-machine evolved beyond mundane pressures. Stages 16, 17 and 18 define the neuro-electronic stages of evolution. Men like Einstein, Teller, von Braun, Ulam, Sagan, Taylor are premature evolutes, unconscious precursors. So are the Science Fiction writers whose neurotransmissions activate the brains of the engineer castes. These scientists manipulate electromagnetic energies which they may or may not experience directly. The Exo-psychologist is fascinated by the personal lives and subjective expressions of these fore-caste \"freaks\" whose futant brains fabricate relativistic realities. Their sex-lives and childhood experiences are surely as important as gossip about movie stars because their genetic templating and their early imprinting experiences provide clues as to how the higher circuits of the nervous system are activated. Einstein did not speak until a late age. Taylor was so shy with his girl-friend that he could not verbalize and was forced to express mating signals by playing radio tunes, electromagnetic sperm-egg attraction! They were \"freak\" futant creatures using Circuit Six frequencies to perform their cute 21st century mating dance. These are valuable clinical clues. We are also interested in the fact that many theoretical physicists are given to mystical tendencies and incoherent, metaphysiological emotional states. \"Nature does not know extinction,\" says Wehnher von Braun, \"all it knows is transformation.

Floating amoebas perform Her errands. So do fast-moving bodies, and high- flying organisms. Every living creature, from a bacterium to an astronaut, is a robot designed, constructed, and programmed by DNA to perform specific functions in the evolving web of life. This Biological Intelligence, which operates like the Egg- Queen in a termite hive, is called Gaia. The Genetic Wis- dom. Egg creativity. For millen- nia pagan prophets understood and attempted to fore-caste the unfolding of evolution along the lines of an intelligent creator. During the past 2,000 years of monotheism humans lost awareness of Gaia Intelligence. Even in 1979 terrestrials ex- plained creation in terms of Superstitious-Fearful Magic (the vengeful Jehovah of the Bible), or in terms of blind accident. Because monotheists did not understand the tactics and goals of the Evolutionary Pro- cess, they naturally assumed that there was no understand- able genetic intelligence. The best that humans could come up with was a primitive male Deity who performed silly mira- cles and remained obsessed with village morals. In the last quarter of the 20th century, advanced primates at- tained control of their own bodies (Circuit V). Then the Neurological Revelation gave advanced-western castes con- trol of their brains (Circuit VI). And, as the millennium end of the 20th century approachs, some humans are attaining understanding of the Gaia Rev- elation, an understanding of the DNA-RNA-CNS machinery.

Great feedback processes in the biosphere were al- ready well known to scien- tists: for instance, the way plants took in carbon dioxide and gave out oxygen as they grew, while animals took in oxygen and gave out carbon dioxide; or how some mic- robes fertilised the soil by 'fixing' nitrogen from the air, while other bacteria returned the nitrogen to the air. Dozens of such cycles were well recognised. But the Gaia hypothesis assigned a much more positive and systematic role to organisms and to their un- conscious knack of keeping things just so. Gaia might always remain more of a metaphor than a scientific hypothesis open to formal tests, yet it was a fruitful source of new interpreta- tions and experiments. The idea became sharper when an American cell bio- logist, Lynn Margulis of Boston University, joined Lovelock in the early 1970s as a votary of Gaia. To Margulis, Lovelock brought the problem of what could be maintaining the 'anomalous' gases in Earth's atmosphere in the presence of oxygen. She was able to offer a long list of micro- organisms that produced hydrogen, methane, am- monia and so on. They did so at a great cost in energy, ultimately derived from the energy of sunlight. In other words, Gaia was working hard to maintain the peculi- arities of the Earth's air. In Lovelock's theory, the air acts like the bloodstream of an animal, bringing essential supplies to all of the Earth's inhabitants and carrying waste products away. Countless numbers of hum- ble and unregarded micro- organisms play their parts in keeping this 'bloodstream' purified and replenished. Gaia's key controls seem to be located in relatively neglected parts of the Earth's surface in marsh- lands, in the mud at the bot- tom of estuaries and in the waters of the continental shelves. Dry land and the wide open oceans are not as important as their large areas might suggest. For ex- ample, the airless conditions in relatively small bogs and enclosed seas have deposited and buried carbon fuels, thereby helping ox- ygen to persist in the at- mosphere of the whole world. Yet the proportion of oxygen in the Earth's at- mosphere does not climb above twenty-one per cent. A student of Lovelock's found out that, should it rise by only a few per cent, vegeta- tion would become so in- flammable that even the tropical forests would burn to ashes. That might be a drastic way of consuming oxygen and restoring the status quo, but Gaia seems to prefer to keep the poten- tially dangerous oxygen within bounds. Just how the trick is done remains to be discovered. 10 233"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Margulis HIGH VELOCITY MALE CHEMIST, LOVELOCK, AND SWAMP ORIENTED FEMALE BIOLOGIST, MARGULIS, COMBINE ON NEW THEORY. Lovelock and Margulis, we must understand, were Evolutionary Agents impersonating scientist- priests in the primitive 20th century. Thus they found it necessary to use merchanist qualifications such as \"unconscious co- operation among living or- ganisms\"; describing Gaia as a \"giant and com- plex system which be- haved almost [our em- phasis] like a living organism.\" Implicit in the Lovelock- Margulis theory is the notion of a biological in- telligence which uses DNA-RNA-sperm-egg selection to activate species in the right space/ time niche to perform the evolutionary function. eW Lovelock Now this collaboration is \"unconscious\" only to those human beings who are dumb enough to in- vent a less intelligent theory of evolution- creation. Once our Caste 20 nervous systems grasp the tactics and goals of evolution then we can planfully and effectively contribute to the Gaia plan. From the vantage of the 21st century we can look back tolerantly and smile at the attempts of Darwin- ians (and Monotheists) to explain evolution. The bar- barous-sperm notion of natural selection of the fit- test can be cumber- somely used to explain most genetic events. We recall that pre-Copernican astronomers could ex- plain stellar-planetary mo- tions in terms of a geo- centric theory by adding more and more complex refinements to their fomulae. The humiliation of heliocentricity had to be warded off by good Christians. When the Copernican theory was accepted then celestial mechanics became sweetly symmetrical. Un- til Einstein. The same is true with the Darwinian theory. It is possible to wrestle with the facts to justify the Ptolemaic \"natural selec- 234 tion\" so dear to the heart of males. But the crush of new data is making this scholastic dance too ridiculous. The Gaia theory simply provides the simplest explanations. The melanization of moths as a result of industrial pollution is a nice example. According to the fight-fuck Darwi- nians, the darkening of trees by soot in northern England caused white moths to be visible and edible. The darker moths survived to copulate and pass on their genes. As pollution controls eliminated the soot, then the dark moths got eaten and the lighter moths sur- vived to copulate. The Gaia intelligence solution seems simpler. When the moth RNA sig- nalled DNA that soot levels were increasing then Gaia turned the melanization dial and selected darker sperm to change the species color- ation. The story of the foxes in France is a classic ex- ample of genetic savvy. Urbanization and popula- tion increase was threatening to wipe out the foxes. When worried naturalists studied the few remaining fox families they made a sur- prising discovery. The average fox litter was eight or nine of which two- thirds were female cubs.

Everyone suddenly began to fuck. We grant that pre-biotic molecules can be formed this way; but the origin issue is still bypassed by the 1979 orthodox theory of catastrophe. How did the self- replicating cycle begin? Hive scientists in the late 20th century also insisted dogmatically that evolution is accidental and catastrophic. All mutations were believed to be caused by copying errors, carbon-smudges which produced genetic mistakes. In the 21st century it became known that a Biological Intelligence determines what happens at the moment of ovulation and sperm selection. This discovery ob- viously assigned the control of evolution to the ovum possessor. To Egg Wisdom. This Gaia concept was clearly out of sync in the macho-imperialistic 19th century and the socialist 20th.

Plants Do It THE SEX LIFE OF PLANTS By Alec Bristow; Holt, Rinehart & Winston; 228 pages; $10 Plants invented sex and deceit. One of the best at both arts is the bee orchid, Ophrys apifera, which has evolved a replica of female bee genitals. The flower opens early, before female bees are around. The eager male flies in and discovers the exact color, texture and scent he is looking for. During the pseudo copulation, the flower's male sex organ attaches a sticky disc to the bee. The female organ of another orchid peels off the pollen-bearing disc and another generation of flowers is on the way. Sex among the flora seems as round-about as it is among the fauna with some important differences. Plants' biggest problem is how to copulate from a distance. Some species depend on wind to carry pollen. Others have evolved Rube Goldberg systems for tricking insects and other organisms into serving as sexual intermediaries. Orchids use a quick-setting glue to attach pollen. Milkweeds shackle visiting insects with sets of clips, the equivalent of leg irons. The arum lily plays a more dangerous game it relies on flower-eating snails. If a snail plays too rough, the lily sprays it with a caustic juice, which can scald it to death. Sexual reproduction evolved in plants, as in animals, to avoid the dangers of inbreeding. Most plants are hermaphro- ditic and capable of self-pollination, but use that process only as a hapless last resort. If no bee comes along, the male organ of the bee orchid withers and droops near the female stigma better self-love than no love at all. Other species have developed stratagems to avoid solo sex. One jujube opens its male and female blossoms at different hours. The sea pink has coarse pollen and smooth stigma in one plant, and smooth pollen and coarse stigma in another. The beauty and fragrance of flowers are byproducts of a complicated sex life. Wind-pollinated species, with no need to dress up for insect visitors, are generally drab. Dazzling blossoms are for bugs, with shallow, wide-petaled plants adapted to primitive species, and deeper flowers with frillier petals luring more sophisticated insects. As in the current spate of books on the animal world, the unstated aim is to take uppity humans down a peg. There seems to be no human sexual problem that shrubs have not suffered for millions of years. A sobering thought, and one to remember the next time you talk with your plants. 13 John Leo , WE /KKRBS vVftTt MIYCHEU 244 wiromg'- tod TiLTHY wja&s W S.O\\/t.TS f=\\fc TDTfvO.H'"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Burbank Named to Genetic Hall Of Fame A well-known example of Stage 20 Consciousness was the experimental horticulturist Luther Burbank. \"During his fifty-year-long working life, Bur- bank created more than 800 new strains, varieties, and species of plants most of them useful In his own day he was called 'the wizard of horticulture' and he remains the on- ly horticulturist in history whose name was recognized all over the world.

Darwinians are male chauvinist prigs. We can understand and sympathize with their problem. It was their exciting duty to introduce scientific evidence which changed the orthodox cosmology of the times. For two thousand years the Judeo-Christian hive-collective had brutally imposed a barbarous theory of creation. (The cosmology held by a hive, i.e. its theory of creation is the basic structure which unifies and organizes the Egg Collective.) To link-up and manage the large multi-tribe collectives necessary to produce an industrial society it was necessary to impose monotheism. Thus a simple-minded, crude shepherd Jewish tribe divinity was evaluated to cosmic importance. The peevish, suspicious, macho paranoid Jehovah exhibited all the characteristics of a male-monotheist-mono- maniac god: hatred of woman, frantic controlitis, jealous territorial possess iveness, intolerance of diversity. The Judeo-Christian model was organized to oppose the Egg-Wisdom of the tribal matriarchies. A Gaia Mother Goddess loves all Her creatures equally and playfully produces new off-spring designed to stimulate and change the older. Egg-Wisdom is the Pantheistic wisdom of change and diversity. The Darwinians were obsessed with and paralyzed by the Male-Mono-manic divinity. Like Freud, Darwin was robot-wired to replace the Father with the new Socialist-Brother Cosmology- Science. But Darwin and Freud were too timid to burst out of the hive and allow an untidy Egg-Pluralism. So they replaced the Bible with another Male Model grim chance, natural selection, struggle for existence, survival of the fittest.

The Conquering barbarians of antiquity typically slew the conquered males and swept off the nubile female captives.

In caste system societies (probably the most numerous in world history) custom usually prescribes that female children \"marry-up\" in status or caste.

Among the many futant achievements of the Nazi-cult were: Nazi sponsorship of the first post-terrestrial rockets, the weirdo theories of Hollow Earth which correctly antici- pated post-terrestrial existence within H.O.M.Es. Hitler's use of electronics to link all of Europe in an electromag- netic web. the Nazi incorporation of Bud- dhist, Tibetan, Sufi fore-caste knowledge as basis for their po- litical philosophies; an obvious unfair advantage over countries using stage 11 Judeo-Christian monarchist hive-tactics.

(The fact that Hitler was a male-macho-mili- taristic-murderer is, of course, taken for granted by those who understand DNA's tactics.) The in- itial time-probes into the hard-ware future are always exploitive- paranoid; weird (dare we say sin- ful) attempts to use future knowledge to control the present- past. The horror of Hitler was that 254 he posessed a 21st century brain imprinted by the militaristic German-hive and conditioned by lower-class middle-European nastiness. He thus became a totalitarian-megalomaniac perfor- ming exactly the tasks that DNA required at the moment. Self- confident brains like Hitler's will become the Dom-Species in a few decades.

The simple and scandalous fact is this: Genetics is based on sexual interaction and erotic attraction. One cannot understand the tactics and strategies of DNA until one understands the complexities of sperm-egg intercourse within and between species especially between flowering plants and winged animals. During the last quarter of the 20th century the great symbolic linkage of the Flower Kingdom with the Primate Species was initiated. A neotenous generation along the futique frontier was INFECTED by neuro-active chemicals manufactured and transmitted by plants. These molecular signals from the vegetable kingdom were precisely tailored to activate the neurogenetic circuits of the brains of the lumbering mammalian hosts. The most widely used botanicals used to contaminate and alter human brain structure were: $&-> opium derivatives from the poppy peyote-mescaline W*$J> ^ cannabis LSD from ergot or rye ^y ^~* cocaine psilocybin and other psycho-active fungi. Can it be accidental that wide-spread ingestion of these plant-signals resulted in a global jump in ecological consciousness, organic-food faddism, vegetarianism, and greater respectful awareness of the interdependence between the vegetable and animal kingdoms? By 1979 the American public was spending over 100 billion dollars a year to contaminate-activate their brains with the illegal botanicals just listed. At first this biological invasion by brain-changing plant-signals was passionately resisted by Primate Hive Authorities who recognized that ingestion of neuro- vegetables would have the inevitable effect of making primates experience, think, and fuse with plants. The great genetic contribution of the flowering-plants (and the winged creatures evolved to service them) is aesthetic-erotic, to put it more succinctly: the flowering plants have, for a billion years, specialized in sexual allure, floral and chemical attractiveness, complex structural invitation sacrificing, in this overspecial- ization, the mobility which characterized mammals and especially the technological primates. The plant kingdom for billions of years has employed sexual-aesthetic allure-signals which are precisely tailored to activate the nervous systems of the winged creatures evolved to service them) is aesthetic-erotic. To Dut it most succinctly: information.

The effect seen in high intensity collisions that spin is one of the basic determinants of particle behavior. All the basic levels of particle be- *\\ havior the electron, the self, JL X. the neutron, the singularity, the proton seem to involve spin. Ro- tation is one of the intrinsic properties of the behavior of every particle. Each particle has a fixed angular movement in the same way that it has a character- istic internal structure and magnetic charge. When two spinning particles in- teract, the result depends on how they are spinning. For instance, the path taken by a particle after a meeting can be affected by the entity's self spin just as the \"English\" applied to a pool ball can change the ball's trajectory. It had long been held, however, that the ef- fect of spin should decrease as the in- tensity of inter-particle interaction increases. The thinking behind this hy- pothesis was simple: the energy in- volved in a particle's self spin is con- stant, and thus it should become an ever decreasing fraction of the overall energy as the interaction becomes more intense. According to this Newtonian notion, in very intimate, close, intense interactions of protons it should make no difference whether the two are rotating the same way or in the op- posite direction. Only in the past few decades have neurophysical experiments been de- vised to test this hypothesis. It has been clearly disproven. The effect of self spin does not decrease as the energy of an in- teraction increases. On the contrary, self spin appears to play a more impor- tant role as the interaction becomes more intense. Recent studies of high velocity interactions have shown that particles rotating in the same direction are much more likely to increase their velocity and complexity than particles rotating in opposite directions. Par- ticles with opposite spin usually appear to pass through each other without in- terfacing at all. The meaning of these researches seems clear. One interpretation holds that within the proton there are smaller particles which account for most of the proton's self spin. These internal par- ticles must be rotating very quickly. Some time before these data were pub- lished it had already been suggested that the proton has an internal \"per- sonality\" structure. One theory pro- posed that each proton has a tiny, dense center, a \"brain,\" which directs its movements. A model in vogue today suggests that every proton is composed of three tiny, powerful entities called quarks. There is considerable experien- tial evidence to support the quark model. However, other research has shown that these internal traits have characteristics somewhat at odds with the quark model. Spin seems to be much more important than previously thought. Angular movement (i.e. the atti- tude) of a particle is proportional to its spin velocity and is also affected by the personality structure of its mass. Every entity has two kinds of attitudinal movement: orbital (or planetary) movement, and self spin. Orbital movement was personalized in the planetary model of the atom proposed by Neils Bohr in 1909 and the planetary migration-momentum model of hu- man behavior suggested in 1979 by Timothy Leary. The planetary angular movement of an electron in a Bohr- Leary model is proportional to the speed with which it rotates around its center (i.e. the earth) and its altitude (the radius of its orbit) and to its inter- nal personality characteristics, i.e. mass. Orbital angular movement also appears in any brief encounter between entities. Even if the entitites never en- circle each other they still momentarily spin around their mutual center of gravity. Spin angular movement calibrates the movement of a single entity around its own internal center (self) . In quan- tum mechanics as in neurologic and exo-psychology, self spin is very dif- ferent from orbital angular movement. An entity can increase or decrease or- bital angular movement depending on the attractiveness and comfort of the ecological situation, as when an elec- tron in an atom suddenly migrates from one energy niche to another and thus from one orbit to another. Self spin on the other hand is an enduring trait of each particle. The velocity of the spin can be altered only by changing the imprint of the entity itself. Spin movement is often described as an attitude, a personality posture, which has both a magnitude and a di- rection. The spin attitude can be por- trayed as an arrow parallel to the axis of rotation and with a length representing the intensity of the spin. \"The direc- tion of the arrow is defined by the ar- bitrary convention called the right- hand rule. If the fingers of the right hand are wrapped around the particle in the direction in which it is rotating, then the thumb indicates the direction of the spin vector. According to this convention, the spin angular momen- tum of the earth could be represented by a vector at the North Pole pointing up.\" These two concepts of orbital spin and self spin which revolutionized physics toward the end of the 20th cen- tury helped produce a similar quantum leap in our understanding of human behavior. Each human being was able to diagnose hir own self spin. Fore- spinners interacting with each other along the vector of planetary spin (i.e. the genetic runway) were able to generate the energy to jump into a higher orbit (i.e. migrate). Back- spinners were able to guide those with similar eastern orientation to jump or- bits down. This is the harmony and balance of the planetary atom main- tained. While fore-spinners swarm along the Sunset Strip generating the energy to migrate to higher orbits, back-spinners, in the Middle East, were feverishly jumping down to the Biblical and Koranic orbits."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"The Spin of the Person 7 hen two persons interact, the outcome depends on which way the per- ns are spinning. The effect seen in high intensity collisions suggests 'at spin is one of the basic determinants of human behavior. All the fundamental levels of human Z\\ behavior (the four hive circuits JL JL plus the somatic, neurological, and genetic) seem to involve spin. Rota- tion is one of the intrinsic properties of the behavior of every living organism. Each human being has a fixed angular momentum in the same way that SHe has a definite caste and a bio-electric charge. When two spinning humans inter- act, the outcome often depends on how they are spinning. For example,- the path taken by a human being after a meeting can be affected by the person's spin just as the \"english\" applied to a billiard ball can alter the ball's trajec- tory. It has long been thought, how- ever, that the influence of spin should decline as the energy of the interperson- al interaction increases. The reasoning behind this assumption is simple: the energy associated with a person's spin is constant, and so it becomes an ever smaller fraction of the total energy as the interaction becomes more intense. According to this Newtonian psycholo- gy in very intimate, close, intense re- lationships it should make no difference whether the two people are spinning in the same direction or in opposite direc- tions. Only in the past few years have neurological experiments been devised for testing this assumption. It has turned out quite wrong. The influence of spin does not diminish as the close- ness of a human interaction increases. On the contrary, spin seems to become more important as the relationship be- comes more intense. Recent studies of high-velocity marital-couples has shown that people spinning in the same direc- tion are much more likely to increase their velocity-intelligence than persons spinning in opposite directions. Persons with opposite spin often seem to pass through each other without interfacing at all. An example of a person spinning east (back spinner) is Woody Allen. A prominent west-spinner (fore-spinner) is Thomas Pynchon. Ho hum. There is no evidence that they have influenced each other at all. The authors of this book fore-spinners have been tre- mendously accelerated by Pynchon. TJie west-spinner, having passed through eastern sectors, understands them; the Ayatollah Khomaini does not \"see\" Thomas Pynchon; whereas the Califor- nia writer does understand the past- caste mullah. ferv^A^ou-r At the early stages of development we rotate around the center of the local imprint i.e., the neural reality. Chil- dren before adolescence and human gene-pools before civilization rotate only around the personal neuro-ecology. But when the individual attains adolescent mobility and when the gene-pool has at- tained migratory competence then fixed- spin in relationship to the rotation of the earth becomes the most important ge- netic determinant. A moment's reflection will verify the truth of this astounding fact: Nine- ty-nine percent of all successful human gene-pool migration during the last 2000 years has been East-to-West. Against the spin of the planet. Can you think of one gene-pool which has succeeded by mov- ing eastward? It awaits to be seen whether the Australian migration is a genetic side-alley or whether, some time in the future, intelligent life-signals are emitted from \"down-under.\" When we consider north-south mi- gration we note that there has been less of it. There is no clear vector of human swarm-movement in relationship to the magnetic poles. And those that do exist Europeans to South America, Euro- peans to South Africa and Africans into the northern hemisphere have been no- toriously exploitive, unattractive, consis- tently conflictful and unassimilative. The importance, the exclamation- point intensity of the East-West migra- tion is lost to humans who are still in- volved in the leap. But in terms of ener- gy-scans of this planet the movement along the Genetic Runway from east to west in the last 2000 years qualifies as a quantum -jump. From the placid bullock- fields of Asia to the jet-jammed runway of LAX in one fast flash.

If we define DNA as information and genes as Intelligence Agencies (i.e., having the ability to receive, analyze-store and rhythmically transmit information), then by defini- tion evolution is the Increase in Intelligence. (Intelligence = the gathering, analysis- stroing and times transmission of information.) Evolution is not the survival of the fittest; it is the Increase in Intelligence. Matter is the freezing, i.e., the storing of bits of information. Energy is the move- ment of quanta of information. We have, accordingly, defined the universe as an enormous, totally-efficient information-processing network. A brain. REMEMBER, POST-TERRESTRIALS!

This Scope senses a whole spectrum of energy fields such as elastic vibrations, electro-magnetic waves, gravi- tational field variation, thermal structure, and radioactivity. Its spectral range extends between ICr and 10 - * Terra-meters. Its data synthesizing unit statistically models any intelligible patterns within these energy fields. The modeling is expressed both in time and space by hologramic imagery of symmetry relations and replication patterns. \\ 7 ell, I was just doing this routine recon flight through Terra's lower atmosphere when my IE scope sensed an extreme intelligence anomaly. Much to my surprise, this high Intelligence flux was radiating from a summer camp tucked away in the forest south of Mount Shasta. The Intelligence anomaly was centered over a 100 meter tall monkey bar set that had been built in the form of a giant DNA molecule. The kids were literally climbing up and sliding down the genetic code. The natural resonance of this giant DNA model was bombarding my IE system with highly intelligible energy patterns. This incident reminded me of our earlier conversations about intelligence and the patterning of energy. I thought I'd take this opportunity to tell you about the exciting new play I'm doing along these lines. One of the first really intelligent realizations by Terrestrials was when early alchemists noted the periodic behavior of the chemical elements. They noted that when the chemical elements were arranged by atomic number, there are periodic replications in chemical personality. For instance, Bromine (3r) replicates Chlorine (CI) which replicates Flourine's (F) personality. Each of these three elements are separated by a regular number of unalike elements when laid out by atomic number. Now Terrestrial science has come a long way in explaining this old observation by discovering that the chemical personalities of the elements are controlled by an array patterned energy forms which change continuously with increase in atomic number, but at the same Winter Camp: Box 2421, Tahoe-Truckee, California 95734 (916) 562-1858 Summer Camp: Montgomery Creek, California 96065 (916) 337-6535"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"-2- time periodically replicate lower number forms. This is displayed adequately in the conventional periodic table of the elements where there is stepwise (quantized) change in the form of the electronic energy patterns across the table, and replication of internal forms down the table. Unfortunately, the periodic table does little to appeal directly to the senses about its real message which is the periodic replication of ex- static form. Nor does the periodic table transmit the fact that each form possesses a paired and unpaired spin state, the fundamental expression of satisfaction and dis-satisfaction. In search of a more sensually appealling representational space for the nature of the elements, I was lead into the space of ray own genetic code. Only the double-helix possesses two intimately related perfectly in phase linear functions having periodicity fundamental to their form. Thus, the helix of DNA is the most suitable representa- tional space for the nature of the chemical elements. I am in the process of producing the \"Periodic Helix of the Chemical Elements. \" In my next visit to Terra I will drop in on you with it. To give you a taste of the logic of this representation I've enclosed a copy of the SP Mandala. This mandala is a spin-off of the helical representation. By taking the first two fundamental forms of electrical dance, known to quantum physicists as the S and P electron orbital levels, and by projecting their helical plot along the helix axis the fundamental chemical message of the life supporting elements (those elements whose chemical personalities are controlled by the SP forms) is revealed. Peace. More specific decoding of these chem- ical patterns is shown by the 360 degree periodicity of the S form (Hydrogen- Helium (H-He) to Cesium-Barium (Cs-Ba)) and the division of the P form into 120 degree sublevels. The circular and prong-like shapes given to the individual species are mere two-dimensional repre- sentations of what the electrical dances most likely look like. Each species or form is shown next to its paired or unpaired holomorph. Distance from the origin (H-He) reflects linearly increasing atomic number. As you follow the quantized coil to higher atomic numbers, remember that each basic form is built over the previous forms, and of course you can see the replication in form each 360 degree period. Future transmissions will further unpeal the S and P forms to display their truer nature, and will address the D and F forms which give rise to the transition metals and rare Terra elements. I wish to thank the folks at Earth Camp One for their hospitality and stimulation. My next transmission will be no later than the alignment of the Solar planets which I believe is within the next few Terra orbits about your Sun.
