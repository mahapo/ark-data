The first mysterious suicide was that of Bertran Alex- ander Verey, 68, who tragically shot himself through the head last Thursday. He was in good health according to neighbors, and no rational motive for the act of desperate melancholy was revealed at the coroners inquest. The second victim of this eerie plague of self-destruction was Vere/s sister-in-law, Mrs. Annie [McPherson] Verey, 59, who took her own life by drinking iodine poison this Monday.

Rev. Duncan McPherson, brother to Mrs. Verey, and vice-president of the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth, cut his own throat with a razor. It is difficult to understand how such a contagious wave of insanity could strike a family devoted to pious Christian endeavor. When questioned about this, Inspector Mcintosh told our reporter, \"When you have been a member of the police force for thirty years, you see many bizarre tragedies and learn that literally anybody is capable of literally any- thing/ 7 The country people, however, say that the area where River Ness joins Loch Ness— in which the Verey and Mc- Pherson households are located— has been \"haunted\" for many years now. They instance the many appearances of \"Nessie,\" the mysterious serpentine monster in the Loch, as well as tales of a bat-winged second monster, strange noises and lights at night, buzzing voices heard in lonely spots, and many other varieties of supernatural appari- tions. 'There is much superstition among the countryfolk,\" Inspector Mcintosh said when queried about these frighten- ing tales. Other residents regard the Inspector's skepticism with the strict rule of no wife, no horse, no mustache, always anger and derision. Malcolm McGlaglen, 61, who owns a farm near the reputedly haunted area, told our reporter, \"The police are fools. Every man, woman, and child in these parts calls that land The Devil's Acres' and nobody will go into it after dark. 'Nessie' is the least of our worries. The ungodly sounds at night around there, and the lights in the sky and on the ground, and the monstrous creatures people have seen, are enough to make your hair turn white.\" Another farmer, who asked that his name be withheld from publication, added more grisly details to McGlaglen's macabre tale, saying that his own son had encountered one of the \"monstrous creatures\" two years ago and is still under medical attention. He refused to describe the crea- ture, saying, \"City folk would laugh at us/' Robert McMaster, 43, another farmer, sums up the country people's view, saying, \"We do not need a policeman as"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 5 much as we need a witch-finder/' McMaster claims to have seen a woman without a head walking on the grounds of the Laird of Glen Carig recently. \"Superstition/' says Inspector Mcintosh; but our reporter admits he was glad to be back in the city before night came down on \"The Devil's Acres.\" From the diary of Sir John Babcock, June 25, 1914: What manner of man is he, or what creature in the form of man? True, I have only met him in the flesh two times, but he has been a perpetual presence in my life for these two years now — since I bought that ac- cursed Clouds Without Water and became drawn into the affairs of the Verey family and the horrors at Loch Ness. Even before the blasphemous incident of the inverse cross that drove me out of Aries, he haunted my sleep, appearing in the most grotesque forms in constant nightmares that verged on sheer delirium. That one hideous vision in particular con- tinues to haunt me — he was wearing a turban and seemed some loathsomely obese Demon-Sultan, while all about him danced and piped a crew of insectoid ser- vitors that only a Dori or Goya could depict. Like King Lear, 1 would fain cry out, \"Apothecary, give me something to sweeten my imagination!* 9 But this is not imagination; it is horrid reality. I still recall his last words to me in London: \"Your God and Jesus are dead. Our magick is now stronger, for the Old Ones have returned.\" Sometimes, almost, my faith wavers and I believe him.

It was an announcement of the obvious, but the intent was clearly to open a friendly conversation. \"Ja\" the Russian said in a cold curt tone, clearly uninter- ested in idle chatter. \"No more rain,\" the Englishman agreed amiably, but his polite smile went no farther than his mouth. His eyes were as remote from humanity as a mummy's. The doctor looked at that empty smile for a moment and then tried another direction. \"The Archduke Ferdinand seems to be enjoying a cordial reception on his tour,\" he said. \"Perhaps the Balkan situation will cool down now.\" The Russian made a skeptical noise, not even offering a word this time. \"Politics is all a masquerade,\" the Englishman said with the same polite smile not reaching his vacant, evasive eyes. The Russian ventured a whole sentence. \"There is one key to every masquerade,\" he pronounced with the gfioulish cheerfulness of those who plot apocalypse in a garret, \"and the old Romans knew it: Cui bono?' 9 \" 'Who profits?' \" The Englishman translated the Latin into the German all three were speaking. \"Who else but the Devil?\" he answered rhetorically, giving vent to the kind of unwholesome laugh that makes people move away uncomfortably. The Russian stared at the Englishman for a moment, registering the nervous symptoms the doctor had already 7"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"8 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINAT1 noted. \"The Devil,\" he pronounced firmly, \"is a convenient myth invented by the real malefactors of the world.\" And with that he opened a newspaper and retreated behind it, clearly indicating that any further conversation directed at him would be an invasion of his privacy. The doctor remained cordial. \"Few people these days believe in the Devil,\" he said, thinking privately: Nine out of ten schizophrenics have a Devil obsession, and eight out of ten will produce some variation on that masquerade metaphor. \"Few people these days,\" the Englishman responded with a grin that had grown mechanical and ghastly, \"can see beyond the end of their own nose.\" \"You have reason to know better, eh?\" prodded the doctor. \"Are you an alienist?\" the Englishman asked abruptly. There it is again, the doctor thought: the astonishing in- tuition, or extrasensory perception, these types so often exhibit. \"I am a physician,\" he said carefully, \"and I do treat mental and nervous disorders — but not from the posi- tion of the traditional alienist.\" \"I do not need an alienist,\" the Englishman said bitterly, ignoring the doctor's refusal to accept that label. \"Who said that you did?\" asked the doctor. \"My father was a minister of the gospel. In fact, I am interested merely in why you are so vehemently convinced of the existence of the Devil, in an age when most educated men would agree with the opinion of our cynical companion behind the news- paper there.\" A skeptical sound came from behind the newspaper. \"Have you ever seen a man vanish into thin air, right in front of your eyes?\" the Englishman asked. \"Well, no,\" said the doctor. •Then don't tell me I need an alienist,\" the Englishman said. \"Perhaps the world needs an alienist . . . perhaps God Himself needs an alienist . . . but I know what I've seen.\" \"You've seen a man vanish as in a magic act on the stage?\" the doctor asked gently. \"That is certainly most extraordinary. I can understand why you might fear nobody would believe you.\" \"You are humoring me,\" the Englishman said accusingly. \"I saw it all . . . and I know it . . . the conspiracy that con- trols everything behind the scenes. I had all the evidence,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 9 and then it simply vanished.

The doctor looked at the Russian still in retreat behind the protective newspaper. \"Did you hear the Beethoven concert while you were in Basel7*' he asked cheerfully. \"I have more important business,\" the Russian said in his cold curt tone, turning a page with exaggerated interest in the story he was reading. The doctor gave up. One passenger deranged and the other uncivil: it was going to be a dreary trip, he decided. The Englishman returned with drooping eyes, curled in his corner and was soon asleep. Laudanum, or some other opiate, the doctor diagnosed. An acute anxiety neurosis, at least. Overnight, overnight, overnight, the wheels repeated. The doctor decided to nap a bit himself. He awoke with a start, realizing that the Russian had in- voluntarily grabbed his arm. Then he heard the English- man's voice: \"No ... no ... I won't go into the garden . . . not again . . . Oh, God, Jones, that thing ... the bat wings flapping ... the enormous red eye . . . God help us, Jones . . .\" \"He's totally mad,\" the Russian said. \"An anxiety attack,\" the doctor corrected. \"He's just having a nightmare. . . .\" \"Gar gar gar gar,\" the Englishman went on, almost weeping in his sleep. The Russian released his grip on the doctor's arm, em- barrassed. \"I suppose you see a dozen cases like tills a week,\" he said. \"But I'm not used to such things.\" \"I see them when they're going through these visions wide awake,\" the doctor said. \"They are still human, and they still deserve sympathy.\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"10 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI \"Nobody of his class deserves sympathy,\" the Russian said, returning to his cold curt tone and drawing back into his corner. \"The Invisible College,\" the Englishman mumbled in a silly schizophrenic singsong. \"Now you see it, now you don't . . . into air, into thin air . . .\" \"He's talking about a secret society of the seventeenth century,\" the doctor said, amazed. \"Even Jones,\" the Englishman went on muttering. \"He existed but he didn't exist . . . Oh, God, no . . . not back to the garden . . .\" The outskirts of Zurich began to appear outside the window. The doctor reached forward and touched the English- man's shoulder with careful gentleness. \"It is only a dream,\" he said softly, in the Englishman's own language. \"You can wake now and it will all be over.\" The Englishman's eyes shot open, wide with terror. \"You were having a bad dream,\" the doctor said. \"Just a bad dream . . .\" \"A lot of nonsense,\" the Russian said suddenly, coming out of his aloof coldness. \"You would be wiser to forget all these imaginary demons and fear instead the rising wrath of the working classes.\" \"It wasn't a dream,\" the Englishman said. \"They are still after me . . .\" \"Young man,\" the doctor said urgently, \"whatever you fear is inside your own mind. It is not outside you at all. Please try to understand that.\" \"You fool,\" the Englishman said, \"inside and outside are the same to them. They can enter our minds whenever they will. And they can change the world whenever they will.\" \"They?\" the doctor asked shrewdly. \"The Invisible Col- lege?\" \"The Invisible College is dead,\" the Englishman said. \"The Black Brotherhood has taken over the world.\" \"Ziirich!\" shouted the conductor. \"Last stop! Zurich!\" \"Listen,\" the doctor said. \"If you are going to be in Zurich for a while, come see me, please. I really believe I can help you.\" He handed the Englishman a card. The Russian arose with a skeptical rumble in his throat and left the compartment without a farewell. \"This is my card,\" the doctor repeated. \"Will you come to see me?\""},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 11 \"Yes,\" the Englishman said with that mechanical in- sincere smile again. But after the doctor left he sat there alone staring into space with empty eyes, dropping the card to the floor absently. He had only glanced briefly at the name on it: Dr. Carl Gustav Jung. \"I don't need an alienist,\" he repeated listlessly. \"I need an exorcist.\" IN THE HEART OF THE HELVITIAN METROPOLIS Stately, plump Albert Einstein came from the gloom- domed Lorelei barroom bearing a paleyellow tray on which two mugs of beer stood carefully balanced, erect. Baggy trousers and an old green sweater, their colors dark- shadowed in the candlelit Rathskeller, garbed carelessly his short gnomic frame, yet his black hair was neatly combed, dandyish, and his black mustache jaunty. \"Oolf,\" said Professor Einstein, almost colliding with an- other beer-laden figure in the gloom. James Joyce, gaunt and pale, raised drunken blue eyes to survey with a lean intense look the shadowdark room and the diminutive figure of Einstein approaching. \"Ah,\" he said thoughtfully, too sozzled to articulate further. Einstein deposited the amber tray with care on Joyce's plain unpainted table; but before seating himself he danced three Dionysian steps to the tune of an accordion played by a one-eyed factory worker in the corner. Something al- most girlish in the grace of the dance struck Joyce, who once again said, \"Ah.\" \"Jeem,\" said Einstein, \"why so silent suddenly?\" He seated himself carefully, watchingfeeling for his chair in the candlelit gloom. Seated safely, he at once drank deep dark drafts of the mahogany-hued beer, relishing it. Joyce continued to survey him with pleasant, amoeboid impassiv- ity: a spiflicated Telemachus. \"Are you drunk?\" Einstein demanded. \"An Irishman is not drunk,\" Joyce proclaimed dog- matically, \"until he can fall down three flights of stairs and the coal chute without hurting himself.

The debate between Albert Einstein (Prof. Physik) and James Joyce (Div. Seep.) in the charming old Lorelei Raths- keller on that memorable evening as the Fohn wind began to blow across Zurich covered diverse and most marvelous topics in epistemology, ontology, eschatology, semiotic, neurology, psychology, physiology, relativity, quantum theory, political science, sociology, anthropology, epidemi- ology and (due to Mr. Joyce's unfortunate tendency to dwell upon the unwholesome) more-than-liberal scatology. In epis- temology, Joyce stood foursquare behind Aristotle, the Master Of Those Who Know, but Einstein betrayed a greater allegiance to David Hume, the Master Of Those Who Don't Know; while in ontology, Einstein leaned dangerously close to the ultra-skepticism which he was later to denounce when it was propounded more boldly by Dr. Niels Bohr as the Copenhagen Interpretation (viz: the universe known to us is the product of our brains and instruments and thus one remove from the actual universe), but Joyce, with cavalier disregard for both consistency and common sense, went even beyond the Copenhagen Inter- pretation to ultimate agnosticism, attempting to combine the Aristotelian position that A is A with the non-Aristotelian criticism that A is only A so long as you don't look close enough to see it turning into B. In eschatology, Einstein held stubbornly to the humanist position that science and reason were making the world significantly better for the greater part of the species, Homo Sap., whilst Joyce mor- dantly suggested that all work in progress was always followed by work in regress.

A fine, healthy son.\" 1914] comes out of room into hall. Sir John Babcock was born on November 23, 1886, the only child of Sir James Fenwick Babcock, a once-respected biologist who was then in the process of relegating himself to scientific limbo for advocating the Lamarckian theory of evolution in preference to the Darwinian. The boy's mother was Lady Catherine (Greystoke) Babcock, who is described in surviving diaries and letters as an exceptionally vivacious hostess, a great wit and intelligent advocate of her husband's scientific heresies. Tragically, young Sir John was orphaned in 1897 at the tender age of eleven, both Sir James and Lady Catherine being killed on a voyage to Africa with Lady Catherine's reputedly crazy cousin, Lord Greystoke. The care of the child fell upon an uncle, Dr. Bostick Bentley Babcock, a physician who had pioneered the use of ether for anesthe- sia. It is also recorded that Dr. B. B. Babcock was, unlike his brother, a strict Darwinian, an atheist and a vehement laissez-faire Liberal of the Herbert Spencer philosophy; it was also said by some that as a lifelong bachelor and rationalist Dr. Babcock was the last man in the world to raise an orphan child successfully. Evidently, the good doc- tor privately shared this opinion, for he hired a small army of nannies, tutors, servants and other factotums with which he shielded himself strategically from the problems of a pubescent nephew. When Dr. Babcock himself died, of a sudden heart at- tack on June 16, 1904, young Sir John was eighteen and suf- fering his miserable last term at Eton. The family solicitor explained to him that he was now not only the owner of the 20,000 acres of Babcock Manor, but also the recipient of two inheritances which, as presently invested, allowed him an income for life of 4,000 pounds per year, without his ever having to commit the Un-English Sin of dipping into the Capital. Sir John was a slim and nervous-looking lad, the butt of all student jokes and always described as \"shy,\" \"book- ish\" or \"peculiar\" by his classmates. He himself felt less than totally miserable only when walking alone through the most heavily wooded sections of his 20,000 acres, thinking"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"24 MASKS OF THE ELLUMINATI \"green thoughts in a green shade,\" as the Poet said; there it sometimes seemed to him, especially when twilight was casting cinnamon and gold highlights into the emerald-green branches, that a door to another world would almost swing open and he could faintly discern the quick timid move- ments of dryads and the sulphurous sandalwood scent, be- neath the earth, of vast caverns of trolls. It was at such magic moments that a veil almost seemed to lift, a dim castle to arise in the mist, a trumpet to call to him of realms of romance and glamour, of danger and triumph. q: With what dramatis personae,- furniture and accessories was that magick realm provided? a: Dark and moonless nights, windswept moors, sinister fens, dank and dismal bogs, haunted abbeys, headless spec- ters, wicked witches, wise and inscrutable wizards, high elves [the fairest of the fair], swarthy dwarfs, alchemical furnaces, elixirs, potions, drugs, herbs, precious stones, holy grails, diverse and sundry fire-breathing dragons, subter- ranean dungeons, maltese falcons, lost treasures, knights and paladins in armor of black and white, enigmatic Sara- cens, chaste heroines [blonde], evil seductresses [brunette], longswords, battle-axes, foils, rapiers, decayed parchments barely readable, Hebraic incantations, fumes, perfumes, incenses, pentacles, secret panels leading to hidden rooms, defrocked and malignant monks, dog-faced demons, as- sorted princesses of the blood royal, hands of glory, Egyp- tian philtres, talismans of rare gems, apotropaic spells, were- wolves, vampires, foul servitors of Hecate, barbarous brews, eldritch ointments, black sabbats, elementals, familiars, damsels [fair, virginal, prone to swooning] in distress, di- viners, astrologers, geomancers, bold brave blue-eyed sin- ewy heroes, dank dark mustachioed villains, gnomes, goblins, Men In Black, and infernal nether regions invisible. q: What sort of adventures and challenges had Sir John thus far encountered in actuality? a: Two hundred seventeen attempts by older students to allure, intimidate or coerce him into participation in the Unspeakable Crime against Nature, as forbidden in Holy Writ and the Section 270 of the Revised Penal Code of 1888. q: For what motives did young Sir John refuse to partici- pate in the aforesaid Unspeakable Crime?

Once he caught a field mouse and held it in his hands, staring into its terrified eyes and knowing, with horror, that he could crush out its life with a rock as abruptly and point- lessly as the lives of all the adults he had loved had been crushed. He was frightened in a nakedly metaphysical way, not that such cruel fantasies should occur to him, nor even that something primordial and palaeolithic within himself urged him to do it, commit the deed, know the horrible joy of conscious sin; not any of that, bad as it was, but on- tologically terrified at the knowledge of his own power, the fact that the deed was possible, that life was so fragile and easily terminated. The aromas of rose and clover in his nostrils, the pastel emeralds and turquoises of the trees, the primordial beauty of raw Nature, were all suddenly terrible to him, masks behind which lurked only death and the love of killing. He released the creature — \"wee sleekit cowerin* timorous beastie,\" he quoted to himself — and watched it scamper away, knowing the same dread that the mouse knew, seeing the whole billion-year struggle of pred- ator and prey through Uncle Bentley's Darwinian prism, weeping at last alone the tears he had been too numb and self-conscious to weep at Uncle Bentley's funeral. Feeling thrice orphaned, he wanted to dare the blasphemy of Job's wife; to curse God and die. He never forgot that moment; and once, many months later, when he was asked his favorite lines from Shake- speare, by an instructor aware of his intellectual potential and sorry for his loneliness, Sir John immediately quoted, not the \"To be or not to be\" or \"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow\" soliloquies, but the grim couplet from Lear: As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods: They kill us for their sport. The instructor was so depressed by the despair of Sir John's tone in quoting this that he decided the lad was \"a hopeless case\" and made no further avuncular overtures."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"26 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI But Sir John was also aware that the gods, or the blind impersonal forces of Uncle Bentley's Darwinian universe, had, just as impassively as they murdered his mother and father and uncle, gifted him with an economic security generally considered a great blessing in a world where three- quarters of the population struggled desperately to get enough to eat day to day, and most laborers died, toothless and raggedy, before the age of forty, worn out by toil in those Dark Satanic Mills lamented by Blake. Yet everybody knew that those Mills were necessary to Progress and that the lot of most men and women had been even worse be- fore electricity. Sir John was confused about all this, and even more confused about the universe's intent toward him, if it owned any. While he was in the midst of his most searching philosophical ruminations, the whole world seemed to shudder at once, for Plehve, the Russian Minister of the Interior, was murdered — the latest in a series of senseless and incredible assassinations. The boy heard many older perons talking of the growing violence and lawless- ness of the world; and he heard others, more ominously, speak of a worldwide conspiracy behind these violent at- tacks on government officials. Sir John graduated with honors from Trinity College, Cambridge, five years later, in 1909. The world was shud- dering again, at the assassination of Prince Ito of Japan, and more talk was heard of worldwide conspiracies and secret societies (Zionist, said some; Jesuit, said others), but Sir John heard this only as background noise by now. His mind and heart were not in the world, but in the two scholarly realms known as history and mythology. Sir John refused to accept that distinction, having fallen totally in love with another world so long dead it was powerless to hurt him, unlike the present world, and yet was also rich in mystery and glamour. At this point Sir John read Vril: The Power of the Com- ing Race, by Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton and was mes- merized by its tapestry of adventure, Utopianism, romance, deep occult scholarship and profound knowledge of politi- cal psychology. But most fascinating of all, to Sir John, was the fact that the occult details in the book did not come from sheer fantasy and vulgar folklore, like the thrillers of Bram Stoker, but were derived from obviously genuine knowledge of medieval Cabala and Rosicrucianism. Within next three months he purchased and read with mounting"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 27 excitement all the works of Lord Bulwer-Lytton — Reinzi, The Last Days of Pompeii, all the other novels, the poems, the plays, the essays, even the fairy tales. It was an as- tounding body of literature to have been produced by a man who also edited a monthly magazine, served as a mem- ber of Parliament and became one of Disraeli's principle advisors. And Sir John, even more than the hundreds of thousands of readers who made Bulwer-Lytton one of the most popu- lar novelists of the nineteenth century, was captivated by the question tantalizingly raised again and again in those books: If so much of the occult knowledge was based on real scholarship, might one dare to believe the frequent claim that the Rosy Cross order still existed and com- manded the Vril force that could mutate humanity into superhumanity? q: Under what other names has the Vril been described by diverse persons before and after Lord Bulwer-Lytton? a: Before: ch'i [Chinese, c. 3000 B.C.] prajna [Hindic phil- osophers, c. 1500 B.C.], telesma [H.

Sir John was, by this time, twenty-four years old and ro- mantically, painfully, convinced of a vast temperamental abyss between himself and his contemporaries. He was frankly bored by grubby, money-centered business concerns (he had all the money he could ever possibly want) and re- pelled by the flabbiness of the Anglican clergy — the only church career family tradition could have countenanced and yet so milkwater that, as Trollope said, it interfered neither with a man's politics nor his religion; thus, he seemed to have no future but pedantry.

Worse: he was resolved not to be corrupted by his outlandishly large independence (a word he preferred to \"inheritance\") and could not bear to think of himself as a social butterfly or wastrel. He would write books, then; and if no audience larger than could easily gather in a water closet were ever to read them, that would not matter. He had at least a role if ha had not yet found a soul; he was \"the scholarly one of the Babcocks.\" Sir John had majored in medieval history and Near East- ern languages; his master's thesis, on the influence of Jew- ish Cabala on medieval occult societies, became his first book, The Secret Chiefs, which was favorably reviewed in the few places where it was noticed at all. The most hostile single line in any critique appeared in the University of Edinburgh Historical Journal, and was by Professor Angus McNaughton. It chided Babcock mildly for \"a certain ro- mantic turn of mind which leads the youthful and ardent author to imagine that some of the secret societies dis- cussed might have survived even into our own age of en- lightenment — a thesis that belongs in one of Lord Bulwer- Lytton's romances, not in a work of alleged history.\" Like most young authors, Babcock received every criti- cism as a mortal blow, and it was mortifying to have the novelistic inspiration of his ideas so easily spotted. He wrote three drafts of a long letter to Professor McNaughton for impugning his spotless accuracy; and the third draft, with five pages of relentlessly pedantic footnotes, he actually mailed to the University of Edinburgh Historical Journal. It was printed, with a caustic rebuttal by McNaughton, be- ginning, \"Young Mr. Babcock's sources are, one and all, as impressionable and immature as Mr. Babcock himself,\" and went on to argue that no current groups calling them- selves Freemasons or Rosicrucians had any documented connection with any groups of the same names in medieval times. The group with the single best-documented history, McNaughton said, was the Scottish Rite of Ancient and ptcd Freemasonry, which could not prove any exis- prior to 1723.

There the matter might have ended, in lame anticlimax, had not a mysterious third hand intervened. A Mr. George Cecil Jones of London wrote to Sir John, praising his original letter to the Historical Journal and as- suring him that he was correct in all his theories even though surviving documents of earlier centuries were not complete enough to support him. \"The authentic tradition of Cabalistic Freemasonry,\" Jones added, \"can be found still alive among certain lodges, especially in Bavaria and Paris. There has even been a lodge of true adepts continu- ing the hidden heritage right here in London, in this de- cade.\" Sir John's immediate response was a most cautious letter back to Mr. (George Cecil) Jones, asking very tactfully just how much Mr. Jones actually knew of the surviving lodge of Cabalistic Freemasons in London, who alleged descent from the Invisible College of the Rosy Cross (founded by the Sufi sage, Abramelin of Araby, and passed on by him through Abraham the Jew to Christian Rosenkreuz, who lies buried in the Cave of the Illuminati, which was somewhere in the Alps according to Sir John's research, whatever that Scotch dog McNaughton might say) . The reply, within a week's time, was a cautious letter that invited Sir John to have dinner with Jones sometime when visiting London, so that the matter might be discussed at suitable, length with appropriate intimacy. Sir John wrote back at once that he would be in London the following Thursday. The next week was rainy and wet at Babcock Manor; Sir John didn't go outdoors, and spent most of his time in his library poring over his first editions of Hermetic and Rosi- crucian pamphlets from long ago, and puzzling once again upon the enigmatic writings of those he suspected of being"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"30 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATE part of the underground tradition of Cabalistic magick. He re-read The Alchemical Marriage of Christian Rosy cross, with its strange medley of Christian and Egyptian allegori- cal figures, the Enochian fragments which Dr. John Dee had received from an allegedly superhuman being in the age of Elizabeth I, the sly and cryptic Triumphant Beast of Giordano Bruno, the writings of Bacon and Ludvig Prinn and Paracelsus. Again and again he encountered overt or coded references to that damnably mysterious In- visible College, composed of Illuminated men and women — Secret Chiefs — which allegedly governs all the world be- hind the scenes; and again and again he asked himself if he dared to believe it Sir John dreamed of the meeting with Jones in vivid de- tail no less than three times before the week passed. In each dream, Jones was dressed as a medieval wizard, with pointed hat and robes bearing the Order of Saint George with strange astrological glyphs, and he always led Sir John up a dark hill toward a crumbling Gothic building of in- determinate character midway between abbey and castle. This eldritch edifice was, of course (as Sir John knew even in the dreams), a blend of various illustrations he had seen depicting Chapel Perilous of the Grail legend or the Dark Tower to which Childe Roland came. Inside, according to occult lore, was everything he feared; and yet only by passing this test could he achieve the Rosicrucian goals — the Philosopher's Stone, the Elixir of Life, the Medicine of Metals, True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness. In each case, he awoke with a start of fright as the door of the Chapel was opened for him and he heard within a humming as of a myriad of monstrous bees. Once he dreamed of Dr. John Dee himself, court astrolo- ger to Elizabeth, greatest mathematician of his time, con- stant associate of spirits and angels according to his own claims; and Dee was offering him \"the solace berry,\" a magical fruit that conferred immortality. \"Take ye and eat from the tree Swifty ate,\" Dee said, but the fruit smelled of excrement and was foul to the sight and touch, and when Sir John tried to refuse it, a second figure, female and shockingly naked but with a cow's head, appeared beside Doe, saying solemnly, \"Ignatz never really injures,\" as they were all suddenly standing again at the door of a vast in- sectoid Chapel Perilous.

Even when he was caught up in the bestial tug of these animalistic desires, and the details of certain unmentionable items formed with total and compulsive clarity in his mind, he did not allow himself to linger voluptuously on the fantasy of actually fondling or intimately manipulating those partic- ular items, desirable and monstrous and unspeakable as they were. If it could in truth be said that he did lapse on oc- casion, certainly he resisted successfully nearly all of the time such fantasies arose, and yet the guilt of those few, rare, hardly typical lapses did weigh heavily upon his con- science and seemed now to be a distinct bar against such a bicameral creature as himself entering the precincts of Chapel Perilous. And that was all mythology, anyway: charming to dream about, but one would be mad to get involved with people who believed (or claimed) that they hopped over to Chapel Perilous and back as easily as one might buzz over to the tobacconist. . . . On Wednesday, Sir John could bear the loneliness of sus- penseful indecision no longer. He summoned Dorn, the Babcock gamekeeper, and had a carriage fetched to drive him the three miles to the Greystoke estate, where he paid a casual family visit to his uncle, Viscount Greystoke, a greying but iron-muscled man of seemingly inexhaustible pragmatic wisdom — the richest and least eccentric of all the Babcock-Greystoke families, according to general opin- ion. After the usual small talk, Sir John finally framed his question. \"Do you believe, sir, that there are secret orders or lodges or fraternities that have survived over the centuries, transmitting certain kinds of occult or mystical knowledge which is normally unavailable to the human mind?\" Old Greystoke pondered for about thirty seconds. \"No,\""},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"32 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI he said finally. \"If there were, I would most certainly have heard about it.\" Sir John rode the three miles home in deep thought. Age and Wisdom had spoken, but what was the point of youth if it did not entitle you to disregard Age and Wisdom? The next morning he arose early and took the train to London. Sir John trusted his own scholarship: such lodges did exist, and the only way to test their claims of superior wisdom was to meet with them and find out for oneself what they really had to offer, besides the corrupted Hebraic passwords and absurd hand-grips of other Masonic orders. There was an American newspaper in the railway car- riage: a curiosity in itself, and it was open to a page of comic strips, an art form Sir John had never been able to fathom. He glanced at it idly and found that one sequence involved a malicious mouse named Ignatz who was always throwing bricks at a cat named Krazy. It was totally in- sane, and worse yet, the cat enjoyed being hit with the bricks, sighing contentedly as each missile bounced off her head, \"Li'l dollink, always fetful.\" That was evidently some debased American-Jewish dialect for \"Little darling, al- ways faithful.\" Sir John shuddered. The whole thing was not funny at all; it was a bare-faced exploitation of the perversion named sadism. Or was it masochism? Or was it both? A gloomy omen, in any case. . . . This was entirely typical of the larval mentations of the domesticated hominids of Terra in those primitive ages. Crude sonic signals produced by the laryngeal muscles made up their speech-units which programmed all cortical cogitation into the grid provided by the local grammar, which they naively called logic or common sense. Beneath this typically primate confusion of signals with sources and maps with territories, a great deal of the hominid nervous system was genetically determined, like the closely related chimpanzee nervous system and the more distantly related cow nervous system, and hence operated on auto-pilot. The programs of territoriality, status hierarchy, pack-bonding, etc., functioned mechanically as Evolutionary Relative Successes since they served well enough for the ordinary mammal in ordinary mammalian affairs.

He couldn't even imagine that in his own lifetime a man would fly the Atlantic. Sir John arrived in London before noon, and decided to prepare for the meeting with Jones by spending the after- noon researching old Masonic materials in the British Museum. In an Elizabethan alchemical pamphlet he found, by sheer coincidence, a long allegorical poem that strangely dis- turbed him, considering that he was bent upon contact with alleged manipulators of occult power. One stanza in partic- ular haunted him as he rode by hansom across town to Simpson's Cafe Divan, where he and Jones had agreed to meet. The very clops of the horse's hooves seemed to carry the refrain: Don't believe the human eye In sunlight or in shade The puppet show of sight and sense Is the Devil's Masquerade Passing the Savoy Theatre, Sir John saw that the D'Oyly Carte company was again doing Patience. He remembered, with some cheer, Bunthorne's song: // this young man expresses himself in terms too deep for me, Why what a singularly deep young man this deep young man must be! That mocking jingle was a refreshing breath of skepti- cism and British common sense, Sir John thought.

You couldn't help liking and trusting him. Jones appeared to be about forty, but was free of con- descension toward Sir John's youth; nor was he overtly impressed by Sir John's title. A plain blunt Englishman with a bedrock of sound sense and decency, Sir John con- cluded — and yet it did take him a long time to open up even a little about the Invisible College. \"You must understand, Sir John, that these affairs are circled about with ferocious Oaths of Secrecy and dreadful pledges of silence,\" Jones confided eventually. \"All of that appears quite pointless in this free and enlightened age — pardon my irony — but it is part of the tradition, dating back to the days of the Inquisition, when it was, of course, even more necessary.\" Sir John, with the bluntness of youth, decided to answer this with a somewhat probing question. \"Am I to take it, sir, that you are yourself bound by such an Oath?\" \"Oh, God and Aunt Agnes,\" Jones said, more amused than offended, \"one simply doesn't ask that on a first meet- ing. Consider the patience of the fisherman rather than the rapacity of the journalist if you would open the door to the Arcanum of Arcana.\" And he proceeded to attack his filet mignon with un- abashed vigor, as if that equivocation were not tantamount to an admission. Sir John understood: he was being tested; his exact status on the evolutionary ladder was being es- timated. \"Have you read my book on Cabala?\" he asked next, trying a more circuitous approach. \"Or merely the debate in the Historical Journal?\" \"Oh, I've read your book,\" Jones said. \"Wouldn't have missed it for the world. There is nothing more poignant and gallant, on this planet, than a young man writing pas- sionately about Cabala without any real experience of its mysterit Sir John felt the needleprick in Jones* words, but an- swered merely, \"At that point, I was not concerned with Mial experience, but merely with setting right the his- ical record.\""},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATT 35 \"But now,\" Jones asked, \"you are interested in personal experience?\" .\"Perhaps,\" Sir John said carelessly, feeling Byronic and brave. \"Mostly, I am concerned with proving my thesis that such groups have survived over the centuries — proving it so thoroughly that even that blockheaded mule in Edinburgh will have to admit I'm right!\" Jones nodded. \"Wishing to prove oneself right is the usual motive for scholarship,\" he said mildly. \"But this group I mentioned has no interest in setting the historical record straight, or in advertising themselves. Do y'see, Sir John, that they really don't care what the world at large thinks, or what the pompous asses in the universities think, either? They have entirely different interests.\" Sir John found himself half -believing that he was dining with a member of the same Invisible College that published the first Rosicrucian pamphlets of 1619 and 1623. He pro- ceeded with great delicacy. \"In your letter,\" he said, \"you spoke of this group very carefully in the past tense. I believe your exact words were, 'There has even been a lodge of true adepts continuing the hidden heritage right here in London, in this decade.' How many years, exactly, has it been since the lodge existed?\" \"It broke apart exactly ten years ago, in 1900.\" \"And what was it called?\" \"The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.\" Sir John exhaled deeply and took another sip of wine. \"You are becoming less indirect in your answers,\" he said happily. \"I take that as a good sign. Let me advance to the main point in one step, then. Is it possible that the Order did not entirely break apart a decade ago?\" \"Many things are possible,\" Jones said, lighting a cigar and signaling for more wine. \"Before we go any further, let me show you a simple document which every member of this Order must sign, and swear to, with the most hor- rible Oaths. Just glance it over for a minute, Sir John.\" And he passed from his inner pocket a simple sheet of ordinary letterpaper, typed with a most usual office type- writer. Sir John looked at this strange document with some care. / [fill in name] do solemnly invoke He Whom the Winds Fear, the Supreme Lord of the Universe, by the Mason word {given to candidate before ritual] and"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"36 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI swear that I, as a member of the Body of Christ, from this day forward will seek the Knowledge and Con- versation of Mine Holy Guardian Angel, whereby I may acquire the Secret Knowledge to transcend mere humanity and be one with the Highest Intelligence; and if I ever use this Sacred Knowledge for monetary gain in any manner, or to do harm to any human being, may I be accursed and damned; may my throat be cut, my eyes be burned out and my corpse thrown into the sea; may I be hated and despised by all intellectual beings, both men and angels, throughout all eternity.

You may hear from us in a fortnight or so.\" And the rest of the evening, which was brief, Jones spoke only of his beloved children and his equally beloved occu- pation of industrial chemistry. There was nothing in the slightest occult or extraordinary about him at all. To some extent, he was even dull; and yet Sir John left him feeling vaguely as if he had been taking to one of H. G. Wells' moon-men carefully disguised as a human being, which was nonsense, of course. But what was there about Jones that left that kind of after-impression? On the train home, by the most implausible of coinci- dences — he wasn't even sure he was in the same compart- ment — he again found an American newspaper and, strang- er still, there was that sadistic mouse and the masochistic cat again: \"Lil Jollink, always fetful After four ye training in the Golden Dawn, Sir"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 37 John felt exactly like that bizarre cat, and when Joyce and Einstein offered to help him on Bahnhofstrasse, he giggled inanely and said, \"Li'l dollink, always fetful.\" Preparatory to anything else, Einstein brushed the bulk of the dank barfloor sawdust off Sir John's expensive but now untidy suit and handed him his Bond Street hat and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion, which he very badly needed. Sir John was not exactly wandering mentally (aside from inscrutable remarks in New York Yiddish) but more than a little unsteady physically and upon his expressed desire for coffee or some brainstem stimulant less mind-fogging than whiskey Joyce suggested right off the bat that he, Babcock, accompany him, Joyce, to his (Joyce's) lodgings, just a stone's-throw away from the very spot where they presently stood (or occasionally staggered) on Bahnhofstrasse. This proposal being accepted with alacrity and with much verbose gratitude, the three set off on foot in the hot windswept night since it was con- sidered an improbability verging on the tales of the Brothers Grimm to hope to encounter a carriage for hire at that hour, d propos of which Joyce remarked significantly, \"We have heard the chimes at midnight.\" And Babcock, not wishing to appear illiterate responded, \"Falstaff, is it not?\" \"Yes,\" Joyce said. \"Henry IV, Part One.\" And they both looked at each other anew, finding some mysterious or at least emotionally gratifying bond in a shared acquaintance with the immortal Bard, although only Joyce reflected fur- ther that midnight was very much later to Falstaff in his sunrise-sundown agricultural economy than to himself and Babcock in this industrial age — Babcock being occupied with the more prosaic question of just how late it really was, and if they had actually heard the chimes at midnight, how long ago would that have been? — but neither topic was verbalized aloud at that point, all three men proceeding in silence for a while as they were none of them at exactly what you would call their sparkling best or in their keenest wits, Einstein being uncertain about chimes at midnight and little dollinks, Joyce being fogged over by enough beer to float the local navy if the overly tidy Swiss had a hypothet- ical navy, and Babcock being half-frightened out of his skin, but they did eventually attempt to converse in amiable or at least civil fashion, not at first very successfully inas-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"38 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI much as both Joyce and Babcock were as nervous as a pair of strange sharks being quite aware on each side of the his- torical and temperamental abyss between the Anglo-Saxon and Hibernian mentalities. It was therefore doubly unfor- tunate that Babcock's first attempt to open the door be- tween their worlds was of an almost baboonlike clumsiness. \"As an Irishman, you are of course a mystic,\" Babcock pronounced, thereby putting his foot into his mouth while, as it were, simultaneously stepping for the second time on Joyce's most sensitive corn. \"You know that there are vast invisible forces and intelligences behind the charade of material reality. Do you perhaps know of Yeats?\" \"Yes,\" Joyce said evasively, maneuvering them both to miss a pile of dog shit, which he would most certainly in- clude if he were ever to write this scene, and which Yeats would most certainly exclude. \"Is he not the fellow who is so terrified that the future might be different from the past?\" \"I would not state the case that way,\" Babcock said with a disapproving frown at the flippant and belittling witticism. \"Mr. Yeats is a man who fears that the future will be cold, scientific, materialistic, without the romance and mystery of the past.\" Einstein said nothing. They were now abreast of the FIAT \"automobile,\" and Joyce looked at it and at every part of it with a meticulous curiosity that seemed almost obsessive to Babcock. \"You see more of these every year,\" Joyce said. \"And I read recently that a man in America named Olds is turning them out, and selling them to cus- tomers, at the rate of six thousand and more per annum. How the hell they run is as much a romance and a mystery to me as anything in that fabulous past Mr. Yeats' autobio- graphical hero wishes so fervently to clutch to his bosom.

You hear the most gruesome stories about accidents. Surely God gave us the horse so we wouldn't have to invent such dangerous con- traptions. I shudder to think what the world will be like in ten years when the streets are full of them.\" \"Of course,\" Joyce said, although the logical progression here was totally inscrutable to Babcock, \"if we, like Mr. Yeats, want a really deep, endless, bottomless and topless mystery, we can always try to understand our wives. Or the man next to us on the street, n'est ce pas?\" Babcock meditated on that cynical-sounding notion for a few moments and then became aware that another man was in fact approaching them on the street, a most singular person with a high-domed Shakespearean forehead, ibis eyes of monkeylike Mongolian cruelty and a spadelike black beard. So striking was this figure that, somewhat influenced by Joyce's last remark, Babcock peered after the Slavic stranger as he turned down toward the Limmat River area and then commented aloud, \"I shared a compartment with him on the train. One might indeed find deep mysteries in an individual of that sort.\" \"He seems to have very important business,\" Einstein ventured. \"Damn this wind,\" Joyce said, jabbing the air with his walkingstick as a caduceus. \"The natives call it the witch- wind. Whenever it blows, half of Zurich goes mad. We Northerners feel it more, since we expect a wind to be cold and biting. A hot wind that suffocates you slowly is like an unwanted, unlovely and unbathed paramour in your bed.\" A dog howled suddenly in the distance with an eerie ris- ing cadence like a wolf or coyote. \"You see?\" Joyce said. \"Even the animals go barmy when the Fohn blows.\" \"It is like incense of white sandal,\" Einstein agreed. \"Too thick and heavy to be pleasant.\" \"The local police have records,\" Joyce said in an opal- hush tone, mystically, \"showing that the murder rate always rises when the Fohn blows, and the local alienists say that the number of nervous breakdowns definitely increases. Most sinister and eerie, is it not? Mr. Yeats would say that the undines and water-spirits are attempting to overcome the air-elementals on the astral plane, which makes the material plane so mucking filthy to walk in.\" Like Thoth, he shifted again, adding cynically, \"But it is only a change"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"40 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI in the ionization of the air and can be measured with those heathen scientific instruments Mr. Yeats so dreads.\" But this led them into a full-scale imbroglio which lasted in fact all the way to Joyce's hotel, and in the course of it Joyce learned that Babcock was an ardent admirer not only of the puerile (if elegant) poetry of Mr. William Butler Yeats, but of the detestable (if kindly) Mr. Yeats himself, and was even a member (with Yeats) of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a group of London occultists of which Joyce had long ago formed a decidedly unfavor- able opinion, regarding them in cold fact as being a bit funny in all their heads. Babcock in turn gathered from various sardonic and downright unkind remarks dropped en passant by Joyce that he, Joyce, regarded Yeats (along with the Golden Dawn, Blavatsky and the whole of modern mysticism) with a disdain that seemed, to him, Babcock, to be unwarrantedly venomous. Things began to clear up after a bit, at least in Babcock's muddled mind, when it gradually emerged that Mr. Joyce was also a writer, con- siderably less successful than Yeats, if not virtually unknown, and suspicions concerning the emblematic Sour Grapes and the well-known Green-eyed Monster were almost, but not quite, articulated at this point by Babcock, because only the madman is absolutely sure. \"I take it,\" Babcock said when they were finally arrived at Gasthaus Doeblin, \"that you are a socialist, or an anarch- ist, if not both.\" \"You behold in me a dreadful example of unbridled an- archistic individualism,\" Joyce replied suavely. \"I loathe all nations equally. The State is concentric, but the individual is eccentric. Welcome to the ghastliest house this side of Dublin,\" he added, indicating the sign: gasthaus doeblin (and perversely mistranslating it according to his own dubi- ous whimsy). \"Thank God we're out of that foul wind,\" Einstein said fervently as they crossed a yellow-carpeted lobby bedecked with wallpaper showing palm trees and grinning monkeys. (\"Mine innkeeper hath strange notions of decor,\" Joyce commented sotto voce.) The building seemed to be an octagon, and Joyce led Babcock and Einstein around seven sides of it before arriving at Room 23, which was, he an- nounced, \"complete with breakfast alcove, where I have some of the best Italian espresso coffee this side of Trieste, because I brought it from Trieste.\""},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 41 They were tiptoeing now, Babcock and Einstein imitating Joyce in this, and stopped, once, as Joyce opened slowly and quietly a door to peer briefly into an untidy bedroom where a stoutish, pretty-faced woman was sleeping amid crumpled blankets. \"That would be Mrs. Joyce,\" said Babcock. \"Undoubtedly,\" Joyce retorted, \"but it is Miss Barnacle.\" More than a little taken aback by this frank avowal of barbaric contempt for civilized morals and the canons of elementary decency, Babcock had to remind himself that the arrogant Irishman was, after all, his host and had al- ready exhibited somewhat more than the customary degree of charity to him, a perfect stranger in the first place and one who might sound a bit mad in the second place and beyond that a member of the conquering and therefore probably loathed English race in the third place. But by now they were in the kitchenette alcove and Joyce was mak- ing coffee, after setting the Devil Mask at a dapper angle above the cuckoo clock. \"So,\" Joyce said, \"this goat-faced fellow has pursued you all the way from Loch Ness, you say.\" \"With your opinions,\" Babcock replied, \"you must re- gard all this as fantasy and I daresay you fancy yourself as humoring a lunatic. I remind you, sir, that three people have already died horrible deaths in this accursed affair.\" \"Pursued,\" Einstein inquired softly, \"by the same demon that now pursues you?\" With one probing finger he chucked the Devil Mask under the chin, sharkishly playful. \"A mas- querade with nothing behind the masks?\" \"A devil's masquerade,\" Babcock bitterly replied. This somewhat staggered Joyce, who recalled again the poem he had recollected on Bahnhofstrasse, although he still could not remember the author's name if it were not his favorite ancient bard, Anon of Ibid. Another stanza drifted unbidden up to the surface of his mind: Demons drink from human skulls And souls are up for trade Take wine and drugs and join us in The Devil's Masquerade That kind of damned peculiar coincidence was multiply- ing rapidly tonigjit, Joyce realized (and wondered if Dr. Carl Jung ought to be here to take notes) . Reflecting thus"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"42 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI in silence for a few minutes, the Irish freethinker steeped the coffee and began to absently roll a cigarette, glancing thoughtfully at the English mystic. \"Saint Thomas tells us,\" Joyce said soberly, \"that the Devil has no power to do real injury to those who trust in the Lord, although he may admittedly frighten or discomfit them, to test their faith. In fact, sir, it is rank heresy to claim real harm can occur in such cases, since that implies lack of faith in God's goodness. Ah,\" he interrupted himself, \"I see you are as- tonished that I can speak that language. Well, sir, if I were to believe in any mysticism, it would be that of Thomas, who is logical, coherent and full of cold common sense, and not that of your modern occultists, who are illogical, absurd and full of hot air. But let that pass for the moment.\" He lit his cigarette and pointed at the mask. \"What sort of second-rate, bargain-basement devil is it that needs theatri- cal props to do his dirty business?\" Babcock, who had been growing steadier by the minute, smiled wryly at this sharply pointed sally. \"You miscon- strue me,\" he said. \"I am well aware that there are human beings involved in this terrible affair, but they have powers not ordinarily vouchsafed to mere men, because they serve a being who is not human. You think, evidently, that I am the sort who can be frightened by a mere theatrical prop, as you call it, but I have already faced terrors that you can scarcely conceive. For instance, I would not be frightened merely to see what I saw tonight — a figure with that Satanic face coming at me suddenly out of the dark. What was tru- ly diabolical was that they found me here when I have taken elaborate precautions to cover my tracks and elude them.\" Joyce poured coffee silently, the red-tipped cigarette not looked at in his left hand not feeling it. From Loch Ness to Zurich: to me. The terrors I knew as a child: howls of the damned, pitchforked, baboon-faced demons, flame- garbed figures screaming. Many a civic monster. Ancient Zoroastrian nightmare from which the West is struggling to awaken. \"And how,\" Joyce asked, \"did these three persons come to die?

Seizing the mask, he held it before his own flushed face and leaned menacingly across the table. \"By theatrical props like this?\" his voice asked from behind the mask in sardonic Dublin brogue. \"They were driven to suicide by a book,\" said Sir John, \"a book so vile that it should not exist. Just by looking into this foul piece of literature, all three victims were driven mad by horror and destroyed themselves. It was as if they had learned something that made life on this planet so un- speakably awful to them that they could not bear another instant of consciousness.\" Einstein stared at the young Englishman with something akin to the well-known wild surmise on the emblematic peak in Darien. \"This is something you have really been involved in?\" he asked quietly. \"Not just something you've heard about, a rumor or a yarn?\" \"It's as real as this coffee, this saucer, this table,\" Bab- cock said flatly, indicating all three objects with emphatic gestures while his haunted eyes mutely recalled some dread- ful history of Godless and unspeakable monkey business that might stab anyone in the back at any moment, anytime, anywhere, like the proverbial snake in the grass, if it were not judiciously nipped in the bud by brave and farseeing men taking prompt and prudent corrective action at the psychological moment and striking when the iron is hot. Joyce and Einstein exchanged mute meaningful glances. \"Let me show you what I've been involved in,\" Babcock said, reaching into his straw traveling case. \"This is from the Inverness Express-Journal\" he said, passing over a clipping.

The night after meeting George Cecil Jones, Sir John dreamed again of Chapel Perilous, which was now a heavily armed, scarlet-walled castle owned by a man-eating ogre named Sir Talis. \"You must enter without being sown,\" said Judge Everyman, \"for bleating runes are red.\" King Edward III, wearing the conventional business suit of George Cecil Jones, wandered in numinous room in- candescent muttering something about the impotence of being honest. \"The moover hoovered,\" He He Commons added help- fully. \"The door opens to the wastebule, past eggnaughts to oldfresser Poop in the Watercan.\" \"The unbeatable and the unsbrickable,\" shrieked a giant owl. \"Sol is buried inside,\" muttered Uncle Bentley. \"Talk id and hoot!\" Sir John realized he was in the Temple of Solomon the King as described in Freemasonic literature. • \"Wee-knee got Thor, Sir Talis war bore,\" roared a Lion. \"Passing as some dew-mist too dense upon the air,\" whizzed an Eagle. \"Bloog ardor!\" howled Sir Knott the Almighty. \"Take heed and hate!\" Sir John, a solo man under sectualism, stumbled into the owld cavern of skeletons, a tripentocto- con where the morn's dozen sheens.

Sitting up, he found he was still half-dreaming or talking to himself internally. \"We are such stuff as dreams are made of,\" his or somebody's voice was saying.

He did not dread being known as a Romantic, but he had no intent of becoming a damned fool. When he returned home and sat down to read the Lon- don Times, he found that Stolypin, the Russian premier, had been murdered, the latest in the brutal assassinations that had made the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth seem a prelude to rising worldwide anarchy. He tried to remember his par- ents and his own feelings at the time of their deaths and found only a dull pain in the place where memory should be. If there was such a thing as higher wisdom or higher knowledge, Sir John felt that the human race very badly needed it. Life, to ordinary wisdom and ordinary knowl- edge, appeared no more than a singularly pointless and bru- tal jest. \"Off with their heads! Off with their heads!\" God seemed to be gibbering most of the time, like the Red Queen in Alice. Does He really kill us for His sport? Sir John spent the next two weeks re-reading and medi- tating on the classic Rosicrucian pamphlets of the seven- teenth century. Everything Jones had so prosaically illus- trated was there: the Brother of the Invisible College of the Rosy Cross will \"dress in the garb\" of the country where he resides and \"adapt all its customs\"; although forever pledged to the Invisible College, he will manifest no overt sign to the world, except that he might heal the sick, taking no money for that service. At the exact termination of the fortnight, Sir John re- ceived a small package in the mail from P. O. Box 718, Main Post Office, London. Inside was a small pamphlet entitled \"History Lection.\" Authorship was given as: Hermetic Order of the G.'.D/. Sir John's heart leaped; he knew that those pyramidal dots represented, in occult symbology, an order possessing the original Mason Word, admittedly lost to all other Free- masonic orders. He recalled from the anonymous Muses Threnody of 1648: For we be brethren of the Rosy Cross We have the Mason Word and second sight Things for to come we can see aright"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"48 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI With trembling fingers, Sir John opened the pamphlet and began to read the secret history of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. In 1875, it said, a great fire de- stroyed Freemasons' Hall in London. Robert Wentworth Little — a writer whose books on Masonry were familiar to Sir John — found some long-forgotten documents, while rescuing important charters and other items of value from the flames. These mysterious papers were in a cipher un- known to Little or any other London Freemasons of the time. By dint of continuous, meticulous effort and perse- verance, Little eventually solved the cipher, decoded the documents, then found himself in possession of the secrets of the Invisible College — secrets which orthodox Free- masonry had long since lost. The documents also provided a link with a continental order which seemed to possess even deeper secrets and provided the address of a high initiate named Fraulein Anna Sprengel in Ingolstadt, Ba- varia. The lection went on to tell how Robert Wentworth Little and various other London Freemasons, guided by Fraulein Sprengel, began the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, originally admitting as members only those who were al- ready high-degree Masons. Using the techniques learned from Miss Sprengel and the ciphered documents, they grad- ually recreated the whole working repertoire of Cabalistic occultism underlying the Rosy Cross order of Freemasonry and sought earnestly to establish astral contact with the Higher Intelligences on other planes who could gradually educate and guide them in the risky transition from the domesticated apehood of historical humanity to a higher stage on the evolutionary scale. This \"History Lection\" went on to assert that such con- tact had been established and that the Golden Dawn was now operating under astral guidance. It added ominously that students should beware of several impostors who had seized upon the name of the order and were operating false Golden Dawns of their own devoted to diabolism and black magick.

The former individual had been born Sam- uel Liddell Mathers and had decided, when embarking on the paths of Magick, that Samuel Mathers, Sam Mathers, S. L. Mathers, S. Liddell Mathers were all unsuitable and unglamorous names for a Magician; he had therefore taken the more sonorous cognomen of MacGregor Mathers. The latter individual, similarly, had been born Edward Alexander Crowley and found also that the various per- mutations of that appellation were too prosaic for the ca- reer he intended; after profound research and much thought he concluded that the name \"Jeremy Taylor\" was the most memorable in English because of its rhythm. Wishing to appropriate that rhythm, he re-dubbed himself Aleister Crowley. q: Quote a standard reference on the history of the Golden Dawn so as to convey maximum information without ex- ceeding the legal limits of fair usage and with least possible prejudice toward one faction or another. a: \"The Golden Dawn was the most influential of the many occult secret societies founded in the nineteenth century. It first came into existence in 1887-88 and was founded on the basis of certain cipher manuscripts allegedly discovered in London which described five rituals of initiation. . . . Early in the 1890s, however, the nature of the Golden Dawn was transformed by one of its leaders, S. L.

Sir John reflected on the \"History Lection\" for two days before deciding how much further he dared go. Then he wrote back to Jones and begged admission to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn as a Probationer. And so he crossed the thrice-sealed door and passed over from being a student of occult history to being a tentative and nervous practitioner of occult arts, wherein he was soon to learn that we are in fact such stuff as dreams are made of, and that Sir Talis is inescapable. Sir John was initiated on the night of July 23, 1910— ex- actly 307 years to the day after the knighting of Sir Francis Bacon, the alleged Grandmaster of the Invisible College in Elizabethan England (according to Golden Dawn docu- ments — which also claimed such illustrious members as Sir Richard Francis Burton, Paul Gauguin, Richard Wagner, King Ludwig of Bavaria, Wolfgang von Goethe, Adam Weishaupt, Dr. John Dee, Pope Alexander VI, Jacob Boehme, Paracelsus, Christian Rosenkreutz, Giordano Bruno, Jacques de Molay, Newton, Beethoven, Merlin, Rabelais, Vergil, Jesus, Buddha, Lao-Tse, Solomon, Osiris and Krishna, among others). About the initiation itself, Sir John, true to his Oath, never revealed any details, even on that night in Zurich when, with the Fohn witch-wind beat- ing at the windows, he recounted his extraordinary adven- tures to James Joyce and Professor Albert Einstein. Some veils shall never be lifted; Babcock would not lift that par- ticular veil. Three nights after the initiation, Sir John experienced it over again, in the form of another hermetic dream. He was being led, blindfolded, to the throne of the South where opens the window of the Silver Star in night's roaman indigo. \"Who comes here?\" asked the Gordean, Sir Francis Bacon. \"One who seeks the Light,\" Sir John replied, according to the traditional Masonic formula explained to him before the ceremony. \"Humankind cannot bear very much Light,\" said Nigh-"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATE 51 trix in a watery voice. \"Look upon what little you domesti- cated mammals are presently prepared to receive.\" There was a spouter inn the weib and Sir John found himself back again at the Tower Struck By Lightning. Sir Talis, a gorged hairyman, was counting out his honi. Sir Joan crept past ovaseer Peep parsing as somndreamist and found hirselves in a vast humming hive (decliner flying, mythra ovid: what a man dasn't shame) where madmen struggled frantically to kill each other, cursing and scream- ing, \"You will, whisker, you will!\" and clutching daggers gats dirks goaters and broken bottle shards, uttering vowelth, muttering foulth, as all sank into dank, dark blood-red fetid moonslime. \"Kid goaters!\" they howled. \"And that the Vril is strong!\" A medieval scroll was unrolled, Indie, Norse, Russian, Irish, veryvery long but veryvery dutiful, saying: DO NOT THROW BUTTS IN THE URINAL: FOR THEY ARE SUBTLE AND SWIFT TO ANGER Sed, the whole's arpent of entry, a muddy murky leaky John, pressed cowrin throngs upon him, shrieking, \"Fear the forgotten I\" \"These,\" said Nud the Allmousey (Eutaenius Microstem- mus) in eagulls clause, \"are those who came this way with- out the Cup of Sympathy. Each imagines all the others to be terrifying demons and thinks he acts only in self-defense. Tragic, and ironic, is it not?\" Sir John awoke with a start. \"Suffering Christ!\" he said, without any profane intent. Was that dream a vision of how humanity looked from the viewpoint of an Illuminated mind? \"A real initiation never ends,\" Jones had said cryptically, before the physical-plane initiation. Sir John understood: the dream, in its own language, was indeed a continuation of the initiation, but on another plane. Even the masks used in the actual ceremony were now, in the light of the dream's clear message, an allegory, not a mere bit of the- atrical mummery. The masks worn in ordinary life are psy- chological, not cardboard, but nonetheless serve -to hide each from his fellows; Society is the Devil's Masquerade. When Sir John met next with Jones at the tetter's home in Soho, the dreams of the Dark Tower were discussed at length and Sir John proudly exhibited his decoding of their symbolism, especially the allegory of the masks."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"52 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI \"True enough,\" Jones said. \"But it is also a rule of our Order that nobody in it ever knows personally any more than one other member. The masks used in initiations help enforce that rule.\" \"And what, pray, is the purpose of that?\" \"Mars is the patron god of all societies,\" Jones said grim- ly. \"Competition smashed the first Golden Dawn lodge in London. Everybody knew everybody, so we all fell into transcendental egotism — 'my Illumination is higher than your Illumination, ' that sort of thing — and the Devil of Disputation drove us apart. We don't repeat any of our mistakes, Sir John. From here on, except for very special emergencies, perhaps, you will meet nobody else in the lodge but myself, until somebody higher up replaces me as your teacher. If we don't know one another, we can't fall into rivalries.\" This radical decentralization was a double-edged device, Sir John soon realized. Not only was he spared the waste of time and energy that might have been spent wondering if he were progressing faster or slower than another student, but the mystery created by this lack of sociability had a subtle and new effect on all his perceptions of other human beings. At first, he would merely wonder, if somebody made a remark that seemed more insightful than usual, \"Could it be ... is he one of us, too?\" Was Shakespeare in the In- visible College? The head waiter at Claridge's? Just how many members were there? It was impossible to get a literal answer out of Jones about this. 'The question itself implies a Probationer's ignorance about the true nature of Space and Time,\" was all Jones would contribute on that subject. Sir John began to wonder, every time he read the familiar newspaper yarn about a person rescued from danger by a Mysterious Stranger who immediately vanished without ac- cepting thanks or leaving his name. \"Another of us?\" Sir John would speculate romantically, seeing the protective hand of the Great White Brotherhood everywhere. Of course, as a Cambridge graduate, he had imbibed, at least by os icthing of modern skeptical scholarship, and he knew all this might be mere infatuation with a wonder- ful myth. But, on the other hand, one could not expect to be pro- vided with special spectacles allowing the members of the Invisib! icb other, could one?"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 53 And the enigma of hermetic societies was more subtle than that, Sir John was to discover. The Golden Dawn, after all, was allegedly continuing the unbroken tradition of the original Invisible College of the Rosy Cross, whose members \"wore the garb and adapted the manners\" of the country in which they resided. Sir John soon found that even the most inane remarks or offensive behavior would trigger the same question: \"Another of us?\" How many Adepts might there be, traveling about in the guise of ordi- \" nary humanity, carefully hiding their advanced state behind a masquerade of socially normal stupidity or conformity? Jesus allowed Himself to be spat upon, whipped, mocked and crucified; the Golden Dawn literature made it abun- dantly clear that a true Adept might play any role or suffer any humiliation in order to accomplish his or her special Work: The Fool may be The Magus in disguise. Sir John was simultaneously devouring tons of mystical literature from all nations and all ages, dumped on him ten volumes at a time by Jones. Written examinations once a month determined that he understood, at least verbally, what he read. \"But I am a Christian,\" Sir John protested once. \"Nor do we wish to make you any more or less than that,\" Jones replied. \"But to progress in the Great Work, you must become aware of the invisible truth behind the visible paraphernalia of all religions. In our Order, the Christian may remain Christian, the Jew Jew, the Moslem Moslem, as it may be, but whatever their faith, they may not remain narrow-minded sectarians.\" Sir John began to understand this ambiguous ecumen- icism a bit while studying a text on Buddhism. The refrain, \"Everyone you meet is a Buddha,\" began to drive him to despair; it was so nonsensical; it was repeated so often, in so many different ways; it was obvious that he would have to understand it before he began to comprehend what Bud- dhism was all about. He, therefore, at Jones' suggestion, tried to see the Buddha in everyone he met — and then he understood quickly. The effect was the same as the deliberate mystification within the Golden Dawn about who was or wasn't a mem- ber. Looking for the Buddha in everyone, like looking for more members of the Order, caused Sir John to pay a great deal closer attention to people than he ever had before, and to see more of their mysterious and adamantine individuality,"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"54 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI rather than classifying them into categories of age, sex, race, caste or other superficialities. He now saw all people as mysterious, incredible beings; and he understood, sud- denly, a most annoying paradox of Goethe, who had said, \"What is hardest of all? That which seems most simple: to see with your eyes what is before your eyes.\" And he understood, too, Saint Paul's insistence that \"we are all members of the Body of Christ.\" Every man and woman was a single facet of the diamond-mirror, made in the image of God, which was humanity. Buddhism, as Jones had promised him, had not weakened his Christianity but had illuminated it further. Sir John thought this was marvelous and poured it out in manic excitement at his next meeting with Jones. \"Very good,\" Jones said condescendingly. \"You have awakened, a little, from one of the dreams that keep the sleepwalkers on the street from seeing one another. This is a beginning, but only a beginning. Don't be too impressed with your progress, for God's sake, or you'll never move another inch. Try seeing the divine Light in every beautiful object that comes your way — deep scarlet rubies, or tiger- lilies in a field, or the red markings on a crab's back. Then ask yourself where consciousness and divinity are not.\" And with that crushing and yet encouraging speech, de- livered with a trace of leonine fire, mild Mr. Jones seemed to Sir John definitely beyond all doubt the genuine article: a true Adept. Then, without mercy, Jones dumped ten books on Cabala upon Sir John, told him to master them thoroughly — and nearly torpedoed and sank him forever. Babcock, previously, had studied Cabala only as a his- torian, learning enough of its terminology and theories to trace its influence from the early Hermeticists like Pico dclla Mirandola and Giordano Bruno through Dr. Dee and Sir Francis Bacon, onward to Freemasonry and Illuminism. Now he found himself confronted with the necessity of mastering the entire Cabalistic theory of the universe, which was about a thousand times more complicated than the periodic table of chemical elements Uncle Bentley kept in his study. According to Cabala, the cosmos is governed by sym- bolic correspondences between many planes of being, vis- ible and invisible. That seemed simple enough; but the correspondences themselves had no logical connections at all — \"Cabala transcends logic,\" Jones reminded Sir John."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 55 The correspondences could only be learned by brute force and rote repetition until they finally embedded themselves in the memory. Even after being memorized, the correspon- dences would not be understood by the student, Jones cheer- fully remarked; true understanding, he said, could come only through intuition or through direct experience of the invisible planes, by techniques to be taught when Sir John graduated from Probationer to Neophyte. q: Give three concise examples of Cabalistic logic. a: [1] All Hebrew words having the same numerical value must have equivalent meanings; therefore, ACh D (unity) which equals A(l) + Ch(8) + D(4) or 13, is the same as AHBH (love) because A(l) + H(5) + B(2) + H(5) also equals 13; ergo, unity is love and love is unity. [2] Since the Holy Unspeakable Name of God (YHVH) = Y(10) + H(5) + V(6) + H(5) = 26, which is 2 X 13, God is love + unity. [3] Since 7 of the 22 Hebrew let- ters also correspond to planets, the proportion 22/7 is very important; and, indeed, 22/7 = 3.1415 . . . etc., the value of 7T, or the ratio of the radius of a circle to its circum- ference. q: Give an example of Cabalistic logic running into trou- ble. a: Since God is unity, and the first Hebrew letter A (Aleph) = 1, A symbolizes God. But A (Aleph) written in full Hebrew is ALP which =111, showing that God is a triple unity; well and good for Christian Cabalists, al- though annoying to Jewish and Moslem Cabalists. But 111 also = APL, Darkness, and ASN, Sudden Death. Is God, therefore, equivalent to Darkness and Sudden Death? Sir John spent days, weeks, then months rote-reciting over and over, peering into the books again each time memory slipped: \"Aleph is the first Hebrew letter 'and means 'ox.' The principle correspondences are the Fool card in the Tarot, the color yellow, the element air, the Holy Spirit in the New Testatment, the Breath of God— what's that?— Ruach Elohim, the Breath of God, in the Old Testament, the path from Kether to Chockmah on the Tree of Life and, uh, oh, God, uh . . .\" Back to the books. \"Beth is the second Hebrew letter and means 'house.'

Oh, Christ, what's the name of the monkey-god . . . ?\" Back, again, to the books. Jones would travel to Babcock Manor and test Sir John occasionally. \"Nun\" he would say, \"what Tarot card is that?\" \"Death.\" \"The Hebrew meaning?\" \"A fish.\" \"Very good. The medieval equivalent of the Chariot card in the Tarot?\" \"The Holy Grail.\" \"Excellent. The Hebrew letter for the same?\" \"Uh, uh, daleth . . .\" \"Wrong. Won't do at all, my boy. No carelessness al- lowed. Memorize, memorize, memorize!\" Sir John memorized. \"Work on the first two words of the Bible,\" Jones sug- gested then; and Sir John found himself seeking the hidden meanings in BRAShlTH ALHIM. \"In the beginning, the Gods.\" Of course, he knew from Pico della Mirandola that BRAShlTH [\"In the beginning . . .\"] has the numerical value of 3910, the number of years according to occult tradition from the \"Fall\" of humanity (due to the unfortunate trauma of the first contact with Higher Intelligence, coded into the serpent myth of Genesis) to the birth of Jesus. He dis- covered for himself that ALHIM (the gods: God-in-the- singular as YHVH or Jehovah not appearing until the sec- ond chapter) contains, by the permutations of temura, 3.1415, or pi accurate to four places. Then he noted that BRA, the first three letters, form by notarikon the initials of Ben, the Son; Ruach, the Holy Spirit; and Abba, the Father. \"Very good,\" Jones said when this was reported. \"There is much, much more there. For instance, Agape, the word for 'Love' in the New Testament, has the Cabalistic value of 93. Add that to the 3.1415 of ALHIM and you get 3.141593, pi accurate to six places. Keep working on it until you find the Golden Proportions of the Masonic lodge in it.\" Once, Sir John had the temerity to ask Jones about the mysterious Holy Guardian Angel which the Golden Dawn training was intended to evoke."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 57 \"Usually,\" Jones said, \"that is explained three different ways — for Probationers, Neophytes, and those of higher rank who have yet not attained it. In your case, considering the mixture of scholarship and romanticism I detect in your temperament, I will give you all three explanations simultaneously. One: it is a metaphor that signifies, rough- ly, learning to receive communications from your own un- conscious mind without the usual distortions. Two: it is not that simple at all; the Holy Guardian Angel speaks to you through your unconscious, but is literally a separate being of evolutionary status as far beyond us as we are be- yond the first invertebrates. Three: yes, it is a metaphor, after all, but for something so far outside our ordinary consciousness that it doesn't matter a rap whether you think of it in the scientific terms of my first answer or in the mystical terms of my second answer; it transcends both. When you have the experience, you will find your own metaphor for it, which may result in a scientific theory never known to the world before, in a work of art, or just in a change in your life toward sanctity or compassion or some- thing more traditionally 'religious.' Do more of the work and ask fewer questions, if you want to advance faster.\" Eventually, nine months after Sir John's initiation, he had completed his reading course in world mysticism and was able to pass all of Jones' Cabalistic quizzes easily. By now, he was also totally confused and was beginning to wonder if he or Jones or both of them might not be a bit mad. After all, what did an ox have to do with a man in Fool's garb, or either of them with the color yellow or the Holy Spirit? If Thoth and Hermes were the same god under two names, well and good; that made sense historically. But why were they in correspondence with the Hebrew word for \"house\"? Or what the hell did the planet Venus have to do with the letter daleth and the goddess Demeter? Was Ca- bala all a complicated Jewish joke at the expense of those who tried to comprehend the suprarational by rational means? It was when Sir John had begun to seriously consider this last thought that quiet, fatherly Mr. Jones gave him his first real test, right between the eyes. \"You are familiar,\" he said, \"with the letters that appear atop every Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Crucifix, I.N.R.I.\" \"Yod Nun Resh Yod\" Sir John replied at once, giving the Hebrew equivalents."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"58 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI [\"/ nearly reached India.\"] \"Very good. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches, of course, explain this in childish terms, for the simple minds of the masses. Are you, perhaps, familiar with that expla- nation?\" \"It's supposed to be Latin,\" Sir John said happily; this was easy. \"Iesus Nazarinus Rex Iudorem — 'Jesus of Naza- reth, King of the Jews.' \" \"Excellent,\" Jones said. \"Now I must inform you that there was an esoteric Gnostic meaning in those initials long before the creation of the exoteric one you have just supplied. It requires Cabalistic knowledge and the true fac- ulty of intuition to decode it. That will be your assignment to complete before we promote you to Neophyte. Call me whenever you think you have the answer.\" Sir John spent a week nearly going mad over this conun- drum. On the seventh day he made up a table in which he deliberately listed only the most nonsensical and illogical correspondences, to force himself to think in the meta- logical manner of the true Cabalists. The table looked like this: Hebrew Letter Tarot Correspondence Astrological Correspondence Greek Correspondence Yod (hand) The Hermit Virgo Chronos Nun (fish) Death Scorpio Hades Resh (head) The Sun The Sun Apollo Yod (hand) The Hermit Virgo Chronos He tried letting his mind drift through the images, avoid- ing words and associations: hand, fish, head, hand; hand, fish, head, hand; hand, fish, head, hand . . . Dozens of ideas came to him that were original and dazzling (he once be- gan to see evolution as a pre-written scenario . . .), but"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 59 nothing came up that didn't seem like empty and windy nonsense when he re-thought it later. He tried the astrological correspondences: Virgo, Scorpio, the Sun, Virgo. A virgin, an insect, the Sun, and the virgin again. That was even less helpful than hand-fish-head-hand. He tried Virgin-hand, insect-Death, head-Sun, Virgin-hand. This gave rise to a line of thought which made him quite em- barrassed and caused him to doubt again if he had the purity of heart to pass through Chapel Perilous success- fully. The Greek correspondences were resonant with eerie imagery. Chronos, god of Time, could be visualized grue- somely by recalling Goya's terrifying painting, Chronos Devouring His Children. Hades and the world of the dead were easy to invoke by remembering the descent of Odys- seus to the underworld. Apollo reminded Sir John of Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas and was harder to deal with. But what was the meaning of the sequence itself: Chronos, Hades, Apollo, Chronos? Sir John tried contemplating the images on the Tarot cards: The Hermit: an old man carrying a lantern in the dark. But what did that have to do with yod, the hand, except that you need a hand to carry a lantern? And why the corre- spondence with scorpions and virginity? Death: a skeleton on a great white horse, mowing down King, Bishop, Mother and Child in his path. But what did that have to do with nun, a fish? Although it fit Hades, God of the dead, of course. The Sun: a naked child on the same great white horse with the sun rising in the background. And what did that have to do with resh, the head? Although it fit the astrolog- ical correspondence for once. And the old Hermit carrying his lantern again ... . Was it a psychological parable about the path of initia- tion itself? The student's mind begins as an old man (social tradition) , wandering in the darkness of ignorance, guided only by the lantern of intuition; becomes transformed through the death of its conditioned aspects — the links with King (the State), Bishop (the Church), Mother and Child (family); is reborn as the sun-child (\"Unless ye become as a little child ye shall in no wise enter the Kingdom\"); and then — and then — why the return to the old man wandering"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"60 MASKS OF THE BLLUMINATI in the dark?

Sir John tried Gematria, which is the Cabalistic method of taking the numerical value of a mystery-word and relat- ing it to all other Hebrew words having the same number. Yod was 10, nun was 50, resh was 200, second yod was 10 again. Total: 270. He plunged for days into his Hebrew dictionary and found only one example: Q^rPTl, levers or b.: Another blank wall.

In the morning, he read it again and could only laugh. But an hour later, in his library, a most peculiar accident occurred. He was reaching for his Hebrew dictionary again, looking for at least a second word with the value 270, when another book somehow got dislodged and fell at his feet. He bent to pick it up and found it was a seventeenth- century alchemical treatise, opened at page 270. Coinci- dence? The first paragraph began: The secret of the Great Work is given to all true Christians by the formula I.N.R.I., which, properly interpreted, means Igni Natura Renovatur Integra. The translation leaped into Sir John's mind in a blinding flash: All of nature is renewed by fire. An old man, death and rebirth — Time, Death and Resur- rection — Crucifixion and Redemption — the Lord of Time, the Lord of the Underworld and the Golden Dawn. All of"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"62 MASKS OF THE HXUMINATI nature is renewed by fire. The Greek and Christian symbols flowed together and merged with the Tarot cards. Sir John's gropings toward a new theory of evolution, midway between his father's Lamarckian heresies and Uncle Bent- ley's Darwinian othodoxy, became agonizingly concrete as he experienced the struggle out of the caves, the raiding nomads who swept down from the deserts, the snows, the storms, the plagues, the pain, the constant death, death, death. And the onward struggle: the birth toward true consciousness, flickering dimly in all, blazing into fiery illumination occasionally. It was the cosmic birth experience relived and relived and relived until the agony and the joy became mingled and inseparable. He was the single cell swimming in the amniotic ocean, remembering the searing ecstasy of his creation: the tenderness of the first moments at the tit: the caves of Trolls he had imagined becoming real as dark archaic forces moved all about him: swimming in the hot sun, at peace: and then the terror and the horror of life again: the hunger and the violence and the lunacy: the victims of the Inquisition screaming for centuries on the torture racks of insane Faith: the devils and demons unleashed from the fantasy of terrified minds into the experience of millions: people in solitary confine- ment: soldiers with their arms and legs and genitals burned off: children beaten and whipped and starved: death on the operating table under the scalpel of drunken and sadistic doctors: while the carnivals and dances go on, the blind merry ones oblivious to all the agony of their brothers and sisters in the hell of man's inhumanity to life: mothers weeping over stillborn infants: the horror in the mouse's eye as it knew itself trapped: gigantic halls of enormous godly statues of peace and wisdom: eternity of mountains and oceans: the undying trees talking silently forever: carrying the cross up the hill, accepting the burden, willing to take all the pain and all the agony forever, to redeem at last the blind struggle and complete the planetary birth.

There is one further matter I must mention at this time. It will be necessary, I am afraid, for you to take an Oath of celibacy for the duration of the next two years. Will you accept that condition, or will you drop out of the Great Work, instead? Once taken, you understand, the oath is binding and will bring down terrible punishments if violated in any manner.'* Sir John controlled his features with difficulty. \"I remain pledged to the Great Work,\" he said firmly. \"I will endure any trials that are necessasry.\" \"I must ask you three times. Are you quite sure of yourself in this matter?\" \"I am.\" Sir John did not hesitate this time. \"And I ask you the third time. Will you be bound by this Oath of celibacy for two full years and not attempt any mental reservations or sophistries to evade or circum- vent it if it becomes onerous?\" \"I will be bound,\" Sir John said firmly. Jones looked at his empty plate with seemingly great interest, as if searching for archaeological clues as to its age. \"Celibacy, to be spiritually effective,\" he said mildly, quietly, \"must be total. No . . . urn . . . solitary vices may be allowed to console one for the absence of womankind.\" Sir John felt the separate tension in each muscle of his face, thinking first: The blood is rushing to my cheeks and I'm blushing like an imbecile schoolchild. And then: No, the blood is draining from my face and I look like the pale criminal in the dock, not daring to look up at that moment lest Jones should also have looked up from his own seem- ingly obsessive scrutiny of his empty plate, and half-afraid also that Jones might be so advanced an Adept that reading minds was as easy for him as reading the label on a cham- pagne bottle; yet hyper-conscious again, as in the first rising of the alchemical heat, the first sense of the Rosy Cruci- fixion implied in the cryptogram I.N.R.I., aware of his own awareness and afraid of his own fear: once again confronting the foreboding of insanity that had plagued him since the first timid sins of puberty, so that in a kind of hysterical paralysis he felt time itself might have slowed and, wondering if paranoia was descending upon him, thinking / heard it, and, No, I only imagined it — for it seemed that somebody at a nearby table had said distinctly,"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"66 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI almost mockingly, the name of that which was most inti- mately connected with his most shameful secret.

Jones drank another sip of wine. \"Two years,\" he said calmly, as if not noticing Sir John's nervousness, \"is not so terribly long a time, you will find. And you will discover that matters astral become increasingly easy as you place matters carnal away from you. I have confidence in you, Sir John,\" he ended with abrupt warmth, patting the younger man's shoulder for emphasis. And Sir John returned home for two weeks, to practice astral projection, feeling most of the time (as Jones had warned him) like a perfect damned fool. If the I.N.RJ. riddle concerned the transcendence of time, the practice of astral projection seemed to aim at the abolition of space. The trick, Sir John soon perceived, was to be in two places at once. Since that was manifestly im- possible in reason, the only way to achieve it was to go beyond reason, to deliberately cultivate a type of faith bordering on religious mania. Sir John's inital attempts were grotesque failures. Even after three weeks of practice four times a day, the best Babcock achieved was a transportation to the innards of some incredibly complex machine with a million or more moving parts, each tended by a blue puppet and a red dwarf moving jerkily, mechanical-style, all of them talking to themselves as they worked at their incomprehensible tasks. \"Mulligan Milligan Hooligan Halligan,\" they mut- tered. \"Magick tragick music mystic!\" they shrieked. \"Simple Simon Semper Semen,\" they giggled. \"Barter carter darter farter!\" they howled. \"Sir Lion, Sir Loin, Sir Talis, Sir Qualis,\" they gibbered. With a shudder Sir John came back into his body into his chair into his room into Eu- clidean space, realizing that he had dozed off when he thought he was beginning to project into the astral. \"Do not let such nonsense bother you,\" Jones said when Sir John showed him the Diary entry of this experience. \"One can hear the same gibberish at any Revival meeting or Spiritualist » You have just opened a door into another of the traps in Chapel Perilous. That is the realm of those who enter the Path without the Sword of Reason."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE BLLUMINATI 67 If you reflect back, you will remember hearing the same idiocy just before falling asleep many nights.\" \"Yes,\" Sir John said \"Does everybody?\" \"Certainly. The mind has both a rational and an irra- tional side,\" Jones said kindly. \"To remain totally rational is to become half a human. To allow the irrational to over- whelm you is to succumb to religious mania or the disease called hysteria by alienists. The Great Work consists of yoking the rational and irrational together in a harmony that transcends both. Until that is achieved, you may ex- pect more nonsense to float up from the irrational regions* Ignore it, do not fear it, and concentrate on the Work.\" In the following weeks Sir John found the astral realm and the dreamworld increasingly blending into each other, and increasingly hard to disentangle from waking reality. He heard many messages like: \"Hickory dickory dock, we've got you by the cock,\" \"The void, the zero, the nought, the Almighty,\" \"No wife, no horse, no mustache,\" \"A weary weary song and a blurry blurry bottleful,\" \"For blood and wine are red,\" \"Yoni to those pensive males,\" and, several times, \"Babcock's going crazy, Babcock's going crazy, Bab- cock's going crazy . . .\" For relaxation, Sir John took to browsing in contempor- ary poetry, mindful of the Golden Dawn teaching that dur- ing training any extraneous reading should be limited to matter of a spiritually uplifting nature. He began to study the mystical Irish poet, William Butler Yeats. The question \"Another of us?\" came back to him again and again, as he read poem after poem, and this time he had confidence enough to answer it with a definite \"yes.\" There was no mistaking it; the poetry of Yeats was replete with oblique references to the Golden Dawn teachings and initiatory ceremonies. And then, by the wildest of coincidences — Sir John was less and less inclined to believe in coincidences by now — he was invited to a small private reading at which Yeats and a few other poets were going to declaim some of the more recent works. Sir John accepted, feeling vaguely guilty; but then, he reminded himself, he was only for- bidden to associate with other known members of the Order, and he did not, literally, know Yeats was a member, after all, since that was only a deduction, almost a guess, on his part"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"68 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI A small devilish voice told him, \"It's not a guess; you do know.\" But he put that aside. The chance to meet an- other member of the Order — a famous one, and one who, judging from the poetry, had been in the Order for at least a decade and was hence presumably quite advanced — was really irresistible. Sir John went to the reading, even though it was in the godforsaken suburb of Kensington, which was said to be even more infested with Hindus, Hebrews, Americans and other undesirables than Soho itself. Indeed, the host turned out to be an American, of the most unbearable sort. His accent was nearly indeciphera- ble — Sir John remembered the degenerate Oscar Wilde's really choice aphorism: \"The English and the Americans have everything in common but their language.\" This un- usual host was, like all Americans, bombastically sure of himself on all matters, especially (in his case) literature and the arts in general. His family name was Pound and his first name was one of those Hebraic titles that many Yankees seemed to favor — Ezekiel or Ezra or Jeremiah or something equally Old Testament. He had untidy red hair, a wild red beard, stood well over six feet and boomed when he talked, like all Americans. No article of clothing he wore seemed to match any other article of his apparel; whether this was due to poverty, eccentricity or both, Sir John could not quite decide. Even the handsome Yeats himself was, if not unkempt, far from ideal in sartorial splendor, Sir John also noted; but Yeats was serene where Pound was frantic, tolerant where Pound was dogmatic and gentle where Pound was rough. The readings were exceedingly miscellaneous. Pound read some amazingly short and unrhymed poems unlike anything Sir John had ever heard and then a very strange transla- tion of 'The Seafarer,\" in which he had somehow managed, in modern English, to include as many alliterative con- sonants and guttural assonances as the Anglo-Saxon origi- nal. A shy young lady named Hilda-something read some equally short pieces which sounded like very literal transla- tions from the ancient Greek. Then, at last, Yeats began chanting and keening in his distinctive way, and Sir John finally heard something that sounded like real poetry to him. He almost wept with emotion at the lines: Romantic Ireland's dead and gone; It's with O'Lcary in his grave"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 69 Afterward, the bombastic Pound served some of the strongest coffee Sir John had ever tasted, and led everybody into a lively discussion about what they had heard. English poetry, Pound said violently, was \"trapped in the Miltonic trance,\" which he sarcastically caricatured as \"whakty- whakty-whakty-whakty-boom! boom! whakty-whakty-whak- ty-boom! boom!\" Experiments such as Hilda's imitations of the ancient Greeks, Yeats' recreation of Bardic forms of old Ireland and his own adaptions from the Chinese were necessary to enlarge the scope and range of verse, said this upstart. Several people immediately began protesting, and it seemed that Miltonic sonority and iambic pentameter were to them as important as the Monarchy to a Conserva- tive. \"It appears to me,\" said a young lady named Lola, whose accent seemed Australian, \"that poetry is invocation. If it does not invoke, then no matter what style it employs, it is not poetry.\" \"Invocation,\" Pound cried, \"belongs in churches. Poetry should present a precise image, in the fewest possible words, so that reading it is like being hit by an April breeze. That's what leaves an impression in the mind. Invocation and repetition are all blather that detracts from the red-hot in- tensity of the poetic flash itself, which only lasts a mo- ment.\" \"Oh, come, Ezra,\" Yeats protested mildly. \"Repetitious rhythm is the essence of the act of love, which poetry is always, consciously or unconsciously, trying to simulate.\" Before Pound could reply, the young lady named Lola brazenly replied, without a blush, \"Exactly the point, Mr. Yeats. Do you know what I consider the greatest modern poem? Captain Fuller's Treasure House.' Do you know it?\" And she quoted: O thou brave soldier of life sinking into the quick- sand of death! I adore thee, Evoe! I adore thee, IAO! O thou laughter resounding from the tombs! I adore thee, Evoe! I adore thee, IAO! O thou goat-dancer of the hills! I adore thee, Evoe! I adore thee, IAO! O thou red cobra of desire that art unhooded by the hands of maidens! I adore thee, Evoe! I adore thee, IAO!"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"70 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI Sir John started violently and almost dropped his coffee cup. Once again the question \"Another of us?\" had an im- mediately affirmative answer. Evoe and I A O, according to Golden Dawn teachings, were two of the most secret Gnostic names to invoke divinity. He looked at Lola with astonishment, both because of these esoteric names she had quoted so casually and because nice young ladies simply did not speak so openly of the rhythm of the act of love. But she was looking at Yeats, awaiting a response, and her face was simply open and innocent; Sir John could not quite catch her eye. \"Captain Fuller certainly has his great moments,\" Yeats said, with equal innocence, as if he were not aware that two of the most secret words of Power in occultism were being casually quoted in public. \"However, while a few stanzas of that are fine, the whole poem does grow a bit wearisome after three hundred stanzas. There I must agree with Ezra that brevity would have been better.\" \"Who — who is this Captain Fuller?\" Sir John asked, try- ing also to sound casual. \"A great authority on military strategy, I'm told,\" Pound said. \"Lately, he has taken to writing quite a bit of mys- tical verse of that sort, all of it too damned long-winded and rhetorical for my taste.\" But Sir John was remembering, his pulses racing: \"O thou red cobra of desire that art unhooded by the hands of maidens! I adore thee, Evoe! I adore thee, LAO!\" The phallic double meaning was too overt to ignore, especially in the context of Yeats' remark about the rhythm of poetry being the rhythm of Eros. Was Lola, then, involved with one of the forbidden, lefthand lodges (\"Cults of the Shadow,\" Jones called them) that had split from the Golden Dawn and gone of! in the direction of diabolism? He looked at her again and this time he did catch her eye, but what he read there was a most enigmatic humor. Was it friendly, mocking or dangerously malign? Or was his imagination merely fevered by the fact that he was under a two-year Oath of celibacy and yet knew, for the first time, a sensual yearning strong enough to conquer both his timidity with women and the stern Victorian ethics instilled in him by his family? Was this attraction strong enough, he thought in fear, to conquer his Oath? He turned his eyes to the other side of the room, feeling a rush of blood to the face,"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 71 and found himself suddenly engulfed in suspicious thoughts. Yeats, obviously, was a member of the Golden Dawn. How many others at this poetry reading were, also? Could this whole eveing be a test of his Oath? He could not bring himself to look in Lola's direction again, and he left the party as soon as politeness allowed. But that night he dreamed of Lola raising her skirt to fix her garter and she caught him looking, cawing thanes, and he was scared wild (prosing zombie-dish) pursued by a faster boog, Sid, theol bardot of sneakery. There were hatenotes and featherfurgolems and potions burning boiled- est; Sir Joan, intrepid, nerveless, rapacious, idiotic, stumbled past the beehive pearlous. And the sun begin to rus, and oh up he ris, and he was all rose up, loinharted, up there so eye and moisty, baba cock of the morn, between them two toughies, for the romanz did tromp him, garther for- given, the achtnotes hurling bricks. \"Hate and be gored,\" sagd Shut and he saw, he was, he saw, he was, the Hideous God, Baphomet, hir dugs hanging limp, hir bigcock stand- ing stern, under the inverse pentacle of the Tempters. Sir John screamed as he sat up in bed with a thunderous crash shaking the room. \"Are you all right, sir?\" It was the voice of Wildeblood, the butler, outside the door. \"Did you hear it, too?\" Sir John asked. \"I thought it was a dream . . .\" \"It must have been an earth tremor, sir. Can I help you, sir?\" \"No,\" Sir John said. Tm quite all right, Wildeblood.\" Looking across the room, he could see that the mirror was smashed. The poltergeist effect: typical of the onset of astral invasions. He reminded himself of the primary Golden Dawn teachings: not to give way to fear whatever happened, and not to jump to conclusions. Wildeblood was probably right; it was only an earth tremor. But he could not sleep again until dawn; for he had seen the face of Baphomet, the Hideous God, and he knew that his journey into Chapel Perilous was no longer confined to dream alone. The earth had literally shaken beneath him; the astral and the physical were interacting. It was \"prob- ably only an earth tremor,\" but it was connected, psy- chically, with the real opening of the door between the visible and invisible worlds."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"72 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI SSump in fte 9H$t ACTION Close-Up: Dr. Carl Jung, circa 1909 [still photo].

Jones, meanwhile, became more bizarre in his teaching methods. At one of their fortnightly meetings, he showed Sir John a cartoon from Punch, depicting a very disgruntled gentleman and a very officious customs inspector glaring at each other. The customs inspector was saying, \"These cats is dogs and the rabbits is dogs, but that bloody turtle is a h insect!\" Sir John smiled uncertainly. \"Amusing,\" he ventured tentatively. \"It is the whole secret of Illumination,\" Jones said solemnly, \"if you consider it deeply enough.\" He insisted on giving the cartoon to Sir John, who obediently took it home, hung it in his bedroom and con- templated it once or twice a day. Illumination eluded him. The differing epistemologies of common-sense travelers and the authors of the customs regulations were symptomatic of primordial ontological confusions everywhere, perhaps. But what did that have to do with matters spiritual? At their next meeting, Jones presented Sir John with the iplete Works of Lewis Carroll. \"Here,\" he said gravely, \"is the condensed essence of Holy Cabala,\""},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINAT1 75 Sir John flushed angrily. \"This time I know you're having me on,\" he said. \"It isn't worthy of you, Jones.\" \"So,\" Jones said, \"you know more than your Teacher already?\" \"I know a hoax, sir, when it's right in front of my nose.\" Jones remained placid. \"How many times,\" he asked, \"have you encountered the saying, *When the student is ready, the Master speaks?' Do you know why that is true? The door opens inward. The Master is everywhere, but the student has to open his mind to hear the Master's Voice. Read carefully, Sir John, ponder the hidden meanings, and see if the Master does not speak to you through this book.\" Sir John, feeling more like an idiot than ever, took Lewis Carroll home and re-read all of it, cover to cover; and he was astonished at how much of it coincided with his own limited successes in astral projection. Were there even deeper meanings that would become clear when he had progressed farther in the Work? A few nights later he awoke from sleep convinced that he understood the Secret of Secrets. It was in one of Car- roll's couplets: He thought he saw a banker's clerk descending from a bus; He looked again and saw it was a hippopotamus The elation lasted for several minutes. Then he looked at the cracked mirror and saw his own reflection split in two. The whole world split in shatters, broken glass and jewels. This time he knew the explosion was psychic: neither Wildeblood nor any of the other servants would hear the demolition. He got out of bed very carefully and lit a candle. Sitting in the windowseat, listening to the beating of his heart, trying to breathe normally, he was overwhelmed by the crack's sudden ability to change rhythmically from an acute angle to an obtuse angle while visions poured through of worlds with seven moons, worlds with nineteen suns, soma- dust and 358 and fnord, magick castles in the mist, paladins in white and black armor, aeons of the rhythmic alteration from acute angle to obtuse angle, vast insectoid intelli- gences, wider and wider vistas of planets, galaxies, whole universes profoundly alien, the Demon-Sultan howling in the darkness where the moon doesn't shine. \"These dogs is"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"76 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI cats and these mice is 3.141593, but those bloody garters are incest.

From memory, concentrating deeply, ignoring the semenduets and obtuse rondels, he wrote in pen the five axioms and twenty-three definitions from Euclid's Geometry. Within half an hour he was in normal space-time again and the Lord of the Abyss of Hallucinations had been vanquished. FURTHER REFLECTIONS OF JAMES JOYCE (Parental discretion advised) Ineluctible network of coincidence: at least that if no more. Myriads of worldlines, Professor Einstein would say, but behind them, invisible, intangible, the enigmatic links of a dark design; indifferent, paring their fingernails. Di- alectic: Yeats, the one man in all Ireland who has tried to help me, to advance my career, yet the one against whom I must struggle to the end, since either his vision or mine will define the future of our literature. Joyce contemplated worldlines coiling back to the be- ginning. Karma, or the cause of all causes. Inexplicable and inextricable. Garters, by all that's holy. Network of coinci- dence.

A black camel be- neath a horned moon might be an omen of almost anything and everything to either Joyce or Babcock, but it was a domesticated mammal conjunct to the burned-out satellite of a type-G star to science. As he listened intently to Sir John Babcock's wondrous tale, Einstein occasionally allowed a quiet smile to break upon his lips — the reflex of an evolutionary past in which furry ancestors similarly bared their teeth at the sight of food; but it was the meat of pure thought that inspired the typical anthropoid grin in this case, the marvelous (albeit blind) processes of evolution have produced a brain, in advanced human beings such as Einstein, capable of hun- gering and thirsting after Truth itself. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with ac- tual readings of actual instruments, while permitting only the most economical descriptions of the phenomenon re- corded. It is permissible, of course, to posit certain gedan- kenexperiments (thought experiments), thereby deducing from known laws the necessary consequences of hypothet- ical situations.

There is, he began to see, a principle of neurological relativism, as well as of physical relativism. Just as he be- came a new Albert Einstein by rejecting his citizenship and the God of his people, Sir John had changed his nervous system by these so-called occult exercises. Yes: my two observers trying to measure a moving rod while they are themselves moving at differing velocities. That is the relativism of the instrument. But take, let us say, a man who is a Russian vegetarian pacifist and a woman who is an Italian Catholic conservative, each trying to understand Sir John's story. None of it will mean the same to both of them. That is the relativism of consciousness, of the ner- vous system itself. But the nervous system, mein Gott, is the instrument which reads all other instruments. So, then: precisely as my physicists in the elevator can never tell, from within the elevator, whether the downward force is gravity or inertia, so, too, no two persons can tell, from within their nervous systems, what presumed external source provides the signals they receive. Which is why, of course, the atheist and the occultist can argue forever, with- out either ever convincing the other. We are trapped, trapped, trapped by our ideas, forever in the position of the five blind men and the elephant.

Nor does it matter if Mr. Robert Wentworth Little invented the whole \"tradition\" out of hot air and forged ciphers in the collaboration with the enigmatic Fraulein Sprengel. The significant objective fact on which scientific attention must focus is that by joining this organi- zation our friend Babcock has involved himself with a secretive order engaged in projects of which he knows actually nothing, although he assumes much. Too much, in fact. As we all do, every day. The obvious absurdity of Newton's hypotheses non jingo: actually, it is impossible not to theorize. The velocity of nerve transmissions in the brain is such that we can never disentangle perception from conceptualization. It is even a concept that I am presently speaking to human be- ings. Joyce and Babcock might both be automatons pass- ing themselves off as humans, or I might be hallucinating. And who but Poincare* and Mach understand that fully, in their bones? We live, as Joyce says, in a web of symbolic constructs made by our brains. The Herrdoktor professors cannot understand my paper on relativity of space-time, for instance, because they think \"length\" is a fact, not a con- cept of our brains.

The crack was only moderately disquieting at first — although he could not look into it without imagining he saw, in the distorted image of himself created by the jagged glass, some depressing and menacing symbol of the dark side of the Vril force which had attacked him through the weak spot opened up by his susceptibility to the voluptuous yearnings aroused, perhaps deliberately, by the enigmatic Lola and her brazenly casual allusions to the rhythm of the act of copulation and the red cobra of desire. He was haunted by an uncomfortable idea, although he tried to shake it off; it would be foolish cer- tainly to accept it, on no better evidence than the coinci- dence of a bad dream and an earth tremor — yet the insidi- ously disturbing concept continued to grow in his mind: he"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"90 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI had perhaps encountered a real witch, and the medieval world he had so long studied was seemingly coming to life around him. The bedroom itself was now insidiously depressing to him, because of the cracked mirror and its eldritch bicam- eral images, yet he was also subtly uncomfortable elsewhere about the huge old house, also: something distasteful and disquieting, almost a sense of decay and morbidity, ap- peared to permeate the very air; something nameless and vague, a mere adumbration of new presences and possi- bilities, probably only his own overactive imagination, and yet something that seemed autochthonous, virtually antedi- luvian, furtively suggestive of hideous secrets of forgotten times and deeds that were against Nature and against Scrip- ture.

Sir John continued to dream often of Chapel Perilous and once he found himself in a huge dungeon beneath the earth, where crowds of sullen and stupid persons argued and debated violently. \"We shall have gno gods!\" shouted some. But others shouted back, \"We shall have gnu gods!\" And weenie gothor thick haggard were poor. \"There is no Chapel, there is no Grail, it is all a child's fantasy,\" mut- tered a liddel bho poop, yet veni verits, surd Alice war bear, flogging thor-talis behind them. \"The tree ovus, the size of us, the weight of us,\" sang an Erring Go BRA in groinblancorange, but a triune pentagonal octupus ex- plained, posing as somadust. \"These are those who started on the Path without the Wand of Intuition.

I feel closer and closer to grasping what he meant in saying that we are \"such stuff as dreams are made of\" A few nights later he allowed himself to be cajoled into a bridge game at Viscount Greystoke's, although that was precisely the sort of idiot pastime he generally despised. He barely endured the early part of the evening — there was much brandy, many cigars, and altogether too much talk about fox-hunting, a sport he despised as inhumane and barbaric. It was with great effort that he refrained from quoting the infamous Wilde's description of that bloody recreation as \"the uneatable pursued by the unspeakable.\" Then, around ten, a strange thing happened: he suddenly remembered that the ordinary playing-card deck was de- rived from the Tarot.

The rest of the evening he was so intensely conscious that he seemed to himself to have been half-asleep all his life by comparison; he won trump after trump. The euphoria was with him for nearly a day and a half after, and then gave way to a vague anxiety again when he remembered that many forms of lunacy be- gin with such excited states of mentation in which every incident and event seems charged with more than human meaning. In London two days later Sir John met the bombastic American, Ezekiel (or Ezra) Pound — perhaps by accident — at the British Museum. Pound was carrying a Chinese- English dictionary and a batch of notebooks labeled \"Fenol- losa MS.\" and was effusively cordial. They amicably agreed to step out for a bite of lunch together. \"Yeats is progressing nicely, under my influence,\" Pound pronounced grandly, over fish and chips. \"He's coming out of th^t Celtic fog and beginning to write modern poetry.\" Sir John found this self-importance hilarious, but managed to keep a straight face. He tactfully changed the subject. \"Why are you so preoccupied by Chinese verse forms?\" he asked in his most diffident manner. \"Chinese,\" Pound pronounced, \"will be as important to the twentieth century as Greek was to the Renaissance.\" And he went on for twenty minutes on that topic, before Sir John was able to interpolate a remark again. \"Who was that young lady reciting Captain Fuller?\" he asked, knowing that an evil impulse was driving him. Pound looked up sharply. \"She says her name is Lola Levine and she comes from France,\" he replied. \"I doubt it. Her French is worse than mine.\" \"She sounded Australian . . .\" Sir John said. \"Exactly,\" Pound agreed. \"A young lady one should not trust too much. Have you heard of Aleister Crowley?\" he asked. Sir John remembered the name — one of the leaders of a renegade Golden Dawn faction said to have turned in the ction of Diabolism. \"Vaguely,\" he said. \"Well, whatever you've heard is probably unfavorable and you're just being English and tactful in not mentioning Pound said with a piercing glance. \"Don't get too in-"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 93 terested in Lola Levine, if you want any advice from me, Sir John. She is said to be, or to have been, one of Crow- ley's countless mistresses. Terrible things happen to people who get involved with Crowley, or his friends or mis- tresses. Have you heard of Victor Neuberg?\" \"A young poet . . . I'm afraid I haven't read any of his work.\" \"Victor Neuberg got very involved with Crowley a few years ago,\" Pound said. \"He is now recovering, slowly and painfully, from a complete nervous and mental break- down.\" \"A mental breakdown,\" Sir John repeated. \"You mean . . .\" \"That's what the doctors call it,\" Pound said somberly. \"Neuberg believes he is under siege by demons.\" \"Oh,\" Sir John said, \"how ghastly.\" \"Yes,\" Pound answered with a level stare. \"That's the sort of thing that happens to people who get too close to Crowley and Lola Levine and their circle. Neuberg even claims Crowley once turned him into a camel.\" \"Into a camel?\" Sir John exclaimed. \"Well,\" Pound said, \"I suppose it would be more tradi- tional to turn him into a toad, but Crowley by all accounts has a singularly eccentric sense of humor.\" \"Do you believe Neuberg really did turn into a camel?\" Sir John asked, wondering just what Pound's attitude to- ward all this really was. \"Hellfire, no!\" Pound laughed scornfully. \"But I do be- lieve that if you get mixed up with a gang like that, and really get into yoga and meditation and group sex and drugs and howling invocations at Sirius, you'll damned soon end up believing whatever the other lunatics in the group believe.\" On that note, the lunch ended and they parted. Sir John found himself wondering if he was ready, yet, to believe in the metamorphosis of a human being into a camel. The idea seemed to belong not to the true tradition of mysticism as he had come to know it through the Golden Dawn, but to the realm of folklore, witchcraft and old-wives' tales: and yet the disquieting thought remained, trailing him about like an unpaid usurer, Something happened to poor Neu- berg, something that the alienists are perhaps not ready yet to understand or heal.

It was only another accident, of course — only another coincidence — but Sir John actually encountered Lola Le- vine in Rupert Street later that afternoon. There was no mistaking that dark brown hair, those strange brown eyes, that enticingly voluptuous figure to unhood the cobra of desire. By the grace of God, she didn't notice him and he passed by quickly, hardly thinking of her petticoats and garters and those things. That evening, however, he encountered her again, in a much more outre manner. He was performing his fourth exercise in astral projection for the day, according to the instructions in the Golden Dawn manual, and, for the third time since he had begun the practice, he achieved a state of mind where it almost believed it was real. [\"It seemed real,\" he had told Jones after the first such experience, \"but I cannot be sure. I think I am perhaps just deceiving myself and it is imagination.\" [\"Pray do not let that bother you,\" Jones had replied. \"It always begins as imagination. . . .\"] This time, Sir John, eyes tightly closed, was imagining his astral mind rising out of his body, looking down at the whole room — his physical body included — from some eerie vantage point near the ceiling, and beginning, again, to almost believe his imagination. Following instructions, he projected higher, above the earth, looking down at his estate from a great height, and then, projecting higher, looking down at England and parts of Europe. With a colos- sal effort, he projected higher and saw the blinding white light of the sun (behind the Earth at this hour) and the planets Mercury, Venus and Mars. It was going so well that he projected out of the solar system entirely and ap- proached the realms of Yesod, the first astral plane. And there it was, just as described in the Cabalistic books of many centuries: the two pillars of Night and Day, the masked Pn the throne: Shekinah, the bodied Glory of Jehovah. \"Who dares to approach this realm?\" She asked, Her"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 95 voice strangely familiar. (Or was he imagining all this? Was this practice just a trick to contact the unconscious by \"dreaming\" while still partly conscious?) \"I am one who seeks the Light,\" Sir John answered, ac- cording to formula. \"You have turned your back on the Light,\" She an- swered sharply, Her brown eyes seeming to shine or glow in an odd manner. \"You have rejected Me and banded to- gether with the Black Brothers who hate and despise My creation. Infernal nochts; rocks intangible.\" \"No, no,\" Sir John said, frantically reminding himself of the First Teaching [\"Fear is failure, and the forerunner of failure\"]. \"I have never rejected You/' \"You have rejected the female, My representatives on Earth, and the act of joy and love which is My Sacrament. You can never pass this Gate until you conquer your fear of Woman. Fear is failure and the forerunner of failure\" Sir John recognized Her voice at last: it was the voice of Lola Levine. Desperately, he plunged backward toward Earth, remembering to try to calm himself: when one is blinded by panic, the teachings said, one might not be able to find one's way back to the Earth-body. In total funk, he briefly found himself in one of the alchemical planes, where a White Eagle, a Red Lion, a Golden Unicorn and Sir Tal- ischlange pursued him through a magickal wood and the trees chanted rhythmically, \"Pangenitor, Panphage, Pan- genitor, Panphage, Pangenitor, Panphage . . .\" Lola's voice sang in antichorus, \"Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! Io Pan! Io Pan Pan!\" Then, somehow, he was whirling down, down, through endless darkness, to the White Light of the sun again, the spinning Earth-globe, England, his own estate, and the bedroom in which he found himself seated, sweating, with his heart beating wildly. He recited the great Mantra of protection*: \"Christ above me, Christ below me; Christ at my right side, Christ at my left side; Christ before me, Christ behind me; Christ within me.\" His back was cold from the sweat, and the astral heat burned his forehead; he was trembling. He repeated the Mantra three more times before he was able to feel safe again. \"If anything particularly glorious or particularly frighten- ing happens, write it down at once\" Jones had instructed him. \"That gets the linear, rational mind operating again — and the record will be useful to you, later.\""},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"96 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI Sir John performed a banishing ritual first, to be on the safe side, and then wrote the vision carefully in his Magick Diary. He added: // this was just my own unconscious mind playing tricks, it is still most interesting.

And the ideational con- tent of the chant — Pangenitor, all-creator; Panphage, all-destroyer — clearly indicates the identity of Pan and the Hindu god, Shiva, which is most curious, since I had never consciously understood that identity before this Vision. I can only conclude that the above attempt at re- ductionism is very forced and not really convincing. Deep down I know that what happened was not merely unconscious tricks of my mind. Because my heart is not pure, because I harbor lust and carnal desire, I missed the true gate of Yesod. / did not encounter Shekinah, the female component of Jehovah, as would have happened if my heart were clean. I encountered Ashtoreth, the female Devil, and true to Her nature, She attempted to psychically seduce me. Many al- chemists recorded similar meetings with the succubus, or female lust-demon. Sir John repeated his banishing ritual, and gave up on astral projection for the night. He allowed himself a rather stiff brandy, to relax, and another, even stiffer, brandy be- fore bedtime. We do not escape our demons that easily. Sir John dreamed many things, all of them voluptuous and sensual. He wandered through jeweled and many-colored harems where Victorian newbuggers in honeysuits with camelly pants engaged in vile, nameless perversions, obscenities he had encountered before only in the evasive Latin euphe- misms of KrafTt-Ebing. He was wandering through the gar- dens of his uncle, Viscount Grcystoke, and a dark serpen- tine Sicilian named Giao dine (who claimed to be related, distantly, to the Greystokcs, and, hence, to Sir John himself) was explaining earnestly something totally incom- prehensible about Sex and Creation. \"The male is space and"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 97 the female is time,\" Celine said, \"but, of course, the uni- verse itself is bisexual.\" The clowns and acrobats sang \"I Never Risk Inquiry,\" but Yeats and Sir John were back at Pound's flat Yeats whispered suggestively, \"The culprits are bears. It's always darkest just before the storm.\" He was leading Sir John to another garden, past the hall of infinitely reflecting mirrors, and the Countess of Soulsburied was waiting there for him, with a face much like Lola's. She was sprawled totally naked, except for a blue garter with a silver star, on her left thigh. Goldly nude on a crimson-jeweled Arabic purr- purplebed, her left hand lewdly moving in the grove of brown hair above that maddening garter, doing that horrid disgusting thing to herself, to gather per darker bane, a bolt like a brick sheet hose, her face flushed with the same un- bearable and inhuman rapture as the famous statue of Saint Teresa in Rome. \"To the puer, all things are puella,\" Yeats mumbled, vanishing with myriad reflections into infinite mirrors. Sir John threw himself upon Lola, kissing the garter rapturously, mad with hatred, love and desire, and she whispered, \"All things are Buddha. Evil to him who thinks evil of it.\" And her thighs were wrapping around him, suck- ing him down, down, down into ecstasy so intense he cared not if it were divine or diabolical. \"Little check on her? Liddel chick honor?\" Sir Talis Saur chanted. \"If god is dog spelled backward,\" he hissed, lisping, \"what does that mean? Not the Almighty?\" But Sir John was fucking a fox-bitch in heat, groveling in the mire: mind and heart and soul lost in the Night of Pan.

Now, he forced himself to read carefully and scrupulously, determined to understand the forces that might be attacking him. After all, he had been performing the Banishing Ritual for several months now, accepting Jones' bland explanation that the purpose was to banish all the impure parts of him- self that might interfere with the Great Work. But now he wondered if the real purpose might not be to banish forces or entities of which it were better that the Neophyte did not know, lest he succumb to the fear which was failure. He read of the nameless ritual of the Black Goat with a Thousand Young, of the fiery Serpent Power that could be raised from the aroused genitals to the brain itself by for- bidden sexual excesses, of the foul Eucharist of Immortal- ity drunk in unspeakable rites by those who would replace God by Man. With nausea and near-dizziness, he began to understand the Satanic logic behind this medley of filth, blasphemy and perverted transcendentalism — the secret Gnostic teaching that Neschek, the Serpent in Genesis, hav- ing the number 358, which is also the number of Messiah, the Serpent is the Messiah. (Since all words with the same Cabalistic value numerologically are names of the same metaphysical entity.) He learned the Manichean interpreta- tion of I.N.R.I. — Ingenio Numen Resplendet lacchi: the true God is Iacchus (Dionysus) — and the logic, although wicked, was clear to him: lewdness and prolonged sensu- ality, to this mad philosophy, were the essence of the ecstasy which could blot out ego and raise Man to God- hood. He was literally ill after a day of this research and trembled at the thought of the lunatics who believed such things and the deeds they would be willing to perform. Sir John decided to try the Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel, even though that was considered risky for those below the Grade of Master of the Temple. Nothing happened — except that the invocation unleashed"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"100 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI stronger fear and wilder hope than Sir John had ever be- fore experienced. But perhaps the intensification of emo- tion was all the Invocation could be expected to produce in a Probationer. But a few minutes after closing the ritual and breaking the circle, Sir John suddenly felt an impulse to write. What came from his pen was not an account of the invocation and its results, as he should have written if he had been following Jones' teachings, but rather a neoplatonic dialogue with the obsessing spirit of Lola Levine, the Black Priestess: CULPA URBIUM NOTA TERRAE I: This filthy, swinish philosophy, this black perversion of civilization and ordinary decency — how can you pos- sibly believe it is the path to higher wisdom, to the Over- Man?

It had truly become as if another spirit were writing through him; it was indecent, worse than the time a grop- ing pervert had fondled him on a train, when he was sixteen and too shy to cry out — he had pulled away furtively, ashy- faced; but this was a more vile, a more personal, invasion. He felt soiled and polluted. His mind was still racing with Lola's implanted heresies. \"I am the Lord: I create Good and I create Evil.\" \"When the Adept crosses the Abyss, all opposites become One to him.\" \"Brahman is the slayer and the slain.\" \"Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is One!\" \"ARARITA: One in His origin, One in His individuality, One in His permuta- tions.\" The Alchemist \"must descend to every depth, plunge into the fires of Hell, before he can accomplish the Great Work.\" Original Sin was the first dualism, \"the Accursed Dyad\" denounced by all Cabalists. \"All is One.\" \"All is Tao.\" \"All is Buddha.\" The mystics of all ages seemed to be on Lola's side. 358: the Messiah and the Serpent are One. That was the meaning (or one meaning) of those incoherent dreams about \"the tree Swifty ate.\" 358: one in His permutations, one in His origin. •The Devil can quote all the world's Scriptures,\" Sir John muttered. With a prayer for grace, he attempted Bibliomancy, the art of receiving divine guidance by opening the Bible at random, sticking in a finger, and reading the verse so dis- covered. He found that he had entered near the end of the New Testament and was in the Epistle of Jude. He read with great intensity: Clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withcreth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.

What more clear warning could there be against Lola Levine and the infamous Crowley and all those pseudo- mystics of this age who attempt to exalt sensuality as sacred and eroticism as holiness? But the Epistle con- tinued, growing even more explicit and speaking directly to the temptations Sir John had experienced: But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ; How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. Every word was like a flame eating into Sir John's con- science, revealing the horror of that which had almost seduced him. He wept with repentance and joy: he was saved.

The Chi- nese became a democratic republic. Amundsen reached the South Pole and excited the imagination of the world. Sir John, who more and more regarded himself as a Liberal, rejoiced when the House of Commons passed a bill grant- ing Home Rule to the Irish, and then wrote an angry letter to the Times when the House of Lords voted it down. A Dane named Niels Bohr electrified the scientific community by suggesting that quantum discontinuities caused the in- terior of the atom to follow Rutherford's model, similar to the solar system itself; and Sir John was amused that science was finally catching up with the traditional Hermetic teach- ing that \"the things above are reflected in the things below.\" Sir John himself had become, in many respects, a new man under the slowly rising Alchemical heat of celibacy and magick. He advanced from Neophyte to Zelator, from Zelator to Practicus. He was trained in asana, a yogic con- tortion that twisted the body just as Cabala twisted the brain, and emerged with better health, better self-control and better humor than ever. He also learned pranayama, a special breathing technique which seemed to vanquish most negative emotions and kept him vaguely euphoric most of the time. His study of Cabala, under Jones' merciless hounding, advanced to the point where it now seemed as natural to his mind as asana to his body; he could hardly remember how contorted and difficult both had seemed at first. And his journeys on the astral plane increasingly magnified his understanding of himself and others, even though he was still unsure much of the time whether these visions were real or imaginary. He even saw Lola Levine at a concert one night and was neither frightened nor attracted, although he couldn't help visualizing her thighs and garters. Then, one day in Soho, he was browsing through the shelves of used bookstalls and found a volume entitled Clouds Without Water. At this point, he no longer believed in coincidences: he knew that what the ignorant call by that name are actually occult clues which can instruct the Adept in important spiritual matters, once he had deci- phered their meaning. He picked up the book and began browsing.

After all, this was not a Black Magick grimoire, but only a collection of poems. He looked back at the title page: CLOUDS WITHOUT WATER Edited from a private MS. by the REV. C.

How silly of him to imagine Diabolism in a book put out by some Scottish Presbyterian. But what did those lines mean, then? Sir John skimmed a few more pages at random. The whole series of poems seemed to be a glorification — virtu- ally a sanctification— of adultery. This couldn't be. Then he saw a footnote by the Rev. Verey: Only a Latin dictionary can unveil the loathsome horror of this filthy word. Sir John looked back to the word thus indirectly defined, or rather not defined at all, and found it was fellatrix. He blushed; but then he remembered again: \"We found it early where the Gods find children.\" Could such nameless things be printed? In Sonnet VTH of the Alchemical sequence, he found the lines: Now I have told you all the ingredients That go to make the elixir for our shame Already make the fumes their spired ascents; The bubbles burst in tiny jets of flame The elixir of shame, he knew, was in Satanic theology the Eucharist of Immortality; it was found' only within the pudendum of a sexually ecstatic woman.

Verey had edited and commented upon this libertine volume, although it was still unclear if he truly understood what it was he was condemning. Certainly, if he thought these poems re- lated in any way to \"Atheism,\" he had missed the target by a mile. Sir John turned back to the section called \"The Al- chemist\" and searched carefully to see if his speculation about the \"elixir of shame\" was correct. He found in Son- net X: This wine is sovereign against all complaints, This is the wine the great king-angels use Sheer nausea overcame him. If the elixir or wine was what he suspected, the vile secretions of the organs of shame, the great \"king-angels\" were not those of heaven but of hell.

He was too naive to recognize the diabolism, the counter- theology that was actually being expressed. Sir John looked back again at the Preface, and found no clue to the identity of the author of these vile versifications, except that he had died of \"a loathsome disease.\" Verey added: / may perhaps he Named for publishing, even in this limited measure, such filthy and blasphemous orgies of human speech [save the mark] but I am firmly resolved [and I believe that I have the blessing of God on my work] to awake my fellow-workers in the great vine- yard to the facts of modern existence.

Skimming rapidly, Sir John found \"Lola\" in poem after poem, but never any last name. But in the very first sonnet he found in the closing line a Latin phrase that froze his blood: Evoe! lacche! consummatum est. There it was — Evoe, one of the two most hidden names of God (which Sir John had good reason to remember was known to Lola Levine); lacche, the vocative form of Iacchus, secret name of Dionysus, god of orgies; and con- summatum est, last words of the Mass. But this mad poet could only refer to a Black Mass, not a Catholic Mass, in this foul context of Dionysian revelry, perversion and anti- Christian blasphemy. How simpleminded was the Rev. Verey to imagine that these poems merely recorded the de- struction of a man drawn away from his lawful wife into an adulterous love affair, when they actually described the step-by-step initiation into the worship of the Horned God of sexual ecstasy — Panurgia, the god worshipped by the pagans before Christianity arose to unmask him (the God of This World) as Satan, adversary of the invisible True God, beyond the Stars. Sir John purchased Clouds Without Water and took it home for study. This might be a most serious matter. If it were truly what he suspected, he would have to consult Jones for advice.

It was a dream, only a dream, after all: such things as we are made of. Turning on the newly installed electric lights, Sir John sat up and wrote it all out carefully, in- cluding the jumbled Latin and Norman-French. Isis Na' turae Regina Ineffabilis: Isis, ineffable queen of nature. Some Egyptologists did claim that the Ankh cross, alleged origin of the Christian cross, showed the lingam of Osiris joining the yoni of Isis. The meaning was clear: the Black Brotherhood, after two years, was activated against him again, perhaps be- cause he had purchased Clouds Without Water and com- pleted a magickal link. Well, he was no longer an ignorant Probationer, he was a Practicus, fully armed with the weaponry of practical magick, unafraid. After breakfast, he would plunge directly into the heart of the new mystery. Meanwhile, he would not be deceived by a lying dream. The spirit haunting him was not Isis, al- though the \"virgin mother\" symbol was, of course, an allegory on ain soph, the limitless light of the white void behind matter itself according to Cabala. And Osiris-Jesus, the dead-and-resurrected son-lover of the virgin, Mother Void, was Man himself raised to superhumanity by the disciplines of magick and yoga.

Could all the king's horses and all the king's men put common sense back together again? The one hundred fourteen sonnets collected in Clouds Without Water told a blood-curdling story when Sir John had time to read them at leisure. The anonymous poet, a married man seemingly in his early twenties and with a university degree, meets the enigmatic Lola, who is then only seventeen. Stealthily and slowly, she seduces him, until he casts aside his wife, his reputation, his good name and all else to live in sin with her. The sonnets continue for quite a while to celebrate the joys of their lawless love, al- though only a student of Cabala could decode, behind the euphemistic erotic imagery, the actual Satanic practices into which the poet is being led. Lola's body becomes both God and the priestess and altar of God; the Christian divinity is denounced and mocked in increasingly bitter lines. The clergy are described, viciously, as \"blind worms\" and \"pious swine\" — to which Rev. Verey added a footnote, saying, \"The poor servants of God! Ah, well! We have our comfort in Him: like our blessed Lord, we can forgive.\" The climax is abrupt and shocking. The poet discovers that he has contracted syphilis — \"the recompense of his error which was meet,\" as Rev. Verey commented — and plunges into despair, killing himself with an overdose of laudanum. Rev. Verey concludes the volume with a warn- ing to others that Free Love and Socialism lead to countless similar tragedies every day in London, a city which he seemed to regard as being damnable as Sodom itself. Most shocking of all to Sir John was Sonnet VII of a sequence called \"The Hermit,\" dealing with a few weeks in which the poet was parted from Lola by relatives and friends who were attempting to end the illicit affair. The poet wrote: I will visit you, forlorn who lie Crying for lack of me; your very flesh Shall tingle with the touch of me as I Wrap you about with the ensorcelled mesh Of my fine body of fire: oh! you shall feel My kisses on your mouth like living coals Even Rev.

His footnote said explicitly, \"This disgusting sonnet seems to refer to the wicked magickal practice of traveling by the astral double.\" Sir John sighed, remembering his own travels in \"the body of fire\" (as the astral double is technically called) and his own terrifying encounter with Lola Levine, in which she had dragged his unconscious body into unwilling sin. For many days Sir John pondered and worried. Finally, he decided that he must act, and he carefully penned a letter to Rev. Verey at the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in Inverness, Scotland. He chose his words most carefully: Bab cock Manor Greystoke, Weems July 23, 1913 Dear Rev. Verey, I have recently acquired a copy of your sad and terrible book, Clouds Without Water, and was very moved by the tragedy recounted therein. Before proceeding further, I must in honesty inform you that I am not, as you are, a Presbyterian; but I am a fellow Christian and I hope [and pray] a devout and pious one. What I have to tell you will be shocking and perhaps incredible to you but 1 beg you to think deeply and ponder long before rejecting my most som~ ber warning. I know not how you came into possession of those terrible poems, and I can understand [although some bigots would not] why you considered it proper to print them, with a running commentary showing the dreadful results of the life and philosophy celebrated by the unfortunate poet. However, I do not think this book should ever have been published, and I fear that you have touched upon an evil far worse than you realized. Briefly, I am a student of Christian Cabalism, and, although loathing with all my heart the perversions of Cabala employed by diabolists, I have of necessity learned a few things about their beliefs and practices. You may find this hard to credit, but the poet is not describing merely an adulterous love affair; he is, in fact, depicting — in a kind of code, but in a manner clear to students of these matters — the horrible prao"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"116 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI tices of what is called Left-Hand Tantra or sex-magick; the devices, in short, of the Black Mass and of Sa- tanism. I am writing to you because it is obvious that the wicked woman who led the poet into these fiendish paths [called only Lola in the text] must be an initiate of a cult of black magicians. Such groups, I assure you, do not relish having their secrets published, even in code — especially when the code is, as in this case, quite transparent to any student of Cabalistic occult- ism. Without wishing to alarm you unnecessarily , I think it possible that this cult may wish to suppress the book, even though your Society circulated it only to ministers of religion, since it is now beginning to appear in the used bookstalls [which is where I found my copy]. It is even possible that they may seek re- venge upon you. If you do not dismiss this letter as the ravings of a superstitious fool, I wish to offer you my friendship and aid, in case such black magick action against you is being taken or plotted. Until I hear from you, I can only conclude: May the blessings of our Lord be upon you, and surround you, and protect you. Sincerely, Sir John Babcock After posting this missive, Sir John began to have serious doubts about whether a Scottish Presbyterian would, or would not, credit the continued existence of Satanic lodges in the modern world. He also wondered if he had acted prematurely; but Jones was on holiday in France and Sir John had no one else to advise him. A few nights later. Sir John visited his cousins, the Grey- stokes, and met again the aged Sicilian, Giacomo Celine, who seemed to be related to a South European branch of the family. Somehow, the conversation turned to ghost stories after the brandy and cigars were circulating. \"Lewis' The Monk is still the most blood-curdling book ever written,\" Sir John ventured at one point. \"Rut that's technically not a ghost story at all,\" Viscount Grc remarked. *'It\\ a itory of demon \\t course,\" old Celine said. \"Ghost stories really are"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 117 quite dull, actually.

Ghosts are com- paratively tame compared with the real horrors a lively imagination can conjure up.\" 'That reminds me,\" old Greystoke said, \"there's a nov- elette around that is more terrible than anything we've dis- cussed, and it has no ghosts, either. Ghosts, after all, are only dead humans, and humans can be wicked enough as we all know, but it's the non-human creature of evil that really makes the blood run cold, as the saying goes. The non-human is not limited by the traits which even ghosts share with us.\" \"Quite so,\" Sir John agreed. \"And what is the name of this novelette?\" \"Oh, here it is,\" Greystoke replied, prowling among his bookcases. \"If you want a bad night, try reading this before bed.\" And he handed Sir John a slim volume of stories entitled The Great God Pan, by Arthur Machen.

The Great God Pan tells of two men, Clarke and Villiers, who share a common interest in the bizarre and mysterious side of London life. Although Clarke and Villiers do not join forces until the climax of the story, each of them finds, working independently of the other, parts of the history of a most strange and dangerous wom- an, called \"Helen\" in the text. In each chapter, either Clarke or Villiers encounters a victim of this woman, or hears a yarn of incredible events which seems to relate to her mysterious doings. When Villiers and Clarke finally intersect each other's investigations and begin to compare notes, most of the truth begins to emerge, although not all of it, since Machen restricts himself to hints and euphe- misms. What is clear, however, is that \"Helen\" is a wor- shipper of the Horned God, who has lured countless men and women into unspeakable erotic practices — sexual ex- cesses leading at first to ecstasy and then to a chain of nervous breakdowns and suicides. It could almost be the story of Lola Levine; and Sir John wondered if it were, in fact, her story. How much of Machen's terrifying tale was fiction, and how much fact? Why had Machen published, even as fic- tion and even with the worst of it veiled in vague hints, so many dreadful secrets which the world was better not to know at all? Why had the Secret Chiefs of the Order al- lowed Machen to publish this dreadful tale, for that mat- ter? Sir John found himself thinking, without humor, of the Rev. Verey's dark warnings that the world was entering the last days and the final conflict between Good and Evil would soon be upon us all. The Greystokes, who had fam- ily connections in every branch of the government, it often seemed, were worried more and more lately about the pos- sibility of a greater war than the world had ever known. . . . Sir John uneasily climbed out of bed and looked again at the most disturbing passage in Clouds Without Water, in which the Rev. Verey said: Unblushing, the old Serpent rears its crest to the sky; unashamed, the Beast and the Scarlet Woman chant the blasphemous litanies of their fornication.

Why did the first teaching say so harshly, \"Fear is failure, and the forerunner of failure,\" if the members were not expected, eventually, to confront the most fearful evils and do battle against them? Sir John performed a most earnest banishing ritual, drank a double shot of cognac, and crept back to bed, severely troubled in his mind. His dreams were not pleasant. The Hermit carrying a rotlantern was leading him down a Naranhope alley in some low, disreputable neighborhood of London. Orofaces out of Hogarth's etchings and Dore's illustrations of Dante's Inferno glared gorm on all sides; Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas rose up from a violet cellar muttering incoherently, \"the love of Jesus and John . . . the love of David and Jonathan . . . the love that dare not speak its name.\" The Hermit began to fondle Sir John on the rougeway carriage again and a terrific explosion shook the vertetrain. \"They are dropping bombs from monoplanes P somebody shouted. \"The Anti-Christ is com- ing: Night, the Almighty. London is aflame!\" Voices sang the Internationale and looters ran through the streets carry- ing indigo garters and boxes with moving pictures on them. \"It's probably a magnetic phenomenon,\" old Celine said reassuringly. \"I Never Risk Inquiry.\" And this is the horror, said Eutaenia Infernalis, and this is the Mystery of the great prophets that have come unto mankind, Moses, and Buddha, and Lao-Tse, and Krishna, and Jesus, and Osiris, and Christian Rosy cross; for all these attained unto Truth, and therefore were they hound with the curse of Thoth, so that, being guardians of Truth, they caused the proliferations of countless lies: for the Truth may not be uttered in the languages of men.

They were playing hide-and-seek. The Cuntease of Salisbury entered the room. He backed farther into the rear of the closet, behind his mother's skirts. The Cuntess opened the door and groped him by the throat. He tried to tell her to stop, but he was choking and could not speak. Then he knew it was Lola again. \"You've been a bad boy,\" she said, \"playing with blue garters and your mother's skirts.\" She flung him to the floor, where Count Draculatalis leaned over him to whisper in his ear, \"The true Eucharist is the Eucharist of blood, the lunar force unleashed upon earth once a month. Take ye and drink.\" Hooded, red-eyed figures crouched around the garden chanting, \"Io Io Io Sabao Kurie Abrasax Kurie Meithras Kurie Phalle. Io Pan Io Pan Pan Io Ischuron Io Athanaton Io Abroton Io IAO. Chaire Phalle Chaire Panphage Chaire Pangenitor. Hagios Hagios Hagios IAO!\" Oscar Wilde, wearing Sherlock Holmes' deerstalker cap, bent to examine Sir John's penis through a magnifying glass. \"It is very, very long,\" he pronounced solemnly, \"but very, very beautiful.\" A form was crystallizing in the dank air: a dark blue ribbon edged with gold, a mantle of blue velvet, a collar of gold consisting of twenty-six pieces, Saint George fighting the dragon . . . And Pan, ithyphallic and terrible, arose in the midst of them, Lola bending to present his vile gigantic organ with an obscene kiss. \"Charing Cross, Jeering Cross!\" the conductor shouted. \"All mystics off at Charing Cross!\" But on the platform, everybody was staring and Sir John realized he was wearing his mother's skirt. \"Sonly a beach of a pair to plumb this hour's gripes,\" muttered the fox, but John Peel lit a great flashing light with a goat sow gorm in the morning and Sir John blinked, shuddering into wakefulness as warm sunlight flooded his bedroom. It was dawn and the nieht and night's black agents had vanished into air, into thin air. Sir John ate a very subdued breakfast. \"A war between the great powers,\" Viscount Greystoke had said, extremely worried, only a few weeks ago, \"might d^troy European civilization, or throw us back into the Dark Ages.\" Was it possible that the dark, chthonic forces of the ancient pagan"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"122 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI cults, the beings that Lola and her friends were trying to unleash again upon the world, intended such a frightful transformation of what had been an age of enlightenment and progress? Or was he taking the chaotic symbolism of the dream, a feverish blend of the worst in Gothic fiction and black magick, too literally? He decided to take a long walk around his estate, medi- tating on one of his favorite lines from the Golden Dawn Probationer ritual: \"We worship thee also in the forms of bird and beast and flower through which thy beauty is manifest even in the material world.\" His eyes opened as he repeated the phrase over and over: every bird call seemed to remind him that God was truly good, that even on the plane of accursed material existence the divine radi- ance showed itself to those with spiritual vision. The deer were the gaiety of God, the trees His mercy, the streams His ever-flowing love. A strutting robin came pecking the ground near him and he watched it with affection. It was a creature, he suddenly realized, more alien to himself than the Martians imagined in the fantastic fiction of H. G. Wells, and yet sentient as he and with its own intelligence. How can we live among so many wonders and be so blind to them? Sir John re- membered the great Psalm: \"The heavens declare the glory of God and the earth sheweth His handiwork.\" Then he saw two foxes copulating and blushed, turning his eyes away from the temptation to lewd thoughts. We must love the beauty of this world, which is God's gift, he reminded himself, but we must never forget its fallen nature nor let it seduce us from seeking the beauty of the spiritual world of which this is the grossest shadow. For to worship re as it is was to fall into the error of the sensualists and Satanists, of \"Helen\" in The Great God Pan. Sir John returned to the volume when he was back in his i y and had read two more of Machen's macabre tales, \"The Black Seal\" and \"The White People.\" Both dealt with ancient Celtic lore of the facry-people, but not in the sentimentalized manner which Shakespeare had established nimcr Night's Dream and The Tempest and h has been naively copied by writers ever since. Rather, followed the actual lore of the peasantry of Ire- land and Wales, to whom the \"little people\" were not t all but a terrifying inhuman race of malign s who lured men with vistas of beauty and sublime"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 123 wonder only to lead them into a realm of unreality, chang- ing chimerical shapes, formless forms, time distortions and nightmare, from which few returned totally sane. Sir John, who had studied this lore in his investigations of medieval myth, realized that Machen's picture of faery-folk was far truer to peasant belief than the charming fantasies of other writers on the subject. The Irish, Sir John remembered, called the faery \"the good people,\" not out of real love or respect, but out of terror, because these godlings were known to punish most terribly those who slighted them. The faery, Machen obviously understood, were denizens of Chapel Perilous unleashed somehow from the astral realm into temporary appearance in our material world. In fact, \"Helen\" in The Great God Pan was first reported to Clarke as a small child in Wales allegedly seen playing with one of these terrible creatures. Sir John pondered much on all this; but when the day's mail arrived, he saw that it contained a letter from Rev. Verey, Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth, Inverness, Scotland. He opened the envelope with a quick, nervous rip and read: Sir John Bab cock Babcock Manor Greystoke, Weems My Dear Sir John, I must thank you sincerely, as a Brother in Christ, for the concern and compassion expressed in your letter of recent date. Needless to add, our theological differences do not matter — / am no old-fashioned fa- natic, I hope — and I recognize all true Christians [which does not include, of course, the accursed Pa- pists] as fellow toilers in the vineyard for our Blessed Saviour. To come to the point at once, I am neither aston- ished nor incredulous about your claims concerning the vile sonnets in Clouds Without Water. Indeed, I am only astonished at my own blindness in refusing to see, at first, the full extent of the horrors there uttered.

It is all too true — Arthur mocked our holy religion continually after attending the damnable university of Cambridge [which is staffed almost entirely, as you must be aware, by men whose Socialism and Atheism are concealed barely enough to avoid public scandal] — but I, God forgive me, I was too fond, too forgiving a brother to admit even to myself that Arthur's youth\" ful rebellion had carried him far beyond the super- ficial Free Thought of most \"intellectuals\" of our time r into the very pits of Diabolism. Even after his suicide, when the poems came into my hands through our fam- ily solicitor, I refused to see that the mockery of Jesus [and of the clergy of our holy religion] was not merely that of a skeptic but of a Satanist. If you have a younger brother of keen intellect and wayward nature, you may perhaps understand my folly, my sentimental blindness. Well, sir, that is old business, and now I am paying the price of my delusion, and paying at usury. There is no doubt that diabolical forces have mounted an at- tack against my church, my family and myself. Things have happened around these parts lately that would cause all \"advanced thinkers?' to laugh me to scorn, and alienists to commit me to an asylum, if I were so foolish as to speak of them in this materialistic age.

Perhaps you may need more help than I. \"The perfect damned fool!\" Sir John cried aloud. But he re-read the letter more slowly and found himself strangely touched by the old man's simple faith and unpretentious bravery. Vexings, hauntings and that \"bat-winged\" Creature could not make very comfortable living in a lonely old church on Loch Ness. Sir John sat down, calmed himself, and then wrote a most unrestrained and tactful second letter to the Rev. Verey. He pointed out that his offer of help was somewhat presumptuous; he acknowledged the power of faith to hold at bay the agents of darkness and Old Chaos; he praised the courage of Verey, not too unctuously, so as to evade any suspicion of flattery; and then he got down to business. He explained his interest in Verey's problems as part of a larger research project, in which he was attempting to learn the scope and powers of the cults of black magick in the contemporary world; he waxed rhetorical, declaring that a book on this subject, which he hoped to write, might \"awaken Christendom to the ever-present activities of the Old Enemy it is currently inclined to forget\"; he begged for specific details on the problems besetting the Verey household and environs. When Sir John took this out to the box to post it, he felt a sudden cold bite in the air and his mood abruptly turned against him. It was not really wise, perhaps, to plunge into matters of this sort without Jones being around to advise him. Why, if anything too serious resulted, he had no way of contacting the higher officials of the Order, except through that post office box in London, which might not be picked up more than once in a fortnight.

All mixed up with Mother Goose and the Order of Saint George. When he went down to breakfast he found the morning post had already arrived and contained a letter, in shaky handwriting, from the Society for the Propagation of Reli- gious Truth. He opened it immediately and read: My Dear Sir John, \"Pride goeth before a fall.\" How much more profound do the words of Holy Writ appear to me each year, and how dim and un- dependable my own weak human reasonings! I admit that I am truly afraid at last. To confess such fear is more of a humiliation than you can imagine; at least, it is so for a stubborn old Scotsman like myself. To provide the chronological narrative you re- quested: 1 suppose, in some sense, the whole evil cloud began to gather about me as soon as I printed that accursed volume of my young brother's blasphemous verses. For instance, our local monster — \"Nessie,\" as the farmers call her — has never been so active as in the four years since that book appeared. Where, in earlier times, this gigantic serpentine form was only reported rarely, and usually by persons whose sobriety was at least questionable, in these recent years the monster in the Loch has been seen increasingly often, and by many persons, and groups of persons, who must be regarded as of the highest probity and sin- cerity of character. As you are perhaps aware, the mat' ter of Nessie is no longer an obscure rumor among us Highlanders but is increasingly discussed in the news- papers throughout the U.K. and, I hear, even on the Continent. Since my church faces directly toward the Loch — being situated where River Ness empties into Loch Ness — it is not wholesome, I assure you, to lie awake nights and wonder what is out there and why it has become so active lately.

But young Murdoch was known to me as a boy of higher than normal intelligence, adventurous spirits and emotional stability.

Now this is most inconclusive, but for that very reason it disturbs me oddly. This personage — whether he were Chinese or Japanese or some other bar- barian is in much dispute among those who met him — arrived in Inverness about a month after the inci- dent of the Ferguson boy and the faery-creature. He visited at least two dozen families ', always arriving at night in a black carriage. He wore Western clothing, all in black, and spoke a kind of English that was of neither the upper nor the lower classes — an unin- fected, almost mechanical English, the witnesses say. He always requested directions to my church and then lingered a while to ask sly and seemingly point- less questions about myself, my wife and my older brother, Bertran. On taking his leave, this heathen in black always said, in the most peculiar way, \"Evil to him who thinks evil.\" The strangest part of this story is that, although he always asked how to reach my church, he never did arrive here, although these visits to neighbors occurred over a period of more than two months. What is even stranger, however, is that, although everybody this Oriental visited saw his black carriage distinctly, nobody else ever saw such a carriage trav- eling these back roads in daytime or at night. It is as if he and the carriage materialized from nowhere before each visit, and then dematerialized afterward — although I know that remark may sound as if I am beginning to let my imagination run envoy with me.

The evil \"wee people\" whose contact has the power to disrupt totally the normal functioning of the human brain, abolish- ing space and time as we know them . . . the Creature so many had seen in Loch Ness ... a bat-winged mon- strosity that tittered in a human-like voice ... Sir John found himself re-reading Verev's letter several times, with growing apprehension and disquiet. \"The mind has both a rational and an irrational aspect,\" Jones had said, long ago, and Sir John had seen enough of the reasonless denizens of Chapel Perilous to fear their power, to know that they could on occasion cross over into the material universe and disrupt its normal laws entirely. Sir Walter Scott had written of these creatures in his famous Letters on Witchcraft, and Sir John found himself recalling, over and over, a phrase from Scott about \"the crew that never rests.\" Finally, he went to the library to look up the actual passage. Scott explained that \"glamour\" originally meant illusion, as every etymologist knows, and went on to discuss the abrupt way in which the elamour cast by these creatures could turn into sudden loathsome hor- ror — as had perhaps happened to the poor Ferguson lad. Scott wrote: The youne knights and beautiful ladies showed them- selves [as the glamour faded] wrinkled and odio hags. The stately halls were turned into miserable damp caverns — all the delights of the Elfin Elysium van- ished at once. In a word, their pleasures were showy but totally unsubstantial — their activity unceasing, but fruitless and unavailing — and their condemnation ap- pears to have consisted in the necessity of maintain- ing the appearance of industry or enjoyment, though their toil was fruitless and their pleasures shadowy and unsubstantial. Hence poets have designated them as \"the crew that never rests.\" Besides the unceasing and useless bustle in which these spirits seemed to live, they had propensities unfavourable and distressing to mortals. Sir John remembered his own first contact with the \"crew that never rests.\" Midway between dream and astral vision: the huge, incomprehensible machinery, the incessant mut- tering of nonsense phrases. . . . \"Mulligan Milligan Hooli-"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"134 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATT gan Halligan\" and all the rest. Cabala referred to them as the qliphothic entities — souls of those who had died insane; orthodox Christian theology simply called them demons; in Tibet, they were known as Tulpas, and usually appeared in solid black garb like the mysterious \"Oriental\" who had gone about Inverness asking questions about the Verey household; to the American Indians, they were allies or avatars of Coyote, the prankster-god, or of the mysterious \"people from the stars\"; there seemed to be no part of the Earth in which they did not appear in horrified tales of malign humor, regarded as myth only by those who had never personally encountered them. Sir John remembered suddenly that the very word \"panic\" is derived from the name of the Great God Pan; and that the ancients believed that any close encounter with Him or His cohort of satyrs and nymphs — the crew that never rests — was more likely to lead to madness than to ecstasy, or that the ecstasy could easily turn to madness. The traditional old ballad \"Thomas the Rhymer\" came back to him, seeming not quaint at all but stealthily sinister: And see ye not yon bonny road That winds aboon the f ernie brae? That is the road to fair Elfland Where you and I this night maun gae. He remembered that William Blake, the poet, had soberly told friends of seeing a faery procession in his own garden once; that Sir Walter Scott seriously reported on a man he described as \"a scholar and a gentleman\" who in- sisted he had observed faery rings — circles of mushrooms where the weird folk were said to dance — and had seen imprints of small feet within them; that the folklorist Rev. S. Baring-Gould had sworn to an encounter, in 1838, in which \"legions of dwarfs about two feet high\" had circled his carriage and ran laughing alongside it for some distance, then vanished \"into thin air\" in the traditional manner; that as recently as 1907 Lady Archibald Campbell had re- ported a case of a man and wife, in Ireland, who had cap- tured a \"faery\" and held it prisoner two weeks before it escaped.

Remembering, too, the great blind spot of the eighteenth century, the much-vaunted Age of Reason, when science, unable to explain meteorites, had dogmatically declared that there were no meteorites; and when meteorites con- tinued to fall and were reported by farmers and Bishops and tradesmen and housewives and philosophers and mayors and thousands of independent witnesses, including even dis- sident scientists, the French Academy and the Royal Scien- tific Society blandly dismissed each report as hoax or hallu- cination; thinking, just as today the continuing activities of the crew that never rests, reported weekly from someplace or other in the daily press and investigated with painstaking care by the Society for Psychic Research, are also dis- missed as hoaxes or hallucinations. Belief in Verey's letter was impossible to resist: though the dwarf and the alleged \"Oriental\" in black and even the bat-winged Thing that tittered were all glamours, phantasms, illusions, yet the force, the malign intelligence, behind these phenomena was something humanity had confronted from before the dawn of history and could not, ever, escape. Since his first researches into medieval magick, Sir John had vacillated between real belief, pretended-belief, real skepticism and pretended-skepticism. Now he no longer could resist simple uncomplicated belief. The Great God Pan was still alive, two thousand years after Christianity had correctly recognized and denounced Him as the devil; and his kith and kin were active all about us, even if they remained as invisible to educated opinion as meteorites to the intelligentsia of Voltaire's age."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"136 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI ACTION SOUND EXTERIOR.

Thrice the stifling wind had faltered, almost sub- sided: thrice it had resumed, hot and foul as ever: people's tempers were growing short. Einstein, Joyce and Babcock were together again, this time in Einstein's study, having agreed to meet there at three. The professor was the most chipper of the trio, being recuperated from the long night with the aid of only a few hours' sleep and the intellectual stimulation of teaching his noon physics class. Joyce was still somewhat hung over, and looked it. Babcock, after drowsing fitfully on a divan in Joyce's sitting room for most of the morning, was only a little less desperate than the previous night. \"Well, Jeem,\" Einstein began, \"what do you make of our friend's remarkable adventures, speaking honestly?\" \"Speaking honestly?\" Joyce repeated. \"I begin to ask myself whether that is possible.\" Einstein said nothing; but his glance mutely invited Joyce to continue. \"Once,\" Joyce said thoughtfully, \"a fair named Araby came to Dublin. I was perhaps ten at the time and devour- ing all sorts of romantic literature about the mysterious East, the secrets of the Sufis, the magick of the Dervishes, Aladdin and Ali Baba and much more of that sort. Can you imagine what the word 'Araby' connoted to me? My eagerness and excitement as the day of the fair approached were of the same order as my emotions, a few years later, when I nerved myself to enter the Red Light District and seek a prostitute for the first time.

The silence stretched out until Joyce spoke again. \"Mr. William Butler Yeats and his friends,\" Joyce said simply, \"live in Araby. It is real to them. More real than their servants, certainly. We go forth each day into the world of experience but we do not go mentally naked like Adam in Eden. We bring certain fixed ideas along whether we go to the corner pub, to a fair called Araby, or to the South Pole with Amundsen, I dare say. If a pickpocket enters this room he will see pockets to be picked; if Socrates were to be ushered in by the fair Mileva\" — he bowed chivalrously toward the kitchen, where Mrs. Einstein could be heard puttering — \"Socrates would see minds to be probed with annoying questions. If Mr. Yeats were here, he would see mere material shadows of the Eternal Spiritual Ideas known as Science,\" indicating Einstein, \"Art,\" indi- cating himself ironically, \"and Mysticism,\" indicating Sir John. '7 see three people with different life histories,\" he concluded abruptly. \"All of which,\" Einstein asked drily, \"is your way of saying that the Golden Dawn people seem no more mad to you than anybody else?\" \"I am saying,\" Joyce replied, \"that I can see the world as Yeats and the occultists do — as a spiritual adventure full of Omens and Symbols. I can also see it, if I choose, as the Jesuits taught me to see it in youth: as a vale of tears and a web of sin. Or 1 can see it as a Homeric epic, or a de- pressing naturalistic novel by Zola. I am interested in seeing all of its facets Sir John leaned forward, suddenly interested. \"I think I begin to understand you a bit,\" he said. \"You are saying that I am living in a Gothic novel, while you prefer to live in a Zola novel \" \"Not that at all,\" Joyce said. \"The Zola school is one- dimensional. 1 am seeking multi-dimensional vision. I wish to see deeply into Gothic novels, Zola novels and all other masquerades, and then beyond them i Hmstein. \"Fascinating.\" The other two looked at him expectantly. f Araby,\" Einstein said to Joyce, \"re- minds me cm ^le of my own.

Since we do not imagine that we are inside an elevator, but are educated in physics and curious about our environment, we begin to conduct experiments. We find that objects dropped from our hands fall to the floor. We find further that if the ob- jects are thrown horizontally instead of dropped, they also fall, but in a parabola. We find, in fact, that as we experi- ment and write the simplest possible mathematical equa- tions to describe our observations, we can derive the whole Newtonian theory of gravity. We decide that beneath this box in which we find ourselves is a planet which 'draws' objects to it.\" \"Is that true?\" Joyce asked, startled. \"It is more wonder- ful than anything you have told me of your theories thus far.\" \"I am in the process of proving it,\" Einstein said, \"in a paper I'm writing. Now, it so happens that one physicist in the room, or the elevator, by some strange process of creative reorganization of sense-data — perhaps akin to these mind-bending Cabalistic experiments of the Golden Dawn people — has made the leap to another way of thinking. He conceives of the room as an elevator and imagines the cable and the machinery that is rapidly drawing us upward. He sits down and performs his own experiments and writes his own equations. He derives eventually the whole theory of inertia as found in classical mechanics. There is no planet beneath us at all, he decides. \"Now,\" Einstein said, \"we are in the predicament that the doors are locked and we cannot get out of the room. How do we determine who has the correct explanation of the lawful phenomena that we observe — those who attribute them to gravity [a planet beneath us], or the one who attrib- utes them to inertia [a cable above us, pulling us through free zero-gravity space]?\" \"Oh, I say,\" Babcock murmured, \"that is a bit of poser, isn't it?\" \"Both are correct, in a sense,\" Joyce said firmly. \"If both systems of equations will describe our situation, there is no reason to prefer one over the other, except esthetic pref- erence. Within the terms of the problem we can never see the planet beneath us or the cable above us. You set us up for the wrong answer by telling the situation from the point of view of the man outside.\""},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"144 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINAT1 \"Precisely,\" Einstein said. \"Any coordinate system acts like the room I was talking about, and if there is an out- side observer we cannot scientifically know it. From inside the room — inside any coordinate system — there is no way of saying whether gravity or inertia is the true explanation of the phenomena we observe. It is the same with Sir John's narrative — that is to say, it is either a random series of odd coincidences and Freudian dream symbols, given a totally artificial meaning by Sir John's occult beliefs, or it is a series of real occult Omens, depending on the interpreta- tion of the observer.\" \"Precisely,\" Joyce said. \"I can do as well as Sir John, in the department of odd coincidences. For instance, my first teaching job was at a school on Vico Road in Dublin. More recently, in Trieste, I have had to walk the Via Giam- battista Vico twice a day, to go to and from the home of one of my language students. Then I had a student who was fascinated by Vico's theory of the cycle in history. Natural- ly, I became interested in the life and philosophy of Vico after all that, and I found numerous parallels with my own life and thought, so that now everything I write is in- fluenced by Vico. You may interpret this sequence in what- ever way you choose. Either, Unum, the gods arranged for me to encounter Vico's name over and over in order to influence my writing; or, Duum, it was mere coincidence, and I gave it meaning by taking it seriously. There is no way of proving either hypothesis to the man who insists on seeing it the other way.\" \"Not quite,\" Einstein said sharply. \"When it becomes possible to choose between two theories, we should choose the one that best accords with the facts. Or, we should de- velop a higher-order theory that reconciles the differences between the two conflicting interpretations — as I am trying to do with this gravity and inertia conundrum. Without such creative effort to make our concepts square with our per- cepts, our thought if just an exercise in wish fulfillment.\" A skeptical noise from Babcock caused Einstein to look at him expectantly. \"Surprising as it may be,\" Babcock said wearily, \"I agree with all you gentlemen have said. One of the first lessons 1 learned in the Golden Dawn is that perception depends on the mind of the observer, just as what is revealed through a lens depends on the angle of refraction.

What remains to be determined is whether they can actually manipulate the physical universe with their, um, magick, or whether they are merely superlatively clever at manipu- lating the minds of the human beings on whom they prey. In that connection, we would both be most interested to hear the rest of your story.\" \"Yes,\" Joyce said. \"I certainly want you to get on with it. I have already formed a tentative hypothesis about what is actually afoot here — behind all the masques and mas- querades — and I would be most intrigued to learn whether that theory will mesh with the subsequent facts.\" \"Very well,\" said Sir John. \"To proceed, then.\" And, as the Fbhn wind continued to batter the window, he told Joyce and Einstein a tale that confounded all their expectations. DE ILLUMINATORUM OPERIBUS DIVERSIS Sir John found Verey's letter about the bat-winged crea- ture so disturbing that he determined to learn all he could about the enigmatic Aleister Crowley — the man described by Jones as the leader of a false Golden Dawn lodge dedi- cated to licentiousness and black magick; the lover of Lola Levine, according to Ezekiel (or Ezra or Jeremiah) Pound; the wizard who had perhaps once turned Victor Neuberg into a camel; and, in Sir John's growing suspicions, the human channel through which the crew that never rests had been set loose upon the Verey family. He began at the British Museum, uneasily recalling the dream in which he had encountered Karl Marx there and heard a confusing history of Freemasonry all muddled to- gether with the assassination of Julius Caesar. Reviews of Current Literature for the past decade re- vealed that Crowley was the author of more than a dozen volumes of poetry, every one of which had received un- commonly mixed reviews. The critic in The Listener did not seem at all to be able to make up his mind about one"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"146 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI of Crowley's volumes, The Sword of Song, describing it as \"fearless,\" \"serious and intrepid\" and \"increasingly repel- lent\" in a single paragraph. The Seeker was more charitable: \"Crowley has been reproached in some thoughtless or malicious quarters. ... It is undoubtedly no easy task to follow the royal bird in his dazzling flight\"; while The Clarion frankly gave up in despair: \"We must confess that our intelligence is not equal to the task.\" The Cambridge Review was simply furious at another Crowley volume, complaining that it was \"obscene,\" \"revolting\" and a \"monstrosity\" that \"demands an emphatic protest from lovers of literature and decency.\" The Arboath Herald, like the Clarion, surrendered to despair, designating Crow- ley's verse as \"so clever one finds some of it utterly unin- telligible.\" The Atheist, on the other hand, grudgingly praised Crowley while denouncing him: \"Far as we are from admiring his dreamy romanticism, yet his staunch denial of the supernatural, the divine, the mystical must command our respect\"; but, paradoxically, the Prophetic Mercury found the same verses hopeful for the opposite reason, saying, \"The ever-present sense of God in the mind of the poet leads us to the prayerful hope that one day he may be enlightened.\" Again the Yorkshire Post was simply aghast: \"Mr. Crowley's poetry, if such it may be called, is not serious\"; but the Literary Guide was rhapsodic: \"A masterpiece of learning and satire.\" q: Give a succinct and representative example of the con- troversial verse of Mr. Crowley. a: From Konx Om Pax, 1907: Blow the tom-tom, bang the flute!

Sir John next tried the newspapers. In the Times for 1909^ — the year Sir John himself had graduated from Cam- bridge and the mad Picasso had shocked the Paris art world with his first incomprehensible \"Cubist\" painting — Crowley had been involved in a lawsuit with MacGregor Mathers. The Times reporter was not sympathetic to either Crowley or Mathers, but Sir John was able to gather that the ostensible purpose of the trial — Mathers' attempt to prevent Crowley from publishing, in a magazine called The Equinox, certain rituals of the original Golden Dawn — was only an excuse to air the real conflict between them, which hinged on the fact that each claimed to be the real head of the Invisible College of the Rosicrucians. Well, that was hardly news to Sir John; Jones had told him that Crowley, Mathers and others were operating fake Rosi- crucian lodges in competition with the real Golden Dawn. The judge, Sir John learned with amusement, refused to allow the trial to degenerate into a debate about such claims, which by their very nature could not be settled in an ordinary law court, and had merely ruled that Mathers had no authority to prevent Crowley from publishing docu- ments of unknown age and authorship which both litigants admitted, and even stipulated, were written by superhuman intelligences unwilling to take corporeal form to testify on their own behalf. Sir John was also amused to find that Mathers, under cross-examination, was forced to confess that he had, on occasion, alleged himself to be the reincarnation of King Charles I. He also found a clue to further information about Crowley in a casual remark, during the testimony, indicating that Crowley regarded himself as the world's greatest living mountain climber. A visit to the Alpine Club quickly brought vehement denials of that claim. \"Aleister Crowley,\" said the Club's secretary, a Mr. Mortimer, \"is the world's greatest living braggart. None of his climbs is accepted as authenticated by us.\" But further questioning soon produced the usual ambiguity that seemed to cling to Crowley like fog to the London streets: it was obvious that the feud between Crow-"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"14B MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATT ley and the Alpine Club went all the way back to the 1890s and that both sides had accused the other of lying so often that an outside observer could not form an impartial judg- ment. Mortimer did let slip one remark that suggested Crowley's mountaineering exploits might not be entirely contemptible, admitting that Oscar Eckenstein, Germany's greatest climber, had often called Crowley England's best contender — \"but,\" Mortimer added hastily, \"Eckenstein is a German Jew and has a grudge against us, so naturally he'd support Crowley's lies.\" Sir John moved on to seek further clues to his enigmatic antagonist from various people who were reputed to know London high life extensively. \"Crowley is certainly a rascal, and an amusing one,\" said Max Beerbohm. \"Whether he also is a true scoundrel I cannot say, but he does devote a great deal of his energy to convincing the world that he's a scoundrel.\" \"Urn, yes,\" Sir John said doubtfully, \"but just how do you distinguish a rascal from a true scoundrel?\" \"A rascal,\" said Beerbohm precisely, \"doesn't care a brass farthing for contemporary morals, but still possesses his own kind of honor. A scoundrel has neither morals nor honor.\" \"Oh,\" Sir John said, still dubiously. \"Could you give me an example of Crowley's, uh, rascality?\" Beerbohm chuckled. The heavy memories of Horeb, Sinai and the forty years showed as the daylight fell level across his face. \"There are a thousand examples,\" he said, the stiffness from spats to collar relaxing into grace. \"My own favorite involves the statue of Oscar Wilde in Paris, by that very talented young man Jacob Epstein. The French, you know, put the statue up to show they were more broadminded about, uh, Wilde's sexual proclivities than we are and would recognize a great artist whatever his, uh, peculiarities.\" He chuckled again. \"They weren't quite broadminded enough for Epstein's statue, which was a nude, you see. That was a bit thick, in connection with Wilde's, um, reputation, but they couldn't, ah, insult Epstein by rejecting the statue after commissioning it. So they hired some hack to attach a fig leaf at the ah-uh-um sensitive point, if 1 make myself clear. Well, sir, do you know what Crowley did? He crept into the park after dark, with a d removed the fig leaf. Then, to add dal to outrage, he walked into Claridge's here in Lon-"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 149 don, that same night, wearing the fig leaf over the front of his own trousers!\" Beerbohm laughed. 'That is what I would call rascality, although I doubt it is scoundrelism.\" The beautiful Florence Farr, London's most famous ac- tress, was as paradoxical as most of the reviewers of Crow- ley's poetry. \"Aleister,\" she said, \"was, when I knew him ten years ago, the handsomest, wittiest most brilliant young man in London. He was also the most unmitigated cad and blackguard I have ever encountered. From what I hear now and then about his life, these contradictions in him are growing more violent all the time. I am quite sure he will end either on the gallows or being canonized as a saint Victor Neuberg, the young poet who had allegedly been turned into a camel by Crowley, refused to meet with Sir John at all, sending merely a card saying in tiny script: \"No man living understands, or can understand, Aleister Crow- ley, but those who value their sanity will not get involved with him.\" Richard Aldington, the editor, commented: \"Rodin con- siders Crowley our greatest living poet, but I fear that is due entirely to the fact that Crowley wrote a volume of verse glorifying Rodin's sculpture. Personally, I can't stand Crowley's verse. It's Victorian, and rhetorical, and windy. Totally without the modern note Gerald Kelly, the most fashionable painter in England, looking like exactly what he was — a man who would soon be elected to the Royal Academy — said, \"I can't talk about Aleister Crowley, Sir John. You evidently haven't heard that he's my former brother-in-law. All I will say is that when my sister divorced him I was not unhappy.\" Bertrand Russell, the mathematician, stated precisely, \"I have never met a layman who understands modern mathe- matics as well as Aleister Crowley, but aside from that his head is a swamp of mushy mysticism. I hear he plays excellent chess, so you might learn more at the London Chess Club.\" The London Chess Club turned out to be full of ad- mirers of Crowley, all of whom regretted that he hadn't devoted more time to the game. \"He could be a Grand- master,\" one member said sadly, \"if he didn't waste himself on nonsense like mountain-climbing and poetry and was not constantly running off to the East to ruin his mind with Hindu superstitions.\" \"Aleister,\" said another chess buff, \"is the only man I"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"150 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI have ever seen, short of Grandmaster status, who can really play blindfold chess against several opponents and win most of the games. In fact\" — here he lowered his voice — \"one of his sports is almost preternatural. He actually has, on more than one occasion, retired to a bedroom wth his mis- tress of the moment and called out his moves to a player sitting at a board in the next room, and won. He says he does it to show us what real concentration means.\" Sir John blushed furiously. \"What a contemptible way to treat a woman,\" he said stiffly. \"Well,\" said the informant with a leer, \"from what I heard about it, the sounds from the bedroom indicated that the lady was having a most gratifying experience; or several gratifications, in fact.\" Sir John went off pondering that specialists can look right into the Devil's face and not recognize it. What seemed a mixture of vulgar stunt and intellectual gymnastics to the chess player was obviously far worse, to anyone aware of the sexual aspects of black magick: it was part of Crowley's continuous training for the ordeals of the ritual of Pan, in which prolonged sensuality is used to intoxicate the senses and open the door to the astral entities. Sir John next went browsing in bookstores and after a frustrating search finally came upon one of Crowley's books — a prose work entitled Book Four, which claimed to explain all the mysteries of yoga and magick in simple words that the man in the street could understand. Sir John purchased this at once and took it home for study. When Sir John returned to Babcock Manor after collecting all this contradictory but disturbing intelligence about the Enemy, he found that a small package had arrived from the Golden Dawn post office box in London. That was strange, since Jones was still in Paris; but then Sir John did not know for a fact that Jones was in charge of these mailings. Perhaps some other officer of the Order sent out appropriate lessons to students at pre-arranged dates. Sir John opened the package, with a wistful hope that it might contain the secret of the Rose Cross ritual — something for which Jones had told him he might soon qualify.

It said: 1. This is the Book of the Opening of the Eye of Horus, of which the symbol in the profane world is the eye in the triangle, and of which the meaning is Illumi- nation. 2. Thou who readest this doth not read; thou who seeketh shall not attain; thou who understandeth doth not understand. For attainment and understanding cometh only when thou art not thou, yea, when thou art nothing. 3. Once there was a monk, a disciple of that great Magus of our Order whom men name the Buddha which signifieth He Who Is Awake. For men asked the Lord Gotama, Are you a God? And he answered, No. And they asked again, Are you a saint? And he answered again, No. And they asked then, What are you? And he answered: I am awake. Thence is he known as the Buddha, the Awakened One. 4. And the monk, in order to awaken himself, prac» Used the Art of Meditation as taught by Buddha, which in its original form before being distorted by False Imaginings and Elaborations of Theologians, was but this: To look upon all incidents and events and Remember to Say Unto Thine Soul of each: This is transitory. 5. And the monk looked upon all incidents and events, Reminding himself always: This is transitory. 6. And the monk came close to Awakening, and therefore was he in great peril, for The Lord of the Abyss of Hallucinations, whom Buddhists call Mara, the Tempter, cometh quickly to one near Awakening, to hypnotize him again into the Sleep of Fools which is the ordinary consciousness of Men. 7. And Mara did sorely afflict the monk with death of offspring, and insanity of loved ones, and eye- troubles, and slander, and malice, and the great curse of Law Suits, and diverse sufferings; but the monk thought only: This is transitory.

But a brother Monk of the Buddhist order came one day through the jungle, chanting the Teachings, and the Parrot heard, and repeated the one phrase over and over: This is transitory. 10. And Mental Activity began in the Parrot, and the memories of his past life came to him, and the meaning of the teaching, This is transitory; and Mara cursed horribly in frustration, and caused him to die again and reincarnate as an Elephant, even deeper in the jungle and further from the languages of men. 11. And many years passed, and there seemed no chance of Awakening for that soul; but the effects of good karma, like those of bad, continueth forever; and eventually Men came to the jungle, and took the Elephant captive, to sell him to a great Rajah. 12. And the Elephant lived in the courtyard of the Rajah, and many years passed. 13. And another monk of the Buddhist order came to the Rajah, and taught in the courtyard, and his teaching was: This is transitory. And memories awoke in the Elephant, and meaning was understood in the memories, and A wakening again came close. 14. And Mara cursed wrath fully, and caused the Elephant to die; and this time Mara took good care that reincarnation would recur at the furthest possible remove from all chance of Awakening, for Mara caused that the monk be reborn this time as an Ameri- can Evangelist. 15. And the Evangelist was of the Moral Majority [bocca grande giganticus] and he journeyed across the American nation, North and South and East and West, preaching that all were in danger of hellfire, and that there was only One Path to Salvation, and that this Path lay in believing All he Said and doing All he Demanded. 16. And he enslaved many, who became mental Automatons, and these Automatons went about crying, Hallelujah, We Are Saved. 17.

But the Evangelist met with others of the Clergy to discuss sending Missionaries to the Heathen of the East; and there One spoke of the superstitions of the Orient, and he mentioned the Buddhist teaching that All is transitory. 19. And Mental Activity began in the Evangelist, and memories of Past Incarnations stirred; and Mara, in bitter frustration, attempted the Last Trap of All, and caused the Evangelist to become Mahabrahma, Lord of Lords, God of all possible Universes. 20. And Mahabrahma abode in Divine Bliss for billions of billons of years, creating many lesser Brah- mas who created Their own universes and were Gods to them; and Mahabrahma watched all this Activity and rejoiced in it with High Indifference; for Maha- brahma was Consciousness Without Desire. 21. And the monk now seemed at last cut off from Illumination forever. 22. But finally Mahabrahma observed, after watch' ing many Gods come and go, and all Their universes grow and flourish and perish, that the great Law of Laws is that All is transitory. 23. And Mahabrahma realized that He, too, was transitory. 24. And Mahabrahma achieved Illumination. 25. And Mahabrahma came back to ordinary con- sciousness in the mind^ of the monk practising the Buddhist meditation of looking on all things and think' ing, This is transitory. 26. And the monk did not know if he was a monk imagining he had been Mahabrahma or Mahabrahma playing at being a monk; and thus was his Illumination perfected.

Yet I am attached to these fair hills and glens, as I have said before, and I really do not know that we would be safer anywhere else.

To dress a dwarf in a weird costume, even to unleash an unusually large bird, and to count on fear and superstition to magnify all this into a reign of terror — all that would be possible to malignantly disposed humans. Then, I ask myself: Could not somebody have surreptitiously entered my house that Saturday night after I was asleep and borrowed the church key, using it before the rain caused further rust and made the lock into a hermetic seal? Alas, that explanation will not hold water. I keep the key on a small chain attached to a bracelet on my wrist, and the chain was unbroken in the morning.

Then, one dark night, very quietly, simply go to the church and pour hot wax into the lock. In a few moments, the wax has solidified. You carefully slide it out and you have a model of the key. You then take this to any competent locksmith and he will provide you with a duplicate. The stage is set for your miracle.\" Joyce, rolling a cigarette, grinned at Babcock. \"Well, Sir John?\" \"Well, in fact,\" Sir John said, \"although my beliefs are admittedly more mystical than those of you gentlemen, I am not without intelligence of my own.

The only trouble is that Reverend Verey noted, as soon as he discovered the horror on the altar, that his own were the only tracks in the mud approaching the church door. It appears that our super-housebreaker not only moved through a lively farm without waking any of the animals, on two separate nights — when he made his model and when he returned for his Satanic sacrifice — but also, on the second occasion, crossed the yard without leaving footprints in the mud\" Sir John smiled thinly. \"How does Free Thought explain this, my skeptical friends?\" ACTION SOUND INTERIOR, VEREY'S CHURCH, DAY.

DE SAPIENTIA ET STULTITIA Waiting with growing impatience for Jones' return from Paris, and waiting also with dread and foreboding for the next events at Loch Ness, Sir John began studying Crowley's Book Four. It was indeed a very simple and down-to-earth explanation of the occult arts and sciences — at least in its opening chapters. Crowley began by rejecting both Faith and Reason as ultimate answers to the mystery of existence — Faith be- cause it may be Faith in the wrong god, the wrong church or the wrong teacher; Reason because it cannot get beyond the permutations and combinations of its own axioms."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 161 There remains only the method of Experiment, and Crow- ley defined every true occult system as a technique of physiological and neurological Experiment whereby con- sciousness is multiplied and evolution accelerated. All of this, Sir John realized, came from the Golden Dawn teachings, but — to give the devil his due — Crowley certainly had a gift for explaining it with marvelous clarity and scientific precision. Book Four went on to explain the techniques of yoga as physiological experiments. Asana, the contorted gymnastics which Sir John had learned so painfully from Jones, was simply a method of bringing the body to maximum relaxation without actually going to sleep. Pranayama, the special yogic breathing tech- nique, Crowley went on, was similarly a method of bringing the emotions under the control of the Will. Sir John again found himself grudgingly admitting that the Enemy had a real gift for making the occult arts scientifically clear. The first sinister note entered in the discussion of yama and niyama, chastity and self-control. Crowley denounced all the traditional teachings on this subject as superstitious, pernicious and superfluous; in their place he offered the anarchistic advice: \"Let the student decide for himself what form of life, what moral code, will least tend to excite his mind.\" This was totally insidious, Sir John realized: while pretending to scientific objectivity, it opened the door to any system of morality or amorality the reader might per- sonally prefer. Crowley then turned to ceremonial magick and explained it as an aid to yoga. The mind alone, he said, cannot achieve its own transcendence, even by the techniques of yoga, until the Will has become a weapon capable of absolute dictator- ship over the body, over the body's raging emotions and over all mechanical habits. Every technique of magick, Crowley said, was simply a trick or gimmick to aid the student in developing such a self-transcending Will. Moral considerations about the handling of this Will were entirely ignored, Sir John noted; the perversity of Crowley's system was becoming more obvious. And then Sir John came to the chapter on Mother Goose. \"Every nursery rhyme contains profound magickal se- crets,\" Crowley began blandly, in the same rationalistic"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"162 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI tone as the rest of his treatise. He then offered an exam- ple: Old Mother Hubbard Went to the cupboard To get her poor dog a bone . . . Crowley provided the key to this mystic verse, beginning: Who is this ancient and venerable mother of whom it is spoken? Verily she is none other than Binah, as is evident in the use of the holy letter H, with which her name begins. Sir John stared at the page, dumbfounded. It was, damn the man, quite plausible Cabala. Binah was the dark sec- ondary aspect of God, coequal with Chockmah, Divinity's primary or rational aspect. And Binah is usually symbolized as an old woman, just as Chockmah is symbolized as a white-bearded old man. The Cabalists taught that the vulgar could only understand the male or patriarchal aspect of Divinity, but the first step to Illumination is to understand, by direct intuition, the Most Highest's feminine, passive aspect. And He as the second letter of the Divine Name, Yod He* Vau He, is identified with this secondary aspect of Divinity — because He means a window and symbolizes the womb. Crowley was engaged in a very complicated Cabalistic in-joke, to say the least of the matter. Sir John read on with astonishment: And who is this dog? Is it not the name of God spelled Cabalistically backward? And what is this bone? This bone is the Wand, the holy Lingaml The complete interpretation of the rune is now open. This rime is the legend of the murder of Osiris by Typhon. The limbs of Osiris were scattered in the Nile.

But it was also a wicked parody of Cabala to pretend to find all this in Mother Goose. Crowley went on to explain the profound mystical mean- ings in Little Bo Peep (Buddha beneath the bo tree) and her sheep (the Lamb, the Saviour); in Little Miss Muffet (Malkus, the world of illusion) and the spider (Death, the great illusion); and so on, and on, through Little Jack Horner, Humpty Dumpty and all the rest. Book Four, which had started out as the clearest and most empirical volume on mysticism Sir John had ever seen, had turned into an enormous practical joke on the reader. Sir John found himself remembering Victor Neu- berg's terse note: \"No man living understands, or can un- derstand, Aleister Crowley, but those who value their sanity will not get involved with him.\" When Mr. George Cecil Jones returned from his holiday in France, Sir John immediately met with him to recount the whole saga of Lola Levine, Clouds Without Water, The Great God Pan and the Rev. Verey's dead cat. The meeting occurred at Jones' home in the Soho section of London. Jones introduced his wife and children — a pleas- ant and ordinary English family — and then retired with Sir John to a book-lined study on the ground floor. \"You have been meddling with the Abramelin spirits,\" he said at once. \"No,\" Sir John said, taken aback that his nervousness was that easily read. \"Well, then, they have been meddling with you,\" Jones replied. \"Tell me all about it.\" And he sat with an atten- tive, but impassive, face — much as he might sit through a business meeting at his chemical company — as Sir John poured out the whole story. There were perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks and several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated; but Sir John still felt that each dank shadow that moved con- tained an adumbration of dark foreboding. \"Well,\" said Jones when Sir John's narrative was con- cluded, \"you have certainly uncovered a very nasty situa- tion, indeed. Are you afraid?\" \"Fear is failure and the forerunner — \" \"I know, I know; that is what you are supposed to be- lieve,\" Jones interrupted. \"The question is: How deeply do you believe it at this point?\" \"I have my moments of trepidation,\" Sir John confessed."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"164 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI \"Only moments? Not hours or whole days?\" \"Moments,\" Sir John said. \"I think that, between the technique of pranayama and the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, I have learned to vanquish any negative emo- tional state before it can take full possession of me.\" \"That much, at least, is expected of the rank of Practi- cus,\" Jones replied. \"If you were put to higher tests, how- ever ... If , say, I arranged with a surgeon friend of mine to have you observe while he performed major surgery, or an autopsy ... or if I managed to pull the proper strings in government and you were admitted to see a hanging at Newgate Prison . . . could you stand as a Buddha, clear- eyed, without fear or loathing?\" \"Not entirely,\" Sir John admitted. \"But I have attained such degree of detachment from the body-emotions that I would guarantee not to faint or become ill.\" Jones arose and began to pace the room, silent and in- scrutable as a caged panther. \"Suppose,\" he said finally, \"I were to take you on a jaunt to Paris and brought you to one of those clubs, of which you must have heard rumors, where sexual orgies are staged for the amusement of the spectators. Could you watch as a Buddha, clear-eyed, with- out lust and without the conditioned reflexes of horror from your Victorian upbringing?\" Sir John looked into the fire, sermons on hell running through his memory. \"No,\" he said hoarsely. \"I think I would be disturbed by both desire and disgust.\" Jones smiled reassuringly. \"At least you are honest,\" he said simply. He ceased his pacing, drew a chair close to Sir John, and asked quietly, \"Suppose I were to instruct you to take the next train to Inverness, go to the home of Reverend Verey, and employ the great ritual of exorcism to expel the forces that threaten his unfortunate household?\" Sir John's heart sank. \"1 could not do it,\" he said ab- jectly. \"1 have not yet sufficient confidence in myself and my control over the astral forces.\" Jones laughed, and clapped the younger man on the shoulder. \"Excellent, most excellent,\" he said unexpectedly. • u have gone far into a dreadful business,\" he continued, arm with admiration, \"and I must allow that I am torn between the highest regard for your courage and the most dismal apprehensions about your foolhardiness.

Mostly what we have here is malicious mischief, I think.\" Sir John started violently. \"Very malicious mischief,\" he objected. \"Oh, certainly,\" Jones agreed. \"But calm yourself a bit and think about the matter more rationally. Have you ever seen me levitate or walk through walls? Do you imagine that I can perform such wonders but have hidden them from you, out of modesty perhaps? I assure you that such siddhis, as the Hindus call these powers, are very rare, and are mostly a distraction from the Great Work anyway. That a group of debauched diabolists is very advanced in the siddhis is simply preposterous, Sir John. They have magnified egos usually, not magnified powers. There is much evil here, certainly, but there is also much trickery and sheer bluff.

He turned to the letter at once. Verey's handwriting was so shaky, now, that it was diffi- cult to read in places. He began without formality: My Dear Sir John: The worst has happened. I can scarcely gather my wits to write a coherent account. God help us all. The night before last, the buzzing and tittering of the weird creatures that lately haunt this misfortunate place became more terrifying than ever. I resolved to make a recording of these sounds, so that others may hear it and judge if it be only my imagination that these bat-winged things were actually aping human speech. Now, I can think of no use for this record except to send it to you. Others, I am sure, would re- ject it out of hand, saying that I had faked it; playing it back has made me realize that even I would dis- believe it if I had not been on the scene when it was made. But a worse horror has occurred. In yesterday's post there was a package for my brother, Bertran. I happened to notice that the sender used an abbreviation, M.M.M., which meant nothing to me but was puzzling. Under these initials was an address on Jermyn Street in London, but I cannot re- call the number. While 1 was reading my own mail, Bertran wan- dered into the library to open the package. After a few moments I became aware of a sound that few people, I suppose, have ever heard; at first, I could not decide if it were laughter or weeping. I then realized it was the laughter of hysterical madness. I rushed at once to the library, but, alas, I was too late. My God, Sir John, as I entered the room, Bertran already had a hunting rifle held to his head. 1 shouted, \"Stop!\" and ran forward, but he only looked at me with mad, terrified eyes and pulled the trigger.

My God, I [unintelligible words] work of Satan. Then I began to look about for the package that had evidently triggered this inexplicable crisis of sui- cidal melancholy. I realized suddenly that there was a fire in the grate, where none had been before Bertran entered the library, and I made the correct deduction. But try as I might, it was too late to save any particle from the flames. I saw only that the object had been a book of some sort — a rather thin volume, it appeared. I must be off to the coroner's inquest and will post this on my way.

It was not at all clear to him how long he had been sitting, staring into space, the letter fallen to the floor beside him. Mourning doves were cooing softly just outside the window.

An occult bookstore is as good a lure as any — if your prey is the individual seeking mystical secrets and your purpose is to lead him away from the path of light onto the path of darkness.

Freemasonry, Jones said, began with the Knights Temp- lar, as Sir John had argued in his book, The Secret Chiefs. Though non-Masonic historians regard this story of the origin of Masonry as a myth, that is because they only know the rituals and teachings of the public Masonic or- ders — like the Free and Accepted Scottish Rite and the Royal Arch. Those privy to the secrets of the more arcane orders, such as the Brethren of the Rose Croix and the Golden Dawn, can easily see, Jones said, the direct con- tinuity from the Knights Templar to the present. Moreover, Jo. itinued, there have been, ever since the destruction ot the Templars by the Holy Inquisition in 1314, two distinct traditions of mystical Freemasonry, each uncing the other as false and absurd. es,\" said Sir John, \"I believe I know what you mean.

All historians agree that these accusations were brought by Philip II, the King of France, in order to seize the enormous wealth of the Templars. But no two historians have ever come to total agreement about which, if any, of the charges happened to be true. The whole matter is made more complicated by the inconsistent behavior of Jacques de Molay, Grand Master of the Templars. \"His behavior,\" Sir John interjected, \"is all too painfully clear to anybody who has investigated the instruments the Inquisition used in those days in order to obtain confes- sions.\" \"Indeed,\" Jones said somberly. \"The fact remains that de Molay left behind a most ambiguous heritage.\" After arrest, he confessed under torture to all the charges made against the Order of Templars, including even such ex- tremities as spitting on the crucifix and every sexual excess imaginable. Brought to trial, de Molay repudiated the entire confession and stated emphatically that he had made these admissions only to escape the sadistic tools of Inquisitorial interrogation. He was then put to the torture again, con- fessed again, and stood trial a second time without further denials. Then, on the pyre of his execution, before the flames were lit, he again passionately affirmed his innocence and that of the Templar order, denounced the Inquisition and the Royal House of France, and — according to some sources — died with the shout, \"Vekam, Adonai!\" [Revenge, O Lord!] \"Any objective historian,\" Jones went on, \"however prej- udiced against the claim that Freemasonry is rooted in the secret teachings of the Templars, will admit that all the Templars were not killed in the great purge of 1314. In- deed, it is documented that the Spanish lodges of the Tem- plars were not persecuted at all and continued quite un- harmed while the French lodges were systematically ex- terminated. And even the more open Freemasonic orders, such as the Scottish Rite, still use de Molay's last words — Vekam, Adonai! — in their Third Degree initiation, al- though most of them have no clear idea what the words mean or where they come from.\" A continuous series of tragedies has struck the French throne over the centuries, Jones went on. It began with the assassination of Philip II, who had denounced the Templars and seized their wealth; Philip himself was stabbed to death one year and one day after de Molay was burned at the stake."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"174 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI It climaxed with the beheading of Louis XVI during the French Revolution. All this was the work of one lodge of Masonic Templars who were very literal about de Molay's cry for vengeance. \"It is their aim,\" Jones said somberly, \"having abolished the French monarchy, to overthrow, eventually, every king in Europe, and to destroy the Papacy, also.\" Jones began rummaging in his bookshelves and produced a parchment of recent printing. \"This,\" he said, \"is a docu- ment of the lodge to which I refer. It now calls itself the Ordo Templi Orientis — the Order of Oriental Templars — and is the owner of record of the Mysteria Mystica Maxi- ma bookstore at 93 Jermyn Street. All members of the Ordo Templi Orientis must sign three copies of this docu- ment. It is the concise summary of the beliefs of the false Masonry which we in the Golden Dawn are pledged to oppose and vanquish.\" He handed Sir John the parchment, which read: There is no God but Man. Man has the right to live by his own law. Man has the right to live in the way that he wills to do. Man has the right to dress as he wills to do. Man has the right to dwell where he wills to dwell.

The incitement to promiscuity, assassination and revolution is phrased so as to seem part and parcel of an integrated philosophy of liberty. It would be particularly attractive to young and impressionable minds.\" \"Look again at the first line,\" Jones said. \"That is the kernel of the blasphemy: There is no God but Man.' Do you see how that could lead weak-minded atheists to a kind of humanistic mysticism, and naive mystics to atheism, while drawing both into a worldwide plot against both civil government and organized religion? And can you see how this ultra-individualism could even attract some really good minds and noble hearts during the Dark Ages when all government was tyranny and the chief engine of religion was the ungodly terrorism of the Inquisition?\" \"And the perversions coded into Clouds Without Water are the same as those charged against the Templars,\" Sir John mused. \"The continuity is undeniable, over a period of six centuries . . . But do they really believe that such vile and nameless practices can raise them beyond humanity to Godhood?\" \"These erotic practices are central to many cults,\" Jones said. \"You will find them among certain Taoist alchemists in China, among the Tantrists in India, in the Egyptian and Greek mystery cults, among certain dark sects of Sufis in the Middle Ages — which is probably where this dark, diabolical side of Masonry evolved, alongside of true Ma- sonry.\" \"But,\" Sir John cried, \"how could a man be trained in the Golden Dawn, as this Crowley was, and deliberately turn his back on it and join this perversion of the true Craft?\" Jones sighed. \"Why did Lucifer fall?\" he asked. \"Pride. The desire, not to serve God, but to be God.\" There was a long silence and each man contemplated the horror lurking behind the initials M.M.M. Sir John spoke first. \"What can we do for poor Reverend Verey and his wife?\" \"There is only one thing to do,\" Jones said decisively. \"We must cable him at once and urge, in the strongest possible language, that he and Mrs. Verey come to London straightaway. Here, working with the Chiefs of our Order, we can create a psychic shield to protect them. If they"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"176 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI remain in that lonely home on Loch Ness, further horrors will inevitably descend upon them.\" Jones shook his head wearily. \"We must make the cable as strongly worded as possible,\" he repeated. \"Any delay on their part might be long enough for a second tragedy to occur.\" DE FORMULA DEORUM MORIENTIUM Jones and Sir John spent nearly an hour composing the cable; it was nearly two in the morning when Sir John arrived home at Babcock Manor, totally exhausted. If he had bad dreams again, he was unable to remember them, because his butler, Wildeblood, abruptly awakened him at seven in the morning. \"I'm most sorry, sir,\" Wildeblood said, \"but there is a gentleman here who is most insistent upon seeing you. He is in a terribly agitated state.\" \"At this ungodly hour?\" Sir John grumbled, feeling for his slippers groggily. \"Who the blazes is he?\" \"A clergyman, sir. He gave his name as Reverend Charles Verey.\" Sir John bolted out of bed, grabbing desperately for his robe. He knew in his bones that fresh horror had struck Inverness before the cable could have arrived. \"No tea,\" he said. \"Coffee— very black. And eggs and bacon for two, I suppose. In the plant room.\" He washed and brushed his hair rapidly, without bother- ing to shave. Bat-winged monstrosities . . . the malign Wee People, regarded as quaint and harmless only by ignorant citified foiklorists ... the Thing in Loch Ness . , . What new abomination had finally driven old Verey from his beloved Highland hills? Descending the stairs almost at a gallop, Sir John re- ceived two shocks at once. Rev. Verey was a hunchback (but, of course, he would be too sensitive to mention that in his letters . . .) and he wore the most haggard and tragic e Sir John had ever seen. Composing his own features with great difficulty, Sir John extended a steady hand. \"I am at your service, sir,\" he said in a level voice. Keep calm, keep calm, he told him- self sternly. The old man took Sir John's hand weakly. \"You see be- re you a broken man,\" he said hoarsely. \"I am almost"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 177 ready to despair of God's goodness,\" he added, choking back a sob. \"Come,\" Sir John said kindly. \"You must be exhausted from your trip, in addition to the evil forces you have faced. Let us breakfast together and discuss what can be done.\" Verey was so pale, he noticed, that it was almost as if his face were painted for a death scene at the Old Vic. And so two men, both struggling for self-mastery, sat down in the plant room — where Sir John kept a cheerful collection of ferns, forsythia and morning glories, amid cages of canaries and mynah birds. It was by far the bright- est breakfast room in the mansion, and Sir John had chosen it for that reason. Unfortunately, one of the mynahs had apparently picked up an indelicate phrase from one of the workmen who had installed new shelving the past weekend. \"Hold your fucking end up, Bert!\" the bird shrieked, as Sir John ushered the aged clergyman to the table. \"Quiet!\" Sir John burst out, forgetting that it is better to ignore a mynah at such moments. \"Hold your fucking end up, Bert!\" the bird repeated, encouraged by the attention. \"I'm sorry,\" Sir John said, feeling inane. \"He must have picked that up from a laborer.\" \"It doesn't matter,\" Verey said absently. \"Annie is dead.\" He stared at the tiletop table, seemingly unable to speak further. [\"Hold your fucking end up, Bert!\"] \"Annie?\" Sir John asked gently. \"Your wife?\" \"Aye,\" Verey cried. \"Annie, my wife. My companion for these forty-three years. My treasure, my heaven on earth.\" And Sir John looked at the tabletop himself now, not wishing to watch the old man's struggle against tears. \"Coffee, sir,\" said Wildeblood, suddenly appearing from amid the ferns. \"The food will be along momentarily.\" \"Here, Reverend, take it hot and black,\" Sir John said. \"It will stimulate and revive you. I can't tell you how sorry I am — how my heart feels for you at this moment — there are no words . . .\" \"Hold your fucking end up, Bert!\" \"Wildeblood!\" Sir John exclaimed, \"take that god . . . that foul bird outdoors at once!\" \"Very good, sir.\" Wildeblood withdrew carrying the cage. \"Hello.

[He's still in shock, Sir John thought.] \"I hadn't told Annie about the package that unhinged Bertran's mind — why give her more to worry about? Oh, what a fool I am, what a blind, ignorant fool ... If she had known ... if she had been warned . . .\" \"Get a grip on yourself,\" Sir John said gently. \"Yes, of course. I'm sorry. . . .\" [The victims of the worst tragedies, Sir John thought, always apologize to others, as if guilty about the debt of pity we owe them.] \"It was an- other package,\" Verey went on. \"I didn't notice when the post came. I was in my study, praying . . . asking God to intervene, to stop these diabolical beings who are afflicting my family. Like Job, I wanted to know that God did hear me and did have a reason for allowing the Adversary to heap these cruelties upon us. I don't know ... I was pray- ing and weeping both, I think. Bertran was one of the bravest men I have ever known, and I could not begin to imagine what could drive him to the cowardly, un-Chris- tian act of suicide. What was that damnable book? At last, somehow, I composed myself. I said, 'Not my will but Thine, be done, 6 Father,' and resolved to hold my faith despite all.\" Verey raised tormented eyes to stare at Sir John like a wounded animal. \"That was when I heard that horrible sound for the second time in my life — the laughter of hysterical madness.\" Sir John clenched the old man's humped shoulder. \"Courage,\" he said gently. \"I rushed to the kitchen,\" Verey went on, his voice again toneless and detached, in traumatic shock. \"She had thrown it into the wood stove, but I could see that it was a book. 60 read the syllables THER GO on the burning cover. Oh, God— THER GO, THER GO: What can that mean? But Annie was screaming in agony by then and in one horrible instant 1 could see why.

THER GO!\" screamed a mynah bird. After breakfast, Sir John and the Rev. Verey brought an extra pot of coffee into the library and discussed the entire series of terrors that had brought them together. Babcock told what he knew about Lola Levine, Aleister Crowley, the M.M.M. and Machen's Great God Pan. Verey listened with an abstracted air, as if he had supped so full on horrors that nothing further could stun him. \"The book,\" Babcock said finally, \"the terrible book that led to both suicides — that may be the key to the whole mystery. Those damnable syllables that you recall — THER GO — are so tantalizingly inconclusive. Can you remember no more?\" \"Nothing,\" Verey said woodenly, hollowly. \"You must remember that I had only an instant to look into the flames, and my mind was in a state of shock at the time.\" Sir John poured more coffee, thinking of phrases like \"There you go,\" \"There they go,\" \"There we go.\" He sud- denly had a new thought. \"At least we can avoid two obvious false leads,\" he said. 'The book wasn't either Clouds Without Water or The Great God Pan itself. Neither of those has a ther go in the title. Besides, you and I and others have read those books without going mad. ...\" Verey leaped up and began pacing, a tragic figure with his hunched back and white, ashy face. \"The book we are speaking of is not made up of hints or codes, like The Great God Pan or Clouds Without Water\" he said. \"The horror of it must be visible on every page, wherever one opens it. Both Bertran and poor Annie reacted within two or three minutes of opening the volume. They must have been driven mad by only a few sentences ... a paragraph at most. . . .\" Babcock himself had grown pale. \"I suddenly realize, Reverend, that there is one obvious remaining target for this monstrosity,\" he said awkwardly. \"Yourself. You must remain here, as my guest, until this whole terrible business is settled. And any packages to you, from M.M.M., must remain unopened, or at the most should be opened only by a man I know who is so advanced in occult knowledge that he might be able to deal with whatever is in this book.\""},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"180 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINAH Verey stared into the fireplace. \"I know you are right,\" he said wearily, \"although, at this point, I would hate to see anyone, however advanced in occult knowledge you may consider him, open a package from that damnable M.M.M.\" \"Perhaps,\" Sir John replied. \"That is for Jones himself — the man of whom I spoke — to decide. But certainly neither you nor I must open such a package. If you are the obvious next target, / may well be the target after you. God,\" he cried, \"how can such things be, and the world go on in its smug materialistic blindness?\" Verey sighed \"It's those atheists at Oxford and Cam- bridge,\" he said. \"It's the heritage of Voltaire and Darwin and Nietzsche. . . . The whole intellectual climate of Europe for one hundred fifty years now has been guided by the Anti-Christ, to blind us . . .\" \"Well, history can't be changed,\" Sir John said, \"but our future is always in our own hands. I have had a telephone installed recently, and I am going to put a call through to London, to get Jones out here as soon as possible. Be- lieve me, he is better equipped to deal with this horror than you or I.\" He rose, but stopped at the sudden look of anguish on Verey's face. \"My God,\" Verey said. \"McPherson.\" Sir John whirled to confront him. \"McPherson?\" he ex- claimed. \"Who's McPherson?\" \"Reverend Duncan McPherson,\" Verey said. \"My part- ner and associate in the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth. He received one of the postcards, too.\" Sir John felt as if the solid earth were collapsing into random atoms beneath him. \"What postcards?\" he cried. \"You never mentioned any postcards.\" Verey was virtually jumping up and down with anguish and impatience. \"I must warn him,\" he said. \"You have a telephone, you say. But whom do I know in all of Inverness with a telephone 4 The police!\" Sir John exclaimed. \"We must call the police there and have them get in touch with McPherson! But what postcards?\" \"Later, man!\" Verey cried. \"Where's the telephone?\" \"In the downstairs hall,\" Babcock said. \"But how in the world can we explain all this to a policeman?\" were hurrying to the stairs as they exchanged these ... \"The police know all about the sui-"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ELLUMINAT1 181 cades,\" Verey explained excitedly, \"and they have heard my testimony about the packages that came in the post just before the suicides — although I think they only half-be- lieved me. . . .\" But by the time both men were in the telephone alcove in the front hall they were speaking fairly calmly and rationally again. Verey asked the operator to put him through to Inverness-418, and, after the usual annoying delay, he was connected. \"This is Reverend Verey,\" he said when the phone was answered at the other end. \"I must speak to Inspector Mc- intosh, in the matter of the suicides.\" Babcock found himself admiring the old man's sense of diplomacy in the next few minutes. Verey explained only as much as a police officer might be able to understand, even improvising off the top of his head a theory that the mysterious packages from London might unleash a chemical poison that would unhinge the reason. \"Under no circum- stances,\" the hunchbacked clergyman said sharply, \"should McPherson open any package from London — or any un- usual package, to be on the safe side. These villains may change their return address to catch us off guard.\" When Verey finally hung up the phone, he looked some- what relieved. \"They're sending a constable around to McPherson's at once,\" he said. \"That inspiration of mine about the delirium-producing chemical seems to have im- pressed him.\" Sir John nodded somberly. \"It impressed me, for a mo- ment,\" he said. \"But it isn't true, of course. There is no drug with a reaction so specific as in these cases. Even belladonna, the most delirium-producing chemical known, has a wide variety of effects. Some weep hysterically; some laugh insanely; some hallucinate; others die of toxic re- action. Hasheesh is equally variable in its effects. There is nothing in that line of speculation to help us here, although it is at least enough to persuade the police to put McPher- son on guard against mysterious packages. . . .\" They returned quietly to the library, where Sir John finally remembered Verey's incoherent excitement about \"the postcards\" before their mad rush to the telephone. When they were seated again, he raised that question. \"What were those postcards you were talking about?\" Verey shook his head with humility. \"It was totally silly and absurd,\" he said. \"I attached no meaning at all to it"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"182 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINAT1 until the moment you saw the thought strike me. Of course, now I'm not sure — it may just be coincidence. . . .\" Just coincidence, Sir John thought bitterly. Those words will always sound idiotic or sinister to me. \"And the postcards weren't even postmarked London,\" Verey said. \"They were actually postmarked Inverness: that's why I didn't make the connection. But, of course, we know They have agents there, also, like that mysterious vanishing Oriental. . . .\" 'Tell me about the cards,\" Sir John suggested gently, \"The first one came for Bertran,\" Verey said, \"exactly two days before the package that provoked his suicide. It was utter nonsense — just a staff with a Hebrew letter on it.\" \"Do you know which Hebrew letter?\" Sir John asked intensely. Verey thought a minute. \"Bring me a pad,\" he said. \"I, of course, had Hebrew in seminary — but that was nigh forty long years ago now. Nonetheless, Scots education is strict, and thorough. ... I think I have it.\" Sir John handed him a pad and Verey sketched rapidly. \"This is what the card looked like,\" he said. \"Just this and Bertran's name.\" Sir John looked at the design: \"Yod, is it not?\" asked Verey. John blushed. 44 Ycs,\" he said, \"Yod. It means hand or But he was recalling the opinion of certain scholars who claimed that hand and fist were late euphemisms and that yod originally meant spermatozoa. The whole design was disturbingly phallic. \"And the next card?\" he asked, suspecting it would contain nun, the fish, again.

And the first postcard design was not a staff but a wand, since this is a cup. We are getting the implements of magick, in order. Was the postcard to McPherson not a sword?\" \"That is most marvelous,\" Verey said. \"You are abso- lutely right. It looked like this.\" He sketched again: CeJ|)h= \"Vau,\" said Sir John. \"The nail.\" Both men were pale again. \"Some things one doesn't for- get, even in four decades,\" Verey said with awe. \"Seeing all three together, I discern what the fourth must be.\" \"Yes,\" Sir John said. \"What we have thus far is Yod Hi Vau, the first three letters of the Holy Unspeakable Name of God. The fourth can only be a second He, making Yod Hi Vau He — YHVH, usually transliterated as 'Jehovah' in English. These monsters are using the most sacred name in Holy Cabala as the leitmotif of their chain of murders. This is blasphemy and sacrilege of the most extreme sort, the blackest of black magick. But when did McPherson re- ceive the sword with Vau on it?\""},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"184 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATT \"Two days ago!\" Verey gasped. Sir John gasped. \"Then the package with the book of horror should be in today's post!\" \"Blessed Saviour,\" Verey whispered, eyes closed. \"May the police be there before the postman. . . .\" They both heard the phone ringing at the same moment Afterward, Sir John could never remember if they ran or merely stumbled to the hall. \"Sir John Babcock,\" he said into the speaker. \"This is Inspector Mcintosh,\" said the electronic voice in his ear. \"Is the Reverend Charles Verey there?\" Sir John turned the telephone over to Verey and stood like a zombie as he listened to Verey's side of the con- versation: \"Yes ... Oh, God, no . . . Yes . . . What . . . ? Most certainly . . . God pity us all, Inspector ... I certainly shall.\" The hunchbacked clergyman looked dwarfish and shrunken as he hung up. \"It happened again,\" he said. \"My God!

They looked in the fireplace for the remains of a package, as in the two other cases.

The Fraumunster chimes were striking six, and cin- namon streaks of twilight cast shadows of dying color weirdly into the room, a russet-gold witch's glamour, Gothic as the tale Sir John told. Einstein, Babcock and Joyce had agreed with Mileva Einstein's suggestion that they take a break for dinner. The dining room by now reeked with"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"186 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINAH dead heavy smoke from Einstein's pipe. Mileva had opened a window to freshen the air, with the uninspiring result that the clammy Fohn could be felt in the room now. Einstein rose to stretch a bit and walk around thought- fully. Joyce sat immobile in his red plush chair, his face ex- pressionless, introspective. \"Well, Jeem,\" Einstein said finally. \"It seems as if all the paraphernalia of the Celtic Twilight poets you despise has landed in our laps. Even the faeries . . .\" Joyce nodded, smiling whimsically. \"Even an appropri- ately eerie sunset,\" he said. \"It is much like the Tar Baby story of the American Negroes. You become attached to what you attack \" Einstein stopped pacing and his playful spaniel eyes went entirely out of focus, obviously looking inward, not out- ward; Joyce wondered if he had stopped thinking in words and was thinking in pictures, as he said he did when he was working on a problem in physics. Babcock and Joyce ex- changed the vacant glances of the Apostles at the end of one of the darker parables, both of them thinking of the Tar Baby story and how it could possibly have triggered Einstein's Fakir-liko trance. The more you hit a Tar Baby, the more you are stuck to it: that was the moral of the Negro legend. But what did that have to do with a book that actually drove people into suicidal mania? Did de- stroying the book destroy the receivers, as an allegory for censors? \"Action and reaction,\" Einstein whispered, talking most- ly to himself. \"Good old Newton still has wisdom for us after three centuries. . . .\" \"Professor,\" Babcock exclaimed, \"is it possible? Are you actually beginning to see a scientific explanation of these incredible event Einstein blinked and sat down again, wearily. \"Well, not exactly,\" he said. \"But I am starting to find some scientific light in this medieval darkness ... a hypothesis is begin- ning to dawn . . . but 1 don't know yet. . . .\" \"At this point,\" Ji d, \"any hypothesis would be wel- come, however, tentative or incomplete. By God, Einstein, I spent several months, last year, writing the most grue- some and fetid sermon on Hell ever composed.

Listening to Babcock's tale, on the other hand, almost puts me back into the real rancid terrors of my adolescence.\" \"Of course,\" Einstein said, ruddy-faced in the dying sun- light. \"That is the whole point.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" Babcock cried. \"Wait,\" Einstein said. \"It is only a dim light, so far; it may be a false dawn; I am still working on it But surely you can generalize from the man entangled with the Tar Baby to the more amusing, more interesting situation in which two Tar Babies are fighting with each other?\" Joyce and Babcock sat blankly, crimson statues in gath- ering darkness. Mileva Einstein appeared in the pale orange doorway. \"Dinner, gentlemen!\" The meal began with an antipasto of cheese, olives and anchovies. \"I acquired a taste for Italian food during my years in Milan,\" Einstein explained. \"One of the reasons I like Zurich is that the restaurants here offer such a variety — you can dine Italian style, German style and French style on three different nights — if you can afford to dine out three nights in a row, that is.\" \"I dine at the most expensive restaurants in Trieste,\" Joyce said, \"once a month, on payday. On my income this guarantees that I usually cannot pay the rent on time.\" \"Does that not make enormous problems?\" Babcock asked. \"It does for my brother,\" Joyce said. \"The landlords often hound him for the money, when they have had more than they can stand of my foul language and Byronic bad manners.\" \"You are shameless,\" Mileva said, with a glint of humor- ously exaggerated maternal disapproval. \"I cannot afford shame,\" Joyce replied at once. \"It inter- feres with perception. By provoking my landlords I learn areas of human psychology that are still a closed book to the local wise man, Dr. Jung, or even to his Viennese com- petitor, Dr. Freud.\""},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"188 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI The men seemed to have a tacit agreement not to discuss the horrors of Babcock's medieval tale during the meal, while Milly was present. Joyce, in fact, quickly engaged Frau Einstein in a discussion of the history of Zurich, in which he astonished everybody by pointing out the Celtic origin of various local customs such as the Secheslauten festival in spring. \"Carrying out a straw dummy that rep- resents winter and burning it,\" he said, \"is found, in one form or another, in every Celtic culture.\" \"But it's over two thousand years since Switzerland was Celtic,\" Mrs. Einstein said, astonished. \"The historical archetypes, as Vico would call them, re- main,\" Joyce declared. \"And the etymologies remain. Do you not know that the very name 'Zurich' is derived from the Latin, Turicum?\" \"I've heard that,\" Mileva admitted. \"Ah,\" Joyce said. \"But why did the Romans call this place Turicum? Look it up, as I did, and you will find the original Celtic inhabitants called it Dur, which means roughly 'the place where the waters join' — where the Lim- mat River flows into Lake Zurich. The Romans merely Latinized Dur into Turicum.\" Einstein raised an amused eyebrow. \"Jeem,\" he said, \"you look into words like a biologist looking down a mi- croscope. I begin to believe you really meant all those para- doxes you were reciting last night, about the content of mind being nothing but words.\" 'The history of consciousness is a history of words,\" Joyce said immediately. \"Shelley was justified in his bloody unbearable arrogance, when he wrote that poets were the unacknowledged legislators of the world. Those whose words make new metaphors that sink into the public con- sciousness, create new ways of knowing ourselves and othei \" 'L'amor die movcte il sol e altare Stella/ \" Einstein quoted suddenly. \"Once you have encountered that phrase in Dante, the music of it does sink into your consciousness. It is very hard to look at the stars at night without thinking of it and feeling a little of what Dante felt. And yet I know, rationally, that the sun and other stars are actually moved by stochastic processes.\" \"Stochastic?\" Baboock asked. \"Random,\" Joyce translated. \"The professor is talking about the Second Law oi i thermodynamics,\""},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATl 189 •The stochastic is not random,\" Einstein hastily cor- rected. \"There is always a hidden variable in every sto- chastic process. A rational law. To think otherwise is to reify and deify Chaos. But is cosmic law the same as the heartbeat of Love that Dante intuited behind the cosmos? Anyone who claims to answer to that is either the king of philosophers or the king of fools.\" \"I find it easier to believe in love than in law,\" Milly said boldly. \"But, being men, you will all say that is because I am a woman.\" \"Ah,\" said Joyce, \"I should not say so. Perhaps the Isle of Man is only a suburb of the Continent of Woman. Bi- ologically, the male is an accessory, an ambulatory seed- pod.\" \"Much of the universe, alas, is loveless,\" Einstein said. \"But no aspect of it is lawless.\" \"So it seems to logic,\" Joyce said argumentatively. \"But logic is only Aristotle's generalization of the laws of Greek grammar. Which is part, but only part, of the great wordriver of consciousness. Chinese logic is not Aristoteli- an, you know. Other parts of the mindriver of human thought are totally illogical and irrational. You have shown mathematically, Professor, that space and time cannot be separated. The psychoanalytic study of consciousness is rapidly proving what Sir John and I have discovered in different ways, introspectively: namely, that reason and un- reason are also seamlessly welded together — like your two Tar Babies after a prolonged fight. . . .\" \"You are a most unusual man,\" said Mileva, as the din- ner concluded. \"If there is a Mrs. Joyce, she must be a most remarkable woman.\" \"There is no Mrs. Joyce. But I lived with the same wom- an for ten years, and will certainly live with her the rest of my life, if she can continue to abide my intransigence that long.\" The men retired to Einstein's study as Mileva began clearing up the dining room. \"Dash it all!\" Babcock burst out to Joyce. \"Must you parade you immorality on every possible occasion? I'm sure Frau Einstein was terribly shocked. Bragging about cheat- ing landlords and living in open immorality.\" \"Frau Einstein is shock-proof,\" Einstein said calmly. \"Most of my friends are eccentrics. Sometimes I even sus- pect that I might perhaps be an eccentric myself.\""},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"190 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI \"Every individual is a deviate,\" Joyce said promptly. \"I've never met a bore in my whole life.

The masquerade is the key to human psychology. And, al- though I'm interested in your unique problems,\" he added to Babcock, \"I give you no authority to judge any moral decision I make. Nor do I give such authority to any fat- bellied Church or thieving State. Nora lives with me be- cause as a free being she chooses to, not because super- stition or law forces her to stay.

Heroic posturing: merde. \"Some things,\" Babcock rejoined heatedly, \"are Simply Not Done in decent society.\" \"You are no psychologist,\" Joyce said with silky Celtic irony. \"They are done all the time. They are simply not talked about.\" \"Gentlemen,\" said Einstein gravely, \"this debate has been raging since the Romantic movement began a century ago. I do not think we will settle it tonight. Let us apply our brains, more profitably, to the Gothic mysteries pre- sented by Sir John's singular tale.\" Joyce slouched limply in a chair. \"I have come to certain conclusions about that,\" he said. \"Would you be interested in hearing them?\" \"Yes,\" Einstein said. \"I would be curious as to how they match up with my own tentative partial hypothesis.\" \"Quite so,\" said Babcock, also seating himself after re- moving a pile of scientific magazines in French and German from the only unoccupied chair. \"To begin with,\" Joyce said. \"I do not believe in the ik thai dri\\ i mad, for two reasons.

Second, it has finally dawned on me that I have encountered this story before, in a work of fic- tion. I suspect that Mr. Aleister Crowley and his associates in the M.M.M. have read the same work of fiction and are merely adapting it as a mask for their true method of mur- der.\" Einstein almost dropped his pipe. \"This is most interest- ing,\" he said. \"I begin to believe my own emerging hypo- thesis, since this would be what the hypothesis predicts. What is the work of fiction you have in mind?\" \"It is a book of weird, supernatural stories called The King in Yellow. The author is an American named Robert W. Chambers. The stories all revolve around a horrible book, which is never named, but which causes madness in everybody who reads it. I might also add that there is some interesting allegorical material about masks and masque- rades in The King in Yellow, which is also perhaps the most successful horror story since Stoker's Dracula. Mil- lions must have read it. I think it almost certain that the plot of this book suggested, to the M.M.M., a kind of malign masquerade in which they would create the im- pression that a book such as Chambers imagined really existed.\" Einstein relit his pipe: a cherry-red glow grew in the dark tobacco. \"Masks and masquerades,\" he said. •That is in- deed what concerns us here. But how do we tear off the masks and see what lies behind? How are these seeming 'miracles' actually accomplished? If it weren't for Ernst Mach and the Tar Baby story, I would not have the begin- ning of a hint of a theory . . . And even as it is, for every point that I think I can possibly explain, there are three that still leave me in the dark. \"Suppose,\" he went on, \"you had read The King in Yel- low and were cruel enough to wish to duplicate the plot in real life. The best you could do, it seems to me, is some- thing like this: you include a letter with the book. The letter says: 'This paper has been saturated with the germs of leprosy'— or syphilis, or whatever disease arouses the desired degree of terror. Would such a device succeed?

Despite the political news one reads every day, the human race does not consist entirely of gullible dunces. This whole book of horrors is an enormous red herring across the trail, to confuse and distract us. The real method of driving the victims to suicidal mania was quite different, I am sure, and the books were sent to create a supernatural twilight aura around it.\" \"I wish I could be as certain of that as you are,\" Bab- cock said wearily. Joyce shrugged with agnostic resignation. \"I am certain of nothing,\" he admitted. \"I am only theorizing. I have also been working on those mysterious fragments of the alleged book's title. We have no guarantee that we have received them in correct order, since the witnesses saw only parts of words. I have been trying permutations. Instead of ther-go- mo, how about ther-mo-go? Thermo is a prefix that means heat and appears in 'thermometer,' 'thermodynamics' and dozens of other redhot scientific words. Do you know of any scientific term beginning thermogo, Professor?\" \"The best I can do along those lines,\" Einstein said rue- fully, \"is thermogenetic and thermograph. No thermo- go . . .\" \"Well,\" Joyce said, \"there is always mo-ther-go. I im- mediately conceive the possible title, Mother, Go to Hell!

Jones was silent a moment, thinking. \"You can reach London by early evening, with any luck. Of course, you must not come to my house, since that will be the first place they will be seeking the two of you. Go to 201 Paul Street. A friend of mine, Kenneth Campbell, will receive you. You will find him perfectly trustworthy and rather formidable. I will join you and Verey there.\" 'Two hundred one Paul Street,\" Sir John repeated. \"I believe I know the neighborhood. Is it not off Tottenham Court Road?\" \"You have it. Not the most distinguished or respectable part of London, but an excellent place to castle our king for a while. I hope all three of us can join Mr. Campbell there by six or seven. Be careful, Sir John: remember that a man with Verey's hunched back is a rather conspicuous figure.\" Sir John was beginning to feel exhilarated by the time he explained the plan to Verey. He had to remind himself that three people had died horribly already — three crushing tragedies for poor Verey — to keep himself from regarding the day ahead as a splendid adventure. Encounters with death and danger are only adventures to the survivors, Sir John realized uncomfortably; and it was still far from certain who would survive this horrible affair; but nevertheless, he was still young, damn it all — he was planning to outfox a sinister enemy — it was exciting. A look at the clergyman's ashy face reminded him that he was not in a Conan Doyle or Rider Haggard novel but in real life, where the dead are really dead and those who loved them really grieve and do not just sob once into a handkerchief before the novelist rushes on to the next thrill. When Sir John outlined the escape strategy, Verey agreed almost absently. It was shocking to see how much"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"196 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI of the arrogance had been drained from the old man, how docile he was in accepting direction. Sir John's plan involved the fact that the wine cellar led into a short tunnel which connected with a deserted out- building where an earlier Babcock, generations back, had mounted a private winepress, long since fallen into disuse. \"They may be watching this house with binoculars or even with a high-power telescope,\" he explained. \"But no- body can see that old winepress cottage unless he prac- tically falls over it. The whole area around it is now very heavily wooded.\" The clergyman nodded gloomily. He did not speak in his normal style, in fact, until they were actually in the wine cellar. \"You do be keeping a great amount of spirits,\" he said suspiciously, \"for a Christian and sober man.\" Sir John was leading the way with a candelabra. \"Family stock,\" he said apologetically. \"Most of the bottles are fifty or a hundred years old, or older. I hardly ever open one, except for special guests.\" \"Aye,\" said the hunchbacked figure in the gloom. \"That's the way it always starts. Opening a bottle occasionally, for special guests. Every wretch I have ever seen ruined by drink started that way.\" Because of the darkness, Sir John allowed himself a smile. It was comforting, in a way, to see that some of the old man's character remained intact even after the tragedies he had endured. For a while there, Verey had seemed al- most an automaton. Then Sir John began to realize how huge the wine cellar really was, to the eyes of a Scottish Presbyterian. He hadn't been down here since childhood, when he had explored the tunnel regularly in hopes of finding pirate treasure, or the rns of the trolls. As they passed row after row of cob- webbed bottles, Sir John began to see the Babcocks as he imagined Verey was seeing them: a family of alcoholic ^ lichees. ;ially, they found the tunnel.

Could there be a confederate of Crowley's M.M.M. here in his own household? What might be waiting in this Stygian blackness only a few feet ahead of them? Then he smiled again in the darkness. The servants had all been with the Babcocks for a long time: they were sim- ple, solid souls he had trusted since childhood. This dam- nable mystery had begun to infect his mind with the germs of paranoia. My God, suspecting Wildeblood or Dora or old Mrs. Maple of involvement with black magicians was as ridiculous as suspecting the Royal Family or the Arch- bishop of Canterbury. There seemed to be a buzzing sound in the air of the tunnel, reminding Sir John of the insectoid hum of his dreamvisions of Chapel Perilous and Verey's weird record- ing: thinking, could bees or wasps have built a hive down here?, recalling also the buzzing sound attributed to the voices of the faery by folklorists, holding on to his courage by act of Will, yet irrelevantly remembering also that the bee was for some inexplicable reason the emblem of the Bavarian Illuminati, the most atheistic and revolutionary of all Masonic offshoots. He would get a grip on himself, damn it to hell; he would not keep wandering into such unwholesome thoughts. But he was remembering an an- cient Cabalistic riddle: Why does the Bible begin with B (beth) instead of A (aleph)l Answer: because A is the letter of Arar, cursing, and B the letter of Berakah, bless- ing. But why was the bee the symbol of the Illuminati? And what was that insectoid buzzing and who were those people in honeysuits in that early dream of Chapel Perilous? Fear is failure, and the forerunner of failure .... He was not that pitiful fieldmouse trapped in the hands of a being incomprehensible to himself. He was a Knight of the Rose Croix on God's business and \"no demon hath power over him whose armor is righteousness.\" Remembering, too, Uncle Bentley explaining that fear of the dark is one of the oldest primate emotions, dating back to the brutal ages when our mute gnomic furry an- cestors were subject to clawed attack by many kinds of nocturnal carnivores, and hardly a child in the world does not have some remnant of that primordial fear, which comes back even to the adult in times of strain; and if it was grotesque to suspect the family servants, there was yet the disquieting thought of the workmen who had been all over Babcock Manor when the electricity was installed and"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"198 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI the whole house refurbished. One of them could have been an agent of the M.M.M. who had set a trap somewhere, in a dark place like this. . . . \"Fear is failure, and the forerunner of failure,\" Sir John reminded himself again. Where are you going? The East, What do you seek? The Light. According to the Welsh, the crew that never rests lived in tunnels like this, under the earth. . . . With great relief, Sir John finally saw the door at the end of the tunnel. This really was a beastly horrible business, to have made a fearful ordeal out of the journey through the tunnel, which had always been an adventure to him as a boy. Well, Jones had told him, \"A real initiation never ends.\" This walk through the dark legend-haunted underworld— the N or Hades stage of the I.N. R.I. process — had been an- another part of his initiation, another lesson in the courage which the occultist must acquire if he were not to become prey to obsession and possession by every type of demonic entity, real and imaginary. He remembered an American Negro hymn he had once heard: I must walk this lonesome valley I must walk it for myself Nobody else can walk it for me 1 must walk it all alone Understanding suddenly why nun, the fish, was the letter corresponding to this experience of Hades, lord of the underworld; thinking, We do, indeed, begin as fish swim- ming in the amniotic waters of the womb, and the uncon- scious always thinks of death, symbolically, as a return to vvomb; realizing even why the next stage in I. N.R.I, is Risk, the human head itself, corresponding to the dead- and-risen sun gods, Osiris and Apollo. \"The Kingdom of Heaven is within you\": within the head, in the cells of the brain itself.

The cottage was even dirtier and more heavily cob- webbed than Sir John remembered, but the winepress still looked as sturdy and indestructible as ever. Reverend Verey stared at it in some astonishment. \"Good Lord, man,\" he asked, \"what is this?\" He was pointing an angry ringer at the Coat of Arms on the winepress: a dark blue garter with a gold buckle, twen- ty-six gold garters pendant from the collar above it, motto: Honi soit qui mal y pense. \"It's the Order of Saint George,\" Sir John explained, blushing nervously. \"It was given to great-grandfather by the King, for some service to the Crown.\" Thinking: the nightmare is real, there is no masquerade: the name itself is the thing itself. \"Aye, I know that nobody but the King can confer the Order of the Garter,\" Verey said impatiently. \"But why did your great-grandfather impress it on a winepress? That indicates disrespect for the Crown and a libertine humor, I'd say.\" Sir John blushed more deeply. \"Great-grandfather was a bit odd,\" he said. \"There are scandalous legends about him, I'm sorry to admit. He was involved with Sir Francis Dash- wood and the Hellfire Club, some say. Every family has at least one rascal,\" he added pointedly, \"as you must know.\" \"Aye,\" said Verey. \"I mean no disrespect for your fam- ily. But I can see how occult leanings can be in your blood, Sir John, even if you turn them in more Christian direc- tions than your great-grandfather did.\" It was not the most tactful apology, and Sir John found himself thinking of his blood as tainted in a most unwhole- some manner. \"The Order of Saint George is the highest knightly order in Great Britain,\" he said, defending the Babcock genes as if somehow the accusation had arisen that lycanthropy or witchcraft might be a family trait. Verey said, \"Aye, a most exalted honor for any family to receive from the Crown. But is it not more commonly known as the Order of the Garter?\" Sir John found himself blushing again. The hunchbacked clergyman must still be in shock, he"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"200 MASKS OF THE HXUMINATT thought; this was a most inane line of conversation. Still he was stammering as he explained, lamely, \"I study much medieval history. Often, I slip into the old words and terms instead of the more modern ones. The name Order of the Gar Gar Garter was not in common use until the reign of Edward VI, although the Order goes back, as you un- doubtedly know, to Edward III in 1344 and was originally called the Order of Saint George as I just said.\" For some reason, he still felt as if he were in a nightmare. \"Honi soit qui mal y pense,\" the clergyman read from the Coat of Arms. \"A strange motto for a noble order.\" \"Well, you must know the story . . . about the Countess of Salisbury . . .\" Sir John almost had the sensation that the hunchback was cross-examining him on a witness stand. \"She dropped her gar gar garter at a dance, you know, and the King picked it up, when somebody laughed at her, and put it on his own lay lay leg, you know, and said that. Said Honi soit qui mal y pense\" \" 'Evil to him who evil thinks of it,' \" Verey translated. \"It's still a strange story. And why do the Masons wear a garter in their initiations?\" \"My God, man, we must be on our wayl\" Sir John ex- claimed. \"We can't stand here discussing the obscure points of medieval history — \" In a few moments they had made their way around the winepress and out the door into a shaded grove circled on all sides by great oaks. Within the grove, beside the cottage, stood only a ghost-white marble Aphrodite. \"Heathen statues,\" muttered Verey, but this time he seemed more to be talking to himself than to be accusing the Babcock family. The walk through the woods was invigorating, after the underground passage and the idiotic but disturbing conver- sation in the winepress. For a while there, the clergyman had seemed almost demented; or was Sir John merely overly sensitive about great-grandfather's eccentricities? A hidden grove dedicated to wine and Aphrodite . . . the rumors about connections with the libertine Hellfire Club ... a taint in the blood . . . blue garters . . . white stains . . . Verey kept a good pace, despite his age; but Scottish Highlanders are notorious for longevity, even fathering children at advanced ages, it only they were not so inclined"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE DLLUMINATI 201 to telling, with so much ghoulish relish, tales of ghosts and witches \"and things that gae bump i' the night.\" But, of course, that was probably because they experienced more of these things in their cold, dank dark Northern nights. The Rationalist, scorning these simple, rugged people as superstitious, without having lived among them and shared the experiences which gave rise to those eldritch tales, was as naively chauvinistic as the narrow Englishman who re- gards all Frenchmen as immoral or all Italians as treacher- ous. And then remembering that the motto of the Hellfire Club had been \"Do what thou wilt,\" from Rabelais, and their blasphemous ikon or idol, at the deserted abbey Sir Francis Dashwood had purchased for their orgies, was a giant phallus inscribed \"Saviour of the World.\" That very ikon, in fact, had been printed as frontispiece to the lasciv- ious \"Essay on Woman\" clandestinely printed by John Wilkes under the salacious nom de plume \"Pego Borewell\": Wilkes had been expelled from the House of Lords when his authorship of that pamphlet, and his membership in the Hellfire Club, had been exposed by the Earl of Sandwich, himself a former member who had resigned when some horrible Thing (an orang-utan unleashed as a practical joke, Wilkes later claimed) bit him during a Black Mass. All of which was regarded as comical, if unsavory, by most historians; and yet Sir John began to wonder about pos- sible links between that strange cabal and the contemporary Grand Orient lodges of French Masonry, where strange occult and revolutionary doctrines were preached and the mysterious Count Cagliostro was a Grand Master. Were all of these, like the sinister Uluminati of Bavaria, part of the black underground tradition now incarnate in the Ordo Templi (Mentis? \"I heard that story explained once,\" Verey said suddenly. The trees were so thick in here that it was heavily shadowed even now, at midday. O dark, dark amid the blaze of noon, Sir John quoted to himself. \"What story?\" he asked absently. \"The story about King Edward III and the Countess of Salisbury, man,\" Verey said impatiently. \"I don't know if it's true, mind you, but what I heard was that the blue garter was the insignia of a Queen of the Witches in those days. The king, by placing the garter on his own thigh, was"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"202 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI telling everybody that they would have to denounce him to the Inquisition if they dared to denounce her. He may have saved her life. That's the meaning of 'Evil to him who thinks evil of it.' \" It was an unpleasant subject to be discussing with a grieving and somewhat deranged hunchback in such a dark forest. The selva oscura, Sir John thought. \"That doesn't make sense,\" he said irritably, \"unless the King himself were a male witch, or warlock. Is the point of the story to make us wonder if the British monarchy itself might be infested with witchery and diabolism?\" \"I dinna* know,\" Verey said. \"The man who told me this did have some queer notions about the knightly orders of Europe. I gather that he believed the Order of the Garter was the hidden inner circle that governs Freemasonry. Do you happen to know why Masons use garters in their initia- tions?\" Something flapped by overhead with a sound as if of bat's wings. But bats did not fly in the daytime, Sir John reminded himself. \"The history of Freemasonry is very complicated,\" he said. \"I have written a book about it, The Secret Chiefs, and can only claim to have solved about a third of the important historical mysteries. It is true that the King is the head of the Order of the Gar Gar Garter and the Prince of Wales is always made a 33° Freemason, but there is nothing sin sin sinister about it, I assure you. The patron of the Order is Saint George, not Satan.\" \"Of course,\" Verey said apologetically. \"I did say, did I not, that the man who told me all this had many queer notions? He even said the 26 gold garters dependent from the collar had something to do with the Mason Word, but I never understood that. It had something to do with the Jewish Cabala, I believe.\" 26: Sir John remembered: Yod = 10; He = 5; Vau = cond Ut - 5. Total: 26. YHVH, the Holy Unspeak- able Name of God — now, due to the hideous M.M.M., in- extricably linked in his mind with suicide and madness. And hidden in the numerology of the Order of the Garter. The bat-winged thing moved overhead again. It must be an ordinary bird. Bats did not fly at noon. And \"stone Id not walk in the twilight.\" Where had he read that? \"It is a queer I all around,\" Verey muttered."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATE 203 Was the whole Order of Knights Templar of Jerusalem not convicted of the unnatural sin of sodomy?\" \"Dash it all!\" Babcock burst out. \"You have it all con- fused, Reverend.

The bat wings flapped again. \"I know nothing of such matters,\" Verey said humbly. \"I am merely reporting the opinions of a man I admitted was possessed of odd notions. Secret societies do arouse much speculation, you know. Everybody asks: If they have nothing to hide, why are they secret?\" The more the senile old fool apologized, the more offensive he became. Sir John turned to issue a final crush- ing retort but then saw the paleness of Verey's face and the lines of pain around his eyes and mouth. The old man had suffered much and deserved great tolerance. Besides, the true Brother of the Rose Croix was patient and in- finitely compassionate toward those ignorant of the mys- teries. Sir John said nothing and trudged on. The bat-flapping receded behind them. Probably it had only been an ordinary bird, magnified by imagination and suggestion. Then a clearing emerged and the towers of Greystoke were visible in the distance. \"There it is,\" Sir John exclaimed, once again thrilled by a sense of adolescent adventure. \"Our doorway to escape and to our own surprise counter-attack.\" q: Cite a contemporary historian, with sufficient brevity to avoid litigation about copyrights, in re: the Countess of Salisbury and the Order of the Garter. a: \"Though the story may be apocryphal, there may be a substratum of truth in it.

Kenneth Campbell of 201 Paul Street proved to be, as Jones had promised, formidable. He stood somewhere around six and a half feet tall and must have weighed twenty stone. A large poster on his wall showed him, grimacing horribly, under the caption the Liverpool mangler. One did not need the talents of Sherlock Holmes to deduce that Campbell was a wrestler. \"It's a kip what feeds me,\" Campbell said, recognizing Babcock as a gentleman. \"Not very hoity-toity, I'll admit, but what prawce dignity when the belly's empty, eh, mate?\" Prawce, Babcock decoded, was Liverpoolese for price. \"Wrestling was regarded as an accomplishment every gentleman should master in the Athens of Socrates,\" he said reassuringly. \"Socrates?\" Campbell was delighted. \"Wasn't he the bloke what drank the poison to show the bleedin' bastards they couldn't frighten him? Begging your pardon, Rever- end.\" Babcock could not bear to look at Verey's face. \"Socrates was indeed a very brave man,\" he said evasively. \"Brave?\" Campbell shook his head. \"1 was in Her Maj- esty's Army during the Boer Uprising,\" he said. \"I know oil abaht bravery, guv'nor. It isn't bravery when you sits yourself down and drinks poison to prove a point. Could you do it? Could 1 <\\o it? Could the bravest manjack in the army do it on your bleeding life Ibeg your pardon, Reverend). That ain't bravery. That's something else.\" A phile ft] wrestler, Babcock thought; but what other sort of wrestler would Jones know? Another of us? There"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 205 was no point in asking. \"What is it that Socrates had that goes beyond bravery?\" he inquired instead. \"I dunno,\" the wrestler said. \"I guess it's the state beyond humanity, the Next Step that Jones is always talking abaht.\" \"Socrates was a heathen,\" Verey said suddenly. \"He was unfaithful to his wife both with another woman and with Alcibiades, with whom he had unnatural relations. He may have been brave and wise, but he is most certainly burning in Hell right now.\" The wrestler's face fell. \"Don't be too strict, Vicar,\" he said, looking hurt. \"None of us is perfect.\" Fortunately, Jones arrived just then and Babcock was spared the ordeal of listening to Socrates' morals debated by a naive giant and a self-righteous hunchback. \"Ah, Kenneth, my man,\" Jones beamed, taking the wres- tler's hand in a grip Babcock did not recognize. \"You are looking splendid!\" The grip was not used in the Golden Dawn; Babcock surmised it was a Scottish Rite grip. 'T have another five good years, maybe,\" the giant said modestly. \"Then, if I haven't earned enough to buy a shop or a pub, it's back to the army for the likes of me.\" \"Back to the army?\" Jones said. \"I think not. I have never understood how you came through one war alive; an enemy needs to be nearly blind to miss a target your size. We could never allow you to come to that pass again. Remem- ber the widow's son.\" The last phrase confirmed Sir John's guess; it was the formula describing all charitable activities of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite Freemasons. Probably Jones, Like Robert Wentworth Little, founder of the Golden Dawn, had been in the Ancient and Accepted Lodge ori- ginally, as Campbell still obviously was. \"Reverend Verey,\" Jones was saying, shaking the clergy- man's hand warmly and clapping him on the shoulder, \"I cannot express how deeply I sympathize with you in this time of grief. I can assure you that I, and the Order I represent, will see to it that no further tragedies occur, and that the villains responsible for your grief will receive a just punishment for their crimes.\" \"It is in God's hands,\" Verey said woodenly, regressing back into the emotionless emptiness of the typical shock"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"206 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATE reaction. It comes in waves, Babcock thought, remembering his own grief when his parents died. \"God's hands? That will not do,\" Jones said sharply, staring into the clergyman's eyes in a way Babcock had never seen before. \"We are God's hands,\" Jones went on, solemnly, \"and we have been set here in this world to execute His righteousness. Else is our religion mere theat- rics.\" Verey turned away, obviously fighting back tears. \"God forgive me,\" he said, \"that I, an ordained clergyman, should need to be reminded of that.\" Jones softened his tone. \"You will not need to be re- minded again,\" he said. \"You will not doubt again, nor will you despair.\" He turned the clergyman around, gently, and stared into his eyes again. \"You know I speak truth,\" he said. \"Yes,\" Verey said. \"My God, who are you?\" \"An ordinary man,\" Jones said. \"But one trained, a little, in certain arts of healing. For instance\" — he touched Verey's forehead — \"I can feel the anguish draining away from you right now. You will not again despair of the good- ness of God or ask Job's questions. In a short while, you will rest.\" The Brother of the Rosy Cross, Babcock remembered, is permitted to perform healings in emergenices, although in all other ways he must hide his superhuman status from the humans among whom he walks. Jones moved his hand to Verey's chest. \"Yes,\" he said, \"your breathing is much better now. Your heart chakra is less agitated. We humans are God's hands, and He acts through us, it' we allow Him,\" he repeated. He grasped Verey's shoulders and ran his hands swiftly down the clergyman's arms, ending by grasping both hands warmly. \"You have suffered much, but now you can rest. Remem- ber: 'For He is like a refiner's fire.' \" ' Sir John re-experienced his excitement every time he had heard Handel's setting of that Biblical verse; it had always heen his favorite part of The Messiah. The Vril energy was flowing through him, as when he first translated I.

The Liverpool Mangier ushered the old hunchback to a bedroom and returned, awed. \"Out lahk a baby,\" he said. \"Every time I see you do that, guv'nor, it fair gives me the shakes.\" \"With seven years of concentrated effort you could do it as quickly and efficiently,\" Jones said. \"Was it Mesmerism?\" Babcock asked. \"Yes,\" Jones said. \"A much more efficient system than the hypnotism invented by Mesmer's ignorant nineteenth- century imitators, although, as I said, it takes longer to learn.\" \"Gor,\" said the Liverpool Mangier, \"was Mesmer in the Craft, too?\" \"In a Grand Orient lodge,\" Jones said. Babcock was stunned. \"But my researches have led me to believe the Grand Orient lodges were infiltrated by the atheistic Bavarian Illuminati and are still allied with the Ordo Templi Orientis!\" \"It does get rather complicated,\" Jones admitted. \"The names mean nothing. You must remember that in addition to the Golden Dawn there are several dozen groups in Eu- rope claiming to be carrying on the work of the original Rose Croix college. And that half the Masonic lodges in England itself do not recognize the other half as legitimate. And, for that matter, the Golden Dawn itself has several competitors using the same name, run by A. E. Waite and Michael Brodie-Innes and others, including the one headed by that scoundrel Crowley himself.\" Curiouser and curiouser, as Alice once said. . . . \"I begin to perceive,\" Sir John said carefully, \"that in joining an occult lodge one does not know what one is joining \" \"The names mean nothing,\" Jones repeated. \"By their fruits shall ye know them\" \"Well, yes,\" Sir John said, \"but . . .\" \"Now is not the time to re-examine the history of the Invisible College and its offshoots and counterfeits,\" Jones said. \"I have a task for you this evening, and there is work I must see to myself. Let us leave poor Verey here, under the protection of the Liverpool Mangier, and be on our way. The king is castled and now is the time for a gambit of our own.\" So Sir John found himself out on the street and ushered"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"208 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI into a hansom cab before he could quite grasp the accelera- tion of events. \"I had my secretary fetch me a copy of the Inverness Express- Journal this afternoon,\" Jones said, over the horse's hoofbeats. \"Here, take a look at this before we talk fur- ther.\" Sir John took the newspaper clipping Jones extended and read: THE CASE OF THE CONSTANT SUICIDES Terror Stalks Loch Ness; Police Baffled INVERNESS, APRIL 23, 1914-lnspector James Mcintosh of the Inverness Police Force is facing a mystery more terrible than anything in the tales of Poe or Conan Doyle. . • • Sir John skimmed the rest of the news story quickly. \"Do you see what this means?\" Jones asked. \"By tomor- row this story will be picked up by every London newspaper; mark my words. It may become the biggest horror-scare since Jack the Ripper was prowling the East End. Continental papers will have it by next week.\" \"Is that bad or good?\" Babcock asked, pocketing the story. Jones was exasperated. \"It's the very worst thing that could happen,\" he said with grinding patience. \"You should understand by now that human belief-systems determine human experience. Why do you think the Invisible College remains Invisible? Why do you suppose we don't perform miracles on every street corner and convert the multitudes? Don't you realize that the philosophy of materialism is the best thing that ever happened to Europe?\" \"You are talking in paradoxes,\" Sir John complained, noticing that the fog outside was beginning to thicken. The clip-clop of the horse's hooves seemed to be carrying them into a realm more mysterious than any of his dreams or tl visions of Chapel Perilous. Jones sighed. \"Have you noticed,\" he asked patiently, it happens when a haunted-house story appears in the"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 209 press? Five more haunted houses are reported, from other parts of the country, within a week. You could not astrally project until you began to believe you could. Cabala was nonsense, until you began to believe it was sense. Why do you think Buddha said, 'All that we are is the result of all that we have thought'? Do you know why we drum it into every Probationer's skull that 'Fear is failure, and the forerunner of failure'? Short of a perfectly Illuminated being, all of us see and experience only what we are pre- pared to see and experience. A newspaper story like this, once it gets picked up and repeated, will open thousands — hundreds of thousands— to similar invasions by the powers of darkness. Every person who reads about events like these is more likely, to a slight degree, to become open to attack by them. Books on such subjects are poison. Why, man, we not only refuse to combat the spread of materi- alism and atheism; we have positively encouraged them!\" \"Encouraged them?\" Sir John was aghast. \"Of course!\" Jones cried. \"The ancient Mysteries were closed to all but a small elite, as you know. That was not aristocratic snobbery but pragmatic wisdom. The less the average man or woman knows about such things, the better for them. Only those who have been specially trained, intellectually and morally, can deal with these Forces safely.\" Sir John mulled this over for a few minutes. \"You think this view unliberal,\" Jones said. iC But con- sider the happy results. The uneducated masses have a simple faith, which protects them in most cases from in- vasions like this horror at Loch Ness. The equally autom- atized morons turned out in platoons by the universities have a simple skepticism, which also protects them. It is satisfactory all around, and the best accommodation to the age of science possible until human nature is transformed. The ordinary person, if he leaves both faith and skepticism behind and begins to experiment in this area — as you have — would be insane in six months without very careful guidance of the sort I attempt to give you.\" \"Yes,\" Sir John said. \"It is against Liberal principles, but you are right.

Sir John felt the light flashing all over the cab's interior before he could quite focus on the object itself. \"What is it?\" he asked. \"A pentacle, similar to those used in all magical invoca- tions,\" Jones said. \"This one happens to be charged with the entire concentrated spiritual power of the forty-five hundred years of our Order — for we are far older than you guessed, even in the most daring passages of your books. It is also constructed according to special optical principle Sir John found that he could not, however hard he tried, see the pentacle clearly.

It is the very model of the Cabalistic universe, wherein each part contains and reflects every other part — an analogy of the Undivided Light. Beautiful, is it not? Yet it is but a model, a partial rendering of the divine effulgence you will some day experience when you attain to what we very inadequately call the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.\" Sir John found that he was hallucinating mildly. \"It is like ether,\" he said, \"or some exotic drug like hasheesh. . . .\" \"It will not do to stare into it too long on first encounter,\" Jones said. \"Take it. Put it within your vest pocket, over the heart. You will experience no fear, and will be in no danger, while the talisman is on your person.\" Sir John took the seemingly self-effulgent talisman and felt a distinct tingle as he placed it within his vest. \"By George,\" he said. \"I can really feel it. I'm ready to face the Devil himself.\" \"You will be called on for nothing so melodramatic,\" Jones said. \"You are, in fact, merely going to sit through a lecture by Mr. Aleister Crowley.

The books ranged from the sparkling-new to the shabby secondhand and seemed to cover a broad spectrum: signs divided the rows under such labels as taoism, buddhism, vedanta, cabala, sufism, theosophy, psychic research, and so forth. Sir John appreciated to the full Jones' remark about the absurdity of asking Scotland Yard to put such an establish- ment under surveillance in this land of liberty and this age of enlightenment. A large poster announced: TONIGHT AT 8 \"The Soldier and the Hunchback\" a lecture on mysticism and rationalism by Sir Aleister Crowley free to all 215"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"216 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI This was illustrated by a photo of Crowley, his face totally expressionless, eyes locked directly on the camera and thus seeming to stare directly out at the viewer: but the eyes, like the face, revealed absolutely nothing. Even stranger, the face did not seem to be hiding anything, though it showed nothing: it was simply a face. Had Crow- ley put himself into some kind of highly concentrated trance when the photo was being taken? He was neither handsome nor ugly (although Sir John remembered that Crowley as a youth had been called the handsomest man in London) and might have been anywhere from forty to fifty. It was the face, Sir John realized, of a man who had perfect self-control. Sir John looked at the title of the lecture: \"The Soldier and the Hunchback.\" If Verey was the hunchback, who was the soldier? Himself? Jones? Crowley? Or was he at- tributing too much prescience to Enemy Intelligence? The title might have no personal meaning at all. One shelf was labeled ordo templi orientis — the name of the clandestine Masonic order which owned this book- store and required all members to sign three copies of that nihilistic Act of Faith beginning, \"There is no God but Man.* 1 Sir John examined this curiously: most of the material was in the form of pamphlets or old books by such authors as Karl Kellner, Adam Weishaupt, Leopold Bagels, P. B. Randolph, Theodore Reuss — almost all of it in German — but there were also several books by Aleister Crowley himself. Sir John picked out a Crowley volume entitled, with ntery, The Book of Lies. Opening it, he found the title page:"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 217 THE BOOK OF LIES WHICH IS ALSO FALSELY CALLED BREAKS THE WANDERINGS OR FALSIFICATIONS OF THE ONE THOUGHT OF FRATER PERDURABO WHICH THOUGHT IS ITSELF UNTRUE Despite himself, Sir John grinned. This was a variation on the Empedoclean paradox in logic, which consists of the question: \"Empedocles, the Cretan, says that every- thing Cretans say is a lie; is Empedocles telling the truth?\" Of course, if Empedocles is telling the truth, then — since his statement \"everything Cretans say is a lie\" is the"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"218 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI truth — he must also be lying. On the other hand, if Em- pedocles is lying, then everything Cretans say is not a lie, and he might be telling the truth. Crowley's title page was even more deliberately perverse: if the book is \"also falsely called Breaks,\" then (because of the \"also\") the original title is false, too, and it is not a book of lies at all. But, on the other hand, since it is the \"falsifications ... of the one thought . . . which is itself untrue,\" it is the negation of the untrue and, therefore, true. Or was it? Sir John turned to the first chapter and found it con- sisted of a single symbol, the question mark: Well, compared with the title, that was at least brief. Sir John turned the page to the second chapter and found equal brevity: I What kind of a joke was this? Sir John turned to Chapter 3, and his head spun: Nothing is. Nothing becomes. Nothing is not. The first two statements were the ultimate in nihilism; but the third sentence, carrying nihilism one step further, brought in the Empedoclean paradox again, for it con- tradicted itself. If 'nothing is not,\" then something if. . . . What else was in this remarkable tome? Sir John started flipping pages and abruptly found himself facing, at Chap- ter 77, a photograph of Lola Levine. It was captioned \"L.A.Y.L.A.H.\" I he photo and the caption made up the entire chapter. Lola was seen from the waist up and was shamelessly naked, although as a concession to English morality her hair hung down to cover most of her ore. Sir John, on a hunch, counted eabalistically. Lamed was 30, plus Alcph is 1, plus Yod is 10, plus second Lame 30, plus second Alcph is 1 again, plus He is 5; total, 77, the"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 219 imber of the chapter. And Laylah was not just a loose •ansliteration of Lola; it was the Arabic word for \"night.\" id 77 was the value of the curious Hebrew word which leant either \"courage\" or \"goat\": Oz. The simple photo id caption, were saying, to the skilled Cabalist, that Lola 'as the priestess incarnating the Night of Pan, the dissolu- tion of the ego into void. . . . Sir John decided to buy The Book of Lies; it would be interesting, and perhaps profitable, to gain further insight into the mind of the Enemy, however paradoxical and per- verse might be its expressions. He approached the counter, and found with discomfort that the clerk seated there was Lola Levine herself. Since he had just been looking at a photo of her, naked from the waist up, he blushed and stammered as he said, \"I'd like to buy this.\" \"One pound six, sir,\" Lola said, with no more flicker of expression than any other clerk. Sir John realized that it had been nearly three years since the one occasion on which they had met on the Earth-plane; she had no reason to remember him. Then, was it possible that all the astral visions in which she tormented and attempted to seduce him were the product of his own impure imagination? Or were those visions as real as they seemed, and was she merely a consummate actress and hypocrite? It was the metaphysical equivalent of the Empedoclean paradox. A stout, elderly woman with a Cornish accent asked Lola, \"I'm planning to stay for the lecture. Is it pronounced Crouly or Crowley?\" \"It is pronounced Crawly,\" said a voice from the door. \"To remind you that I'm holy. But my enemies say Crouly, in wish to treat me foully.\" Sir John turned and saw Aleister Crowley, bowing po- litely to the Cornish woman as he completed his jingle. Crowley was a man of medium height, dressed in a con- servative pinstripe suit jarringly offset by a gaudy blue scarf in place of the tie and with a green Borsalino hat worn at a rakish angle. It was the outfit an artist on the Left Bank might wear, to show that he had become successful; it was definitely eccentric for London. The Cornish woman stared. \"Are you really the Great Magician, as people say?\" \"No,\" said Crowley at once. \"I am the most dedicated enemy of the Great Magician.\" And he swept past imperi- ously."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"220 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI The Cornish lady gasped. \"What did he mean by that?\" she asked nobody in particular. Sir John understood, but wasted no time trying to ex- plain. Crowley was heading for the lecture room and Sir John followed him closely, wanting a seat up front where he could observe the Master of the M.M.M. most closely. The paradox had been typical of Crowley's style: he re- ferred, obviously, to the Gnostic teaching that the sensory universe was a delusion, created by the Devil, to prevent humanity from seeing the Undivided Light of Divinity itself. A strange joke to come from a Satanist; but, of course, some Gnostics had taught that Jehovah, creator of the material universe, was the Devil, the Great Magician. The Bible begins with Beth, according to this teaching, because Beth is the letter of the Magician in the Tarot, the Lord of the Abyss of Hallucinations. . . . The lecture room was filling rapidly and Sir John scam- pered into a front-row seat. He noticed that Crowley had lowered his head and closed his eyes, obviously preparing himself for the lecture by some method of invocation or meditation. Behind him on the wall was a large silver star with an eye in its center, a symbol associated (Sir John knew) with both the goddess Isis and the Dog Star, Sirius. \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,\" Crowley intoned suddenly, without raising his head. Then he looked about the room whimsically. \"It is traditional in the great Order which I humbly represent,\" he went on, \"to begin all ceremonies and lec- tures with that phrase. Like Shakespeare's Ducdame, it is a great banishing ritual against fools, most of whom leave the room at once on hearing it uttered. Observing no stampede to the doors 1 can only wonder if a miracle is occurring tonight and I am speaking, for once, to an English audience that docs not consist mostly of fools.\" Sir John smiled in spite of himself. \"My topic tonight,\" Crowley went on, \"is the soldier and the hunchback. Those are poetic terms I regularly employ to designate the two most interesting punctuation marks in general use throughout Europe — the exclamation point and the question mark.

Who or what put us here? What if anything can we do about it? How do we get started? Where shall wisdom be found? Why was I born? Who am I? \"Unless you are confronted with immediate survival problems, due to poverty or to the deliberate choice of an adventurous life, these hunchbacks will arise in your mind several times in an ordinary hour,\" Crowley said. \"They are generally pacified or banished by reciting the official answers of the tribe into which you were born, or simply deciding that they are unanswerable.\" Some how- ever, Crowley went on, cannot rest in either blind tradition or resigned agnosticism, and must seek answers for them- selves, based on experience. Ordinary people, he said, are in a sense totally asleep and do not even know it; those who persist in asking the questions can be described as struggling toward wakefulness. The soldier, or exclamation point, he continued, repre- sents the moment of insight or intuition in which a ques- tion is answered, as in the expressions \"Aha!\" or \"Eureka!\" \"I now present you, gratis, two of the nastiest hunch- backs I know,\" Crowley said, smiling wickedly. \"These two are presented to every candiate who comes to our Order seeking the Light. Here they are: \"Number One: Why, of all the mystical and occult teachers in the world, did you come to me? \"Number Two: Why, of all the days in your life, on this particular day? \"That is all you need to know,\" Crowley said. \"I might as well leave the platform now, since, if you can answer those questions, you are already Illuminated; and if you cannot, you are such dunces that further words are wasted on you. But I will take mercy on you and give you the rest of the lecture, anyway.\" Crowley went on to define the state of modern philosophy (post-David Hume) as \"an assembly of hunchbacks.\" Everything has been called into question; every axiom has been challenged — \"including Euclid's geometry among modern mathematicians\"; nothing is certain anymore."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"222 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINAT1 On all sides, Crowley said, we see only more hunch- backs — questions, questions, questions. Traditional mysticism, Crowley continued, is a regiment of soldiers. The mystic, he said, having attained an \"Aha!\" or \"Eureka!\" experience — a sudden intuitive insight into the invisible reality behind the subjective deceptions of the senses — is apt to be so delighted with himself that he never asks another question and stops thinking entirely. Out of this error, Crowley warned, flows dogmatic religion, \"a force almost as dangerous to true mysticism as it is to scientific or political freedom.\" The path of true Illumination, Crowley proceeded, walk- ing to a blackboard at the right of the room, does not consist of one intuitive insight after another. It is not a parade of soldiers, \"like this,\" he said, writing on the board: I!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \"Anybody in that state is an imbecile or a catatonic, how- ever blissful his lunacy may be,\" Crowley said sternly. The true path of the Illuminati, Crowley stated more em- phatically, is a series of soldiers and hunchbacks in ever- accelerating series, which he sketched as: I?!?!?!?!?!?!?! etc. \"To rest at any point, either in intuitive certainty or doubtful questioning,\" he said flatly, \"is to stagnate. Always seek the higher vision, whatever states of ecstatic insight you may have reached. Always ask the next harder ques- tion, whatever questions you may have answered. The Light you are seeking is quite correctly called ain soph auer in Cabala — the limitless light — and it has, quite literally, the characteristics mathematicians such as Cantor have demon- strated belong to Infinity. As the Upanishads say, 'You can empty infinity from it, and infinity still remains.' However deep your union with the Light, it can become deeper, whether you call it Christ or Buddha or Brahm or Pan. Since I am, thank God\" he said the last two words with great piety, \"an Atheist, 1 prefer to call it Nothing — since"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"t MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATT 223 ything we say about it is finite and limited, whereas it is infinite and unlimited.\" Crowley proceeded to discourse on the infinite with great detail, summarizing mathematical theories on the subject with remarkable erudition and felicity. \"But all this,\" he ended, \"is not the true infinite. It is only what our little monkey-minds have been able to comprehend so far. Ask the next question. Seek the higher vision. That is the path that unites mysticism and rationalism, and transcends both of them. As a great Poet has written: We place no reliance On Virgin or Pigeon; Our method is Science, Our^im is Religion. Those blessed words!\" he said raptly. \"Holy be the name of the sage who wrote them!\" At this point Sir John was far from sure whether he had been listening to the highest wisdom or the most pretentious mumbo jumbo he had ever heard. The Divine No-Thing was much like certain concepts in Buddhism and Taoism, but it was also a nice way of seeming to utter profundities while actually talking nonsense. But then, of course, Crowley's whole point had been that anything said about infinity was itself Nothing in comparison with in- finity itself. . . . With a start, Sir John realized that the lecture was over. The audience was applauding, somewhat tentatively, most of them as confused by what they had heard as Sir John himself. \"You may now,\" Crowley said carelessly, \"unburden yourselves of the thoughts with which you passed the time while pretending to listen attentively to me; but in accord with English decorum and the rituals of the public lecture, you must phrase these remarks in the form of questions.\" There was a nervous laugh. \"What about Christ?\" The speaker was a redfaced man with a walrus mustache; he seemed more irritated by what he had heard than the rest of the audience. \"You didn't say nuthin' about Christ,\" he added aggrievedly. \"A lamentable oversight,\" Crowley said unctuously. \"What about Christ, indeed?

With horror he realized that such overwhelming of his mind was possible: Crowley did possess charm, magnetism and charisma, like many ser- vants of the Demon. What was it Pope had written about Vice? A creature of such hideous mein/That to be hated needs but be seen/ But something something something/ We first pity, then endure, then embrace. . . . \"Many things are inevitable,\" Crowley was saying. \"The tides. The seasons. The fact that the questions after a lecture seldom have anything to do with the content of the lecture. . . .\" What do you seek? The Light. The limitless light: ain soph oner. And the darkness knew it not. . . . \"What about the Magick Will?\" Sir John asked suddenly, during a pause. \"Ah,\" Crowley said. \"That is & Significant Question.\" Somehow he conveyed the mocking capitals by his intona- tion. \"Such questions deserve to be answered with demon- strations, not with mere windy words. Laylah,\" he called to the back of the room. \"Could you bring the psychoboulo- meter?\" Lola approached the podium with something that looked hideously like a medieval thumb-screw. \"There is firstly conscious will,\" Crowley was saying, looking directly at Sir John. \"We all attempt to exercise | this every day. 7 will give up smoking.' 7 will be true to my wife.' Ninety-nine times out of a hundred such resolutions fail, because they are in conflict with the force that really j controls us, Unconscious Will, which can not be frustrated. Indeed, even the profane psychologists have rediscovered what the mystics always knew: Unconscious Will, if pre- vented from acting, returns in the night to haunt our dreamt. And sometimes it returns in the daytime, too, hj the form of irrational behaviors which we cannot under- stand. Magick Will should not be confused with either of these, because it includes both and is greater than both. To perform an act of Magick Will is to achieve the Great Work, I might Bay.

The needle on the boulometer — my own addition to this toy — will register how far you are able to withstand pain by sheer Will; 10 is a good score, and means you are a mere jellyfish. How far do you think you can go?\" Sir John felt every eye in the room upon him. He wanted to cry, \"I am not such a fool as to torture myself for your amusement,\" but — he was even more afraid of appearing a public coward. Is that why people go into armies? he asked himself grimly. . . . \"Very well,\" he said coldly, inserting his thumb. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.

And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering,"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"226 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them to- gether. And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, unto thy hands I commend my spirit; and hav- ing said thus, he gave up the ghost. \"You've only reached two in the boulometer,\" Crowley said. \"The audience will think you're not trying, sir.\" \"Damn you!\" Sir John whispered, perspiration cold on his back. \"I am done with this cruel joke. Let us see how much better your Magick Will can do!\" \"Certainly,\" Crowley said calmly. He inserted his thumb into the cruel mechanism, and began turning the vise with slow deliberation. Not a muscle moved in his face. (Sir John suspected that he had gone into a trance.) The needle on the boulometer crept slowly, accompanied by gasps from the audience, all the way to 10. \"That,\" said Crowley gently, \"might pass for an ele- mentary demonstration of Magick Will.\" There was a burst of spontaneous applause. \"It will also do,\" Crowley said, \"as an illustration of our thesis about the soldier and the hunchback. The first rule of our Magick is: never believe anything you hear and doubt most of what you see.\" He turned the \"psycho- boulometer\" around, revealing that he had disengaged the screw and had been turning the handle without actually tightening the vise. There was an angry gasp. \"Oh,\" Crowley said, \"are you feeling cheated? Remember this, then: you are cheated the same way every time emo- tional turmoil or fixed ideas distort your perception of what is actually before your eyes. And remember to look for the hunchback behind every soldier.\" The audience began to file out, muttering and chattering as excitedly as a group of chimpanzees who had just found i a mirror. And then Sir John realized that Crowley had descended from the podium and was approaching him. \"Sir John Babcock,\" Crowley said warmly, \"did you i ever hear the story of the man with a mongoose in his battel At least, unlike Lola, Crowley wasn't pretending not to recognize Sir John. \"What mongoose?\" Babcock asked care- i fully."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ELLUMINAT1 227 \"It was on a train,\" Crowley said. \"This chap had a basket under his seat and another passenger asked him what was in it.

'What on earth do you want with a mongoose?' *Well/ said our hero, 'my brother drinks a great deal more than is good for him, and sometimes he sees snakes. So I turn the mongoose on them.' The other passenger was baffled by this logic. 'But those are imaginary snakes!' he exclaimed. 'Aha!' said our hero. 'Do you think I don't know that? But this is an imaginary mongoose!* \" Sir John laughed nervously. \"That's the way it is with talismans,\" Crowley said. \"When a phantom climbs, the ghost of a ladder serves him. But do keep that pentacle in your vest if it makes you feel better. I must go now. We shall meet again.\" And Sir John stared as Crowley made his way to the back of the room, where he greeted Lola with a kiss. He whis- pered something; they both turned and looked back at Sir John; they waved cheerfully. And then they were gone. DE ARTE ALCHEMICA When Sir John arrived at Jones' home in Soho, he re- counted his experience at the M.M.M. bookstore in detail. \"Crowley did not attempt to cajole me into giving him the talisman,\" he concluded with some asperity. \"He treated it with total contempt.\" \"The man does have an Iron Will,\" Jones admitted, \"but do not be deceived by his play-acting. Underneath, he knows we are on the counterattack now, and he must be afraid.\" Sir John asked with suffocating restraint, \"Are you really quite sure of that?\" \"We both need a good night's sleep,\" Jones said, as if ignoring the question. \"I will show you to the guest room. Before retiring, meditate a bit on the Parable of the Imaginary Mongoose. It has many levels of meaning. . . .\" In fact, Sir John found that he was too tired to reflect much on the Imaginary Mongoose when he was settled into his room. He slipped into sleep quickly and dreamed things he was unable to remember in the morning, although he awoke with a vague memory of Sir Talister Crowley"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"228 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI and a giant mongoose pursuing him through Chapel Peri- lous. After washing and dressing, Sir John remembered that he still had the copy of The Book of Lies he had purchased at M.M.M. He decided to try Bibliomancy-in-reverse and see what the Enemy had to offer in the way of an oracle. Opening at random, he found Chapter 50: In the forest God met the Stag-beetle. \"Hold! Worship me!\" quoth God. \"For I am the All- Great, All-Good, All- Wise The stars are but sparks from the forges of My smiths. \"Yea, verily and Amen,\" said the Stag-beetle, \"all this I do believe, and that devoutly.\" \"Then why do you not worship Me?\" \"Because I am real and you are only imaginary.\" But the leaves of the forest rustled with the laughter of the wind. Said Wind and Wood: \"They neither of them know anything!\" \"Damn, blast and thunder!\" Sir John exploded. The beetle denies God, but wind and wood deny the beetle also. It was the Imaginary Mongoose riddle again, on a more Empedoclean level. Going down the stairs in search of breakfast, Sir John experimented with solipsism. Perhaps there are no gods or beetles — or perhaps the whole world is, as the Gnostics claimed, the Abyss of Hallucinations, the Devil's Mas- querade. But then we must consider David Hume's argu- ment: the same skepticism can be applied to the Self. Am ally here? Are only the egoless wind and wood real? If phantoms descend, do the ghosts of stairs serve them? Dr. Johnson refuted that philosophy by kicking a rock. Sir John refuted it by remembering that he really was hun- gry. Eggs and muilins were real enough to be desirable at this hour, and his stomach was real enough to desire them. To his astonishment he found Jones eating breakfast with the Rev. Verey. . \"1 thought we were going to keep him safe with tne Liverpool Mangier,\" he said, confused."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 229 \"Our plans have changed totally since I spoke to the Inner Head of the Order last night.

But eat first, Sir John; the muffins are delicious.\" Sir John allowed it to go at that for a while; he was in- deed ravenously hungry. Verey had been reading the same newspaper article Jones had shown Sir John the previous evening. \"It is full of errors,\" he complained. \"Bobbie McMaster hasna' been forty-three for a long time; he's at least as old as I am. And that headless woman who haunts Geen Carrig is not new; she has been observed there for as many centuries as Anne Boleyn has been seen haunting the Tower of London. Why can reporters never get anything right?\" \"I believe Bernard Shaw has explained that,\" Jones said, adding lemon to his tea, Paris style. \"In almost all other professions a man must be able to observe carefully and report accurately what he has seen. Those qualifications are unnecessary for journalists, however, since their job is to write sensational stories that sell newspapers. Hence, all the incompetents who are not capable of normal accuracy in observation or memory fail in most other professions and many of them eventually drift into journalism.\" \"Aha!\" said Sir John, who had often wondered why nothing in the papers was ever accurate. Of course: any chemist or grocer or ordinary man, asked to describe this breakfast, would report correctly that it consisted of eggs, ham and muffins, with tea. A journalist would report por- ridge, bacon and toast, with a sex orgy and a murder. Truth! Truth!

He had majored in organic chemistry at Cambridge and I remember asking him why, since I saw nothing of the scientific temperament in him. I have never forgotten his answer. 4 My personality is entirely poetic, esthetic and Romantic,' he said. 'I needed some work in hard science to bring me down to earth.' I thought it an astonishing example of self-insight and self- discipline in one so young.\" Jones went on to tell of Crowley's rapid rise in the Golden Dawn. \"I never saw a man with such a natural apti- tude for Cabalistic Magick,\" he said frankly. Then came the disaster of 1900, when the feud between William Butler Yeats and McGregor Mathers exploded into a dozen lesser feuds which split the Golden Dawn into factions which were never re-united. Jones lost track of Crowley for some years, although he heard of Crowley's travels to study Yoga in the Far East and Sufism in North Africa. In 1902, Crow- ley and a German engineer, Oscar Eckenstein, succeeded in climbing higher on Chogo Ri in the Himalayas than any expedition before or since, reaching twenty-three thousand feet. In 1905, Crowley went to China, and when he re- turned he was a completely new man. \"I remember,\" Jones said, \"my naive response when we met again in 1906. I found him so changed that I actually believed he was a totally Illuminated being, beyond any other Golden Dawn graduate. I asked him how he had achieved that, and he said simply, 1 became a little child.' \" They were crossing Rupert Street and Jones smiled iron- ically. \"My illusions about him did not last long,\" he said. \"That very same year he published the infamous Bhag-i- Muatur, which he claimed was a translation from the Per- sian. It was nothing of the sort. Crowley had always been a great admirer of the late Sir Richard Burton and was merely copying his hero, who had published the Hasidah —"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"232 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI a blunt statement of Atheistic philosophy — as a translation from the Arabic, when it was actually his own work. The Bhag-i-Muatur, a title which translates as The Scented Garden,' was similarly Crowley's own work disguised as a translation. It was, on the surface, an allegory about the Soul's relationship to God. Actually, carefully read, it was a glorification of sodomy.\" Shortly thereafter Crowley was divorced by his wife for adultery and began to live as shamelessly as Oscar Wilde before his trials, flaunting his numerous affairs, both heterosexual and homosexual, as if he took a special diabolical delight in shocking Christian sensibilities. In the following years, Crowley divided his time between London, Paris and the North African deserts. In 1909, he staged a spectacle called \"The Rites of Eleusis\" at a London theater and aroused a storm of controversy. The \"rites\" began with a chorus informing the audience, Nietzsche- fashion, that \"God is dead.\" The following ceremony in- cluded ballet, music, ritual, poetry and the serving to the audience of an alleged \"elixir of the gods\" (which some later suspected contained a mind-altering drug) and ended with the announcement that a new God had been born, a \"Lord of Force and Fire\" Who would destroy Western civilization and create, out of its ruins, a new civilization based on the Rabelaisian slogan: \"Do what thou wilt.\" 'The man is daft,\" Verey repeated, with cold fury. Since 1910, Jones continued, Crowley had been the En- glish leader of the Ordo Templi Orientis, a Berlin-based Masonic order which claimed to retain the primordial Ma- sonic secrets in purer form than any other group. The Outer Head of the order, Jones said, was Theodore Reuss actor who was also an agent for the German secret pol \"Does Scotland Yard know this?\" Sir John exclaimed. \"Oh, indeed,\" Jones said. 4 'So does Army Intelligence, They watch Reuss carefully but never interfere with him, since his area of operations is restricted to spying on Ger- \\ man exiles in England. He was for a long time an associate I Of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and their circle.\" Jones went on to speak of the links between the Ordo i Tempi] Orientis and certain dervish orders in the Near East said to be connected with the Young Turks who had over- turned the monarchy and introduced parliamentary de- racy.

Ever since the Berlin-to-Baghdad Railway was built in '96,\" Jones went on, \"some in our government have sus- pected Germany of intending to replace us in India, but now every major Power suspects every other Power of similar designs.\" \"This grows deeper and darker as you proceed,\" Sir John complained. \"Are we dealing with a spiritual war be- tween rival theologies or an economic war between rival commercial interests?\" \"We are talking about Total War,\" Jones said somberly. Sir John looked up at Big Ben, towering in the distance, stone-solid, tangible, real. But Shakespeare's words came back to him: these our actors As I foretold you, were all spirits, and Are melted into air, into thin air: And, like the baseless fabric of this vision The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inhabit, shall dissolve The Loch Ness monster and the Pan-Serbian Movement; bat-winged creatures that titter and the German secret police; incredible suicides and nameless perversions; worldwide assassinations and the secret history of Freemasonry; a mur- dered cat in a locked church and the Berlin-Baghdad rail- road . . .

Life itself was an Em- pedoclean paradox and David Hume was right: one cannot even prove, in logic, the existence of the ego itself. Truth! Truth! Truth! crieth the Lord of the Abyss of Hallucina- tions. \"You are aware, of course, Sir John,\" Jones went on, \"that the Bavarian Uluminati, financed by the kothschilds, secretly masterminded the revolutions which overthrew the old monarchist-feudal order and opened the way to the 'free' market system in which monopolized Capital has come to dominate the modern world. The Illuminati, need- less to say, had motives of their own: There is no God but Man' was their slogan before it was Crowley's. In fact, the Ordo Templi Orientis, in its modern form, was created by amalgamating Leopold Engels' revived Illuminati in 1888 with P. B. Randolph's Hermetic Brotherhood of Light. Randolph, an American Negro, had started as a voodoo priest but received his advanced training from the same dervish order behind Rasputin and the Young Turks. Theodore Reuss, the Outer Head of the Ordo Templi Orientis, we have reason to believe, was not just a spy on Marx and his group for the German military intelligence, but actually a double agent, spying on Germany for the Marxists. Crowley himself has certain links with Com- mander Marsden of our own Army Intelligence which I do not pretend to fathom. Isn't it strange to think all of this goes back ultimately to Mansur-el-Hallaj, the dervish who was stoned to death by the orthodox Moslems in the ninth century for saying T am the Truth and there is nothing within my turban but God'? Yet it was through Mansur's disciples that the Knights Templar were initiated into the secret black rites of Tantric sex-magick. . . .\" And Old Mother Hubbard really is Isis in disguise and the bone she is seeking is the phallus of Osiris, Sir John thought wildly. Everything imaginable is true in some sense: if I believe enough that I can fly, I will simply float off into the stratosphere. . . . \"Arthur!\" Verey cried, jolting Sir John out of these solipsistic reflections. Jones and Babcock looked in the direction of the clergy- xed stare. Across the street was a garden: Did a shadowy form move ambiguously therein, or was it just a lying in the breeze?"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ELLUMINATI 235 \"My God,\" Verey whispered, almost staggering. \"It's my dead brother, Arthur!\" \"It can't be — you are confused,\" Jones began to protest The clergyman brushed him aside rudely. \"Arthur,\" he repeated, \"the monster who brought ruin on my whole family. And now he comes back from the grave itself to taunt me.\" And he rushed across the street \"After him!\" Jones said urgently, starting to run. Sir John reached the opposite sidewalk first, as Verey dashed through the gate and entered the path between the high beds of exotic plants. The path turned abruptly and Verey was now running, about ten feet away, in a direction parallel to the street. He disappeared behind a large oak, as Sir John entered the garden and ran after him. Taking the same turn as Verey, Sir John found the clergyman no longer in sight He rushed to the next turn and confronted a tallish, black-bearded man in a Russian fur hat, busy trimming the hedges. \"Where is he?\" Sir John cried. \"Where is who?\" the bearded stranger asked in a thick Slavic accent. \"Reverend Verey — he just ran through this garden. . . .\" Jones arrived, panting. \"What happened?\" he asked. \"It looked as if Verey just disappeared.\" \"Verey?\" the Slav said. \"Nobody has come this way at all.\" Jones and Babcock exchanged mystified glances. Jones recovered first. \"Who are you, sir?\" he asked. \"I am Baron Nicholas Salmonovitch Zaharov,\" said the stranger, \"and this is my house behind us, and this is my garden, and I suspect both of you must have been drinking at an early hour if you imagine you saw someone come this way. I assure you nobody has passed me.\" Sir John remembered: . . . these our actors . . • . . . are melted into air, into thin air . . . \"At last,\" said Albert Einstein, his pipe venting cloud- grey smoke. \"Here is something we can really get our teeth into.\" James Joyce shifted into a different indifferent slouch in"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"236 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI his chair. \"We may find,\" he muttered, \"that we have bitten off more than we can chew.\" Einstein was rummaging about for a sheet of paper not covered with mathematical equations. \"Baron Zaharov,\" he muttered. \"The light at the end of the tunnel. Aha!\" He had found several sheafs of virgin foolscap. \"Here,\" he said to Babcock. \"I want an exact diagram of the scene of this miracle.\" \"I don't draw very well,\" Babcock said uneasily. \"We do not require an artist's rendering,\" Einstein said impatiently. \"Sketch the scene as an engineer or an archi- tect would, verstehen Sie? As a man would see it from above, if he were floating in the air.\" \"A schematic,\" Babcock said. \"I can do that.\" Einstein hovered over the drawing as it was made, asking questions, demanding details, until at last it emerged in full enough precision to satisfy him. \"So,\" said Einstein softly, studying the diagram, \"it is much as I suspected.

At first he insisted on treating us both as drunk or demented, and Jones had to exercise great diplomacy to persuade him to take us seriously. Finally, he did grow more cooperative, although he still acted as though he were humoring us. Nobody is quite as imperious as a Russian nobleman, you know. But he allowed us to go over the terrain most care- fully. The garden was in full flower on both sides of the path and could only be described as lush. There was no way Reverend Verey could have been pulled over the fence and dragged through the garden without crushing or badly mauling hundreds of plants, and yet none of the plants was disturbed at all.\" \"How high was the fence?\" Einstein asked intensely. \"Approximately three feet. The upper half of Verey's body was clearly visible to me until he vanished behind the oak tree.\" \"How high were the plants?\" Einstein persisted. \"Varying heights — from one foot up to three or four feet. And none of them was trampled or disturbed in any way,\" Babcock repeated. \"Of course,\" Einstein said. \"Now, carefully, Sir John, visualize the Reverend Verey and Baron Zaharov. What would you say were their respective heights?\" Sir John frowned thoughtfully. \"Verey was quite short,\" he said. \"Not much above five feet, I would say. The Baron was at least my own height, I'd estimate — around five-eight, give or take a few inches. He was so overbearing in his manner that I seem to remember looking up at him as he spoke, but I am not perfectly sure he was actually that tall.\" Einstein nodded. \"Rods and clocks,\" he muttered under his breath. He turned his attention back to Babcock. \"What happened after you and Jones were through inspecting the garden?\" \"The Baron showed us back to the street, with some patronizing remark about people who take strong spirits in"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"238 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI the morning. I was completely at sea by then, but Jones said, 'I don't trust that man. Let us see what we can learn about him next door.' \" \"J a?\" Einstein said delightedly. \"I know what you're thinking,\" Babcock said. \"As soon as Jones spoke it occurred to me, also. I had been so shocked by the seeming dematerialization, and so intimi- dated by the Baron's arrogant manner, that my mind had virtually ceased functioning for a while there. But, of course, if there were trickery involved, the Baron would have to be an accomplice.\" \"Go on,\" Einstein said, amusement flickering at a corner of his mouth. \"Well, the house next door turned out to belong to Miss Isadora Duncan, the celebrated American dancer. Have either of you ever seen her dance?\" Babcock asked, inter- rupting himself. \"I detest ballet,\" Joyce said. \"All that jumping about dis- tracts one from the music.\" \"I have never seen Miss Duncan, either,\" Einstein con- fessed. \"But, of course, everyone in Europe has heard of her. Is she as good as Pavlova, as some say?\" \"Better,\" Babcock said. \"I saw her dance only once, around 1909, but I have never forgotten it. Of course, I disapprove of the libertine principles the lady has so brazenly proclaimed, but I admit she is one of the great artistes of our time. I was very disappointed that she was not at home. We did, however, speak at length to her secre- tary, another American named Miss Sturgis.\" \"And what was Miss Sturgis able to tell you about Baron Zaharov?\" Einstein asked. \"A great deal,\" Babcock said with a weak smile, wearily. \"More than we wished to hear, in fact. She detested the man violently.\" \"Oh?\" Einstein was disconcerted. \"This is not what I was expecting.\" \"Miss Stin icribed the Baron as a prude, a religious fanatic, and busybody,\" Sir John went on. \"It teems thai be once tried to organize a kind of moral cru- sade in the neighborhood, to have Miss Duncan ejected as the equivalent ol a public prostitute, hailing in that, he continued to annoy the neighbors by sending them letters quoting the most controversial utterances in M Duncan iming she was a dangerous revolution-"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATl 239 ary. Miss Sturgis said that if it were not for his high posi- tion in the Russian Embassy, the neighbors might have organized a committee to have him thrown out.\" \"Any more?\" Einstein asked, abruptly brighteyed and cheerful again. \"Oh, a great deal,\" Babcock said. \"Zaharov attended ser- vices at an Eastern Orthodox church every morning, even though it was miles away and he had to arise at five a.m. to get there. He once tried to use his position at the em- bassy to bully a Russian-language bookstore to stop carry- ing the works of Count Tolstoy because Tolstoy had ques- tioned the doctrine of the Virgin Birth. His uncle was a Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, in Moscow. He was sus- picious of Roman Catholics and Jews, and regarded Prot- estants as little better than atheists. Miss Sturgis said, I remember, 'After having him as a neighbor, I understand why Russia is such a backward country.' \" Einstein laughed. \"Wunderbarr he said. \"Miss Sturgis' testimony fits perfectly with my theory.\" Joyce muttered, \"Then I am mad.\" Einstein smiled. \"How so?\" \"If the Baron were a man who got up at five in the morning to kill cats in churches,\" Joyce said, \"or if he admired and praised Miss Duncan's revolutionary princi- ples, then I might see him as a co-conspirator with our enigmatic Crowley. But as it is, he seems to be above sus- picion.\" Einstein nodded. \"But that is what I expected. When Babcock said Miss Sturgis regarded the Baron as detestable I feared that my hypothesis was falling apart. But as it is I am more sure than ever that I am on the right track. What happened next?\" he asked Babcock. \"After we left the Duncan household, Jones said that Verey's dematerialization had changed everything again, and that I must not accompany him to Crowley's home; he would go alone. I protested, and we argued somewhat heatedly. Eventually, I was persuaded to allow him to go alone. I checked in at the Diogenes Club, where I often stay when I am in London, and waited. . . .\" \"Yes?\" Einstein prompted, a professor examining a stu- dent. \"I waited until nightfall,\" Babcock said. \"And then I could stand the uncertainty no more. I took a hansom cab to Jones' home in Soho . . . and . . .\""},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"240 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI \"Let me tell you what you found,\" Einstein said. \"There was an ordinary English family living there, with open and honest faces, who swore solemnly they had never heard of a Mr. George Cecil Jones.\" \"My God!\" Babcock said, sitting up suddenly. 'This is incredible! How did you know?\" \"Am I correct?\" Einstein asked. \"Yes,\" Babcock said. \"Before Heaven, I cannot imagine how you guessed.\" \"Guessing has nothing to do with scientific thinking,\" Einstein said sharply. \"Did you perchance also try to con- tact the Liverpool Mangier, as your last contact with Jones?\" \"Yes,\" Babcock said. \"His room was totally empty. The landlady swore it hadn't been rented for months.\" \"And then what did you do?\" Einstein prodded. \"I returned to the Diogenes Club and sat awake all night, thinking and wondering. In the morning I went to the Lon- don Main Post Office, to see if I could get any information about the renters of Post Office Box 718. That was my last remaining link with the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. They told me there was no such box; the numbers only ran as high as 600. The Invisible College had become completely invisible again, it seems. As if the last four years were all a dream. An imaginary mongoose fighting imagi- nary snakes.\" Sir John lapsed into silence, staring into space with the expression of one who has been driven to doubt all that he had ever taken for granted. There was a strained silence. \"Beautiful,\" Joyce said finally. \"What?\" Einstein asked irritably. \"Did you say 'beauti- ful'?\" 44 I did,\" Joyce replied somberly, \"and I apologize, Sir John; that may be the most callous word I have ever spoken. But as an artist myself I was just carried away for a moment with admiration for the thoroughness, the ele- gance I might almost say, of your antagonists. They cer- tainly did a complete job on you.

It's an old, old tale — one of the oldest in the world — and I have often reflected on it myself. The charm of this story, I have found, is that if you tell it to somebody they will immediately claim to have heard it, or read it, somewhere before, but they can never recall where . . .\" 'The tale is this,\" Joyce went on. \"A man is in a strange city — or, in some more subtly unsettling versions, in a city that is very familiar to him, a city he thinks he knows. But he becomes lost and wanders into a neighborhood he has never seen before. It grows dark; he sees nobody to ask for directions. And then suddenly She is there — the most beautiful woman in the world. In some variations, She is carrying a pearl of great price, or some other fabulous jewel. In any event, She invites him into her home — as the Queen of the Faery invites the wandering Knight to cross her threshold in the medieval legends. He goes with Her, and all is bliss, and paradise, and the realization of all the dreams of Romance. Do either of you know the end of this immortal story, my friends?\" \"Yes,\" Einstein said softly. \"You are right about this yarn — I do feel that I've heard it before, or read it, and I can't remember where or when. He agrees to meet Her again the following day, at Her home. He returns at the appointed time; and there is no house there, only a vacant lot. Neighbors tell him there hasn't been a house there in over a century.\" Babcock stared. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I recall the tale now, myself. Only it seems that when I heard it, the whole neighborhood had vanished. The hero searches the city end- lessly, but never finds that street again.\" Joyce smiled gently. \"In some versions, he is an old man first seen wandering the city at night. After he tells his story, he goes on searching for the street that once was but is no more. Some people, I have found, even claim to know the man this adventure happened to.

Do you, sir, still think They are merely human and that They accom- plished all this by purely material means?\" Before Joyce could reply Einstein commented drily, \"We shall come to that question in a few moments. But first, Sir John, is your story finished? I suspect some sort of climax is still waiting. . . .\" Babcock rose and stretched. \"Yes,\" he said, beginning to pace, \"there was a climax of sorts. . . . \"After the visit to the post office and the discovery that there was no Box 718, I went back to the Diogenes Club, halt-convinced that I was mad. Before I could go to my room, the porter told me there was a gentleman waiting to see me in the smoking room. I must have walked in there like an automaton; I was in some strange mental state where it no longer mattered whether Jones or Verey had returned as miraculously as they had dematerialized, or if the Devil Himself were waiting for me. It was, God help me, Aleister Crowley. \"I could hardly speak; in fact, I could hardly feel any- thing — not even fear. 'What do you want?* I asked him. I was thinking of Scott's words about everything produced by witches' glamour being insubstantial as air. \"He spoke in a level, pleasant voice, without bravado or dramatics; anybody even a few feet away would think we were having a most ordinary conversation.

I have been moving on, city to city, ever since then.\" Joyce rose and stretched the kinks out of his body, cast- ing a grotesque spidery shadow on the wall behind him. \"Well, Professor,\" he asked, \"are we living in the twentieth century or the thirteenth?\" The Fohn whistled at the window. Einstein studied carefully the dottle of his extinguished pipe. Under their drooped lids his eyes searched what the cold smell of the ash spoke not. \"Well,\" he said finally, \"I do not regard this matter as hopelessly obscure. There is quite a bit of light amid the engulfing darkness, don't you think, Jeem?\" Joyce smiled wanly. \"I have picked up a few rays of light,\" he said carefully. \"But they are small and fugitive and my darkness is still much greater. Shall I list the points that appear most cogent to me?\" \"By all means,\" Einstein urged. \"There are four,\" Joyce said. \"I might title them as follows: 1. The Clue of the Quadrilateral Metaphor; 2. The Matter of the Tacked-on Tragedy; 3. The Matter of the Enumeration of Sonnets; 4. The Clue of the 26 Garters. \"Does that suggest anything to either of you?\" he con- cluded impassively. \"Not to me,\" Babcock said, baffled. \"Nor to me,\" Einstein added. \"But I wonder if you have found the parts of the answer that are still beyond my comprehension. . . .

Well, be that as it may, since you gave us your list first, could you explicate them for us before I get to my list?\" Joyce removed carefully his glasses, to polish them metic- ulously on a handkerchief. \"I am now about seventy-five percent blind,\" he said thoughtfully; finishing, he translated the glasses back to his nose. \"Presto!

This is the 2ue of the Quadrilateral Metaphor. \"So, I ask myself just how deep this singularly deep young man can really be. The tragic end of his saga is, to me, blatantly false and propagandists. The number of adulter- ers in Europe may not exceed the sands of the Sahara, or the atoms in the galaxy, but it is certainly vast; and they do not automatically succumb to advanced, incurable syphi- lis in every case. Nor do they, if the disease is diagnosed, immediately commit suicide. They seek treatment, and if they are lucky and the disease is caught soon enough, they are even routinely cured. I do not say the sad end of Ar- thur Angus Verey is impossible, merely improbable. It has a moralistic, preachy sound, very much as if it were the work of the Reverend Charles Verey. This is the Tacked- On Tragedy I mentioned. But let me ask: Does such dual authorship sound in accord with your notions of human psychology, gentlemen?\" Einstein spoke first. \"Go on,\" he said. \"You definitely seem to have the part of the puzzle that still eludes me.\" Babcock added, \"I will certainly grant that Verey would hardly have published that book without such a harsh moralistic lesson at the end. . . .\" Joyce rapped the floor with his walkingstick. \"Point one carries,\" he said. \"Well, then, the old legal adage tells us, 'Guilty in part, guilty in whole,' which may or may not be true, but gives me a pretty thought, nonetheless. If the Reverend Charles Verey wrote the ending, could he have written the whole? All day a phrase from Dante has been running through my head: ed eran duo in uno, ed uno in duo. 'They were two in one, and one in two.' It describes Bertran de Born, beheaded, in the Inferno.

My father used to tell me that was the most profound line in the play.

We each have our hidden side, which Jung so poetically calls the Shadow. What would the Shadow of the Reverend Charles Verey be? The opposite of his pub- lic persona of Presbyterian righteousness, of course. It would be, in fact, very much like the alleged Arthur Angus Verey — libertine, sensualist, adulterer, blasphemer against Christ and the Church. I suggest, in short, that Clouds Without Water was written entirely by Reverend Charles Verey.* To each Thou shalt not' of the public Reverend Charles Verey, the internal 'Arthur' cries, T will!' The Shadow, the Satanic 'Arthur' writes the lush voluptuous sonnets, lingering longingly on every lovely lewd licentious detail of a fantastic love affair with a gloriously wicked and totally desirable woman; the public Persona arranges that this book of wet dreams ends with 'Arthur' being destroyed for his sins and adds the running footnotes re-asserting tra- ditional morality. \"Well, gentlemen,\" Joyce asked, \"does Point Two carry? Are the two souls in Clouds Without Water dwellers in one breast?' ' Babcock shook his head dubiously. \"It is possible in psy- chology,\" he said. \"But it is contradicted by the facts as we know them.\" \"The facts as we know them,\" Einstein said mildly, \"have boon distorted by a deliberate conspiracy to keep us from knowing the facts as they really are. Go ahead, Jeem.\" \"W have, in Clouds Without Water, a book such as I myself try to write,\" Joyce said. \"A multi-dimensional, multi-level, multi-meaningful book.

And the readings of the instruments will depend on our velocity in relation- ship to the velocity of the thing being measured. Lorenz worked all this out mathematically but couldn't believe it. I decided in 1904 to believe it and see where it led me. It led to solving all the puzzles that have bedeviled physics since the Michelson-Morley experiment. It led, in fact, to the simple conclusion that there is no length as a ding an sich, an objective entity, but only lengthi as read by instru- menti, length2 as read by instrument2, and so on. The same applies to time, I have also demonstrated.\" \"But,\" said Babcock, \"this takes us outside sensory space and linear time entirely. It is Gnostic and Platonic.\" \"In a sense,\" Einstein granted. \"The difference is that Plato left off at the point where I begin. He never con- nected his geometric archetypes with empirical sense-data. I have made that scientific connection. My theory explains experiments that can be explained in no other way.\" \"Tell him about the rock and the train,\" Joyce suggested languidly from his shadow. \"Oh, that is a type of relativity that has been known since Galileo,\" Einstein said. \"I have merely provided a contem- porary illustration. Suppose you throw a rock from a train. In what path does it fall?\" Babcock looked uncertain. \"I'm not sure,\" he admitted. \"It seems to me it would fall in a straight line.\""},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"248 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATT \"Ah,\" said Einstein, \"so it would — from your viewpoint inside the train. But if somebody else were in a field beside the railroad tracks, how would he see it fall?\" Babcock was silent. \"Er,\" he said finally, \"I'm not sure about this, either, but I try to visualize it and I imagine he would see it fall in a curved path.\" \"In the curve called a parabola,\" Einstein corrected. \"He would see it fall in a perfect parabola. Now, which is true? The viewpoint of the man on the train, or that of the man in the field?\" \"I begin to catch your drift,\" Babcock said. \"Both are true, within the — what do you call it?— coordinate systems of the two observers.\" Joyce laughed. \"All of this is unfamiliar to you,\" he said to Babcock, \"and yet you are learning rapidly. Do you know why that is? I shall tell you. Because your Cabala is based on the very same principles, although applied in that case to psychology rather than to physics. You are just learning a new aspect of what you actually already know.\" Einstein raised an eyebrow. \"So I am a Cabalist?\" he asked, amused. \"What is Cabala?\" Joyce asked Somatically. \"Well, what- ever else it is, from my viewpoint as an artist it is a method of multiple vision. To take an example from Sir John's story, I.N.R.I., analyzed Cabal istically, no longer has simply a Christian meaning, but a Greek mythological meaning, an Egyptian meaning, an Alchemical meaning, a meaning within the symbolism of the Tarot cards, and so forth. These correspondences are not ///ogical but analogi- cal The Cabalist sees each symbol — Christ, Dionysus, Osi- ris, the Tarot cards and the rest — as meaningful in its own mythic context, just as Professor Einstein's theory sees each measurement as true within its own coordinate system. And the Cabalist seeks, behind these diverse and contradictory symbols, the archetypal meaning which is in human psy- chology itself, as Dr. Jung has recently reminded us. Just as Professor Einstein looks beyond the diverse and con- tradictory instrument readings for the abstract mathematical relationships that translate one coordinate system into an- other.\" Multiple vision,\" Babcock repeated. \"Yes. That does summarize Cabalism nicely.\" \"Well, then,\" Joyce said, \"what is Clouds Without Water? Is it not a perfect example of Cabalistic thinking, a book"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 249 which can, in fact, be read at least four ways, and possibly more, if we were to look at it more closely? Is it not a model of Cabalistic multiple meaning? And I note also that you told us it has exactly 114 sonnets. This is the Matter of the Enumeration of Sonnets. Now, I am no hermeticist myself, but I did spend some time in my youth listening to John Eglinton and George Russell and the other Dublin mystics, and even I know that 1 14 is an important Cabalistic number, is it not?\" \"Yes,\" Babcock said. \"The tradition is that the Invisible College acts publicly for 114 years, then dissolves itself and remains passive for 114 years, then acts openly again for 114 years, and so on.\" \"There is more to it than that,\" Joyce said. \"There is al- ways more in Cabala. Eglinton or Russell — I forget which — once explained to me, as an example of the historical connection between Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism, that the mysterious letters on Masonic buildings and documents, L.P.D., also equal 114 Cabalistically. Does my memory trick me?\" \"No,\" Babcock said. \"Lamed is 30, Pe is 80, and Daleth is 4. Total: 114. The meaning is supposed to be Light, Pressure, Density and refers to the inner transformation of the Alchemical process.\" \"It refers also to other things,\" Joyce said. \"The Grand Orient lodges before the French Revolution, from which Mr. Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis claims descent, ex- plained L.P.D. as Lilia perdita destrue — 'trample the lily underfoot,' the lily being the symbol of the Bourbons, the royal family of France against which this faction of Ma- sonry has allegedly been waging war since the destruction of the Templars by Philip II. Once again, you see, the Cabalistic symbols mean different things on different levels of interpretation.\" Einstein re-lit his pipe. \"So,\" he said between puffs, \"you have taken us a long way round, Jeem, but your conclu- sion is precisely what?\" \"Clouds Without Water is the work of a very advanced Cabalist,\" Joyce said. \"And the Reverend Verey was never as ignorant of Cabala as he claimed. Proof: he knew that the 26 garters pendant on the Order of the Garter had a Cabalistic meaning and he prodded you, Sir John, until you remembered that 26 is the value of Yod He Vau"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"250 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI He, the Holy Unspeakable Name of God. The Clue of the 26 Garters, Dr. Watson might call it.\" Joyce paused and then went on. \"I don't know how Verey murdered off his family, and I certainly don't know why [but who can understand the workings of religious mania?], but I am morally certain that he did. The whole story of the book of horrors that drives people mad is entirely his invention, remember, and I have already indicated my rea- sons for thinking he purloined that idea from Robert W. Chambers' The King in Yellow. I call to mind another hunchback driven mad by religious fervor and sexual anxieties, Saint Paul, who once worte a sentence that de- scribes Verey perfectly: T do not do that which I would, but that which is hateful to me.' The split mirror again.\" Babcock's face revealed a conflict of emotions. \"You almost convince me. But your theory is only partial and still leaves very much unexplained. . . .\" The doorbell rang. All three men started slightly. \"It has been a heavy experience, this tale of yours,\" Einstein said. \"But Joyce has very nicely clarified the points on which I was myself still puzzled. With his contribution, I think I can now explain all of it, and banish the bogeys forever.\" Mileva Einstein appeared in the doorway, with a package in brown wrapping paper. \"Albert,\" she said, \"a boy just delivered this for you.\" The three men exchanged glances. Einstein arose like a cat. \"This is not totally unexpected,\" he said, crossing the room. Joyce and Babcock, sitting erect suddenly, watched tense- ly as Mileva left and Einstein carried the package to his desk. \"Is it . . .\" Babcock stammered. \"Oh, yes.\" Einstein was amused. \"The complete artistic finishing stroke. It has the return address of 'M.M.M., 93 Jennys Street, London, U.K.,' even though it bears no postmark and was obviously never in the mails.\" He began to tear the paper. or Gods sake!\" Babcock cried. \"Don't! You can't be absolutely sure of your theory, whatever it is. You may not be immune to the danger.\" \"Oh, I'm not worried tcin said, tearing and ripping until the book emerged. Then he began to laugh, a small"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 251 :hortle at first, and then louder and louder until his face 'as contorted and tears appeared in his eyes. The laughter of hysterical madness? No: Einstein finally \"egained control and held the book up so Joyce and Bab- ;ock could see it. \"Here it is, gentlemen,\" he said, \"the lorror of horrors. . . .\" The book he held was titled Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes. \"Mo . . . ther . . . go . . .\" Joyce said slowly. \"It fits to- gether the fragments we heard.\" \"And it's all magick secrets in code!\" Babcock cried. \"Crowley wasn't joking about that at all.\" \"Yes, he was,\" Einstein said. \"This is the punch line to the joke.\" He resumed his seat, wiping further tears of laughter from his owl-wide eyes with bunched knuckles helplessly. \"It's a Divine Comedy,\" Joyce gasped, also gurgling a laugh half -born far back in his throat. \"We'll all be hauled off to Dante's Infirmary with the whooping laugh.\" \"Am I to gather,\" Babcock asked, not amused, \"that I have been having my leg pulled all along?\" \"Yes and no,\" said Einstein. \"Another paradox!\" Babcock cried. \"Is there no un- equivocal yes or absolute no in any of this business?\" Joyce, still half -laughing, sang softly: A paradox, a paradox, A most ingenious paradox . . . \"For Christ's sake!\" Babcock said. \"Let me in on the jest, gentlemen.\" Einstein nodded. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"At this point I'm not at all sure I should explain to you; you might never forgive me. What do you think, Jeem?\" \"I think,\" Joyce said, \"that this script has been so bril- liantly constructed that it doesn't matter how much you explain. The doorbell will ring again, before you are very far along, and the Author will provide the climax he in- tended from the beginning.\" \"Yes,\" Einstein said, \"I suppose you are right. Well, then,\" he addressed Babcock, \"to at least begin an explana- tion. . .\" \"When the doorbell rings the second time,\" Joyce pro- nounced, \"we undoubtedly shall all turn to pumpkins.\""},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"252 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI \"Before that happens,\" Einstein said, \"I think I do owe Sir John the rest of the explanation of what is going on here.\" \"At last!\" Babcock said with some heat. \"Until the doorbell rings . . .\" Joyce intoned. Einstein concentrated for a moment. \"Let us begin with basics. In the context of modern thought, that means with David Hume. In his discussion of miracles, Hume points out what argument is both totally satisfactory, and also totally necessary, to demonstrate the reality of an alleged miracle. That argument is, briefly, to be able to demonstrate that any other explanation of the event would itself be more miraculous than the alleged miracle itself. This is Hume's equivalent of Occam's Razor. For instance, if I were to claim that my dear wife, Milly, is floating around the kitchen two feet above the floor, you would in reason be justified in believing me only if it were even more miracu- lous that 1, Albert Einstein, could tell a lie. Now, I treasure my reputation for integrity, but I do not think you would have any doubt in choosing which interpretation is more miraculous in that case — [a] that Milly really is flying around like a witch, or [bl that I am lying to you. No: there has never been a man of such supernatural honesty that it would strictly be more miraculous for him to he than for his wife to levitate. \"This is ordinary common sense, as is everything in Hume. We never believe an incredible story of strange things in the sky or strange beings on the ground when only one man claims to be the witness. We begin to wonder a bit if there are several witnesses, but even then we skepti- cally seek evidence that some conspiracy may exist be- tween them, or that drunkenness or some traumatic shock, such as explosion, might have caused them all to halluci- nate. \"Now, let us apply this Razor of Hume's to the Miracle of the Murdered Cat on the Altar. From whose testimony do we obtain this yarn? From that of Reverend Verey, and nobody else. Even the supporting detail about Mrs. Verey finding some of the evidence afterward is not her testi- mony [we have never met her] but part of Verey's own yarn. \"So,\" Einstein said, \"on the basis of the logic of David Hume and the ordinary common sense of humankind, let us ask: Is it more miraculous that mysterious diabolists can"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI 253 'alk through walls or that a most peculiar old man like r erey might be lying to us? The answer is obvious: it is less miraculous that Verey might lie. It is more miraculous that someone walked through solid walls. So, in reason, we must choose the less miraculous theory: Verey lied.\" 'This does not at all clarify the greater mystery of the suicides,\" Sir John said. \"There we are not relying on Verey's unsupported word. We have a newspaper story . . .\" His voice trailed off. \"Yes?\" Einstein said. \"We have a newspaper story, or so it appears. Where did the newspaper story come from?\" \"From the Inverness Express-Journal\" said Babcock. \"Not exactly,\" said Einstein. \"It came from the pocket of George Cecil Jones, who only told you it came from the Inverness Express-Journal. In this connection, I note also that Jones told you he sent his secretary out to buy 'a copy* of that newspaper. He did not say 'two copies,' and there is no reason, taking his story at face value, why he should have asked for two. And yet you pocketed the copy of the story he gave you, and Verey was reading another copy at breakfast the next morning. This is the Marvelous Multi- plication I mentioned. It does not make sense; so, again, somebody is lying to us. Now, we have several people here associated with publications of various sorts. Reverend Verey and the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth published Clouds Without Water, at least, and possibly other works even more curious. Jones and/ or his associates publish instruction manuals for Golden Dawn students. Crowley publishes his own books, we have been informed. Certainly, among these three most mysterious mystery- mongers it would be easy to produce what looked like a story cut from a newspaper?\" \"My God,\" Babcock said. \"But I actually heard Verey talking to Inspector Mcintosh of the Inverness police about the suicides. ... I mean . . .\" \"Yes,\" Einstein said, \"you see it already, do you not? You heard Verey talking to somebody at some Inverness number, and you assumed that he had actually called an Inspector at the Inverness police. Again, is it more mi- raculous to believe in these incredible suicides, brought on\" — he smiled whimsically — \"by Mother Goose — as we are now supposed to believe — or is it more miraculous to as- sume that Verey and a confederate in Inverness performed"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"254 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI a charade with the telephone? Again, I think, the answer is obvious: the latter is less miraculous.\" \"It all sounds so plausible,\" Babcock said. \"Yet I find it hard to believe that Jones and Verey and Crowley were conspiring together all through this. . . \" \"I also found that hard at first,\" Einstein said, \"until you described your telephone conversation with Jones the morn- ing you met Verey. Jones said, and the words struck me intensely, 'Be careful, Sir John; remember that a man with Verey* s hunched back is a rather conspicuous figure.' Now, I asked myself: How on earth did he know that Verey was a hunchback? He had allegedly never met the man. Well, I said, maybe Sir John told him and neglected to mention that while recounting the conversation to us. Then I re- membered, Sir John, that you said Verey was at your side all through that telephone call. You are much too well mannered to say, 'Oh, by the way, he's a hunchback,' while the hunchback stands beside you. So, then, how the devil did Jones know? This is the Casual Telepathy, if we be- lieve it. I do not believe it. \"The obvious alternative is that Jones and Verey were working together all along. Verey tells you, first by mail and then in person, a series of frightening tales well cal- culated to fill you with dread, and Jones produces the al- leged Newspaper' clipping that seemingly confirms these yarns.\" Einstein paused to re-light his pipe. \"To proceed,\" he said, \"if Jones and Verey are co-conspirators, we begin to clear away some of the other dark mysteries in this most mysterious business. For instance, I believe that coinci- dences can multiply at an astonishing rate — especially in the perceptual coordinate system of a man trained to look \\ for them, regarding them as occult signals or omens. But your tale, Sir John, has altogether too many coincidences | for any sane universe. 1 refer in particular to the insistent and terrifying way that details from your dreams and astral visions — the latter of which you must permit me to con- sider a species of half-waking dreams — come to life in the real world as your involvement with Verey and his prob- lems increases. So I ask myself: How could these Super- abundant Coincidences have been accomplished? \" There is only one answer,\" Einstein said. \"One man had access to your 'Magick Diary.' One man looked at it every month, as you have told us, to guide you in your spiritual"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATT 255 progress. One man, George Cecil Jones, could have col- laborated with Verey in creating the impression that these dream-terrors were manifesting in the physical universe. George Cecil Jones, who somehow knew Verey was a hunchback when he allegedly had never met him.\" \"My God,\" Babcock said again. \"Let us return to the newspaper clipping,\" Einstein con- tinued. \"I think that without that clipping, you would even- tually have begun to notice that you had only Verey's word for this whole story, patently borrowed from the Gothic horror school of fiction in general and Arthur Machen and Robert W. Chambers in particular. The newspaper clipping, then, was planned all along, like the conversation with In- spector Mcintosh, 1 to prevent such suspicions from enter- ing your head.\" \"But,\" Babcock said, \"as reasonable as all this sounds, I still find it hard to believe that a Christian clergyman like Verey — even if he had the multiple split personality sug- gested by Mr. Joyce — could collaborate with so vile a creature as Crowley.\" Einstein grinned. \"Let us look into that a bit. Joyce has suggested that 'Arthur Angus Verey' never existed, that Charles Verey wrote the whole of Clouds Without Water. Let us turn that around, and try the alternative. Suppose *Charles Verey' never existed and the whole book was writ- ten by 'Arthur Angus Verey.' \" \"But I met Charles Verey!\" Babcock exclaimed. \"No,\" Einstein said. \"To be parsimonious in our con- ceptualizing, you met and received letters from a man who alleged he was named Charles Verey. A man with a hunch- back, which is so striking a feature that it generally cap- tures the attention entirely. Very few people, I believe, could describe a hunchback accurately: they would re- member the hunch so centrally that the other features would be vague, quickly forgotten. One other fact about •Verey' did stick with you, however, and you mentioned it several times. I refer to his paleness. I was particularly struck when you stated that, at first glance, he seemed as pale as an actor made up for a death scene. This is the Over-Defined Image, and it suggests theatrics. I started to think: why, with a hunchback and some makeup, I could come into this room and ask for Professor Einstein and the two of you would tell me that Professor Einstein was out.\" \"The Cabalistic style!\" Joyce cried. \"My God, why didn't"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"256 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI I see it sooner! Of course! The style is the same. The real author of Clouds Without Water — both the 'Arthur Verey' poems and the 'Charles Verey' sermonettes tacked on — is Aleister Crowley.\" \"Aleister Crowley, the son of a very rich brewer,\" Ein- stein said, \"and therefore capable, like many rich English- men, of keeping a flat in London and a fine old home in Scotland, too. Perhaps in Inverness? I think investigation would quickly reveal that such was the case.\" \"And the phone number would be Inverness-418,\" Joyce said, \"the number 'Verey' called when he spoke to the al- leged 'Inspector Mcintosh.' In fact, it was Crowley dis- guised as the imaginary Verey, calling his own home and staging a scene to impress Sir John\" \"We can go further than that,\" Einstein said. \"Yesterday, we heard that the Laird of Boleskine was in Switzerland to climb mountains. We know that Crowley is a mountain- climber and now we have an Extra Mountain-Climber. Let us hypothesize that the two are Cabalistically One. And re- call that the 'devil' Sir John saw on Bahnhofstrasse last night appeared after the arrival of this Laird of Boleskine. The package delivered tonight also suggests that Crowley is in the neighborhood. I suggest, therefore, that Crowley not only has a home in Inverness, but somehow acquired, or bestowed upon himself, a title to go with the home, and is the Laird of Boleskine. And that the 'Reverend Charles Verey' and the 'Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth* are entirely his creations.\" \"Damn it all!\" Babcock cried. \"What an ass I have been!\" OU were deceived by masters at that art,\" Einstein said gently. \"The author of The Book of Lies is a genius in the trade of mystification.\" \"But one thing is still unclear,\" Joyce said. \"Why does Mr. George Cecil Jones fit into this?\" \"It has stared us in the face all along,\" Einstein said. \"Crowley has played perfectly fair — mostly, I suppose, be- e he is as much fascinated by lies that look like truth as by truth that looks like lies. At the very beginning, the Best Golden Dawn lesson warned Sir John that Crowley, among othei running a Golden Dawn order.

They have been initiating Sir John all along according to the oldest form of initiation known to anthropologists: the ordeal by terror. The Rite of Passage. It is just an enormous extension of the simpler drama staged by Crowley with his so-called 'psychoboulometer,' and it is even coded into the I.N.R.I. sequence Sir John was given for meditation at the beginning: the ritual of death and re- birth.\" \"And that horrible recording that 'Verey' made . . .\" Joyce prompted. \"I could make a recording just as impressive with the aid of a few professional actors,\" Einstein finished simply. There was a pause. \"We come now,\" Joyce prompted again, \"to the Miracle on Regent Street. Are we to believe that Baron Zaharov is also a co-conspirator, and that his Eastern Orthodox piety is another masquerade?\" \"Well,\" Einstein said, \"it is certainly peculiar for an anti- Semite whose government has been distributing the forged Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and who allegedly has an uncle high in the hierarchy of the Orthodox Church, to have as a middle name Salmonovitch. Jeem, tell Sir John the equivalent of that in English.\" \"Solomonson,\" Joyce said. \"My God, I missed that at first. It would mean that the Baron's father was a Jew.\" \"An improbability in that government and unbelievable in that church at this time,\" Einstein said. \"The Clue of the Impossible Name. Crowley has been fair with us again, bestowing the hint that allows us to see behind the mas- querade if we are intelligent enough.\" \"And the testimony of Miss Sturgis?\" Joyce asked. \"Miss Sturgis, as secretary to the notorious Isadora Dun- can,\" Einstein said, \"obviously travels in circles that would be called bohemian, avant-garde or revolutionary, yes? It is not hard to imagine some relationship, romantic or other- wise, between her and Crowley.\" \"Well,\" Babcock said, \"if Baron Zaharov is not a real Russian nobleman, who or what is he?\" \"Oh,\" said Einstein, \"I think it is fairly clear that he must be Aleister Crowley again, in another masquerade.\" \"But the height differences between Crowley, Verey and Zaharov,\" Joyce complained. \"How was all that managed?\" \"Crowley is a man of medium height, Sir John informs"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"258 MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATI us. With a fake hunchback and the crouch to accompany it, he could easily appear four or five inches shorter.\" Einstein stood up and walked a few steps hunched over in the man- ner of those with curvature of the spine. \"Observe: Do I not seem several inches shorter?\" \"That is totally convincing,\" Joyce said. \"The other is not so easy to comprehend, however. Anybody can scrunch over and look a bit shorter, but how does one look a bit taller?\" \"Remember that Sir John only saw Crowley, as Crowley, once,\" Einstein said. \"Recall, also, that Crowley was not present in that garden, as himself, to provide any com- parisons. Sir John saw a very short man go into the garden and then encountered there a man who seemed quite a bit taller than that. A man whose height he could not remem- ber exactly because, as he told us, the 'Baron's' manner was so overbearing he seemed perhaps taller than he was. We always remember very powerful, overwhelming, angry men as taller than they are — it is some sort of mammalian in- stinct which equates superior size with superiority in the herd. The large Russian fur hat, of course, also added to the 'Baron's' apparent size. Relativity of Dimensions. \"So, then, if 'Verey' and the 'Baron' were both Aleister Crowley, there was no need for the garden to be disturbed. No person, and no masquerade props, needed to travel horizontally through the garden at all. The transformation was almost certainly managed vertically. The accessories of the Zaharov personality — chiefly the black beard, the fur hat and an overcoat — were hanging down, behind the oak tree, on a strong elastic band such as spiritualist mediums and stage magicians often use. Crowley-as-Verey dashes into the garden, grabs those props, attaches the Verey props — suit with clerical collar and hunchback built in — and un- hooks the elastic band from the fence post to which it was umably fixed. It is immediately yanked upward with the y props to a perch I would imagine would be high above the ordinary line of vision. M l would also imagine,\" Einstein concluded, \"that the house was actually unrented at the time. The 'Baron 1 never existed aside from the brief charade in the garden and the tales Miss Sturgis recited.\" Babcod k his head wearily. \"There may be no mir- in this bill he said grimly, \"but there certainly I deviltry.\""},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"MASKS OF THE ILLUMINATE 259 \"Was there?\" Joyce said. \"I don't think you have seen to the bottom of it yet. The professor has neatly answered how and what and who and whichway and all the physical details, but the question of why is still unclear. I think I be- gin to perceive the why, the psychology of initiation by ter- ror, and I suspect that the last act of the drama is still to come. If Crowley with one hand manages the 'good' Cab- alists, through his lieutenant Jones, and Crowley with the other hand manages the 'bad' Cabalists, the lesson of the masquerade seems fairly obvious to me. After all, what did the 'bad' Cabalists do except damatize and bring into full consciousness the problems that were already indicated by your dreams, Sir John?\" \"Damn it!\" Babcock cried. \"Are you justifying them?\" \"I have trained myself not to judge but to understand,\" Joyce said. \"If you will listen to me for just a moment, about your sexual phobias, for instance. . . .\" \"I am already familiar with your libertine opinions,\" Sir John said stiffly, \"and I am sure they would be received with approbation by Crowley. But I know the difference between right and wrong, thank God.\" Joyce stared at the younger man in silence for a moment. \"You know the difference between right and wrong,\" he repeated finally. \"Man, why did you need Initiation — by the Golden Dawn, or by anybody else? You are a genius, a sage, a giant among men. You have solved the problem which philosophers have been debating since antiquity — the mystery about which no two nations or tribes have ever agreed, and no two men or women have ever agreed, and no intelligent person has ever agreed totally with himself from one day to the next. You know the difference between right and wrong. I am overawed. I swoon. I figuratively kiss your feet.\" \"Jeem,\" Einstein said softly, \"there is no need to be so sarcastic. Most young men are just as naive as Sir John.\" But Joyce had talked himself into boldness.

I am no mystic myself, but it is obvious that this Golden Dawn contraption is a very complicated way of teaching people to see as the scientist sees, or as my type of artist sees — without filtering everything through a lens of moral and emotional prejudices.\" \"There is a difference,\" Sir John said coolly, \"between prejudice and principles.\" \"Yes,\" Joyce replied. \"Other people have prejudices; but I have principles. Just as other people are stubborn but I am firm, other people are egotists but I merely have self- respect, other people are drunks but I only like a drop now and then.

My God,\" he added. Joyce turned from the window, his eyes huge and amused behind the thick glasses. \"I think we all saw God and died,\" he said. \"Each in our own way.\" \"When did Crowley leave?\" Einstein asked. 'Toward dawn,\" Babcock said. \"You two had already started to doze. I had a few words with him, I remember, while you were both already snoring.\" \"Oh?\" Joyce asked. \"And what was the essence of that conversation, if you care to say?\" Babcock arose and smiled at the golden sunlight. \"I told him about a doctor I met on the train two nights ago— the doctor you mentioned yourself a few times, named Jung. I said I would like to spend some time here, with Jung, be- fore returning to London and the next stage of my Initia- tion.\" \"You intend to continue your Initiation?\" Joyce asked. \"When I am ready,\" Babcock said. \"When Dr. Jung thinks I am ready — that is.\" Einstein whistled, or sighed, a long astonished breath. \" Tor He is like a refiner's fire,' \" he quoted. Joyce turned. \"And what did you get out of last night's entertainment?\" he asked Einstein. \"It all came together,\" Einstein replied simply. \"I could see all of it, every piece, and how each related to the others. My papers on relativity are just the beginning. There is a unified field that I have to work on, as soon as I finish this paper on relativity of acceleration.\" He grinned with pixie glee. \"It may take me twenty years, or longer, but it will be worth it.

How about yourself?\" \"No hard feelings,\" Joyce replied, \"but if I ever see Crowley coming again, I'll head in the other direction. One night in the caves of Eleusis is enough for a lifetime, as the Greeks knew.\" Einstein was pacing again, but more slowly. \"It was as if our brains were washed out with soap,\" he said. \"As if — mein Gott — we were born again.\" \"Yes,\" Joyce said, \"born again. That expression comes from the Eleusinian rituals I just mentioned. Digenes, the twice-born, were those who had gone through the whole night, in the cave of Demeter, being initiated. No historian claims to know what went on in there, but I think we can all make a good guess, can we not?\" \"Those chants Crowley used,\" Einstein said. \"Could they possibly be the same after twenty-five hundred years?\" \"Not the same,\" Joyce said. \"It was very bastard Greek, with Egyptian and Latin fragments here and there.

I suspect that such chemicals are the universal solvents of alchemy. They dissolve the reflex arcs in the brain, so that our old ideas and old selves drown in an ocean of new signals.\" \"Something like that,\" Einstein said. \"Well, do you really think that impossible novel of yours is finally possible?\" \"It is inevitable,\" Joyce said flatly. \"I have at last found the structural groundplan that goes underneath everything else. Under the Odyssey, under Hamlet, under Moses in the wilderness, under the colors and arts and body organs and all the other allegorical structures. The simple basic human truth that will hold it all up.\" He laughed again. \"And the critics will take decades to dig it out, if they ever do.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Einstein asked. \"The real theme of my book, the theme I've been trying to define for months and years while this was growing slow- ly in the back of my head.\" Joyce smiled radiantly. \"So? What is it, for heaven's sake?\" \"The parable of the Good Samaritan,\" Joyce said. \"The simple human story that is so ordinary nobody can see it until they have their noses rubbed in it.\" \"The ordinary,\" Einstein said. \"Of course, to you, it would have to be the ordinary.\" \"Yes,\" Joyce said. \"Listen: we will always remember last night, because it was extraordinary.
