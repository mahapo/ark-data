This does not necessar- ily indicate increasing flight to fantasy, or confusing TV with reality: The same study found that only 29 percent believe in witchcraft, and a mere 10 percent believe Elvis Presley is still alive. 1 If three out of four of our citizens—a much greater majority than that won by any president of the U.S. in our lifetimes—sus- pect the government of felonious and nefarious activities, that means that quite ordinary people now believe what only embit- 1 Survey published by George magazine (November 1996), cited in Fortean Times , February 1997, p. 21."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"tered left-wing radicals believed a century ago, in the 1890s (and only professional cynics like H.L. Mencken believed as late as the 1920s). Now, not just the far left and the cynics see all manner of double-dealing in Washington: The far-right wing has even more dire suspicions than all the galoots ahoof in the Republic added together. Nobody in the U.S. today has the sort of blind faith in our rulers that they taught us in grade school, and the above- mentioned three out of four of us hardly trust them at all. But the government does not have any monopoly on the low end of the confidence curve. We live in an age in which humans distrust other humans more than ever before. One can hardly think of any subset of the species, Homo Sap, that has not become an object of uneasy suspicion by some other subset. The profes- sions all belong to the criminal classes, according to popular opinion: TV repairpersons cheat us regularly, and so do auto mechanics. Doctors, merchants, the clergy, and alleged “experts” of all sorts have a dark smog of similar suspicions floating almost visibly around them. We all know that “experts” can be hired to testify to any side of any case. (See Elmyr . ) Other groups also appear fungible and nefarious to many. Even Academia has its own brands of conspiracy theory, or something much like it. The two leading schools of art/culture criticism, known as Deconstructionism and Post-Modernism, amount to seeking, and usually finding, ulterior motives in any- body’s “model” or “narrative” about the human situation, whether that “narrative” appears as a play by a genius such as Shakespeare or just a TV sitcom; or as a novel, a film, a document- ary film, a sculpture, a grand opera, a painting; or as an alleged “finding” of social science, or even an ordained law in the hard sciences; or as a political or religious faith.

The Post-Modernists often seem to refuse to communicate at all. (I say that without malice, because I myself have been called a Post-Modernist.) Maybe dogs are the only people around who still trust human beings, and I have even noted that some dogs seem dubious about us lately. Strange Narratives When I first developed a taste for books (around age 8 or 9, I guess) one of the first I read had the daunting title Believe It or Not ! and contained hundreds of almost unbelievable but allegedly factual yarns about strange doings on this planet. The author, a popular cartoonist of the time named Robert Ripley, began with a section on oddities of human religion, under the classical- looking headline, “Strange is man when he seeks after his gods.” Even at this age, I do not know if Mr. Ripley invented that aphor- ism or found it in some real classic; but it lingered in my memory for more than half a century. Men (and women) indeed become strange when seeking gods. As the present work will show, however, they become even stranger when seeking devils. And the narratives they invent have all the sinister charm and eerie cornball poetry of Bela Lugosi at his best moments. It almost seems that the human mind works like a giant magnifying glass: If you turn it to Positive Thoughts, it will enlarge them and multiply positivity endlessly, as it does for Christian Scientists and disciples of Rev. Norman Vincent Peale; but if you turn it upon Evil, it will soon show you everything you most fear lurking with slavering jaws and green tentacles right outside your front door.

Neither the government nor medicine nor commerce has a monopoly on popular anxiety. Most right-wing Catholics fear the Freemasons, and most Free- masons have worrying anxieties about the Vatican and all its minions. Many Euro-American citizens have taken to the hills (in Idaho and elsewhere) believing that our Afro-American citizens are determined to exterminate the white race (either in revenge for slavery, or because some other, more fiendish conspiracy has deliberately misled them). Probably a much higher percentage of Afro-American citizens believes that the Euro-American ruling class intends to exterminate them ; see Tuskegee Syphilis Study and its links to other entries in the main text of this volume. Black helicopters hover above our rural areas, and only pot- heads think the helicopters are part of the Drug Enforcement Administration, seeking taboo herbs (so that the multibillion- dollar pharmaceutical industry can go on gouging us with less reliable medicines at higher prices, according to the most popular theory); others have darker fears. Some believe the helicopters work hand-in-glove with a Satanic consortium of cattle mutilators, child abusers, demented preschool teachers, and punk rockers; and many citizens believe these sinister aircraft serve an alleged UN/New World Order conspiracy, which intends to invade us any day now. And, of course, nobody trusts the advertisements. Not even people who write them...

(Both Freud and Yeats, a great psy- chologist and a great poet, became increasingly uneasy about human beings after the horrors of World War I, which now seem meager compared to more recent atrocities.) Finding the Guilty Parties In this “Demonic Dictionary” we deal only with theories that proclaim that some persons or groups, whom the theorist can specify, often with front names, hind names, and addresses, de- serve all the blame for the horrors that afflict the rest of us—from ecological imbalance to economic hardship, from war to poverty, from drug cartels to the fact you can’t even get a plumber on weekends anymore. Those who want to blame all of us equally do not have a Conspiracy Theory but an Original Sin Theory. The malign subsets of humanity in Conspiracy Theory almost always appear as fungible or homogeneous. When a conspiracy theory posits that the members of the Conspiracy do not share equally in the conscious evil of their leaders, that theory has be- come somewhat more sophisticated and a good deal more realistic than most such “scapegoat” theories. For instance, in Canto 52, Ezra Pound writes: sin drawing vengeance, poor yitts paying for ——— paying for a few big jews vendetta on goyim 2 (The—represents “Rothschild,” a name removed by Pound’s publisher on advice of counsel.

Robert Anton Wilson / 5"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Whatever one thinks of Pound’s use of vernacular, his words represent one of the rare non-fungible conspiracy theories. A few big (i.e., rich) Jews deserve all the blame, he says, and the poor Jews pay for it unjustly. Such theories, containing a smidgen of rationality, do not usually last very long in conspiriological circles, or even in the minds of individual conspiracy hunters. A few years after writing those lines, Pound began raving and ranting on Rome radio about “the Jews” as a homogeneous group respons- ible for all bad economics. A similar dynamic appears in the evolution of almost all conspiracy theorists (except me and my friends, and, of course, the readers of this book). The fungible groups dreaded by ardent conspiriologists cannot, of course, exist in reality, because all groups consist of individuals, each of whom differs in some respects from all others. (No two brains are totally alike, just as no two fingerprints are.) Nonethe- less, most existing conspiracy theories tend to move toward the hypothesis of the fungibility of the devil-group, and this seems to result from both the “paranoid” (or “Mr. District Attorney”) style of the conspiracy hunter’s mind and from the structure of our language, which makes it easy to talk about the Jews, the Catholics, the legal profession, the medical profession, the bankers, the Freemasons, the politicians, the males of our species, etc., as fungible and uniformly evil. As Nietzsche pointed out, after humanity got tired saying “this leaf” and “that leaf” and “the next leaf,” etc., we invented the grammatical/mystic category “the leaf,” of which all individual leaves become specific cases. But “the leaf” exists nowhere outside grammar and Platonic philosophy —and thus our language tends to promote neo-Platonism by populating the world with grammatical ab- stractions. Any conspiracy theory that moves toward fungibility evolves also toward Platonic Idealism . This “linguistic hypnosis” seems so widespread that Count Alfred 6 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Korzybski invented the science of general semantics as an attemp- ted cure for it. 3 In other words, because we can say “the Jews” or “the New World Order” or “the Patriarchy,” we can believe, or almost be- lieve, that these grammatical abstractions have the same kind of reality as basketballs, barking dogs, and baked beans. Individuals, with all their hair and fingernails and ideals and delusions and funky smells, disappear, as it were, and the world becomes haunted by collective nouns. (See Hawthorne Abendsen . ) Americans in particular seem to have a passion for theories that explain that everything bad results from the machinations of an evil group who have no more morals than SPECTRE in the James Bond novels. Perhaps, instead of dividing our citizens into those who believe in some such conspiracy theory and those who do not, we should divide ourselves into those who blame one of the better-known conspiracies—the CIA, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , the Freemasons —and those who have given their faith and allegiance to more recondite theories, placing the blame on secretive and clandestine groups most ordinary people have never even heard of, such as the Gnomes of Zurich , the Knights of Malta , or the Insiders . Those who deny all possibility of conspiracy anywhere must eventually decide, like Voltaire, that the extent of human stupidity is roughly equal to what mathematicians contemplate when they speak of The Infinite. Others, who cannot believe stupidity reaches such transcendent proportions, perforce believe in some kind of conspiracy, or conspiracies, at least part of the time. Stupidity, we mostly believe, cannot explain everything wrong with this planet.... 3 Students of Korzybski’s school of semantics learn to say leaf 1 , leaf 2 , etc., Jew 1 , Jew 2 , etc., instead of “the leaf” or “the Jew.” Most conspiracy theories could not survive this reform. Imagine an edition of MS. Magazine in which “the male” did not appear but only male 1 , male 2 , etc. Robert Anton Wilson / 7"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Indeed, those who think “conspiracy theories” never contain anything but paranoid fantasy should remember that our govern- ment itself and all advanced governments believe in conspiracies and have laws against them. Special branches of the police power have the job of investigating possible conspiracies in various areas—the SEC looks for bank swindles, the Red Squad of every police department looks for subversive ideas, district attorneys hunt for books so evil they are not protected by the First Amendment (which radicals like the late Justice Brennan believed was intended to protect all books), even the CIA (when it can spare the time from its profitable cocaine business) looks for ex- ternal conspiracies, etc. If we (or three out of four of us) don’t trust the people who govern us, they don’t trust us, either. And no other country lacks some criminal conspiracy laws or agencies charged with seeking them out and prosecuting them. This, for instance, explains how the Italian government in the 1980s discovered the P2 conspiracy , which had placed over 950 of its agents in top government positions. Similarly, the U.S. government has recently found evidence of a conspiracy of de- ception by the tobacco industry. Such facts should warn us again dismissing all conspiracy theories as the pastime of dingbats and cranks. None of the investigative agencies charged with bringing hard evidence into court, however, have ever found traces of any of the Really Big Conspiracies that most “conspiracy buffs” believe in. This, of course, only proves one thing to the true conspiriolo- gist: The major conspiracies really do have almost universal power, because the investigating agencies themselves “are part of the cover-up.” Against that kind of logic, the gods themselves contend in vain. But, of course, a truly powerful and truly intelligent conspiracy would never get “exposed” or even suspected, as Mel Gibson says in the popular film Conspiracy Theory . 8 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Thus nobody can totally refute any truly crazy conspiracy theory, because all such theories have a Strange Loop in their construction. Any evidence against them also functions as evid- ence to support them, if you want to look at it that way. Thus, like its cousin, theology, the pop demonology of conspiracy theory survives any and all criticisms. People do not believe theological or demonological models of the world for logical or scientific reasons, but for “artistic” or at least emotional reasons . These models or narratives provide harmonious, coherent, and starkly simple explanations of events that otherwise seem chaotic and beyond human com- prehension. That’s why I believe in so many of them myself. Cultic Twilight Conspiracy theories therefore flourish in times and places of anxiety and uncertainty; but they come to full flower in those times when the government also fears conspiracies, i.e., does not trust the people. We here enter a truly murky area, where many people are presently under surveillance precisely because they once thought and said that the government might spy on them. “If the government doesn’t trust the people, why doesn’t it dissolve them and elect a new people?” playwright Bert Brecht once asked. A government afraid of its people cannot “dissolve” them so easily, or replace them with a people seized and imported from somewhere else, so it simply spies on the people it has and probes into their privacy even more than usual. “Superstitions like bats fly most at twilight,” Sir Francis Bacon wrote. Similarly, after studying conspiracy theory for nearly 30 years, I think that I have found that batty conspiracy theories and modern folklore in general thrive best in an environment of un- certainty and anxiety. When people do not know what will hap- pen next, any wild yarn will travel very rapidly through the popula- Robert Anton Wilson / 9"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"tion; it appears humans need any narrative, even a nonsense narrative, rather than having no explanation at all about their predicament. And the essence of any good story is, as in conspir- acy theory, the plot . If the people do not trust the government, it does not trust them. If the government does not trust the people, they do not trust it. This merry-go-round is almost a perpetual motion ma- chine. (See “ Every Knee Shall Bow . ”) In a nation where even one’s urine is not private, where the Power Elite sends its snoopers to search into your very innards—your bladder, no less—what man or woman can feel any sense of freedom or security? Hence, the people grow more hostile and “paranoid” about the government, and the government, noting this, grows more nervous about “militias” or “cults” or “hippies” or “extremists” or some other anti-governmental minority that might live anywhere and might secretly plot anything . It therefore hires more eaves- droppers, installs more wiretaps, and spies on the people with greater vigor. This Strange Loop quickly becomes a Vicious Circle, since governmental paranoia about people and people’s paranoia about government each reinforce the other. (See The War on Some Drugs . ) This cycle continues until the system collapses, until the funding runs out, or until, due to Divine Intervention, sanity reappears. In the interlude, endless and labyrinthine conspiracy theory flourishes, among both the government and the governed, as each becomes more frightened of the other. (See James Jesus Angleton . ) The Cold War has left us a legacy of spying, snooping, and paranoia that no longer serves any rational function (if it ever did). This continues even after the Cold War has ended, because politics like Newtonian mechanics has a Law of Inertia whereby a political crusade in motion continues in motion in the same direction until some outside force interrupts it . No such outside force 10 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"has yet slowed our general drift toward a Kafka—Orwell world where the worst fantasies seem more and more plausible to more and more people. Another factor tending to multiply conspiracy theories beyond necessity lies in the fact that all intelligence agencies have two functions, viz.: 1. Collection of accurate information . 2. Planting and encouraging inaccurate information . An intelligence agency, in other words, needs to know “what the hell is really going on” for the same reason a bank or a grocer or you and I need that kind of factual input. Hence, the huge budgets for item 1 above. Intelligence agencies, however, also need to keep ahead of their competitors, the rival intelligence agencies of other and, hence, perfidious governments. They therefore engage in frenetic efforts of spreading misinformation, “disinformation” (a euphemism for the former), “cover stories,” “cover-ups,” etc. In order to de- ceive whoever currently functions as “the enemy,” these fantasies must have enough facts mixed into them, and enough general plausibility, that they will deceive many others not yet defined as “enemy.” Always, they must deceive persons of average intel- ligence and average education or they just don’t work. The best disinformation should also deceive persons of more-than-average wit and know-how, for a while at least. In brief, modern secret-police work functions much like poker. All players try to send false signals at least part of the time, and all players try to detect “the real truth” behind the false signals sent by the others. 4 In a world where nations relate to each other in 4 A detailed analysis of this Strange Loop appears in Theory of Games and Economic Beha- vior , by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, Princeton University Press, 1948.

As Henry Kissinger allegedly said, “Anybody in Wash- ington who isn’t paranoid must be crazy.” Indeed, any citizen in a world run like that who doesn’t have some “paranoid” suspi- cions must have suffered brain damage in childhood. When the government engages in extensive (well-publicized) snooping and spying on the public, this paranoia escalates rapidly. Where there exists a secret police agency of any sort, in any nation, the people soon learn to suspect those who suspect them. Con- cretely, many Americans fear that any part of government, or even any organization not admittedly part of the government, may function as a front for the CIA, the FBI, the BATF, the Nation- al Security Agency, or groups even more esoteric and manipulat- ive. Thus, the more omnipresent the government’s “control,” the more suspicious and uneasy the people become. And the more people indicate a lack of faith of such government, the more such government will need to spy on them, to feel absolutely sure they have not become alienated enough to hatch rebellion or set off more homemade bombs of the Oklahoma City variety. The gov- ernment will therefore increase its spying and snooping, and the people will become more “careful.” As a crude kind of survey, I have asked audiences in hundreds of lectures and seminars if any of them ever willingly tell the whole truth about anything to a government official. Nobody has ever held up their hand and claimed that degree of faith and tractability. No man or woman in the United States today wants the Feds to know too much about what he or she is really doing. Since the government long ago passed the point of “anything not forbidden is compulsory” and now also wishes to enforce “anything not compulsory is forbidden,” we all suspect that we are technical 12 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"criminals at least, although like Kafka’s hero we are never quite sure which statute or statutes we may have violated. We thus arrive at a situation that in the Army is called Optim- um Snafu. Those at the top are never told what might cause them to punish the informant, and those at the bottom keep their mouths shut about more and more of what they actually see, hear, smell, taste, or otherwise sense of the environment. In the long run, the top people in the pyramid are attempting to regulate things they know nothing about, based on reports that have been invented by liars and flatterers to prevent them from using their awful powers too destructively. But if most people always lie a little in dealing with the State, the State must have a very weird and inaccurate picture of who the people are and what they really think and want. Laws will therefore direct themselves to a fictitious citizenry, not to the people we really are. Thus, the laws increasingly make no sense to the folk who have to endure them, and more hostility to gov- ernment appears. All these cycles make up a set of Strange Loops and Vicious Circles from which there presently appears no exit. Unless, as suggested before, the funding runs out or Divine Intervention occurs, conspiracy theories will flourish, both among the increas- ingly anxiety-ridden citizenry and among the politicos and bur- eaucrats who try to command them. And every voice that tries, or pretends, to tell the truth in this schizoid situation immediately comes under suspicion as another possible Deceiver and Manip- ulator whose yarn has to be looked at as critically as any Post- Modernist would look at the Declaration of Independence or the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We are all Deconstructionists now, whether we ever heard the word before or not. Robert Anton Wilson / 13"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Age of Uncertainty In case anybody thinks the above picture exaggerated or merely satirical, let us point out that two recent surveys show that public confidence in the media, which allegedly “inform” us, has sunk to what must be an all-time low. A Wall Street Journal /NBC poll found that only 21 percent of the respondents rated the news media “very” or “mostly” honest. That means that nearly 80 percent of us don’t trust the media (TV, radio, print) quite as much as we used to. Similarly, a Gallup poll found that only 29 percent of us express “a great deal” of confidence in the newspa- pers specifically. About seven out of ten, then, have growing doubts and suspicions about the medium where we once looked to find the facts behind the incoherent sound bytes of radio and TV “news.” 5 But since most people need some narrative or model to explain the world, if they don’t trust the media, who can they trust? Nobody. Then how can they make decisions? More and more, they reactively assume reality is precisely the opposite of whatever they are being told by the Voice of Authority. Personally, I view all this from a unique vantage point. Circum- stances have combined to place me in a rather singular position in the conspiracy-literature spectrum. In 1969—71, I wrote Illu- minatus ! with the late Robert Shea. This book parodied popular conspiracy theories of the ’60s but in a deliberately off-kilter way: The perspective was “Post-Joycean,” in that the reader was not told what to believe by the Omniscient Narrator of traditional fiction, but rather was left to decide for himself/herself how much or how little to take seriously of the models of the world (or “tall tales”) offered by many wildly conflicting and sometimes wacko 5 Both studies were cited in the Christian Science Monitor , 16 April 1997. 14 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"narrators. (The theory of Joyce’s Uncertainty Principle is more recondite and labyrinthine than explained in this short note, but in general when I use the term I mean the kind of book, like Ulysses , that does not present itself as a Puzzle Solved but as a Puzzle to Be Worked On.) Illuminatus ! remains in print 23 years after it first appeared in 1975. It has been translated into several languages and performed as a stage play in Liverpool, London, Amsterdam, Cambridge University, Frankfurt, and Seattle, Washington. As a result, I never stop receiving mail or press clippings from people who hold a variety of weird opinions about me. Some think I believe that all the conspiracies in that wild and crazy book really exist and want to keep me informed about the latest swindles. Some think that I believe in none of them and write only as a satirist of uncon- ventional people (and therefore a sly defender of the Establish- ment), and they want to straighten me out. Many believe I am deliberately engaged in confusing (or, as spokespersons for Generation X say, “screwing with the heads of”) the more serious, or more solemn, conspiracy theorists; sev- eral have carried this to the point of identifying (to their own satisfaction) which conspiracy I really work for. Many think it’s the CIA, but Lyndon LaRouche thinks it’s the original Illuminati . The late Mae Brussel, more originally, claimed I worked for the Rockefellers. I cheerfully confessed to the last, adding that David Rockefeller personally comes around once a month to deliver the filthy lucre in gold bars, which I keep stacked in my basement. I thought that would improve my credit rating, but evidently nobody but Mae believed it. You see, I have never denied any of these charges, since flat denial wouldn’t convince anybody with a truly suspicious mind. You are free to believe any or all of them.

To my astonish- ment and delight, my collaborator/research associate, Miriam Joan Hill, found more conspiracy theories than I ever dreamed possible. If we didn’t stop and deliver this manuscript to the publisher, we could seemingly go on for years and produce a work with as many volumes as the Britannica .

Maybe I’ll get a contract to write a sequel. “Ah, time! cash! art! and patience!” as Melville wrote. A final word: I have found that nobody can dive very deeply into these infested waters without having at least occasional flashes of true paranoia—that is, not just entertaining the idea that some of the more plausible theories here may be true, but worrying about even the silliest of them. As an example, Mike Reynolds, a writer I knew back in the 1970s, after being hired to do an article about “cattle mutilations” for a slick men’s magazine, had his house ransacked and burglarized just before sending in his final draft. He came to me to discuss his fears, and I assure you he was a very sane and skeptical person.

A-Albionic began in 1985 with a common or garden-variety uniconspiracy theory, blaming everything on the British royal family—rather like Lyndon LaRouche , who may have served as their original inspiration. In 1989, however, A-Albionic revised their model of the world (yes, they actually use the scientific word “model” and show other signs of some technical education). The post—1989 A-Albionic scenario holds that, in their own words (capitals included), “The Overt and Covert Organs of the Vatican and the British Empire are Locked in Mortal Combat for Control of the World.” A-Albionic traces this Mortal Combat back to the reign of the first Queen Elizabeth, when Protestant-Catholic warfare raged all over Europe—the time when the English, typically, made their pioneer scientific rationalist, Sir Francis Bacon, a high government official, while the Vatican took their pioneer scientific rationalist, Giordano Bruno , and burned him at the stake. The British Crown and the Throne of Peter have continued to make war on each other ever since, in this model, and every other “interest group,” “trade union,” “association of manufacturers,” Mafia family, in- ternational bank or intelligence agency—everything that might qualify as a conspiracy in anybody’s mind—have all become puppets, unknowingly, in this megastruggle. Robert Anton Wilson / 19"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Thus, the Windsor Family Mega-Conspiracy manipulates a motley crew, which A-Albionic sums up as “Comsymp—Interna- tional Banker-Judeo—Masonic—Labour Party—British Intelli- gence—Socialist International—Social Democrat—Fabi- an—AFL—CIO—UAW—KGB”—the same unlikely bedfellows that appear in many anti- Illuminati theories. The Vatican, on the opposite side of the world power struggle, controls an assembly of “CIA—Fascist International—Georgetown Jesuits—McCarthy- ite—Buckleyite—Knights of Malta.” (See Knights of Malta and P2 .) Duoconspiracy theories, like uniconspiracy theories, often lead to logical conclusions that seem bizarre to outsiders. Thus, the late Carroll Quigley , professor of history at Georgetown Univer- sity, appears as a member of the Insiders in the John Birch Society theory, and these alleged Insiders, who sound a lot like the Illu- minati, all belong to the British Royal Family Jumbo Conspiracy in A-Albionic’s system. In fact, many right-wing theories become compatible if one identifies Insiders with Illuminati and both with international bankers (Jewish, Dutch, or whichever suspects you prefer).... Ergo, Quigley was an agent of the Windsor Gang. But Prof. Quiqley taught at Georgetown, which the Jesuits own, so this makes him actually a tool of the Vatican conspiracy accord- ing to A-Albionic. He had entered the Windsor—Insider—Inter- national Banker—Illuminati conspiracy, A-Albionic says, but only to expose it. Quigley’s book, Tragedy and Hope , usually cited by right-wingers as “inadvertently” revealing the Insider’s plot for world government, had nothing inadvertent about it at all. The Jesuits sent Quigley to spy out the enemy and publish their secrets, according to A-Albionic. This minor detail in the conspiratorial mosaic became a matter of passionate debate among conspiriologists during the 1992 presidential race, because Bill Clinton , in one speech, mentioned Prof. Quigley as a teacher who had vastly inspired him in his 20 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"youth.

After completing this work of gnostic architecture, Hiram was killed by three ruffians named Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum. The names alone suggest that the story is allegorical, and Albert Pike, in many respects the creator of modern Freemasonry, in- forms us they contain two names of God, Ju and Bel, repeated three times.

The goal of Freemasonry, in Pike’s account, is to combat these three wounds of the human spirit and recapture freedom of thought, word, and conscience.

A modern variation on Acton’s rule comes from Boston Univer- sity historian Carl Oglesby, who has written, “Conspiracy is the normal continuation of normal politics by normal means” and “Conspiratorial play is a universal of power politics, and where there is no limit to power, there is no limit to conspiracy.” All of these notions are implicit in a recent Clint Eastwood movie, which in its title refers directly to Acton: Absolute Power .

Alliances with Yog Sothoth or similar stellar entities, who have charming titles such as Cthulhu, Azathoth, Nyarlathotop, and He Who Is Not to Be Named, Alhazred alleges, produce wonderful results—“starry wisdom” in the words of one of his admirers; critics claim that these cosmic mind-melds usually culminate in madness, violent death, or even worse.

Apparently, he never did aban- don his beliefs that Tito was a Soviet mole and that the chief Soviet mole in the CIA has reached a rank at least as high as his own. As we hinted in the introduction, behavior that would rank as clinical paranoia in ordinary life becomes pragmatic caution in the world of “Intelligence.” The KGB would love to have an agent high in the CIA, Angleton knew; they were clever and tireless, he also knew; ergo, they would eventually have a mole in the Company, and maybe they had one already. He never stopped hunting that Russian mole, and he operated with even more secrecy than was normal in the CIA. A.J. Weberman believes that Angleton masterminded the assas- sination of John Kennedy, using an agent to implicate and frame Lee Harvey Oswald . Most of the evidence for this hypothesis will be found in the Weberman website cited below; but see also E. Howard Hunt, Marina Oswald, The Three Tramps , and links therefrom. If Angleton really did it, he probably believed Kennedy was the “top Soviet mole” he’d been hunting so many years. Angleton’s obsession with this ambiguous Russian “mole” code-named Sasha led him to shred documents totally, long be- fore that practice became common, fearing that the mole might ransack his office at night. Another CIA officer, Edward Petty, stated of Angleton, “He was strictly a lone wolf, a strange bird. The man was doing all sorts of things on his own that nobody ever told him to do.... What an Angleton operation was, nobody really knows.” Angleton helped form the P2 conspiracy in Rome, which used drug dealing to finance anti-communist and pro-fascist activities, sometimes using over 200 real and imaginary banks to launder the money.

The Catholic Encyclopedia accepts this as one possible view but adds that there is “no specific one person or thing indicated by the term,” i.e., the Antichrist may be a mass movement or a series of events. Sign Ministries gives a more literal or fundamentalist reading, telling us that the Antichrist will also be known as the man of lawlessness, Gog, the son of destruction, and the abomination of desolation. He will rule over “the final beast empire of Satan,” set up his throne in Jerusalem, and demand worship by the whole world. He will die at the battle of Armageddon, thirty days after the end of the seventieth week of his reign. (See “ Every Knee Shall Bow .” ) Historically, many persons have been identified as the Anti- christ by their critics, including Nero, Martin Luther, and Aleister Crowley (who had the initials for the job). In this present decade various writers have identified the Antichrist as Bill Gates (pres- ident of Microsoft), Mickey Mouse, computers as a social force, and even Barney the Dinosaur. In the film Who’s That Girl ?, Madonna is asked if she is the Antichrist but evades a direct an- swer. In Naming the Antichrist , Professor Robert Fuller argues that Americans have a greater obsession with identifying the Antichrist than any other people in history.

The rumors, legends, and “disclosures” about Area 51 are so wild and numerous that it has even earned a third name—Dreamland. Groom Lake/Area 51/Dreamland is a very secret U.S. military operation, so no horror story about it can absolutely be denied or refuted. The government is hiding something there: The only open questions are what are they hiding from us this time, and why are they hiding it? Your answers to those questions depend on many factors, chiefly (1) your own mix of credulity and suspi- ciousness and (2) which sources of “information” you regard as trustworthy. Here are a few undisputed facts (we think): Area 51 has been in operation for more than 40 years. It lies 120 miles northwest of Las Vegas in the remote desert/mountain lands of Nevada. It has the longest aircraft runway in the world. Ordinary citizens can never get closer than 25 miles from the base without being stopped and sent away. The rumors and legends began with pilot John Lear , who has asserted for some time that friends in the intelligence community have confided that the U.S. government made a treaty with the aliens ca. 1969—71, involving an exchange of their technology for government cooperation in what the aliens called “research,” which involved both mutilation of cattle and sexual/genetic molestation of humans.

The name “assassin” derives either from Hassan i Sabbah, the founder of this order, or from “hashish,” which the Ismaelis evidently used in those days (c. 1100 A.D. ) in combination with Sufi dancing. Anyone who has tried fast (very fast) dancing while stoned on strong cannabis will assure you that the altered state achieved can easily reach mystic ecstasy, unless the novice falls into a panic attack first. Hassan i Sabbah, according to other accounts, did not use hashish this way, but slipped it into the food of prospective re- cruits (usually teenage boys) for his defense forces. When thor- oughly intoxicated, these candidates would be taken to the Garden of Delights for sweet dalliance with the houris promised to the faithful when they arrive in Paradise. Those who came out of this trip convinced that Lord Hassan indeed had the keys to Heaven became assassins, in the modern sense, and the first sleeper agents in history.

Where other historians would attribute that social explosion to the sufferings of the poor, or the ambitions of the rising merchant class, or the alienation of the nobility (who mostly despised their king and called him “the fat boy” behind his back), or some combination of these forces aided by the new ideas of Reason and Democracy, the angry priest had a simpler theory: The re- volution had resulted from the machinations of a literally Diabolical Conspiracy. The notions of this extremely reactionary priest might seem a matter of only historical interest, except that his Jumbo Conspiracy Theory, as developed ca. 1797—1808, gradually grew to include so much that it has directly or indirectly influenced almost all the conspiracy buffs who have written since Barruel’s day. First of all, the Abbe blamed the Revolution on the Bavarian Illuminati , a secret society that had existed between 1776 and 1786, when the Bavarian government banned them; it did not take too much of a leap of speculation to consider that maybe the Illuminati had not disappeared when condemned in ’86. Maybe they had lingered, under other names, and had indeed played a role in the uprising of ’89. This thesis appeared around the same time in another book, “ Proofs of a Conspiracy , ” by an earnest Scotch academic (and former Mason) named John Robison, who claimed the Illuminati had infiltrated most Continental Masonic lodges and warned his Scotch, Irish, and English brethren not to let these conspirators infiltrate British lodges, too. But Barruel’s works went much further than Robison. Not only had the Illuminati wormed their way into control of Continental Freemasonry , he insisted, but they had also existed long before Robert Anton Wilson / 61"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"they surfaced under the name of Illuminati in Bavaria. In fact, they had existed for over a thousand years and had used the title Knights Templar when founded in the ninth century. The Inquis- ition had found the Templars guilty of devil worship and sodomy. (See Christians Awake AIDs Theory . ) Abbe Barruel did not regard the Inquisition with any “secular humanist” skepticism. The devil-worshiping Templars, he decided, had lingered as an un- derground Satanic cult from their alleged dissolution in 1308 until their resurfacing as the Illuminati in Bavaria in 1776. A thousand-year-old conspiracy really turns on the true Con- spiracy Buff; and pretty quickly, Abbe Augustin Barruel heard from men of similarly active imaginations with even more epic- like conspiracy sagas. He changed his own theory several times, to incorporate the ideas that suited his uniquely off-kilter sense of how the world turns. The Templars, for instance, became the allies of the Assassins , the Islamic group that used hashish in its rituals and taught some weird variety of Sufism that sounds like the “Pantheistic Multi-Ego Solipsism” later invented by Robert Heinlein for a science-fiction story. “Nothing is true, all is permit- ted,” an alleged Assassin slogan, gives you the flavor of their mystical nihilism. Eventually the Abbe encountered a mysterious Captain Si- monini who told him “the Jews” as a fungible group were behind everything; the jumbo conspiracy theory emphasized the interna- tional bankers, especially the Rothschilds . By 1808, more or less, Barruel had made a permanent contribution to the ideology of the Far Right by his unified Conspiracy Theory in which everything right-wingers don’t like results from the machinations of Satanic/ Sodomite Knights Templar, godless Freemasons, Ar- abian hashish fiends, and sinister Hebrew bankers.

Solomon points out that Beethoven’s first music teacher, and a major influence on the growing lad, was composer Christian Gotlob Neefe, who was a leader of the Order of the Illuminati. Beethoven wrote to Neefe on one occasion, “If I ever become a great man, you too will have a share in my success” (pp. 26—27). Beethoven’s first major work, the Emperor Joseph Cantata , 1790, was commissioned by the Illuminati themselves (p. 48); it celeb- rates Emperor Joseph von Hapsburg as a bringer of light and foe of superstition. (He closed the Catholic schools in Austria and replaced them with public schools.) Solomon finds that Illuminati influence on Beethoven continued at least as late as the Choral Fantasy (1808) and that most of his friends were Freemasons and/or Illuminati (pp. 206—7). These links are especially interesting in that Solomon is only interested in Beethoven’s involvement with “Enlightenment” ideas and seems to have no awareness that he has incriminated Ludwig with a secret society that still arouses fear and suspicion in many quarters. Another surprising view of Ludwig was penned by Feminist Susan McClary, who claims the Ninth Symphony, usually con- sidered a hymn to universal love, is actually a rape fantasy.

Partially, this results from the fact that the Triangle has no known boundaries, not being a scientific or political construct, and sensational writers have extended it to include as many strange vanishings as possible.

The area became famous, however, chiefly due to the mysteri- ous case of the Mary Celeste , a 103-foot brigantine that was found floating there in 1872, about 400 miles off its course, entirely abandoned. The lifeboat had been launched, but no trace of it or the crew was ever found, and no reason for them to flee to ship has been discovered. Several yarns about this, some published as fiction and some as fact, added even spookier details, including strange vortices dragging the crew to a underground world within the hollow Earth. (See Dr. Raymond Bernard and Richard Shaver .) The case that really made the Bermuda Triangle a permanent part of folklore was the disappearance in 1945 of Flight 19—five Navy bombers on a routine training mission, which disappeared entirely after sending back an incoherent message that repeated the letters FT and then faded away. The search for them continued for weeks, but no trace of planes, crew, or even debris was ever found. The official position of the U.S. Navy is that the mysteries of the Triangle result from three major factors: 1. This part of the Atlantic is one of the two places on Earth where a magnetic compass does not point to true north and can vary by as much as 20 degrees. Most of the disappearances involve small craft and amateur sailors, who could easily have been baffled by these compass wobbles and gone seriously Robert Anton Wilson / 67"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"astray.

The Bermuda Triangle lies in the most turbulent part of the Gulf Stream, where thunderstorms, waterspouts, and the weather in general can not only create disasters but also quickly drown all the evidence or cast it about like pebbles in a cyclone . 3. The topography of the area varies from extensive shoals to some of the deepest ocean trenches known to science. Strong currents, sudden storms, and many reefs combine to make accidents and sinkings highly probable . And those lights or that fire Columbus saw must have been part of a meteor shower.

Under the Dr. Bernard pen name, he wrote The Hollow Earth (1963), which is still the most widely read 68 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"book on that subject. Despite the hollow Earth idea and other offbeat notions discussed below, Siegmeister/Bernard/Adriana had a real Ph.D. from New York University (1932) and had earlier acquired a Master’s from Columbia. His earliest interests were theosophy and anthroposophy. An educated and seemingly sincere man (although occasionally guilty of financial mismanagement, to say the least of it) “Bern- ard” not only believed the Earth was hollow but also that it was inhabited by a race called Terras, who had survived the destruc- tion of Atlantis, stood 12 to 14 feet tall, and ate the strict diet of uncooked vegetables that Bernard believed in. They also came out of a hole somewhere in Brazil, flew around in UFOs, and oc- casionally picked up a human, jokingly passing themselves off as Martians or Venusians. This remarkable man also believed the prophecies of a Puerto Rican psychic who called herself Payita and predicted a nuclear war beginning in 1965 that would leave no living thing on the surface of the Earth by 2000. Those who ate the right diet, lived in the Utopian commune Bernard had founded in Ecuador, never used money, and abstained entirely from sex, however, would be rescued by the Terras and taken to Mars, just before the nuclear holocaust started. The only reason these ideas did not become universally accep- ted, of course, was that an academic conspiracy to maintain geo- logical and other orthodoxies either ignored or ridiculed Dr. Bernard. Payita, the witch-woman, also convinced Bernard that she had regular visits from the Great Mother, goddess of the ancients, and that the Great Mother had revealed the true history of the world to her. Basically, the Great Mother had parthenogenetically (without sex) given birth to all the races in the solar system, starting with perfect superwomen on Uranus who also repro- duced Robert Anton Wilson / 69"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"parthenogenetically, no males being needed. Accidentally, how- ever, one gave birth to a “defective female,” i.e., the first male. His name was Lucifer, and he has been making trouble ever since, by encouraging people to eat meat and use money. His offspring inhabited Saturn and were far, far from the perfection of their female ancestors. Eventually, even more degenerate offspring migrated to Earth and degenerated further, until now we (their most degenerate descendants) are sunk in habitual meat-eating and money-using. Worse yet, when we do eat vegetables, most of us cook them. The present author once met a woman who had loaned Bernard $2,000 for his Utopian colony and never got it back. She re- membered him as a sincere and intelligent truth-seeker. Another source, however, says Bernard, after moving to his Ecuadorian commune, became “filthy” and unsanitary, suggesting some kind of mental illness. Bernard also wrote a book called Menstruation: Its Causes and Cure , in which he argued that menstruation is caused by eating meat, tight clothes, and having sex too often. Any woman who ate nothing but uncooked vegetables, wore loose robes, and had sex only once a year at the spring solstice, he said, would never have the Curse again. When Bernard died in 1965 the predicted nuclear war was due to start. When it failed to happen, his disciples did not lose faith. Some, in fact, developed an even more intense belief and insisted that he wasn’t dead at all but living in Shamballah or Agharti, two fabulous cities mentioned in theosophical lore. More recently, he has been reported alive in the little town of Houston, Missouri. See also: Abel, AYA, MS.

All of these suspicions about the Bilderbergers come from people who usually don’t qualify as rich or male or even white themselves.

The Parkman witnesses describe a small wound in the skull, but the Bethesda witnesses describe a much larger wound. Three different coffins are described, or two plain caskets and one of higher quality bronze. The body seems to have arrived at a back door of Bethesda and the casket at the front. The whole brain somehow disappeared between the two hospitals, a fact that has not yet been explained. Many smaller contradictions support Lifton’s argument that government agents (the only ones with access to the body between the two hospitals) significantly altered the body to fit the thesis of one assassin shooting from behind and undermine the rival theory of at least one shooter in front, on the Grassy Knoll. The only alternative is to assume that at least one of the hospitals was staffed by people who all had extreme memory lapses. As Lifton points out, the wounds in the Bethesda corpse played a large role in the Warren Commission’s “lone nut” verdict, even though nearly 75 percent of the witnesses thought all or some of the shots came from the Grassy Knoll. Also, the testimony on this video, if one accepts it, rules out all conspiracy theories exclusively blaming pro-Castro Cubans, anti-Castro Cubans, the Mafia , oil millionaires, etc. If the body was indeed altered as these witnesses indicate, it was done by agents of the government itself.

There he met Hakim Bey or somebody imitating Hakim Bey. Writing in a style that combines the most outrageous elements of Ambrose Bierce , H.L. Mencken, Andre Breton, and Nietzsche, Bey is the source of dozens of weird, wonderful, and way-out ideas. Among his key concepts are ontological anarchy, poetic terrorism , the temporary autonomous zone, and the Millennium. Ontological anarchy combines elements of traditional anarchism (see Government as Criminal Conspiracy ) with Discordianism , mathematical chaos theory, surrealism, the Moorish Orthodox Science of Noble Drew Ali , and bits of several mystic traditions, especially the Sufi and Taoist. Basically, it consists of (a) the per- petual anarchist quest for maximum liberty of the individual and (b) a prose style of such post-modern density and Nietzschean fury that it continually “tricks” the reader into realizing just how very little liberty we ever experience, and how much bland tyranny we presently endure. Poetic terrorism started out as a graffiti campaign, but Bey now defines it as “a strange mixture of clandestine action and lying (which is what art is all about)” and compares street theater with guerrilla theater. “If you call what you’re doing a ‘street perform- ance,’ you’ve already created a split between artist and audi- ence.... But if you stage a hoax, make an incident, create a situ- ation, it might be possible to draw people in as participants and to maximize their freedom.” The temporary autonomous zone (abbreviated TAZ, and known almost everywhere in the counterculture) derives from the ideas that the Elite will never give us any real freedom (see The Con ) and the masses, or Pinks , are too hypnotized and robotized to demand it, so the best we can do is find temporary zones of freedom, keep them secret as long as possible, and then move elsewhere when the Authorities discover that somebody some- where 74 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"has been having a good time. Critics call this “a Club Med for hippies,” but it actually contains a more radical idea than any summary can convey. As a Zen master said when asked what the Tao is, “Walk on!” The Millennium as conceived by Bey is different from any previous ideas on that topic. The death of communism, first in the form of the fall of Soviet Union, then in its withering away as an idea intellectuals take seriously, means that the malcontents (anarchists, voodooists, and other people who think more or less like Bey) are the only opposition left to the current money-power Elite. Like it or not, the people of the fringe are in an apocalyptical struggle: either the Elite techniques of control will be perfected to the level where dissent can be abolished, or heretics will mutate to some level of consciousness where they can do holy and mira- culous works to resurrect the old dream of freedom for all. This will not happen by 2001, necessarily; Bey merely means that we live in a millennialist emergency.

It signifies “the perceiving of a situation or idea...in two self-consistent but habitually incompatible frames of reference,” a process which Koestler claims underlies the three most uniquely human of all our behaviors: the joke , the scientific theory , and the work of art . 80 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The present author suggests that bisociation also underlies that other very human narrative: the conspiracy theory. Frames of reference, which Koestler also calls matrices, are called glosses, grids, or reality-tunnels in various social sciences. A frame, matrice, reality-tunnel, etc. is a way of organizing exper- ience: a code in our nervous system that tells the brain where to store each new bit of information. When bisociation occurs, we have two frames colliding or melding. This can be almost sexual in the joy it yields; and it is often fertile. In humor, bisociation can be illustrated by Oscar Wilde’s “Are the commentators on Hamlet really mad or only pretending to be mad?” Here, Hamlet as a character (who might be mad) merges with Hamlet the play, and the possible madness of one or both gets transferred to the commentators. (Underlying this double double-association is the paradox that we can identify with Hamlet even while remembering that he is really Laurence Olivier and we are only watching a play—a type of bisociation, or madness, or mystic oneness, which is socially acceptable be- cause it is ritualized and localized in the theater. If you walked up to Lord Olivier on the street and treated him like Hamlet, that would be unacceptable madness.) You can see the same collision of frames in Mae West’s “Is that a pistol in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?” Or Groucho Marx’s “I once shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I’ll never know.” In scientific discovery, the same bisociation appears over and over. Newton looks at a falling apple, as many had before him, and suddenly bisociates it with the orbits of the planets: the classic theory of gravity is born. Nobody but a genius or a mad- man would try to relate a simple fruit falling from a simple tree to the movements of the heavens. Similarly, although it may be hard for us to remember, electric- Robert Anton Wilson / 81"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"ity and magnetism were two different subjects before James C. Maxwell, whose bisociation into electromagnetism is as basic to modern physics as Einstein’s bisociation of space and time into space-time. In art, bisociation is everywhere; my favorite example is Yeats’s “A terrible beauty is born.” Terror and beauty never stood so close before. And the image of the pain and the glory of childbirth takes on another level, a bisociation of bisociation, when one re- members that this line describes the failed Irish rebellion of 1916, which led directly to the war for independence (1918-1921), in which a nation was born. Or try Shakespeare’s “Blood, thou art blood: Let’s write ’good angel’ on the devil’s horn.” Or, to jump to another art, look at that Picasso sculpture which seems to be a bull’s head but is made up of parts of a bicycle. Of course, as Koestler points out, many bisociations just yield false theories or banal nonsense. This may be the major thrill in the life of the humorist, the scientist, and the artist: you never know if you’ve just produced Genius or Bathos. You walk a tightrope, always. Conspiracy theories have a strong element of bisociation, and one often does not know whether to classify them as (unintention- al) humor, true social science, or merely dark art. Consider for instance: The bisociation of three millionaires in the Waldorf Towers with the U.S. Communist Party (see John Birch Society . ) The bisociation of Queen Elizabeth II and a hippie crash pad in the Haight c. 1968 (see Lyndon LaRouche . ) The bisociation of George Bush ’s oil wells and the aliens hidden by the CIA (see William Cooper . ) Some form of bisociation appears in every conspiracy theory, we suggest, and that explains why so many will laugh at a partic- 82 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"ular theory which others will embrace as a revelation of naked truth seen clearly as last.

Those seeking audience needed a special operation, by a medical rock group called Doc- tors for “Bob,” to open the third nostril, but even after that the encounter with the semi-divine “Bob” left them with partial am- nesia, eye strain, “sunburn,” and morbid anxieties, often centered on the idea that men in black , disguised as Jehovah’s Witnesses, would try to get into their homes and brainwash them. “Bob” was shot dead in San Francisco in 1982 by a former dis- ciple named Puzzling Evidence, or by six other people, depending on which conspiracy theory you believe.

Kennedy assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald test-drove a car of his, zooming along the freeways at 70 miles per hour. This seems strange because Oswald never learned to drive. Even stranger: Bogard claimed Oswald bragged of “coming into a lot of money” soon and dropped some pro-Soviet propa- ganda into their casual conversation. While some might think Bogard had a lively imagination and a desire to get his name into history, at least as a footnote, conspiriologists point out that the assistant sales manager, Frank Pizzo, and two other salesmen in the shop, Eugene M. Wilson and Oran Brown, each partially corroborated Bogard’s story. This case, conspiriologists say, proves the existence of a “second Oswald” who planted incriminating evidence here and there against the real Oswald, something only possible if there was a conspiracy and frame-up. The matter became more obscure when Bogard’s body turned up in a cemetery. Official verdict: suicide.

Robinson’s Born in Blood argues that the Freemasons (and also, curiously, their most paranoid critics) are historically correct in claiming a direct descent of Masonry from the Knights Templar . Orthodox historians, who have always rejected this as a romantic fiction, simply overlooked a lot of evidence, Robinson says. Everybody admits that the suppression of the Templars by the Inquisition was never enforced in Scotland, but skeptical non- Masonic historians have never looked at the history of that country for evidence of the evolution from surviving Templars to Freemasons. Robinson looks and finds some fascinating data. The major evidence he provides consists of previously unex- plained tales of strange allies that assisted Scotch patriots at various times, old church and tomb inscriptions, re-examination of Masonic terms and legends, etc., all of which adds up to a persuasive (if not positive) case that the Templars of Scotland survived using new titles and eventually evolved into the Free- masons of the 18th century. Robinson also has some good argu- ments for Templar/Masonic influence behind the peasants’ rebel- lion of 1381 in England, which may explain why the Knights of Malta were special targets of violence in that uprising.

Our researcher, Miriam Joan Hill, found several different definitions of this term on the net, typified by the following sources: • http://www.crashsite.com/SofTV/MindControl/Brain-washing.html • http://www.az.com/~bipolar / In most cases, writers seem to use “brainwashing” to mean any form of teaching, indoctrination, training, etc. that imparts ideas that the writer does not like . This appears wildly subjective. A 90 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"more scientific and objective model has been offered by Dr. Timothy Leary and R.A.W., and we will summarize it briefly. A brainwashing process begins with isolation of the subject, severing all ties with those persons (family, friends, lovers, etc.) who might interfere with the brainwashing process. The subject is then made to feel helpless and isolated, but is fed regularly. This re-activates infantile programs (“instincts”), which cause the frightened, disoriented subject to imprint the person who feeds them as a mothering or nurturing object, just as the newborn imprints the mother or the nearest mother substitute. This shocking arrival in a new environment and dependence on a mother-creature activates all the bio-survival circuitry of the brain, or the “consciousness” of the human or any living creature. In the second stage, while still being isolated but fed regularly, the subject is humiliated, mocked, and made to feel “all wrong” about any ideas, habits, personal traits, etc., acquired before en- tering the brainwashing program. In the hierarchy of needs, right after food/nurture comes status—and the subject will soon try to behave in a manner more acceptable to the cult (or army boot camp, political prison, etc.) where this re-imprinting occurs. The same status programs cause the young child to imprint the roles, rules, and taboos of the tribe in which he or she is born. This ac- tivates the entire emotional-territorial circuitry of all human (and vertebrate) brains—the “ego” in ordinary language. Third, the subject is taught to parrot the words and ideas of the group into which they are being initiated. Simultaneously, words and ideas from the past (pre-brainwash) are mocked and suppressed. This follows as naturally as the schoolchild acquiring the se- mantic system and neurolinguistic reflexes of their culture, once they understand that food and status depend on cooperation. This activates/imprints the semantic-rational circuitry—the “mind” in ordinary language. Robert Anton Wilson / 91"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"All of these steps must be accompanied by reward for compli- ance and some form of punishment or loss of status for “backslid- ing.” The process is complete when the subject not only parrots the belief system of the captors but truly begins to believe it, as the child imprints the reality-tunnel of parents first and then of the school the parents chose. Most government brainwashers go no further than this. Some cults move on (after the bio-survival, status, and semantic pro- grams are re-imprinted) to re-imprint a new sex role and a whole new sex code, according to the whim of the cult leader.

A large part of his book attempts to show that the KGB has in- filtrated Masonry everywhere it could get a foothold, and that the Soviets therefore masterminded the P2 conspiracy in Italy.

(Calvi’s pockets were stuffed with bricks and his body was hung where the rising tide covered it. Bricks are associated with the origins of Masonry and being hanged where the rising tide will cover your dead body is a threat that remained part of the first-degree initiation until after this case, when the Masons formally removed it.)

Yates thinks Bruno may have had a role in the invention of either Rosicrucian- ism or Freemasonry or both. Bruno’s teachings combined the new science of his time with traditional Cabalistic mysticism. He believed in a universe of in- finite space with infinite inhabited planets, and in a kind of dual- istic pantheism, in which the divine is incarnate in every part but always in conflicting forms that both oppose and support each other.

This does not mean that he believes free speech and a free press do not exist; he merely argues that the spectrum of viewpoints presented to the public is increas- ingly narrow and many criticisms are marginalized to the extent that only those devoted to research can ever find them. (He has been marginalized in precisely that way for most of his career and to a large extent he still is.) The major media are owned by a few billionaires, and those who occupy managerial positions also belong to lower rungs of the same privileged elite. Statistically, the same perceptions, viewpoints, and attitudes become more and more dominant. Those with deviant perspectives are “weeded out.” The public thus gets to see a small part of the actual political spectrum—from far right to middle of the road—and virtually never learns of al- ternatives, a process Chomsky calls the “manufacture of consent,” a phrase borrowed ironically from conservative intellectual Walter Lippman, who in 1921 said, in effect, that tyrannies control people by force but democracies “manufacture” the “consent” of the governed. Chomsky regards all forms of manufactured con- sent as Orwellian mind control. Thus, in his criticisms of the Vietnam war, Chomsky emphas- izes that the major media offered a choice he calls “Tweedledee and Tweedledum,” i.e., the so-called hawks and the so-called doves. He put it in these words: Both sides, the doves and the hawks, agreed on something: We have a right to carry out aggression against South Vietnam. In fact, they didn’t even admit that aggression was taking place. They called the war the “defense” of South Vietnam, using “defense” for “aggression” in the standard Orwellian manner.

Chomsky continues to apply this type of analysis to the official propaganda line of all recent U.S. foreign policy.

B é ranger Sauni è re, the parish priest of Rennes-le-Chateau in southern France near the end of the last century, who built the church (and also built many other religious structures in the Rennes-le-Chateau area), had been so poor in 1885 that he relied on the generosity of parishioners to survive. Suddenly, within a few years, he became inexplicably rich and began the career of church-building that lasted until his death in 1917. He left the secret of where he got his wealth to his housekeeper, Marie Dernaud, who died of a stroke before revealing it to anyone else. This small town mystery has attracted vast attention in Europe, and the various theories about it have even crossed the Atlantic in several popular books. Some claim that Father Sauni è re had found the lost treasure of the Knights Templar ; others that he found even longer-buried Visigoth gold. A third theory claims he performed some service for, or simply blackmailed, the royal von Hapsburgs; and a fourth says he was blackmailing the Vatican itself. Another speculation claims Sauni è re had rediscovered the secret of alchemy.

Dr. Paul Fleiss, generally best known as the father of the famous “Beverly Hills Madam” Heidi Fleiss—and the pediatrician for Madonna and Child—is also a vehement foe of circumcision. In his paper, The Function of the Foreskin , he argues that male circum- cision has no more health justification than female circumcision. The real purpose of the ritual, he says, is the same as in the female version: to destroy the most sensitive sexual parts and thereby decrease sexual desire. “Those of us who have been circumcised were mutilated.” He says the infant’s cry during this rite “is not like any other cry you hear from a baby” and calls it a “cry of severe pain.” The National Organization of Restoring Men (NORM), with 21 chapters in the United States, attributes its inspiration to hippie mothers of the 1960s who realized that circumcision was 112 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"“counterintuitive” and asked, “How could all males be born with a birth defect?” Doctors Opposing Circumcision (DOC), headquartered in Seattle, says its educational programs have cut the male circum- cision rate in this country from 90 percent when they began to 60 percent now.

This “conspiracy”—or this “affinity group,” if you wish less paranoia and more charity of thought—originally came to Paoli’s attention when, in the late 1960s, he found some copies of their internal newsletter, Circuit , in a chapter of the Grand Loge Alpina , the largest Freemasonic order in Switzerland. The journal Paoli found seemed concerned only with vine cul- tivation, genealogy, and astrology but had many odd kinks and hermetic references, evidently intelligible only to initiates. Paoli found it listed its publisher as the Committee to Protect the Rights and Privileges of Low-Cost Housing—although it seldom dis- cussed housing, low-cost or otherwise—but when he went to the address given, he found no such committee there. With helpful hints from a few uncharacteristically communic- ative GLA members, Paoli finally found the true address of the Priory of Sion , the actual publishers of Circuit . The address turned out to lie within the de Gaulle government in Paris, at the Com- mittee for Public Safety (once the engine of terrorism during the French Revolution, under the leadership of Robespierre, but now quite respectable). The managers of the committee appeared men of high culture and proven patriotism—Andr é Malraux, Nobel laureate in literature, influential art critic, and Resistance fighter during the Nazi occupation; and Pierre Plantard de Saint Clair , scholar, occultist, and another former Resistance fighter (who had survived capture and torture by the Gestapo). Both men had a long record of loyalty to de Gaulle. Nonethe- less, Paoli felt that much of the mystical politics of Circuit either intended 116 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"to restore the remnants of the Royal Family to the throne in France, or else it didn’t mean anything at all—a shaggy dog story, or “mere” hoax (as distinguished from a purposeful or profitable hoax). Most of Paoli’s book tries to show, from the few issues of Circuit that he managed to get his hands on, that the group behind this magazine, the Priory of Sion (see also Church of Mary Magdalene and Gerard de Sede ), wrote in a kind of code (wine making = a very specialized eugenics, because wine = human “blood,” i.e., human genes in modern language) and that they seemed con- cerned with the special “blood” (genes) of the French Royal Family and of some related noble families in Spain, England, and elsewhere. A great deal of Paoli’s evidence does not quite lend itself to this theory or to any other rational explanation. For instance, the cover of the first issue of Circuit he saw—the one that originally aroused his curiosity—shows a map of France with the Star of David superimposed upon it, and something that looks much like a flying saucer hovering above. Although the Star of David means something positive to Jews everywhere, it also means a great deal not-positive to anti- semitic Conspiracy Theorists. Superimposing a Star of David on a nation, in anti-semitic literature, generally implies that the nation has come under control of the alleged “International Jewish Conspiracy.” Could a group named after Sion (an alternative title for Israel) also preach anti-semitism? Evidently not, in this case. Circuit strongly implies that the “wine” (genes) of the French ar- istocracy relates directly to the “wine” (genes) of the kings of Judea in Old Testament times, especially David and Solomon. But what does this have to do with that flying saucer on the cover of Circuit? (See UFO Conspiracies . ) Oddly, after the publication of Les Dessous , Paoli took a journ- alistic assignment in Israel. The government there soon arrested him on suspicion of spying, found him guilty, and shot him.

Under the 470 emergency power rules, the president may seize property, send military forces anywhere without public or con- gressional approval, institute martial law, restrict travel, seize and control all forms of communication, etc. And once the emergency had been declared by President Roosevelt, nobody could end the dictatorial situation except the president himself, by declaring the emergency over, or by a future president declar- ing the emergency over. Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton have all declined to do so. (See Lord Acton .) That ultra-individualist, Lysander Spooner (1808—1887), not only thought the Constitution was dead but that it deserved to be dead. A lifelong abolitionist, Spooner hated slavery; but he hated the Civil War even more, and re-examining the Constitution skeptically, he wrote six pamphlets ( No Treason , I-VI) arguing that the Constitution had no authority to bind later generations to remain subject to the federal government. Defining the Consti- tution as a contract, in the common law sense, Spooner, a superb lawyer, applies the rules of contract law to it and proves that, legally, it binds nobody but those who gave consent to it in 1789: And it does not so much as even purport to be a contract between persons now existing. It purports, at most, to be only a contract between persons living eighty years ago. [Spooner wrote in 1869.]...Furthermore, we know, historically, that 120 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"only a small portion even of the people then existing were consulted on the subject, or asked, or permitted to express either their consent or dissent in any formal manner. [Blacks, women, and unpropertied white males had no chance to give consent or dissent.] Those persons, if any, who did give their consent formally, are all dead now. Most of them have been dead forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy years, and the Constitution, so far as it was their contract, died with them. They had no natural power or right to make it ob- ligatory upon their children . Spooner, following common law, also insists that the Constitu- tion can only bind those who voted for it, for a contract cannot bind those who did not give written or oral assent. Thus, I can make a contract with HarperCollins, which calls on me to write a certain book and requires them to pay me a certain sum; but such a contract does not bind Norman Mailer, Danielle Steele, or Stephen King to write anything, nor does it bind HarperCollins to pay them anything, nor does it bind any other publisher to pay me moneys, except as specified in other contracts. Thus, if the Constitution is a contract, it does not bind anybody now alive to do anything whatsoever. Spooner also examines the evolution of the American govern- ment and argues, like R. Buckminster Fuller and Ezra Pound , that it is owned and controlled by international bankers. He concludes: ... the writer thinks it proper to say that, in his opinion, the Con- stitution is no such instrument as it has generally been assumed to be; but that by false interpretations, and naked usurpations, the government has been made in practice a very widely, and almost wholly, different thing from what the Robert Anton Wilson / 121"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Constitution itself purports to authorize.

Creation Science/Good Science has its own institutes and universities, its own Ph.D.’s, its own curriculum, and, like the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal or the Vatican, its own methods of distinguishing between Good Science and Bad Science. Basic tenets of Creationism/Good Science include: the physical universe has not always existed but was supernaturally created; the phenomenon of life did not develop by natural processes but was specially and supernaturally created by a personal Creator; each kind of plant and animal was created specially and none evolved from any other plant or animal; humans especially never evolved but were created with supernatural souls unlike any mere animals; etc. In short, Good Science is the science that agrees with the Judeo-Christian scriptures. The Institute for Creation Research, typical of this movement, has a staff of seven Ph.D.’s, all with degrees from prestigious universities including Harvard and UCLA, one Ed.D. and one M.D. All have impressive credentials in their fields. ICR has its own recommended reading list of Good Science. This includes, e.g., What Is Creation Science ?, by Henry M. Morris and E. G. Parker, Evolution: The Fossils Still Say No , by Duane Gish, Have You Been Brainwashed ?, by Duane Gish, etc., and a selection of books for “unsaved scientists.” The fact that most of you have never heard of any of these works just shows the extent of the control that the evolutionist conspiracy has over the media.

The circles al- ways appear overnight and have been found in fields of corn, wheat, barley, oats, etc. The plants are all bent in the same direc- tion with their stems, branches, and leaves interwoven in a sym- metry that irresistibly suggests intelligent design or even artistry to most viewers. The crops are never damaged. In some cases, orange lights in the sky are allegedly seen just before the circles appear. One farmer, Geoff Cooper, suggested that helicopters might be causing the mysterious circles and complained to the army. They said that a helicopter could only make the shapes found in Cooper’s fields “if it was flying upside down and stationary.” Cooper says another neighbor believed the circles were caused by hedgehogs rolling over and over in the fields, but Cooper calculated that it would take 40,000 of them to make all the circles in his field overnight. Other theories devised in the ’80s and still popular include: 1. Violent atmospheric disturbances, or vortexes 2. Lung-mei, or earth energies believed in by most Chinese 3. UFO landing sites 4.

High intensity UV light cohered into lasers ion- izes the air, which acts as a conductor for electrical energy that could form the circles and also occasionally create the orange lights (plasma.) One member of the group suggested that SDI technicians could not afford to get involved in such pranks and proposed that a hacker had found his way into their control sys- tem. John Michell proposed that the circles were messages from the Earth itself, or Gaia (the Greek Earth goddess) as some prefer, and that we should learn to read them as art and prophecy. All of this began to retreat into second place when the hoax theory seemed confirmed by no less than nine groups of hoaxers who demonstrated their techniques to the press. The hoax theory, however, had one outstanding flaw: New circles continued to appear and many of them had traits that none of the hoaxers could duplicate. A new theory has been put forth by a person rejoicing in the wonderful name Buddha Maitreya. Mr. Maitreya says that such circles are known in Tibet as signals that an avatar (or prophet) is about to appear, and that we should look for somebody having the traits of Buddha, Jesus, and/or King Arthur. As for hoaxers, Mr. Maitreya says they, too, are part of the “Revelation” occurring: It doesn’t matter if some of the crop circles are manmade. Man is made and moved by the Avatar. Even poems, books, songs—all forms of manmade communications are under the influence of the Holy Spirit .

At the age of 23, in 1898, he joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , an occult society dedicated to Gnostic and Cabalistic techniques of “spiritual ad- vancement”—or what we nowadays call consciousness expansion. The Golden Dawn methods that Crowley mastered included at- tainment of those borderline states variously called “out of body experience,” “guided visualization,” or “ESP” and the assumption of god-forms—“becoming one” with various deities by techniques that occultists consider supernatural and skeptics would call en- thusiastic method acting. Crowley himself habitually alternated between the occult and skeptical views. Between 1900 and 1909 Crowley traveled widely and studied, sometimes at length and sometimes only briefly, in such non- European mystical systems as Buddhism, Taoism, a few varieties of Hinduism, and Sufism. In these years he became proficient in dharana (one-pointed concentration), mantra (the use of some re- peated phrase to abolish wandering thought), yoga stretching/ relaxing exercises, the Tantric technique of sex magick (“becoming one” with a deity by identifying that deity with a sexual part- Robert Anton Wilson / 133"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"ner during the sex act), and similar arts; he also developed his own system of eclectic mysticism by creating huge tables of “correspondences” to convert the terms of any mystical school into those of any other, e.g., the Greek god Pan, the Hindu god Shiva, the Tarot card called the Hanged Man, the color blue, the element water, the Hebrew letter mem, and the drug marijuana all refer to the “astral plane” Crowley numbers 23 (or to the 23rd level of human perception in another metaphor). To activate or re-activate that level, Crowley would invoke either Pan or Shiva in a ritual featuring marijuana, blue water, and wall decorations of the Hanged Man and the letter mem. And so on, through 32 levels. In 1904, in Cairo, Crowley experienced a psychic revolution from which he emerged with “ Liber Al ” (also called “ The Book of the Law ” ), a prophetic and perplexing document he always claimed he had “received,” not written. At first, Crowley did not like the experience or the book, and managed to largely ignore them for nearly ten years. After 1914, however, he felt increasingly under their spell, and eventually he devoted the rest of his life to the “mission” the book imposed upon him. After 1919, he spoke of the Cairo experience as an encounter with a superhuman intel- ligence; one of his disciples, Kenneth Grant , has claimed the communicating entity emanated from the system of the double star, Sirius , while another student, Israel Regardie , prefers to say Crowley reached depths of the human evolutionary unconscious unknown to either Freud or Jung. Whoever or whatever Crowley contacted, its major messages became the closest thing to dogmas in his largely agnostic mysti- cism: “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.” “Love is the law, love under will.” “Every man and every woman is a star.” Liber Al also foretells wars and revolutions undreamed of by Crowley’s conscious mind or by any other 1904 intellectual, but offers a promise of a new society rising from the universal wreck- 134 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"age somewhere in the future. Its last paragraph tells you that its message “is revealed and concealed.” Revealed to those ready to receive it and concealed from others, perhaps? During both World War I and World War II, Crowley appears to have worked for British Intelligence, although conflicting evidence suggests that he also worked for German Intelligence, at least in the first conflict. This mystery, and the unknown identity of the power or entity unleashed in Cairo, has made Crowley a central figure in most of the religious and demonolog- ical conspiracy theories of our time. Early in his career, Crowley changed his first name to Aleister, so that the Cabalistic “number” of his name would add to 666 , identified with the Antichrist in the Revelation of St. John. He also delighted in frightening, baffling, and playing sadistic jokes on the orthodox and gullible. Thus, his reputation as a Satanist definitely does not result entirely from the paranoias of the reli- gious right; he deliberately played the role at times, although al- ways in an absurd and satirical manner. In addition to “respectable” mystical practices from the tradi- tions mentioned, Crowley also pioneered the study of shamanic/ psychedelic states and used any and all mind-altering drugs with huge gusto, according to which of the 32 planes he wished to visit, ending his life as a heroin addict. He worked his way through the various degrees of several orthodox and unorthodox Freemasonic lodges, including the Scotch and York Rites, and the Order of Memphis and Mizraim, and the Ordo Templi Orientis , of which he became Outer Head. (The Inner Head presumably remains invisible to the un-Illuminated.) Since his death, Crowley has become accepted as the Magus of the New Aeon in some oc- cult circles (a title roughly equivalent to the Master of the New Age) but still retains an even wider reputation (among right- wingers) as the major Satanist of our century.

His favorite Masonic symbol, the eye in the tri- angle, has also become mysteriously entangled with the Great Seal of the United States , the New Deal, the Federal Reserve Bank , and the New World Order . Aleister Crowley died in 1947, at the age of 72, an amazing feat of longevity considering the shocks and strains he put on both his mind and body. He had written dozens of volumes of poetry, a few novels, scores of mystic essays, and had many achievements in the fields of chess, hunting, and mountain climbing, including the highest climb on the Himalayan peak K2 ever accomplished without oxygen tanks (1904; 23,000 feet).

In a sense, the daimonic is like the collective unconscious of Carl Jung, inside us as a part of our total self that the ego wishes to deny, outside us in all the other humans who ever existed and in the dreams, myths, and arts of all the world. But Harpur follows Irish poet (and Golden Dawn alumnus) W. B. Yeats as often as he follows Jung, and traces some of his ideas back to Giordano Bruno and the alchemical/hermetic mystics of the Renaissance. The daimonic is just a bit more personalized and individualized than Jung’s species unconscious. Harpur’s major thesis is that unless we recognize the daimonic (make friends with it, Jung would say) it takes increasingly ma- lignant and terrifying forms. For instance, the Greys of UFO ab- duction lore, he says, are deliberately mirroring our ego-centered and “scientistic” age—showing no emotions of the humans they experiment upon, just as the ideal science student feels no emotion and has no concern with the emotions of the animal being tortured in his laboratory.

Basically, Morgan sees the phenomenon of terrorism as “the son practicing what the father has practiced,” a Freudian way of saying that what we call terrorism is the acts of the poor, the minorities, and the misfits fighting back against the power elite of the world, using the same tactics that the elite uses. When the rich do it, it is called war or at least “police action”; when the victims, or those who identify with the victims, use the same methods, we are trained to call it “terrorism.” In another italicized passage, Morgan sums up: Terrorism is the “ democratization of violence .” But settling differences violently has little to do with specific issues or specific quarrels; it results from the fact that men are trained to be “belligerent” by that monstrous entity, the Patri- archy.

Dick, one of the most prolific science-fiction writers of our age and in the opinion of most critics one of the very best (two highly successful films, Blade Runner and Total Recall , were based on stories by him), entered an Altered State of Conscious- ness in his last years and became either a religious prophet, a major existentialist philosopher, or a raving nut, depending on how you want to look at it. One of Dick’s psychotherapists tried to convince him that his whole experience derived from sexual abuse suffered as an infant. 152 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"In a sense, it all began on November 17, 1971 when persons unknown broke into Dick’s house while he was away, stole many of his files, and did enough pointless, malicious damage to suggest that some threat was intended. Since Dick had been active in both the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement, it is likely that the break-in was either part of the FBI’s COINTELPRO oper- ation—an attempt to terrorize dissidents—or one of the capers of Nixon’s “plumbers” unit—later famous for the Watergate burglary. In any event, Dick felt that he had become a person of interest to powerful and unknown adversaries. Three years later, in February 1974, Dick had a tooth extraction for which he was given sodium pentathol. He had previously used acid in the 1960s (who didn’t?), frequently employed methamphetamine to finish books on deadline, and had more recently flooded his body with megadoses of vitamins in accord with 1970s’ ideas of maximum health. He thought all of these might have played a role in what happened. For over a month, February to March, Dick watched as his whole universe collapsed and was replaced not by a new universe but by a series of hypothetical or virtual universes. He was literally living in many of his own sci-fi plots and in the Gnostic theology that fascinated him. Sometimes, he thought that he was remem- bering a past life as a Gnostic Christian in Rome ca. 70 A.D. ; sometimes, that his late friend, Bishop James Pike, had reincarn- ated within him; sometimes that three-eyed beings from Sirius controlled all life on Earth; sometimes that he was accidentally trapped in a telepathic transmission channel used between Rus- sian parapsychologists and extraterrestrials; etc. As he returned to comparative normalcy, Dick came more and more to think of the Experience as a revelation of the greatest false memory case in history, imposed on all humanity, from Robert Anton Wilson / 153"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"which he had partially awakened. That is, The Empire Never Ended (he always printed it in boldface, like that): most of the last 2,000 years of history never happened. We have been brain- washed by the Roman Empire to think he were are living in a totally false world (the Black Iron Prison, Dick called it), so we would not know we were actually living in the Messianic Age. Nixon is Nero, the assassinations we think we remember are distortions of the real memory of the Christians being thrown to the lions, and nothing inside the Black Iron Prison of ordinary perception is what it seems. Being both a philosopher and a science-fiction poet, Dick came to doubt this theory also. In fact, the longest book he ever wrote, not yet published in full, is a 1,000 plus page Exegesis on his ex- perience and some lingering aftermaths of altered perception, in which he tries one theory after another to understand what was happening to him and never does decide. At one point, he attrib- uted his experiences to Zebra, a hypothetical giant intelligence that remains invisible because it looks like the environment, as some insects do—but Zebra looks like the whole environment. Often, he spoke instead of VALIS, a Vast Active Living Intelli- gence System, left here by the three-eyed Sirians to aid our evol- ution. His last novel, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer , rejects all metaphysical interpretations of the hero’s similar experiences and concludes that all we can learn from consciousness expansion is to be more tolerant, to love each other a hell of a lot more, and to do something concrete and practical about the suffering and injustice on this planet. He died of a stroke shortly thereafter; if he hadn’t, his next book would undoubtedly have offered yet another exegesis of what was happening to Phil Dick and the world he lived in.

While some claim the Discordian movement is a complicated joke disguised as a new religion, Discordians counter that it is actually a new religion disguised as a complicated joke. The Discordians are divided into two camps, according to the rule, “We Discordians must stick apart.” On one side, the Erisian Liberation Front (ELF) led by Ho Chih Zen ( Kerry Thornley ) promotes anarchist/libertarian anti-authoritarianism, and on the other side, the Paratheo-Anametamystikhood of Eris Esoteric (POEE), led by Malaclypse the Younger (Gregory Hill), teaches a more mystic, passive doctrine, vaguely akin to Charles Fort , Pataphysics, and Deconstructionism.

The Royal Family, a caller said, had ordered the “hit” out of fear that Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, an Arab , might wield undue influence over the future king of England, Prince William. This scenario, with variations and additions, reappears in most of the conspiracy theories about Di’s death. According to the Fortean Times , the theory of an anti-Arab motive behind the “hit” has even been endorsed by President 156 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Mummar al-Qaddafi of Libya, whom they quote as saying “Britain is the vilest of countries” for “executing an Arab citizen who wanted to marry an English princess.” The same theory has ap- peared in the Egyptian newspapers, they say. But the Forteans also mention more imaginative theories circulating in England, including reports of “strange lights,” so the UFO conspiracy and the Diana legend can be expected to merge in the near future. Among the alternative scenarios: Diana’s opposition to land mines got her killed by arms dealers; an Arab Fundamentalist suicide bomber did it; the driver had been dosed with LSD by a “micro- injector”; the deaths were faked to allow Di and Dodi to escape from the damned tabloids. The most intricately interesting scenario emerged from an on- line magazine called “ Conspiracy Nation ,” under the wonderful headline “Whoever Controls Princess Diana Controls the World.” According to this version, the scene of the “accident” contains the real clue to what was afoot: the Pont de l’Alma tunnel, which “is ancient, dating back to the time of the Merovingian kings (ca. 500—751 A.D. ), and before.” “In pre-Christian times, the Pont de l’Alma was a pagan sacrificial site,” Conspiracy Nation notes, going on to claim that the name combines alma (soul) and pontis (bridge), i.e., “bridge of the soul.” All “true European royalty is descended from the Merovingians,” the article continues, it then repeats the recent claims that the Merovingians were descended from Jesus. Princess Diana, as a Spencer, was descended from the Stuarts who gave England four kings (James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II) and who are partially Merovingian in bloodline. By comparis- on, the article says, the current British royal family are “im- posters.” Two factions vied for control of Diana: (1) the New World Order or Bank of England faction, founded by King William III of Or- ange, who allowed the founding of the (private) Bank of England, and (2) Robert Anton Wilson / 157"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"the “true nobility of Europe, i.e., those of the Merovingian bloodline,” the article goes on. But it adds further complexity: Within the New World Order faction, there are smaller, warring factions, exemplified by Rothschilds vs. Rockefellers. The plan of the New World Order faction was to marry Lady Diana to an American. Even though Bill Clinton has bastard roots in the Rockefeller clan, he is rejected by them and is aligned with the Rothschilds. Bill Clinton was the designated future husband for Lady Diana, with Hillary Clinton to be eliminated through divorce or even murder. The Rockefellers were furious; in no way would they allow a marriage between Bill Clinton and Lady Diana. In Great Britain, Prince William would be on the throne by age 25; if Prince Charles did not abdicate, he would be assassinated . But Lady Di refused to marry Bill Clinton and seemed inclined to marry Dodi, thus also marrying into the Saudi royal family; for this impropriety MI6 (British intelligence) decided to eliminate her. They picked the Pont de l’Alma to “send a signal” that would eventually lead to the creation of a Saint Diana, i.e., a new form of the triple moon goddess of the pagans, often called Diana. Con Nation concludes: “It will be the start of ‘the new religion.’ Who controls the new religion controls the world.” Fortean Times , without endorsing any of the conspiracy theories, offers a similar view of the trajectory of the Dianic cult: Reconciling most of the aspects of the Great Mother religion of antiquity, the new goddess Diana even borrows from the rival cults of Mother Teresa, Princess Grace, and Evita (Peron); perhaps in time, all will be rolled into one . They point out that healings have already been attributed to Diana and her apparition has been seen in a portrait of Charles I in St. James Palace. 158 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Even cartoonist Jules Feiffer entered the Di Conspiracy World, or at least penetrated it, with his newspaper cartoon of September 21, 1997, in which an intense lady proclaims: “ The TRUE story is: Princess Di had fallen under the influence of these Egyptian fat-cat money guys—so once Prince William ascended, they would be the power behind the throne.

How many forgeries did this multinamed individual actually commit? That question has bothered quite a few art historians and students of criminal fraud, because after serving a short prison term Elmyr (or Baron Hoffman or whoever he was that day) gleefully collaborated with a young American author, Clif- ford Irving , in writing the whole story of his criminal career in a book called Fake !—a title to ponder more than once. The book claims that Elmyr was responsible for more than a thousand of the classics of modern art now hanging in museums all over the world. This comprises a large part of our artistic canon, and the claim has, of course, been widely disputed. Orson Welles later made a film about the Elmyr scandal, in which the baron or whatever we call him dashes off some very real-looking Picassos, Modiglianis, Van Dunkens, etc., right on camera before our eyes. As in the book, Elmyr in the film insists that he and other unnamed forgers can fool the so-called art ex- perts easily, and that these experts keep their “authority” only through imposture and group conspiracy. Should we believe this old fraud, or should we believe the canonical Experts, who admit- tedly were fooled by him on at least some occasions? The Experts say they can recognize a real style and distinguish it from a counterfeit, the way somebody sensitive to prose knows that “every galoot ahoof” was written by H.L. Mencken and not by a cunning counterfeiter. The problem grows more thorny as the film reveals the fraud- ulent activities of Elmyr’s collaborator, Mr. Irving, in the matter of a Howard Hughes biography. That bit of hokeypokey hinged for a while on whether the courts would believe a voice on a speaker phone that sounded like Hughes or a signature on a con- tract produced by Irving, which three Experts absolutely authentic- ated as 162 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"definitely by Hughes.

All this would be minor compared to some of the other shady dealings in this book, except that the Howard Hughes debate brushes very close to what look like major political conspiracies, and the canonicity of the art “experts” is now under renewed at- tack by post-modernists and multiculturalists in the universities, who claim, like Elmyr, that art experts operate largely on bluff, a claim proven, they say, by the fact that virtually all the “classics” recognized by them were created by white males like themselves.

Vicki Jordison (b. 1949) grew up to fancy herself a combination Bible scholar and visionary, who could read hidden meanings in Bible texts. When in 1971 she married Randy Weaver (b. 1948), they became an average, only mildly right-wing Christian fam- ily—but soon Vicki’s visions would change all that. After reading Hal Lindsay’s The Late Great Planet Earth —a Fundamentalist in- terpretation of Bible prophecies, proving that we are living in the last days of this planet, after which the rest of the universe will become pointless—Vicki became increasingly apocalyptical, and read more and more conspiracy literature, especially which claimed the Illuminati and the Freemasons who control the Council on Foreign Relations . In Matthew 24, she found a “prophecy” that she interpreted to mean that the final battle between Christ and Antichrist would occur in 1987. Randy, although more the follower than the leader, had equally visionary ideas of his own, and eventually the Weavers fled to Ruby Ridge, a mountain high in Idaho near the Canadian border, to arm themselves and prepare for the holocaust—the day in 1987 164 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"when the ZOG (Zionist Occupied Government) would begin slaughtering all the Christians. Like all similar millennialist groups, the Weavers did not lose faith when 1987 passed without any Armageddon; they simply recalculated and waited, knowing that, although they as humans were fallible, the Bible was infallible. Then Randy made a cata- clysmic mistake: Needing money, he sold a sawed-off shotgun to a government informant. The informant had previously done a good job in exposing The Order, a neo-Nazi terrorist group re- sponsible for several bank robberies and at least one murder. He thought Randy was another of that ilk; actually, Randy had never belonged to any Nazi or neo-Nazi group. But when he realized he had been entrapped, Randy immediately decided the ZOG was planning to kill him and his family. The Weavers dug in and prepared to defend their little piece of mountain. The 18-month siege and tragedy that followed were based on mutual paranoias: The government agents believed the Weavers were neo-Nazi terrorists (they were simply a little to the right of most rustic Christians), and the Weavers believed all the govern- ment agents who tried to persuade Randy to surrender and stand trial were the terrible Satanic ZOG, beginning the long-expected slaughter of the Christians at last. In the climax Vicki was killed, shot dead while she held her newest baby in her arms. The Weavers’ 14-year-old son and the family dog, Striker, were also killed in the general fury, and the government generally behaved as badly as the Great Beast the Weavers took it for. After prolonged self-investigation, the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms found themselves innocent of all misbehavior; but the man who fired the shot that killed Vicki took the Fifth Amendment, and another agent was suspended for shredding documents.

They are also aware that gold and silver cannot be counterfeited. They prefer the paper method.” The same author tells an amusing, somewhat eerie story of finding a piece of “real” paper money in his attic—that is, a silver certificate, the old-fashioned paper dollar that could be redeemed for one dollar of silver. He tried to exchange the silver certificate for silver in various ways and was always sent somewhere else, until at last he discovered that banks stopped redeeming silver certificates for real silver in 1964 and this paper, like other Federal 170 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Reserve paper, is now good only to exchange for other paper.

The first “money” or whatever it is issued by the Fed in 1914 stated clearly: This Note Is Receivable By All National and Member Banks and Federal Reserve Banks and for All Taxes, Customs, and Other Public Dues. It Is Redeemable in Gold on Demand At the Treasury Department of the United States in the City of Washington, Dis- trict of Columbia or in Gold or Lawful Money At Any Federal Reserve Bank . While many critics (e.g., Ezra Pound ) doubt the legality or morality of the Fed issuing money, this money was worth some- thing redeemable in gold or lawful money. (The Constitution, remember, demands that “lawful money” be made only of silver or gold). By 1950 this was revised to This Note Is Legal Tender for All Debts, Public and Private, and Is Redeemable in Lawful Money At the United States Treasury, or At Any Federal Reserve Bank . While this was more ambiguous—how many citizens know the constitutional definition of lawful money?—it would still stand up in court as meaning that you could receive gold or silver on demand in exchange for the Fed’s paper. But in 1963, this wording was replaced with the motto that still remains: This Note Is Legal Tender for All Debts, Public and Private . This simply means that the money cannot be exchanged for any real metal, or even for cows (like ancient Roman money).

Critics of banking rant so often against the Rothschilds and David Rockefeller because the Rothschild Bank of London and Chase Manhattan (Rockefeller’s own) are said, we know not on what authority, to own most of the Fed. Matthew Josephson, a conspiriologist of the 1930s—1950s, whose works are currently unfindable, insisted the real power was held by the Warburg Bank of Amsterdam and was part of the “Orange” take-over of England and America, after the mildly illegal installation of the Dutchman William of Orange as King of England.

Allegedly directed by, certainly edited by, and starring Orson Welles , the film deals largely with the career of Elmyr , an art forger who may or may not have created a large share of the masterpieces of modern art now hanging in museums. Whether Elmyr was a real faker all the time or a fake faker part of the time (i.e., whether he faked as much as he gleefully claims) remains unresolved, but the film’s evidence does tend to support Elmyr’s basic claim that art “experts” cannot tell a real Picasso from a fake Picasso any more than you or I can and survive only through a conspiracy of brazen bluffing. Interwoven with the Elmyr theme almost like a Bach fugue (the film uses extensive montage, flashback, flashforward, and deconstructs before our eyes) is the story of Elmyr’s biographer, Clifford Irving , who later almost sold a seemingly faked bio- graphy of 174 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Howard Hughes . A sort of climax arrives when the audience has to decide between the authenticity of opposing versions of the “truth” provided by (1) a seeming contract signed by Hughes (signature and notes authenticated by handwriting “experts”) and (2) a voice on a phone claiming to be Hughes (after many conspiracy theories already asserted at least one Hughes imper- sonator, and maybe two, had replaced the dead-or-dying billion- aire). A third theme concerns Welles’ own career as an “acting forger” (his own term) and a master of deception as both magician and stage/film director, but this gets confusingly intercut with the story of “fabulously rich” Oja Kodor, who swindled Picasso out of some of his own paintings, we are told, and who seems to have strange links with Clifford Irving and dark, sinister, never identi- fied Swiss bankers. (See Gnomes of Zurich . ) Welles adds darkly that “the lawyers” have warned him not to explore too far into that side of the story. But a Baroness is involved, and another art faker, and...at this point Welles reveals that some of the movie is itself fake and the audience is left to work out for themselves what to believe and what to doubt. Parts of the film were directed by Francois Reichenbach, not Welles, and Reichenbach also once acted as a salesman for Elmyr’s forged paintings, giving us further cause for suspicion. The story of Hughes walking around the desert with Kleenex boxes instead of shoes has many supporting witnesses; but the present author does not know what to think about the yarn concerning a ham sandwich hidden every night in a tree Hughes would pass. And Oja Kodor was not “fabulously rich” and did not swindle Picasso out of any paintings, but did become the last Mrs. Orson Welles...

Among those killed was Dorothy Hunt, wife of E. Howard Hunt , and within days Chicago radical Sherman Skolnick began to claim that the evidence indicated that the plane had been sabotaged in order to kill Mrs. Hunt. While this matter re- mains in heated controversy, the basic case against conspiracy rests on the fact that the National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the FBI all conducted investigations and all concluded the crash was an accident. To those with suspicious minds (especially about government agencies) that does not close the matter. Skolnick, for instance, points out that 50 FBI agents arrived at the scene of the crash al- most immediately, although the nearest FBI office was a 40-minute drive away. Fifty FBI agents are seldom in one office; they are usually out in the field, unless they have gathered for a special project.

The orthodox say he could have inhaled it from chemical reactions unleashed by the crash; heretics say this is absurd and the 3.9 micrograms per milliliter in the pilot could only result from deliberate poisoning . • Acting quickly after the crash, President Nixon personally appointed two close associates to dominant positions in the investigation—Egil Krogh to the Department of Transportation, and Alexander Butterfield to the Federal Aviation Authority. Within a month, a third Nixon crony, Dwight Chapin, left the White House to take a position with United Airlines, which involved him in every phase of the investiga- tion . • After the crash the flight recorder disappeared and then reappeared mysteriously, allegedly returned by the Sanitation Department who had picked it up by mistake (at a crash site ?). The major argument against believing that Nixon and/or his co-conspirators blew Flight 553 out of the sky is that our govern- ment wouldn’t kill 44 innocent people just to get rid of one incon- venient woman.

Specifically, McKenna thinks the drugs considered okay- to-good in our society (sugar, caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, tranquil- izers) help tailor us all to what he calls the Dominator style of patriarchy. That is, the sugar and caffeine and nicotine keep us all “wired” enough to maintain the competitive, mildly sociopath- ic personal ego necessary to survive in such a society and to per- petuate the values of that domination/submission system; the booze and tranks allow us the occasional numbing and escape without which we would all probably crack up or crumble under the stress. Similarly, McKenna argues, the drugs subject to violent taboo in our society are incompatible with Dominator values and open us to shamanic, communal, and merging (mystic) experi- ences—e.g., marijuana and psychedelics. Cultures based on drugs of that sort, he tries to show, are mellower, kinder, and funnier than ours, and all tend to consider us a bit crazy. This model, worked out with enormous erudition for 300 pages of closely reasoned text, may not be the whole truth or the only truth, but it has a lot of persuasiveness. For instance, it explains the oddity noted by Judge Robert Sweet: The government con- tinually uses the very real dangers of crack cocaine in its propa- ganda, to keep us alarmed and enthusiastic about its drug wars, but it actually spends 85 percent of its anti-drug budget fighting the relatively harmless and often medicinal marijuana. If crack is so awful (and it is), why spend almost the entire budget fighting another drug?

In four very funny, very well-documented, and (to the orthodox) very annoy- ing books— The Book of the Damned (1919), New Lands (1923), Lo !

He also developed his own philosophy of super-agnosticism (much like modern Deconstructionism), holding that nothing we think is absolutely true and every idea and perception exists in a probabilistic flux. Even if we could find an absolutely true statement at a date, Fort says, it would not remain true for very long. Fort also conjectured, humorously, about things others would later take seriously, e.g., the possibility of alien invasions in the past, or of humans who currently have contact with aliens and aid them in some cosmic scheme unknown to the rest of us. “I think we’re Robert Anton Wilson / 181"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"property,” he wrote once.

Although Masonry is often denounced as either a political or religious “conspiracy,” Freemasons are forbidden to discuss either politics or religion within the lodge.

The only values taught in all Masonic lodges, Dryfoos and other Masons say, are charity, tolerance, and brotherhood. The more rabid anti-Masons, of course, dismiss such testimony as flat lies. The enemies of Masonry, who are usually Roman Catholics or Fundamentalist Protestants, insist that the rites of the order con- tain “pagan” elements. This is probably true, but only to the extent that these religions themselves contain “pagan” elements, e.g., the Yule festival, the Spring Solstice festival, the dead-and-resur- rected martyr (Jesus, allegedly historical, to Christians; Hiram, admittedly allegorical, to Masons). All these and many other elements in Christianity and Masonry have a long prehistory in paganism, as documented in the 12 volumes of Sir James George Frazer’s Golden Bough . The major offense of Masonry to orthodox churches is that it, like our First Amendment, encourages equal tolerance for all re- ligions, and this tends, somewhat, to lessen dogmatic allegiance to any one religion.

Gehlen had suc- ceeded at penetrating Soviet Intelligence because of his alliance with General Andrei Vlassov, a Red Army officer who secretly belonged to a pro-Czarist anti-communist underground. (See Double-Cross System .) After the war, Gehlen had even more astonishing achieve- ments—he not only avoided standing trial with the other top Nazis, but brokered a deal that got him out of his Nazi uniform and into an American General’s uniform within a week. This deal also made him the most powerful U.S. spy in Europe, heading his own organization, the superspooky Gehlenapparat mentioned in many spy novels (it was made up mostly of ex-Nazis and White Russians). Gehlen had managed this “sweetheart contract” by burying 52 boxes of intelligence information about the Soviet Union and trading them for the best deal he could get from the U.S., and he soon became the major source of CIA ideas about what was going on in the Soviet Union. As historian Carl Oglesby has noted, since the CIA’s image of Soviet realities came mostly from die-hard Czarists by way of a Nazi general, it may not have matched perfectly with objective reality. The Gehlenapparat acted entirely without U.S. supervision, under the terms of Gehlen’s deal. The CIA told him what they wanted, and he got it for them, and they had no knowledge (and probably wanted no knowledge) of how he did it.

Gelli escaped prosecution as a war criminal, because members of the underground testified on his behalf. After becoming involved in the CIA’s Gladio project, Gelli re- peated his previous feat and got himself on the payroll of the KGB also. After he formed the P2 conspiracy as an adjunct or outgrowth of Gladio, Gelli soon became one of the most powerful men in Italy, since the rules of P2 required a “confession” during the initiation and this provided mountains of future blackmail material. When the whole P2 scheme collapsed and Gelli fled Italy (he had been tipped off that he was about to be arrested by another P2 member, in military intelligence) documents found in his house revealed that P2 members included 43 members of Parliament, three cabinet ministers, around 900 miscellaneous government officials, the heads of every branch of the armed services, the head of military intelligence, the head of civilian intelligence, the civilian coordinator of intelligence, top officials of the state-owned broadcasting company, and many top industrialists and financiers. Gelli laid low in South America for a while, then returned to Europe with a false passport and tried to withdraw some money from a numbered Swiss bank account. He was recognized, arres- ted, and held for extradition to Italy; but the Swiss, who allegedly have the most incorruptible police in the world, were unable to hold him for more than 72 hours. Then he vanished from his cell—a miracle not yet explained—and returned to South America.

His Gemstone File ran over 1,000 pages and so far nobody has been willing to publish it; but it had progeny—most of them bearing the title Skeleton Key to the Gemstone File , but otherwise differing in what they included and excluded. One version, with the original title, Illuminati Research Report , merges one of the Skeleton Keys with the “ Protocols of the Elders of Zion ” and the metaphysical time line from Neal Wilgus’ “ The Illuminoids ” .

The second Gemstone File , edited by conspiriologist Jim Keith, is a collection of essays by various “experts” (Mae Brussell, Jonathan Vankin, Kerry Thornley , the present author, etc.) attempt- ing to evaluate the accuracy, or degree of accuracy, of the original epic. The earliest Skeleton Key mailed out to many researchers while Roberts was dying was the work of a journalist named Stephanie Caruana, who believed every word of it; it begins: 1932: Onassis, a Greek drug pusher and ship owner who made his first million selling “Turkish tobacco” (opium) in Argentina, worked out a profitable deal with Joseph Kennedy, Eugene Meyer, and Meyer Lansky. Onassis was to ship booze directly into Boston for Joseph Kennedy. Also involved was a heroin deal with Franklin and Elliot Roosevelt . Anybody who gives up immediately, rejecting this as obvious paranoia, misses most of the excitement. Roberts/Caruana go on, year after year, from 1932 to 1975, linking every important figure in American finance, politics, and business with the Mafia in a whirling chaos of dope, murder, double-dealing, vendetta, and every type of felony. We are told that Onassis, for instance, took over the Mafia itself, an organization all other authorities agree is all-Sicilian at the top. When Howard Hughes became a threat, due to his control of Nixon and other politicians, Onassis had him kidnapped, held prisoner on the island of Skorpios, and forcibly made him a heroin addict. A double named L.W. Rector thereafter impersonated Hughes. When Joe Kennedy had a stroke in 1961, John and Bobby rebelled against Onassis/Mafia control and had to be eliminated. Mary Jo Kopechne learned too much, reading files while working for the Kennedy organization, and was drowned to shut her up. Etc.

She considers Onassis, like Nixon, a true villain, but not smart enough to outwit the supervillains, who are still unknown.

Jim Keith thinks it contains both believable and unbelievable elements. Kerry Thornley insists that the work must be a hoax, because Roberts seems to know everything and those who really research this kind of material are more often confused and uncertain about parts of the picture (often, crucial parts). Perhaps the most plausible part of the yarn: the story of how Howard Hughes set out to buy the U.S. government, a bit at a time, building up to virtually owning a president, Richard Nixon. The most implausible part: the claim that Johnny Roselli per- sonally shot John F. Kennedy in Dallas. The idea of a top Mafioso like Roselli doing his own shooting in a case like that belongs in a B movie. If Roselli was involved, as others have conjectured, you can be sure he would be in another town at the time and have no direct link to the gunman. The best bit of classic myth: the explanation of how Onassis had to assassinate an associate of Hughes named Merryman for revealing some inside dirt to Clifford Irving . Legends say the Bruce Roberts got his basic information hanging out in a bar where CIA agents met to relax. Some of these yarns sound like they could only come out of a bar full of drunken spooks.

Based on the English art, or science, or fad, of “ley hunting” (looking for hidden energy patterns in the landscape), Wood connects all the important sites in literature about the Priory—including the tomb in Nicholas Poussin ’s Shepherds of Arcadia —and emerges with a pattern he calls The Vagina of Nuit. (See “ Liber Al .” ) From this design and various facts and legends about the buildings within the design, Wood deduces a whole revised his- tory of France and of humanity in general, which reveals that we all came from Atlantis and that our creator was not the God of the Universe but a consortium of extraterrestrials from Sirius named the Elohim, who left us in a fairly botched and unfinished state. (“Elohim,” the name for the creative power in Genesis, is a fe- male plural, a fact that generations of learned rabbis and Christian theologians have all explained as merely a grammatical conven- tion. The King James and most other Bibles translate it as “God,” but if you take the grammar literally, it seems to mean “god- desses.” Al Shaddai, god of battles, appears later, and YHVH, mispronounced Jehovah, later still.)

It is estimated that he personally killed 20 men before he was out of his teens, and was involved in the assassinations of more than 200 in his lifetime. Sam was called “Mooney” in the mob because of his reputation for bizarre and irrational episodes; the same pattern of borderline psychosis appeared in, and gave the nicknames to, George “Bugs” Moran and Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel. Even among gangsters, some people are considered too far outside polite social norms, and Sam Giancana was one of them. Sam bragged about having participated in the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre (February 14, 1929) in which seven members of the “Bugs” Moran gang were executed for impinging on Capone’s territory; but from such uncouth beginnings he rose to control, or exert power within, most of the unions in Hollywood and the nationwide Teamsters as well. Giancana also played a large role in the election of John Kennedy as president, through his Chicago mob connections. Kennedy won by the smallest margin of any president in the 20th century, and most analysts agree he owed it to the Chicago vote, which netted him Illinois. Giancana had helped elect John F. Kennedy as a favor to Joe Kennedy, an old friend who had worked in the bootlegging business with Sam. When the Kennedy brothers began their public war on the Mafia, Sam felt hurt and betrayed.

In the closing days of World War II, Angleton, then an OSS officer, began forming a circle of common interests with various Italian fascists (or, rather, with Italy’s surrender, newborn ex-fascists), who all shared his dread of the Italian Communist Party, the largest in Europe. To prevent the communists from winning control of the Parliament, or even seating enough members to be a large enough minority to make problems, Angleton and friends set about controlling the results of Italian elections by a variety of tactics. When Angleton became chief of counter intelligence for the CIA, this scheme acquired an official name, Gladio, and enough budget to play havoc with Italian politics until the 1980s or maybe even to the present. Gladio forged secret alliances between the Mafia and certain Vatican officials; recruited former fascists to conduct terror attacks blamed on the left; paid millions to political parties, journalists, and others to tilt elections to the right and away from the left; and probably supervised the kidnapping and murder of Prime Minister Aldo Moro, who had included com- munists in his cabinet. In May 1965, the master plan of Gladio was outlined in a paper called “The Strategy of Tension,” which was a scenario to fake so much left-wing terrorism that the Italian people would want, and even demand, a more authoritarian or neo-fascist govern- ment. A copy of this was found in the home of Licio Gelli after he fled Italy, just as the police came to arrest him, in March 1981. The Knights of Malta served as the backbone of Gladio, and Gelli, a Knight of Malta himself, when he formed his ultra-secret P2 lodge within Freemasonry, gave major importance to two other Knights of Malta, Roberto Calvi and Michele “The Shark” Sindona . 200 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"See also: Cisalpine Bank, John Hull, Paul “The Gorilla” Marcinkus, World Finance Corporation References: http://www.worldmedia.com/caq/articles/gladio.html In God’s Name , by David Yallop, Bantam, New York, 1984 Gnomes of Zurich British Prime Minister Harold Wilson once denounced “the Gnomes of Zurich,” saying that they had more power than any government in Europe.

Mathers, William Wynn Wescott, and William Woodman, and a mysterious Bavarian woman, Anna Sprengel . Either (1) Westcott found some ciphered papers in Freemason’s Hall, London, which put him in touch with Fraulein Sprengel, or (2) he found the papers in a bookstall, or (3) he and Woodman and Mathers made up the whole story, or (4) Westcott made it all up alone and deceived Woodman and Mathers. Those were the most accepted theories until very recently, when new evidence suggested that the Golden Dawn could have evolved out of (1) the Loge zur augehenden Morgenrothe , a Masonic lodge in Frankfurt, which established a branch in France called Aurore naissante (both titles mean “Rising Dawn”) and a branch in London and/or (2) the Chabrath Zerek Auor Bokher , or Society of the Shining Light of Dawn, a Cabalistic college in London, founded by one Johannes Falk from Hamburg, Germany.

Like ordinary Freemasonry, the Golden Dawn had a system of grades, each one marked by an initiatory ritual intended to make a lasting impression on the consciousness of the candid- ate—to bring him or her closer and closer to Illumination in the mystical sense. This was combined with profound study of Christian Cabala, a derivative of the original Jewish Cabala, a science or art that provides a religious language and numerology to discuss and clarify various altered states of consciousness. The influence of the Golden Dawn extended far beyond con- ventional occultism. Much of modern literary culture owes its symbolism and themes to this group; not only Yeats’ poetry, but even the works of James Joyce, Ezra Pound , and T.S. Eliot, show Golden Dawn elements, which were common currency in the London of 1900—1914, where all these writers met. Modern horror fiction is replete with themes H. P. Lovecraft acquired at secondhand from Blackwood and Machen. The Tarot deck, virtu- ally forgotten by all but gypsy fortune-tellers, is now widely studied for both mystic and psychological meanings, due to the Waite and Crowley Tarot decks, both based on the Golden Dawn deck. The Golden Dawn fell into dissension and acrimony in 1898 and has continued to remain disunited.

Reference: Same as Good Times—1 above Government as Criminal Conspiracy The view that our government per se is nothing more nor less than one giant criminal conspiracy appears in both extreme right- wing and extreme left-wing forms. Anarchists hold that government is not a “necessary evil” as conservatives think but an unnecessary evil. This viewpoint is expressed variously by Proudhon, Bakunin, Tolstoy, Kropotkin, Warren, Malatesta, and many others. It was probably stated most succinctly by Tom Paine, who wrote, “The trade of governing has always been monopolized by the most ignorant and most rascally individuals of mankind.” Tolstoy put it even more bluntly: “Government is an association of men who do violence to the rest of us.” Lysander Spooner , lawyer and libertarian, deflated the “demo- cratic” claims of modern governments with succinct sarcasm: 208 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The right of absolute and irresponsible dominion is the right of property, and the right of property is the right of absolute, irrespons- ible dominion....

They say they are only our servants, agents, attorneys, and representatives. But this declaration involves an absurdity, a contradiction. No man can be my servant, agent, attorney, or representative, and be, at the same time, uncontrollable by me, and irresponsible to me for his acts. Pierre Joseph Proudhon, the first writer to use “anarchism” as a positive word, put it even more brutally: To be governed is to be watched over, inspected, spied on, directed, legislated at, regulated, docketed, indoctrinated, preached at, con- trolled, assessed, weighed, censored, ordered about.... To be gov- erned means to be, at each transaction, at each movement, noted, registered, taxed, stamped, measured, evaluated, patented, licensed, authorized, endorsed, admonished, hampered, reformed, rebuked, arrested,...held to ransom, exploited, monopolized, extorted, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed, and then, at the least resistance,...to be repressed, fined, abused, annoyed, followed, bullied, beaten, dis- armed, garroted, imprisoned, machine-gunned, judged, condemned, deported, flayed, sold, betrayed, and finally mocked, ridiculed, in- sulted, dishonored .

In reply to this canard, the Orange Lodge declares, “It should be remembered that the [Orange] Order has a worldwide membership and that wherever its Lodges exist there is to be found a brotherhood of men pledged to uphold the ancient concept of the Protestant faith and liberty under the law.” See also: Gnomes of Zurich, Holy Order of the Lemon, Noon Blue Apples References: Orange view of itself— http://www.gpl.net/customers/goli/ Catholic view of Orangemen— Author’s six years’ residence in Ireland Robert Anton Wilson / 211"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Grand Orient Lodge of Egyptian Freemasonry See: Calvi Affair , Dr. John Dee, Grand Loge Alpina, High IQ Bulletin , H.P.

Since ca. 1985, he has been reduced to one of the 1,005 claimants to the title, because a group of dissidents, in rebellion against him, sent out cards appointing one thousand other Outer Heads.

It says, “The bearer of this card is a genuine and au- thorized Outer Head of the Ordo Templi Orientis, so please treat him right” and is signed by Aleister Crowley or a skillful forger.) Grant’s version of the OTO lays heavy emphasis on anal vari- ations of sex magick and on dark hints about long-range political objectives known only to the inner circle, or perhaps known only to himself. He therefore seems deliberately to court the suspicions of professional conspiracy hunters—a trait he shares with his teacher, Mr. Crowley. Grant also seems to be the principle author of the interpretation, now widely shared in occult circles, that the superhuman being allegedly contacted by Aleister Crowley when he was Outer Head of the OTO was an extraterrestrial from Sirius ; Crowley himself always spoke of the entity only as a “being of prætor-human intelligence.” Grant informs us further that Yog Sothoth and the other interstellar beings or powers in the fiction of H.P.

(Radical Feminists such as Susan Brownmiller and Robin Morgan believe that there are no other kinds of men.) Our primitive ancestors, Fuller says, were conquered by wave after wave of these despotic-sociopathic Great Pirates, until all humans became accustomed to being ruled by Great Pirates, since the only other choice was to be murdered by them. The Great Pirates then discovered that other people were working at science, and hired the scientists to produce gadgets to suit their own needs. Therefore, Bucky says, science knows more about weaponry than about livingry.

Dick , America’s weirdest science-fiction writer. After 1973, Dick almost stopped writing science-fiction because he became too busy living in it, but he wrote thousands of pages of essays on his experiences in “orthogonal time” and other altered states, and “The Great Satanic Blasphemy” ranks high among them, and among Cosmic Conspiracy theories in general. This essay holds that we (you and me, all of us) are “pluri- forms” of God and thus gods ourselves: divine emanations “descended to this prison world, voluntarily losing our memory, identity and supernatural powers” but still capable of regaining them. This notion that “we shall be as gods,” Dick acknowledges, is condemned as the Original Sin by orthodox Christian theo- logy—the “sin of pride” for which we fell. Dick denies that we sinned or fell: We came here voluntarily to redeem this “prison world” and reunite it with the Divine. The “prison world,” also called the Black Iron Prison in some of Dick’s fiction, represents all that we consider reality. It is not real at all, and doesn’t exist in any sense; it is an enormous fake maintained by “the master magician, lord of the dark realm who poses as the creator.” This unreal world, or prison world, has no justice or sense or logic in it; hence, those who believe it is the only world either become atheists or embrace some kind of metaphysics that accepts the dark lord as the creator despite the horrors of the (alleged) creation.

Dick recognizes that something very similar to this model or narrative appears in Gnosticism and Taoism; it also appears in Aleister Crowley ; and Christian critics of New Age ideas indeed consider it a Great Satanic Blasphemy. Basically, the question such models raise is: Can we worship the God of this world, or must we posit a better world somewhere to find a God worthy of worship?

(That much is accepted by historians.) After many disagreements, Brassington says, Jef- ferson took a walk in the garden and returned with the Great Seal as we know it, the eagle on the obverse and the eye-on-the-pyr- amid on the reverse.

The Templars were especially devoted to the Merovingians , as others indicate, but according to Morning Sky, this is because the Mer- ovingians carried the sacred Magdelene genes, not because of her husband, Jesus, who was only a priest of the goddess religion. 220 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"All of this, however, is a small part of a much bigger picture, which involves interstellar war, the enslavement of humanity by certain extraterrestrials, and a hidden Order of Melchizedek, which is behind almost every other secret society you can think of.

Gulf War Syndrome Ever since the Gulf War, veterans have complained of a variety of related symptoms called Gulf War syndrome by the media, and the Pentagon steadfastly denied that the war had anything to do with the symptoms. In 1996, after 60 Minutes (CBS News) did a segment on the suffering vets, pressure from the public forced Congress to demand some clarification from the Depart- ment of Defense. The Pentagon then admitted that 20,000 U.S. servicemen “may” have been exposed to chemical weapons during the war, due to the destruction of a weapons bunker. Causes of similar symptoms in other soldiers, who were not in the area, remain unexplained, except for the vague notion of “post-traumatic stress syndrome.” Veterans’ groups continue to insist that some of the problems result from experimental vaccines given to the troops before sending them into battle.

Gurdjieff George I. Gurdjieff must rank as the most mysterious of all the leaders of esoteric groups in the 20th century, since there is no agreement as to when or where he was born and a great deal of his life is wrapped in legends, some of which he invented himself. Basically, the Gurdjieff “school” (as he called it) 1 aims to teach the student: 1. To become more self-aware, i.e., conscious of the role the self plays in creating impressions/perceptions (e.g., to change habitually from “that cheese smells awful” to “that cheese smells awful to me” and from “that music is terrible” to “that music seems terrible to me”), and 2. To break the habit of identification, Gurdjieff’s name for the un- conscious tendency to believe that ordinary human impressions/per- ceptions reveal objective reality. Learning to break down identific- ation and begin to perceive true reality requires long, hard work, according to the Gurdjieff teaching; most people who haven’t done “the work” (as the school exercises are called) simply live in a state of hypnosis or sleep-walking. (See Language as Conspiracy. ) Most mystics have said much the same, but Gurdjieff says it in the way most calculated to insult and humiliate ordinary people with ordinary opinions. (He called this “stepping on their corns.”) His major work, All and Everything , is a history of humanity, full of jokes, allegories, and obvious put-ons; it is told by an extrater- restrial named Beelzebub (a name of Satan in some traditions) and portrays humans as backward, deluded, and generally the same sorry lot called Yahoos by Swift. The school teaches through such 1 Other mystics have ashrams or lodges or orders, etc., but Gurdjieff had only “schools”; and where others had titles such as Guru or Master or Teacher, etc., Gurdjieff insisted on being called only Mr. Gurdjieff. 222 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"exercises as ritual movements, ritual nonmovements (freezes), ritual listening, etc. The first aspect of hidden reality perceived in Gurdjieff’s work is called “the horror of the situation,” in which the student dis- covers that humans are enslaved robots.

Bennett, a sometime disciple of Gurdjieff, All and Everything was rewritten several times to make it harder for most readers to understand. Gurdjieff said this process was necessary “to bury the dog deeper.” Bennett explains gnomically, “The dog is Sirius , the dog star, which stands for the spirit of wisdom in the Zoroastrian tradition.” Gurdjieff also taught about levels of consciousness above the human level, and surgeon Kenneth Walker, another sometime disciple, says these levels represent “angels and archangels” in some sense or “planets and stars” in another sense.

The Hearsts owned enormous woodlands and wanted the United States to use only wood-based paper, even though this wears out faster than hemp paper and produces massive pollution in its produc- tion; the du Ponts wanted us to wear clothes based on their new synthetics (nylon, Dacron, etc.) rather than the cheaper hemp. Together these two clans, and a few allies, launched a campaign to demonize the hemp plant; this continues to the present day. Industrial hemp, as the non-intoxicating, non-medicinal variety is called, is one of the most versatile agricultural crops. In France, where 2 million pounds of industrial hemp are harvested annu- ally, companies even use coated hemp to restore and build houses. Even in the United States, an estimated $25 million in sales of hemp products from abroad is a normal year’s gross; that’s $25 million lost to American farmers, forbidden to compete. Calvin Klein recently predicted that hemp would become the “fiber of choice” in the future, and many nutritionists urge legalization, because hemp has the highest concentration of amino acids in any food and is second only to soy in protein. Hemp produces a much higher yield per acre than cotton and requires virtually no pesticides.

The fact that virtually every recognized historian believes the Holocaust happened does not faze Butz; historians once believed in the Donation of Constantine, he points out, and we now know that was a forgery. Besides, Butz carefully never refers to the Holocaust as anything else but “the legend”: after pages of “the legend,” “the legend,” “the legend,” repeated over and over, one may begin to feel that one is indeed reading about some fairy tale. German documents referring to “the Final Solution” did not mean extermination, Butz asserts: They meant merely the transfer of Western European Jews to Eastern Europe. The confessions of major defendants at Nuremberg? Butz always puts quotes around the word “confessions”—and strongly suggests that they were obtained fraudulently. And the death camps were not reserved exclusively for Jews. They also contained, Butz notes, political prisoners, ordinary criminals, homosexuals, and conscientious objectors. Finally, the war destroyed so much that records of the death tolls in any part of the war are all largely guesswork. Maybe only 5 million Jews died and not 6...or maybe it was only one mil- lion.... And remember, they died of typhus. “Surely any thoughtful person must be skeptical,” Butz con- cludes one of his articles. Despite criticism from professional historians, heated contro- versy, acrimony, and a lot of anger from the Jewish community, Prof. Butz continues to hold his post at Northwestern University, and gallantly battles on to restore the good name of Adolph Hitler. 232 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"See also: American Hero , Creation Science, OM, World War II Deniers Reference: http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/~abutz Holy Blood, Holy Grail Holy Blood, Holy Grail is the only book about the Priory of Sion and the Church of Mary Magdalene mystery to have reached best- seller status, and it certainly does contain some of the most star- tling ideas of any of the literature on these subjects. The authors—Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln, and Richard Leigh—interviewed Gerard de Sede , the man who claims the Priory is made up of descendants of the Royal House of David who in- termarried with extraterrestrials from Sirius . De Sede also admit- ted, or certainly hinted strongly, that he did not write as an out- sider studying the Priory but as an initiated member engaged in a process of gradual revelation, which the Priory has orchestrated for several decades. For a true conspiriologist this raises the question: How about Baigent, Lincoln, and Leigh themselves? Shall we consider them outside the masque, studying it objectively, or inside feeding us the yarns the Priory wants us to believe? Whatever or whomever we suspect, when Baigent, Lincoln, and Leigh met Mr. de Sede, they discussed mostly another of his books, L’or de Rennes-le-Chateau (The Treasure of Rennes-le-Chateau) , which deals with the mysteries of the half-legendary Merovingian dynasty and with the strange Church of Mary Magdalene, in the town of Rennes-le-Chateau, built in the 1890s by the even stranger priest named Father B é ranger Sauni è re , who allegedly found a treasure after deciphering some old parchments in another church there.

Several versions of this yarn have circulated at various times, including the enigmatic verse in the Koran , where Jesus says, “They thought they crucified me, but I laughed at them.” An even more remarkable passage in some , not all, early manuscripts of Tacitus says Jesus led riots in Rome 40 years after his alleged death. Baigent, Lincoln, and Leigh eventually tracked down the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion—the same Pierre Plantard de Saint Clair whom Matthew Paoli discovered publishing Circuit , the journal of the seemingly non-existent Committee to Protect the Rights and Privileges of Low-Cost Housing out of the office of the Committee for Public Safety, which he shared with Andr é Malraux. Plantard spoke at length but mostly in riddles, as befits the Grandmaster of a secret society. As to the treasure of Rennes- le-Chateau, Plantard described it as “spiritual” rather than “ma- terial,” said it belonged to Israel, and promised it “would be re- turned to Israel at the proper time.” Holy Blood, Holy Grail also links the Priory—sometimes convin- cingly, sometimes weakly—with some interesting folks. Such as: 1. The Knights Templar , the chivalric order that had 123 members burned by the Inquisition between 1307 and 1314. (Templar teachings got passed on to all later anti-Papist secret societies, ac- cording to many theorists.) 2. The rituals of Freemasonry and especially the archetype of the Widow’s Son (all taken from the Knights Templar, according to Masonic historians) . 3. The Rosicrucians and the Illuminati . 234 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"4. Such worthies as Isaac Newton, Claude Debussy, and Jean Cocteau , all of whom allegedly served as Grandmasters of the Priory before Plantard de Saint Claire . The authors also document that Father Sauni è re belonged to one or more occult orders in Paris. All of these influenced Aleister Crowley and, through Crowley (or through P.B. Randolph), fur- ther influenced all modern magick orders that have both a Ma- sonic style of ritual and symbolism and a hidden Tantric ( sex magick ) teaching. Ultimately, Baigent, Lincoln, and Leigh present their own the- ory of what the Priory intends to reveal in slow stages. This theory holds that (a) Jesus married Mary Magdalene, (b) they had a child, the really important Widow’s Son of tradition, and (c) this child escaped to France after the crucifixion and became the progenitor of the Merovingian kings, and of various interesting people alive today who are related or allegedly related to the Merovingians. In short, Baigent, Lincoln, and Leigh offer us the oldest of all millennial legends: The True King will return soon, very soon, and cast out the usurpers. They even claim that this archetypal myth occurs in all European countries because the Priory planted it , to prepare us for the day when the seed of Jesus sits in judg- ment on all nations.

According to “ The Gemstone File ,” Irving ac- quired the courage to attempt this swindle because he was intim- ate with the international jet set and knew that Hughes was dead and therefore could not contradict him: He had no idea that a double of Hughes existed and would denounce him over the phone. After the death of Hughes (or the double) in 1976, leaving an estate of between two and three billion dollars, no apparent will was found at first. Then an alleged will, seemingly in Hughes’ handwriting, was found on a desk in the office of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons). With the will was a note saying that the document had been found near the home of Joseph Smith (founder and martyr of Mormonism). This led to considerable excitement and legal action for a time, but even- tually this, too, was judged a forgery.

Basically, Hughes, as the creator of TWA and an old-style entrepreneur, felt that Rockefeller was attempting to steal some- thing Hughes himself had made, something that belonged to him. We know that Hughes thought that because he spoke about it openly and vehemently, even accusing the Rockefeller interests of communism . (See John Birch Society . ) Rockefeller, typical of the stylistic difference between the two, did not have much to say. His lawyers, however, said that Hughes had mismanaged his own company, and poor old David Rockefeller and all the other stock-holders were being deprived of the better profits they would have earned under saner management. The first rumbles began back in the 1940s, when Hughes first found reason to believe the Rockefeller group was inciting the government to prosecute him on what seemed (to him) trivial technicalities. The real power struggle began in 1961. Hughes thought, as David Tinnin thought when he wrote Just About Everybody vs. Howard Hughes , that the problem began with an at- tempt to force Hughes to borrow money he did not wish to bor- row. The proposal offered Hughes involved Dillon, Read, and Company, the Metropolitan, Equitable and Prudential Insurance Companies, the Bank of America, and Chase Manhattan, who wanted to jointly give TWA $260 million in exchange for the usual high interest—and two out of three voting members in a trust, with Hughes reduced to a permanent minority of one vote. 240 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Hughes did not want the money, and he also did not want to become outvoted in control of the company he had built from almost nothing. He said no. John Sonnett, a top Wall Street lawyer, then filed an antitrust action against Hughes on behalf of TWA. Now, an antitrust action against the owner of a company, allegedly by the company, is rather unique, and Hughes thought it had no chance of succeed- ing. Yet Sonnett and associates were hard workers; they produced ledgers claiming that Hughes’ refusal to go into hock to Wall Street had cost his airline exactly $45,870,435.95. To Hughes and his lawyers, this seemed like Alice in Wonderland. They fought and they fought hard; and when the case arrived, finally, at the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice William O. Douglas, writing for the majority, found in Hughes’ favor. But that didn’t happen until 1973. In the 12 years of the battle, Hughes lost in every lower court, without exception: lost fighting a claim the Supreme Court found legally unsound. He also lost millions in legal expenses, and finally lost control of his airline. Hughes became convinced that this long legal struggle proved the Rockefellers and their Wall Street cronies controlled almost all the courts in the United States and, after further struggles with the Mafia over who was running Las Vegas, grew morbidly preoccupied with conspiracies and bacteria.

This model, labeled iatrogenesis (from iatro , medicine, and genesis , beginning), claims that by overdosing the modern world, doctors have in fact created as many illnesses as they ever cure—or have created even more illnesses than they cure, in the opinion of the most hostile critics. Philosopher Ivan Illich even accuses modern medicine of what he calls iatrogenocide , a Joycean word that signifies iatrogenic destruction of whole populations. Since AIDS patients are given astronomical amounts of medic- ations, many AIDS conspiracy theorists think that AIDS itself may be an iatrogenic condition. Some even trace the problem back to the foundations of modern medicine and claim the “germ theory of disease” is badly flawed, citing cases of people who have the “germ” but not the disease, and arguing that hostile or- ganisms alone cannot explain illness: The body must be weakened by other, environmental causes before it becomes unable to fight off disease. This position is often expressed in the mosquito metaphor: Mosquitoes “cause” malaria, but killing off the mosquitoes does not solve the problem, since every generation new mosquitoes appear with resistance to the old pesticides.

According to the Encyclopedia Britannica , the Illuminati managed to influence many Masonic lodges and gained “a commanding position” in the movement of “republican free thought,” i.e., anti-royalist and pro-democratic secularism. They attracted such literary men as Goethe and Herder, but the whole movement came to an end when the Illuminati were banned by the Bavarian government in 1785. Many conspiracy hunters following Abbe Barruel believe the Illuminati merely regrouped under other front names after 1785 and still continues to the present, although they often disagree as to whether the Illuminati is promoting republicanism, com- munism, anarchism, Satanism, international banking, or some combination thereof. See the links at the end of this entry. According to Masonic historian Albert G. Mackey, the Illu- minati was very popular and had at least 2,000 members in Ma- sonic 246 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"lodges in France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Hungary, and Italy. Mackey emphasizes that Baron Knigge, one of the most powerful and active members of the Illuminati, was a devout Christian and would not have worked so hard for the order if its aim had been, as Abbe Barruel and others claim, the abolition of Christianity. He concludes that it exercised no “favor- able” or “unfavorable” effect on the history of Freemasonry. On the other hand, Abbe Barruel linked the Illuminati positively to the Order of Assassins , the Knights Templar (condemned by the Inquisition for sorcery, sodomy, and heresy), and a worldwide Jewish plot.

In or about 1912, Reuss conferred the ninth degree of the Ordo Templi Orientis upon Aleister Crowley , claiming that Crowley already knew the occult secret of that degree.

In 1934 the Gestapo forcibly suppressed both the Order of the Illuminati and the Ordo Templi Orientis in Germany—along with all other Freemasonic orders and lodges, and schools of Esperanto to boot. The Ordo Templi Orientis survived elsewhere, but the Illuminati as an occult order only seems to exist in Switzerland at present.

He quotes Robison’s Proofs of a Conspiracy , which alleges 84 Illu- minati lodges in Germany alone and claims that French aristocrats such as Mirabeau and Orleans were also members; the more skeptical Vernon Stauffer, who in The Bavarian Illuminati in New England , accepts that Metternich, Herder, Goethe, and Banfly were members; and J.M.

Yallop, who had two previous books that did result in legal actions that justified him, claims that the P2 conspiracy as re- vealed in court trials and other books was only part of the total corruption in which the Vatican Bank was involved under the presidency of Paul “The Gorilla” Marcinkus . As Yallop tells it, when Licio Gelli formed P2 as a secret society within the Grand 252 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Orient Lodge of Egyptian Freemasonry , he immediately double- crossed his CIA employers and became a mole for the KGB, whom he also double-crossed. The crimes of P2, Yallop says, not only involved laundering drug money for the CIA and Mafia, as charged by Italian author- ities, but also gunrunning for various terrorist groups, plotting a fascist coup in Italy, assisting Nazi war criminals to get CIA employment in the death squads of various Latin American dic- tatorships, aiding fascist Juan Per ó n to regain the presidency of Argentina, and several murders, including those of Mino Pecorelli and Pope John Paul I. Pecorelli, an angry former member of P2, had began publishing a muckraking journal revealing P2 activities. One issue actually included a list of 100 Freemasons in the Vatican, many of them members of the Grand Loge Alpina . Pecorelli sent every issue of his journal to Pope John Paul I, who, as a result, ordered an in- vestigation of the Vatican Bank. The pope died almost immedi- ately, on September 28, 1978, allegedly of natural causes. Pecorelli was shot through the mouth on March 20, 1979—the sasso in bocca , traditional Mafia punishment for informers. Yallop claims both deaths were plotted by Licio Gelli, Roberto Calvi, Michele “The Shark” Sindona , and Marcinkus. As a sidelight, Yallop also tries to prove that various others, including Cardinal Cody of Chicago, might have been involved in the Pope’s alleged murder because John Paul I, who had lived among the poor most of his life, was talking as if he might reverse the Church’s long opposition to contraception.

Inslaw, the Institute for Law and Social Research, owned by William and Nancy Hamilton, had sold the U.S. Justice Depart- ment a new software program called PROMIS . From all accounts, PROMIS appears the most sophisticated and versatile system for spying on people that has ever been devised. The Hamiltons ex- pected to earn at least $5 billion from sales of PROMIS to law enforcement agencies, but instead, they found themselves paid nothing and engaged in a seemingly endless battle with the Justice Department, or persons within the Justice Department. There have been two court cases, both won by Inslaw and the Hamiltons, and one judge even said that the Justice Department had been guilty of “trickery, deceit, and fraud.” The Nunn Committee also investigated and found that the Justice Department had victimized the Hamiltons and intimidated witnesses. Finally, in 1994, a fed- eral court rejected the Hamilton’s claims. The whole Inslaw matter took on a new complexion when journalist Danny Casolaro began investigating it on his own and found a surprising number of mysterious deaths and unsolved murders among people involved in the feud.

A typical anti-IRS website informs us that the agency is not literally a part of the government: It is a private corporation, in- corporated in Delaware in 1933; it does not collect taxes—it col- lects “tribute” (that is, the money IRS extracts from us goes straight to the Federal Reserve Bank , which holds it as “credit of the United States Treasury,” i.e., interest on the National Debt). Nor is the Federal Reserve itself a government agency: It is private corporation owned by twelve families—one American and eleven foreign.

The Income Tax laws never bothered to make compliance mandatory; if you want the heat and/or the risk, you can stand on your right of non-compliance and tell them to figure out your taxes for themselves. And you don’t have to give them a scrap of paper to help them. Philip Marsh, author of The Compleat Patriot , could not find a law forcing cooperation with the IRS after eight years of searching. (It is only fair to warn the impressionable, that although this appears true de jure, it is not true de facto: Those heresiarchs who have tried this non-cooperation have had long legal struggles ending always in fines, imprisonment, or both. Of course, many are still appealing their cases.) The theory and practice of the IRS, according to the website below, causes 1,000 deaths per month in the United States, along with half the divorces and 75 percent of the bankruptcies. The major fury against our tax system stems, actually, from the uncanny resemblance between the taxman and the bandit, as ex- pressed over and over in libertarian literature but never more memorably than in the words of Massachusetts lawyer and indi- vidualist Lysander Spooner: The fact is that the government, like a highwayman, says to a man: “Your money, or your life ....” [But] the highwayman takes solely upon himself the responsib- ility, danger and crime of his own act.

It seems that Eire or Erin is the homeland of the Aryan or creative portion of humanity, but these facts were hidden since 1169 by a conspiracy between the British Royal Family and the Vatican, Ireland’s two major oppressors and exploiters. In the 12th century, the British first invaded Ireland, with the blessing of Pope Adrian IV, allegedly on a holy mission to Christianize the pagans. That much is accepted by all historians, although many find it hard to explain why the pope didn’t know that St. Patrick had Christianized Eire over 700 years earlier, in 432. According to McDari, the St. Patrick story is a pure myth, invented later to make the Christianization of the Aryans/Erinians seem older and longer established than it was. Both the pyramids and the Bible, when properly deciphered, reveal that the oldest and truest religion is sun worship. The de- coding of the pyramids is complex, but the Bible is easier, once you realize that Hebrew is a degenerate form of Gaelic. Just look for the Gaelic root of every Hebrew word, and the meaning be- comes clear. For instance, Jew, Jude, the slang Yid, etc., all come from the Irish Iudh, meaning light, i.e., the people who worship the sun. Hebrew, similarly, comes from Heber, Irish for the sun. This book, first published in 1923, has many eerie resemblances to Mein Kampf , also written about that time, but is free of anti- semitism; it reserves all its venom for Rome and England.

The six “ripper” murders had nothing random about them, Knight claims; all six women were at one time friends of an Irish Catholic girl who bore an out-of-wedlock child to the Duke of Clarence, Queen Victoria’s grandson. The child, although a bastard, stood in line for the throne, and the Freemasons, unable to find either mother or babe, killed off all the witnesses to the affair and made the deaths look like the work of a sadistic maniac. Others Masons in Scotland Yard helped in the cover-up. This was all motivated by fear of a Catholic reaching the English throne, which, according to Knight, Masons are sworn to prevent even at the risk of their lives. This thesis became the plot of a popular movie, Murder by De- cree , starring Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes. The film was unique not only in its portrait of a Masonic/royalist conspir- acy reaching the top levels of British government, but in actually showing secret Masonic grips and signs on screen. English author and criminologist Colin Wilson assured the present writer that this “solution” was defective in countless ways, and that one of the three alleged murderers had actually suffered a stroke and was bedridden at the time of his alleged participation in the plot.

Conspiriologists find Joachim interesting because he founded an order called the Illuminated Ones or Illuminati , which after a few centuries of voluntary poverty and piety suddenly, under the influence of one Fra Dolcino, turned violent, plundered the homes of the rich, preached general revolution, and were wiped out by an army led by the bishop of Vercueil in 1507. Joachim’s historical ideas later reappeared, slightly altered each time, in Giambattista Vico’s 18th-century theory of the Divine Age, based on poetic myth, the Heroic Age, based on militarism and conquest, and the Human Age, based on science and class warfare; and, later still, in Aleister Crowley ’s three ages of Isis the Mother, corresponding to primitive matriarchy, Osiris the Father, corresponding to civilization as we know it, and Horus the Son, corresponding to the New Aeon, which began when Crowley received “ Liber Al ” from Aiwass in 1904. But the most influential variation on Joachim’s historical cycle is the Hegelian- Marxist theory of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, which has formed the ideological foundation of every communist regime.

Two of the men he allegedly bragged to, Johnny Roselli, mob boss of Las Vegas, and Sam Gi- ancana, mob boss of Chicago, died almost immediately after being subpoenaed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations: Roselli disappeared but then was found, dead, floating in a barrel in the Gulf of Mexico, and Giancana was simply shot through the mouth, traditional Mafia punishment for suspected informers.

Both Lee Harvey Oswald and David Ferrie , a leading suspect in the Garrison investigation, were part-time employees of Marcello, and Jack Ruby was “in the family.” The House Select Committee concluded only that there had been a conspiracy, but their chief counsel, Professor Howard Blakey, openly told the press, “The mob did it.” See also: Martin Luther King Jr. Assassination, Mafia, MMAO, Murder of Marilyn Monroe Reference: http://www.clinton.net/~mewilley/jfk.html Robert Anton Wilson / 265"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"John F.

Conspiriologists emphasize that RFK was shot at a distance of no more than a few inches: Coroner Dr. Thomas Noguchi found powder burns around the wounds, only possible at “point blank” range. Sirhan Sirhan never got closer than about two feet from the senator. Worse yet, Sirhan was in front of RFK, and the bullets entered from the back. Many writers have tried to prove that Sirhan was in a trance at the time of the assassination. In this connection, it is well to recall the CIA’s MK-ULTRA program, which, in addition to ex- ploring other forms of mind control, investigated the feasibility of programming assassins who would not remember being pro- grammed.

Liberals and leftists detest him for his carpet bombings during the Indochina wars and the fact that he was born in Germany: Despite his Judaism, he seems like a neo-Nazi to them. And the John Birch Society, of course, has him high on their list of insidious Insiders : He is both a Bilderberger and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations . (And he has been a Director of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund...) Kissinger, born in 1923 in Fuerth, Germany, was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1943, served with Army Intelligence between then and 1946, earned a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1954, and entered the Robert Anton Wilson / 269"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"world of Power in 1957 when he became the Study Director of Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy for the Council on Foreign Relations. Since then his life has been divided between high government posts and prestigious university positions. As the most intellectual of the ruling Elite, Kissinger has ex- pressed boldly and sometimes persuasively the philosophy that probably guides all of them. A fairly balanced judgment of that philosophy is provided by Patrick J. Garrity: In his approach to diplomacy, Kissinger has sought to challenge and recast the traditional American approach to the world. He be- lieves [in] a more realistic, sober tradition...often referred to as realpolitik.... This tradition can be summed up in two ideas. First , raison d’etat, where the interests of the state justify whatever means are necessary to pursue them. The national interest thus replaced the medieval notion of a universal morality that guided all men and nations. The second key concept is the balance of power, an international order in which no nation is dominant. Each nation maintains its independence by aligning itself [with], or opposing, other nations according to its calculation of the imperatives of power . This is much like the philosophy of Max Stirner (author of The Ego and His Own )—except that Stirner applied this amorality to the individual and Kissinger reserves it for the State. (See also The Godfather . ) Because of this, pacifists and humanists tend to see Kissinger as a philosophical relative of Nazism, even though he fled Nazism in his youth; the mass bombings of civilian pop- ulations ordered by Kissinger certainly would rank as war crimes if his side lost. And this Machiavellian tradition reaches the di- mensions of Dr. Strangelove (who was based on Kissinger, accord- ing to rumor) in Kissinger’s 1957 book, Nuclear Weapons and For- eign Policy , in which he writes bluntly that “limited nuclear war is in 270 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"fact a strategy which will utilize our special skills to best advant- age” and that our “industrial potential” and “the broader range of our technology” almost guarantee an easy win if the U.S. government decides to drop nukes on people who vex it.

He not only regards Kissinger as a ringleader of the Anglo- American plot to destroy the Third World but as a “faggot” also (LaRouche prefers that word to Gay) and actually published a pamphlet titled “Kissinger: The Politics of Faggotry.” (He later backtracked a bit, saying Kissinger had “the personality of a faggot.”) LaRouche has also tied Dr. Kissinger to Satanism, by way of sinister links to Queen Elizabeth, Aldous Huxley, the drug culture, and “the Occult Bureau types in British Intelligence.” He also believes Kissinger was behind the plot that put him, La- Rouche, in prison for fraud and tax evasion.

Originally, they inhabited the temple of Solomon in Jerusalem and followed an oath to protect pilgrims visiting the Holy Land. Later, the Templars became money-lenders, and this led to their downfall, according to the most popular theory. Growing rich, they became objects of envy, and when they established castles in Europe, they became embroiled in politics as well as economics. In 1307, on Friday the 13th of October—a day regarded with superstition ever since—the Grandmaster of the Order, Jacques de Molay , was arrested by the Inquisition, along with 123 Knights. Under systematic and prolonged torture, they confessed to a series of charges that most historians regard as implaus- ible—blasphemy, heresy, spitting on the crucifix, black magic, worship of a devil called Baphomet, and forcing all members into homosexual orgies. In 1314, Jacques de Molay repudiated his confession, saying it had been obtained only to stop the endless torture. He also cursed the pope and the king of France, and oddly both died within the year, adding to the mystery and strange glamour of a Christian order condemned for Satanism. Very few historians believe the Templars were guilty.

A ladder conspiracy thus behaves much like a “real” conspiracy, even though the persons involved may not work together or even know each other. The earliest ladder conspiracies encountered by the author, in his childhood and adolescence, involved hoax phone calls. The most popular was probably “Prince Albert in the can.” In this game or nuisance, the victim is selected at random from the to- bacco stores in a phone book. The “conspirator” calls the desig- nated store and asks, “Do you have Prince Albert in the can?” (Prince Albert is a popular brand of pipe tobacco.) “Yes,” says the victim. “Well, let him out!” the joker shouts, and hangs up. If enough children (of all ages) try this on the same store, the owner will begin to feel like the victim of a real conspiracy.

The most radical sci- entific critics of language in our time include Count Alfred Korzybski and Dr. Richard Bandler. Korzybski, who grew up in a house where four languages were spoken (Polish, Russian, French, German) and learned English much later, observed that the words we use influence our percep- tions and conceptions of the world—e.g., even in the same lan- guage, a book may be called “realistic” by one reader and “por- nographic” by another, and each will tend to perceive/conceive the book that way more and more automatically if they repeat their label (“realistic” or “pornographic”) over and over. This underlies the mechanism of hypnosis, as Dr. Bandler discovered later. It also explains why you won’t make much progress preaching radical equality to somebody who continually uses the word “nigger,” or defending the first amendment to somebody who keeps saying “smut” (or “sexism”). 276 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"But Korzybski made a more radical discovery, namely, that our perceptions/conceptions (reality-tunnels) are also shaped by the structure of the language we use. A Native American, an Af- rican, a Chinese, etc.—anyone using a non-Indo-European lan- guage structure—will live in a different universe than those who only know Indo-European. Considering mathematics a language, Korzybski also claimed that the mathematically literate live in a different semantic system than those who only know verbal structures. From these starting points, Korzybski arrived at a devastating diagnosis of most of our culture’s habitual linguistic structures (which he called neurolinguistic structures because they act as the software with which our nervous systems, including our brains, process data). Our worst habit, he thought, lay in the constant assumption of identity implied in most uses of the verb “is.” Such sentences as “The photon is a wave,” “The photon is a particle,” “Beethoven is better than Mozart,” “The thing I saw was a spaceship,” would become, in Korzybski’s system, “The photon behaved like a wave when measured with this experiment- al apparatus,” “The photon behaved like a particle when meas- ured with this different apparatus,” “Beethoven seems better than Mozart to me,” “The thing I saw seemed like a spaceship to me.” English including “is” and its cognates (“was,” “be,” “will be,” etc.) appears as E in the writing of some of Korzybski’s students, and English without “is” and its cognates appears as E' (pro- nounced E-prime.) The present author has written two books in E-prime and finds it does tend to clarify, to de-dogmatize, and to make prose somewhat more scientific. Attempts to write the present book in E-prime quickly proved hopelessly baroque and created unread- able prose. You need the “is of identity” to describe conspiracy theories . Korzybski would say that proves that illusions, delusions, Robert Anton Wilson / 277"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"and “mental” illnesses require the “is” to perpetuate them. (He often said, “Isness is an illness.”) Korzybski also popularized the idea that most sentences, espe- cially the sentences that people quarrel over or even go to war over, do not rank as propositions in the logical sense, but belong in the category that Bertrand Russell called propositional func- tions. They do not have one meaning, as a proposition in logic should have; they have several meanings, like an algebraic func- tion. We do not notice this because Russell only discovered pro- positional functions in this century and the idea has not had wide publicity. According to Korzybski, many of our pet ideologies belong in the propositional function category (“This is an X,” “This has too much Y in it,” “Get away with that Z-ish Xism”), and we assume we can prove them or refute them, whereas neither we nor our opponents actually know what they mean. They don’t mean anything, until the multivalued X, Y, Z, etc. become concretely or operationally related to specific space-time events perceived, touched, smelled, or otherwise encountered by observers making reports. Propositional functions not recognized as such, or treated as propositions, Korzybski called “ noise ” (usually in italics). It seems odd to think that most human anger and violence derives from noise, but this also happens in other primate societies, does it not? Novelist William S. Burroughs, who studied general semantics with Korzybski, has developed these notions into the surrealist theme of language as an invading virus, found in most of his novels. This virus, according to Burroughs, creates our thoughts, feelings, and sense impressions. Without the virus metaphor, Korzybski would agree, and so would Dr. Richard Bandler. Dr. Bandler, out of the study of Korzybski and the verbal structures used by Dr. Milton Erickson (often considered the greatest hypnotist of his time), developed Neuro-Linguistic Pro- gramming (NLP), which shows how verbal structures create the world we 278 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"think we live in; NLP also has some amazingly efficient gimmicks for changing our verbal habits and seeing/experiencing a much saner and more manageable world.

While his distinctive conspiracy theory has evolved somewhat over the years, it remains constant in finding the British Royal Family the most, or one of the most, sinister forces in the galaxy. Under Queen Elizabeth II and British Intelligence (MI5 and MI6), an “Anglo-American cabal” rules the world and presently is engaged in a genocidal program to de-industrialize and de-populate Third World nations. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and George Bush are among the major co- conspirators in this fiendish scheme.

LaRouche is a high-tech advocate, with an agenda far different from others of that persuasion. He favors terraforming Venus to make it a second human habitation, but opposes space colonies in interplanetary space and has denounced the L5 Society (agitat- ors for space colonization) as a Gnostic cult. (“Gnostic” is a very nasty word in his vocabulary, and he also hates Aristotle and modern painting.) He urges the use of atomic bombs to create huge irrigation canals in the Middle East and sees multicultural- ism as a plot to destroy the benefits that Western science has brought to the world. And, like Ezra Pound , LaRouche believes that the major economic flaw in the present system is usury; en- emies accuse him of anti-semitism often, but nobody has quite proven that charge totally. It is only fair to note that LaRouche has charged in print that the present author is a member of the Illuminati .

Buckminster Fuller’s name for our current eco- nomic-political system: law yer-run cap italism. According to Fuller (a world-famous mathematician-designer), LAWCAP consists of people (some known, and some only traceable to numbered Swiss bank 280 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"accounts) who manage world finance, deciding what governments will be loaned money for which projects, and what governments or projects will not be financed. “Governments propose, LAWCAP disposes” summarizes this part of Fuller’s theory. But Fuller also holds that LAWCAP is based on a fundamental mathematical error, invented by Thomas Malthus (1766—1834), an economist employed by the British East India Company who allegedly “proved” that population increase will always exceed increase in known resources, thereby creating a struggle for life-support systems (food, shelter, etc.), which condemns the majority of people to misery and provides wealth and comfort only to the most cunning and predatory. On the contrary, says Fuller, post—18th-century technology continually accomplishes greater and greater “ephemeralization” or “doing more with less,” thereby increasing the energy yield of resources, and simultaneously discovering new resources, faster than Malthus thought possible. Thus, design science can not only feed the whole world with currently known resources, but it can actually give everybody an abundance. Furthermore, population does not increase steadily, as Malthus thought, but actually levels off when a society begins using comprehensive design science. In short, LAWCAP, according to Fuller, governs the world at present and does so very ineptly and clumsily, because it is based on scientific errors 200 years old.

Dr. Leary conducted extensive research on LSD and other psychedelics as a Harvard psychologist in the early 1960s, and always pointed out that among his subjects there were zero murders, zero suicides, and zero psychotic breaks. His convict rehabilitation project, using psychedelics, music, and mystic readings, rehabilitated more convicts than any similar experiment, almost exactly reversing the usual recidivism rate.

Most of these ideas seem more prac- tical and less utopian 20 years later, but in the 1980s Leary decided they were further in the future than he had estimated and turned his attention more to the immediate possibilities of cyberspace and the cyberpunk philosophy of using computers to break down the authoritarian structure of our society.

Lovecraft H(oward) P(hillips) Lovecraft (1890—1937) published mostly in pulp science-fiction and “horror” magazines in his lifetime and was almost unknown outside those circles when he died. His audience and his reputation has steadily grown since then, and he now ranks among the most widely read weird writers of any age; he has also inspired films, TV shows, and even computer games. H.P.L. (as he liked to sign his letters) led a solitary life, seldom leaving his hometown of Providence, Rhode Island, with one brief marriage, which lasted only months. Erudite (he began reading classic literature at the age of four) and deliberately cranky, he even preferred to keep his friends at a distance but wrote all of them long, encyclopedic letters showing a keen sense of humor hidden in his stories or appearing there only as misan- thropic irony. Lovecraft’s earliest works show the heavy influence of the moody tone of Edgar Allen Poe and the poetic whimsy of Lord Dunsany, but he later developed his own style, based on scientific literature, which, although often criticized as verbose, sets a mood of serious, almost pedantic scrupulosity, which leads the reader by very plausible steps to shockingly bizarre climaxes. His major stories, comprising what is called “the Cthulhu mythos,” revolve around the concept that we humans are very petty and puny creatures, surrounded in infinite space-time by entities far stronger and stranger—and totally unsympathetic to us. This unique body of work reflects both Lovecraft’s adult atheism and the “visions” of pagan gods he sometimes had as a bookish, lonely, and highly 286 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"imaginative child. In the Cthulhu mythos, godlike entities do exist—godlike compared to us—but they are only parts of a mindless universe, and they are more likely to eat us than to do us any favors.

The Neville Spearman edition (see below) explains how Lovecraft came to read a copy of the John Dee translation, which Lovecraft’s father had borrowed from the Grand Orient Lodge of Egyptian Freemasonry in Providence. Kenneth Grant , Outer Head of one branch of the Ordo Templi Orientis , claims that the Cthulhu “monsters” are allegorical figures representing the interstellar forces contacted by the “magick” (consciousness alteration) of Aleister Crowley ; Lovecraft could only picture them in images of horror because of his conservative and anti-mystical bias; Crowley embraced them as a source of trans-human illumination.

He almost immediately plunged the Vatican into its first major financial scandal of the 1970s, when it was revealed that the Mafia had printed $1 billion in counterfeit stock, at least some of which got deposited in the Vatican Bank; according to many investigators, all of it was intended for deposit there, but what happened to most of it still remains unknown. New York D.A. Frank Hogan, who prosecuted several local Mafiosi for this caper, attempted to extradite and prosecute Marcinkus also, but was blocked by White House intervention. ( Michele “The Shark” Sindona , one of Marcinkus’ colleagues in the P2 conspiracy , had contributed lavishly to Nixon’s campaign, and P2 probably had high-level protection as part of the CIA’s Gladio operation to control Italian politics.) Later, still under Marcinkus, the Vatican Bank became intim- ately involved with some of the “ghost banks” (virtual banks) and drug laundromats in the Sindona- Roberto Calvi loop. Mar- cinkus was listed as co-owner with Calvi of the Cisalpine Bank , a center of drug traffic according to Italian investigating magis- trates. When Banco Ambrosiano crashed and the whole P2 scandal made headlines day after day for more than two years, the Vatican stonewalled, but later they quietly removed Paul “The Gorilla” from their bank and made him mayor of Vatican City. Later still, they sent him away entirely, and he was last reported in semi- retirement in Cicero, Illinois.

Unlike Leary, who saw psychedelics as tools to prepare us for a sci-fi future of cyberspace, Outer Space, longevity, and higher intelligence, McKenna sees them as restoring the primitive in us—freeing us from the “Dominator Ego” characteristic of all civilized life.

MK-ULTRA The origins of MK-ULTRA go back to World War II, when the U.S. Army began researching barbiturates and marijuana as aids to interrogation. George Eastbrooks was a leading proponent of hypnosis as the key to interrogation and general mind manipula- tion of all sorts, and in 1971 he said he had used hypnosis to create multiple personalities for military intelligence purposes. (See Candy Jones . ) After the Korean War, the CIA began MK-ULTRA as a top secret effort to discover the best techniques, or combinations of techniques, to alter minds in any way desired. Hypnosis, drugs newer and more complex than barbs and pot, psycho-surgery, and various attempts at a “truth serum” were all extensively in- vestigated. One aim was to extract information from captured enemies; another, equally important, was to create agents with so many levels of mental control that they could not have inform- ation tortured out of them or even, in some cases, be aware that they were carrying secret information. Research moved on to include LSD, ketamine, psilocybin, and the implanting of electrodes in the brain.

According to a very scrupulous British journalist, Anthony Summers, the evidence does not support a murder verdict but does support a conspiracy. That is, Marilyn died either of an ac- cidental or deliberate overdose of barbiturates, but her death was covered up for hours, and her body driven around in an ambu- lance, which eventually returned the body to her home, so that federal agents could go through her house, removing all evidence of her affair with Kennedy. Summers also produces evidence that the Mafia, probably by authority of Sam Giancana (a suspect in many John F. Kennedy assassination theories, oddly), had planted a bug in the cottage where Marilyn and Bobby met to enjoy sweet dalliance. The cot- tage belonged to actor Peter Lawford, who appears to have acted as a virtual pimp for both Kennedy brothers, setting them up with many beautiful actresses. Ironically, Bobby learned of the bug because of another bug that the Justice Department had placed on Sam Giancana, so he broke off his affair with Marilyn before the mob had enough tape to blackmail him. This part of the story is particularly well documented, and should give pause to anyone who says that no conspiracies ever exist.

They held that the Earth was not only hollow but that we are living on the inside of it. This model derived from an American prophet of the last cen- tury named Cyrus Teed, who had a vision of the Great Goddess and was told by her that he would convert all the world because she would reveal to him the truth unknown to both Christian Fundamentalists and heathen scientists. The truth was that the universe consists of solid rock, we live inside its only cavity, and the lights we think of as stars and planets are the lights of other cities, also inside. Teed changed his name to Koresh (Hebrew for Cyrus), and his doctrine became known as Koreshanity.

Koreshanity had a brief success in America, then withered away to a small cult in Florida. But in Germany in the 1920s, a World War I veteran named Peter Bender became a convert and, as a pilot, was able to attract the attention of Hermann G ö ring, an old comrade from the Luftwaffe. Bender made the Koresh theory more appealing to Nazis by writing, “An infinite universe is a Jewish abstraction. A finite, rounded universe is a thoroughly Aryan conception.” The first attempt to prove the finite, rounded universe theory occurred in the city of Magdeburg, where engineers attempted to fire a rocket that would hit the other side of the hollow Earth. The rocket never got off the ground, but some of the technicians later worked on the V-2 program, which did manage to fire rockets but not at the other side of the Earth.

Moore argues that Nazism and American conservatism are both deeply rooted in the Illuminati conspiracy. According to Moore, (1) Nazism emerged from the Thule Society, a right-wing occult lodge in 1920s Germany, which was influenced by the Illuminati, and (2) Nazism has too many resemblances of right-wing movements in America for the parallels to be coincidental. Basically Moore’s theory holds that ever since the American and French revolutions, certain rightist groups have seen anarchy as the ultimate result of too much democracy and have tried to prevent this by forming secret societies devoted to State-worship and/or Christian Socialism, combined with a Gnostic mystique of receiving guidance from heavenly or otherworldly beings. This guidance produces the state called “Illumination” and causes the initiate to feel a deep need to fight for Good and against Evil; the problem is that Good and Evil are both defined in terms of the ideology of Authoritarianism, with all rebels against “proper authority” defined as devils incarnate. J. Edgar Hoover and Congressman Otto Passman are named as members of such occult lodges. Although Moore’s style is scrupulously academic and imper- sonal, the data of his study is arranged to indicate that most right- wing groups in America, especially those with anti-Illuminati conspiracy theories, are themselves unknowing dupes of the Illu- minati.

Nothing about him is certain, but the Cherokees did often adopt runaway slaves, and some say his parents were slaves. Others say his father was Moorish, his mother Cherokee. He may have left the Cherokees to join a gypsy band, and he possibly worked as a seaman and/or a carnival magician. He seems to have visited Egypt and possibly was initiated into High Magick in a Masonic-like ceremony in the Great Pyramid. After about 1912 things become a bit more specific. Now known as Noble Drew Ali, he founded a Temple of Moorish Science in Newark, based on a book called The Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America , which has very little in common with the orthodox Koran . Noble Drew’s doctrines included the belief that so-called Negroes or Blacks (now called African-Americans) are actually Asiatics, descended from the prophetess Ruth in the Old Testament, and that the Moors of North Africa and the Irish shared a common ancestry. (See Bob Quinn . ) He also claimed that Moors reached this continent long before any Europeans, an idea currently revived by novelist/poet Ishmael Reed. 318 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"Noble Drew also taught that most American Blacks were Moors but had forgotten their true identity; his favorite symbols, incid- entally, were the Masonic square-and-compass and the quasi- Masonic Eye in the Triangle (see Great Seal of the United States ). Some of his other teachings: “Aught is Allah” (see Book of Lies ) and “Be yourself and not somebody else.” The Moorish Science Temple gained converts, and eventually Noble Drew moved on to Chicago. A poster from May 16, 1927, announces that the prophet Noble Drew Ali will reveal “events in the last days” and then be bound with several yards of rope and escape before the eyes of the audience. The movement grew even faster, but Noble Drew Ali died under mysterious circum- stances the next year, perhaps as the result of a police beating. Some of his ideas live on in surviving Moorish Temples and, ad- apted slightly, in the Nation of Islam (Black Muslims). Recently, the “ Fortean Times ” examined the strange case of the Melungeons, a group of unknown racial stock in our southern states, who have been the subject of controversy for centuries because of their European features and dark skin. Local Indians never regarded them as “white” and said they came here before any white people. The FT finds the most plausible theory is that the Melungeons were of mixed Moorish, Turkish, and Portuguese ancestry. Perhaps they were also part of the gene pool of Noble Drew Ali, and family lore gave him some of his ideas. The FT also suggests that Abraham Lincoln may have had some Melungeon ancestry.

According to Allen (some Birchers disagree with him here), Adam Weishaupt and his Illuminati do not directly influence the current form of the One Big Conspiracy. Rather, the One Big Conspiracy—consisting of Insiders , not of Illuminati—was founded by statesman-financier-philosopher Cecil Rhodes (1853—1902) but based on the same tactics Weishaupt’s group had used a century earlier. Rhodes, an Englishman who made his fortune in South Africa, endowed 170 Rhodes scholarships at Oxford, but this was not disinterested charity according to Allen: The scholarships serve as recruiting “hooks” to find the personnel to manage an Anglo-American financial/political cabal that Rhodes devised with the intent of taking over the world. The chief agencies of the Rhodes conspiracy are identified as the Council on Foreign Relations in the U.S. and the Royal Institute of International Affairs in England; both groups seemingly have played a large role in guiding and advising the two major parties in both countries. Many Birchers feel that the Rhodes “Insiders” now have fairly well taken over, and the more extreme secession- ists and survivalists of the Far Right largely believe this: It explains why, although fiercely patriotic in their own way, they hate and fear the U.S. government.

Some evidence indicates that after Nosenko was accepted in Washington, Angleton had him interrogated and/or brain- washed with various drugs as part of the MK-ULTRA program. Those who believe Angleton played a pivotal role in the John F.

One of the major unresolved issues in the Nosenko case re- volves around the matter of Sasha , a possible Soviet mole said to be high in the upper ranks of the CIA. An earlier Soviet defect- or, Anatoli Golitsin , had claimed that Sasha really existed, but Nosenko denied this. Since Golitsin also claimed that the Soviet Union was planning to flood the CIA with fake defectors carrying disinformation, this conflict between Nosenko and Golitsin cre- ated much difference of opinion within the Agency and among conspiracy theorists ever since.

The CIA confirmed that Frank Olson had been one of the scientists given LSD. In 1975, Gerald Ford awarded the Olsons $750,000 and an apology.

The thing to do is sit back and enjoy it . Palmer also launched “the Shaver Mystery” (see Richard Shaver ) and either invented or first publicized the men in black .

Following a Darwinian metaphor, this model holds that “things which can’t successfully compete and reproduce themselves die out.” This applies to social systems as well as to individual organisms, the author holds, and even drugs and diseases only survive as long as no powerful force truly wishes to eliminate them. For instance, the author claims that heroin would not have survived as a social “problem” if the government had a true motive for wishing to eliminate it; as long as it remains largely a Black inner city prob- lem, the government passively allows it to continue while only pretending to “war” on it. Dr. Wilhelm Reich had a more disturbing model of passive conspiracy, holding that the masses neurotically yearn to sur- render to some fascist leader and will throw away their liberties as soon as a leader of that sort appears.

Professors Charles Beard and Harry Elmer Barnes, for instance, once ranked among the most prestigious historians in the U.S. (ca. 1920—40); but when they rejected our government’s official version of Pearl Harbor, they became known as nuts, cranks, dingbats, etc. and were eventually removed from curricula. Most young readers have probably never even heard of these once famous scholars. The case for conspiracy, which we present here but dare not endorse, runs as follows: Pearl Harbor was especially vulnerable. In 1932, in a Joint Army-Navy Exercise, Admiral Yarnell “attacked” Pearl Harbor with 152 planes and caught the defenders completely by surprise. In 1938, Admiral Ernest J. King led a carrier-based attack on Pearl Harbor with equal success. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the fleet transferred from the West Coast to Pearl Harbor, Admiral James O. Richardon protested vigorously and repeatedly. He eventually refused orders and was replaced by Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, who also protested but obeyed orders. In March 1941, when Roosevelt began the Lend-Lease pro- gram—providing weapons to one side in a war in which the U.S. was allegedly neutral—he violated international law and virtually invited the other side to retaliate. On July 22 that year, Admiral Richmond K.

In addition, Dutch, British, and Russian Intelligence all reported Japanese war plans to the U.S. government. On November 25, Secretary of War Henry Stimson wrote in his diary about a conversation with President Roosevelt: “The question was how we should maneuver them into the position of firing the first shot without too much danger to ourselves.... It was desirable to make sure that the Japanese be the ones to do this (the first shot) so that there should remain no doubt in any- one’s mind as to who were the aggressors.” A Navy Court of Inquiry from July 24 to September 27 ex- amined the possible negligence of Admiral Kimmel at Pearl Harbor.

Pound’s Cantos , the longest (824 pages) and most ambitious of all modern poems, sees history as a perpetual battle between in- dividual rights and the schemes of those possessed by avarice and power lust. The battle is seen as political in its early stages (thus, Mons of Jutland, a little-known figure, is praised highly for refusing to get involved in a religious war, saying other people’s opinions were not his concern), and the major heroes of the poem are Confucius, Lord Coke (who set permanent limits on the British monarchy), and Thomas Jefferson/ John Adams as the dialectical twins out of whom the best American traditions emerged. In its later stages, the battle becomes economic , as the greedy and power-mad erect “governments” outside government through international banking , which Pound calls the Age of Usury. Here the heroes are Adams again, Sen. Thomas Hart Benton , Andrew Jackson, an odd collection of Utopian money reformers, and, alas, Benito Mussolini. Certainly, no other poet ever attempted to write history on so large a scale or carried off most of it with such brilliant detail of imagery and sound. This poem, despite its conspiratorial weird- ness, has influenced almost all subsequent poetry, and at the end Pound repudiates the anti-semitism that disfigures the middle sections.

Robison’s thesis is simply that the Illuminati had infiltrated the Grand Orient Lodge of Egyptian Freemasonry and were trying to infiltrate other lodges as well; he wrote chiefly to warn other Freemasons of this plot. He claims that the Illuminati controlled 84 lodges in Germany, 8 in England, and lesser numbers throughout Europe and in the United States ( Proofs of a Conspiracy , p. 116).

When meeting people who believe in the Protocols and trying to tell them it has been proven a forgery, I have always heard the same counterargument: “Well, if it’s a forgery, how come so much of it has already come true?” Historians find three sources of the Protocols: (1) the anti- semitic legends of the Middle Ages, in which “The Jews” were accused of sacrificing Christian infants in their religious rituals, poisoning wells, and other barbarisms, (2) the revised conspiracy theory of Abbe Barruel , who originally found Freemasons behind the French revolution and later found “The Jews” behind the Freemasons, and (3) a satire called “Dialogues in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu,” by Maurice Joly, which portrayed Napoleon III and the French aristocracy in general as cold-blooded sociopaths intending nothing but harm to the masses. Although Joly’s targets were gentiles and he never mentioned the Jewish people, the “fiendish” (or hilarious) motives he attributes to the French government were picked up virtually verbatim in a novel called Biarritz by a German anti-semite, Hermann Goedsche, and transferred to a council of 12 rabbis who meet secretly—at mid- night in a cemetery —to plot the destruction of Christianity. In 1893—95, agents of the Russian secret police rewrote Joly and Goedsche into the Protocols of the Elders of Zion in the form we now know it.

In sum, just as modern Ireland has a Celtic bedrock overlaid with English language and genes, the original Celtic bedrock was overlaid on a Moorish foundation. Some of his evidence seems quite impressive, e.g.: • Type O blood is common in North Africa and West Ireland but rare on the European mainland . • Roman authors describe the Celts as tall and blonde, but most of the Irish are short and dark-haired . • West Irish music is unlike any other European music. When Quinn played some samples for European musicologists and asked where they thought it came from, all but one guessed Africa. The one who guessed otherwise said Asia . • Issa means “Jesus” in both Arabic and Irish Gaelic . • A Celtic cross found in County Kerry and carbon-dated at ca. 900 A.D. has the Arabic word Bism’illah (In the name of Allah) on it . • A type of dancing in which the body remains rigid and the feet move rapidly is common to North Africa, Celtic Spain, Breton France, and West Ireland . Quinn has reams of similar evidence and makes a persuasive, if not incontrovertible, case. He believes the Irish/Moorish con- nection was hidden by the Roman Catholic Church as part of a scheme to cover up the fact that St. Patrick never existed, and the earliest Irish Christians were Gnostics from North Africa.

An emotional split between Crowley and Regardie eventually drove them apart, but Regardie retained an affection for the old man, dedicated his first book to him, and eventually wrote the first objective or non-hostile bio- graphy of the controversial “Uncle Al,” whom the tabloids had called “the wickedest man in the world.” In 1937 Regardie performed the most shocking act of his life, publishing all the previously secret rituals and teachings of the Golden Dawn in four large volumes, because he had lost faith in the leaders of that society and believed the tradition might die out completely without such an “outrage” as his public disclosure. Although widely denounced at the time, this publication has won more praise than censure in recent decades. Occult historians Francis King and Isabel Sutherland typically attribute “the rebirth of occult magic” to Regardie’s policy of open disclosure. Francis Israel Regardie returned to the United States in 1937, where he continued writing on occult subjects under the name Israel Regardie and studied and later practiced psychotherapy under the name Francis Regardie. His major psychotherapeutic teachers were Drs. E. Clegg, J.L. Bendt, and Nandor Fodor, but he gradually developed his own system based chiefly on Carl Jung and Dr. Wilhelm Reich , two “opposite poles” of the neo- Freudian world, whom nobody else had ever tried to combine. One of Regardie’s pupils, Dr. Christopher Hyatt, also practices Jungian-Reichian therapy and publishes books on both the Golden Dawn and Crowleyan schools of magick.

He quickly became the most world-famous victim of the FDA’s quest to impose One True Faith on medical practice in the United States, because the Feds not only destroyed all the equipment in Dr. Reich’s experimental laboratory but burned all his books, too, in an incinerator, and then they put him in jail where he died of a heart attack.

Prouty says he learned of this from Lt. Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, the President’s son, whom he had met earlier, in Tehran in 1943, and who later interviewed Stalin for Look magazine in 1946. During the Look interview, Stalin said he had stopped trusting Eleanor Roosevelt when she refused to allow Soviet ambassador Andrey Gromyko to examine the dead president’s body to check that FDR had indeed died of cerebral hemorrhage as claimed. When this request was denied, Stalin decided Eleanor was part of the cover-up. Prouty does not inform us of what Elliott Roosevelt thought of this, but he does go on to say that Elliott bluntly asked Stalin what Gromyko hoped to learn from the corpse.

Usually, they claimed either Eleanor or Stalin had killed him.

According to one Rosicrucian manifesto now online, the Rosicrucians “hide in the open” by creating “as many false orders as possible” to confuse their enemies, identified only as the Technomancers. The Rosicrucians, this manifesto says, are “the secret masters of several Masonic groups and a lot of different secret societies.” The Technomancers, meanwhile, secretly attempt to infiltrate and subvert these groups.

Through the charity trusts they control through different Masonic groups, they can put pressure on banks and invest money as they wish .

Nervous people seek scapegoats to blame, his theory says, and we have a lot of nervous people in America since downsizing has broken up the home and sent both parents out into the workforce. The stimuli that trigger Satanic panic and wild rumors of hu- man sacrifice, etc., can be almost anything, but major sources of the new mythos are school textbooks, which may contain ideas the parents never heard of before, rock, which doesn’t sound like music at all to many older persons, and role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons, which encourage those intellectual/ creative functions the parents had to suppress in themselves to adjust to the hierarchical social structure.

When deciphered as a form of English Cabala they reveal that “the Fully Illuminated” have interacted with the UFO phe- nomenon throughout history. The UFO phenomenon itself is defined in Jungian terms: “... The phenomena themselves are inherently intangible, but are able to impinge on our reality in a phenomenological way because they are archetypal .” That is, in the sense of Jungian psychology, “myths,” if arche- typal (rooted in the depths of the mass unconscious), have the power to shape events and change history. The word “myth” is used here not as a synonym for lie or falsity but as a different order of communication from daily language, as poetry and al- legory are also different. Jung himself expressed much the same view in a 1952 book called Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky . Greenfield goes further than Jung (who didn’t know about the Illuminati): “The Fully Illuminated are in control of reality to the extent that the mythos itself is in control.

The victims, of course, had the names Louis Saint-Maxent, Gaston de Koker, and Pierre Feugere. Le Serpent Rouge means “the red serpent”. This symbolizes male sexual energy in many occult traditions and relates to the Hindu kundalini theory of induced brain change by sexual/yogic stress. The book seems to hint obscurely at some sort of astrological sexual mysticism, but it also insists, again and again, that only Mary Magdalene fully received the Divine Transmission that came through Jesus. Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln, and Richard Leigh interpret it to suggest that Mary Magdalene was married to Jesus. They also point out that most of the privately printed books about the Magdalene/ Priory of Sion mystery have false names for the authors, but whether this was the case with the unfortunate Saint-Maxent, de Koker, and Feugere remains uncer- tain.

Although a jealously guarded secret for many centuries, allegedly because the powers unleashed are too dangerous to be revealed to all, the technique is simple enough to be revealed in a single sentence: Orgasm should be avoided for as long as possible, by always slowing down or altering posi- tion when it seems imminent, and each partner should visual- ize/idealize the other as some specially meaningful divinity—e.g., in Thelemic magick the male usually identifies the female with Nuit, the sky goddess, and the female usually identifies the male with Pan. The only problem with this simple description is that you need considerable training in very advanced yoga before you can begin to even approximate the desired result. If you don’t see the “as- tral” light or some sort of blue-white energy fields, you need more practice.

In fact, since more people know Shakespeare’s dramatized histories than any purely factual historical works, he may be the fountainhead of conspiriology. Some have proposed that the Bard’s view of power and the men who wield it derives mostly from Machiavelli. In Julius Caesar , Brutus and Cassius (with fellow miscreants) plot and carry out the assassination of Caesar and attempt a coup d’etat, which is prevented by the demagoguery of Mark Antony, who forms an opposing conspiracy. In another Roman play, Titus Andronicus , all the characters are involved in conspiracies and counterconspiracies; lies, murders, rape, mutilation, and canni- balism are among the tactics in this struggle. In the chronological English histories, we have several genera- tions of conspiracy and double-dealing. King John depicts a lying and conniving king who inspires several conspiracies to unseat him and is finally poisoned by a monk who comes pretending friendship. In Richard II , Richard exiles Bolingbroke, who imme- diately hatches a conspiracy to return and seize power, with the help of other nobles who dislike Richard. At the climax, Boling- broke pays for the murder of Richard and makes himself Henry IV. In Henry IV, Parts I and II , a series of conspiracies, angered by the “indirect crooked ways” Bolingbroke acquired the throne, unsuccessfully attempt to overthrow him. In Henry V , the heir of Bolingbroke conspires to justify a war against France, to “busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels” and prevent further internal dissent—a technique still widely used and even more widely suspected. (See “ American Hero ”. ) In Henry VI, Parts I, II, and III , every noble in England seems to get drawn into one conspiracy after another against Henry VI (“holy Harry”), who shows more talent for religious piety than for hardball politics, and the Yorks and Lancasters murder each other in a rising crescendo of horror.

In the other histories, Macbeth conspires to murder his way to the throne of Scotland, and Macduff conspires to unseat the tyrant; Hamlet is a labyrinth of deceit and illusion (“Seeming, seeming!” the baffled hero cries at one point), and the sensitive reader is as unsure as Hamlet is about who is most guilty; and in King Lear , both the aged Celtic king and, in the subplot, the Duke of Gloucester are both betrayed by members of their own families. In Othello , Iago of Venice weaves a web of slander that deceives almost everybody on stage at one point or another, and Othello murders his wife because of this network of lies. Even in the comedies this theme appears frequently. In The Tempest , Prospero and his daughter Miranda are on their desert island because of a conspiracy that deprived him of his dukedom, and in Measure for Measure , the puritan Angelo, entranced by one woman, loses all his morality and sets in motion a conspiracy to force her to his bed, but another conspiracy, untypically benevol- ent, is watching from above and intervenes to set matters right.

For instance, “A” always signifies animals, and thus appears in animal itself, animate, avian, aard- vark, etc.; “T” means integration and hence appears in Christian art as the cross, and in words like totality, tonality, triumph, etc. “D” always signifies death, decay, and destruction; hence its prominent position in those words (but what is it doing in deity, divinity, delightful, etc.?). The author of the letter, Richard Shaver (1908—1975), encour- aged by Palmer, soon turned out a “novel” or a channeled com- munication from one of Shaver’s past lives. Rewritten by Palmer, this epic, entitled “I Remember Lemuria!” appeared in the March 1945 issue of Amazing Stories and immediately sold out. The “Shaver Mystery,” as Shaver’s revelations came to be called, quickly became the hottest property in the pulp magazine world and had around a million believers by the mid—1950s. The Shaver stories or revelations were based on Shaver’s “racial memories” of a time 12,000 years ago when Titans living thou- sands of years and standing 300 feet tall lived on Earth, having come from a distant planet. A solar disaster forced them to move inside the hollow Earth, where some of them still remain. Others returned to the surface prematurely and became the stunted, short-lived humanity we know. Those who stayed in the caves evolved into deros (bad dwarfs) and teros (good dwarfs). The deros, who take up more space in Shaver’s writings than the teros, are not only evil but have superscientific machines that cause people to hallucinate, go mad, kill, or just burst into flames inexplicably (the “spontaneous human combustion” documented 384 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"by Charles Fort ). Dero mind machines controlled Hitler and the Nazi Party (see Nazi Hell Creatures ), burst the blood vessel that killed Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hypnotized Lee Harvey Oswald into shooting John F. Kennedy, and even supervised the crucifix- ion of Jesus. When not engaged in such devilish anti-human activities, the deros enjoy themselves with “stim machines” that allow them endless sexual debauchery “that actually deforms their bodies in horrible ways almost beyond mentioning.” Shaver’s stories are full of scenes of sexual horror and torture, performed by the deros upon women who all look, in the illustra- tions provided by Palmer’s artists, as sensually lovely as the later Playmates of the Month, but are screaming in pain rather than flirting with the reader. Between new revelations about dero deviltry and these sado-porn illustrations, the Shaver Mystery probably gave sexual nightmares to as many people in the 1950s as recovered memory therapy has in the 1980s—90s. Shaver said he “heard voices” most of his life, usually a symptom of schizophrenia, but he believed his voices were the ancient Titans using him as a medium to awaken humanity to the dero peril beneath our feet. Some critics of the Shaver saga deny that he or Palmer believed any of their yarns or that Shaver even heard voices from the giants of the Dawn Age. The Shaver Mystery, in many histories of sci- ence-fiction, is called the Shaver Hoax. The deros would want it that way, wouldn’t they?

The captain, in fact, said that he himself had pretended to be Jewish to enter the inner cabal of the conspiracy, and that the evil master- minds of Judaism were easily deceived by him and told him all their secrets. According to Simonini, the Jews had infiltrated the Catholic Church by pretending to be Catholics; in Italy alone, he said, there were over 800 Jewish priests, including bishops and cardinals. They planned to take over the whole world within a hundred years (i.e., by around 1906), and then they would turn all Christian churches into synagogues and reduce the remaining Christians “to a state of absolute slavery.” After these shocking revelations, Barruel’s conspiracy theory always featured the Jewish conspiracy as the center or puppet- master of all the secret societies he feared.

Most attempts to interpret this invoke Cabala, the Jewish system in which every letter has a number value (e.g., “A” or aleph = 1, “B” or beth = 2, etc.). Fortunately for those who like to play games, many Hebrew letters have more than one numerical value, de- pending on where they appear in a word, and letters in other languages do not all correspond to Hebrew letters (e.g., “V,” “W,” and even “O” have all been interpreted as corresponding to the Hebrew vauf ).

The computers, scanning for patterns, found a few: Such reports tend to cluster around earthquake fault lines; there is some peaking before earthquakes; and a certain topology appears in the wider and better documented cases. For instance, those at a distance report only strange lights, or light moving strangely; those closer in report poltergeist effects (as in Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind ): electrical and electronic mal- functions, machinery turning itself on and off, jumping furniture, etc.; those who blunder into the center of the phenomenon come back with strange yarns full of Freudian and/or Jungian dream symbolism (sexual assaults, abductions, encounters with Jesus or “beings of light,” rebirth experiences, etc.).

After the foundations of geology and related sciences de- veloped, the hollow Earth gave way to a solid Earth, at least among the majority of the educated, but a colorful minority con- tinues to devise ingenious new variations on the old hollow Earth model. Captain John Cleves Symmes, a military hero in the War of 1812, created such cunning arguments for this theory that Congress was actually persuaded to send an expedition to the South Pole to find the hole that must exist there (according to Symmes’ calculations) and then sail inward to find the new lands for colonization that he theorized. Due to malnutrition and mutiny, the expedition fell apart halfway, and no later govern- ment was willing to finance more research on Symmes’ idea, which scientists continually ridiculed. Many 19th-century occultists, however, took up the idea, and Madame H.P. Blavatsky made the hollow Earth a central part of her revelations (written under the influence of hashish), which became the basis of the Theosophical Society, still a large organ- ization and much admired by Gandhi (who did not, however, say anything pro or con about the hollow Earth theory). William Butler Yeats, probably Ireland’s greatest poet and a Nobel laur- eate, believed all of Blavatsky’s visions, including the hollow Earth.

Some defenders of the Warren Commission say they were held four days, positively identified, and released because there was no evidence against them.

In fact, the police never would have stumbled upon the famous Three Tramps if not alerted by Lee Bowers Jr ., who saw them hiding on a freight train. The photo of the latter Three Tramps is the source of the con- tinuing dispute, because one of them looks a good deal like E. Howard Hunt of the CIA.

Tucker Benjamin R. Tucker (1854—1939) is generally considered the most plausible expositor of individualist-anarchism and continues to influence both the anarchist and libertarian movements. Robert Anton Wilson / 403"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"Born of Abner Tucker, a Quaker and owner of whaling ships, and Caroline Cummings, a Unitarian admirer of Tom Paine, Benjamin grew up amid lively intellectual conversation. After attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology (which he entered at 16), he decided to devote his life, not to engineering, but to publishing and political agitation. Major influences were Josiah Warren, America’s earliest anarchist, Lysander Spooner , P.J. Proundon, founder of mutualist-anarchism, and Max Stirner, atheist and egotist. Tucker’s brand of individualism is thus based on rational appeals to the intellect (long-range pragmatism: also called enlightened self-interest) and rejects all supernatural morality. Benjamin Tucker’s basic analysis of modern capitalism hovers somewhere between scientific objectivity and conspiracy the- ory—just like the analysis of Karl Marx, Tucker’s opposite in al- most everything else. Beginning, like Marx, from Adam Smith, Tucker agrees with Smith’s axiom that labor is the source of all value; like Marx, he then asks why the worker does not receive all the value he or she creates. Unlike Marx, however, Tucker does not attribute this to the private ownership of the means of production but to four mechanisms that he calls four types of usury. The first and most nefarious variety of usury, Tucker says, consists of a monopoly on the issue of currency held by certain banks; in the United States today that monopoly is held by the Federal Reserve Bank . This dominance of currency allows the major bank of issue, and all banks subordinate to it, to charge interest on every dollar that goes into circulation (and accounts for our staggering $6 trillion national debt, modern Tuckerists say). The second form of usury, Tucker has it, lies in monopoly of the land, by lords-of-the-land (the king’s relatives) and, nowadays, by landlords (not necessarily related to the king). This underlies rent and mortgages. The third and fourth forms of usury are tariffs, which prevent 404 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"free competition on a worldwide basis, and patents, which allow inventors (or often those who employ the inventors) to prevent others from producing a cheaper form of a monopolized product. All four of these practices, Tucker claimed, interfere with the free market and thus are inconsistent with capitalist theory. In other words, he charges that capitalists do not, in fact, practice capitalism. Thus, Tucker believed that all economic misery derives from monopolies that block competition and that when the four kinds of usury are removed from our current system, free enterprise will produce all the good effects expected by Adam Smith. The fact that these special privileges enrich a minority at the expense of the majority is never explicitly attributed to conspiracy by Tucker (he more often blames ignorance), but his followers, like Marx’s, often write as if the rich consciously plot to exploit the rest of us. In either case, Tucker opposed violent revolution and believed in the achievement of his goals by education: When all are rational egotists, none will submit to exploitation, and by passive resistance they will starve out the State and the monopol- ists.

Beginning with the July 7, 1947, ABC news bulletin announcing that a “flying disk” had crashed near Roswell, the CD then intro- duces Bill Brazel, son of Mack Brazel, the rancher who found the major debris. Bill says it was strange material—it felt like balsa wood but couldn’t be cut, and was unlike anything that he had seen. Neighbor Loretta Procter next tells of being shown some odd debris by Mack Brazel and suggesting that he take it to Sheriff Wilcox. Reporter Frank Joyce tells of seeing the debris, too. Major Jesse Marcel tells of going to the site and seeing debris, without any comments on its oddity. Jesse Marcel Jr., the major’s son, says his father showed it to the whole family, and they all agreed it was unlike anything they’d ever seen. Employees of a local radio station tell of trying to file a story on the debris and being stopped by the FBI. Reporter Frank Joyce returns to tell how Mack Brazel—the rancher who first found the debris, remem- ber?—changed his story after being held by the air force for sev- eral days. Several air force men, retired, tell of crating material and sending it to various places—Dayton, Fort Worth, Denver—a most confusing part of the story. Then the most challenging story of all: Col. Thomas Dubose confesses to removing some of the debris, under orders, and replacing it with balloon debris. Other air force personnel talk of seeing odd debris, as does a local mortician, who was asked to supply two small coffins. The wife and daughter of a pilot named Henderson say he told them of seeing “small people” with “slanted eyes.” Major Marcel and his son reappear to assure us the debris was not part of a balloon and they don’t know what it was.

Although that face survives, another whole planet was destroyed in the battle between God and Satan; its remains make up the asteroid belt, which is the model for all the crop circles . Supporting opinions are quoted from one Dr. Pierre Guerrin (“UFO behavior is more akin to magic than to physics as we know it”) and offbeat UFOlogist John Keel (“The UFO manifestations seem to be, by and large, merely minor variations of the age-old demonological phenomenon”).

Somewhere, Calvi either shortchanged the Mob, or accidentally caused them to suspect that he had done so, and the Mob ordered a contract on him. Hanging him where the rising tide covered his dead body—a traditional punishment for Freemasons who have betrayed their vows—was intended to point suspicion at Calvi’s Masonic col- leagues and away from the Mafia.

Aside from showing that the CIA is not bound by ordinary laws or ordinary morals, i.e., that it acts like any other intelligence agency in the world, Veil emphasizes in particular that the attempts to govern the Agency via the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence failed totally because Casey simply lied to the senators about his wars and warlike activities in Latin America, none of which Congress had authorized and some of which they had forbidden. The chairman of the committee, Senator Barry Goldwater, finally grew so angry, when the extent of Casey’s deceits was discovered, that he wrote Casey a blunt letter stating in undiplomatic language that he was “pissed off.” Senator Goldwater was also annoyed at the CIA’s unauthorized mining of harbors in Nicaragua, which he called “the dumbest fucking idea I ever heard of.” And he was even more irate that the electronic bugs found in his office at least twice could not definitely be traced to either the KGB or the CIA.

Nearby is a supermarket where you can buy cigarettes, containing nicotine, a drug more addictive than heroin, according to former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Next door is a BAR where you can buy dozens of varieties of C 2 H 3 OH, a heavily addictive nar- cotic statistically linked to wife and child battering, divorce, and violent crime.

In his teens he concentrated mostly on painting and writing, but when this didn’t earn much, he boldly walked into the Gate Threatre in Dublin, Ireland, at the age of 16, and an- nounced that he was a Broadway actor of huge success, age 22, and eager to study Irish acting methods. The managers of the Gate (actor-director Michael MacLiammor and actor-producer Hilton Edwards) were so impressed that they hired him at once. Or so Orson always told the story. According to MacLiammor, he and Edwards knew at once that Orson was a fake, but they recognized a real theatrical flair and decided to give him a chance. Before he was 20, Orson had returned to the United States and had a busy career adapting, directing, and acting in classics on the New York stage and writing, directing, and acting for radio. His passionate devotion to his related profession, stage magic, influenced his attitude toward all these other arts, and hence he remains the most controversial theatrical innovator of our century. Audiences seem to either love his odd mixtures of drama and magic or else they find the magic element so unreal as to make him seem more showman than artist. On October 31, 1938, Orson directed a radio production of H.G. Wells’ War of the Worlds , in the form of a documentary. He dis- covered at once that a large segment of the American public had no training in critical thinking and would accept anything “doc- umentary” as real: he provoked mass panic and became the most famous radio star in history. This led to his lifelong fascination with mixing documentary elements into his work, and this, to- gether with the magic element, made him a huge success on the stage and in Europe, but his movies all suffered mixed reviews and small audiences.

Twelve years after his death, Orson Welles seems the model of the post- modern artist, and his works, endlessly ambiguous and ironic, have the dark flavor of conspiracy theories mixed with detached self-satire.

Later, conspiriologist A.J. Weberman presented evidence that Nixon used the code phrase “the Bay of Pigs thing” when he wanted to refer to the John F. Kennedy assassinatio n. According to conspiriologist Paul Kangas, this was confirmed by John Ehr- lichman, another Watergate conspirator, who admitted Nixon did indeed use the code phrase “Bay of Pigs” to refer to the John F. Kennedy assassination. It is far from clear how a full investigation of the Watergate burglary would open the John F. Kennedy assassination again, and this remains an unsolved mystery. Nonetheless CIA officer E. Howard Hunt was involved in Watergate, and many research- ers believe he was also involved in the Kennedy hit. 424 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"On or about November 30, 1973, Hunt began to ask the White House for money, saying he had information that would “blow the White House out of the water” and “impeach the President.” Many conspiracy buffs believe Hunt was one of the Three Tramps arrested on the grassy knoll immediately after the Kennedy assas- sination and then quickly released. Nixon agreed to pay Hunt $1 million in return for silence.

Some say that wicca, as a goddess-centered religion, was passed on within certain families all through “the burning time” (the Holy Inquisition) and only now feels secure in resurfacing openly. Others say modern wicca was partly re- created out of old books, and partly invented, by an English ec- centric named Gerald Gardner, with some help from Aleister Crowley . Still others admit that Gardner played a large role in re-creating the wiccan tradition, but don’t care to admit his asso- ciation with Crowley. Witches, like Freemasons, call their rites “the Craft” and use the archaic Masonic expression “So mote it be” in concluding many rites. This may be explained, perhaps, by the fact that Gardner and Crowley were both Masons.

Dancing is part of the ritual in all covens; getting drunk or stoned only in some, mostly Californian covens. The rites all celebrate the seasons, the Moon, and the Great Mother Goddess. Many wiccans are extremely litigious and will quickly start legal action against any Fundamentalist who claims that they are really a Satanic cult and engage in human sacrifice. At present, some Fundamentalists still say that, and the wiccans are still quick to sue.

And King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. He was a widow’s son out of the tribe of Naph-ta-li and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to King Solomon and wrought his works . In Masonic lore, Hiram was killed by three sinister figures with the symbolic names Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum.

In 1982, the Dade County district attorney attempted to prove that at least seven officers of the World Finance Corporation were present or former CIA “assets” and that they engaged knowingly in laundering cocaine money. The D.A. also charged that the CIA was deliberately blocking and sabotaging his investigation; nonetheless, he proved that not only drug money but drugs themselves frequently passed through the WFC, which went bankrupt while three officers stood trial. Many other banks, in- cluding the respected Chase Manhattan, were part of the laundro- mat, but it could not be shown that all of them knew or even suspected that they were in the dope business.

Although, like most 20th-century anti-Illuminists, Webster sees this order as the main promoter of the French Revolution (they took over the Grand Orient Lodge of Egyptian Freemasonry , the largest Masonic brotherhood in France, which included and influenced nobles, merchants, and even workers), she also shares the common view that they created communism, socialism, anarchism, and radical- ism in general. But, uniquely, she tries to prove that all this is secondary to their real purpose. The Illuminati, she claims, was taken over very early in its career by the Prussian nobility and the German intelligence service, and Illuminati lodges spread left-wing ideas only to weaken other countries and make them easier for Germany to conquer. In short, where most others in this area of speculation see the Illuminati as an atheist plot or a Jewish plot, she sees it as basically a German plot. Webster also tries to prove that the revived Illuminati founded in Dresden in the 1880s was as powerful as the original Illuminati of Weishaupt and played a major role in the history of socialism and communism. (See Illuminati Copies or Revivals . ) A classic example of her ability to find real links to hang her theories on is her question, “Was it...a mere coincidence that in July 1899 an International Socialist Congress decided that May 1, the day on which Weishaupt founded the Illuminati, should be chosen for an annual International Labour demonstration?” (p. 245).

Donald Holmes argues in The Illuminati Conspiracy: The Sapiens System that the Illuminati —regarded by him as superior intelli- gences, perhaps from outer space—control the governments and media of this planet. World War II, the most terrifying example to date of how much harm humans can do to one another, never happened: By special effects, stage magic tricks, fake journalism, etc., the Illuminati made it appear to happen so that we would become so frightened of our destructive powers that we would establish a happier, more gentle society all over the planet. (They are, evidently, still working on that project.) Similarly, in Illuminati Lady , a privately published poem by Kerry Thornley , it is proposed that World War II was faked by incarnate Illuminati, led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, in collaboration with discarnate Illuminati, led by Madame H.P. Blavatsky (the Illuminati Lady of the title). The purpose, again, was to frighten us into becoming pacifists.

The Yankees in Oglesby’s model are a brotherhood of wealthy old New England/New York families (the Insiders in John Birch Society theory) who have relatively “liberal” and “international- ist” values (except when this interferes with profits) and owned almost everything in the United States until fairly recently. The Cowboys represent new Western wealth, owning more than the Yankees like, and holding views that run the gamut from conser- vative to reactionary to neo-fascist; they suspect the Yankees of plotting against them, of ruining free enterprise by establishing government-backed monopolies, and of amoral willingness to cooperate with communism and other alien ideologies when this advances their interests. 430 / Everything is Under Control"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"David Rockefeller represents the archetypal Yankee and Howard Hughes the archetypal Cowboy; the legal and financial battles between Rockefeller and Hughes over control of Trans World Airlines represents an open, less clandestine side of the Yankee-Cowboy conflict, and is treated in great detail; this epic, although well documented, almost reads like a satire by Ben Jonson or Jonathan Swift, especially in Oglesby’s cool treatment of Hughes’ growing suspicion that the Rockefellers owned all the courts. The more controversial parts of the book attempt to revise the standard conspiratorial views of the John F. Kennedy assassination and Watergate, arguing that the Cowboys were ultimately behind the killing of Kennedy (whatever the role of the Mafia and CIA as agents) and the Yankees manipulated Watergate to destroy Nixon, the Cowboy’s favorite politico. Oglesby explicitly denies that the Yankee-Cowboy model ex- plains everything, or that only two conspiracies are at work in our world. “A multitude of conspiracies,” he argues, are always fighting over the territorial-economic Top Dog status; the Yankees and Cowboys are merely the two most powerful coalitions in the United States at this time. A major sub-theme of this book concerns the evolution of the strange relationships between the CIA and three clandestine forces examined by other conspiriologists: (1) the “round table groups” established by Cecil Rhodes to guide Anglo-American foreign policy in a direction appealing to liberals and profitable to bankers (the Insiders, again); (2) the Mafia, which began its relationship with the U.S. intelligence community during World War II and has steadily developed a symbiosis with it; and (3) the neo-Nazi underground, headed by General Reinhard Gehlen , who managed the transition from Hitler’s top intelligence officer to a CIA asset very quickly and brought lots of other Nazis with him.

Yin represents a “female” force, darkness, passivity, water, flowing, mellowness, the shady side of a mountain, etc.; yang is “male,” bright, shining, active, fiery, explosive, creative, the sunny side of a mountain, etc. Some have identified yin and yang with the negative and pos- itive forces in quantum wave mechanics. Others have identified them with the right and left hemispheres of the human brain. In the Discordian revelation, the yin and yang are partial as- pects of hodge and podge. Hodge contains yin but also includes chaos, practical jokes, anarchy, rebellion, etc., while podge con- tains yang but also law and order, bureaucracy, militarism, regi- mentation, mindless obedience, etc. In the Sub-Genius faith, all these opposites reduce to Something and Nothing, and the art of life is to attain Slack , the perfect balance in between, which allows you to get Something for Nothing.

According to the laws of physics, when a projectile (such as a bullet) hits an object, that object moves in the direction of the projectile: Thus, if Kennedy’s head snapped back, that bullet came from in front, e.g., from the grassy knoll.

Time-Life paid Mr. Zapruder $150,000 for the film (a price equal to a million dollars today, Lifton claims) and yet never showed the film anywhere—not in theaters, not on TV, nowhere . 2. The Warren Commission never once mentions this crucial fact about the film (the backward snap, which has inspired more than 35 years of controversy), indicating either that they were very hurried and sloppy or that they deliberately didn’t want to face the implications this raised.
