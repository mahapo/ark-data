[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Octave of Energy by Robert Anton Wilson T he Law of Octaves was first suggested by Pythagoras in ancient Greece. Having observed that the eight notes of the conventional Occidental musi cal scale were governed by definite mathematical relations hips, Pythagoras proceeded to create a whole cosmology based on 8s. In this octagonal model Pythagoras made numerous mistakes, because he was generalizing from insufficient data. However, his work was the first attempt in history to unify science, mathematics, art and mysticism into one comprehensible system and as such is still influential. Leary, Crowley and Buckminster Fuller have all described themselves as modern Pythagoreans. In China, roughly contem porary with Pythagoras, the Taoists built up a cosmology based on the interplay of yang (positive) and yin (negat ive), which produced the eight trigrams of the I Ching , out of which are generated the 64 hexagrams. In India, Buddha announced, after his illumination under the Bodhi tree, t he Noble Eightfold Path. Patanjali subsequently reduced the science of yoga to eight \"limbs\" or, as we might say, eight \"steps.\" The game of chess appeared, somewhere in the East, with a grid based on 8x8 (64) squares. Hepler discovered the laws of planetary motion serendipitously, while trying to make the planets fit into the Pythagorean octave."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" In the 1860s, English chemist John Newland showed that all the chemical element s fall into eight families. Since Pythagorean mysticism was unfashionable at that time, Newland was literally l aughed at and re jected by the Royal Chemical Society. In the 1870s, with much more detail than Newland, the Russian chemist Mendeleyev proved once and for all that the elements do, indeed, fall into eight families. His Peri odic Table of the Elements, an octave of hauntingly Pythagorean harmony, hangs in every high-school chemistry class today. (The Royal Society later apologized to N ewland and gave him a Gold Medal.) Nikolai Tesla invented the alternating current generator which unleashed t he modern technological revolution after a series of v isions in which, among other things, Tesla \"saw\" that everything in the universe obeys a law of Octaves. Modern geneticists have found that the DNA-RNA \"dialogue\" -- the molecular information system governing life and evolution - it trans mitted by 64 (8x8) codons. R. Buckminster Fuller , in his Synergetic-Energetic Geometry, which he claims i s the \"co-ordinate system of the Universe,\" reduces a ll phenomena to geometric- energetic constructs based on the tetrahedron (4-sided), the octet truss (8-sided) and the coupler (8-faceted with 24 phases). Fuller argues specifically that the 8-face, 24- phase coupler underlies the 8-fold division of the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"chemical elements on the M endeleyev Periodic Table. In 1973, unaware of Fuller's coupler - which I called to his attention later - Dr. Leary began to divide his 8 circuits into a 24-stage Periodic Table of Evolution (see diagram). Leary also began attempting to correlate this with the Periodic Table of Elements in chemistry. The eight families of elements are: 1. Alkalis 2. Alkalines 3. Borons 4. Carbons 5. Nitrogens 6. Oxygens 7. Halogens 8. Noble Gases The first four families, Leary argues, are terrestrial; that is, they are heavy and tend to fall to Ea rth. The second four familes are extraterrestrial; that is, they tend to float off into space. Similarly, he says, the first four circuits of the nervous system are terrestrial; their function is to control survival and reproduction at the bottom of the 4,000-mile gravity well in which we presently live. The s econd four circuits, then, are extraterrestrial; they will come into full play only when we live normally in zero-gravity - in free space.

(On the synap tic level, this appears as dendrites, receiving signals; cell-bodies, making decisions; and axions, transmitting signals.) This 24-stage chart can be correlated with the hebrew alphabet, thereby casting new light on the Cabala; with the Tarot cards (a Sufi invention, it is claimed); and with the Zodiac (if we allow 12 extraterrestrial types to complete the 12 terrestrial types of tr aditional astrology). These correlations are not indicated on the diagram; a full explaination will be found in two later books. Working independently of Lear y and myself, Prof. Peter Fl essel of the University of San Franci sco has begun developing correla tions between the 8x8 codons of the g enetic code and the 8x8 hexagram s of the I Ching , which he will be publishing soon. It is to be hoped that in further work on the Leary Peri odic Table, Flessel's correlat ions and Fuller's 24-phase geometric coupler, science will eventuall y find a \"Rosetta Stone\" by which the traditional symbols of occultism can be decoded in modern, operati onal, scientific categories."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" It will be seen by the though tful reader that this emergi ng synthesis evades entirely the us ual dichotomy of \"spiritual\" ve rsus \"material,\" being pur ely geometric-energetic.
