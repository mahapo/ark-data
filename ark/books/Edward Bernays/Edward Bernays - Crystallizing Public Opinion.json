As I read through his writings, I started to grasp his largelyunknown influence on the contours of contemporary life. While his life storystood, for the most part, in the shadows of American history, this was “theinvisible wire puller” who had devised many of the powerful ways that the toolsof mass persuasion would shape the terrain of American society from the earlytwentieth century onward.1Beginning his career in the early 1900s, Bernays would soon become one of themost influential pioneers of American public relations, a person whose worldlyactivities, though not widely known, left a deep mark on the configuration ofour world.Today all of this has changed. Due to a growing interest in the historicalrelationship between media, culture and society in the modern age, the name ofEdward Bernays has become more and more familiar. Since the 1970s, an increasingnumber of books and films have appeared, and this once covert PR operative hasbeen transformed into an his-torical figure of controversy and renown.2Born in Vienna in 1891, Bernays was the double nephew of Sigmund Freud. Hismother was Freud’s elder sister, Anna; his father Ely was Freud’s wife’s (MarthaBernays Freud) brother. His family background impressed him with the enormouspower of intellectual life and accustomed him to the privileges and creaturecomforts of bourgeois existence.Bernays was also a farsighted architect of modern propaganda techniques who,dramatically, from the early 1920s—when Crystallizing Public Opinion firstappeared—helped to consolidate a fateful marriage between theories of mass andindividual psychology and the designs of corporate and political persuasion.During the First World War, Bernays served as a foot soldier for the U.S.Committee on Public Information (CPI)—the vast American propaganda machinemobilized in 1917 to package, advertise and sell the war as one that would “Makethe World Safe for Democracy.” The CPI would become the source from whichmarketing strategies for subsequent wars—including the spurious and deadlyadventure in Iraq—would flow.In the twenties, Bernays fathered the link between corporate sales campaigns andpopular social causes, when—while working for the American Tobacco Company—hepersuaded women’s rights marchers in New York City to hold up Lucky Strikecigarettes as symbolic “Torches of Freedom.” In October of 1929, Bernays alsooriginated the now familiar “global media event,” when he dreamed up “Light’sGolden Jubilee,” a world-wide celebratory spectacle honoring the fiftiethanniversary of the electric light bulb, sponsored—behind the scenes—by theGeneral Electric Corporation.Bernays’s influence would continue to hold sway well into the post-World War IIera. To put it simply, Bernays’s career—more than that of any otherindividual—roughed out what have become the strategies and practices of publicrelations in the United States and, increasingly, on a global scale.Alongside the numerous, well-documented campaigns he directed—including one forthe United Fruit Company which led to the 1954 CIA-engineered coup thatoverthrew the democratically elected president of Guatemala—Bernays wroteprolifically.3 His books, Crystallizing Public Opinion (1923), Propaganda(1928), and his seminal 1947 article, “The Engineering of Consent,” are amongthe most significant documents in the history of what one scholar has termed,“the compliance professions,” those groups and often clandestine organizationsthat exist to manufacture public thought, opinion and be-havior on behalf ofpolitical and corporate clients.4Propaganda, and “The Engineering of Consent,” were the self-confident andunabashed writings of a man who was already established as the foremost figurein the public relations fraternity. Both are filled with bold and hyperbolicproclamations, exemplified by the opening paragraph in Propaganda.The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinionsof the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those whomanipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible govern-mentwhich is the true ruling power of our country.5In 1923, however, Bernays urgently believed that a case for the practices ofpublic relations in a democratic society still needed to be made. CrystallizingPublic Opinion was his presentation of this case, a straightforward manifestoproviding a measured and studious argument for the importance of a newprofession, which he dubbed “the public relations counsel.” Much as legalcounsels advise and defend clients in the realm of law—the public relationscounsel, as Bernays described him—it was always a he—provided expertise toclients on ways to effectively mold public opinion on behalf of their interests.The rise of this new profession, he contended, had already begun to alter thesocial landscape.No single profession … within the last ten years has extended its field ofusefulness more remarkably and touched upon intimate and important aspects ofthe everyday life of the world more significantly than the profession of publicrelations counsel.Bernays’s insistence on the importance of defining public relations as arespectable profession was founded on his belief that many people looked uponthe practices of publicity with disdain. In this book, Bernays sought to redeemthe reputation of public relations and situate it as the intrinsic outcome of aserious intellectual tradition. In naming the book, he drew upon the language ofscience. “Crystallization,” in the field of physical chemistry, describes theprocess by which an amorphous entity—a gas or suspension in fluid form—istransformed into a solid coherent mass. For Bernays, “crystallizing publicopinion” was about taking an “ill-defined, mercurial and changeable group ofindividual judgments” and transforming them into a cohesive and manageable form.In the book, Bernays portrayed the public relations practitioner as aninstrumental social scientist, a resolute student of human motivation. “His textbooks for this study are the facts of life,” he claimed, the “mental equipmentof the average individual.”The public relations counsel, he argued, specialized in understanding the publicmind and knowing how to create those circumstances that would gain publicattention to consolidate public opinion. A pivotal aspect of the PR counsel’s“wide range of instruments and techniques,” as Bernays described them, was anintimate knowledge of those “mediums … through which public attention is reachedand influenced.… the channels of thought and communication.” In addition to hisdiscussions of newspapers, magazines and the recent development of broadcastradio, Bernays’s description of those “channels of thought and communication”included word-of-mouth networks and the role played by individuals whoseopinions influence the outlooks of others—teachers, business leaders, theclergy, etc.If understanding the dynamics of public opinion was one of his specialties, sotoo was a comprehension of the railroad tracks along which ideas and opinionstravel. An early look at his flair for unseen engineering is found in the workhe did in 1913 to foster the success of a controversial play, entitled “DamagedGoods,” which dealt with the controversial topic of syphilis. This was a time,Bernays wrote in the book that follows, when sexual matters of any kind were notconsidered appropriate for public discussion. As Bernays noted, “AnthonyComstock, who headed the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, hadalready closed other shows that he thought too daring.”In order to bypass such Victorian prudery, Bernays created a new organizationand enlisted the public support of “men and women whose good faith was beyondquestion and would be responsive to our cause.” Turning “Damaged Goods” into adramatic brief on behalf of public health these men and women—who included JohnD. Rockefeller, Jr.; Simon Flexner, the head of the Rockefeller Institute forMedical Research; Rose Pastor Stokes, an eminent social worker, and Mrs. WilliamK. Vanderbilt, among others—transformed a potential failure into a major successthat eventually gained national press when performed at the White House forPresident Woodrow Wilson and his high profile guests. In handling publicity forthe play, Bernays displayed an uncommon genius social engineering that woulddefine his career and would sharpen the focus of public relations thinking fromthen on.Beyond his discussion of the “Damaged Goods” campaign, and other vivid casestudies, Crystallizing Public Opinion was Bernays’s response to changes that hadtaken place in American society in the decades preceding its publication.Bernays wrote of the extent to which upper class Americans who had formerly“stood aloof from the general public and were able to say ‘The public bedamned,’” had come to recognize that such open contempt wasn’t playing well inPeoria, or anywhere else. Social unrest, and widespread anti-business activismwere its most visible consequences. “The willingness to spend thousands ofdollars in obtaining professional advice on how best to present one’s views orproducts to a public is based on this fact.”As this book clearly reveals, Bernays was building on ideas that had beenpercolating in Europe and the United States for several decades. Unlike hislater writings, which paid lip service to his intellectual forebears, inCrystallizing Public Opinion, Bernays built his arguments on a foundation ofideas culled from a variety of prominent commentators on politics, society andthe dynamics of psychic life. Their presence is manifest throughout the book.Of course there was his uncle, Sigmund Freud, whose theories regarding theunconscious, the power of symbols, and the subterranean meaning of dreams hadgained currency in the United States by the 1920s. But in reading Bernays’sbook, it is evident that other thinkers were also extremely important to hisworldview.Though his name does not appear in Crystallizing Public Opinion, perhaps themost influential precursor to Bernays’s writings and approach—whom he named inlater writings—was the French sociologist, Gustave Le Bon, who in 1895 publishedThe Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind.Le Bon’s book was translated into nineteen languages within a year, and soongained a wide readership among Western elites. It inspired the creation of whatwould become the rapidly growing field of Social Psychology, a field thatcontinues to prosper. Le Bon was less concerned with public opinion than he waswith the rapid growth of democratic movements, and the threat they posed to theestablished hierarchies of power. In his book, he proposed to offer a diagnosticanatomy of the mind of the masses, believing that a “knowledge of the psychologyof crowds is today the last resource of the statesman.…”In The Crowd Le Bon provided a preliminary handbook for people interested in“managing the human climate,” offering advice on the usefulness of images andtheatrics as tools of persuasion, and making continual reference to theunconscious powers of suggestion. While Le Bon’s book offered little in the wayof practical advice, his general estimation of the popular mind—that it wasdriven not by reason, but by illogical and primitive instinctive forces—wouldprofoundly influence subsequent engineers of consent for decades to come.“Crowds have always undergone the influence of illusions,” he wrote, “Whoevercan supply them with illusions is easily their master. Whoever attempts todestroy their illusions is always their victim.” For Le Bon, to exert controlover the social order in a democratic age a “small intellectual aristocracy,”adept in the application of mass psychology, was essential.Following Le Bon, a growing number of Western thinkers began to wrestle with themechanisms that generated mass perception. Le Bon’s close friend, Gabriel Tarde,wrote of the extent to which newspapers, and other early mass media, contributedto a kind of groupthink. Tarde suggested in 1898 that “the public” was the“social group of the future,” and that its private thoughts and discussions werebut a product of the public power of the press, and international news services,which were providing an increasingly homogenized picture of reality.The press unifies and invigorates conversations … every morning the papers givetheir public the conversations of the day … This increasing similarity ofsimultaneous conversations in an ever more vast geographic domain is one of themost important characteristics of our time.Evoking a metaphor inspired by the recent invention of the phonograph, Tardeargued, “the conversations of individuals … are forced to follow the groove oftheir borrowed thoughts. One pen suffices to set off a million tongues.” Thisperspective, as you will find in Crystallizing Public Opinion, infused Bernays’sunderstanding of how the public relations counsel does his work, particularly inhis analysis of the social and personal channels of communication.Others whose work influenced Bernays included the British political scientist,Graham Wallas, whose 1908 book, Human Nature in Politics, maintained that “theempirical art of politics” was not based on fact-based appeals to reason.Instead, he asserted, it “consists largely in the creation of opinion, by thedeliberate exploitation of subconscious, non-rational inference.”In Crystallizing Public Opinion, Bernays repeatedly cites a 1916 book, TheInstincts of the Herd in Peace and War. Written by the British surgeon andsocial psychologist Wilfred Trotter (whom Bernays erroneously refers to asWilliam Trotter), who maintained:No understanding of the causes of stability and instability in human society ispossible until the undiminished vigour of instincts in man is fully recognized.Of particular interest to Trotter, and to Bernays, was the “herd instinct,” theunceasing need to gain the approval and camaraderie of the social group. Theindividual Trotter wrote, is “more sensitive to the voice of the herd than toany other influence. It can inhibit or stimulate his thought and conduct.It is the source of his moral codes, of the sanctions of his ethics andphilosophy. It can endow him with energy, courage, and endurance, and can aseasily take these away.For Edward Bernays, these early writings, and others cited in this book,provided a psychic architecture that a public relations practitioner needed tounderstand in great depth. Without a thorough comprehension of the unconsciousand instinctual triggers that stimulate human behavior, he would arguethroughout his long career, the work of the “public relations counsel” would beimpossible.In many ways, the experience of the First World War challenged many mainstreamintellectuals’ faith in the possibility of direct democracy. The propagandaefforts of the CPI reinforced a growing belief that ordinary men and women wereincapable of rational thought. For democracy to work effectively, public opinionneeded to be guided by what historian Robert Westbrook has characterized as“enlightened and responsible elites.”More than any other individual, the prominent and powerful journalist, writer,and confidant of Presidents—Walter Lippmann—propagated this idea. A formersocialist, Lippmann had moved, even before the war, to the conviction thatpopular sovereignty was impossible in the “Great Society,” his catchphrase forthe modern world. As the United States entered “The Great War” in 1917, Lippmannplayed a pivotal role in convincing President Woodrow Wilson to deploy a vastpropaganda bureau designed to deflect widespread skepticism and bring publicopinion on board.After the war, Lippmann held fast to the idea that the American people wereincapable of self-rule. For democracy to work, the machinery of the public mindneeded to be understood and managed by an educated elite. This idea was centralto Lippmann’s pivotal book, Public Opinion, whose influence is evident in thetitle, and throughout the pages, of Bernays’s Crystallizing Public Opinion,which appeared the following year.Lippmann’s Public Opinion remains one of the most important books of thetwentieth century. Its diagnosis of “the public mind,” along with its ideasabout how leaders can manage it, remains the most articulate statement regardingthe exercise of power in the United States on to the present, and underlined thecritical importance of what Lippmann termed “the manufacture of consent.”Two of Lippmann’s ideas were particularly significant as Bernays crafted the jobof the “public relations counsel.” The first of these was Lippmann’s argumentthat people’s view of reality was guided by the “pictures in their heads.”Living within the cocoons of their personal lives, and with minimal directaccess to the outer world, most people’s sense of reality was shaped by what hetermed “pseudo-environments.” While this meant that ordinary citizens were notable to intelligently comprehend the real issues of their world, their relianceon pseudo-environments provided educated elites with a powerful tool foreffective leadership.“The new psychology … the study of dreams, fantasies and rationalizations, hasthrown light on how the pseudo-environment is put together,” he wrote. Ifpatterns of perception could be unearthed, if scientists could uncover the“habits” of people’s eyes, they might also learn to engineer“pseudo-environments” which could persuade people to see their “larger politicalenvironment … more successfully.” Perception management, he contended, woulddefend democracy from the prospect of capricious authoritarianism.Though it is itself an irrational force, the power of public opinion might beplaced at the disposal of those who stood for workable law as against bruteassertion.A second idea that stands conspicuously within Bernays’ thinking, was Lippmann’sintroduction of the modern usage of the word stereotype. Prior to the twenties,stereotype was a term relating to the printing trades, but Lippmann redefinedit, describing stereotypes as a “repertory of fixed impressions” that “we carryaround in our heads,” rigid mental templates that frame individual experience inan increasingly anonymous world.For Lippmann, stereotypes did not emanate from the individual, but were aninexorable by-product of their surrounding culture, a perceptual reflex thatimposed itself between people’s eyes and the world they believed they wereseeing.For the most part we do not first see, and then define, we define first and thensee. In the great blooming, buzzing confusion of the outer world we pick outwhat our culture has already defined for us, and we tend to perceive that whichwe have picked out in the form stereotyped for us by our culture.Ensemble, Lippmann argued, stereotypes constituted a coherent—ifinaccurate—worldview. Unconsciously, but aggressively, people relied on them fora sense of where they belong in the world.These preconceptions, unless education has made us acutely aware, governs deeplythe whole process of perception. They mark out certain objects as familiar orstrange, emphasizing the difference, so that slightly familiar is seen as veryfamiliar, and the somewhat strange is sharply alien.As central components of people’s mental equipment, Lippmann describedstereotypes as the “foundations” of their “universe.”They are an ordered, more or less consistent picture of the world … They may notbe a complete picture … but they are a picture of a possible world to which weare adapted. In that world people and things have their well-known places, anddo certain expected things. We feel at home there. We fit in. We are members. Weknow the way around. There we find the charm of the familiar, the normal, thedependable; its grooves and shapes are where we are accustomed to find them … Itfits as snugly as an old shoe.Given the comfort that this “repertory of stereotypes” affords us, he concluded,…[A]ny disturbance of the stereotypes seems like an attack on the founda-tionsof the universe. It is an attack on the foundations of our universe, and, wherebig things are at stake, we do not readily admit that there is any differencebetween our universe and the universe.As Bernays was writing Crystallizing Public Opinion, the logic of Lippmann’sbook infused his mind and his argument. “The public relations counsel createsnew stereotypes,” he wrote, building these stereotypes out of a keenunderstanding of the “fundamental instincts in the people he is trying toreach.”The public relations specialist’s goal was to create “a compact, vividsimplification of complicated issues.” This idea drew upon Lippmann’s theoriesabout the anatomy of public opinion, along with the conclusions of a battery ofsocial psychologists that preceded him.Describing the peculiar aptitude of the public relations counsel, Bernaysmaintained “it is his capacity for crystallizing the obscure tendencies of thepublic mind before they have reached definite expression, which makes him sovaluable.”His ability to create those symbols to which the public is ready to respond; hisability to know and to analyze those reactions which the public is ready togive; his ability to find those stereotypes, individual and community, whichwill bring favorable responses; his ability to speak the language of hisaudience and to receive from it a favorable reception are his contributions. Theappeal to the instincts and the universal desires is the basic method throughwhich he produces his results.In light of this kind of professionalized necromancy, Bernays was careful toinsert the notion that the “public relations counsel” must closely adhere toethical standards. Manipulating mass perception is always a dodgy exercise, butwithout a backbone of ethics, even Bernays was aware that it could be usedtowards dangerous ends.There is one danger in the use of stereotypes by the public relations counsel.That … demagogues in every field of social relationship can take advantage ofthe public.At the end of the day, the counsel’s intellectual arsenal had one primarypurpose: the manufacture of news. “The public relations counsel must not onlysupply news—he must create news.”This didn’t happen by dropping off press releases at newspaper or other mediaoffices. It came instead from an educated ability to understand “what newsactually is”—what it looks and tastes like—and the capacity to orchestrateoccurrences that will attract news coverage and be viewed by the public ascurrent events.The public relations counsel must lift startling facts from his whole subjectand present them as news. He must isolate ideas and develop them into events sothat they can be more readily understood and so they can claim attention asnews.Throughout Crystallizing, Bernays cited numerous examples drawn from his ownpractice, to exemplify this process in vivid. This is key to the durablerelevance of this book: its effective, if somewhat disturbing, amalgamation ofcontemporary theory with what have become standard practices.In recent times, the persistent belief that President Barack Obama was not bornin the United States, and therefore was ineligible to become President, offers aprime example of the extent to which the assertion of “startling facts” canbecome and remain news for years—even when empirical evidence demonstrates thatthese facts are wholly fictitious. As Lippmann wrote, people will vehementlycling to the stereotypes that comprise the foundation of their universe, evenwhen they are patently erroneous.In writing the introduction to Edward Bernays’s Crystallizing Public Opinion, Iwould be remiss not to mention my lengthy personal encounter with Bernays,twenty years after I had first encountered his writings. It was remarkable.In two of my earliest books, Captains of Consciousness (1976) and All ConsumingImages (1988) Bernays had appeared as a central character, an eloquent andinfluential ideologue of American consumer culture, and a founding father in thefield of public relations.Both times my encounters with Bernays were like those that usually take placebetween historians and the “historical figures” that they write about. They wereexchanges between old documents and the inquiring mind of a reader andinterpreter.When, in 1990, as I commenced work on PR! A Social History of Spin (1996), Iassumed, reasonably, that Bernays was long gone. The picturesque record that hehad left behind was as close as I was likely to get to him. Soon, however, Istumbled onto the fact that my reasonable assumption was incorrect. In aconversation with a neighbor of mine named Richard Weiner—who was himself aprominent member of the public relations fraternity, and remains a prolificauthor on communications issues—I learned that Bernays was, in fact, still aliveapproaching his hundredth birthday. In fact he resided in Cambridge,Massachusetts, only a short walk from the Widener Library at Harvard where I hadfirst discovered some of his writings more than twenty years earlier.When he heard about the book I was working on, Weiner instructed me: “If you aregoing to do this book, you’ve got to talk to Eddie Bernays.” I was astonishedand delighted to hear Bernays referred to in the present tense; I was alsoamused to hear him referred to as “Eddie.” Behind the aura of an historicalfigure, stood a guy called Eddie. I obtained Bernays’ telephone number and setout to arrange an interview.An exploratory call to Bernays reached an answering machine. A woman’s voice,official in tone, informed me that I had reached the offices of “Dr. Edward L.Bernays,” and that “Dr. Bernays” was currently unavailable. I was instructed toleave a message. For a man of almost 100, Bernays was still communicating an airof business-as-usual. I told the machine:My name is Stuart Ewen. I am an historian, a writer. I’m currently working on abook on the social history of public relations. I would very much like to cometo Cambridge, to visit with “Dr. Bernays” in order to conduct an oral historyinterview. I left my phone number, and indicated that, should I not hear backfrom him shortly, I would call again. Two days later, I received a phone call athome from Edward Bernays.It felt weird, like a dream. Given my experience tracking his historicalfootprints, it was like talking-via dixie cups and a string-with a piece ofhistory. His voice was soft, a bit hoarse, the voice of an elderly man, to besure, but he also sounded deft and business-like.He asked me about myself, my background, where I taught, about the book I waswriting. I told him that I was a cultural historian, with a particular interestin the ways that the mass media have crisscrossed with the experiences oftwentieth century American life. I told him that I knew a great deal about him,his life and contributions, and added that I had recently published a bookexploring the influence of commercial imagery on the contours of Americansociety. Without missing a beat Edward Bernays retorted, scrappily, “Of course,you know, we don’t deal in images.… We deal in reality.”My fascinating encounter with Edward L. Bernays had begun. I had already beenoffered a lesson from the master. Ideally, the job of public relations is notsimply one of disseminating favorable images and impressions for a client. ForBernays and, as I would learn, for many others in the field, the goal was farmore ambitious than that. Public relations was about fashioning and projectingcredible renditions of reality itself.Rather than pursue the interview by telephone—I wanted to meet him,face-to-face—I arranged to visit Edward Bernays at his home, on Columbus Day of1990. In the weeks preceding our scheduled meeting, I re-familiarized myselfwith some of his writings, including Crystallizing Public Opinion (1923);Propaganda (1928); “The Engineering of Consent” (1947); and his 1965autobiography, Biography of an Idea: Memoirs of Public Relations Counsel EdwardL. Bernays.Bernays, meanwhile, sought to put his own spin on the forthcoming interview. Hesent me a photocopy of a biographical piece about him that had appeared recentlyin a special issue of LIFE magazine, listing the 100 most influential Americansof the twentieth century.On the chill, gray morning of October 12, 1990, I took the shuttle fromLaGuardia to Logan Airport in Boston, leaving myself enough time to arrive atBernays’ home for our scheduled one o’clock interview. Crossing the CharlesRiver into Cambridge, the cab took me toward a maze of old, tree-lined streetsbordering Harvard Square, stopping by the large red number “7” that Bernays hadinformed me marked his house. The house itself was stately, a large whitewood-frame, surrounded by some hedges, unpretentious. Walking up the path to thedoor, I did not know what to expect.I rang the doorbell and waited for an answer. A minute or two passed, and therewas none. Not a sound. Had he forgotten? Was the apparent wit with which he hadspoken to me on the phone only illusory? I rang again, and waited. Then, afteranother minute or so had passed and I had begun to grow disconsolate, I heardsoft footsteps moving slowly toward the door. “Bernays?” I thought. Instead, aChinese woman, of middle age, opened the door a crack and said, “Yes?” I toldher who I was; that I had, a couple of weeks before, scheduled an interview forthis afternoon with Mr. Bernays.She looked at me quizzically, and then muttered something about his having beenill yesterday. Inviting me into the house, and directing me to wait in the firstfloor library, she disappeared to inquire whether he was up to seeing me.As I waited, I inspected the shelves of the spacious, high-ceilinged room inwhich I stood. It was a remarkable collection of books, thousands of them: aboutpublic opinion, individual and social psychology, survey research, propaganda,psychological warfare, and so forth; a comprehensive library spanning matters ofhuman motivation and strategies of influence, scanning a period of more than onehundred years. These were not the bookshelves of some shallow huckster, but thearsenal of an intellectual. The cross hairs of nearly every volume were trainedon the target of forging public attitudes. Here—in a large white room inCambridge, Massachusetts—was the constellation of ideas that had inspired andinformed a twentieth century preoccupation: the systematic molding of pub-licopinion.Captured in thought, I suddenly heard steps moving swiftly toward the librarydoor. As the door swung open, there—standing before me in a comfy-looking brown,three-piece suit and tie, and transmitting a sparkle through his wizenedeyes—was a puckish little man with thin, shaggy white hair. The swift steps I’dheard were those of Edward L. Bernays, moving toward the threshold of hisone-hundredth year.Despite years of pondering him as a shrewd and cynical manipulator of publicconsciousness, I was immediately entranced. His physical countenance reminded meof pictures I had seen of an aged Albert Einstein. He moved toward me and, withsmiles, we exchanged formal introductions. “I want you to have this,” I said,and handed him an inscribed copy of my most recent book, All Consuming Images,which he accepted with a nod. He then instructed me that we should go upstairs,to his office, for the interview.He led me to the bottom of a tall staircase. On the left side there was achair-elevator, the kind one associates with wealthy invalids in the movies.“You ever ride on one of these things?” he asked me.“No, I’ve only seen them in pictures,” I responded frankly.“Get on!” he commanded me, like an elfin carny beside an amusement park ride.I turned around and sat down, my feet resting on a metal platform at the base ofthe chair. “Move your feet,” he ordered.“What?”“Move your feet back.”Without understanding I drew my feet to the back of the platform, leaving anarrow ledge in front of them. Suddenly, he stepped onto the ledge, his smallpear-shaped body hovering over mine. “Should I hold you?” I asked, concerned forhis frail bones.“No,” he responded dismissively, as he pushed a button on the side of the chair,and we glided up together and, turning a slight corner toward the end of thevoyage, arrived on the second story. At the summit of the climb, Bernays hoppedoff onto the landing, and I—somewhat shakily—proceeded off behind him. “We don’tdeal with images,” I thought, “we deal in reality.”He led me through a dark room off the landing. Its walls were covered withscores of framed black and white photographs, many of them inscribed.Wordlessly, yet eloquently, the pictures placed my ancient host close to theheartbeat of the twentieth century. Bernays on his way to the Paris PeaceConference, 1918. Bernays standing with Enrico Caruso. Bernays and Henry Ford.Bernays and Thomas Edison. Bernays and Dwight David Eisenhower. A photo portraitof his uncle, Freud, was also conspicuous. Bernays with the “great men,” at the“great events” of the twentieth century. I looked … awestruck. He said nothing.In silence, I was fascinated, absorbed by it all.From the photo gallery, we stepped into his small office, a solarium, and tookseats by a cluttered desk. We began to talk. He began by asking me questions:about myself, my background, what had attracted me to his work in particular,and—more generally—to the broader study of communications in twentieth centuryAmerica.I opened with a rhetorical response. “How can you deal with 20th century culturewithout dealing with …?”“… the basis of the exchange of ideas that makes the culture,” he completed mythought.Coming from very different vantage points, from different epochs, we understoodeach other. He knew what I was looking for. Within my historical study of publicrelations, I sought to make sense of the peculiar processes of representationand perception—the “exchange of ideas,” as he put it—that have come todistinguish cultural life in the era of mass communication. Both of us, thoughfrom different vantage points, were interested in the relationship betweensystems of communication and the exercise of power.The next four hours were vintage Edward Bernays. Again and again I heardword-for-word reiterations of themes, stories, even specific catch phrases thatI had encountered many times before in his writings.Nonetheless, beyond the actual experience of meeting with Bernays, some parts ofthe interview were new to me.I was particularly intrigued, for example, by Bernays’ reflections on theconnection between his own thinking and that of Walter Lippmann. WhileCrystallizing Public Opinion contains many ideas derived from Lippmann, hebelieved that his own book was more practical, less academic.Lippmann treated public opinion on a purely theoretical basis. He never got downto matters of changing it. He talks of it as if he were a sociologistdis-cussing a social caste system … abstractly. And I was surprised. Here hewas, a working newspaperman.Another interesting point in our conversation came when he spoke of his wife,and business partner, Doris E. Fleischman. The two had worked as a team from1922, when they were married, until her death in 1980. Though Fleischman was alifelong feminist, and continued to use her own name—even after marriage—heridentity within Bernays’s public relations firm was furtive.As Bernays put it to me, “If I’m speaking with Alfred P. Sloan, Chairman of theBoard of General Motors, he doesn’t want to know that his company’s approach tothe public was designed by a woman.”“So how was she known?” I inquired.His response: “She was known as Edward L. Bernays.”There were, however, some other aspects of the interview that are worthrecounting here, aspects that reflect on the history and meaning of publicrelations itself.Throughout the interview Bernays expressed an unabashedly hierarchical view ofsociety. Repeatedly, he maintained that, while most people respond to theirworld instinctively, without thought, there exist an “intelligent few” who havebeen charged with the responsibility of contemplating and influencing the tideof history. Perceived by Bernays as one of these “few,” he was willing to sharehis outlook with me in straightforward terms.Although he had written extensively, over a lifetime, about democracy and on theimportant role that public relations plays in a democratic society, Bernays,himself, was clearly no democrat. He expressed little respect for the averageperson’s ability to think out, understand, or act upon the world in which theylive.“There are strange things about the culture,” he intoned. “The average IQ is 100of the American public, did you know that?” Assuming I grasped what for him wasobvious, Bernays then sketched a picture of the public relations expert as amember of the “intelligent few” who advises clients on how to “deal with themasses … just by applying psychology.”As a member of that intellectual elite which guides the destiny of society, thePR “professional,” Bernays explained, aims his craft at a general public that isessentially, and unreflectively, reactive. Working behind the scenes, out ofpublic view, the public relations expert is “an applied social scientist,” oneeducated to employ an understanding of “sociology, psychology, social psychologyand economics” in order to influence and direct public attitudes. This notionwas expressed succinctly in Bernays’s 1928 book, Propaganda.Trotter and Le Bon concluded that the group mind does not think in the strictsense of the word. In place of thought it has impulses, habits and emotions. Inmaking up its mind, its first impulse is usually to follow the example of atrusted leader. This is one of the most firmly established principles of masspsychology.Throughout our conversation, Bernays conveyed his hallucination of democracy,where a highly educated class of opinion-molding tacticians are continuously atwork, analyzing the social terrain and adjusting the mental scenery from whichthe public mind, with its limited intellect, derives its opinions.Undoubtedly, this point of view offers a glimpse into Edward L. Bernays. Moreimportantly, it reflects a foundational conceit governing the field of publicrelations more broadly. While some have argued that public relations representsa “two-way street” through which institutions and the public carry on ademocratic dialog, the public’s role within that alleged dialog is, most often,one of having its blood pressure monitored, its temperature taken.Another phase of the interview deserves special mention. I came to visit Bernaysbecause he was both a participant in, and a witness to, the rise of publicrelations over a period of nearly three-quarters of a century. Anticipating theinterview, I hoped that his recollections would provide me with some new andclear sense of the particular historical soil out of which public relations, asa phenomenon, grew. In this regard I was, for the most part, frustrated. As Iprepared to depart from him, I felt a bit disappointed in this regard.Then, as we began discussing the means by which I would get from his house backto the airport, a curious conversation unfolded. Amid a general complaint aboutthe cost of taxicabs, and after counseling me to save my money and hop atrolley, Edward Bernays indicated that he, himself, had never learned how todrive an automobile. I expressed surprise. He explained that he had simply neverhad to learn to drive; among his family’s staff of up to thirteen servants,there was always a chauffeur.Bernays then proceeded to tell me the story of one chauffeur in particular, aman he called “Dumb Jack.”Each day, he related to me, Dumb Jack would awaken at 5 o’clock in the morning,and prepare to drive Bernays and his wife (and partner in public relations),Doris Fleishman, to the office. The trusty chauffeur would then return to thefamily home to carry their two daughters to school. From there, he would returnto the office in order to chauffeur Bernays and his wife to business meetingsthrough-out the day, taking time out to retrieve the daughters from theirschool. At the end of the day, according to Bernays, a subdued Dumb Jack wouldstep into the kitchen and, as the cook prepared the evening meal, he would sitat a kitchen table, lay his head in his hands, and take a nap. He would go tobed at nine, only to begin his routine again the next morning at five. Comparingthis situation favorably to the cost of one cab ride to the airport today,Bernays ended his story by saying that for all of this work, Dumb Jack receiveda salary of twenty-five dollars per week, and got a half a Thursday off everytwo weeks.“Not a bad deal,” Bernays confided, characterizing the benefits that his familyhad derived from Dumb Jack’s years of compliant service. Then, with a lilt ofnostalgia in his voice, he concluded his story: “But that’s before people got asocial conscience.”At that moment, in that nostalgic reverie over a bygone era, my quest forhistorical explanation—or at least a piece of it—was satisfied. In an incidentalreference to “social conscience,” Bernays had illuminated an historic shift inthe social history of property, shedding inadvertent light on the conditionsthat gave birth to the birth of the practice of public relations. As thetwentieth century progressed, people were no longer willing to accommodatethemselves to outmoded standards of deference which history, for millennia, haddemanded of them.Bernays was the child of an haute bourgeois world that was, in many ways, stillcaptivated by aristocratic styles of wealth, where relations between the classeswere marked, to a large extent, by deep-seated patterns of allegiance ofobedience and obligation between masters and servants. Dumb Jack was a child ofthese circumstances.The “social conscience,” to which Bernays referred, arrived at that moment whenaristocratic paradigms of deference could no longer hold up in the face ofmodern, democratic, public ideals that were boiling up among the “lower strata”of society. At that juncture, strategies of social rule began to change, and thelife and career of Edward Bernays, I should add, serves as a testament to thatchange.The explosive ideals of democracy challenged ancient customs that had longupheld social inequality. A public claiming the birthright of democraticcitizenship and social justice increasingly called upon institutions and peopleof power to justify themselves and their privileges. In the crucible of thesechanges, aristocracy began to give way to technocracy as a strategy of rule.Bernays came to maturity in a society where the exigencies of power were—bynecessity—increasingly exercised from behind the pretext of the “common good.”Bernays, the child of aristocratic pretense who fashioned himself into atechnician of mass persuasion, was the product of a “social conscience” that hadgrasped the fact that once-submissive “Dumb Jacks,” in the contemporary world,would no longer be willing to quietly place his tired head in his folded handsat the end of each day, only to awaken and serve again the next morning. Borninto privilege, developing into a technocrat, Bernays’biography illustrates theonus that the twentieth century had placed on social and economic elites; theyhave had to justify themselves continually to a public whose hearts and mindsnow bear the ideals of democracy.As I pursued my research on public relations, following my encounter withBernays, and repeatedly ran into the fear of an empowered public that ignitedthe thinking of early practitioners of public relations, the story of “DumbJack”—the man who was no more—came to mind again and again, reminding me of thehuman flesh that encircles the bones of broad institutional developments.Another story bears repeating here. Towards the middle of our interview, hopingthat I could gain insight into the way Bernays approached his practical work, Iasked him to describe how he would plan and attend to a specific publicrelations assignment. First of all, Bernays instructed, one must rid one’s mindof the conventional “press agent” image. “We’ve [speaking of himself] had nodirect contact with the mass media for about fifty years.” Rather, he continued,the job of a public relations counsel is to instruct a client on how to takeactions that “just interrupt … the continuity of life in some way to bring aboutthe [media] response.”“How would you do that?” I asked.Bernays thought for a moment, and then turned toward his desk, where he hadearlier placed the copy of my book. He picked it up and began to fondle itscover between his small, pinkish-gray fingers; glancing down at the front of thebook, reading, to himself, the descriptive material and blurbs that appeared onits back. Then, with a tone of momentousness in his voice, he turned to me:If you said to me, ‘I would like more readers of this book [tapping the cover]…I would immediately get in touch with the largest American consumer association.And I would say to the head of the consumers association, ‘There are undoubtedly… I can’t tell you the exact percentage, but X percentage of your members whoare very definitely interested in the images that come from a finance capitalistsociety, and who I think would enjoy hearing about that. Why don’t you devoteone of your twelve meetings a year to consumer images, the name of a new book,and I think it may be possible for me to get the author to talk to the New Yorkmeeting and you then make an arrangement with American Tel and Tel and have avideo tape made of him beforehand and in thirty of the largest cities of theUnited States that have the American Consumer League, you listen to an in-depthconcept of consumers and images.…Then Bernays turned to me and, with an abracadabra tone in his voice, hesummarized the imaginable result of his hypothetical phone-call to the head ofthe country’s largest consumer association:Every one of the consumer groups has contacts with the local paper, and in somecases the AP may pick it up, or Reuters, and you become an international star!I must acknowledge that I was thoroughly charmed. Here I was, sitting withEdward Bernays—innovator and artiste of modern public relations—listening to himapply his costly wizardry to me and my book. I couldn’t get over it, and thoughtto myself, “What a flatterer. This guy really knows how to polish up the oldapple.” For weeks after the interview, I was tickled by the incident, retellingit to friends, students, whoever had the patience to listen. For me the storycaptured Bernays’s engaging personality, his ingenious thought process, hisability to garner a response. With time it also reminded me of the chilling factthat charm and deception too often go hand in glove.Then, about three months after the interview—the above incident having fadedfrom my immediate memory—I received a most surprising telephone call. It wasfrom Steven Brobeck, president of the Consumer Federation of America, one of thenation’s largest and most influential consumer organizations. Mr. Brobeck wantedto know if I would be willing to serve as a keynote speaker at the upcomingConsumer Congress in Washington, DC, a convention that would bring together morethan a thousand members of consumer organizations from around the country. Hewanted me to speak about American consumer culture and the ways that seductivecommercial images are routinely employed to promote waste and disposability.C-Span, I was informed, would be taping my key-note, and would then cablecast itacross the country.I still do not know whether Bernays’ hand was behind this invitation, or whetherthe phone call was merely a result of sly coincidence. When I inquired as to theorigin of the invitation, nowhere was there any clear-cut, or evencircumstantial, evidence of Bernays’s intervention.But then I recalled another point in our lengthy conversation, when Bernayssermonized on the invisibility with which public relations experts must,ideally, perform their handiwork.When I noted that, even though LIFE magazine had included him in the list of theone hundred most influential Americans in the twentieth century, most Americanswould probably not know who he was, he responded:I’m sure of it.… To the average American your name has to be Walter Cronkite, or… [you have to be] the most beautiful girl … some movie actress they know.… Inpublic relations, just as in law, you don’t—nobody knows—who the lawyer of mostpeople is, and that lawyer may do more than the brain of the man who istheoretically doing it.… And I think it should be that way because nobody knowswho my doctor is. I mean, except friends. And he may be the basis of my living.And there I was; the mystery still unsolved. Yet the question remained, andremains, open. Things had uncannily come to pass much as Bernays had describedin his hypothetical disquisition on the work of a PR practitioner, and one wasleft to ponder whether there is any reality anymore, save the reality of publicrelations?One last point. I had gone to Cambridge to interview Edward Bernays and gatherdetails from the master regarding the history of the hidden—yetomnipresent—activities of public relations. In retrospect, I had greatlyunderestimated the individual with whom I would be talking. I had presupposedthat this keenly aware shaper of public perception, this trader in realities,was at the same time open to being candidly cross-examined. Yet in the daysfollowing our meeting, it became clear to me that my entire visit had beenorchestrated by a virtuoso.He had even offered me the key by which the pageantry of our encounter mighthave been unlocked. During the extensive taped interview that I assumed I wasconducting, Bernays had at one point turned to me, and announced:News is any overt act which juts out of the routine of circumstance.… A goodpublic relations man advises his client … to carry out an overt act …interrupting the continuity of life in some way to bring about a response.From the time I had approached the door of his house, waiting impatiently for ananswer; to my ride on the staircase elevator; to my walk through the gallery ofhistorical photographs, on to the time, five hours later, when we partedcompany, Edward Bernays—who still claimed to charge $1,000 per hour consultingfees—was giving me—free of charge, an empirical object lesson in publicrelations.In 1995, Bernays died at the age of 103. Since his death, interest in his lifeand work has only grown. The book that follows, Crystallizing Public Opinion,offers the most comprehensive account of the ideas that influenced him, andprovides a crystal clear presentation of the strategic approaches that made upthe modern field of public relations at the moment of its inception, approachesthat still endure. If anything, the twenty-first century has witnessed theencroachment of Bernays’s ideas into every crevice of our lives.Stuart EwenTruro, MassachusettsMay 20111. The phrase “invisible wirepuller” was Bernays’s own, a selfdescription foundin his 1928 book, Propaganda, p. 60.2. John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton’s 1995 book about public relations, ToxicSludge Is Good For You, continues to inform a large number of readers aboutBernays’s influ-ence. Larry Tye’s The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and theBirth of Public Relations, (New York: Crown 1998), has also helped to spreadBernays’s posthumous reputation.A 2002 film produced by the Media Education Foundation, also entitled “ToxicSludge is Good For You,” brought repeated mention of Bernays’s work into a widerange of American high school and college classrooms. Noam Chomsky, in his shortbook Media Control: The Spectacular Achievements of Propaganda, (New York: OpenMedia 2002), has also highlighted Bernays’s work.My own books have also familiarized many people with Bernays. Initially, Idiscussed him in Captains of Consciousness: Advertising and the Social Roots ofthe Consumer Culture (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1976). A much fuller and moreinformed presentation of Edward Bernays and his social impact is found in my1996 book, PR! A Social History of Spin, (New York: Basic Books).Unexpectedly PR! provided a foundation for Adam Curtis’s four-part award winningdocumentary film series, “The Century of the Self,” which includes an hour-longsegment focusing on Bernays. Initially seen on BBC television, and screenedtheatrically in New York Curtis’s powerful series has assumed a cult status andhas, probably more than any other source, provided a growing circle of peoplewith a vivid picture of Bernays’s influence on twentieth and twenty-firstcentury society. All four parts are available for viewing on the internet.Long out of print, Ig Publishing’s project to make Bernay’s books availableagain, beginning with Propaganda (1928), with an excellent introduction by MarkCrispin Miller, and continuing with this volume, is only likely to enhancegreater public awareness of Bernays and his impact on everyday life in theUnited States and elsewhere.3.

These principles I have on theone hand substantiated by the findings of psychologists, sociologists, andnewspapermen—Ray Stannard Baker, W.G. Bleyer, Richard Washburn Child, ElmerDavis, John L. Given, Will Irwin, Francis E. Leupp, Walter Lippmann, WilliamMacDougall, Everett Dean Martin, H.L. Mencken, Rollo Ogden, Charles J.Rosebault, William Trotter, Oswald Garrison Villard, and others to whom I owe adebt of gratitude for their clear analyses of the public’s mind and habits; andon the other hand, I have illustrated these principles by a number of specificexamples which serve to bear them out. I have quoted from the men listed here,because the ground covered by them is part of the field of activity of thepublic relations counsel. The actual cases which I have cited were selectedbecause they explain the application of the theories to practice. Most of theillustrative material is drawn from my personal experience; a few examples frommy observation of events. I have preferred to cite facts known to the generalpublic, in order that I might explain graphically a profession that has littleprecedent, and whose few formulated rules have necessarily a limitless numberand variety of applications.This profession in a few years has developed from the status of circus agentstunts to what is obviously an important position in the conduct of the world’saffairs.If I shall, by this survey of the field, stimulate a scientific attitude towardsthe study of public relations, I shall feel that this book has fulfilled mypurpose in writing it.E.L.B."},{"pageContent":"PART ISCOPE AND FUNCTIONS"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ITHE SCOPE OF THE PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSELA new phrase has come into the language—counsel on public relations. What doesit mean?As a matter of fact, the actual phrase is completely understood by only a few,and those only the people intimately associated with the work itself. Butdespite this, the activities of the public relations counsel affect the dailylife of the entire population in one form or another.Because of the recent extraordinary growth of the profession of public relationscounsel and the lack of available information concerning it, an air of mysteryhas surrounded its scope and functions. To the average person, this professionis still unexplained, both in its operation and actual accomplishment. Perhapsthe most definite picture is that of a man who somehow or other produces thatvaguely defined evil, “propaganda,” which spreads an impression that colors themind of the public concerning actresses, governments, railroads. And yet, aswill be pointed out shortly, there is probably no single profession which withinthe last ten years has extended its field of usefulness more remarkably andtouched upon intimate and important aspects of the everyday life of the worldmore significantly than the profession of public relations counsel.There is not event any one name by which the new profession is characterized byothers. To some the public relations counsel is known by the term“propagandist.” Others still call him press agent or publicity man. Writing evenwithin the last few years, John L. Given, the author of an excellent textbook onjournalism, does not mention the public relations counsel. He limits hisreference to the old-time press agent. Many organizations simply do not botherabout an individual name or assign to an existing officer the duties of thepublic relations counsel. One bank’s vice-president is its recognized publicrelations counsel. Some dismiss the subject or condemn the entire professiongenerally and all its members individually.Slight examination into the grounds for this disapproval readily reveals that itis based on nothing more substantial than vague impressions.Indeed, it is probably true that the very men who are themselves engaged in theprofession are as little ready or able to define their work as is the generalpublic itself. Undoubtedly this is due, in some measure, to the fact that theprofession is a new one. Much more important than that, however, is the factthat most human activities are based on experience rather than analysis.Judge Cardozo of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York finds the sameabsence of functional definition in the judicial mind. “The work of decidingcases,” he says, “goes on every day in hundreds of courts throughout the land.Any judge, one might suppose, would find it easy to describe the process whichhe had followed a thousand times and more. Nothing could be further from thetruth. Let some intelligent layman ask him to explain. He will not go very farbefore taking refuge in the excuse that the language of craftsmen isunintelligible to those untutored in the craft. Such an excuse may cover with asemblance of respectability an otherwise ignominious retreat. It will hardlyserve to still the prick of curiosity and conscience. In moments ofintrospection, when there is no longer a necessity of putting off with a show ofwisdom the uninitiated interlocutor, the troublesome problem will recur andpress for a solution: What is it that I do when I decide a case?”From my own records and from current history still fresh in the public mind, Ihave selected a few instances which only in a limited measure give some idea ofthe variety of the public relations counsel’s work and of the type of problemwhich he attempts to solve.These examples show him in his position as one who directs and supervises theactivities of his clients wherever they impinge upon the daily life of thepublic. He interprets the client to the public, which he is enabled to do inpart because he interprets the public to the client. His advice is given on alloccasions on which his client appears before the public, whether it be inconcrete form or as an idea. His advice is given not only on actions which takeplace, but also on the use of mediums which bring these actions to the public itis desired to reach, no matter whether these mediums be the printed, the spokenor the visualized word—that is, advertising, lectures, the stage, the pulpit,the newspaper, the photograph, the wireless, the mail or any other form ofthought communication.A nationally famous New York hotel found that its business was falling off at analarming rate because of a rumor that it was shortly going to close and that thesite upon which it was located would be occupied by a department store. Fewthings are more mysterious than the origins of rumors, or the credence whichthey manage to obtain. Reservations at this hotel for weeks and months aheadwere being canceled by persons who had heard the rumor and accepted itimplicitly.The problem of meeting this rumor (which like many rumors had no foundation infact) was not only a difficult but a serious one. Mere denial, of course, nomatter how vigorous or how widely disseminated, would accomplish little.The mere statement of the problem made it clear to the public relations counselwho was retained by the hotel that the only way to overcome the rumor was togive the public some positive evidence of the intention of the hotel to remainin business. It happened that the maitre d’hotel was about as well known as thehotel itself. His contract was about to expire. The public relations counselsuggested a very simple device.“Renew his engagement immediately for a term of years,” he said. “Then makepublic announcement of the fact. Nobody who hears of the renewal or the amountof money involved will believe for a moment that you intend to go out ofbusiness.” The maitre d’hotel was called in and offered a five-year engagement.His salary was one which many bank presidents might envy. Public announcement ofhis engagement was made. The maitre d’hotel was himself something of a nationalfigure. The salary stipulated was not without popular interest from both pointsof view. The story was one which immediately interested the newspapers. Anational press service took up the story and sent it out to all its subscribers.The cancellation of reservations stopped and the rumor disappeared.A nationally known magazine was ambitious to increase its prestige among a moreinfluential group of advertisers. It had never made any effort to reach thispublic except through its own direct circulation. The consultant who wasretained by the magazine quickly discovered that much valuable editorialmaterial appearing in the magazine was allowed to go to waste. Features ofinterest to thousands of potential readers were never called to their attentionunless they happened accidentally to be readers of the magazine.The public relations counsel showed how to extend the field of their appeal. Hechose for his first work an extremely interesting article by a well-knownphysician, written about the interesting thesis that “the pace that kills” isthe slow, deadly dull routine pace and not the pace of life under high pressure,based on work which interests and excites. The consultant arranged to have thethesis of the article made the basis of an inquiry among business andprofessional men throughout the country by another physician associated with amedical journal. Hundreds of members of “the quality public,” as they are knownto advertisers, had their attention focused on the article, and the magazinewhich the consultant was engaged in counseling on its public relations.The answers from these leading men of the country were collated, analyzed, andthe resulting abstract furnished gratuitously to newspapers, magazines and classjournals, which published them widely. Organizations of business andprofessional men reprinted the symposium by the thousands and distributed itfree of charge, doing so because the material contained in the symposium was ofgreat interest. A distinguished visitor from abroad, Lord Leverhulme, becameinterested in the question while in this country and made the magazine and thearticle the basis of an address before a large and influential conference inEngland. Nationally and internationally the magazine was called to the attentionof a public which had, up to that time, considered it perhaps a publication ofno serious social significance.Still working with the same magazine, the publicity consultant advised it how towiden its influence with another public on quite a different issue. He took ashis subject an article by Sir Philip Gibbs, “The Madonna of the Hungry Child,”dealing with the famine situation in Europe and the necessity for its promptalleviation. The article was brought to the attention of Herbert Hoover. Mr.Hoover was so impressed by the article that he sent the magazine a letter ofcommendation for publishing it. He also sent a copy of the article to members ofhis relief committees throughout the country. The latter, in turn, used thearticle to obtain support and contributions for relief work. Thus, while animportant humanitarian project was being materially assisted, the magazine inquestion was adding to its own influence and standing.Now, the interesting thing about this work is that whereas the public relationscounsel added nothing to the contents of the magazine, which had for years beenpublishing material of this nature, he did make its importance felt andappreciated.A large packing house was faced with the problem of increasing the sale of itsparticular brand of bacon. It already dominated the market in its field; theproblem was therefore one of increasing the consumption of bacon generally, forits dominance of the market would naturally continue. The public relationscounsel, realizing that hearty breakfasts were dietetically sound, suggestedthat a physician undertake a survey to make this medical truth articulate. Herealized that the demand for bacon as a breakfast food would naturally beincreased by the wide dissemination of this truth. This is exactly whathappened.A hair-net company had to solve the problem created by the increasing vogue ofbobbed hair. Bobbed hair was eliminating the use of the hair-net. The publicrelations counsel, after investigation, advised that the opinions of club womenas leaders of the women of the country should be made articulate on thequestion. Their expressed opinion, he believed, would definitely modify thebobbed hair vogue. A leading artist was interested in the subject and undertooka survey among the club women leaders of the country. The resultant responsesconfirmed the public relations counsel’s judgment. The opinions of these womenwere given to the public and helped to arouse what had evidently been a latentopinion on the question. Long hair was made socially more acceptable than bobbedhair and the vogue for the latter was thereby partially checked.A real estate corporation on Long Island was interested in selling cooperativeapartments to a high-class clientele. In order to do this, it realized that ithad to impress upon the public the fact that this community, within easy reachof Manhattan, was socially, economically, artistically and morally desirable. Onthe advice of its public relations counsel, instead of merely proclaiming itselfas such a community, it proved its contentions dramatically by making itself anactive center for all kinds of community manifestations.When it opened its first post office, for instance, it made this local eventnationally interesting. The opening was a formal one. National figures becameinterested in what might have been merely a local event.The reverses which the Italians suffered on the Piave in 1918 were dangerous toItalian and Allied morale. One of the results was the awakening of a distrustamong Italians as to the sincerely of American promises of military, financialand moral support for the Italian cause.It became imperative vividly to dramatize for Italy the reality of Americancooperation. As one of the means to this end the Committee on Public RelationsInformation decided that the naming of a recently completed American ship shouldbe made the occasion for a demonstration of friendship which could be reflectedin every possible way to the Italians.Prominent Italians in America were invited by the public relations counsel toparticipate in the launching of the Piave. Motion and still pictures were takenof the event. The news of the launching and its significance to Americans wastelegraphed to Italian newspapers. At the same time a message fromItalian-Americans was transmitted to Italy expressing their confidence inAmerica’s assistance of the Italian cause. Enrico Caruso, Gatti-Casazza,director of the Metropolitan Opera, and others highly regarded by theircountrymen in Italy, sent inspiriting telegrams which had a decided effect inraising Italian morale, so far as it depended upon the assurance of Americancooperation. Other means employed to disseminate information of this event hadthe same effect.The next incident that I have selected is one which conforms more closely thansome of the others to the popular conception of the work of the public relationscounsel. In the spring and summer of 1919 the problem of fitting ex-service meninto the ordinary life of America was serious and difficult. Thousands of menjust back from abroad were having a trying time finding work. After theirexperience in the war it was not surprising that they should be extremely readyto feel bitter against the Government and against those Americans who for onereason or another had not been in any branch of the service during the war.The War Department under Colonel Arthur Woods, assistant to the Secretary ofWar, instituted a nation-wide campaign to assist those men to obtain employment,and more than that, to manifest to them as concretely as it could that theGovernment continued its interest in their welfare. The incident to which Irefer occurred during this campaign.In July of 1919 there was such a shortage of labor in Kansas that it was feareda large proportion of the wheat crop could not possibly be harvested. Theactivities of the War Department in the reemployment of ex-service men hadalready received wide publicity, and the Chamber of Commerce of Kansas Cityappealed directly to the War Department at Washington, after its own efforts inmany other directions had failed, for a supply of men who would assist in theharvesting of the wheat crop. The public relations counsel prepared a statementof this opportunity for employment in Kansas and distributed it to the publicthrough the newspapers throughout the country. The Associated Press sent thestatement over its wires as a news dispatch. Within four days the Kansas CityChamber of Commerce wired to the War Department that enough labor had beensecured to harvest the wheat crop, and asked the War Department to announce thatfact as publicly as it had first announced the need for labor.By contrast with this last instance, and as an illustration of a type of workless well understood by the public, I cite another incident from the samecampaign for the reestablishment of ex-service men to normal economic and socialrelations. The problem of reemployment was, of course, the crux of thedifficulty. Various measures were adopted to obtain the cooperation of businessmen in extending employment opportunities to ex-members of the Army, Navy andMarines. One of these devices appealed to the personal and local pride ofAmerican businessmen, and stressed their obligation of honor to reemploy theirformer employees upon release from Government service.A citation was prepared, signed by the Secretary of War, the Secretary of theNavy and the Assistant to the Secretary of War for display in the stores andfactories of employers who assured the War and Navy Departments that they wouldreemploy their ex-service men. Simultaneous display of these citations wasarranged for Bastille Day, July 14, 1919, by members of the Fifth AvenueAssociation.The Fifth Avenue Association of New York City, an influential group of businessmen, was perhaps the first to cooperate as a body in this important campaign forthe reemployment of ex-service men. Concerted action on a subject which was asmuch in the public mind as the reemployment of ex-service men was particularlyinteresting. The story of what these leaders in American business had undertakento do went out to the country by mail, by word of mouth, by newspaper comment.Their example was potent in obtaining the cooperation of business menthoroughout the land. An appeal based on this action and capitalizing it wassent to thousands of individual business men and employers throughout thecountry. It was effective.An illustration which embodies most of the technical and psychological points ofinterest in the preceding incidents may be found in Lithuania’s campaign in thiscountry in 1919, for popular sympathy and official recognition. Lithuania was ofconsiderable political importance in the reorganization of Europe, but it was acountry little known or understood by the American public. An added difficultywas the fact that the independence of Lithuania would interfere seriously withthe plans which France had for the establishment of a strong Poland. There wereexcellent historical, ethnic and economic reasons why, if Lithuania broke offfrom Russia, it should be allowed to stand on its own feet. On the other handthere were powerful political influences which were against such a result. TheAmerican attitude on the question of Lithuanian independence, it was felt, wouldplay an important part. The question was how to arouse popular and officialinterest in Lithuania’s aspirations.A Lithuanian National Council was organized, composed of prominentAmerican-Lithuanians, and a Lithuanian Information Bureau established to act asa clearing house for news about Lithuania and for special pleading on behalf ofLithuania’s ambitions. The public relations counsel who was retained to directthis work recognized that the first problem to be solved was America’sindifference to and ignorance about Lithuania and its desires.He had an exhaustive study made of every conceivable aspect of the problem ofLithuania from its remote and recent history and ethnic origins to itspresent-day marriage customs and its popular recreations. He divided hismaterial into its various categories, based primarily on the public to which itwould probably make its appeal. For the amateur ethnologist he providedinteresting and accurate data of the racial origins of Lithuania. To the studentof languages he appealed with authentic and well written studies of thedevelopment of the Lithuanian language from its origins in the Sanskrit. He toldthe “sporting fan” about Lithuanian sports and told American women aboutLithuanian clothes. He told the jeweler about amber and provided the music loverwith concerts of Lithuanian music.To the senators, he gave facts about Lithuania which would give them basis forfavorable action. To the members of the House of Representatives he didlikewise. He reflected to those communities whose crystallized opinion would behelpful in guiding other opinions, facts which gave them basis for conclusionsfavorable to Lithuania.A series of events which would carry with them the desired implications wereplanned and executed. Mass meetings were held in different cities; petitionswere drawn, signed and presented; pilgrims made calls upon Senate and House ofRepresentatives Committees. All the avenues of approach to the public wereutilized to capitalize the public interest and bring public action. The mailscarried statements of Lithuania’s position to individuals who might beinterested. The lecture platform resounded to Lithuania’s appeal. Newspaperadvertising was bought and paid for. The radio carried the message of speakersto the public. Motion pictures reached the patrons of moving picture houses.Little by little and phase by phase, the public, the press and Governmentofficials acquired a knowledge of the customs, the character and the problems ofLithuania, the small Baltic nation that was seeking freedom.When the Lithuanian Information Bureau went before the press associations tocorrect inaccurate or misleading Polish news about the Lithuanian situation, itcame there as representative of a group which had figured largely in theAmerican news for a number of weeks, as a result of the advice and activities ofits public relations counsel. In the same way, when delegations of Americans,interested in the Lithuanian problem, appeared before members of Congress orofficials of the State Department, they came there as spokesmen for countrywhich was no longer unknown. They represented a group which could no longer beentirely ignored. Somebody described this campaign, once it had achievedrecognition for the Baltic republic, as the campaign of “advertising a nation tofreedom.”What happened with Romania is another instance. Romania wanted to plead its casebefore the American people. It wanted to tell Americans that it was an ancientand established country. The original technique was the issuance of treatises,historically correct and ethnologically accurate. Their facts were for the largepart ignored. The public relations counsel, called in on the case of Romania,advised them to make these studies into interesting stories of news value. Thepublic read these stories with avidity and Romania became part of America’spopular knowledge with consequent valuable results for Romania.The hotels in New York City discovered that there was a falling off of businessand profits. Fewer visitors came to New York. Fewer travelers passed through NewYork on their way to Europe. The public relations counsel who was consulted andasked to remedy the situation, made an extensive analysis. He talked tovisitors. He queried men and women who represented groups, sections and opinionsof main cities and towns throughout the country. He examined Americanliterature—books, magazines, newspapers, and classified attacks made on New Yorkand New York citizens. He found that the chief cause for lack of interest in NewYork was the belief that New York was “cold and inhospitable.”He found animosity and bitterness against New York’s apparent indifference tostrangers was keeping away a growing number of travelers. To counteract thisdamaging wave of resentment, he called together the leading groups, industrial,social and civic, of New York and formed the Welcome Stranger Committee. Thefriendly and hospitable aims of this committee, broadcasted to the nation,helped to reestablish New York’s good repute. Congratulatory editorials wereprinted in the rural and city journals of the country.Again, in analyzing the restaurant service of a prominent hotel, he discoversthat its menu is built on the desires of the average eater and that a largegroup of people with children desire special foods for them. He may then advisehis client to institute a children’s diet service.This was done specifically with the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, which institutedspecial menus for children. This move, which excited wide comment, waseconomically and dietetically sound.Its campaign to educate the public on the importance of early radium treatmentsfor incipient cancer, the United States Radium Corporation founded the FirstNational Radium Bank, in order to create and crystallize the impression thatradium is and should be available to all physicians who treat cancer sufferers.An inter-city radio company planned to open a wireless service between the threecities of New York, Detroit and Cleveland. This company might merely have openedits service and waited for the public to send its messages, but the president ofthe organization realized astutely that to succeed in any measure at all he musthave immediate public support. He called in a public relations counsel, whoadvised an elaborate inauguration ceremony, in which the mayors of the threecities thus for the first time connected, would officiate. The mayor of eachcity officially received and sent the first messages issued on commercialinter-city radio waves. These openings excited wide interest, not only in thethree cities directly concerned, but throughout the entire country.Shortly after the World War, the King and Queen of the Belgians visited America.One of the many desired results of this visit was that it should be madeapparent that America, with all the foreign elements represented in its body,was unified in its support of King Albert and his country. To present a graphicpicture of the affection which the national elements here had for the Belgianmonarch, a performance was staged at the Metropolitan Opera House in New YorkCity, at which the many nationalist groups were represented and gave voice totheir approval. The story of the Metropolitan Opera House performance was spreadin the news columns and by photographs in the press throughout the world. It wasevident to all who saw the pictures or read the story that this king had reallystirred the affectionate interest of the national elements that make up America.An interesting illustration of the broad field of work of the public relationscounsel today is noted in the efforts which were exerted to secure widecommendation and support among Americans for the League of Nations. Obviously asmall group of persons, banded together for the sole purpose of furthering theappeal of the League, would have no powerful effect. In order to secure acertain homogeneity among the members of groups who individually had widelyvaried interests and affiliations, it was decided to form a non-partisancommittee for the League of Nations.The public relations consultant, having assisted in the formation of thiscommittee, called a meeting of women representing Democratic, Republican,radical, reactionary, club, society, professional and industrial groups, andsuggested that they make a united appeal for national support of the League ofNations. This meeting accurately and dramatically reflected disinterested andunified support of the League. The public relations counsel made articulate whatwould otherwise have remained a strong passive element. The still inconsistentdemand for the League of Nations is undoubtedly due in part to efforts of thisnature.Cases as diverse as the following are the daily work of the public relationscounsel. One client is advised to give up a Rolls-Royce car and to buy a Ford,because the public has definite concepts of what ownership of eachrepresents—another man may be given the contrary advice. One client is advisedto withdraw the hat-check privilege, because it causes unfavorable publiccomments. Another is advised to change the facade of his building to conform toa certain public taste. One client is advised to announce changes of pricepolicy to the public by telegraph, another by circular, another by advertising.One client is advised to publish a Bible, another a book of French Renaissancetales.One department store is advised to use prices in its advertising, another storenot to mention them.A client is advised to make his labor policy, the hygienic aspect of hisfactory, his own personality, part of his sales campaign.Another client is advised to exhibit his wares in a museum and school.Still another is urged to found a scholarship in his subject at a leadinguniversity.Further incidents could be given here, illustrating different aspects of theordinary daily functions of the public relations counsel—how, for example, theproduction of “Damaged Goods” in America became the basis of the first notablysuccessful move in this country for overcoming the prudish refusal to appreciateand face the place of sex in human life; or how, more recently, the desire ofsome great corporations to increase their business was, through the advice ofIvy Lee, their public relations counsel, made the basis of the popular educationon the importance of brass and copper to civilization. Enough has been cited,however, to show how little the average member of the public knows of the realwork of the public relations counsel, and how that work impinges upon the dailylife of the public in an almost infinite number of ways.Popular misunderstanding of the work of the public relations counsel is easilycomprehensible because of the short period of his development. Nevertheless, thefact remains that he has become in recent years too important a figure inAmerican life for this ignorance to be safely or profitably continued."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IITHE PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSEL; THE INCREASED AND INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF THEPROFESSIONThe rise of the modern public relations counsel is based on the need for and thevalue of his services. Perhaps the most significant social, political andindustrial fact about the present century is the increased attention which ispaid to pubic opinion, not only by individuals, groups or movements that aredependent on public support for their success, but also by men and organizationswhich until very recently stood aloof from the general public and were able tosay, “The public be damned.”The public today demands information and expects also to be accepted as judgeand jury in matters that have a wide public import. The public, whether itinvests its money in subway or railroad tickets, in hotel rooms or restaurantfare, in silk or soap, is a highly sophisticated body. It asks questions, and ifthe answer in word or action is not forthcoming or satisfactory, it turns toother sources for information or relief.The willingness to spend thousands of dollars in obtaining professional adviceon how best to present one’s views or products to a public is based on thisfact.On every side of American life, whether political, industrial, social, religiousor scientific, the increasing pressure of public judgment has made itself felt.Generally speaking, the relationship and interaction of the public and anymovement is rather obvious. The charitable society which depends upon voluntarycontributions for its support has a clear and direct interest in being favorablyrepresented before the public. In the same way, the great corporation which isin danger of having its profits taxed away or its sales fall off or its freedomimpeded by legislative action must have recourse to the public to combatsuccessfully these menaces. Behind these obvious phenomena, however, lie threerecent tendencies of fundamental importance; first, the tendency of smallorganizations to aggregate into groups of such size and importance that thepublic tends to regard them as semi-public services; second, the increasedreadiness of the public, due to the spread of literacy and democratic forms ofgovernment, to feel that it is entitled to its voice in the conduct of theselarge aggregations, political, capitalist or labor, or whatever they may be;third, the keen competition for public favor due to modern methods of “selling.”An example of the first tendency—that is, the tendency toward an increasedpublic interest in industrial activity, because of the increasing socialimportance of industrial aggregations—may be found in an article on “The Criticand the Law” by Richard Washburn Child, published in the Atlantic Monthly forMay, 1906.Mr. Child discusses in that article the right of the critic to sayuncomplimentary things about matters of public interest. He points out the legalbasis for the right to criticize plays and novels. Then he adds, “A vastly moreimportant and interesting theory, and one which must arise from the presentstate and tendency of industrial conditions, is whether the acts of men incommercial activity may ever become so prominent and so far reaching in theireffect that they compel a universal public interest and that public comment isimpliedly invited by reason of their conspicuous and semi-public nature. It maybe said that at no time have private industries become of such startlinginterest to the community at large as at present in the United States.” How farpresent-day tendencies have borne out Mr. Child’s expectation of a growing sandaccepted public interest in important industrial enterprises, the reader canjudge for himself.With regard to the second tendency—the increased readiness of the public toexpect information about and to be heard on matters of political and socialinterest—Ray Stannard Baker’s description of the American journalist at thePeace Conference of Versailles gives an excellent picture. Mr. Baker tells whata shock American newspaper men gave Old World diplomats because at the Parisconference they “had come, not begging, but demanding.” They sat at everydoorway,” says Mr. Baker. “They looked over every shoulder. They wanted everyresolution and report and wanted it immediately. I shall never forget thedelegation of American newspaper men, led by John Nevlin, I saw come stridingthrough that Holy of Holies, the French Foreign Office, demanding that they beadmitted to the first general session of the Peace Conference. They horrifiedthe upholders of the old methods, they desperately offended the ancientconventions, they were as rough and direct as democracy itself.”And I shall never forget the same feeling brought home to me, when HerbertBayard Swope of the New York World, in the press room at the Crillon Hotel inParis, led the discussion of the newspaper representatives who forced theconference to regard public opinion and admit newspaper men, and give outcommuniqués daily.That the pressure of the public for admittance to the mysteries of foreignaffairs is being felt by the nations of the world may be seen from the followingdispatch published in the New York Herald under the date line of the New YorkHerald Bureau, Paris, January 17, 1922: “The success of Lord Riddell in gettingpublicity for British opinion during the Washington conference, while the Frenchviewpoint was not stressed, may result in the appointment by the PoincaréGovernment of a real propaganda agent to meet the foreign newspaper men. TheÉclair today calls on the new premier to ‘find his own Lord Riddell in theFrench diplomatic and parliamentary world, who can give the world the Frenchinterpretation.’” Walter Lippmann of the New York World in his volume PublicOpinion declares that the “significant revolution of modern times is notindustrial or economic or political, but the revolution which is taking place inthe art of creating consent among the governed.” He goes on: “Within the life ofthe new generation now in control of affairs, persuasion has become aself-conscious art and a regular organ of popular government. None of us beginsto understands the consequences, but it is no daring prophecy to say that theknowledge of how to create consent will alter every political premise. Under theimpact of propaganda, not necessarily in the sinister meaning of the worldalone, the only constants of our thinking have become variables. It is no longerpossible, for example, to believe in the cardinal dogma of democracy, that theknowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously fromthe human heart. Where we act on that theory we expose ourselves toself-deception and to forms of persuasion that we cannot verify. It has beendemonstrated that we cannot rely upon intuition, conscience, or the accidents ofcasual opinion if we are to deal with the world beyond our reach.”1[chapter1_02.html#fn_1]In domestic affairs the importance of opinion not only in political decisionsbut in the daily industrial life of the nation may be seen from numerousincidents. In the New York Times of Friday, May 20, 1922, I find almost a columnarticle with the heading “Hoover Prescribes Publicity for Coal.” Among theimprovements in the coal industry generally, which Mr. Hoover, according to thedispatch, anticipates from widespread, accurate and informative publicity aboutthe industry itself, are the stimulation of industrial consumers to more regulardemands, the ability to forecast more reliably the volume of demand, the abilityof the consumer to “form some judgment as to the prices he should pay for coal,”and the tendency to hold down over-expansion in the industry by publication ofthe ratio of production to capacity. Mr. Hoover concludes that reallyinformative publicity “would protect the great majority of operators from thecriticism that can only be properly leveled at the minority.” Not so many yearsago neither the majority nor the minority in the coal industry would haveconcerned itself about public criticism of the industry.From coal to jewelry seems rather a long step, and yet in The Jeweler’sCircular, a trade magazine, I find much comment upon the National Jewelers’Publicity Association. This association began with the simple commercialambition of acquainting the public with “the value of jewelry merchandise forgift purposes.”; now it finds itself engaged in eliminating from the public mindin general, and from the minds of legislators in particular, the impression that“the jewelry business is absolutely useless and that any money spent in ajewelry store is thrown away.”Not so long ago it would scarcely have occurred to any one in the jewelryindustry that there was any importance to be attached to the opinion of thepublic on the essential or no-essential character of the jewelry industry.Today, on the other hand, jewelers find it a profitable investment to bringbefore the people the fact that table silver is an essential in modern life, andthat without watches “the business and industries of the nation would be a sadchaos.” With all the other competing interests in the world today, the questionas to whether the public considers the business of manufacturing and sellingjewelry essential or non-essential is a matter of the first importance to theindustry.The best examples, of course, of the increasing importance of public opinion toindustries which until recently scarcely concerned themselves with the existenceor non-existence of a public opinion about them, are those industries which arecharged with a public interest.In a long article about the attitude of the public towards the railroads, theRailway Age reaches the conclusion that the most important problem whichAmerican railroads must solve is “the problem of selling themselves to thepublic.” Some public utilities maintain public relations departments, whosefunction it is to interpret the organizations to the public, as much as tointerpret the public to them. The significant thing, however, is not theaccepted importance of public opinion in this or the other individual industry,but the fact that public opinion is becoming cumulatively more and morearticulate and therefore more important to industrial life as a whole.The New York Central Railroad, for example, maintains a Public RelationsDepartment under Pitt Hand, whose function it is to make it clear to the publicthat the railroad is functioning efficiently to serve the public in everypossible way. This department studies the public and tries to discover where therailroad’s service can be mended or improved, or when wrong or harmfulimpressions upon the public mind may be corrected.This Public Relations Department finds it profitable not only to bring to theattention of the public the salient facts about its trains, its time tables, andits actual traveling facilities, but also to build up a broadly cooperativespirit that is indirectly of great value to itself and benefit to the public. Itcooperates, for example, with such movements as the Welcome Stranger Committeeof New York City in distributing literature to travelers to assist them whenthey reach the city. It cooperates with conventions, to the extent of arrangingspecial travel facilities. Such aids as it affords to the directors ofchildren’s camps at the Grand Central Station are especially conspicuous fortheir dramatic effect on the general public.Even a service which is in a large measure non-competitive must continually“sell” itself to the public, as evidenced by the strenuous efforts of the NewYork subways and elevated lines to keep themselves constantly before the peoplein the most favorable possible aspect. The subways strive in this regard tocreate a feeling of submissiveness toward inconveniences which are more or lessunavoidable, and they strive likewise to fulfill such constructive programs asthat of extending traffic on less frequented lines.Let us analyze, for example, the activities of the health departments of suchlarge cities as New York. Of recent years, Health Commissioner Royal S. Copelandand his statements have formed a fairly regular part of the day’s news.Publicity is, in fact, one of the major functions of the Health Department,inasmuch as its constructive work depends to a considerable extent upon thepublic education it provides in combating evils and in building up a spirit ofindividual and group cooperation in all health matters. When the HealthDepartment recognizes that such diseases as cancer, tuberculosis and thosefollowing malnutrition are due generally to ignorance or neglect and thatamelioration or prevention will be the result of knowledge, it is the nextlogical step for this department to devote strenuous efforts to its publicrelations campaign. The department accordingly does exactly this.Even governments today act upon the principle that it is not sufficient togovern their own citizens well and to assure the people that they are actingwhole-heartedly in their behalf. They understand that the public opinion of theentire world is important to their welfare. Thus Lithuania, already noted, whileit had the unbounded love and support of its own people, was nevertheless indanger of extinction because it was unknown outside of the immediate boundariesof those nations which had a personal interest in it. Lithuania was wanted byPoland; it was wanted by Russia. It was ignored by other nations. Therefore,through the aid of a public relations expert, Lithuania issued pamphlets, itparaded, it figured in pictures and motion pictures and developed a favorablesentiment throughout the world that in the end gave Lithuania its freedom.In industry and business, of course, there is another consideration offirst-rate importance, besides the danger of interference by the public in theconduct of the industry—the increasing intensity of competition. Business andsales are no longer to be had, if ever they were to be had for the asking. Itmust be clear to any one who has looked through the mass of advertising instreet cars, subways, newspapers and magazines, and the other avenues ofapproach to the public, that products and services press hard upon one anotherin the effort to focus public attention on their offerings and to inducefavorable action.The keen competition in the selling of products for public favor makes itimperative that the seller consider other things than merely his product intrying to build up a favorable public reaction. He must either himself appraisethe public mind and his relation to it or he must engage the services of anexpert who can aid him to do this. He may today consider, for instance, in hissales campaign, not only the quality of his soap but the working conditions, thehours of labor, even the living conditions of the men who make it.The public relations counsel must advise him on these factors as well as on thepresentation to the public most interested in them.In this state of affairs it is not at all surprising that industrial leadersshould give the closest attention to public relations in both the broadest andthe most practical concept of the term.Large industrial groups, in their associations, have assigned a definite placeto public relations bureaus.The Trade Association Executives in New York, an association of individualexecutives of state, territorial or national trade associations, such as theAllied Wall Paper Industry, the American Hardware Manufacturers’ Association,the American Protective Tariff League, the Atlantic Coast Shipbuilders’Association, the National Association of Credit Men, the Silk Association ofAmerica and some seventy-four others, includes among its associations’ functionssuch activities as the following: cooperative advertising; adjustments andcollections; cost accounting; a credit bureau; distribution and new markets;educational, standardization and research work; exhibits; a foreign tradebureau; house organs; general publicity; an industrial bureau; legislative work;legal aid; market reports; statistics; a traffic department; Washingtonrepresentation; arbitration. It is noteworthy that forty of these associationshave incorporated public relations with general publicity as a definite part oftheir program in furthering the interest of their organizations.The American Telephone and Telegraph Company devotes effort to studying itspubic relations problems, not only to increase its volume of business, but alsoto create a cooperative spirit between itself and the public. The work of thetelephone company’s operators, statistics, calls, lineage, installations aregiven to the public in various forms. During the war and for a period afterwardsits main problem was that of satisfying the public that its service wasnecessarily below standard because of the peculiar national conditions. Thepublic, in response to the efforts of the company, which were analogous to agracious personal apology, accepted more or less irksome conditions as a matterof course. Had the company not cared about the public, the public wouldundoubtedly have been unpleasantly insistent upon a maintenance of the pre-warstandards of service.Americans were once wont to jest about the dependence of France and Switzerlandupon the tourist trade. Today we see American cities competing, as part of theirpublic relations programs, for conventions, fairs and conferences. The New YorkTimes printed some time ago an address by the governor of Nebraska, in which hetold a group of advertising men that publicity had made Nebraska prosper.The New York Herald carried an editorial recently, entitled, “It pays a state toadvertise,” centering about the campaign of the state of Vermont to presentitself favorably to public attention. According to the editorial, the statepublishes a magazine, The Vermonter, an attractive publication filled withinteresting illustrations and well-written text. It is devoted exclusively torevealing in detail the industrial and agricultural resources of the state andto presenting Vermont’s strikingly beautiful scenic attractions for the summervisitor. Similar instances of elaborate efforts, taking the form of action orthe printed word, either to obtain public attention or to obtain a favorableattitude from the public for individual industries and groups of industries,will come readily to the reader’s mind.Without attempting to take too seriously an amusing story printed in a recentissue of a New York newspaper, leaders in movements and industries of modernlife will be inclined to agree with the protagonist of publicity spoken of.According to the story, a man set out to prove to another that it was not somuch what a man did as the way it was heralded which insures his place inhistory. He cited Barbara Frietchie, Evangeline, John Smith and a half dozenothers as instances to prove that they are remembered not for what they did, butbecause they had excellent counsel on their public relations.“‘Very good,’ agreed the friend. “But show me a case where a person who hasreally done a big thing has been overlooked.’“‘You know Paul Revere, of course,’ he said. ‘But tell me the names of the twoother fellows who road that night to rouse the countryside with the news thatthe British were coming.’“‘Never heard of them,’ was the answer.“‘There were three waiting to see the signal hung in the tower of the Old NorthChurch,’ he said. ‘Every one of them was mounted and spurred just as Mr.Longfellow described Paul Revere. They all got the signal. They all rode andwaked the farmers, spreading the warning. Afterward one of them was an officerin Washington’s army, another became governor of one of the States. Not one intwenty thousand Americans ever heard the names of the other two, and there ishardly a person in America who does not know all about Revere.’“Did Revere make history or did Longfellow?’”1. [chapter1_02.html#fn_ch1] Walter Lippman, Public Opinion, Page248."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIITHE FUNCTION OF A SPECIAL PLEADERPublic opinion has entered life at many points as a decisive factor. Men andmovements whose interests will be affected by the attitude of the public aretaking pains to have themselves represented in the court of public opinion bythe most skillful counselors they can obtain. The business of the publicrelations counted is somewhat like the business of the attorney—to advise hisclient and to litigate his causes for him.While the special pleader in law, the lawyer for the defense, has always beenaccorded a formal hearing by judge and jury, this has not been the case beforethe court of public opinion. Here mob psychology, the intolerance of humansociety for a dissenting point of view, have made it difficult and oftendangerous for a man to plead for a new or unpopular cause.The Fourth Estate, a newspaper for the makers of newspapers says: “‘Counsel onpublic relations’ and ‘director of public relations’ are two terms that arebeing encountered more often every day. There is a familiar tinge to them, in away, but in justice to the men who bear these titles and to the concerns whichemploy them, it should be said that they are—or can be—dissociated from the oldidea of ‘publicity man.’ The very fact that many of the largest corporations inthe country are recognizing the need of maintaining right relationships with thepublic is alone important enough to assure a fair and even favorable hearing fortheir public relations department.“Whether a man is really entitled to the appellation ‘counsel on publicrelations’ or whether he should merely be called ‘publicity man’ rests entirelywith the individual and the firm that employs him. As we see it, a man who isreally counsel or director of public relations has one of the most importantjobs on the roster of any concern; but a man who merely represents the old ideaof getting something for nothing from publishers is about passé.…“So there is made plain the difference between two terms, the old and the new,both of which have occasioned much natural curiosity among newspaper men. WhenNapoleon said, ‘Circumstance? I make circumstance,’ he expressed very nearly thespirit of the public relations counsel’s work. So long as this new professionalbranch live up to the possibilities that their title suggests, they are bound toaccomplish general constructive good. Maybe they, at last, will make us forgetthat ingratiating though insidious individual, the publicity man.”As indicative perhaps of the growing importance of the profession, an article byMary Swain Routzahn, in charge of the Department of Surveys and Exhibits of theRussell Sage Foundation, on “Woman’s Chance as Publicity Specialist” publishedin the New York Globe of August 2, 1921, discusses the profession as one ofrecent development, but of such importance as to deserve the seriousconsideration of women who are interested in making a professional career forthemselves.The public relations counsel is first of all a student. His field of study isthe public mind. His text books for this study are the facts of life; thearticles printed in newspapers and magazines, the advertisements that areinserted in publications, the billboards that line the streets, the railroadsand the highways, the speeches that are delivered in legislative chambers, thesermons issuing from pulpits, anecdotes related in smoking rooms, the gossip ofWall Street, the patter of the theater and the conversation of other men who,like them, are interpreters and must listen for the clear or obscureenunciations of the public.He brings the talent of his intuitive understanding to the aid of his practicaland psychological tests and surveys. But he is not only a student. He is apractitioner with a wide range of instruments and a definite technique for theiruse.First of all, there are the circumstances and events he helps to create. Afterthat there are the instruments by which he broadcasts facts and ideas to thepublic; advertising, motion pictures, circular letters, booklets, handbills,speeches, meetings, parades, news articles, magazine articles and whatever othermediums there are through which public attention is reached and influenced.Now sensitiveness to the state of mind of the public is a difficult thing toachieve or maintain. Any man can tell you with more or less accuracy andclearness his own reactions on any particular issue. But few men have the timeor the interest or the training to develop a sense of what other persons thinkor feel abut the same issue. In his own profession the skilled practitioner issensitive and understanding. The lawyer can tell what argument will appeal tocourt or jury. The salesman can tell what points to stress to his prospectivebuyers. The politician can tell what to emphasize to his audience, but theability to estimate group reactions on a large scale over a wide geographic andpsychological area is a specialized ability which must be developed with thesame painstaking self-criticism and with the same dependence on experience thatare required for the development of the clinical sense in the doctor or thesurgeon.Of course, the public relations counsel employs all those practical means ofgauging the public mind which modern advertising has developed and uses. Heemploys the research campaign, the symposium, the survey of a particular groupor of a particular state of mind as a further aid, and confirmation ormodification of his own appraisals and judgments.Charles J. Rosebault, the author of an article in the New York Times recently,headed “Men Who Wield the Spotlight,” remarks that the competent publicrelations counsel has generally had some newspaper training and that the valueof this training “is a keen sense of the likes and dislikes of what we call thepublic—that is, the average of men and women. The needle of the compass is nomore sensitive to direction, nor the mercury of the thermometer to variations ofheat and cold than is this expert to the influence of publicity upon the mindand emotions of the man in the street.”It is not surprising that the growing interest of the public in men andmovements should have led to the spontaneous creation of the new profession.We have presented here, in very broad outline, a picture of the fundamental workof the public relations counsel and of the fundamental conditions which haveproduced him. On the one hand, a complex environment of which only small,disconnected portions are available to different persons; on the other hand, thegreat and increasing importance either of making one’s case accessible to thepublic mind or of determining whether that case will impinge favorably orunfavorably upon the public mind—these two conditions, taken together, haveresulted inevitably in the public relations counsel. Mr. Lippmann finds in thesefacts the underlying reason for the existence of what he calls the “pressagent.” “The enormous discretion,” he says, “as to what facts and whatimpressions shall be reported is steadily convincing every organized group ofpeople that, whether it wishes to secure publicity or to avoid it, the exerciseof discretion cannot be left to the reporter. It is safer to hire a press agentwho stands between the group and the newspapers.”1 [chapter1_03.html#fn_1]It is clear that the popular impression of the scope and functions of thecounsel on public relations must be radically revised if any accurate picture ofthe profession is to be looked for. The public relations counsel is the linealdescendent, to be sure, of the circus advance-man and of the semi-journalistpromoter of small-part actresses. The economic conditions which have producedhim, however, made his profession the important one it is today, have inthemselves materially changed the character of his work.His primary function now is not to bring his clients by chance to the public’sattention, nor to extricate them form difficulties into which they have alreadydrifted, but to advise his clients how positive results can be accomplished inthe field of public relations and to keep them from drifting inadvertently intounfortunate or harmful situations. The public relations counsel will find thatthe conditions under which his client operates, be it a government, amanufacturer of food products or a railroad system, are constantly changing andthat he must advise modifications in policy in accordance with such changes inthe public point of view. As such, the public relations counsel must be alive tothe events of the day—not only the events that are printed but the events whichare forming hour by hour, as reported in the words that are spoken on thestreet, in the smoking cars, in the school room, or expressed in any of theother forms of thought communication that make up public opinion.So long as the press remains the greatest single medium for reaching the publicmind, the work of the public relations counsel will necessarily have closecontacts with the work of the journalist. He transmits his ideas, however,through all those mediums which help to build public opinion—the radio, thelecture platform, advertising, the stage, the motion picture, the mails. On theother hand, he is becoming today as much of an adviser on actions as he is thecommunicator of these actions to the public.The public relations consultant is ideally a constructive force in thecommunity. The results of his work are often accelerated interest in matters ofvalue and importance to the social, economic or political life of the community.The public relations counsel is the pleader to the public point of view. He actsin this capacity as a consultant both in interpreting the public to his clientand in helping to interpret his client to the public. He helps to mould theaction of his client as well as to mould public opinion.His profession is in a state of evolution. His future must depend as much uponthe growing realization by the public of the responsibility to the public ofindividuals, institutions and organizations as upon the public relationscounsel’s own realization of the importance of his work.1.

Mr. Lippman goes on tosay that “having hired him, the temptation to exploit his strategic position isvery great.” As to that aspect of the situation, see later chapters."},{"pageContent":"PART IITHE GROUP AND HERD"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IWHAT CONSTITUTES PUBLIC OPINION?The character and origins of public opinion, the factors that make up theindividual mind and the group mind must be understood if the profession ofpublic relations counsel is to be intelligently practiced and its functions andpossibilities accurately estimated. Society must understand the fundamentalcharacter of the work he is doing, if for no other reason than its own welfare.The public relations counsel works with that vague, little-understood,indefinite material called public opinion.Public opinion is a term describing an ill-defined, mercurial and changeablegroup of individual judgments. Public opinion is the aggregate result ofindividual opinions—now uniform, now conflicting—of the men and women who makeup society or any group of society. In order to understand public opinion, onemust go back to the individual who makes up the group.The mental equipment of the average individual consists of a mass of judgmentson most of the subjects which touch his daily physical or mental life. Thesejudgments are the tools of his daily being and yet they are his judgments, noton a basis of research and logical deduction, but for the most part dogmaticexpressions accepted on the authority of his parents, his teachers, his church,and of his social, his economic and other leaders.The public relations counsel must understand the social implications of anindividual’s thoughts and actions. Is it, for example, purely an accident that aman belongs to one church rather than another or to any other church at all? Isit an accident that makes Boston women prefer brown eggs and New York womenwhite eggs? What are the factors that work in favor of conversion of a man fromone political party to another or form one type of food to another?Why do certain communities resist the prohibition law—why do others abide by it?Why is it difficult to start a new party movement—or to fight cancer? Why is itdifficult to fight for sex education? Why does the free trader denounceprotectionism, and vice versa?If we had to form our own judgments on every matter, we should all have to findout many things for ourselves which we now take for granted. We should not cookour food or live in houses—in fact, we should revert to primitive living.The public relations counsel must deal with the fact that persons who havelittle knowledge of a subject almost invariably form definite and positivejudgments upon that subject.“If we examine the mental furniture of the average man,” says William Trotter,the author of a comprehensive study of the social psychology of the individual,1[chapter2_01.html#fn_1] “we shall find it made up of a vast number of judgmentsof a very precise kind upon subjects of very great variety, complexity, anddifficulty. He will have fairly settled views upon the origin and nature of theuniverse, and upon what he will probably call its meaning; he will haveconclusions as to what is to happen to him at death and after, as to what is andwhat should be the basis of conduct. He will know how the country should begoverned, and why it is going to the dogs, why this piece of legislation is goodand that bad. He will have strong views upon military and naval strategy, theprinciples of taxation, the use of alcohol and vaccination, the treatment ofinfluenza, the prevention of hydrophobia, upon municipal trading, the teachingof Greek, upon what is permissible in art, satisfactory in literature, andhopeful in science.“The bulk of such opinions must necessarily be without rational basis, sincemany of them are concerned with problems admitted by the expert to be stillunsolved, while as to the rest it is clear that the training and experience ofno average man can qualify him to have any opinion upon them at all. Therational method adequately used would have told him that on the great majorityof these questions there could be for him but one attitude—that of suspendedjudgment.”The reader will recall from his own experience an almost infinite number ofinstances in which the amateur has been fully prepared to deliver expert adviceand to give final judgment in matters upon which his ignorance is patent toevery one except himself.In the Middle Ages, society was convinced that there were witches. People wereso positive that they burned people whom they suspected of witchcraft. Todaythere is an equal number of people who believe just as firmly, one way or theother, about spiritualism and spirits. They do not burn mediums. But people whohave made no research of the subject pass strong denunciatory judgments. Others,no better informed, consider mediums divinely inspired. Not so long ago everyintelligent man knew that the world was flat. Today the average man has a beliefjust as firm and unknowing in the mysterious force which he has heard calledatomic energy.It is axiomatic that men who know little are often intolerant of a point of viewthat is contrary to their own. The bitterness that has been brought about byarguments on public questions is proverbial. Lovers have been parted by bitterquarrels on theories of pacificism or militarism; and when an argument upon anabstract question engages opponents they often desert the main line of argumentsin order to abuse each other.How often this is true can be seen from the congressional records ofcontroversies in which the personal attack supersedes logic. In a recent fightagainst the proposed tariff measures, a protagonist of protection published longvindictive statements, in which he tried to confound the character and thedisinterestedness of his opponents. Logically his discussion should have beenbased only upon the sound economic, social and political value of the bill aspresented.A hundred leading American bankers, businessmen, professional men and economistsunited in public disapproval of this plan. They stated their opinion that the“American” Valuation Plan, as it was called, would endanger the prosperity ofthe country, that it would be inimical to our foreign relations and that itwould injure the welfare of every country with whom our commercial andindustrial ties were at all close. This group was a broadly representative groupof men and women, yet the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee accused allthese people of acting upon motives of personal gain and lack of patriotism.Prejudice superseded logic.Intolerance is almost inevitably accompanied by a natural and true inability tocomprehend or make allowance for opposite points of view. The skilled scientistwho may be receptive to any promising suggestion in his own field may outside ofhis own field be found quite unwilling to make any attempt at understanding apoint of view contrary to his own. In politics, for example, his understandingof the problem may be fragmentary, yet he will enter excitedly into discussionson bonus and ship subsidy, of which he has made no study. We find here withsignificant uniformity what one psychologist has called “logic-proofcompartments.”The logic-proof compartment has always been with us. Scientists have lost theirlives through refusing to see flaws in their theories. Intelligent mothers givefood to their babies that they would manifestly forbid other mothers to givetheir children. Especially significant is the tendency of races to maintainreligious beliefs and customs long after these have lost their meaning. Dietarylaws, hygienic laws, even laws based upon geographical conditions that have beenchanged for more than a thousand years are still maintained in the logic-proofcompartment of dogmatic adherence. There is a story that certain missionariesgive money to heathen at the time of conversion and that the heathen, having gottheir money, bathe away their conversion in sacred streams.The characteristic of the human mind to adhere to its beliefs is excellentlysummarized in the volume by Mr. Trotter to which reference has been made before.“It is clear,”2 [chapter2_01.html#fn_2] says Mr. Trotter, “at the outset thatthese beliefs are invariably regarded as rational and defended as such, while,the position of one who holds contrary views is held to be obviouslyunreasonable.“The religious man accuses the atheist of being shallow and irrational, and ismet by a similar reply. To the Conservative the amazing thing about the Liberalis his incapacity to see reason and accept the only possible solution of publicproblems. Examination reveals the fact that the differences are not due to thecommission of the mere mechanical fallacies of logic, since these are easilyavoided, even by the politician, and since there is no reason to believe thatone party in such controversies is less logical than the other. The differenceis due rather to the fundamental assumptions of the antagonists being hostile,and these assumptions are derived from herd-suggestions; to the Liberal certainbasal conceptions have acquired the quality of instinctive truth, have become apriori syntheses, because of the accumulated suggestions to which he has beenexposed; and a similar explanation applies to the atheist, the Christian, andthe Conservative. Each, it is important to remember, finds in consequence therationality of his position flawless and is quite incapable of detecting in itthe fallacies which are obvious to his opponent, to whom that particular seriesof assumptions has not been rendered acceptable by herd suggestion.”Thus the public relations counsel has to consider the a prori judgment of anypublic he deals with before counseling any step that would modify those thingsin which the public has established belief.It is seldom effective to call names or to attempt to discredit the beliefsthemselves. The counsel on public relations, after examination of the sources ofestablished beliefs, must either discredit the old authorities or create newauthorities by making articulate a mass opinion against the old belief or infavor of the new.1.

On the one hand is theprofound belief that “you can’t change human nature.” On the other hand is theequally firm assurance that certain well-defined institutions modify and alterpublic opinion.There is a uniformity of opinion in this country upon many issues. When thisuniformity accords with our own beliefs we call it an expression of the publicconscience. When, however, it runs contrary to our beliefs we call itregimentation of the public mind and are inclined to ascribe it to insidiouspropaganda.Uniformity is, in fact, largely natural and only partly artificial. Publicopinion may be as much the producer of “insidious propaganda” as its product.Naturally enough, where broad ideas are involved, criticisms of the state of thepublic’s mind and of its origin come most frequently from groups that are out ofsympathy with the accepted point of view. They find the public unreceptive totheir point of view, and justly or unjustly they attribute this to the influenceof antagonistic interests upon the public mind.These groups see the press, the lecture platform, the schools, theadvertisements, the churches, the radio, the motion picture screen, themagazines daily reaching millions. They see that the preponderant point of viewin most, if not all, these institutions conforms to the preponderant state ofmind of the public.They argue from the one to the other and reach their conclusions without muchdifficulty. They do not stop to think that agreement in point of view betweenthe public and these institutions may often be the result of the controlexercised by the public mind over these institutions.Many outside forces, however, do go to influence pubic opinion. The most obviousof these forces are parental influence, the school room, the press, motionpictures, advertising, magazines, lectures, the church, the radio.To answer the question as to the stubbornness or malleability of the public, letus analyze the press in its relation to public opinion, since the press standspreeminent among the various institutions which are commonly designated asleaders or molders of the public mind. By the press, in this instance, I meanthe daily press. Americans are a newspaper-reading public. They have becomeaccustomed to look to their morning and evening papers for the news of the worldand for the opinions of their leaders. And while the individual newspaper readerdoes not give a very considerable portion of his day to this occupation, manypersons find time to read more than one newspaper every day.It is not surprising that the man who is outside the current of prevailingpublic opinion should regard the daily press as a coercive force.Discussions of the public’s reaction to the press are two-sided, just as are thediscussions of the influence of the pulpit or other forces. Some authoritieshold that the public mind is stubborn in regard to the press and that the presshas little influence upon it. There are graphic instances of the stubbornness ofthe public point of view. A most interesting example is the reelection of MayorHaylan of New York by an overwhelming majority in the face of the opposition ofall but two of the metropolitan dailies. It is also noteworthy that in 1909,Gaynor was elected Mayor New York with every paper except one opposing hiscandidacy. Likewise, Mayor Mitchel of New York was defeated for reelection in1917, although all the New York papers except two Hearst papers and the New YorkCall supported him. In Boston, in a recent election, a man was elected as mayorwho had been convicted of a penal offense, and elected in the face of thepractically united opposition of all the newspapers of that city. How would suchauthors as Everett Dean Martin, Walter Lippmann and Upton Sinclair explain theseincidents? How, on the theory of the regimentation of the public mind by thedaily press, can such thinkers explain the sharpness with which the publicsometimes rejects the advocacies of a united press? These instances are notfrequent; but they show that other influences beside the press enter into themaking of a public opinion and that these forces must never be disregarded inthe estimate of the quality and stability of a prevalent public opinion.Francis E. Leupp, writing in the Atlantic Monthly for February, 1910, on “TheWaning Power of the Press,” remarks that Mayor Gaynor’s comments shortly afterhis election in 1909 “led up to the conclusion that in our common sensegeneration nobody cares what the newspapers say.” Mr. Leupp continues:“Unflattering as such a verdict may be, probably the majority of a community ifpolled as a jury would concur in it. The airy dismissal of some proposition as‘mere newspaper talk’ is heard at every social gathering until one who isbrought up to regard the press as a mighty factor in modern civilization istempted to wonder whether it has actually lost the power it used to wield amongus.”And H.L. Mencken, writing in the same magazine for March, 1914, declares that“one of the principal marks of an educated man, indeed, is the fact that he doesnot take his opinions from newspapers—not, at any rate, from the militant,crusading newspapers. On the contrary, his attitude toward them is almost alwaysone of frank cynicism, with indifference as its mildest form and contempt as itscommonest. He knows that they are constantly falling into false reasoning aboutthe things within his personal knowledge,—that is, within the narrow circle ofhis special education,—and so he assumes that they make the same, or even worse,errors about other things, whether intellectual or moral. This assumption, itmay be said, is quite justified by the facts.”The second point of view holds that the daily press and the other leading forcesmerely accept, reflect and intensify established public opinion and are,therefore, responsible for the uniformity of public reaction. A vivid statementof the point of view of the man who typifies this group is found in Everett DeanMartin’s volume on The Behavior of Crowds. He says:1 [chapter2_02.html#fn_1]“The modern man has in the printing press a wonderfully effective means forperpetuating crowd-movements and keeping great masses of people constantly underthe sway of certain crowd-ideas. Every crowd-group has its magazines, pressagents, and special ‘literature’ with which it continually harangues its membersand possible converts. Many books, and especially certain works of fiction ofthe ‘best seller’ type, are clearly reading mob phenomena.”There is a third group which perhaps comes nearer the truth, which holds thatthe press, just as other mediums of education or dissemination, brings about avery definite change in public opinion. A most graphic illustration of what suchmediums can do to change opinions upon fundamental and important matters is thewoman suffrage question and its victory over established points of view. Thepress, the pulpit, the lecture platform, the motion pictures and the othermediums for reaching the public brought about a complete popular conversion.Other examples of the change that may be brought about in public opinion in thisway, by such institutions of authority, is the present attitude towards birthcontrol and towards health education.Naturally the press, like other institutions which present facts or opinions, isrestricted, often unconsciously, sometimes consciously, by various controllingconditions. Certain people talk of the censorship enacted by the prejudices andpredispositions of the public itself. Some, such as Upton Sinclair, ascribe tothe advertisers a conscious and powerful control of publications. Others, likeWalter Lippmann, find that an effective barrier between the public and the eventexists in the powerful influence which, he says, is exerted in certain cases onthe press by the so-called quality public which the newspapers’ advertiserswhich to reach and among whom the newspapers must circulate if the advertisingis to be successful. Mr. Lippmann observes that although such a restriction mayexist, much of what may be attributed to censorship in the newspaper, often isactually inadequate presentation of the events it seeks to describe.On this point he says:2 [chapter2_02.html#fn_2] “It follows that in thereporting of strikes, the easiest way is to let the news be uncovered by theovert act, and to describe the event as the story of the interference with thereader’s life. This is where his attention is first aroused and his interestmost easily enlisted. A great deal, I think myself, of the crucial part of whatlooks to the worker and the reformer as deliberate misrepresentation on the partof newspapers, is the direct outcome of a practical difficulty in uncovering thenews, and the emotional difficulty of making distinct facts interesting unless,as Emerson says, we can ‘perceive’ (them) and can ‘set about translating (them)at once into parallel facts.’”In view then of the possibility of a malleable public opinion the counsel onpublic relations, desiring to obtain a hearing for any given cause, simplyutilizes existent channels to obtain expression for the point of view herepresents. How this is done will be considered later.Because of the importance of channels of thought communication, it is vital forthe public relations counsel to study carefully the relationship between publicopinion and the organs that maintain it or that influence it to change. We shalllook into this interaction and its effect in the next chapter.1. [chapter2_02.html#fn_ch1] Page 45.2. [chapter2_02.html#fn_ch2] Public Opinion (page 350)."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIITHE INTERACTION OF PUBLIC OPINION WITH THE FORCES THAT HELP TO MAKE ITThe public and the press, or for that matter, the public and any force thatmodifies pubic opinion, interact. Action and interaction are continually goingon between the forces projected out to the public and the public itself. Thepublic relations counsel must understand this fact in its broadest and mostdetailed implications. He must understand not only what these various forcesare, but he must be able to evaluate their relative powers with fair accuracy.Let us consider again the case of a newspaper, as representative of othermediums of communications.“We print,” says the New York Times, “all news that’s fit to print.” Immediatelythe question arises (as Elmer Davis, the historian of the Times tells us that itdid when the motto was first adopted) what news is fit to print? By whatstandard is the editorial decision reached which includes one kind of news andexcludes another kind? The Times itself has not been, in its long andconspicuously successful career, entirely free from difficulties on this point.Thus in “The History of the New York Times,” Mr. Davis feels the need forjustifying the extent to which that paper featured Theodore Tilton’s actionagainst the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher for alienation of Mrs. Tilton’s affectionsand his conduct with her. Mr. Davis says (pages 124-125): “No doubt a good manyreaders of the Times thought the paper was giving an undue amount of space tothis chronicle of sin and suffering. Those complaints come often enough even inthese days from readers who appreciate the paper’s general reluctance to displaynews of this sort, and wonder why a good general rule should occasionally beviolated. But there was a reason in the Beecher case, as there has usually beena reason in similar affairs since. Dr. Beecher was one of the most prominentclergymen in the country; there was a natural curiosity as to whether he waspracticing what he preached. One of the counsel at the trial declared that ‘allChristendon was hanging on its outcome.’ Full reporting off its course was not amere pandering to vulgar curiosity, but a recognition of the value of the caseas news.”The simple fact that such a slogan can exist and be accepted is for our purposean important point. Somewhere there must be a standard to which the editors ofthe Times can conform, as well as a larger clientele of constant readers to whomthat standard is satisfactory. “Fit” must be defined by the editors of the Timesin a way which meets with the approval of enough persons to enable the paper tomaintain its reading public. As soon, however, as the definition is attempted,difficulties arise.Professor W.G. Bleyer, in an article in his book on journalism, first stressesthe importance of completeness in the news columns of a paper, then goes on tosay that “the only important limitations to completeness are those imposed bythe commonly accepted ideas of decency embodied in the words, ‘All the newsthat’s fit to print’ and by the rights of privacy. Carefully edited newspapersdiscriminate between what the public is entitled to know and what an individualhas a right to keep private.”On the other hand, when Professor Bleyer attempts to define what news is fit toprint and what the public is entitled to know, he discusses generalizationscapable of wide and frequently inconsistent interpretation. “News,” says he, “isanything timely which is significant to newspaper readers in their relations tothe community, the state and the nation.”Who is to determine what is significant and what is not? Who is to decide whichof the individual’s relations to the community are safeguarded by his right ofprivacy and which are not? Such a definition tells us nothing more definite thandoes the slogan which it attempts to define. We must look further for a standardby which these definitions are applied. There must be a consensus of publicopinion on which the newspaper falls back for its standards.The truth is that while it appears to be forming the public opinion onfundamental matters, the press is often conforming to it.It is the office of the public relations counsel to determine the interactionbetween the public, and the press and the other mediums affecting publicopinion. It is as important to conform to the standards of the organ whichprojects ideas as it is to present to this organ such ideas as will conform tothe fundamental understanding and appreciation of the public to which they areultimately to appeal. There is as much truth in the proposition that the publicleads institutions as in the contrary proposition that the institutions lead thepublic.As an illustration of the manner in which newspapers are inclined to accept thejudgments of their readers in presenting material to them, we have this anecdotewhich Rollo Ogden tells in the Atlantic Monthly for July, 1906, about a letterwhich Wendell Phillips wished to have published in a Boston paper.“The editor read it over, and said, ‘Mr. Phillips, that is a very good andinteresting letter, and I shall be glad to publish it; but I wish you wouldconsent to strike out the last paragraph.’“Why,’ said Phillips, ‘that paragraph is the precise thing for which I wrote thewhole letter. Without that it would be pointless.’“Oh, I see that,’ replied the editor; ‘and what you say is perfectly true! Ifully agree with it all myself. Yet it is one of those things which will not doto say publicly. However, if you insist upon it, I will publish it as itstands.’“It was published the next morning, and along with it a short editorialreference to it, saying that a letter from Mr. Phillips would be found inanother column, and that it was extraordinary that so keen a mind as his shouldhave fallen into the palpable absurdity contained in the last paragraph.”Recognition of this fact comes from a number of different sources. H. L. Menckenrecognizes that the public runs the press as much as the press runs the public.“The primary aim of all of them,” says Mr. Mencken,1 [chapter2_03.html#fn_1]“not less when they play the secular Iokanaan than when they play the merenewsmonger, was to please the crowd, and to give a good show; and the way theyset about giving that good show was by first selecting a deserving victim, andthen putting him magnificently to the torture.“This was their method when they were performing for their own profit only, whentheir one motive was to make the public read their paper; but it was still theirmotive when they were battling bravely and unselfishly for the public good, andso discharging the highest duty of their profession.”There are interesting, if somewhat obscure examples of the complementary workingof various forces. In the field of the motion pictures, for example, theproducers, the actors, and the press, in their support, have continually waged abattle against censorship. Undoubtedly censorship of the motion pictures is inits practical workings an economic and artistic handicap. Censorship, however,will continue in spite of the producers as long as there is a willingness on thepart of the public to accept this censorship. The public, on the whole, hasrefused to join the fight against censorship, because there is a more or lessarticulate belief that children, if not women, should be protected from seeingshocking sights, such as murders visibly enacted, the taking of drugs,immoralities and other acts which might offend or suggest harmful imitation.“Damaged Goods,” before its presentation to America in 1913, was analyzed by thepublic relations counsel, who helped to produce the play. He recognized thatunless that part of the public sentiment which believed in education and truthcould be lifted from that part of public opinion which condemned the mentioningof sex matters, “Damaged Goods” would fail. The producers, therefore, did nottry to educate the public by presenting this play as such, but allowed groupleaders amd groups interested in education to come to the support of Brieux’sdrama and, in a sense, to sponsor the production.Proof that the public and the institutions that make public opinion interact isshown in instances in which books were stifled because of popular disapproval atone time and then brought forward by popular demand at a later time when publicopinion had altered. Religious and very early scientific works are among suchbooks.A more recent instance is the announcement made by Judge, a weekly magazine,that it would support the fight for light wine and beer. Judge took this standbecause it believed in the principle of personal freedom and also because itdeemed that public sentiment was in favor of light wine and beer as a substitutefor absolute prohibition. Judge believed its stand would please its readers.Presumably writing of newspaper morality, Mr. Mencken, in his article justquoted, finds at the end of it that he has “written of popular morality verycopiously, and of newspaper morality very little.“But,” says Mr. Mencken, “as I have said before, the one is the other. Thenewspaper must adapt its pleading to its clients’ moral limitation just as thetrial lawyer also must adapt his pleading to the jury’s limitations. Neither maylike the job, but both must face it to gain the larger end.”Writing on the other hand from the point of view of the man who feels that thepublic taste requires no justification, Ralph Pulitzer nevertheless agrees withMr. Mencken that the opinion of the press is set by the public; and he justifies“muckraking”2 [chapter2_03.html#fn_2] by finding it neither “extraordinary norculpable that people and press should be more interested in the polemical thanin the platitudinous; in blame than in painting the lily; in attack than insending laudatory coals to Newcastle.”Even Mr. Leupp3 [chapter2_03.html#fn_3] concludes that “whatever we may say ofthe modern press on its less commendable side, we are bound to admit thatnewspapers, like governments, fairly reflect the people they serve. CharlesDudley Warner once went so far as to say that no matter how objectionable thecharacter of a paper may be, it is always a trifle better than the patrons onwhom it relies for its support.”Similarly, from an unusually wide experience on a paper as highly considered,perhaps, as any in America, Rollo Ogden claims this give and take between thepublic and the press is vital to a just conception of American journalism.“The editor does not nonchalantly project his thoughts into the void. He listensfor the echo of his words. His reaction to his supporters is not unlikeGladstone’s definition of the intimate connection between the orator and hisaudience. As the speaker gets from his hearers in mist what he gives back inshower, so the newspaper receives from the public as well as it gives back toit. Too often it gets as dust what it gives back as mud; but that does not alterthe relations. Action and reaction are all the while going on between the pressand its patrons.Hence it follows that the responsibility for the more crying evils of journalismmust be divided.”4 [chapter2_03.html#fn_4]This same interaction goes on in connection with all the other forces that mouldpublic opinion. The preacher upholds the ideals of society. He leads his flockwither they indicate a willingness to be led. Ibsen creates a revolution whensociety is ripe for it. The public responds to finer music and better motionpictures and demands improvements. “Give the people what they want” is only halfsound. What they want and what they get are fused by some mysterious alchemy.The press, the lecturer, the screen and the public lead and are led by eachother.1.

A middleground exists between the hypothesis that the public is stubborn and thehypothesis that it is malleable. To a large degree the press, the schools, thechurches, motion pictures, advertising, the lecture platform and radio allconform to the demands of the public. But to an equally large degree the publicresponds to the influence of these very same mediums of communication.Some analysts believe that the public has no opinions except those which variousinstitutions provide ready made for it. From Mr. Mencken and others it wouldalmost seem to follow that newspapers and other mediums have no standards exceptthose which the public provides, and that therefore they are substantiallywithout influence upon the public mind. The truth of the matter, as I havepointed out, lies somewhere between these two extreme positions.In other words, the public relations counsel who thinks clearly on the problemof public opinion and public relations will credit the two factors of publicopinion respectively with their influence and effectiveness in mutualinteraction.Ray Stannard Baker says1 [chapter2_04.html#fn_1] that “while there was a gestureof unconcern, of don’t care what they say, on the part of the leaders (of theVersailles conference), no aspect of the conference in reality worried them morethan the news, opinions, guesses that went out by scores of thousands of wordsevery night, and the reactions which came back so promptly from them. Theproblems of publicity consumed an astonishing amount of time, anxiety anddiscussion among the leaders of the conference. It influenced the entireprocedure, it was partly instrumental in driving the four heads of Statesfinally into small secret conferences. The full achievement of publicity on oneoccasion—Wilson’s Italian note—nearly broke up the conference and overturned agovernment. The bare threat of it, upon other occasions, changed the course ofthe discussion. Nothing concerned the conference more than what democracy wasgong to do with diplomacy.”For like causes we find great industries—motion pictures being one and organizedbaseball another—appointing as directors of their activities men prominent inpublic life, doing this to assure the public of the honest and social-mindedconduct of their members. The Franklin Roosevelts are in this class, the WillHayes and the Landises.A striking example of this interaction is illustrated in what occurred at theHague Conference a few years ago. The effect of the Hague Conference’s conductupon the public was such that officials were forced to open the Conference doorsto the representatives of newspapers. On June 16th, 1922, a note came from TheHague by the Associated Press that Foreign Minister Van Karnebeek of Hollandcapitulated to the world’s desire to be informed of what was going on byadmitting correspondents. Early announcement that “the press cannot be admitted”was, according to the report, followed by anxious emissaries begging thejournalists to have patience. Editorials printed in Holland pointed out that thebest way to insure public cooperation was to take the public into itsconfidence. Minister van Karnebeek, who had been at Washington, was thoroughlyawake to the invaluable service the press of the world rendered there. Oneeditorial here pointed out that public statements “were used by the diplomatsthemselves as a happy means of testing popular opinion upon the various projectsoffered in council. How many ‘trial balloons’ were sent up in this fashion,nobody can recall. Nevertheless each delegation maintained clipping bureaus,which were brought up to date every morning and which gave the delegatesaccurate information as to the state of mind at home. Thus it came about thatworld opinion was ready and anxious to receive the finished work of theconference and that it was prompt to bring individual recalcitrant groups intoline.”Let me quote from the New York Evening Post of July, 1922, as to the importantinteraction of these forces: “The importance of the press in guiding publicopinion and the cooperation between the members of the press and the men whoexpress public opinion in action, which has grown up since the Peace Conferenceat Paris, were stress by Lionel Curtis, who arrived on the Adriatic, yesterdayto attend the Institute of Politics, which opens on July 27 at Williamstown.‘Perhaps for the first time in history,’ he said, ‘the men whose business it isto make public opinion were collected for some months under the same roof withthe officials whose task in life is the actual conduct of foreign affairs. Inthe long run, foreign policy is determined by public opinion. It was impossiblein Paris not to be impressed by the immense advantage of bringing into closecontact the writers who, through the press, are making public opinion, and themen who have to express their opinion in actual policy.’”Harvard University, likewise, appreciating the power of pubic opinion over itsown activities, has recently appointed a counsel on public relations to make itsaims clear to the public.The institutions which make public opinion conform to the demands of the public.The public responds to an equally large degree to these institutions. Suchfights as that made by Collier’s Weekly for pure food control show this.The Safety First movement, by its use of every form of appeal, from poster tocircular, from lecture to law enforcement, from motion pictures to “safetyweeks,” is bringing about a gradual change in the attitude of a safety-deservingpublic towards the taking of unnecessary risks.The Rockefeller Foundation, confronted with the serous problem of the hookwormin the South and in other localities, has brought about a change in the habitsof large sections of rural populations by analysis, investigation, appliedmedical principles, and public education.The molder of public opinion must enlist the established point of view. This istrue of the press as well as of other forces. Mr. Mencken mixes cynicism andtruth when he declares that the chief difficulty confronting a newspaper whichtries to carry out independent and thoughtful policies “does not lie in thedirection of the board of directors, but in the direction of the public whichbuys the paper.”2 [chapter2_04.html#fn_2]The New York Tribune, as an example of editorial bravery, points out in anadvertisement published May 23, 1922, that though “news knows no order in themaking” and though “a newspaper must carry the news, both pleasant andunpleasant,” nevertheless, it is the duty of any newspaper to realize that thereis a possibility of selective action, and that “in times of stress and bleakdespair a newspaper has a hard and fast duty to perform in keeping up the moraleof the community.”Indeed, the instances are frequent and accessible to the recollection of anyreader in which newspapers have consciously maintained a point of view towardwhich the public is either hostile or cold.Occasionally, of course, even the established point of view is alterable. Thetwo Baltimore Suns do brave their public and have been braving their public forsome time, not entirely without success. As severe a critic as Oswald GarrisonVillard points out that though modern Baltimore is a difficult city to serve,yet the two Suns have courageously and consistently stood for the policies oftheir editors and have refused to yield to pressure from any source. To thepublic relations counsel this is a striking illustration of the give and takebetween the public and the institutions which attempt to mould public opinion.The two interact upon each other, so that it is sometimes difficult to tellwhich is one and which is the other.The World and the Evening World of New York, pride themselves upon the followingcampaigns which are listed in The World Almanac of 1922. They illustrate thisinteraction.“Conference on Limitation of Armament Grew From ‘World’s’ Plea“Bearing in mind in 1921 the injunction of its founder, Joseph Pulitzer, tofight always for progress and reform, and having led the campaign fordisarmament in advance of any other demand therefor, the World covered theWashington Conference on Limitation of Armament in a comprehensive way.…“Measures Advocated by ‘World’ Made Law“During the 1921 session of the New York Legislature many measures advocated bythe World were enacted. One of the paper’s chief achievements was the passage ofa resolution broadening the power of the Lockwood Housing Committee, enabling itto inquire into high finance as related to the building trades situation.“The World was instrumental in obtaining the Anti-Theater Ticket SpectacularLaw. It also brought about a change in bills to abolish the Daylight-Saving Lawso that municipalities might enact their own daylight-saving ordinances. It wassuccessful in its campaign against the search-and-seizure and other drasticfeatures of the State Prohibition Enforcement Law.“The ‘World’ Told Facts about Ku Klux Klan“The World on September 6 commenced the publication of a series of articlestelling the truth about the Ku Klux Klan. Twenty-six newspapers, in widelyseparated sections of the United States, joined the World in the publication;some had been invited to participate, others requested the World to let them usethe articles. All these newspapers realized that the only motive back of theWorld’s publication was public service. It was their desire to share in thisservice, and the World is proud that they asked only assurance of itstraditional accuracy and fairness before they saw their way clear tocooperation.“The World is proud that the completed record shows no evidence either that itwas terrified by threats or was goaded by abuse into departures from its objectof presenting the facts honestly and without exaggeration.“Changes in Motor Vehicle Laws“As a result of a crusade to lessen automobile fatalities in New York City andState, the World won victory when changes in the motor vehicle laws were made.The paper printed exclusive stories giving the motor and license numbers of carsstolen daily in this city, and started a campaign against outlaw taxicabs andfinancially irresponsible drivers and owners.“‘Evening World’s’ Achievements“The Evening World continued its campaign against the coal monopoly and the highcoal prices charged in New York City—a state of affairs that has been constantlyand vigorously exposed in Evening World columns. After consultation with leadingSenators in Washington, several bills were introduced in Congress to alleviatethe conditions.”I am letting the World speak for itself merely as an example of what manysplendid newspapers have accomplished as leaders in public movements. The NewYork Evening Post is another example, it having long led popular demand forvocational guidance and control.The public relations counsel cannot base his work merely upon the acceptance ofthe principle that the public and its authorities interact. He must go deeperthan that and discover why it is that a public opinion exists independently ofchurch, school, press, lecture platform and motion picture screen—how far thispublic opinion affects these institutions and how far these institutions affectpublic opinion. He must discover what the stimuli are to which public opinionresponds most readily.Study of the mirrors of the public mind—the press, the motion pictures, thelecture platform and the others—reveal to him what their standards are and thoseof the groups they reach. This is not enough, however. To his understanding ofwhat he actually can measure he must add a thorough knowledge of the principleswhich govern individual and group action. A fundamental study of group andindividual psychology is required before the public relations counsel candetermine how readily individuals or groups will accept modifications ofviewpoints or policies, which they have already imposed upon their respectivemediums.No idea or opinion is an isolated factor. It is surrounded and influenced byprecedent, authority, habit and all the other human motivations.For a lucid conception of the functions, power and social utility of the publicrelations counsel it is vitally important to have a clear grasp of thefundamentals with which he must work.1. [chapter2_04.html#fn_ch1] “Publicity at Paris,” New York Times, April 2,1922.2. [chapter2_04.html#fn_ch2] H.L. Mencken, on Journalism, The Nation, April 26,1922."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VAN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNDMENTALS OF PUBLIC MOTIVATION IS NECESSARY TO THEWORK OF THE PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSELBefore defining the fundamental motivations of society, let me mention thoseoutward signs on which psychologists base their study of conditions.Psychological habits, or as Mr. Lippmann calls them, “stereotypes,” areshorthand by which human effort is minimized. They are so clearly and commonlyunderstood that every one will immediately respond to the mention of thestereotype within his personal experience. The words “capitalist” or “boy scout”bring out definite images to the hearer. These images are more comprehensiblethan detailed descriptions. Chorus girl, woman lawyer, politician, detective,financier are clean-cut concepts and capable of definition. We all havestereotypes which minimize not only our thinking habits but also the ordinaryroutine of life.Mr. Lippmann finds that the stereotypes at the center of the code by whichvarious sections of the public live, “largely determine what group of facts weshall see and in what light we shall see them.” That is why, he says “with thebest will in the world, the news policy of a journal tends to support itseditorial policy, why a capitalist sees one set of facts and certain aspects ofhuman nature—literally sees them; his socialist opponent another set and otheraspects, and why each regards the other as unreasonable or perverse, when thereal difference between them is a difference of perception. That difference isimposed by the difference between the capitalist and socialist pattern ofstereotypes. ‘There are no classes in America,’ writes an American editor. ‘Thehistory of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles,’says the Communist Manifesto. If you have the editor’s pattern in your mind, youwill see vividly the facts that confirm it, vaguely and ineffectively those thatcontradict. If you have the communist pattern, you will not only look fordifferent things, but you will see with a totally different emphasis what youand the editor happen to see in common.”The stereotype is the basis of a large part of the work of the public relationscounsel. Let us try to inquire where the stereotype originates—why it is soinfluential and why from a practical standpoint it is so tremendously difficultto affect or change stereotypes or to attempt to substitute one set ofstereotypes for another.Mr. Martin attempts to answer questions such as these in his volume on TheBehavior of Crowds. By “crowds” Mr. Martin does not mean merely a physicalaggregation of a number of persons. To Mr. Martin the crowd is rather a state ofmind, “the peculiar mental condition which sometimes occurs when people thinkand act together, either immediately where the members of the group are presentand in close contact, or remotely, as when people think as when they affect oneanother in a certain way through the medium of an organization, a party or sect,the press, etc.”Motives of social behavior are based on individual instincts. Individualinstincts, on the other hand, must yield to group needs. Mr. Martin picturessociety as an aggregation of people who have sacrificed individual freedom inorder to remain within the group. This sacrifice of freedom on the part ofindividuals in the group leads its members to resist all efforts at fundamentalchanges in the group code. Because all have made certain sacrifices, reasons aredeveloped why such sacrifices must be insisted upon at all times. The“logic-proof” compartment is the result of this unwillingness to accept changes.“What has been so painstakingly built up is not to be lightly destroyed. Eachgroup, therefore, within itself, considers its own standards ultimate andindisputable, and tends to dismiss all contrary or different standards asindefensible.“Even an honest, critical understanding of the demands of the opposing crowd isdiscouraged, possibly because it is rightly felt that the critical habit of mindis as destructive of one crowd-complex as the other, and the old crowd prefersto remain intact and die in the last ditch rather than risk dissolution, evenwith the promise of averting a revolution. Hence the Romans were willing tobelieve that the Christians worshipped the head of an ass. The medievalCatholics, even at Leo’s court, failed to grasp the meaning of the outbreak inNorth Germany. Thousands saw in the reformation only the alleged fact that themonk Luther wanted to marry a wife.…”1 [chapter2_05.html#fn_1]The main satisfaction, Mr. Martin thinks, which the individual derives from hisgroup association is the satisfaction of his vanity through the creation of anenlarged self-importance.The Freudian theories upon which Mr. Martin relies very largely for his argumentlead to the conclusion that what Mr. Henry Watterson has said of the suppressionof news applies equally to the suppression of individual desire. Neither willsuppress. With the normal person, the result of this social suppression is toproduce an individual who conforms with sufficient closeness to the standards ofhis group to enable him to remain comfortably within it.The tendency, however, of the instincts and desires which hare thus ruled out ofconduct is somehow or other, when the conditions are favorable, to seek someavenue of release and satisfaction. To the individual most of these avenues ofrelease are closed. He cannot, for example, indulge his instinct of pugnacitywithout running foul of the law. The only release which the individual can haveis one which commands, however, briefly, the approval of his fellows. That iswhy Mr. Martin calls crowd psychology and crowd activity “the result of forceshidden in a personal and unconscious psyche of the members of the crowd, forceswhich are merely released by social gatherings of a certain sort.” The crowdenables the individual to express himself according to his desire and withoutrestraint.He says further, “Every crowd ‘boosts for’ itself, gives itself airs, speakswith oracular finality, regards itself as morally superior, and will, so far asit has the power, lord it over every one. Notice how each group and section insociety, so far as it permits itself to think as crowd, claims to be ‘thepeople.’”As an illustration of the boosting principle Mr. Martin points out the readinessof most groups to enter upon conflict of one kind or another with opposinggroups. “Nothing so easily catches general attention and grips a crowd as acontest of any kind,” he says. “The crowd unconsciously identifies its memberswith one or the other competitor. Success enables the winning crowd to ‘crowover’ the losers. Such an action becomes symbolical, and is utilized by the egoto enhance its feeling of importance. In society this egoism tends to take theform of the desire for dominance.” According to Mr. Martin, that is why “…whenever any attempt is being made to secure recruits for a movement or a pointof view the leaders intuitively assume and reiterate the certainty of ultimatevictory.”Two points which Mr. Martin makes seem to me most important. In the first place,Mr. Martin points out with absolute justice that the crowd-mind is by no meanslimited to the ignorant. “Any class,” he says, “may behave and think as acrowd—in fact, it usually does so in so far as its class interests areconcerned.” Neither is the crowd mind to be found only when there is a physicalagglomeration of people. This fact is important to an understanding of theproblems of the public relations counsel, because he must bear in mind alwaysthat the readers of advertisements, the recipients of letters, the solitarylistener at a radio speech, the reader of the morning newspapers aremysteriously part of the crowd-mind.When Bergson came to America about a decade ago, men and women flocked to hisclasses, both the French and English sessions. It was obvious to the observerthat numbers of disciples who conscientiously attended the full course oflectures understood almost nothing of what was being said. Their behavior was aninstance of the crowd-mind.Everybody read “Main Street.” Each reader in his own study tried to react as acrowd-mind. They felt as they thought they ought to.Initiation scandals, where the crowd-mind has created a brutality not possibleto individuals, take place not only in brotherhoods, among what Mr. Martin calls“the lower classes,” but also among well-bred college youths and the fraternalorders of successful business and professional men. A more specific instance isthe football game, with its manifestations of the crowd-mind among a selectedgroup of individuals. The Ku Klux Klan has numbered among its violent supporterssome of the “best” families of the affected localities.The crowd is a state of mind which permeates society and its individuals atalmost all times. What becomes articulate in times of stress under greatexcitement is present in the mind of the individual at most times and explainsin part why popular opinion is so positive and so intolerant of contrary pointsof view. The college professor in his study on a peaceful summer day is just aslikely to be reacting as a unit of crowd-mind, as any member of a lynching partyin Texas or Georgia.Mr. Trotter in his book, Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War,2[chapter2_05.html#fn_2] gives us further material for study. He discusses theunderlying causes and results of “herd” tendencies, stressing the herd’scohesiveness.The tendency the group has to standardize the habits of individuals and toassign logical reasons for them is an important factor in the work of the publicrelations counsel. The predominant point of view, according to Mr. Trotter,which translates a rationalized point of view into an axiomatic truth, arisesand derives its strength from the fact that it enlists herd support for thepoint of view of the individual. This explains why it is so easy to popularizemany ideas.“The cardinal quality of the herd is the homogeneity.”3 [chapter2_05.html#fn_3]The biological significance of homogeneity lies in its survival value. The wolfpack is many times as strong as the combined strength of each of its individualmembers. These results of homogeneity have created the “herd” point of view.One of the psychological results of homogeneity is the fact that physicalloneliness is a real terror to the gregarious animal, and that association withthe herd causes a feeling of security. In man this fear of loneliness creates adesire for identification with the herd in matters of opinion.It is here, says Mr. Trotter,4 [chapter2_05.html#fn_4] that we find “theineradicable impulse mankind has always displayed towards segregation intoclasses. Each one of us in his opinions and his conduct, in matters ofamusement, religion, and politics, is compelled to obtain the support of aclass, of a herd within the herd.”Says Mr. Trotter:5 [chapter2_05.html#fn_5] “The effect of it will clearly be tomake acceptable those suggestions which come from the herd, and those only. Itis of especial importance to note that this suggestibility is not general, andit is only herd suggestions which are rendered acceptable by the action ofinstinct, and man is, for example, notoriously insensitive to the suggestions ofexperience. The history of what is rather grandiosity called human progresseverywhere illustrates this. If we look back upon the developments of some suchthing as the steam engine, we cannot fail to be struck by the extremeobviousness of each advance, and how obstinately it was refused assimilationuntil the machine almost invented itself.”The workings of the gregarious instinct in man result frequently in conduct ofthe most remarkable complexity, but it is characterized by all of the qualitiesof instinctive action. Such conduct is usually rationalized, but this does notconceal its real character.We may sincerely think that we vote the Republican ticket because we havethought out the issues of the political campaign and reached our decision in thecold-blooded exercise of judgment. The fact remains that it is just as likelythat we voted the Republican ticket because we did so the year before or becausethe Republican platform contains a declaration of principle, no matter howvague, which awakens profound emotional response in us, or because our neighborwhom we do not like happens to be a Democrat.Mr. Lippmann remarks:6 [chapter2_05.html#fn_6] “For the most part we do notfirst see and then define, we define first and then see. In the great booming,buzzing confusion of the outer world we pick out of the clutter what is alreadydefined for us, and we tend to perceive that which we have picked out in theform stereotyped for us by our culture.”Mr. Trotter cites as a few of the examples of rationalization the mechanismwhich “enables the European lady who wears rings in her ears to smile at thebarbarism of the colored lady who wears her rings in her nose”7[chapter2_05.html#fn_7] and the process which enables Englishman “who is amusedby the African chieftain’s regard for the top hat as an essential piece of thefurniture of state to ignore the identity of his own behavior when he goes tochurch beneath the same tremendous ensign.”The gregarious tendency in man, according to Mr. Trotter, results in fivecharacteristics which he displays in common with all gregarious animals.1. “He is intolerant and fearful of solitude, physical and mental.”8[chapter2_05.html#fn_8] The same urge which drives the buffalo into the herd andman into the city requires on the part of the latter a sense of spiritualidentification with the herd. Man is never so much at home as when on the bandwagon.2. “He is more sensitive to the voice of the herd than to any other influence.”Mr. Trotter illustrates this characteristic in a paragraph which is worthquoting in its entirety. He says: “It (the voice of the herd) can inhibit orstimulate his thought and conduct. It is the source of his moral codes, of thesanctions of his ethics and philosophy. It can endow him with energy, courage,and endurance, and can as easily take these away. It can make him acquiesce inhis own punishment and embrace his executioner, submit to poverty, bow totyranny, and sink without complaint under starvation. Not merely can it make himaccept hardship and suffering unresistingly, but it can make him accept as truththe explanation that his perfectly preventable afflictions are sublimely justand gentle. It is this acme of the power of herd suggestion that is perhaps themost absolutely incontestable proof of the profoundly gregarious nature of man.”3. “He is subject to the passions of the pack in his mob violence and thepassions of the herd in his panics.”4. “He is reasonably susceptible to leadership.” Mr. Trotter points out that theneed for leadership is often satisfied by leadership of a quality which cannotstand analysis, and which must therefore satisfy some impulse rather than thedemands of reason.5. “His relations with his fellows are dependent upon the recognition of him asa member of the herd.”The gregarious tendency, Mr. Trotter believes, is biologically fundamental. Hefinds therefore that the herd reaction is not confined to outbreaks such aspanics and mob violence, but that it is a constant factor in all human thinkingand feeling. Discussing the results of the sensitiveness of the individual tothe herd point of view, Mr. Trotter says in part, “To believe must be anineradicable natural bias of man, or in other words, an affirmation, positive ornegative, is more readily accepted than rejected, unless its source isdefinitely dissociated from the herd. Man is not, therefore suggestible by fitsand starts, not merely in panics and mobs, under hypnosis, and so forth, butalways, everywhere, and under any circumstances.”The suggestibility of people to ideas which are part of the standards of theirgroups could not be more succinctly expressed than in the old command, “When inRome do as the Romans.”Psychologists have defined for the public relations counsel the fundamentalequipment of the individual mind and its relation to group reactions. We haveseen the motivations of the individual mind—the motivations of the group mind.We have seen the characteristics in thought and action of the individual and thegroup. All these things we have touched on, though briefly, since they form theground-work of knowledge for the public relations counsel. Their applicationwill be discussed later.1.

He approaches theentire subject from the point of view of the biologist and compares thegregarious instinct in man to the same instinct in lower forms of life.4.

The real character of this controllingbackground we shall take up later. Let us first consider some examples thatprove its existence—then we can look into its origin and its standards.Powerful standards control the very institutions which are supposed to help formpublic opinion. It is necessary to understand the origin, the working and thestrength of these institutions in order to understand the institutionsthemselves and their effect upon the public.In tracing the interaction of institution upon public and public uponinstitution, one finds a circle of obedience and leadership. The press, theschool and other leaders of thought are themselves working in a background whichthey cannot entirely control.Let us turn to the press again for a text.That the press is so frequently unable to achieve a result on which its combinedmembers are unanimously set makes it evident that the press itself is working ina medium which it cannot entirely control. The New York Times motto, “All thenews that’s fit to print,” drives this point home. The standards of fitnesscreated in the minds of the publishers express the point of view of a mass ofreaders, and this enables the newspapers to achieve and maintain circulation andfinancial success.The very fact that newspapers must sell to the public is an evidence that theymust please the public and in a measure obey it. In the press there is a veryhuman tendency to compromise between giving the public what it wants and givingthe public what it should want. This is equally true in music, where artistslike McCormack or Rachmaninoff popularize their programs. It is true in thedrama, where managers, producers and authors combine to adjust plots, situationsand endings to what the public will be willing to pay to see. It is true in art,in architecture, in motion pictures. It is true of the lecture platform and ofthe pulpit.So-called radical preachers, for example, usually succeed in broadcasting theirradical ideas only when their following is prepared to accept their views. TheRev. Percy Stickney Grant was a great problem to the upholders of the acceptedorder, only because there was so large a body of parishioners eager to hear andaccept his dicta. The Rev. Billy Sunday, evangelist, derived his following fromamong people who were awaiting a faith-stirring appeal.Another evidence of the fact that a powerful outside influence helps make theforces that mould public opinion is shown by the newspapers in the actualselection of news. The public actually demands that certain types of facts beomitted. The standing problem of every newspaper office—the winnowing of theday’s news from the mass of material that reaches the editorialdesks—illustrates pointedly the need there is to examine the reasons whichprompt the editors in selection.In an exceedingly interesting advertisement published by the New York Tribune,on April 19, 1922, the Tribune’s editors state the problem most graphically. Theadvertisement is headed, “What Else Happened That Day?” and it reads as follows:“Madame Caillaux was on trial in Paris for killing Gaston Calmette.“In Long Island a woman was mysteriously shot in a doctor’s office while on anight visit.“Forty-five stage coaches were held up in Yellowstone Park by two masked banditswho took all the cash of the 165 tourists.“Romantic crime, mystery crime, adventurous crime, a public eagerlyinterested—and they suddenly dropped from the newspapers. The public forgotthem. As news, these events became as if they had never happened. Something elsehad happened.“The day of Madame Caillaux’s acquittal Austria declared war on Serbia. Russiamobilized fourteen army corps on the German border and the price of wheat inthis country soared.“All the news that a newspaper prints is affected by what else happened thatday. If an earthquake occurs the day you announce your daughter’s engagement herpicture may be left out of the newspaper.“The man who made a golf hole in one the day of the Depsey-Carpentier fight wasout of luck so far as an item on the sporting page was concerned.“When real estate news breaks, semi-news must go. When real news is scarce,semi-news returns to the front page. A very great man picked out Sunday night todine at a Bowery mission. Monday is usually a dull day for news, although somebig events, notably the sinking of the Titanic, came over the wires Sundaynight.All papers features big news. When there is no big news, real editing is neededto select the real news form the semi-news.“What you read on dull news days is what fixes your opinion of your country andof your compatriots. It is from the non-sensational news that you see the worldand assess, rightly or wrongly, the true value of persons and events.“The relative importance your newspaper gives to an occurrence affects yourthought, your character, and your children’s thought and character. For fewdaily habits are as firmly established as the habit of reading the newspaper.”Now each of the items mentioned in the Tribune’s advertisement was news.Comparison of the newspapers of that day will undoubtedly show a wide divergencein the manner in which these items were treated and in the relative importanceassigned to each. The basis of the selection was clearly the general standard ofthe clientele of each individual appear.And this selection of ideas for presentation goes on every medium of thoughtcommunication.This basis of selection has long been recognized. Thus an article in theAtlantic Monthly for February, 1911, Professor Hargar, formerly head of theDepartment of Journalism at the University of Kansas, draws attention to it inregard to newspapers, and points out that “the province of the city paper is oneof news selection.1 [chapter2_06.html#fn_1] Out of the vast skein of the day’shappenings what shall it select? More ‘copy’ is thrown away than is used. TheNew York Sun is written as definitely for a given constituency as is a technicaljournal. Out of the day’s news it gives prominence to that which fits into itsscheme of treatment, and there is so much news that it can fill its columns withinteresting materials, yet leave untouched a myriad of events. The New YorkEvening Post appeals to another constituency, and is made accordingly. The Worldand the Journal have a far different plan, and ‘play up’ stories that arementioned briefly, or ignored, by some of their contemporaries. So the writer onthe metropolitan paper is trained to sift news, to choose from his wealth ofmaterial that which the paper’s traditions demand shall receive attention; andso abundant is the supply that he can easily set a feast without exhausting themarket’s offering. Unconsciously he becomes an epicure, and knows no day willdawn without bringing him his opportunity.”Mr. Lippmann makes the same observation. He says:2 [chapter2_06.html#fn_2]“Every newspaper when it reaches the reader is the result of a whole series ofselections as to what items shall be printed, in what position they shall beprinted, how much space each shall occupy, what emphasis each shall have. Thereare no objective standards here. There are conventions. Take two newspaperspublished in the same city on the same morning. The headline of one reads:‘Britain pledges aid to Berlin against French Aggression. France Openly BacksPoles.’ The headline of the second is: ‘Mrs. Stillman’s Other Love.’ Which youprefer is a matter of taste, but not entirely a matter of the editor’s taste. Itis a matter of his judgment as to what will absorb the half hour’s attention acertain set of readers will give to his newspaper.”The American stage continually bows to public demand and consciously ascribes tothe public the changes it undergoes. The character of advertising has definitelyyielded to public demand and fake advertising has been to a great extenteliminated. Motion pictures have responded, too, to public taste and publicpressure, both as to the kind of picture presented and, in isolated instances,to the type of action permitted to appear.It is therefore apparent that these and the other institutions which modifypublic opinion carry on against a background which is also in itself acontrolling factor. What the real character of this controlling background is weshall now consider.1. [chapter2_06.html#fn_ch1] Blyer, The Profession of Journalism (page 269).2. [chapter2_06.html#fn_ch2] Public Opinion (page 354)."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIITHE APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLESBoth Trotter, Martin and the other writers we have quoted confirm what theactual experience of the public relations counsel shows—that the cause herepresents must have some group reaction and tradition in common with the publiche is trying to reach. This must exist before they can react sympatheticallyupon one another. Given these common fundamentals, much can be done tocapitalize or destroy them. It is as untrue to contend that public opinion ismanufactured as it is to contend that public opinion governs the agencies whichmould it.The public relations counsel must continually realize that there are alwaysthese limitations to his effectiveness.The very “leaders,” men who have been selected from the mass to “lead thenation,” live with their ears to the ground for every slight rumbling of publicsentiment. Preachers, acknowledged to be the ethical leaders of their flocks,express obedience to public opinion.The critics who hold these extreme points of view about public opinion have tooeasily confused cause and effect. The sympathy between the orator and hisaudience is not one which the orator can create. He can intensify it, or bytactless speaking he can dissipate it, but he cannot manufacture it from thinair.Margaret Sanger, a leader in the fight for education on birth control, willevoke enthusiasm when she addresses an audience that approves of her sentiments.When, however, she injects her point of view into groups that have apreconceived aversion to them, she is in danger of abuse, if not of actualphysical violence. Likewise, a man who would talk of prison reform at a timewhen the public is aroused by an unwonted crime wave will find little response.On the other hand, when Madam Curie, co-discoverer of radium, came to America,she found a country that was prepared to meet her because of intensive effort onthe part of a large radium corporation and a committee of women formed by MarieB. Meloney, to apprise the public of the importance of her visit. Had she cometwo years sooner, she might have been ignored save by a few scientists.A historic incident illustrative of the interaction between a leader and apublic is that of the sudden turn in the affairs of Rear Admiral Dewey. The idolof the Spanish American War, he nevertheless alienated popular affection bygiving to his wife a house which had been presented to him by an admiringpublic. For some reason the public failed to sympathize with Admiral Dewey’s ownundoubtedly sound and worthy reasons.To say, therefore, as some persons have said at great length and withconsiderable vehemence, that the public relations counsel is responsible forpublic opinion, is not true. The public relations counsel is not needed topersuade people to standardize their points of view or to persist in theirestablished beliefs. The established point of view becomes established bysatisfying some real or assumed human need.In common with the scenario writer, the preacher, the statesman, the dramatist,the public relations counsel, has his share in making up the mind of the public.The public quite as truly makes up the mind of the journalist, the pamphleteer,the scenario writer, the preacher and the statesman. The main direction of thepublic mind is often irrevocably set for its leaders.Hendrik Van Loon, in his “Story of Mankind,” paints a picture of the action andinteraction between Napoleon the Great and his public in a way that might wellhave been made to illustrate our point. When Napoleon led the public truly inthe direction toward which it was headed, that is, towards democracy andequality, he was its successful leader and its idol, says Van Loon. When in thelatter part of his career he turned back to a goal which the public haddiscarded and was eager to forget, that is, Bourbaonism, Napoleon met withirresistible defeat.“Damaged Goods” was able to make the American public accept the word “syphilis”because the counsel on public relations projected the doctrine of sex hygienethrough those groups and sections of the public which were prepared to work withhim.Public opinion is the resultant of the interaction between two forces.This may help us to see with greater clarity the position the public relationscounsel holds in relation to the world at large, and what the factors are withwhich he is concerned and by which he accomplishes his work.We have given somewhat elaborately into the fundamental equipment of theindividual mind and its relation to the group mind because the public relationscounsel in his work in these fields must constantly call upon his knowledge ofindividual and group psychology. The public relations counsel can come forward,first, as the representative of established things when their security isshaken, or when they desire greater power; and second, as the representative ofthe group which is struggling to establish itself.Mr. Lippmann says propaganda is dependent upon censorship. From my point of viewthe precise reverse is more nearly true. Propaganda is a purposeful, directedeffort to overcome censorship—the censorship of the group mind and the herdreaction.The average citizen is the world’s most efficient censor. His own mind is thegreatest barrier between him and the facts. His own “logical proofcompartments,” his own absolutism are the obstacles which prevent him fromseeing in terms of experience and thought rather than in terms of groupreaction.The training of the public relations counsel permits him to step out of his owngroup to look at a particular problem with the eyes of an impartial observer andto utilize his knowledge of the individual and the group mind to project hisclients’ point of view."},{"pageContent":"PART IIITECHNIQUE AND METHOD"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ITHE PUBLIC CAN BE REACHED ONLY THROUGH ESTABLISHED MEDIUMS OF COMMUNICATIONWhen the United States was made up of small social units with common traditionsand a small geographic and social area, it was comparatively simple for theproponent of a point of view to address his public directly. If he represented asocial or a political idea, he could, at no very great expense and with no verygreat difficulty in the early Eighteenth Century, cover New England with hispamphlets. He could arouse the thirteen colonies with his journals andbrochures. That was because the heritage of these groups made them sensitive tothe same stimuli. One man, remarks Mr. Lippmann, then was able single-handed tocrystallize the common will of his country in his day and generation. Today thegreatest superman as yet developed by humanity could not accomplish the sameresult with the United States.Populations have increased. In this country geographical areas have increased.Heterogeneity has also increased. A group living in any given area is nowextremely likely to have no common ancestry, no common tradition, as such, andno cohesive intelligence. All these elements make it necessary today for theproponent of a point of view to engage an expert to represent him beforesociety, an expert who must know how to reach groups totally dissimilar as toideals, customs and even language. It is this necessity which has resulted inthe development of the counsel on public relations.Now it must be understood that the proponent of a point of view, whether actingalone or under the guidance of public relations counsel, must utilize existingavenues of approach. Modern conditions are such that it is not feasible to buildup independent organs. Innovators and innovations cannot create their ownchannels of communication. They must for a great part work through the existingdaily press, the existing magazine, the existing lecture circuit, existingadvertising mediums, the existing motion picture channels and other means forthe communication of ideas. The public relations counsel, on behalf of thegroups he represents, must reach majorities and minorities through theirrespective approaches.If the public relations counsel can succeed in presenting ideas and facts to thepublic in spite of the heterogeneity of society, in spite of the vastpsychological and geographic problems, in spite of the difficulties, monetaryand otherwise, of reaching and influencing populations numbering millions—if hecan succeed in overcoming these difficulties by a skillful understanding of thesituation, his profession is socially valuable.Absolute homogeneity, resulting in a dead level of uniformity in public andindividual reaction, is undesirable. On the other hand, agreement on broadsocial purposes is essential to progress. Agreement on broad industrial purposesmay be equally desirable. Without such agreement, without unified purposes,there can be no progress and the unit must fall. The men who were most effectivein stimulating national morale during the war never lost sight of theseunderlying needs, whether they stimulated a whole nation to ration itselfvoluntarily and give up the eating of sugar, or whether they stimulated knittingand Red Cross activities and voluntary contributions to funds.Three ways are cited by Mr. Lippmann to obtain cohesive force among the specialand local interests which make up national and social units. The publicrelations counsel avails himself only of the third. The first method which isdescribed is that of “patronage and pork.” This is very largely the methodrelied upon by certain legislative bodies today to maintain cohesive force. Asan instance of this, the investigations of the methods used in connection withthe bills to secure the building of local post offices or the dredging ofharbors or rivers seem to point out that a representative from one communitywill promise reciprocal support to the member from another community, if he inturn will act favorably on another item. This method intensifies the feelingthat all are working together, even though they may not be working for thehighest interests of the country. Similarly the chief executive of a city mayinstitute certain measures to placate school teachers. He will expect the schoolteachers to support him on some other project at some other period.The second method named by Mr. Lippmann1 [chapter3_01.html#fn_1] is “governmentby terror and obedience.”The third method is “government based on such highly developed system ofinformation, analysis and self-consciousness that the ‘knowledge of nationalcircumstances and reasons of state’ is evident to all men. The autocratic systemis in decay. The voluntary system is in its very earliest development and so, incalculating the prospects of associations among large groups of people, a leagueof nations, industrial government, or a federal union of states, the degree towhich the material for a common consciousness exists determines how farcooperation will depend upon force, or upon the milder alternative to force,which is patronage and privilege. The secret of great state builders, likeAlexander Hamilton, is that they know how to calculate these principles.”The method of education by information, which was to a great extent relied uponby the United States, for example, was evidenced in the formation during the warof such agencies as the Committee on Public Information. The public relationscounsel, through the mediums chosen by him, presented to the public theinformation necessary to aid in understanding America’s war aims and ideals.George Creel and his organization reached vast groups, representing every phaseof our national elements, in every modern method of thought communication. Buteven in the United States the other two methods were used to obtain cohesiveforce.In fact the method least relied upon in any of the belligerent countries wasthat of “government based on such a highly developed system of information,analysis and self-consciousness that ‘the knowledge of national circumstancesand reasons of state’ is evident to all men.”This breakdown did not occur among small, inefficiently organized groups. Itoccurred among the representatives of the highest development in socialorganizations.If this was the fate of the most highly organized social groups, consider thenthe problem which confronts the social, economic, educational or politicalgroups in peace time, when they attempt to obtain a public hearing for newideas. Innumerable instances have shown the difficulty that any group faces ingaining an acceptance for its ideas.The development of the United States to its present size and diversification hasintensified the difficulty of creating a common will on any subject because ithas heightened the natural tendency of men to separate into crowds opposed toone another in point of view. This difficulty is further emphasized by the factthat often these crowds live in different traditional, moral and spiritualworlds. The physical difficulties of communication make group separationgreater.Mr. Trotter’s conclusions from a study of the gregarious instinct are singularlyapt on this point. He says that2 [chapter3_01.html#fn_2] “the enormous power ofvaried reaction possessed by man must render necessary for his attainment of thefull advantages of the gregarious habit a power of inter-communication ofabsolutely unprecedented fineness. It is clear that scarcely a hint of suchpower has yet appeared, and it is equally obvious that it is this defect whichgives to society the characteristics which are the contempt of the man ofscience and the disgust of the humanitarian.”When the worker was of the same ancestry as his employer, labor difficulties,for example, could be discussed in terms which were comprehensible to bothparties. Today the United States Steel Corporation must exert tremendous effortto present its view to its thousands of employees who are South Europeans, NorthEuropeans, Americans.Czechoslovakia, during the Peace Conferences, wanted to appeal to its countrymenin America, but this group was vague and scattered in a population that lived inmany cities throughout the country. The public relations counsel who was engagedto reach this scattered population had, therefore, to translate his appeals sothat they might be understood logically and emotionally by the educated and theuneducated, the urban, the rural, the laboring and the professional man.The same problem in quite a different guise presented itself to the publicrelations counsel who wanted to insure a public response to the appeal of theDiaghileff Russian Ballet, of which the public knew nothing. He had, therefore,to surmount the difficulties of dissimilar geographic and artistic heritage andtaste, of unwillingness to accept novelty and of interests already firmlyattached to other forms of amusement.Dominant groups today are more secure in their position than was the mostsuccessful autocrats of several hundred years ago, because today the inertiawhich must be overcome in order to displace these groups is so much greater. Somany persons with so many different points of view must be reached and unifiedbefore anything effective can be done. Unity can be secured only by finding thegreatest common factor or divisor of all the groups; and it is difficult to findone common factor which will appeal to a large and unhomogeneous group.A very simple and broodingly appealing campaign for reaching the public wasundertaken recently by the railroads in combination. They utilized the poster ingraphic, fundamental appeal to awaken an instinct of carefulness in regard tocrossing railroad tracks. When the government sought to reestablish ex-servicemen, the public relations counsel had to appeal vividly and quickly to employersand returned soldiers out of the vast complexity of their interests. He selectedthe most fundamental appeals of loyalty, fairness and patriotism in order to beunderstood actively.Domination today is not a product of armies or navies or wealth or policies. Itis a domination based on the one hand upon accomplished unity, and on the otherhand upon the fact that opposition is generally characterized by a high degreeof disunity. The institution of electing representatives to Congress is sofirmly established that no existent force today can overthrow it. Morespecifically, why is it that the two parties, Republican and Democrat, havemaintained themselves as the dominant force for so many years? Only theleadership of Theodore Roosevelt seemed for a time to supersede them; and eventssince then have shown that it was Roosevelt and not his party who succeeded. TheFarmer-Labor Party, the Socialist Party despite years of campaigning have failedto become even strongly recognizable opponents to the established groups. Thedisunity of forces which seek to overthrow dominant groups is illustrated everyday in every phase of our lives—political, moral and economic. A new point ofview, although faced by the difficulty of unifying a group to concerted will oraction, can seldom establish new mediums by which to approach those people towhom it wishes to appeal.It is possible for advertising and pamphletizing to blanket the country at acost. To establish a new lecture service in order to reach the public would beexpensive, and effective only to a limited extent. To establish an independentradio station to broadcast an idea would be difficult and probablydisproportionately expensive. To create a new motion picture and a distributingagency would be slow, and very difficult and costly, if possible at all.The difficulty of establishing and building new channels of approach to thepublic is shown best by an examination of the principal mediums which areavailable to the public relations counsel who desires to direct public thoughtto the problems of the group he represents.It is only necessary to picture the newspaper and magazine situation in theUnited States today to realize the difficulty of establishing a new medium forthe representation of a point of view. Americans are accustomed to first-rateservice from their press. They demand a high standard not only in the physicalappearance of their newspapers but in the news service as well. Their dailypaper must provide them with items of local, state and international interestand importance. In the complex activities of modern life, the newspaper mustfind and select the subjects which interest its readers. It must also give toits readers the news fresh from the making. Whatever vagueness there may beabout the definition of news itself, one admitted constant is that it must befresh.The cost of establishing a paper with a wide appeal, which will have thefacilities of gathering news, of printing and distributing it, is such thatgroups can no longer depend upon their own organs of expression. The ChristianScience church does not depend upon its admirable publication, the ChristianScience Monitor in order to reach its own and new publics. Even where the issuedemands a partisan or class origin of a newspaper, as in the case of a politicalparty, the results achieved by so expensive and laborious a step seldom justifyit.Mr. Given in his book Making a Newspaper, points out the great expense that isattached to the publication of a large metropolitan daily. In proportion totheir field of appeal and potential income, the smaller dailies undoubtedly facethe same economic problems. Mr. Given says:3 [chapter3_01.html#fn_3] “Fewpersons not having intimate knowledge of a newspaper have any idea of the greatamount of money required to start one, or to keep one running which is alreadyestablished. The mechanical equipment and delivery service alone may demand aninvestment of several hundred thousand dollars—there is one New York paper whosemechanical equipment cost $1,000,000—supplies are in constant demand, and thesalary list is a long and heavy one. For a new paper the salary list of theeditorial department is especially formidable, as editors and reporters who haveemployment with well-established publications are always reluctant to change toa venture that at best is in for a rough voyage, and can be attracted only byhigh pay.“A good many of the newspapers that are started soon become memories, and fewerthan are generally supposed are paying their own way. The sum of $3,000,000would hardly suffice at the present time to equip a first-class newspaperestablishment in New York City, issue a morning and an evening edition paper,build up a circulation of 75,000 for each, and place the establishment on amoney-making basis. Run on the lines of those already established and possessingno extraordinary features to recommend them to the public, the two papers mightcontinue to lose money for twenty years. When one learns that there are in NewYork business managers who are compelled to reckon with an average weeklyexpense account of nearly $50,000, he can understand the possibility of heavylosses. And it might be added, in contrast, that there are in New Yorknewspapers which could not be bought for $10,000,000.”Discussing substantially the same point, Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard observesthe narrowing down of the number of newspapers in our large cities and pointsout the imminent danger of a news monopoly in the United States. He says:4[chapter3_01.html#fn_4] “It is the danger that newspaper conditions, because ofthe enormously increased costs and this tendency to monopoly, may prevent peoplewho are actuated by passion and sentiment from founding newspapers, which iscausing many students of the situation much concern. What is to be the hope forthe advocates of newborn and unpopular reforms if they cannot have a press oftheir own, as the Abolitionists and the founders of the Republican party set uptheirs in a remarkably short time, usually with poverty-stricken bank accounts?”The public relations counsel must always subdivide the appeal of his subject andpresent it through the widest possible variety of avenues to the public. Thatthese avenues must be existing avenues is both a limitation and an opportunity.People accept the facts which come to them through existing channels. They liketo hear new things in accustomed ways. They have neither the time nor theinclination to search for facts that are not readily available to them. Theexpert, therefore, must advise first upon the form of action desirable for hisclient and secondly must utilize the established mediums of communication, inorder to present to the public a point of view. This is true whether it is thatof a majority or minority, old or new personality, institutions or group whichdesires to change by modification or intensification the store of knowledge andthe opinion of the public.1.

Public opinion is theproduct of individual minds. Individual minds make up the group mind. And theestablished order of things is maintained by the inertia of the group. Threefactors make it possible for the public relations counsel to overcome even thisinertia. These are, first, the interlapping group formation of society; second,the continuous shifting of groups; third, the changed physical conditions towhich groups respond. All of these are brought about by the natural inherentflexibility of individual human nature.Society is not divided into two groups, although it seems so to many. Some seemodern society divided into capital and labor. The feminist sees the worlddivided into men and women. The hungry man sees the rich and the por. Themissionary sees the heathen and the faithful. If society were divided into twogroups, and no more, then change could come about only through violent upheaval.Let us assume, for example, a society divided into capital and labor. It isapparent on slight inspection that capital is not a homogenous group. There is adifference in point of view and in interests between Elbert H. Gary or John D.Rockefeller, Jr., on the one hand, and the small shopkeeper on the other.Occasions arise, too, upon which even in one group sharp differences andcompetitive alignments take place.In the capital group, on the tariff question, for example, the retailer with anet income of ten thousand dollars a year is apt to take a radically differentposition from the manufacturer with a similar income. In some respects thecapitalist is a consumer. In other respects he is a worker. Many persons are atthe same time workers and capitalists. The highly paid worker who also drawsincome from Liberty Bonds or from shares of stock in industrial corporations isan example of this.On the other hand, the so-called workers do not consist of a homogenous groupwith complete identity of interests. There may be no difference in economicsituation between manual labor and mental labor; yet there is a traditionaldifference in point of view which keeps these two groups far apart. Again, thenarrower the field of manual labor, the group represented by the AmericanFederation of Labor, is frequently opposed in sympathies and interests to thegroup of Industrial Workers of the World. Even in the American Federation ofLabor there are component units. The locomotive engineer, who belongs to one ofthe great brotherhoods, has different interests from the miner, who belongs tothe United Mine Workers of America.The farmer is in a class by himself. Yet he in turn may be a tenant farmer orthe owner of an estate or of a small patch of tillable soil.That group so vaguely called “the public” consists of all sorts and conditionsof men, the particular kind or condition depending upon the point of view of theindividual who is making the observation or classification. This is truelikewise of great and small subdivisions of the public.The public relations counsel must take into account that many groups exist, andthat there is a very definite interlapping of groups. Because of this he isenabled to utilize many types of appeal in reaching any one group, which hesubdivides for his purposes.The Federation for the Support of Jewish Charities recently instituted acampaign to raise millions of dollars for what it called its United BuildingFund. The directors of that campaign might have subdivided society for theirpurpose into two groups, the Jewish and the non-Jewish group, or they might havedecided that there were rich people who could give and poor people who could notgive. But they realized the interlapping nature of the groups they wanted toreach. They analyzed these component groups closely and divided them into groupswhich had common business interests. For instance, they organized a group ofdentists, a group of bankers, a group of real estate operators, a group ofcloak-and-suit-house operators, a group of motion picture and theatrical ownersand others.Through an approach to each group on the strongest appeal to which the membersof the group as a group would respond, the charity received the support of theindividuals who made it up. The social aspirations of the group, the ambitionsfor leadership of the group, the ambitions for leadership of the group, thecompetitive desires and philanthropic tendencies of the individuals who made upthese groups were capitalized.The interlapping nature of these groups made it possible, too, for the publicrelations counsel to reach all the individuals by appeals that were directed notmerely to the individual as a member of the business group with which he wasaligned, but also as a member of a different group. For instance, as ahumanitarian, as a public-spirited citizen, or as a devoted Jew. Because of thisinterlapping characteristic of groups, the organization was able to accomplishits purpose more successfully.Society is made up of an almost infinite number of groups, whose variousinterests and desires overlap and interweave inextricably. The same man may beat the same time the member of a minority religious sect, supporter of thedominant political party, a worker in the sense that he earns his livingprimarily by his labor, and a capitalist in the sense that he has rents fromreal estate investments or interest from financial investments. In an issuewhich involves his religious sect he will align himself with one group. In anissue which involves the choice of a President of the United States he alignshimself with another group. In an individual issue between capital and labor itmight be very nearly impossible to estimate in advance how he would alignhimself. It is from the constant interplay of these groups and of theirconflicting interests upon each other that progress results, and it is this factthat the public relations counsel takes into account in pleading his cause. Amovement called “The Go-Getters,” instituted by a magazine as much as to keepitself before the public eye as to stimulate commercial activity, found rapidacceptance throughout the country because it appealed to trades of everydescription, because each group had among is members men who belonged also to alarge group, the group of salesmen.Let us examine for a moment the personnel of the Horseshoe at the MetropolitanOpera House. It is comprised of people who are rich, but this economicclassification is only one, for the men and women who assemble there arepresumably music lovers. But we may again break up this classification of musiclovers and discover that this group contains art lovers as well. It containssportsmen. It contains merchants and bankers. There are philosophers in it.There are motorists and amateur farmers. When the Russian Ballet came to Americathe essential parts of this group attended the performances, but in going afterhis public, the public relations counsel based his actions upon the interlappingof groups, and appealed to his entire possible audience through their variousinterlapping group interests. The art lover had been stimulated by hearing ofthe Ballet through his art group or the art publications and by seeing picturesof the costumes and the settings. The music lover, who might have had hisinterest stimulated through seeing a photograph, also had his intereststimulated by reading about the music.Every individual heard of the Russian Ballet in terms of one or more differentappeals and responded to the Ballet because of these appeals. It is naturallydifficult to say which one of them had its strongest effect upon theindividual’s mind. There was no doubt, however, that the interlapping groupformation of society made it possible for more to be reached and to be movedthan would have been the case if the Ballet had been projected on the world atlarge only as a well-balanced artistic performance.The utilization of this characteristic of society was shown recently in theactivities of a silk firm which desired to intensify the interest of the publicin silks. It realized that fundamentally women were its potential buying public,but it understood, too, that the women who made up this public were members ofother groups as well. Thus, to the members of women’s clubs, silk was projectedas the embodiment of fashion. To those women who visited museums, silk wasdisplayed there as art. To the schools in the same town, perhaps, silk became alesson in the natural history of the silkworm. To art clubs, silk became colorand design. To newspapers, the events that transpired in the silk mills becamenews matters of importance.Each group of women was appealed to on the basis of its greatest interest. Theschool teacher was appealed to in the schoolroom as an educator, and afterschool hours as a member of a women’s club. She read the advertisements aboutsilk as a woman reader of the newspapers, and as a member of the women’s groupwhich visited the museums, saw the silk there. The woman who stayed at home wasbrought into contact with the silk through her child. All these groups made upthe potential market for silk, reached in this way in terms of many appeals toeach individual. These are the implications present for the public relationscounsel, who must take into account the interchange and interplay of groups inpleading his cause.For society, the interesting outcome of this situation is that progress seldomoccurs through the abrupt expulsion by a group of its old ideas in favor of newideas, but rather through the rearrangement of the thought of the individuals inthese groups with respect to each other and with respect to the entiremembership of society.It is precisely this interlapping of groups—the variety, the inconsistency ofthe average man’s mental, social and psychological commitments which makespossible the gradual change from one state of affairs or from one state of mindto another. Few people are life members of one group and of one group only. Theordinary person is a very temporary member of a great number of groups. This isone of the most powerful forces making for progress in society because it makesfor receptivity and open-mindedness. The modification which results from theinconstancy of individual commitments may be accelerated and directed byconscious effort. These changes which come about so stealthily that they remainunobserved in society until long after they have taken place, can be made toyield results in chosen directions.Changed external conditions must be taken into account by the public relationscounsel in his work.Such changes carry with them modifications in the interests and points of viewof those they affect. They make it possible to modify group and individualreaction. The public relations counsel, too, can modify the results of thechanged external condition by calling attention to it or interpreting it interms of the interest of those affected.The radio might be taken as an example. In considering the radio from thestandpoint of his work, the public relations counsel has a new medium which canreadily reach huge sections of the public with his message. The public relationscounsel must be ready to estimate, too, what difference in viewpoint the radiowill produce or has produced in any given section of the public it reaches. Hewill have to consider, for instance, that due to it the average farmer is muchmore closely in contact with the world’s events than formerly.In the case of the radio, too, if his clients be, for instance, largemanufacturers of radio supplies and demand acceleration of this changed externalcondition in order to increase their business, he may enlarge the radio’s field,activity and effectiveness. Or, he may stress to the public the importance ofthis new instrument and strengthen its prestige, so that it may better fulfillits mission as a modifier of conditions.Changed conditions can make possible modifications in the public point of view,as can be instanced by a campaign carried on by savings banks to encouragethrift. This campaign was successful at that time because inflation made it easyfor the public to see the wisdom of the doctrines preached and to act upon them.Another example of this modification in the public point of view due to achanged condition was the demand made by the Executive Committee of the CentralTrades and Labor Council of New York for the government to take over therailways of the country. Public ownership had been a pet subject for schooldebate for more than two decades, but it had seldom passed into the field ofserious considerations by the general public. Yet the conditions of hardshipcreated by the last strike of the railroad shopmen caused a much greaterreceptivity in the public mind to this idea.The airplane slowly emerges as an important factor in the daily life of thepeople. What it will mean in the psychology of the nation when commuters cansettle within a radius of a hundred or more miles of cities is only to beguessed at. Cities may cease to exist except as industrial centers. There willbe greater groups and broader interests. There will be fewer geographicdivisions.When the automobile was first used motoring was a dangerous and thrilling sport.Today it is found that the automobile has altered the fundamental conception ofdaily life held by thousands of people, both in the urban and the ruralpopulation. The automobile has removed much of the isolation of countrydistricts. It has increased the possibility of education in them. It has causedmillions of miles of excellent roads to be laid.Changed conditions can be national or local in their important and significance.They can be as national in scope as the revolutionary introduction over night ofa national prohibition law or as local as a police captain’s edict in ConeyIsland against stockingless feminine bathers. But they must be taken intoconsideration by the public relations counsel in his work if they concern in theslightest degree his particular public.The basic elements of human nature are fixed as to desires and instincts andinnate tendencies. The directions, however, in which these basic elements may beturned by skillful handling are infinite. Human nature is readily subject tomodifications. Many psychologists have attempted to define the component partsof human nature, and while their terminology is not the same, they do followmore or less the same general outlines.Among the universal instincts are—self-preservation, which includes the desirefor shelter, sex hunger and food hunger. It is only necessary to look throughthe pages of any magazine to see the way in which modern business avails itselfof these three fundamentals to exert a coercive force upon the public it istrying to reach. The American Radiator advertisement with its cozy home, thefamily gathered around the radiator, the storm raging outside, definitely makesits appeal to the universal desire for shelter.The Golden Mustard advertisements with their graphic delineation of cold cutsand an inviting glass of what is presumably near-beer definitely appeal to ourgustatory sense.As for the sex appeal, the soap advertisements run a veritable rate with theseends in view. Woodbury’s “the skin you love to touch” is such a graphicillustration.The instinct of self-preservation, one of the most basic of human instincts, ismost flexible. The dispensers of raisins, upon the advice of an expert on publicopinion, adopted a slogan to appeal to this instinct: “Have you had your irontoday?”—iron presumably strengthening a man and increasing his powers ofresistance. The same man appealed to here will respond to the sales talk whichpersuades him that insurance may save him at a time of need.An important hair-net manufacturer wanted to increase the sales of his product.The public relations counsel, therefore, appealed to the instinct ofself-preservation of large groups of the public. He talked of self-preservationwith respect to hygiene for food dispensers. He talked of self-preservation withrespect to safety for women who work near exposed machinery.The same instinct of preservation which may cause a worker to give up necessaryfood so that he may save a little money will cause him to contribute money to acommon fund if he can be shown that this too is a safety measure.The public relations counsel extracts from his clients’ causes ideas which willcapitalize certain fundamental instincts in the people he is trying to reach,and then sets about to project these ideas to his public.William McDougall, the psychologist, classifies seven primary instincts withtheir attendant emotions. They are flight-fear, repulsion-disgust,curiosity-wonder, pugnacity-anger, self-display-elation,self-abasement-subjection, parental-love-tenderness. These instincts areutilized by the pubic relations counsel in developing ideas and emotions whichwill modify the opinions and actions of his public.The action of public healthy officials in stressing the possibility of a plagueor epidemic is effective because it appeals to the emotion of fear, and presentsthe possibility of preventing the spread of the epidemic or plague. Of course,the element of flight in this particular situation is not one of movement, butof a desire to get away from the danger.The instinct of repulsion with its attendant emotion of disgust is not oftencalled upon by the public relations counsel in his work.On the other hand, curiosity and wonder are continually employed. InGovernmental work, particularly, the statesman who has an announcement to makeis continually exhausting every effort to arouse pubic interest in advance ofthe actual announcement. Feelers are often sent out to the public to help createcuriosity.It is interesting to note, too, that even book publishers rely upon the elementof wonder, termed suspense in drama, to increase their public and their sales.Our now famous “What is wrong with this picture?” advertisements, and those usedfor the O. Henry books illustrate this point.Pugnacity with its attendant emotion of anger is a human constant. The publicrelations counsel uses this continually in constructing all kinds of events thatwill call it into play. Because of it, too, he is often forced to enact combatsand create issues. He stages battles against evils in which the antagonist ispersonified for the public. New York City, when it wants to reduce the deathrate from tuberculosis, aligns its citizens yearly in a fight against thedisease and continues the idea of combat by announcing the number of victimsfrom year to year. It uses the terminology of warfare in these bulletins. Suchphrases in this or other health campaigns as “kill the germ,” “swat the fly,”illustrate this point. The public responds to a battle in a way that it mightnot respond to a plea and take care of itself or do its civic duty.Under pugnacity would come that technique of the public relations counsel whichis continually devising tests and contests. Mr. Martin, in his experience asdirector of the Cooper Union Forum, noticed that the sort of interest which willmost easily bring an assemblage of people together is most commonly an issue ofsome kind.On the other hand, says Mr. Martin:1 [chapter3_02.html#fn_1] “I have seenefforts made in New York to hold mass meetings to discuss affairs of the verygreatest importance, and I have noted the fact that such efforts usually fail toget out more than a handful of specially interested persons, no matter how welladvertised, if the subject to be considered happens not to be of a controversialnature. On the other hand, if the matter to be considered is one about whichthere is keen partisan feeling and popular resentment—if it lends itself to thespectacular personal achievement of one whose name is known, especially in theface of opposition or difficulties—or if the occasion permits of resolutions ofprotest, of the airing of wrongs, of denouncing a business of some kind, or ofcasting statements of external principles in the teeth of ‘enemies of humanity,’then, however, trivial the occasion, we may count on it that our meeting will bewell attended.“It is this element of conflict, directly or indirectly, which plays anoverwhelming part in the psychology of every crowd. It is the element of contestwhich makes baseball so popular. A debate will draw a larger crowd than alecture. One of the secrets of the large attendance of the forum is the factthat discussion—‘talking back’—is permitted and encouraged. The EvangelistSunday undoubtedly owes the great attendance at his meetings in no small degreeto the fact that he is regularly expected to abuse some one.“Nothing so easily catches general attention and creates a crowd as a contest ofany kind. The crowd unconsciously identifies its members with one or the othercompetitor. Success enables the winning crowd to ‘crow’ over the losers. Such anoccasion becomes symbolic and is utilized by the ego to enhance its feeling ofimportance.”The public relations counsel finds in the instinct of pugnacity a powerfulweapon for enlisting public support for or public opposition to a point of viewin which he is interested. On this principle, he will, whenever possible, statehis case in the form of an issue and enlist, in support of his side, such forcesas are available.The dangers of the method must be recognized and borne in mind. Pugnacity can beenlisted on the side of decency and progress. He who looks at it from that pointof view will agree with Mr. Pulitzer, the great publisher, that it seems neitherextraordinary nor culpable, that “people and press should be more interested inthe polemical than in the platitudinous; in blame than in painting the lily; inattack than in sending laudatory coals to Newcastle.” On the other hand, theinstinct of pugnacity can be utilized to suppress and to oppress. From the pointof view of the public relations counsel, who is interested from day to day inaccomplishing definite results on specific issues, the dangers of the method areonly the ordinary dangers of every weapon, physical or psychological, which hasbeen devised.It is interesting in this connection to note that a newspaper uses the samemethods to encourage interest in itself as do others. The New York Timespromoted public interest in heavier-than-air-machines by creating sportingissues of contest between aviators on altitude records, continuous stays in theair, distance flying and so forth.Mr. Lippmann comments on this same characteristic:“But where pugnacity is not enlisted, those of us who are not directly involvedfind it hard to keep up our interest. For those who are involved the absorptionmay be real enough to hold them even when no issue is involved. They may beexercised by sheer joy in activity or by subtle rivalry or invention. But forthose to whom the whole problem is external and distant, these other facultiesdo not easily come into play. In order that the faint image of the affair shallmean something to them, they must be allowed to exercise, the love of struggle,suspense and victory.”2 [chapter3_02.html#fn_2]We have to take sides. We have to be able to take sides. In the recesses of ourbeing we must step out of the audience onto the stage and wrestle as the herofor the victory of good over evil. We must breathe into the allegory the breathof our life.Recently a philanthropic group was advised to hold a prize fight for charity.This recognition of the importance of the principle of pugnacity was correct. Itis a question whether the application was not somewhat ill advised and in badtaste. The Consumer’s Committee of Women opposed to American Valuation wasavowedly aligned to fight against a section of the tariff presented by ChairmanFordney. The Lucy Stone League, a group who wish to make it easy for marriedwomen to maintain their maiden names, dramatized the fight that they are makingagainst tradition by staging a debate at their annual banquet.Very often the public relations counsel utilizes the self-display-elation motiveand draws public attention to particular people in groups, in order to give thema greater interest in the work they are espousing. It is often found to be truethat when a man’s adherence or allegiance to a movement is lukewarm and he ispublicly praised for his adherence to it, he will become a forceful factor init. That is why the intelligent hospital boards name rooms or beds after theirdonors. It is one of the reasons for the elaborate letterheads so many of ourphilanthropic organizations have.Self-abasement and subjection, its attendant emotion, are seldom called upon. Onthe other hand, parental love and tenderness are continually employed, viz., theeffort of the baby-kissing candidate for public office or the attempt topopularize a brand of silk by having a child present a silk flag to a warveteran at a public ceremony. The whole flood of post-war charity-drives waskeyed to this pitch. The starving Belgian orphan personified in every picture,the starving Armenian, and then the hungry Austrian and German orphans appeared,and the campaigns all succeeded on this issue. Even issues where the child wasnot the predominant factor used this appeal.Four other instincts are listed in this classification—gregariousness,individualism, acquisition and construction. We have already dealt with thefirst at length.The gregarious instinct in man gives the public relations counsel theopportunity for his most potent work. The group and herd show everywhere theleader, who because of certain qualifications, certain points that are judged bythe herd to be important to its life, stands out and is followed more or lessimplicitly by it.A group leader gains such power with his group or herd that even on mattes whichhave had nothing to do with the establishment or gaining of that leadership heis considered a leader and is followed by his group.It is this attribute of men and women that again gives the pubic relationscounsel free play.A group leader of any given cause will bring to a new cause all those who havelooked to his leadership. For instance, if the adherence of a prominentRepublican is secured for the League of Nations, his adherence will probablybring to the League of Nations many other prominent Republicans.The group leadership with which the public relations counsel may work is limitedonly by the character of the groups he desires to reach. After an analysis ofhis problem the subdivisions must be made. His action depends upon his selectivecapacity, and the possibility of approach to the leaders. These leaders mayrepresent therefore a wide variety of interests—society leaders or leaders ofpolitical groups, leaders of women or leaders of sportsmen, leaders of divisionsby geography, or divisions by age, divisions by language or by education. Thesesubdivisions are so numerous that there are large companies in the United Stateswhose business it is to supply lists of groups and group leaders in differentfields.This same mechanism is carried out in many other cases. In looking for groupleaders, the public relations counsel must realize that some leaders have morevaried and more intensified authority than others. One leader may represent theideals and ideas of several or numerous groups. His cooperation on one basis maybring into alignment and may carry with it the other groups who are interestedin him primarily for other reasons.The public relations counsel, let us say, enlists the support of a man,president of two associations: (a) an economic association, (b) a welfareassociation. The issue is an economic one, purely. But because of hisleadership, the membership of association (b), that is, the welfare group, joinshim in the movement as interestedly as association (a) does, which has the morelogical, direct reason for entering the field.I have given this in general terms rather than as a specific instance. Theprinciple which governs the interlapping and continually shifting groupformation of society also governs the gregariousness.Individualism, another instinct, is a concomitant of gregariousness, andnaturally follows it. The desire for individual expression is always a trait ofthe individuals who go to make up the group. The appeal to individualism goesclosely in hand with other instincts, such as self-display.The instincts of acquisition and construction are minor instincts as far as theordinary work of the public relations counsel is concerned. Examples of thistype of appeal come readily to mind in the “Own your own home” and “Build yourown home” campaign.The innate tendencies are susceptibility to suggestion, imitation, habit andplay. Susceptibility to suggestion and imitation might well be classified undergregariousness, which we have already discussed.Under habit would come one very important human trait of which the publicrelations counsel avails himself continually. The mechanism which habit producesand which make it possible for the public relations counsel to use habit is thestereotype we have already touched upon.Mental habits create stereotypes just as physical habits create certain definitereflex actions. These stereotypes or reflex images are a great aid to the publicrelations counsel in his work.These short-cuts to reactions make it possible for the average mind to possess amuch larger number of impressions than would be possible without them. At thesame time these stereotypes or clichés are not necessarily truthful pictures ofwhat they are supposed to portray. They are determined by the outward stimuli towhich the individual has been subject as well as by the content of his mind.To most of us, for example, the stereotype of the general is a stern, uprightgentleman in uniform and with gold braid, preferably on a horse. The stereotypeof a farm is a slouching, overall-clad man with straw sticking out of his mouthand a straw hat on his head. He is supposed to be very shrewd when it comes tomatters of his own farm and very ignorant when it comes to matters of culture.He despises “city fellers.” All this is the connotation brought up by the oneword “farmer.”The public relations counsel sometimes uses the current stereotypes, sometimescombats them and sometimes creates new ones. In using them he very often bringsto the public he is reaching a stereotype they already know, to which he addshis new ideas, thus he fortifies his own and gives a greater carrying power. Forinstance, the public relations counsel might well advise Austria, which in thepublic mind still represent a belligerent country, to bring forward otherAustrian stereotypes, namely the Danube waltz stereotype and the Danube bluestereotype. An appeal for help would then come from the country of thewell-liked Danube waltz and Danube blue—the country of gayety and charm. The newidea would be carried to those who accepted the stereotypes they were familiarwith.The combating of the stereotype is seen in the battle waged against the AmericanValuation Plan by the public relations counsel. The formulators of the plandubbed it “American Valuation” in order to capitalize on the stereotype of“American.” In fighting the plan, its opponents put the word “American” inquotation marks whenever reference was made to the subject in order to questionthe authenticity of the use of this stereotype. Thus patriotism was definitelyremoved from what was evidently an economical and political issue.The public relations counsel creates new stereotypes. Roosevelt, his own bestadviser, was an apt creator of such stereotypes—“square deal, delighted,molly-coddle, big stick,” created new concepts for general acceptance.Stereotypes sometimes becomes shop-worn and lose their power with the publicthat has previously accepted them. “Hundred per cent American” died from overuse.Visible objects as stereotypes are often used by the public relations counselwith great effectiveness to produce the desired impression. A national flag onthe orator’s platform is a most common device. A scientist must of necessity bein juxtaposition with his instruments. A chemist is not a chemist to the publicunless test tubes and retorts are near him. A doctor must have his kit, or,formerly, a Van Dyke beard. In photographs of food factory buildings white is agood stereotype for cleanliness and purity. In fact, all emblems and trade-makesare stereotypes.There is one danger in the use of stereotypes by the public relations counsel.That is, by the substitution of words for acts, demagogues in every field ofsocial relationship can take advantage of the public.Play as an innate tendency is utilized by the public relations counsel wheneverconditions merit such an appeal. When a charity committee is advised toinstitute a street fair to gather money, the committee is recognizing thistendency. When a city government arranges fireworks for it citizens, when ametropolitan newspaper daily stages marble contests or horseshoe pitchingevents, the play tendency of human society finds an outlet and the imitators ofthe event find friends.1.

[chapter3_02.html#fn_ch2] Walter Lippman, Public Opinion."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIIAN OUTLINE OF METHODS PRACTICABLE IN MODIFYING THE POINT OF VIEW OF A GROUPOn the question of specific devices upon which the public relations counselrelies to accomplish his ends, volumes could probably be written withoutexhausting the subject. The detailed presentation is potentially endless. Pagescould be filled with instances of the stimuli to which men and women respond,the circumstances under which they will respond favorably or unfavorably, andthe particular application of each of these stimuli to create conditions. Suchan outline, however, would have less value than an outline of fundamentals,since circumstances are never the same.These principles, by and large, consist of fundamentals already defined, towhich the public relations counsel has recourse in common with the statesman,the journalist, the preacher, the lecturer, and all others engaged in attemptingto modify public opinion or public conduct.How does the public relations counsel approach any particular problem? First hemust analyze his client’s problem and his client’s objective. Then he mustanalyze the public he is trying to reach. He must devise a plan of action forthe client to follow and determine the methods and the organs of distributionavailable for reaching his public. Finally he must try to estimate theinteraction between the public he seeks to reach and his client. How will hisclient’s case strike the public mind? And by public mind here is meant thatsection or those sections of the public which must be reached.Let us take the example of a public relations counsel who is confronted with thespecific problem of modifying or influencing the attitude of the public toward agiven tariff bill. A tariff bill, of course, is primarily the application oftheoretical economics to a concrete industrial situation. The public relationscounsel in analyzing must see himself simultaneously as a member of a largenumber of publics. He must visualize himself as a manufacturer, a retailer, animporter, an employer, a worker, a financier, a politician.Within these groups he must see himself again as a member of the varioussubdivisions of each of these groups. He must see himself, for example, as amember of a group of manufacturers who obtain the bulk of their raw materialwithin the United States, and at the same time as a member of a group ofmanufacturers who obtain large portions of their raw material from abroad andwhose importations of raw material may be adversely affected by the pendingtariff bill. He must see himself not only as a farm laborer but also as amechanic in a large industrial center. He must see himself as the owner of thedepartment store and as a member of the buying public. He must be able togeneralize, as far as possible, from these points of view in order to strikeupon the appeal or group of appeals which will be influential with as manysections of society as possible.1 [chapter3_03.html#fn_1]Let us assume that our problem is the intensification in the public mind of theprestige of a hotel. The problem for the public relations counsel is to createin the public mind the close relationship between the hotel and a number ofideas that represent the things the hotel desires to stand for in the publicmind.The counsel therefore advises the hotel to make a celebration of its thirtiethanniversary which happens to fall at this particular time and suggests to thepresident the organization of an anniversary committee of a body of business menwho represent the cream of the city’s merchants. This committee is to includemen who represent a number of stereotypes that will help to produce theinevitable result in the public mind. There are to be also a leading banker, asociety woman, a prominent lawyer, an influential preacher, and so forth until across section of the city’s most telling activities is mirrored in thecommittee. The stereotype has its effect, and what may have been indefiniteimpression beforehand has been reinforced and concretized. The hotel remainspreeminent in the public mind. The stereotypes have proved its preeminence. Thecause has been strongly presented to the public by identification with differentgroup stereotypes.Here is another example. A packing company desires to establish in the publicmind the fact that the name of its product is synonymous with bacon. Its publicrelations counsel advises a contest on “Bring home the Beech-But,” the contestto be open to salesman and to be based on the best sale made by salesmanthroughout the country during the month of August. But here again it isnecessary to use a stereotype to help the possible contestant identify thecause. A committee of nationally known sales-managers is chosen to act as judgesfor the contest and immediately success is assured. Thousands of salesmencompete for the prize. The stereotype has bespoken the value of the contest.The public relations counsel can try to bring about this identification byutilizing the appeals to desires and instincts discussed in the precedingchapter, and by making use of the characteristics of the group formation ofsociety. His utilization of these basic principles will be a continual andefficient aid to him.He must make it easy for the public to pick his issue out of the great mass ofmaterial. He must be able to overcome what has been called “the tendency on thepart of public attention to ‘flicker’ and ‘relax.’” He must do for the publicmind what the newspaper, with its headlines, accomplishes for its readers.Abstract discussions and heavy fact are the groundwork of his involved theory,or analysis, but they cannot be given to the public until they are simplifiedand dramatized. The refinements of reason and the shadings of emotion cannotreach a considerable public.When an appeal to the instincts can be made so powerful as to secure acceptancein the medium of dissemination in spite of competitive interests, it can beaptly termed news.The public relations counsel, therefore, is a creator of news for whatevermedium he chooses to transmit his ideas. It is his duty to create news no matterwhat the medium which broadcasts this news. It is news interest which gives himan opportunity to make his idea travel and get the favorable reaction from theinstincts to which he happens to appeal. News in itself we shall define later onwhen we discuss “relations with the press.” But the word news is sufficientlyunderstood for me to talk of it here.In order to appeal to the instincts and fundamental emotions of the public,discussed in previous chapters, the public relations counsel must create newsaround his ideas. News will, by its superior inherent interest, receiveattention in the competitive markets for news, which are themselves continuallytrying to claim the public attention. The pubic relations counsel must liftstartling facts from his whole subject and present them as news. He must isolateideas and develop them into events so that they can be more readily understoodand so that they may claim attention as news.The headline and the cartoon bear the same relation to the newspaper that thepublic relations counsel’s analysis of a problem bears to the problem itself.The headline is a compact, vivid simplification of complicated issues. Thecartoon provides a visual image which takes the place of abstract thought. So,too, the analyses the public relations counsel makes, lift out the important,the interesting, and the easily understandable points in order to createinterest.“Yet human qualities are themselves,” says Mr. Lippmann, “vague and fluctuating.They are best remembered by a physical sign. And therefore the human qualitieswe tend to ascribe to the names of our impressions, themselves tend to bevisualized in physical metaphors. The people of England, the history of England,condense into England, and England becomes John Bull, who is jovial and fat, nottoo clever, but well able to take care of himself. The migration of a people mayappear to some as a meandering of a river, and to others like a devastatingflood. The courage people display may be objectified as a rock, their purpose asa road, their doubts as forks of the road, their difficulties as ruts and rocks,their progress as a fertile valley. If they mobilize their dreadnaughts, theyunsheath a sword. If their army surrenders they are thrown to earth. If they areoppressed they are on the rack or under the harrow.”Perhaps the chief contribution of the public relations counsel to the public andto his client is his ability to understand and analyze obscure tendencies of thepublic mind. It is true that he first analyzes his client’s problem—he thenanalyzes the public mind; he utilizes the mediums of communication between thetwo, but before he does this he must use his personal experience and knowledgeto bring two factors into alignment. It is his capacity for crystallizing theobscure tendencies of the public mind before they have reached definiteexpression, which makes him so valuable.His ability to create those symbols to which the public is ready to respond; hisability to know and to analyze those reactions which the public is ready togive; his ability to find those stereotypes, individual and community, whichwill bring favorable responses; his ability to speak in the language of hisaudience and to receive from it a favorable reception are his contributions.The appeal to the instincts and the universal desires is the basis methodthrough which he produces his results.1. [chapter3_03.html#fn_ch1] Mr. Given’s definition of the qualifications of agood reporter applies very largely to the qualifications of a good publicrelations counsel. “There is undoubtedly a good deal of truth,” says Mr. Given,“in the saying that good reporters are born and not made. A man may learn how togather some kinds of news, and he may learn how to write it correctly, but if hecannot see the picturesque or vital point of an incident and express what hesees so that others will see as through his eyes, his productions, even if noparticular fault can be found with them, will not bear the mark of trueexcellence; and there is, if one stops to think, a great difference betweensomething that is devoid of faults and something that is full of good points.The quality which makes a good newspaper man must, in the opinion of manyeditors, exist in the beginning. But when it does exist, it can usually bedeveloped, no mater how many obstacles are in the way.”"},{"pageContent":"PART IVETHICAL RELATIONS"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IA CONSIDERATION OF THE PRESS AND OTHER MEDIUMS OF COMMUNICATION IN THEIRRELATION TO THE PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSELWhen the question of preparing and publishing this volume was first considered,the publishers wrote letters to several hundred prominent men asking theiropinions, individually, as to the probable public interest in a work dealingwith public relations. Newspaper editors and publishers, heads of largeindustries and public service corporations, philanthropists, universitypresidents and heads of schools of journalism, as well as other prominent menmade up the number. Their replies are exceedingly interesting in as much as theyshow, almost uniformly, the increasing emphasis placed upon public relations byleaders in every important phase of American life. These replies show also agrowing understanding of the need for specialized service in this field ofspecialized problems.Particularly interesting were the comments of newspaper publishers and editorsin response to Mr. Liveright’s inquiry, for nothing could better indicate thelight in which the public relations counsel is held by those very individualswho are supposed popularly to disparage his value in the social and economicscheme of things.What are the relations of the public relations counsel to the various mediums hecan employ to carry his message to the pubic? There is, of course, first andperhaps most important, the press. There is the moving picture; the lectureplatform; there is advertising; there is the direct-by-mail effort; there is thestage—drama and music; there is word of mouth; there is the pulpit, theschoolroom, the legislative chamber—to all of these the public relations counselhas distinct relationship.The journalist of today, while still watching the machinations of the so-called“press agent” with one half-amused eye, appreciates the value of the service thepublic relations counsel is able to give him.To the newspaper the public relations counsel serves as a purveyor of news.As disseminator of news the newspaper holds an important position in Americanlife. This has not always been the case, for the emphasis upon the news side isa development of recent years. Originally, the name newspaper was scarcely anaccurate or appropriate designation for the units of the American press.So-called newspapers, were in fact, vehicles for the expression of opinion oftheir editors. They contained little or no news, as that word is understoodtoday—largely because difficulties of communication made it impossible to obtainany but the most local items of interest. The public was accustomed to look toits press for the opinion of its favorite editor upon subjects of currentinterest rather than for the recital of mere facts.Today, on the other hand, the expression of editorial opinion is onlysecondarily the function of a newspaper; and thousands of persons readnewspapers with whose editorial policy they do not in the slightest agree. Sucha situation would have been nearly impossible in the days of Horace Greeley.The need which the American press is today engaged in satisfying is the need fornews. “A paper,” says Mr. Given,1 [chapter4_01.html#fn_1] “may succeed withoutprinting editorials worth reading and without having any aim other than themaking of money, but it cannot possibly thrive unless it gests the news andprints it in a pleasing and attractive form.”Writing from a long experience with the profession of journalism, Will Irwinreaches the conclusion that2 [chapter4_01.html#fn_2] “news is the main thing,the vital consideration of the American newspaper; it is both an intellectualcraving and a commercial need to the modern world. In popular psychology it hascome to be a crying primal want of the mind, like hunger of the body. Trampwindjammers, taking on the pilot after a long cruise, ask for the papers beforethey ask, as formerly, for fresh fruit and vegetables. Whenever, in our laterWestern advance, we Americans set up a new mining camp, an editor, his typesluing on burro-back, comes in with the missionaries, evangel himself ofcivilization. Most dramatically the San Francisco disaster illuminated thispoint. On the morning of April 20, 1906, the city’s population huddled in parksand squares, their houses gone, death of famine or thirst a rumor and apossibility. The editors of the three morning newspapers, expressing the truesoldier spirit which inspires this most devoted profession, had moved theirstaffs to the suburb of Oakland, and there, on the presses of the Tribune, theyhad issued a combined Call-Chronicle-Examiner. When, at dawn, the paper wasprinted, an editor and a reporter loaded the edition into an automobile anddrove it through the parks of the disordered city, giving copies away. They werefairly mobbed, they had to drive at top speed, casting out the sheets as theywent, to make any progress at all. No bread wagon, no supply of blankets, causedhalf so much stir as did the arrival of the news.“We need it, we crave it; this nerve of the modern world transmits thought andimpulse from the brain of humanity to its muscles; the complex organism ofmodern society could no more move without it than a man could move withoutfilaments and ganglia. On the commercial and practical side, the man of evensmall affairs must read news in the newspapers every day to keep informed on thethousand and one activities in the social structure which affect his business.On the intellectual and spiritual side, it is—save for the Church alone—ourprincipal outlook on the higher intelligence. The though of legislature,university, study and pulpit comes to the common man first—and usually last—inthe form of news. The tedious business of teaching reading in public schools hasbecome chiefly a training to consume newspapers. We must go far up in the scaleof culture before we find an intellectual equipment more a debtor to the formaleducation of school and college than to the haphazard education of news.”The extent to which the editorial aspect of the newspaper has given way to anincreased importance of the news columns is vividly illustrated in the anecdoteabout the Philadelphia North American, which Mr. Irwin relates. “The NorthAmerican,” says Mr. Irwin, “had declared for local option. A committee ofbrewers waited on the editor; they represented one of the biggest groups intheir business. ‘This is an ultimatum, they said. ‘You must change your policyor lose our advertising. We’ll be easy on you. We don’t ask you to alter youreditorial policy, but you must stop printing news of local-option victories.’3[chapter4_01.html#fn_3] So the deepest and shrewdest enemies of the body politicgive practical testimony to the ‘power of the press’ in its modern form.”In the case of the brewers of Philadelphia it is my own opinion that if they hadbeen well advised, instead of attempting to interfere with the policy of theNorth American, they would have made it a point to bring to the attention of theNorth American every instance of the defeat of local option. The newspaper wouldundoubtedly have published both sides of the story, as far as both sidesconsisted of news.It is because he acts as the purveyor of truthful, accurate and verifiable newsto the press that the conscientious and successful counsel on public relationsis looked upon with favor by the journalist. And in the Code of Ethics recentlyadopted in Washington by a national editors’ conference, his function is givenacknowledgement. Just as in the case of the other mediums for the disseminationof information, mediums which range from the lecture platform to the radio, thepress, too, looks to the public relations counsel for information about thecauses he represents.Since news is the newspaper’s backbone, it is obvious that an understanding ofwhat news actually is must be an integral part of the equipment of the publicrelations counsel. For the public relations counsel must not only supply news—hemust create news. This function as the creator of news is even more importantthan his others.It has always been interesting to me that a concise, comprehensive definition ofnews has never been written. What news is, every newspaper man instinctivelyknows, particularly as it concerns the needs of his own paper. But it is almostas difficult to define news as it is to describe a circular staircase withoutmaking corkscrew gestures with one’s hands, or as to define some of the abstruseconcepts of the metaphysician, like space or time or reality.What is news for one newspaper may have no interest whatever, or very littleinterest, for another newspaper. There are almost as many definitions of news asthere are journalists who take the trouble to define it. Certain of thecharacteristics of news, of course, can be readily seized upon; and definitionsof news generally consist of particular emphasis upon one or another of thesecharacteristics. Mr. Given remarks that4 [chapter4_01.html#fn_4] “news was oncedefined as ‘Fresh information of something that has lately taken place.’…” Theauthor of this definition puts the chief emphasis upon the elements oftimeliness. Undoubtedly in most news that element must be present. It would notbe true, however, to say that it must always be present, nor would it be true tosay everything which is timely is news. Obviously, the well-nigh infinite numberof occurrences which take place in daily life throughout the world are timelyenough, so far as each of them in its respective environment is concerned; butfew of them ever become news.Mr. Irwin defines news as a “departure from the established order.” Thus,according to Mr. Irwin, a criminal act is news because it is a departure fromthe established order, and at the same time, an exceptional display of fidelity,courage or honesty is also news for the same reason.“With our education in established order, we get the knowledge,” he says,5[chapter4_01.html#fn_5] “that mankind in bulk obeys its ideals of that orderonly imperfectly. When something brings to our attention an exceptional adhesionto religion, virtue, and truth, that becomes in itself a departure fromregularity, and therefore news. The knowledge that most servants do their workconscientiously and many stay long in the same employ is not news. But when acommittee of housewives presents a medal to a servant who has worked faithfullyin one employ for fifty years, that becomes news, because it calls our attentionto a case of exceptional fidelity to the ideals of established order. The factthat mankind will consume an undue amount of news about crime and disorder isonly a proof that the average human being is optimistic, that he believes theworld to be true, sound and working upward. Crimes and scandals interest himmost because they most disturb his picture of the established order.“That, then, is the basis of news. The mysterious news sense which is necessaryto all good reporters rests on no other foundation than acquired or instinctiveperception of this principle, together with a feeling for what the greatestnumber of people will regard as a departure form the established order. In JesseLynch William’s newspaper play, ‘The Stolen Story,’ occurs this passage:“(Enter Very Young Reporter; comes down to city desk with air of excitement.)“VERY YOUNG REPORTER (considerably impressed): ‘Big story. Three dagoes killedby that boiler explosion!”“THE CITY EDITOR (reading copy. Doesn’t look up): ‘Ten lines.’ (Continuesreading copy.)“VERY YOUNG REPORTER (looks surprised and hurt. Crosses over to reporter’stable. Then turns back to city desk. Casual conversational tone)” ‘By the say.Funny thing. There was a baby carriage within fifty feet of the explosion, butit wasn’t upset.’“THE CITY EDITOR (looks up with professional interest): That’s worth a dozendead dagoes. Write a half column.’“(Very Young Reporter looks still more surprised, perplexed. Suddenly the ideadawns upon him. He crosses over to table, sits down, writes.)“Both saw news; but the editor went further than the reporter. For cases ofItalians killed by a boiler explosion are so common as to approach thecommonplace; but a freak of explosive chemistry which annihilates a strong manand does not disturb a baby departs from it widely.”Here again it is clear that Mr. Irwin has merely emphasized one of the featuresgenerally to be found in what we call news, without, however, offering us acomplete or exclusive definition of news.Analyzing further within his general rule that news is a departure from theestablished order, Mr. Irwin goes on to point out certain outstanding factorswhich enhance or create news value. I cite them here because all of them areunquestionably sound. On the other hand, analysis shows that some of them aredirectly contradictory to his main principle that only the departure from theestablished order is news. In Mr. Irwin’s opinion, the four outstanding factorsmaking for the creation or enhancement of news value are the following:6[chapter4_01.html#fn_6]1. “We prefer to read about the things we like.” The result, he says, has beenthe rule: “Power for the men, affections for the women.”2. “Our interest in news increases in direct ration to our familiarity with itssubject, its setting, and its dramatis persona.”3. “Our interest in news is in direct ratio to its effects on our personalconcerns.”4. “Our interest in news increases in direct ratio to the general importance ofthe persons or activities which it affects.” This is so obvious that it scarcelyneeds comments.Some notion of the diversity of news arising in a city may be obtained if onestudies the points which are watched as news sources, either continuously orclosely by metropolitan dailies. Mr. Given7 [chapter4_01.html#fn_7] lists theplaces in New York which are watched constantly:Police Headquarters.Police Courts.Coroner’s Office.Supreme Courts, New York County.New York Stock Exchange.City Hall, including the Mayor’s Office, Aldermanic Chamber, City Clerk’sOffice, and Office of the President of Manhattan Borough.County Clerk’s office.Those places, says Mr. Given, which the newspapers watch carefully, but notcontinually are:City Courts (Minor civil cases).Court of General Sessions (Criminal cases).Court of Special Sessions (Minor criminal cases).District Attorney’s Office.Doors of Grand Jury rooms when the Grand Jury is in session (For indictments andpresentments).Federal Courts.Post Office.United States Commissioner’s Offices, and Offices of the United States SecretService officers.United States Marshal’s Office.United States District Attorney’s Office.Ship News, where incoming and outgoing vessels are reported.Barge Office, where immigrants land.Surrogates Office, where wills are filed and testimony concerning wills inlitigation is heard.Political Headquarters during campaigns.”Finally, “the following are visited by the reporters several times, or only oncea day:Police Stations.Municipal Courts.Board of Health Headquarters.Fire Department Headquarters.Park Department Headquarters.Building Department Headquarters.Tombs Prison.County Jail.United States Sub-treasury.Office of Collector of the Port.United States Appraiser’s Office.Public Hospitals.Leading Hotels.The Morgue.County Sheriff’s Office.City Comptroller’s Office.City Treasurer’s Office.Offices of the Tax Collector and Tax Assessors.”Mr. Given’s example of the broker, John Smith, illustrates aptly the point I ammaking.“For ten years,” said Mr. Given,8 [chapter4_01.html#fn_8] “he pursues the eventenor of his way and except for his customers and his friends no one gives him athought. To the newspapers he is as if he were not. But in the eleventh year hesuffers heavy losses and, at last, his resources all gone, summons his lawyerand arranges for the making of an assignment. The lawyer posts off to the CountyClerk’s office, and a clerk there makes the necessary entries in the officedocket. Here in step the newspapers. While the clerk is writing Smith’s businessobituary, a reporter glances over his shoulder, and a few minutes later thenewspapers know Smith’s troubles and are as well informed concerning hisbusiness status as they would be had they kept a reporter at his door every dayfor over ten years. Had Smith dropped dead instead of merely making anassignment his name would have reached the newspapers by way of the Coroner’soffice instead of the County Clerk’s office, and in fact, while Smith did notknow it, the newspapers were prepared and ready for him no matter what he did.They even had representatives waiting for him at the Morgue. He was safe onlywhen he walked the straight and narrow path and kept quiet.”An overt act is often necessary before an event can be regarded as news.Commenting on this aspect of the situation, Mr. Lippmann discuses this veryexample of the broker, John Smith, and his hypothetical bankruptcy. “That overtact,” says Mr. Lippmann,9 [chapter4_01.html#fn_9] “‘uncovers’ the news aboutSmith. Whether the news will be followed up or not is another matter. The pointis that before a series of events become news they have usually to makethemselves noticeable in some more or less overt act. Generally, too, in acrudely overt act. Smith’s friends may have known for years that he was takingrisks, rumors may even have reached the financial editor if Smith’s friends weretalkative. But apart from the fact that none of this could be published becauseit would be libel, there is in these rumors, nothing definite on which to peg astory. Something definite must occur that has unmistakable form. It may be theact of going into bankruptcy, it may be a fire, a collision, an assault, a riot,an arrest, a denunciation, the introduction of a bill, a speech, a vote, ameeting, the expressed opinion of a well-known citizen, an editorial in anewspaper, a sale, a wage-schedule, a price change, the proposal to build abridge.… There must be a manifestation. The course of events must assume acertain definable shape, and until it is in a phase where some aspect is anaccomplished fact, news does not separate itself from the ocean of possibletruth.”From the point of view of the practical journalist, Mr. Irwin has applied thisobservation to the making of the news of the day. He says:10[chapter4_01.html#fn_10] “I state a platitude when I say that government by thepeople is the essence of democracy. In theory, the people watch and know; when,in the process of social and industrial evolution, they see a new evil becomingimportant, they found institutions to regulate it or laws to repress it. Theycannot watch without light, know without teachers. The newspaper, or some forcelike it, must daily inform them of things which are shocking and unpleasant inorder that democracy, in its slow, wobbling motion upward, may perceive andcorrect. It is good for us to know that John Smith, made crazy by drink, camehome and killed his wife. Startled and shocked, but interested, we may followthe case of John Smith, see that justice in his case is not delayed by his pullwith Tammany. Perhaps, when there are enough cases of John Smith, we shall lookinto the first causes and restrain the groggeries that made him momentarily mador the industrial oppression that made him permanently an undernourished,overnerved defective. It is good to know that John Jones, a clerk, forged acheck and went to jail. For not only shall we watch justice in his case, butsome day we shall watch also the fraudulent race-track gambling that tempted himto theft. If every day we read of those crimes which grow from the misery of NewYork’s East Side and Chicago’s Levee, some day democracy may get at the ultimatecauses for overwork, underfeeding, tenement crowding.“No other method is so forcible with the public as driving home the instancewhich points the moral. General description of bad conditions fails, somehow, toimpress the average mind. One might have shouted to Shreveport day after daythat low dives make dangerous negroes, and created no sentiment against saloons.But when a negro, drunk on bad gin which he got at such a dive, assaulted andkilled Margaret Lear, a schoolgirl, Shreveport voted out the saloon.”For the great mass of activities there is no machinery of record whatever. Howthese are to be recorded when they are important is the real problem for thepress.In this field the public relations counsel plays a considerable part. His is thebusiness of calling to the public attention, through the press and through everyother available medium, the point of view, the movement or the issue which herepresents. Mr. Lippmann has observed that it is for this reason that what hecalls the “press agent” has become an important factor in modern life.Mr. Lippmann’s observation on this point deserves comment. He says:11[chapter4_01.html#fn_11] “This is the underlying reason for the existence of thepress agent. This enormous discretion as to what facts and what impressionsshall be reported is steadily convincing every organized group of people thatwhether it wishes to secure publicity or to avoid it, the exercise of discretioncannot be left to the reporter. It is safer to hire a press-agent who standsbetween the group and the newspapers.”The really important function of the public relations counsel, in relation tothe press as well as to his client, lies even beyond these considerations. He isnot merely the purveyor of news; he is more logically the creator of news.An amateur can bring a good story to the average newspaper office and receiveconsideration, although the amateur is only too likely to miss precisely thosefeatures of his story which give it news value, and to overlook precisely thatelement of the story which will make it interesting to the particular newspaperhe is approaching.The New York hotel proprietors were enforcing the prohibition law in relation totheir own establishments, but saw that certain restaurants were violating thelaw with impunity. Realizing the injustice to them of this situation, they builta definite news event by going over the heads of the local law enforcementoffices and wired an appeal direct to President Harding, asking for enforcement.This naturally became news of the first order.The opening of a shop by prominent women in which were shown graphic examples ofthe effect of the tariff on women’s wear was an event created to intensifyinterest in this subject.The launching of battleships with ceremony; the laying of corner stones; thepresentation of memorials; demonstration meetings, parties and banquets are allevents created with a view to their carrying capacity in the various mediumsthat reach the public.The departments of a modern newspaper will show the great variety of possibleapproaches on any subject from the standpoint of the press. When this iscorrelated to the possible approaches on any subject from the standpoint ofhuman psychology, we see the diversification of methods to which the publicrelations counsel can have recourse to construct events.In the metropolitan press, for instance, there are the news departments, theeditorial departments, the letter-to-the-editor department, the women’sdepartment, the society department, the current events department, the sportdepartment, the real estate department, the business department, the financialdepartment, the shipping department, the investment department, the educationaldepartment, the photographic department and the other special feature writersand sections, different in different journals.In a valuable study on the “Newspaper Reading Habits of Business Executives andProfessional Men in New York,” compiled by Professor George Burton Hotchkiss,Head of the Department of Advertising and Marketing, and Richard B. Franken,Lecturer in Advertising at New York University, there are several tables settingforth the features of morning and evening newspapers preferred as a whole by thegroup to whom the questionnaires were sent, and by various smaller groups withinthe main group.The counsel on public relations not only knows what news value is, but knowingit, he is in the position to make news happen. He is a creator of events.An organization held a banquet for a building fund to which the invitations weredispatched on large bricks. The news element in this story was the fact thatbricks were dispatched.In this capacity, as purveyor and creator of news for the press as well as forall other mediums of idea dissemination, it must be clear immediately that thepublic relations counsel could not possibly succeed unless he complied with thehighest moral and technical requirements of those with whom he is working.Writing on the progression of the public relations counsel, the author of anarticle in the New York Times12 [chapter4_01.html#fn_12] says “newspaper editorsare the most suspicious and cynical of mortals, but they are as quick to discernthe truth as to detect the falsehood.” He goes on to discuss the particularpublic relations counsel whom he has in mind and whom he designates by thefictitious name Swift, and remarks: “Irrespective of their position on ethics,Swift & Co. won’t deal in spurious goods. They know that one such error would befatal. The public might forget, but the editor never. Besides, they don’t haveto.”Truthful and accurate must be the material which the public relations counselfurnishes to the press and other mediums. In addition, it must have the elementsof timeliness and interest which are required of all news—and it must not onlyhave these elements in general, but it must suit the particular needs of eachparticular newspaper and, even more than that, it must suit the needs of theparticular editor in whose department it is hoped that it will be published.Finally, the literary quality of the material must be up to the best standardsof the profession of journalism. The writing must be good, in the particularsense in which each newspaper considers a story well written.In brief, the material must come to the editorial desk as carefully prepared andas accurately verified as if the editor himself had assigned a special reporterto secure and write the facts. Only by presenting his news in such form and insuch a manner can the counsel on public relations hope to retain, in the case ofthe newspaper, the most valuable thing he possesses—the editor’s faith andtrust. But it must be clearly borne in mind that only in certain cases is thepublic relations counsel the intermediary between the news and the press. Theevent he has counseled upon, the action he has created finds its own lead ofexpression in mediums which reach the public.The radio stations offer an avenue of approach to the public. They arecontrolled by private organizations, large electrical supply companies,department stores, newspapers, telegraph companies and in some cases by thegovernment. Their programs broadcast information and entertainment to thosewithin their radius. These programs vary in different localities.To the public relations counsel there is a wide opportunity to utilize the meansof distribution the radio affords. In partisan matters, the controllers of theradio insist upon the presentation of all points of view in order to have theonus of propaganda removed from their shoulders. The public relations counsel istherefore in a position to suggest to the broadcasting managers a symposiumtreatment of the subject in which he happens to be interested. Or in the case ofinformation, which has not this partisan character, he is in a position toassure treatment of his subject by embodying his thesis in the form of a speechdelivered by some individual of standing and reputation.In the case of events which the public relations counsel may be instrumental increating, such as large public meetings, the radio today becomes a natural formof distribution, just as news treatment in a newspaper does, and thebroadcasting to thousands and thousands of people of the speeches becomes acorollary of the event itself. The broadcasting of Lord Robert Cecil’s speech onthe League of Nations, delivered at a banquet in New York, is a case in point.Many magazines, for instance, are availing themselves of the radio stations tosupply speeches on the particular topics they are most interested in. So thehousekeeping magazines supply the radio stations with information about thatphase of women’s activities. The fashion magazines do likewise in their fields.And they thereby heighten their own prestige and authority in the minds of theirhearers.The use of the wireless telegraph in war time was an important factor inbroadcasting information of war aims and war accomplishments to enemy countries.It was used successfully by both Allied and Central powers. It was utilized evenby the Soviet Government in the announcement of its communications. This form ofpropagation differs slightly from the radio, referred to previously, since itdepends for its efficacy not upon reaching great numbers of hearers, but uponreaching newspapers and other mediums that give currency to the materialbroadcasted. The wireless telegraph of course was and is a valuable asset to thepublic relations counsel.The lecture platform is another well-established means of idea communication.The spoken word has to a certain extent lost its efficacy when the lectureplatform alone is considered.The appeal of the lecture platform is limited by the actual number of those whohear the message. It is possible to reach vaster numbers through the printedword or the motion picture or even the radioed word. Both the weakness of thehuman voice and the physical characteristics of the place of assemblage bringabout this limitation.The lecture platform, however, still retains its importance for the publicrelations counsel because it affords him the opportunity to speak before groupaudiences which in themselves have a news value, or because it presents theopportunity to stage dramatic events that bring intensification of interest andaction on the part of larger audiences than those actually addressed.The lecture field open to the public relations counsel for the propagation ofinformation or ideas may be divided into several classifications. First thereare the lecture managers and bureaus, which act as agents in booking lecturersto different kinds of group audiences throughout the country. The publicrelations counsel can, for instance, suggest to his client to secure a prominentperson, who because of interest in a cause will be glad to undertake a lecturetour. Then a bureau may manage the tour. The tours of important proponents onsuch issues as the League of Nations fall in this class as well as the tours ofprominent authors, arranged by publishers in their behalf.Then there is the lecture tour managed by the client himself and arrangedthrough the booking of engagements with such local groups as might be interestedin assuming sponsorship for what is said. A soap company might engage a lectureron cleanliness to speak in the schools of leading communities. Or a woolen firmarrange for a home economics authority to lecture to women’s clubs on dress.These speeches of course, locally, gain a wider audience than the speaker wouldwho addressed a single meeting because they give opportunity for treatment innewspapers, advertising, circulating, and other mediums.The lecture field offers another means of communication in as much as it givesthe public relations counsel a range of group leaders to whom he can furnish thefacts and ideas he is trying to propagate. The lecturers of Boards of Educationin cities throughout the country, the lecturers before schools and otherinstitutions of learning, the lecturers of one sort or another who addressvaried audiences can be reached directly and can become the carriers of theinformation the public relations counsel desires to give forth.The meeting or public demonstration, at which prominent speakers voice theirviews upon the particular problem or problems at issue, would fall quitenaturally under this same classification. Its main purpose, of course, is not somuch to reach the audience being addressed as to make a focal point of interestfor those thousands and millions who do not attend, but who get thereverberations of the speaker’s voice through other mediums than their ownauditory sensation.Advertising is a medium open to the public relations counsel. In the sense inwhich the word is used here, the term applies to every form of paid spaceavailable for the carrying of a message. From the newspaper advertisement to thebillboard, its forms are so varied that it has developed its own literature andits own principles and practice. In considering his objectives and the mediumsthrough which his potential public can be reached the public relations counselalways considers advertising space as among his most important adjuncts. Thewise public relations counsel calls into conference on the particular kinds ofadvertising to be used in a given problem the advertising agent who has madethis study his lifework. The public relations counsel and the advertising agentthen work out the problem in their respective fields.Advertising up to the present time has laid its greatest stress upon thecreation of demands and markets for specific goods. It is also applied witheffectiveness to the propagation of ideas as well. It is peculiarly effectivewhen used in combination with other methods of appeal.Advertising controls the amount of physical space it occupies before the publiceye. Advertising’s dimensional qualities give it a facile flexibility that canbe extended or limited at will. In a sense, too, this quality gives the specialleader the opportunity to select his audience and to give them his messagedirectly.The field of cooperative advertising by combinations of advertisers in the samebusiness or profession, by governments or their subdivisions, for one reason oranother, is open to future possibilities.The stage offers an avenue of approach to the public which must be regarded bothfrom the standpoint of the numbers of individuals it reaches as well as from thecircles of influence it creates by word of mouth and otherwise. To the publicrelations counsel therefore it offers a wide field.Through cooperation with playwrights or managers, ideas can be given currency onthe stage. When they can be translated to the action that takes place upon astage, they are given emphasis by the visual and auditory presentation.The motion picture falls into two fields for the purposes of the publicrelations counsel. There is the field of the feature film. Here any directutilization of the public relations counsel’s ideas must come indirectly and betaken by the producer of the film from some of the other organs of thoughtcommunication. The producer may adopt for the subject of a film some idea whichthe public relations counsel has agitated. The film, for instance, dealing withthe drug traffic came very definitely as a result of the work carried on to helprelieve the drug evil.The second field is one the public relations counsel can employ more directly.Educational films are made to order today to illustrate specific points forpublic consumption, from showing how product is made to showing the necessityfor subway relief in a big city. These films are usually shown before a specialgroup audience arranged for by the public relations counsel or before some othergroup interested in the idea the particular film stands for. Thus a Chamber ofCommerce can further a film having to do with the need for better portfacilities.One phase of this kind of film is the news reel which, controlled by a privateorganization, films events and occasions which may have been created by thepublic relations counsel, but which carries because of its value in thecompetitve market of events.Word of mouth is an important medium to be considered. Ideas and facts can begiven currency by word of mouth. Here group leaders are strong factors in givingcurrency to ideas. The public relations counsel often communicates the ideas hewishes to promulgate to group leaders whose espousal of the idea he wishes toobtain.The direct-by-mail campaign and the printed word afford the public relationscounsel channels of approach to such individuals as he may desire to reach.Large companies have available for such purposes lists of individuals arrangedaccording to innumerable criteria. There are geographical divisions,professional divisions, business divisions, and divisions of religion. There areclassifications by economic position, classifications by all manner ofpreferences. This classification of his public into the right group for theproper appeals is one of the most important functions of the public relationscounsel, as we have pointed out. The direct-by-mail method of approach offerswide opportunities for capitalizing his training and experience along theselines. Telegraphic and wireless communications would of course come under thisheading.1. [chapter4_01.html#fn_ch1] Given, Making A Newspaper.2.

Rosebault."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIHIS OBLIGATIONS TO THE PUBLIC AS A SPECIAL PLEADERIt has been the history of new professions—and every profession has been at sometime a new profession—that they are accepted by the public and become firmlyestablished only after two significant handicaps are overcome. The first ofthese, oddly enough, lies in public opinion itself; it consists of the public’sreluctance to acknowledge a dependence, however slight, upon the ministrationsof any one group of persons. Medicine, even today, is still fighting thisreluctance. The law is fighting it. Yet these are established professions.The second handicap is that any new profession must become established, notthrough the efforts and activities of others, who might be considered impartial,but through its own energy.These handicaps are particularly potent in a profession of advocacy, because itis engaged in the partisan representation of one point of view. The legalprofession is perhaps the most familiar example of this fact, and in this lightat least a trenchant comparison may be drawn between the bar and the newprofession of the public relations counsel.Both these professions offer to the public substantially the sameservices—expert training, a highly sensitized understanding of the backgroundfrom which results must be obtained, a keenly developed capacity for theanalysis of problems into their constituent elements. Both professions are inconstant danger of arousing crowd antagonism, because they often stand in frankand open opposition to the fixed point of view of one or another of the manygroups which compose society. Indeed it is this aspect of the work of the publicrelations counsel which is undoubtedly the foundation of a good deal of populardisapproval of his profession.Even Mr. Martin, who on several occasions in his volume talks with severecondemnation of what he calls propaganda, sees and admits the fundamentalpsychological factors which make the adherents to one point of view imputedegraded or immoral motives to believers in other points of view. He says:1[chapter4_02.html#fn_1]“The crowd-man can, when his fiction is challenged, save himself from spiritualbankruptcy, preserve has defenses, keep his crowd from going to pieces, only bya demur. Any one who challenges the crowd’s fictions must be ruled out of court.He must not be permitted to speak. As a witness to contrary values, histestimony must be discounted. The worth of his evidence must be discredited bybelittling the disturbing witness. ‘He is a bad man; the crowd must not listento him.’ His motives must be evil; he is ‘bought up’; he is an immoralcharacter; he tells lies; he is insincere or he ‘has not the courage to take astand’ or ‘there is nothing new in what he says.’“Ibsen’s ‘Enemy of the People,’ illustrates this point very well. The crowdvotes that Doctor Stockman may not speak about the baths, the real point atissue. Indeed, the mayor takes the floor and officially announces that thedoctor’s statement that the water is bad is ‘unreliable and exaggerated.’ Thenthe president of the Householders’ Association makes an address accusing thedoctor of secretly ‘aiming at revolution.’ When finally Doctor Stockman speaksand tells his fellow citizens the real meaning of their conduct, and utters afew plain truths about ‘the compact majority,’ the crowd saves its face, not byproving the doctor is false but by howling him down, voting him an ‘enemy of thepeople,’ and throwing stones through the window.”If we analyze a specific example of the public relations counsel’s work, we seethe workings of the crowd mind, which have made it so difficult for hisprofession to gain popular approval. Let us take, for example, the tariffsituation again. It is manifestly impossible for either side in the dispute toobtain a totally unbiased point of view as to the other side. The importer callsthe manufacturer unreasonable; he imputes selfish motives to him. For his ownpart he identifies the establishment of the conditions upon which he insistswith such things as social welfare, national safety, Americanism, lower pricesto the consumer, and whatever other fundamentals he can seize upon. Everynewspaper report carrying the flavor of adverse suggestion, whether on accountof its facts or on account of the manner of its writing, is immediately bandedas untrue, unfortunate, ill-advised. It must, the importer concludes, it musthave been inspired by insidious machinations from the manufacturers’ interests.But is the manufacturer any more reasonable? If the newspapers publish storiesunfavorable to his interests, then the newspapers have been “brought up,”“influenced;” they are “partisan” and many other unreasonable things. Themanufacturer, just like the importer, identifies his side of the struggle withsuch fundamental standards as he can seize upon—a living wage, reduced prices tothe consumer, the American standard of employment, fair play, justice. To eachthe contentions of the other are untenable.Now, carry this situation one step further to the point at which the publicrelations counsel is retained, on behalf of one side or the other. Observe howsincerely each side and its adherents call even the verifiable facts and figuresof the other by that dread name “propaganda.” Should the importers submitfigures showing that wages could be raised and the price to the consumerreduced, their adherents would be gratified that such important educational workshould be done among the public and that the newspapers should be so fair-mindedas to publish it. The manufacturers, on the other hand, will call such material“propaganda” and blame either the newspaper which publishes those figures or theeconomist who compiled them, or the public relations counsel who advisedcollating the material.The only difference between “propaganda” and “education,” really, is in thepoint of view. The advocacy of what we believe in is education. The advocacy ofwhat we don’t believe in is propaganda. Each of these nouns carries with itsocial and moral implications. Education is valuable, commendable, enlightening,instructive. Propaganda is insidious, dishonest, underhand, misleading. It isonly today that the viewpoint on this question is undergoing a slight change, asthe following editorial would indicate:“The relativity of truth,”2 [chapter4_02.html#fn_2] says Mr. Elmer Davis, “isthe commonplace to any newspaper man, even to one who has never studiedepistemology; and, if the phrase is permissible, truth is rather more relativein Washington than anywhere else. Now and then it is possible to make adownright statement; such and such a bill has passed in one of the houses ofCongress, or failed to pass; the administration has issued this or thatstatement; the President has approved, or vetoed, a certain bill. But most ofthe news that comes out of Washington is necessarily rather vague, for itdepends on the assertions of statesman who are reluctant to be quoted by name,or even by description. This more than anything else is responsible for the sortof fog; the haze of miasmatic exhalations, which hangs over news with aWashington date line. News coming out of Washington is apt to represent not whatis so but what might be so under certain contingencies, what may turn out to beso, what some eminent personage says is so, or even what he wants the public tobelieve is so when it is not.”Most subjects on which there is so-called definite public opinion are much morevague and indefinite, much more complex in their facts and in theirramifications than the news from Washington which the historian of the New YorkTimes describes. Consider, for example, what complicated issues are casuallydisposed of by the average citizen. An uninformed lay public may condemn a newmedical theory on slight consideration. Its judgment is hit or miss, as medicalhistory proves.Political, economic and moral judgments, as we have seen, are more oftenexpressions of crowd psychology and herd reaction than the result of the calmexercise of judgment. It is difficult to believe that this is not inevitable.Public opinion in a society consisting of millions of persons, all of whom mustsomehow or other reach a working basis with most of the others, is bound to finda level of uniformity founded on the intelligence of the average member ofsociety as a whole or of the particular group to which one may belong. There isa different set of facts on every subject for each man. Society cannot wait tofind absolute truth. It cannot weigh every issue carefully before making ajudgment. The result is that the so-called truths by which society lives areborn of compromise among conflicting desires and of interpretation by manyminds. They are accepted and intolerantly maintained once they have beendetermined. In the struggle among ideas, the only test is the one which JusticeHolmes of the Supreme Court pointed out—the power of thought to get itselfaccepted in the open competition of the market.The only way for new ideas to gain currency is through the acceptance of them bygroups. Merely individual advocacy will leave the truth outside the general fundof knowledge and beliefs. The urge toward suppression of minority or dissentientpoints of view is counteracted in part by the work of the public relationscounsel.The standards of the public relations counsel are his own standards and he willnot accept a client whose standards do not come up to them. While he is notcalled upon to judge the merits of his case any more than a lawyer is calledupon to judge his client’s case, nevertheless he must judge the results whichhis work would accomplish from an ethical point of view.In law, the judge and jury hold the deciding balance of power. In publicopinion, the public relations counsel is judge and jury because through hispleading of a case the public is likely to accede to his opinion and judgment.Therefore, the public relations counsel must maintain an intense scrutiny of hisactions, avoiding the propagation of unsocial or otherwise harmful movements orideas.Every public relations counsel has been confronted with the necessity ofrefusing to accept clients whose cases in a law court would be valid, but whosecases, in the higher court of public opinion are questionable.The social value of the public relations counsel lies in the fact that he bringsto the public facts and ideas of social utility which would not so readily gainacceptance otherwise. While he, of course, may represent men and individuals whohave already gained great acceptance in the public mind, he may represent newideas of value which have not yet reached their point of largest acceptance orgreatest saturation. That in itself renders him important.As for the relations between the public relations counsel and his client, littlecan be said which would not be merely a repetition of that code of decency bywhich men and women make moral judgments and live reputable lives. The publicrelations counsel owes his client conscientious, effective service, of course.He owes to his client all the duties which the professions assume in relation tothose they serve. Much more important than any positive duty, however, which thepublic relations counsel owes to his client is the negative duty—that he mustnever accept a retainer or assume a position which puts his duty to the groupshe represents above his duty to his own standards of integrity—to the largersociety within which he lives and works.Europe has given us the most recent important study of public opinion and itssocial and historical effects. It is interesting because it indicates the sweepof the development of an international realization of what a momentous factor inthe world’s life public opinion is becoming. I feel that this paragraph from arecent work of Professor Van Ferdinand Tonnies is of particular significance toall who would feel that the conscious moulding of public opinion is a taskembodying high ideals.“The future of public opinion,” says Professor Tonnies, “is the future ofcivilization. It is certain that the power of public opinion is constantlyincreasing and will keep on increasing. It is equally certain that it is moreand more being influenced, changed, stirred by impulses from below. The dangerwhich this development contains for a progressive ennobling of human society anda progressive heightening of human culture is apparent. The duty of the higherstrata of society—the cultivated, the learned, the expert, the intellectual—istherefore clear. They must inject moral and spiritual motives into publicopinion. Public opinion must become public conscience.”It is in the creation of a public conscience that the counsel on publicrelations is destined, I believe, to fulfill his highest usefulness to thesociety in which he lives.1.
