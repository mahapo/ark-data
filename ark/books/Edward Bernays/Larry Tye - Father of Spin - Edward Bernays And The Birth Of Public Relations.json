Tye"},{"pageContent":"PrefaceThe selling of America on the Persian Gulf War was a public relations triumph.Its leading man, Saddam Hussein, was cast as pure villain complete with menacingleer and malevolent mustache. It had Iraqi soldiers snatching infants fromhospital incubators and leaving them on the floor to die while Iraqi helicoptershovered over Kuwait City and Iraqi tanks rolled down the streets. The Kuwaitimilitary, meanwhile, was portrayed as alive, well, and eager to fight backagainst the invaders.One detail was left out of that version of the war, however: the fact that itwas crafted by one of America’s biggest public relations firms, Hill andKnowlton, in a campaign bought and paid for by rich Kuwaitis who were Saddam’sarchenemies. Many of their contentions were later substantiated; others werechallenged. But the whole notion that the United States had been rallied to warby a massive hidden PR campaign left many Americans doubting the soundness oftheir own opinions and wondering whether our very thoughts were being tamperedwith right here in the hub of democracy.A quicker way to have exposed that tampering, and understood it, would have beento visit a man named Edward L. Bernays at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Bernays turned 100 the year America went to war in the Gulf. He didn’t know muchabout Iraq, but he didn’t have to. He would have instantly recognized the mediamachinations and behind-the-scenes maneuverings. Edward Bernays almostsingle-handedly fashioned the craft that has come to be called public relations.And if he took credit for creating a bit more than he actually did, he isnonetheless widely recognized as the man who fathered the science of spin.Hill and Knowlton’s war against Iraq was hardly a PR first. Forty years earlierBernays had designed an almost identical campaign in Guatemala, one whereGuatemala’s socialist leader Jacobo Arbenz Guzman was demonized much likeHussein and where the U.S. public was made to believe it was fighting againsttyranny. The real beneficiary of that get-tough policy—United Fruit Company,whose banana republic was threatened by Guatemala’s new leftist government—wasat least as tough to trace as the Kuwaiti royalists’ role in winning Americanbacking for the Gulf War.Bernays’s work in Guatemala was only the most obvious lesson the aging PR legendpassed down to his protégés at Hill and Knowlton and other public relationsagencies. Bernays was the man who, more than any other, got women to smoke andwho put bacon and eggs on breakfast tables, Ivory in soapdishes, books inbookshelves, and Calvin Coolidge back in the White House. Although mostAmericans had never heard of Edward L. Bernays, he nevertheless had a profoundimpact on everything from the products they purchased to the places they visitedto the foods they ate for breakfast.In doing so, Bernays demonstrated to an entire generation of budding PR men andwomen the enormous power that lay within their grasp. If housewives could beguided in their selection of soap, so could husbands in their choice of a car.And voters in their selection of candidates. And candidates in their politicalposturing. Indeed, the very substance of American thought was mere clay to bemolded by the savvy public relations practitioner, or so it seemed.With the stakes so high, however, even Bernays needed help. So he turned to hisuncle, Sigmund Freud. Much as Freud had revolutionized the way the world thoughtabout individual behavior, so Bernays was able to transform attitudes towardgroup action. He used his uncle’s ideas in the commercial realm to predict, thenadjust, the way people believed and behaved. Never mind that they didn’t realizeit. In fact, all the better. And just as Freud was rewarded with the titleFather of Psychoanalysis, so Bernays became known around the world as the Fatherof Public Relations.The techniques he developed fast became staples of political campaigns and ofimage-making in general. That is why it is essential to understand Edward L.Bernays if we are to understand what Hill and Knowlton did in Iraq—not tomention how Richard Nixon was able to dig his way out of his post-Watergatedepths and remake himself into an elder statesman worthy of a lavish statefuneral, how Richard Morris repositioned President Bill Clinton as anideological centrist in order to get him reelected, and how most othermodern-day miracles of public relations are conceived and carried out.This book uses Bernays’s life as a prism to understand the evolution of thecraft of public relations and how it came to play such a critical—and sometimesinsidious—role in American life. He made that exploration possible, and actuallyencouraged it, by leaving to the Library of Congress more than eight hundredboxes of personal and professional papers that detailed cases he’d worked on andtactics and strategies he’d employed over a career that spanned eight decades.Bernays’s papers offer insight into more than just the profession of publicrelations, however. They also provide illuminating and sometimes disturbingbackground on some of the most interesting episodes of twentieth-centuryhistory, from the way American tobacco tycoons made it socially acceptable forwomen to smoke to the way other titans of industry persuaded us to pave over ourlandscape and switch to beer as the “beverage of moderation.” The companiesinvolved aren’t likely to release their records of those campaigns, assumingthey still exist. But Bernays saved every scrap of paper he sent out or took in,and provided for them to be made public after his death. In so doing, he let ussee just how policies were made and how, in many cases, they were founded ondeception.Finally, this volume seeks to unmask the man himself. Edward Bernays was able toaccomplish all he did in part because of a dogged determination combined with aninventiveness that set him apart from his contemporaries and make his ideas asrelevant in the 1990s, when there are 125,000 PR practitioners in America, asthey were in the 1920s, when he and a handful of others got things going. Whenhe spoke, his words could sound ponderous and pontifical. But his spirit waselectric, and his enthusiasm was so infectious that many who’d heard a singlespeech decades before, or studied with him for one semester, could recite hisevery phrase years later. He would tell you he knew something about everything,that his ideas were radical, that he, Edward L. Bernays, could change not onlythe way people bought but the way they thought. And watching his grayish-blueeyes light up you couldn’t help but believe him, at least for a while.But Bernays was also a bundle of contradictions. He rode roughshod over youngstaffers even as he ballyhooed the virtues of tolerance and democracy. Hepromoted cigarettes, which he suspected were deadly, at the same time he waspromoting national health insurance. He espoused women’s rights but oftentreated his female employees, and even his wife, like indentured servants. Andhe continually capitalized on the fact that he had outlived all hiscontemporaries—he died in 1995 at age 103—to advance his contention that he,more than they, deserved to be called the prince of publicity. Although he was asmall man, his claims were as huge as his dreams—and sometimes just as fanciful.It was those claims that first drew me to Bernays. I had read press reportsquoting him on matters ranging from the fall of Vietnam to the rise of theimperial presidency. In each, he professed to know why America behaved the wayit did, and he claimed to have had a hand in shaping those beliefs. My suspicionthat he was a fascinating character, possibly an epic one, grew during my yearas a Nieman Fellow at Harvard, when I got to know his daughter, Anne Bernays,and her husband, Justin Kaplan.I met Edward Bernays only once—on a sweltering summer afternoon a year beforehis death, when he was a very old man. Sitting in the library of the ramblingwhite Victorian house in Cambridge that was his home for more than thirty years,he rambled on. His shoes were untied. His tie was stained. And he told one storyafter another in rote fashion, as if they’d been prerecorded. Then he told themagain. Even so, the spirit and electricity that had fueled countless campaignswere vibrantly there. I wanted to know more about this man so as to understandhow PR had influenced my profession of journalism and how it had shaped ourculture.This, then, is a book about Edward L. Bernays. But it also is a book aboutAmerica. It is about how public thought is routinely shaped or, some might say,manipulated by singular powers in our culture. And so it is by necessity a bookabout democracy in the era of the spinmeister."},{"pageContent":"1Starting with SYMBOLSIt was supposed to be a secret.Eddie and Doris had settled on a modern marriage, one that was more merger thanold-fashioned romance and ritual. A coming-together in the austere marriagechapel in the New York Municipal Building. No family or friends to bear witness.No gown or tuxedo, no band or bouquet. Not even a wedding ring—a symbol, to suchfree-thinking youth in 1922, of the spousal slavery they were determined toresist.Even the timing was chosen with a concern for privacy. As the bride and groomarrived, the city-issued clock registered five minutes to noon, just momentsbefore the chapel would close, almost ensuring that, no matter how esteemed thecouple, the nuptials would not be reported in the next day’s papers.They’d already managed to hide their attachment from colleagues at the publicityoffice they shared on Fifth Avenue. Eddie’s family, meanwhile, was so convincedof his commitment to bachelordom that, when his sister married five yearsbefore, her husband assumed the name Bernays as the only way to perpetuate aproud line in which Eddie was the only male heir. This humble ceremony wouldclinch it, letting them spring the surprise some days or weeks later, showingoff their cunning and casualness.In the end, however, all the stealth and subterfuge were for naught, as theyoung publicity agent couldn’t keep the secret, even if it was his own marriage.“Directly we reached the Waldorf-Astoria, where we were to honeymoon, all desirefor secrecy blew away like a mist in the sunny breeze,” Doris recalled yearslater. “My husband grasped the telephone and called hundreds of his mostintimate friends to tell them about our secret marriage.”1 [notes.html#ch1_1a]Some already knew, having read the matrimonial item that an enterprisingreporter had dug up for the paper that evening of September 16. And the groom’sfather, who had long anticipated this occurrence, had stashed a box of jewelryin a vault five years before with a letter marked “For Doris, when she shallhave married Edward.”For those who were still in the dark, Eddie offered up the sort of inspiredstrategy that was quickly becoming his trademark. He persuaded his new bride toregister with him at the Waldorf under her maiden name. He knew this wouldtrigger a policy that he as hotel PR man had instituted where the press wouldimmediately be notified of anything newsworthy. In this case the news was of amarried couple who were about to occupy a suite recently vacated by the king andqueen of Belgium and who had signed in as “Edward L. Bernays and wife, Doris E.Fleischman.”The result: headlines, here and overseas, proclaiming, “This Bride RegistersUnder Her Maiden Name,” or, more simply, “Independent.” More than 250 newspapersran stories explaining how, for the first time, a married woman had registeredat the Waldorf with her husband, using a different name, and the elegant oldhotel had permitted it.So much for their secret. But why save the surprise, Eddie reasoned, when themarriage could become a major story now, one that might help him, his hotelclient, and the women’s movement? “Doris didn’t like the publicity,” heacknowledged forty years later, “but I liked it. In retrospect, I was crowing. Imarried the girl I loved, and everyone ought [to] know about it. I was egoprojecting, I supposed, and boasting about the woman I had captured.“Doris, overnight, had become the new symbol of women’s rights throughout theUnited States—and the world. But I really didn’t mind. In fact I liked it.… Andas far as the Waldorf was concerned, they liked it too, for here was an oldhotel that stood for feminism in the public mind, the most modern andcontemporary of current ideas.”2 [notes.html#ch1_2a]* * *Eddie had been polishing his powers of persuasion for more than a decade by thetime of his marital coup. He began, in a way, when he stepped onto a lonelyrailroad platform on the flats of Cayuga Lake in 1908. The decision to enroll atCornell’s august College of Agriculture had been a joint one by his father, Ely,an ardent disciple of Teddy Roosevelt’s back-to-the-soil movement, and hismother, Anna, who worshiped nature. They believed Cornell, with its scientificapproach to farming and its remote setting in the overgrown village of Ithaca,was just the place for Eddie to sever his ties to Manhattan and learn to earnhis living from the land.But the roots never took. He was short and wiry, while his farm-bred classmateswere tall and strapping. He’d been raised in a New York City brownstone andreared on the Broadway theater and on books. He spent his summers at a spa nearWiesbaden or at an Adirondack Mountain retreat, and when the weather turned coldhe dug in to declensions in Latin, Greek, and German. His fellow students—mostof them, anyway—had sprung from the soil. They were the kinds of boys who’d gonebarefoot until November and ordered their one pair of shoes from the Sears,Roebuck catalog; who knew the agricultural life they were destined for becausetheir parents and grandparents had lived it; and who had no use for city boys orJews although, except for Eddie, they didn’t know many of either.His culture shock was even more pronounced in the classroom. He stayed awakejust enough to get passable grades in courses like General ComparativeMorphology and Physiology of Plants, Physiography of the Campus and ImmediateVicinity, and Animal Husbandry, which involved “the principles of feeding, care,selection and management of dairy and beef cattle, sheep and swine.” Equallyfrustrating was how removed Cornell seemed from the Progressive movement thatwas sweeping America at the turn of the century, promising to bust up trusts,eliminate slums, reform corrupt cities, and otherwise harness the runaway forcesof industrialization and urbanization.His disappointment was still evident fifty-three years later when Eddie renderedhis verdict on his higher education: “My three and a half years at the CornellUniversity College of Agriculture gave me little stimulation and lesslearning.”3 [notes.html#ch1_3a]As he stopped to reflect, however, he realized he had learned more than hethought. There was his work on the Cornell Countryman, which confirmed that hewasn’t a gifted writer but could be a masterful communicator. Membership in theCosmopolitan Club had won him friends from China, South Africa, Cuba, and otherfar-off nations he would someday work with, while involvement in the theater andchorus taught him about actors and singers, if not about acting and singing. Andknowing he didn’t fit in with conventional thinking on campus got him accustomedto thinking unconventionally, to operating at the edge and pushing theboundaries, which became his trademark over a career that lasted more thaneighty years.As for his complaints about fellow students, he managed to find enoughattractive young women to let him indulge his growing fascination with females.“Some of my few pleasant memories of Cornell,” he conceded in his memoirs, “aremy drives with coeds over snow-covered dirt roads overlooking silvery LakeCayuga, to the accompanying sound of horses’ hoofs as they crunched the packedsnow.”“Perhaps Cornell was the right place for me after all,” he decided later,“because it furnished, in a negative way, a test for aptitudes and adjustments.…I was looking for something that was not there and found something better.”Important insights, but they didn’t make it any easier for Eddie to decide whatto do when Cornell handed him his degree in February 1912. Trained inagriculture, but not wanting to dirty his hands on another animal or plant, thetwenty-year-old with the wavy mustache and close-cropped hair accepted aprofessor’s offer to write for the National Nurseryman journal. He hadn’tstudied journalism but he’d practiced it in grammar school, high school, andsummer camp, as well as in college. And he loved it now, relishing the way“German-American proprietors of nurseries in Danville, New York, greeted me asif I were a rich uncle, inviting me to lunch and dinner at their homes, where wediscussed Goethe, Schiller, and fruit-tree stock.” The job might have lasted ifthere’d been more time for Goethe and Schiller and less need to come up withstories about apples, peaches, and pears.From there he tried filling out bills of lading on hay and oats at New YorkCity’s Produce Exchange, where his father worked. Then he booked himself assupercargo on a freighter bound for Rotterdam and from there made his way toParis. The City of Light was indeed illuminating, letting Eddie practice hisFrench on coachmen, muse about life with waiters serving aperitifs, and, best ofall, stroll the narrow streets near the Place Vendôme with his latest amour,stopping occasionally “to embrace and kiss passionately.” The problem, again,was work. For a time he tried decoding cables concerning grain trades for thevenerable Louis Dreyfus and Company, a job that proved even more tedious thanhis previous posts.His way out appeared by accident, and as he liked to tell the story, “it allstarted with sex.”Back in Manhattan after quitting his Paris job, Eddie at first pined forEurope’s charm and sophistication, dismissing New York as a “dirty littlevillage on the Hudson.” But he soon got caught up in the spirit of WoodrowWilson’s New Freedom, with its promise of rising economic opportunity andfalling cultural inhibitions. Although he was unemployed, his father’s successas a grain dealer let him settle in to a relatively carefree existence, onewhere he could contemplate his future without worrying about it. Still, it feltgood to bump into an old friend like Fred Robinson when he boarded the NinthAvenue trolley on a brisk December morning in 1912.Years earlier Fred and Eddie had been coeditors of the school paper at PublicSchool 184, and Fred’s father had just turned over to him two monthly journalshe owned, the Medical Review of Reviews and the Dietetic and Hygienic Gazette.Fred asked Eddie, “How’d you like to help me run the Review and the Gazette?”Eddie accepted the offer on the spot and began work the next morning. Neither henor Fred knew much about medicine or nutrition, and neither had any realexperience in publishing, unless you count the Echo at P.S. 184. But both wereambitious and enterprising, which was all most entrepreneurs of the era beganwith, and both were willing to do everything from writing and editing topromotion and office errands. They used the Medical Review to argue againstwomen wearing corsets with stays and to encourage shower baths; they publishedexpert opinions on health controversies, a relatively novel approach; and theytried something even newer to promote the journal and its advertisers:distributing free copies to most of the 137,000 licensed physicians in theUnited States.Their real break came two months after they joined forces, when a doctorsubmitted a glowing review of Damaged Goods, a work by French playwright EugeneBrieux. The play—about a man with syphilis who marries, then fathers asyphilitic child—attacked the prevailing standards of prudery. It was taboo backthen to openly discuss sexually transmitted disease, and even worse to talkabout public health remedies, but Damaged Goods did both.Eddie and his partner published the doctor’s review—a bold step, given theirconservative audience. Then they went a step further. They’d read that RichardBennett, a leading actor (and the father of soon-to-be movie star Joan Bennett),was interested in producing Damaged Goods. So Eddie wrote him, saying, “Theeditors of the Medical Review of Reviews support your praiseworthy intention tofight sex-pruriency in the United States by producing Brieux’s play DamagedGoods. You can count on our help.”4 [notes.html#ch1_4a]Bennett quickly accepted the offer, pumping up the young editor with visions ofa crusade against Victorian mores, promising to recruit actors who would workwithout pay and prodding him to raise money for the production. Eddie was soexcited that he volunteered to underwrite the production.There were two problems with his generosity. He was earning just $25 a week atthe journals, and another $25 tutoring the scions of fashionable New Yorkfamilies, and neither he nor his partner could conceive of how they’d come upwith the money to rent a theater and pay other expenses. Even more imposing werethe New York City censors who several years before had shut down a GeorgeBernard Shaw play about prostitution and who were not likely to approve one thatfeatured such frank treatment of syphilis.Eddie took those hurdles as challenges. Anything could be accomplished, hebelieved, if people could be made to see what looked like an obstacle as anopportunity. All that was required was a bit of insight into how people definedobstacles and opportunities, along with some creative prodding to get them torethink those definitions.The key with Damaged Goods, he realized, was to transform the controversy into acause and recruit backers who already were public role models. Thetwenty-one-year-old editor formed a Medical Review of Reviews Sociological FundCommittee, then attracted members with an artful appeal that played on Bennett’sreputation as an artist as well as the worthiness of battling prudishness. Amongthose who signed up were John D. Rockefeller Jr., Mrs. William K. VanderbiltSr., Mr. and Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dr. William Jay Schieffelin, whosecompany had recently brought to America a treatment for syphilis, and theReverend John Haynes Holmes of New York’s Unitarian Community Church. Eachcommittee member was asked to contribute four dollars, which entitled him to oneticket, and many were asked for endorsements designed to head off policeintervention.The committee was more effective than anyone dreamed. Hundreds of checks pouredin, and testimonials were offered by luminaries like Rockefeller. “The evilsspringing from prostitution cannot be understood,” the oil magnate said in aletter, “until frank discussion of them has been made possible.” This was thefirst time that Eddie, or anyone else, had assembled quite such a distinguishedfront group. And its success ensured not only that he would use this techniquerepeatedly but also that it would continue to be employed today, when it takes adetective to unmask the interests behind such innocuous-sounding groups as theSafe Energy Communication Council (antinuclear), the Eagle Alliance(pronuclear), and the Coalition Against Regressive Taxation (trucking industry).Damaged Goods, meanwhile, was a huge hit, presented before overflow audiences inNew York, then heading to the National Theater in Washington and a performancebefore Supreme Court justices, members of the president’s cabinet, andcongressmen from across the country. Its success at the box office was even moreimpressive given that most reviewers agreed with the New York American, whichpronounced the play “dull and almost unendurable.” What mattered more was thatthe production, in the words of one editorial on March 15, 1913, made it strike“sex-o’clock in America”—precisely the note the boy editors were aiming for.Bernays and Robinson dreamed of a string of similar productions—on narcotics,the white slave trade, and other social evils that begged for redress. “Therewere no limits to what we could accomplish,” Eddie recalled later.Unfortunately, Richard Bennett had other ideas. Having quietly acquired allAmerican rights to the play, the actor bade Eddie and Fred good-bye. “I don’tneed you or your damn sociological fund anymore,” he told his would-be partners.“I’ll start my own fund. I own all the rights to Damaged Goods. Ta, ta.”5[notes.html#ch1_5a]* * *Eddie’s adrenaline was flowing too fast for him to waste time licking hiswounds, and he was too pumped up by his brush with the brave new worlds oftheater and promotion to return to his dull medical magazines. So he arranged todeliver a young boy to his mother in Paris as a way of earning ship’s fare, thenheaded to Carlsbad in what is now the Czech Republic to talk over his recentexploits with his uncle, Sigmund Freud.The novice promoter had strong familial ties to the venerated psychoanalyst: Hismother was Freud’s sister, and his father’s sister was Freud’s wife. And whenEddie and his parents left Vienna when the boy was barely one, his two oldersisters remained behind with Freud and Freud’s parents until Ely Bernays gotestablished in New York. All of which gave Eddie an intimate connection to theFather of Psychoanalysis, a connection he capitalized on every chance he got.On this trip he and Freud took long walks in the woods, where they must havemade quite a sight—the Austrian uncle, walking stick in hand, wearing hisfamiliar green Tyrolean hat with a feather and a ram’s horn stuck in thehatband, salt-and-pepper knickers, and brown brogues, and his American nephewfitted out in a Brooks Brothers suit. It’s not known what the pair talked about.All Eddie could remember more than fifty years later was his uncle’s playfulexplanation in a restaurant that “these brook trout are swimming in the order oftheir price range,” and Freud’s gentle admonition that his nephew not swat aninsect on the tablecloth, preferring to “let the fly take its promenade on thehigh plateau.” He also recalled Freud’s “pleasant and easy attitude, hisunderstanding sympathy, more candid and relaxed in his attitude to me than anyother older man I had ever known. It was as if two close friends were exchangingconfidences instead of a famous uncle of fifty-seven and an unknown nephew oftwenty-two.”Whatever the specifics of their conversation, it is clear that when Eddiereturned to New York in the fall of 1913 he was more taken than ever with theViennese doctor’s novel theories on how unconscious drives dating to childhoodmake people act the way they do. And Eddie was convinced that understanding theinstincts and symbols that motivate an individual could help him shape thebehavior of the masses.He didn’t waste any time testing that understanding. For starters, there was hiswork on Broadway, where he had signed on with Klaw and Erlanger, the GeneralMotors of theatrical booking agents. His job was to help make hits out of playslike Jean Webster’s Daddy Long-Legs, a precursor to “Little Orphan Annie.” Daddyis a comedy about a twelve-year-old girl whose irrepressible spirit first helpsher endure a grim orphanage, then assists her in coping with the world of wealthinto which she’s thrust by an anonymous benefactor.Eddie’s approach was straightforward: take techniques that had worked withDamaged Goods and, as he would do over and over, push them several stepsfurther. That meant linking Daddy Long-Legs to a worthwhile activity, one thatmade theatergoers feel they were doing more than indulging in entertainment.Eddie called it hitching private interests to public ones. He joined forces withNew York’s State Charities Aid Association to organize a network of DaddyLong-Legs funds. Groups formed on college campuses and in high schools wouldraise money that private families could use to take in orphans.The results were impressive. A dollmaker manufactured ten thousand DaddyLong-Legs dolls dressed in orphan-blue checkered gingham, and the proceeds wentto the Aid Association. A famous race car driver retired his lucky Kewpie dollin favor of a Daddy Long-Legs doll, and other drivers did the same. As always,the achievements were chronicled in newspapers across New York State andeventually the nation, with one story crediting the campaign with spawning “asmall upheaval in clubdom” and noting that the Sophia Fund of Bronxville hadrenamed itself the Daddy Long-Legs Sewing Club.Another pattern emerged in this campaign that would resurface repeatedly. Eddiehad decided that prim and proper Vassar College was an ideal place from which tolaunch his promotion. He arranged a meeting with influential undergraduates, gotthe gathering written up on the front page of the Poughkeepsie EveningEnterprise, and placed stories in five New York City papers: the Times, World,Sun, Tribune, and Post—all based on 15 cents collected from the students.Officials at Vassar were not amused. “It could never have been inferred by anyreaders that it was a joke collection of fifteen cents, made, as the girlssupposed, for a joke and nothing else,” Elizabeth Hazelton Haight, head of theVassar Alumnae Council’s publicity committee, wrote Eddie several days after thestories appeared. In a separate letter to the Aid Society she wrote, “I surmiseMr. Bernays’ advertising methods have simply run away with him without yourcognizance, and I hope that you will check his use of the name of the collegeuntil there are facts here that warrant it.”6 [notes.html#ch1_6a]Eddie was chagrined, but he insisted later that he had learned a lesson: “Thatit is sound to find out beforehand what people’s reactions may be.” His reasonfor finding out, however, was so he could adjust his tactics rather than changecourse. As he continued in his memoirs, “Vassar’s timidity didn’t slow my ardor.I was able to make arrangements for several Vassar alumnae nights at DaddyLong-Legs.… The Friday after Thanksgiving, there was a greater demand fortickets than the house could fill.”7 [notes.html#ch1_7a]The up-and-coming press agent made an even bigger stir in the rarefied world ofdance, handling publicity for the U.S. tour of Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballet Russe.Diaghilev, a Russian aristocrat and veteran of the acclaimed Imperial RussianTheater, had assembled a company blending classical ballet with the modern danceof Isadora Duncan. He featured the most sought-after European dancers, includingWaslaw Nijinsky; dazzled audiences with his use of music, set decoration, color,costume, light, and story; and revitalized a theatrical form that had becomeponderous and stereotyped. Rave reviews poured in across Europe, and now, in thesummer of 1915, it was announced that the Ballet Russe would make its Americandebut the following January.It was left to a twenty-three-year-old agriculture student to sell the BalletRusse to a country that didn’t care much for European culture, knew and caredeven less about Russia, and thought men had no business dancing on the stagewearing slippers and tights.But Eddie was coming to thrive on just this sort of challenge. He began byacknowledging that he was as ignorant about the ballet as the public he soughtto enlighten, then set out toward self-enlightenment. That meant digging up allthe information he could from the library, secondhand bookstores, and theMetropolitan Opera Company, which was sponsoring the Ballet Russe tour. It alsomeant eliciting bits of dance wisdom from Fred A. King, the arts editor ofLiterary Digest, and from budding ballerina Natasha Rambova, who later marriedRudolph Valentino. And it meant conducting what is today called opinionresearch, but in 1915 Bernays’s research consisted mainly of chatting withpeople and forming educated guesses about what they thought of the ballet andwhy.Having roughly determined what the public didn’t know or didn’t like aboutballet, Eddie set out to educate them and alter their attitude. The packet heprepared for the press suggests the inventive slants he used to get skepticaleditors interested in the ballet. It featured “4 pages sketch of Nijinsky’slife, 2 pages Choreography Becomes Chirography, 3 pages Nijinsky’s mother-in lawbrands him a spy, 3 pages Are American Men Ashamed of Being Graceful? 1 pageWorld’s Greatest Dancer Walks Broadway Unnoticed, 2 pages Dreaming a Ballet IntoBeing, 1 page Nothing Like a Stencil To Keep My Lady Warm, 1 page Life of BalletGirl, 1 page It’s Safety Pins that Keeps the Ballet Russe Together, 21 pages (15stories) of fashions, novelties, and influence of the Ballet on modern dress.”8[notes.html#ch1_8a]Eddie’s stints in journalism had also shown him where he could cut corners.Would a reader recognize that the ballet’s press person had written the VanityFair story about the ballet? No problem, he would shuffle the letters of hisname around and become Aybern Edwards. The Ladies’ Home Journal wouldn’t runpromotional photographs for fear its readers might be offended by skirts thatdidn’t reach below the knees? No problem. For $600 Eddie engaged a pair ofpainters to add some length to the ballerinas’ skirts, and the pictures ran in atwo-page color spread that reached millions of unknowing subscribers.Then there was the problem of how to make the press pay attention to FloresRevalles, the principal ballerina in Scheherazade. He tried calling a pressconference, but only the Morning Telegraph showed up. So a short time laterEddie had Revalles photographed in a tight-fitting fringed gown at the Bronx Zoowith a long, harmless snake draped around her body. The seductive shot wasdistributed across the country, with a caption saying the subject had selected acobra, but through her charm and beauty had rendered it harmless, and that shecould be seen almost every day in Bronx Park musing over the reptile’s sinuousmovements.Newspapers ran that story on page one, which Eddie thought splendid. “I urgedRevalles to make a pet snake her trademark and never to travel without one,” herecalled. “She hesitated, but agreed—show people intuitively adjust themselvesto getting publicity for themselves, whatever the method. When I saw how easilyRevalles became a national celebrity, I recognized how necessary it was to lookbehind a person’s fame to ascertain whether the basis was real or fictitious.Public visibility had little to do with real value.“Without the snake or some equivalent, Flores Revalles, an attractive,provocative and talented girl, might well have had to wait years for nationalrecognition. The snake took up a long lag time.”9 [notes.html#ch1_9a]Stunts like that were standard for press agents of the day as they promotedpopular movie stars like Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and Norma Talmadge.But Eddie had a flair few could rival. He worked for clients with profiles highenough to ensure that his gimmicks would assume mythic dimensions, and unlikemost of his contemporaries, he learned from and grew with each new client. Andrecognizing that press coverage wasn’t the only way to draw attention to clientslike the ballet company, he enticed manufacturers of jewelry, handbags,lampshades, table linens, and other products to introduce models inspired by thecolor and design of Ballet Russe sets and costumes.Adella Hughes, founding director of the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra, watchedBernays’s machinations as the ballet prepared to visit the Midwest. “No projectwas ever better prepared for in the matter of publicity and promotion,” shewrote in her 1947 autobiography, Music Is My Life. “The Metropolitan Operapeople had placed this in the hands of Edward L. Bernays. The value and qualityof the promotional material that came from his office have never been equalledby any other organization within my experience.”10 [notes.html#ch1_10a]The New York Dramatic Mirror agreed, writing in its December 4, 1915, issue:“Congratulations are due Edward L. Bernays, general press representative of theSerge de Diaghilew Imperial Ballet Russe, for the excellent showing he has madein recent numbers of magazines. In these days of world crises it is, indeed, noeasy task to secure publicity for mere amusements. One can scarcely pick up aperiodical of late without finding illustrated articles about Karsavina,Nijinsky, Bohn and other leading members of the famous organization.”11[notes.html#ch1_11a]There were, of course, hitches, including some major ones that threatened tosabotage the tour. Nijinsky, who’d been ballyhooed more than anyone else in thecompany, was arrested in Hungary as an enemy alien and missed the whole firstseason. When he finally was freed, he sprained his ankle and missed most of thefollow-up tour. French conductor Pierre Monteux also was missing in action atfirst, in his case fighting Germans on the French front during World War I. Andit seemed everyone on the tour was romantically entangled with everyone else.The most titillating and tumultuous of those relationships, according toBernays, involved Diaghilev; his longtime lover, Nijinsky; Nijinsky’s new wife,Romola; and Diaghilev’s new lover, Léonide Massine, who had replaced Nijinskyduring the first U.S. tour.What kind of impression did those affairs of the heart and of high culture haveon the young promoter? His three years with the ballet “taught me more aboutlife than I have learned from politics, books, romance, marriage and fatherhoodin the years since,” he wrote five decades later. “I had never imagined that theinterpersonal relations of the members of a group could be so involved andcomplex, full of medieval intrigue, illicit love, misdirected passion andaggression. But while it happened, I took it all for granted as part of astimulating job.”12 [notes.html#ch1_12a]And it wasn’t just Bernays who was profoundly affected by the whole balletexperience. A nation that was used to chortling over Charlie Chaplin orrejoicing with the high-stepping Ziegfeld girls found itself drawn to this morerefined, decidedly European entertainment. “The whole country was discussing theballet,” Eddie wrote. “The ballet liberated American dance and, through it, theAmerican spirit. It fostered a more tolerant view toward sex; it changed ourmusic and our appreciation of it.… The ballet scenarios made modern art morepalatable; color assumed new importance. It was a turning point in theappreciation of the arts in the United States.”While he was wrapping up his work with the Ballet Russe in 1917, Eddie waspresented with another European artistic sensation to introduce to America:Enrico Caruso, the greatest tenor of his time and one of the music world’sgreatest characters.Plugging Caruso meant following what was becoming a familiar pattern. First camethe press releases, then the visits to editors and publishers. He also coinedphrases aimed at capturing public attention, dubbing Caruso “the man with theorchid-lined voice.” What distinguished this assignment from earlier ones wasthe amount of time Eddie spent observing the artist up close, staying in thesame hotels and remaining on call twenty-four hours a day during a swing throughPittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Toledo.Being on call sometimes meant handling crises—like the time when, at the banquetfollowing a nine-encore performance in Cincinnati, the great singer suddenlyslid under the table and wouldn’t come out until Eddie ordered someone to shut anearby window, the source of a draft that Caruso worried would give him a cold.Or when, at Pittsburgh’s Shenley Hotel, the tenor insisted on two extramattresses and seventeen more pillows. With help from the hotel manager Eddiedug up the extra bedding, and Caruso supervised the construction of atriple-tiered bed with pillows placed around the edges to keep out breezes.Then there was the time a hotel wedding party on the floor below was keepingCaruso awake. He called Eddie, who called the manager, who called the revelers,who, when they heard who the complainant was, willingly agreed to be relocatednine floors down.Of course, Eddie was well compensated for his labors as advance man andnursemaid. The Metropolitan Musical Bureau, which had hired him, took 15 percentof all concert receipts, and he earned 25 percent of the bureau’s profits, whichmeant thousands of dollars. What really thrilled the twenty-five-year-oldpromoter, however, was Caruso’s acceptance of him as an equal.“We acted like two boys toward each other—boys who like and understand eachother,” Eddie recalled. “We never had to translate our feelings into words.After I had seen him several times he called me by what I suppose was an Italiandiminutive added to my name—Bernaysi.”13 [notes.html#ch1_13a]Eddie also was fascinated by the public’s adoration of Caruso. And, in a lessonhe’d learned while working with the Ballet Russe and that he would later applyin behalf of corporate moguls and American presidents, he realized that suchimpressions could easily be fashioned or reshaped. “The overwhelming majority ofthe people who reacted so spontaneously to Caruso had never heard him before,”Eddie wrote. “The public’s ability to create its own heroes from wisps ofimpressions and its own imagination and to build them almost intoflesh-and-blood gods fascinated me. Of course, I knew the ancient Greeks andother early civilized peoples had done this. But now it was happening before myeyes in contemporary America.”The press agent’s own image got a lift from Caruso’s American visit. In atribute repeated by other profilers, music critic Pitts Sanborn of the New YorkGlobe referred to Eddie as “the Caruso of press agents and the press agent ofCaruso.”While most of his time in those early days was taken up boosting the careers ofother artists, he also experimented, at a time when anything seemed possible,with composing his own art. His proudest was a ten-poem set that ran in TheBroadway Anthology, a sixty-page book of poetry by four press agents.Like his other verses, the one about Caruso, titled “The Pillow Cases,” soughtto make press-agentry seem poetic, but it also underscored the thin line betweencleverness and chicanery:On the platform patiently nestled were twenty-six pieces of luggage,Twenty-six pieces of luggage, containing more than their content,Twenty-six pieces of luggage would get him the story, he had not given himself.Craftily, one lured the reporters to look on this bulging baggage.“Pillows and pillows and pillows,” was whispered, “Tonight he will sleep onthem.”Vulture-like swooped down the porters,Bearing them off to the taxis.Next morning the papers carried the story: “Singer Transports His Own Bedding,”But the artist slept soundly on Ostermoors that night.The baggage held scores for the orchestra.14 [notes.html#ch1_14a]* * *The war raging in Europe affected Eddie, as it did most Americans, long beforeAmerica joined in.First there was its dampening effect on grain exports, which effectively shutdown Ely Bernays’s lucrative grain-trading business. Americans’ demand for newsabout the war also complicated the job of Broadway press agents, who fought evenmore fiercely for the meager space that remained. And the enmity from thebattlefields spilled over even to the Ballet Russe, where Pierre Monteux,Diaghilev’s French conductor, agreed to conduct the works of dead Germancomposers like Beethoven but not live ones like Richard Strauss, whose TillEulenspiegel Monteux was scheduled to conduct.Eddie launched his campaign to enlist on April 6, 1917, the very day Americadeclared war on Germany. He signed up for the army, then wrote to top army andnavy officers to press his case. Finally he used a contact from the music worldto reach a colonel at the recruiting office, who scheduled him for a physical.The verdict: flat feet and defective vision. He demanded and received a secondexam, which produced the same results, and was officially turned down for activeduty.Rejection only made him more determined. He’d always been a bit insecure abouthis Austrian roots, his Jewishness, and most of all his diminutive 5-foot-4-inchstature. Now he was determined to prove he was a true American capable ofdefending his country. A string of successful publicity campaigns had taught himhow to get his way, so he decided to conduct a campaign in his own behalf. Hewrote to the Red Cross in France asking for “any position for which you believemy qualifications and past experience fit me.” He wrote to the Commission onMilitary Training offering to get musicians to perform at army camps. He evenhelped out at his local draft board, organizing its statistical and clericalfunctions.When none of that produced results, Eddie helped sell U.S. bonds and war savingstamps, promoted recruitment rallies, and arranged publicity for a patrioticmusic festival. He also outlined in Musical America what the journal called a“vivid, dramatic, convincing” plan for musicians to pitch in to the war effort.Whenever singers performed, he advised, they should include a song about themilitary. Same for orchestras and songwriters, while music store owners wereurged to donate instruments for the troops. And “naval recruiting would take ontremendous impetus if there were daily parades of bluejackets through the citystreets, headed by the ship’s band.”15 [notes.html#ch1_15a]Being involved on the periphery was frustrating, however, and he finally wangledan interview with Ernest Poole, head of the Foreign Press Bureau of the U.S.Committee on Public Information (CPI), the closest thing to a propaganda bureauthe government had back then. Poole seemed impressed by a stack of testimonialletters Eddie brought along, but he insisted, given Eddie’s birth in an enemycountry, that any assignment with the CPI await a complete investigation byMilitary Intelligence.The probe took several months, but the result was a letter from the chief ofMilitary Intelligence attesting that Eddie’s “abilities are unquestionablyremarkable. We have nothing in our files to indicate any disloyal activity andthe suspicions that might arise from his infancy in Austria and his Austrianparentage are far outweighed by the extremely cordial vouchers for his loyaltycontained in letters from Captain F. P. Adams, Earl Derr Biggers, FrankCrowninshield, and many others, all well aware of his Austrian nativity butconvinced of his desire to serve this country.”16 [notes.html#ch1_16a]Finally given his chance to serve, Eddie recruited Ford, InternationalHarvester, and scores of other American firms to distribute literature on U.S.war aims to foreign contacts and post U.S. propaganda in the windows of 650American offices overseas. He distributed postcards to Italian soldiers at thefront so they could boost morale at home, and he planted propaganda behind theGerman lines to sow dissent. He organized rallies at Carnegie Hall featuringfreedom fighters from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other states that were anxiousto break free of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. And to counter German propagandahe had American propaganda printed in Spanish and Portuguese and inserted intoexport journals sent across Latin America.In short, he helped win America over to an unpopular war using precisely thetechniques he’d used to promote Daddy Long-Legs and the Ballet Russe.Eddie wasn’t part of the CPI brain trust, as some of his reminiscences suggest;he was head of the Export Section and co-head of the Latin American Section ofthe Foreign Press Bureau, which was one of several bureaus of the CPI. Still,with most bureau staffers plucked from newspapers or universities, he was one ofthe few versed in the hard-nosed tactics needed to capture and keep theattention of the war-weary public in America and abroad. And, as always, heouthustled almost everyone else and exhibited more flashes of inspiredsalesmanship. Poole later remembered him as “one of the ablest and most devotedyounger workers on our staff.”17 [notes.html#ch1_17a] And in 1918, when therewas question about Eddie’s being drafted for a military clerkship, CPI ChairmanGeorge Creel drafted a letter saying, “As you know, our policy is not tointerfere with military service in any degree, but it is most certainly the casethat Mr. Bernays’ present position is far more important to the Government thanany clerkship that he might fill.”18 [notes.html#ch1_18a]When it came to his role at the Paris Peace Conference, where he was part of asixteen-person CPI press team, the reviews were less glowing. Before the teamset sail, Eddie put out a press release announcing the mission, and the New YorkWorld ran a story saying the “announced object of the expedition is ‘tointerpret the work of the Peace Conference by keeping up a worldwide propagandato disseminate American accomplishments and ideals.’”19 [notes.html#ch1_19a]That set off a firestorm, with Republicans in Congress charging that Creel andthe CPI were perpetuating their censorship of the press even though the war wasover and skewing coverage to favor the Democratic president, Woodrow Wilson.Creel insisted the mission was never intended to influence coverage by Americanreporters, and in a book published two years later he blamed the whole mess onEddie’s statement, although he didn’t name him specifically.20[notes.html#ch1_20a] James R. Mock and Cedric Larson, in Words That Won the War,confirmed that “Creel was not uniformly pleased with the post-Armistice work ofBernays.”21 [notes.html#ch1_21a]The battles over Paris can only be understood in terms of a widerdisillusionment in America over the bloody war the nation was emerging from.Many Americans still weren’t sure why they had fought or what they’d achieved,and they didn’t want to get further entangled overseas. The Senate, sensingthose sentiments, voted down the Treaty of Versailles and repudiated the Leagueof Nations, which President Wilson had passionately promoted and which Eddie hadenthusiastically embraced.Eddie was convinced he was being made a scapegoat for the failures in Paris, andhe sought to set the record straight in his autobiography. Poole, he wrote, hadokayed his statement to the press. And Creel was “tired or disheartened by thecriticism of the senators and the press. But whatever it was, it finally worehim down. I can’t understand his giving up; he had always been a fighter. But itis tragically clear that he did not fight to maintain the functioning of ourpress mission, which he himself had created to serve as a press relationsbody.”22 [notes.html#ch1_22a]Historians still debate those conflicting interpretations, but whoever’s right,the controversy offers insights into the way Eddie operated then and until hisdeath seventy-seven years later. He viewed activities with which he was involvedin epic terms, as events that helped shape American and world culture, whetherit was the Paris Peace Conference or the U.S. tours of Caruso and the BalletRusse. He was exceedingly proprietary about his role in those events, seeinghimself as having battled for the public good as others succumbed to temptation,and doing all he could to ensure that history would see him in the same heroiclight. And he always got the last word because he outlived contemporaries likeCreel, who died twelve years before Eddie wrote his autobiography and thereforewas unable to defend himself.Then there was Eddie’s temper. He prided himself on his mild-mannereddisposition, on speaking from fact rather than emotion, and on responding withreason rather than anger, but he was not one to be lightly crossed. Or, as Creeldiscovered, to play the patsy. It’s apparent in his memoirs, in the manyinterviews he granted, and in his relationships at the office and at home thatif you punched him, you’d best be prepared for a counterpunch or a barrage ofblows. Question his motives or effectiveness, and he’d marshal all his tacticaland creative resources to prove you wrong, doing so effectively enough to makeyou wonder whether you were wrong and to make you think twice about questioninghim in the future.All those personality traits were on full display in his battle with Creel andthe others, which he described in his memoirs with a vigor that suggested it hadtranspired months or weeks before, rather than forty-seven years earlier. “Ibelieve that Creel’s failure to insist on effective handling of Peace Conferencepress relations—that is, to maintain liaison with the public—helped to lose thepeace for us,” Eddie wrote. “In 1918 I was concerned about the future of theworld. I still am. Lack of effective public relations between President Wilsonand the people of the United States, historians confirm, was one of the reasonsfor the rejection of the League of Nations by the United States. The finalbreakdown of the League in the early Thirties was due in large part to the samelack of good public relations.”His experience in Paris may have left Eddie disillusioned about his government’sfailure to grasp the power of publicity, but it reinforced his belief in his newvocation and how it could mold the public mind. He had an opportunity to testthose tenets even before he got back to America.At one of many cocktail parties he attended in Paris after the breakup of theCPI press mission, he met Haisan Kendry, an aide to Arabia’s Emir Feisal, whofought alongside the fabled Lawrence of Arabia in the war against the Turks.Kendry and Feisal wanted Eddie’s help in rallying Arab-Americans to push forU.S. recognition of Arabia as an independent state, one of the few hopes theysaw for forestalling British and French bids to carve up the land.Eddie did eventually talk to lots of Arabs in New York, who “were strong forindependence for their homeland but had no inclination to dig into their pocketsand back their enthusiasm with necessary funds.” While things didn’t work outwith the emir, the experience planted in Eddie’s mind an idea that “doingpublicity for other nations, applying my experience to other countries, might bea fascinating, constructive career”—an idea he would later carry forward fromLithuania to Guatemala and from India to Israel.That was one of many dreams he brought back from Paris. The world was changing,he realized, and he saw himself on the cusp of that change, ready to exploit thenew optimism and opportunities infecting America and the world.“I knew that musical and theatrical press-agentry and publicity would notsatisfy me, after my experiences in the broader theater of world affairs,” hewrote, looking back. “I was intent on carrying forward what I had learned in mywork with Damaged Goods, the Russian Ballet, Caruso and the Committee on PublicInformation. The impact words and pictures made on the minds of men throughoutEurope made a deep impression on me. I recognized that they had been powerfulfactors in helping win the war.“Paris became a training school without instructors, in the study of publicopinion and people.… The process was as fortuitous as the flight of windsweptpollen.”"},{"pageContent":"2Lighting Up AMERICAU.S. tobacco tycoons scored nearly as stunning a triumph as did U.S. troopsduring World War I. When America joined the war, cigarettes were consideredunsavory, if not unmanly; most men preferred cigars, pipes, or chewing tobacco.But cigarettes proved more convenient in the trenches, new blended tobaccosproduced a milder and more appealing product, and Uncle Sam began puttingcigarettes in soldiers’ rations, with the result that many doughboys changedtheir smoking habits. Cigarettes were manly things now, the stuff of warriors.And as their use among men soared, so did the profits of the companies makingthem. All of which convinced cigarette makers that the time was ripe to open asecond front, this time targeting females.In 1928, just as they were beginning that push, Edward L. Bernays began workingfor George Washington Hill, head of the American Tobacco Company, which madeAmerica’s fastest-growing brand of cigarettes, Lucky Strikes. “Hill,” Bernaysrecalled later, “became obsessed by the prospect of winning over the largepotential female market for Luckies. ‘If I can crack that market, I’ll get morethan my share of it,’ he said to me one day. ‘It will be like opening a new goldmine right in our front yard.’”1 [notes.html#ch2_1a]The war and changing social mores already were helping Hill tap that lode. Manywomen who’d replaced men in factories or served abroad had taken up the habit,defying the taboo against female smoking, and college coeds were trying to teardown barriers against women smoking in public places. The share of cigarettesconsumed by women more than doubled from 1923 to 1929, but it still was just 12percent, far lower than Hill had hoped.The quickest way to rally more women to his cause, the tobacco man believed, wasto zero in on their waistlines. His theory was simple: slimness was coming intovogue, and cigarettes could be sold to the public, and especially to women, as afat-free way to satisfy their hunger. He’d already settled on a slogan—”Reachfor a Lucky Instead of a Sweet”—and to bring it to life he turned to thethirty-six-year-old Bernays, whom he’d been paying $25,000 a year just to beavailable.It was a wise choice. Bernays didn’t invent fashions like the pursuit of asvelte figure, but he was becoming the acknowledged master of accentuating suchtrends and capitalizing on them for his clients, a process he termed“crystallizing public opinion.” And during his eight-year association with thetobacco tycoon he would make clear his willingness to employ whatever antics ordeceptions it took to do that crystallizing, including trying to discredit newresearch linking smoking to deadly diseases.Bernays launched the campaign against sweets with his tried-and-true tactic ofenlisting “experts,” in this case convincing Nickolas Muray, a photographerfriend, to ask other photographers and artists to sing the praises of the thin.“I have come to the conclusion,” Muray wrote, “that the slender woman who,combining suppleness and grace with slenderness, who instead of overeatingsweets and desserts, lights a cigarette, as the advertisements say, has createda new standard of female loveliness.… I am interested in knowing if my ownjudgment concurs with that of others, and should be most happy to have youropinion on this subject.”2 [notes.html#ch2_2a] Who could argue that thin wasn’tbetter than fat? Few did, and the results were forwarded to newspapers, withsimilar “surveys” readied for actors, athletes, “beautiful girls,” societywomen, and male dancers.Magazines and newspapers also were furnished with the latest findings on theget-thin trend. For fashion editors, that meant photo after photo of slenderParisian models in haute couture dresses. For news editors, it meanttestimonials like one from the former chief of the British Association ofMedical Officers of Health warning that sweets caused tooth decay and advisingthat “the correct way to finish a meal is with fruit, coffee and a cigarette.The fruit,” Dr. George F. Buchan continued, “hardens the gums and cleans theteeth; the coffee stimulates the flow of saliva in the mouth and acts as a mouthwash; while finally the cigarette disinfects the mouth and soothes the nerves.”3[notes.html#ch2_3a]Bernays even persuaded dancing-school entrepreneur Arthur Murray to sign aletter testifying that “on the dance floor, results of over-indulgence arequickly revealed—causing embarrassment not only to one’s dancing partner butalso to other dancers by encroaching on more than a fair share of space on acrowded or, as is often the case, on a dance floor of limited proportions.Dancers today, when tempted to overindulge at the punch bowl or the buffet,reach for a cigarette instead.”4 [notes.html#ch2_4a]Not content to rely on the press or on the influence of experts, he also workeddirectly to change the way people ate. Hotels were urged to add cigarettes totheir dessert lists, while the Bernays office widely distributed a series ofmenus, prepared by an editor of House and Garden, designed to “save you from thedangers of overeating.” For lunch and dinner they suggested a sensible mix ofvegetables, meats, and carbohydrates, followed by the advice to “reach for acigarette instead of dessert.”And he proposed that homemakers hire kitchen cabinetmakers to provide specialspaces to hold cigarettes the same as they did for flour and sugar, urgedcontainer makers to provide labeled tins for smokes just as they did for tea andcoffee, and encouraged home economics writers to “stress the importance ofcigarettes in home-making.… Just as the young and inexperienced housewife iscautioned not to let her supplies of sugar or salt or tea or coffee run low, soshe should be advised that the same holds true of cigarettes.”5[notes.html#ch2_5a]Seldom if ever had a publicity campaign been carried out on so many fronts, andseldom if ever again will those responsible save, and make public, the detailsof their orchestrations the way Bernays did when he left to the Library ofCongress twenty-four boxes of records pertaining to the American TobaccoCompany.Those records also reveal that, as the anti-sweet campaign was catching on, theBernays office even took to writing jokes. “A moment in the mouth and ten yearsupon the hips” was one sent to The New Yorker, Life, and the Harvard Lampoon.Then there was a series of “Candy Advertisements of the Future,” with entrieslike this one: “A little fat guy smoking a Lucky? Yeh, he was here about tenminutes ago but he disappeared. Where did he go? Nowhere. I’m telling you, hejust smoked the Lucky and disappeared.”6 [notes.html#ch2_6a]The sugar companies and other enterprises weren’t amused. Hill got angry lettersfrom cocoa brokers and peanut butter makers, from the manufacturers of saltednuts and of candy, including one who charged that American Tobacco’s attackswere “unfair, unsportsmanlike and absolutely avaricious.” And Senator Reed Smootof Utah, a big beet sugar state, struck back from the Senate floor, calling thetobacco company campaign “an orgy of buncombe, quackery, and downright falsehoodand fraud.”Bernays responded by casting the controversy in the favorable glow of what hecalled “the new competition.” In a letter he drafted for business professors, tobe signed by an esteemed economist, Bernays wrote, “A battle carried on fairlyin this manner can serve the public in presenting both sides of a discussablequestion and in bringing the underlying democratic principle of free competitionfairly to the front.”7 [notes.html#ch2_7a]He realized that controversy breeds coverage, which almost always was good forhis client. And he knew that the high ground was the best place from which towage any battle—an assumption borne out by responses to his letters on the “newcompetition” from bank presidents and leading lawyers, along with the chairmenof economics departments at schools as diverse as Tufts University and the UtahAgricultural College. All this seemed to delight Hill, who wrote to Bernays, “Ithink the record shows that we have ‘shut them up’ pretty well.”8[notes.html#ch2_8a]A month after the first campaigns to attract women smokers, Hill ordered up asecond series, this time stressing moderation. The “moderation” he had in mind,of course, meant consuming fewer sweets and more cigarettes. Bernays respondedwith an intricate proposal for a Moderation League, one that, ironically, hewanted to model on the “the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Anti-CancerAssociations, Cardiac Associations etc.”9 [notes.html#ch2_9a]Hill balked at the long-range program, but loved Bernays’s proposal to sign upthe glamorous Ziegfeld Girls. Six of the dancers formed the Ziegfeld Contour,Curve and Charm Club, signing a pledge to “renounce the false pleasure of thetable—fattening foods, drinks, and cloying sweets. But I make no sacrifices: Ishall smoke cigarettes.”One thing led to another on the moderation front, and Bernays recalled that“what we did had all the effect of a long-range program, for as soon as oneaction was gaining momentum we proposed another and carried that out. Hill washappy.”10 [notes.html#ch2_10a] Which isn’t surprising since, as Hill exulted ina December 1928 letter to Bernays, American Tobacco’s revenues rose by $32million that year, and Luckies “show a greater increase than all otherCigarettes combined.”11 [notes.html#ch2_11a]Bernays himself never smoked, although his wife Doris did for several years. Andthe man who helped persuade tens of thousands of Americans to give up sweets infavor of cigarettes admitted later in an interview, “I didn’t like the taste [oftobacco]. I prefer chocolate.”12 [notes.html#ch2_12a]* * *Hill didn’t especially care what his PR man liked personally so long as hecontinued peddling tobacco products as if he meant it. Selling cigarettes wasmore passion than occupation for Hill, a rawboned, diminutive figure whopresided from behind a desk that seemed to take up half of the corner office hehad inherited from his father. Wearing a tilted Stetson with fishhooksprotruding from the brim, he’d hold court in a plainspoken, reasoned manner.Then, without warning, he would explode in a tirade at his stenographer,advertising executive, or anyone else who happened to be there. He insisted onbeing chauffered around in an open Cadillac, bodyguard at his side, and demandedthe car be stationed at the curb outside his Fifth Avenue office in case heneeded it. His greatest pleasure, however, revolved around the Lucky Strikes hewould eventually elevate to America’s best-selling cigarette brand. There wereLuckies stuffed in all four compartments of the cigarette box on his desk,Luckies secured by clamps to the windows of his car, and two dachshunds, Mr.Lucky and Mrs. Strike, roaming his estate in the Hudson Valley.Hill loved the way Bernays used the anti-sweets campaign to promote Luckies, butthat only whetted his appetite to crack the female market. So early in 1929 hesummoned Bernays and demanded, “How can we get women to smoke on the street?They’re smoking indoors. But, damn it, if they spend half the time outdoors andwe can get ‘em to smoke outdoors, we’ll damn near double our female market. Dosomething. Act!”13 [notes.html#ch2_13a]Bernays understood they were up against a social taboo that cast doubt on thecharacter of women who smoked, but he wasn’t sure of the basis of the inhibitionor how it could be overcome. So he got Hill to agree to pay for a consultationwith Dr. A. A. Brill, a psychoanalyst and disciple of Bernays’s uncle, Dr.Sigmund Freud.“It is perfectly normal for women to want to smoke cigarettes,” Brill advised.“The emancipation of women has suppressed many of their feminine desires. Morewomen now do the same work as men do. Many women bear no children; those who dobear have fewer children. Feminine traits are masked. Cigarettes, which areequated with men, become torches of freedom.”14 [notes.html#ch2_14a]That rang a bell for Bernays. Why not organize a parade of prominent womenlighting their “torches of freedom”? And do it on Easter Sunday, a holidaysymbolizing freedom of spirit, on Fifth Avenue, America’s most prestigiouspromenade?He gathered a list of thirty debutantes from a friend at Vogue, then sent eachof them a telegram signed by his secretary, Bertha Hunt. “In the interests ofequality of the sexes and to fight another sex taboo I and other young womenwill light another torch of freedom by smoking cigarettes while strolling onFifth Avenue Easter Sunday,” the dispatch explained. “We are doing this tocombat the silly prejudice that the cigarette is suitable for the home, therestaurant, the taxicab, the theater lobby but never, no, never for thesidewalk. Women smokers and their escorts will stroll from Forty-Eighth Streetto Fifty-Fourth Street on Fifth Avenue between Eleven-Thirty and One O’Clock.”15[notes.html#ch2_15a]A similar appeal was made through an advertisement in New York newspapers, thisone signed by Ruth Hale, a leading feminist and wife of New York World columnistHeywood Broun.The script for the parade was outlined in revealing detail in a memo fromBernays’s office. The object of the event, it explained, would be to generate“stories that for the first time women have smoked openly on the street. Thesewill take care of themselves, as legitimate news, if the staging is rightlydone. Undoubtedly after the stories and pictures have appeared, there will beprotests from non-smokers and believers in ‘Heaven, home and mother.’ Theseshould be watched for and answered in the same papers.”The memo also discussed prominent churches the parade would pass, and from whichit would like marchers to join up, including Saint Thomas’s, Saint Patrick’s,and “the Baptist church where John D. Rockefeller attends.”What kind of marchers would be best? “Because it should appear as news with nodivision of the publicity, actresses should be definitely out. On the otherhand, if young women who stand for feminism—someone from the Women’s Party,say—could be secured, the fact that the movement would be advertised too, wouldnot be bad.… While they should be goodlooking, they should not look too‘model-y.’ Three for each church covered should be sufficient. Of course theyare not to smoke simply as they come down the church steps. They are to join inthe Easter parade, puffing away.”The memo made it clear that not much would be left to chance: “On Monday of HolyWeek, the women should be definitely decided upon. On the afternoon of GoodFriday, they should be in this office, by appointment, and given their finalinstructions. They should [be] told where and when they are to be on duty Eastermorning and furnished with Lucky Strikes. As the fashionable churches arecrowded on Easter, they must be impressed with the necessity of going early.‘Business’ must be worked out as if by a theatrical director, as for example:one woman seeing another smoke, opens her purse, finds cigs but no matches, asksthe other for a light. At least some of the women should have men with them.”Finally, there was the matter of ensuring that the march would be preserved forposterity: “We should have a photographer to take pictures for use later in theroto sections, to guard against the possibility that the news photographers donot get good pictures for this purpose.”16 [notes.html#ch2_16a]The actual march went off more smoothly than even its scriptwriters imagined.Ten young women turned out, marching down Fifth Avenue with their lighted“torches of freedom,” and the newspapers loved it.Two-column pictures showed elegant ladies, with floppy hats and fur-trimmedcoats, cigarettes held self-consciously by their sides, as they paraded down thewide boulevard. Dispatches ran the next day, generally on page one, in papersfrom Fremont, Nebraska, to Portland, Oregon, to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Typicalwas this one from the United Press: “Just as Miss Federica Freylinghusen,conspicuous in a tailored outfit of dark grey, pushed her way thru the jam infront of St. Patrick’s, Miss Bertha Hunt and six colleagues struck another blowin behalf of the liberty of women. Down Fifth Avenue they strolled, puffing atcigarettes. Miss Hunt issued the following communiqué from the smoke-cloudedbattlefield: ‘I hope that we have started something and that these torches offreedom, with no particular brand favored, will smash the discriminatory tabooon cigarettes for women and that our sex will go on breaking down alldiscriminations.’”17 [notes.html#ch2_17a]Go on they did. During the following days women were reported to be taking tothe streets, lighted cigarettes in hand, in Boston and Detroit, Wheeling and SanFrancisco. Women’s clubs, meanwhile, were enraged by the spectacle, and forweeks afterward editorial writers churned out withering prose, pro and con.“Thumbs down,” said the News in Everett, Massachusetts, while John A. Schaffer,editor and publisher of the Chicago Evening Post, the Indianapolis Star, theTerre Haute Star, and the Muncie Star, agreed that “it is always a regret to meto see women adopt the coarser attitudes and habits of men.” But the headline inthe Ventura, California, Star, “Swats Another Taboo,” suggested the march mayhave achieved its aim, and a few weeks later Broadway theaters created a stir byadmitting women to what had been men-only smoking rooms.The uproar he’d touched off proved enlightening to Bernays. “Age-old customs, Ilearned, could be broken down by a dramatic appeal, disseminated by the networkof media,” he wrote in his memoirs. “Of course the taboo was not destroyedcompletely. But a beginning had been made.”18 [notes.html#ch2_18a]* * *The Torches of Freedom campaign remains a classic in the world of publicrelations, one still cited in classrooms and boardrooms as an example ofballyhoo at its most brilliant and, more important, of creative analysis ofsocial symbols and how they can be manipulated.Yet there’s another, more troubling side to the story of Bernays’s bid to getwomen smoking, one not discussed in his 849-page autobiography and nevermentioned in his countless tellings and retellings of the American Tobacco taleover the subsequent sixty-six years.For starters, he almost always concealed the fact that American Tobacco wasbehind his initiatives. Letters soliciting support from specialists came fromother, seemingly independent experts like Muray the photographer or Murray thedancer. Discerning readers might have suspected that a commercial interest hadprompted the campaign, but it would have taken a detective to pinpoint thecompany. The connection was further masked as it moved down the ladder from“expert” to press to public.That was just what Bernays envisioned, judging from memos to American Tobaccoofficials. In May 1929 he wrote Hill suggesting that letters drumming up supportfor the “new competition” initiative “be sent through a disinterestedorganization—for instance, a business syndicate.”19 [notes.html#ch2_19a] And aFebruary 1930 memo to another top tobacco company official advises workingthrough “a disinterested public-spirited citizen who would issue releases,statements, and letters just because he likes to.… There are many such people.We could find one.”20 [notes.html#ch2_20a]One way he found such citizens and specialists was by offering money. Sometimesit came as an honorarium, like the $100 he proposed paying a “dietician [who]talks on diet as the best means to produce moderate curves” and a “physiologistinduced to comment on benefits of modern trend to reasonable figure.” Then therewas the $5,000 he offered to donate to the favorite charity of Mrs. Charles DanaGibson, wife of the creator of the renowned Gibson Girl illustrations, if shewould agree to sign a statement saying “she smoked Luckies and that they werekind to her throat.”After he made the offer, Bernays wrote years later, “I watched her face. Ithought she would reject my offer with hauteur. I listened intently for what shewould say. She said quietly, ‘Why, of course, I’ll be delighted.’ That wasall.”21 [notes.html#ch2_21a]People who received letters signed by Mrs. Gibson and the others could call theoffices that mailed them to find out who was behind them. And many did, whichwas why Bernays left written instructions with one such office that “under nocircumstances is the name or telephone number of Edward L. Bernays to be givento anyone who calls.”22 [notes.html#ch2_22a]It may have been concerns like that—about secrecy or duplicity, bribes andbackpedaling—that led the American Bankers Association Journal to turn downBernays’s request to sign a letter on the “new competition.” James E. Clark,editor of the journal, replied that “after due consideration we find that thisis a matter in which we cannot participate in any way.”23 [notes.html#ch2_23a]To be fair, there’s disagreement in the public relations community even today onwhat level of masking a client’s identity is permissible, as contemporarycontroversies over cigarette promotions make clear, and there was far lessconsensus when Bernays was working for American Tobacco. Yet he set his own highstandard in many an interview, then and later, such as when he told a publicrelations historian in 1959 that whenever he enlisted experts “we did it in anopen or overt way.”Nowhere did his actions seem to contradict his words more overtly than at theEaster Parade down Fifth Avenue on March 31, 1929. His secretary, Bertha Hunt,was quoted in newspapers nationwide about her participation, but she failed tomention her connection to Bernays, American Tobacco, or Lucky Strikes. She toldNew York’s Evening World that she “first got the idea for this campaign when aman with her in the street asked her to extinguish her cigaret [sic] as itembarrassed him. ‘I talked it over with my friends, and we decided it was hightime something was done about the situation.’”24 [notes.html#ch2_24a] AShreveport, Louisiana, newspaper, meanwhile, wrote that “Miss Hunt says she isnot connected with any firm.”25 [notes.html#ch2_25a] And the communiqué sheissued said pointedly that she and her co-marchers had “no particular brandfavored.”26 [notes.html#ch2_26a]Before the parade, when women who’d been solicited to march called to ask howtheir names had surfaced, secretaries and other members of Bernays’s staff knewjust what they were expected to do: stonewall, which was what they did. And thetelegram that went to Vogue’s debutantes apparently made no mention of themarch’s actual sponsors.The outcome was one that most publicity men can only dream about: anirresistible script for a stunt, flawlessly executed, covered in nearly everypaper in America, with no one detecting the fingerprints of either Bernays orhis tobacco company client.If he began by disguising his role in the battle to get women smoking, Bernaysmore than made up for that in later years. The parade story in particular becamepart of his repertoire on the speaking circuit and in scores of interviews hegranted up until his death in 1995, and with each retelling the tale got morecolorful and his claims more sweeping. In his 1965 memoirs, for instance, hediscussed the slow process of breaking down conventions like the taboo againstwomen smoking. But by 1971 he was telling an oral historian at ColumbiaUniversity that “overnight the taboo was broken by one overt act,” the 1929Easter Sunday march.“I was interested in this as a manifestation of leadership,” Bernays continuedduring the Columbia session. “Hill was elated. Up to that time, no advertisinghad ever mentioned a woman smoking.”27 [notes.html#ch2_27a] In fact as early as1926, a year before Bernays went to work for Hill and three years before theEaster Parade, the makers of Chesterfields were displaying posters in which awoman asked her cigarette-smoking lover to “blow some my way.” The next yearMarlboro took up the entire back cover of Bon Ton, a woman’s magazine, with thisad: “Women—when they smoke at all—quickly develop discerning taste. That is whyMarlboros now ride in so many limousines, attend so many bridge parties, reposein so many handbags.” Even American Tobacco had cautiously ventured into thefray by 1927, with a series of testimonials from opera stars and actresses thatLuckies were soothing to the throat.28 [notes.html#ch2_28a]Michael Schudson, a professor of communications and sociology at the Universityof California at San Diego, argues that attitudes toward women smoking in publicstarted to shift substantially long before ads began appearing, thanks to mildercigarettes, social changes brought on by World War I, and the fact that, formany women, cigarettes had become a symbol of liberation. By the time the admenand Bernays weighed in, Schudson adds, “this was an old story.”29[notes.html#ch2_29a]Other historians give American Tobacco a larger role in persuading women tosmoke—but they say that was largely due to the efforts of Albert Lasker, atrailblazing advertising consultant who together with Hill dreamed up the notionof reaching for a Lucky instead of a sweet. They also credit public relationspioneer Ivy Lee, whose firm went to work for Hill a year before Bernays,continued there for decades afterward, and was paid $15,000 more a year thanBernays.Allan M. Brandt, who teaches the history of science and medicine at Harvard,acknowledges those other twists and turns of smoking history but still concludesthat no single event crystallized and exploited the wider trends as effectivelyas Bernays’s parade. Calling it “a publicity stunt of genuine historicalsignificance,” Brandt writes that “Bernays had successfully reinvigorated thecontroversies of the previous decade, enlisting the cultural tensions overwomen’s public smoking.…“Hill and Bernays shaped and promoted the cigarette’s status as the symbol ofthe independent feminist and the bold, glamorous flapper.”30[notes.html#ch2_30a]* * *The image of elegance that Bernays shaped for the smoking woman was one that,not long before, he’d made fun of.Back in the summer of 1927, a year before he hooked up with Hill, Bernays got acall for help from the ad agency representing Liggett and Myers, the makers ofChesterfields, Luckies’ archrival. How, they asked, would Bernays counter Hill’spitch that Lucky Strikes were so “kind to your voice” that even MetropolitanOpera stars smoked them? Since it was just the kind of slogan that Bernayshimself might have concocted, the admen reasoned, he was the perfect person torefute it.His response was a familiar one—he suggested the establishment of a front group,the same sort he’d created to promote Damaged Goods, the play aboutsyphilis—only this incarnation for Liggett and Myers was mainly intended to befun. The mission of the Tobacco Society for Voice Culture would be “so toimprove the CORDS of the THROAT through cigarette smoking that the public willbe able to express itself in SONGS OF PRAISE or more easily to swallowanything.” Free membership would be offered to “all lovers of the weed,including students of MUSIC, therapeutics, elocution or dentistry.” And its“ULTIMATE GOAL” would be “a smoking TEACHER for every SINGER.”31[notes.html#ch2_31a]When a New York judge ruled the society too frivolous to be incorporated,newspapers wrote about the decision just the way Bernays hoped they would. Hewas even more delighted when a judge in New Jersey said it was okay to openthere. As a sign of its goodwill the new society vowed to “establish homes forsingers, senators, and sensationalists whose voices have cracked under theweight and strain of their numerous cigaret testimonials.”Coverage for serious causes often is tough to come by, but the press, then asnow, loved a good joke—which was why The New Yorker ran an item in “Talk of theTown” poking fun at the Lucky ads and the New York Post was inspired by theTobacco Society to run a satire noting, “Whether It’s Egg-Plant, Soccer or Dr.Stratton You Oppose, Mr. Johnson Finds an Organization Exists to Collect YourDues.” The Medical Review of Reviews, which Bernays had once edited, took a moreserious slant, but one that served Liggett at least as well: it surveyed leadingphysicians who, as expected, confirmed that it was impossible for one cigaretteto do a better job than all the rest at preventing throat irritation.32[notes.html#ch2_32a]How did Hill take the taunts?First he investigated Bernays; then he hired him. “During the course of ourcampaign rough-looking characters slithered into our office from time to timeand asked for a list of our clients,” Bernays recalled, adding that he laterlearned the characters were detectives hired by Hill. Then David Schulte, ownerof the Schulte cigar store chain, called to contract his services. Bernays wastold to name his price for handling an unspecified project—with one catch: “Notadvising any tobacco interests but ours.” Bernays agreed, severing his ties withLiggett and signing on with Schulte for twice as long and 50 percent more money.It was another nine months before he learned that Schulte had been fronting forHill.33 [notes.html#ch2_33a]“‘You’ve been on the American Tobacco payroll for nine months,’” Bernays recallsHill crowing. “‘You were working for Liggett and Myers, weren’t you? And we gotyou from them, didn’t we? And you didn’t know anything about it. That’s whyLucky Strike is on top.’”Hill also failed to mention that he had hired Bernays’s competitor, Ivy Lee,years before. Neither of the public relations pioneers knew the other wasworking for American Tobacco, Bernays says, although Hill did eventually tellBernays why he’d hired them both: “If I have both of you, my competitors can’tget either of you.” And while Hill was generous with his PR advisers, theirretainers looked chintzy next to what he paid himself: in 1930, the year Luckiesrose to number one, Hill’s salary and bonuses totaled $2.5 million.“I deplored the methods he used,” Bernays recounted in 1965, “but I reasonedthat if Hill’s highly respected company behaved that way, it must be part of theaccepted pattern of corporate behavior. Possibly business was always conductedlike a war. Hill acted like a general, intent on confounding an enemy.”34[notes.html#ch2_34a] Several years later Bernays offered an even harsherjudgment: “In retrospect, Mr. Hill was a troglodyte, a dictator, intent onexerting the monopoly principle to the limit of his power to be the dominantfigure in his field.”35 [notes.html#ch2_35a]Those assessments almost certainly were colored by the harsh way historians hadjudged Hill, and by Bernays’s desire to distance himself from the tobacco manand the increasingly tainted tobacco industry. Regardless of what he said afterthe fact, Bernays had spent eight years deeply absorbed in the strange andintoxicating world of George Washington Hill, riding the waves of a soaring,swashbuckling enterprise, reveling in the fact that Hill was paying him anannual retainer that in today’s terms would amount to $300,000, and not seemingto mind Hill’s disregard for people deceived and rules broken. In fact Bernayswas the one who pointed the way in much of that deception and rule breaking. Andwhile Hill affected the attitudes of a cowboy and Bernays feigned anintellectual air, the two were a lot alike: Bernays was thirty-six when he wentto work for American, Hill just seven years older. Both had an abiding faith inAmerican capitalism and the rewards it could offer them, both had demandingfathers before whom they were determined to prove themselves, both sensed theywere at the cutting edge of an evolving profession, and both were anxious totest the limits.It’s unlikely the two ever became real friends, but they offered each othersomething valuable. Bernays’s gift for promotion helped Hill push Lucky Strikespast its archcompetitors, Camels and Chesterfields, while Hill enthusiasticallyendorsed Bernays’s most outlandish and expensive schemes.“I doubt whether a serious business committee today would permit me to retain apsychoanalyst to evaluate billboards [and] parade women on Fifth Avenue lightingcigarettes as symbolic torches of freedom,” Bernays reflected decades later.“These ideas would be regarded as far out, remote or risky. Or if by chance theywere accepted, they would be so diluted by the time they got into the works thatthey would be worn thin and possibly ineffective.”36 [notes.html#ch2_36a]* * *And what would today’s buttoned-down executives say about Bernays’s proposal toconduct a propaganda campaign in behalf of a color?That crusade seemed a bit far-fetched even in 1934. Hill remained determined towin over women smokers, but company surveys showed that many women wouldn’tsmoke Luckies because its green package with the red bull’s-eye clashed withtheir favorite clothing. “What do you suggest?” Bernays remembered Hill asking.The PR man replied, “Change the Lucky package to a neutral color that will matchanything they wear.” That was all Hill needed to set him off: “I’ve spentmillions of dollars advertising the package. Now you ask me to change it. That’slousy advice.”At which point Bernays offered advice that kicked off a campaign almost aslegendary as the Torches of Freedom parade. “If you won’t change the color ofthe package,” he reasoned, “change the color of fashion—to green.”37[notes.html#ch2_37a]Change an entire nation’s taste in colors? This was an idea so egocentric andeccentric that few public relations executives then or now would suggest it andfewer still would have any notion how to make it work. But Bernays’s specialtywas determining why the public preferred certain things, then reengineeringthose preferences to coincide with his clients’ needs, and he set off on hissix-month task with supreme confidence.First he analyzed the color itself, much as his uncle Sigmund might have done. Abook entitled The Language of Color told him that green was “an emblem of hope,victory, and plenty” and “symbolical of solitude and peace.” Those were upbeatthemes to build on. Even more encouraging were statistics showing that greenalready made up about 20 percent of the current lines being turned out by Frenchfashion houses.What Bernays needed was a big event to light up the world of fashion—maybe anEmerald Ball, he thought, a Bal Vert or a Mermaid Ball. He settled on a GreenBall, to be held at the stately Waldorf-Astoria and attended by New York’sleading debutantes, with proceeds going to some deserving charity. And he foundthe ideal hostess: Mrs. Frank A. Vanderlip, chairwoman of the Women’s Infirmaryof New York and wife of the former chairman of the National City Bank.All Mrs. Vanderlip needed to know, Bernays decided, was that proceeds would buymilk for undernourished kids, furnish clothing to cardiac patients, and supportother projects at the infirmary. “I explained,” he wrote later, “that a namelesssponsor would defray the costs up to $25,000; our client would donate ourservices to promote the ball; the color green would be the ball’s motif and theobligatory color of all the gowns worn at the ball.“I added, ‘I can assure you the cause is not Paris green, a poison.’”38[notes.html#ch2_38a]The fashion and accessories industries were his next target. A Green Ball wouldrequire not just green gowns but also, Bernays insisted, green gloves and greenshoes, green handkerchiefs, green bandeaux, and, yes, green jewelry. He began byapproaching the Onondaga Silk Company, filling in its enterprising president,Philip Vogelman, on plans for the ball and suggesting he could be at the leadingedge of the move to green—if he moved fast.Vogelman signed up and invited fashion editors to the Waldorf for a GreenFashions Fall Luncheon with, of course, green menus featuring green beans,asparagus-tip salad, broiled French lamb chops with haricots verts and olivettepotatoes, pistachio mousse glacé, green mints, and crème de menthe. The head ofthe Hunter College art department gave a talk entitled “Green in the Work ofGreat Artists,” and a noted psychologist enlightened guests on the psychologicalimplications of the color green. The press took note, with the New York Sunheadline reading, “It Looks Like a Green Winter.” The Post predicted a “GreenAutumn,” and one of the wire services wrote about “fall fashions stalking theforests for their color note, picking green as the modish fall wear.”But what if the new green clothing clashed with people’s drapes, curtains, orother house decor? A Color Fashion Bureau, organized under the auspices ofOnondaga Silk, was there with advice, sending 1,500 letters on the up-and-comingcolor to interior decorators, home-furnishings buyers, art industry groups, andclubwomen. The bureau also sent 5,000 announcements to department stores andmerchandise managers.Wouldn’t green clash with people’s summertime skin color? Not at all, accordingto this campaign advisory: Green “is most becoming to all degrees of burns—fromthe first strawberry flush to the last Indian brown. Since beach life providesthe highest degree of visibility for (and of) ladies, green is naturally highlysuccessful for bathing suits and beach ensembles.”39 [notes.html#ch2_39a]By now the bandwagon seemed to be rolling on its own. Mrs. Vanderlip enlistedfor her invitation committee luminaries like Mrs. James Roosevelt, Mrs. WalterChrysler, Mrs. Irving Berlin, and Mrs. Averell Harriman. Altman’s and BonwitTeller filled their Fifth Avenue windows with green gowns, suits, andaccessories, and Vogue ran two pages of sketches of the green dresses to bebrought to New York from Paris. Bernays was particularly delighted when “theunsuspecting opposition gave us a boost: the November magazine advertisementsfor Camel cigarettes showed a girl wearing a green dress with red trimmings, thecolors of the Lucky Strike package. The advertising agency had chosen greenbecause it was now the fashionable color.”40 [notes.html#ch2_40a]Just months after opening, the Color Fashion Bureau was besieged with requestsfor information—from 77 newspapers, 95 magazines, 29 syndicates, 301 departmentstores, 145 women’s clubs, 175 radio stations, 83 manufacturers of furniture andhome decorations, 64 interior decorators, 10 costumers, and 49 photographers andillustrators.The lesson, Bernays wrote years afterward, is that “emphasis by repetition gainsacceptance for an idea, particularly if the repetition comes from differentsources.”41 [notes.html#ch2_41a]Another lesson seemed to be that if you trod softly you could keep a secret thisbig. The official ball program danced around the issue of who was behind it bysaying, “Since the fashion trend seemed to point toward green and since green isa gay color for a fete, this ball is called The Green Ball.” A woman’s pageeditor in Philadelphia tried to learn more about where all the greenery wascoming from; when she couldn’t, she sent in this good-natured plea: “Let me knowwhat you are plugging. It is so adroit that even I, hard-boiled old she-dragon,can’t detect it. If, as I suspect, it is glazed chintz, I will add a descriptionwith place to buy, including prices.”42 [notes.html#ch2_42a]The Green Ball came off as planned, maybe better. It was “a gay, vivid night,something to remember,” Vogue reported. Later in the same issue: “We thought thelovely ladies who were all done up in green to take part in the pageant ofpaintings looked unusually lovely. ‘Green,’ we were murmuring to ourselves, ‘isa pretty difficult colour to wear, taken by and large,’ when we discovered thateach lady, before she went out into the limelight, had been made up by MarieEarle so that her face and her dress made a beautiful harmony.” And then this:“The Waldorf did the graceful thing, as usual, and put a flourishing finish onThe Green Ball last week by setting a Continental boîte de nuit. They called itthe Casino Vert and carried out the colour motif of the ball by flooding thecrystal chandeliers and the mirrored walls with a green-blue light.”43[notes.html#ch2_43a]But did Hill, who attended the ball, think it and the accompanying campaignbenefited him and his prized Lucky Strikes?Bernays says the tobacco tycoon seldom offered praise, and in the case of theGreen Ball “I don’t recall bothering to check Hill’s reaction.” Still, he adds,“the color green was so omnipresent that he could not escape it.… [The ball]firmly established green’s predominance.”44 [notes.html#ch2_44a]Other, more neutral observers disagree over the success of the green campaign.Edwin P. Hoyt, in his book The Supersalesmen, says the whole episode was a greatexample of the “phenomenal mistakes” Hill made during his career. “He wanted toestablish green that year as the color for women’s fashions. He faileddismally.”45 [notes.html#ch2_45a] But sixteen years later author Robert Sobelreached a decidedly different conclusion: “Green did become the ‘in color’ thatyear. Hill was pleased. Bernays received a bonus.”46 [notes.html#ch2_46a]* * *Bernays’s crusade in behalf of the color green was a precursor to today’spromotions by Macy’s and other retailers of products featuring the “Colors ofvan Gogh” and the “Palette of Picasso.” Similarly, his bids to link smoking topopular causes like women’s liberation and the stay-thin movement helped inspirecontemporary efforts to sell cigarettes by linking them to the macho MarlboroMan and super-cool Joe Camel.But not all of Bernays’s labors for Hill reached those levels of legend, or ofcontroversy.There were, for instance, the billboards Hill wanted to display depicting awoman offering a package of Luckies to two men. Bernays objected, saying theymade him “queasy” and recommending that, before the billboards were put up, theyshould be viewed by Dr. Brill, the psychiatrist who dreamed up the “torches offreedom” concept. Brill worried that having three people in the picture wouldconfuse observers. “‘Two people should appear, one man and one woman. That islife,’” Bernays recalled the psychologist saying. “‘Nor should a woman offer twomen a package of cigarettes. The cigarette is a phallic symbol, to be offered bya man to a woman. Every normal man or woman can identify with such a message.’“The use of psychoanalysis as the basis of advertising is common today,” Bernaysadded, but Brill’s “lightning analysis” of the cigarette poster “may have beenthe first instance of its application to advertising.”47 [notes.html#ch2_47a]Bernays also proposed that, for the first time, a U.S. tobacco companyaggressively court black customers. “Has any one ever found out what the likesof the colored people of the U.S. are in regard to cigarettes?” he asked in a1931 memo to a top official at the American Tobacco Company. “I find that fivemillion negroes are church members in the U.S. I find there are a million negrofarmers in the U.S. We have just developed a close contact with the negro press,and if Luckies are the favored cigarettes, it may be possible to develop somepropaganda along these lines.”48 [notes.html#ch2_48a] But officials at thetobacco company declined, fearing, they said, that to take the Associated NegroPress up on its offer to do a story on American Tobacco’s black employees wouldobligate American to run ads in papers read by a primarily black readership. Andthat, the officials apparently worried, might offend the company’s whiteclients.Quashing gossipmongering was another area where Bernays was becoming an expert.One rumor in the 1930s had Lucky Strike firing all its salesmen, an especiallyinflammatory charge in the midst of the depression. Bernays’s first rule indeflating rumors was never to repeat them publicly, for fear of fanning them. Arelated precept held that the best antidote was to publicize facts and figuresshowing the rumor couldn’t be true, which in this case meant letting people knowabout the large number of salesmen still working for American.A more vexing falsehood was that American Tobacco workers had the dreadeddisease leprosy and that Luckies were being contaminated. The rumor was tracedto a taxi stand on New York’s West Forty-second Street, but knowing whoinitiated it didn’t help end it. That took getting the top health official inRaleigh, North Carolina, to give American an award for “the scrupulouscleanliness of its Raleigh factory.”The whispering campaign where he really got to flex his powers of persuasionbegan near the end of 1930, when word spread that American Tobacco had fired itsJewish workers.Knowing the rumor was unfounded, Bernays decided to take his response directlyto Jewish cigar store owners across New York City. His emissaries would beAmerican Tobacco salesmen, but it was key that they know just what to do andsay. He outlined his instructions in a December 1930 memo: “The salesman shouldenter a shop and gauge the character of the shop. He should then say, dependentupon the character of the shop, in Yiddish, in English with a Yiddish accent, orin straight English, ‘Good morning. My name is Mehr. How is business?’“If the answer is ‘bad,’ as it will pretty surely be, the salesman should say inYiddish ‘Well, we Jewish boys certainly have nothing to worry about with theAmerican Tobacco Company. Fortunately, in this depression there is one highspot—and that is tobacco. Whether times are good or times are bad, everybodywants to smoke. Now that’s true of Salisburys. Why don’t you stock some ofthem?’ Then plunge into sales talk about Salisburys.…“If the attitude is questionable about the relationship of the Jews to theAmerican Tobacco Company, the salesman should say this—’All I can tell you, likeone gentleman to another gentleman—it’s a lie. I’ve been with the AmericanTobacco Company. I’m a good Jew. My father was a rabbi. There are Jewish girlsin the clerical department; there are Jewish boys in the order department. Theygot a Jewish lawyer, Louis Levy. They got a Jewish advertising man, AlbertLasker. They got me and a lot of other Jews selling. I know Blumberg, andGreenberg, and Stilberg.’“Nothing more than that should be done,” Bernays wrote. “There should be noemotion, no argument, no bets, no gathering of crowds.… After a day’s such work,if the plan is followed out carefully, we will have a picture of the situation,and we will then make plans, dependent on what the situation is, to meet thesituation.”49 [notes.html#ch2_49a]He also attacked the rumor on other fronts: getting the American JewishCongress, the Jewish Tribune, and others to investigate and eventually repudiatethe charges; showering the press with releases about high-ranking Jews atAmerican Tobacco and how some of the firm’s most notable innovations were“largely attributable to the business acumen of the Jew”; and dispatching staffmembers across the country to monitor the reaction and dispel fearmongering.As the rumors began to fade, Hill, at Bernays’s urging, let Jewish groups knowhow grateful he was for their help—sending donations to the Jewish Home forChildren, the Jewish Philanthropic Societies of New York, the Jewish TelegraphicAgency, and the Jewish Welfare Federation; joining the Jewish PublicationSociety; and giving the Jewish War Veterans of the United States 5,000 LuckyStrikes to hand out to soldiers wounded in the war.* * *There was one “rumor,” however, that wouldn’t go away for Hill and hiscompatriots: that cigarettes could be killers.The public in the 1920s and 1930s didn’t have the kind of compelling evidencethat’s available today linking tobacco to cancer, heart disease, strokes, andother maladies. But people did know that smoking made them cough, irritatedtheir throats, and had other unpleasant aftereffects. That, after all, was whyAmerican Tobacco had recruited opera stars to testify that Luckies soothed thethroat, and the hollowness of that claim made it easy for Bernays to launch hiscampaign of ridicule for Liggett and Myers.While he made fun of American’s response, Bernays knew the company was smart tofocus on public apprehension over the safety of its products, and when he wentto work for Hill he made health issues a major target of his propaganda.Spitting was an early test case. Traditionally, cigars had been rolled by hand,with factory workers twirling the end of the cigar between their lips to moistenand shape, it. Cremos, made by a subsidiary of American, ended that practicewhen it mechanized its factory, and Hill wanted Bernays to ensure the companygot credit.“I remembered that Charles Dickens, in his notes on American travel, hadcomplained of the nasty American habit of spitting in public, a practice thatwas still prevalent despite anti-spitting ordinances,” Bernays wrote, lookingback. “Spitting was a menace to health, since saliva could transmit tuberculosisand other diseases. I decided to draw the public’s attention directly to thedangers of spitting and indirectly to the health-safety factor in Cremocigars.”50 [notes.html#ch2_50a]The result was a massive campaign to get cities and towns to post signs warningagainst spitting, supplied by the tobacco company, and advertisementsproclaiming, “We know spit is a horrid word but it is worse on the end of yourcigar.… The war against Spitting is a crusade of decency … join it. SmokeCertified Cremo!”American also sought to get out the word on its “toasting process,” whichbombarded tobacco used in Luckies with the era’s latest elixir—ultraviolet rays.Bernays’s claims about toasting were nearly identical to the ones he’d madelight of four years earlier, when he was with Liggett. The toasting process, hisreleases proclaimed, “gives you a cigarette free from harsh irritants” and “kindto your throat.”He wasn’t the only one making such pitches, of course. Old Gold promised “Not acough in a carload,” Camels countered with “They don’t get your wind,” andChesterfields were said to be “much milder” and “will not harm nose and throat.”Which suggests a question: Did Bernays realize then the deadly nature ofproducts he was peddling?Absolutely not, he insisted in a letter to the Boston Globe in 1972. “When Iworked with George Hill of the American Tobacco Co. no one had yet discoveredthat cigarettes caused cancer. Cigarettes four decades ago were considered ‘kindto your throat.’ Opera stars endorsed them.”51 [notes.html#ch2_51a]The opera star endorsements were, as he well knew, a sham, which was why he madefun of them at the time and why his citing them forty years later isdisingenuous at best. Further, his papers at the Library of Congress, whichbecame public upon his death in 1995, make clear he had good reason to suspectthe perils of smoking as early as 1930, more than fifteen years before tobaccocompanies acknowledged that they suspected smoking was dangerous. The Bernayspapers also make clear that he helped his client, American Tobacco, keep suchdoubts under wraps.Consider the project he initiated to have a medical researcher produce abstractsof journal articles on the health effects of tobacco. One such summary, from astudy in the early 1930s, referred to a “carcinoma that had developed afterthree years in a rabbit subjected to tobacco” and said “the cancer-producingproperty of tobacco has been determined in clinics.”Bernays attached that abstract to a May 22, 1933, letter to Paul Hahn, one ofHill’s top aides, writing, “As you will see, certain of the material in thesearticles is unfavorable to tobacco. However, I do not feel that there isanything immediate to be done. I do feel that serious attention should be givento the problem of having ready a strong offensive in case the press should giveprominence to the recurring articles which I note, from time to time, on therelationship of smoking and carcinoma. I believe that the American TobaccoCompany and the tobacco interests generally should be fully prepared withauthentic information if, as, and when the need for such information occurs.”52[notes.html#ch2_52a]The next day Bernays sent Hahn another summary, this one discussing “twoadditional negative reports from important German medical magazines.”“The typical symptoms of acute [nicotine] poisoning are nausea, vomit, diarrhea,and blood pressure increase,” the abstract warned. “Symptoms of chronic nicotinepoisoning are extracardiac systoles, accelerated pulse with subsequent irregularcardiac activity; loss of appetite associated with gastric disturbance; vertigo,fatigue, nervousness, irritability.… It is assumed, though not definitelyproved, that the nicotine tolerance of the habitual smoker is attributable tomore rapid organic destruction, chiefly of the liver. Heavy smokers amongnursing mothers excrete amounts of nicotine through the milk glands which canaffect the baby.… Recent observations have shown that cases of angina pectorison a purely nervous base [sic] in younger persons are not infrequently due tosmoking tobacco.”“I personally believe that moderate smoking is a harmless pleasure, and ahealthy person used to smoking can be allowed about four cigars and twelvecigarettes daily without harm,” the author of the abstract said. But he or shewent on to conclude that “the only reliable method of avoiding nicotine is bygiving up smoking.”53 [notes.html#ch2_53a]In a memo to American Tobacco, Bernays said that the nicotine findings “indicateagain what we must be prepared to answer.” In fact, he was already helping toprepare that answer. One approach to newspaper stories on the dangers ofsmoking, he wrote Hahn, was to “lay down a barrage to the editors of thecountry, reflecting to them authoritative opinion on the cigarette in relationto the physiology of the human body—doing this not so much with the purpose ofgetting this material printed, but doing it rather to build up such aconstructive picture of the cigarette in the minds of the editors that when astory of the type I am sending you comes along, they will hesitate to print itbecause they have been convinced of the contrary point of view.”54[notes.html#ch2_54a]The cynicism of his approach is inescapable. As his memos to Hahn indicate,Bernays took seriously the medical evidence he was gathering on the dangers ofsmoking, yet he was urging American Tobacco to do all it could to ensure thatnewspaper editors dismiss that evidence.Bernays also was working with several doctors who were willing to argue thetobacco company’s side of the story. An article to be sent out under thesignature of one of them, Dr. Clarence W. Lieb, observed that “men worship atvarious shrines: Venus (love), Bacchus (liquor), Mars (war), Ceres (sweets,starchy foods), and Lady Nicotine (tobacco). The least harmful is the latter.“The benefits of tobacco are: (1) It is a pleasure. (2) A good laxative afterbreakfast. (3) Checks obesity by lessening the appetite. (4) Aids nutrition bystimulating the secretory functions of the stomach. (5) It consoles the lonely.(6) It aids contemplation. (7) It is a manual as well as oral activity. (8) Itpromotes sociability.” The article concedes that “smoking is not good for: (1)The young. (2) The aged. (3) Those suffering from hyperacidity. (4) Thosesuffering from malnutrition. (5) Those having loose bowels. (6) Those havingasthma. (7) Those having any chronic disease, except when tobacco acts as aplacebo. (8) Those individuals, of whom there are some, who have an idiosyncrasyagainst strawberries or cucumbers.”The proposed article ends on the sort of upbeat note Bernays was trying tostrike for his tobacco client and that the public back then listened to:“Nicotine is, of course, a mild poison. So is coffee or tea. So, too, do certainhighly respected foods produce poison in the human system when taken to excessor in wrong combinations.”55 [notes.html#ch2_55a]Whatever his attitude in public, at home he did all he could to persuade hiswife, Doris, to give up her pack-a-day habit. “He used to hide my mother’scigarettes and make us hide the cigarettes. He didn’t think they were good forMother,” remembers his elder daughter, also named Doris. Anne, his youngerdaughter, recalls that when her father found a pack of her mother’s Parliaments“he’d pull them all out and just snap them like bones, just snap them in halfand throw them in the toilet. He hated her smoking.”Doris eventually gave up smoking after a physician warned her, in the late1940s, that it was causing circulatory problems in her leg. “The doctor said shemight need complete amputation,” Anne remembers, “and that scared hersufficiently that she just stopped smoking. One day she was and the next shewasn’t. She never had another cigarette.”56 [notes.html#ch2_56a]* * *Decades later, when the surgeon general and other medical authorities releasedincontrovertible evidence of the dangers of smoking, Bernays used his talents ofpersuasion to help undo addictions he’d help build.In 1964 he unveiled a bold and detailed plan to transform smoking into “anantisocial action which no self-respecting person carries on in the presence ofothers.” To do that, he proposed enlisting moviemakers and radio and televisionpersonalities, advertising executives, clergy and doctors, in a bid “to outlawand eliminate cigarette smoking.”57 [notes.html#ch2_57a] Those would beambitious goals even for today’s antismoking groups, with their extra resources,scientific backing, and public support, but when he unveiled it more than thirtyyears ago the Bernays plan was considered downright radical. He eventuallyjoined in more realistic initiatives like one that got cigarette advertisingbanned from radio and television, a move he said “got rid of a sense of guilt”he had carried around for years.To truly be absolved of that guilt, however, he would have had to admit that hismemorable campaigns helped set the standard of no-holds-barred secretive tacticsthat the tobacco industry and its PR men have adhered to ever since. He wouldalso have had to acknowledge the true extent of his suspicions, as early as the1930s, about the risks of smoking. Instead, he insisted up until his death thathe’d concocted schemes like the Torches of Freedom parade only because he didn’tknow back then that smoking was dangerous, and his claim seemed credible becausethat was the line tobacco companies were taking.Why would he maintain a fiction belied by his own American Tobacco files, whichhe voluntarily donated to the Library of Congress?He may not have remembered just how clearly his papers contradicted the story hewas telling, especially since they were nearly forty years old by the time heleft them to the library, and he probably didn’t have the time or energy then toreview all 805 boxes. He may not have felt the abstracts he received on healthstudies offered conclusive enough proof on smoking’s dangers. Or he may not havebelieved the files could harm him, since the library had agreed not to make thempublic until after he died.It’s even more likely, however, that he understood public opinion well enough toknow what a bombshell it would be, for him and for the tobacco industry, toreveal how early they had suspected smoking’s deadly effects. He wouldn’tactually destroy any of his files, either because that would be dishonest orbecause he felt they were too precious a record of his achievements. So hesimply did what he’d done in so many campaigns for American Tobacco: he toldonly that part of the smoking story that served his interests and those of hisformer client, and he told it often enough, and in such convincing fashion, thathe probably began to believe his own rhetoric."},{"pageContent":"3The Big THINKPublicity men traditionally sold their services based on their ability to chartthe straightest course to their client’s objective. If the aim was to sell morebacon, they would find ways to take a bite out of the business of otherbacon-makers. If they were working for a book publisher, they would promote histitles and push the press for favorable reviews.Eddie Bernays’s approach was considerably more circuitous and infinitely moreeffective.In the mid-1920s a huge bacon producer, Beechnut Packing Company, hired Bernaysto help restore sales that had sagged as a country on the run trimmed itsmorning meal to juice, toast, and coffee. Deciding there was no point in tryingto steal business from other ailing bacon producers, Bernays resolved totransform America’s eating habits. He persuaded a famous New York doctor towrite his colleagues asking whether they supported hearty or light breakfasts.Hearty won big, newspapers spread the word, people followed their physicians’advice, and sales soared of the two items most identified with bigbreakfasts—bacon and eggs. Thus the artery-clogging combination became foreverlinked in the American lexicon as well as on the American breakfast table.He used a similar strategy in 1930 when he went to work for Simon and Schuster,Harcourt Brace, and other major book publishers. “Where there are bookshelves,”he reasoned, “there will be books.” So he got respected public figures toendorse the importance of books to civilization, and then he persuadedarchitects, contractors, and decorators to put up shelves on which to store theprecious volumes—which is why so many homes from that era have built-inbookshelves.The Bernays touch also shaped the world of medicine. Shortly after he signed onwith the Multiple Sclerosis Society, he pointed out that the name of the illnesswas more of a mouthful than most Americans could digest. He urged pruning itback to MS, which the society did, helping transform an obscure ailment into afavorite cause.Bernays’s tactics differed, but his philosophy in each case was the same. Hiredto sell a product or service, he instead sold whole new ways of behaving, whichappeared obscure but over time reaped huge rewards for his clients and redefinedthe very texture of American life. Some analysts have referred to his methods asstrategic or lateral thinking—mapping out a solution based on a client’sstanding in the wider economy and society rather than on narrow, verticalconsiderations like how they were faring against other bacon makers orbooksellers. Bernays preferred the phrase “appeals of indirection,” plotting apath to a client’s goal that seemed roundabout but ultimately removed underlyingas well as immediate impediments.In retrospect we can pin an even simpler label on what he did: Big Think.Big Think meant more than just refusing to be constrained by convention; Bernaysconsciously defied convention. He was convinced that ordinary rules didn’t applyto him, and he repeatedly proved that he could reshape reality. He also tookclients to places they had never dreamed of going, places that scared them atfirst but thrilled them when, as often happened, the public rallied, as he’dpredicted. Sometimes his campaigns involved strategies so complex and obliquethat even he had trouble following the script, which often involved frontgroups, letter-writing campaigns, and alliance after alliance; at other timeshis tactics were artfully simple, like reducing a name to its initials.Sometimes they appealed to the best instincts of clients and consumers; at othertimes he launched schemes he knew were wrong, and he willfully deceived thepublic. Always, however, there was a grand concept, the brash, bold, bigthinking that grew out of his being more ingenious than his competitors, morecocksure, and generally more expensive. The big fees made him rich, but moreimportant, they helped convince clients that his advice was worth its cost andthat, since he was earning as much as their chief executive officer, it was withthe CEO that he should be plotting strategy.Big Think was part P. T. Barnum and part J. P. Morgan, blended in a way that wasuniquely E. L. Bernays.This new and evolving approach to publicity, its creator insisted, required newand evolving job titles. Before World War I he was content to call himself apress agent. By 1919, when he opened his first office in three rooms on EastForty-eighth Street, he’d decided “publicity direction” better conveyed thesweep of his labors. But something still was missing, something that wouldconvey the seriousness of his advice and the range of his skills. So a yearlater, when he was testifying in a lawsuit involving his client Enrico Carusoand a reporter asked his profession, he tried yet another title, one he feltfinally was worthy of his new enterprise: public relations counselor.Those who caught his testimony that day could have been excused for mistakingthe small man with the black mustache and gray demeanor for a traveling salesmanor perhaps a new arrival from Central Europe. But if they looked closer they’dhave noticed the passion with which he pleaded his case, the kind of passionthat was redefining the fledgling field of public relations. Advertisers hadalways pressed consumers to pick one product over another, and press agents hadshilled stories for clients, but now Bernays and a band of colleagues wereskillfully manipulating symbols and trends in ways that affected what averageAmericans ate for breakfast, what sorts of homes they bought, and what colorsthey chose. And the PR men were doing it so adeptly that most people neverrealized it was happening and couldn’t have conceived of how it was transformingthe country.Today, thanks to records made available upon Bernays’s death in 1995, we canlook backstage and see what strings he was pulling. And in the process we canbetter understand the dramatic world of public relations, a universe that hascome to include hundreds of thousands of publicists, pollsters, advertisingexecutives, and strategic planners, and that plays a more profound role thanever in our lives.Most of what Bernays did at the beginning, when he was severing his ties to theCommittee on Public Information and setting up his own practice, was aimed athelping American industry accommodate to the economic and social changes wroughtby World War I. The pattern had been for firms to alter their product line orpitch to fit changing consumer tastes; Bernays believed that, approached theright way, consumers themselves could be made to do the adjusting.That’s what happened when Venida, a leading maker of hair nets, watched inhorror as more and more women cut their hair so short they didn’t need mesh tomaintain it. Some had grown used to wearing short hair when they worked inwartime factories; others were aping dance idol Irene Castle, who’d bobbed herhair so it wouldn’t interfere with her spins and dips. Bernays didn’t panic, andhe didn’t try to sell more hairnets. Rather, he got health officials to urge,and occasionally order, food workers to wear nets to keep their hair out of thefood. He got labor leaders to urge women factory workers to wear nets to preventtheir curls from being caught in the machinery. And he got leading artists toproclaim that the standard for American beauty was long, flowing locks—which, ofcourse, needed to be kept in place with a net.Luggage makers were equally alarmed by changing tastes when they sought outBernays in the late 1920s. Flapper fashions, which included scanties, shortskirts, and cloche hats, took up less space than earlier multilayered styles.Staterooms on ships and trains allocated less and less room for luggage, andnew-style traveling salesmen traveled light. The PR man counterattacked, againthrough the back door. He got magazines and newspapers to set a standard wherebywell-bred travelers carried large wardrobes, and he urged architects to designmore storage space, colleges to inform students of the many bags they needed tobring to campus, and health officials to explain why it was unsanitary to sharea valise. Then he found a celebrity—singer-comedian Eddie Cantor—to pose whilepacking his big trunk for a concert tour.The formula was simple: Bernays generated events, the events generated news, andthe news generated a demand for whatever he happened to be selling.“Not only God but counsels of public relations are masters of the mystic pullsof gravitation,” The Nation observed in a 1927 issue. “Mr. Bernays holds,furthermore—and we cannot but agree with him—that the principle is applicable toall types of merchandise.… And so, happily, the consumer may forever cease frombuying what he freely wants; and the Kingdom of Heaven of the Salesman will comeupon earth.”1 [notes.html#ch3_1a]* * *Working that kind of otherworldly charm was easiest with major clients, who wereless likely to be scared off by the machinations of Big Think and more likely tohave the resources needed to pull it off.The Bernays client list, which he said numbered 435 over his forty years offull-time practice, reads like a Who’s Who in American commerce and culture ofthat era—General Electric, General Motors, Nash-Kelvinator, Philco Radio andTelevision, and U.S. Radium. From the world of art Bernays had the BalletTheater and New York Philharmonic, playwright Eugene O’Neill, actor-theatermanager Henry Miller, and painter Georgia O’Keeffe; from finance there wasMutual Benefit Life Insurance as well as Title Guarantee and Trust; and, fromthe communications industry, Columbia Broadcasting System, National BroadcastingCompany, Cosmopolitan, Fortune, Good Housekeeping, Ladies’ Home Journal, the NewRepublic, and Time. Hoteliers came to Bernays for advice, too, from the Waldorfand McAlpin in Manhattan, the Saint George in Brooklyn, and the Book-Cadillac inDetroit. Union clients included the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and theInternational Union of Electrical Workers, and retailers included the GreatAtlantic and Pacific Tea Company, F.W. Woolworth, and R. H. Macy.Procter and Gamble was one of Bernays’s biggest clients and, after thirty years,his most loyal. Its problem in the early days was simple but vexing: childrendidn’t care about keeping clean and had no use for P&G’s primary product, Ivorysoap. His solution was simple but brilliant: “Children, the enemies of soap,would be conditioned to enjoy using Ivory.”The idea came to him when a sculptor wrote to Procter and Gamble asking for bigblocks of Ivory to carve in place of clay. Seizing on the publicity potential ofthis idea, Bernays set up a committee, which in 1924 organized a National SoapSculpture Contest with cash awards and lots of press coverage. Sculptors,architects, and other artists over the years transformed blocks of soap weighingup to 1,000 pounds into likenesses of portly William Howard Taft and sinewyCharles Lindbergh, Alice in Wonderland, the Empire State Building, and a battlescene from the Middle Ages.The focus eventually shifted to schoolchildren, who received brochuresexplaining that the only tools needed were “a pen knife or paring knife. Twoorange sticks (such as ladies use for the care of their fingernails—you can getthem at any drug store). A wire hair-pin about three inches long. A yard ofstring or covered wire.” The leaflet also advised youngsters to “use discardedmodels for face, hands and bath. You will love the feeling of cleanliness thatcomes from an Ivory Soap bath once a day.”2 [notes.html#ch3_2a]The contests continued for more than thirty-five years, until 1961, using amillion cakes of soap a year and inducing untold thousands of contestants fromages six to eighty-six to spend hour after hour whittling away at big white barsof Ivory. While its commercial success is tough to measure, Bernays’s sculptingscheme clearly helped make Ivory the all-American soap, much as he’d establishedbacon and eggs as the all-American breakfast.Not all of his grand conceptions for Procter and Gamble panned out so well,though, and some never made it to the drawing board. Consider Bernays’s plan ofcounterattack when P&G’s archrival, Lever Brothers, tried to replace Ivory withits own floating soap—Swan. The way to sink Swan, Bernays argued, was to getreporters to write stories saying that swans were vicious creatures thatattacked children. P&G executives didn’t buy that tactic. “[Bernays] thought theonly way to respond was tearing [Lever Brothers] down a little and hopefullydestroying them, which of course [his tactic] never in the world would havedone,” recalls Oliver Gale, who ran P&G’s public relations department from 1937to 1957.3 [notes.html#ch3_3a]Soap sculpting had its own rough moments. In the early years a prizewinner inNew York was disturbed when his girlfriend jilted him. He sneaked into her homewhile she was out and, to calm his nerves, carved up bar after bar of soap. Whenshe returned and refused to reconcile with him, he practiced his art ofsculpting on her and her mother. A reporter who visited the murder scene triedto link the killer to the contest, but contest officials denied any connectionand insisted the carvings were the work of young girls.4 [notes.html#ch3_4a]Mack Trucks approached Bernays in 1949 with an even more imposing challenge. Itcould handle competition from other truck makers but not from the railroads.Fearful of losing their grip on shipping, train operators had launched a fiercecampaign to convince the public that trucks were ruining the roads and topersuade states to levy road taxes high enough to price trucks out of thefreight business.The railroads, however, hadn’t counted on Big Think. “Our population wasgrowing,” Bernays recalled later. “So was the number of passenger and truckautomobiles. The static element was the highway system of the country. An ideahit me. Since no present solution was possible, maybe a future solution wouldassuage the frustrations of the public. If we could promise American motoristsfuture satisfaction on their roads and work to bring that about, the gripeagainst the heavy trucks would be dissipated and tomorrow the problem would besolved.” Promoting truck sales by building roads was, as the PR manacknowledged, “the most indirect kind of indirection,” and while it seemedlogical to him, it required all his skills of persuasion to get Mack to thinkthat far ahead and delay gratification that long. Even tougher was gettingCongress to commit the billions of dollars needed to construct a nationalhighway system.5 [notes.html#ch3_5a]But by now he’d worked out a recipe for solving problems like this, and asalways with this man who was so consumed by symbols, new recipes demanded newnames for the ingredients. His campaigns always began with an “overt act”—astunt staged so cleverly that the press would think it was newsworthy—in thiscase a luncheon in the Waldorf-Astoria’s grand ballroom at which the onlyspeaker was Mack president E. L. Bransome and the sole topic his plan for pavingthe countryside. The next step was “segmenting,” or identifying potential alliesso they could be targeted with appeals. Bransome and colleagues obliged bybarnstorming the nation, enlisting in their cause a curious collection of truckdrivers, milk dealers, tire and rubber workers, and members of women’s trafficclubs and men’s driving clubs. Then he organized the “front groups”—the TruckingInformation Service, the Trucking Service Bureau, and Better Living ThroughIncreased Highway Transportation—which mailed out promotional letters andfounded state associations to run local campaigns. Mack and Bernays broughtIsraeli ambassador Abba Eban onboard by agreeing to assemble trucks in Israel.They won over U.S. Army Chief of Staff William L. Barriger by convincing himthat trucks were essential for warfare in the dawning atomic age. In all of thistheir aim was to get the attention of the public and, through it, the U.S.Congress.It worked: Congress in 1950 approved $566 million in road-building funds foreach of the next two years, and two years later it upped the ante to $652million, the most it had ever authorized and a critical step toward completionof the interstate highway network. While several other forces were pushing forsuch a system, none was as determined as Mack and its allies. And while therailroads’ share of the shipping business already was slipping, this helpedcement the trend toward greater reliance on roads and less on rails.Bernays’s Mack campaign also set a model for lobbying that is still used intoday’s world of high-priced political action committees. He managed to unitedisparate elements of an industry, in this case trucking, to battle a commonenemy, the railroads. He realized that his greatest challenge was to rally thepublic to his cause, he knew the way to do that was to appeal to pocketbookissues, and he proved that in the face of such an onslaught, Congress could bepersuaded to spend billions of taxpayer dollars.Other clients required their own tailor-made approaches—some straightforwardstunts, some more sophisticated manipulations of symbols, but all bearing theBernays flair. For Cartier, the international jeweler, he inserted a plug in the1931 movie Fifty Million Frenchmen, getting Maurice Chevalier to croon, “You’vegot those ways, those fetching ways, that make me rush out to Cartier’s.” Thatwas sweet music to the Fifth Avenue jeweler and to what would become an entireindustry devoted to product placement. For Dodge’s 1928 Standard Six model hegot Charlie Chaplin to record a radio ad. Worried that Chaplin’s speaking rolemight give him stage fright, Bernays insured the actor’s voice for $5,000 withLloyd’s of London, generating even more coverage. And for Dixie Cups he foundeda Committee for the Study and Promotion of the Sanitary Dispensing of Food andDrink. One ad featuring a beautiful woman carried this caption: “Unwanted kissesare common enough in the lives of pretty girls. No wonder they avoid the rain ofkisses promiscuously placed on the rims of publicly used and re-used glasses.Have your drinks in Individual Dixies and be exclusive. Be more than exclusive.Be safe!. No lips ever touch a Dixie brim until it touches yours.”6[notes.html#ch3_6a]America’s brewers were more concerned about sanctimoniousness than safety.Prohibition was repealed in 1933, but it wasn’t long before thousands ofcommunities declared themselves dry, and the temperance movement picked upsteam. So in 1935 the brewers picked up Bernays.His strategy was familiar to every student of war, and of baseball: carefullyanalyze your opponent’s game plan, and if you can’t overcome it, co-opt it. Thatmeant promoting beer as “the beverage of moderation” in a way that woulddistance it from distilled liquors and inoculate it against the temperancemovement’s argument that all alcohol posed the danger of overindulgence. Hepersuaded beer retailers to cooperate with law enforcement to ensure that theirproduct was used responsibly, and he published “evidence” that beer was notfattening and had a caloric value equal to that of milk. He told homemakers thatbeer would make for a richer chocolate cake; told farmers that brewers weremajor buyers of their barley, corn, and rice; and told laborers that beer wasthe one alcoholic beverage they could afford. And he published booklets andwrote letters claiming that beer was the favorite drink of the ancientBabylonians and the monks of the Middle Ages as well as of George Washington,Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, and the Pilgrims.“Beer is a sort of vaccination against intemperance,” argued a typical Bernayscampaign brochure, this one urging people to vote for a Texas ordinancelegalizing the sale of beer. “The ‘bootleggers’ thrive upon the strongerbeverages, distilled spirits, those that carry the ‘kick’ in concentrated form,in small packages easy to conceal.… Where beer is accessible the liquor bottle‘on the hip’ is not so much in evidence, whether that be in the home or at apublic place, or—most important of all—in an automobile. Many sincere temperanceworkers believe that the best way to fight intemperance is to legalize the saleof beer everywhere.”7 [notes.html#ch3_7a]Such pearls of wisdom cost big dollars. In 1931 Bernays handled publicity forthe first aviators to cross the Pacific nonstop, a brief assignment that nettedhim $4,000—which was $1,000 more than the lead pilot earned. In the 1940s theColumbia Rope Company paid him $40,000 a year for advice on “a multiplicity ofproblems, most of which I found insoluble.” The Bank of America, meanwhile,solicited his advice on such matters as how to make reluctant regulators acceptbranch banking, advice they felt was worth $60,000 a year, which Bernays sayswas $10,000 more than the bank president’s salary.Fees like that quickly added up. Bernays’s ledgers show that in 1931, at theheight of the Great Depression, his income reached $98,513.55. Of that, profitswere $60,183.17—the equivalent of more than $700,000 in 1997 dollars. And hisearnings generally went up from there, with profits increasing as much asfivefold by 1935. In contemporary terms that means he was earning severalmillion dollars a year.His approach to money was simple, as he told an interviewer in 1985: “We decidedthat public relations advice is more important than legal advice, because legaladvice is based on precedent but public relations advice might actuallyestablish precedent. So we found out what lawyers charged, and we charged more.Up to then—1919, 1920—the most PR people received was $125 a week. Our firstfees were $12,000 annual retainers and rose sharply from that.”8[notes.html#ch3_8a]* * *Steep fees made it hard for any but the wealthiest to afford his counsel, butBernays reduced and sometimes waived his charges for clients like the AmericanLibrary Association, the Cardiac Committee of the Public Education Association,and the Mary Imogene Basset Hospital. He also served as chairman of the CitizensCommittee for Better Schools of New York City and vice chairman of the ConcertCommittee of the New York Stadium, and he was a member of the boards of theHospital for Joint Diseases of New York, the Metropolitan Educational TVAssociation, the New York Shakespeare Festival, and the Carnegie HallCorporation. Beginning in 1946, he says in his memoirs, he committed half of hisprofessional time to nonprofit work.Even when representing the rich, he was democratic in his sales pitches. Heconvinced blue-blooded Cartier’s to institute $5 and $10 departments during theDepression, and he eventually terminated his relationship with the longtimeclient because, he said, “I gave serious thought to the wisdom of handlingjewels during a depression and concluded that, in all conscience, I could notcontinue.”9 [notes.html#ch3_9a]At other times, he zeroed in on the elite of the elite, advising the SherryNetherland Hotel to send solicitations to America’s “1,000 wealthiest widows,”owners of Rolls Royces, seniors at Ivy League colleges, and a “wide mailing listchosen from the social registers or blue books of New York and other leadingcities.”Targeted mailings were one tactic he used on behalf of the Fifth Avenue hotel.This strategy is considered routine today, but it was pioneering in 1949. Toanalyze the hotel’s clientele he ordered up a Dun and Bradstreet ratings checkon one hundred guests who had paid with credit cards. And he commissioned afield study on how services at the Sherry Netherland stacked up against those atthe Plaza, the Ritz-Carlton, and other top-of-the-line hostelries in Manhattan,checking on everything from whether the bellman opened the windows and adjustedthe shades to whether a room had clean ashtrays, telegram blanks, a thermos, andrunning ice water.Bernays even did his own review of the elegant Carnaval Room, unmaskingdeficiencies everywhere he turned. The two hostesses wore dresses that “looked abit bedraggled, not freshly ironed. They didn’t give a spritely impact to theeye.” The principal headwaiter “was completely oblivious of us.” The kitchenpantry was visible from his table and was “not immaculate.… Doors of pantry nowpainted red might be painted in stripes like the rest of decor to maintainpattern.” As for the food, “my wife had a practically cold filet mignon and Ihad a warm—not hot—roast beef.” The music might have soothed his raw nerves, butit was “no more or less pleasant than the dinner music one hears over the radioor in any place of equal or even less merit.”10 [notes.html#ch3_10a]That and other data generally went onto index cards, tens of thousands of them,stored in file drawers and referred to again and again, anytime he or anassociate needed an address or phone number, a stored fact or tip to be followedup on—a sea of minutiae, swelled by a tide of simple tasks, that made up the bigpicture of Big Think. If one card didn’t offer the answer, if one tactic didn’tprovide results, he moved on without pause to the next card or strategy.An equally important maxim of Big Think was that extremism in defense of aclient wasn’t a vice and could be a virtue, even if it meant fighting dirty. In1933, for example, Bernays helped Allied Chemical battle a bid by stockholdersto make the company release data on its finances. One tactic was to suggest thatthe dissenting stockholders’ ties to Belgium raised a threat of “foreigndomination”—a strategy that should have been anathema to Bernays, who had beenoutraged when his Austrian roots were used to question his loyalty to Americaduring World War I.His methods often drew scathing criticism—Editor and Publisher branded him “theyoung Machiavelli of our time,” and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, ina letter to President Franklin Roosevelt, called Bernays and fellow PR pioneerIvy Lee “professional poisoners of the public mind” who exploit “foolishness andfanaticism and self-interest.”11 [notes.html#ch3_11a] But his hardball approachalso attracted clients. Executives of the Jackson Heights Corporation told himthey wanted his help with a new housing development, Bernays said, “becauseanyone who was a ‘menace’ of the proportions I was described by Editor andPublisher must be good.” And Printer’s Ink magazine, which like Editor andPublisher had skewered him over the years, later hired him as an adviser.* * *Light’s Golden Jubilee, the 1929 celebration of the fiftieth anniversary ofThomas A. Edison’s invention of the electric light, is widely regarded asBernays’s shining triumph and one of the brightest public relations performancesever. But close inspection casts his role in a dimmer light, raising doubtsabout the PR maestro and his profession.The jubilee came at a busy time for Bernays, who was urging women to reach forLuckies instead of sweets, pushing Cartier’s jewels, Dodge’s Victory Six car,Knox’s gelatin, and New Jersey Bell’s new phone services. Yet, as he wrotelater, “to many we were still sensation mongers and ballyhoo artists—a menace tothe integrity of press and business alike. I hoped for a dramatic event thatwould make others see us as we saw ourselves.”12 [notes.html#ch3_12a]The Golden Jubilee was that event. Bernays had a true hero in Edison, a trulysignificant invention in the incandescent light, and a nation that, in the headydays before the stock market crash, believed the boom would last forever and wasforever ready to celebrate. All that remained was to decide who would plan thebash—General Electric, which had been invited in by a collection of Edison’sfriends and colleagues called the Edison Pioneers, or Henry Ford, who idolizedEdison and volunteered to step in when the aging inventor said he was worriedthat GE would commercialize the celebration. Ford won out, getting the eventmoved from GE’s headquarters in Schenectady to Ford’s own backyard—Dearborn,Michigan—with GE invited along as a junior partner.General Electric, meanwhile, asked Bernays to handle its end of the publicity,and soon after he came onboard things started happening. Newspapers reprintedissues from fifty years before announcing Edison’s discovery. Letters of tributepoured in from luminaries like Albert Einstein and General John J. Pershing.George M. Cohan wrote a song called “Edison—Miracle Man,” and Admiral RichardByrd named a beacon in the Arctic after the inventor. Proclamations were issuedfrom New Hampshire to New Mexico and by leaders of countries as diverse as Chinaand Canada. And the post office issued a commemorative two-cent stamp printed inred, which depicted Edison’s lamp with rays emanating outward.The jubilee itself, on October 21, 1929, drew one of the most impressive lineupsever. The greats included President Herbert Hoover, Marie Curie, Orville Wright,Will Rogers, and J. P. Morgan. Bernays managed to land in the center of things,as he recalled later: “The president stood outside the [train] station, flankedby a crowd of guests, his aide, and his personal physician. Nobody seemed to bein charge, so I pushed into the crowd and yelled for the ‘gentlemen please tomove back, form a line, and meet the president in orderly fashion.’ I stoodopposite Mr. Hoover. As the line moved slowly between us, I asked the name ofeach approaching man and repeated it to the president.”13 [notes.html#ch3_13a]Activities reached a climax when Edison appeared on the second floor of hislaboratory, which Ford had moved from New Jersey to Michigan, and demonstrated,for millions of radio listeners worldwide, how he first lit a light. “Will itlight? Will it burn?” NBC Radio’s Graham McNamee asked, fanning theanticipation. “Or will it flicker and die, as so many previous lamps had died?Oh, you could hear a pin drop in this long room. Now the group is once moreabout the old vacuum pump. Mr. Edison has the two wires in his hand; now he isreaching up to the old lamp; now he is making the connection. It lights!”14[notes.html#ch3_14a]No matter that, as the celebration was dying down, Edison slumped in his chairand turned a deathly white. He was helped into a nearby room, laid on a sofa,and given medication, then taken to the Ford home and put to bed for severaldays. That did little to diminish the elation, as the jubilee was universallyjudged a triumph.In one account after another, credit was lavished on a certain public relationsman. “The high point in promotion work for 1929—which should certainly win aHarvard advertising prize—was the feat of persuading the post office to get outa special two-cent stamp advertising Mr. Edison’s electric light,” wrote TheNation. “But a close runner-up has been the publicity given, free of charge, tothe advertising stunt of bringing bright boys from forty-eight states to Mr.Edison’s New Jersey laboratory. Every day for a week these lads—aided by theforethought of the publicity man in arranging for the simultaneous presence ofMessrs. Edison, Eastman, Ford, and Lindbergh—made the front pages. Every day thethought was subtly instilled into impressionable young minds that theelectric-light companies yearned to help bright boys and to achieve moreinventions, all for the benefit of the dear old Ultimate Consumer.… Credit forthis super-advertising, we understand, belongs to Mr. Edward L. Bernays,‘counsel on public relations.’ If Mr. Ivy Lee is to maintain his reputation, hewill have to do some tall thinking.”15 [notes.html#ch3_15a]The New Yorker agreed: “Bernays works well with multimillionaires, as thesuccess of the great celebration shows. Under Ford’s aegis he got into touchwith governors, other countries, syndicates, etc. Under his direction committeeswere formed from Maine to Honolulu, holidays declared, lights turned on and off,speeches made, and a special stamp issued by the Post Office Department. Ofcourse, the real greatness of Edison deserved all these things, and the peoplefrom the President down were sincerely desirous of honoring him in a big way,but it took a public-relations counsellor [sic] to put it over.”16[notes.html#ch3_16a]The Atlantic Monthly, meanwhile, said that “Henry Ford was supposed to be themanager of the show, but the man who set the stage and pulled the stringsattached to all the dignified marionettes was Edward L. Bernays.”17[notes.html#ch3_17a] And Yale University psychologist Leonard Doob called whatBernays did in Dearborn “one of the most astonishing pieces of propaganda everengineered in this country during peace time.”18 [notes.html#ch3_18a]Edison himself wrote Bernays to offer his “sincere thanks and appreciation” forthe “immense amount of thought and work [that] was expended.” The note’s tone,however, suggests that it was a form letter.19 [notes.html#ch3_19a]In the best tradition of his young profession, Bernays didn’t merely bask in thepublicity, he used it to his own advantage. “Will any of your clients celebrateimportant anniversaries in 1930?” asked a circular distributed by the Bernaysoffice. “The remarkable tide of goodwill created by the Light’s Golden Jubileecelebration of the 50th anniversary of the incandescent lamp proves thatoccasions of this kind can be made to capitalize on the past and to focus publicattention on the present and the future. If our experience in handling thepublic relations aspects in the Light’s Golden Jubilee and other clientsinterests you, we should be glad to discuss with you the anniversarypossibilities of your clients.”20 [notes.html#ch3_20a]Yet some historians view the jubilee as a tribute not to Bernays’s brilliancebut to his propensity for puffery, especially where his own role in history isconcerned—and to a penchant for secrecy that was tantamount to duplicity.In a 1976 book historian David L. Lewis writes, “In later years many writers, indiscussing the jubilee (which has become a ‘public relations classic’), havegreatly magnified Bernays’s role.… Actually Bernays only helped to handle thepress, and, in fact, he would have had nothing to do with the Dearborncelebration had not Ford, who had obtained Edison’s promise to attend thededication of the village on October 21, permitted General Electric to tie inthe jubilee with the Ford ceremony. It was Ford’s show, and it was he who issuedthe invitations to the prominent guests. As for the reconstruction of the Edisonbuildings, that project was begun before anyone in Dearborn had ever heard ofBernays.”21 [notes.html#ch3_21a]Ten years later Lewis, a professor of business history at the University ofMichigan, read an interview in the Detroit Free Press where Bernays boastedabout his role in the jubilee, calling it his “greatest triumph.” Having gottena decidedly different version from those close to Ford, Lewis started to write arebuttal titled “Bernays Bragging Again” but decided against it, as he explains,because Bernays “was an old fellow and I didn’t want to hurt his feelings.”22[notes.html#ch3_22a]Bernays’s name is only rarely associated with the jubilee in official historiesat the Henry Ford Museum or in Edison’s papers. And even before the eventoccurred in 1929, Editor and Publisher caught him doing a bit of exaggerating,implying he was handling press not only for the jubilee but also for PresidentHoover—a suggestion that was greeted by surprise at the White House andbackpedaling by Bernays, who publicly expressed hope that he had not“embarrassed Mr. Hoover.”23 [notes.html#ch3_23a]Did he deserve the credit others lavished on him and that he had heaped uponhimself? Yes and no. Five boxes of Library of Congress papers on the celebrationmake clear that he was more than merely a press agent, that he helped dream uppromotions which made the event an international extravaganza, and that he wasinvolved in the sort of detailed orchestration that Ford’s staff probably didn’twant to be troubled with. The fact that Ford confidants remembered thingsdifferently isn’t surprising. They and their boss resented from the start theinvolvement of GE and its hyperactive publicity man. Also, they may not havebeen aware of all that Bernays did behind the scenes or why it mattered, next tothe $3 million Ford spent and the yeomanlike work his architects and buildersdid. And Ford’s well-documented anti-Semitism likely soured his and his staff’sperception of Bernays.Bernays’s papers and his many recollections of the jubilee over the years makeclear, however, that he did embellish his role, which becomes a bit more vitalto the celebrations with each retelling. By 1977 the journal Dun’s Review wascrediting him with having orchestrated the relocation to Dearborn of the NewJersey building where Edison invented the lightbulb. As Lewis suggests, as moreand more principals who might have contradicted him passed away, Bernays’sversion became the official version.Bernays also upset his PR colleagues and others by perpetually taking centerstage during the jubilee. He “incurred Ford’s wrath after the dedicatory partyarrived in Dearborn because he tried repeatedly to inject himself into a grouppicture with Hoover, Edison, and the host,” Lewis wrote. “Ford took[newspaperman and Ford adviser] Fred Black aside and told him to ‘get Bernaysthe hell out of here or I’ll have [Ford bodyguard] Harry Bennett’s men throw himover the fence.’ Black told Bernays of Ford’s threat, and the publicist movedout of camera range.”24 [notes.html#ch3_24a] Scott M. Cutlip, a prominent PRhistorian, said such behavior “was characteristic of Bernays. He always confusedwho the client was. It’s a basic principle of PR that the public relations manstays in the background.”25 [notes.html#ch3_25a]But it was Bernays’s secrecy that elicited the loudest outcry. As Editor andPublisher noted shortly before the celebration, “it is known that Bernays hasbeen at work upon the Jubilee since last spring.… Just who his employers are isnot known.”26 [notes.html#ch3_26a] Five days after the bash the journal stillwas in the dark: “No one knew who was employing him, but Bernays freely admittedhe was being paid. He told one newspaper man that he was acting for the ‘EdisonPioneers.’ His copy frequently mentioned the electric light and power industry.He may have been employed by Ford interests, or General Electric, orWestinghouse or Edison Lamp or all of them cooperatively.”27[notes.html#ch3_27a]Bernays made a conscious effort to get people to believe the celebration wasunfolding spontaneously rather than being stage-managed by GE or anyone else. Hewrote early in 1929 to a GE sales promotion executive, “Did you see the enclosed[article] in the Times of this morning?… The slant in this article, from thestandpoint of propaganda, is all wrong to our mind. It gives the emphasis to thetechnique of how interest will be brought about rather than to create theimpression that this will be an event that has developed naturally.”28[notes.html#ch3_28a]His defense then, as always, was the age-old principle of clientconfidentiality. “We would no more violate our confidence,” he said, “than woulda doctor or a lawyer.” But while doctors and lawyers don’t identify clients,they also don’t seek to mislead the way the GE team did. And Bernays’s argumentis disingenuous since, as far back as 1930, he was naming clients for reporterswriting sympathetic stories.* * *Questions raised about Light’s Golden Jubilee also can be asked about otherBernays campaigns and other claims he made over the years.Did his ingenious soap sculpture initiative, for instance, really revolutionizethe way Procter and Gamble sold Ivory? No, says Oliver Gale, the longtime P&Gpublic relations boss: “I don’t think Eddie Bernays had any idea how we soldsoap. The real world of selling soap was not of interest to him.… His ideas wereconceptual and creative and magical, but they had very little effect on ourbusiness. That’s where I think he came up short.” Robert G. Eagen, a later P&Gpublic relations chief, agrees. The soap sculpture project, he explains, was “aworthwhile thing, sort of a low-cost project. Did it help us sell soap? I doubtit. We had much more efficient ways of selling soap.”29 [notes.html#ch3_29a]Official histories of the sculpture contest make clear that Bernays’s claim that21 million children took part the first year can’t be substantiated and probablyis a gross exaggeration.It could be that other PR executives at Procter and Gamble didn’t recognize thelong-term consequences of what Bernays was doing, that they were concerned withday-to-day sales while he cared about Ivory’s long-term reputation withconsumers. The full-time PR men also might have resented the intrusion of apart-time consultant, especially one who started at $12,000 a year in 1923 andalmost certainly got raises over the next three decades. And it’s possible thatthe bolder claims in the stream of profiles on him were pumped up by reporterswho knew it made a stronger story to credit him with everything fromorchestrating a presidential visit to relocating an inventor’s lab, and bycolumnists like Walter Winchell who Bernays says started the rumor that he,rather than the post office, was behind the Edison stamp.What about the brash claims in his autobiography and in scores of articles hewrote which maintained, among other things, that his work for Dodge wasresponsible for “keeping the auto industry rolling,” that his work for GeneralMotors helped convince that company and corporate America at large of theprimacy of PR, that his efforts in Massachusetts “pretty single-handedly” got alaw passed making it illegal to fire workers based on age, that he got FranklinRoosevelt to name Henry Wallace secretary of agriculture, and that he was theman behind the “mental hygiene” movement reinventing itself as “mental health”?Many of these claims are difficult to confirm or deny. The companies involvedsay they don’t have the records, and Bernays’s files don’t make clear whetherhis machinations were effective. Most of his co-workers are dead or don’tremember. Press accounts often simply repeat his version of what happened, whichis to be expected when you outlive your contemporaries, are more skilled atgetting across your viewpoint, and write an 849-page autobiography that, whiletoo cumbersome for most readers to plow through, has been used repeatedly byhistorians writing about such varied topics as cigarette sales and theU.S.-backed defeat of Guatemala’s socialist regime.But some of his claims clearly come up short. That happened with the Green Balland the Committee on Public Information. It happens again with hisoften-repeated assertion that he was the one who got United Parcel Service topaint its trucks brown to blend in with residential neighborhoods. UPS officialscan’t find any record of his involvement and say brown was chosen simply tomatch the popular Pullman railroad cars. Mental health historians agree thatBernays may well have suggested the switch from mental hygiene, but so did manyothers. No one remembers his participation when the national associationsactually changed their titles in the mid-1940s. He did battle age discriminationin Massachusetts, but the law he claimed credit for was approved more thantwenty years before he moved to the Bay State.Even stranger circumstances surround Bernays’s insistence, in his memoirs and instories over the years, that Time magazine founder Henry Luce wanted to cut himin at the beginning as an investor and PR adviser. “I declined their offer of$125 a week for public relations counsel because I thought their evaluation ofthe market was incorrect and I didn’t want to take their money for a project Ifelt would not succeed,” Bernays wrote forty-two years later. “Besides, our feeswere higher than they could afford to pay.”30 [notes.html#ch3_30a]His Library of Congress papers tell a decidedly different story, however. OnApril 9,1923, Bernays sent Luce a four-page letter expressing his convictionthat “the appeal of Time is potentially an appeal to the entire Americanpublic,” outlining his ideas for promoting the magazine, and offering to do thatpromotional work for $100 a week. Luce wrote back on April 27, “We are not yetready to undertake any considerable obligations for public counsel relations,”but he left the door open for the future. Bernays answered on April 30, saying,“I should be happy at any time to co-operate with you because I really believein the future of your magazine.”31 [notes.html#ch3_31a] He ultimately did helpout with press releases on the opening of the magazine, “as a beau geste,” andyears later he did PR work for Time.It’s unclear why he amended the story for his memoirs, especially since theactual account was available in his personal papers, which were due to be madepublic upon his death. Perhaps he enjoyed the opportunity for self-deprecationby pointing out how wrong he’d been in misjudging Time’s potential, although hisletters make clear he was right in predicting its rosy future. Perhaps, lookingback more than four decades later, he couldn’t find the right papers to jog hismemory and simply got it wrong. Most likely he was embarrassed that Lucedeclined his offer of help and decided to leave that detail out of his memoirs.And his contention that he carried clout at General Motors? Paul Garrett, GM’slongtime PR guru, says he was the one who pushed GM to hire Bernays, but onlybecause his boss insisted that the company get all the advice it could duringthe depression. Garrett had faith that Bernays would quickly wear out hiswelcome, and he wasn’t disappointed, as he made clear in a 1963 letter to agraduate student chronicling his career. “You can do what you want aboutBernays,” Garrett wrote. “To me the kindest thing all around would be not tomention him at all … Eddy [sic] had no ‘impact’ on me in the development of mypublic relations philosophy for General Motors. If I were to compile a list oftwenty-five men inside and outside General Motors who had an impact on mydevelopment during the early General Motors years, it would not even occur to meto put Eddy on that list.… This whole Bernays thing has assumed a dimension thatis ridiculous as I think it would be clear from the fact that we dismissed himat the end of his first year. But I would very much prefer professionally not todo anything on my part to hurt him, who is after all a much older man in theprofession than I.”32 [notes.html#ch3_32a]That wasn’t the first time Bernays was fired, or the last. His short tenure withclient after client suggests he didn’t always make the impact he claimed, andeven a thirty-year relationship like the one he had with Procter and Gambleended with his dismissal. “I had the unhappy task of telling him,” Galerecalled. “His whole approach was indirect, and that just kind of fell by thewayside as far as we were concerned. It no longer was pertinent.”33[notes.html#ch3_33a]Bernays admitted that his clients often let him go sooner than he’d have liked,but he had an explanation for every firing, usually involving personalitiesrather than performance. With General Motors, he told a different story thanGarrett, attributing the company’s refusal to extend his one-year contract to anarticle in a Detroit newspaper that credited him, rather than two GM vicepresidents, with delivering a GM loan to two failing Detroit banks during thedepression. “That line of type in the Detroit Free Press about Bernays, the$12,500,000 personal representative of Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., who had savedDetroit from economic collapse, had a greater force in the situation than anyother thing I had done or might do,” Bernays wrote in his memoirs. “The line hadrankled in the minds and hearts of the two vice presidents, who were deeplyfrustrated by missing their great opportunity for glory. When the terminationdate arrived, the contract was not renewed.” As for Garrett, Bernays said he was“as green about public relations as I was about motor mechanics,” adding thatGarrett and the other GM publicity men “were to make decisions on the publicrelations program I was presenting to them, but none had the requisite knowledgeor experience on which to base such decisions.”34 [notes.html#ch3_34a]Similarly, he said that Procter and Gamble dismissed him because he insisted onkeeping his PR organization small even though P&G wanted a big firm able tohandle everything from writing and printing to mailing, polling, andpress-agentry. “I had decided long ago,” he wrote, “that I wanted to be anindependent adviser, not head of a public relations factory, where my time wouldbe spent as an executive. I preferred problem solving to drill majoring.”35[notes.html#ch3_35a]“People ask me why clients discontinued our services,” he wrote on anotheroccasion. “There are almost as many causes as there were clients. A change ofpolicy with no ascertainable reason for it was one case.… Sometimes a client’sunrealizable expectations are not met. Sometimes his realizable hopes have notbeen met, due to no circumstances the public relations counsel can possiblycontrol. Sometimes the relationship is severed because the counsel on publicrelations has been so successful that the client feels he can proceed on hisown. Sometimes a man in the organization, after a year’s experience with counselon public relations, convinces the client he doesn’t need outside help, hopingto profit thereby.”36 [notes.html#ch3_36a]Never, judging from his writings, was he fired for anything that was his fault.Yet if his short tenures reflect his shortcomings, the fact that he continuallylanded new, bigger clients attests to his reputation for producing results, tohis resiliency, which let him bounce back from falls that would have kept downless resourceful men, and most of all to his ability to persuade prospectiveclients that his troubles with earlier clients weren’t his fault. And if some ofhis claims clearly were exaggerated, others were quite accurate and often evenunderstated. Consider his taking credit for shortening multiple sclerosis to itsfamiliar initials, MS. Sylvia Lawry, founder and director of the NationalMultiple Sclerosis Society, recalls that “when we were first organized there wasa lot of conjecture about whether we should change our name to one that couldmore easily be dealt with by the public. Bernays said we shouldn’t change thename but should use the initials MS. He was the first to suggest that. Wheneverother problems came up over the years,” she added, “I’d ask myself, How wouldEddie Bernays have reacted? Usually I knew the answer, and I’d follow theadvice.”37 [notes.html#ch3_37a]The American Heart Association tells a similar story about his claim that hehelped take the group “from its unimportance and made it a large, effectiveorganization.” It was the $1.5 million that the association got from Procter andGamble’s radio show Truth or Consequences that let the organization go national,officials say, and Bernays apparently was the one who picked the association outof all the charities seeking such support. What about his insistence that hehelped shape the Columbia Broadcasting System and, through it, the wider worldsof radio and TV? Sally Bedell Smith, biographer of longtime CBS boss William S.Paley, tells a similar story, saying “Bernays gave Paley advice not only aboutpublicity but about organizational structure, sales techniques, and scoutingtalent.” And she credits the PR man with scripting Paley’s promise to Congressthat the networks would aggressively promote public affairs and newsprogramming. The fact that he wrote that bold pledge, Smith adds, means thatBernays shares with Paley the blame for CBS’s failure to deliver on itshigh-minded proposal.38 [notes.html#ch3_38a]Bernays’s stories almost always began with a factual account, then were puffedup as he recounted his own role or insisted that whatever happened was a “firstof its kind.” As his granddaughter Hester Kaplan says, “I never doubted hisstories; I just doubted their magnitude.”39 [notes.html#ch3_39a]It was tough to get mad at Bernays, though, because he was such a goodstoryteller and brought such energy to each tale, especially in his later years.And it was tough to separate fact from fiction because, like Woody Allen’scharacter Leonard Zelig, Bernays was present at so many key moments in historyand, unlike Zelig, he often did markedly influence the outcome.So why did he embellish?Doris Held, Eddie’s older daughter who is a psychotherapist, looks to herprofession for insight. Having grown up in the shadow of Freud, hisoverachieving uncle, and Ely Bernays, his domineering father, Eddieovercompensated by making his big achievements even bigger, she says. “Hecouldn’t let it be, he had to keep on constructing it and defining it andembellishing it.”40 [notes.html#ch3_40a]People who live as long as he did often magnify their accomplishments,remembering vividly their triumphs and barely recalling their failures. “Hereminds me of the war veteran whose exploits grow in stature with the passage ofyears and the deaths of his comrades,” writes David Lewis, the University ofMichigan historian. “He was a public relations pioneer and had a great career.Why not leave it at that instead of making exaggerated claims?”41[notes.html#ch3_41a]Leaving it at that, however, would have denied who Eddie truly was—theconsummate PR man—and what he did for his clients, which was meticulouslymassage the facts, then filter them through letters, speeches, and front groupsuntil even he could not say for sure what was truth and what spin. This, afterall, was the man who got kids to carve bars of soap into works of art andpersuaded their parents to serve bacon and eggs for breakfast. Ballyhooing likethat for a living and believing in it so ardently, he found it tough to turn offthe rhetoric even when he was telling his own story.The irony, as Lewis notes, is that Eddie’s actual accomplishments were somomentous that he didn’t need to bend the truth. And embellishing the way he didwith Light’s Golden Jubilee raised unfair doubts about whether he deservedcredit for all the precedent-setting campaigns he really had carried out.Eddie knew about the whispering; he knew colleagues and historians bought mostof what he was selling but doubted some of his stories. He resolutely deniedthat he exaggerated, and when questioned, even into his late nineties, he wouldjump up from his desk and begin pulling papers from his files, eager to provehe’d done precisely what he said. But he also conceded in his autobiography, andagain and again in conversations, that “in an era of mass communication, modestyis a private virtue and a public fault.”"},{"pageContent":"4Setting the SPINBig think worked so well in selling everything from beer to ballet dancers thatpoliticians couldn’t resist seeing whether it could sell them, too. And EddieBernays, America’s number one salesman, was anxious to oblige.The first to call on him were supporters of President Calvin Coolidge who, in1924, were trying to elect their man to his first full term. Vice PresidentCoolidge had moved into the White House and dropped the “vice” from his titlewhen President Warren G. Harding died a year earlier. But his new prominence didnothing to sweeten a personality so sour that Alice Roosevelt Longworth, TeddyRoosevelt’s daughter, surmised that Coolidge was “weaned on a pickle.”The public was equally wary of the new president, which was worrisome toRhinelander Waldo, the ex-police commissioner of New York City. Even thoughWaldo was a Democrat, he admired Coolidge, who was a Republican. More to thepoint, Waldo, a lanky Connecticut Yankee, realized that if he helped electCoolidge, Coolidge might help him become governor of New York. Or maybe governorof the Philippines. To promote the president’s cause and his own, Waldo createdthe Coolidge Non-Partisan League, but he realized he’d need the help of aspecialist like Bernays to sell voters on the league and on the dour president.Today it’s standard procedure for Democrats to show off the Republicans who haverallied to their candidacy, and vice versa, but back then it was more of anoddity and, as Bernays understood, more likely to draw press attention. So, ashe’d done for front groups he set up for corporate clients, Bernays set out tospread the word on the Non-Partisan League. He had a poster delivered to athousand newspapers that told the league’s story; to ensure that everyone gotthe point about nonpartisanship, it featured a picture of Waldo sandwichedbetween an elephant and a donkey.Bernays also searched for prominent Democrats who would back Coolidge. He foundseveral who were willing to say nice things about the president’s positions onissues ranging from welfare to low-cost transportation to protectivetariffs—mainly because, like Waldo, they had an interest they hoped could beadvanced by extending the White House stay of the Republican president. Everynewspaper story mentioned Waldo’s name along with Coolidge’s.The campaign was going fine, but Bernays and Waldo worried that too few voterswere being swayed by such partisan appeals, even when couched innonpartisanship. And they knew such serious-minded stories only reinforced thepresident’s serious-minded image. Something else was needed, a masterstroke likethe one Bernays had struck with Caruso and the Ballet Russe, which would, atleast for a moment, transform the president from a cold introvert into thehomespun figure people wanted in the White House. The PR man contemplatedbringing to Washington a collection of female novelists or a special delegationof mothers.Even better, he decided, would be leading figures from the stage, people liketroubadour Al Jolson and fellow entertainers John Drew, Raymond Hitchcock, andthe Dolly Sisters, whose every performance rang out with humanity and energy.One night, after the curtains fell on Broadway, a troupe of forty performersboarded the midnight train to the nation’s capital. A caravan of Cadillacs metthem at Union Station and shuttled them to the White House, where Mr. and Mrs.Coolidge were waiting at the entrance. One by one the stars and starlets shookhands with the president, with Bernays acting as intermediary and the presidentmaintaining his trademark deadpan expression. Then they all adjourned to thestate dining room for coffee, fruit, toast, griddle cakes, and sausages.After breakfast the president led his guests onto the White House lawn, whereJolson serenaded him with a song entitled “Keep Coolidge.” “The race is nowbegun, and Coolidge is the one, the one to fill the presidential chair. Withouta lot of fuss he did a lot for us, so let’s reciprocate and keep him there,” hesang. Mrs. Coolidge and the rest of the Broadway delegation joined in therefrain: “Keep Coolidge! Keep Coolidge! And have no fears for four more years!”The newspapers loved it. The New York Times headlined its story, “Actors EatCakes with the Coolidges … President Nearly Laughs.”1 [notes.html#ch4_1a] TheNew York Review went a step further, topping its story with the headline “JolsonMakes President Laugh for the First Time in Public.”2 [notes.html#ch4_2a] Andthe New York World wrote, “It took a group of New York actors three minutes toaccomplish with Calvin Coolidge what society leaders of Washington had attemptedand failed, what traditionally was impossible, at least in public, and what eventhe Senate during his two years and a half as presiding officer could not makehim do. They forced him to show his teeth, open his mouth and laugh.”3[notes.html#ch4_3a]Years afterward, Bernays reflected on what he’d done: “To the country at largethe headlines and the stories reflected surprise and undoubtedly changed thereputation of Coolidge as intended.”4 [notes.html#ch4_4a] Whether or not he hadsingle-handedly transformed Coolidge’s image, he did give the press and thenation an event so surprising and irresistible that it touched a nerve. Threeweeks later Coolidge won a landslide victory. And, of perhaps greatersignificance, Bernays proved that the skills he had used to craft publicattitudes toward cigarettes and cigars could be employed to reshape the image ofelected officials.That lesson wasn’t lost on another president seeking reelection eight yearslater. Herbert Hoover summoned Bernays to the White House a month before the1932 election, eager to hear his ideas on how to overcome the seemingly endlessdepression and, even more pressing, what to do about his formidable Democraticopponent, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. A strategy paper in Bernays’s files laysout his last-minute plan.5 [notes.html#ch4_5a] First he would enlist his cadreof “disinterested experts” from business, labor, and academia. Only this time hewas out to win over the entire nation, which meant signing up as many as 25,000“group leaders” to his Non-partisan Fact-Finding Committee for Hoover. Theywould get out the word that the economy was about to turn around. And they wouldhelp “puncture the inferior personality” of Roosevelt by convincing voters thatthe Democratic candidate was “not the progressive” people thought he was andthat he “has been subject to Tammany and political jobbery.”Dividing the opposition was key to conquering it, Bernays believed. In this casethat meant persuading the 15 million Americans who had voted four years beforefor Democrat Alfred E. Smith to switch to Hoover, write in Smith’s name, orsimply stay home on election day. One publicity campaign would spotlight leadingDemocrats who thought it had been a mistake to nominate Roosevelt instead ofSmith. Another would show Hoover to be a courageous, humane leader who’d broughtthe nation peace if not prosperity. And, in the biggest reach of all in a nationwhere 12 million people were unemployed, Bernays’s experts would make the casethat Hoover’s plan for deliberate recovery was more prudent than Roosevelt’spromise of a quick end to the Great Depression.Bernays also made clear, as he had in his corporate campaigns, that the best wayto win over the public was by appealing to instinct rather than reason. “Alwayskeep in mind the tendency of human beings to symbolize their leaders asAchilles’ heel proof,” his strategy paper advised. “Also that the inferioritycomplex of individuals will respond to feeling superior to a fool.… Createissues that appeal to pugnacious instincts of human beings.”Even the savviest campaign couldn’t paper over the bleak economic picture,however: Hoover captured just 59 electoral votes to Roosevelt’s 472.* * *Building on his early experiences to benefit later clients—and himself—hadbecome a maxim for Bernays. He was perpetually sifting out and writing down newways of doing everything from filing contacts to marketing clients, in theprocess offering direction to his young staff and transforming his novel fieldof press-agentry into the profession of public relations. The same rules thathad let him sell Caruso to an American public wary of Europeans, and of opera,helped him peddle cigarettes to an entire generation of American women.So it was in politics. What began with Coolidge and Hoover as ad hoc responseshad become, by 1940, sophisticated campaign strategies. That new scientificapproach was on full display in the work Bernays did that year for WilliamO’Dwyer, who was trying to unseat two-term New York mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia.“I can only give advice if I first know what people’s attitudes are,” Bernaystold O’Dwyer, who had approached the PR man just two months before theelection.6 [notes.html#ch4_6a] Bernays’s caution appears eminently reasonabletoday, when survey researchers and spin doctors are even firmer fixtures incampaigns than poll watchers and leafleteers. Back then the notion of measuringpublic sentiment seemed quixotic, but Bernays set out to prove otherwise. Hescattered members of his staff across the five boroughs to interview a thousandvoters, then began analyzing previous citywide election results and gatheringall available data on New Yorkers’ educational, economic, and politicalaffiliations. He even undertook a “psychological survey” of voters of variousreligious and ethnic backgrounds “to discover the emotional or logical basis forattitude and action in the campaign.”The result was forty-six pages of recommendations that may have been the firstvoter portrait of its kind, and was almost certainly the most sophisticated.7[notes.html#ch4_7a] The public relations adviser broke voters down by religion,ethnicity, issues, and ideology, and suggested detailed appeals for each group.O’Dwyer should approach fellow Irish Catholics, Bernays said, by pointing outthat when he was the district attorney in Brooklyn he’d helped break up a bandof mob hit men known as Murder, Incorporated, and by highlighting his DemocraticParty credentials. When he made his pitch to Italians, however, he should playup the need to reform the police department, stress his political independence,and show that the man he was trying to unseat, La Guardia, had failed to appointfellow Italians to city jobs. With union members the theme should be his “prolabor and pro union attitude,” while with big business it should be his“fairness in labor disputes, fair hearing of employers’ side.”Those messages would be carried by conventional media like newspapers and radio,but also by new ones like motion pictures and newsreels, with their ability topresent symbols as well as substance. A Non-Partisan Committee for O’Dwyer wouldkeep the candidate at arm’s length from the tainted political machinery ofTammany Hall and the Democratic Party. And, much as fifty years later BillClinton’s presidential campaign would insist on one overriding campaignmessage—”it’s the economy, stupid”—so Bernays told the O’Dwyer campaign that“every event, every speech, every release, every action, should fit into thebroad pattern of the six points” he’d spelled out in an earlier manifesto.Bernays also grasped the importance of language in political discourse, and heknew how much more appealing an active candidate was than a passive one. So hemade a list of verbs that should guide the campaign’s actions: express(confidence), assail, deny, predict, hail, ask, promise, appeal, urge, hope,advocate, see, say, tell, declare, deplore, request, remark, reveal, propose,condemn, exhort, praise, forecast, demand, thank.One group and one message mattered more than all the others, however: Jews andthe insecurity they were feeling at that time in New York and around the world.Jews were important, Bernays said, because they made up one-third of the city’spopulation and were the biggest block of swing voters, and because his surveyshad revealed that an overwhelming 84 percent of them favored La Guardia, whosemother was Jewish. To win, O’Dwyer had to win over those Jews. And the key todoing that, Bernays wrote, was to convince Jewish voters “that the candidate isnot anti-Semitic.”His plan for doing that could be a casebook in ethnic politics, one that wouldbe as relevant today as it was back then. O’Dwyer not only had to endorseanti-Nazi and anti-Fascist groups, he had to be there at their meetings, delivera memorable address, and have his picture taken. He had to align himselfsquarely with President Roosevelt and his efforts in behalf of the Allies,appear before the Jewish War Veterans, and, of course, have his picture takenwith both. He had to speak out forcefully in favor of civil rights and civilliberties. And he had to take on anti-Semitic groups like the Christian Front,although to ensure that wouldn’t alienate Catholic supporters Bernays advisedthat “the attack should be carried out by utilizing names of individuals withthe same national or other background as the group being attacked.”O’Dwyer lost the election, although by the narrowest margin in a mayoral racesince 1905. Four years later he ran again and won.The same year he worked for O’Dwyer Bernays compiled an analysis of the New YorkState electorate for Democratic Lieutenant Governor Charles Poletti, who wasconsidering a run for governor.8 [notes.html#ch4_8a] The news this time, basedon interviews with political, labor, civic, and other leaders, wasn’tencouraging. Poletti’s Italian nationality worked against him, Bernays reported.So did his record of interventionism. His “change of religion costs him theCatholic vote without winning him the Protestant vote,” and he was unpopularwith farmers, businessmen, and political organizations. “He lacks color,”Bernays wrote, and “he lacks strength.” Former governor Al Smith didn’t likePoletti, nor did the Democratic establishment. And “he is irritating to many ofhis political associates.” There were favorable findings, too, but they took upjust ten lines as compared to the twenty-seven unfavorable ones.Poletti apparently took the analysis to heart and chose to run for reelection aslieutenant governor. And while others might have bridled at Bernays’s bluntanalysis of his unpopularity, Poletti remained grateful. “Now it [publicrelations] has become a profession but in those days it wasn’t as well organizedas it is now,” Poletti recalled in a 1978 interview. Bernays, he added, “was avery intelligent fellow in the field of public relations. He had a good rosterof clients; and he took a liking to me, and he studied my career, and I remember[he] prepared several analyses of it with suggestions as to what I might do ornot do to improve what is now called the image, the political image. And henever charged me anything for it; he just did it as a friend.”9[notes.html#ch4_9a]* * *Bernays offered comparable counsel to an assortment of other prominent politicalfigures, from First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to President Dwight D. Eisenhower.Sometimes, as with Eisenhower, he lobbied for programs he respected, like theU.S. Information Agency; with Eleanor Roosevelt, he primarily promoted hermemoirs. And he briefly advised Al Smith when Smith was governor of New York andcontemplating the run he later made for president. Smith was a “natural-born”leader, Bernays said, the kind who “understand intuitively what other peoplelearned the hard way through books.”10 [notes.html#ch4_10a]The U.S. government called on Bernays repeatedly. After World War I he workedfor the War Department, mapping out a national campaign to find jobs forveterans and concocting slogans like “He’s not a dead one, so after you’ve puthis name on the honor roll don’t forget to put it on the payroll, too,” and “Ajob inside is worth a hundred Welcome Home signs in the window.” Just beforeWorld War II he went back to work for Uncle Sam, advising a presidentialauthority that had been set up to battle the depression. “They were going tocall it the Committee for Unemployment,” Bernays recalled later. “I suggested tothem that they change that over to ‘the President’s’—the president being agodhead symbol—to ‘Emergency,’ which made it an impermanent committee to takecare of the emergency, and ‘for Employment,’ which set affirmative goals insteadof negative ones.”11 [notes.html#ch4_11a] So the group became the President’sEmergency Committee for Employment.Bernays advised the U.S. Information Agency on how to do a better job ofdisseminating U.S. propaganda, told the army and navy how to handle publicrelations during World War II, and was called in to counsel the Departments ofState and the Interior. In 1925 Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover named himassociate commissioner of commerce to the Paris Exposition of Decorative Arts,and in the 1940s he was named chairman of the National Advisory Committee of theThird U.S. War Loan, cochairman of the Victory Book campaign, and a member ofthe New York State Defense Council.Sometimes his work for the government let him in on state secrets, although, ashis wedding antics had shown, he had a tough time keeping a secret. Inunpublished notes for his autobiography he recounted how Leslie Richard Groves,the all-powerful U.S. Army general who oversaw production of the first atomicbomb, left the army in 1949 and “took with him a lot of secret papers of theproject he had no right to take. Those papers covered the dossiers andbackground of many atomic scientists. Some went back to their earliestchildhood. In order to keep the project in the hands of the army, Groves tookwhatever information was derogatory, or could be distorted to be derogatory tothe civilian control of atomic power, and turned it over to the [U.S. House]Un-American [Activities] Committee. The committee has studied it carefully andwill use it to smear the idea of civilian control of atomic energy.”12[notes.html#ch4_12a]Other times the information he picked up wasn’t secret, but it did offer aninside look at his era’s most powerful political figures. And Bernays’s commentson these people, as on so much else in his world, were delivered with acrispness and a cutting edge he knew would be irresistible to journalists andhistorians.He got to know Henry A. Wallace before Franklin D. Roosevelt named him secretaryof agriculture, and Bernays claims credit for helping smooth the way for thatappointment. Much later, after Wallace had served as vice president, Bernayshandled publicity for his appointment as editor of the New Republic. Wallace,Bernays said, was “a man whose mind was full of dreams, daydreams, aspirationsand hopes, with a fuzziness or muzziness about delineating them in terms of Act1, step 1, step 2, Act 2.”13 [notes.html#ch4_13a]Years later he offered an equally ambivalent appraisal of another former vicepresident, Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, who was the Democratic presidentialnominee in 1968: “If Hubert Humphrey had been able to delimit his activity, hemight have been a good president. But he spread himself so thin and had what weused to call verbal diarrhea, that would practically set him off at the drop ofan agate line to just go on [and] ad lib.”14 [notes.html#ch4_14a]While politicians often left Bernays cold, the men behind the scenes intriguedhim, as they might any student of public relations. James A. Farley, chairman ofthe Democratic National Committee, was especially alluring because of hiscritical role in electing Franklin Roosevelt to the first of his four terms andbecause he was willing to tell Bernays just how he did it. FDR’s success was,Farley claimed, first and foremost a result of Teddy Roosevelt’s cousin havinginherited a great name and of having a great voice and great smile.Once he recognized Roosevelt’s potential, Farley went to work selling him toAmerica in just the way Bernays might have done. He got a check-writing machine,the crude forebear of today’s automated autographer, and used it to write“personal” letters to each of the nation’s three thousand Democratic countychairmen. Such mass mailings were highly unusual then, and Farley told Bernaysthat “by the time I got through [with] this correspondence his nomination was inthe bag.”Lots of things about Farley impressed Bernays, starting with his height of 6feet 2 inches, which to the short PR man seemed “overpoweringly tall.” Thenthere was “a warmth that came out through his fingertips. His handshake was thekind of handshake you read about in your civics books. The handshake that electspresidents.” Most of all, Bernays was captivated by Farley’s instinctiveness, byhis understanding of what made people think and how, with so little effort, theycould be made to think differently. Farley, he wrote, “had such practicalwisdom, with no theories.… His attitude toward you depended on his quickintuitive grasp of what he had to do to win your friendship and to influenceyou.”15 [notes.html#ch4_15a]His relationship was more intimate with Clare Boothe Luce, a congresswoman fromConnecticut and wife of Time magazine owner Henry Luce. “When Harry asked me toadvise Mrs. Luce,” Bernays remembered in his autobiography, “the three of us metin the Luce apartment, high up in the Waldorf Towers, to discuss ways and meansto speed her on her new career. I was, as other men must have been, before andafterward, fascinated by her provocative presence. I understood why Harry hadfallen in love with her. Her lively ebullience, her beauty, sparkling eyes,blond hair and warm personality were combined with a mind as sharp as the newstainless-steel razor blades.… Clare Boothe Luce’s actions demonstrated aprinciple Thomas Jefferson had first enunciated: No one in our society is aspowerful as the individual American.”16 [notes.html#ch4_16a]The two worked together to battle racism, push for profit sharing, and ensurethe welfare of American children. And judging from their correspondence, Mrs.Luce was as captivated by the PR man as he with her. “Don’t let us have aprofessional arrangement,” he wrote in February 1946. “My conscience would notallow me to accept a fee for any advice you might ask of me on the causes inwhich I am as greatly interested as you are.… Please call on me whenever thereis anything you want to discuss on these matters.” She wrote back that August,“We have rented [a] farmhouse for the summer. Some day when you feel like adrive to the country, come up and sit under her old apple trees with me, and Iwill tell you lots of things that I have been thinking about the state of theUnion’s public relations with Maestro Bernays.”17 [notes.html#ch4_17a]Not everyone wanted Bernays’s help, of course. Supreme Court Justice Robert H.Jackson at one point had contemplated making a bid for governor of New York, andas he recalled, “Bernays wanted to take up my case. He wanted to manage thepublicity for this Young Democrats dinner, the buildup and all that went intothe making of a candidate. I just couldn’t agree to it. The program sounded tome just like the kind of a buildup that [Wendell] Willkie got in 1940, when theyall turned in a high-pressure publicity campaign.”18 [notes.html#ch4_18a]Despite Jackson’s reservations, word of Bernays’s skills spread so far thatpolitical figures from other nations came to him seeking counsel. In 1918, whenhe was working for America’s World War I propaganda agency, Bernays had lunchwith Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the Czech nationalist leader who’d fled his countryat the start of the war. Masaryk “told me he intended to declare the freedom ofCzechoslovakia ‘tomorrow afternoon,’ Saturday, October 18,” Bernays recalled.But the PR man warned that the announcement would be lost among the fashionadvice and funnies of the Sunday papers, whereas if he waited until Sunday,generally a slow time for news, the story would be prominently displayed onMonday in papers worldwide. “He was startled,” Bernays said, and protested that“‘that would be making history for the [wire service] cables.’ I assured him thecables make history. Masaryk accepted my recommendation and waited a day. Hedeclared the independence of Czechoslovakia on Sunday, October 19, 1918.… Thatis why the people of Czechoslovakia celebrated their ‘Fourth of July’ annuallyone day later than they might otherwise.”19 [notes.html#ch4_19a]The Masaryk story, one of Bernays’s favorites, turned up in several newspaperand magazine interviews as well as in his autobiography. But like many of histales of corporate accomplishment, it contains inconsistencies that make it, inthe words of George Kovtun, a Czech and Slovak specialist at the Library ofCongress, “rather doubtful.” Bernays himself frequently switched his datesaround, writing in his memoirs that his lunch with Masaryk was in 1914, but innotes for the memoirs giving the more likely year of 1918. Sometimes he datesthe declaration of freedom as October 19, other times October 28. Anotherproblem, explains Kovtun, who has written extensively about Masaryk’s relationswith America, is that the Czech leader issued his Declaration of Independence ona Friday (October 18), and newspapers reported it on Saturday, which makes clearthat Bernays got his days and dates wrong. The official Czech national holidayis October 28, but Kovtun says that’s not directly connected with events inAmerica or with Masaryk. Perhaps most telling, according to Kovtun, “Masarykwrote detailed memoirs about his activities in the First World War. He writesabout many of his American supporters, but Edward L. Bernays’s name is nevermentioned in his book.”20 [notes.html#ch4_20a]* * *Just as Bernays anticipated the tactics of today’s spinmeisters, he alsoanticipated the ethical dilemmas created by their craft. And as he watchedpresidents like Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson use public relations strategiesin their attempts to paper over their troubles with Watergate and Vietnam, herealized he had to distance himself from at least the excesses of theenterprise.That’s why, in his later years, Bernays spent almost as much time tellingstories about clients he had turned down as those he had accepted. He says, forinstance, that in the 1930s he was asked to handle publicity for the LeipzigFair, an offer that “was undoubtedly a ruse by the Nazis to have me work withthem. I turned it down because what the Nazi stood for was not my socialobjective.”21 [notes.html#ch4_21a]He declined again when representatives of Nicaragua’s right-wing governmentsought his help. “The reason I turned them down was not because Nicaragua isn’taccepted by the United Nations,” he explained. “If I’d been a doctor I mighthave an obligation to take them—but as a counsel on public relations, I can turndown something that I object to as an individual.” There also was a call from“some Spanish Jews and they wanted me to take Franco, and told me how kindFranco was to Jews. Well, I wouldn’t work for Franco. Now, I confess thatsupposing I’d had five children and I needed to feed them, I don’t know at whatpoint I would have taken Franco. I don’t think I would have taken him if I couldhave gotten something else.”22 [notes.html#ch4_22a]The call was somewhat less clear-cut when Vice President Richard Nixon camelooking for help in the 1950s. Nixon apparently wanted to polish his image as heprepared for a run at the White House, but Bernays was wary and his wife evenwarier. “Unless we’re in the poorhouse,” a friend recalls Doris FleischmanBernays saying, “we can’t go in this direction.” So Bernays once againdeclined.23 [notes.html#ch4_23a]But while some distancing was advisable and inevitable, Bernays was not one toback away from the basic PR principles to which he had devoted his life. So whenthose principles were brought into disrepute by figures ranging from Nixon toFranco, the PR master insisted it was the way his concepts were interpreted thatwas the problem, not the concepts themselves.“[P]ublic relations in politics … as in any other professional field, can beused constructively or abused,” he said. “The same thing is true of any humanfunction. You have honest lawyers and shyster lawyers. You can use the law tobring justice or you can use the law to abuse the principles of justice on whichthe society rests.”24 [notes.html#ch4_24a]An honest public relations practitioner, Bernays reasoned, could use all thewiles of the profession to measure public opinion and try to sway it, to see howpeople perceived politicians and repackage them more to the public’sliking—provided it was all done “to lead the people to where they want to go.Leadership in a democracy is solving the problems they believe need solving.”25[notes.html#ch4_25a]What about the demagogue? What was the PR man to do when a client, like Nixon,was willing to cover up a break-in at the opposition party’s headquarters and,until the very end, to deny his culpability and blame his downfall on hisenemies?Bernays had an easy answer here as elsewhere: a reputable public relationscounselor should simply say no, just as he had with Hitler and Franco. Beyondthat, he said it was up to the public to ensure that it was not manipulated byunscrupulous politicians or their unscrupulous consultants.“Just as Consumers Union has made women more aware of what to look for in agiven commodity they buy, so the voter, as a result of more education, as aresult of more discussion of this subject, will be more sophisticated inprotecting his own interests, and the public interest,” Bernays said. Education,he added, increasingly is creating American voters who are “able to penetratethe words, the pictures, and the actions they are exposed to and to look behindthem and act accordingly.”26 [notes.html#ch4_26a]"},{"pageContent":"5Rationale for a PROFESSIONAn art applied to a science. That’s how Edward L. Bernays saw his evolvingprofession of public relations. And while he knew others would invent their ownart forms the same way he’d dreamed up Big Think, he felt it was his calling tospell out the precepts of the science.Bernays’s first rule: Public relations is a two-way street. On one side the PRman interprets his client to the public, presenting as upbeat an image as hecan. It is equally important to interpret the public to the client, tellingcompany executives what people want and need, and altering the behavior of thoseexecutives just as he did that of the public.To do the job right, Bernays believed, the PR man not only needs to be smart andintuitive, he needs to understand psychology, sociology, and enough other socialsciences to get under the skin of the public and the client, to know what makesthem act the way they do and how they can be enticed to act differently.Realizing this second goal, he added, requires poring over books and journals,interviewing experts, and doing all the other research a social scientist woulddo.Precept three: America will be a much better place as a result of the publicrelations counselor’s efforts. In fact, a society this complex needs someonelike him to sort through the ideas and options competing for our attention.His first two “scientific” principles were novel, maybe even revolutionary, inthe world of public relations, but the rest of the world didn’t pay muchattention. His third notion hit a nerve because it seemed so preposterous: thepublic relations man as prophet and savior? Yet it was this idea that catapultedBernays into the forefront of a cadre of social engineers that emerged at theturn of the century. If it seemed to contradict his own notion of everyone beingfree to determine their own future, he had a ready explanation: freedom is anadmirable ideal, but it’s impractical in a nation this big, with a populationthat isn’t equal in talent or training.“In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics orbusiness, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by therelatively small number of persons—a trifling fraction of our hundred and twentymillion—who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses,”Bernays wrote in his 1928 book Propaganda. That “trifling fraction” was composedof PR professionals like him, who “pull the wires which control the public mind,who harness old forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world.”1[notes.html#ch5_1a]Such hidden propagandists might alarm others, but Bernays saw them as tamers ofthe wild crowd and guardians of a civil society. “It is not usually realized hownecessary these invisible governors are to the orderly functioning of our grouplife,” he explained. “Intelligent men must realize that propaganda is the moderninstrument by which they can fight for productive ends and help to bring orderout of chaos.”2 [notes.html#ch5_2a]But who was to blame when that science of propaganda was applied to evil ends,as it was when a Nazi propagandist consulted Bernays’s works in plotting hiscampaign to exterminate the Jews? Or when Bernays’s lofty standards for the PRman conflicted with his own lofty salary for helping tobacco companies pushtheir deadly products? In the first case he pleaded that he was powerless tostop his ideas from being misused, and that if the bad guys were usingpropaganda, the good guys had to use it to fight back—the same defense used bythe inventors of the atom bomb. As for his own alleged hypocrisy, he was adeptat reshaping his professional history to make it fit his professed ideals.Perhaps no one would have noticed those inconsistencies if Bernays had quietlyformulated his theories, as most social scientists did, and been content forthem to be discussed within a closed community of scholars. That, however, wasnot the Bernays way. He was too impatient, too much the publicity man. Heunderstood that his theories had to be known if they were to be debated, andthey had to be debated if they were to change people’s thinking and behavior. Sohe delivered a nonstop series of speeches, artfully guiding reporters who wroteup most of what he fed them. He wrote or edited 15 books, 300 articles, and morethan 125 letters to the editor—all at the same time he was representing hundredsof clients. He had a lot to say about his fledgling profession, about itsstrategies and the philosophy behind it. And he made sure it was all there inblack and white, in edition after edition and translation after translation, tothe point where it was difficult for people not to notice.The topics changed as quickly as the times he was living in, from war and peace,to depression and recovery, to why America and England weren’t getting along.But underlying everything were the singular precepts about the science of publicrelations and the role of the PR man, precepts that became Bernays’s mantra overa career that spanned four generations.* * *Bernays was an original thinker, but his theories weren’t conceived in a vacuum.To understand his ideas it’s essential to understand his times. America in the1920s seemed blessed with limitless horizons. The economy was soaring. Lindberghhad shown how far man could fly, and RCA was showing how loud a man’s voice andideas could resonate. Ford was turning out a Model T every ten seconds, and theaverage American could finally afford a car, the ultimate sign of modernity in adecade that celebrated things modern. Bernays, meanwhile, was learning that thetechnological and psychological forces that helped him shape public opinion forCaruso and rally America against the German kaiser could be tapped to do much,much more.All that economic growth and technological change brought with it new publicattitudes and social norms. Americans were beginning to view the captains ofcapitalism in a less flattering light. Muckraking journalists dug up proof ofjust how venal John D. Rockefeller and his robber baron pals were, of howWilliam Henry Vanderbilt hadn’t been kidding when he’d scoffed “the public bedamned,” and of how corrupt politicians had condoned their actions. At the sametime the social fabric was fraying as people migrated from farms to cities,abandoning old ties of community, looking for new associations to bind them, anddemanding an unprecedented accountability from leaders in business andgovernment.Change added an unsettling volatility to American life. Victorian ideals of anordered society no longer held much sway, nor did the religious principles ofdelayed gratification and presumed hierarchies. It was unclear what would taketheir place. Anarchy? The rule of the unbridled crowd, or such new and untestedgroups as labor unions? And how would all this be affected by the newtechnologies of radio, long-distance telephone lines, and the printing pressesproliferating everywhere—technologies that had proved so effective in rallyingthe nation to war?The great social theorists of the day were struggling for answers, and trying toconstruct new modes of behavior. One of the first to outline his ideas wasGustave Le Bon, a French social psychologist who in 1895 published The Crowd—AStudy of the Popular Mind. Le Bon raised the specter of a frightening new eradominated by the masses, by a crowd unbound by the rules of reason that governedthe middle class. The conscious personality of the individual is submerged oncehe joins the crowd, Le Bon argued, to be replaced by a mass mind whose behavioris unanimous, emotional, and ultimately dangerous.Another French social scientist, Gabriel Tarde, began to respond to fears raisedby his friend Le Bon. Yes, the crowd could be worrisome, Tarde said, but themass media, and particularly newspapers, could help tame that crowd into apublic bound and ordered by shared, constructive goals. British surgeon andsociologist Wilfred Trotter, in his 1916 book The Instincts of the Herd in Peaceand War, offered a different prescription. He saw the crowd as governed by thesame Freudian instincts that drove individuals, and the way to rein it in, hesaid, was to master and manipulate those instincts. That, Trotter believed,could best be done not by the press, as Tarde proposed, but by an elite group ofintellectuals able to exploit the same sorts of psychological symbols Freud wasusing with his patients.Trotter and his compatriots wanted to use their understanding of sociology andpsychology to make sense of a world that seemed out of control, particularly inlight of the brutal war raging around them. But their writings and observationsbegged as many questions as they answered: Just what sorts of symbols did theyhave in mind? And who would constitute this elite group exercising the symbols?Many scholars had theories, but no one more clearly tied together the threads ofhis forebears than author and journalist Walter Lippmann. Leaders, Lippmannsaid, couldn’t be expected to have a rational dialogue with their constituentsabout essential ideals like justice, or law and order. That would be toounwieldy, would take too long, and wouldn’t ensure the desired outcome. Instead,they should find just the right word or image to capture the popularimagination, the way they had in rallying the nation to war. The ideal mediumthrough which to exercise such symbols, he added, was the cinema, whereHollywood could make clear in an instant who were the good guys and who the bad,which ideas were worthy of loyalty and which should inspire anger.Bernays had been experimenting with such symbols for a decade, and he’d beenkeeping up with the writings of Lippmann, Le Bon, and the others. He too wassmart enough to sense the ferment, the search for new ways to control a societythat seemed increasingly out of control. He was self-assured enough to believethat while others speculated about symbols and signs, about ways to manipulatethe media and the cinema, he knew just how to do it. And he was competitiveenough to know that, if he was the first in his field to weigh in with a book,he could shape that field and promote himself in the process.He also happened to have as a client one of the leading publishers of the day,Horace Liveright.In 1923, a year after Lippmann came out with his widely read Public Opinion,Bernays published his first book, Crystallizing Public Opinion. “I suggested toHorace Liveright that he publish a book on public relations,” he recalled. “Ibelieved it would be a sound public relations move for what we were doing. Hetold me it was a ‘swell idea.’”3 [notes.html#ch5_3a]* * *That swell idea turned out to be ahead of its time. Crystallizing was greetedwith lukewarm sales back then, when few knew or cared much about this unusualprofession, but it eventually became the landmark work Bernays hoped it would.Reissued in 1961, it remains a classic in public relations studies.The book defined the new “public relations counsel,” distinguishing him from thecrude press agent whose main motivation was “getting something for nothing frompublishers,” and the equally crude “circus advance-man” and “semi-journalistpromoter of small-time actresses.” The role of the counsel on public relations,Bernays wrote, was “to advise his clients how positive results can beaccomplished in the field of public relations and to keep them from driftinginto unfortunate or harmful situations.”4 [notes.html#ch5_4a]When it came to the wider society, Bernays’s PR man could play a hero’s part,just the sort Lippmann and the others sought to transform the angry masses intoa calmer, more docile public. He could be objective enough to “step out of hisown group to look at a particular problem with the eyes of an impartialobserver,” sagacious enough to pick out solutions that were good for his clientand the public, and skillful enough to get the press to take up his cause. “Itis his capacity for crystallizing the obscure tendencies of the public mindbefore they have reached definite expression,” Bernays wrote, “which makes himso valuable.”5 [notes.html#ch5_5a]Bernays’s ideas, here as elsewhere, reflected the profound influence of hisuncle Sigmund. He talked about the use of symbols, as Freud did, and of thecentrality of “stereotypes, individual and community, that will bring favorableresponses.” He was as driven as his uncle to know what subconscious forcesmotivated people, and he used Freud’s writings to help him understand. But whilethe esteemed analyst tried to use psychology to free his patients from emotionalcrutches, Bernays used it to rob consumers of their free will, helping hisclients predict, then manipulate, the very way their customers thought andacted—all of which he openly acknowledged in his writings.He also made clear that his PR man was no democrat. Bernays, like Lippmann andLe Bon, was wary of the common man, especially when he got together with othercommon men. The social theorists were all for doing good, but felt that was bestaccomplished by socially enlightened leaders—drawn together, in Bernays’s case,by the enlightened public relations counsel—who would replace princes, priests,and other benevolent rulers of bygone days. “The reader will recall from his ownexperience,” Bernays wrote, “an almost infinite number of instances in which theamateur has been fully prepared to deliver expert advice and to give finaljudgment in matters upon which his ignorance is patent to every one excepthimself.”6 [notes.html#ch5_6a] If you can’t trust the “amateur” to get thingsdone, he added in later works, try the experts, the men already in leadershipposts in business, politics, and the arts, who can carry the message to themasses.In getting that message across, Bernays was not afraid to defend his passion forpropaganda. He wrote that “the only difference between ‘propaganda’ and‘education,’ really, is in the point of view. The advocacy of what we believe inis education. The advocacy of what we don’t believe in is propaganda.”7[notes.html#ch5_7a] He didn’t mind being called a manipulator, either, for thatwas precisely what he envisioned his public relations counsel doing—blending theprivate interests of his clients with the public interests of society.“What Lippmann set out in grand, overview terms, Bernays is running through inhow-to-do-it terms,” says Stuart Ewen, who writes and teaches about the socialhistory of public relations. “He was engaged in it, he was reading it, and hewas translating it into the finger knowledge of his trade.”8 [notes.html#ch5_8a]But Bernays was “more than simply a public relations practitioner,” Ewen adds inhis book about public relations. “He would soon situate himself as the mostimportant theorist of American public relations.”9 [notes.html#ch5_9a]PR historian Scott M. Cutlip was similarly impressed, calling Crystallizing alandmark work in the way it laid a philosophical foundation and, at least asimportant, an ethical base for the PR profession. “Bernays emphasized in thispath-breaking work that the public relations man’s ability to influence publicopinion placed upon him an ethical duty above that of his clients to the largersociety,” wrote Cutlip. “Though these seem like platitudes today, they wererevolutionary thoughts in the adolescent vocation.”10 [notes.html#ch5_10a]To really grasp Bernays’s outlook on his profession, adds journalism professorMarvin N. Olasky, it’s essential to understand his outlook on religion.“Bernays’s fundamental faith has been his lack of belief in God,” explainsOlasky, who interviewed Bernays on this topic. He “saw what he called in ourinterview ‘a world without God’ rapidly descending into social chaos. Therefore,he contended that social manipulation by public relations counselors wasjustified by the end of creating man-made gods who could assert subtle socialcontrol and prevent disaster.… Pulling strings behind the scenes was necessarynot only for personal advantage but for social salvation.”11[notes.html#ch5_11a]It was radical enough for Bernays to reject religion and God, but he ferventlybelieved that he and other PR counselors could do the job at least as well.Critics of his day weren’t sure what to make of Bernays’s ideas or his seminalwork Crystallizing. H. L. Mencken referred to it as a “pioneer book” in a 1923article in American Mercury magazine. But thirteen years later, in The AmericanLanguage, he dismissed “public relations counsel” as a fancy name for pressagent, writing that “practically all American press-agents are now ‘publicrelations counsel,’ ‘contact-managers,’ or ‘publicists,’ all tree-trimmers are‘tree surgeons’ … and the corn-doctors, after a generation as ‘chiropodists,’have burst forth as ‘podiatrists.’”12 [notes.html#ch5_12a] Ernest Gruening,later a U.S. senator, applauded the fact that business had outgrown its “publicbe damned” approach, but wondered whether “the final result [would] be greatlydifferent for the public which, while it no longer tolerates being ‘damned,’guilelessly permits itself to be ‘bunked’? Is seduction preferable toravishment?”13 [notes.html#ch5_13a]The New York Times reviewer was somewhat kinder, complimenting Bernays’s work as“the first book to be devoted exclusively to the occupation which is graduallybecoming of overwhelming national importance,” but adding in its April 6, 1924,story that “if, with the change of name, there is to come a change in the ethicsand manners of the press agent, people will be delighted to call him a publicrelations counsel or sweet little buttercup or anything he wishes.”Because Bernays wished to be noticed, even the bad reviews were strangelysatisfying to him and encouraged him to keep writing. In his 1928 bookPropaganda he presented a code of ethics for the profession, starting with theprecept that a PR man “refuses a client whom he believes dishonest, a productwhich he believes to be fraudulent, or a cause which he believes to beantisocial.” Similarly, a PR campaign should “not attempt to stampede the publicwith exaggerated claims and false pretenses, but to interpret the individualbusiness vividly and truly through every avenue that leads to public opinion.”14[notes.html#ch5_14a]His critics were less interested in what his book and essays on propaganda saidabout ethics than what they preached about social control. While Bernays sawhimself setting constructive limits on the control he felt was inevitable in alarge modern democracy, others saw him crafting a how-to for governments orcorporations that were eager to amass power. And they let him have it. “Who areyou to decide for the public, and for a fee, what is social or anti-social, whattrue or false, what is reason or prejudice, what is good or bad?” Editor andPublisher asked on September 15, 1928. “To whom are you accountable, in theevent of misjudgment?”Part of Bernays’s problem was timing. Propaganda was published just asdisillusionment over America’s failure to achieve its high-minded aims in WorldWar I was reaching its peak, and Americans were blaming British and U.S.propagandists for having dragged them into battle. Hearings also were being heldin Washington that unmasked an unprecedented propaganda campaign by the bigpower and light companies to get across their viewpoint and stifle that of theiropponents. Against that backdrop, the very title of Bernays’s book “handed theinfant field’s critics a club with which to bludgeon it,” as Cutlip notes.“Creditable propaganda for public relations Propaganda wasn’t!”15[notes.html#ch5_15a]Bernays, of course, saw the furor as sheer opportunity. The Engineering ofConsent, which appeared in 1955, included an essay of the same title that he hadwritten twenty years earlier, along with seven articles by “social scientists.”In his chapter, Bernays laid out what would become a famous eight-part formulafor a PR campaign: define your objectives; conduct research; modify yourobjectives based on that research; set a strategy; establish themes, symbols,and appeals; create an organization to execute your strategy; decide on timingand tactics; and carry out your plans. Individually each element sounded obviousenough, but putting them together the way Bernays did set him apart from hiscontemporaries, and the essay rings as true today as it did forty years ago.But Engineering, like many of his later works, was more a matter of organizingother people’s writings than doing his own, and more recycling of stale ideasthan laying out fresh ones. As one reviewer noted, “the disturbing fact is thatthe contents of the eight chapters vary widely in consideration of the level ofunderstanding” and “add little to the knowledge possessed by a practicing memberof the profession.”16 [notes.html#ch5_16a]In Public Relations, which had come out three years earlier, Bernays traced thehistory of the field “from the Dark Ages to the modern world,” then illustratedthemes he’d talked about before, this time in the context of thirty-five yearsof personal case histories. “Business should make it clear that it is concernednot only with production, markets, and profits, but also with human rights andaspirations,” he wrote. “It is only by the extension of this process in thebroadest possible ways, by the voluntary action of all American business, thatwe shall achieve the goal of a stable advancing economy, with liberty andsecurity for all within the framework of the American way of life.”17[notes.html#ch5_17a]Books weren’t his only way of weighing in on the debate and reaching out to thepublic. He also wrote magazine stories and essays, hundreds of them, andoutlined his ideas in 1971 for an oral historian at Columbia University. Onetheme he returned to repeatedly, at Columbia and elsewhere, was the distinctionbetween public relations and advertising. The PR person, he explained, isresponsible for “every impingement of his principal’s or client’s action onevery phase of public opinion.” The adman, by contrast, is narrowly focused on“the selling of a product to the public through paid space.”18[notes.html#ch5_18a] That outlook, which saw advertising as one of many smalltools available to the Big Think PR master, might be a tough sell today, whenthe nation’s biggest public relations firms are owned by ad agencies.Bernays also weighed in early on the controversial topic of public opinionpolls, writing an article in 1945 that would have been just as timely in 1995.Real leaders “truly lead,” he wrote. “But the polls encourage pseudo-leaders,who in most cases are really followers, to keep on playing follow the leader.They help maintain the status quo—which often needs changing.”19[notes.html#ch5_19a]* * *Not all of Bernays’s writing was that high-minded, although much of it wasequally prophetic. Often he zeroed in on practical issues, sharing lessons he’dlearned during his many years on the job. He broke his advice down intoeasy-to-swallow maxims, many of which have become part of the American lexicon.There was this on politics: In most elections you can count on 40 percent ofvoters siding with you and 40 against; what counts is the 20 percent in themiddle. Winning over the undecided 20 percent is what public relations is allabout. And, to Tip O’Neill’s contention that all politics is local, Bernaysadded that all PR is, too.He said any PR strategy must address the four M’s: mind power, manpower,mechanics, and money.He had a theory on stubbornness: “It is sometimes possible to change theattitudes of millions but impossible to change the attitude of one man.”On how to justify high fees: “On the basis of a Latin phrase, quantum meruit [asmuch as one deserves], the man or the corporation is much more likely to do whatyou suggest if you charge a high fee than if you charge very little.”On a person’s age: There are, he’d read and believed, five ofthem—chronological, mental, societal, physiological, and emotional. And theydon’t always match. When he was ninety-two, for instance, Bernays insisted thathis physiological functions worked as well as those of a sixty-three-year-old,and he said he had a report from his doctor to prove it.On why thank-you notes still are a good idea: The fact that most people nolonger write them is all the more reason to write them. Doing so makes youspecial and makes the recipient remember you.On the effectiveness of telegrams: “Everyone over thirty remembers the telegramwas a message of some big or important news, and a great many of us are stillunder its tyranny.”On why he read Playboy: “For the same reason I read National Geographic, I liketo see places that I will never visit.”On the best way to win someone over: It’s easier to gain acceptance for yourviewpoint by quoting respected authorities, outlining the reasons for youroutlook, and referring to tradition than by telling someone he’s wrong.The best way to land a job: Analyze the field, narrow your choice to one or twofirms, draft a blueprint for increasing their business, present the plan to atop executive, and write enough letters to make that person remember you, butnot enough to make him want to forget you. Ask for the salary you think you’reworth, and remember, you’re not just looking for a job, you’re looking for acareer.The best press releases: Each sentence should have no more than sixteen wordsand just one idea.The best place to find things: the public library.The best defense against propaganda: more propaganda.On the finesse needed to practice PR: It’s like shooting billiards, where youbounce the ball off cushions, as opposed to pool, where you aim directly for thepocketsBernays’s last book, a collection of essays entitled The Later Years: PublicRelations Insights, 1956–1986, shows how he kept thinking and writing into hisnineties, long after he gave up active practice. It also shows how wide-ranginghis interests were, with essays ranging from “Down With Image, Up With Reality”to “Plan Your Future—Don’t Gamble on It.”Any good PR man understood that the spoken word—spoken with the right modulationin the right forum—could be at least as effective as the written one. Bernaysdrew on that knowledge as he lectured before one professional group afteranother as well as in classrooms from Boston to Honolulu, sometimes with greatsuccess. “This was the most intense learning experience that I haveencountered,” Suzanne A. Poliquin wrote after he spoke to her PR seminar in1983. “Just his continued interest in public relations is an inspiration.”20[notes.html#ch5_20a] But Melvin N. Poretz, who had taken Bernays’s course at NewYork University more than thirty years earlier, wrote, “I recall him as a smallman, shaped somewhat like the then well-known Little King character. He woredrab clothing and sat behind his desk reading from notes on large index cards.…Every once in a while he would venture up the aisle, all the while carrying onhis discourse which allowed barely any time for comments from the gallery. Hedoted on two things: his connection with Sigmund Freud and his experiences in‘inventing’ the field of war propaganda during WW I.“He was, to my mind, the most boring teacher of my four years at NYU.”21[notes.html#ch5_21a]* * *What does all that writing and speechifying tell us about Bernays’s philosophyand politics?First, he not only didn’t fear controversy, he often sought it out. He seemedmost comfortable in the center of a firestorm, as the titles of his writingssuggest. The pattern was set with his first two books, Crystallizing PublicOpinion and Propaganda, which even in the 1920s had some people wondering whothis grand orchestrator was and whether he was undermining the public’s freedomto make up its own mind. The questions mounted in the wake of his 1928 article“Manipulating Public Opinion: The Why and How” in the American Journal ofSociology. In 1935 another academic journal ran his “Molding Public Opinion,” in1949 Household published “Why We Behave Like Inhuman Beings,” and in 1955 heedited The Engineering of Consent, which then, as now, was a troubling notion tomany.J. Carroll Bateman, who reviewed the third edition of Engineering in 1970 forPublic Relations Journal, echoed others within the profession when he worriedthat Bernays’s choice of title “seemed to confirm the worst suspicions of ourdetractors: we in public relations are ‘manipulators’ of mass man. It impliedthat we bend him to our wills, for some good ends and bad, regardless of hisself-interest and by means that are sometimes something less than scrupulous.Worst still, the content of the book bears out the unhappy implications of thetitle.”22 [notes.html#ch5_22a]Backed into a corner, Bernays responded as he always did—by coming out snarling,standing up to his detractors and taking umbrage at having his motivesquestioned. Yet he managed to mix in enough sense of history, and of his owninnocence, to make the indefensible suddenly sound convincing. “Now, the conceptof consent came from the Declaration of Independence, ‘the consent of thegoverned,’” he told an interviewer. “Nobody is led anywhere unless he wants tobe led.” He chose the word “engineering,” he added, because in America “the onlyway to approach a problem of millions—200 millions today—is to look at it as anengineering problem. Some people thought the use of the word ‘engineering’ wascynical to use in connection with consent, but I didn’t mean it as that. I thinkI found the words in a book on politics.”23 [notes.html#ch5_23a]Bernays considered himself a liberal, but he wasn’t always the classic kind. Hedid trumpet the importance of civil liberties and democracy. He spoke outagainst Nazism and on behalf of Henry Wallace and other liberal politicians, andhe offered his PR services to causes like the NAACP, the ACLU, and labor unions.He supported feminist causes at a time when few men did and, with his wife,spoke up for such radical notions as requiring husbands to pay their wives forhousework, child care, cooking, and other household duties. And although hetried to help President Hoover stave off a challenge by Franklin D. Roosevelt,he endorsed the direction, if not all the specifics, of Roosevelt’s New Deal,defending it to clients like Mack Truck president E. L. Bransome, who sawRoosevelt as a traitor to his class.But he was an avowed elitist, too, distrusting the masses to the point where hewas willing to manipulate them for what he insisted was a just end but whichoften turned out to be a business interest. He was a virulent anti-Communist,but at times he used precisely the same propaganda techniques as the Soviets.And he recognized the excesses of McCarthyism, but at times employed Red-baitingtactics identical to those of Senator Joseph McCarthy.Equally discomforting to liberals was how, whatever the problem, Bernays’ssolution always centered on public relations and, in many cases, on hiring him.Consider “Plain Talk to Liberals,” a series of full-page advertisements he tookout in 1944 in The Nation and The New Republic, two leading liberal journals. Inthe ads, which were later turned into a book, Bernays offers advice to fellowliberals on pressing “problems” of the day—things like the shortage of householdservants and the elitism of voluntary welfare organizations that made itdifficult for them to raise money. His solution, in each case, was to use thepublic relations approach, and his firm’s name and address appeared in largeprint at the bottom of each ad. The messages were such a shameless solicitationof business that they failed to endear him to liberals or anyone else.Other writings generated a warmer reception among liberals and almost everyoneelse. A 1940 essay, “Speak Up for Democracy,” was dedicated to “Doris and Anneand all other American children who, if we will it now, shall inherit democracyand freedom.” It laid out a detailed plan whereby average Americans could writeletters, appear on radio, and hold forums to show their support for democracyand their opposition to the totalitarianism that was sweeping Europe. A 1943address, “Democratic Leadership in Total War,” outlined a similar plan forAmerica to maintain its will to fight during World War II. Two years later hereleased a longer work called Take Your Place at the Peace Table, urging anational outpouring on behalf of “a just and enduring United Nations peace.”“In the last war, America failed to play her proper peace role because thepeople had so little voice in preliminary discussions,” Bernays wrote, stillmiffed because President Wilson had disbanded the U.S. press-propaganda missionjust before the Paris talks that followed World War I. “In the present war,unless men and women outside of government discuss peace plans openly andintelligently, and then step forward to take their place at the peace table, thefuture will bring new failures.”24 [notes.html#ch5_24a]Commentators praised his broad objectives, but ridiculed him for trying toenlist millions of Americans in what seemed like a mammoth propaganda campaign.Take Your Place is “a mixture of honest liberalism and incipient cynicalfascism. There is much talk of the individual common man and open discussion andtruth and accuracy, but much more of molding public opinion by various tools andweapons and plans and strategies,” Pitman B. Potter wrote in 1945 in TheAmerican Political Science Review. “The author presumably intends only welfareand happiness for humanity, but his methods are largely identical with thoseportrayed in Chapters VI and XI of Mein Kampf.”25 [notes.html#ch5_25a]Marvin N. Olasky, writing forty-two years later, says Potter missed the point.Such a blending of liberalism and fascism, Olasky says, “was exactly whatBernays believed to be essential, given his understanding of the failure ofnineteenth-century liberalism, and the twentieth-century ‘necessity’ of unitingliberalism with social control to avoid chaos.” As for Bernays’s endorsement ofpropaganda, Olasky adds, “if Hitler had hit upon the techniques and used themfor evil purposes, then that would be all the more reason—given theinevitability of these techniques being put into use and the inability of men toresist them—for liberals such as Bernays to use them before fascists had thechance.” While it may be hard to grasp today, Olasky writes, “Bernays believedwe must be manipulative in order to save democracy, that we have to burn thevillage in order to save it.”26 [notes.html#ch5_26a]The popular press of his day was less concerned with criticizing Bernays thanwith celebrating him and his revolutionary profession. He “has reduced the oncejovial craft of press agent to a science,” Henry F. Pringle wrote in “The MassPsychologist,” a 1930 profile in the American Mercury. “Only poets deludethemselves with the notion that love, that is to say sex, causes the world torevolve. Mr. Bernays, whose rank as public relations counsel is at least theequal of Ivy Ledbetter Lee’s, knows that it is really money that furnishes themotive power. The mass psychologist, moreover, goes much further than thepsychoanalyst who, as I understand it, can do no more than explain what hasalready taken place. Eddie can foretell the future.… His science, onceunderstood, is really very simple. What he does is to create a demand by moldingthe public mind. He creates a desire for specified goods or ideas.”27[notes.html#ch5_27a]John T. Flynn, writing two years later in the Atlantic Monthly, was equallyenamored of “The Science of Ballyhoo”: “Bernays is a philosopher, not a merebusinessman. He is a nephew of that other great philosopher, Dr. Sigmund Freud.Unlike his distinguished uncle, he is not known as a practicing psychoanalyst,but he is a psychoanalyst just the same, for he deals with the science ofunconscious mental processes. His business is to treat unconscious mental actsby conscious ones. The great Viennese doctor is interested in releasing thepent-up libido of the individual; his American nephew is engaged in releasing(and directing) the suppressed desires of the crowd.”28 [notes.html#ch5_28a]* * *Bernays loved to be written about in such sweeping terms. He loved to be thoughtof as an esteemed theorist in the mold of his revered uncle, a practitioner ofthe social sciences as well as of PR. And he loved spending time with scholarsand editors of academic journals. All that, he hoped, would help extinguish theimage of public relations men as crude or smarmy and would put him at the centerof a new field that, as he said, was a tasteful blend of art and science.But practicing public relations at the same time he was preaching about itcreated a conundrum: his words would be compared with his actions—which could beembarrassing.Take his admonition, in Propaganda, that the PR man “should be candid in hisdealings. It must be repeated that his business is not to fool or hoodwink thepublic.… When he is sending out propaganda material, it is clearly labeled as tosource. The editor knows from whom it comes and what its purpose is, and acceptsit on its merits as news.”29 [notes.html#ch5_29a]Was that merely more PR, or did Bernays mean what he wrote? If he did, he’d havehad a tough time squaring his lofty ideal of candor with his “front groups.” TheRadio Institute of the Audible Arts, for instance, appeared to be promoting apublic cause, but Bernays’s whole reason for proposing it was to advance theprivate interests of its founder, the Philco Radio and Television Corporation.Other times Bernays worked through legitimate charities but failed to point outthat his corporate client was paying the bills and benefiting from the link.That’s what happened when the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis agreedto help the United Fruit Company refute a damaging rumor that bananas werecausing polio. “No one would believe a direct refutation by the company,”Bernays recounted in his memoirs. So he placed ads nationwide making clear that“meat, fruit, vegetables, and other foods do not cause paralysis.” The ads, headded, “stated that funds had been provided by friends of the NationalFoundation as a contribution to the educational activities of that organization.The friends were the Fruit Company.”30 [notes.html#ch5_30a]Bernays repeatedly disparaged so-called experts, writing that they “areeffective in evaluating the past, but I would rather have poets evaluate thefuture. Experts are circumscribed by the limitations their own work has imposedon them, poets by their imagination.”31 [notes.html#ch5_31a] Yet those were thevery experts he and Lippmann hoped would steer society through the twentiethcentury. And while he was publicly berating them, he was privately putting manyof them to work. He apparently considered economics expert Warren Personstrustworthy enough to hire him for PR campaigns in behalf of the Ladies’ HomeJournal, then Kelvinator, then the United Brewers Industrial Foundation.While Bernays was imploring his fellow PR professionals not to sign on withunsavory clients, he was simultaneously representing the American TobaccoCompany and reading reports linking tobacco to heart attacks and cancer. Headvised other PR men to operate in the background, but Bernays himself couldn’thelp moving to center stage. Although he proclaimed the importance of civilliberties, he wasn’t sure they included the right to remain free frommanipulation. And while he wanted desperately to be taken seriously as ascholar, he promoted PR in a way that made a mockery of academic objectivity.His refusal to openly debate ideas was starkly apparent in attacks Bernayslaunched in 1951 against J. A. R. Pimlott, a twenty-eight-year-old writer whowas about to release a book, Public Relations and American Democracy, thatBernays thought would scoop one he was finishing. He attacked Pimlott’s book ina review, reprinted and distributed “ten thousand reprints of the attack,” andwrote but didn’t have the courage to sign letters to Pimlott condemning hiswork, according to Joseph Freeman, a former member of Bernays’s staff. “All thatwas wrong with this young man,” Freeman wrote of Pimlott, “was that he had thegall to publish a book on public relations before Mr. B. had his own bookready.”32 [notes.html#ch5_32a]Freeman also accused Bernays of being “a professional liberal.” The PR maestrohad a “love affair” with General Douglas MacArthur, Freeman wrote, but hid hisadmiration from his liberal friends who despised MacArthur. And Bernayscynically “told Business that its best bet was to make money with a veneer ofidealism, to make it appear that while they were after Profit—the God of Thingsas They Are—their activities at the same time served the public welfare,” saidFreeman. “Sure, Beech Nut makes money selling bacon, but you can hire doctors totell the public that big breakfasts are good for the health; thus Beech Nut ismore than a commercial firm selling bacon; it is a public benefactor aiding usto eat heavy breakfasts for the good of our health.”33 [notes.html#ch5_33a]On other occasions, however, Bernays’s motives were beyond reproach and he actedlike the liberal he said he was. That was the case with his work for better racerelations. In 1920, for example, he helped ensure the success of the NAACP’sfirst national conference in the South, and over the years he pushed clientslike Procter and Gamble to reform what he said were racist and anti-Semitichiring policies. He was even more outspoken, and further ahead of his time, inpromoting health reforms. In 1932 he orchestrated a campaign in behalf of anational commission that was proposing group medical practices, group paymentthrough private and public insurers, and more emphasis on training midwives andnursing attendants. Bernays was determined that the commission’s good work berecognized, so he convened hearings across the country, encouraged newspapers toprint stories with local angles on the national themes, mailed thousands ofletters, and spoke on shows like The National Farm Hour and The Home Radio Hour.But he was outmaneuvered by the American Medical Association, which borrowed histactics to convince the public that the commission’s proposals were dangerous.“The alignment is clear,” argued a two-and-a-half-page AMA editorial. “On theone side the forces representing the great foundations, public healthofficialdom, social theory—even Socialism and Communism—inciting to revolution;on the other side, the organized medical profession of this country urging anevolution guided by controlled experimentation which will observe the principlesthat have been found through the centuries to be necessary to the sound practiceof medicine.” Being beaten at his own game was so unsettling that Bernays wasstill steaming forty-five years later. “As a result of this effort,” he told aninterviewer, the AMA “was able to stop medical progress in this country until[President Lyndon] Johnson came along some thirty years after.”If it was sometimes tough to make his actions consistent with his words, Bernaysfound it even tougher to get his fellow PR practitioners to adhere to the highmoral standards he set. That, he explained, was why he was consumed, during hislast fifty years, with requiring that PR professionals be licensed and trainedin ethics. “Such procedure,” he said in 1986, “is followed by medical doctors,architects, engineers, and other professions. It safeguards the public againstquacks, know-nothings, or the antisocial in behavior.… When I wroteCrystallizing Public Opinion, published in 1923, I tried to lay down theprinciples, practices, and ethics of a new profession. I was unaware then thatwords, unless defined by law, are in the public domain and have the stability ofsoap bubbles.”34 [notes.html#ch5_34a]How must he have felt, then, when he learned in 1933 that Nazi propaganda chiefJoseph Goebbels was using Crystallizing Public Opinion “as a basis for hisdestructive campaign against the Jews of Germany”? Bernays heard about it fromKarl von Wiegand, foreign correspondent for the Hearst papers, who had visitedwith Goebbels in Germany and been given a tour of his library. While scholarsstill debate the extent to which the Nazis used Bernays’s works, Goebbels didemploy techniques nearly identical to those used by Bernays—skillfullyexploiting symbols by making Jews into scapegoats and Hitler into the embodimentof righteousness; manipulating the media by trumpeting Nazi triumphs on thebattlefield and hiding their extermination campaigns; and vesting unheard-ofpower in state propagandists just as Bernays had advised in Crystallizing.Bernays was savvy enough not to retell the Goebbels tale in the 1930s and 1940s,when it could have tarnished his image, and to dwell instead on how hispropaganda techniques had aided America in the two world wars. But he couldn’tresist recounting von Wiegand’s story in his autobiography, published in 1965.News that his book was on Goebbels’s shelf “shocked me,” Bernays wrote. “But Iknew any human activity can be used for social purposes or misused forantisocial ones. Obviously the attack on the Jews of Germany was no emotionaloutburst of the Nazis, but a deliberate, planned campaign.”35[notes.html#ch5_35a] In which Eddie Bernays may unwittingly have had a hand."},{"pageContent":"6Getting PERSONALThe father of public relations may have been a paternal powerhouse at theoffice, ever coddling and nurturing his fledgling child, but at the WashingtonSquare townhouse he shared with his wife and two daughters Eddie was regarded assomething less than the perfect parent. Part of the problem was that he simplywasn’t around much. When he was at home his behavior could be as infuriating asit was endearing.Especially troubling to his daughters was the way Eddie treated his wife, Doris.He perpetually described her as his twenty-four-hour-a-day partner, his equal athome and at work. But while Doris shared the burden at the office, Eddie didnothing to help her manage the household even though her chronic back painbecame so intense that she eventually needed a motorized chair to carry herupstairs. “He wanted to maintain the fiction that [the household] worked byitself,” says his older daughter, also named Doris. “Mother waited until he leftthe house before she did any housewifely stuff.”1 [notes.html#ch6_1a]He also related to his children on his own terms. Anne, his younger daughter,was confused about her Jewishness and asked when she was five, “What am I?”Eddie, she wrote years later, “answered with admirable simplicity that I was‘nothing,’ adding, ‘You can choose when you grow up.’ Squirming at being removedfrom the possibility of an identity, I took another tack: ‘What is a Jew?’ Hisreply, something complex about races and how I must never confuse race withreligion and since our family was not ‘religious,’ I was (again) ‘nothing,’ leftme even squirmier. I said to him that even if he and I could agree I wasnothing, why did other people think I was Jewish? ‘Because,’ said he, grinningat the opportunity to deliver such an all-purpose punch line, ‘they arewrong.’”2 [notes.html#ch6_2a] All of which was confounding to a little girl whosimply wanted to know how she fit in.There were good times, too, of course. Like the nights when Eddie would appearat the foot of their beds with news about the swashbuckling “Captain Merriwell,”choosing the ideal intonation for the captain’s comrades, the freewheelingFrenchman and the gruff German, and vesting the tales with such vitality thathis daughters knew they were the most important people in his world at thatmoment. Or when he walked with them down Fifth Avenue, in a three-piece suit andwork shoes, and suddenly began to skip. It was his way of defying convention,explains his older daughter, Doris. “He was saying, ‘The hell with it, I’m notgoing to play that game.’”Those were sides of Eddie that both daughters adored but saw too seldom.“He defined himself entirely by his work,” Doris says. It was partly that Eddiecame to fatherhood in an era when few fathers actively participated in raisingtheir kids. His age also was a factor; by the time Doris was born he was almostthirty-seven and was deeply invested in his career. Most of all, it was Eddiehimself.Like Doris, Anne remembers her father always being at work or at after-workgatherings. When he was home he couldn’t sit still for long. Family dinnersoften evolved into discussions about the office—discussions the girls weren’tinvited to join and didn’t want to. And after a whole weekend with the childrenEddie would be ready to burst, the remedy for which was inviting a houseful ofguests on Sunday night. He did relish his special time with his daughters, buthe felt that raising them was their mother’s responsibility.“The word ‘workaholic’ was invented for him. I hate that word,” says Anne, anovelist and writing instructor. “I don’t think he was meant to be a father,really.”3 [notes.html#ch6_3a]* * *Eddie might have said the same of his own father. Ely Bernays, a moody andstrident man, had to work endless hours to get ahead as a new arrival in Americain the 1890s. He wasn’t home much, and when he was, his children often coweredbefore his temperamental outbursts. As a child, Eddie told himself and othersthat he would never marry, have children, or repeat the mistakes of his father.And yet, in a way, that is precisely what he did.Ely didn’t have the luxury of musing about his future when he was young. Hisfather died in Vienna of a heart attack in 1879, and Ely, at nineteen, had tosacrifice his dream of college and become family provider by taking his father’splace as secretary to a well-known economist. He eventually met, fell in lovewith, and married Anna Freud, Sigmund’s younger sister. And, having heard theU.S. consul describe America as the promised land, the young administratorresolved to relocate his family there, hoping he could earn enough money tosupport his three children and help his sisters and mother.Ely may have had another incentive to leave Austria, one his son apparentlynever suspected: He had “several” illegitimate children he “was secretly payingfor,” according to Freud biographer Ernest Jones. Hoping to spare Eddie and hissisters, Jones never mentioned his suspicions in his books, but he did outlinethem in a 1952 letter to Freud’s daughter, also named Anna.4 [notes.html#ch6_4a]The Bernayses’ move to America wasn’t easy or quick. First Ely had to borrowmoney from his brother-in-law, Sigmund Freud, which was embarrassing, givenrecent strains in their relations. Then he temporarily left his two daughtersbehind with the Freuds, taking only his wife and Eddie, who celebrated his firstbirthday on the steamer. The three lived in boardinghouses until Ely establishedhimself as a grain exporter on the Manhattan Produce Exchange and could affordnicer quarters, at which point he brought over his other children.For much of Eddie’s youth Ely and his family prospered, buying their first homeon 139th Street, then moving more than a mile downtown to a spacious,three-story brownstone at Madison Avenue and 121st Street. It faced lush MountMorris Park (now called Marcus Garvey Park), where the children watched TheodoreRoosevelt’s Rough Riders parade by. From there it was another step up, to abrownstone at 121 West 119th Street in Harlem, which was then a thriving,self-assured neighborhood. Summers meant a three-month escape to the spas ofSharon Springs, New York; to the Adirondack Mountains; or, on one specialoccasion, to Ossiacher Lake in Austria, where Uncle Sigmund paid a visit.Eddie now had two younger sisters to go with his two older ones. With four girlsmilling about, along with three maids and a cook, he stole away as often aspossible to play stickball in the streets. Even better, he would retreat to hisbedroom and disappear into a book by Kipling or Dickens or into one of GilbertPatten’s dime novels about Frank Merriwell, the inspiration for the tales helater told his kids and grandkids.His youthful recollections were more sobering than serene, however, and focuseddisproportionately on his inability to please his father. “The household duringthe day centered around Mother,” he remembered decades later. But “in theevenings and on holidays and Sundays my father dominated everything andeveryone, intimidating all of us with his unpredictable temperament. My earliestrecollection of him is that of a heavyset man leaving the house every weekdayand Saturday morning for a place called ‘downtown’ to make money.“My mother was constantly on the alert to prevent explosions of Father’s temper.Cooking odors were anathema. He would sniff the air like a lion when he steppedinto the vestibule of the house each evening. If someone had forgotten to closethe dumbwaiter and odors sifted up from the kitchen through the house, he wouldcall out in a loud, stern voice, ‘Open the windows!’ My mother would rush to thewindows and throw them open regardless of outside weather. I never knew why myfather was so obsessed with details.“My sisters and I stood in awe of our father. We observed silence in hispresence until we were addressed. When he left the house in the morning hecalled good-bye to us from the hall. We then ran from wherever we were andpecked a farewell on his bearded cheek. After dark he returned. I saw him for afew moments after supper, before I was sent to bed.… He occasionally raised hisvoice to us in commanding tones, which had the shock effect of a New Yorktraffic cop on a timid motorist. His awesome personality made corporalpunishment unnecessary.”5 [notes.html#ch6_5a]Eddie’s wife, Doris, offered an even more telling glimpse of life in ElyBernays’s home. “Eddie’s father was a famous disciplinarian,” she wrote. “Everyevening one of his children stood sentry duty to warn the rest that they saw hisjaunty figure coming up the avenue, swinging a cane. ‘Papa’s here,’ the lookoutyelled and all the children ducked. They seemed to fear him long after they weregrown.”6 [notes.html#ch6_6a]Ely’s letters to his young son suggest that he genuinely tried to communicate.Yet their interaction was curiously indirect, even formal. If its tenor wasstandard for father-son relationships of the time, it also reflected a coolnessbetween the two that intensified over the years. When Eddie was thirteen and atsummer camp, Ely wrote, “Horseback riding will do you a world of good. It willmake you strong and tall, and when the boy who left us early in July comes back,I expect to see a man. All the other diversions are of a far more pleasantcharacter than those you could have at Lake Placid, and therefore, whilst Idon’t want to banish you, or put you in exile, I would very much like to haveyou stay for the whole season.” He ended by saying, “I embrace you as I loveyou, and am, your affectionate father,” then asked the boy “how much money [do]you have left so I can send you some more?”7 [notes.html#ch6_7a]Money, however, soon became another source of tension between the two. Ely’sbusiness, which was vulnerable to the vagaries of international grain markets,suffered setbacks, and during his last year in grammar school Eddie had totransfer from private to public school. “Here, for the first time,” he wrotelater, “I came into close contact with a cross-section of cosmopolitan New York.I now recognized that the society I was living in was much more complicated thanI had thought. I was surprised and confused when I found that the boys in my 8Bclass didn’t talk, think and act as I did. Their home backgrounds were unlikemine. I recognized I had a much more protected life than they, theunderprivileged children of poor Irish, Italian, Russian and Polish immigrants.They were rougher, hardier, tougher, more aggressive and belligerent than thechildren I had known. The fist was the instrument of survival, a right swing tothe jaw the arbiter of discussions. I had never been aware that people likethese existed.”8 [notes.html#ch6_8a]Eddie had even less contact with blacks. In fact, during his entire youth heknew only two. One was Freeman, the butler, who walked him to school when he wasten. The other was Matilde Wilson, his mother’s companion for forty years.Despite his unfamiliarity with his surroundings, and the fact he attended PublicSchool 184 for only one year, Eddie was class valedictorian. From there heenrolled in De Witt Clinton High School, which back then was in Manhattan andwas known for its setting in the slums of the old San Juan Hill as well as itsdedicated faculty. Eddie thrived, sinking into school activities like the Magpienewspaper, the Biological Field Club, and the City History Club. He headeddowntown whenever he could to catch a vaudeville act or a Broadway opening.But those carefree enthusiasms were ever tempered by his father’s ambitions forhim. “He wanted me to be a farmer because he believed that America’s futurerested on the development of its rural areas; on the other hand, I don’t thinkhe expected me to farm but hoped I would follow in his footsteps on the ProduceExchange,” Eddie remembered in his memoirs. “On a black night in September 1908I bade good-bye to my parents and left for the dreary Jersey City station, abare wood platform covered by a tin roof, and boarded the overnight train toIthaca.”9 [notes.html#ch6_9a]Their correspondence while Eddie was at Cornell makes it clear that Ely careddeeply about his son but didn’t know or care how much Eddie detested farming,and that Eddie couldn’t bring himself to confront his father. “My Dear SonEdward,” Ely wrote in 1909 from a train heading to Chicago. “I was very glad tohear that in your farm-work you have attained that feeling of safety and suretywhich is after all the basis of every successful achievement, and what pleasedme most of the remarks, which you have made about this farm-work, is the onepoint which you mentioned, viz., that if anyone would put you on a farm today,you would be able to know where to start when the beginning of the work wereleft to you.… I want you to keep me posted, on the current, about everythingthat you are doing because you must naturally know what an interest I take inthe plans and welfare of my only son. Lovingly your father.”10[notes.html#ch6_10a]In a letter to Ely on the eve of his graduation, Eddie explained that, while hewanted to briefly test the wider world, “I believe that as I grow older I shallfeel more and more attracted to enter your business, with the advantages andchances I have there.… I am glad you left the decision of the degree in myhands, for it shows that you have at least a certain degree of confidence inme.”11 [notes.html#ch6_11a]But Eddie had no intention of ever again having anything to do with horses orhogs, or with raising or trading in grain. He may have loved his father deeply,but he was determined not to follow in his footsteps. That he could notarticulate that, that he was forced to dwell in the shadow of his father’sdisapproval, rankled throughout his life and made him feel that whatever heightshe reached were never quite enough.When he landed a job with the Medical Review of Reviews in 1913 he was eager toshare his joy with his family, but as he recalled fifty-two years later, “Mymother, of course, acquiesced. She would have agreed with any decision I made.My father looked disapproving. He said deliberately, ‘How can you be a competenteditor of a medical journal when Cornell University prepared you for anagricultural career and not medicine?’”12 [notes.html#ch6_12a]The relationship between father and son didn’t improve as Eddie’s career inpublicity blossomed. “My father’s attitude toward my activities remained lessthan lukewarm,” he remembered. “He was disappointed that his son had turnedpress agent. He enjoyed good theater and concerts. To occupy an orchestra seatat a performance was one thing, but for his only son to make a career of thetheater, in daily contact with actors and managers, was something else. Theinfluences of his Edwardian background put Broadway life outside the pale ofrespectability. Theater people were vagabond troupers in his mind; they wereamoral or, worse, immoral; they had little family life, background orculture.”13 [notes.html#ch6_13a]Eddie and Ely were men who had sprung from vastly different soil. The father wasrooted in yesterday, defined by the precise manners and rigid rituals ofturn-of-the-century Europe. The son, having been nourished by the raw Americanearth, was brash and direct and ever striving for the new. Both regretted thatthey could never find greater common ground.Yet Eddie told the story of his father the way he told about his publicrelations triumphs, often skewing the facts to make a point. He repeatedlyportrayed Ely as insensitive and self-absorbed, discounting contradictoryevidence in his own autobiography: that his father had served as trustee of asettlement house on East Broadway and was dispatched by Governor TheodoreRoosevelt to report on orphan asylums in Europe; that Ely provided for hismother and sisters back in Europe as well as for his wife’s family; and, perhapsmost important, that he knew his son well enough to be the only one who guessedhis plan to marry Doris Fleischman even as Eddie insisted he would never marry.Ely’s life in his last years, as in his first, was hard. World War I blockedU.S. grain exports to the point where he had to retire. In 1922 he and Annabought a large Georgian-style home in the Quaker Ridge section of Scarsdale, anaffluent village north of the city, and settled down to what they hoped would bea quiet life. But several months later, at the age of sixty-three, he developedappendicitis, and when his doctors failed to diagnose the ailment, he went intoshock, his appendix burst, and he developed peritonitis. “After a week in whichthe doctors could do little to alleviate his suffering, I visited him for thelast time,” Eddie recalled. “He couldn’t speak, but his eyes recognized me andthey appeared to be saying good-bye out of an almost unconscious state.”14[notes.html#ch6_14a]* * *The young man who awaited his turn at the marriage chapel that Saturday in 1922,giddily dispensing twenty-dollar bills to every clerk within arm’s reach sincethere were no friends present to share his joy, was certain his marriage wouldbe free from his parents’ uncompromising, gender-prescribed patterns. That,after all, was a big part of what had drawn him to the freethinking DorisFleischman.Doris was equally determined to resist repeating what she saw as the mistakes ofher parents. Her father, Samuel Fleischman, was a distinguished New Yorkattorney who ruled his household nearly as rigidly as Ely Bernays. “My father,”she explained years later, “kept us in an uneasy subjection by lowering thetemperature of his blue eyes.… My mother’s attitude showed the futility of anystruggle. She was completely docile, never argued with Pop, always followed hiswishes.… I was dominated, and still am, by Pop’s value judgments.”15[notes.html#ch6_15a]Such qualms about their parents’ marriages may explain why their courtship wasso prolonged and tentative. They met during family vacations at Far RockawayBeach, on Long Island, when Eddie was seventeen, Doris sixteen, and became fastfriends. She shared with him the fiction she wrote in high school and college,and he arranged a surprise beach party for her seventeenth birthday. She sangfor him and played the piano when he visited her at Barnard College and afterEddie left Cornell, he helped his parents relocate to an apartment off RiversideDrive, “not unmindful of the fact that my good friend Doris lived around thecorner with her family.” But having moved next door, “I did not immediately‘rush her’; I knew she was there and that was good, I saw her from time to timeand we became close friends.”16 [notes.html#ch6_16a] Doris was also preoccupiedwith other passions, as she good-naturedly recalled: “When I think of the boys Imight have married if they had proposed to me—a moron, a genius, an athlete, anesthete [sic] and a soul-torn introvert! Luckily they were still in school orfresh out of college. I was sure of only one thing and that was that I wouldmarry an athlete. (Eddie thinks fresh air is unwholesome, and the sun ispoisonous.)”17 [notes.html#ch6_17a]Their friendship evolved into a business relationship when she joined his newlyopened publicity firm in 1919, and after work they began spending more timetogether, attending balls in Greenwich Village and strolling along Fifth Avenue.“I did not realize our relationship was growing closer, nor did she,” heremembered afterward. “Actually I don’t recall what happened in the last fewmonths before our marriage—it was all so exciting. When our friendship grew sointense that we didn’t want to leave each other, we decided to marry.”18[notes.html#ch6_18a]It took a full thirteen years from meeting on the beach to marrying, and whilethey’d succumbed to an institution about which both had doubts, they signaledfrom the start that it would be a different kind of union by not inviting, oreven informing, their parents.The signals didn’t stop there. A year before marriage both joined the Lucy StoneLeague, a feminist group dedicated to ensuring a woman the right to retain hermaiden name after marriage. Doris used the name Fleischman when she signed in atthe Waldorf on her wedding night, leading editorial writers to fret about anational wave of immorality. Several months later she requested a passport inher maiden name, then agreed to take one reading “Doris Fleischman Bernays(professionally known as Doris E. Fleischman).” Two years later the StateDepartment simplified things by making her the first married woman ever to get apassport in her maiden name. And when young Doris was born, health officials atfirst refused to accept her mother’s maiden name on the birth certificate, thenbacked down in the same precedent-setting way the State Department had.An even clearer sign of their intention to do things differently was thebusiness union Eddie and Doris formed alongside the personal one.“Twenty-four-hour-a-day partnership” is the way Eddie described it over theyears, which was a radical notion back then. They even signed papers promisingto split fully and equally the firm’s profits and losses. “In 1922 a womanentering any profession other than nursing, teaching or social work was anovelty,” he wrote later, “and treating her as an equal in a profession was asource of even more wonderment.”19 [notes.html#ch6_19a]Taken together, the symbols amounted to a Big Think-like campaign, this time onbehalf of his novel profession and his pathbreaking way of practicing it. He’dalready transformed his wedding rites into a magnificent stunt that generatedworldwide publicity, and now the marriage itself was becoming absorbed into hisworld of public relations. It was increasingly difficult to separate hispersonal from his professional life.But the gestures themselves were not as clear-cut as they seemed. Doris was apioneer in the world of work, but she was a forerunner with a guide. She wastalented enough to seek a career in the flourishing world of opera or as apainter or a psychiatrist. Instead, she took Eddie’s advice and, in 1914,accepted an offer, which he’d help secure, to write for the women’s pages of theNew York Tribune. She immersed herself in her new occupation, interviewingluminaries like Colonel Teddy Roosevelt, settlement house pioneer Jane Addams,and Lewis E. Lawes, the warden of Sing Sing. She became the first woman to covera prizefight, and she rose to assistant women’s page editor, then assistantSunday editor. Again at Eddie’s urgings, but with some trepidation, she gave upworking for newspapers and magazines to become the first employee at the“publicity direction” office he opened in the summer of 1919.Doris also was a pioneer for women’s rights, but winning the right to use hermaiden name wasn’t one of her proudest achievements. Eddie admitted it was hewho’d insisted on their joining the Lucy Stone League, “bringing a reluctantDoris with me.” And it was he who pushed her to use her maiden name on theirwedding night, because “I had an inner fear that marriage (though I wanted itfiercely with Doris) would take away some of my liberties as an individual ifthere were a Mrs. added to my name.”20 [notes.html#ch6_20a] Doris took greatersatisfaction in having marched in the first Women’s Peace Parade in 1917 and inhaving written books and articles urging women to assert themselves at home andwork. As for her battle to keep her maiden name, she reflected in 1949 that “aLucy Stoner is mistaken in thinking that keeping her father’s name is moresignificant than taking her husband’s name. We were guilty of belief in magic.We thought a name itself had power to confer a separate identity.“Miss,” she added good-naturedly, “will now endeavor to turn herself into Mrs.She will secure a new passport, a new checkbook, a new letterhead. Some of herprofessional acquaintances and a few of her friends will deplore the defection.But basically, since a word at best can reflect only a truth, there will be nochange in the inner life or external motions of an ex-miss.”21[notes.html#ch6_21a] True to her word, Doris six years later officially tradedin her father’s Fleischman for her husband’s Bernays.Once she resolved to enter her husband’s world of public relations, Doris didplay a central role in building the Bernays empire, and when the press dubbedhim the prince of publicity she could rightfully claim to be the princess. Shemade her mark first as a wordsmith, churning out press releases and polishedstories on clients ranging from the U.S. War Department to the American TobaccoCompany. She also conceived of, wrote, and edited a four-page newsletter calledContact, which reprinted parts of speeches and articles on public relations,sorted through new ideas in the field, and promoted the activities of theBernays office. And she ghost-wrote scores of speeches and strategy papers thatwere delivered under her husband’s name. It’s easy to pick out her writings fromamong the many papers that Eddie Bernays left behind: they’re the ones with richvocabulary and poetic flourish, free from the more formal style that was histrademark. They reflected the same careful crafting and subtle insight we see inher 1955 book, where she writes, “Men are commonly thought to be frightened atthe responsibility of marriage. But like most traditional ideas about the twosexes, this belief is somewhat misleading. It is the bride who ought to faint atthe altar. She is about to assume domestic omnipotence as if it were asuperwedding gown. And she is agreeing to split her personality into two parts,although most people believe that her two personalities are the same, that womanis synonymous with housewife.”22 [notes.html#ch6_22a]Doris consulted on clients, too, usually behind the scenes, acting as a soundingboard for Eddie’s strategic and tactical decisions, reinforcing what she likedand suggesting revisions for what she didn’t. While most of that counseling isdifficult to reconstruct, because it happened at home in the evening, hersoft-spoken but hard-hitting approach is clear in her handling of the NAACPnational convention in 1920.A Jewish woman from New York wasn’t the delegate most publicity offices wouldhave dispatched to argue on behalf of blacks before the governor of Georgia, butEddie and Doris liked to surprise people. And Doris could be just as persuasiveas her husband. She convinced the governor to put the militia on standby, made apersonal pitch to the Atlanta mayor to attend the convention, then advised thecity editor at the Constitution to print the story on the front page. As sherecounted later, she was so busy that she never noticed the four bodyguards thatthe NAACP organizers had assigned to protect her, or the white men at her hotelwho tossed pennies at her feet, implying she was a prostitute who could be hadcheaply.Doris’s most valuable contribution to the practice was in the brilliant way shecompensated for Eddie’s shortcomings. It was she who provided precision andorganization when he was overcommitted and behind schedule. It was her unerringeye that astutely sized up would-be clients and associates where he was easilyhoodwinked. And it was she who tempered his lofty, and often exaggerated,rhetoric.“Eddie could get a client totally mad, but in ten minutes Doris could get themback. She was totally gracious,” recalls Pat Jackson, a PR pro who worked withthem in their later years.23 [notes.html#ch6_23a] Camille Roman, who was closeto both Bernayses, says that Doris “was the one who I felt was grounded in thepractical, what would really work. Eddie was always dealing in the greatpotential.” In their later years, Roman added, “they’d gotten that partnershipreally worked out. It was almost seamless.”24 [notes.html#ch6_24a]Seamless, except that one partner was invisible—an odd way for a 50-50partnership to work.For all her contributions, Doris never worked face-to-face with the firm’sclients. She never outlined in person the recommendations she’d spent hoursdrawing up, never made the contacts she described in her newsletter, Contact.Most clients never knew she was involved at all, and Eddie and Doris’sco-workers never knew precisely what she did, although they were aware she had ahuge influence on her husband.Eddie offered gender as the reason for her silent presence. “She recognizedimmediately that her ideas might be treated as ‘a woman’s’ rather than judged ontheir merits,” he explained in his memoirs, “so she decided early to withdrawfrom personal relations with clients. I conferred with her after the client hadleft. All in all, I think Doris was right to avoid the day-to-day ups and downsof interpersonal relationships with clients.”25 [notes.html#ch6_25a]Doris had offered an almost identical explanation a decade earlier: “If ideaswere considered first in terms of my sex, they might never get around to beingjudged on their merits.” Yet she went on to ask, “Have I been a coward towithdraw from such active company? Perhaps I have.”26 [notes.html#ch6_26a]Her role in the shadows may have been a sign of the times, and that may be whythe only name clients generally saw when they hired the firm was that of EdwardL. Bernays, Counsel on Public Relations. Hers sometimes appeared, in smallertype, making clear that the firm consisted of “A Partnership of Edward L.Bernays and Doris Fleischman.”“A joint decision seems to have been made that Bernays would command theforeground and Fleischman would stay in the background in most matters,” reportshistorian Susan Henry, who has studied Doris’s life and works. When she askedEddie about that, Henry adds, “he also admitted that her partnership wasdownplayed deliberately in order to ‘make the “Bernays” stand for advice onpublic relations.’ And he acknowledged that his own reputation might havesuffered if Fleischman’s involvement had been common knowledge, since ‘if awoman partner had been publicized who wasn’t already well known, it coulddeprecate the man because it would have been strange and unusual.’”27[notes.html#ch6_27a]It would also have been strange and unusual for Eddie to have shared thespotlight with anyone, even his beloved wife. He relished the publicity hisunusual partnership produced, especially later, when feminism became the rageand he was regarded as an early prophet. He had encouraged Doris to pursue acareer at a time when that was highly controversial, but he also had set thelimits. Her contributions notwithstanding, it is Eddie, not Doris, who today iswidely viewed as the founder of the profession they pioneered together.Anne Bernays says she’s disturbed that her father didn’t push the limits ofconvention with his own wife the way he did with other feminist causes. “Hewanted her to be a feminist outside the house,” she concludes, “but inside hewanted her to be a Victorian wife.”28 [notes.html#ch6_28a]* * *The Bernays household was anything but Victorian.Eddie and Doris’s approach to child-rearing was founded on two simpleprinciples: learning from the mistakes of their parents, especially theirfathers; and applying the most modern thinking from psychology, sociology, andthe rest of the social sciences.That meant hiring separate nannies for Anne and young Doris to ensure thatneither was favored, a tendency their parents felt was inevitable with a singlecaretaker. The Bernays approach also meant being as permissive aspossible—spanking the girls just once, “for running into the street,” lettingthem raise in a spare bathroom a chicken Anne had hatched in a schoolexperiment, and asking whether they’d “like to” pick up their toys rather thanordering them to do so. It meant accepting nudity as natural but steering clearof comic books, hiring a psychology student as a nurse, and schedulingeverything from feedings to playtime by the clock rather than by the child.From the time they could talk, the girls called their father Eddie. Not Daddy,Dad, Pop, or Father. “He said, ‘If you call me Father,’” Doris recalls, ‘“I’llcall you daughter.’”29 [notes.html#ch6_29a]“Eddie and I became parents when our babies and the squalling sciences of childcare and child psychology were new,” Doris Fleischman wrote years later. “Weopened our arms wide to each new theory, believing that each latest one wouldsolve all problems of bringing up children, and with equal enthusiasm wediscarded old theories, believing they were quite wrong.”30 [notes.html#ch6_30a]How did they find out about the latest theories? From books, the same place theygot so many ideas at work. “Whenever a new problem has come up in my job aswife, housekeeper, and mother, I have found it helpful to read a few books,spend a few days in special libraries, talk to authorities, or make a fairlybroad survey,” Doris explained.31 [notes.html#ch6_31a] Eddie, too, was concernedthat each stage of development happen on time and in the right direction.“Little Doris’s routine was carefully researched and adoringly watched,” heremembered. “We felt we were really the first parents in the world.”32[notes.html#ch6_32a]His burgeoning public relations practice let Eddie meet all his family’smaterial needs, ensuring they lived in even greater comfort than he had enjoyedduring the best times of his own childhood, and liberating them from thedownturns that had perpetually plagued his father.Their first real home at 8 Washington Square North was around the corner from 44Washington Mews, the meticulously converted stables where Eddie and Doris hadspent the first seven years of their marriage. The Washington Square townhouseoffered the space they needed for a family while letting them stay in theGreenwich Village neighborhood they loved. The four-story brick-front Colonial,which they leased in 1929 from diplomat and businessman William AverellHarriman, had two bronze roosters standing watch on the stoop, a drawing roomwith high ceilings and a white marble mantel, and sliding doors of mahoganyopening onto the music room and dining room. A staircase with a smooth railingled up to three floors of bedrooms. Across the street was magnificentlymaintained Washington Square Park, the perfect place to push a pair of babystrollers.The view was even better, and the appointments finer, at the Sherry NetherlandHotel, where in 1932 they took over the twenty-seventh floor. Directly acrossthe street was Central Park, where the children came to cherish the duck pondand stone bridge. The Bernayses stayed in that neighborhood for thirty years,later moving to a spacious apartment at 817 Fifth Avenue where the childrenbumped into Gloria Swanson in the elevator and had a glorious view of the park.Still later they moved back to the Sherry Netherland, then to a private home at163 East Sixty-third Street, which was the first they owned rather than rented.Built by architect Frederick Sterner, it was actually a double house with 40feet of frontage and a dining room that looked onto a backyard of trees andbushes. The living room was 18 feet high and 40 feet across, with a balcony atone end and a fireplace big enough to stand in.Summers were spent in suburban Irvington, Mount Kisco, Port Chester, andPurchase, New York, in rented mansions with as many as thirty rooms. Eddieeventually bought a farm in the Berkshire Hills near Litchfield, Connecticut,with “a pastoral view of green rolling landscape that Doris painted and that Icould admire from my bed when I woke up.”It’s unclear why they moved so often, except that motion and change weredefining metaphors for Eddie. They were part of what it meant to be prosperousin the new America, to be unbound by conventions of religion, profession, oreven household roots. That energy was a big part of what made him so appealingto clients and acquaintances, and it was something to which his wife andchildren simply had to adjust.A 1937 insurance appraisal offers a glimpse of the lifestyle the Bernaysesmaintained. A Steinway grand piano stood ready to entertain in the drawing room,where listeners could sink into a Hepple-white sofa covered with mulberry silkvelour or sit straight-backed on mahogany Chippendale chairs draped inearly-seventeenth-century Flemish tapestry. If the music didn’t move them, theycould inspect a twenty-one-inch portrait of Doris, an oil painting by JulesPascin, a drawing by André Derain, or an unsigned watercolor by Paul Cézannetitled “Study of One Colored and Four Black and White Apples.” The room alsofeatured a small menagerie—a pair of modern Chinese turquoise pottery parrots ontree stumps, an eight-inch heavy brass cat, and a seven-inch Royal Doultonred-and-black glazed China penguin. The drawing room furnishings were valued at$14,828.50, while those in the whole house were appraised at $32,327, theequivalent of more than $300,000 today.33 [notes.html#ch6_33a]Eddie liked to show off his homes, so much so that a big factor in choosing themwas how they’d accommodate the salons for which he was becoming famous. Screenstar Edward G. Robinson might drop by to talk, along with hotel magnate PrinceSerge Obolensky, former Rusian prime minister Aleksandr Kerenski, dancers fromthe American Ballet Theatre, professors from Columbia and Princeton, businessleaders and journalists. Eddie often decided to play host at the last minute,making twenty to thirty calls on Sunday morning for an affair that evening.Doris, overcoming her natural shyness, managed to assemble just the rightingredients for a splendid feast. “Parties,” he wrote afterward, “never servedany purpose except that of enjoying our guests.”Which wasn’t quite true. For Eddie, parties were a form of sustenance. Hecouldn’t stand being alone. That would have required self-sufficiency and evenintrospection—anathema to a man whose whole definition of himself revolvedaround his work in the public arena. And to him, parties were the most marvelouspublic arena of all.Not surprisingly, Eddie was the ideal host. He would greet his guests as theyarrived, taking them by the elbow and steering them around the room, rememberingeveryone’s name and occupation and presenting the latest arrivals in a way thatmade them seem twice as fascinating as they were. He also understood how togenerate just enough tension to keep things interesting without offendinganyone. “We found people emerged most,” he observed years later, “when they werein contrast with one another and had divergent backgrounds and points of view.Conformity is a sin, even at parties.”34 [notes.html#ch6_34a]In the summer, when the celebrations moved to the estates he rented in thesuburbs, he would insist that his guests take a dip in the pool or stay for agame of croquet. New Year’s was even more festive. In 1929 Eddie and Doris threwa bash to which 250 were invited and 300 turned out. The next year they did itagain, and they put out a press release trumpeting their best-known guests. Thenumbers were getting so big that, as Eddie recalled, “in 1932 we invited no oneand went to bed early.” Expectations had been set, however, and “the doorbellrang seventeen times between 10:00 P.M. and 1:00 A.M.”35 [notes.html#ch6_35a]Homes that big and a lifestyle that active required lots of maintenance, whichmeant a huge household staff. On Washington Square they had a butler, laundress,cook, kitchen maid, houseman, waitress, upstairs girl, and nurse. “I was waitedon hand and foot,” remembers Anne, who knew what she was talking about when shewrote her 1975 novel Growing Up Rich, about another wealthy family. “I wasawoken by a maid climbing three flights of stairs and saying, ‘Time to get up,Miss Anne.’ I’d come home and my bed was made, everything was picked up. Iremember asking my mother if I could do some work, I felt literally helplessbecause there was so much help, and she said, ‘No, that’s Celia’s job, or that’sCatherine’s job.’”36 [notes.html#ch6_36a]Celia, Catherine, and the other servants knew their place. If they didn’t, theywere quickly told that it was in the kitchen, their bedrooms, or the crampedservants’ dining area, but not the family rooms when the family was there andnot in the swimming pool at any time. Bernays treated his household help fairly,but he was exceedingly class-conscious and wasn’t above referring to thechauffeur as “Jack Dot Dope.”The girls also got the best, and the most costly, schooling. First it was theCity & Country School, which Eddie describes as “a progressive school in theVillage run by Caroline Pratt, who loved children and hated parents.” Then hedecided on a more formal and fashionable approach, opting for the BrearleySchool, which came strongly recommended by his client and friend Orlando Weber,president of Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation. Young Doris graduated fromRadcliffe. Anne started at Wellesley and finished at Barnard, where her motherhad gone.If his daughters were grateful for those advantages, they were confused by theirfather’s inconsistent spending habits. Eddie was almost monastic when it came toclothes, owning a single pair of shoes, which he wore even after they had holes,along with several plain suits he had Doris pick out. He didn’t mind when thestuffing came out of couches, and during the war he gave up his car and couldn’tabide friends who bought steaks on the black market. Yet he owned lavish homes,had more servants than most people had rooms, and was carted around in Renaultand Lincoln town cars or Cadillacs. “My parents would have the chauffeur driveus to school,” Doris recalls, “and I was so deeply ashamed that I made him stopbefore the school so no one would realize I was driven by a chauffeur.”37[notes.html#ch6_37a]Even more confusing was his attitude toward religion. He came from adistinguished Jewish family that had been driven out of Spain when Jews wereexpelled in the fifteenth century. His great-grandfather Isaac ben Jacob Bernayswas chief rabbi of Hamburg and a pioneer of modern Orthodox Judaism. His fatherEly founded a neighborhood temple on 139th Street in New York in the 1890s andlater was vice president of Stephen Wise’s esteemed Free Synagogue, whileDoris’s father was legal counsel to B’Nai B’Rith. And Eddie proudly pointed tohis Jewish roots when it served him in business, as when American Tobacco askedhim to kill rumors, that the company was anti-Semitic.But he didn’t believe in religion or God, as he would tell anyone who asked. Hedisdained religion and in 1978 proudly proclaimed that “I’ve never been to atemple for a service. Never.” Like many prosperous German Jews of that era, hewas keenly aware of the social hierarchies that defined old-line German Jews asseveral notches above the more recently arrived, poorer Russian Jews.38[notes.html#ch6_38a] He also believed the wisest course for Jews was to mutetheir differences with Gentiles. “The Jews,” he wrote in 1932, “must educatethemselves to accept an attitude of tolerance toward the non-Jewish world inwhich they live. The pushing and climbing of many over-eager Jews to achieveleadership as a compensation for what they believe is a social inferiority, isunnecessary and unwise.”39 [notes.html#ch6_39a]Such stereotyping and arguments for assimilation were an understandable, if notadmirable, response to an anti-Semitism in 1930s New York that limited thenumber of clients that upwardly mobile Jews like Eddie could secure, the clubsthey could join, and the apartment houses where they could live. They even hadto make sure that fashionable resorts would accept Jews as guests; those thatwouldn’t often signaled it in ads noting they were “convenient to churches.”While much of this prejudice persisted after World War II, the Holocaustinspired many Jews for the first time to stand up for their heritage and takepride in their thriving community of Jewish artists, writers, and intellectuals.Yet Eddie’s notion that being Jewish was a matter of elective association was adeeply held belief rather than a matter of convenience, which is why he held onto it even after the Nazis. He was pleading for people to determine their owndestiny, free from the influence of any group. And it wasn’t just in hiswritings that he made clear his ambivalence about religion. Naming his daughterDoris after his wife—a clear violation of the tradition among Eastern EuropeanJews of not naming children after living relatives—was one more way to tell theworld he wouldn’t be bound by what he regarded as archaic conventions.That approach left Anne uncertain about who she was and what it meant to be aJew. Her sister, Doris, meanwhile, couldn’t understand why Eddie wouldn’tacknowledge the anti-Semitism the girls encountered at their private school. “Itwas a very Waspy atmosphere,” Doris says, “and I mean he was literally blind tothat. It wasn’t that he saw it and ignored it. It would have assaulted his basicbelief that one can be what one wants to be.… This was a man who inventedhimself and figured everybody else had a chance to invent themselves [and tobecome] what they wanted to be. Religion was an impediment because it wasn’tsomething you chose for yourself.”40 [notes.html#ch6_40a]What maddened the girls even more, as children and later as adults, was Eddie’sapproach to gender roles. He preached feminism and pushed his wife to breaksymbolic barriers, but he made all the decisions that counted, including whenthey would move, where the children would attend school, and what theirlifestyle would be. Doris, meanwhile, was expected to handle household matters,managing the staff, rushing home to have lunch with the girls and again to tuckthem in at night, and running their summer homes in the country, where Eddiecame only on weekends—all the while serving as “full and equal partner” at theoffice.And there was more: Eddie flirted with women at work and at parties, arousingsuspicion in his daughters and others that he was doing more than flirting. Hecarried on a lively correspondence with bright, attractive women who called him“Eddie darling” and “sweet Bernaysy,” while at the same time worrying, to thepoint of calling the police, if his wife Doris stayed out late at a moviewithout telling him. Some Sundays he even refused to say where he’d been,teasing the kids, when they persisted, that he’d been to see “Dottie JellyRoll.”It may be, as Doris insisted in her writings, that being married to Eddie gaveher a full and satisfied life, even if it didn’t always live up to her feministideals. She realized how hard Eddie worked. She knew he was helping the familyback in Europe as well as providing so well for his immediate family, and sheknew that it was unusual for a woman of her era to be so deeply involved in herhusband’s career. She also believed she was “conventional looking,” or worse,and, as historian Susan Henry suggests, “that she married so late indicates shemay not have believed she would find a compatible husband at all.”41[notes.html#ch6_41a] This could explain why, as Anne recalls, “when I gotmarried my mother said, ‘I want you to remember something, Anne. When you get ina fight with your husband, he is always right.’”42 [notes.html#ch6_42a]Doris made her position even clearer in her 1955 book: “Eddie’s word is finaland he casts the deciding vote in our partnership. I have elected him Chairmanof the Board and Executive President in our personal life, where he decideswhere we shall live and when we shall diet, and in our public relations officewhere he was boss even before we were married.”43 [notes.html#ch6_43a]Yet there are hints Doris was not as contented as she wanted everyone tobelieve. In a 1949 article she wrote, “Once at a cocktail party, a beautifulwoman attached herself to my husband and after a few minutes of intensepre-symbolic conversation looked indignantly at me as if to say, ‘I saw himfirst—why don’t you scram?’ I did, of course, to my husband’s delight, since hedidn’t want to be saddled with a Mrs.”44 [notes.html#ch6_44a] The tone waslight, part of her explaining how tough it was to keep things straight when shekept her maiden name, but she wasn’t amused by Eddie’s perpetual flirting. Andit may not have been a joke when she warned Anne that “men always sleep withtheir secretaries.”“I think at some point she wanted to leave him, but felt she couldn’t getanother man. Given the times, it was very important not to be manless,” saysAnne, who is intrigued and disturbed enough about her parents’ relationship thatshe’s using it as the basis of a novel “exploring the nature of a marriage inwhich the woman is completely outwardly submissive to a very domineeringhusband, but not necessarily inwardly submissive.”45 [notes.html#ch6_45a]Anne’s older sister recalls a period in the late 1940s when her mother “sat at acard table hour after hour playing solitaire. I knew something was wrong becauseordinarily she and Eddie spent evenings together. It was later that I suspectedhe was having some kind of affair.”46 [notes.html#ch6_46a]A family friend tells a similar tale: “I asked Doris if she ever thought ofleaving him. She said one time she did, shortly after their marriage. She camehome and saw something she didn’t want to see and promptly left. Eddie cameafter her, and that was the end of that.”47 [notes.html#ch6_47a]Doris was surely thinking of her own life and of her children when, in her lateryears, she approached Mary Ann Pires at a party the young PR woman was hosting.“She was very taken with our daughter, who was just two or three at the time,”Pires recalls. “Afterward she said to me, ‘Be certain to keep a balance wherethat little girl is concerned. Be sure not to let her get lost in your busylife.’ I’ve thought about that over and over again.”48 [notes.html#ch6_48a]Eddie did dominate his wife in so many ways, much as he did everyone in hislife. She submitted, at least superficially, to keep her marriage and familyintact. But whatever her reservations, Doris surely meant it when she told aninterviewer in 1980 that “love has been the big thing in my life.”49[notes.html#ch6_49a] Eddie surely meant it, too, when he repeatedly professedhis admiration and love for his wife, whom he lovingly called Da.But did he believe he’d done all he could have, and should have, at home? “Thereis no dichotomy, as in the usual marriage, with the husband the economicprovider; the wife, the homebody,” Eddie wrote in 1975. “To us marriage has beenand is a total living experience in symbiosis.”50 [notes.html#ch6_50a]Privately, however, he conceded that he hadn’t given Doris much help raising thegirls or running the house. In a 1948 letter to his sister Judith he referred tothe milestones he was missing in his children’s lives by remaining behind atwork while they vacationed in Nantucket: “Little Doris is learning to ride abicycle, and I gather that in her excitement of learning, she gets blisters onher hands from holding on to the handle bars so tightly. Anne, I understand, islearning how to play tennis. Big Doris is so bored that, I gather, she worksthree or four hours a day writing a piece on why feminism and a Lucy Stone namehaven’t worked out after twenty-five years.”51 [notes.html#ch6_51a] In hisautobiography he devotes just thirteen of 849 pages to family matters, worryingthat any more would bore readers. Anne and Doris, he added, “were victims of afather who had the current attitude of the male parent in the thirties. He lovedhis children, but wasn’t around much to show his love.”52 [notes.html#ch6_52a]Which, as he acknowledged, was just how things had been with his own parents.* * *How could Doris handle all those responsibilities at home and work, and howcould Eddie, who in many ways was deeply solicitous of his wife, let her do itall? “I don’t think he had a clue as to what it entailed to run a household,”his daughter Doris surmises. “Mother didn’t do any cleaning or cooking or thatsort of stuff, but she did have to oversee the staff.… She did it by beingextremely well organized, very self-disciplined. She’d write out schedules forall the help that they were supposed to follow at fifteen-minute intervals. Shehad a very organized mind. She should have been a scientist.”53[notes.html#ch6_53a]Doris Fleischman Bernays offered a similar answer in her 1955 book. “‘How do youfind time to work at your office, take care of your children and your home, andentertain so much?’ people ask me frequently. It is a simple problem in temporalmathematics,” she wrote with her trademark light touch. “The great trick is toweed out unnecessary activities, and then to divide essentials into twocategories. The first group can be characterized as expendable necessities. Thesecond group or residue can be defined as reducible necessities. These can beshrunken by the application of systems, shortcuts and other technical devices.…If the making of a house were elevated to the status of a science, where itproperly belongs, our houses would be homes instead of careers and we shouldhave more time for the pleasant intangibles of family and community life.”54[notes.html#ch6_54a]Doris’s address book offers a further glimpse into how organized the Bernayshousehold was—and how privileged. There were entries for Bowring Arundel andCompany, their favorite source for men’s shirts, and for Margaret Koehler Gowns,the best place to buy dresses. There were addresses and numbers for a linen andunderwear shop, for Mrs. Herbst’s Pastries and Scandinavian Delicacies, and forFrank Ondra, a furniture refinisher in Long Island City. There were people tosweep the chimney, tune the piano, deliver ice or logs, build cabinets, repairthe stove, air conditioner, and refrigerator, and replace lost or damaged silveror lace. There were even listings—five of them—under “waitresses,” presumably tomake entertaining a bit easier.There was no entry, however, for the one thing Anne and her sister most wantedwhile they were growing up: to have their father around more and to make himmore approachable—which was the same thing Eddie had craved. Eddie tried, takingyoung Doris to an American Home Economics Association convention in Pittsburghand Anne on a trip to Washington and a visit to FBI headquarters. He broughtAnne to the office one day after school and let her try carving a bar of Ivorysoap, as thousands of other children were doing at his prompting. But, as sherecalls, “I immediately cut my finger very badly. I was six years old and notused to cutting. He took me right home, and the doctor came. [The cut] wasreally deep, and my mother was outraged.”55 [notes.html#ch6_55a]It was bad enough that their father was totally occupied with his work, but itwas even worse that he could not accept the choices the girls made. “When I wasin college, a senior, I joined a poetry club. There were six of us; we met witha senior faculty member once a week and learned how to write poetry and turnedout a tiny little book,” recalls Anne, who went on to publish eight works offiction and to coauthor two of nonfiction. “My father said people would just assoon sit on a tack as read poetry. Yes, it was horrible, but I was twenty-onethen, so I shouldn’t have minded so much.”56 [notes.html#ch6_56a]It became even clearer how little Eddie understood his younger daughter when,several years after Anne graduated from Barnard, he and Doris offered to turnover to her their PR business. They truly hoped she’d come to understand andrespect what they did. But Anne didn’t even have to mull the offer over beforeturning it down.If Eddie had spent more time listening to her as she was growing up, he mighthave seen her decision coming. But that never happened, she says. “He couldn’tsit down and say, ‘What are your ideas, Anne?’ If I questioned anything, hewould lose his temper, so I learned to keep my mouth shut. Mother said, ‘Yourfather is always right.’ It was a united front against the kids.”57[notes.html#ch6_57a]Young Doris agrees that her parents never disagreed in front of her or Anne, andthat Eddie got defensive during “ideological disagreements” with his daughters.But she also recalls that he maintained a childlike fascination with life, onceeven buying “dreck candy” from a mom-and-pop store on Third Avenue, eating somehimself, and giving the rest to the kids.58 [notes.html#ch6_58a] What seemedlike paradoxes to others were to him the joys of remaining unpredictable: hesometimes served his dinner guests spaghetti and meatballs and at other timesinvited them to feast on stuffed squab, avocado, and crabmeat at a table setwith Steuben glass and Cartier silver.The one thing he never joked about was his profession. And the older hisdaughters got, the more Eddie brought his Big Think strategies and tactics tobear on them and their families.When Anne got married, Eddie dispatched telegrams to the Associated Press andUnited Press, the Daily News and the New York Times. Which wasn’t surprising,since word of her engagement had been circulated everywhere from Advertising Ageto Variety and Publishers Weekly. And when she was retained on the waiting listat Swarthmore College, Eddie wrote the dean of admissions to thank her, adding,“May I say in passing, as a technician in public relations, that your letter wasan extremely difficult one to write, and a most effective one. Possibly you haveseen the book ‘How to Use Letters in College Public Relations.’ … I havecarefully studied this book but no letter in it quite gets over its points theway yours did.”59 [notes.html#ch6_59a]Young Doris received the same treatment, with Eddie writing to her a year afterher marriage with detailed advice on how to organize her tax records and bankstatements. This wasn’t simply a father tutoring his daughter in life’spracticalities; it was a man applying to his offspring his own obsessions anddrives, his meticulousness and perpetual search for an edge over his opponents.He did all of this with the best of intentions, but with no insight into whethershe or her new husband cared, which was just the way Ely had advised Eddie. “Andthis reminds me, too, about making a will,” Eddie went on in a letter to Doris.“If you don’t want to go to a lawyer, you can go to any stationery store and buyone of the blanks for five cents and fill it out just as you would like to. Butit is highly inadvisable to let matters just go by the board, particularly sinceit means that everything reverts to the state, and your estate may get into thehands of a person who is incompetent and, in addition, doesn’t care.”60[notes.html#ch6_60a]He also advised Doris on how she and her husband should invest their money,whether and what to build on their lot of land, and how to attract patients toher new practice as a therapist. “He couldn’t imagine that I did my work withoutgiving advice,” she says. “He was absolutely sure what I did was sit there andtell people how to live their lives, even though I told him, I don’t know howmany times, that’s not what I did. He couldn’t believe it because that’s how hefelt valued—giving his advice. And if we didn’t take his advice he felt hurtbecause that’s what he had to give.”61 [notes.html#ch6_61a]What she and her sister really wanted growing up, Anne says, “was for our fatherto do what other fathers did. I wanted him to be a doctor or a college presidentor something like that.”62 [notes.html#ch6_62a]"},{"pageContent":"7At the OFFICETo his clients Eddie seemed the epitome of propriety. His uniform was athree-piece suit, a soft-collared white shirt, and black shoes. The style mayhave been a decade out of date, the sleeves a bit longer than a tailor wouldhave tolerated, the waist too tight, and the necktie skewed a few degrees to theright. But the image was always one of decorum, just what one expected from aproper public relations man.If they had walked into his office unannounced, however, they would have seen adecidedly different Eddie—sitting behind a cluttered desk with his tie loosened,his jacket out of sight, and his shoes off. Four or five young staff members,their chairs pulled close, would have been listening to him spew forth a streamof thoughts about peddling Ivory or keeping Luckies number one. With each newidea he’d scratch out a note, wad it up, and toss it on the floor.This image wasn’t one of propriety, but it was every bit as calculated as theone he presented to clients. “By the end there was so much paper it looked likethe floor had snow on it,” recalls one of those young employees, James Parton.“It was a trick to demonstrate all the ideas he was generating.”1[notes.html#ch7_1a]Eddie was also demonstrating that he was the idea man, the star. Staff memberswere limited to supporting roles, listening but seldom responding, all chairs,eyes, and ears zeroed in on Eddie. After all, he was the one who’d landed theclients, and he was responsible for keeping them satisfied. He’d concocted thestrategies and mapped out tactics. He alone knew what it took to get things doneand to pay the bills. As in many offices that revolve around a charismaticpersonality, he gave the orders and surrounded himself with people who werewilling to carry them out. And like others who had launched their own empires,he ruled with an imperial air that sometimes crossed over into meanness.There was a time, in 1921, when Eddie tried taking on a partner, a formermagazine advertising man named J. Mitchel Thorsen. He got equal billing on themasthead, and Eddie assumed his contacts and drive would draw clients to theupstart agency. But Thorsen lasted only about three years, and their partingwasn’t especially amicable. Only two references to Thorsen appear in Eddie’sautobiography. One is a line calling him “the prototype of the manic, euphoricsalesman,” and the other is a kinder word in the Acknowledgments referring toThorsen as one of “the many gifted men and women who have worked with us.”After Thorsen, Eddie hired mainly young staff people, often fresh from college.There could be as many as thirty when several campaigns were gearing up at once,but the number would drop to ten or twelve when the big campaigns ended. Mostwere bright enough to handle any task he tossed their way, even if it was beyondtheir expertise, and hungry enough not to complain about the long hours, themodest salary of about $30 a week, and Eddie’s occasional torrents of temper.Most also were impressionable, and their impressions of Eddie remain vivid.One impression was of Eddie as charismatic personality, the kind who, soon afterhe entered a room, any room, took center stage. It wasn’t his physical presence.He was short and plain, with a paunch that increased over time and that heaccentuated by patting. He also had disconcerting habits like biting his nailsand jiggling his leg. But it didn’t take long for his audience to realize howmuch he knew about almost everything and to understand that he was worthlistening to. It was the same magic that had captivated industrial tycoons, thathad landed him new clients to replace those who left after an economic setbackor too big a dose of Eddie’s boasting, and that had, one special day yearslater, made such an impression on his younger daughter.Eddie, Anne, and her husband, Justin Kaplan, had planned to spend that stickysummer afternoon lounging on a Long Island beach. Instead they found themselvesin a cramped garage off Rockaway Boulevard, in a section of Queens half a stepup from a slum, with no assurance from the mechanic how long it would take himto repair “Cornelia,” their 1954 green Ford convertible. To Anne and Justin theexperience was a misery to be endured; to Eddie it was a chance to make afriend. “Within five minutes my father was sitting on one of those littlefolding chairs next to an elderly woman working at a vegetable stand, having themost animated conversation I had ever seen,” Anne recalled forty years later.“If he had said to this old woman, ‘Come with me, Bertha,’ she would have comeright in the car and left her whole family and the vegetable stand.”2[notes.html#ch7_2a]Walter Wiener, Eddie’s nephew and unofficial chief of staff, has similarrecollections: “If you were in a room with him you’d never say, ‘Who was that?Eddie who?’ You’d say it was Eddie Bernays, because he dominated theconversation.”3 [notes.html#ch7_3a] Part of his charm was drawing others in,making them feel important, says Luther Conant, who worked for Eddie in theearly 1950s. “He could meet a roomful of forty people and be introduced to them,to strangers,” Conant explains. “Then he’d introduce them right back to someoneelse.”4 [notes.html#ch7_4a] Stanley Silverman, another young recruit from thatera, says Eddie still had that knack at his one-hundredth-birthday bash inCambridge: “I hadn’t seen him in forty or fifty years, and he remembered me. Iwas very impressed with that. It wasn’t a PR stunt.”5 [notes.html#ch7_5a]Eddie also had a showman’s side, of course, drawing attention to what he saidwith inflated introductions like “In the interests of truth, accuracy, and fairplay,” or proclaiming, when he was in a fix, “I’m the victim rather than thebeneficiary of my own propaganda.” It was this flair for histrionics thatprompted him to drive around New York in a sleek gray Renault, with thechauffeur sitting out in the cold and Eddie lounging inside, soaking in theenvious gazes of passersby.And there was Eddie as taskmaster—a side of him that his young protégés enduredalmost every day. Sometimes he demonstrated a thoroughness that bordered onobsessiveness, demanding that each of the scores of letters and memos that leftthe office be reviewed by someone other than the author, insisting on beingfilled in on every development, and signing off on every idea. A staff memberwas home recovering from pneumonia? He found take-home work to justify keepingher on the payroll—no matter that she was his younger sister, Hella. Anotherassociate was off getting married? Make sure the three days were deducted fromhis vacation.Eddie demanded excellence and obeisance. When they were forthcoming he seldomgave his staff credit, but when they weren’t he could be unforgiving. Asecretary was fired for typing “pubic” instead of “public” in one of hisspeeches, though it was the speechwriter who mistakenly penciled in “pubic.” JimCaldwell, who later became a Catholic priest, was fired for falling asleep inthe file room. Victor Schiff, who became a star in the Carl Byoir publicrelations agency, was fired and told he wouldn’t get dismissal pay because he’dbeen incompetent and disloyal. Wiener’s secretary was dismissed for refusing toride out to Eddie’s new apartment and take measurements for rugs and curtains.“Eddie had a tough ending with everybody,” says Robert Hutchings, who spent twoyears with the Bernays office in the late 1930s. “I was the only person who everleft moderately happy with him; he kind of liked me. His other relationshipswere very sour, and I never did figure out why.”6 [notes.html#ch7_6a] Parton,who later founded American Heritage magazine, was glad he was fired, because“there was no future there for anybody but Bernays.”7 [notes.html#ch7_7a]Wiener experienced firsthand his uncle’s unyielding side when, after servingwith the Office of Strategic Services during World War II, he turned downEddie’s offer to return to the Bernays agency. Eddie’s response was to end allcontact with his nephew for nearly forty years, refusing even to acknowledge himwhen he bumped into him in Grand Central. He did the same to Conant when heresigned after three years. “Eddie told me if I left he’d never talk to meagain, and he never did,” Conant recalls. “He took my leaving as almost apersonal thing. I remember him saying, ‘You were going to inherit thisbusiness.’ But he just would not pay what seemed to me, even in those years,enough money. These accounts I was working on were paying him $1,000 a week, andI was getting $6,000 a year.”8 [notes.html#ch7_8a]The break was even more jarring with Edmund Whitman, publicity chief at UnitedFruit Company and one of Eddie’s closest friends. Whitman had to pass on wordthat after years of faithful service, Eddie was being terminated by the fruitcompany’s new boss. “Eddie never, ever spoke to Ed Whitman again,” says TomMcCann, who worked closely with the two at United Fruit. “That hurt Whit a lot.Whit thought he had a relationship with Eddie.”9 [notes.html#ch7_9a] AnneBernays recalls that “when Eddie would come home from the office he’d be on thephone for at least an hour every single night with Ed Whitman. They spentvacations together. For years this was his very, very, very closest friend. Butafter that falling-out Whitman’s name was never mentioned in the house. It wasas if he’d never existed.”Marguerite Clark, medical editor at Newsweek, was yet another dear friend whowas in Eddie’s life every day for a while but then suddenly vanished. “There wasone moral error. I don’t know what it was, but he cut her off, too,” says Anne.“With my father it was really all or nothing.”10 [notes.html#ch7_10a]* * *Eddie’s boss man persona was easier to bear for younger employees passingthrough for a year or two. While he worked them hard, he worked even harderhimself, staying at the office until late at night and coming in on weekends.Young staff members learned from a master how this new field of public relationsworked, and some benefited personally from the Big Think advice he was makinglegendary.“I was making about thirty dollars a week—standard in those days for a brightcollege graduate—and I was interested in getting another job somewhere,”remembers Ralph Bugli, who worked for Eddie in 1937. “I had a lead and thoughtI’d be smart by putting together a four-page mini-newspaper that highlighted mycapabilities. I was working in the office surreptitiously one Saturday afternoonafter everyone had gone home, and I didn’t realize Bernays was still around. Hecame in and said, ‘What are you doing?’ I said, ‘I’m looking for a job. I wantto get married and need another five dollars a week.’“He said, ‘You’re doing the right thing, but this isn’t the way to go about it.Don’t do a single thing like this; do it on a multiple basis. And never ask aperson for a job because you need the money; ask for a job because you deserveit.’ He looked at it as if I was his client and he was trying to show me how tocope. And a couple weeks later I got a five-dollar raise.“Bernays,” Bugli adds, “was a formative influence in the lives of all of theseyoung guys who worked for him.”11 [notes.html#ch7_11a]Molly Schuchat was hired just as she was graduating from college to help theBernays office with Thomas Dewey’s presidential campaign. “I was superfluous,”she remembers, “and he was doing one of his usual good turns in hiring me. Isaid I couldn’t start up right away [because] I was going to a Cornell footballgame, and he said, ‘I think we can wait.’”12 [notes.html#ch7_12a] And Elizabethdi Sant’Agnese says that when she worked for Eddie in the mid-1940s, “he evenpaid my salary while I was home pregnant and did nothing.”13[notes.html#ch7_13a]Not all have such fond memories, however.“It was a very good experience for me,” Hutchings says of his two years in theBernays office, “because I never had a boss that bad the rest of my life.” Heconcedes that Eddie was “brilliant,” a “marvelous consultant,” and “greatsalesman,” but says the campaign he worked on for Kelvinator refrigeratorsinvolved “sitting there and thinking up ‘news’ releases. I put ‘news’ inquotes,” he adds, “because there was no news there. I’d send out recipes, butthey were terrible. Every so often I’d write a story somebody would print, butmostly they didn’t print them. I was getting paid thirty bucks a week and waspractically running the whole program.”14 [notes.html#ch7_14a]Others shared that sense that the Bernays office was run largely on smoke andmirrors. They felt that Bernays was like the unassuming little man behind thecurtain in The Wizard of Oz, dazzling his clients not with the magic he promisedbut with ill-informed offerings from his underpaid young staff, all wrapped upin a fancy, high-priced package.The only thing Peter Straus knew about labor issues when Eddie hired him in themid-1940s came from two courses he’d taken in college. But that didn’t stopEddie from putting him to work rewriting the labor handbook for the hugeColumbia Rope Company—or from charging Columbia $5,000 for the “collectiveadvice” of his “labor staff.” “He got a lot out of very junior, underpaid peopleand charged a lot for it. I sort of admired that,” says Straus, who was paid $45a week back then and is now chairman of the board of New York-based StrausCommunications, which runs eight radio stations and five weekly newspapers.15[notes.html#ch7_15a]Cynthia Donnelly had just graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar when she went towork for Eddie in 1939. In that depression climate she was glad to have a job,even as a secretary. Maybe that was why she stayed on despite Eddie’s referringto her as “Little Miss Nitwit.” “All his secretaries were Little Miss Nitwits,”she recalls. “He’d say it not in a kindly way. That was his real evaluation.“Little Miss Nitwit would get in the door, and before I’d have a chance to getmy notebook open he’d be saying, ‘Dear Bill.’ He’d never tell you who Dear Billwas. I’d spend hours in the office after work figuring out who the hell theletters were supposed to go to, and if you asked a question you were likely toget canned. I think he was mean. That was my impression.”16 [notes.html#ch7_16a]A better description might be “mercurial,” as he alternately revealed a generousside and a stingy one. Like many famous men he was insecure, a trait thatmanifested itself in various ways. Feeling he was too short, at 5 feet 4 inches,Eddie seemed determined to make everything else larger than life. He eveninflated his name with an L., a middle initial that was not on his birth recordin Vienna. It apparently stood for Louis, although even his daughters aren’tsure, since he didn’t like to talk about it.Whatever the reasons for his being difficult, so many ex-employees thought hewas that they used to joke about organizing themselves into a club. If they had,it would have been one of the most distinguished public relations associationsof the era. While most staff members didn’t last long and many left angry,almost everyone he hired was smart and talented. Many, like Conant, used whatthey had learned in the Bernays office to launch successful careers in publicrelations. “I certainly recognized I was getting my Ph.D. in public relations,”the retired PR man said. “Eddie was a brilliant man, very brilliant.”17[notes.html#ch7_17a]None of the staff members who left the agency knew much about Eddie as a personor about what drove him professionally. Few lasted long enough to get along-range look, most weren’t wise enough to have formed a considered judgmenteven if they had lasted, and those who had known him first on a social basisfound the party invitations stopped once the professional relationship began.They knew even less about Doris, who arrived at the office later in the day orworked from home, keeping to herself and never letting anyone but Eddie knowabout the vital tasks she was taking on.“We were aware of her,” says Bugli, expressing a consensus among the juniorstaff. “I don’t recall seeing her more than once, although I was aware she wasthere. There was a feeling that Mr. Bernays paid a great deal of attention towhat Mrs. Bernays thought and did.”18 [notes.html#ch7_18a]The frequent office moves almost certainly were Eddie’s idea, much as thechanges in homes had been. He began working from his parents’ house on West106th Street, then in 1919 opened his first office in three rented rooms on thefifth floor of a remodeled house at 19 East Forty-eighth Street. He made do thenwith three golden oak desk chairs, two wooden file cabinets, three typewriters,and a telephone, all purchased for $1,102. His rent was just $255 a month, andhis weekly payroll was $192.50, of which $75 went to his brother-in-law MurrayC. Bernays, a Harvard Law School graduate just back from World War I; $50 to hiswife-to-be, Doris; $30 to a secretary; $25 to a mail clerk; and $12.50 to anoffice boy.Two years later he moved into a corner suite in the new S. W. Straus Companybuilding at Forty-sixth Street and Fifth Avenue. The striking white structureoffered sufficient space for his growing staff, views of downtown and FifthAvenue, and the prestige of being next to the elegant Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Hepulled up stakes again in the 1930s, settling in at the Graybar Building next toGrand Central, then renting offices at One Wall Street, next to the venerableNew York Stock Exchange. In 1942 he moved to 9 Rockefeller Center, and two yearslater he bought a four-story house, which he converted to offices, at 26 EastSixty-fourth Street. While some of the moves were a result of restlessness,others reflected practical considerations such as a decrease in business duringthe early years of World War II.Each office offered its own touch of grace. The one he occupied in 1930 was a“chastely elegant suite,” according to the American Mercury. “Costly etchings,and an occasional modernistic painting, adorn the walls. Beautiful secretariesglide over voluptuous rugs to ask visitors if they have an appointment with themaster of mass psychology.”19 [notes.html#ch7_19a] Printer’s Ink described hisEast Sixty-fourth Street setting as “a chic black-and-white townhouse.… Bernays’book-lined office is on the front parlor floor, furnished with a large oldcumbersome desk and a clutter of papers, mementos, awards and framed letters.Doris Fleischman’s office, one floor above, has not quite as many books butstill a great number. It is all pink but also comfortable.”20[notes.html#ch7_20a]Eddie didn’t spend that much time in the offices, however, as his appointmentcalendars make clear. He was too busy lunching with Helen Reid of the New YorkTribune or Arthur Hays Sulzberger of the New York Times, hosting parties forbig-name clients and people he was courting as clients, and hopping the train toAlbany or Washington, Princeton, Detroit, or California. He’d been superstitiousabout flying ever since a close friend was killed in a plane crash, and hisdefective vision made him leery of driving. While he enjoyed riding the train,he was so busy that he sometimes had to spend part of the trip plottingstrategies with a junior associate, who would disembark at the next stop and hopa train back to New York to put Eddie’s plans into motion.That was one of many tricks Eddie used to save time. He’d hold two telephoneconversations at the same time, one phone to each ear. He’d have his driverclock every possible route from New York to the suburbs, where he spent weekendsduring the summer, and would carve into quarters books he’d agreed to review,handing each quarter to a junior staff member to read and report on. But henever found the time for golf, tennis, handball, or any of the other sports thatexecutives used to release stress, keep fit, and bond with other men.“I knew him from childhood, and I never knew of him doing any regular exercise,”Wiener says. “Eddie was a workaholic. He worked in public relations all hiswaking hours, and his social life was work-related to a large extent. It was hisWeltanschauung, his whole view of the world.”21 [notes.html#ch7_21a]* * *Most of his staff understood that worldview and, at least in hindsight,respected it. Yes, Eddie was self-absorbed and stingy, but he’d taught them alot and, thanks in part to that tutelage, they’d gone on to build the careersthey wanted.But Joseph Freeman was older than the rest when he went to work for Eddie, andhe suffered wrongs he believed were unforgivable.Freeman joined the Bernays firm in 1948, when he was fifty or fifty-one. Hewrote speeches, articles, and manuscripts; stood in for Eddie at socialgatherings; and was a close friend. Freeman left in 1952, forced to retire, hesays, because Eddie was afraid that clients would react adversely to publicityabout Freeman’s political past—a past that included pledging his fealty tosocialism at age seventeen, publishing Marxist literary criticism, editing andwriting for the leftist journals New Masses and the Liberator, serving as NewYork correspondent for Tass, the Soviet news agency, visiting and writing aboutRussia, and participating in the Communist movement here and overseas.Freeman’s frustration, which began while he was working for the Bernays agencyand built into an abiding anger as he believed he was about to be fired, offerdisturbing insights into how Eddie operated. Freeman outlined those grievancesin a stream of letters from the summer of 1951 to the summer of 1952, to afriend identified only as “Floyd.” Freeman died in 1965, but the letters as wellas his other papers are preserved at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution.The letters portray Eddie, whom Freeman calls Mr. Barnes, as the mostinsensitive of bosses. In November 1951 Freeman was reeling from the death ofhis mother, and “when I returned to the office after a week’s absence, themembers of the staff, men and women, were particularly kind to me. Mr. Barnesdid not even see me. He had not phoned or written or wired the week of mymother’s death; now he ignored me completely.… It puzzled me that an adult,presumably civilized man (who is America’s No. 1 expert on public and humanrelations) should act like this at a time like this.… What I most resented aboutMr. Barnes’ silence at this time was that he forced a place for himself by theside of my mother in the sorrow her passing had evoked.” Freeman understoodEddie well enough, however, to know that his approach partly reflected his own“horror of death, not only the approaching death of his own mother, but his owndeath at some unknown point in the future; he never talked about death; the wordwas taboo in his presence.”22 [notes.html#ch7_22a]The letters also paint Eddie as deceptive and greedy. He refused to give hisexecutives a Christmas bonus so he’d have more money for an expensive vacationto Europe, Freeman says. He fired five employees on Christmas Eve, wrote nastyletters to competitors under fictitious names, and failed to credit Freeman forhis contributions to a 374-page book, Public Relations, of which Freeman says hewrote more than half. “Perhaps I should have been mad,” Freeman writes, “but Iwasn’t; I felt more like a physician who has just found one more example of adisease he is studying. I am studying a disease known as envy—and an excessenceon society known as the Robber Baron, the Dictator, or the Predatory Man.”23[notes.html#ch7_23a]Freeman also portrayed Eddie as a hypocrite. In 1952 Harper’s published a bookby a British author containing a footnote saying Freeman still was a member ofthe Communist Party. Freeman and others pointed out that it wasn’t true, andHarper’s and the author apologized. But, as Freeman recounts, Eddie insisted theapologies weren’t enough and that Freeman must sue. “It was clear to me that Iwould either have to sue Harper’s or resign my job,” Freeman writes. “It wasalso clear to me that if I did sue Harper’s, [Eddie] could not possibly keep me;no public relations office can afford to have a writer involved in any kind ofscandal, particularly one in which that horrible, obscene word ‘communism’ isthe main issue. So I resigned.”24 [notes.html#ch7_24a]It wasn’t just the forced resignation that upset Freeman; it was also the way hesays Eddie handled it. First Eddie admitted he had secretly had Freemaninvestigated, apparently by the FBI, when Freeman started working for him. Aweek after the resignation Eddie signed an American Civil Liberties Union adcondemning blacklisting. Then, Freeman writes, Eddie “told Luther—the oneremaining writer—that he loves me, that I have more character and integrity thananyone he has ever met, that it breaks his heart to let me go; but he sent me solittle severance pay that Luther was shocked; and he has not called me or sentme a note or communicated with me—though I call the office every day for mailand messages, and have left word that I am not sore and would be glad to seehim.”25 [notes.html#ch7_25a]Freeman concedes that Eddie was courageous for hiring him in the first place,given his controversial background, and for not bending earlier to the pressureto fire him. He also admits his critiques of Eddie are in part criticisms of thecapitalist system Eddie represented. And it’s impossible to get Eddie’s side ofthe story, because he never offered it in his thousands of pages of writings,letters, and other records. The only mention of Freeman in Eddie’s autobiographyis a note that “Joe Freeman and [his wife] Charmion von Wiegand always enliveneda party. Charmion once brought in Mondrian, the painter, and we delighted inthis simple, quiet man.” Freeman is listed in the Acknowledgments, as one of“many gifted men and women who have worked with us.”Still, Freeman’s portrayal rings true in part because it’s so much like what somany others have said of the Bernays firm and of Eddie’s way of running it. Evenmore troubling than his terminating Freeman, however, was the way he allegedlyused PR tricks to put a positive spin on what he’d done.“After I quit,” Freeman writes, Eddie “sent word to me through his generalmanager that it would be better to give some other reason in public for myresignation. He got me out on a political issue, but wanted me to save his face,to say I had quit to do a book, or to make more money, so he could go on posingas a liberal. And the hell of it is that I am saving his face just that way,because in the current climate of opinion it will do me no good whatsoever toannounce the real reasons for my resignation.… So for the time being I amcompelled to keep silent.… It’s as though a brick wall had fallen on me.”26[notes.html#ch7_26a]* * *The Freeman letters suggest how strained Eddie’s relations often were with hisstaff, and his breaks with old friends like Edmund Whitman and Marguerite Clarkmake clear how difficult it was for him to sustain friendships. So whom did helike and admire, want to see and be seen with?Often it was his powerful clients, people he looked up to for having achievedthe success he aspired to and whose idiosyncrasies he interpreted as brilliance.People like Amadeo Peter Giannini, known as A.P., a onetime vegetable peddlerwho assembled one of America’s preeminent financial institutions, the SanFrancisco-based Bank of America.Eddie went to work for Giannini in 1938, and he loved telling the tale of thebank chairman’s rise to power. “He acted in banking like the aggressive pioneerswho had built the West. He evaluated his actions by expedience, not by moralstandards,” Eddie wrote in his memoirs. “What pleased me was his willingness,his eagerness to reject the conventional and traditional. He had killed the ideathat a banker had to wear a morning coat and top hat to be a banker, thatstuffiness and banking were synonymous. He built his banking business by lendingmoney to householders for the purchase of automobiles, vacuum cleaners, washingmachines and other household appliances, previously an unheard-of activity.”27[notes.html#ch7_27a]The banker’s pioneer spirit and refusal to be bound by orthodoxy were appealingto Eddie because that was how he saw himself, as a PR pioneer smashingconventions as he shaped a new profession. Giannini’s excesses—his “anger,egoism, and possessiveness”—were precisely the concerns that colleagues voicedabout Eddie, and Eddie knew that by condemning them in Giannini he wassuggesting that he himself couldn’t be guilty of such excesses.What Giannini was to banking, Orlando F. Weber was to chemicals, only more so,which made him even more attractive to Eddie. The president of Allied Chemicaland Dye Corporation hired Eddie to help him keep his private business private,despite bids by stockholders and the New York Stock Exchange for him to open up.In the process Eddie got a rare look at this powerful, secretive man, and againhe saw things he envied.Weber, for instance, had a flair for the dramatic. His Rolls Royce had a“special body built high so that he could step in and out without stooping. Hedidn’t want to stoop for anyone or anything.” At work, Weber required that everymemo be checked by the man who wrote it, his immediate superior, and hisimmediate subordinate, on the theory that “three company people know all abouteach letter. If two died, the third would maintain corporate continuity.” Thenthere were the fears Weber and Eddie shared about communism, fears sodeep-seated that Weber wanted stricken from Allied spreadsheets words like“profit,” “interest,” and “surplus,” which were “associated with Karl Marx’s[Das K]apital.”28 [notes.html#ch7_28a]One more thing appealed to Eddie about Weber and Giannini: they respected him.Both men were so egocentric they assumed they had the best answers to anyquestion, but when it came to their public images both deferred to Eddie. Theyalso liked him. And to Eddie, there was nothing better than being judged anequal by men of power and stature."},{"pageContent":"8Going to WARIt was a war in which few shots would be fired but upon which the very safety ofthe free world was said to hang. It was a war where words and symbols were theprimary weapons, and Eddie Bernays was the principal source of ammunition. Andin 1954 Bernays’s arsenal was as well stocked as it would ever be.He had a plan for spying, one that involved putting in place a network of molesand flying in from Egypt a high-powered intelligence expert to survey enemystrengths and vulnerabilities.He had a plan for waging psychological warfare, gathering for his side“authoritative information that will enable it to appraise the personality ofthe key men it has to deal with in order to survive.” And another plan forwooing the press, acting as the eyes and ears of the New York Times, courtingcolumnists like Drew Pearson, making life tough for critical journalists andrallying around friendly ones.He even had a plan for contrasting his godless enemy’s outlook with that ofChristianity on twenty-two vital issues. Under the enemy, for instance, “theideal ruler is the efficient, ruthless tyrant,” whereas for the other side “theideal ruler is Christ, the Good Shepherd, and those having authority from Him,who imitate Him.”All this for an undeclared war waged on behalf of United Fruit, one of America’srichest companies—a war fought in quiet alliance with the U.S. government, onforeign soil, against the elected government of Guatemala. A war that, in themid-1950s when the cold war seemed ready to boil over, was seen by those wagingit as a crusade to keep Moscow from gaining a beachhead 1,000 miles south of NewOrleans.Bernays helped mastermind that war for his fruit company client, drawing on allof the public relations tactics and strategies he’d refined over forty years. Itwas the chance to go to war he’d been denied thirty-five years before, and hewas readier than ever.Historians have written extensively about that propaganda campaign, but theyhave always relied on the sketchy account Bernays provided in his autobiographyand on the limited materials available from the American and Guatemalangovernments, the fruit company, and others. Upon Bernays’s death in 1995,however, the Library of Congress made public fifty-three boxes of his papersconcerning United Fruit. Those documents paint in vivid detail hisbehind-the-scenes maneuvering and show how, in 1954, he helped toppleGuatemala’s left-leaning regime. The papers also offer insights into the foreignpolicies of U.S. corporations and the U.S. diplomatic corps during the turbulent1950s. And they make clear how the United States viewed its Latin neighbors asripe for economic exploitation and political manipulation—and how the propagandawar Bernays waged in Guatemala set the pattern for future U.S.-led campaigns inCuba and, much later, Vietnam.“This whole matter of effective counter-Communist propaganda is not one ofimprovising,” Bernays noted in a 1952 memo to United Fruit’s publicity chief.What was needed, he added, was “the same type of scientific approach that isapplied, let us say, to a problem of fighting a certain plant disease through ascientific method of approach.”1 [notes.html#ch8_1a]* * *Guatemala was not Bernays’s first experiment with the science of foreignaffairs.That came just after the First World War when he was winding up his work withthe Committee on Public Information, where he’d landed after being turned downfor active duty. He was living at home and looking for a new adventure. CarlByoir, a colleague at the CPI, made his search easier by offering him $150 aweek to help the Lithuanian National Council of the United States win Americanrecognition of Lithuania, which had detached itself from Russia and formed arepublic.“I said, ‘Sure, I’d be glad to do it. What is it?’ He said, ‘Well, we’d like youto write stories justifying the validity of this little Baltic nation,’” Bernaysrecalled more than fifty years later. “I thought of a new idea at the time,getting out what we called fillers for the newspapers—stories about four incheslong. They were the same width of column as a newspaper. They were sent topapers throughout the country, and if the newspaper editor, the makeup man, hadto fill a gap, he could use them.”2 [notes.html#ch8_2a] This was yet anotherBernays innovation that became the standard way of doing business, helpingeditors around the world fill empty space and helping PR men promote theirclients.He also tapped his time-tested technique of coming up with stories that appealedto the special interests of certain groups of Americans. He wrote aboutLithuanian music for American music lovers and about Lithuanian theater forAmerican theater buffs. He sought similar links for fans of sports and business,food, clothes, and transportation. “Each story,” he explained, “contained themessage that Lithuania, the little republic on the Baltic, the bulwark againstBolshevism, was carrying on a fight for recognition in accord with the principleof self-determination laid down by President Wilson. This theme would appeal toAmericans’ identification with liberty and freedom.”3 [notes.html#ch8_3a] Itwould also have appealed to Walter Lippmann and Sigmund Freud, Bernays’s tutorsin the use of symbols.Bernays’s strategy worked, albeit slowly. The Senate recognized Lithuania as anindependent state in 1919; formal U.S. recognition came three years later.He got involved with Israel, too. He pretended to have no special bond withthose trying to start a Jewish state, just as he boasted about having severedhis ties to Judaism. But just as he never truly divorced himself from Jewishculture, so he seemed drawn to the land whose heritage he shared. Hisrelationship with Israel wasn’t a formal client-counsel one; it grew out of hissocial relationship with Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann, who later helped foundIsrael and became its first president. On one visit to New York to raise money,Weizmann told Doris Fleischman, “I will make your husband first secretary offoreign affairs of our new country if he will help us.” At least that was howBernays remembered it decades afterward, adding that “Doris reported his offerto me. I expressed my appreciation to him at our next meeting and told him I didnot believe in a religious state. ‘But it will give status to Jews throughoutthe world,’ he insisted, ‘just as a free Ireland has given the Irish status.’ Idid not argue the point, and the nonexistent president of a nonexistent countryaccepted my firm refusal gracefully, passing over the issue to describe hisunrelenting activities in pursuit of his objectives.”4 [notes.html#ch8_4a]More than thirty years later in New York, Bernays met with another famousIsraeli, Golda Meir, then the foreign minister and later the prime minister.“She looked more like a pioneer from our western plains than a foreign ministerof Israel,” he recalled. “She told me of the difficult situation Israel wasfacing in the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip. Secretary of State Dulles wasalways cordial to her, she said, when she visited him to talk about the dangersto Israel, but he always acted like a lawyer and was a dead wall when she triedto get support for Israel from him. He referred her to the United Nations.”That was where Bernays came in. Meir said she needed his help drafting a speechfor the United Nations, one that called attention to the threat Arab states wereposing in the late 1950s. “I urged her to abjure any wailing-wall techniques oremotional appeals to sympathy and to present her case by stressing a commondenominator of interest between herself and her audience,” he remembered. “Shelistened intently and thanked me. When a nonpaying client asks for advice I havefound that since it has not been paid for it is usually not acted on, because itis not considered valuable. But to my surprise, from the papers the day afterher speech, I found that Golda Meir had acted on my advice; she presented hercase just as I outlined it. Her statement received a good reception fromaudience and press and advanced her cause.”And, like Weizmann, Meir supposedly offered him the position of foreignminister, which happened to be her job at the time. “‘Why not take it now, Mr.Bernays?’” he remembered her saying, “‘and I will go back to my old cabinetpost, which was Labor.’” But, he added in his memoirs, “I had no desire for thepost.”5 [notes.html#ch8_5a] Meir, who died in 1978, made no mention of Bernaysor of that offer in her memoirs.His work with the government of India was more formal and longer-lasting, butlike his interaction with Israel it began with dinner-party chitchat. And as hedid with Israel, he cleared his plans with the State Department before agreeingto anything.Tensions between India and the United States were running high when Bernaysentered the picture in the early 1950s. America was upset that India hadn’tjoined the battle against North Korea and against communism in general. Thepeople of India felt that America favored their archenemy, Pakistan, in theconflict over Kashmir and that Americans viewed India as a land of man-eatingtigers and child brides, of cows roaming city streets, untouchables living ingutters, and cobras hypnotized by magic flutes. Bernays offered to help remakethat image—for an annual retainer of $35,000 and another $175,000 in expenses.His campaign was identical to the ones he’d run for Procter and Gamble, AmericanTobacco, and other industrial clients, only this time the front groups,letter-writing operations, and other propaganda tactics were employed in behalfof a country instead of a product. Instead of writing speeches and arrangingbarnstorming tours for the president of Mack Trucks, he was doing it for BenayRayan Sen, Indian ambassador to the United States, and Vijayalakshmi Pandit,Sen’s predecessor and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s sister. Bernays wascharacteristically direct in his advice. To assuage American fears aboutcommunism, for example, he advised Sen to remove from a speech “the two words‘dynamic futurism’ and the word ‘collective’ as applied to aims, for the reasonthat they give a Communist connotation, which of course is not meant.” He urgedthe head of the India Information Bureau to explain to U.S. newspapers thatSocialists, not Communists, were India’s second-biggest political party. He alsorecycled his Lithuania strategy, encouraging Indians to emphasize their Bill ofRights, their battles for public health and education, and other aspects of lifein India that Americans could relate to.Although Congress balked at the nearly $1 billion in aid India wanted, Bernaysfelt that after just a few months the “climate of opinion” had “greatlyimproved.” He also was cementing relations with Ambassador Pandit, writing herflattering letters, and helping her negotiate a deal to publish her biography.His relations with Sen, her successor, were shakier and, as happened with somany clients, soon collapsed completely. The falling-out followed a May 1952visit by the Indian consul general to Herbert Matthews of the New York Times,who’d written an editorial condemning India’s stand on Kashmir. The consul,according to Bernays, “threatened war if the Times did not change its stand.”6[notes.html#ch8_6a] Bernays responded with an angry letter to his Indianemployers. They were equally indignant. And on May 26 he wrote Sen saying he hadno choice but to resign because of “a regrettable tendency on the part of theEmbassy and Consular officials to underestimate American intelligence andintegrity.”7 [notes.html#ch8_7a]Sen got the last word, writing on June 2, “It is, indeed, surprising to hear allthis from a person like yourself who should be aware, perhaps more than anyother American, of the intense desire both of my staff and myself to work forthe betterment of relationships between India and the United States of America.If I may say so, your letter of May 26, 1952, reveals a completemisunderstanding of the attitude of the Indian Embassy and an equally completemisjudgment of our motives. However, it would be pointless to engage in whatmight be an endless controversial argument over these matters.”8[notes.html#ch8_8a]* * *Bernays’s work for the United Fruit Company was less controversial, at least atfirst, when he was preoccupied with peddling bananas.The fruit behemoth had been born over a bottle of rum and had grown into aclassic entrepreneurial success story. In 1870 Lorenzo Dow Baker, skipper of theBoston schooner Telegraph, pulled into Jamaica for a cargo of bamboo and a tasteof the island’s famous distilled alcohol. While he was drinking, a localtradesman came by offering green bananas; Baker bought 160 bunches at 25 cents abunch. Less than two weeks later he resold them in New York for up to $3.25 abunch, a deal so sweet he couldn’t resist doing it again. And again. By 1885,eleven ships were sailing under the banner of the new Boston Fruit Company,bringing to the United States 10 million bunches of bananas a year. United Fruitwas formed in 1899, with assets that included more than 210,000 acres of landacross the Caribbean and Central America, 112 miles of railroad, and so muchpolitical clout that Honduras, Costa Rica, and other countries in the regionbecame known as banana republics. That term reflected North Americans’ disdainfor Latin Americans, whom they regarded as politically and socially backward andeconomically ripe for the picking.The United Fruit Company soon had a kingpin worthy of its swashbuckling history:Samuel Zemurray, better known as Sam the Banana Man. Big and blunt, this Jewishimmigrant from Russia used a blend of cleverness and cunning to buy up abankrupt steamship company and plot the overthrow of the Honduran government, toacquire millions of dollars’ worth of United Fruit stock, and then, convincedthat the company was being mismanaged, to insert himself as head of theBoston-based firm, fully aware how uncomfortable that made its Brahminoverseers. By 1949 Zemurray had built United Fruit into one of America’s biggestand best-run companies, with $54 million in earnings and an empire of railroadsand ships, a reputation for fair treatment of its 83,000 workers in the Tropics,and control of more than half of the U.S. market in imported bananas.But Zemurray was always looking to sell more fruit, especially during thewinter, when frosts made shipment and storage more difficult. That was why, inthe early 1940s, he hired Bernays as his public relations counsel.Bernays showed him that one way to boost sales was to link bananas to goodhealth. Dr. Sidney Haas, a New York pediatrician, had proved years before thatthe tropical fruit helped cure celiac disease, a chronic digestive disorder. Thepublic relations man decided to use a celebration of Haas’s fiftieth anniversaryas a doctor to get out the word that bananas helped digestion. He printed100,000 copies of a thin hardcover book on the topic and mailed them to editors,librarians, dieticians, home economists, pediatricians, and doctors specializingin digestive troubles. And he got United Fruit to sponsor Haas’s research,although there was no mention of its sponsorship in such Haas publications as“The Value of the Banana in the Treatment of Celiac Disease.”Bernays also linked bananas to national defense, a connection less obtuse thanit seems since United Fruit’s “Great White Fleet” was used in both world wars toferry supplies and troops. A 1942 memo outlined his three-part approach todemonstrating “that the maintenance of the banana import trade is basic to theUnited States (a) because it maintains the stability of the Central Americanrepublics, (b) because it provides an economic basis for taking defensematerial, vital to the United States, to the Panama Canal, [and] (c) because itis logical that the boats that take the material there should not come backunloaded, but that they should help to further hemispheric solidarity and theGood Neighbor Policy by bringing loads of bananas to this country.” Thestrategy, he concluded, “is a political, economic, defense, and practical one.”9[notes.html#ch8_9a] In Big Think terms, it amounted to couching his client’sprivate interests behind America’s public interests.On top of that he campaigned to get bananas into hotels, railroad dining cars,airplanes, and steamers; to feed them to professional and college footballteams, summer campers, YMCA and YWCA members, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, andstudents of all ages; to promote them among cake, cookie, ice cream, and candymakers; and to secure a place for them in movie studio cafeterias and attop-of-the-line resorts in places like Palm Beach and Sun Valley.But Bernays was farsighted enough to realize that if United Fruit wanted tocement its position in the North American economy, it had to teach NorthAmericans about their neighbors to the south. The mission wasn’t just to sellbananas, he told Zemurray, but to sell an entire region of the hemisphere. So heset up one of his trademark front groups, the Middle America Information Bureau,which churned out brochures and press releases with titles like “How aboutTomato Lamburgers?” “Okra Is Decorative as well as Delicious,” and “MiddleAmerica in Tomorrow’s America: A Program of Activities for Men’s Civic andSocial Organizations.” The bureau even renamed the region, explaining that“Middle America” was “a rational and timely expansion of the phrase ‘CentralAmerica,’ which by long usage includes only the republics of Guatemala,Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, and the colony of BritishHonduras.” Middle America would include those countries, along with Mexico andthe Caribbean island republics of Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.10[notes.html#ch8_10a]The Middle America Information Bureau was in part an honest attempt to educate,providing scholars, journalists, and others with the latest information about anearby place that most Americans knew almost nothing about. But Bernays noted ina memo to bureau writers and researchers that “all material released by thisoffice must be approved by responsible executives of the United Fruit Company,”and that “in view of the widely known constructive activities of the company,mention of United Fruit will enhance the value of the story to editor andreaders and should be made.”11 [notes.html#ch8_11a] Where did the bureau get itsmaterial on the region? From United Fruit, of course. “I wrote articles, oneafter another. I ground them out, and they were sent to newspapers throughoutthe country,” recalled Samuel Rovner, who went to work for Bernays right aftergraduating from the Columbia University School of Journalism in 1943. “I didn’tknow much about Latin America. I did some research now and then, but for themost part [the articles were] based on material that came from the United FruitCompany.”12 [notes.html#ch8_12a]Even as he was trying to teach North America about Middle America, Bernays urgedUnited Fruit to reform its Latin American operations as a way of proving itcared about the countries in which it was making money. He made sure everyoneknew that Zemurray had restored an ancient Mayan ball court, and he got a stampissued to commemorate the ruins. And when he returned from a monthlongcompany-sponsored trip to Guatemala and Honduras in September 1947, Bernayswrote his fruit company clients a long memo warning them about low worker moraleand substandard living conditions.“Good will of all groups towards fruit company is poor,” he said. “Ignorance,conscious and unconscious distortion by politicos in power or seeking power, byfellow traveler[s] and Communist influences all contribute their part. Guatemalais in a state of transition.… All these situations complicate [the] issue andmake the company vulnerable unless certain things happen. The American embassymight gain more power, or the government and people in authority as well as theliterate [members] of the labor unions might recognize the real public interestand economic values of the Fruit Company.”13 [notes.html#ch8_13a] He doubtedsuch positive changes would happen on their own, however, and suggested a seriesof reforms.His short visit had made him see clearly the simmering troubles that Zemurrayhad missed or chosen to ignore. Native workers had to remove their hats whenAnglo managers rode by, for example, and employees felt they had no chance foradvancement. Those were troubles he knew would negate Zemurray’s good works inbuilding housing, medical facilities, and schools. Yet, as always, Bernaysbelieved most of United’s problems could be resolved through aggressive publicrelations. As had happened when he tried to get Procter and Gamble to addressracism within its ranks, however, even his modest bid for change was too drasticfor his client. “A company does not break with tradition easily,” Bernays wrotenearly twenty years later. “The people in the Tropics were remote from Boston;they produced their banana quotas, and that was what counted. Fruit Companyexecutives in the Tropics were tough characters who had come up through theranks; they were action-related men. What I proposed must have seemed likemollycoddling. I got no reaction to my voluminous report.”14[notes.html#ch8_14a]What he did get, in 1948, was an edict to disband the Middle America InformationBureau. The order came from Thomas D. Cabot, who succeeded the aging Zemurray aspresident when Sam the Banana Man stepped up to chairman of the board. Cabotissued his directive “before he had had a chance to discuss the bureau or itsfunctions,” Bernays recalled. “He could see no relationship between the UnitedFruit Company and a four-eyed fish, a rare species found in a Columbian [sic]lake. We had used the strange fish in our story because those four eyes wouldlead the reader into a description of how citizen farmers of Columbia [sic]cultivated bananas. This fish ended a painstakingly developed and effectiveprogram. But fortunately for the company, the bureau’s work had made a deepimpression on the country.”15 [notes.html#ch8_15a]United Fruit’s shutdown of the information bureau and its refusal to redresswhat Bernays felt were deep-seated problems in its Latin American operationsseemed like compelling reasons for Bernays to terminate his ties to the company.After all, he’d repeatedly admonished his PR colleagues not to representunsavory clients and not to stick around when their advice was ignored. Butleaving United Fruit would have meant giving up annual fees that reportedlyreached $100,000. Instead, he resolved to stay on and work for change from theinside, however slowly that might come.The company eventually did reconsider Bernays’s blueprint for reform, althoughnot until 1956, nine years after he issued it. As Diane K. Stanley wrote in1994, the company, “which by then had experienced major difficulties with itsCentral American laborers, issued an eleven-page memorandum that incorporatedseveral of the principles UFCO’s counsel on public relations had initiallyadvocated.”16 [notes.html#ch8_16a]* * *By the mid-1950s questions of reform, and even of selling bananas, were beingsubsumed by questions of politics for Bernays and his employers at the UnitedFruit Company.Guatemala was a hot spot and had been since 1944, when a mass uprising ended thefourteen-year rule of military strongman General Jorge Ubico Castañeda. JuanJosé Arévalo, a professor living in exile in Argentina, returned home and wasswept into office in 1945 with more than 85 percent of the vote. Arévalo facedoverwhelming obstacles, from 70 percent illiteracy to more than 70 percent ofthe land being held by just 2 percent of the population. But he began to makechanges, introducing a democratic political system, overseeing construction ofnew schools and hospitals, establishing a limited social security network, andgiving workers the right to organize and strike. He also pursued limited landreform and distributed property confiscated from Germans and Nazi sympathizers.And he managed to survive more than two dozen plots to unseat him.In March 1951 Arévalo was succeeded by his defense minister, Jacobo ArbenzGuzmán. Arbenz picked up the pace of change, enacting a modest income tax,upgrading roads and ports, and, most significantly, implementing a plan toredistribute uncultivated lands of large plantations, paying the old owners withgovernment bonds. Between 1952 and 1954 the Arbenz government confiscated andturned over to 100,000 poor families 1.5 million acres—including, in March of1953, some 210,000 acres of United Fruit Company holdings.The fruit company had chosen Guatemala half a century earlier in large partbecause of its cooperative government. That choice had been reinforced over theyears as Guatemalan leaders exempted the company from internal taxation, let itimport goods duty-free, helped it maintain control of the country’s onlyAtlantic seaport and virtually every mile of railroad, and guaranteed thatworkers would earn no more than fifty cents a day. It was a capitalist’s dream.By the time Arévalo took over, United Fruit was Guatemala’s number onelandowner, employer, and exporter.The Arévalo reign raised a red flag for the company. Workers went on strike atits banana plantation and seaport, forcing it for the first time to makeconcessions in a labor contract, and the fruit company was targeted asGuatemala’s most glaring symbol of hated Yankee imperialism. If Arévalo was aportent, Arbenz was the realization of the dreaded prophecy. He wanted to builda highway to the Atlantic to break United Fruit’s stranglehold on inlandtransport, a second port to compete with United’s facilities at Puerto Barrios,and a hydroelectric plant to end the near-monopoly of U.S.-backed powersuppliers. He also wanted to take another 177,000 acres of the fruit company’sland, bringing the total to nearly 400,000 acres. The company would bereimbursed at about $3 an acre. That was what United Fruit said in its taxstatements the fallow land was worth—far less than the $75 an acre it claimedonce the land was expropriated.All of this reinforced alarms Bernays had been sounding since he visited theregion early in the Arévalo regime. He now warned that Guatemala was ripe forrevolution and that the Communists were gaining increasing influence overGuatemala’s leaders. And he counseled the company to scream so loud that theUnited States would step in to check this threat so near its border. Companyofficials were unconvinced at first but Bernays pushed ahead and, as thepolitical situation in Guatemala heated up, he ratcheted up hiscounteroffensive.In March 1951, two years before the Guatemalan land seizures, Bernays wroteUnited Fruit publicity chief Edmund Whitman warning that the Iraniangovernment’s recent seizure of British oil properties set an ominous precedent:“We recommend that immediate steps be undertaken to safeguard American businessinterests in Latin American countries against comparable action there. Newsknows no boundaries today.… To disregard the possibilities of the impact ofevents one upon another is to adopt a head-in-the-sand-ostrich policy.” He urgedthe company to get a top Latin American official to condemn the expropriations,hire a top international attorney to outline “the moral, traditional andhistorical reasons that validate the necessity for outlawing expropriation,” andconvince a top university to convene a conference on how North America shouldrespond to such hostility. Over time, he added, the company should launch amedia blitz “to induce the President and State Department to issue a policypronouncement comparable to the Monroe Doctrine concerning expropriation.”17[notes.html#ch8_17a]In fact, he’d begun planning such a blitz months before, as he told Whitman in aNovember 1950 letter. He had picked out ten widely circulated magazines,including Reader’s Digest, the Saturday Evening Post, and Harper’s, and saideach could be persuaded to run a slightly different story on the brewingGuatemalan crisis much the way they were covering the ongoing battle between therailroads and truckers. “In certain cases, stories would be written by staffmen,” Bernays wrote. “In certain other cases, the magazine might ask us tosupply the story, and we, in turn, would engage a most suitable writer to handlethe matter.”18 [notes.html#ch8_18a]While the United Fruit Company didn’t move as quickly as Bernays wished, it didmove, and articles began appearing in the New York Times, the New York HeraldTribune, the Atlantic Monthly, Time, Newsweek, the New Leader, and otherpublications, all discussing the growing influence of Guatemala’s Communists.The fact that liberal journals like The Nation were also coming around wasespecially satisfying to Bernays, who believed that winning the liberals overwas essential to winning America over.He was pleased but not content. “As a result of many recent articles andeditorials on this situation, a point of high visibility has now beentemporarily achieved in this country as regards the deplorable pro-Communistconditions prevailing there and the potential dangers stemming there from, bothto the United States and the United Fruit Company,” Bernays wrote to Whitman.But “it is an axiom in government and politics that for publicity to beeffective, it should be translated into an action program of platform planks.Words must lead to prompt action.” What did he have in mind? The fruit companyshould think boldly, he wrote, considering, among other things, “(a) a change inpresent U.S. ambassadorial and consular representation, (b) the imposition ofcongressional sanctions in this country against government aid to pro-Communistregimes, (c) U.S. government subsidizing of research by disinterested groupslike the Brookings Institute into various phases of the problem.”19[notes.html#ch8_19a]He was also aware of the clout the New York Times carried with the public andthe press, and he prodded the paper to publish more stories favorable to hisclient. He accomplished this by skillfully exploiting his ties to the publisher,Arthur Hays Sulzberger, who was a relative of Bernays’s wife, Doris. He tried toinfluence the assignment of reporters, ensuring they were sympathetic to hiscause and complaining when they weren’t. He even weighed in on letters to theeditor, writing Sulzberger in the summer of 1951 to complain about a letter theTimes had run on “Guatemala Labor Democracy” written by the artist RockwellKent, who Bernays said “has been a fellow traveler over a period of years, whichwould appear to label the letter as covert propaganda of the Party.”20[notes.html#ch8_20a]“Propaganda” was a word Bernays seldom used in a pejorative sense. Andpropaganda was precisely what he was promoting with the press here and abroad,pushing sympathetic publications to print sympathetic stories, then urging themto mail the stories to colleagues in the hope of getting even more such stories.He wrote, for example, to Whitman about his work with the Havana Herald: “We aretaking the editorial submitted to us and rewriting it for submission to you.After your okay, we understand you will submit it to Mr. Schuyler in Havana. Hewill receive instructions from you on how to handle the situation, with a viewof its insertion in the HH. He will also endeavor to make arrangements with theeditor or publisher to send a reprint of the editorial after it has beencompleted, with a letter from the editor or publisher to editors and publishersin this country.”21 [notes.html#ch8_21a]A surprising number of respected reporters seemed not to know or care about thatorchestration or about the fact that Bernays worked for a firm with hugeeconomic interests at stake. What mattered was that his releases were filledwith facts they could quickly transform into stories. Some journalists evenforged personal bonds with him and began sharing information they’d collected.New York Times reporter Will Lissner offered Bernays this friendly advice: “Inotice a somewhat unusual pre-occupation with the affairs of the United FruitCo. in the Communist press. Note the two clippings enclosed. There were severalother references in the period. I shall watch to see how the Moscow presshandles these dispatches.”22 [notes.html#ch8_22a] Bernays informed Whitman of aneven friendlier talk he’d supposedly had with Lissner, saying, “Mr. Lissnerpointed out that he believed it was only the strong and offensive strategy onthe part of United Fruit that made the Guatemalans buckle down. He analyzed thisstrength as follows: First, the strength displayed in negotiation. Second, thestrength manifested through the pitiless publicity focussed [sic] on thesituation in the United States, which in turn had its reaction in the attitudedisplayed by the Guatemalan government of compromise.”23 [notes.html#ch8_23a]Columnist Walter Winchell was someone else the PR man felt he could count on. Hecabled Winchell at Hollywood’s Beverly Wilshire Hotel, telling him about aManhattan rally that Paul Robeson, Florentine Luis, and other prominent leftistswere planning “in defense of Guatemala.” “You may care to deflate in your Sundaybroadcast suggesting rally might discuss false accusations against United Statesmade by Communists,” the cable said.24 [notes.html#ch8_24a] Just how secureUnited Fruit was about Winchell’s support became clear nine days later whenWhitman wrote Bernays expressing doubts about columnist Drew Pearson andsuggesting that “if we decided to try to straighten him out, perhaps WalterWinchell could do this job. What do you think?”25 [notes.html#ch8_25a]Reporters and columnists weren’t the only ones willing to see the Tropicsthrough Bernays’s lens. In January 1952 he took a group of journalists on atwo-week tour of the region. With him were the publishers of Newsweek, theCincinnati Enquirer, the Nashville Banner, and the New Orleans Item; acontributing editor from Time; the foreign editor of Scripps-Howard; andhigh-ranking officials from the United Press, the San Francisco Chronicle, theMiami Herald, and the Christian Science Monitor. Bernays insisted in his memoirsthat the journalists were free “to go where they wanted, talk to whomever theywanted, and report their findings freely,”26 [notes.html#ch8_26a] and he reactedangrily to suggestions in later years that the trip was manipulative. But ThomasMcCann, who in the 1950s was a young public relations official with UnitedFruit, wrote in his memoirs that that trip and others like it were “under theCompany’s careful guidance and, of course, at company expense.… The trips wereostensibly to gather information, but what the press would hear and see wascarefully staged and regulated by the host. The plan represented a seriousattempt to compromise objectivity. Moreover, it was a compromise implicit in theinvitation—only underscored by Bernays’ and the Company’s repeated claims to thecontrary.”27 [notes.html#ch8_27a]Both are right, at least in part. The editors involved were too sophisticated tobe taken in by overt propaganda and too seasoned not to insist on seeing thingsfor themselves, as Bernays suggested. Yet his own memos make clear that he usedall of his PR wiles to make sure those editors came away concurring with UnitedFruit’s stand on the conflict. Compromising objectivity, after all, was what hedid for a living.By whatever route he got there, the results of his trips to the Tropics werebeyond dispute: more and more stories sounding an alarm about Guatemala. AsBernays recalled of the editors and publishers who traveled with him, “aftertheir return, as I had anticipated, public interest in the Caribbean skyrocketedin this country. Ludwell Denny’s stories in the Scripps-Howard newspapers toldof efforts in Guatemala to ‘engender hatred of Yankee monopoly capital andimperialism.’ “28 [notes.html#ch8_28a]Few of the reporters and editors who covered Guatemala are still alive, butthose who are say Bernays won them over through a low-key presentation of thefacts. “He did keep in touch with the foreign desk of the Times and with meduring a good part of that period,” remembers Morton Yarmon, an editor on theNew York Times foreign desk from 1952 to 1960. “He was trying to find out whatwas happening. I’m sure he had his own agenda, but he never said, ‘I want you totell me what’s happening because of such and such.’ It was a subtle and kind ofeven-handed approach.… His name carried weight all by itself, Bernays was a namepeople in the field like myself would be impressed with. You might even say Iwas flattered to have Bernays calling up every so often to ask questions.”29[notes.html#ch8_29a]Lissner says he’s heard the claim that “Bernays exaggerated the situation, butthere was no exaggeration. They say he was setting up trips to take reporters toGuatemala, and he did that, but he never actually attempted to tell them whatthey would find.… He felt if the press saw what was going on in Guatemala theywould write about it. The notion that you can dupe reporters amuses me.”30[notes.html#ch8_30a]Sidney Gruson, a Times writer who was more skeptical of Bernays’s warnings aboutcommunism, says the public relations man “never tried to interfere with me. Hesort of gave up on me before he started trying.”31 [notes.html#ch8_31a] AndHerbert Matthews, probably the most skeptical of New York Times reporterscovering the Tropics, informed Bernays that “I did not admire United Fruit’sprevious record in Guatemala or some of the things they were doing in the 1950s,but they had legitimate grievances and a legitimate story and I could always getthem honestly and straight from the Bernays office. A public relationsrepresentative, as Eddie Bernays always knew, had a value to others to thedegree that he played straight. One deliberately false move and the connectionbecomes valueless to the person seeking information. Eddie Bernays never madeone and never, so far as I could tell, presumed on the friendship that blossomedbetween our two families.”32 [notes.html#ch8_32a]Bernays must have delighted in those tributes. Subtlety was something he strovefor but too seldom achieved, as his center-stage efforts in campaigns likeLight’s Golden Jubilee made clear. Playing it straight was also something hetalked about, but it was tough to do, for a man who was so good atpropagandizing. Here, in what may have been his boldest bid ever to orchestratepress coverage, he managed to win over the reporters while convincing them hewas merely an honest broker of facts.* * *Bernays was gaining ground with the press, but like a relentless general, witheach step forward he became more determined to press ahead.In March 1952, for instance, Guatemala offered United Fruit the labor contractit had long sought. While company officials saw that as a major triumph, Bernaysinsisted it was a “tactical retreat” by the Communists and “does not mean in anysense that their power has been eliminated.” The appropriate response, he addedin a letter to company president Kenneth H. Redmond, would be “to carry forwardthe strong aggressive tactics of the United Fruit Company in pointing the fingerat Communism in Guatemala.… One other element it seems to me is important,too—that is, that the people of the United States be not permitted to get theimpression that all the hue and cry about Guatemala was raised in terms ofself-interest. It becomes necessary, therefore, to continue to make visible tothe American people what the Communist penetration of Guatemala really is.”33[notes.html#ch8_33a]In letters to Whitman over the next two years he spelled out the “aggressivetactics” he had in mind. In retrospect, it’s clear that those tacticsconstituted a major escalation in the war of words between the Guatemalan regimeand the evolving alliance of the fruit company, key U.S. officials, and othercritics of the government in Guatemala.One way to strike out at the regime would be to issue the “first book onCommunist propaganda,” Bernays wrote to Whitman. The manual, he explained, wouldgive fruit company executives “the intricate picture of Communist philosophy andpropaganda that they are dealing with” and outline the “scientific method ofapproach” needed to fight back.34 [notes.html#ch8_34a]The next month he proposed hiring Leigh White, “an outstanding investigatingexpert” working in Egypt, to undertake a “private intelligence survey” of the“political and ideological situation” in Guatemala.35 [notes.html#ch8_35a] Thatwas the first in a series of references by Bernays to a network of intelligenceagents, spies of sorts, that he helped to set up in the Tropics to becoordinated by “the company’s ‘state department.’ “While it’s unclear whetherWhite joined up, Bernays’s memos to Whitman and to newspaper executives suggestthe network did supply valuable information. In a March 1954 letter to New YorkTimes foreign editor Emanuel Freedman, Bernays said an “authoritative source”had warned him that the Guatemalan government was preparing to stage a phonyplot to justify a crackdown on critics.36 [notes.html#ch8_36a] And in a Mayletter to David Sentner of the International News Service he said weapons werebeing funneled from the Moscow embassy in Mexico City to “Guatemalan reds,”adding that the information is “not for attribution” and that some of it camefrom “a very responsible correspondent of ours in Guatemala City” while the restwas from “an equally responsible gentleman in Honduras.”37 [notes.html#ch8_37a]Only select journalists—those on what Bernays called his “confidential list ofapproximately one hundred special writers interested in Latin America”—receivedsuch sensitive information. In an April 1954 letter to Bernays, Whitman said hehad learned from a United Fruit vice president, Almyr Bump, about anotherwriter, Paul Jenkins, and “if his writings bear out Bump’s belief that he is a‘sound citizen’ and if we find him to be a champion of the private enterprisesystem and anti-communism in Guatemala, etc., then we might want to ask himwhether he would care to receive our confidential material.”38[notes.html#ch8_38a]In June 1952 Bernays broached the topic of psychological warfare, something he’dbeen pushing since World War I. He presented to United Fruit boss SamuelZemurray his plan for “psychological activities aimed at developing a betterclimate of public opinions.” Zemurray, Bernays wrote, “recognized that it couldnot prevent certain situations from arising, but certainly that it should becarried on as a possible insurance against them arising, or as possiblymodifying their negative impact on the company.” History suggested how valuablesuch information could be, Bernays argued, writing that “studies of the Nazicriminals by psychologists, the studies psychiatrists make of court cases afterthe criminal has been sentenced, would indicate that had previous knowledge beenhad of the situation, one might have coped much more effectively.” What kind ofinformation did he have in mind? He spelled that out, too, writing that hewanted “information about the cultural background of the individual, his familybackground, his early upbringing, his education, development of career and alook at the various incidents and activities in his life that might shed lighton his personality.”39 [notes.html#ch8_39a]He also wanted to reestablish the Middle America Information Bureau and to hireNicholas DeWitt, a scholar from Harvard’s Russian Research Center, to do ananalysis that would “enable us, if possible, to show the parallelism in thethinking of Guatemalan Communist leaders and the thinking of Marxist or Sovietleaders.” DeWitt responded by letter, saying, “It seems to me that this entiresubject is a very sensitive one. In view of this, I would like to know at theoutset for which purposes and in what form you are planning to use my findings.”Bernays wrote back that “if you do not care to have your name associated withthis study, we shall, of course, be delighted to keep it confidential.” DeWittis dead, and Harvard colleagues say they aren’t sure whether he performed therequested study, but Bernays’s files make clear that someone did. Atwenty-five-page “content analysis” reviewed nearly 17,000 words spoken byGuatemala’s leaders and compared them to statements of Soviet leaders,concluding that there was substantial overlap on matters like how the UnitedStates was perceived. In the Guatemalan speeches, the report said, “every itemmentioned in almost verbatim form is frequently found in Soviet propagandamessages.”40 [notes.html#ch8_40a]Even as he pushed ahead on other fronts, Bernays always kept a close eye on hispress and other propaganda contacts, which he and United Fruit saw as his mosteffective weapons. In April 1954 he wrote to the Saturday Evening Postcomplimenting it on an article about communism in Latin America and offering toprovide—”at no expense, of course”—lists of those who might want reprints,including members of the House and Senate Foreign Relations Committees, the “onehundred special writers,” and key officials at the Central Intelligence Agency,the State Department, and the Defense Department. “We also believe,” Bernayswrote, “we can be helpful in possibly arranging for some member of Congress toreprint the article, in whole or in part, in the Congressional Record, with apossibility of mailings from the Congressional Record to a larger list ofopinion molders and group leaders.”41 [notes.html#ch8_41a] At the same time,plans were under way to mail to American Legion posts and auxiliaries 300,000copies of a brochure entitled “Communism in Guatemala—22 Facts.”Bernays’s schedule for May 1954 reflects the frenetic pace of his activitiesconcerning Guatemala and of the close ties he’d forged with the New York Times.On May 1 he talked to Freedman, the Times foreign editor. Two days later hespoke to Yarmon, on the Times foreign desk, and two days after that he talkedagain with Freedman. On May 6 he called Freedman and “supplied him withadditional information” and spoke with Lissner. The next day he spoke withLissner twice “regarding Honduras. Passed information on to Mr. Whitman.”Bernays was in contact with the Times at least once a day nearly every day, alsofinding time to talk to journalists at the Associated Press, Meet the Press, theNew York Herald Tribune, and other influential media outlets.Events in Guatemala, meanwhile, were firing up. The Eisenhower administration,which assumed office in 1953, stepped up the pressure on Arbenz. The Guatemalanpresident responded by hardening his stance, and month by month the situationedged toward confrontation. The final showdown began on June 18, 1954, whenCarlos Castillo Armas, an army officer living in exile, crossed the border fromHonduras with two hundred men recruited and trained by the CIA—a band Bernaysreferred to as an “army of liberation.” This “invasion,” supported by a CIA airattack, quickly achieved its goal, and on June 27 a military junta took controlof Guatemala. Armas was named president a week later.How much of a role did Bernays play in undermining the Arbenz government and inthe final assault?His Library of Congress files show he remained a key source of information forthe press, especially the liberal press, right through the takeover. In fact, asthe invasion was commencing on June 18, his papers indicate he was giving the“first news anyone received on the situation” to the Associated Press, UnitedPress, the International News Service, and the New York Times, with contactsintensifying over the next several days.Bernays wasn’t the only one pressing United’s case, of course. The fruit companyhad powerful friends in the Eisenhower administration, including Secretary ofState John Foster Dulles, whose law firm had represented United Fruit innegotiations with Guatemala’s former strongman and had served as counsel for thecompany’s railroad subsidiary in Guatemala. Assistant Secretary of State forLatin American Affairs John M. Cabot, whose brother Tom briefly was United’spresident, was another friend. United Fruit also had influential allies inCongress, including Representative John McCormack, who later became Speaker, andSenator Henry Cabot Lodge, whom Eisenhower named ambassador to the UnitedNations. Just to be sure, the company hired Washington lobbyist Thomas G. “Tommythe Cork” Corcoran, one of President Franklin Roosevelt’s brain trusters, andtwo other public relations experts—John Clements, a powerful conservative, andSpruille Braden, Truman’s assistant secretary of state for Latin America.And United wasn’t the only one pressing for intervention. Senator Joseph R.McCarthy had launched his search for subversives, the cold war was heating up,and conservatives in Congress and the Eisenhower administration were anxious totake on an apparent Red push in their own hemisphere. Many liberals, afraid ofbeing labeled appeasers, remained silent or joined in sounding the alarm. Onewriter concluded that “cold war paranoia and sheer ignorance were more powerfulthan all the manipulations of Edward Bernays and other skillful minions in thepay of United Fruit.”42 [notes.html#ch8_42a]Some of Bernays’s lower-level colleagues at the fruit company, meanwhile,resented his lack of hands-on work and wondered how much he accomplished fromhis perch in faraway Manhattan. “He was what you might call a philosophicaladviser during the Guatemalan revolution,” says Gale Wallace, who back then wasdoing PR work for United Fruit based in Latin America. “We didn’t think much ofhis operation; it was long-distance.… We were the soldiers, not the people whosat around in the background and dreamed about what to do.”43[notes.html#ch8_43a]But most analysts agree that United Fruit was the most important force intoppling Arbenz and that Bernays was the fruit company’s most effectivepropagandist. “By early 1954, Bernays’s carefully planned campaign had createdan atmosphere of deep suspicion and fear in the United States about the natureand intentions of the Guatemalan government,” according to the authors of onebook about these events. “In the publicity battle between the Fruit Company andthe Arbenz government, Bernays outmaneuvered, outplanned and outspent theGuatemalans. He was far ahead of them in technique, experience and politicalcontacts.”44 [notes.html#ch8_44a] Herbert Matthews, who’d covered the story forthe New York Times, agreed that propaganda was the key ingredient in underminingthe Guatemalans. “A hostile and ill-informed American press helped to create anemotional public opinion,” he wrote. “This, in turn, worked on Congress and,ultimately, on the State Department. Other factors were, of course, at work inGuatemala, but the American attitude would, by itself, have had the effect ofstrengthening the Guatemalan Reds and making a United States reactioninevitable.”45 [notes.html#ch8_45a]Thomas McCann, the young United Fruit Company PR man, had an even better view ofwhat Bernays was doing and how it influenced events. “My estimate is we werespending in excess of $100,000 a year for Edward L. Bernays, just for hisconsulting services, which was an enormous amount of money in 1952,” McCannrecalled. “And everybody in the company hated him, didn’t trust him, didn’t likehis politics, didn’t like his fees.… The company execs here in Boston and in theTropics were negative on Bernays because they wanted to do business in the sameold way, to foment a revolution and get Arbenz the hell out of there.“But my sense is we were getting our money’s worth, very definitely. I joinedthe company in ‘52, just about the time Arbenz made his big move to expropriateour land, and I saw a complete turnaround in the reportage as a result of whatEddie did.… There is absolutely no question that Bernays played a significantrole in changing public opinion on Guatemala. He did it through manipulation ofthe press. He was very, very good at that until the day he died.”46[notes.html#ch8_46a]McCann wasn’t the only one who recognized the explosive potential of Bernays’sformula: add a wealthy and self-interested private sponsor to sympathetic U.S.operatives, then let a masterful propagandist stir the pot by firing up publicopinion, and even toppling foreign governments seemed possible. Or so it seemedto policy makers who would repeat the recipe in Cuba, Nicaragua, and elsewhereacross Latin America and around the globe.* * *Bernays’s war against communism in the Tropics didn’t end with the toppling ofthe Arbenz regime.Less than two weeks after Armas took over, Bernays wrote to Whitman about waysto build goodwill with the Guatemalan people. He suggested starting a touristinformation bureau, sending down a senior medical officer, encouraging U.S.students learning Spanish to write to students in Guatemala, getting theRockefeller Foundation to fund disease-fighting programs, and sponsoringpostgraduate programs for Guatemalan physicians. Those efforts, Bernaysexplained, would help generate “goodwill with the people of Guatemala at thistime with due reference to the United Fruit Company getting a share of thecredit.”47 [notes.html#ch8_47a]In 1955 he renewed his efforts to get the New York Times to write about theregion, “exploring further the Communist and other plots against CentralAmerican governments, with a view of exposing them to public view in the Timesand thus focusing national and international attention upon these plots whichwould help, we believe, to nip them in the bud.” And he arranged a two-week tripto Guatemala for Emanuel Freedman, the foreign editor.48 [notes.html#ch8_48a]Bernays also did all he could to ensure the success of the Armas regime,suggesting that the new president hold a press conference in early 1955, duringwhich, “backed up with facts and figures, he indicates that the economic plightof his country is due to the fact that the previous regime filched x-millionsfrom the treasury which would have been used for such-and-such purposes.” Thesame themes reemerged later that year, when Armas visited the United States in abid to reverse the growing perception of him as repressive and possibly corrupt.“The United Fruit Company man in Guatemala tipped us off as to the questions[Armas] wanted asked at press conferences,” Bernays recounted in his memoirs.“He wanted to blame the economic plight of Guatemala on the Communists and tosuggest that an economic expert from the United States go to Guatemala and makean independent investigation which would show [that] the devil was Communism.”49[notes.html#ch8_49a]And in 1956 Bernays came up with the idea of widely disseminating a comparisonof the teachings of the Communists with those of the church. “Hate is thedriving force of communism,” the report concluded, whereas “charity is theimpelling motive of Christianity.” And under communism “there is no moral law”and “no personal liberty,” whereas in Christianity “the moral law is the waywhich man is created to follow” and “free will means liberty is possible, theliberty of the sons of God to do the right.”50 [notes.html#ch8_50a]Bernays served United Fruit on other fronts as well, such as when the JusticeDepartment filed a civil antitrust suit accusing the company of trying tocontrol banana supplies and prices in the United States and the Tropics. Companyofficials felt the suit was a bid by the Eisenhower administration to appeasecritics of the Arbenz overthrow and show that the administration wasn’t a puppetof the fruit company. Bernays responded with an inspired campaign. According toMcCann, “A series of ‘strange coincidence’ editorials began to appear innewspapers throughout the country, all questioning why the same government thathad received so much help in fighting the ‘Red Menace’ in Guatemala wouldsuddenly act against its patriotic friend, United Fruit. The year 1954 was nearthe peak of the McCarthy era, and it was easy to sell the nation the idea thatcommunist infiltration in Washington was so widespread, particularly in theDepartment of Justice, that the antitrust suit was a way for the Kremlin tostrike back.”51 [notes.html#ch8_51a]Bernays’s passion for United Fruit subsided only when the company told him,apparently early in 1959, that his services were no longer needed. The newpresident of the company, he wrote later, “had issued an across-the-board orderdeclaring that all advisers of the company were to go. Castro’s expropriation ofthe company acreage and a resulting decline in profits and dividends werepresumably the reasons for this drastic pulling in.”52 [notes.html#ch8_52a]Historians still debate whether or not Bernays and his allies were right inperceiving a Communist threat in Guatemala serious enough to justifyU.S.-supported intervention. Some point to CIA documents as confirming theCommunists’ tightening grip on the country, and insist that without interventionGuatemala would have “gone Red,” as did Cuba and, much later, Nicaragua. Moreagree with Herbert Matthews, who concluded that Arbenz and his followers “wereliberal, radical, nationalistic but not, in those early stages, pro-Communist.They were simply tolerant of the Reds. The Communists worked cleverly; theAmericans stupidly. We put ourselves in the position of opposing social reforms,leaving the field to the Reds.”53 [notes.html#ch8_53a] As for Cuba, McCannwrote, the atmosphere of self-doubt created in the United States by our actionsin Guatemala meant that “when a real Communist threat actually did appear threeor four years later in Cuba, the American public and some members of the presswere unwilling to believe the truth.”54 [notes.html#ch8_54a]To Bernays, the threat was as real in Guatemala as in Cuba. “Nor have I doubts,”he wrote a decade later, “that the Communists wanted to take over Guatemala as abeachhead on this continent.” He was less sure, however, about his claims thatthe regime he helped depose was a puppet of Moscow. “It is difficult to know—andeven the experts disagree—whether these trends and events were directed byRussian Communists or whether they took advantage and accelerated what wouldhave taken place anyway,” he wrote in his memoirs. “I thought then such eventswere Communist-furthered, but whether or not they were, they had a deep,upsetting effect and posed a threat.”55 [notes.html#ch8_55a]Most Americans involved in the Guatemala episode, on both sides, managed to putit behind them, but Bernays never could. Each time a book came out questioninghis role, he had to answer back, reopening old debates and old wounds—just as hehad done with the debates over the post-World War I peace talks and his roleswith American Tobacco and Light’s Golden Jubilee.That was especially apparent when Thomas McCann’s book, An American Company, waspublished in 1976. It accused Bernays of orchestrating the anti-Americademonstration that took place during Arthur Hays Sulzberger’s visit to Guatemalain 1949, and which helped convince the New York Times publisher that his papershould explore the troubles there. McCann also charged that Bernays hadmanipulated other publishers and editors he took to the region.Bernays, who was eighty-four at the time, was furious. He wrote to Crown,McCann’s publisher, warning that “in the interests of accuracy and truth andfair play and in your own interests as a publisher, I must point out certainstatements in the book which are neither objective or factual, and which maywell create embarrassment for you as a publisher.… The Communist menance [sic]in Guatemala was real and not concocted. Historians and competent and respectedeyewitnesses of the situation will attest to that.”56 [notes.html#ch8_56a]His outrage was partly personal. Bernays felt he had helped McCann get his startand treated him like a son. The young PR man’s criticism represented theultimate betrayal. McCann was equally angry and hurt as he sought to understandBernays’s reaction. “I think he was unhappy because I didn’t say to him, ‘I havea contract to write a book on the United Fruit Company.’ He got blindsided onthis,” McCann explained a year after Bernays died. “As soon as he saw the bookwas going forward and Crown was printing a substantial number of copies andputting a substantial advertising and promotion budget behind it, he started aletter-writing campaign to all the book reviewers in the country. He said [mybook] was full of lies and that his lawyers were looking at this, that for [thereviewers] to report on any of the things I’d said about him [might] constitutea libel action against the reviewer, the paper; he was going to sue everybody.…I wrote a letter to Eddie and said, ‘I’ve seen your letter. It has got to stop,and if it doesn’t, I’ll refer it to my attorney.’“That ultimately shut him up.… But every time my name was mentioned aroundBernays he’d just go into orbit. He’d say I’m the worst character—immoral,inaccurate, stupid.”57 [notes.html#ch8_57a]Bernays’s venom rose out of more than just wounded pride. He cared deeply abouthis legacy as a liberal who was anti-Communist but not paranoid like theMcCarthyites. The McCann book, to him, represented the unfair rethinking ofcommunism that was then under way in America, applying contemporary values to avery different setting to conclude we’d overestimated the threat and gonefurther than necessary in places like Guatemala. Worst of all for Bernays,McCann was suggesting that the PR man, rather than having been in control, hadbeen a patsy for the United Fruit Company and for anti-Communists in the U.S.government.Feeling wronged, Bernays reacted as he always did, by striking out, using hiscontacts in the press and publishing worlds to hit back as hard as he could.* * *It’s not often that figures who play a part in history get a chance to revisitcontroversies that have plagued them the way Guatemala did Bernays. But he did,in 1961. The setting this time was South Vietnam, and at first, his historyseemed to be repeating itself.He was advising a New York advertising agency that was working for thegovernment of South Vietnam just as America was ratcheting up its involvementthere. And his advice included precisely the sort of propaganda he’d engineeredon behalf of Guatemala and, before that, India, complete with a South VietnamInformation Center, endless fact sheets to “give the readers a picture of thecountry—geographic, economic, educational, ideological,” and symbol-ladenphrases to “identify the country in the minds of the listener or reader. Hereare some possible suggestions that might serve as a basis for furtherexploration and discussion: ‘the bulwark against Communism in Southeast Asia,’‘the little republic in Southeast Asia standing up against Chinese Communisticinfiltration,’ ‘the hard core of resistance against Communism in SoutheastAsia.’”58 [notes.html#ch8_58a]Bernays’s special expertise here, as in all his foreign assignments, washandling the press. He had plans for extracting favorable coverage from theSaturday Evening Post, Foreign Affairs, the Atlantic Monthly, and Life. He alsoknew what to do with TV. On July 19, 1961, he wrote David Brinkley, then withNBC, saying, “The thought has occurred to us that in connection with yourforthcoming program you might care to visit South Vietnam, the Republic inSoutheast Asia now fighting back Communist infiltration. If you are interested Ifeel sure the government of South Vietnam would open its facilities and doeverything it could to expedite your visit. As you know, South Vietnam is verymuch in the news today and is regarded as the pivotal state of the free world inthat part of the hemisphere.”59 [notes.html#ch8_59a]It’s unclear just how long he continued providing such advice, but it wasn’tlong, and by 1970—at the height of the antiwar movement—he had switched sides,actually proposing to write a paperback book “aimed at men and women interestedin having a manual on the how to of organizing public support for politicalaction at every level to stop the war in Indochina.”Why the switch? Public opinion in the United States was turning around onVietnam, and Bernays, a master at reading public attitudes, appreciated soonerthan most establishment figures how deep-seated the antiwar sentiment was. Andthis time he’d resolved not to be caught on the unpopular side of history.So, even as he continued to defend what he’d done in Guatemala, he was offeringto put all his insider’s know-how to work to stop this latest crusade againstcommunism. “Today, unfortunately, many groups and individuals have had little orno experience with what we call the engineering of consent in a democracy,” hewrote in his book proposal. “Many proceed as if no one had even plotted orplatted the field before. They act more as if they were carrying out a catharsisand carrying out an effort to identify themselves with this activity, than touse sound proven procedures of communication, public education and publicpersuasion.… The book will attempt to bridge the present gap and to harnessenthusiasm, dedication and time to sound methodology.”No matter that he was seventy-eight years old or that few in the antiwarmovement knew or cared about all he’d seen, done, and learned in Guatemala. Whathe was offering them, he told publishers (who never took him up on his offer),was a “practical guide to political and public action by a man who for half acentury has practiced in this area of public opinion and public relations.”60[notes.html#ch8_60a]"},{"pageContent":"9Uncle SIGIAnyone who knew Eddie Bernays knew how much he took from his illustrious uncle,Sigmund Freud. But few knew how much he gave back.Evidence of that give-and-take is sprinkled throughout the scores of lettersEddie and Freud exchanged from 1919 to 1933. The correspondence was at timesintimate and at times cold. It reflected Eddie’s adulation of the esteemedanalyst and Freud’s consternation—and fascination—with his consummately Americannephew and the novel profession he’d chosen. It also showed seldom seen sides ofboth uncle and nephew, revealing Freud to be as preoccupied with worldly mattersas he was baffled by them, and Eddie to be unrecognizably patient andself-deprecating.Many of the letters focus on Eddie’s role in overseeing the translation intoEnglish of Freud’s Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, a compilation of thefamous talks he’d delivered in Vienna between 1915 and 1917. For Eddie, thisproject, like so many things in his career, began serendipitously. He was inParis for the post–World War I peace conference. When a colleague said he’d bevisiting Vienna, Eddie had him take Freud a box of the Havana cigars he lovedbut couldn’t get during the war. Freud sent back a copy of the lectures, inGerman, with the inscription “In grateful acknowledgment of a nephew’s thoughtof his uncle.”Eddie recognized the value of the papers, monetarily and historically, to hisuncle and to himself. So several months later he showed them to his clientHorace Liveright, of Boni and Liveright publishers. “I thought several purposescould be met by publication of the book in English,” he wrote forty-six yearslater. “It would popularize psychoanalysis in America authentically and it wouldprovide stable American dollars for my uncle.”1 [notes.html#ch9_1a] The offer ofdollars—15 percent of royalties—couldn’t have come at a more tempting moment forFreud, who was watching the postwar inflation erode his savings. He authorizedhis nephew to proceed with the translation.Over the years that followed, Eddie repeatedly claimed credit for bringing Freudto the attention of the American public. While he did play a role, Freud alreadywas known and his fame surely would have spread with or without his nephew.Without Eddie, however, Freud’s emotional reactions to the translation mighthave been lost, reactions he almost certainly would have been more hesitant toshare with a nonrelative, but which Eddie saved, and had translated and typed.Those reactions offer almost as much insight into the psychoanalyst’s mode ofthinking as the lectures themselves.Consider, for instance, how hard he was to please. Not long after he’d given hisokay for Eddie to proceed with the translation from German to English, he sentEddie’s father Ely a terse cable instructing him to “tell Edward stoptranslation.”2 [notes.html#ch9_2a] Eddie responded by cable: “translationfinished, introduction written by Stanley Hall also printing advertising andpublicity contracts all placed, disbursements and obligations to date aggregatethree thousands dollars must therefore continue.”3 [notes.html#ch9_3a] Freudanswered by letter, explaining that he had wanted to back out because he’d heardEddie was planning to publish the translation in a newspaper, which would be“too American for us over here.” There also was the fact that Dr. Ernest Jones,who became Freud’s biographer, was about to begin publishing psychoanalytictreatises in England and America and wanted the lectures to be among his firstpublications.4 [notes.html#ch9_4a]Eddie says that he never had any intention of printing in a newspaper histranslation, which was published under the title A General Introduction toPsychoanalysis, and that he never owned the publishing rights Jones was worriedabout. “Rest assured,” he wrote his uncle in December 1919, “that I deeplyregret that your first authorization should have brought my work and obligationsto a point where I could not withdraw. I trust that the book and translationwill bring you added fame and glory and also a substantial recompense.” To showhis good faith, Eddie added, he’d spent $1,000 of his own money on thetranslation, while Liveright was giving Freud $100 before the book even went onsale and offered him another $10,000 to deliver a series of lectures inAmerica.5 [notes.html#ch9_5a]Freud turned down the lecture offer, saying “my health and my powers are not upto the point, I would lose very much by the preparations necessary here, and theenormous costs of travelling and of life in America would greatly diminish thesum guaranteed by the firm.” But he made clear he appreciated Eddie’s efforts,saying, “I am very proud of earning money by the work of my nephew,” and hesuggested Eddie consider working with the psychoanalytic publishing companyJones was helping set up.6 [notes.html#ch9_6a]Those and other letters reflect Freud’s short temper and constantly shiftingmoods, one day chastising his nephew and the next pouring on praise. That waspartly a result of the stress he was under. Given the way he’s venerated todayit’s easy to assume Freud was an éminence grise during his days in Austria, ableto bask in his fame and devote himself to his patients and students. In fact,his country was just coming out of one war and was about to enter another, hisrevolutionary ideas were coming under attack, his finances were approachingruination, and his protégés, including Jones, were competing for his attentionand support. His New World nephew must often have seemed like yet another sourceof distress, as well as the most convenient target against whom to vent hisfrustrations.Eddie’s response to Freud’s mercurial states of mind was to remain unperturbed.There was no sign of the temper he’d unleashed on others, family as well ascolleagues, who questioned his motives or tactics. He seemed pleased to servehis famous uncle and willing to absorb his outbursts. He relished the notion ofacting as a middleman between Freud and important Americans, as he offered to doin a February 1920 letter. The $100 he’d sent from Liveright would be the firstof many payments that “will be substantial and continuous over a long period oftime,” Eddie wrote. Then he told Herr Doktor about a conversation he’d had with“the most important literary agent in America,” who “practically begged me tosecure for him some publication from you which he might place in one of the veryhigh class American monthly literary scientific publications. Needless to say,such an article would be highly lucrative from your standpoint.”7[notes.html#ch9_7a]In June Freud wrote again, annoyed that he hadn’t received a copy of the newlyreleased translation and hadn’t heard from Eddie “for a long time.” Eddie calmlyexplained, as he might to a child, that he’d mailed copies as soon as hereceived them, that he was passing along a $275 advance on royalties, and that“we have naturally, for your information, made no money on this entiretransaction, doing our part as matter of disinterested spirit.”8[notes.html#ch9_8a]It’s easy to see what Freud was getting out of this correspondence: advice aboutpublishing his work, referrals and offers of fees for future writings, and awilling, able, and free financial adviser. His nephew cheerfully attended to theworldly matters that the psychoanalyst knew little about and that he consideredunseemly, even though they were essential to his survival and that of hisfamily. Eddie’s reward was less tangible. Clearly he basked in his uncle’sreflected glory and loved being able to boast later that the interchange whichbegan with a box of cigars “was helpful in introducing psychoanalysis in theUnited States.” But he also relished offering his uncle bits of advice that hewould never be able to claim credit for, and he cherished the fact that Freudtook him seriously, listened to his advice, and on rare occasions even expressedhis appreciation.Watching Eddie drop his uncle’s name over the years, to the point where Varietydubbed him a “professional nephew,” it’s easy to assume he was exploiting therelationship. But their correspondence suggests that if there was exploitation,it went both ways. And it makes clear that the Bernays-Freud relationship wasmore complex and mutually enriching than was apparent to outsiders.There were tensions. The translation, for instance, kept resurfacing as anirritant, especially after Freud had a chance to review it and discovered “anumber of misprints and misunderstandings.” Eddie had hired a ColumbiaUniversity researcher with a doctorate in psychology to translate the lectures,arranged with another scholar who’d studied with Freud to revise it, and “alarge amount of money was spent further in reading, rereading and generallygoing over the translation.” But he’d also been in a hurry, which, Freud said,led to words like “Verdrengung” being translated as “suppression” rather thanthe more accurate “repression.”9 [notes.html#ch9_9a]Freud’s anger seemed to subside as positive reviews poured in from newspapersand cash poured in from Liveright. “I had expected it would mean a piece of goodbusiness to you,” Freud wrote in October 1920, “but I realize from your lettersand Felix’s account that it all goes to my profit, and I thank you heartily forthis demonstration of kindness and helpfulness.” He suggested furthercollaborations with Eddie, including a book to be called Scraps of PopularPsychoanalysis, which would have been the ideal merger of Viennese thought andAmerican love of self-improvement.10 [notes.html#ch9_10a]Eddie, as always, picked up on that encouragement and pursued a series ofpossible deals for Freud—from a six-month lecture tour of America that wouldassure him $5,000 and probably net “several times” that, to an offer of $ 1,000per article for a series of 3,000-word stories on topics like “The Wife’s MentalPlace in the Home” and “What a Child Thinks About.” Freud’s initial response wasa two-word cablegram: “Not Convenient.” He explained in a December 1920 letterthat “I feel deeply grateful toward you on account of the endeavors you make toassist me financially in these hard times and I see it is not your fault if Imust refuse your proposals.” He turned down the lecture tour for numerousreasons, he said. His health was “not so robust,” the offer was “not a verygenerous one,” he wouldn’t feel comfortable speaking in English, and Austriantaxes would eat up his profits. As for the articles, Freud was outraged that theAmerican editors refused to sign a contract before gauging public reaction tohis initial efforts. “This absolute submission of your editors to the rottentaste of an uncultivated public is the cause of the low level of Americanliterature and to be sure the anxiousness to make money is at the root of thissubmission,” the analyst wrote, adding that “the subjects brought forward inyour letter are so commonplace, so far out of my field that I could not givethem my attention and my pen.”11 [notes.html#ch9_11a]Receiving that biting response, Eddie remembered in his memoirs, “wasexasperating, and I felt frustrated in my effort to be helpful. It wasfurthermore quite clear that Freud had no idea how widespread his popular appealwas here; nor did he realize that a scientific body of knowledge could bepopularized without diminishing its scientific validity.”12 [notes.html#ch9_12a]Jones also was taken aback by Freud’s tone, explaining, “I cannot help thinkingthat some of his indignation emanated from feeling a little ashamed himself athaving descended from his usual standards by proposing to earn money throughwriting popular articles. It was the only time in his life that he contemplateddoing such a thing.”13 [notes.html#ch9_13a]That exchange didn’t deter Freud from continuing to call on his nephew for aid,however, and Eddie continued to oblige. Early in 1921, Freud asked for help forthe son of a friend who wanted to emigrate to America; Eddie obtained the neededaffidavit. He also got Freud $1,911.08 in royalties due from Liveright, forwhich Freud was thankful—and more convinced than ever that America was a “queercountry.” As he wrote Eddie in April 1921, “You did not seem to be puzzled orirritated at all by the attempt of the publishers to rob us of our royalties.You seem to consider it a common business trick and I am sure you know yourpeople. No doubt you were right in engaging an attorney to get the money out ofthem.”14 [notes.html#ch9_14a]Eddie frequently wrote letters of introduction for American journalists who werein Vienna and wanted to interview his uncle. Freud wasn’t always obliging,confessing in a June 1922 letter that he “was not kind” to a female reporterreferred to him by Eddie and “she got nothing out of me.”15 [notes.html#ch9_15a]Eddie also referred would-be patients, including a wealthy young colleague who,having gotten no better after visiting New York analysts, wanted to be treatedby Freud. Freud agreed, although he added, “I would not take him if he be ahomosexual and desired to be changed.” Eddie responded, “He assures me he is nota homosexual, and that he is writing you in full detail about his case.”16[notes.html#ch9_16a]While their correspondence focused almost exclusively on business matters, therewere exceptions, as when Freud wrote in the fall of 1922 to congratulate Eddieon his marriage: “I heard from Judith that you have married your friend andhelpmate and [I] join in her conviction that marital happiness is assured toyou.” He signed the letter, “Your old uncle, Sigm.” Eddie responded that “Dorisis proud to be a new niece of Professor Freud, and while she of course will notbask in reflected glory, it is impossible in America not to do that when one isa niece of Professor Freud.” The following year, after meeting Doris in Vienna,Freud wrote Eddie to say he found her “a kind, clever and natural girl.”17[notes.html#ch9_17a]Eddie fared less well in relations with his uncle’s friends. Tensions withErnest Jones and Dr. Otto Rank doomed his plan to participate in otherpublishing projects. And despite considerable effort, nothing came of his bid tolaunch a foundation to promote psychoanalysis in the United States. In July 1929Eddie approached his uncle with another proposal, this time to publish hisautobiography, with the promise of an advance payment of “somewhat over$5000.00.” Freud responded that “this proposal is of course an impossible one.An autobiography is justified only on two conditions. In the first place if theperson in question has had a share in interesting events, important to all.Secondly, as a psychological study. Outwardly my life has transpired quietly andwithout content and can be dismissed with a few dates. A psychologicallycomplete and sincere life recital would, however, demand so many indiscreetrevelations about family, friends, adversaries (most of them still alive), withme as everyone else, that it is precluded from the very outset.”18[notes.html#ch9_18a]Had he written a candid autobiography, one of the things Freud would have talkedabout was his troubled relationship with Ely Bernays and how those strains madeit so improbable—and, presumably, satisfying—that he would form close ties yearslater with Ely’s only son, Eddie.Freud and Ely had once been friends, but that bond became frayed soon afterFreud secretly became engaged to Ely’s younger sister, Martha. The reason forthe break, said Freud’s biographer, was that Freud saw Ely as his “mostdangerous rival” for Martha’s affection. Things got better when, several monthslater, Ely became engaged to Freud’s younger sister, Anna. As Freud wrote in aletter back then: “We freely confess that we were very unjust to Ely. In allimportant matters he shows himself to be high-minded and understanding.”19[notes.html#ch9_19a]Freud changed his mind again a few months later. Ernest Jones knew the reasonsfor this latest break but, apparently not wanting to offend Eddie and otherrelatives, wrote that they “cannot be given here.”20 [notes.html#ch9_20a]Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, in her biography of Freud’s daughter, Anna, filled inthe gap, relying in part on a letter Jones wrote to Anna. Freud was upset,Young-Bruehl wrote, “when Ely, who had been entrusted with part of Martha’ssmall dowry from an aunt, would not return the money and thus held up Freud’shopes for bringing his long engagement finally to an end.” The money was soonreturned, however, and it became clear that the funds “had not been embezzled,as Freud thought.” Another matter that troubled Freud and his fiancée couldn’tbe resolved so easily, as Young-Bruehl explained: “Ely’s financial troubles werecompounded by his infidelity to Freud’s sister and [by] a number of illegitimatechildren to whom he gave money.”21 [notes.html#ch9_21a]Those frictions kept Freud and Ely from communicating for two years and werepartly responsible for Freud staying away from Ely’s wedding in 1883. A year anda half later, Jones wrote, Freud “was just leaving home when Ely entered to paya visit; they bowed to each other without a word. Then Freud, taking advantageof Ely’s absence, went to call on his sister to congratulate her on the birth ofher first child. He made it clear to her, however, that she was not to regardthis gesture as indicating any reconciliation with her husband.”22[notes.html#ch9_22a]The on-again, off-again friendship had warmed again by the time Ely emigrated toAmerica in 1892, and Freud had lent Ely money. Still, bitter feelings persisted,as Freud made clear in a March 1900 letter to his friend Wilhelm Fleiss: “Myelder sister Anna and her four children have just arrived there [Berlin] fromNew York. I do not know what this means and suspect nothing good. I have neverhad any special relationship with her, as I had, for instance, with Rosa, andher marriage to Ely B. has not exactly improved it.”23 [notes.html#ch9_23a]Ely either was unaware of those resentments or rose above them, repaying Freud’sfinancial generosity tenfold during the war, when the Freuds were desperate forcash. He later donated tens of thousands of dollars to an orphans’ fund Freudwas helping to oversee, and after Ely’s death his widow regularly mailed moneyto the Freuds. The old enmities seemed to ease with Freud, too, but there arehints in his letters to Eddie that he hadn’t entirely forgotten or forgiven. InOctober 1923, not long after Ely’s death, the psychiatrist expressed hisregrets, adding, “You know it is hard on me to write more on this subject.Constellations of many years cannot be changed by chance or sudden events.” Andin a letter two months later he referred to “debts your father left here when hewent off to America and never paid in spite of frequent demands, as formed partof his system of cruelty.”24 [notes.html#ch9_24a]The tensions that plagued his father’s relations with Freud seemed to have noeffect on Eddie, who had his own troubles getting along with Ely. Over the yearsEddie made it his mission to collect materials on his uncle and defend himagainst his many critics. He clipped anything written by or about Freud, savedthe dozens of letters from his uncle, and told and retold stories from his youthand afterward about the great psychoanalyst.Some tales were handed down by Eddie’s mother, like the one about Freud as anintense fourteen-year-old. “He sat in the large family drawing room, beforemaps,” Eddie told an interviewer in 1976. “The Franco-Prussian War was on atthat time, and he moved the battle lines as indicated in the morning newspaperwith little flags that he stuck into the line as it changed from day to day.”There also was the story of Freud as slayer of myths: “There had been in 1881 ahorrible fire at the Burgtheater.… Large numbers of people had died in theholocaust. The Emperor Francis Joseph had built apartment houses on the site ofthe theater. Nobody was eager to move into them because they thought that theplace was fraught with misfortune because of the fire. Sigmund Freud and hisnewlywed wife moved into this apartment. He was the first to move in, defyingall kinds of superstition.”25 [notes.html#ch9_25a]Other tales came from Freud’s wife, Martha, and their daughter, Anna, who toldthem to Eddie and Doris during a visit in 1949, ten years after Freud died.Doris took detailed notes on the encounter, writing about how Anna “sometimesflirts with E [Eddie] like a little girl—moment later a tired old woman.Terribly pleased to see E, who patted her hand, kissed her and treated her likechild—no one has ever done that to her before I suppose, and she melted andexpanded.… ‘I never flirt,’ she said when I asked. But she does flirt with E.They decided their affection was incestuous—double cousins. E said, ‘Itsinteresting to experiment in this phase of genetics.’ A [Anna] said‘Academically or practically?’”Anna also talked about the family’s last months in Vienna, when Nazi stormtroopers (the S.A.) and Hitler’s elite guard (the S.S.) repeatedly tormentedthem. “Freud had never shown fear throughout,” Doris wrote in her notes. “S.A.invaded their home on Bergasse, 2 to search for money and treasures, 2 withrifles on guard at door. Martha made them sit down, to their embarrassment. Tookeverything—all money. S.S. came to appraise possessions. In charge was anAustrian Nazi who felt great responsibility to Freud—worried he might be hurt insome way. Posterity would never forgive him. Examined F furniture, silver andvaluable antique curios. If value had been 30 thous. kroner they would have beentaken over. So this Freud guardian appraised them at 29 thous. Under hispersonal supervision everything—even kitchen pots, packed by art experts andsent to London.” Later, after months of waiting, Anna “finally got passport,took it to F. S.S. asked him to sign paper swearing they hadn’t harmed him. Fsaid ‘Shall I also write recommendation of S.S.?’ Also had to swear he’d neverreturn.”26 [notes.html#ch9_26a]Eddie had his own stories about his uncle, whom he first mentioned on the firstpage of his autobiography and quoted or otherwise referred to on forty-fourother pages—slightly more often than he mentioned his mother or father, andconsiderably more often than he spoke of his daughters. Also, all of thereferences to Freud are glowing ones as compared to his constant criticism ofEly. But his memories of Freud weren’t as rich as he’d have liked. As a child,he saw the analyst in Austria and “if I had had foresight, my uncle’s visit toour farm home on the scenic inland lake in the Austrian Tyrol would have been amemorable occasion and I would today be able to recount everything he said anddid. I can truthfully say only that I remember a warm, friendly man, with abeard, who was happy to see his sister, his nieces and his nephew. By one ofthose memory quirks my recollection instead is of a pair of lederhosen put on inhonor of his coming. They were of soft green leather.… Instead of being inspiredby my uncle’s conversation, I was more appropriately inspired by my leatherpants.”27 [notes.html#ch9_27a] At Cornell, meanwhile, Eddie says he “had socialcontact with only two professors in my three-and-one-half years.” One taughthorticulture and wanted to talk about his writings in that field, and the other,“Professor Edward Titchener, the psychologist, learned I was a nephew of Freudand wanted a photograph of my uncle.”28 [notes.html#ch9_28a]Eddie’s favorite story grew out of Doris’s visit with Freud in Vienna in 1923.“He said to her at that time, ‘Edward is one of my sons,’” Eddie wrote in anarticle thirty-one years later, adding that “this pleased me greatly.”29[notes.html#ch9_29a]In 1931, when Freud turned seventy-five, Eddie hosted a birthday party at theRitz-Carlton Hotel that attracted Freud protégé Dr. A. A. Brill, novelistTheodore Dreiser, and attorney Clarence Darrow. Freud couldn’t attend, but thegroup sent him a cable noting that “men and women recruited from the ranks ofpsychoanalysis, medicine, and sociology are assembling in New York to honorthemselves by honoring, on his seventy-fifth birthday, the intrepid explorer whodiscovered the submerged continents of the ego and gave a new orientation toscience and life.”30 [notes.html#ch9_30a] Eddie organized a similar celebration,at New York’s Harmonie Club, on Freud’s eightieth birthday.His nephew’s devotion lasted long after Freud died, as Eddie assumed the role ofguardian of his legacy. In a 1952 letter to Princeton history professor EricGoldman, he took exception to Goldman’s calling Freud short and brisk. “Dr.Freud was never brisk,” his nephew said. “I would say that if you were lookingfor the adjective that would least describe him, this is it. A much betteradjective might be serious or deliberate.” And “he was not little. I would saythat he might well have been about 5’8” or 5’9”.”31 [notes.html#ch9_31a] In 1971an interviewer at Columbia University asked about Freud’s relationship with hissister-in-law, Minna. “Now, there have been all kinds of direct and indirectimplications of immorality in Freud’s conduct with his sister-in-law,” Eddiesaid. “There was one by a divinity school teacher at Andover, that Freud hadrelations with his sister-in-law. Well, that’s completely cockeyed—first, basedon the character and background of Minna; second, the character and backgroundof Martha; and third, the character and background of Sigmund Freud.”32[notes.html#ch9_32a]In a 1980 journal article, Eddie wrote that “Freud often has been a victim ofdistortion by biographers.” His relations with his uncle painted a decidedlymore upbeat picture, Eddie added. “[H]e had warmth, friendliness, modesty.… Ilearned that he demonstrated compassion early in life. Mother told us thatSigmund, at the age of four, soiled a chair with his dirty hands. He said to hismother, ‘Don’t worry. When I grow up I’ll buy you another chair.’” And whenEddie recounted in the article his long correspondence with Freud, it wasn’t themoody or bitter uncle he remembered but the one who “revealed all those basiccharacteristics I have noted, modesty, warmth, and affection.”33[notes.html#ch9_33a]Eddie cemented his relationship as adviser and friend to Freud’s daughter, Anna,when he visited her in the summer of 1949 and again eight months later when shepaid her first visit to America. She wrote Eddie on the eve of that trip,saying, “I look forward to meeting you and Doris again in April, and I hope thatwe can then repeat the intimate and peaceful hours which we had here with you.…I cannot tell you how grateful I would be for your help and advice with regardto the American press.”34 [notes.html#ch9_34a]While he seemed consumed by Freud, Eddie was hesitant to discuss how his unclehad influenced him. “The conscious, the unconscious and the subconscious, andthe superego were friends at home; just as I suppose a stockbroker discussedmarket prices of American Radiator and U.S. Steel,” he told an interviewer in1971, recounting how he and his parents often talked about psychology at thedinner table. “And I ascribe whatever I learned about Freud more to absorptionthan to studiousness in reading of Freud.” The interviewer persisted, asking,“Do you think that in your work in projecting the character of corporations andother entities onto public minds, that you were influenced by Freud?”“Well, I’m glad you raised the question in the words that you did,” Eddie said,“because it indicates the misinterpretation that still prevails about publicrelations. I was seldom interested primarily in projecting characters onto thepublic. I was much more interested in influencing action and letting the actionproject itself to the public.”35 [notes.html#ch9_35a]Whether he acknowledged it or not, Eddie was one of Freud’s most faithfulstudents and most frequent imitators. He shared Freud’s disdain for religion ingeneral and for the Judaism of their forefathers, which both saw assuperstitious. He rebelled, as did Freud, against the superego, feeling it stoodin the way of his becoming the self-made man he was determined to be. Hefollowed Freud’s lead by writing books that laid a framework for his profession.Most of all, Eddie borrowed his uncle’s insights into symbols and other forcesthat motivate people, using them as building blocks for the art and science ofpublic relations.In the end, however, Eddie was preoccupied with the public arena while Freud wascaptivated by matters private and inward-looking. Eddie was, in essence, asociologist while Freud remained a committed psychologist. And while Freudsought to liberate people from their subconscious drives and desires, Eddiesought to exploit those passions."},{"pageContent":"10The Cambridge YEARSLeaving New York wasn’t easy after nearly seventy years. But Eddie wanted tofinish his memoirs and decided he couldn’t do it in the city, with thedistractions of work and a bulging social calendar. Once he’d opted to leave,the question of where he and Doris would spend their golden years was merely amatter of applying the same research and reasoning he’d been using with clientsfor forty-five years.Their new home had to be in a cultural center, so that they would be stimulatedand entertained, and it had to be physically attractive, because they liked tosurround themselves with beauty. It had to be a nexus of business and finance,too, because he hoped to keep active professionally. It couldn’t be toosuburban, because neither of them drove a car. And it had to have good doctors,since he was about to celebrate his seventieth birthday and Doris wassixty-nine.“Above all,” he said later, “I wanted a community in which writing a book was anaccustomed action, where people would leave me alone if I told them I was atwork.”“I crossed most of the cities off the list immediately,” he recounted.“Washington is worse than New York; Providence is provincial. I’ve spent toomuch time in Detroit to want to go there; Chicago is hopeless. I wanted a citywith a sense of nearness to Europe, so the South and West were out, although theclimate at Berkeley is better. Some small cities like Portland, Maine, hadattractions, but they lacked the real city flavor.”In the end there was Boston—”really the only city that combined cultural andeducational possibilities with a tradition, society, intellectual stimulation,and a feeling for Europe.” He refined the search even further by zeroing in onthe Harvard Square neighborhood of Cambridge, which “has a mystique all its own.Going to Sage’s to shop is the moral equivalent of a good cocktail party.”1[notes.html#ch10_1a]Actually, Cambridge was the only choice from the start, for two simple reasons:Eddie and Doris’s two children lived there, along with their six grandchildren;and Cambridge was just a quick train ride from New York. But simplicity wasn’tEddie’s style. Why describe the move as a mundane matter of staying close tofamily when his own decision-making could be cast as a compelling example of howa methodical approach will produce the right professional and personal choices?The fact that Cambridge met all his criteria and happened to be where his familylived was, as he characterized it in the memoirs he moved there to write, “arare fulfillment.”* * *Life in Cambridge was supposed to be serene. Not retirement exactly—Eddie couldnever conceive of that—but contemplative. The kind of contemplation that seemedto be a matter of course in the ivy-covered community along the Charles River,home to Harvard and MIT, to elegant old thoroughfares like Brattle Street, andto bustling boulevards like Massachusetts Avenue.Finishing his memoirs didn’t take long. He’d started them a decade beforeleaving New York, with help from young researchers, and he’d been sketching themin his mind for forty years. But he proceeded to take on so many new projectsthat he told friends he had enough to fill a second volume, which he planned tocall The First Hundred Years, or maybe My Second Hundred Years, In the processhe left an indelible handprint on the city that became his final home.Saving the sycamores along Memorial Drive was one of his earliest passions. TheMassachusetts Legislature had proposed building $6 million worth of underpassesso traffic would no longer be slowed at three busy intersections along Memorial,a tree-lined highway on the Cambridge side of the Charles. The problem was thatCambridge residents didn’t want the extra traffic that would be drawn to thefaster-moving parkway. And they didn’t want to lose fifteen to twenty sycamoretrees that would have been chopped down so the road could be widened enough tohandle the extra traffic.Eddie went to work. He helped organize the Emergency Committee for thePreservation of Memorial Drive, which made pitches to every interest group Eddiecould think of—to mothers who were angry about losing their children’sriverfront playgrounds, to real estate executives who worried about devaluingthe high-rent apartments along the Charles, to historians who were eager topreserve the historic riverfront, to tax-conscious citizens who were reluctantto underwrite a $6 million road project, and to Harvard University, which wantedto keep its backyard pristine. He even organized the kind of public spectacle herightly predicted would seduce the media. “This week, in the predawn hours, apatrol of twentieth-century minutemen has been on duty protecting a stand ofsycamore trees on Memorial Drive from possible destruction by crews oflumberjacks from the Metropolitan District Commission,” the New York Timesreported on November 15,1964. “The patrol has instructions to blow a whistlebeneath the window of a Harvard housemaster, whose wife has agreed to sound thealarm by telephone. Pickets thus summoned are to assemble at the scene and toplace themselves in the path of commission trucks.”2 [notes.html#ch10_2a]The trucks never came, of course, the underpasses never went up, and thesycamores still stand. “To this day, when I drive on Memorial Drive, I oftenthink of Eddie and say, ‘Thank God he did something about this, or the treeswould be gone,’” reminisced Otto Lerbinger, professor of public relations atBoston University.3 [notes.html#ch10_3a]Eddie was back at it a few years later, helping to organize the EmergencyCommittee to Save Homes for Family Life in Cambridge. The committee’s name wasmore of a mouthful this time, and its cause more parochial: blocking theEpiscopal Theological School from building a complex of dormitories that theneighbors, including Eddie and Doris, felt would create unwanted congestion. Theresult, however, was the same: an architect’s rendering was all anyone ever sawof the dormitories.National causes were fair game, too, causes that most despaired of advancing,like improving America’s schools. Applying techniques that had worked so wellselling bacon, beer, and books, Eddie went to work in the mid-1970s on behalf ofthe National School Public Relations Association. He gave the group money for aPR library, spoke at its meetings, reviewed manuscripts, wrote introductions tobooks, and persuaded education agencies from Alaska to Georgia to design anddisplay what he called Flags of Liberty and Learning. At the same time, he wasdoing all he could for those who were way beyond school age. He worked againstage discrimination in Massachusetts and told a congressional committee thatmandatory retirement laws constituted “cruel and unusual punishment to thoseover sixty-five.”Eddie also helped collect money for Armenian earthquake victims and raised theprofile of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,Peace Network 2000, Women in Communications, and other nonprofit groups. And hisEdward L. Bernays Foundation gave thousands of dollars to causes ranging fromrace relations to civil liberties, from the Home for Aged and Infirm Hebrews tothe League of Women Voters.There were occasional paying clients as well. The Brotherhood of RailroadTrainmen, for example, hired him to help defeat legislation that would have madethem submit to compulsory arbitration in labor disputes. Pat Jackson, who writesa PR newsletter and runs a respected agency in New Hampshire, remembers workingwith Eddie on that campaign and watching him use his time-tested technique ofapplying sociology and psychology. Eddie got railroad workers to write peoplelisted in Who’s Who asking if they thought the legislation was fair, then urgedthe VIPs to write to Washington and the media. Jackson also remembers that, eventhough Eddie was only in his early seventies at that time, he “sat at home inCambridge and would call us all over.… He’d just sit there presiding. And allthe money was sent to Eddie; he parceled it out. About a year later I wassummarily dismissed from all this because I’d asked Eddie, ‘Is that the onlyoption? How about this?’ Of course you just didn’t do that with Ed.”4[notes.html#ch10_4a]Eddie had vowed to leave his New York lifestyle behind him. Yet his Cambridgeworld was quickly becoming almost as frenetic, in part because he simply didn’tknow how to slow down. Like many people who define themselves by their work, hekept working as long and as hard as he could—far longer than most.But there was something else that spurred him on. In New York, he’d begun tosense that he was, becoming passé professionally. Procter and Gamble had lefthim, along with other longtime clients like United Fruit and the tobaccocompanies. He was a solo operator in an era when big-name companies preferredbig-name PR firms, an aging warrior too seldom summoned to battle. And histechniques often seemed outmoded, if not stale, as when he mobilized scores of“opinion leaders” to endorse whatever his client was selling, failing to seethat the public no longer cared what so-called authority figures thought.If there’d been no professional reason to stay in Manhattan, there also was nopersonal one. He didn’t have many intimate friends, then or ever. He didn’t playgolf or cards or any of the other things men of his era did to bond, and hisshort fuse and high expectations made it tough for him to keep friends. He hadhundreds of acquaintances, people he could invite to parties, but he had nofriends he could confide in or who would confide in him. He couldn’t admit anyof this to his family, of course, or to himself. So he made his departure fromNew York seem like an escape from a life that was too busy rather than from onethat was suddenly too quiet.Coming to Cambridge was, in that sense, fighting to hang on. That’s why he wasso determined to fashion a full life, to let people know he still mattered. Andthat’s why he told interviewers he still had lots of clients willing to forkover $ 1,000 an hour for his sage advice. Some of those clients recall workingwith him but only in an informal way and never for $1,000 an hour. The only onewho remembered huge payments was Howard Chase, the retired director of publicrelations at General Mills who was former assistant secretary of commerce and avaunted PR guru. “I brought Eddie in to a man several years ago who wasinterested in granting funds to a kind of One World foundation,” Chase said in1995. “Eddie arranged a little lunch of eight people at a club he belonged to,it lasted about one and a half hours. I had neglected to find out in advancewhat his fee would be, and he came in for $5,000. My wealthy friend was annoyedat me, as he should have been, and I was very much annoyed at Eddie. But ofcourse my friend paid it.”5 [notes.html#ch10_5a]Chub Peabody was more than annoyed, he was screaming mad. He ran for governornot long after Eddie arrived in Cambridge, and he would set aside an hour everyday at a downtown hotel to personally solicit funds from large donors. Eddie wasinvited in, and the two spent about forty-five minutes chatting before Peabody,who went on to win a two-year term, got around to asking for a contribution.Eddie, believing the advice he’d just dispensed was worth more than any cash hecould offer, said, “You’ve just received it.”* * *Finding the right home was as essential in Cambridge as it had been inManhattan. For anyone else, it would have been a straightforward matter ofconsulting agents and perusing ads. But for Eddie it was a delicious challenge,a lot like locating the right city.He and Doris began by renting on Berkeley Street. All the while Eddie was hiringtaxi drivers to show him around Cambridge, cruising neighborhoods at five milesan hour, jumping out each time he saw a home he liked. The process was sofrustrating that his regular cab-driver finally ordered him out. Eddie got themessage and persuaded the driver to take him to a car dealer, where he bought alight blue Cadillac; he later hired a chauffeur. The taxi rides already hadserved their purpose, however, yielding a list of streets he liked, and a friendfollowed up with letters to seven hundred homeowners, asking if they’d sell.Seventy replied but, as Eddie told a reporter afterward, none agreed to partwith their dwelling.“One of the letters, however, offered ‘condolences’ on my search,” he recounted,“and pointed out that the only way houses came on the market in Cambridge waswhen the owner died. So I changed my method, and began going to as many cocktailand dinner parties in the Harvard Square area as I could. At the third dinnerparty, my hostess mentioned that a woman she knew had just died, and that shehad owned a lovely house on Lowell Street. We’re living in it now.”6[notes.html#ch10_6a]The century-old white Victorian was an unlikely choice. It had ceilings thatsomehow seemed too high, too few bedrooms for a house that size, and dimensionsso awkward that it was difficult to decide how to use the space. More important,Eddie and Doris simply didn’t belong in a place that big. Doris adored thebackyard, which she called her Central Park, but she needed a motorized chair tonegotiate the long stairway. And neither she nor Eddie was prepared to care forsuch a rambling and rickety home. They’d seen something cozier not far away thatDoris loved, but Eddie insisted on the place at 7 Lowell.It was partly the setting that sold him. Sandwiched between historic BrattleStreet and Mount Auburn Street, tree-lined Lowell offered convenience, quiet,and, best of all, one of the most fashionable addresses in Cambridge. The editorof the New England Journal of Medicine lived nearby, along with a famous heartsurgeon from the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and an esteemed psychiatrist. Otherneighbors had long-standing connections to Brahmin Boston and haughty Harvard.All of which was just right for Eddie, whose home had always constituted anintegral part of his persona.He knew the house was bigger than he and Doris needed, but having plenty ofspace was very important to Eddie. He planned to do a lot of entertaining, andwhenever he inspected a home he imagined it full of guests. Space also had ametaphorical meaning to Eddie: it gave him a feeling of being free andunfettered. That was why he always bought shoes a bit bigger than he needed andwore the crotch in his pants a bit lower than necessary. And it was why hishomes, starting back in Washington Square Park, had been substantially largerthan they had to be.His grandchildren certainly didn’t mind. They loved to explore the Lowell Streethouse, hiding in nooks and crannies and dormers; running around in the yard;and, the memory they cherish most, assembling in the dining room for Sundaybrunch. “Here’s how the ritual worked,” recalls Lucas Held, the older son ofdaughter Doris. “The two families would come over sometime around noon, and ataxicab would be dispatched to Jack and Marion’s deli in Brookline. Soon therewould appear on their huge seventeenth-century oak table big platters of cornedbeef and rye bread, smoked salmon, coleslaw, and of course the mandatorystrawberry cheesecake.”7 [notes.html#ch10_7a]After lunch Eddie would settle into his soft chair, with his six grandkidsassembled around him, and resurrect the stories of Captain Merriwell for thislatest generation. “They were wonderful stories with lots of adventures, like inIndia with a pith helmet,” remembers Hester Kaplan, Anne’s middle daughter. “Hetold us another installment every Sunday. He let us sit on his lap and pull hismustache. He was extremely generous, a storybook grandfather.”8[notes.html#ch10_8a] Sometimes he’d top that with a magic show. “He’d take apaper napkin and crumple it into a tight ball,” says Lucas, “and he’d put hishand over his mouth and make a series of horrible grimaces. I remember watchingwith a sense of fascination and fear as he’d bring his hand to … his ear and,with more terrible contortions, pull the napkin out of his ear and display it tothe assembled crowd of children.”Julie Held, Lucas’s sister, was enchanted by those Sundays at her grandparents’house, remembering how, when she arrived, Eddie would “throw his arms open andgive me a big bear hug. He’d say, ‘Hello, my little friend.’ I’d call mygrandparents every day when I was between eight and twelve. He’d answer thephone and I’d say, ‘Eddie?’ He’d say, ‘Yessie.’”9 [notes.html#ch10_9a] She alsoloved Eddie’s cartoons, drawings so skillfully sketched and clever that hisdaughter Doris, who saved a stack of them, is sure he could have been aprofessional cartoonist.There were Friday dinners at Joyce Chen’s restaurant or the Harvard FacultyClub, where Doris would pour a packet of Sanka powder over her vanilla ice creamto temper the sweetness. At home Eddie concocted strange meals for the kids andtheir friends—Coca-Cola warmed on a stove with raisins and other mysteriousingredients, which Julie dubbed a “hot toddy for underage kids,” or a dinnerconsisting of sizzling steak, frozen vegetables, and a glass or two of AstiSpumante. And when they went to camp he sent care packages of pack after pack ofspearmint gum, along with a salami. Or, in Hester’s case, “Camembert in tins ormacadamia nuts—exotic, fancy, odd things.”Sometimes Eddie’s different way of doing things seemed charming, but at othertimes it was annoying. He couldn’t recount an old PR campaign without insistingit was precedent-setting, and he couldn’t eat a simple bowl of fish soup,without pronouncing it “the best fish soup ever.” His family knew thatexaggeration was an element of his work that long ago had become an element ofhis personality. They also knew their grandfather really believed the soup wasthe best, which made it easier for them to accept his hyperbole.His letters to the grandchildren left little doubt about the joy they gave him.He wrote to “Little Susanna” in 1961, when she was just three, to say that“Mother Goose will be arriving at Francis Avenue in a few days and will speak toyou from your record player. Please let her know how you like her and herfriends.” And his grandchildren wrote back, with Hester, in an undated letterembellished with drawings of a tree, a dog, a house, and a little girl, telling“gampa and grama” that “we go to town every day. I miss you very much. My cat isHaving babies. I learned to swimg.”10 [notes.html#ch10_10a]The fairy tale began to fade as Eddie’s grandchildren grew older, however, justas it had with their mothers. “The same characteristics that had made him sowonderful [when I was] a little kid made him difficult to be around later,” saysHester. “The focus always was on him, he gave lots of advice, he’d tell you whatto do or what you were doing wrong. There never for me was much sense [that] heknew who I was or was particularly interested.… When I was in college and won awriting award, he sent a telegram that said, ‘Congratulations for carrying onthe Bernays tradition.’ I didn’t know what that was. The gesture was there, butit wasn’t quite person specific.”11 [notes.html#ch10_11a]The old playfulness increasingly gave way to lectures on career choices, ondoing the right research, and on considering all the options. He also added hisgrandchildren to the long list of those to whom he mailed copies of each articlehe wrote and every story written about him. That sort of preaching “was likesomething we had to get through. He had to just do it, and then we could get onto the more real stuff,” says Julie.12 [notes.html#ch10_12a] But Susanna KaplanDonahue, his oldest grandchild, says, “I don’t think he was ever physicallyloving. There were no hugs or anything you read about grandfathers in thebooks.”13 [notes.html#ch10_13a]Eventually his grandchildren had children of their own. And to Hester’s sons,Eddie seemed even more bewitching than he’d been to her. She explains that “he’dsay they were very virile, very manly. I have no idea what he meant with aone-year-old. But he got great pleasure out of them, and they thought he wasfascinating, the oldest man on the face of the earth, teeny and wrinkled withspots all over him. They wanted to be with him. It was cool for them.”14[notes.html#ch10_14a]His relations with his daughters never warmed the way he imagined they wouldwhen he moved to Cambridge. Being nearby merely meant more opportunity for himto intervene in their lives in ways they resented. Tensions ran highest withAnne, the younger and more rebellious daughter. When she and her husband, JustinKaplan, took off for Berkeley in the summer of 1961, for instance, Eddie wroteto the publisher of the San Fernando Sun, to columnist Herb Caen of the SanFrancisco Chronicle, and to the book editors of the San Francisco Examiner, SanFrancisco News-Call Bulletin, and Berkeley Daily Gazette. He just wanted to saythey were coming and that Kaplan was writing a biography of Mark Twain whileAnne had worked for “the avant-garde magazine Discovery.” He also mentioned thatAnne was his and Doris’s daughter and Sigmund Freud’s grandniece. The next year,although Anne had made clear that she didn’t want Eddie to promote her firstbook, Short Pleasures, he sent out press releases and dropped a line toDoubleday suggesting a full-fledged promotion campaign.Anne knew he meant well, but she was tired of his interference and frustrated byhow little he understood her world. “Discovery had been dead for six or sevenyears,” she recalls, “and his promotions were horrible, just awful.”15[notes.html#ch10_15a] Justin says the letters to California journalists weretypical: “When we went to Europe he wrote to a lot of old fart ambassadors wehad no interest in seeing under any circumstances.… My bigger issue with him wasreality versus appearance. He didn’t understand what the point was of doing goodwork if you weren’t recognized for it.”16 [notes.html#ch10_16a]Things with daughter Doris were better, but not by much. She liked the idea ofhaving her father and mother nearby and of having her three children really getto know their grandparents. And her parents did stop by regularly to play withthe kids, but they never baby-sat, and the children seldom visited them withouttheir parents. That was partly because of the older Doris’s back pain, whichlimited her mobility, and partly because, as young Doris recalls, Eddie “didn’twant to be part of my life. He wanted to continue in his direction, and hisdirection and my direction were very different.”17 [notes.html#ch10_17a]* * *Eddie had considerably more time to spend with his wife during the Cambridgeyears. Doris no longer had a household staff to manage, and they no longer spentlong hours at the office. That meant more time to stroll down Brattle Street,holding hands, or to sit and read in the backyard. “They did so well together,”says Frank Genovese, who befriended them shortly after their move to Cambridge.“They were both so bright; they had ideas and encouraged each other. It wasrather wonderful to watch them interact.”18 [notes.html#ch10_18a]Their partnership seemed most seamless during the garden parties they hosted onthe lawn behind the house. The backyard was abuzz with artists exchanging gossipwith writers, and politicians trading tales with diplomats from as far off asIndia. Sometimes there was an orchestra. Doris would take hold of Eddie’s armand expertly navigate him through the crowd, stopping to let him greet a friendor chime in with a story. Eddie needed to surround himself with people to feelalive. He relished those gatherings as he had his soirees decades before in NewYork. “He wanted to have the feeling of having lived in very deep ways andwanted to enjoy himself,” says Camille Roman, a close friend from those years.“One time we were talking about poetry. I was asking him jokingly could heremember any, and Eddie took up the challenge with all he’d memorized fromLongfellow and Kipling. Doris was astounded and said, ‘I didn’t know you knewany of that.’ “19 [notes.html#ch10_19a]Everette Dennis, a journalism educator, recalls getting to know the Bernayses in1977, when he began a fellowship at Harvard. “I went to his house at elevenA.M., and there was this elfin man who answered the door. In his usual style heoffered tea or coffee, then gave me the grand tour. I thought I’d be there anhour. Then Doris came in. She was magnificently attractive, with huge piercingeyes, hair pulled to the back of her head, a great presence, and she said, ‘Oh,you’re still talking. You should get a bite of lunch.’ I wanted to excusemyself, but I did stay for lunch, and I remember them serving these ghastlyGerman wines, and he liked to top it off with slivovitz. Then he said, ‘Let’stalk a while longer,’ and I was there until four in the afternoon.… When my wifemoved to Boston we had dinner almost weekly for about a year. We always went totheir place; only once could we get them out anyplace. He said, ‘I hate to dosocial bookkeeping. Come to our house and you don’t need to do a quid proquo.’”20 [notes.html#ch10_20a]Tit-for-tat had its place, however, as in 1971, when an obituary of Mrs.Florence Sutro Anspacher mentioned “the Bernays Foundation, of which the lateEdward L. Bernays, the public relations consultant, was president.” Rememberinghow Mark Twain had rebutted the “greatly exaggerated” reports of his death,Eddie relished the prospect of calling the newspaper to point out the error. Buthe didn’t want them to simply run a retraction; he’d learned years before thatdenying a rumor only made people believe it more, and he understood that thenewspaper was embarrassed enough to do whatever he asked. So he asked for astory on a lecture series he was sponsoring at Boston University. The lecturesweren’t nearly significant enough to be reported in the paper under normalcircumstances, but they were announced the next day in an article noting thatthe obituary had “inadvertently stated that Mr. Bernays was deceased.”21[notes.html#ch10_21a]Three years later he and Doris rebounded again, this time from an armed robberythat would have set back a couple of any age and been disabling to mostoctogenarians. The burglar crawled in through a window in the pantry and, whenEddie came down to investigate the noise, the intruder confronted him with agun. “The guy said, ‘I’m here to rob you,’” Anne remembers, “and Eddie said,‘You don’t need that gun. Just put it down and tell me what you want.’ [Theburglar] put the gun down and took a mink coat and a typewriter, maybe anelectric shaver, but he never got upstairs.”22 [notes.html#ch10_22a] Later, whenthe shock of what had happened sank in, Eddie and Doris temporarily moved to theRitz-Carlton Hotel in Boston, then to the Copley Plaza, and they consideredrelocating to an apartment in the more sedate suburbs of Brookline or Newton.They ultimately stayed in Cambridge, but only after installing a fortresslikearray of locks and bolts, along with impenetrable window screens, that kept themlocked in as efficiently as it kept others out.Those generally peaceful years together didn’t last long enough, however. Andlike so much else in Eddie’s life, things weren’t as serene as they seemed.Doris wasn’t taking to their new life the way Eddie was. She’d had intimatefriends in New York and never got over leaving them behind. While Cambridge clubsociety welcomed her, she found chatting with bright but unfulfilled matrons tooboring for words.Doris also finally had time to reflect on her career and her family, whichproved unsettling. She was a talented writer who had always wanted to be anovelist but had failed to complete any of the several novels she began. Shealso had doubts about having spent so much time and energy on public relations,a field she’d been dragged into by Eddie. And it can’t have been easy for her towatch her daughter Anne finish her novels and have them published, or to seeAnne show her disdain for public relations by quickly spuming Eddie and Doris’soffer to take over their PR business.Then there was the way Eddie treated her. He’d always had conflictingexpectations—wanting her to be the twenty-four-hour-a-day partner he kepttelling interviewers about, but not realizing how much backbreaking work thatinvolved. He’d never been an equal partner at home, and he never was willing togive Doris the credit she deserved for her pioneering work in public relations.He’d never truly consulted her before deciding to move to Cambridge or beforeany of their many moves in New York. So while she relished spending more timewith him in retirement, it was also a strain. She confessed to her son-in-law,Justin Kaplan, that she sometimes felt “like a prisoner. I think she meantimprisoned by Eddie. He wouldn’t even let her sit out in the backyard byherself. He kept a short leash on her.”23 [notes.html#ch10_23a]Eddie insisted he was simply protecting her after their robbery and a muggingnearby, but really it had as much to do with his insecurities as wanting toprotect her. He cherished her support and friendship, but wanted them all tohimself. He was overprotective of her in overt ways but didn’t protect hernearly enough from physical and emotional pain.Her discomfort was apparent to all three of Anne and Justin’s children, althoughthey weren’t sure where it came from or what it meant. Doris had “a slightlyimperious air to her. Very imperious. Pretty cold, I thought,” says Hester.“Eddie was the center of attention at that point. Grandmother would be watching,listening, and make a very regal appearance. She’d descend the staircase with aQueen Elizabeth-like pocketbook, triangular and stiff with a short handle.”24[notes.html#ch10_24a] And while Eddie relished the spontaneity of the children,Doris seemed preoccupied with how to put things back in order.Julie Held has a less grim image of her grandmother, recalling how she “calledus kids ‘duckie dear’.… When Playgirl came out,… she wanted a copy. One of usgot her Playgirl—it might have been my aunt and uncle—and she was verydisappointed. ‘Oh,’ she said, ‘it doesn’t show the pecker.’”25[notes.html#ch10_25a]Doris did enjoy writing poetry, especially when Eddie helped get it published.But she sometimes seemed terribly sad, and the more depressed she got, the worsethe pain in her back became. Finally, not long after the robbery, her olderdaughter gave her the name of a psychiatrist. She went and seemed to beimproving, but Eddie wasn’t happy about his wife needing therapy. First heinsisted on attending one of her sessions; then he made her stop. “My father puthis foot down and said, ‘You can’t see this person anymore.’ It may be becausehe was threatened; he probably understood he was an issue,” says Anne.26[notes.html#ch10_26a] Justin recalls meeting Eddie and Doris for lunch in Bostonone day when “she had just come back from her shrink. The conversation at thetable was extremely unpleasant, with Eddie saying, ‘I don’t want you to see thatperson again.’ The general argument was that it wasn’t doing her any good andthat this person was learning things that probably weren’t any of her business.It was a very, very powerful confrontation on this issue of her seeing ashrink.”27 [notes.html#ch10_27a]Eddie seemed to have forgotten that he’d spent much of his life touting themerits of psychoanalysis as practiced by his uncle Sigmund. “He was anambivalent keeper of the flame, to say the least,” says his daughter Doris,herself a therapist. “He could see psychoanalytic theory or Freudian theory inits applicability to groups, its sociological applicability, and he was a veryquick study in that sense. In a more personal sense, he didn’t have a clue whatit was all about. He never understood it.”28 [notes.html#ch10_28a]It also was becoming increasingly clear that Doris wasn’t well. She’d always hada bad back, caused in part by a tumble she’d taken as a youth and aggravated byarthritis. She had developed cataracts in both eyes, and she used a bigtortoiseshell hearing aid. Twenty years earlier cancer had forced her to have abreast removed. In addition, a doctor’s report in January 1980 said she hadblocked arteries throughout her body and a leaky heart valve. She’d hadheart-related chest pains “for at least fifteen years” and, at some point, hadsuffered a heart attack, all of which likely resulted from her cigarettesmoking.29 [notes.html#ch10_29a] Her illness might explain why, as hergranddaughter Polly remembers, “she always ate antacids and had crusty stuffaround her lips.”30 [notes.html#ch10_30a]Antacids weren’t all she was eating. She took Lasix and Aldactone to removebodily fluids and digoxin to strengthen her heartbeat. There were Darvocet andnitroglycerin pills for pain, Maalox for indigestion, Senokot for constipation,Dalmane to sleep, and Persantine to boost her circulation.31[notes.html#ch10_31a]Nothing she was taking helped her get back her appetite, but Eddie knew thetrick. When it came to a physiological problem like that, he was at his mostcharming and creative. He would take breakfast to Doris’s bedroom every morning,sometimes including treats like vanilla ice cream with her favorite topping,Sanka. He also served lunch, and when she insisted she wasn’t hungry, he wouldtalk about politics or poetry—anything to distract her long enough to take onebite, then another, until she had eaten just enough to sustain her.She couldn’t sustain herself for long, however. Six months after her 1980medical examination Doris suffered a massive stroke that began as a clot andultimately caused her brain to hemorrhage. She died ten days later.* * *His wife’s death was the hardest adjustment Eddie ever had to make. As hadhappened with so many other things in his life, his reaction was brimming withcontradictions.First he fell into despair. Life seemed pretty pointless when you’d lost yourcompanion of fifty-eight years and your best friend. He’d always been resilient,but Doris had always been around to help him bounce back. “We were at his homewhen Doris was in a coma. We spent six to eight hours with them,” Camille Romansays. “My husband observed how Eddie came unglued when Doris died. He said,‘Eddie had Doris between him and the world. She was his grounding.’”32[notes.html#ch10_32a]Then there was denial. Eddie wasn’t good at directly confronting any emotionalissue, and death was especially tough for him. The same had been true when hismother died. It was why he couldn’t talk about his own mortality. And it wasespecially apparent now. “After my grandmother died,” Hester remembers, “he wasall business. After reading Kübler-Ross’s book [on adjusting to the death ofloved ones] he stated he’d passed all of the stages, and this was within twodays!”33 [notes.html#ch10_33a]Finally there was the release that often comes along with denial. Without Dorisas his “moral anchor,” Eddie at first “acted like someone let out of jail,” hisdaughter Anne says. “He partied, he stayed out till three in the morning, hewent out everywhere. Anywhere anyone invited him he went. He started drinking alot of wine.”34 [notes.html#ch10_34a] Anne’s husband, Justin, remembers that atfirst Eddie “appeared to be thoroughly traumatized. He was walking around in adaze for several weeks; he was really stricken. But then some amazingtransformation occurred, and he took on another life altogether. He appeared tobe younger and act younger. He went to all kinds of weird parties. He went to agay bar and said, ‘A man kissed me.’ It was as if ten to fifteen years haddropped off his life suddenly. But he still kept the bedroom exactly the way ithad been, including her little four-drawer jewelry case that was open withnecklaces dripping out of it.”35 [notes.html#ch10_35a]Eddie’s older daughter, Doris, once again saw those seeming contradictions astwo sides of the same reaction to the trauma of losing his lifelong partner. Hewas so devastated, she says, that he described his deceased wife as “a part ofhimself, like an arm or a leg.” But then he brought in “a string of young womento help him get back to life.”36 [notes.html#ch10_36a]Eddie hired the women to keep him company in return for room and board. Mostwere in their twenties or thirties, and all were bright and attractive. Mostkept their regular jobs, spending time with him in the morning and evening, andall were astonished at the active life he maintained as he neared ninety. Up by5:30 A.M., he’d start the day by reading the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald,the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post. “I’d leavefor work about eight, but always spent about fifteen minutes with him in themorning to make arrangements for the day,” recalls Cindy Strousse, a publicrelations woman who was about to turn thirty when she moved in with Eddie acouple years after Doris died.37 [notes.html#ch10_37a] “I’d go into his room,and he’d be sitting there dressed, at a chair and table. He’d tell me all theimportant things he’d read about.”During the day Eddie would have visitors, of whom some came for advice, othersto chat. When new guests came, he often played the “chair game,” inviting themto sit on Doris’s electric stair climber. Once they were strapped in, he’d runahead, beat them to the top, and stand there grinning, eyes sparkling. Heregaled his visitors with stories about his Easter Sunday Torches of Freedomparade, Light’s Golden Jubilee, or some other classic campaign—stories that hecould repeat word for word and that never failed to charm. Once his guests left,he would read his mail, which still came in stacks, pasting the best lettersinto notebooks, which he added to his Library of Congress collection. Twice aweek he walked the ten blocks to Harvard Square to do his banking and otherbusiness, never taking out denominations bigger than five dollars.He was still writing prolifically, mainly letters to the editor, like one in1975 to Harvard magazine bemoaning the “startling omission” of public opinionand communications courses from the curriculum at the John F. Kennedy School ofGovernment. There were book reviews, too, and twenty years of correspondencewith people like Grinnell Herald-Register publisher A1 Pinder in Iowa, whom he’dmet by chance in the late sixties. Finally there were his handwritten “for yourinformation and comment” notes to old friends and casual acquaintances, passingalong articles of interest, most often about him.Setting up routines and looking for ways to keep busy are part of the adjustmentthat all retirees make, and the task is always tougher when they lose a longtimespouse, as Eddie had. But staying in control was more important for him than formost. And being alone was more difficult. He didn’t especially like readingbooks. He didn’t like watching television. He’d always thrived on contact withpeople—talking on the telephone, getting together with friends, and invitingover a houseful of people to fill the empty space whenever he felt lonely.Life in Cambridge was supposed to put him at the center of a crowd, but itwasn’t working out that way. He desperately wanted to be accepted into theHarvard community, to be taken seriously as the author and creative thinker hesaw himself as. But Harvard had never acknowledged journalism as a pursuitworthy of its attention, let alone the unsavory craft of public relations. Thebest Eddie could manage was to forge ties with less lofty schools like BostonUniversity, Northeastern, and Emerson College. They had schools of journalismand courses in public relations, and were grateful for Eddie’s expertise and forthe largesse of the Bernays Foundation.Winning acceptance by the wider Cambridge community wasn’t much easier. Thepeople of Cambridge weren’t sure what to make of Eddie’s light blue Cadillac orhis heavy-handed tactics. And, like the literati of Harvard, they didn’t know,or care to know, much about public relations. Eddie’s wife had been adept atassimilating into the local culture and had been welcomed into Cambridge’s innersanctums. But Eddie, who was less intuitive and less flexible, was never reallyaccepted.Boston Brahmins were also wary of this Jewish PR man, wary enough that while theaugust Boston Symphony Orchestra gladly accepted his advice, it never invitedhim to become a board member. Decades earlier, and for similar, reasons,Manhattan’s Metropolitan Opera had denied him the private box he so desperatelywanted. It wasn’t that he especially liked opera, but a box at the Metropolitanwas as clear a sign as there was of status in 1930s New York.In his old age Eddie’s family was a disappointment, too. His grandchildren weregrowing up and, with the exception of his grandson Andrew, moving away. It waslate to suddenly forge a close relationship with Anne. And while he was in touchevery day with his older daughter, Doris, they never really became close—inpart, she thinks, because Eddie was afraid of depending too much on anyone.Still, he had too much energy and was too resourceful to give up. And it wasn’tlike him to stew about lost opportunities, a trait his daughters think was a keyto his longevity. He found the companionship he craved with his new youngfriends, like Cindy Strousse. By the time she got home in the evening, Eddiewould have finished his reading and writing and cooked dinner, “usually chickenthat his wife taught him how to cook,” Strousse says. “He’d broil it on oneside, and it’d always be burnt and dry. He’d throw vodka on it. And there’d becanned peas or canned asparagus. During the day he’d eat candy and stuff—M&M’sand anything chocolate. He’d put it in his pocket and munch on it all day.…Every night he’d watch Dan Rather, his favorite news. The TV would be on reallyloud because he couldn’t hear. I’d always turn it down a little bit, and he’dturn it up and always say he wasn’t hard-of-hearing. Every night Dan Ratherwould say, ‘Good night,’ and Eddie would say, ‘Good night, Dan.’“He didn’t want somebody like me there to take care of him,” Strousse adds. “Hejust wanted to know that at the end of the day there’d be somebody there to talkto. The relationship he and I had was one where sometimes he was the grandfatherand I was the granddaughter, sometimes I was the mother and he was the son. Onetime, when he hurt his back, I looked down and he’d forgotten to put his sockson. Sometimes when he was home with me he’d take his dentures out. Someone wouldknock on the door, and the dentures would be in his pocket. I’d pat my teeth,and he’d put one hand into his pocket and casually put his teeth in his mouth.“Sometimes we were like sister and brother. We’d fight about actual things andhave to get out a book and prove who was right and who was wrong. We knew eachother that well and knew which buttons to press.… He was very generous, but hewas not generous in terms of money, not at all. He was generous in terms ofgiving of himself. There were some lines he and I never crossed, and money wasabsolutely one of them.”38 [notes.html#ch10_38a]Eddie also reached out to several Cambridge neighbors, especially SherryHoughton. “He was very chivalrous with me. He perceived me as a lady of qualityand treated me as such,” she recalls. “The name Houghton didn’t hurt; my formerhusband’s brother gave Houghton Library to Harvard. A group of us would besitting around and he’d ask ‘Mrs. Houghton’ what she would do under thecircumstances. It wasn’t ‘Sherry,’ which is what he always would call me. Withothers around it was ‘Mrs. Houghton.’ I don’t think he had enough importantpeople around him anymore, so he liked making me more important than I was.”Still, Eddie was good enough company that Houghton invited him to her son’sgraduation from Saint Mark’s prep school. “He was pleased to go out and sit atthis little boarding school in the terrible heat and be an observer, be a memberof the family. If you didn’t have any idea who this guy was you’d have said,‘There’s somebody’s great-great-grandfather who thoughtfully came to hisgraduation.’ Not in the slightest, Eddie could have been taking notes for abook. He was constantly observing, and commented afterward on the trend insubject matter for valedictory speeches and asked, ‘Did you notice howinformally many parents were dressed?’ This inquiring mind is what kept himalive.”39 [notes.html#ch10_39a]Entertaining helped, too, and he maintained his tradition of hosting gardenparties and ad hoc dinner gatherings. The former were less elegant than they hadonce been, with wine now served in paper cups. And the dinners featured whatguests called Chicken Bernays, which meant raw in the middle. Sherry and cheesewere the standard hors d’oeuvres, while the main meal was accompanied byovercooked vegetables, inexpensive German wine, and, for dessert, ice cream orOreo cookies.But just when people thought they knew what to expect, Eddie would surprisethem, as he’d always done. “I brought Claude Bertrand, a French press critic andfetishist about food, there once and said, ‘You’ve got to remember this is anold man and you’re about to have a terrible meal,’” says Everette Dennis. “Wearrived and Eddie was dressed up, for a change; he had on a black suit andlooked very nice. He bowed at the door and spoke fluent French. We had a veryfine wine before dinner, and when we walked in to the dining room there was anentire big salmon, three to four feet long, poached salmon, with exquisite food.He figured a Frenchman was coming to dinner. He wasn’t just dealing with someguy like me from Minnesota. That said a lot about him in many ways, and it wasthe only edible meal I ever had with him.”40 [notes.html#ch10_40a]After Doris died, his closest friend was Herbert Patchell, a Renaissance manwho’d taught at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education and Northeastern andwho was perpetually troubled by allergies and migraines. Hired by Eddie to doyard work and other odd jobs, which helped him pay his bills, Patchell alwaysended up sticking around to eat, talk, and enjoy Eddie’s company, much as Eddiedid his. Patchell distinctly remembers about Eddie’s special voices, like theone he used with his daughters. “I knew about some strains in the family, and hewas genuinely concerned, preoccupied. His voice with them was really a lovingvoice. I wish my parents had used a voice like that.” And there was the“pathetic ninety-eight-year-old voice” Eddie would use when he answered thephone. “If it was a client he’d say, ‘Just a minute,’ and hold the phone againsthis body for ten to fifteen seconds, then answer as himself in a deeper voicethat was much more vigorous, with all his vim poured into it.”Eddie came alive each year as the New England winter finally faded. “We’d go toMahoney’s Garden Center in Winchester,” Patchell says. “I’d get terrible springfever, and here’s this fellow twice my age, and he’d get exactly the sameresponse every year. It reinvigorated him. Coming back from Mahoney’s he’d nevermiss an opportunity to look over a good-looking woman. One day we both commentedon a woman with a great figure who turned out to be a guy in drag. He said,‘Imagine, someone at my age making a mistake like that.’ “41[notes.html#ch10_41a]His age hadn’t done anything to lessen his libido, and Doris’s death gave iteven freer rein. “On one of my visits to his house, I think it was for hisninetieth birthday when there was a big party going on downstairs, I said tohim, ‘To what do you attribute your longevity?’” recalls Mary Ann Pires, one ofmany young PR women who tell similar stories. “He stooped toward me, looked meright in the eyes, and said, ‘I always kissed the girls on the lips.’ There wasa sign right over his bed saying, ‘Be sure and kiss Eddie good night.’”42[notes.html#ch10_42a] Sherry Jahoda had a similar experience: “He was alwaysinterested in women. As I was walking out of the music room to the porch, hegave me a big kiss on my mouth, which was very unexpected. That was after hisone hundredth birthday.”43 [notes.html#ch10_43a]He’d always had a magnetic appeal to girls. “He’d go into any room, and beforeyou knew it all the women were around him, absolutely adoring him,” says hisson-in-law Justin.44 [notes.html#ch10_44a] The older he got, the more the younggirls indulged him by letting him kiss them or hold their hands, sure that thisninety-year-old elflike legend had to be harmless.* * *Something else happened as Eddie got older: people flocked to him, especiallypeople from the PR world who saw him as an icon and mentor.He’d invite to his home students from Boston University, Emerson College, andother area schools, then dispatch them to the store for cheese, cold cuts, andbeer, and let them stay late into the evening as he told story after story.“With the guys he’d sit around drinking and apparently would drink them underthe table,” remembers Cathryn Kaner, who at the time was getting her master’s inpublic relations at Boston University. “He liked the young women and was veryeager to show he was still a vital, sharp, energetic human being.”45[notes.html#ch10_45a] They didn’t seem to mind that they’d often, have to repeatthings, loudly, so he could hear. Or that he’d tell the same story he’d told thelast time they were there. After all, he was a legend, the man they’d read aboutin their textbooks.When she turned twenty-five, Kaner adds, she invited him to her birthday party“in a cramped, roach-infested apartment in Allston. Not only did he attend (andwas one of the last guests to leave), but a few days later I received a letterin the mail from him saying what a good time he had and requesting that I comewith nine of my friends to his place for supper so that we could continue thefestivities.”It wasn’t just students who were captivated. Longtime practitioners stopped in,too, to see this man who’d been there at the beginning. “I went one time to hishouse in Cambridge in 1990,” recalls Joe Trahan, who teaches PR at theUniversity of Tennessee. “He’d just had eye surgery, and the woman taking careof him said, ‘He can’t see you.’ He heard, and he said, ‘Tell him to come onup.’ He showed me his library and the photos on the wall of people he’d been acounselor for. It was like a who’s who in history from the 1900s to today. Wespent five hours together walking and talking.”46 [notes.html#ch10_46a] Pireswas taken on a similar tour, where “Eddie said, ‘There I am with Tom.’ The Tomturned out to be Edison. And ‘Henry and I were together for a meeting,’ wherethe Henry was Ford. The original Ford.”Shelley and Barry Spector took an even longer walk through history, visitingEddie in Cambridge on twenty different occasions and capturing on videotapeeighty hours of conversation that amounts to a greatest-hits record of his longcareer. “He was my hero, meeting the guy who founded the very industry you’re inand seeing him suddenly come to life. He was ninety-three when I met him. Tomost people that’s very old, but he seemed at the time more like seventy-three,”says Shelley, who with her husband runs a PR firm with offices in New York andNew Jersey. The Spectors were so impressed with Eddie and his stories thatthey’ve transformed their New Jersey office into a Bernays museum, complete withhis desk, copies of pictures that lined his Cambridge office, and othermemorabilia.47 [notes.html#ch10_47a]The Spectors weren’t the only PR people who were interested in what Eddie had tosay. He was one of the hottest properties on the national public relationsspeaking circuit in the 1980s and early 1990s. He had overcome his fear offlying and appeared at conferences and conventions from Boston to Puerto Ricoand from Florida to Washington. Peter Hollister served as host when Eddie, whowas 100 years old then, appeared before a PR group in Cincinnati. “I think itwas the last major trip he made,” Hollister said. “His short-term memory was notparticularly strong, but his long-term memory was absolutely wonderful. At onepoint he was talking about his work with President Woodrow Wilson, and he wentdown the list of his Fourteen Points as if he had designed them the daybefore.”48 [notes.html#ch10_48a]Hester, his granddaughter, recalls a colleague asking her to arrange a meetingwith Eddie: “She went over and saw him and said it was the most important hourshe’d ever spent with anybody.… That was probably his greatest gift.”49[notes.html#ch10_49a]Europeans also wanted to hear what this stooped little man with white hair hadto say. Eddie toured Barcelona in 1990, meeting the chief of the Catalonianparliament, the mayor of Barcelona, and scores of PR professionals. “All overthe city we put banners with his photograph, saying, ‘Welcome, Edward.’ We madesome parties here and in other cities and a gala dinner at the palace,” saysElvira Vazquez, the Barcelona businesswoman who arranged the trip.50[notes.html#ch10_50a]Not everyone was enamored with Eddie, however. Barbara Hunter, who was presidentof the Public Relations Society of America in 1984, recalls that she “sharedseveral platforms with him. At that point, he used a lengthy prepared speech(somewhat dog-eared), and delivered it all, whether or not it fitted into thetime he was allocated. I remember being left with fifteen minutes to sum up anentire two-day conference because it was virtually impossible to dissuade himfrom finishing his entire address, which took well over an hour.”51[notes.html#ch10_51a]And not everyone found his advice prescient. Joseph T. Nolan approached Eddie in1954, when Nolan was an editor at the New York Times. At that time the newspaperunions were threatening to strike, and he was considering quitting the paper fora job in public relations. “‘Tell me, young man,’” Nolan remembers Eddie saying,“‘how much money would you expect to make in public relations?’ At the time, mydad was earning about $25,000 as an Assistant School Superintendent inConnecticut, so I replied: ‘I think $25,000 would be a good round number to aimat.’ Bernays was aghast. ‘Young man,’ he said, ‘here in New York the garbagemenmake more than that. Good day, sir!’ Some thirty years later, I reminded him ofthe incident when we were on the same speaking program at the University ofFlorida, he representing PR counseling agencies and I corporate public relations(Chase Manhattan and later Monsanto Chemical). He graciously acknowledged he hadmade a ‘mistake or two,’ over the years, in picking his associates, and perhapsthis was one of them. The concession emboldened me to ask: ‘Ed, why do youpunish yourself—at your age and with your money and prestige—running all overthe country making speeches?’“Without a moment’s hesitation, he replied, ‘Sheer ego, my boy, sheer ego!’”52[notes.html#ch10_52a]That response was more insightful than normal for Eddie, and more candid. He wasused to getting recognition for his achievements and loved it. Over the years hereceived hundreds of keys to cities and citations, many so obscure they ended upin cardboard boxes in the back of his basement. But he was also awarded France’sprestigious Officer of Public Instruction (1926), Denmark’s King Christian XMedal (1946), the Veterans of Foreign Wars’ Award of Appreciation (1955), andthe City of New York’s Bronze Medallion of Honor (1961).The older he got, the more people felt he was worthy of recognition. After hemoved to Cambridge he was honored by Ohio University, Suffolk University, BabsonCollege, the Royal Society of Arts, the Art Institute of Boston, EmersonCollege, and Boston University. The Public Relations Society of America gave himits 1976 Golden Anvil Award, its highest honor for individuals. Massachusettsgovernor Edward King presented him with a proclamation in 1982, and in 1991Boston mayor Raymond Flynn proclaimed an “Edward Bernays Centennial JubileeDay.” In 1984 artist Patricia Marshall Tate completed a portrait of him—infamiliar pink shirt, burgundy tie, light blue vest, and darker blue jacket, witha wall of books in the background—commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery.While working with Eddie had been “delightful,” Tate wrote a friend, it was“rather like trying to paint a grasshopper—with his dashes to answer thedoorbell, the telephone, at a loss for anything else, a dash to the kitchen tobring me a glass of sherry.… From the way he flies around all over the country,and all by himself, he scarcely appears frail! A human marvel.”53[notes.html#ch10_53a]His birthday also became a bigger deal over time, to the point where, when heturned ninety-five, the party was held in the ballroom at the Cambridge MarriottHotel to accommodate the five hundred celebrants. For each celebration there wasa special planning committee, like the Committee of Ninety for his ninetiethbirthday, which included U.S. Senator Jacob Javits of New York, Massachusettsgovernor King, and Meet the Press moderator Lawrence E. Spivak. Eddie’sone-hundredth-birthday party featured a video called 100 Years in the Life ofEdward L. Bernays.Sometimes there were several parties for the same birthday, as in 1981 whenseveral hundred turned out in Chicago for his ninetieth as an encore to theBoston bash. “I arranged the ninetieth birthday Public Relations Society ofAmerica celebration in Chicago,” recalls veteran PR man Frank LeBart, who wasalso vice chairman of the Boston Committee of Ninety. “That was one of hisfinest hours, with a couple thousand people in a huge ballroom andrepresentatives of PRSA and other PR associations. Everyone lighted a candle ina semidarkened ballroom. It was a very exciting moment, and he loved that.‘Ego-titillating’ is a phrase he always used.”54 [notes.html#ch10_54a]His one hundredth, at the fashionable Charles Hotel in Cambridge, was equallyfestive, and he had an equally good time. “Somebody decided it was necessary togive one of those stupid silver bowls commemorating the occasion with his nameand the date, so he said something nice,” remembers Cathryn Kaner. “As he wasleaving the stage he put the bowl on his head. He loved the attention.” JoanSchneider, who runs her own PR agency in Boston, chaired the one hundredth partyand said she was impressed “when I asked Edward if he wanted to make a speechand he said, ‘Of course I’ll make a speech. I’ve been alive one hundred years,and I have a lot to say.’ I was so nervous about speaking for two minutes tointroduce him, and he got up at age one hundred and spoke for twelve minuteswith no notes. It was totally cohesive.… He got a standing ovation.”55[notes.html#ch10_55a]Another common element in the parties was the role Eddie played in planningthem. “I was on the Committee of Ninety, supposedly organized by someone else onhis ninetieth birthday,” recalls Everette Dennis, “but all of us knew we’d beenpicked by Eddie. He acted surprised, ‘Oh, me?’ when in fact he organized andmanipulated every bit of it.”56 [notes.html#ch10_56a]"},{"pageContent":"11A Question of PATERNITYIt was just the sort of obituary Eddie might have crafted for himself. The firstparagraph proclaimed him “an early leader in the public relations field whodevised or developed many techniques for influencing public opinion.” The secondcredited him with enlarging the “narrow concept of press agentry” into a boldbid to “influence and change public opinion and behavior.” The article calledhis campaign on behalf of Lucky Strike green “a brilliant success” and his soapsculpture contests “legendary.” It said his “niche in cultural history seemedassured,” it credited him with turning against smoking in his later years, and,of course, it noted that he was Sigmund Freud’s nephew. His death was announcedon page one and his obituary spanned four columns inside, a true sign ofsignificance in the New York Times, a paper his own surveys had cited asAmerica’s finest. And, best of all, the headline called him the Father of PublicRelations, although it set the title in quotation marks, implying that theeditors weren’t entirely sure.1 [notes.html#ch11_1a]The Times wasn’t alone in lionizing Eddie Bernays. Headlines in the BostonGlobe, USA Today, the Financial Times, the New York Daily News, the ProvidenceJoumal-Bulletin, and scores of other papers also referred to him as the Fatherof Public Relations. The Washington Post didn’t raise the issue of theprofession’s paternity in its headline, but the second paragraph of its obitreported that “Mr. Bernays … often was called ‘the father of public relations.”’Regal titles were nothing new for Eddie. As far back as the 1930s reporters haddevised catchy monikers for this PR pioneer: the Baron of Ballyhoo, Sire of theBig Sell, Master of Mass Psychology, High Priest of Press Agents, Pontiff ofPublicity, Pope of Propaganda, Prince of Propaganda, and Prince of Puff. In 1935Time declared him “No. 1 U.S. Publicist,” a phrase that was regularly repeatedby other publications. In recent years, profilers from the Washington Post, theSan Diego Union, and the Boston Globe settled on the less poetic but morehistorically significant appellation “Father of Public Relations,” a phrase usedso often that it almost became an extension of his name.But was he the legitimate father?Or was he merely so good at his chosen profession that he managed to invent hisown epithet, and a disputed one at that?Those questions might not mean much if they weren’t so central to the way theworld has defined Eddie’s legacy, and the way he defined it. And if the publicrelations profession weren’t so central to American society today. And if themere mention of him as that profession’s “father” didn’t continue to fuel suchpassionate debate among PR professionals. Denny and Glenn Griswold, pioneers inwriting about public relations and longtime colleagues of Eddie’s, beganchronicling that controversy as long ago as 1948, and it has heated up sincethen. “The position of Edward L. Bernays in the history of public relations,”the Griswolds wrote, “is more debatable and more often debated than that of anyother man.”2 [notes.html#ch11_2a]* * *If “father” is taken literally as founder, or first, the verdict on Eddie iseasy: he wasn’t it.The true father probably was Aaron. Back in biblical days God anointed himspokesman for his brother Moses, charged with explaining to the Hebrews why itwas time to pack their bags and head across the desert. It also could have beenJulius Caesar, who wrote commentaries on his campaigns in Gaul to promote hisfortunes in Rome. Or maybe it was the ministers of propaganda for the Catholicchurch, named to fend off attacks from Martin Luther and his followers. InAmerica, the first PR men were Samuel Adams, Thomas Paine, and the otherpatriots who, Eddie wrote, “used oratory, newspaper exposure, meetings, orcorrespondence to rally public opinion to their cause, and as a matter of fact,historical research indicates that Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration ofIndependence as a public relations pronouncement.”3 [notes.html#ch11_3a]The modern era of public relations dates back to the early 1900s, when America’sbusiness leaders realized that persuasion rather than coercion was the bestmethod of getting their way with the public and with the government. That meantletting people know how business operated, tempering business excesses toconform to public mores, and hiring specialists to interpret business to thepeople and vice versa.Scott M. Cutlip, America’s premier PR historian, has analyzed those earlybeginnings and concluded that recognition of publicity as a legitimate corporatefunction began in 1888, when Mutual Life Insurance Company set up a “literarybureau” to put out the word on its products. A year later George Westinghousehired a newspaperman from Pittsburgh to help him do battle with Thomas A.Edison. The first real PR agency, Cutlip says, was the Publicity Bureau, set upin 1900 in Boston by George V. S. Michaelis, Herbert Small, and Thomas O.Marvin. Its clients included Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.4[notes.html#ch11_4a]But while few in or out of the profession today remember Michaelis and hispartners, Ivy Ledbetter Lee still stands out among the early pioneers, and tomany he’s the legitimate claimant to the title of father.Ivy Lee started out as a reporter for the New York Journal, the New York Times,and the New York World, but he quickly realized that reporting wouldn’t earn himthe status and money he wanted. In 1903 he began doing publicity work forpolitical candidates. About a year later he opened an agency, Parker and Lee—thethird of the modern era. While he represented some of America’s biggestcorporations, from the Pennsylvania Railroad to Bethlehem Steel, he’s best knownfor helping transform the public personae of America’s best-known entrepreneurs,John D. Rockefeller Sr. and his son, John D. Jr. The Rockefellers were used tobeing called robber barons and heartless industrialists, but they couldn’tignore the vilification that followed the Ludlow Massacre of April 20, 1914,when operators of a Rockefeller coal mine in Colorado dispatched private guardsand militia against striking miners, burning “to a crisp” two mothers and elevenchildren. In the first of a series of successful efforts to muffle the impact ofthe massacre and rehabilitate the Rockefellers, Lee struck back with pressnotices that cast the strikebreaking as a blow for “industrial freedom.”While many of his efforts on behalf of the Rockefellers remain controversial,Lee managed, with them and other clients, to set a standard for his professionthat elevated it from the hucksterism and press agentry of an earlier era. Heinsisted that actions by a company speak louder than words. He made openness andaccuracy the watchwords for PR counselors and made informing the public, ratherthan ignoring or fooling it, the mission. And he preached that the greatestservice a PR man could perform for business would be to publicize its policiesin “the language of the man who rides in the trolley car and goes to ball games,who chews gum and spits tobacco juice.” Lee was so convincing that corporatetitans started hiring him and his colleagues, often at high salaries and inhigh-level posts, to the point where the New York Herald Tribune referred to himas “A Physician to Corporate Bodies.” Lee liked the title so much he reprintedthe story as a pamphlet.There were other labels, however, that he neither liked nor repeated: “LittleBrother of the Rich,” “Minnesinger to Millionaires,” “paid liar,” and “PoisonIvy.” He also was charged with misleading the press and spreading mine owners’lies after the Ludlow Massacre. Worst of all were accusations that in themid-1930s he had counseled German industrial giant I. G. Farben on how to battlethe bad press that the new Nazi regime was getting. Lee’s defenders insist hewas working with Farben to get Hitler to reform.Despite the controversy, many chroniclers of his era and ours regard Lee as theclosest thing public relations has to a patriarch. Time magazine in 1939proclaimed him the “first great exponent” of public relations, referring toEddie as one of Lee’s “younger rivals.”5 [notes.html#ch11_5a] Veteran PR manJohn W. Hill agreed, calling Lee “unquestionably the father of the modernpractice of public relations counseling.” Eddie, Hill noted, was “anotherpioneer” who “by his writings and speeches, has done much to call attention topublic relations.”6 [notes.html#ch11_6a] And Literary Digest in its 1934obituary called Lee “number 1 publicity man for big business,” adding that Eddiewas a “runner-up to Lee in the art of selling industry to the people.”7[notes.html#ch11_7a]Where Eddie fits into the chronology of the early pioneers depends in part onwhere one puts the starting point. It could be as late as 1919, when he openedhis first office, or as early as 1912, when he first hooked up with his formerclassmate Fred Robinson and started working at the Medical Review of Reviews. Ineither case, he’s more than a decade behind Michaelis and nearly as far in backof Lee. He also was preempted by newspaperman William Wolff Smith, who opened a“publicity business” in Washington in 1902, Hamilton Mercer Wright, who in 1905became the first to undertake publicity for a foreign country, and PendletonDudley, who opened his firm in 1909 and stayed active until his death at ageninety in 1966.Cutlip, in a 1991 letter to the New York Times, said his research had turned upeven more pioneers and convinced him that “when Edward L. Bernays opened hispublicity office in a remodeled house at 19 East Forty-eighth Street in New YorkCity in the summer of 1919, his was the eighth such agency, not the first.”8[notes.html#ch11_8a]* * *Chronology isn’t the only basis for determining paternity, however, especiallywhen one considers fatherhood in the broader context of establishingtheoretical, practical, and ethical guideposts for later generations. In thissense, Eddie has a compelling claim to the title.In 1923 he became the first to teach a university course specifically entitledpublic relations, at New York University, although in 1920 the University ofIllinois had offered a less ambitious course on publicity techniques.Also in 1923 he became the first to publish a book outlining the theory andpractice of public relations, Crystallizing Public Opinion, although two otherpublicity men had published a less ambitious guide a month or so before.Crystallizing “stood alone among works dealing specifically with publicrelations in having exerted any influence outside the narrow public relationsworld or much influence within it,” social historian J. A. R. Pimlott wrote in1951.9 [notes.html#ch11_9a]Through fourteen other books and scores of articles, Eddie established himselfas public relation’s most prolific—and articulate—philosopher and spokesman. Hebuilt on the abstract offerings of Gustave Le Bon and Walter Lippmann, showinghow public relations men were just the ones to tame and mold the mass mind andmake sense of a world where technology seemed out of control and the old orderseemed to be crumbling. He showed how his uncle Sigmund Freud’s insights intowhat drives individuals also explained how to move groups. And he admonished hiscolleagues to see that the real tools of their trade were the laws of socialscience, of research and opinion-molding, just as their real ethical test waswhether they could advance the public good along with their clients’ privateinterests.Not only were Eddie’s theories on his profession the first to be promulgated,but they’ve also lasted longer than anyone else’s. His writings still are citedin public relations courses across America, and of all the early pioneers his isthe name today’s PR students are most likely to recognize.But whether or not they’ve read his writings, contemporary PR scholars andpractitioners are sure to have heard how he put those ideas to work in the realworld. Light’s Golden Jubilee remains a classic example of how to transform ananniversary into an international sensation. His work in Guatemala is a modelfor American corporations on how to flex their economic and diplomatic muscles.And his Torches of Freedom crusade has instructed a whole new generation oftobacco PR men on how to use symbols—and secrecy—to win over a whole newgeneration of smokers. More generally, Bernays’s Big Think continues to be themind-set that separates the most creative and successful PR professionals fromthe rest of their overpopulated field, much as it distinguished Bernays from hisless bold and creative contemporaries.“It has been the custom to hold up Ivy Lee as the greatest example of what anewspaperman may do when he enters upon publicity work,” Stanley Walker wrote in1934. “But it is probable that Bernays is the more important as an Americanphenomenon. He is more of a psychologist, or psychoanalyst, than Lee.… Bernayshas taken the sideshow barker and given him a philosophy and a new and awesomelanguage.”10 [notes.html#ch11_10a]Richard Tedlow of the Harvard Business School, writing forty-five years later,agreed that Bernays was at least Lee’s equal. Lee, he said, “should be viewed asthe representative public relations man of the Progressive era, but thatposition was occupied by Edward L. Bernays in the postwar period.… Lee wastongue-tied when asked to explain his job, but Bernays sallied forth in books,articles, and speeches not only to define public relations counseling (a term hecoined in 1920) but to outline its methodology and suggest a code of ethics.While Lee thought of his trade as an art which would not outlive his career,Bernays conceived of public relations as the ongoing science of the ‘group mind’and ‘herd reaction.’”11 [notes.html#ch11_11a]The popular press also typically sided with Eddie. He “was conditioning the MassMind for Richard Bennett long before Ivy Lee took over the job of merchandisingJohn D. Rockefeller,” John T. Flynn wrote in The Atlantic Monthly in 1932.12[notes.html#ch11_12a] “Edward L. Bernays,” columnist Sid Bernstein wrote inAdvertising Age in 1975, “probably has more right than anyone to be called thefather of modern public relations.”13 [notes.html#ch11_13a] Perhaps the bestsign of Eddie’s relative impact was the fact that he was the only PR manincluded in Life magazine’s 1990 listing of the 100 most important Americans ofthe twentieth century. “It was he and future wife Doris E. Fleischman,” Lifewrote, “who coined the phrase ‘counsel on public relations’ for the businessthey opened in 1919, the prototype for the 2,000 or so PR firms today.”14[notes.html#ch11_14a]* * *Eddie Bernays may have been a prototype for the profession, or even itsprogenitor, but over the years many PR professionals have been slow toacknowledge his pioneer status. And some are mortified at the notion that whatAmerica’s 12 5,000 public relations people do today has anything in common withwhat he was doing half a century ago.That’s partly a natural reaction to the disdain he showed them. Eddie did writemore books, articles, and speeches defining and promoting public relations thananyone then or since, but for most of his life he refused to join the PublicRelations Society of America or any other PR group. And PR people generallydidn’t make it onto the guest lists for his legendary salons and soirees.Asked about his hesitancy to hook up with organizations like PRSA, Eddie, asalways, had a well-rehearsed and high-minded response: “I have never attended ameeting of this group. In fact I was a member of the organization only for oneyear, as a gesture of good will to a good friend. And in that period of time myonly connection was to pay a year’s dues. I firmly believe and still do that theorganization should from its start have required the highest standards ofcharacter and professionalism of its prospective members. But that was not inthe cards because the organization depended upon numbers for its sustenance.”15[notes.html#ch11_15a]That’s only part of the story, however. Eddie was indeed a loner, someone whostaked out new territory and relished the notion that he was so far ahead of histimes that his colleagues couldn’t understand or appreciate him. And he didpreach a standard of ethics that was tough for any group or individual to meet.But he hadn’t always been eager to go it alone, and his later determination todo so wasn’t always a matter of choice.As early as 1927 he chaired a committee of fourteen leading PR men who, usingthe American Medical Association and American Bar Association as models, hopedto create an organization to “clean up the evil practices in publicity.” Thegroup, realizing the sensitivity of its mission, resolved to push ahead quietly,but that resolve was shattered by a long article in Editor and Publisher on theindustry, its troubles, and the move to clean it up. While most committeemembers declined to talk to the magazine, Eddie released a statement that tookup a full column, a move that, as he later acknowledged, offended his fellowcommittee members and doomed the organizing effort.16 [notes.html#ch11_16a]Eddie tried again in 1938, inviting to his home twenty or so leading PR men, butagain the bid was killed by premature publicity that he apparently initiated.“This unpublicized, high-powered group calls itself the Council on PublicOpinion,” Time reported. “Chairman is the nation’s No. 1 publicist, dark,Machiavellian Edward L. Bernays.”17 [notes.html#ch11_17a] The 1938 meeting didhave two effects: it inspired John W. Hill, founder of the huge Hill andKnowlton public relations firm, to form an elite association of PR professionalscalled the Wisemen, and it ensured that Eddie, who’d offended Hill and othersthrough stunts like the self-aggrandizing article in Time, wouldn’t be invitedto join the new group.He’d also been excluded two years earlier when the National Association ofAccredited Publicity Directors was formed. In fact, as Cutlip reports, theassociation “had a rule that when a member mentioned Bernays, he had to drop aquarter in a pot. The money was used to buy drinks at the end of the year.”18[notes.html#ch11_18a]Eddie became such a pariah partly as a result of envy. He was making more moneythan most of his contemporaries. He had more high-profile clients, threw morehigh-flying parties, and got more highly favorable press.Anti-Semitism also probably played a role. Eddie didn’t practice his religionand at times was actively antagonistic to it. Still, nearly everyone knew he wasJewish, if only because he perpetually advertised his relationship to Freud, whoeveryone knew was Jewish. And it wasn’t always easy being a Jew in a businessworld dominated by white Anglo-Saxon Protestants at a time when Jew-baiting waswidespread. “He talked to me openly about things he had to work out because hewas Jewish, social exclusions, trying to work with the WASP politicalestablishment,” recalls Camille Roman, a close friend from the Cambridgeyears.19 [notes.html#ch11_19a]Bernays also had a knack for saying and doing things that made colleaguescringe. Like staging old-style stunts such as the Torches of Freedom parade andwriting books like Propaganda and Engineering Public Consent, whose very titlesdrew the ire of the press and raised the eyebrows of a public already wary ofthe hidden hands of PR men. Worst of all, he relentlessly advocated governmentregulation of the profession, to the dismay of his colleagues. “The licensingdrive was extremely controversial for a lot of reasons,” explains Frank LeBart,a former top PR man at Exxon and John Hancock Insurance who was Eddie’s closefriend. “A lot of the more senior practitioners were very uncomfortable aboutrequirements for accreditation, and many refused to take an exam. There also wasa group who felt strongly that government has no role in public relations. It’sa profession that functions under the First Amendment, and any hint ofgovernment regulation or control is highly undesirable.… Eddie’s motives weregood with this, but he overdid it. He never gave a speech where he didn’tinclude it.”20 [notes.html#ch11_20a]His liberalism on issues ranging from labor unions to race relations was onemore reason many in the craft despised him. Eddie “never shared their devotionto big business or their conservative politics,” writes Tedlow, the HarvardBusiness School professor. “Symbolic of his ideological distance was a remark hemade at a convention in 1945. The customary words of criticism had been directedat unions when Bernays asserted that the record would not be clear ‘if we don’tsay a few words about the strategy of the revolutionary employer. I think we allknow men who are revolutionary in their attitudes and actions to kill off thelabor unions.’ ‘Oh, no, no, no, no!’ moaned George Kelley of Pullman in reply.‘Don’t speak that way of them.’ “21 [notes.html#ch11_21a]If the substance of his message was difficult for colleagues to digest, hisarrogance in delivering it really made them choke. LeBart recalls one suchinstance where Eddie “was having what in effect was a debate over licensing withPhil Leslie, and while Leslie was speaking against it Eddie was sitting in thefront row reading the New York Times. Some of those things did not endear him topeople.”22 [notes.html#ch11_22a]But what most angered his colleagues, even those who rank him as a premierpioneer, was his perpetual self-promotion and the way he actively lobbied forfatherhood status. That’s why Hill kept him out of the Wisemen in 1938, and Hillgrew even angrier over the years as Eddie began to claim credit for bringing himinto public relations. “It was a total legend that Bernays helped bring Hillinto the business,” says Loet Velmans, former chairman of Hill and Knowlton.“Hill had very little respect for Bernays.”23 [notes.html#ch11_23a]Howard Chase, who ran the PR departments at General Mills and General Foods,admired Eddie as “a very, very complicated man of diverse talents.” But he alsosaw him “as a man of fantastic arrogance and egocentricity. The word ‘chutzpah’applied to him as much as anybody I know. He alienated almost everybody else inthe field.… He was never quite accepted by people he regarded as his peersbecause of his self-promotion, his very bland assumption that the field reallydidn’t exist before Bernays.”24 [notes.html#ch11_24a]William H. Baldwin, a venerated figure in the early days of public relations,also was torn. On the one hand, in a letter Eddie quoted in his memoirs, Baldwinsaid, “Bernays had more to do with developing acceptance for PR and publicrelations counsel than any half dozen other persons.” But in the same letter hemade clear that “I date the emergence of public relations from the work that IvyLee did for John D. Rockefeller Sr. in the Colorado strike.” And in a latermissive Baldwin clarifies his earlier reference to Eddie, writing, “I havealways felt that Bernays did make the first major breakthrough in getting publicawareness of public relations, but that this was but a byproduct ofself-publicizing.”25 [notes.html#ch11_25a]Bill Ruder, a longtime PR consultant in New York, puts it more simply: “Myoverall impression of Bernays is that he only had one client, and that wasEdward L. Bernays.”26 [notes.html#ch11_26a] But Sidney Blumenthal says that wasnatural given the profession he’d chosen. To accuse Eddie of self-promotion,Blumenthal wrote, “is like accusing a fish of swimming.”27 [notes.html#ch11_27a]Eddie probably wouldn’t have minded being accused of touting his ownaccomplishments, since he believed they were substantial and felt he was theonly one able to present them accurately. When it came to shaping his legacy,Eddie unabashedly drew on every PR strategy and tactic he’d tested over alifetime.First he crafted a compelling historical argument about the five stages of PRhistory in America—one that set him apart as the originator of the fifth anddecisive stage. Parts one through three run from colonial days through CorneliusVanderbilt’s “Public be Damned” era of the late 1800s. Stage four, according toEddie’s manifesto, was the “Public be Informed” period, where Ivy Lee helpedbusinesses see how vital it was to give people truthful information. “But as Ilook back on the time,” Eddie wrote, “the emphasis was on words and not onchanged action to conform to public demand and public desire.”Enter stage five: “Period of Mutual Understanding,” a time when public relationscame to mean “not a one-way street for giving information to the public for ourclients but rather one of interpreting the public to the client as a basis fortheir action and, after the action had been carried out, interpreting the clientto the public.”28 [notes.html#ch11_28a] It also happened to be a time when Eddiewas getting back from Paris, opening his PR office, and setting a model for thenew two-way network.Coming from Eddie, such a take on history seemed a bit self-serving, no matterhow accurate it was. But it assumed an aura of respectability when it wasendorsed in 1948 by Eric F. Goldman, an esteemed historian at PrincetonUniversity and former editor of Public Opinion Quarterly. “Bernays moved alongwith the most advanced trends in the public relations field, thinking with,around, and ahead of them,” Goldman wrote in Two Way Street, his treatise on thehistory of public relations in America. In Goldman’s view there were three, notfive, crucial stages in that history, with Lee originating the second and Eddiestanding as father of the third and most critical stage. The kind of PR Eddiesketched out in his pioneering book Crystallizing Public Opinion, Goldman wrote,“marks the third stage in the evolution of public relations thought in theUnited States. The public was not to be fooled, in the immemorial manner of thepress agent. It was not merely to be informed, according to the formula of IvyLee’s 1906 ‘Declaration.’ The public was to be understood—understood as anintricate system of group relationships and by an expert with the technicalequipment, the ethics, and the social view associated with the lawyer, doctor,or teacher. Public relations was to be a two-way street—and a street in a goodneighborhood.”29 [notes.html#ch11_29a]But there were several things Goldman didn’t tell his readers: Eddie had come upwith the idea for Two Way Street, and the idea of Goldman as its author. He’dhelped Goldman find a publisher, and he was deeply involved in the editing andpackaging. And Eddie purchased from Goldman, for $900, “all rights, title, andinterest” in the book.30 [notes.html#ch11_30a]Eddie had learned with clients like American Tobacco and Mack Truck just howmuch more compelling an argument was when it came from a respected, seeminglydisinterested expert. And Goldman, who went on to become a top aide to PresidentLyndon Johnson and later a Johnson biographer, was just the expert Eddie waslooking for. Judging from extensive correspondence between them contained inEddie’s and Goldman’s files at the Library of Congress, it appears that Goldmanwrote the book on his own, although Eddie made lots of editing suggestions, bothtechnical and substantive, many of which Goldman took. Goldman did acknowledgein the book’s foreword the “cooperation” of seven PR pioneers, including Eddie,and he said all the information he’d gathered was “used solely as my historicalsense dictated”—precisely the wording Eddie had proposed in a letter to Goldmandated October 15, 1947, except that Eddie had proposed “dictates” instead of“dictated.”31 [notes.html#ch11_31a]Historians were just one of several influential audiences Eddie courted to makehis case for paternity. He also sweet-talked the press from the very start, withimpressive results. The American Mercury in 1930 ran an eight-page profilearguing that Eddie’s “rank as public relations counsel is at least the equal ofIvy Ledbetter Lee’s” and saying “Eddie can foretell the future.”32[notes.html#ch11_32a] Two years later the Atlantic Monthly published a ten-pagestory that gushed, “Bernays himself is quite the newest type of public relationsspecialist, so intelligent and so free from the conventional inhibitions that heassumes almost the character of a phenomenon.”33 [notes.html#ch11_33a] Aroundthe same time the Jewish Tribune complimented him on “the high standard ofethics which he has always maintained and upon which he insists,” the New YorkWorld-Telegram called him “a prophet to the people for the profit of hisclients,” the Literary Digest wrote that he “helped make press-agentry a‘science,’” and The New Yorker said he “is an idealist of the most profoundorder.”34 [notes.html#ch11_34a] The compliments continued to flow into the1950s, ’60s, ’70s, ’80s, and ’90s, with Printer’s Ink writing in 1959 that Eddiehad “written more and spoken more than anyone else to raise the status of publicrelations,” and the Washington Post in 1984 calling him “the Father of UsAll.”35 [notes.html#ch11_35a]Not all of his coverage was favorable, of course. The trade press in particularwent after him, believing that PR men were costing them advertising revenues bygetting free publicity for clients. Editor and Publisher in 1928 called Eddie“Machiavelli at his best, or Bismarck at his worst,” and in 1929 it said he was“the most modern, smoothest, highest paid and most effective of all the experttribe of propagandists and space grabbers.”36 [notes.html#ch11_36a] The GuildReporter, meanwhile, said he had “turned the space-grabbing racket into ascience.”37 [notes.html#ch11_37a] But Eddie knew the media well enough torealize that even negative stories “made me known to the journalistic field.”38[notes.html#ch11_38a]There were lots of other ways to get out his version of his history, all ofwhich he tapped. He expounded his role in public relations in each universitycourse he taught, and he used his nonprofit foundation to sponsor contests thatbore his name and promulgated his definition of PR. He ran ads in magazines andnewspapers that trumpeted his books, his devotion to all-American values likedemocracy, and his client services, although he later told an interviewer that“we never went out after clients.”39 [notes.html#ch11_39a] And, recognizing theimportance of encyclopedias in defining a profession and its pioneers, he got H.L. Mencken to use his definition of the profession—and his contention that he’dcoined the phrase “public relations counsel”—in his 1945 version of The AmericanLanguage. Eddie’s office, meanwhile, put out a bio that called him “a notable,unique example of how a profession grew up with a man,” and in retirement heused his birthday parties to generate news coverage of himself, nearly all ofwhich matter-of-factly referred to him as the Father of Public Relations.That was more than he’d ever done for any client, but it wasn’t enough.There still was the question of how a future biographer—and he was sure therewould be one—would interpret what he’d done. To be really certain, he quietlytried to recruit someone he felt was up to the job. “He and I had a lengthycorrespondence the last third of his life, and I think he thought I’d write hisbiography. Everything he ever did he sent me a copy of, and it always had ahandwritten note on it,” recalls Ray Eldon Hiebert, Ivy Lee’s biographer and ajournalism professor at the University of Maryland. “I just didn’t want to doanother public relations person.”40 [notes.html#ch11_40a] Similar notes went toother esteemed authors, from Eric Goldman to Daniel J. Boorstin, the formerLibrarian of Congress. But his most promising candidate was PR historian ScottCutlip, with whom he engaged in a decade of letter-writing.Cutlip, who was teaching at the University of Wisconsin, desperately wantedEddie to donate his personal papers to Wisconsin’s State Historical Society. Thesociety was trying to build its PR collection, Cutlip was trying to advance hisacademic career, and Eddie had what everyone acknowledged was the bestcollection of historic material on the profession. Decades later Cutlipdisparaged Eddie’s “indefatigable zeal in promoting himself as the father ofpublic relations and in using excessive hyperbole in the retelling of his publicrelations endeavors.”41 [notes.html#ch11_41a] But in 1955 he had offered onlykind words, writing to Eddie with the promise that “if we were to be favored asthe depository for your papers I would undertake, promptly, the task oforganizing and indexing the papers and then preparation of a book manuscript onyour pioneering work in this field.… I think much of the story of publicrelations’ evolution can be told in terms of your career.”42[notes.html#ch11_42a] Eddie loved the idea of Cutlip as his biographer, but herealized his papers would be more widely read—and available to more potentialbiographers—if he left them to the world’s biggest, most prestigious depository,the Library of Congress.The more than eight hundred boxes of documents he left to the library appear tobe an unabridged version of his professional life, one that includes material heknew would be unflattering to him and his clients. His willingness to tell allsets him apart from most fellow practitioners and suggests that, despite hisresolve to forge a favorable legacy, he was confident that history would judgehim kindly from an honest reading of the record. Yet the fact that he savednearly everything he ever wrote or received also sets him apart, making clearthat he believed he was an epic figure who would remain interesting to futuregenerations. And as he sketched out how he would hand over his papers hecouldn’t resist using them to tout himself. John McDonough, a Library ofCongress historian, wrote after meeting with Eddie in the fall of 1965, “As oneof the country’s leading public relations men, Mr. Bernays is not unmindful ofthe benefits of promoting himself. He therefore proposed the following: When thelegal tangle involving the gift is worked out, LC should make arrangements for aformal, symbolic presentation of the gift.… If LC would supply a photographer,Mr. Bernays would see to it that his guests would number some of the following:Vice President Humphrey, Senator Paul Douglas, Senator Saltonstall, SenatorFulbright, and from the Supreme Court—Abe Fortas and William O. Douglas.”43[notes.html#ch11_43a]The papers would tell part of his story, Eddie believed, but he would tell therest in his 849-page autobiography, immodestly titled, Biography of an Idea:Memoirs of Public Relations Counsel Edward L. Bernays, his 478-page oral historyat Columbia University, and his dizzying collection of books, articles, andspeeches, all of which set a decidedly upbeat, self-important framework for hislife story that he hoped would guide anyone writing about him afterward. “I amnot unmindful of the fact that most people who are interested in setting up anyimage about themselves for posterity had better play a part in doing itthemselves,” Eddie confessed to Boorstin in 1959. “Those who write about otherhuman beings are given to so much ego-projection, so much bias and distortion,that even in one’s lifetime the truth suffers.”44 [notes.html#ch11_44a]Still, he wasn’t content. Posterity would have all his papers and his personalperspective on his life story. But he felt it was important that biographers andhistorians also have a road map to everything he’d written and everything thathad been written about him over his long career, one that included capsuleversions of the writings, since he’d learned long before that busy authors hadlimited attention spans. So, in a truly unusual move, he hired a doctoralstudent to compile a 774-page annotated bibliography on him and his wife Doris.This work—Public Relations, the Edward L. Bernayses and the American Scene: ABibliography—included 24 pages and 185 entries just on things the New York Timeshad said about him. There were hundreds of pages more of long excerpts from eachbook, periodical, and film that mentioned him, or that he contributed to. Andthere were references to nearly every speech he delivered and letter to theeditor he wrote. Borrowing techniques he’d used in promoting the published worksof clients, he sought and received endorsements of the bibliography from sixtypeople. New York Times reporter Will Lissner said he found the summaries “veryinformative and useful,” and Stanley Marcus of Nieman-Marcus said he wasdelighted to have it for his library.Roscoe Ellard, a Columbia Journalism School professor who reviewed an earlier,ninety-two-page version of the bibliography for Editor and Publisher, said itusefully sketched the history of PR in America. Still, he couldn’t helpobserving how odd it was for such a work to be commissioned, noting wryly thatit had happened only twice before that he knew of—with Napoleon and AbrahamLincoln.45 [notes.html#ch11_45a] PR veteran Bill Riis also thought it odd,although not for Eddie, as he wrote, “No one but Bernays would think of sellinghis own personal clipping book. The trick is, it won’t sell.”46[notes.html#ch11_46a] Riss was right: Eddie was stuck with twenty-five cases ofcopies, which he kept in his basement. But the bibliography found its way toscores of libraries and other research centers and is available to anyoneinterested in reading or writing about him.Eddie knew friends and colleagues thought he was a self-promoter. He pleadedguilty, but insisted it wasn’t a crime. “I myself have always thought that I wasmodest personally,” he told an interviewer in 1971, “but I haven’t refrainedfrom occasionally being what might be considered immodest professionally,because unless you present the facts, those who may not be in sympathy with youmay distort them.”47 [notes.html#ch11_47a]* * *Making the case for his position as father of the profession got easier as hegrew older. Fewer and fewer other old-timers were around to contend for thetitle, and critics squirmed at taking on someone as old as Eddie. Also, as hegot grayer and more stooped, and neared the magical age of one hundred, heincreasingly looked like a father figure—or a grandfather figure. And the press,ever seduced by a facile moniker like “Father of Public Relations,” found itever easier to repeat without feeling any obligation to explain.As Eddie aged, his claims got bolder and tougher to substantiate. This may havehappened because his memory was fading or, more likely, because with eachrepetition the tales grew a bit grander, to the point where even he wasn’t surewhat was strictly factual and what was embellished.This pattern was particularly apparent when it came to Ivy Lee, his button-downarchrival for the title of father. Sometimes Eddie’s assertions were simplywrong, as when he said his in-house PR newsletter, Contact, was a “new” idea,even though he must have known that Lee had been publishing a similar bulletinfor at least two years. Other times there were shadings of gray, as when Eddieinsisted he’d coined the term “counsel on public relations” even though he’dacknowledged in 1949 that Lee sometimes “called himself a councillor in (or on)public relations.” And every chance he got, Eddie praised Lee—but cast hisaccomplishments in a way that made clear their limits. “He [Lee] made an impactcertainly in high business quarters, because his clients were theestablishment,” Eddie told a Columbia University interviewer in 1971. “From thestandpoint of professionalizing or rationalizing the field as a) a field ofstudy, b) a profession, c) a field of growing public importance, his influencein my time was not very great.… Lee’s impact remained within his circle, ratherthan with the broader public.”48 [notes.html#ch11_48a]Eddie’s memoirs also drew charges of self-aggrandizement. “Some have said thatthere are gross inaccuracies that cannot be attributed to a normal distortion ofmemory,” said a review in the winter 1966 edition of Public Relations Quarterly,although it didn’t identify the “some” and only vaguely alluded to the allegeddistortions. T. J. “Tommy” Ross, who was Ivy Lee’s partner, wrote that “I got it[Eddie’s autobiography] yesterday and so far have read only the chapter onGeorge Washington Hill. It is outrageous—as well as inaccurate. Even the addressof the company is incorrect.”49 [notes.html#ch11_49a] William H. Baldwin, the PRpioneer, said the book’s “title was conceived in sin and the text whelped ininiquity,” while Cutlip wrote that it contained “errors and exaggerations.”50[notes.html#ch11_50a] And a review in the November 20, 1965, Editor andPublisher said that Simon & Schuster, Eddie’s publisher, had been “bombarded”with “letters saying that Mr. Bernays is ‘not the founder of public relations,nor coiner of the phrase.’” Simon and Schuster officials say that, more thanthirty years later, they can’t locate those letters, and presume they werediscarded years ago.The autobiography also drew its share of praise, however. The New York Timeswrote that “the reader will be swept along by the richness of Mr. Bernays’smaterial,” and the Columbia Journalism Review said it was “a much better bookthan students of his ponderous theoretical works had reason to expect.” EvenEditor and Publisher conceded that it was “only heavy to hold, but is light asgossamer in spirit.”51 [notes.html#ch11_51a]Eddie used the praise to help promote the book, and, as always, he took on hiscritics. When Cutlip suggested the 849-page autobiography was “a bit long andcrowded with detail,” Eddie wrote back saying that “a number of the reviews fromcompetent critics stated that the book wasn’t long enough and didn’t go intodetail enough.” And to the suggestion of errors and embellishments, Eddieresponded, “I welcome your word about errors and exaggerations too, for a secondedition of the book is coming out soon. Naturally, in a 320,000 word book,errors are bound to creep in. And we have caught some typos and others. I’d bedelighted if you were willing to pass them on, so that I can examine them forpossible use. As to exaggerations, I would be glad to have them too, althoughyou may be referring to value judgements, which obviously would differ with theperson making the judgement.”52 [notes.html#ch11_52a]In his later years, when he was out of the limelight of New York and writingless, Eddie made the case for himself as a PR pioneer in a quieter way, personby person. He welcomed historians, public relations luminaries, and others tohis home, giving each a special tour of the “ego shelf” in his den, afloor-to-ceiling collection of volumes by or about him. Then he led themupstairs to his study, where the walls were lined with photos of him withPresident Eisenhower, Thomas Edison, and other figures from history. Specialguests might be invited to dip into his stacks of scrapbooks on the Greencampaign, or Light’s Golden Jubilee, and for critics he would peruse his files,pulling out just the right letter or memo to prove his point.He also hit the speaking circuit more often than ever, pressing hisinterpretation of the history of the profession and his role as pioneer. SueBohle, who runs a PR firm in Los Angeles, remembers one speech he gave at ageninety-nine where all he had for notes were “little torn sheets of paper. Whenhe got done he got a standing ovation. People put their hands beside their facesand said, ‘I don’t know if he really was the first, but who cares.’”53[notes.html#ch11_53a]He even put aside past prejudices and, in old age, joined a few public relationsgroups. He linked up with his fellow practitioners partly because his disdain,and theirs, had tempered over time. An equally important reason was that youngerpractitioners were eager to meet and lionize their last living legend, and hewasn’t about to resist. And when he joined, he did so with that special Bernaysflair. “I was president of the International Public Relations Association ofwhich Ed was one of our very distinguished members,” says William J. Corbett. “Irecall his writing us a letter asking if we have any kind of program to abatethe dues for people over 90, and then he wrote again asking if we could reducethe dues for anyone over 100. I thought that was quite humorous.”54[notes.html#ch11_54a]To his grandchildren, all the tours, speeches, and other promotions sometimesseemed a bit much, especially when they’d watch him buy a book and immediatelyturn to the index to see if he was mentioned. But they tried to keep their senseof humor about it all, and so did Eddie. Hester remembers that “Polly onceextracted the fortune from a cookie and wrote on the back of it, ‘You will bethe Father of Public Relations.’ Eddie loved it.”55 [notes.html#ch11_55a]* * *Eddie also would have loved the debate that continues to swirl over whether hereally was the father of his profession. He would relish the fact that he stillinspires such loyalty from his defenders and such venom from his detractors.University of Michigan historian David Lewis tried to sort out the conflictingevidence in 1970, when he asked PR practitioners nationwide to rank the “mostoutstanding” people in their profession. Ivy Lee got the most first-place votes(22), followed by John W. Hill, Pendleton Dudley, Carl Byoir, and, in fifthplace with sixteen votes, Eddie. Lewis wrote that Lee “is generally regarded asthe first public relations practitioner in the present sense of the term,” whilehis respondents said that Eddie “gave profession its theoretical underpinnings.…First to emphasize social role of public relations.… Made field respectable;elevated it to profession.”56 [notes.html#ch11_56a]The survey, Lewis explained years later, reinforced his belief that Eddie “wouldnot have had to exaggerate at all to be one of the great figures in publicrelations.”57 [notes.html#ch11_57a]Samplings like Lewis’s, however, are just a snapshot of how PR practitioners ata given moment in history feel about their forebears, and given how much longerEddie lived than his rivals and how intensively he promoted himself, it’s almostcertain he would have scored higher if Lewis had repeated his survey twentyyears later. Even more significant is what individual PR people think aboutEddie today.“I think Bernays’s greatest achievement was living so long,” John Reed, arespected PR man in Washington, says when asked to assign Eddie a place in PRhistory. Bill Ehling, who founded the PR department at Syracuse University,takes a similarly dim view: “If we are going to have someone who we can lookback to as making an impact on the field I’d like to think it would be someonewho did something more than getting women to smoke cigarettes and running peopledown to help Coolidge get reelected.”But Shelley Spector, who runs a public relations agency in the New York Cityarea, insists that Eddie “had as much impact on twentieth-century society as hisuncle Sigmund Freud had on his field of psychology.” Ray Gaulke, chief operatingofficer of the Public Relations Society of America, says, “No one this centuryhad as much impact on public opinion as Edward Bernays.” And Harold Burson,founder of the world’s largest PR firm, Burson-Marsteller, says that while Leeclearly came first and was a superior tactician, “from a theoretical standpointon an organized basis I’d probably have to say he [Eddie] was the father.… To myknowledge no one has come up with anything better. We’re still singing off thehymn book that he gave us.”Both sides are right, in part. Bernays clearly wasn’t the first modern PRpractitioner. Ivy Lee deserves that title, or maybe George Michaelis. ButBernays was the profession’s first philosopher and intellectual. He saw the bigpicture when few others did, and he was the first to appreciate the nexusbetween theory and practice or, as he would have said, between the art of PR andthe science. And in doing so he was the first to demonstrate for futuregenerations of PR people how powerful their profession could be in shapingAmerica’s economic, political, and cultural life.Yet Edward L. Bernays’s most compelling claim to the title of Father of PublicRelations goes beyond that art and science. It was his life itself. At work hethought bigger and bolder than anyone had before, to the point of getting womento fall in love with the color green. He brought the same preoccupations home,setting the tone with his wedding-day publicity stunt and feeling morecomfortable offering his daughters PR advice than listening to their growingpains. Most of all, in his relentless bid to shape his own legacy, he offered aperfect portrayal of the full array of PR tactics and strategies, ofmanipulations and embellishments, and how they could be used to redefinereality.Bernays embodied the profession of public relations the same way that fellowLife magazine honorees Martin Luther King Jr. and Henry Ford were the fathers,respectively, of civil rights and the automobile, even though they, like Eddie,weren’t really the first.If he can claim credit as PR’s progenitor, however, Eddie Bernays must alsoaccept at least some responsibility for what his progeny have done. For heremains, in the end, a role model for propagandists who take us to war as wellas those who work for peace. He inspires corporate strategists who peddle deadlytobacco products as well as those who are convinced that doing good is good fortheir business. And he is the father of the spinmeisters who manipulate ourperceptions of politicians as well as those who inspire officeholders to servethe public that elected them."},{"pageContent":"NotesCHAPTER 1: Starting with SYMBOLS1 [chapter1.html#ch1_1].

They helped me assemble the proposal and encouraged me throughmonths of research. They edited an early draft and helped me see the differencebetween newspaper writing and book writing.The staff at the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress went beyond anycall of duty in helping me pore over their Bernays collection and track down hispapers at other libraries. The library also gave me an office and helped meuncover scores of old manuscripts and magazines. Neil Sheehan entertained andinspired me with tales of his days in journalism and his transition to bookwriting, Kurt Maier helped me with his translations and good humor, and BarbaraKraft taught me how to make the library work for me and how to keep my sanity.Two other librarians also steered me through my research: Karen Summerhill ofGeorgetown Law Center, who schooled me in computer searches, and Marc Shechtmanof the Boston Globe library, who helped me answer 101 questions, much as he hasdone for so many Globe projects.Jill Kneerim did everything an agent is supposed to do by helping meconceptualize and sell the book. Then she stayed on to help me in dealing withlegal and ethical questions and in researching the book, writing it, and landinga new editor when my original ones left for another publishing house. Speakingof editors, I define success as my agreeing with half of the changes theysuggest. My editors set a new standard, proposing fixes nearly all of which madethe book better, and showing rather than just telling me what was wrong. Thoseeditors were Peter St. John Ginna and Allison Arieff, who got me started, andBetty A. Prashker and Donna Ryan, who treated my book with as much care as if itwere theirs. Thanks, too, to Crown’s KellyAnn Loughran for shepherding the bookthrough its final stages and responding to my endless faxes and phone calls.Anne Bernays and Justin Kaplan planted the idea of writing the book and werethere throughout with recollections and advice, offering suggestions whenever Iasked for help, which was perpetually, but never interfering. Doris Held wasmore reticent at first, understandably concerned about how I would treat herfather, but she ultimately shared her memories and insights in a way that openedup aspects of Edward Bernays’s character that I hadn’t understood. Anne’s andDoris’s children also were generous in sharing their time and reminiscences.More than a hundred of Eddie’s friends, colleagues, and protégés let meinterview them and see his letters. Barry and Shelley Spector did that and more,sharing eighty hours of Eddie on tape, taking me on a tour of places he’d workedand lived in Manhattan, offering pictures and other memorabilia, and generallyencouraging me along the way. Eddie’s nephew Walter Wiener was equally generouswith his time, steering me through the early years and showering me with advice.Stuart Ewen shared his manuscript on the social history of PR before it waspublished, Scott M. Cutlip offered invaluable historical context, and HaroldBurson helped me understand the profession as it is today and as it was in thepast. The Public Relations Society of America also was tremendously helpful,sharing its mailing list and advice, while the editors of all the major PRnewsletters and journals offered invaluable guidance.Jerold Roschwalb was exceedingly generous in opening up to me the research ofhis wife, Susanne, who died before she could transform her papers and interviewsinto a biography. Also generous with their time and guidance were researchers atColumbia, Stanford, Cornell, Yale, and Harvard Universities, along with those atthe State Historical Society of Wisconsin, the Henry Ford Museum, and theCanajoharie, New York, Library and Art Gallery.My mother, Dorothy Tye, and the rest of my family were there throughout withmoral support and care packages, understanding when I missed family gatheringsand accommodating their busy schedules to mine.Editor Matt Storin of the Boston Globe was great to give me a year’s leave,considering I’d been back only a year after my Nieman Fellowship. Bill and LynneKovach and my Nieman classmates stood by me, as always. So did Tom Palmer, DonSkwar, Steve Kurkjian, and other Globe buddies, along with friends in Boston andWashington. I don’t know what I would have done if Phil and Tamar Warburg hadn’tlent me their home in Washington, along with their continuing emotional support.And while most academic institutions and foundations shied away from a book onpublic relations, Marvin Kalb and Harvard’s Joan Shorenstein Center on thePress, Politics and Public Policy gave me a grant and an equally appreciatedHarvard ID card."},{"pageContent":"IndexThe index that appeared in the print version of this title does not match thepages in your eBook.
