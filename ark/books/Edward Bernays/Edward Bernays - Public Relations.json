It has its own training courses and it can point to a steady growth of conscious public relations activity by profit and non profit institutions and by government agencies with professional public relations counsel in charge. Most important for our purposes, public relations has its own field of litera ture and this book will deal with a vital segment of that field. Literature on public relations is extensive, but a check of public libraries reveals that much of this literature is scattered in books on related subjects and in magazines. Bibliography of the field is extremely limited. Yet bibliography is recognized as a vital tool in providing an organized ap proach to basic knowledge and points of view in any subject. To individuals working in any field of research or study, bibliography is indispensable. Unfor tunately, there has been little bibliography in public relations, principally be cause it is a new subject. There are, to be sure, journals which cover the liter ature in related fields, such as The Public Opinion Quarterly, but these concern themselves chiefly with books, and do not as a rule cover even important material appearing in magazines and other publications. There are two important bibliographies in the general field Propaganda and Promotional Activities \\ edited by Lasswell, Casey and Smith and published by the University of Minnesota Press in 1935; and a comparable volume pub lished by the Princeton University Press in 1946. But even these standard works do not include all the available material on public relations, particularly pam phlets, booklets, quotations from books and so on. Since there is today widespread interest in public relations, and a growing literature about it, it was believed that a bibliography of published material by and about the leading practitioner would provide important data for those who are studying the field both in the universities and outside them. Among other things, such a bibliography would show the scope and ad vance of the profession of public relations counsel, changing attitudes toward the profession, the public's growing understanding of it, and how a point of view has extended and penetrated into many fields of learning. To achieve this pur pose, the items in the bibliography would of necessity have to be abstracts of the original material, in some cases fairly long, in order to give a clear picture of the movement of ideas. This work, then, is concerned with published material by and about Edward L. Bernays, public relations counsel. This choice appeared to be ideal for a bibli ography because of Mr. Bernays' outstanding position as a founding-father, practitioner and theoretician. Time magazine has called him U. S. Publicist No. 1 ; and William H. Bald win of Baldwin and Mermey, in Two-Way Street by Eric Goldman, has said of him: \"Bernays had more to do with developing acceptance of PR and public relations counsel than any half dozen other persons.\""},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Mr. Bernays coined the term \"public relations counsel.\" In Crystallizing Public Opinion (1923), the first full length book on public relations, he defined the principles and techniques of the field. He also broke ground when he gave a course in public relations at New York University in 1923, the first course in that subject ever given at any university. While successfully practicing his profession for over thirty years as counsel for leading American organizations and individuals in partnership with his wife, Doris E. Fleischman, he has written and lectured on public relations, and allied subjects, greatly advancing understanding of these fields. In 1948-50, he was Adjunct Professor of Public Relations at New York University; and in 1950, he conducted classes and seminars as Visiting Professor of Public Relations at the University of Hawaii. Because of the great amount of material by and about him in books, maga zines and published speeches, it was felt that a bibliography based on this ma terial could shed considerable light on the development of public relations in the United States and serve as an invaluable guide for thosewhowish to study the field. Since a complete bibliography on this subject would have been too large and cumbersome, we have omitted newspaper comment or mention, all un published talks by Mr. Bernays and magazine material about him. The bibliography covers the period from 1917 to 1951, and is divided into three parts, consisting of five sections plus an addenda. The first section covers writings by Mr. Bernays appearing in books; the second, writings by Mr. Ber nays in periodicals; the third, published talks by Mr. Bernays; the fourth, books mentioning Mr. Bernays; and the fifth, profiles of Mr. Bernays. Among other things, this bibliography shows how an idea spreads and gains acceptance through the slow absorptive power of society. Listings of Mr. Ber nays' writings and footnote references to them in various books have been included here to indicate how his pioneer thinking in the field has influenced the thinking of others, thereby becoming an integral part of contemporary thought. Together the items in this book show how public relations grew from the days when it affected a relatively small area of American life to the present, when it involves every major aspect of our society. The writings by and about Mr. Bernays summarized in these pages present the impact of public relations on industry, education, the social sciences, labor, the press, book publishing, radio, motion pictures, art, medicine, nursing, banking, trade, management-em ployee relations, women, politics, public opinion, attitude polls, democracy, the armed forces, government and so on. Thus, in covering writings by and about America's leading public relations counsel, this bibliography gives us a history of a key field as it has developed in the United States during the past three decades. Mr. Bernays is now at work on a book about public relations in the United States, which will be published by the University of Oklahoma Press.

Now a standard textbook widely used in universities and widely quoted. Dedicated \"To My Wife, Doris E. Fleischman,\" the work is described as follows in the Foreword by ELB: \"In writing this book I have tried to set down the broad principles that govern the new profession of public relations counsel. These principles I have on the one hand substantiated by the findings of psychologists, sociologists, and newspapermen Ray Stannard Baker, W. G. Bleyer, Richard Wash- burn Child, Elmer Davis, John L. Given, Will Irwin, Francis E. Leupp, Walter Lippmann, William Mac- Dougall, Everett Dean Martin, H. L. Mencken, Rollo Ogden, Charles J. Rosebault, William Trotter, Oswald Garrison Villard, and others to whom I owe a debt of gratitude for their clear analyses of the public's mind and habits; and on the other hand, I have illustrated these principles by a number of specific examples which serve to bear them out. I have quoted from the men listed here, because the ground covered by them is part of the field of activity of the public relations counsel. The actual cases which I have cited were selected because they explain the application of the theories to practice. Most of the illustrative material is drawn from my personal experience; a few examples from my observation of events. I have preferred to cite facts known to the general public, in order that I might explain graphi cally a profession that has little precedent, and whose few formulated rules have necessarily a limitless number and variety of applications. This profession in a few years has developed from the status of circus agent stunts to what is obviously an important posi tion in the conduct of the world's affairs. If I shall, by this survey of the field, stimulate a scientific atti tude towards the study of public relations, I shall feel that this book has fulfilled my purpose in writing it.\" Part I, Scope and Functions, discusses \"The Scope of the Public Relations Counsel,\" \"The Public Relations Counsel; The Increased and Increasing Importance of the Profession,\" and \"The Function of a Special Pleader.\" Part II, The Group and Herd \"What Constitutes Public Opinion?\", \"Is Public Opinion Stubborn or Malleable?\", \"The Interaction of Public Opinion with the Forces That Help to Make It,\" \"The Power of Interacting Forces That Go to Make up Public Opinion,\" \"An Under standing of the Fundamentals of Public Motivation Is Necessary to the Work of the Public Relations Counsel,\" \"The Group and Herd Are the Basic Mechanisms of Public Change,\" and \"The Applica tion of These Principles.\" Part III, Technique and Method, \"The Public Can Be Reached Only Through Established Mediums of Communication,\" \"The Interlapping Group Formations of Society, The Continuous Shifting of Groups, Changing Con ditions and the Flexibility of Human Nature Are All Aids to the Counsel on Public Relations,\" and \"An Outline of Methods Practicable in Modifying the Point of View of a Group.\" Part IV, Ethical Relations, analyzes the press and other media of communication in reference to the public relations counsel, and the obligations of the public relations counsel to the public as a special pleader. Beginning with the statement, \"A new phrase has come into the language counsel on public rela tions, what does it mean?\", Crystallizing Public Opinion ends with the paragraph, \"It is in the crea tion of a public conscience that the counsel on public relations is destined, I believe, to fulfill his highest usefulness to the society in which he lives.\" In the preface to the new edition, ELB also says: \"In the ten years that have elapsed since this book was written, events of profound importance have taken place. During this period, many of the principles set forth in the book have been put to the test and have been proven true. The book, for instance, empha sized ten years ago that industrial organizations dealing with the public must take public opinion into consideration in the conduct of their affairs. We have seen cases in the past decade where the pub lic has actually stepped in and publicly supervised industries which refused to recognize this truth. The field of public relations counsel has developed tre mendously in this period. But the broad basic prin ciples, as originally set forth are as valid today as they were then, when the profession was . . . com paratively new. ... It seems appropriate that this new edition . . . should appear at a time when the new partnership of government, labor and industry has brought public relations and its problems to the fore. The old group relationships that make up our society have undergone and are undergoing marked changes. The peaceful harmonizing of all the new conflicting points of view will be dependent, to a great extent, upon an understanding and application by leaders of public relations and its technique. In the future, each industry will have to act with in creasing understanding of its relationship to govern ment, to other industries, to labor, to stockholders and to the public. Each industry must be cognizant of new conditions and modify its conduct to conform to them if it is to maintain the good-will of those upon whom it depends for its very life. This principle applies not only to industry; it applies to every kind of organization and institution that uses special pleading, whether it be for profit or for any other cause. The new social and economic structure in which we live today demands this new approach to the public. Public relations has come to play an important part in our life. It is hoped that this book may lead to a greater recognition and application of sound public relations principles.\""},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Propaganda. N. Y: Horace Liveright, Inc., 1928. 159pp. An original study of the \"new propaganda\" in busi ness, politics, education, social service, art, and science; a standard textbook on university lists of recommended or required reading. Sub-titled \"The Public Mind in the Making,\" and dedicated \"To My Wife, Doris E. Fleischman,\" publisher's comment appears on jacket: \"When Mr. Bernays' Crystallizing Public Opinion was published five years ago, H. L. Mencken said: 'I only hope that he returns to it anon, and writes a bigger and more exhaustive book.' This . . . is, in a sense, the answer to Mr. Mencken's suggestion. Propaganda has be come so necessary a part of every idea and organiza tion striving for public acceptance that its possibili ties and . . . limits need to be defined. In this book Mr. Bernays analyzes the relation of this new force to the unprecedented conditions which have called it into being. He discusses the reasons for propa ganda, the new type of propaganda, the new propa gandist, and especially the new media the radio, telephoto, and other epoch-making mechanisms for the transmission of ideas. He approaches the ques tion of public relations from the standpoint of the new psychology, and of the old. Finally he discusses the new trends in big business, social service, educa tion, art, politics, and other forces of present-day life. The book is the first contribution to the subject of propaganda from the standpoint of theory and practice, by one who has followed both phases. Mr. Bernays has been instrumental in developing the new profession of public relations counsel. Out of an experience drawn from fifteen years of activity with all kinds of individuals and movements seeking public good will, he sets forth the ideas which his creative mind has developed in the course of practical experience.\" ELB begins Chapter I, \"Organizing Chaos,\" with: \"From our leaders and the media they use to reach the public, we accept the evidence and the demarcation of issues bearing upon public ques tions; from some ethical teacher, be it a minister, a favorite essayist, or merely prevailing opinion, we accept a standardized code of social conduct to which we conform most of the time. . . .\" Quoting H. G. Wells, other authors, college professors, businessmen, the New York Times; stating numerous statistics; re ferring to Walter Lippmann, Trotter, LeBon, Gra ham Wallas, as well as J. P. Morgan and George Ol- vany while giving numerous detailed illustrations from ELB's own experience the ten subsequent chapters analyze and discuss \"The New Progaganda,\" \"The New Propagandists,\" \"The Psychology of Public Relations,\" \"Business and the Public,\" \"Propaganda and Political Leadership,\" \"Women's Activities and Propaganda,\" \"Propaganda for Educa tion,\" \"Propaganda in Social Service,\" \"Art and Science,\" and \"The Mechanics of Propaganda.\" The last chapter contains the statement, \"If the public relations counsel can breathe the breath of life into an idea and make it take its place among other ideas and events, it will receive the public attention it merits. There can be no question of his 'contami nating news at its source' \" and ends, \". . . Un doubtedly the public is becoming aware of the meth ods which are being used to mold its opinions and habits. If the public is better informed about the processes of its own life, it will be so much the more receptive to reasonable appeals to its own interests. No matter how sophisticated, how cynical the public may become about publicity methods, it must re spond to the basic appeals, because it will always need food, crave amusement, long for beauty, re spond to leadership. If the public becomes more intelligent in its commercial demands, commercial firms will meet the new standards. If it becomes weary of the old methods used to persuade it to accept a given idea or commodity, its leaders will present their appeals more intelligently. Propaganda will never die. . . .

Ber- nays Has Contributed American Academy of Political and Social Science: Annals. Philadelphia, The Academy. Vol. 179, May 1935. 287pp. This volume, devoted to a discussion with the overall title \"Pressure Groups and Propaganda,\" contains an article by ELB on \"Molding Public Opinion\" which considers \"some of the high spots in the back ground of public opinion, the field in which the coun sel on public relations works.\" After analyzing the meaning of such terms as \"the public,\" and \"group leadership,\" and such factors as symbols and human motivations, he discusses four \"specific steps that have to be taken in formulating a public relations program.\" These are: (1) formulation of objectives; (2) analysis of the public's attitude towards the in dustry and the services it renders; (3) a study of this analysis with a view to keynoting the approach to the public in terms of action by the industry; this is to be followed by the formulation of policy and a program for educating the public; (4) the carrying out of this program by dramatizing it through the various media of communication, pp. 82-87. Annals: \"Public Education for Democ racy,\" Vol. 198, Jul 1938. 253pp. An analysis of public relations techniques and media which can be used for the propagation and strength ening of democracy. \"Today, democracy is challenged on all sides. It is the obligation of all those who are interested in democracy to do all in their power to strengthen it in order to preserve it. This demands the building up of an inner bulwark of dynamic belief and con fidence in our democracy by all the people.\" ELB continues: \"Freedom of self-expression is the essence of democracy. This freedom has been guaran teed by our American Constitution, in the Bill of"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Rights. It includes freedom of speech, of assembly, of the press, of petition, of religion. These freedoms in themselves create conflicts of opinion. Freedom of opinion is, therefore, an important element in democracy.\" Pointing out that \"not until recently has our democracy been assailed from within and from without by opinions contrary to it,\" ELB also says that since \"it is part of our democratic Amer ican heritage to abhor censorship, . . . the wall against which the anti-democratic missiles are hurled [must be made] . . . strong and impregnable, capa ble of standing firm against any onslaught. If we are to maintain the democracy upon which our system rests, we must depend upon the acceptance and de fense of democracy by all the people. ... Of course, the very processes of democracy work toward these ends through universal education, through our po litical institutions, and through the exercise of civil liberties. . . . But, in these critical times, we must, in addition, make use of all the available socially sound methods to help in the upholding of our de mocracy. . . . To engage in this task of public education, we must understand how to reach the people with democracy's message, how to tell them what democracy means, so that they will understand it and appreciate it. Lip service to democracy is not enough. It must be implemented by the will and action of the people to preserve democracy at all costs.\" Subsequently, the analysis includes a discussion of the \"Means of Communication,\" \"Importance of Private Enterprise,\" \"Linking Private Enterprise with Democracy,\" and [the necessity of] \"Presenting Democracy's Values\": \"It is thus our duty,\" ELB concludes, \"to strengthen the program of public education and public information to the end that everyone in America may understand the social significance of democracy, and its value for every man, woman, and child. What we must strive for is the achievement of that inner faith and devotion to democracy within our people which will make them active against encroachments on the essential liber ties which are the basis of democracy.\" pp. 124- 127. . Annals: \"The Engineering of Consent,\" Vol. 250, Mar 1947. 183pp. ELB urges recognition of \"the significance of mod ern communications not only as a highly organized mechanical web but as a potent force for social good or possible evil\"; declares that \"leaders ... of major organized groups such as industry, labor, or units of government, . . . with the aid of techni cians . . . who have specialized in utilizing the channels of communication, have been able to ac complish purposefully and scientifically what we have termed 'the engineering of consent'\"; explains that \"this phrase quite simply means the use of an engineering approach ... action based only on thorough knowledge of the situation and on the ap plication of scientific principles and tried practices to the task of getting people to support ideas and programs. Any person or organization depends ulti mately on public approval, and is therefore faced with the problem of engineering the public's consent to a program or goal. ...\" Among other sugges tions, he \"outlines basic principles and techniques of engineering consent . . . based on four prerequi sites: 1. Calculation of resources, both human and physical; i.e., the manpower, the money, and the time available for the purpose; 2. As thorough knowledge of the subject as possible; 3. Determina tion of objectives, subject to possible change after research; specifically, what is to be accomplished, with whom and through whom; 4. Research of the public to learn why and how it acts, both individu ally and as a group. Only after this preliminary groundwork has been firmly laid is it possible to know whether the objectives are realistically at tainable. . . . Strategy, organization and activities will be geared to the realities of the situation.\" pp. 113, 120.

These men must have an intellectual grasp of the world in which they live and operate. . . .

Ettinger, Karl E., ed. \"Public Relations Directory and Yearbook.\" Vol. I, 1945. N. Y: Public Rela tions Directory and Yearbook, Inc. 855pp. In the \"Editorial Section,\" ELB contributes a chapter entitled: \"Public Relations Counsel Evolution of a Profession.\" This is an historical survey and analysis of the profession. \"Since 1900,\" ELB says, \"there have been four periods of evolution in public relations as a profession in the United States. The first 1900-1914 was a battle between muckraking on the one hand and white-washing publicity efforts on the other. The second 1914-1918 was marked by an effort by our government to sell the American people our war aims and war ideals in World War I. The third 1919-1929 saw public relations activities in the industrial field developing, in part, from principles and practices successfully tested in the Great War. Since 1929, American public relations activities have been devoted mainly to efforts in commerce and industry, to bring about adjustment between private interest and public responsibility. These last two periods 1919 to date have brought forth public relations literature and periodicals, a strengthening of ethical standards, a broadening of scientific prac tice, a spread of academic study and research, and a general recognition of the importance of the new profession by the great social forces of our country.\" ELB then traces the history of definitions of the term \"profession.\" He quotes Crystallizing Public Opinion, which he published in 1923, and in which he defined the term \"public relations counsel,\" which he had coined. \"The literature has expanded,\" he continues. \"In 1928, our analysis, 'Propaganda The Public Mind in the Making' was published. Our organization for ten years issued 'Contact,' a four-page leaflet on public relations. In 1934, we were successful in in stigating at Princeton University the publication of a bibliography, 'A Reference Guide to Public Opin ion.' We assisted Princeton in the inauguration of the Public Opinion Quarterly. . . . In 1937, we surveyed public relations training at American uni versities and found that throughout the country there were many courses preparing men and women for this new profession. The findings were published in a pamphlet 'Universities Pathfinders of Public Opinion.' \" [See page 9 of this bibliography]. After surveying the courses in public relations and related subjects given at American universities, ELB quotes the definitions of \"public relations\" and \"public relations counsellor\" given in the Dictionary of Sociology, published in 1943. \"Thus,\" ELB con tinues, \"we see the principles set in 'Crystallizing Public Opinion' twenty years previously, and in 'Propaganda' five years thereafter continually being validated: groups and leaders are the basic mechanisms of public change ; groups and leaders can be reached through established media of communica tion, with the application of insight and method; and there is a definite ethical standard to guide the work. Public relations, engineering of consent, opinion management, the techniques of leadership, or what ever it may be called, has exerted a powerful influ ence on the world in every phase of activity. . . . The counsel on public relations continues to play an increasingly growing role in bringing about better adjustment of all the constituent groups of our society.\" In his historical survey of public relations, ELB discusses the role of the muckrakers, Theodore Roosevelt, General Motors, General Electric, Amer ican Telephone & Telegraph, Light's Golden Jubilee which ELB handled and other high points in the development of the profession. The chapter concludes with a list of books by ELB. Friedrich, C. J., and Mason, Edward S., eds. \"Public Policy. A Yearbook of the Graduate School of Public Administration, Harvard Uni versity.\" Cambridge, Mass: Graduate School of Public Administration, 1942. 275pp. Part I, \"War Morale and Civil Liberties,\" contains a chapter by ELB on \"The Integration of Morale,\" pp. 18-32; \"To achieve a continuously strong mo rale, we need physical and emotional well-being, a common goal, common leaders we can trust, and a belief in one another.\" Footnote reference in David Riesman's chapter on \"Civil Liberties in Transition\" to ELB's books Crystallizing Public Opinion and Propaganda, p. 82. In this discussion of wartime morale, ELB calls for a threefold approach to make \"America's morale . . . impregnable. . . . First, activities aimed at speaking up for democracy, defining, explaining, ex pounding what democracy is and is not; second,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"activities aimed at strengthening democracy, making it work better, so that all may know what we are fighting for; third, a morale commission appointed by the government to give counsel and advice to men in the government so that they may function more democratically and more efficiently. . . . Our first real line of defense is in our minds. They can ensure that our arms shall defend what they were created to defend. ... A strong national morale is behavior which affects our national interest. . . . Group morale is the fusion of individual morales. . . . Certain basic premises underlie the building of a strong morale: (1) The American people have already committed themselves, their money and their manpower to the war effort. They have pro vided for the physical defenses. (2) Democratic leadership in government is called for to provide the psychological defenses that will fill the need for psychological and physical security.\" To build mo rale, ELB recommends democratic activities per suasion, suggestion, education, above all, truth. Specifically ELB recommends: (1) The education of the public in the meanings and importance of democracy; (2) one centralized government author ity to give out facts, to correlate and coordinate the activities of the many scattered information agencies this body to be headed by a technician in mass communications; (3) make democracy work better; (4) a master plan for public relations in morale building to be worked out \"by technicians drawn from the fields of the social sciences, sociology, psy chology, ethnology, adult education, economics, the army, the navy, public opinion, communications, public relations.\" ELB concludes: \"To achieve a continuously strong morale, we need physical and emotional well-being, a common goal, common lead ers we can trust, and a belief in one another.\" Gaige, Crosby. \"Dining with My Friends: Adven tures with Epicures.\" N.

BERNAYS In Periodicals Advertising and Selling. \"A Public Relations Counsel States His Views.\" Vol. 8, No. 7, Jan 26, 1927, pp. 31, 76. ELB discusses the modern public relations counsel and /or propagandist, showing that he is not merely the old-time press agent who fed stories to the news papers, but a man whose work is related to that of every institution which communicates ideas to the public. The modern propagandist is more concerned with what his client is and does than with what he says; he sets ideas in motion and makes events which will move public thought. ELB differentiates be tween advertising and news, maintaining that news is news whether or not it advertises some product. He urges that all material submitted for publication should bear a mark of origin. \"The public relations counsel is continually cre ating events, changing and modifying acts, now adding some actualities to life, now subtracting others, to accomplish his ends and make the pub lic receptive to his cause. In this work he must be"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"10 keenly alive to public consciousness.\" In discussing the relationship of news to advertising, Mr. Bernays says: \"Most men who have discussed this whole question have treated only of the press. . . . But in a sense the same relationship is true of all methods of reaching the public. . . . The acid test applied to it [news material] is its value to the reader of the particular journal as understood by the editor, who knows the policy, the aim, the ideals of his particular journal. On this test only must it ride or fall.\" \"What Future for Radio Advertising?\" Feb 8, 1928. ELB says: \"Advertising revenues have made the press powerful and economical, and have made it able to present the news without bias or prejudice. Aside from any other consideration, the press should allow nothing to interfere with the advertising rev enue that it gets as a safeguard in protecting its independence. Is not the surest way to insure this freedom the linking up with the ever-growing and spreading radio by harnessing it to the press and making it a source of revenue to itself as well as a source of news and advertising to the public?\" _. \"Molding Public Opinion.\" See Ad denda, Item 1. American City. \"Better Government Through P.R.\" Vol. LXII, No. 3, Mar 1947, pp. 79-80. ELB says: \"The American city today is a complex social-economic pattern for achieving the aims of a democratic society. It strives to increase the general welfare of its citizens through public health, safety, legal security, education and the other factors of wholesome, efficient living. Not so long ago munici pal government was largely a system of politics, spoils, and patronage. Today the city is the com bined progress of all its citizens\" ELB discusses the need for New Concepts of Democratic Leader ship, Determining Objectives, Importance of Tim ing, and Planned Events and Research, in reference to the city's \"important public-relations responsi bility.\" He says: \"A public relations program for a city has a triple function. It must throw a clear light on the government's activities in order to be of value to the government itself. It must interpret the gov ernment's aims to the people to secure their interest and action. And, lastly, it must interpret the public needs and desires to the government . . . [but] whatever the goals, the public relations program must base its efforts on favorable actions of govern ment itself. What the government does, not what it says, is the important factor in success. . . . Iso lated events and sporadic publicity are of little value. A good public relations program for city government demands continuous effort to keep in contact with the public. Underlying this public relations program must be continuous and careful research of the actual functioning of the city. If the leaders do not keep their house in order, no public relations program will protect them from the possibility of unfavorable notice and attack. Any municipal public relations program must be based on activities that are in the public interest. . . .\" As \"helpful . . . guides to effective public relations planning, strategy, and techniques,\" ELB also recommends \"two bibliog raphies ... one published by the University of Minnesota Press, the other by ... Princeton University Press. ...\" American Journal of Nursing. \"The Nursing Profession A Public Relations Viewpoint.\" Vol. 45, No. 5, May 1945. pp. 351-353. Editorial note: \"Mr. Bernays is a very well known public relations specialist, described by Time maga zine as U. S. Publicist No. 1, who has solved public relations problems for corporations, philanthropists, institutions, industrial organizations, and individu als. He is on the National Public Relations Com mittee of the American Red Cross and worked with the Committee on the Cost of Medical Care.\" ELB says: \"I can think of no better advice to give than to suggest that you look at yourselves and apply your own scientific attitude to a consideration of your problem of adjustment with the public, then to find out why the public reacts to you as it does, and then to take the action required on your own reorientation, and a reorientation of your public.\" \"The Medical Profession and Nursing.\" Vol. 45, No. 11, Nov 1945, pp. 907-914. After describing the effects of World War II on the health field and the professions of nursing and med icine, ELB reports on a survey he made among ci vilian doctors and leading medical authorities based on a questionnaire which included the following: (1) What effect do doctors think the war has had on medical-nursing relationships and on nursing skills? (2) What maladjustments exist between these two professions? (3) What do doctors favor as regards use of practical nurses; and more extensive use of professional nurses through the Social Security Act or other federal legislation, and through voluntary payment plans? ELB gives in considerable detail the replies, comments and recommendations of physi cians regarding the nursing profession and the rela tions between doctors and nurses. He concludes: \"(1) Evidently physicians think well of nurses when they think of them at all. But the unfortunate fact is that the medical profession takes the nursing pro fession too much for granted. The nurses must act to correct this. They must tell the medical profession what they are doing, how they are doing it, and why. The nursing profession must carry on educational activities aimed at the physician, as an individual and in groups. (2) Maladjustments between the pro fessions seem to be due to misunderstanding as well as to the basic situation. There is much nurses can accomplish by being co-operative and understanding. Most important, of course, is the economic factor. Nurses' salaries are too small for their needs. . . . Yet they are too great for the public to stand. Nurses, doctors and public must agree on the best way to handle medical care in the United States. Nurses, as individuals and through their organizations, should study all proposals, legislative or otherwise, which affect the medical care of the American people, and act vigorously to support those in the public interest."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"11 . . . Good health for the American people is the aim of both medical and nursing professions and the pro fessions must cooperate effectively toward this end.\" \"Opinion Holders Appraise Nursing\" Vol. 45, No. 12, Dec 1945. pp. 1005-1011. In this article, ELB reports the results of a survey he conducted among \"newspaper and magazine editors, radio commentators, news photographers, cartoon ists, columnists, authors, radio script writers, book publishers, lecturers, artists and illustrators, out standing opinion molders in other fields,\" to deter mine what they think of the nursing profession. Sum marizing their opinions, ELB says: (1) A great majority of Americans have a very high regard for the women performing nursing services; they pay great tribute to the war effort of the nursing pro fession; most of the opinion molders believe there is great room for improvement in the performance of nurses in present-day hospitals and private practice, particularly in public health and industrial nursing. (2) In the economic sphere the public opinion mold ers believe the cost of nursing is too high; most of them have not thought out the problem of how it is to be lowered ; a minority is aware the answer lies in a change of the present methods of distributing and paying for nursing services. (3) The largest group of criticisms of the nursing profession is that aimed at the high cost of nursing services; a smaller number are directed at the personality faults of some nurses, such as lack of human sympathy, laziness, etc.; nursing education is also criticized. (4) Recommenda tions of the opinion leaders strongly emphasize the need of a public relations program for professional nurses and of greater psychological understanding of patients by nurses; many public opinion molders stress the need for economic adjustments in sal aries, nursing costs and system of payment and distribution. ELB describes the method of survey, gives line of questions asked, quotes typical replies in various categories and breaks down the replies by per centages. \"What Government Officials Think about Nursing. 1 ' Vol. 46, No. 1, Jan 1946. pp. 22-26. ELB reports on the survey he conducted \"to learn the attitudes of public officials toward the nursing profession, past, present and future.\" His question naire was sent to \"a cross-section of the men and women in federal, state and city administrations throughout the country.\" Results of the nationwide study \"were checked against personal interviews with government officials.\" Summarizing his findings, ELB says that federal, state and city officials think: (1) Nurses made an excellent contribution to the war effort; (2) the quality of work performed by profes sional nurses is good in public health work, private hospitals and other institutions, and in private prac tice, but somewhat less desirable in public hospitals; (3) through public relations activities the nursing profession should educate the public and government officials about nurse training, the services nurses are performing, etc. ; (4) nursing salaries should be raised, nursing education improved, nursing costs lowered; (5) government should provide more funds toward nursing education and for training practical nurses; (6) the Social Security Act should apply to wider groups of professional and practical nurses, partic ularly to nurses engaged in public health and hospital practice; (7) nursing service provision should be in cluded in voluntary prepayment plans for hospital and medical care. \"Hospitals and the Nursing Professions.\" Vol. 46, No. 2, Feb 1946, pp. 110-113. ELB reports on the nationwide survey he conducted among hospital administrators of all kinds in an effort to \"measure present and future relations be tween the nursing profession and hospital adminis trators.\" The survey revealed the following major opinions of hospital administrators: (1) World War II tended to make worse the quality of civilian hospi tal nursing service, nursing education, and nursing skills and methods; (2) good personnel is scarce in staff nursing, administrators of nursing services, nursing teachers; (3) student nurses are often ex ploited by hospitals; (4) private duty nurses are a ''luxury\" commodity which costs too much and needs too much supervision; (5) the nurse's economic position should be improved by salary increases, but nursing trade unions should be discouraged; (6) Negro nurses should be used mainly in Negro insti tutions; (7) hospital personnel policies need drastic revision, since they cause difficulty between hospital heads and staff nurses; (8) nursing leaders should do more on behalf of their membership; (9) nurse place ment services work fairly well on the whole; (10) the patient's welfare should be the first consideration in all decisions made on hospital administration. ELB gives the questions he asked hospital ad ministrators and breaks down their replies on a per centage basis. He suggests that \"public relations activities devoted frankly to this end would go a long way to remove barriers which now prevent the nursing profession and hospital administrations from working together in the best interests of themselves and the public they serve.\" \"The Armed Services and the Nursing Pro fession\" Vol. 46, No. 3, Mar 1946. pp. 166-169. ELB reports on a survey he made to ascertain what World War II veterans from all services thought of the nursing profession. The questionnaire was sent to a cross section of Army and Navy officers and enlisted men, both in service and already returned to civilian life; to officials of the Veterans Adminis tration; to veterans of the Army and Navy Nurse Corps. Giving the replies which the survey elicited, ELB breaks them down by percentages, and sums them up as follows: (1) Overwhelmingly America's fighting men and women believe the nursing profes sion made a great contribution to victory in World War II, and the average war nurse performed her duties well; (2) among problems between professional nurses and other members of the armed forces the replies cited rank, personality faults, complaints against army regulations restricting nurses, etc.;"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"12 (3) suggestions for improvements in nursing educa tion included better training in psychology and psy chosomatic medicine; greater emphasis on cultural subjects in nurse training; higher standards in the professional nursing skills, etc; (4) a wider use of men nurses was favored; ELB also quotes a number of suggestions made by respondents for improving rela tions between nurses and various groups with which they come in contact, as well as comments on whether the Army and Navy Nurse Corps should be reconstituted so as to include enlisted personnel and non-commissioned officers. In conclusion, ELB recommends that nurses \"in tensify and utilize\" the \"huge reservoir of good will toward the norsing profession which has been built up among millions of war veterans. . . . Nurses should, individually and through their organizations, participate in activities to promote the welfare of needy, unfortunate, disabled and sick veterans. The nursing profession can take a leading position in strengthening and improving the operation of the Veterans Administration, in seeing that it meets the needs of the many millions of Americans who will be dependent on it in one way or another, for finan cial, vocational or other assistance. In doing this, the nursing profession will be advancing its own interest and performing a valuable public service.\" \" Nurses and Their Professional Organiza tions\" Vol. 46, No. 4, Apr 1946. pp. 229-233. To ascertain how nurses feel about professional or ganizations as to scope, efficiency and policies, past, present and future, ELB conducted a survey of the nursing profession. In this article he gives his ques tionnaire and breaks down the replies by percentages. Survey revealed that nurses are \"joiners,\" that most of them are active in their professional organizations and read nursing publications. Most of them said relations between nurses and their professional or ganizations could be improved, suggesting ways of doing this. ELB also quotes replies on trade unions, economic improvement, Negro nurses, men nurses, practical nurses, etc. From the survey, ELB concludes that \"serious gaps exist in the relationships of nurses with their professional organizations.\" To bridge this gap, he suggests \"reorienting member nurses from the con cept of 'belonging' to the concept of leadership.\" To ward this end he recommends \"that (1) national groups should re-examine their structures and achieve greater coordination between and within major groups; (2) as individuals, nurses can train themselves for leadership as they trained themselves for their profession.\" \" Nursing and Community Groups.\" Vol. 46, No. 5. May 1946. pp. 297-300. To learn community group opinions about nursing, ELB sent out questionnaires to a cross section of group leaders throughout the country. Responses came from officers of youth groups; school, college and educational groups; patriotic, political, social and civic groups; women's groups; religious groups; and foreign language groups. Analyzing these replies, ELB reports their \"composite answer\"; e.g., nurs ing's contribution to victory in World War II was impressive and exemplary; public health nursing agencies are the most \"liberal\" branch of the pro fession; most graduate nurses work cooperatively with other community groups; nursing costs are too high; nurses could use a better general education; etc. After giving replies in detail and breaking them down by percentages, ELB concludes: \"The volun tary membership organizations of the United States, large and small, can become powerful lay supporters of the nursing profession's desire for more effective integration into the broad pattern of social action in the United States. . . . The good will that exists in this group has little depth, and little foundation in knowledge upon which to rest. . . . The only safeguard is to keep this public and other publics informed of what nursing is doing, what it intends to do, and what are its reasons. This, too, indicates the importance of supplying facts and points of view for whatever changes the nursing profession believes are essential to the public welfare and its own pro gress. Certainly these important groups of the public can help to further sound, common goals in the public interest but only if public relations activ ities are aimed to intensify and broaden the existing good will.\" \"Educators Appraise Nursing.\" Vol. 46, No. 6, Jun 1946, pp. 372-375. ELB discusses the problem of recruiting of nurses and the influence of educators in grade schools, high schools and colleges on decisions regarding careers, based on a survey of a nationwide cross-section of the teaching profession. \" Nurses and Business.\" Vol. 46, No. 7, Jul 1946. pp. 475-477. ELB reports the findings of his nationwide survey among American business leaders to ascertain their opinions about nursing. Breaking down replies by percentages, he says the survey shows that \"leaders of commerce and industry respect nursing as a pro fession in theory; in practice, they don't.\" The majority of businessmen thought hospitals and other institutions caring for the public's health should deal with nurses the way a business firm deals with its employees; that nurses receive sufficient pay now; that the costs of nursing are not too high. However, they urged action for bettering nurses' conditions through professional nursing organizations, and in creased voluntary support of hospitals. Most businessmen also thought relations between the business community and the nursing profession could be improved. Suggestions: (1) Educate the businessman through hard-hitting, more extensive public relations programs on every professional level; (2) educate the nurse to participate in com munity affairs; (3) raise educational and professional standards of nurses. \"What we must do,\" ELB con cludes, \"is to make the businessman realize that he will not get the type of service that he desires unless he helps to improve the status of the entire pro fession.\""},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"13 \"Social Scientists Look at the Nursing Pro fession.\" Vol. 46, No. 8, Aug 1946. pp. 518-520. ELB here reports on a survey he made among social scientists at Yale, Wisconsin, Columbia, Chicago and other colleges and universities on the question: \"What can the nursing profession do to reconcile the contradictions which now prevent fulfillment of its goal of service to American society?\" \"Summed up,\" ELB says, \"(1) They stress the vital need for professional recognition; (2) almost unanimously, they urge that the nurse's economic status be improved; (3) they want standards of edu cation and research in nursing raised; (4) they advo cate that particular care be used in selecting the type of individuals for the nursing profession, stressing the factor of personality with emphasis on the need of warm, sympathetic characteristics and a more spiritual outlook; (5) they recommend to the nursing profession that it organize for broad public health activities, to win the support of the public; (6) they would like to see the relationship between doctors and nurses denned and improved, with the aim of offering the very best health service for the American people. To accomplish these goals, they urge the nursing profession to educate the American people on what nursing can do, and what the public must do to get the service it wants. A public relations program is their answer.\" \"America Looks at Nursing A Summa tion.\" Vol. 46, No. 9, Sept 1946. pp. 590-592. Editorial note: \"About a year ago Mr. Bernays, public relations consultant, undertook to make a series of investigations into what different groups of people think about nursing. Results of his studies have been presented each month in the Journal since November 1945. The present article summarizes the series.\" ELB concludes this article by urging nurses to appraise their profession, and to inform the public about their services, problems, etc. \"What Patients Say about Nurses.\" Vol. 47, No. 2, Feb 1947. pp. 93-96. ELB reports on a survey he made among ex-patients to determine what they think about nurses and nurs ing. His questionnaire was sent to a group selected from Who's Who in America and to members of the Blue Cross hospitalization plan in Boston, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Allentown, Pennsylvania and Rock- ford, 111. Most patients were pleased with their nurses and the nursing service they received, but there were also complaints and \"intelligent criticism.\" Most pa tients also thought nurses should receive better pay. After breaking down all the replies by percentage, ELB concludes: \"The majority of laymen, ex- patients, the general public . . . just don't have very much understanding of the crux of the nursing problem. The problem ... is the satisfactory ad justment of the conflict between her (the nurse's) tra ditional role as a self-sacrificing servant of mankind, and her need for professional status and adequate pay.\" He urges that nurses undertake \"a public rela tions campaign to educate the public ... to a clearer understanding of the nursing profession's dilemma.\" .. \"A Better Deal for Nurses.\" Nov 1947. ELB says the nursing profession can achieve its aims \"through enlisting the understanding and support of social groups.\" ELB advises the nursing profession that in order to establish recognition for their services and in order to maintain better economic security, they must be made aware of the influence of public opinion and \"of broader social forces than the nursing profession itself.\" They must be aware of the interrelation between many social groups working together and the need to arouse these groups to an understanding of the problems of the nursing profession. \"In our highly complicated society, no one special interest or group, whether teachers, preachers, doctors, lawyers, or nurses, dictates or governs its own destiny. Every section of our population depends upon other groups, and no individual group is sufficiently powerful or influential to bring about its desires independently and without the support of others.\" The nursing profession surely has problems. They must not be seen as a whole in themselves but in relation to the larger problems of society, problems that can be understood and resolved by \"cooperation, adjustment, of a meeting of minds, of reaching a common understanding and recognition of the prob lems of others . . .\" Since change and growth is based upon a sense of the need for development, and since change never moves at the same pace for every phase or for every organization, the nursing profession must learn \"to enlist the aid of other social forces in society forces that are more potent, that have more status than nursing to work with them toward the com mon over-all goal of better nursing care for the American public with concomitantly better condi tions for herself.\" The nurse must be more scientific in her approach to other professional groups for support; she must exercise less emotion, and must utilize public opinion more skillfully in behalf of an improvement in pro fessional status and economic stability. American Journal of Sociology. \"Manipulating Public Opinion: The Why and the How.\" Vol. XXXIII, No. 6, May 1928. pp. 958-971. An editorial abstract preceding this article by ELB outlines its main ideas as follows: \"Public opinion, narrowly defined, is the thought of a society at a given time toward a given object; broadly conceived, it is the power of the group to sway the larger public in its attitude. Public opinion can be manipulated, but in teaching the public how to ask for what it wants the manipulator is safeguarding the public against its own possible aggressiveness. The method of the experimental psychologist is not as effective in the study of public opinion in the broad sense as is that of introspective psychology. To create and to change public opinion it is necessary to understand human motives, to know what special interests are represented by a given population, and to realize the function and limitations of the physical organs of approach to the public, such as the radio,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"14 the platform, the movie, the letter, the newspaper, etc. If the general principles of swaying public opin ion are understood, a technique can be developed which, with the correct appraisal of the specific prob lem and the specific audience, can and has been used effectively in such widely different situations as changing the attitude of whites toward Negroes in America, changing the buying habits of American women from felt hats to velvet, silk, and straw hats, changing the impression which the American electorate has of its President, introducing new musical instruments, and a variety of others. Group adherence is essential in changing the attitudes of the public. Authoritative and influential groups may be come important channels of reaching the larger public. Ideas and situations must be made impres sive and dramatic in order to overcome the inertia of established traditions and prejudices.\" p. 958. American Mercury. \"Group Leaders of Democracy.'' Vol. XLIV, No. 176, Aug 1938, pp. 437, 444. Discussion of the importance of winning over the leaders who play an important part in determining the attitudes and actions of the masses in democracy, to the task of awakening in the people an under standing of the values of political and industrial democracy. After pointing out the threats to democracy from all over the world, and showing how American inter est in democracy has increased in the last ten years, ELB continues: \"How, then, can we attempt to preserve Democracy? How can we safeguard both our basic political and social system and the private enterprise tied up with it? We shall attempt to lay out the approach. ... In a Democracy, you must have the voluntary support of the people in order to succeed. . . . How can we develop and maintain among the people a true recognition of the values of Democracy, combined with a dynamic will to defend and preserve it? The people will be ready to value and defend Democracy, or any other sound ideas, if those whom they follow and look up to have first been brought to recognize its validity. ... If you can demonstrate to the men and women in the van guard of our society that your product or your idea is sound and serves the public interest, your battle is more than half won. There are two ways to gain public support. On the one hand, facts or ideas or a viewpoint can be presented to the masses directly, as is done daily on billboards, over the radio, through advertisements in the daily press, or even by means of sky writing. Another way is to take your message to the group leaders, win their support, and let them carry the message to the mass of the people to prepare them for the mass-appeal which may follow this group-leader acceptance. . . . The importance of group leaders as a channel for ideas in the Democracy has not been generally recognized. But group-pat terns do exist, and should be utilized for drawing society closer together for common ends. . . . Dem ocratic society is made up of an almost infinite number of interest groups, whose leaders command the respect of the group, whose opinions and actions carry weight and influence. . . . Men turn for guidance to the leaders of groups of which they are members. This sound principle of group leadership holds in advertising as it does in every other special- pleading activity. . . . The preservation of our political and industrial Democracy depends on our ability to awaken in our people an understanding of the values of political as well as industrial Democ racy. This task must be met by finding and winning over the leaders who play such an important part in determining the attitudes and actions of the masses in the Democracy.\" \"Preview of American Public Opinion.\" Vol. LVIII, No. 243, Mar 1944. pp. 340-345. Based on a nationwide survey conducted by ELB which attempted to \"estimate what American public opinion and American action will be in the next six months or so.\" The survey \"indicates clearly that we shall be in agreement as to what are the main issues facing the country, and almost unanimous in the determination to solve them along democratic lines.\" This survey is a departure in opinion polls in that it is a serious attempt to determine public opinion on the immediate future instead of tracing trends in mass opinion and mass preference by comparing existing popular attitudes with past attitudes. The survey was conducted keeping two points in mind: \"(1) What would be likely to emerge as the chief issues of popular interest in the near future, and (2) what would be the prevailing view and action on each of these subjects.\" Instead of addressing the attitudes of a cross section of the entire popula tion, this survey was directed at a cross section of group leaders. \"By ascertaining what those who mold public opinion believe now, we have a reliable pre view of what public opinion and action will be later.\" The poll reached the men and women who in turn contact millions of minds with direct or indirect influence daily. The survey disclosed five major issues prevalent in the public mind in the order of their importance: \"1. Winning the war; 2. The cost of living; 3. International cooperation; 4. Race relations; and 5. Labor relations.\" The people were also concerned with three other issues: \"1. The 1944 elections; 2. The trend of the Federal government; and 3. Demobilization.\" Through this survey it was determined what coming public opinion would be. \"A Mercury Survey of Opinion Leaders\" Vol. LX, No. 254, Feb 1945, pp. 198, 203. A survey by ELB of public opinion on major current issues and post-war problems. \"In a preview of American public opinion, published in the March 1944 American Mercury, I attempted by querying representative group leaders and opinion-molders throughout the country to evaluate the trends of"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"public opinion and action in the following six months; and to interpret and project them into the future. . . . The results of our survey proved to be remark ably accurate. Public opinion and events took place according to expectation. I have completed a new survey to try to forecast public opinion on major issues, arising out of present events and in some cases to forecast events themselves. This article give in broad outline the results of our latest survey. \"Here are the conclusions to be drawn from this study: The American people will join a postwar union of nations; with victory, America and her Allies will occupy a conquered Germany and Japan until they become economically sound and politically democratic; America believes it will not enter an other war until at least twenty- five years from now; Americans think that Presidential tenure should be limited by law; postwar taxes should be levied on all income groups, and distributed proportionately; wartime controls should be continued in the postwar period, primarily on necessary goods, through mini mum wage laws, and wage ceilings; reconversion should be handled by both government and private industry, and not by government alone. In the light of current political, economic, and social trends, the United States will move in the next ten years to wards a mixed economy, increasing cooperative in terest and control by both government and private industry. The people will demand a law requiring confirmation of treaties by a majority vote of both houses of Congress.

Editorial note: \"Edward L. Bernays, whose appraisal of the apparel industry's problems is presented here, has very aptly been termed one of the nation's lead ing publicists. He has acted as counsel on public re lations to many of the nation's outstanding industries and industrial organizations and has helped to shape policies which have brought them into the forefront of favorable public attention. His services have been retained not only by important groups in America and Europe, but also by our own government and other public bodies. Mr. Bernays' books on the sub ject of public relations, 'Crystallizing Public Opin ion' and 'Propaganda,' are textbooks in various uni versities and he is in demand by colleges and eco nomic organizations to discuss his profession, which he was instrumental in founding.\" In this article, ELB says that the development of the men's apparel business in America will depend upon an adherence to the principle that \"the public interest and the private interest must coincide.\" He adds: \"The more the public knows about its interest in the business, the better for the business. The rec ognition in action of this principle by all should be a dynamic factor in creating more good will and more profit.\" 15 Association News: \"Publicity in International Trade. How Public Opinion Was Influenced by the United States during the War.\" Published by the American Manufacturers Export Associa tion. Vol. 1, No. 24, Apr 1920. pp. 1-5. Editor's Note: \"Edward L. Bernays has a record of achievement in domestic and international publicity which makes his statements on this subject authori tative. As head of the Export Section of the Com mittee on Public Information, a department which he created and organized personally, he established wide contacts with foreign merchants and the for eign press in every important country in South America, Europe and the East. The methods which he discusses in this article are those which he applied with notable success during the war to selling po litical and commercial good-will for America through out the world. He has had uniquely varied experi ence in the field of publicity, his activities ranging from American advisor to foreign governments to special advisor in various capacities to departments of our own government.\" In this article, ELB describes the techniques he used as chief of the Export Section of the Committee on Public Information. These consisted of (1) organ izing the American exporters into \"such a medium of distribution for political information that no field of approach to the foreign markets and to foreign opinion was left untouched by the ideas we wished to sell them\"; (2) the use on all printed matter that left an American firm for a foreign country of some slogan illustrating America's purpose; (3) supplying travelling salesmen with photos and other material graphically illustrating America's advance develop ments; (4) commercial advertisements in foreign dailies containing educational matter as well; (5) the distribution with every bit of mail which left the United States for foreign countries of short fillers in a number of languages; these fillers explained Amer ica's purposes in entering the war, the ends it hoped to attain, the methods for attaining them: leading manufacturers and exporters enclosed this material in their foreign correspondence ; (6) cooperation with Film Division of the Committee in the preparation and distribution of motion pictures in allied and neutral countries; (7) insertion of editorial matter in catalogues; etc., etc. ELB points out that no part of this \"great experi ment\" of selling America to the world has survived. \"No effort is being made either by the government, by associations of manufacturers and exporters, or by individual business men to take advantage of a golden opportunity for obtaining a position of proud pre-eminence in almost every export market.\" ELB suggests \"the building up of a background of public interest in the particular venture here in the United States\"; the expansion of this campaign abroad \"by experts who are competent to see to it that it is properly prepared in the different languages and that it reaches the proper media of distribution abroad\" via foreign correspondents, news services, syndi cates, photo agencies and important foreign news papers."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16 Best Magazine Articles of the Year. \"Why We Behave Like Inhuman Beings.\" Selected by the Leading Editors of the Nation. 1949. pp. 70-73.

ELB says: \"The safeguarding of democracy in America today and for the future demands that there be in the Cabinet of the United States a Secretary of Public Relations whose duty it would be to serve the American people as a liaison officer between them and their government. The proposal is made to meet the need of the American people for some unbiased channel through which the President of the United States would learn of the changing wishes of the people, and of the actual effect of his government policies in the factories, mills, offices and homes of the land. In this way, there would be in the cabinet, serving the public interest, a responsible executive officer to interpret the people to the Administration, and the Administration to the great mass of the people.\" ELB emphasizes that the proposed Secretary of Public Relations would function solely with the executive branch of the government the Presi dent, Cabinet members, departments, and would in no way be connected with Congress or the judiciary. He would be neither a propagandist nor a censor; his function would be solely that of \"explanation and interpretation.\" He would direct the various public relations activities of the executive branch of the government and would \"examine all statements of policy before they were made public to guard against possible contradictions or inconsistencies.\" Current History and Forum.

Editorial note: \"Here is a clear and forceful plan of battle for all who desire to better their own com munities.\" In this article ELB tells how women, organized in groups, are using the new tool of propaganda to mold public opinion on questions of education, better gov ernment, and many industries. Showing how public opinion is crystallized into desired action, ELB says that women's clubs must be effectively organized, that they must have clear objectives, that they should consult experts in public opinion who will make opinion surveys for them, that the cooperation of national and local societies can and should be obtained. After the objective has been clearly de termined, the women's clubs must know, classify and analyze \"the public through whose cooperation the battle is to be won.\" The problem is \"to discover exactly what the dominant groups in the community feel towards the proposed change, and on what basis a realignment of these groups can be brought about in favor of the proposed measure. . . . Our next problem is to find a series of common denominators of interest between ourselves and these groups we are trying to align with us.\" Once the strategy of attack is decided upon and the basic motivations to be played upon are clear, the battle begins. Here action is guided by specific conditions; if the enemy is the local legislature, one method is required, if an official, another method. The leaders of the women's clubs rouse the community to action through mass media of communication the news-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"paper, the picture, the movies, etc. Events are or ganized to create news.

Publicists, economists, leaders in research, the heads of great educational institutions can and should be made human symbols to bring new faith and new strength to business and finance\"; (2) \"The second approach is one of public education. . . . Words expressing the entire function and nature of business and financial institutions must be re-defined and re- clarified so that every member of the public will have a clear idea of the value of the word symbols that go to make up business and finance. . . . Every medium that reaches the public must carry these ideas to the public. Such public education cannot be accused of self-interest, for the public interest and an intelligent knowledge and understanding of business and finance, and their place in our society, are one . . . \"; (3) \"The third approach to the problem is to re-establish business men and financiers in the public mind by the very activities in which they engage. This can be done by letting them, through their deeds, again assume the position in the community which they used to occupy. The busi nessman and the banker must again become the public-spirited citizen, symbol of pro bono publico\"; (4) \". . . financial institutions and business gen erally must offer a fair and honest service to the public.

To present this subject accurately, com pletely, and authoritatively, the Editors elicited the opinions of business leaders, attended conventions of industry and finance, sought out the best authori ties on the subject, published their findings and editorial opinions in a special public relations issue. For a feature article on this subject they requested America's leading expert on public relations, Mr. Edward L.

Readers will remember his handling of Light's Golden Jubi lee, in which Thomas A. Edison, Henry Ford and other leaders participated.

Apr 1930, pp. 4-6. ELB says: \"Since every corporation engaged in business must depend upon the public for its support and its success, it is important that every public contact be consistent with company policy and that company policy be based on sound understanding of the public.

Its techniques, intelligently handled, is ap plicable to every company which deals with and depends upon others for its corporate existence.\" ELB then reviews various factors which condi tion the behavior of the buying public and how public relations can influence that behavior. \"Let us inquire how a public relations policy is formulated and developed in the case of a railroad, for instance. What are the points of contact of a railroad with the public and how can they best be directed to produce the best result? What is the product a rail road sells and how can it be presented to the public so that the greatest receptivity will be produced for that product? What channels are available, in addition, to those normally used, such as advertising, to convey the railroad and what it stands for, to the public? . . . How can business hear what the public has to say? How can it modify its actions to conform to the public's desires? How can it speak to the public in a language the public understands and appreciates? The modern way is through the services of an expert in public opinion. . . .

The leaders in America's economic fields must recognize that the problem exists; 2. they must get together; 3. a pro gram of public education must be decided upon which should reach the public through every chan nel of communication and in terms of the public's interest and understanding.

In this article ELB discusses the opportunity of business executives to build a sound structure of public relations. Presenting briefly the steps to be followed in such a campaign, the article emphasizes the identification of the publics of a business and what they think. \"The first step of the business executive, in determining his relationship toward all these facets, is to study each public on which he impinges and find out what each group thinks of the attitudes and practices of his company. Next, he should study himself, his attitudes, his practices, his products and stack up his findings against the opinions of his various publics. He will then be able to isolate points of irritation and to develop further the existing areas of agreement. . . . When all points of dissatisfaction have been determined, the wise executive will then use all possible ingenuity to correct solutions that can be changed practicably. . . . Only after such changes are made is it possible to re-educate the public and create a new under standing of the goals and services of the company. . . . And indirectly, in many ways, the company can assume leadership in community or national affairs and dramatize its interest in the general public welfare.\" Foreign Service. \"Here's How to Speak Up for Democracy,\" Vol. 28, No. 4, Dec 1940, pp. 6-7, 46-48.

Here in America, freedom of opinion of propaganda exists. Un der authoritarian regimes this is not true. Here many points of view are freely expressed. In authori tarian countries there is only one point of view per mitted. And force and coercion implement this. Through the interplay, in a democracy, of discussion, argument, and persuasion, we are safeguarded. All groups and opinions thus have an opportunity to be heard.

The matter of organization,\" he continues, \"depends on two things: 1. Your own energy and effectiveness; 2. Your initial budget;\" and, finally, \"Events must be planned ... in such a way that they will accomplish two purposes: 1. They must symbolize the idea for which you stand; 2. They must be handled so dramatically that they will successfully compete for attention. . . . The success of a program depends on the effectiveness with which it is communicated, and more than this, on the logic with which the entire program has been thought out and developed. . .\" House Furnishing Review. \"How to Overcome Depression Fears,\" Jun 1947, pp. 2-4. ELB discusses the role of fear in inducing business fluctuations and presents a formula for preventing \"economic jitters\": \"Whatever our theory may be regarding business cycles and their cause, fear plays some part in them, for men and women who have fears are an integral part of them. . . . We are afraid today not only of a possible depression or recession. We are probably more afraid of the de pressing effects of fear itself . . . obviously fears of some groups are more powerful, influential, more explosive than fears of other groups. . . . We can eliminate many of the fear-makers from our social and economic system. We can do this, and we should, voluntarily, as businessmen. If we rely mainly on government to accomplish this freedom from fear, we may well lose much of our freedom. America wants both freedom and security. But we can achieve a bal ance between freedom and security if every group voluntarily approaches the task so as to forestall gov ernment control over both security and liberty.\" Household. \"Why We Behave Like Inhuman Be ings\" Feb 1949, pp. 7, 69-76. This article analyzes the 20th Century crisis in terms of human behavior and shows how the social sciences can help us overcome this crisis. The article con cludes: \"Thus science, with its modern equipment of experiment and method, is seeking to solve the problem of inhuman behavior through greater and greater knowledge of man and the world in which he lives. The key to our liberation from our jungle heritage of force and fraud lies in accelerated self- understanding. The truth shall indeed make us free when we learn with the same control we exercise over the physical nature, that it must now be the truth about ourselves.\" Independent. \"Putting Politics on the Market,\" Vol. 120, No. 4068, May 19, 1928, pp.47(M72."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"20 ELB urges politics to employ the public relations techniques of big business in order \"to do away with inefficiency in campaigning.\" After suggesting that politics has failed to keep up with business methods in mass distribution of ideas and products, ELB recommends a program for remedying this defect. \"Politicians who know po litical strategy and who can develop campaign issues, who can devise strong planks for platforms and en visage broad policies cannot be given the responsi bility of selling ideas to a public of more than 100,- 000,000. The politician understands the public. He knows what the public wants and what the public will accept. But the politician is not necessarily a general sales manager, a public relations counsel, or a man who knows how to secure a mass distribution of ideas. . . . The political campaign today is all side shows, all honors, all bombast, glitter, and speeches. . . . Big business is conducted on the principle that it must prepare its policies carefully and that, in selling an idea to the large buying public of America, it must proceed according to broad plans. The political strategist must do likewise. The entire campaign should be worked out according to broad basic plans. Platforms, planks, pledges, budgets, ac tivities, and personalities must be as carefully studied, apportioned, and used as they are when a business desires to get what it wants from the public. The first step in a political campaign is to determine on the objectives, and to express them exceedingly well in the current form that is, as a platform. . . . To aid in the preparation of the platform there should be made as scientifically as possible an analysis of the public, in order to determine just what the platform should contain. . . . The ex penses of a political campaign should be budgeted. . . . The first question which should be decided is the amount of money to be raised for the campaign. This decision can be reached by a careful analysis of campaign costs. . . . Then the second question of importance is the manner in which money should be raised. It is obvious that politics would gain much in prestige if the money-raising campaign were conducted candidly and publicly, just as the war campaign funds were raised. . . . The third step is to decide how the money is to be spent. This should be done according to the most careful and exact budgeting, wherein every step in the campaign is given its proportionate importance, and the funds allotted accordingly. ... In the same way the emotions by which the public is appealed to may be made part of the broad plan of the campaign. Unrelated emotions become maudlin and senti mental too easily, are often costly, and too often waste effort because the idea is not part of the con scious and coherent whole. . . . The emotional content must, first, coincide in every way with the broad basic plans of the campaign and all its minor details; second, it must be adapted to the many groups of the public at which it is to be aimed; and third, it must conform to the media of the distribu tion of ideas. . . . It is essential for the campaign manager to educate emotions in terms of groups. . . . The political campaign having denned its broad objects and its basic plans, having denned the group appeal which it must use and the groups which it must reach, must now define the various channels through which it can appeal to the public as a whole. . . . But whatever is done must be synchronized accurately with all other forms of appeal to the public. Many events can be planned, events which must dramatize the ideas for which the candidate or the party or the platform stands. Activities must be coordinated, the platform itself must be so pre sented that every plank of it may be as understanda ble, as graphic, as concise as the slogan of a soap manufacturer or a motor company. . . . When this is achieved it is possible that political supply and demand can be brought closer together. Scientific methods and sales charts will supercede the guesses and the betting that form so large a part of the campaigning today.\" . \"This Business of Propaganda.\" Vol. 121, No. 4083, Sept 1928, pp. 198-199. Editorial note: \"Propaganda is an ancient art, but it required the war to develop a new profession skilled in its uses. Governments, prominent persons, bank ing, industry have all called upon the public relations counsel to smooth out their contacts with the world. Somewhat recently the investigation of power pub licity has focused attention upon the legitimate use of propaganda. THE INDEPENDENT has invited Mr. Bernays, one of the most prominent public rela tions counsels and author of 'Crystallizing Public Opinion,' to explain in this article the rules of his profession and the limitations of propaganda.\" In the article, ELB says the ethics of a propagan dist or public relations counsel should be: (1) never to represent or plead in the court of public opinion a cause he believes is socially unsound; (2) never to take the cases of conflicting clients; (3) \"when he deals with any of the media of disseminating ideas to the public press, radio, lecture platform or motion pictures he will do so as the representative of his client, 'maintaining the same standards of truth with them as govern the morals and habits of the world he lives in.' The social value of the public relations counsel,\" ELB concludes, \"lies in the fact that he brings to the public facts and ideas of social value which would not so readily gain acceptance other wise. While he, of course, may represent men and individuals who have already gained great accept ance in the public mind, he may represent new ideas of value not yet accepted.\" Industrial and Labor Relations Review. \"An Educational Program for Unions,\" Vol. 1, No. 1. Oct 1947, pp. 103-109. ELB discusses industrial relations from the public relations standpoint. \"It appears to me that unions still have an important job of work to do; namely, to carry on an intensified factual educational cam paign, to instruct not only the general public and management, but their own union members as well, on the bedrock facts of the struggle for industrial democracy. . . . Organized labor can help educate"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"21 both management and workers to a realization of this obligation. Such education has one basic purpose: to create understanding, so that management and labor may work together effectively and prevent clashes. And this cooperation must come, for our system cannot stand continuous warfare.\" After examining the educational program of one progressive union, which consisted of: educating members to enter into the union's work; to strengthen democracy; and to sell itself to its own rank and file, ELB suggests addi tional programs: \"(1) Make the public understand the value to the country of sound unions and ma ture union leadership. (2) Make the employer un derstand the value of unions to him, and make him realize that he needs to apply the science of hu- manics, the study of human relations. (3) Make the worker understand our industrial system and his role in it. This type of education will lay the founda tions for a broader understanding of controversial economic issues, and build toward increased coopera tion between labor and other major sectors of our society.\" Infantry Journal. \"War against Words.\" Vol. XLVII, No. 5. Sept-Oct 1940, pp. 482^85. In discussing the importance of modern propaganda techniques in psychological warfare today, ELB says: \"The Army of the United States must make full use of this art and this science if it is to have the highest potential morale within its own forces, and the highest efficiency in attack and counter-attack on the enemy in the psychological warfare of today.\" After pointing up the increased role played by propaganda activities in the first World War and its even greater prospects for the second World War, ELB outlines a program for effective counter-propa ganda. \"The most effective method, of course, is to develop in one's own adherents an overwhelming will to victory, a belief in strength, a certainty of suc cess, a forceful morale. Morale is dependent on many factors. Counter-propaganda can meet the strategy of terror aimed to break it down by (1) Emphasis by reiteration of the weaknesses of the enemy, using facts, figures and dramatization of strong spots. (2) Deflation of the attack of words be fore it is launched by calling attention to it, exposing the method, and thus taking the wind out of its sails.\" . \"Morale: First Line of Defense.\" Vol. XLVIII, No. 5, May 1941. pp. 32-35, 69. Editorial note in \"Meet Our Authors\": \"Edward L. Bernays is the well-known public relations counsel. During the World War he served as a member of the staff of the United States Committee on Public Information the 'Creel Committee' and he was later also on duty in Paris at the Peace Confer ence. He wrote Crystallizing Public Opinion and Propaganda. This issue carries his second contribu tion to The Infantry Journal; the first, 'War Against Words,' appeared in the September-October, 1940 number.\" p. 69. Emphasizing that in modern warfare \"psychologi cal ramparts are as important as physical ramparts,\" ELB urges that \"our morale is our true first line of defense.\" While national unity and morale must come from all, \"it cannot be imposed from any cen tral authority or control.\" The Army can help build morale by 1 . exerting itself to make democracy work better by cherishing democratic standards both in its own inner workings and its relations with those not in the Army; to defend democracy, our Army must be a democratic army; 2. leaders of the Army can aid in making democracy work better by their public expression in favor of those causes that, make for a more closely knit democracy; Army leaders can strengthen America's psychological front by becom ing articulate, dynamic proponents of democracy, pp. 32-33. Commenting on the importance of the Army's newly established Public Relations Bureau and Mo rale Branch, ELB recommends the following. For the Bureau: 1. a broader survey than has yet been made of Army customs and practices; 2. a study of what the public expects of its democratic army; 3. a study to ascertain what words, pictures and ac tions, and what type of presentation will best con vey the facts about the Army to the public; 4. through the Bureau of Public Relations, Army lead ers should express themselves to a greater extent than at present upon matters affecting democracy; the educational system of the country can be urged to study and teach the varied fields of learning that enter into the new political and psychological war fare; 5. the Bureau should speak up for democracy within the Army itself; 6. it should avail itself more and more of the intellectual resources of the scientific and .trained personnel available in this country. For the Morale Branch: 1. the fullest use of spe cialized scientific personnel to serve on a Morale Commission that will advise the Army's public rela tions and morale agencies on policies and methods; 2. to harness civilian intellectual capacities to the problems the country and the Army face, both within the Army and in the relation of the Army to civilians; experts in the social sciences sociologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social psychologists, adult educators, experts in public relations and com munications are likewise willing to place them selves at the disposal of the government and should be called upon as freely, p. 34. Journalism Quarterly. \"The Press Must Act to Meet Postwar Responsibility,\" Vol. 21, No. 2. Jun 1944, pp. 122-129. Editorial note: \"Mr. Bernays, the well-known public relations counselor, here analyzes newspaper 'plat forms' and public acceptance of the press, and sug gests steps it must take to maintain its position in the world of tomorrow.\" ELB's analysis is based on the premise that \"communications today and in the postwar world constitute a problem of vital concern. The press, radio, motion pictures and magazines are our four greatest media of communication. They bear tre mendous social responsibility . . . which will de termine what the future shall be. ... The daily press has made enormous strides in the last few"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"22 years. . . . But the press . . . has failed to gain the broad public acceptance it should, either as a dis seminator of news or as an instrument of social leadership, the two functions of a free and inde pendent press in a democracy. There is danger to our democratic well-being in this condition, for unless the public regards the press as a free and independent medium and an instrument of leadership . . . there may be a tendency . . . toward restriction and control, despite the First Amendment.\" ELB says his conclusions are based upon \"a study of authoritative surveys . . . and from personal correspondence with publishers all over the nation. . . . One hundred sixty-nine publishers of American daily newspapers in 161 cities, in 43 states where 96 per cent of the dailies are located, cooperated. . . . The newspapers I studied were approximately nine per cent of the entire daily press of America ... a cross-section of the entire press.\" In the study, problems \"vitally affecting both the public and the press\" were involved: \"First, what are the public relations policies and practices that gov ern American daily newspapers today? Second, what are the attitudes of the American people toward the . . . press. . . ? Third, what are the issues and goals the American people are interested in now and for the post-war period? . . . We shall appraise newspapers and their platforms from two stand points,\" ELB also pointed out, \"first, as a profes sional service purveying news, an informant of public opinion, independent and free; second, as a social in strument of leadership expressing itself in interest in the local community in improvements, projects, cooperation; and in interest in the national govern ment in patriotism, in war and postwar interests.\" ELB concludes: \"If the newspaper effectively serves the public as a news disseminator and a social instrument, we do not need to be concerned about the newspaper as a successful private enterprise. . . . Newspapers may have much advertising and circulation brought about by many different causes today, but if they do not act on these basic consider ations they will not be able to maintain their position in our society.\" ELB gives \"recommendations for platforms of leadership character\" leading to the high point that the press \"must 'sell' to the public constantly that it is truthful and accurate. ... It must stress to the public in every way its inde pendence from domination by newspaper owners, politicians, capitalists, government or advertisers. . . . This can be done through what is known as the 'engineering of consent,' using public relations pro cedures . . . [covering] a knowledge of maladjust ments with the public, and their elimination; of ob jectives, themes, strategy, timing, planning, or ganization and the use of tactics, through every channel of approach. . .\" . \"Views on Postwar Responsibility of the American Press.\" Vol. 22, No. 3, Sept 1945, pp. 255-262. Editor's note: \"Mr. Bernays, the well-known public relations counselor, presents a representative collec tion of frank and enlightening comments on his article in the June 1944 Journalism Quarterly, which has provoked wide discussion.\" ELB says: \"In the June 1944 Journalism Quar terly was published my article entitled 'The Press Must Act to Meet Postwar Responsibility!' . . . The article dealt with stated policies of American newspapers and how they practice them; the atti tudes of the public toward the press; the issues that the public considers to be important; and recom mendations on public relations for the daily press. It pointed out that danger signals existed for the American press. From an interpretation of authorita tive surveys, it suggested that the press has failed to gain the broad public acceptance which its function in a democracy demands the function of a dissemi nator of accurate, complete and unbiased news and an instrument of social leadership. It concluded that, unless steps were taken to remedy this condition, not only does the press stand to suffer but the progress of the nation itself might be impeded. . . . The London's World's Press News, on September 7, 1944, devoted a page to it and commented: 'His analysis must give thinking leaders of the press . . . concern. His article deserves serious consideration.' ... In this country reprints of the article were sent for comment to a number of leading publishers and editors of daily newspapers and to educators, busi ness men and professional men. Some 500 responses were received from these key figures in American life. With one exception, the respondents supported the position taken in the article. The observations ranged from alarm at the existing problem to con fidence in a satisfactory solution.\" ELB then ab stracts some of the responses he received, concluding: \"Certainly, these responses indicate an awareness of the problem by leaders of newspapers and other sectors of our society. A recognition of the necessity for change is a healthy sign in a democracy.\" Labor and Nation. \"The Public Can Be Brought to Labor by Bringing Labor to the Public.\" Vol. I, No. 2, Oct 1945. pp. 33-47. ELB contributes to the magazine's symposium on \"Public Attitudes Toward Labor Unions: An Analysis of Popular Reactions toward Labor Unionism as Reflected in the Public Polls by Leading Public Re lations Experts and National Union Officials.\" Other contributors are Philip Murray, Walter P. Reuther, Elmo Roper, J.B.S. Hardman, Julius Hochman. ELB says: \"At the present time, the only data that is available relative to public attitudes on labor practices and labor leaders is that of the opinion polls. If I were asked to draw my conclusions from the opinion polls, certainly I would say that the public is sharply critical of labor union practices and of many labor leaders. That does not mean, how ever, that this conclusion is necessarily a correct one. For the polls, while they show that the general public is sharply critical, do not show the depth or the intensity of these critical opinions. . . . There are means of ascertaining the state of the public mind which may, from the broad standpoint, prove"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"23 the contrary of the polls. . . . We call our question technique the 'depth interview' method. . . . The method attempts to find the basic motivations that have prompted whatever the surface attitude may be, and to indicate the extent to which an indi vidual is tied to whatever opinion he may have and the reasons why. Such a method applied to ... labor union practices and labor leaders would, it seems to me, permit an individual to give a con sidered judgment . . .\" Public regulation of certain phases of union ac tivity, ELB continues, might allay certain anti- union sentiment for the time being but would not necessarily be a permanent cure. To make effective headway, cooperation between labor and the public must be treated from an integrated, unified approach to the problem. \"Such a unified approach might well be borrowed from what industries have done in meet ing comparable problems of public relationships. They have banded together for purposes of working out adjustments, . . . have modified their own attitudes and actions to conform to society's de mands and in turn, attempted to modify public attitudes and actions to bring about integration.\" . \"Labor Education as a Problem in Public Relations.\" Vol. II, No. 2, Mar-Apr 1947, pp. 19-21. ELB presents a program for acquainting the public with the aims, functions and operations of labor unions. The editorial note says: \"Edward L. Bernays is a nationally recognized public relations expert. The statement on these pages is taken from an ad dress by Mr. Bernays before a UAW-CIO Educa tional Conference held at Cleveland, Ohio, January 24-27, 1947.\" The statement is one of three presented in the \"How-to-Do-it Department\" of this issue, with the editor's comment: \"In response to frequent requests from union workers in the field, LABOR and NA TION will print under the above heading competent statements describing, in necessary and sufficient detail, the way 'things are being done' in various branches of union activity. . . . LABOR and NA TION invites the widest possible reporting on the 'know-how' of all that relates to union activity, in dustrial and public relations, political activity, edu cation, democracy.\" In his discussion ELB stresses four great needs in labor education as a public relations problem (1) for labor educational programs based on essen tials; he outlines immediate and long-range steps to take; (2) for specific kinds of information about unions to be supplied to the public with proper plan ning; (3) for employer-education programs; (4) for economics education of union members. He gives explicit guides as to the \"several broad lines of effort\" along which \"labor education needs to be directed\" first, in the education of members on union objectives; second, in strengthening democ racy; third [\"and this is not often announced but well understood\"] in \"selling\" the union to its own rank and file suggesting, also, \"three additional programs of education to make all segments of your public [general, employer and worker] understand what you want and why, and be more willing to accept your goals,\" with planning \"on a broad but detailed scale, over an extended period.\" He gives an extensive schedule to be used in planning \"to cover the following kinds of information about unions: 1. What is a union? How does it function? 2. What are the educational and welfare activities of unions? 3. What are the facts about collective bargaining? 4. What are the facts about labor disputes in general? 5. What do the words mean? [. . . to do this job . . . simply to apply the techniques . . . [of] mass education.]\" For educational directors \"of a great union\" he provides an 8-point educational program to \"help reach general union goals . . . aimed at the employer: 1. Educate your employer to the place of the union in our system, ... to study and use the knowledge of human relations that has been gathered by universities, labor unions, foundations. 2. Point out [the] many groups of progressive men and or ganizations . . . interested in studying and fur thering human relations . . . [which] deserve sup port from businessmen and labor unions . . . [such as] the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, the Society for the Advancement of Manage ment, the American Academy of Political and Social Science. ... 3. Persuade them to stimulate further research by industrial relations schools like those at Cornell, Princeton. 4. Encourage [them] to carry on technological research to improve working condi tions. 5. Help management to develop new ap proaches to the industrial relations problem . . . [for instance, stabilized employment . . .]. 6. Point up the importance of intelligent, honest, unbiased industrial relations personnel. 7. Urge management to encourage responsible leadership among the unions. 8. Urge them to support housing programs, civil liberties, sound international relations and other programs to strengthen democracy.\" Warning that \"efforts cannot succeed overnight,\" ELB stresses the point further that \"The educational process builds new points of view by planned con tinuous and repeated efforts. Different times, condi tions and methods yield different results.\" Indi cating finally the need, proved by \"reliable polls,\" for education of union members in economics, he says, \"Most of us know little about technical finance in business. This leaves the worker without the knowledge on which bargaining must be based. If he understands management's problems, he can deal with management on a realistic basis. . .\" Leader Magazine.

The dangerous fact is that the people of the two great democracies are today emphasising their dis agreements rather than their areas of agreement,\" ELB stresses the fact that \"we must look for a solu tion that is lasting, based on the understanding among both our peoples that we have a belief in a common past, a common present and a common fu ture that our goals are the same.\" He continues the three-page discussion and analysis under the sub-heads, \"Understanding Comes First,\" \"The Mistakes We Make,\" \"Public Policy and Public Relations,\" and \"A Joint Com mittee on Understanding.\" He proposes resolution of the problems he sees \"in terms of the enlightened self-interest of the two parties concerned ... on the level of real, long-term issues, not short-term irrita tions. . . . First, . . . that a joint solution be found, not merely of the dollar-pound question, but of the entire problem of Anglo-American cooperation [which must depend on an enlightened public opin ion, a public on both sides of the Atlantic which knows all the facts . . . and makes its decisions in the knowledge of these facts. ..].... From an economic standpoint, . . . Britain must, if it wants to export, lower its cost of production through in creased efficiency in production; second, it must re duce costs based on cartel and trade association price- fixing. . . .

I believe it is that at top-level policy-mak ing, the British Cabinet, there be present always an expert public relations man who can interpret to the . . . Cabinet the impact of policy before it is translated into action or law. A good statesman is not necessarily a good public relations man. Too many public relations officers in government are given the policy to disseminate after it has been de cided upon. . . . This is perhaps not the place to discuss personalities. But I would suggest emphat ically that [in regard to] the man who acts as Ambas sador of Great Britain to the United States . . . this is the time for forthright and frequent utterance by all Anglo-American spokesmen. The whole problem of British information to America should be treated from the standpoint of the engineering of consent of the American people to their common heritage, their common present, their common future. . . . Any activity carried out should be part of a broad integrated programme covering effective research, strategy, themes, organisation, planning, timing and tactics. Call this propaganda if you will, it is aimed at accomplishing the end we all want. . . . America must do her part, too, from an economic angle. She must lower tariffs if they keep out British goods that Britain produces better and cheaper. America must encourage rather than discourage British insurance companies . . . , should encourage the tourist traffic more than we do, . . . must realize that ship ping is a British forte . . . rather than subsidize our merchant marine to the extent we do. . . . The sug gestion has been made that as a first line of defence of democracy Britain and the United States form a Joint Committee on Furthering Common Under standing of joint problems confronting them. We have a joint military staff, discussing and preparing problems of defending democracy's physical bound aries. But we know that military preparations are useless unless they are backed by the people of the democracies. ... If we had both, through such a joint board, done what our military people are doing, built up our common goals on common understand ing, we would not now be in a position in which there is fear that we may be divided not only in two worlds, but in three.\" McCall's Magazine. ''The Two Lives of Women,\" Jun, Jul 1946. Editorial note calls ELB \"the foremost public relations counsel.\" The first of these two articles examines woman's ideal life as contrasted with her actual existence; the second provides a blueprint for action by women. The articles contain factual information, opinions obtained from 260 leading physicians, playwrights, educators, clergymen, social scientists, labor leaders, philosophers, historians, Congressmen, journalists, pediatricians, artists, poets, writers, movie produc ers, statesmen, columnists, lawyers, economists, businessmen, counsel, etc. In the first article, ELB describes his \"approach to the subject\": . . . \"We did not set up shop as experts on women ourselves. Instead, we sought out the experts and got their opinions and then . . . evaluated the mass of opinions . . . received. Our operating premise was that we must first know . . . the physical and psychological differences between men and women. Then we determine what thoughtful men and women consider the ideal relationship between the two sexes. . . . We must determine how far the actual falls short of that ideal in woman's role as sweetheart and wife and mother, her part in indus try and the professions, her legal and political stand ing in the society. Finally, we must produce, as the sifted and considered body of opinion from the ex perts who guided us, recommendations leading to ward a more satisfying and more rewarding place for women in American life. There was nothing in the technique we employed which we have not em ployed frequently in other fields of inquiry: 1. Au thoritative books were read and abstracted. 2. Con temporary magazines and newspapers were studied. 3. The attitudes of women in recent public opinion polls were compared with the attitudes of men. 4.

What will you do?\" As a part of \"these expert instructions prepared ... at McCall's request, by America's foremost public relations counselor,\" the magazine also presents \"a case history (illustrated) of women in action . . . hypothetical only as to names and dates.

Editor's note: \"Mr. Bernays' advice to young women on careers in public relations is backed by twenty-five years' experience as counsel for corpora tions and philanthropies, radio chains and univer sities, factories and art galleries. In fact, he has been called America's No. 1 Publicist.\" Discussing careers for young women in public rela tions, ELB divides the field into non-profit groups public service, government, education, foundations, social service organizations, political parties, religion, recreation and profit groups where public rela tions counsel handle \"everything from trade associa tions and insurance companies to the motion picture industry.\" In public relations \"the quality of your brains is more important than your profile.\" Among qualities desirable in public relations, ELB says, are the ability to induce other people to do what you want them to; travel on your own steam; be alert, tactful; have an analytical mind, a flair for research, a talent for writing, be articulate and above all accurate; be a good mixer; remember names and faces; be persuasive; be able to stand a fast pace; have good judgment, objectivity, discre tion, honesty, sincerity, vision, imagination and \"good old common horse sense.\" For success in the field, you have to know the strategy and techniques of public relations; you also have to know the cause you would espouse fashion, food, finance, etc. \"The social sciences make good basic equipment for all aspirants. . . . Many universities throughout the country offer courses. ... A college education is not a prerequisite but it helps. You can get ahead by starting at the bottom . . . and learning while you work as a stenographer. ... A seasoned PR woman knows how to do research, conduct surveys, write articles, news releases, speeches, pamphlets, annual reports, . . . conduct a house organ, direct a mailing campaign, stage exhibits and shows, ar range press conferences and speak in public.\" Defining the field, ELB says: \"In its correct sense, public relations is advising on policy-making matters. Publicity is not. It is one of the most important tools of public relations, but it is not public relations. . . . The general determines the strategy, the colonel carries out the strategy planned by the general. Public relations is usually associated with consultant, insti tutional, and big business functions. Publicity con cerns itself with newsmaking and the psychology of selling products and ideas.\" Musical America. \"Letter to the Editor,\" Jun 12, 1916. Letter to the Editor of Musical America written for the Music League of America in protest against the article, \"When New York Sits in Judgement\" by P. J. Grant, which appeared in the magazine on June 10, 1916. ELB says: \"It (the Music League of America) is called to task for having such men and women as Pasquale Amato, Giovanni Martinelli, Mme. Kurt and Johannes Sembach, 'foreigners', on its Park Music Committee. ... As regards the make-up of the committee, we feel that this is as it should be. It is thoroughly cosmopolitan in make-up; a representative committee that can well choose music for New York's conglomerate population. . . . As to the public press allowing its formation without even a protest, that, to our minds, shows that the public press here is not as narrow as it might be in Paris or Berlin, the cities to which your writer refers. The lack of this narrowness is shown, too, by the membership of the committee and by the artists who have offered their services.\""},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"26 The New Leader. \"Is Broadway Disappearing?\" Vol. XXXIII, No. 20. May 20, 1950. 32pp. Editorial Note: \"Edward L. Bernays is one of Amer ica's leading public relations counsels.\" This article is based on the theatre survey made by ELB for The League of New York Theatres in 1949, and cov ers more or less the same ground as the article on the same subject in Theatre Arts Magazine. See below. . \"Hawaii the Almost Perfect State?\" Vol. XXXIII, No. 46, Nov 20, 1950. 32 pp. Editorial note: \"Edward L. Bernays, U. S. Publicist Number 1, studied island conditions first-hand as visiting professor in Public Relations at the Uni versity of Hawaii last summer.\" At this time, says ELB, when the United States is so deeply concerned with problems in the Far East, Hawaii has a fourfold significance for us: 1. she is our island bastion in the Pacific; 2. she disproves Soviet accusations that imperialism and racism are our na tional policy; 3. she dramatizes to the Mainland that Americans of most diverse backgrounds can live to gether in harmony; 4. she demonstrates that 500,000 Americans, 2,500 miles distant in the Pacific, can successfully work out their destiny democratically. Hawaii has reached many of her goals political self-sufficiency, high standards of democratic living, economic self-containment; she clearly deserves statehood. But some gaps still need to be bridged. Outlining Hawaii's history in economic and ethnic terms, ELB says: \"Such disharmony as exists can be blamed for the most part on the little group of myopic men who constitute an expanded Big Five, who are outmoded and outdated in their attitudes and policies, and who are still trying to run the Islands.\" He then lists two types of rumors in Hawaii which express aggression: 1. ethnic rumors that deal with relationships between Caucasian and other ethnic groups, and 2. economic rumors that play up the middleman, and the man in the street, as victims of the Interests, the Big Five, Big Business. He also lists fourteen sources of friction pointed out by Hawaiians of Oriental background. \"Improvement in intergroup relations is all the more important,\" says ELB, \"because today the situation is so excel lent on the whole. Nothing I have said here is in tended to give the impression that cataclysmic re form is needed in the Islands. On the contrary, Hawaii is possibly as nearly democratic as any community in the world. Hawaii comes close to meeting the four goals projected above. For Hawaii to meet these goals fully, it would need only a very slight change of attitude on the part of a very small number of people toward the residual problems dis cussed here.\" pp. 10-13. New York State Pharmacist, See Addenda, Item 15. Occupations. \"Public Relations as a Career,\" Vol. XVI, No. 2, Nov 1937, pp. 131-133. This article by ELB and Doris E. Fleischman analyzes the continued substantial growth of public relations activities in recent years and outlines the occupational opportunities existing in their field. The function of the public relations counsel, this article says, is to appraise and deal with the group, and individual mind and action. The public relations counsel approaches a particular problem as follows: 1. He analyzes the relationship of the public to his client. 2. He analyzes his client and his client's objectives. 3. He formulates policies to govern his client's practices toward the public. 4. He interprets the client, his product or his services to the public. The young man or woman entering this profession has before him possibilities for influence that are limited only by his own ability. The ideal of the profession is a pragmatic one. It is to make the producer understand what the public wants, and to make the public understand the objectives of the producer; it is to make the producer, in the widest sense of the term, and the consumer meet on the highest possible point between them for the greatest good. Discussing the ethics of the profession, ELB and DEF say that the public relations counsel maintains faith with his public, his client and his media of dis tribution to the public. He cannot accept clients whose cases are mutually antagonistic or a case which is anti-social. The most effective way to start in this profession is to join someone practicing it. This covers a wide range, from banks to farm bureau federations. Salary of beginner varies with demand for his services, his ability, his power to sell himself, the budget of the group or individual for whom he works. Women have achieved comparable standing with men in this field. Printers' Ink. \"The Press Agent Has His Day.\" Feb 26, 1920, pp. 107-108. In this article, ELB replies to an editorial in Printers' Ink of Feb 19, 1920 which implied that \"all free publicity is necessarily surreptitious and that it can function only through back alley approaches to the editors of second-rate publications.\" He calls atten tion to two facts of outstanding importance. \"Lead ing papers throughout the country, including the best New York publications, depend to a consider able extent upon publicity organizations for news which would not otherwise come to their attention, and are keenly appreciative of the assistance which the publicity man gives them, either in the contribu tion of immediate news or in the providing of leads, the investigation of which results in news and feature material. . . . The most successful American cor porations and individuals have for a long time been employing publicity experts to present their point of view to the public, and are now represented either by a personal publicity man on the staff or by a publicity organization.\" ELB attributed both these facts to \"the highly technical and specialized character of American journalism.\" He also points out that \"an efficient publicity man must believe firmly in the value of advertising,\" and that \"no honest publicity man undertakes under any circumstances to promise the printing or appearance of his material.\""},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"27 ELB concludes: \"What the lawyer does for his client in the court of law, we do for our clients in the court of public opinion through the daily and periodi cal press. There are shady practitioners among us for whom we unfortunately have no machinery for dis barment such as advertising men and lawyers pos sess. Nevertheless, it is distinctly a pity for large industrial interests to refrain from accomplishing many useful purposes which a publicity organization fulfills because they are misinformed as to the general reliability and utility of publicity services.\" Public Opinion Quarterly. \"Recent Trends in Public Relations Activities,\" Vol. I, No. 1, Jan 1937, pp. 147-151. ELB says: \"The public relations profession enlarged its activities throughout the depression, because business realized that in addition to selling its products under unfavorable conditions it needed also to sell itself to the public, to explain its contribution to the entire economic system.\" In this article, ELB outlines the development of public relations from pre-Depression days to the Depression era. Prior to the Depression, he says, the public relations activities of industry were, to a large extent, confined to trade associations and the larger corporations. Trade associations which had specific problems of public relations competition, taxes, sales difficulties called in the expert on public opinion. When the depression and deflation first came, there was little change, little attempt to grapple with the new conditions. But a change did come when corporations and leaders lost prestige simultaneously. The public was now keenly sensitive, because of its feeling of insecurity, to everything about a corporation that it did not understand. Companies were exposed to attacks on all sides from unexpected quarters. False rumors hurt business. Then \"the public relations counsel was called in at all hours of the day or night to rush to the fire and put out what might well have spread into a disastrous conflagration.\" Advising and aiding in the rebuilding of established reputations which had been blasted, and attempting to build new reputations, were prime public rela tions tasks of the Depression period. The day of the straw man and the stuffed shirt were over. America no longer wanted clay idols. It wanted real heroes, who kept pace with the changed times and antici pated changed conditions by changing policies and actions in advance of public pressure and law men who recognized that private business is a public trust. Companies began to realize they had neglected the following important phases of their own existence: 1. The importance of always adhering to the princi ple that, to survive, private business must always be in the public interest. 2. That the public interest is a changing concept and business must change with it. 3. That the place of business in the American system must be sold to the public. 4. That public relations techniques can help to do this. Once this was recognized, trade associations and corporations developed new campaigns to rationalize and in tegrate business into the thinking of the American people. . \"Attitude Polls Servants or Masters?\" Vol. 9, No. 3, Fall, 1945, pp. 264-268. Editorial note: \" 'We are no longer led by men. We are led by the polls,' says this vigorous criticism of opinion polls by a man whose career has been spec tacular with success in studying and making public opinion. Edward L. Bernays goes on to recommend two steps to check what he considers a possible menace to the democratic process. Of course, some of the POQ editors dissent with equal vigor, and the next issue of the Quarterly will discuss the question further.\" In this article, ELB says: \"Polls are an enormously useful implement when honestly, efficiently and in telligently gathered and understood. On the other hand, they are potentially dangerous weapons in the hands of the unwise, the inept, the dishonest or the anti-social. . . . Inaccurate polls and interpreta tions are a danger to society: (1) Because inac curate polls have as strong an influence on the public as true polls; (2) Because misuse of polls for biased or venal purposes by pollsters or by those who hire pollsters, can be extremely harmful; (3) Because leaders who misinterpret and distort polls in dealing with the public are a menace to society. . . . There is too literal an acceptance of the validity of atti tude polls. . . . Attitude polls often lull legislators and business men into the belief that they are safe from public disapproval when quantitative per centage corroborates their own point of view. . . . There is, too, the danger in the new kind of leader ship which polls have produced in the United States leadership of obedience to polls. Correct polls must be carefully used: (1) Because attitude polls exercise so strong an influence upon the public as often to discourage use of sound democratic meth ods of reaching important decisions; (2) Because society suffers when polls inhibit leaders from inde pendent thinking, from anticipating change or from preparing the public for change; (3) Because polls exert pressure that may place society under what Jefferson called the tyranny of the majority and throttle progressive minority ideas. . . . But while the attitude polls carry these dangers with them, scientifically planned polls, carried out within the limits of present-day knowledge, may be accurate as to future actions. . .\" To prevent some of the misuse and misinterpreta tions of polls, ELB recommends: 1. pollsters should be licensed, just as doctors, lawyers, accountants and architects are licensed ; the people, as represented by their state or national government, should set up \"standards of character and educational qualifica tions before an individual is permitted to practice\"; 2. the public and its leaders should be educated in the \"significance of polls in our society.\" They should be given \"facts and points of view about polls, so that they can appraise polls correctly and in that way prevent dangers to society.\" ELB concludes: \"Polls then will fill a sound democratic purpose of helping"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"28 make decisions represent the accommodation of many viewpoints, rather than a majority opinion overwhelming all other points of view.\" Public Utilities Fortnightly. \"The Public Utility That Is ' Misunderstood',\" Vol. VI, No. 11, Nov 27, 1930, pp. 664-666. Analyzes the role of the public relations counsel in guiding corporations' policies for the attainment of its objectives. ELB says: \"Public relations is not a mystery. It embraces every contact a utility (or any other or ganization or individual for that matter) has with the public or any part of it. ... Since a utility is concerned with the public's attitude, it needs to know and act on important principles: 1. There are psychological principles behind all behavior. He who would influence or attempt to control behavior needs to understand these principles. 2. Behavior is re ciprocal. The public attitude towards an organiza tion reflects the organization's attitude toward it, and that attitude must be expressed in acts, riot merely words. The public must be definitely guided and influenced toward the desired actions. 3. The public is not a mass; it is a series of interlocking groups with varying motivations of moulding dif ferent groups toward an end. . . . The need for skilled shaping of such a policy, and the necessity for guidance of specific actions to make the policy effective, have created the profession of public rela tions counsel. \"The public relations counsel must know the groups of which the public is composed. ... If the public utility has been misunderstood in whole or in part by its public or parts of it, he starts the work of education or re-education. If the client has been at fault in old avoidable practices he points the way first, to modification, and second, to reflection of that modification to the public. Again, if the client wishes to embark on new practices, he sets about gaining awareness of and acceptance for these.\" . \" What Can Utilities Do about Public Re lations Today?\" See Addenda, Item 16. Publicity Director. \"Propaganda: A Vital Social Force,\" May 1933, pp. 6-8.

Reporter of Direct Mail Advertising. \"Direct Mail A Challenge to Research in Humanics,\" Vol. 10, No. 2, May 1947, pp. 6-8. ELB urges a more fundamental approach to the problems of direct mail advertising. \"The science and art of communication as a whole is one of the major problems facing the world. The most recent number of the Annals of The Academy of Political and Social Science is devoted to the subject 'Com munication and Social Action.\" It warns in the fore word that our civilization is in a race between com munication and that includes Direct Mail and chaos. We know that what we call society is only a network of partial understanding held together by communication, in which the mails play an impor tant part. Every act of a buyer involves some form of communication from buyer to seller and seller to buyer.\" Rotarian Magazine. \"License the Poll Takers?\" Oct 1946. In this debate with Claude Robinson, ELB uphold ing the affirmative, says: \"Attitude polls, scientif ically taken and intelligently interpreted, serve a useful purpose as tools for leadership in a democracy, but they are misused today by some of the pollsters who make them, and misinterpreted by the public and leaders of the public who are influenced by them. Pollsters should be licensed by the Government just as are doctors and lawyers.\" His premise is that licensing would \"safeguard the public,\" in opposition to the negative position, \"It would end freedom of press,\" taken by Claude Robinson, president, Opinion Research Corporation, Princeton, N. J. Saturday Review of Literature. \"The Revolution in Publicity,\" Vol. XXIV, No. 28, Nov 1, 1941, pp. 3, 4, 18. In this short history of public relations, ELB says: \"Invention, transportation, fashion, diet, diplomacy, even public relations all have been rocked by revolution. Since 1900 there have been four revolu tions in the field of publicity. The first, 1900-1914, was the period of muck-raking versus whitewashing publicity; the second was marked by the mass scale effort to sell war aims and ideals, 1914-1918; the third, 1919-1920 saw large-scale industrial publicity; and, since 1929, publicity in the fields linking private interest and public responsibility has been in the forefront. After describing these revolutions, the article con tinues: \"Public relations is no longer a white-wash ing; it no longer pulls the wool over anybody's eyes. Studies of public attitudes indicate public demand. Psychological motives, psychoanalytical techniques, psychology, ethnology, statistics, serve as a new foundation for the activity. Added methods, tools all these have helped to integrate the work of the public relations counsel, and have aided in solving his problems, which, to say the least, had been heightened by world chaos and tragedy. . . . With this background, the responsible counsel on public relations goes about his work as does the indus trialist. Whether industry can move fast enough to keep pace with the new demands made upon it by a world torn with economic and psychological in security is a question. Certainly the realities of the situation indicate that there is an awakening which if encouraged will keep for us the democratic pat tern, enterprise, civil liberties, the 'four freedoms,'"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"29 safe from the rigidity of state capitalism of the left or the right.\" \" Needed: A Grand Strategy,\" Vol. XXV, No. 10, Mar 7, 1942, p. 10. In this guest editorial, ELB discusses the relation ship of censorship and propaganda to the war effort. \"Total warfare has three fronts: military, economic and psychological. In order to achieve total warfare they must be integrated. It is my thesis that the psychological front with which censorship and propaganda are so directly concerned is an agent of integration, which will strengthen the other two fronts and weld all three into the necessary, effective whole.\" ELB suggests that \"censorship should be a function of the broad psychological front con cerned with public morale in the widest sense. Today it is only military and leaves the public in the middle.\" As to propaganda, \"a variety of propaganda agencies are at work, only loosely tied together, each calling vague signals to the other when there should be grand strategy and the grand approach. . . . The use of ideas as weapons must go hand in hand with our military planning and economic strategy.\" See Addenda, Item 18. \"Our Own Worst Enemy,\" Vol. XXXI, No. 22, May 29, 1948, p. 13. A review by ELB of \"The Man in the Street,\" by Thomas A. Bailey. N. Y: The Macmillan Co., 1948. ELB is described in the editorial note as \"author of 'Crystallized Public Opinion' (sic), 'Speak Up for Democracy,' and other books on similar subjects,\" This is a review of \"The Man in the Street\" by Thomas A. Bailey. ELB's full-page discussion analyzes the book's positive and negative points, including: \"A work such as Bailey's is long overdue . . . [for] little investigation has been made of the impact of public opinion on history. Mr. Bailey care fully examines indices of public opinion available to him . . . presents his facts and interpretations in 318 pages, most of them interesting, well-docu mented, and studded with a wealth of quotations. . . . To support his theory that public opinion en dangers national security, Mr. Bailey selects opinion and fact . . . proposes an antidote . . . makes every effort to maintain objective aloofness, and generally succeeds. . . . He [also] builds an ad mirable platform of pleasant fantasies, which and we admit deep disappointment in the lack of constructive imagination of this excellent historian it is apparent are not likely to be substantiated in the perceptible future. . . . Occasionally, . . . [moreover] his interpretations betray a chauvinism that is surprising ... [as in] his discussion of the hyphenated Americans who took so large a part in this country's history . . . [and] we regret that more space was not devoted to his discussions of propaganda and pressure groups, and the printing press and airways.\" ELB also strongly advises that \"the chapter on polls should be read carefully by all who help direct public affairs\" commenting, \"Our own studies verify the instability of individual opinions on such matters as foreign affairs and inter national relations. Polls are reliable only as a current index. . .\" School and Society, \"Looking toward Reforms in the New York City School System: Shorter Pa pers,\" Vol.63, No. 1627, Mar 2, 1946, pp. 154-155. This article deals with the resignation of twenty men and women from the Advisory Committee on Hu man Relations of the Board of Education as a direct means of expressing protest against New York City's public schools. Through the recognition -of the strength of public opinion these protesters were able to institute encouraging changes in public-school education. An Emergency Committee for Better Schools for New York's Children was established \"as moral support in the fight to arouse the broadest public opinion\" and a real attempt was made to stimulate the interest and aid of parents and educa tors. The purpose of this organization was to stimu late public opinion; once the public was roused, defi nite action could be expected. Through investiga tion comes change; through change orientation and a more effective, working school administration. Singing. \"Can Publicity 'Make' a Musical Career?\" Apr 1926, pp. 16, 40.

To broaden and strengthen the role of the theatre in the social and cultural life of America so that the theatre may enjoy the high status in the public mind to which it is entitled ; to improve rela tions between the public and the legitimate theatre; and to increase theatre attendance by intensifying favorable attitudes of regular and occasional theatre goers, and by recruiting new theatre-goers.\" Declar ing at the outset that \"It is no news to anybody that"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"30 the theatre is passing through a crisis which did not begin today, yesterday, or even last year. . . .

What would cure the theatre at its foundation would be a theatre movement deeply rooted in the modern world and capable of creating the new theatre forms it requires.\" ELB discusses his application of \"the techniques of the social sciences ... to do for . . . most of New York's theatre producers and owners what we have done in the past quarter of a century for corporations, trade unions, governments, educa tional institutions, scientific groups and individual theatres.\" He described five studies undertaken \"to give the League the kind of [comprehensive] survey it required\" by attempting \"to discover the social dynamics of the theatre situation\": [1] \"We collated and analyzed existing literature about the American theatre, including the books on the theatre and innumerable magazine articles. [2] We conducted personal interviews with thirty selected theatrical leaders, including producers, critics, editors, box office treasurers, brokers, theatre owners, actors, actresses, officers of theatrical un ions, and playwrights. [3] We had depth interviews with 400 men and women in middle and upper in come groups, representative of the theatregoing public in nine cities throughout the United States. [4] By mail questionnaires we obtained opinions from 2,500 leaders in various professions and occupations, selected from Who's Who; and 2,500 people in middle and upper income groups in twenty-seven cities. These people were asked thirty-five questions about their likes and dislikes in the theatre, and their ad justments and maladjustments with it. [5] In addi tion, while I was in London this summer studying the British Government's public relations policies and techniques, I directed a survey of West End methods of ticket sale and distribution in order to see if there was anything for Broadway to learn.\" Adding that \"the data gathered in these studies fill four volumes totaling 850 pages. We analyzed and interpreted this material and, on this basis, outlined recommendations for an action-program designed to achieve the League's three goals.\" ELB gives a point-by-point summary of the major findings and recommendations, before concluding: \"No one in his right mind would think of these re commendations as a cure-all for the theatre crisis, or imagine that anyone would propose them as a cure- all. But it is an action-program by which members of the League of New York Theatres can effectively change their attitudes and action, while educating the public and enlisting its support for the theatre. By presenting the public with the facts, by explaining the reasons for every situation, by reviving the great tradition of the theatre and by meeting the public's needs, the theatre can, I think, take a long step for ward toward becoming the great creative force in American life which it can and ought to be.\" This Week Magazine. \"Do People Like You?\" Apr 8, 1950. 24 pp. In the department \"Everybody's Etiquette,\" ELB answers the question: \"As a public relations expert, what is your advice on how to get along with peo ple?\" Individuals, he says, should study the methods business is now using to woo the public. If they ap plied them so their own relationships with others, they would be agreeably surprised. Some pointers: 1. be open-minded, sympathetic to the viewpoint of other fellow; 2. don't sound off with your own views or announce that you won't listen to any argument or show impatience with views of others; 3. be tact ful, objective; 4. do not let a cold, a late party the night before or any other personal matter affect your attitudes; 5. be diplomatic; if you disagree with someone let him know you respect his intelligence and intentions. ELB lists several ways of making a point without being disagreeable or injuring the other person's ego; you can: 1. build him up while you talk; 2. appeal to his sense of fair play; 3. quote authority for what you say; 4. present factual evi dence; 5. show your reasoning; 6. appeal to his emo tions or his acceptance of tradition. These methods, ELB says, widen areas of agreement, narrow areas of disagreement, make it possible to turn a heated ar gument into a quiet discussion, build your own repu tation as a person who gets along with others, p. 20. Today. \"Presenting American Business.\" Mar 28, 1936, pp. 10-11. This article by ELB traces the development of American business in a \"world changed with the great war,\" in a rapidly growing economy and its many problems. He defends it against the critics who condemn it for its \"inability ... to deal with poli tics as politicians do, for its diffidence in assuming public leadership, for its failure to treat with the public on its own subject.\" He asserts: \"Critics and commentators on American business condemn busi ness for its poor sense of public relations as if a sense of public relations were an instinct. A sense of public relations is not an instinct. It is not a taste nor an intuitive understanding. A sense of public relations is the product of strenuous and thorough going training in theory and practice.

The antiquated idea that the library is nothing more than a repository of books must take its place with the antiquated notion that medicine is only for curing disease rather than preventing it. . .\" ELB suggests three ways by which \"the library can take this leadership\" by (a) exercising \"edi torial judgment in selecting its books,\" taking \"into consideration not only the past but the living issues of the present\"; by (b) \"issuing lists of books [which are] creative and critical guides in the major fields of modern thought\"; and by (c) librarians' \"study [of] the available manuals on the many dif ferent kinds of adult education in America, and [application] ... to the library as a social force . . . [which can become] a dynamic activator for maintaining and developing democracy in the United States . . . since librarians are in a strategic position to develop effective forms of preventive and creative education. . .\" . \"The Library Inquiry Is Not Over.\" Vol. 25, No. 3, Nov 1950. Editor's Note says: \"At the A.L.A. Regional Confer ence in Atlantic City in October 1949, Edward L. Bernays made some suggestions on 'How to Make the Library a Dynamic Force for Social Action,' which later appeared in the March 1950 Wilson Library Bulletin. So we asked Mr. Bernays, whom Time has called 'U. S. Publicist Number One,' to be more specific. 'Now that we have the findings of the Public Library Inquiry,\" we asked him, 'what is to be done next?' Here is recipe for a blueprint of ac tion.\" A footnote describes ELB as \"Counsel on Public Relations; Adjunct Professor of Public Re lations, New York University; Author, Crystallizing Public Opinion.\" ELB's article analyzes the $200,000 seven-volume survey of the library field the Public Library In quiry made with funds granted by the Carnegie Corporation of New York to the Social Science Re search Council. This library inquiry, ELB says, \"has created awareness both among librarians and laymen that the library occupies an extremely im portant place in the American pattern; and that its future is fraught with the uncertainties which most institutions in American life face today unless some body does something about them.\" The survey also makes us realize \"that the library is in a position where its future is dependent upon public trends, attitudes and actions.\" ELB urges that more needs to be done about this survey. He suggests a four-point program of action to be carried out under the leadership of the Ameri can Library Association: 1. a clearcut outline of the objectives to be accomplished; 2. the strategy where by they would be accomplished; 3. themes to be used with the various publics to accomplish the objec tives; 4. the organizations necessary to accomplish them, whether it be a subdivision of the A.L.A. or an outside group. \"Only a broad planned social engineer ing approach to the problem will safeguard and develop libraries for America.\" Woman's Press. \"A Publicist Says the Y Is Needed More than Ever.\" Nov 1946.

His son John D., Jr., who had broad ideas and understanding of what public re sponsibility meant, brought a new influence into the corporation. It was through his influence, according to Mr. Nevins, that many of the old practices were changed and that publicity and public relations men were effectively employed.

An editorial footnote says this talk \"expresses Mr. Bernays' belief that industrial relations would profit"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"32 if labor unions carried out effective public relations policies and practices.\" ELB says: \"Management, workers and the general public must understand the workings of our economic system. They must apply the new science of hu- manics. This science attempts to learn the cause of industrial conflict and to discover ways to cure the disease. Labor should assume part of this educa tional responsibility.\" ELB suggests that the UAW follow three additional programs with this in view. \"(1) Make the public understand the value to the country of sound unions and mature union leader ship. (2) Make the employer understand the value of unions to him, and make him realize that he needs to apply the science of humanics. This will benefit employer, public and worker alike. (3) Make the worker understand our industrial system and his relationship to it.\" The American public, according to ELB, ought to have a great deal more factual information on union activity than it now has. He suggests that the UAW can plan the following five-point program to inform the public about unions: \"(1) What is a union? How does it function? This should give the basic story of union organization, its history and development, structure and internal government of unions, etc.; (2) the educational and welfare activities of unions, including the labor press, union educational activities, vocational training, labor banking and insurance, etc.; (3) the facts about collective bargaining; (4) the facts about labor dis putes, how they arise and what are the mechanisms by which disputes are adjusted under union-employer agreements; (5) a campaign to define terms com monly used in labor-management discussions, such as wage awards, work load, work sharing, etc.\" ELB also suggests an eight-point program for educating employers: \"(1) to the place of the union in our system; (2) to the existence of groups like the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, the Society for the Advancement of Management and the American Academy of Political and Social Science which are interested in studying and further ing human relations; (3) to stimulate further research by industrial relations schools like those at Cornell, Princeton and Harvard; (4) to carry on technological research to improve working conditions; (5) to de velop new approaches to the industrial relations problem; (6) to the importance of intelligent, honest, unbiased industrial relations personnel; (7) to en courage responsible leadership among the unions; (8) to support housing programs, civil liberties, sound international relations and other programs to strengthen democracy.\" American College Public Relations Association, \"Public Relations for Higher Education: A Chal lenge to Our Colleges and Universities.\" A talk before the District II Winter Conference, Hotel Biltmore, N. Y.: Jan 9, 1948. Published by American College Public Relations Association. 10pp. Analysis of public relations for colleges and universi ties with recommendations: \"Once institutions of higher learning have, as a group and as individual units, determined their goals it seems to me that every other action involving public relationships will flow naturally and logically therefrom. The public relations strategy of higher education, its themes, its organization, its planning, timing and tactics will be more realistic, and it will be able to achieve those goals much more effectively.\" To determine goals, college presidents were ques tioned and their answers analyzed. After analyzing their replies, ELB recommended a program of action. First, \"Administrators of colleges and uni versities should gather together in a conference to agree on a definition of public relations in its broad est terms.\" Second, \"Individual universities should define clear-cut goals for themselves and put them in writing.\" Third, \"University associations and the individual institution should undertake research to appraise public understanding of their goals. Further than this, universities and colleges may have to revise some of their attitudes and actions so as to reach the goals of higher education. . . . An approach of this kind to the problem of inte grating the university's relations with its various publics considers both the general and the specific situation in which higher education finds itself. It should enable educational institutions not only to carry on successfully, but to forge ahead boldly and assert the intelligent leadership that is so necessary to our democracy today and in the future.\" American College Publicity Association, \" Higher Education A Public Relations Prob lem.\" An address June 1936, in Boston, and published by the Association in the interests of higher education, llpp. In this address, ELB discusses the public relations problems of colleges and universities. \"Before we can tackle this problem of public relations and higher education, we must know what the objectives of higher education are, for it is a fundamental in deal ing with public relations, that we must have clearly defined, just what it is we are projecting to the pub lic and yet, how often do we really get a formula tion of policy and of objectives as expressed by uni versity presidents:\" ELB says: \"Before higher educa tion can undertake its program of public relations it must satisfy itself regarding its own objectives. . . . The public relations counsel of a college or university needs an entirely new orientation about himself and his place in the scheme of things. . . . After you know your objectives, analyze public attitudes about your educational institution. The public rela tions officer of a university must understand this problem thoroughly and formulate a plan for action based on a knowledge of public opinion towards higher education and specifically, his kind of higher education. . . . The next step is to educate the public regarding the function of his university in higher education.\" To do this effectively, the use of symbols is suggested. \"The symbols are short cuts to thinking to understanding. Leadership rests on the ability to understand, to interpret and to utilize"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"33 symbols. . . . Political strategists understand these realities. The most powerful national leaders of to day Hitler in Germany, Mussolini in Italy, Stalin in Russia know the value of symbols. . . . These men realize that their struggle for the public's in terest, the public's attention, and the public's support, is in essence a struggle for response to sym bols. ... In the last analysis, an intelligent under standing of symbols, their meanings, and their proper utilization is vital to the continued success of education and educational institutions, as regards their relations with the public. . . . This use of symbols is an important matter to all of you. . . . Your higher education must be placed before the public using symbols the public understands.\" American Hatter. \"800 Hatmen Dine.\" Jan 1935. p. 25. In addition to his suggestions as to public relations methods and techniques at the Ninth Annual Hat Trade Dinner ... at the Commodore Hotel, New York, ELB is quoted at length as having stressed \"the need for the industry's adapting itself to new conditions. . . . Mr. Bernays also said that \"This means that as a primary consideration, you, as an industry, must study your relation to the world you live in. You must know what the public's attitude is toward you and your product, why the attitude is what it is, what the motives are of the public to act as it does, what those motives can lead to in terms of your business and your future. The first step ... is to see and study the motives of your public in relationship to your industry. The second step is to take the results of that study and research and develop recommendations for action. ...

Oct 26, 1933. ELB said: \"The oil industry has considerable to live down. . . .

Childs. ELB said: \"Propaganda, like medicine or law, can be socially used or abused. Under present day condi tions, the usefulness of propaganda makes it a vital asset to the democracy. Propaganda is the voice of the people in the democracy of today because it gives everyone an opportunity to present his point of view. Fascist or Communist societies have no alternate propagandas; they must accept the official propaganda of those in power. Freedom of propa ganda is as important to our democracy as our other civil liberties freedom of religion, press, speech and assembly. Propaganda provides an open forum for the people in which opposing ideas are presented for the judgment of the public. Propaganda enables social development to take place more reasonably than it otherwise would in a democracy. . . . Wom en's suffrage, the effective battles against tubercu losis and diabetes, were hastened by propaganda. . . . There is no secret about sound propaganda. The propagandist pleads his case before the court of public opinion, as does the lawyer before the court of law. Public and social service institutions as well as private industrialists must use propaganda to achieve their purpose.\" ELB then points out that propaganda is used by social movements, great foundations, industry, minority groups, food growers and distributors. Babson Institute of Business Administration. \" How American Business Can Sell the American Way of Life to the American People\" Address delivered at the Fourth Annual Conference of Businessmen and Educators, Babson Institute of Business Administration. Babson Park, Mass: Babson Institute Press, 1950. 15pp. An editorial note explains that ELB's talk was the main address at the evening session of the Fourth Annual Conference of Businessmen and Educators, attended by 1,000 members. The talk was followed by a panel discussion participated in by ELB; U. S. Senator Owen Brewster from Maine; Carl A. Gray, manufacturer; William Green, president, A. F. of L. ; Prof. Joseph O. Hirschfelder, chemist and physicist, University of Wisconsin; Clyde K. M. Kluckhorn, Professor of Anthropology, Harvard University; Kenneth E. Oberholtzer, Superintendent of Schools, Denver, Colorado; and William G. Saltonstall, Prin cipal, Phillips Exeter Academy. ELB's talk, the editorial note adds, was broadcast by the NBC network and by WNYC, New York. The panel discussion was broadcast by the Yankee network, WNYC and the Mutual network. In his talk, ELB says that American business has spent fabulous sums of money since 1935 to sell \"the American way of life\" to the American people. Has business succeeded? And if not, how can it succeed in doing so? Quoting business leaders who have recently complained of industry's failure to sell itself to the public despite vast expenditures for that purpose, ELB says the trouble is that business is following an antiquated pattern in identifying the American way of life solely with machinery and products, instead of primarily with the human and social needs of the American people. \"Business,\" he says, \"has identi fied the American way of life principally with tech-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"34 nology, machinery and living standards\" to the ex clusion of other factors and has therefore been selling it \"like soap, toothpaste or breakfast food.\" While business has equated the American way with tools, technology and production, ELB con tinues, large sections of the American people have equated it with \"the social aspects of living, eco nomic security, psychological security, status, self assertion.\" The present situation \"requires a complete reorientation of business thought and ac tion to an emphasis not alone on factories, machin ery, markets and products, but also on the worker,\" he adds. \"When our business structure, our produc ing machinery satisfies the social needs of workers and citizens, our problem of selling will be solved.\" ELB quotes Standard Oil of New Jersey, General Electric and Bank of Manhattan executives, and the report of The Ford Foundation trustees to show that this attitude is spreading and that \"many busi ness leaders are developing a new dynamic concept of their role in American society.\" This, he adds, may lead to a change in the public relations of business \"based on the acceptance by business of all its social responsibilities. ' ' In conclusion ELB urges business to attempt sell ing the American way of life to the American people by concentrating on: 1. the extension of employee economic security; 2. the extension of employee psychological security; 3. the extension of activities giving self-respect and status to the employee; 4. activities aimed at giving employees and their children opportunities for advancement; and 5. active participation by the corporation in the life and growth of the community. The Bankers Magazine. \"A Program for Public Relations.\" N. Y: Oct 1936, pp. 349-350. Editorial Note: \"In an address before the Massa chusetts Bankers Association, Mr. Bernays who specializes in public relations, offered this five point program as a means of restoring favorable public opinion of the banks: \"First, the old conception of public relations must give to the new conception. . . . The banks must recognize that their interest is also the public's inter est, that everything they do is a public function as well as being part of private business. . . . The second step is analysis self -analysis and analysis of public thoughts and desires about banks. . . . The banks must know not only economic and finan cial conditions, but also public attitudes. A survey of public opinion toward banks should be made before any plan is developed. . . . The third step is organization of the banks for the economic educa tion of the public. ... In this process of public education the banker can well take a lesson from the statesman and politician. . . . He must use the sound methods of public education that other groups educational, social, political have used effec tively. His program must be in the public interest. The fourth step is a definition and redefinition, in your public education, of the simple, common sym bols of banking that have lost their old meanings in the last six years. . . . The public has listened to all kind of wild and extravagant ideas about banking. . . . Sound ideas about banking should now be placed before the public in symbols which the public understands. . . . Lastly, the banker himself must assume in the community the place of leadership that he deserves and that the American system demands of him. . . . He must assert his leadership in pro jects not associated with banking, as well as in bank ing.

Y: Broadcast over WQXR. 12pp. In this talk, ELB discusses private interest and pub lic responsibility of the groups that make up Amer ica's economic and social life. He points out that private interest and public responsibility are chang ing concepts in a rapidly changing world; indicates the various elements, historical and contemporary, which have brought this country to the present crisis; urges first, reconsideration of old attitudes, then altered actions toward these concepts of private interest and public responsibility. \"Interdependence and converging of the private interest and public responsibility are recognized to day as an integral part of our democratic system,\" says ELB. \"The public today asks the groups of our society to examine their consciences, their attitudes and their actions to find out whether they really conform to the new demands made upon them by a society in which democratization of our institutions is taking place. Those desires reflect a world-wide movement towards what Alvin Johnson has called 'equalitarianism* in all countries where might, coercion, censorship and removal of civil liberties have not suppressed the desires of the people. The movement which has found expression in the secret ballot, in general suffrage and in representative parliaments, demands a lessening of the insistence on private rights, interests and prerogatives and a greater insistence on the rights of the common man,\" always within the framework of the free, com petitive system, civil liberties and our democratic form of government. ELB also warns against \"selling our liberties in exchange for our desire for security.\" ELB then outlines activities in which groups and individuals can participate in order to create con verging lines of private interest and public responsi bility. These are: 1. Codes of ethics and practice voluntarily entered into and accepted by indus tries and trades through their associations. 2. Similar codes carried out by the professions. 3.

Second, you must consider fashion just as you would consider any other industrial phenomenon in which competi tion plays a major and a vital part. Third, you must see that the success of any fashion, within limits, is to be reduced to a battle of symbols for that fashion's supremacy. Fourth, you must be prepared to fight fashion's battles on a hundred fronts. And last of all, you must arm yourselves for the waging of those battles, with every weapon and with strategy that modern propaganda stands ready to thrust into your hands,\" p. 10.

An analysis of the public relations problems of financial institutions with a three-point public re lations action program: (1) The public must learn that it needs the banks and cannot do without them in whatever setup there is; (2) The public must be educated in the meaning and importance of banks; words expressing the entire function and nature of financial institutions, must be re-defined and re- clarified so that every member of the public will have a clear idea of the value of the word symbols that go to make up the bank; (3) Activities must be un dertaken to re-establish banks and bankers in the public mind through their own deeds as community leaders. \"How to Remove the Public's Antagonism toward Financial Institutions.\" A talk delivered at the Convention, Atlantic City, N.

Among them were: General Foods Corporation, Burlington Mills, National Cash Register, . . . Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., Armour and Company, Pillsbury Mills, Inc., Allegheny Ludlum Steel Cor poration, Rexall Drug Company, Chrysler Corpora tion, The Celotex Corporation, Transcontinental & Western Air, Inc., Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company, and Ford Motor Company. A wide range of products was covered by [the] correspondents foods, textiles, drugs, machinery, steel, aircraft, optical supplies, tobacco, finance, utilities, con struction materials, rubber, glass, and other fields of industrial action in 21 states.\" ELB says, \"I told them I was studying house organs and their relation ship to management, ... a new field which re quired thorough analysis in order to be of greater use to management. Would they tell me about their experience with their own house organs? Would they evaluate the impact of these magazines on the pub lics for which they are intended? I added that I would try to chart a course for the future which might be of practical use to management, provided management told me (1) the purpose which the house organ was designed to fulfill in their organiza tion; (2) whether the house organ met that purpose; (3) what its present achievements and shortcomings were. My letter of inquiry received an almost 50 per cent response. Of the 100 companies, I heard from 49. Seventy per cent of the 49 had house organs. Thirty-two firms answered our questionnaire in detail. It is significant that 14 of these letters, or 44 per cent were signed by top management presi dent, vice president, chairman of the Board, or other officer. This indicates a genuine interest in house organs by top management. Eighteen of the replies, or 56 per cent, came from public relations directors and editors.\" In order \"to evaluate the replies against a broader background,\" ELB presents se lected \"facts and figures on the development of house organs in the U.S.\" He discusses the replies given by the corporations to each question in an itemized summary of high points in attitudes and facts re vealed, synthesizes these findings as to the broad picture, before offering his particular suggestions for improvement, bolstered from specific examples.

Jun 24, 1941. 16pp. In this address, delivered six months before Pearl Harbor, ELB discusses \"public relations during the Great War in Germany, England and the United States, the changes in psychological approach and technical developments since 1917, and such activi ties today in the three countries.\" The talk analyzes in detail propaganda techniques during and after World War I and suggests a public relations program for the United States designed to maintain high morale. \"Our people have already provided billions of dol-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"36 lars for physical armies and armaments. Through their elected representatives they have voted for the first peacetime selective service army in the life of the nation. If we are to be fully prepared for what ever may come, the people must become equally convinced that psychological ramparts in this coun try must be as strong as our physical ramparts. Such beliefs must be founded on greater economic and psychological security for the individual on a strengthening of democracy and of faith in it. Such belief based on an understanding of our aims will express itself in a will to victory and in sacrifice. Such belief will insure an even flow of supplies to the army from the industrial plants of the nation.\" Urging \"a balanced public relations effort\" to achieve this goal, ELB suggests: \"The Government needs a psychological general staff to advise on all major questions of morale in industry, civilian life, army and navy. This staff would provide the soundest available knowledge for building morale and for psychological warfare and by having on top the ablest technicians, would speed up the entire morale building processes. Such a Morale Commis sion in its field of psychological defenses can take its place on a parity with the General Staff in physical defenses.\" ELB sums up his proposed public relations pro gram for the Government as follows: \"First, a Morale Commission of experts, advisers, to draw up a master plan for morale and psychological warfare; second, a program to strengthen faith in democracy; third, a program to strengthen democracy; and fourth, a program to sell the army to the people and the people to the army.\" . \"The Mobilization of Public Opinion.\" Talk before the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, Washington, D. C.: Publication Num ber L48-164, The Industrial College of the Armed Forces, Jun 14, 1948. 13pp. A survey and analysis of the techniques and media for mobilizing public opinion in a national emergency with a three point suggested action program: \"(1) ... A central organization [for mobilizing public opinion], manned by personnel skilled in the tech niques of mass communication, and headed by a director appointed by the President. This director must, of course, be an expert in the field of mass persuasion . . . [and] would function in coordina tion with a committee of Cabinet officers. (2) Suffi cient authority must be vested in the director to enable him to avoid duplication and even com petition in the spheres of policy, strategy and methods. Just as a commanding general runs his armies subject to the authority of the General Staff, so must this director guide his centralized activity, aimed at engineering the consent of the public . . . [not through] control or coercion, not thought con trol . . . [but through] . . . persuasion and in formation. (3) The director will naturally coordinate his strategy and methods with those of the Armed Forces and of all other civilian governmental agen cies. . . . Ideas in news and pictures would be put before the public continually through press associa tions, radio, motion pictures, news syndicates, maga zines, books, television. The truth would be used; lies, distortion, twisted ideas are unsound and dan gerous. Limiting factors on the effectiveness of ... activity would be of course events beyond . . . control, . . . the extent to which the communica tions network can penetrate into the minds of the people, the expertness with which the work is carried \"General structure of the organization . . . would follow [that] ... of the Committee of Public In formation in World War I and the Office of War Information in World War II. But with this differ ence, that the organization would not be regarded by government leaders as a nuisance or a sop to public curiosity but as a vital part of our defense and that it would receive the support and expert guidance that it requires. A wide variety of activities would be covered. ... It might be divided into three sec tions: administrative, domestic and foreign. In the domestic section many subordinate agencies would be at work. There would be a foreign language news paper division, a picture division, a film division, a pictorial publicity division, a speaking division, a syndicate feature division, a women's war work divi sion and supervisory censorship division. Tomorrow, such an operation might be of necessity more com plex, cover a wider variety of efforts.\" Basic to the suggestion of this action program is ELB's premise that \"an effectively mobilized public opinion is our most important strength in war . . . [during which, for mobilization] . . . resources are four-fold: men, money, materiel and public opinion. The first three can be stockpiled in advance. . . . Public opinion can be stockpiled on a long time ap proach, but not by warehousing or training, since it is an intangible. The long-time approach is to change the objective surroundings of our people . . . con tinuously to strengthen democracy, through govern ment and private groups, furthering constructive social programs that will ensure psychological and economic security of the people. The short-time approach to be used only after a fighting war has started, is by presenting significant symbols, words and pictures to our people, through a government controlled bureau, using the campaign drive method of persuasion and information. . .\" In this 5000-word lecture, considerations and methods necessary to the development of both short- time and long-time approaches are discussed and defined including, for instance, an examination of the nature of public opinion, morale and patriotism the psychological factors involved in \"static\" as well as \"dynamic\" public opinion, ascertainable through research-information and knowledge. In these connections, among other things, ELB says: \". . . it is impossible to give more than the briefest suggestion of the psychological factors that go into the making of public opinion. A great deal of information is available, and more knowledge must be gained. However, these factors should never be overlooked in forming policies or programs, or in"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"carrying them out. . . . It is necessary to appraise [as an example] the mechanism and force of ra tionalization, that familiar process by which people suppress, even to themselves, the real reasons that lead them to make decisions, and invent instead plausible reasons that satisfy them. We have to know the difference between rationalizations and the un derlying motivations, if we are successfully to appeal to the public for support. Identification with group aims is another factor that needs constructive con sideration. Conformity to mass pressure is powerful in making public opinion. So is compensation for the many economic, social and cultural frustrations of present day life. . . . We know that a man's morale is good when he acts on his belief that he has some thing worth fighting for, when he merges his interests with those of the group. ... It may result from recognition that society is functioning in his behalf. He will feel this is true if he has psychological and economic security. . . . The ego satisfaction that men derive from active identification with a group is so powerful as a morale factor that it should be carefully studied and fostered. . . . We must ensure that what we fight for will survive a war. Our war aims must not endanger our national traditions of freedom, equality and orderly justice. These aims must take the interests of the people into account; . . . must recognize the kind of world Americans want. For example, . . . expanding freedom, eco nomic, educational and social opportunities and full civil rights, loosely, what we call a better life for all. . . . Public opinion should be based solidly on facts and emotions, on truth honorably presented, on justice of the cause, on an understanding of a real and immediate danger and faith of the people in one another. These facts must ... be backed by the realities of the good life in this country. . . . Re search should precede any approach to a problem of this kind, . . . should tell us whose attitudes need to be intensified, whose need to be converted to our point of view, whose point of view should be negated. Such a research discloses the relative public aware ness of the situation at the time, agreement or dis agreement with our war objectives, the extent of the public's determination to achieve these objectives, its belief in our achievements thus far, its awareness of the size of the task.

[Also,] research in the widely differing educational levels of our population. . . . The problem of presenting the basic underlying facts on which understanding is to be based is a most difficult one therefore. . . .

Outlines the \"public relations or information and morale program ... as a way of insuring that, when and if a war emergency arises in the United States, the people will be as well prepared in morale as the armed forces are in manpower and materiel.\" ELB lists three \"indispensable basic factors\" which must be taken into account in \"any basic plan for building the morale of the people\" and \"pre paring the people of this country for an emergency.\" The basic assumptions are: \"it is necessary to de velop and maintain maximum security with maxi mum liberty; the government and the people are one; the loyalties of all sections of the government and the nation must be focused on a common goal.\" ELB then outlines the following seven-point pub lic relations program: \"(1) make full use of research as a basis of policy and practices of government in dealing with the public; (2) develop a well-organized peacetime public information bureau; (3) let the government deliberately and overtly encourage free public discussion in peace time; (4) in its whole public relations and informational policy, the gov ernment should emphasize not words alone, but deeds; (5) institute a continuing series of conferences and discussions between government and leaders of the important groups in our society, including farm ers, labor, commerce, industry and the armed forces; (6) add higher formal education to the training pro gram of the armed forces in peace time; (7) develop a more democratic army in order to give men and officers greater community of interest in working toward a common goal.\" ELB concludes: \"The program I am suggesting is predicated on our history, on our experience as a nation and on the science of human relations as developed by the various social sciences; and it pre serves our fundamental principles of security and individual liberty.

C. Oct 11, 1949. ELB says: \"Because national action in a democracy depends on public opinion, we need a new approach to economic and military mobilization, and to con duct warfare. This requires expert knowledge of mass and individual psychology, as well as expert knowl edge of the techniques of communication. You are giving serious attention to this vital matter. This shows the Armed Forces no longer believe, as they often did in the past, that technology is everything and that public opinion can be handled casually through handouts and headlines which glamorize this or that general, this or that army in the public mind. . . . \"Mobilization, then, must be divided into two major areas of action. One is the mobilization of men, money and materiels for the creation of physical armies and resources in case of war. . . . The second form of mobilization is ideological. ... I believe it is possible to stockpile public opinion for economic mobilization for victory as it is to stockpile things if we go at it in the right way and on a planned basis. . . . But we must realize at the outset that public opinion cannot be expected to depend on words alone; it depends upon deeds as well. The building public opinion for economic mobilization must be based, to be sure, on facts, on truth, on the justice of our cause, on an understanding by the people of the danger our country faces, and on the faith of the people in one another. But it must also be backed by realities, by the achievement of a good life within the country. Efforts directed to giving the people the psychological and economic security they desire in the United States, if successful, should eventuate in a vast reserve of favorable public opinion. . . . This long-range approach, by improving the mental and physical health, the economic security and education of the American people, and by eliminating discrimi nation, promotes high morale. . . . Now as to the second approach, the wartime approach ... In such an approach, a central government-controlled bureau presents significant word and picture symbols to our people. Such a bureau would use the methods practiced successfully in two world wars to mobilize public opinion. . . . Only experts in the field of public opinion, men who are deeply versed in its skills and deeply rooted in our democratic tradition can give us the kind of organization and techniques which will educate and mobilize the public for a national emergency while maintaining our demo cratic pattern intact.\" Institute on World Control of Atomic Energy. \" National Committee on Atomic Information.\" Report on the Institute on Atomic Information.

Speakers were: Hon. Henry A. Wallace, John Han cock, Clark Eichelberger, ELB and others. ELB said in part: \"The way to dispel fear is to supply the people with the knowledge and facts the experts have. This must be done in terms the people will both understand, and be willing to act upon. The people will become articulate when they know the facts. They will then squarely support one of the plans proposed for internationalizing the atomic bomb. That is the people's role. The tremendous expansion of communications in the United States has given America the world's most highly organized network for spreading ideas.\" ELB recommended planned action for disseminating information about the atomic bomb so that they could \"be sure your material fits the public you are interested in reaching.\" International Association of Milk Dealers. \"Better Public Understanding for the Fluid Milk Industry.\" Proceedings, 27th Annual Convention, Oct 15-17, 1934. pp. 215-230.

(2) A scientific analysis of the public, including not only an estimate of what the public thinks and expects of you, but attention to where public opinion is veering. (3) A study of this analysis with a view to making necessary changes in your policies, products or service to con form to public desires and making whatever changes are advisable.

Discussing use of statistical methods in public relations, ELB says statistics can in certain cases lay down the pattern for public relations activities in ad vance, gauge trend lines, indicate the amount of ef fort to be applied, determine the effectiveness of a public relations effort, strengthen the ideas advanced in propaganda, employ the \"tyranny of numbers\" for socially useful purposes.

Issued by The Merchants' Association of New York. Apr 7, 1937. 9pp. In this talk, ELB discusses the basic theme of the World's Fair of 1939 and how to develop and expand it. After Grover Whalen's statement that the Fair would look forward to the task of \" 'Building the world of tomorrow,' \" ELB says: \"In the last seven years, many of our old values, through economic forces, have been deflated. The world is in a chaotic state. It needs leadership. To revitalize the relation ship of our system to the common man is a contribu tion the Fair must make. The Fair must be made to show how our democracy works, how it can be main tained. . . . Let us sell America to Americans. . . . How can this be carried out effectively? . . . The Fair must relate the things which are shown, to what they have done for us as individuals, and as a system in the last 150 years; to what they will con tinue to do for us. Let us by all means picture the activities of America with concrete examples coal mines, copper mines, assembly lines, shoe factories all these. I am all for the concrete, the vivid, the actual reality. But this is not enough. . . . Such a Fair must show graphically the interrelationship of the various groups that make up our life the relationship of private industry and private enter prise to government and to the people; the relation ship of farm and industry; the relationship of men and management. . . . Give them these facts at the Fair, graphically displayed in words, actions, dis plays, through every form of thought conveyor, and we can depend upon the people to make the soundest choice possible. . . . Not to strike, throughout all these great efforts, one dominant and responsive key note of vital interest to everyone early in the Fair, that will identify the coming Fair with the hopes and aspirations of every man, is to lose one of the most potent effects that the Fair can produce, and to lose, at the same time, the highest potential of interest and success the Fair can achieve. Not only will such a point of view modify the attitudes and actions of those who come to the Fair, but in its development, it will tend to crystallize the attitudes and actions of all those associated with the Fair exhibitors, key participants.

ELB says: \"The exigencies of total warfare demand that every institution in the democracy re-examine, re-evaluate itself to find its place in the democracy under these wartime conditions, and to fit itself more effectively into the peace that will follow the war. Total warfare today has three fronts the eco nomic, the military, and the psychological. . . . The museums of the country, whether they are art, or historical or natural history museums, can be used as a stirring background for emotion, factual evidence, and tradition in shaping men's and women's atti tudes. That is one way in which the museum can be come a dynamic and forceful contributor to the war effort and to the peace that is to come. . .\" ELB reports that survey he made among museum"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"40 directors reveals museums face four major problems: (1) organization the problem of personnel to head museums; (2) support for museums inadequate contributions and the problem to get people to at tend and use museums; (3) the problem of satisfying needs of various groups which use museums children, adults, soldiers; (4) the public relations problem of \"utilizing all avenues of approach to the public to meet your problems of financial support and attendance.\" ELB then outlines three out standing functions of the museum in wartime: (1) the strengthening of morale through increasing the people's belief in the future and themselves by show ing them the past and the present; (2) providing escape for a population made tense by wartime stress; (3) providing and maintaining the creative spirit so important to our democratic pattern and its future. ELB adds: \"These three important objectives are newsworthy. . . . Public relations with deeds is more effective than public relations with words. . . .

Second, make a study of your community to find out what the prevailing attitudes and interests are, find out the channels of communi cation and their interests.

Pittsburgh, Nov 1925. 8pp. A discussion of the techniques of public relations as applied to government. After emphasizing the need to \"sell\" good govern ment to a community, ELB outlines the techniques. \"You may perhaps wonder at the use of the term 'selling good government.' Yet good government can be sold to a community just as any other commodity can be sold to a community. . . . Any intelligent handling of a problem in selling good government to a community must take into consideration the exist ing status of public opinion in the community where the 'sale' is going to be made. . . . The basic reason underlying such an analysis is the fact that men's opinions are most often changed by their acceptance of the opinions of those whom they regard as leaders. Remember, then, that this analysis should try as closely as possible to gauge the importance of the relative values of different leaders in the political thought of the community. . . . Now that the technician has mastered the first step in his 'sales campaign,' he proceeds to the second . . . and analyzes the appeals of his good government project to the community. He realizes that the individual and the group are swayed by only a very small num ber of fundamental desires and emotions and in stincts. . . . The protagonist of good government, then, selects such appeals as will best serve to reach the groups he desires to influence. . . . The basic appeal or keynote of the campaign having been developed, the good government special pleader next has to consider the physical approaches to his public. . . . The platform, the motion picture (from a news- reel standpoint), the radio, the magazines, the direct mailing piece, the word-of-mouth ' spoken thought, the parade, the mass meeting every method of approach to the public through the senses must be made. . . . The special pleader has a simple matter when it comes to the utilization of these media, which I shall group together, with the exception of the daily press. He must simply study their con-"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"41 stituent organism as it exists at the time he is waging his campaign and find the greatest common denomi nator of interest between the medium and the appeal he has decided upon for his public, keeping in mind the group formation of society referred to previously. . . . Your group leaders, induced on some essential and basic interest to further your cause, and selected to fit into the media, will influence their constituents and larger interlapping groups. Given a cause that needs the whole community's support, it is a possi bility to secure the interest of any number of differ ent group leaders on varied appeals to sponsor the cause, and reflect them through the channels men tioned, to publics that will eventually include the whole community in terms of their own interests. ... I have left the newspaper to the last because it is a problem in itself and to it as an influence in molding public opinion could be devoted a special course of lectures. . . . Your special pleader, there fore, who cannot, because of physical and monetary limitations, publish his own newspapers to present his point of view, must continually think of his prob lem in terms of creating circumstances that will cause the desired expression in the minds of the public he is trying to reach, and which will at the same time compare in the market place for news of that given day with other news which the given newspaper is printing. The circumstances which he creates must embody the basic appeal he has de veloped as the one to which his public will respond, and it must embody this appeal in the form of a happening which will be as important, or more im portant, than other happenings in that particular place on that particular day. . . . The technique of influencing public opinion is then a problem to be gone at step by step. It demands a survey of the market the public, an analysis of the thought- buying habits of the 'buying' group, a study of the physical media of approach and a harmonizing of appeal to the media and to the public.\" National Newspaper Promotion Association. \"Public Relations for the American Daily Newspaper.\" A talk delivered by Edward L. Bernays, counselor in public relations, April 25, 1944. Reproduced and distributed by the Asso ciation as a service to the cause of American newspapers. 14pp. Discussing the public relations of America's daily newspapers, ELB says: \"If my talk to you today on the public relations of America's daily newspapers is to be of any practical value to you, your newspaper and to the public, it must be based on an objective weighing of all the facts available. That is the only way to deal with any situation realistically look at the facts, interpret them, and let recommenda tions stem from analysis and synthesis. . . . To deal with the problem realistically then, we must examine three sets of facts and state the assumption on which we shall interpret facts that a democracy needs a free and independent press, as a purveyor of news and as a social instrument of leadership. First, what are the policies and practices that govern the public relations of American daily newspapers today? Sec ond, what are the attitudes of the American people toward the daily press today? Third, what are the issues and goals the American people are interested in now and for the postwar period?\" After discussing his survey answers to these ques tions, ELB continues: \"We have examined the three sets of facts we started out to. Now what are the conclusions and recommendations? If the newspaper effectively serves the public as a news purveyor and a social instrument, we do not need to be concerned with the newspaper as a private enterprise. . . . Our recommendations obviously apply to the daily newspaper field as a whole. . . . Newspapers must act on the basic consideration that a democracy needs a free and independent press which purveys accurate complete news, and is also a social instru ment of leadership for constructive improvement. . . . Large circulations and advertising are not necessarily an index to the social value of a news paper. If social values are not maintained, in the long run newspapers may lose their status as public service institutions and encounter a tendency by the public towards restriction, control and regulation even despite the first amendment. It is not incon ceivable that pressures may be brought to bear against the press, that is not considered by the public to be living up to its privileged status. ... As to platforms of a leadership character, here are our recommendations: Greater emphasis should be placed on national and international social goals in the platforms of American newspapers. Planks of local character, emphasizing physical improvements in a community, now so generally used, might well be reconsidered. Greater emphasis might be placed on promoting local social goals, consistent, of course, with national and international social goals. The American people are vitally interested in postwar jobs, social reforms, social security, educational and other aid for returning soldiers, a chance to advance themselves, a recognition of their personal contribu tion to America and to the next generation. Planks of this kind, it seems to me, might be given emphasis on a local as well as national basis. As to planks of a news purveying character, these are well stated by the newspapers of the country. It is apparent that what they stand for is not as acceptable to the public as they ought to be. Newspapers to maintain their status must not only adhere to these planks, they must make a vigorous avowal of them to the public. Platforms must be continually 'sold' to the public in every possible way. The press must consciously make the public recognize its values in both the field of social leadership and news purveying. . . . The press must not only have sound leadership platforms and sound news policies and practices, it must 'sell' both to the public. In the leadership field, it can devel op vigorous campaigns for action. In the news purvey ing field, it must stand not only for freedom from prejudice but 'sell' this freedom from prejudice to the public. It must 'sell' to the public constantly that it is truthful and accurate, particularly in those areas in which the public appears to doubt its fair-"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"42 ness, its treatment of politicians and politics, labor and labor leaders, business and businessmen, foreign affairs, religious and racial problems.\" National Society for Crippled Children and Adults. \" Achieving Goals for the Handicapped.\" Proceedings 1949 Annual Convention.

You may have the best cause in the world, but the public must be convinced that it is important before it will sup port it. The public importance of a cause is in direct ratio to its visibility, to its being on the front page, so to speak, of communications that reach and make public opinion. . . . You must then create visibility for your movement high visibility on a national, statewide and local basis. This is your first problem in any attempt to educate the public for the achieve ment of your stated goal. \"... the problem of educating the public is a much broader problem. We might call it a problem of social engineering, or a problem of engineering the consent of the public for your goals. \"The first step ... is to insure that your goals are realistic, that they are attainable and that they are effectively refined and defined. . . . Research of the public will tell you whether the manpower, the money and the organizational facilities available to you now can meet your hoped-for goal. . . . You will also find out by research of the public what the social forces in the community are that may work with you, . . . what your publics are, what they are made up of, what they are motivated by, what the special fields of activity that appeal to these publics are. . . . Research of this kind will help you to define goals that will appeal to the public. \"While selling your words to editors, publishers, radio commentators, writers and other opinion mold- ers, you must also integrate yourself with the com munity where you function, with the key social groups that make up the community and its social pattern on a local level, a statewide level, a national level. \". . . possibly one way to cope with the problems of educating the American public to understand the needs of crippled children and adults and to support your cause, is for you to set up a central board of strategy consisting of representatives of your Na tional Society and of other groups. . . .

Addressing the Conference of leading New England Manufacturers, ELB said: \"The importance of pub lic relations today, it seems to me, is that the busi ness man must regard it as more than articulation; he must regard it as a basic and underlying part of his responsibility to the world he lives in. He must recognize that only if the public interest and the private profit coincide can he maintain and develop his own business and the broader system of which it is a part.\" ELB reports on the \"Goodwill Survey\" which he made for the Industrial Committee of the New Eng land Council. This survey was sent to 2500 New Eng land manufacturers, of whom 263 or 10.5% replied. Of this survey, ELB said: \"It aimed to find out whether your community realized the contribution made to its economic life by your company, inquired as to whether your community was friendly to your company, and whether your company was friendly to the community; asked as to the appearance of your company's officers before local groups in the community; inquired, specifically, as to the par ticipation of your company in community affairs. Then it queried whether certain different kinds of information were made available to local newspapers and other agencies in the community; whether you encouraged visits to your plants; what employee in formation relationships you carried on; what plant identification you had; what plant exhibits you pro vided, what local activities you participated in to wards a furtherance of your business, and what you considered the chief barriers or obstacles to good relations between industry and your com munity. \"... business must retain the system of private enterprise, of private profit and of free competition which made America.

In influencing and motivating the group to action, sym bols and cliches play a most significant role. . . . Leaders must devise symbols that will interpret the disappointed and the latent beliefs of the public and that will stand again for the public's desires. A new symbol-maker will be a new leader, if his sym bols are valid. . . .

This technique is daily being applied to every field of human activity. . . . The world of industry par ticularly must recognize that it is not only dealing with three dimensional objects and methods through which to move them to the public.

Introducing him, Mrs. William Brown Maloney, Chairman of the Forum and editor of This Week, said: \"The next speaker on this program is by way of being a sort of institution. A nephew of that famous psycholo gist, Dr. Sigmund Freud, his training and environ ment made him a student of human nature, and in his early life he became interested in the psychol ogy of the crowd. He read a play called 'Damaged Goods,' believed it should be given to the public for the public's own good, and undertook to put it over. Doing this was not just a press agent's job selling that play to the public meant con verting the legal profession, the medical profession, the educators and the press to acceptance of a more open discussion of social problems than they had ever known before. That was Mr. Bernays' first experience as a public counsellor. Today he is one of the foremost men in that profession; has, in fact, been largely instrumental in creating the profession as such. I want to quote something he said about it several years ago. 'Propaganda is simply special pleading projected in terms of the public interest. This can be used to antisocial purpose.' Ida Tarbell asked him what was the difference in the propaganda methods of a statesman and a demagogue. He an swered that the difference was that one man had a social purpose and the other didn't. It is the differ- ference between the honest lawyer and a shyster lawyer; between a reputable doctor and a quack; between humanism and egotism. Mr. Bernays has been the adviser of presidents, of high government officials, of big business. He is the author of two well- known books Propaganda and Crystallizing Pub lic Opinion\" In his speech ELB said: \"Americans must recognize that in the science of propaganda they have at their command a real weapon with which to consolidate and make effective the work and contributions of past and present generations that have built up our present-day system an economic and governmental system which we do not desire to exchange for any other.\" New York State Title Association. \" Mr. Bernays' Address 'Private Interest and Public Respon sibility.' \" May 5-6, 1939, pp. 59-66.

Pennsylvania State College. \"Human Relations The Way to Labor -Management Adjustments\" Bulletin. Vol. XLI, No. 7. Feb 14, 1947. pp. 15- 22. A paper presented at the 23rd Annual In dustrial Conference of the College, State Col lege, Pa. ELB said: \"The attempt of either management or labor to win public opinion to its side alone is in itself no solution. The job of management, as it is of labor, is to put its own house in order so that it can begin to develop a public opinion that will itself look be yond the conflicting claims of group interest. There is no short-cut to this goal.\" ELB discusses the basic problems of labor-manage ment maladjustments and appeals to management to \"bring its thinking up to date. . . . \"How can management build a real case that both the public and labor will accept? In dealing with labor-management problems, management suffers from a cultural time lag. This phrase succinctly de scribes the gap which exists between what people actually do and what they could do in the light of the knowledge available. . . . The question resolves itself into management's attitudes and actions to wards the worker and the representatives of manage ment, from pay to ventilation. . . . Today indus trial management must apply to its industrial rela tions the theories of human behavior developed in the social science laboratories. To use this knowledge is not visionary. It is the highest type of practical, self-interest, enlightened reality. . . . An orderly solution to management's responsibilities is necessary before management can present a visible case for itself.\" In the hopes of stimulating such a solution, ELB offered a seven-point program: (1) study and codifying of study materials on human relations from all over the country; (2) management should contribute financial and personnel aid to organiza tions studying and publishing in the field; (3) management should actively support universities through scholarships and endowments; (4) tech nological research should be applied to increasing industrial productivity through more efficient ma chinery; (5) all plans for improving labor relations should be studied thoroughly; (6) more widespread and intelligent use should be made of specialized in dustrial relations personnel; (7) the public must be educated to an understanding of what the American system means to them. \"Management must do its part as labor to see that it conforms to the new conditions, that change is kept within a working evolutionary framework. About the only guarantee of industrial peace is for management to apply the science of human rela tionships to this problem. If management accepts its responsibility to achieve co-partnership with work ers, public opinion will support management's share in this accomplishment.\" Philco Distributors' & Dealers' Convention. \"Leadership.\" An address by Edward L.

Printing and Advertising Clinics. \"Public Rela tions A Challenge to the Graphic Arts.\" Talk at the Second of the Clinics, sponsored by the General Printing Ink Corporation, N. Y: Apr 16, 1940. 23pp. ELB discusses the problems of the graphic arts in dustry \"those engaged in the three processes of reproduction, letterpress, lithography and gravure, and the allied trades, the suppliers.\" He found out what the problems were by a na tionwide survey, among leaders of the industry printers, lithographers, engravers, professors in printing universities, editors and publishers of trade newspapers, type founders, labor leaders; manufac turers of presses, paper and other materials. The industry faces: (1) internal problems; (2) problems of relations with the broad public; (3) rela tions with its customers [pp. 6-7]. Industry leaders, ELB says, have six major complaints: (1) \"there are too many printers in the field and not enough crafts men . . . the lack of public appreciation of the graphic arts industry is due to the fact that there is too little appreciation within the industry itself as to what constitutes quality work; (2) the lack of realization of artistic potentialities by the indus try; (3) poor salesmanship; (4) poor promotion; (5) lack of cooperation in the industry; (6) the need for a coordinated and well-planned promotional campaign using every form of promotional media.\" ELB recommends the following public relations program for the graphic arts industry: \". . . call together . . . leaders from the various divisions of the industry to study the problems and suggest solu tions. ... I recommend that your Committee de velop a program of broad principles and practices for the graphic arts industry to follow. ... I sug gest that competent technicians be engaged to make a study of the public mind to find out just what the attitudes of your publics are . . . toward the prin ciples and goals you have decided upon ... a campaign of public education . . . using what we might call the engineering of consent, organized"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"45 persuasion, from advertising to mailing pieces, from personal suasion to industry resolutions, to win sup port both of your industry and public to the princi ples and practices you have decided upon.\" ELB says: \"Certainly, the graphic arts and the prosperity of this country are interdependent.

Every sound attempt should be made to solve the problem of their mutual interrelations and public relations.\" Progressive Education Association. Gulp, W.

Speaking as a member of the panel on educational freedom and propaganda at the Twentieth National Conference of the Progressive Education Associa tion, held from February 23rd to the 26th, ELB said: \"Freedom of using propaganda takes its place with the other freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.\" To Professor Leonard Doob's challenge that propa gandists try to influence public opinion in a con cealed manner, Mr. Bernays answered that there are ethics and standards for men in public relations as well as other professions. Robert Morris Associates. \"Public Good Witt as a Credit Factor.\" Address before New York Chapter. The Robert Morris Associates Monthly Bulletin, Vol. 18, No. 3, Aug 1935. pp. 49-52. ELB said: \"As far as the credit system is con cerned, . . . there may be periods in which people neither borrow nor lend. In such periods as these, it is vitally important for credit organizations to keep alive public belief in the institution of borrowing and lending, because should the habit of not utilizing the credit system become too firmly fixed, it would be extremely difficult to build up a new faith, without which the credit system must needs fail,\" p. 52. School Administration and Supervisors Con ference. \"Public Relations for Public Edu cation: How to Create Greater Public Under standing of the Public Schools: by Edward L. Bernays.\" An address delivered at The Second Annual Conference held at New York Univer sity on April 30, 1949. 8pp. ELB analyzes the current crisis in American educa tion, emphasizing educational needs and expendi tures, the prevalence of obsolete school buildings and crowded class rooms, the shortage of teachers, etc. He gives findings of attitude polls, showing what the public thinks about public education and sug gests techniques for educating the public to a greater understanding of the problem. ELB says: \"The facts about the crisis in education must be integrated with realizable social goals and they must be acted upon if the crisis is to be re solved. In order to achieve the necessary action, the consent of the public must be engineered in the de sired direction. In a world where thousands of facts compete daily for our attention, we must somehow focus public attention on the educational crisis in a way that will bring about social change in favor of a better educational system. . . . Public education has a particularly low visibility. This calls for even greater effort in making the public aware of what is involved and what must be done in the current edu cational crisis. . . . What we need today are volun tary groups which will educate the public about edu cation and so create the necessary public demand for laws that will save and improve our school system. . . . What is needed is that all the groups working for better education should speak with one voice, while each group retains its own freedom and re sponsibility to work for better education on its own level. Such a unification of effort would avoid the duplication and distortion which are bound to con fuse, instead of enlightening, the public.\" ELB then suggests the creation of a central board of strategy, consisting of leading lay groups and educators who would set policies and goals for American schools as a necessary step toward solving the crisis in education. This board would direct re search in the educational crisis and public attitudes, reorient objectives; work out a clear-cut plan of or ganization, strategy and tactics \"to engineer public consent in relation to this issue\"; use school buildings for public meetings, adult education, consumer train ing, recreational purposes; influence the public through the press, the radio, television, posters, pamphlets and motion pictures; achieve more ef fective cooperation between schools and parents, and between schools and the community. ELB con cludes: \"Coordinated effort alone will help us over come the present chaos in our educational system. And we must act quickly, for that chaos is very dangerous to our children and to our future, a deadly menace to the generations to come, the level of whose intelligence and character will determine what kind of America we shall have.\" Talks. \"Should Public Opinion Polls Be Licensed?\" Quarterly Digest of Addresses Presented in the Public Interest by the Columbia Network.

Bernays, eminent publicist and author of 'Crystallizing Public Opinion,' stated their divergent views over CBS, January 6. ELB said: 'We are no longer led by men. We are led around by polls. . . . Actually, public opinion is much more changeable than is indicated by the polls. . . . The government must protect the public against mal practices in polling. We license doctors, lawyers, ac countants and architects to protect the public. We set up standards of character and education which they must meet, and everyone favors this.

This must be based on a knowledge and understanding by the people of both countries of their common post-war problems and goals of defense, offense and economic relationship. Only on such common understanding can we both be assured that we shall best be serving our national destinies, which by tradition, economics and a common background are so closely bound together,\" p. 14. This plea was made in reference to ELB's proposal of \"an organization following the pattern of already existing boards ... a joint Canadian-United States Board for Mutual Understanding. ... A Joint Board for Mutual Understanding,\" he explained, \"provides a body which carries on a common pub licity activity to serve the interests of both coun tries, in that it gives the people of both countries the facts on which they may base their attitudes and . . . actions. Such a permanent Joint Board for Mutual Understanding should consist of an equal number of men representing both countries. These men should be appointed for life as are the judges of our highest tribunals . . . should have a deep love and understanding of the common interests of both countries and a knowledge of their common needs. . . . Such a Board should include from each country, one or two elder statesmen, a social psychologist, a newspaper publisher or radio executive, an adult educator, an expert in the field of public relations, and an advertising man. ... As democracies, each country must work on the premise that if the people of both countries are given sound information, the countries themselves through their representative and executive officers will determine sound policies. A budget will be provided . . . pub licly to be accounted for as is that of the Canadian W.I.B. or our own O.W.I. It will learn just what the public of one country knows about the other, what pre-conceived notions or ignorances prevent com plete understanding . . . will not mix into the politics of the moment . . . will plan and work for a long time rapprochement. . . . The board should consistently stimulate relations between the two countries through facilitating exchange of informa tion and viewpoint of key people in great social forces that make up both countries education, com merce and industry, agriculture, labor, the profes sions. The flow of ideas will not be a fortuitous one way flow . . . but rather . . . two-way . . .

[on] present war relationships [which] point the way to such a study\" \"mutual regard\" between the peoples of both countries, as shown by public opinion polls; the sense of being \"natural allies\" in regard to international relations; coopera tive activities, by agreement, of Canadian and U.

University of Chicago Round Table. \"Morale First Line of Defense?\" A Radio Discussion. Jan 18, 1941. 28pp. Participating in this radio discussion were ELB, described as \"Public Relations Counsel, New York City\"; Prof. Harold Lasswell, \"political scientist, Washington, D. C.\"; and Norman Thomas, \"Na tional Chairman of the Socialist Party, Candidate for President, 1928, 1932, 1936, 1940.\" The introductory note explains that \"The Round Table, oldest educational program continuously on the air, is broadcast entirely without a script. Subjects are chosen because of their social, political, or economic significance. The program has no 'ax to grind.' In the selection of speakers, the effort is to provide a balanced discussion by participants who have special competence and knowledge. The opinion of each speaker is his own. ...\" ELB is asked by Lasswell to define \"morale\": \"Morale is behavior,\" he says, \"behavior judged by someone on the outside in relationship to our goal. Under strong morale we have energy, enthusiasm, belief in our goals, and ideals. Under weak morale we have apathy, frustration, and breakdown. A strong morale means that we of the United States must have a common goal, a belief in our leaders, and a belief in ourselves.\" Subsequently, under \"Objective Questions for Examination,\" Round Table listeners are asked to \"Give Mr. Bernays' definition of 'morale.' \" Under \"Questions [. . . of wider scope . . .] For Analysis and Discussion,\" listeners are asked to \"Define your concept of what is meant by the term 'morale.' . . . Does your viewpoint coincide with that of either Mr. Bernays or Mr. Thomas [who questioned the sig nificance of, and relation of, 'common morale' to, and as against 'a right goal in democracy itself']. ... If not, how does it differ?\" ELB agrees with Thomas \"that the test of de mocracy in the next few years is going to be our suc cess in meeting unemployment and poverty. But,\" he adds, \"the success of our present democracy is going to depend upon this: Are we going to be able to meet the warfares against democracy that are taking place today . . . are we going to have morale?\"; he disagrees with Lasswell on the point \"that people in this country want democracy, but"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"47 . . . have no agreement on ways and means toward democracy.\" ELB says: \". . . by the best statis tical count, there are ten million people in this coun try who are more sympathetic to other types of sys tems than they are to democracy. What I fear is that we are so interested in discussing the future that we don't pay the attention we should to realiz ing the same type of active, dynamic force for democracy as that developed by those who are op posed. . . \" ELB and Lasswell agree that \"it is perfectly pos sible for a democracy to fight a war,\" in contradic tion to Thomas who \"won't say that it is wholly im possible [but] it is extremely difficult . . . doubly ... at long range\"; after lively interchange, at tempting to clarify the implications, all speakers concede that, for morale, it is important to \"speak up and ACT for democracy. . . \" Declaring further that \"what this country needs is a common goal,\" but in reference to Thomas with \"men like you talking,\" ELB insists: \"I believe that ideas are weapons in a democracy; that public opinion is the sum of individual opinions; that you are helping to make individual opinions; that the public makes national morale, national unity, and national wealth; and that everyone can help share public opinion and public action. I remember that twenty years ago there wasn't anything like public relations. Today we know that leadership is largely the result of effective planning of techniques and methods, and we can all be leaders in a democratic way. Totalitarian systems and enemies within our country are waging a propaganda war to break down democracy.\" In reference to ELB's question, \"What do you think of the idea of getting experts in the field of morale psychologists, neurologists, communica tion experts, men like Thomas who know and love their country to work on a commission to give counsel and advice where it is needed on problems of morale having to do with everything from frus tration and prejudice and social behavior to the problems that the army or ... navy ... or the draft meets with men\" Lasswell finally says, \"I think we need lots of service agencies for national defense to help people to understand just how they can serve democracy in this crisis. To that extent I agree with the general conception of a morale com mission. Then I think that represents our consensus today on our question: Is morale our first line of de fense? We have said: 'Yes, without it we cannot suc ceed.' We have also said: 'No, morale is not our first line of defense because it is a result and not the cause of a successful defense effort.' One thing has emerged clearly. We agree that we must have clarity about the ends and means of the achievement of a democratic society.\" Under \"Suggested Readings\" for Round Table listeners, six works are listed, including \"Bernays, Edward L., Speak Up for Democracy. . . .

After pointing out the extent to which planning was being used in other fields, ELB urges comparable efforts in the public relations field. Quoting from three different sources, the Atlantic City conference of business, labor and farm groups, the Baruch-Hancock report on reconversion, and an address by Henry Wallace, a synthesis of goals for public relations planning is reached. After pointing out the necessity of studying social facts and realities, and therefore the need for studying them, recent polls are discussed which back up the delineation of public relations goals. ELB says: \"Polls show our people want demo cratic justice in its broadest sense. . . . Polls prove that a great deal of ordinary living goes on outside of working and that society must provide for the happy pursuit of this kind of living. . . . Polls show too that if we practice sound public relations in one of the vitally important segments of our life- business, we shall avoid revolution. . . . The ac ceptance of all these realities the pronouncement of American leaders, the social facts, the polls must govern the American businessman. ... In practicing effective public relations . . . you will find that what you are really doing is practicing good leadership. Leaders in a democracy are men or women who win friends and influence people by word and deed. ... As forceful, socially minded, forward-looking leaders, businessmen can practice and publicize socially sound policies and practices not only in business but in other fields as well. . . . American business men interested in preserving democracy and predominantly free enterprise must exert this kind of leadership effectively. . . . Nor can business men permit reactionaries to be their spokesmen and official leaders.\" University of Virginia. \"Freedom of Propaganda: The Constructive Forming of Public Opinion.\" Talk delivered at the Institute of Public Affairs, July 16, 1936. Reprinted in \"Vital Speeches of the Day.\" Vol. II, No. 24, Sept 1, 1936, pp. 744- 746. ELB said: \"Americans must recognize that in the science of propaganda they have at their command a real weapon with which to consolidate and make effective the work and contributions of past and present generations that have built up our present- day system an economic and governmental sys tem which we do not desire to change for any other.\" Discussing the role of propaganda, ELB said: \"Propaganda is the voice of the people in the de mocracy of today. Freedom of propaganda is as im portant as the other civil liberties freedom of"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"48 worship, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of radio, and freedom of assembly. . . . Propaganda is an important tool of sound social evolution and change. Propaganda makes it possible for minority ideas to become effective more quickly. . . . What is this propaganda that takes ideas and facts, and gains quicker acceptance for them that modifies the motives, the thoughts, and the actions of millions? Propaganda is applied psychology. Propa ganda is an attempt to give currency to an idea by finding the common denominator between the idea and the public interest, and stating it. It is bringing an old or a new idea to acceptance by the public. . . . The methods of propaganda are readily avail able to all forces in society that wish to effect change or to maintain the status quo. . . . From the broad social standpoint, propaganda can be used in in dustry for a variety of purposes. It can be utilized to hasten or slow up the normal time lag in the public acceptance of a product. . . . Propagandas for the consumer's favor carry broad consequences in their wake, and serve a useful purpose in the economic system. They serve to stabilize life for the producing as well as the consuming elements. They tend to eliminate the shocks and sudden changes which it is clear our system cannot stand. . . . Propaganda makes public interest the deciding factor, for the more propagandas there are vying for public interest and public attention, the freer is the public to choose on the basis of its real wants. \"What, you may ask, can be the rationalization of these propagandas? namely this that as interest and attention are focused on these battles, disin terested authority will align itself on the basis of merit with one side or another, and the presumption is that that side will win in public favor which is in the public interest and at the same time satisfies the private-profit motive that is at the basis of our present system. . . . Individuals, industries, and organizations have not heretofore regarded them selves as part of a larger whole that must present a unified front to the public. The capitalistic system has entirely neglected the larger implications of sell ing itself against competitive systems to the public. ... If we are to safeguard the principles of de mocracy on which our country was founded, if we are to safeguard democracy itself, we must first un derstand and then utilize effectively the science of propaganda in its behalf. . . . The task of the propagandist is, in essence, the effective manage ment of the symbols at his command to bring about desired responses from the public in order to achieve the desired end. . . \" Western Reserve University. \"Democratic Leader ship in Total War\" Address at Cleveland Col lege, Western Reserve University. 1943. 8pp. In this address \"presented at Cleveland College of Western Reserve University, under the auspices of the Journalism Department,\" ELB said: \"The re liance of democracy on its leaders is one of the great safeguards in psychological warfare within and outside the country. We must recognize that the relationship between the leader and his followers is basic to victory, and that our many leaders must assume the responsibility of guiding their followers not only in peacetime pursuits, as they already do, but for victory as well.\" The Foreword states in part: \"Edward L. Bernays, who has long enjoyed the reputation of being the nation's number one publicist, speaks, in this timely address, with the authority of one who has made 'people' his life work. The demonstration contained in this paper should give comfort to those who be lieve that there is no mass mind, but there are mo bile groups of educatable people who think in dividually and often act as a unit. His thesis makes stimulating reading.\" ELB said, \"The first step in forging psychological unity in the United States is to discover how many potential war leaders there are in America who can strengthen uncompromising determination for demo cratic victory. According to the latest available fig ures, there are 788,257 such leaders. . . . Leaders, for their part, have access to the minds and wills of their followers. They must assume their responsibil ities and mobilize the psychological front for victory in this war of ideas. . . . We must not expect words alone, no matter how true or pointed, to build up our national will to victory. . . . Government is ex pressed by acts and words. But the Government in our democracy depends upon the people, on what they want, on what they are willing to accept. The people depend to a great extent on thousands of lead ers for guidance as to their attitudes and actions. We always get back to the leaders no matter where we start.\" The address continues with an identification of the 25 most influential leaders of the day, and of the leaders included in the figure quoted above of 788,257 leaders, and concludes with an appeal for more effective harnessing of this leadership to the purposes of total war.

Maintains an office in New York.\" Arguing the affirmative of the question, \"Is Propa ganda a Constructive Force in American Life To day?\", ELB says: \"The instruments by which public opinion are organized and focused may be misused just as other instruments in law and medicine are being misused; but such organization and focusing are necessary to orderly life. As civilization and the technique of spreading ideas have become more com plex, the technician has arisen whose function it is to help in presenting a point of view and a product."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"49 \"Today, every idea and every product is compet ing with every other idea and every product for favorable public opinion. \"... The practice of propaganda since the war has assumed very different forms from those preva lent twenty years ago. This new technique may fairly be called the new propaganda. The new propa gandist utilizes mass psychology and the technical means of approach to the masses in order to give his idea or object a greater value in the eyes of the public. \"The problems of business offer great opportunity for the propagandist, for everyone is competing against everyone else for the consumer's dollar. . . . Those businessmen . . . who have propagandized successfully for basically sound products, have not only added to the economic stability of their com munities, but by doing so, also have contributed, indirectly, but nonetheless surely, to the happiness of people generally. . . . During the last twenty years there has hardly been a single new idea, new invention, or new product accepted by the public which was not made available for the public's benefit through the use of propaganda in one form or an other. Schools, colleges, churches, the theatre, litera ture, art, music, charities and other forms of social service all have used propaganda effectively. . . . 'The cure for propaganda is more propaganda.' It enables minorities to break up dominant groups. It is the advance agent of new ideas and new products. Since it is available to all, it is an insurance against autocracy in government and against standardiza tion and stagnation. \"It seems to me that the future historian will ascribe to propaganda a very large share or respon sibility for America's progress . . .\" pp. 93-100."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Tart Two WRITINGS ABOUT EDWARD L.

Flynn says in part: \"By no system of honest elim ination can Edward L. Bernays be excluded from a list of representative men in America. He has made an extraordinary success. He has been something of a pioneer. ... He numbers among his clients power ful millionaires, great corporations, even royal per sonages and governments. He has made a great deal of money a mark of importance that no American will deny and, what is more, he has done it in the field of intellectual activity. For, after all, Bernays is a philosopher, not a mere businessman. He is a nephew of that other great philosopher, Dr. Sigmund Freud. Unlike his distinguished uncle, he is not known as a practicing psychoanalyst, but he is a psychoanalyst just the same, for he deals with the science of unconscious mental processes. . . . Ber nays has both a clear and a very shrewd understand ing of his profession. . . . Bernays himself is quite the newest type of public relations specialist, so in telligent and so free from the conventional inhibi tions that he assumes almost the character of a phenomenon.\" The extract describes Bernays' key role in dramatizing Light's Golden Jubilee and the introduction on the market of a new Dodge car, pp. 517-20. Another section of this book, \"The Struggle Between Press and Radio,\" says: \"It took the spectacular broadcast of the Dodge Motor Car company on January 4, 1928, an announcement of its new Victory Six, to awaken publishers to the fact that a rival for the advertising dollar had sprung into being.

Boston: Bellman Publishing Company, 1948. 23pp. In this book, the author, an Associate Professor of History at Princeton University, studies the rise and development of public relations in the United States from 1827 to the present. Public relations is seen as having developed through three stages: \"the public be fooled\". of the press agent; \"the public be in formed\" of the earlier publicity man; and \"the public be understood\" of the public relations counsel. The narrative is highlighted by two focal figures in mod ern public relations, Ivy Lee and ELB. ELB is credited with developing the third or \"pub lic be understood\" phase of public relations, and with coining the phrase \"public relations counsel.\" The author tells how ELB gave public relations advice to Thomas Masaryk which resulted in making October 28 the founding date of the Czechoslovak republic. ELB's Crystallizing Public Opinion is described as \"the first book-length writing devoted exclusively to public relations.\" Outlining ELB's career, the author highlights early clients like Caruso, Elsie Ferguson, Ruth Chatterton, the Diaghileff Russian Ballet and Nijinsky, sponsored by the Metropolitan Opera Company. The editor of Harper's Bazaar, recom mending ELB for a post with George Creel's U. S. Committee on Public Information in World War I, is quoted: \"I consider E. L. Bernays one of the shrewdest and most effective publicity men in this country.\" The author also gives a detailed description of ELB's campaign which made Damaged Goods accept able to the public and a box-office success by creating the Sociological Fund, consisting of leading American men and women. In 1923, \"Bernays pushed toward the professionalization of public relations by arrang ing with New York University to offer the first course in the subject ever to appear in the curriculum of an American university. The same year Bernays published his Crystallizing Public Opinion.\" Sum marizing the main principles of this book, the author says: \"Bernays declared the primary function of the 59 public relations man to be the changing of both com pany policy and public attitudes so as to bring about a rapport between the two. . . . The public rela tions counsel as described in Crystallizing Public Opinion marks the third stage in the volution of public relations thought in the United States. . . . The public was to be understood understood as an intricate system of group relationships and by an expert with the technical equipment, the ethics, and the social view associated with the lawyer, doctor, or teacher.\" After 1923, the author says, ELB maintained his position of leadership. \"Some of his services for clients, most notably his work for General Electric and Westinghouse in connection with the Golden Jubilee of the electric light, have become classics in the field. . . . But no activity of Bernays' has been more persistent or more skillful than his public rela tions for the public relations counsel. . . . 'Bernays had more to do with developing acceptance for PR and public relations counsel than any half dozen other persons,' William H. Baldwin, of Baldwin and Mermey, summarized in 1948.\" pp. 12-21.

In theory, everybody buys the best and cheapest commodities offered him on the market. In practice, if everyone went around pricing, and chemically testing before purchasing, the dozens of soaps or fabrics or brands of bread which are for sale, eco nomic life would be hopelessly jammed. To avoid such confusion, society consents to have its choice narrowed to ideas and objects brought to its atten tion through propaganda of all kinds.

Later, he showed his inventiveness by publicizing the products of Procter & Gamble (Ivory Soap) in a national soap sculpture contest, and by organizing the Golden Jubilee of electric light on behalf of General Electric and Westinghouse. Bernays helped to explain and in terpret the newer trends in publicity work, and in his book Crystallizing Public Opinion, published in 1923, he coined the term 'public relations counsel.' \" p. 360.

Bernays, Carl Byoir, Bernard Lichtenberg and T. J. Ross of the famous firm of Ivy Lee and T. J. Ross. These firms advise more than one client . . . and they draw considerable fees. For instance, according to reports filed with the S.E.C. . . . Allied Chemical & Dye paid Bernays $25,185; and the American Tobacco Company paid Lee and Ross $23,096 and Bernays $24,000 ... p. 26. \"Bernays, like the others, knows that it is better to implant an idea in a group leader's mind and let him spread it than to write up an idea and send it to the papers as a re lease, in the old-fashioned way; because what an independent big-wig says is news. He has developed the technique further than anybody else. Here, for example, is a recent example of his shrewd use of group leaders. In 1934, Philco, a client of Bernays' at the time, was developing for its radios what it called 'high fidelity reception.' No public announce ment was made. Instead, Bernays had letters sent to a list of well-known music critics asking what they thought of radio reception. Then he per suaded Pitts Sanborn to edit and issue under his own name a 'symposium' of opinions on radio reception wherein the answers to Bernays' letters appeared, making the point that reception was generally bad. Names make news; the 'symposium' got a great deal of reception in the press. When it had been well publicized Philco was ready to announce 'high fidel ity reception,' and to hold an exhibit celebrating it as the answer to the currently poor reception. At the same time, still under Bernays' supervision, Philco set up an organization called the Radio Insti tute of the Audible Arts, which Pitts Sanborn was persuaded to head. The Institute began to issue booklets and surveys on good reception, children's programs, etc; these were sent to schools, clubs and the like, where they were well received because each one was written by an authority. Philco's name ap peared only briefly as the founder of the Institute. Thus Philco and 'quality radio' associated them selves firmly in the public mind.\" p. 26-27. Walker, Stanley. City Editor. N.

He is more of a psychologist, or psychoanalyst, than Lee. That Daniel Boone of the canebrakes of the libido, Dr. Sigmund Freud, is his uncle. Bernays has taken the sideshow barker and given him a philosophy and a new and awesome language: 'con ditioned reflexes,' 'the creation of events and circum stances,\" 'dramatic high-spotting,' and 'continuous interpretations.' He is no primitive drum beater. He has written books and lectured at New York University on the methods and underlying psycho logical principles of his high art. He is devoid of swank and does not visit newspaper offices, ...\" p. 143. \"The record of Mr. Bernays is full of exam ples of showmanship which could not be ignored by the newspapers. There was, for example, Light's Golden Jubilee. The story of Edison's invention was retold. To Dearborn went Edison, Henry Ford and even the President of the United States, as well as a great crowd of other important figures. It was not Mr. Ford's show, or Edison's, or even the President's. It was simply a publicity stunt pulled off by Ber nays, representing powerful and rich interests, to exploit the uses of electric light. Newspaper editors who understood this may have felt sad, but what could they do about it with the President making a speech and all those important persons there?\", p. 144. \"Again, Mr. Bernays was employed by Procter and Gamble, makers of Ivory Soap. He popularized the nation-wide contests for the best examples of soap sculpture. It is really startling what anyone with a bent for sculpture can do with a little soap.

Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government that is the true ruling power of our country.' In view of Mr. Bernays' reputation as the founder of the science of modern public relations, the reader may be forced to assume that such 'conscious and intelligent manipulation* of the mass mind is the chief mission of the prac titioner. However, Mr. Bernays later offers in his book a much more agreeable concept when he states: 'The counsel on public relations, after he has exam ined all these and other factors, endeavors to shape the actions of his client so that they will gain the interest, the approval and the acceptance of the public 1 ,\" p. 30. \"Edward L. Bernays divides the history of pub licity into four major periods. The first, 1900 to 1914, was the period of muckraking versus whitewash ing. . . . The second major period was during the First World War, 1914 to 1918, when publicity was used for the first time on a mass scale to sell war aims and ideals. The third major period, 1919 to 1929, was marked by an era of rising price levels, new competition for the consumer's dollar, and a new appreciation of the consumer's interests. . . . Corporations appointed vice-presidents whose prime duties were to make friends for the company and to interest themselves in public affairs. The fourth period began in 1929. The stock-market crash, the advent of the New Deal, the awakening realiza tion that the interests of the whole nation were greater than those of any group, all served to em phasize, according to Mr. Bernays, the need for social consciousness and public responsibility. To continue Mr. Bernays' analysis, written in 1941, it might be said that the fifth period was marked by a return to the First World War methods of selling the public on war issues, but on a much larger pat tern . . .\" pp. 38, 39. \"A vigorous criticism of public opinion polls was registered recently by Ed ward L. Bernays, public relations counsel. In an article in Public Opinion Quarterly, Mr. Bernays said: 'Like vitamins and so many other good things, attitude polls have been adopted by America with its customary unthinking enthusiasm for new things. Polls are an enormously useful implement when honestly, efficiently and intelligently gathered and understood. On the other hand, they are potentially dangerous weapons in the hands of the unwise, the inept, the dishonest or the antisocial.' Mr. Bernays proposed as a solution that licenses should be re quired for the practice of polling, and, secondly, that educational activities, aimed at the public and their leaders, should be carried on to acquaint them with the significance of polls,\" p. 70. \"It is probable that for some time public relations counsel and workers in the field must set their own standards of conduct. However, in fairness to his calling counsel should not accept a client whose standards do not measure up to his own, in the opinion of Edward L. Bernays, who writes: 'In law the judges and jury hold the de ciding balance of power. In public opinion the public relations counsel is judge and jury because through his pleading of a case the public is likely to accede to his opinion and judgment. Therefore, the public relations counsel must maintain an intense scrutiny of his actions, avoiding the propagation of unsocial or otherwise harmful movements or ideas. It is in the creating of public conscience that the counsel on public relations is destined to fulfill his highest usefulness to the society in which he lives.' \" p. 221. Wright, Milton.

Pringle, the author, begins, \"It is significant that Edward L. Bernays, who has reduced the once jovial occupation of press agent to a science, who is f rater infacultate at New York University, and now labors 'in the spirit of the laboratory,' is a nephew of the renowned Dr. Sig- mund Freud. . . . Eddie knows a very great deal about psychology and cashes in on that knowledge. . . . Only poets delude themselves with the notion that love, that is to say sex, causes the world to re volve. Mr. Bernays, whose rank as public relations counsel is at least the equal of Ivy Ledbetter Lee's, knows that it is really money that furnishes the mo tive power. The mass psychologist, moreover, goes much further than the psychoanalyst who . . . can do no more than explain what has already taken place. Eddie can foretell the future . . . [with] no claims to crystal gazing. . . . His science, once understood, is really very simple. What he does is to create a demand by molding the public mind. He creates a desire for specified goods or ideas. The first task of the public relations counsel, however, is to see whether his client offers something which the public 'can be brought to accept.' It is sometimes wiser to refuse a fee. . . . [but] It is not often that mass psychology fails to find a solution. . . .\" Quoting ELB's work, Propaganda, and using many illustrations of his activities as described in that book and other writings \"...

He has made a great deal of money a mark of importance that no American will deny and what is more, he has done it in the field of intellectual activity. . . .

One of these was Light's Golden Jubilee. Surely you will not have to be reminded of that amazing jam boree which took place when the story of Edison's invention of the incandescent lamp was reenacted in Dearborn, with Edison himself, Henry Ford, and the President of the United States playing the leading roles, while droves of great industrialists and finan ciers played the parts of villagers and supers in the cast, and radios and newspapers fought for the privi lege of broadcasting it. Henry Ford was supposed to be the manager of the show, but the man who set the stage and pulled the strings attached to all the digni fied marionettes was Edward L. Bernays. . . . His other outstanding performance was when he spent nearly $70,000 for a single hour's show on the radio to introduce a new Dodge car to the market.\" \"Bernays himself is quite the newest type of public relations specialist, so intelligent and so free from the conventional inhibitions that he assumes almost the character of a phenomenon.\" Design and Paper. \"Edward L.

Mr. Thomajan states, \"Bernays selects his clients and causes with a discriminating eye, and habitually turns down more jobs than he accepts.

Speaking on \"Business Turns to Counsel on Public Relations\" ELB said: \"Business exists to function for the public. The public realizes this and judges businesses and their products by this criterion. The public policy of a business can increase or decrease sales as well as make or mar the reputation of a business. That is a fact that American industry is only now commencing to realize. . . . No longer can any business stand alone. The problems of any one business cannot today be isolated from the broad problems of industry. Because of this, business is finding it essential to re-define its function and to revalue itself in relationship to the other factors of the civilization in which it is operating. . . . The businessman needs an expert in public relations to appraise his public, understand it and recommend ways of conforming to public desire and need, as well as ways to interpret his business\" acts and policies to the public. . . . The public relations counsel has made an intensive study of the public. ... He has come to the conclusion that in every case private interest and public interest must coincide if business is to maintain its important position in our economic and social life. ... It became evident to business and industry that the public was taking an interest in the conduct of business. From that time forward the good will of the public was a definite goal which 81 must be attained. . . . Many industries have recog nized this new factor, but not all of them. It is ob vious that, in this period of flux and competition, the ones who fail to recognize it will not be able to survive. . . . Public relations activities . . . must of necessity play their part in this situation. And the American business man must consider that not only as an individual must he play his part, but that he must also take an interest in seeing that American business as a whole establishes sound relations with the public, in order to re-establish itself in the public mind as a basic part of the American system.\" 4. .. \"The Future of Private Enterprise in the Post-War World.\" Address before Fourteenth Conference, 1942. An analysis of the economic, social and psychological problems which are likely to face post-war free en terprise. ELB says: \"The kind of peace that will be made, the psychology of all nations, the political, economic, and sociological forces that will arise these all will be the background for the type of private enter prise that we shall have, if we have it. ... We shall have to go from war to peace in terms of a planned approach to a continuing problem if chaos is not to result. . . . Here in the U. S. we have had a system predominantly of free enterprise. . . . But economic liberty, psychological and economic security for everyone, have not kept pace with political freedom. . . . The problems of postwar free enterprise will be, first, economic . . . secondly, the psychological, human, social problems, which comprise attitudes of people in and out of government towards this new world of theirs. . . . The industrial and commercial world must undertake important research, and un dertake to build plans that will make a free enterprise world thoroughly and fairly workable. But private industry must assume leadership if it really wants private enterprise and democracy to survive into the postwar world. . . .\" Indicating the main lines of study, ELB suggested study of: termination of war time controls; financial problems; labor problems; industrial problems; agriculture problems; trade and commerce; and social problems. \"Business cannot depend upon the public for its survival. It can depend only upon itself and its own actions. Commerce and industry must recognize that what serves the public interest serves its own interest as well. If it will act on the recognition that private function activities must be predicated on public interest and responsi bility, there will be less to fear.\" 5.

Taking the public relations counsel as his theme, ELB says that \"public relations is concerned bas ically with developing understanding. The public relations counsel must understand the public, its ideas, its philosophies, its points of view, its activities and what it means by the words it uses. All this he must communicate to his client. The client, likewise, must be studied. Its actions, attitudes and principles must be analyzed and be made understandable to the public.\" The public relations counsel, ELB continues, works on the premise that any group in society must integrate with other groups at the highest possible level for the common good. This means the public relations counsel has a strong sense of social re sponsibility and must have the knowledge, ability and judgment to determine what, in our society, is likely to be the common good. Anything the public relations man undertakes must not run counter to the democratic goals of freedom, equality and orderly justice. These goals are clearly denned in labor rela tions, race relations, housing, health, education, individual opportunity. Describing the techniques of the public relations counsel, ELB says he analyzes the public in its rela tionship to his client, surveys all contacts between the two. He also analyzes his client, studies the latter's objectives to find out whether they represent an attainable reality. He studies all phases of his client's activities so that he may compare them with the public's attitudes and the public needs. The public relations counsel must then interpret his findings to the client so the client may understand his own and the public's attitudes. On the basis of this interpretation, counsel makes recommendations to the client and sets forth new ideas and procedures to meet the public's point of view in such a way that the highest public good is achieved. Acts are more important than words in any effort at persuasion. An institution or corporation must act correctly in order to produce a good effect. In conclusion, ELB says that though there are still large areas of ignorance about public relations, knowledge of the importance of this field is growing. Those who depend upon the public are learning to profit from the professional use of public relations. 6. .. \"Learning and World Peace.\" Eighth Symposium of Conference on Science, Philoso phy and Religion. N. Y: Harper & Brothers, 1948. 694pp. Chapter XXXVIII, \"Mass Education, Idea Com munications and the Problems of National Sanity and International Cooperation,\" is by ELB. pp. 411-417. In this chapter, ELB discusses the following: \"What trends in mass education and idea com munications are making for national sanity and international cooperation? What elements are work ing in the opposite direction? How can the former be stimulated and the latter be retarded?\" He divides the problem of world communication into three parts: 1. The matter of providing abundant, cheap, rapid communications for messages; physical instruments have already provided, or may soon provide, these means. 2. The matter of eliminating barriers to communications political, economic and language barriers; this is being given serious consideration by numerous bodies. 3. The problem of improving the quality of ideas, of words and pictures, of the symbols that pass over these media to bring about the objectives all good and honest men desire; this last problem certainly is the longest, hardest and most complex. The answer to the last problem, ELB goes on to say, depends on three forces: the professions and businesses involved, the law, and public opinion. He then urges that education and training in com munications be further stimulated in the universities and schools of journalism, and by the award of prizes and fellowships. He also urges that research in communications be stimulated. Those who are in the communications field professionally, he says, should have to meet higher standards. \"Every man or woman who holds a position conveying symbols to the public should be prepared to meet that re sponsibility by having a thorough grounding in economics, human relations, and the social sciences, as well as a knowledge of the techniques of communi cation.\" ELB also urges continued education after people enter the communications field and criticism to stimulate progress. 7.

Bernays Foundation which sponsored the lectures, was established in 1946. Its purpose is \"to stimulate, promote, encourage and advance scientific, educational, literary and/or charitable causes including, without limitation, the study of the science of public relations counseling to further human relations, intercultural and intergroup relations and to advance a sound public interest"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"83 therein.\" Another purpose of the Foundation is \"to study and conduct research into all phases of and conditions affecting human, cultural and group rela tions, and the changes and improvements in the conditions of life and work among people.\" \"The larger foundations in this country,\" ELB says, \"sponsor extensive research in education, health and other fields, and in that way bring about improved public relationships and better human relations. But a foundation whose funds are limited finds it difficult to decide in what field it can help effectively.\" In seeking to sponsor for the year 1950 some activity in a field where the misunderstandings are of major economic and human significance, the Edward L. Bernays Foundation decided upon the field of management relationships. It was felt that one way of bringing the best thought in this field to a point of high visibility would be to underwrite a series of lectures on the social responsibility of management to be delivered at one of America's leading universities situated in a key industrial center. \"What the Foundation had in mind,\" ELB con tinues, \"was a series of lectures whose purpose would be not to present one viewpoint or intensify present attitudes but rather to create a forum for calling to public attention, and particularly to the attention of the business community, various view points which must be taken into consideration for a realistic understanding and appraisal of the social responsibility of management.\" For this purpose the Foundation lectures presented the diverse viewpoints of a social engineer, Stuart Chase; a trade union leader, Stanley H. Ruttenberg, Director of the CIO's Department of Education and Research; a management executive, William B. Given, Jr., Chairman of the Board, American Brake Shoe Company; and an economist, Edwin G.

And unless everyone of us does, there may be no private interest left to worry about. \"Our national strength is founded on a unified, powerful morale. \"This morale is built by our common belief in our national goals and united action to achieve them. \"The national emergency demands that all of us on all fronts work together for the general good. \"Complete cooperation on the home front is as vital to national survival as it is on the military front. \"For the sake of his own private interest the indi vidual must willingly sacrifice convenience, comfort and profit for the common good, endure hardships and suffering. \"For unless we maintain our continuity as a free, independent nation, we shall have nothing as indi viduals. \"Every American is responsible for our morale. Our national morale is the sum of our individual morales. This means that all of us, men and women, old and young, corporation executives and em ployees, must be willing to serve wherever and whenever we are needed. Any man who acts at the country's expense helps the enemy. If he injures his country's strength, he destroys everything he values for himself. \"Acting at America's expense includes profiteer ing, chiseling, black and grey marketeering, or doing anything which places personal profit above the public interest. \"It also includes slander, hate, rumor-mongering and scapegoating at the expense of public officials or private citizens. \"Our national welfare in this emergency requires that individuals, groups and corporations give the most painstaking attention to their public relation ships. \"They must insure, in their own interest and in the public interest, that every action and utterance raises morale and does not lower or destroy it. \"They must make certain that their policies, words, and acts are dictated not by narrow immedi ate expediency but by the broader interests of self and country. \"If ever there was a time when such public rela tionships were indispensable, that time is now.\" 10.

There should be no other way in a nation that desires . . . to govern itself. What are the methods of legiti mate propaganda? These have been very well pre sented by Edward L.

The Journal of Marketing. \"The Marketing of National Policies: A Study of War Propaganda.\" Vol. 6, No. 3, Jan 1942, pp. 236-244. Editor's note: \"The problem of using all this coun try's resources to disseminate effectively the ideas for which the democracies are contending in the present war is one of the day's most formidable marketing problems. Mr. Bernays discusses the problem with new insight in the following paper, which he read before the New York Chapter (of the American Marketing Society) at one of its fall meetings.\" Speaking before America's entrance into World War II, ELB analyzes propaganda in World War I. He cites various scientific authorities and reduces \"all psychological warfare\" in the first World War to three main elements: 1. heighten the morale unity of your own country; 2. weaken the morale of your enemy; 3. win over the morale of neutrals. He then analyzes in some detail psychological warfare techniques used by Germany, Great Britain and the United States. Since 1917, ELB continues, the situation has changed because technical means for spreading ideas have been improved; because the \"common man\" plays a greater role in shaping political destinies; because the rise of Communists, Nazis and Fascists has accelerated the effectiveness of manipulated symbols; and because knowledge of the human mind has been greatly increased by the social sciences. All these factors, and the experience of World War I, lead to an \"engineering approach\" to psychological warfare which must henceforth be based on \"the engineering of consent in a democracy.\" In order that the United States which has already mobilized the first peacetime selective serv ice army in its history to be prepared \"for what ever may come,\" ELB suggests the following psy chological warfare program: 1. The Government needs to set up a psychological general staff to advise on all major questions of morale in industry, civilian life, army and navy. 2. A program needs to be set in motion to strengthen faith in democracy. 3. This should be accompanied by a program de signed to make democracy work better, \"making its ideals come true.\" \"Experts, including marketing men, have laid a sound basis for a scientific approach to the problem of psychological warfare in the crisis we face today,\" ELB concludes. \"America should not, cannot wait. She must apply today what she already knows toward meeting the problems she faces.\" 14. MacLatchy, Josephine H. \"Education on the Air.\" Thirteenth Yearbook of the Institute for Education by Radio. Columbus: Ohio State University, 1942, 310pp. Speaking in the panel discussion, ELB said that in his opinion the war effort of the radio industry and the Government was inadequate. This conclusion is confirmed by authorities all over the country, many of whom regard radio's war effort as ineffectual, inefficient, duplicating and segmental. These people do not know where to turn, for there is no planned approach to the problem of radio's all-out conversion in total war and no over-all strategy of psychological warfare. Every program commercial, sustaining,"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"85 governmental should fit into a balanced pattern. Attempts are made by networks and individual stations to do this, ELB said, but the main basis of judgment is still the cash register. ELB then urged that the radio broadcasting indus try voluntarily organize for efficient handling of its total war effort. It should name a board of experts in psychology, public opinion, radio programming and communications, to set up blueprints for ac complishing the purpose a balance of entertain ment, escapism, information and criticism, and a line to follow as to content, theme, emotion and reason. The board, ELB said, should be in touch with government officials, informed about the war and the demands of the national interest. Not regimentation, he added, but intelligent planning. This will not mean the elimination of the commercial system of American broadcasting and entertainment. Entertainment is basic to morale. It will mean that radio's effectiveness will be measured, like education, by its whole effect on the mind and character of an individual. Only by such an approach, ELB concluded, can radio's real potentialities in the war effort be realized victory through another and equally potent air power, pp. 33-34. 15. New York State Pharmacist. \"The Bernays Drug and Pharmaceutical Survey,\" Oct 1943, pp. 9-12, 28-30. An editorial note preceding ELB's talk before the Pharmaceutical Association says: \"In the opinion of the writer the paper which we are printing here is one of the most important ones that has been published within a decade. ... Be sure to read this paper from beginning to end; it may not be all pleasant reading, but we might as well know what the survey of an expert firm found. We are printing the paper as it was presented before the American Pharmaceutical Association at its recent meeting in Columbus, Ohio,\" p. 9. In his talk ELB says: \"Pharmacy has a choice. It can submit to pressures of public opinion, when they exert themselves, or it can fulfill its vital role as the custodian of public wel fare, at the same time gaining good will, strengthen ing itself, and moving into its rightful place in our society. A unified public relations effort is the means by which all of you can aid in bringing about this objective. It is difficult to devise for immediate acceptance a uniformly acceptable course of action regarding all the trends and situations you face, but that factor in itself is one of the reasons why I be lieve the immediate problems I presented are a common ground upon which all interested groups can carry on action. The proposed plan for public relations aimed at strengthening relations within the industry, between the industry, the pharmaceutical profession and the government, and between the industry and public is that type of common ground. I hope in your own interest that you will study it further and act on it.\" 16. Public Utilities Fortnightly. \"What Can Utilities Do about Public Relations Today?\" Jun 6, 1940, 128pp. Editorial note on ELB: \"The scientific or 'engineer ing' approach to the problem of public relations, according to this noted specialist in that field, is to dig into it and determine the respective areas of agreement and disagreement. Only then can a sound and sure program for improving public relations be formulated.\" ELB says in this article that the principal trouble seems to have been not that the public utilities neglected its public relations, but that \"it tried too hard to cultivate them on false grounds by mak ing use of spurious methods and generally going about it the wrong way.\" These actions led to agita tion for the Federal Trade Commission probe in 1928. ELB then gives results of poll he took among leaders of industry, finance and the public on what the problems and solutions of public relations are. The replies showed group leaders think in terms of their relationship to government; the public; bankers and stockholders; the community where their cus tomers are; the industry; and their workers. Applying this to public utilities, ELB says since government represents the people, the only modifica tion of government attitudes and activities must be through modifying the people's attitudes through the engineering of consent. Industry leaders agree that government should go out of competitive business and should have no plants of its own; and that more consideration must be given to public attitudes, policies and practices adopted by the industry. Key executives see good employee relations as a solution rather than as a problem. For the public utilities industry ELB suggests a four- point program: 1. that some industrial commit tee should be entrusted with the study of the prob lems and suggesting solutions for finding areas of agreement; 2. that this committee develop a program of broad principles and practices for public utility companies, then get the companies to accept them; 3. that competent technicians be engaged to make a study of the public mind to find out what present public attitudes are toward principles, practices and goals upon which the industry will decide; this sur vey will attempt to find out the extent to which it is possible to modify public attitudes and actions; 4. that the industry undertake a campaign of education to win the support of the public. 17.
