In March 1989 two electro-chemists, Martin Fleisch- mann of the University of Southampton in England and Martin Pons of the University of Utah (Fleischmann’s one- time graduate student), announced an electro-chemical process which appeared to be a low energy nuclear reaction. The reaction supposedly released a form of nuclear energy. They called it cold fusion. Without heat and pressure, by use of simple electroly- sis, they could generate over unity . . . get more power out of the device than needed to run it. This is counter to ortho- dox theory that states that one needs massive pressure and high temperature to achieve so-called hot fusion, to release the power of the atom. The physics establishment had just spent 50 year and maybe $20 billion to achieve this end, and had not achieved over unity. Now they were told it could be done on a kitchen table with a cheap apparatus known to every freshman chemistry major. The immediate overwhelming scientific response was “impossible.” Most scientists were secure in the assump- 3% Loc 30 of 562"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"COLD FUSION - THE SECRET ENERGY REVOLUTION tion that they already knew everything about physics and proclaimed cold fusion a “fraud.” Instead of dispassion- ate examination of the claim, almost without exception prominent scientists shouted down the discovery. Pons and Fleischmann fled to France. Science influence with the media was used to ridicule the discovery...and science re- porters lapped it up, without a second thought. The fact that this reaction was essentially self-serving justification for a bountiful flow of federal funds went largely unnoticed. Thousands of physicists depended on federal funding in the hot fusion and high energy physics programs. Cold fusion threatened the flow of funds. The media reaction was unbelievable... instant dismissal, and unthinking ridicule: - NEW YORK TIMES (April 3 O, 1 9 8 9): “...in one word, it’s garbage .” - NBC TV Reporter Bazell: “I know what is possible and what is not...I think it’s a bunch of junk.” - NATURE Editor John Maddox: “...a milestone in the history of entertainment.” - NATURE Editor David Lindley: “Pigs don’t have wings.\" - TIME: “I don’t think that data is worth anything.” The negative lockstep reaction of the media can be LOC 41 of 562"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"COLD FUSlON - THE SECRET ENERGY REVOLUTION traced to the “prominent scientists” working on govern- ment research funds. News sources, specifically science re- porters, have neither the wisdom nor the fortitude to ques- tion these self-appointed experts. These are some of the comments made by physicists before they had time to re- peat the experiments (i.e., knee-jerk emotional reactions): - Steven Koonin, Cal Tech: “...a mistake... they found something that didn’t exist.” - Robert Park, American Physical Society: “...a se’ance of true believers.” - Herman Fesbach, MIT: “I don't want to see any more evidence. I think it’s a bunch of junk.” The Department of Energy appointed a Cold Fusion Panel from its Energy Research Advisory Board with Professor John Huizenga of University of Rochester as cochairman. In November 1989 the panel issued a report which was anything but impartial. The panel could find no convincing evidence of excess heat and claimed that the process is “contrary to all understanding gained of nuclear reactions in the last half of the 20th century.” The panel recommended against any specific follow-up and recom- mended channeling any work “within the present funding system\" (a good way to kfll off further work). The immediacy and intensity of hostfl'ity suggests cold fusion hit a sensitive nerve. The world view of physics had 7% Loc 58 of 562"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"COLD FUSION - THE SECRET ENERGY REVOLUTION been shaken. If cold fusion was right the theoretical struc- ture of physics was in error—big-time error. Since 1989 high-energy physicists have fallen over themselves to declare cold fusion “impossible,” a “delu- sion,” a “fraud,” “bad science,” and everything disreputable under the sun. They particularly point to the 1989 DOE report and the initial large number of unsuccessful dupli- cations. Notably they always cite the work of 1 989 to 1 99 1 when there were difliculties m' duplication. In particu- lar the platinum-palladium electrodes were trouble some— some grades worked well, others did not. There were prob- lems with surface defects. This negative approach was largely confined to the U.S. and Britain. In Japan in 199 1 about 2 percent of the hot fu- sion budget was devoted to cold fusion. In the U.S. — none. In India, a broadly based cold fusion program was con- tinued under the Indian Atomic board. In Russia, in spite of troubled times, about 15 million rubles were allocated to twenty laboratories in the four years between 1 99 1 and 1995 for cold fusion research. The error made by high energy physics was to attempt suppression. This drove research into the private sector where they lost opportunity to control.

Pons and Fleischmann were driven from the US. to France to a Japanese funded laboratory. Physicist after physicist claimed fraud and the media followed suit, down to the present day. Lack of funding and peer pressure combined to keep many scientists in ignorance, and even today success is not widely known. Around the world inde- pendent researchers took a second look. If they had no fund they cannibalized other projects. A handful of researchers looked beyond the oflicial screen and a few low-circula— tion journals, including FTIR (see last page), emerged and tracked the new work.

Very slowly, the new work paid off but remained un- publicized. The official DOE position remained the same. DOE officially refused to finance any workers who were even interested in cold fusion.

It was found that the surface characteristics of electrodes were signifi- cant-—electrodes had to be pure with no surface defects. Then, gradually, the truth emerged. Major laboratories duplicated the Pons-Fleischmann method; others looked at solid state devices and different electrode materials. Over unity was confirmed. Also, “life after death” (the cells con— tinued working after the power was switched off) and the output-input ratios became extraordinary...one Japanese group reported the level to be 70,000: 1. Cold fusion developed variants, was repeatable, and was capable of generating excess heat which could be con- verted to low-voltage electricity. The fuel was water. Some- times a compound like potassium carbonate was added to the electrolyte to improve conductivity. That’s it. Simplicity itself. After 1 994 came key confirmations one after the other.

But they made mis— takes because they trusted their advisers. We don’t blame government, we blame the self—serving, closed-minded ad- visers. Hopefully, the government will learn a lesson and choose its advisers more carefully. The Office of Naval Re— search has for years been in the vanguard of research.

Several years before, Clarke, in a speech to the Pacific Area Senior Officer Logistics Seminar (March 1 993), had briefed senior allied ofl‘lcers on the potential: “It is beyond serious dispute any more that anomalous amounts of energy are being produced from hydrogen by some unknown reaction...” Later in 1998, Gerald Celente, founder of the well- known Trends Research Institute, published Trends 2000 (Warner Books, New York, 1998). Celente was also un- equivocal— he designated the new energy revolution based on cold fusion as “the single biggest investment opportun- ity of the 21st century...for those in the know a financial windfall.\" Celente parallels the statements we have made in this report without the details, although he is obviously aware of the technical detail.

It was a relatively simple process, but it had scientists bafl‘led.” Celente commented that even while the US. critics were bellowing “fraud,” actual commercial heating units were being produced in Eastern Europe by using a process clearly related to the original discovery (page 306). The Celente conclusion? “ The energy revolution will be the single biggest invest- ment opportunity of the twenty-first century.

One of these variants does not require electrodes at all, simply immersion of palladium metal (perhaps other metals) in deuterium gas, (the Case catalytic process). The most important effect is over-unity (i.e., more power is gen— erated by the unit than is needed to operate it, output/ input ratio of 3:1 are routine today). There are reports of devices generating much more, e.g., several thousand to one. Our sense is that within a decade the higher ratios Will be com- mon. The most important cold fusion effect is over unity in the form of excess heat. The excess heat generated has to be converted to electricity. Work is now concentrated on devices to utilize low energy heat and its conversion. Heat— ing devices are now at the industrial engineering stage. For example,Japanese researcher Mizuno considers excess heat to be the biggest laboratory hurdle yet to be overcome. In his book, Mizuno cites the case of a runaway cell in his 1a- boratory, which he had to dump in a bucket of water for ten days to cool down.

Home heaters and water heaters are now in develop- ment (reportedly already developed in Eastern Europe, al- though we cannot yet confirm this report). This will have an immediate and substantial effect on the heating oil in- dustry. The new standard is therefore over-unity, i.e. over 100% efficiency. Fossfl fuels cannot meet this standard. Their efficiencies are in the 1 5-20% range. The gasoline fuel cells promoted by the Department of Energy and developed by Arthur Little Company are about 65% eflicient. They appear to be aimed at slowing down the shift away from petroleum fuels. DOE could have gone straight to over unity cold fusion (except that it has already committed itself to the “impossible” position). Coal is about 3 2 percent efficient. The new standard is set by cold fusion. The market will accept these technologies and reject those that do not meet this standard. There is no way this can be stopped. What we don’t know is the time frame. The chance of extremely low cost heating, virtually no cost, will be so powerful that it will sweep away any opposi- tion. The burden of heating cost in the North Eastern US. is so great that any opposition is unlikely. 31% Loc l87 of 562"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"COLD FUSTON — THE SECRET ENERGY REVOLUTION This is a non-polluting technology.

We brought this to the attention of the Sierra Club four years ago . . . without any response. The only conclusion we can formulate is that without pollution there is no anti-pollu— tion movement, and pollution free energy will remove one of the pillars that supports the environmental industry.

It is available in German or English from Dr Josef Gruber of University of Hagen in Germany. Today’s economists have an extraordinary weakness. The field of economics assumes technology as a \"given\", as a fixed parameter in a static world . . . about as far from reality as one can get. And like physics, modern economists have tried to convert economics into mathematical sym- bolism based on fixed assumptions. On the other hand one great contribution of modern economics has been the understanding and promotion of market forces for efficient distribution of resources. The mid-century fascination with economic planning (\"planned chaos\") has been abandoned in favor of a recogni- tion of market forces. The Gruber study overcomes the first limitation and ex- plores cold fusion in the structure of an enterprise society. A similar study has been undertaken by Bectel Corporation to estimate movement off the grid system. Because of inadequate response by the Government it is probable that several industries which would be initially affected are not aware bf the coming transformation. Be- cause of this gap in information they have not conducted 35% Loc 2'06 of 562"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"COLD FUSlON - THE SECRET ENERGY REVOLUTlON necessary studies. This is one of the reasons why we state emphatically that Department of Energy incompetence has significant national security impact. This is a Department that doesn‘t understand market economics and neither does it understand the technology of cold fusion. The initial impact, as Bechtel has foreseen, will be on the electricity grid. But in addition to withdrawal from the grid system there will be wrenching change for the heating and cooling industries, These latter will be impacted prob- ably before the grid system because space heating units can be developed before heat to electricity conversion units. Because of weakness in the official academic -govern- ment structure this aspect has been entirely ignored. The \"wild ride\" foreseen by a senior Federal Reserve Bank official (see FTIR January 1999, in bibliography) can be smoothed by withdrawing funds from coal, oil and atomic technical research and devoting funds to cold fu- sion research. Today Government policy is exaggerating the complexity and impact of changeover. Policy is designed to keep us in the 19th and 20th centuries while the market, reflecting citizen ability and demand, is urging us into the let. The efficiency differences are so astounding that Gov- ernment retreat from science funding is an elementary first step.

This is what we call \"planned chaos\", after the late, great Ludwig van Mises who foresaw these absurdities in a different context. Another step is to alert initial impact industries of likely future changes. Not only the electricity grids, heating and cooling industries, but more obscure groups. Even the travel industry will be effected, real estate in isolated areas, the pipeline network and steel pipe mills. Coal mining and coal mining machinery, coal transportation, petroleum ex- ploration and development and many others w11'l .receive some initial impact.

Former Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger's com— ment that Government is concerned about speed of events makes sense. This is the way governments think . . . but even governments are helpless against markets. The Soviet Union discovered this truism. Sensible governments like sensible investors don’t try to fight market trends. Moreover, Weinberger’s comment is reinforced from an unusual source— a radio interview from Gordon Novel (one-time intelligence operative now in a federal jail) by Don Weideman (printed in Freedom Forum, October 1 9 9 6). Novel had links to the CIA and was on a friendly basis with former CIA Director Bill Colby. This interview refers accurately to physicist Hal Puthof‘fs research on zero point energy and states “the gov- ernment knows that energy is free\" and “the motive of the New World Order is to stop technologies that eliminate oil, gas, coal and nuclear energy that make it possible for people Lee 245 of 562"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"COLD FUSTON — THE SECRET ENERGY REVOLUTION to get energy for nothing.\" Novel concluded, “They’re petri— fied at the advent of these technologies, which is right around the corner.” To continue, the potential in new energy technology is so extraordinary that if held back and then released sud- denly it can bring about the very panic that government is reportedly trying to prevent. Release of pressure over time is safer than sudden release. Government has reason to be “petrified.” The magnitude of the change is above anything we have experienced, including World War II. More likely the government is attempting to delay mar- ket awareness to enable its corporate friends to restructure their market position . . . this “policy actions in exchange for political contributions” stance is endemic in the Clinton Administration. Imagine the horror of the pension funds, the mutual funds and other investment vehicles to find that their key investment targets are about to become worthless. They have paid their dues in the form of campaign contributions and they want something back (as we saw in the Larry Law- rence-Arlington National Cemetery affair). The pressure of the status quo vested interest on the White House is enor- mous. In the long run, of course, such political games are use- less—a waste of time and money.

The most sensible procedure for society and the economy as a whole is to allow free markets and free flow of information.

For a moment imagine yourself a board director of Shell or AMOCO and your research director has a report from your own laboratories that concludes the cold fusion pro— cess is valid and has achieved over unity.

We have already seen with the Dennis Lee free energy cross country tour...in— vestors actually handed over funds without sight of the device. In fact, Dennis Lee had no device, just a car load of promises...and a rap sheet for fraud. The rewards are more than monetary. And the losses more than financial. There is the psychological reward that these technologies will solve many of the world's nagging problems. Energy becomes almost a free good like air and water. Non-polluting, non-political, non-mon- opolizing. With these possibilities risk becomes second- ary. The sociological and political spill over is heavy. The world of pork bellies and derivatives become trivial, and a competitive structure ensures that monopoly profit is not available for political objectives as New World Order and political influence. Today there are a dozen genuine ground floor opportunities and more in startup (where we have no track record). Lack of US. government support has forced R&D into the private sector.

The private approach is fairer, much faster, more practical and has more benefits to society, although pioneers lik'e Pons and Fleischmann have carried a heavy personal burden. In the long run this is the beneficial road for society as a whole. Above all this is technology with no monopoly controlled inputs, there is no argument for government regulation. The only input apart from technical know-how is space or water. Even the electrodes cannot be monopolized. To be sure there is scarcity of platinum and palladium but titan- ium, nickel and silver have also been used as well as solid state devices. In brief, the barriers to entry are low, being mainly technical expertise. The technology is now available through licensing to any entrepreneur with technical ability, some capital and market knowledge. The problem today is not reproducibil- ity of the over unity effect but to reproduce the conditions necessary to achieve the effect (i.e., electrode surfaces). This simple point is vital and has been overlooked by science orthodoxy and the media community. This is why tech- nical expertise is vital.

Movement Out of Oil and Gas Sooner or later w11'l come the rush to the exit for ut11'ities. Some are already creeping stealthily in that direction. Without access to boardroom discussions it is almost impossible to determine WHY a company has sold 011' and gas assets... Trading assets and properties is common in 011' and gas. Further, in some countries there can be regulatory pressure to sell assets. But here are three interesting cases: Zapata Corporation Zapata Offshore Co. was founded in 1954 by former President George Bush, and partners to develop oil and gas properties. By the 1980s, Zapata developed into a sizable company. Also during this time, George Bush became first director of the CIA, then vice president, and finally presi- dent of the United States. We know that CIA collects data on new energy technologies. By the early 1 990s Zapata had sold ALL its oil and gas properties and the Bush family sold Zapata to Malcolm Glazer who has taken the company into the fish protein business.

Calculated dis-investment or lucky chance? Update at July 1, 1998 In the last few months new discoveries and advances have been made. The most significant is the emergence of work by chemical engineer Dr. Leslie Case. In May, Case, for— merly unknown, announced that he had been working for six years on catalytic cold fusion and was awaiting grant of the patent. The Case catalytic cell is a tested, reliable gener- ator of excess heat, simple and cheap. The process is deceptively simple: heat palladium, acti- vate carbon in deuterium (heavy hydrogen) gas. No elec- trolysis. Generates reliable excess heat at temperatures higher than P-F cold fusion (> 1 50°C, up to 250°C).

All the equipment is available off the shelf and ideal for university laboratory work. The catalyst is commer- cially available and deuterium gas is cheap and plentiful. (International Patent No. WO 97743768, published Nov. 20,1997). The Case catalytic cell appears to be far and away the most useful cold fusion device yet...and Case has made full disclosure of the technology. This is what the cold fusion phenomenon needed—the input of an experienced chemical engineer to convert the laboratory phenomenon of “cold fusion” into an industrial engineered product. Cold fusion has now bridged this gap by using catalytic reaction instead of electrical. For details, read the patent (cited above) and Infinite Energy (Vol. 4, Nov. 19,1998). Combined with the enthusiasm and technical skills of Eugene Mallove, the Case catalytic fusion device is the dem- onstration device that could break the irrational barrier of “ofl‘lcial science.” For more information, contact Cold Fu- sion Technology, Inc., PO.

What is the demand for an almost free good, a global necessity in an almost free market? While supply cannot be monopolized there are virtually no resource costs, only device engineering and production costs and no economies of scale. For a product with these properties the word \"risk\" 'takes on a different meaning. Sooner or later a potential entre- preneur with substantial capital and drive wfl'l visualize the opportunities and put together a package of capital and skills to bring the possibility to reality. Sooner or later this will happen, it is only a question of \"when\". When this event penetrates the financial world the pi- oneers will have trouble turning away the flood of capital offered. One problem will be the usual scams, and we've al- ready had examples of this phenomenon. Rewards are more than monetary. As Methernitha has insisted there are sociological and spiritual aspects. And the losses are more than financial. These technologies will solve many of the world’s intractable problems, without Big Government intervention.

It is difficult to comment on this approach. We are all young in understanding this new technology which is more than just cold fusion and over unity. Yet in spite of this awe inspiring importance the basic research is still restricted to the backwoods of New Hamp- shire and a damp cold underground laboratory in Hokkaido Japan, not in the lavish taxpayer funded laboratories in California and Boston. A planet with such screwed up pri- orities needs to take a good look at itself. The world of pork bellies and derivative becomes trivial. The competitive nature of the cold fusion structure ensures that monopoly profit is not available for political objectives and influence peddling. In fact much of the vast govern- mental apparatus can be dissolved as unnecessary. With— out the need for 011' there is no Middle East vital interest. Without pollution, the pollution industry, and its powerful lobby disappears. US Government opposition, stemming from the 1 989 Bush-Seaborg meeting forced cold fusion R&D essentially into the private sector although some individual govern- ment scientists continue to do excellent individual work and of course came under harassment for their dedication.

Consequently we are skeptical about the need for government involvement be— yond funding basic research (as suggested by David Nagel of U.S. Navy) and provision of seed money. Bring in Gov- ernment and cold fusion development becomes a political football, distorts the resource allocation mechanism and enables the same tired old revolving door operators to use Government access for influence and control. To replace an entrepreneur using his own capital with a technocrat using taxpayer funds is the height of folly. We should have learned that lesson by this time. The private sector approach is fairer, faster, practical and beneficial to society. To be sure the pioneers carry a heavy personal burden, but this they know and recognize. This is not monopoly technology. There is no argument for Government intervention. The technology is available by licensing to any entrepreneur with access to technical ability, capital and market knowledge. A start-up entrepre- neur doesn't need friends in high places or even lobbying assets. There is nothing the politicians need to do for this technology, except vote some seed money and keep out of the way. The technical problem today is not duplication of a cold fusion process but the more limited challenges of scale up, process control, electrode surfaces and creating the con- ditions for reproducibility.

Unfortunately, these authors forget that one can never prove the negative case in science. What these books prove is that science has lost its way and apparently most scien- tists (in 1 9 98) prefer their theoretical assumptions over ob- servable fact. Their genius lies in funding, not science. This oflicial group has conned the politicians into funding only their science...and the innocent taxpayer ends up paying their bills.
