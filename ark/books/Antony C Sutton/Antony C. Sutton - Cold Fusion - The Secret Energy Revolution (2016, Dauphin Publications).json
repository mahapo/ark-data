The reaction supposedly released aform of nuclear energy. They called it cold fusion.Without heat and pressure, by use of simple electrolysis, they could generateover unity . . . get more power out of the device than needed to run it. This iscounter to orthodox theory that states that one needs massive pressure and hightemperature to achieve so-called hot fusion, to release the power of the atom.The physics establishment had just spent 50 years and maybe $20 billion toachieve this end, and had not achieved over unity. Now they were told it couldbe done on a kitchen table with a cheap apparatus known to every freshmanchemistry major.The immediate overwhelming scientific response was “ impossible.\" Mostscientists were secure in the assumption that they already knew everything aboutphysics and proclaimed cold fusion a “ fraud.\" Instead of dispassionateexamination of the claim, almost without exception prominent scientists shouteddown the discovery. Pons and Fleischmann fled to France. Science influence withthe media was used to ridicule the discovery . . .and science reporters lappedit up, without a second thought.The fact that this reaction was essentially self-serving justification for abountiful flow of federal funds went largely unnoticed. Thousands of physicistsdepended on federal funding in the hot fusion and high energy physics programs.Cold fusion threatened the flow of funds. The media reaction was unbelievable .. .instant dismissal, and unthinking ridicule:• NEW YORK TIMES (April 30, 1989): “ . . .in one word, it ’ s garbage. ”• NBC TV Reporter Bazell: “ I know what is possible and what is not . . .I thinkit ’ s a bunch of junk. ”• NATURE Editor John Maddox: “ . . .a milestone in the history of entertainment.”• NATURE Editor David Lindley: “ Pigs don ’ t have wings. ”• TIME : “ I don ’ t think that data is worth anything. ”The negative lockstep reaction of the media can be traced to the “ prominentscientists ” working on government research funds. News sources, specificallyscience reporters, have neither the wisdom nor the fortitude to question theseself-appointed experts. These are some of the comments made by physicists beforethey had time to repeat the experiments (i.e., knee-jerk emotional reactions):• Steven Koonin, Cal Tech: “ . . .a mistake... they found something that didn ’t exist. ”• Robert Park, American Physical Society: “ . . .a s é ance of true believers. ”• Herman Fesbach, MIT: “ I don't want to see any more evidence. I think it ’ sa bunch of junk. ”The Department of Energy appointed a Cold Fusion Panel from its Energy ResearchAdvisory Board with Professor John Huizenga of University of Rochester asco-chairman. In November 1989 the panel issued a report which was anything butimpartial. The panel could find no convincing evidence of excess heat andclaimed that the process is “ contrary to all understanding gained of nuclearreactions in the last half of the 20th century. ” The panel recommended againstany specific follow-up and recommended channeling any work “ within the presentfunding system ” (a good way to kill off further work).The immediacy and intensity of hostility suggests cold fusion hit a sensitivenerve. The world view of physics had been shaken. If cold fusion was right, thetheoretical structure of physics was in error — big-time error.Since 1989 high-energy physicists have fallen over themselves to declare coldfusion “ impossible, ” a “ delusion, ” a “ fraud, ” “ bad science, ” andeverything disreputable under the sun. They particularly point to the 1989 DOEreport and the initial large number of unsuccessful duplications. Notably theyalways cite the work of 1989 to 1991 when there were difficulties induplication. In particular the platinum-palladium electrodes were troublesome —some grades worked well, others did not. There were problems with surfacedefects.This negative approach was largely confined to the U.S. and Britain. In Japan in1991 about 2 percent of the hot fusion budget was devoted to cold fusion. In theU.S. — none. In India, a broadly based cold fusion program was continued underthe Indian Atomic board. In Russia, in spite of troubled times, about 15 millionrubles were allocated to twenty laboratories in the four years between 1991 and1995 for cold fusion research.The error made by high energy physics was to attempt suppression. This droveresearch into the private sector where they lost opportunity to control. If theyhad financed the work through government funding they could have attemptedclassification and suppression through the government DOE apparatus and so buryfor all time . . . at least inside the U.S. Their haste to protect 100 percentof hot fusion funding forced development into the private sector."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2Revival of Cold FusionThe assault was nearly successful. Cold fusion was almost killed off. Pons andFleischmann were driven from the U.S. to France to a Japanese funded laboratory.Physicist after physicist claimed fraud and the media followed suit, down to thepresent day. Lack of funding and peer pressure combined to keep many scientistsin ignorance, and even today success is not widely known. Around the worldindependent researchers took a second look. If they had no fund, theycannibalized other projects. A handful of researchers looked beyond theofficial screen and a few low-circulation journals, including FTIR (see lastpage), emerged and tracked the new work.Even within the U.S. government, questions remained and small-scale workcontinued at the U.S. Navy in China Lake, California, NASA, Cleveland, LosAlamos National Laboratory, and elsewhere.Very slowly, the new work paid off but remained unpublicized. The official DOEposition remained the same. DOE officially refused to finance any workers whowere even interested in cold fusion. The Patent Office will not grant patents oncold fusion but recently has granted patents where “ over unity effect ” is inthe description.The first studies were unsuccessful but gradually came enough positive resultsto keep the work alive. It was found that the surface characteristics ofelectrodes were significant — electrodes had to be pure with no surface defects.Then, gradually, the truth emerged. Major laboratories duplicated thePons-Fleischmann method; others looked at solid state devices and differentelectrode materials. Over unity was confirmed. Also, ‘‘ life after death ” (thecells continued working after the power was switched off) and the output-inputratios became extraordinary . . .one Japanese group reported the level to be70,000:1.Cold fusion developed variants, was repeatable, and was capable of generatingexcess heat which could be converted to low-voltage electricity. The fuel waswater. Sometimes a compound like potassium carbonate was added to theelectrolyte to improve conductivity. That ’ s it. Simplicity itself.After 1994 came key confirmations one after the other. The most significant ofthese announcements was by a U.S. Navy official in 1995 . . .significant becausethe U.S. Navy has an excellent reputation for vanguard research.David Nagel, Superintendent of the Condensed Matter and Radiation ScienceLaboratory at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., presenteda lecture at the long established Philosophical Society in Washington, D.C.Said Nagel on October 20th 1995:“ Cold fusion is now ignored, disdained and even mocked by scientists and thepublic. This is due to a variety of mistakes by scientists and the Governmentand the unwillingness of journal, magazine and newspaper editors to payattention to this topic. ’’The government made mistakes. But they made mistakes because they trusted theiradvisers. We don ’ t blame government, we blame the self-serving, closed-mindedadvisers. Hopefully, the government will learn a lesson and choose its advisersmore carefully. The Office of Naval Research has for years been in the vanguardof research. Dr. Edmund Storms at Los Alamos National Laboratory has extensivelyinvestigated cold fusion. Yet the government relies on advisers who have neverconducted a single experiment nor admittedly witnessed or reviewed anyexperiment.Other significant positive confirmations include:• SHELL OIL: Dufour of Shell Research in France presented a paper (#604) at thefifth ICCF. Detected up to seven watts of excess heat.• AMOCO PRODUCTION CO.: Issued Report T-90-E-02 (90081 ART 0082, 19 March1990). Several experiments “ yielded 30 percent energy gain over the life of theexperiment (two months). ” Was repeated. Second group of experiments alsoyielded 30 percent energy gain.• BECHTEL CORP.: B. Klein of Bechtel Corp. has explored the economics of coldfusion and concludes that generator units operating at 10-20kw will encouragepower users to gradually unplug from the power networks. (Development at thistime is entirely on units greater than 10kw).• (CEREM) FRENCH ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION: Lonchampt et al 150 percent excessheat using the Pons-Fleischmann method.• LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY: Dr. Edmund Storms has worked extensively oncold fusion especially electrode surfaces. Numerous over unity results.• EPRI (Electronic Power Research Institute): Report No. TR -104195. Excesspower ranging from a few percent to 350 percent observed (6 August 1996).• NASA (Lewis Research Center, Cleveland): Technical Memorandum #107167. Excessheat 6 to 68 percent.• U.S. NAVY (China Lake Air Warfare Center): Evidence for excess heat,particularly clear when Johnson Mathey palladium used for cathodes (seven ofeight cells produced 30 percent excess power).These results turned the tide. Government and those who stayed with cold fusionrealized that cold fusion was real. That didn ’ t stop the skeptics, notably Dr.Huizenga, who still today travels around the country preaching the gospel of “cold fusion is a fraud. ” Dr. Huizenga reportedly has actually witnessed overunity at California Polytechnic Laboratory and STILL cannot accept the facts.Pathological denial is the applicable phrase.These positive results came to the attention of credible authorities.The famed futurist Arthur C. Clarke (of 2001fame), in an interview with Discover(May 1997), was unequivocal in support. Several years before, Clarke, in aspeech to the Pacific Area Senior Officer Logistics Seminar (March 1993), hadbriefed senior allied officers on the potential:“ It is beyond serious dispute any more that anomalous amounts of energy arebeing produced from hydrogen by some unknown reaction . . . ”Later in 1998, Gerald Celente, founder of the well-known Trends ResearchInstitute, published Trends 2000 (Warner Books, New York, 1998). Celente wasalso unequivocal — he designated the new energy revolution based on cold fusionas “ the single biggest investment opportunity of the 21st century . . .forthose in the know a financial windfall. ”Celente parallels the statements we have made in this report without thedetails, although he is obviously aware of the technical detail. On page 304,under the heading “ Infinite Energy, ” Celente identifies the new fuel toenergize the economy as “ water . . . and air . . . and sun, ” adding:“ To tap into energy in the new millennium did not require huge utilities toprovide it or a complex infrastructure to mine, drill, refine, process, deliverand store . . .the promise of free energy, held out by visionaries over the lastdecades of the twentieth century was made good in the first decades of thetwenty-first. ” (page 305)“ The most promising of these [technologies] was cold fusion, or new hydrogenenergy, discovered in 1989. It was a relatively simple process, but it hadscientists baffled. ”Celente commented that even while the U.S. critics were bellowing “ fraud, ”actual commercial heating units were being produced in Eastern Europe by using aprocess clearly related to the original discovery (page 306).The Celente conclusion?“ The energy revolution will be the single biggest investment opportunity of thetwenty-first century. Its ramifications will extend to practically every aspectof human and planetary life. To profit from the trend investors should beginfamiliarizing themselves with the field thoroughly and immediately and keepabreast of developments before they become official. ”This last point ‘ before they become official ’ is important. There isabsolutely no question the US government has “ secrecy ” stamps all over itswork on cold fusion. Below we argue that this is highly counter-productive fornational security and national welfare. If one lesson stands out from the 20thcentury it is . . . GOVERNMENTS CANNOT INNOVATE."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3The Situation in Early 1999Cold fusion in several variants is a confirmed repeatable process. One of thesevariants does not require electrodes at all, simply immersion of palladium metal(perhaps other metals) in deuterium gas, (the Case catalytic process). The mostimportant effect is over-unity (i.e., more power is generated by the unit thanis needed to operate it, output/input ratio of 3:1 are routine today). There arereports of devices generating much more, e.g., several thousand to one. Oursense is that within a decade the higher ratios will be common.The most important cold fusion effect is over unity in the form of excess heat.The excess heat generated has to be converted to electricity. Work is nowconcentrated on devices to utilize low energy heat and its conversion. Heatingdevices are now at the industrial engineering stage. For example, Japaneseresearcher Mizuno considers excess heat to the biggest laboratory hurdle yet toovercome. In his book, Mizuno cites the case of a runaway cell in hislaboratory, which he had to dump in a bucket of water for ten days to cool down.Thermacore of Pennsylvania with a $75,000 Pentagon contract has built a devicethe size of a vacuum flask to heat a house without fuel, reportedly for 1000years.We anticipate several engineering routes possible and probable for thisengineering task.Home heaters and water heaters are now in development (reportedly alreadydeveloped in Eastern Europe, although we cannot yet confirm this report). Thiswill have an immediate and substantial effect on the heating oil industry.The new standard is therefore over-unity, i.e. over 100% efficiency. Fossilfuels cannot meet this standard. Their efficiencies are in the 15-20% range.The gasoline fuel cells promoted by the Department of Energy and developed byArthur Little Company are about 65% efficient. They appear to be aimed atslowing down the shift away from petroleum fuels. DOE could have gone straightto over unity cold fusion (except that it has already committed itself to the “impossible ” position). Coal is about 32 percent efficient. The new standard isset by cold fusion. The market will accept these technologies and reject thosethat do not meet this standard.There is no way this can be stopped. What we don ’ t know is the time frame.The chance of extremely low cost heating, virtually no cost, will be so powerfulthat it will sweep away any opposition. The burden of heating cost in the NorthEastern U.S. is so great that any opposition is unlikely.This is a non-polluting technology. The entire pollution prevention industry isunnecessary. Regulations and restrictions can be removed . . . there is nopollution to regulate. Incidentally, one of the great mysteries is why theenvironmental groups, including Sierra Club, have not recognized thenon-polluting potential of cold fusion. We brought this to the attention of theSierra Club four years ago . . . without any response. The only conclusion wecan formulate is that without pollution there is no anti-pollution movement, andpollution free energy will remove one of the pillars that supports theenvironmental industry. In other words the environmental movement is anindustry like coal and oil."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4Initial Economic EffectsOnly one study of the economic effects of cold fusion is known. It is availablein German or English from Dr Josef Gruber of University of Hagen in Germany.Today ’ s economists have an extraordinary weakness. The field of economicsassumes technology as a \"given\", as a fixed parameter in a static world . . .about as far from reality as one can get. And like physics, modern economistshave tried to convert economics into mathematical symbolism based on fixedassumptions.On the other hand one great contribution of modern economics has been theunderstanding and promotion of market forces for efficient distribution ofresources. The mid-century fascination with economic planning (\"planned chaos\")has been abandoned in favor of a recognition of market forces.The Gruber study overcomes the first limitation and explores cold fusion in thestructure of an enterprise society. A similar study has been undertaken byBectel Corporation to estimate movement off the grid system.Because of inadequate response by the Government, it is probable that severalindustries which would be initially affected are not aware of the comingtransformation. Because of this gap in information they have not conductednecessary studies. This is one of the reasons why we state emphatically thatDepartment of Energy incompetence has significant national security impact. Thisis a Department that doesn't understand market economics and neither does itunderstand the technology of cold fusion.The initial impact, as Bechtel has foreseen, will be on the electricity grid.But in addition to withdrawal from the grid system there will be wrenchingchange for the heating and cooling industries., These latter will be impactedprobably before the grid system because space heating units can be developedbefore heat to electricity conversion units. Because of weakness in the officialacademic-government structure, this aspect has been entirely ignored.The \"wild ride\" foreseen by a senior Federal Reserve Bank official (see FTIRJanuary 1999, in bibliography) can be smoothed by withdrawing funds from coal,oil and atomic technical research and devoting funds to cold fusion research.Today Government policy is exaggerating the complexity and impact of changeover.Policy is designed to keep us in the 19th and 20th centuries, while the market,reflecting citizen ability and demand, is urging us into the 21st.The efficiency differences are so astounding that Government retreat fromscience funding is an elementary first step. Today we have the equivalent offinancing stage coach research as the automobile enters production in 1900. DOEdenies cold fusion research funds while funding coal, oil and atomic research.This is what we call \"planned chaos\", after the late, great Ludwig van Mises whoforesaw these absurdities in a different context.Another step is to alert initial impact industries of likely future changes. Notonly the electricity grids, heating and cooling industries, but more obscuregroups. Even the travel industry will be effected, real estate in isolatedareas, the pipeline network and steel pipe mills. Coal mining and coal miningmachinery, coal transportation, petroleum exploration and development and manyothers will receive some initial impact.In particular the strategic balance will be changed. The requirement to defendthe Middle East is reduced. In fact the quickest way to bring peace to theMiddle East is to push cold fusion research. Without Iraqi oil exports there isno Iraqi armament industry.This reduction in some industries is offset by rapid, very rapid, expansion inlight manufacturing and metal working industries which can manufacture coldfusion devices on a gigantic scale. There will be expansion in chemical catalystindustries, although it is not yet certain that palladium is the cheapest usablecatalyst. Obviously deuterium gas will be a winner. In brief, wrenching changesin the structure of industry. Losses for the slow moving. Profit for the alert.Disaster for those who listen to the self-promoting talking heads in Washington,major Universities, and a senile daily press.The greatest danger is political. That politicians will dump the financial loadonto citizens whereas in an enterprise society the enterprise bears the weightof losses as well as advantages of profit."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5TimingThis is the tough question: when? When will reality hit the market place? Howsuddenly and over what period of time? Will it be panic free-fall or slowerosion of prices?Censorship will not stop these new energy technologies. Censorship will delaypublic awareness . . . markets will take longer to discount the news. That ’ sabout it.Former Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger ’ s comment that Government isconcerned about speed of events makes sense. This is the way governments think .. . but even governments are helpless against markets. The Soviet Uniondiscovered this truism. Sensible governments like sensible investors don ’ t tryto fight market trends.Moreover, Weinberger ’ s comment is reinforced from an unusual source — aradio interview from Gordon Novel (one-time intelligence operative now in afederal jail) by Don Weideman (printed in Freedom Forum , October 1996). Novelhad links to the CIA and was on a friendly basis with former CIA Director BillColby.This interview refers accurately to physicist Hal Puthoffs research on zeropoint energy and states “ the government knows that energy is free ” and “ themotive of the New World Order is to stop technologies that eliminate oil, gas,coal and nuclear energy that make it possible for people to get energy fornothing. ” Novel concluded, “ They ’ re petrified at the advent of thesetechnologies, which is right around the corner. ”To continue, the potential in new energy technology is so extraordinary that ifheld back and then released suddenly it can bring about the very panic thatgovernment is reportedly trying to prevent. Release of pressure over time issafer than sudden release. Government has reason to be “ petrified. ” Themagnitude of the change is above anything we have experienced, including WorldWar II.More likely the government is attempting to delay market awareness to enable itscorporate friends to restructure their market position . . . this “ policyactions in exchange for political contributions ” stance is endemic in theClinton Administration.Imagine the horror of the pension funds, the mutual funds and other investmentvehicles to find that their key investment targets are about to becomeworthless. They have paid their dues in the form of campaign contributions andthey want something back (as we saw in the Larry Lawrence-Arlington NationalCemetery affair). The pressure of the status quo vested interest on the WhiteHouse is enormous.In the long run, of course, such political games are useless — a waste of timeand money. They can delay but not remove. They may aid the favored political fewbut to the disadvantage of the many. What happens is, change in the mix ofwinners and losers. The most sensible procedure for society and the economy as awhole is to allow free markets and free flow of information.This is unlikely in the case of new energy technology because presentlyinfluential groups (Novel says New World Order) are desperately fixed on keepingtheir financial and intellectual investments intact.For a moment imagine yourself a board director of Shell or AMOCO and yourresearch director has a report from your own laboratories that concludes thecold fusion process is valid and has achieved over unity. (This is actual factfor Shell and AMOCO). The elementary fact is that oil, gas, and coal are maybe15 to 20 percent efficient and you are looking at a verifiable 100 percentcompetitor.What we can say with certainty is that the new technology will be dominant bythe end of the 21st century, probably before 2050.This is also futurist Arthur C. Clarke's view and his track record is excellent.A similar view, but less forthright, is held by Gerald Celente, president of thewell-known Trend Research Institute.Celente says new energy technology will be the “ single biggest investmentopportunity of the 21st century. ”The decades of equipment changeover from now to 2050 will be overflowing withopportunity but also will create extraordinary losses for the uninformed or theslow and tardy who operate on denial rather than analysis. This is heads up timefor energy investors.Government and utilities are already pressing for legislation to pass lossesonto the consumer. California is scheduled to vote on a $7 billion bond issue toretire utility debt. This is to remove the burden form stockholders onto thepublic. It will, however, even if passed, be insufficient. The Los AngelesDepartment of Water & Power debt alone is about $7 billion.At some point the cat is out of the bag. The unknown factor is when theinformation in this report will become general public knowledge. It isconceivable, but unlikely, that the government can delay for decades if the newsmedia continues unresponsive to any evidence of new energy technology. This isunlikely.Our sense is that the period 2000 to 2005, maybe 2010 will see financial panicand wholesale dumping of any financial asset related to fossil and atomicenergy. This could spill over onto the house of cards built on derivatives andjunk bonds. The precise time depends on public awareness. This suggestsimmediate pruning of investments. There is definite potential for panic and freefall in stock prices.Oracle lost 30% in one day and Oracle has a more favorable future than manyenergy stocks. Balance against this the increasing world demand for energy whichacts as a cushion to some extent.Timing? It is better to be safe than sorry, so move with deliberate speed.Historically, our analyses tend to be way ahead of the pack (i.e., on Soviettechnology we were 20 years ahead of CIA, according to William Casey).But remember that Zapata Offshore, owned by the Bush family with excellentintelligence resources, got out of oil and gas completely some years ago. Youstill have time to think, check and evaluate. You do not have time to admire thescenery.We see strong probability that the market will begin to discount the energyrevolution in 1998-1999. We are first to warn but we have limited circulation.We don ’ t affect the market. If Kiplinger or Barrons prints these facts . . .watch out.Announcements from firms now in pre-commercialization of new energy devices lookto 1998, and have done so for some years. Slippage in introducing newtechnologies is common. On the other hand there are no extraordinary engineeringproblems left to be solved. FTIR at one time considered the low energy heat tobe a barrier but conversion of low energy heat to electricity has been looked atcarefully with polymers as one solution. These devices should be availableshortly after the turn of the century. The media blackout cannot continue oncedevices are in general use and will collapse quickly. Generally, be skepticalabout reporting in the general media. It will not give you the full story.Briefly, this is the first call. You have time. Above all, be prepared forsudden moves in the energy market. But don ’ t get caught with the investingherd looking for the exit.If you need reinforcement or want a second opinion, because you are highly riskaverse, take a look at Infinite Energy , edited by Dr. Eugene Mallove (seeReference section)."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6OpportunityFrom the economic viewpoint new energy technologies are different to fossilfuels where fortunes are made by monopolies or resource scarcity. New energy isstructurally more competitive and adapted to small engineering firms in acompetitive marketplace where the best product wins out.There are many reasons for this view (elaborated in The View From 4-Space ).Essentially, the fuel is space or water universally available. The device is notcomplex in itself. Technical expertise is the key to success and is the coreinput. Not only are monopolistic elements absent but there is — even this earlyin development — a range of competitive processes.The rewards for a successful device are unbelievable, even without any monopolyelements. Martin Fleischmann once calculated that the first commercial devicewill be worth about $300 trillion. But he assumed monopoly. In fact, even atthis early stage competitive systems are emerging . . . different engineering tothe same end.The market is global, vast beyond imagination, and will be divided among severalor many competing systems. For once in human history we have the opportunity toeliminate scarcity, the basis of economics. We are looking at the impossible:what is the demand for an almost free good, a necessity worldwide in an almostfree market? While supply cannot be monopolized, there are virtually no costs(only device engineering) and no economies of scale.For a product with these properties the word “ risk ” takes on a differentmeaning. When this penetrates the financial community the pioneers will havetrouble turning away the investment capital offered. The single major problemwill probably be the flood of scams. We have already seen with the Dennis Leefree energy cross country tour . . . investors actually handed over fundswithout sight of the device. In fact, Dennis Lee had no device, just a car loadof promises . . .and a rap sheet for fraud.The rewards are more than monetary. And the losses more than financial. There isthe psychological reward that these technologies will solve many of the world ’s nagging problems. Energy becomes almost a free good like air and water.Non-polluting, non-political, non-monopolizing. With these possibilities riskbecomes secondary. The sociological and political spill over is heavy. The worldof pork bellies and derivatives become trivial, and a competitive structureensures that monopoly profit is not available for political objectives as NewWorld Order and political influence. Today there are a dozen genuine groundfloor opportunities and more in startup (where we have no track record).Lack of U.S. government support has forced R&D into the private sector. This istough on individual developers but in the long run will speed development andbenefit society. We are skeptical about government involvement, it turnsdevelopment into a political football. And the same tired old revolving doorspecialists will attempt to use government access to gain control. The privateapproach is fairer, much faster, more practical and has more benefits tosociety, although pioneers like Pons and Fleischmann have carried a heavypersonal burden. In the long run this is the beneficial road for society as awhole.Above all this is technology with no monopoly controlled inputs, there is noargument for government regulation. The only input apart from technical know-howis space or water. Even the electrodes cannot be monopolized. To be sure thereis scarcity of platinum and palladium but titanium, nickel and silver have alsobeen used as well as solid state devices. In brief, the barriers to entry arelow, being mainly technical expertise.The technology is now available through licensing to any entrepreneur withtechnical ability, some capital and market knowledge. The problem today is notreproducibility of the over unity effect but to reproduce the conditionsnecessary to achieve the effect (i.e., electrode surfaces). This simple point isvital and has been overlooked by science orthodoxy and the media community. Thisis why technical expertise is vital.The urgent factors for technology are those associated with mass production andautomated processes in materials science.We list below companies today developing components or systems in cold fusiontechnology. At the time of this writing (December 1997) some of these firms areinterested in discussing partnerships or investment.We cannot of course predict who will succeed but we are satisfied with thetechnical ability of each firm cited. These firms already have technicalefficiency. They are now ready for the marketplace to test their efficiencyagainst each other. These are not Dennis Lee scam operations. These are run bytechnically competent pioneers with years working on the technology of coldfusion.For more substantial investors who want to spread their risk under capablemanagement and who can qualify as “ accredited investors ” there is apartnership proposal available with a minimum investment of $250,000:--------------------------------------NEW ENERGY PARTNERS, L.P., Greenwich, Connecticut, Managing Partner: Daniel J.Cavicchio Jr.Cavicchio is a known business executive (Marquis Who ’ s Who) with an excellenttrack record.

Case has several degrees from MIT in Chemical Engineering. Lookingfor joint ventures with power companies.In brief, there is an emerging ferment of development activity, includingprivate cooperative arrangements between individual designers using varioussystems and product developers. This is a healthy free enterprise, moreproductive route than the Big Science/Big Government hot fusion route usingtaxpayer funds. For example, in this cooperative arrangement if a specificdesign does not meet performance standards it will be junked, whereas in the BigGovernment mode the developers will try to continue to keep funds rolling.The precise marketing point reached by each firm is an in-house secret. However,it can be assumed that water heaters and space heaters are in development. Thesewill be non-polluting, standalone units (there are no economies of scale) notlinked to the grid and with low maintenance. The capital cost of generatingelectricity, relatively small, will be met by the end user. The concept of “utilities ” is antiquated. We know prototypes exist. The questions today areproduction engineering and marketing strategy.Movement Out of Oil and GasSooner or later will come the rush to the exit for utilities. Some are alreadycreeping stealthily in that direction.Without access to boardroom discussions it is almost impossible to determine WHYa company has sold oil and gas assets . . .Trading assets and properties iscommon in oil and gas. Further, in some countries there can be regulatorypressure to sell assets. But here are three interesting cases:Zapata CorporationZapata Offshore Co. was founded in 1954 by former President George Bush, andpartners to develop oil and gas properties. By the 1980s, Zapata developed intoa sizable company. Also during this time, George Bush became first director ofthe CIA, then vice president, and finally president of the United States. Weknow that CIA collects data on new energy technologies. By the early 1990sZapata had sold ALL its oil and gas properties and the Bush family sold Zapatato Malcolm Glazer who has taken the company into the fish protein business.Calculated disinvestment of lucky chance?UNOCAL SalesOn February 21, 1996, the New York Times reported the following:“ In a continuing trend by major oil companies to sell off domestic assets tofinance exploration overseas UNOCAL said yesterday that it was selling its oiland gas fields in California for $500 million . . . ”Properties are being moved from majors to independents who then cut costs andcontract out operations.Calculated dis-investment or lucky chance?Update at July 1, 1998In the last few months new discoveries and advances have been made. The mostsignificant is the emergence of work by chemical engineer Dr. Leslie Case. InMay, Case, formerly unknown, announced that he had been working for six years oncatalytic cold fusion and was awaiting grant of the patent. The Case catalyticcell is a tested, reliable generator of excess heat, simple and cheap.The process is deceptively simple: heat palladium, activate carbon in deuterium(heavy hydrogen) gas. No electrolysis. Generates reliable excess heat attemperatures higher than P-F cold fusion (>150 ° C, up to 250 ° C).From the industrial engineering viewpoint, the Case process has the advantage ofextreme simplicity. We anticipate numerous workers will follow up withdemonstration units. All the equipment is available off the shelf and ideal foruniversity laboratory work. The catalyst is commercially available and deuteriumgas is cheap and plentiful. (International Patent No. WO 97743768, publishedNov. 20, 1997).The Case catalytic cell appears to be far and away the most useful cold fusiondevice yet . . . and Case has made full disclosure of the technology.This is what the cold fusion phenomenon needed — the input of an experiencedchemical engineer to convert the laboratory phenomenon of “ cold fusion ” intoan industrial engineered product. Cold fusion has now bridged this gap by usingcatalytic reaction instead of electrical. For details, read the patent (citedabove) and Infinite Energy (Vol. 4, Nov. 19, 1998).Combined with the enthusiasm and technical skills of Eugene Mallove, the Casecatalytic fusion device is the demonstration device that could break theirrational barrier of “ official science. ” For more information, contact ColdFusion Technology, Inc., P.O.

What is the demand for an almost free good, aglobal necessity in an almost free market?While supply cannot be monopolized there are virtually no resource costs, onlydevice engineering and production costs and no economies of scale.For a product with these properties the word \"risk\" takes on a differentmeaning. Sooner or later a potential entrepreneur with substantial capital anddrive will visualize the opportunities and put together a package of capital andskills to bring the possibility to reality. Sooner or later this will happen,it is only a question of \"when\".When this event penetrates the financial world, the pioneers will have troubleturning away the flood of capital offered. One problem will be the usual scams,and we've already had examples of this phenomenon.Rewards are more than monetary. As Methernitha has insisted, there aresociological and spiritual aspects. And the losses are more than financial.These technologies will solve many of the world ’ s intractable problems,without Big Government intervention. This is an almost risk free device withthe attributes of a free good like water and air. Non-polluting, non-political,non-monopolizing.The developers will be more powerful than Governments and for this reason theMethernitha Community has up to recently declined publicity for theirelectrostatic over-unity device. It is difficult to comment on this approach. We are all young in understanding this new technology which is more than justcold fusion and over unity.Yet in spite of this awe inspiring importance, the basic research is stillrestricted to the backwoods of New Hampshire and a damp cold undergroundlaboratory in Hokkaido Japan, not in the lavish taxpayer funded laboratories inCalifornia and Boston. A planet with such screwed up priorities needs to take agood look at itself.The world of pork bellies and derivative becomes trivial. The competitivenature of the cold fusion structure ensures that monopoly profit is notavailable for political objectives and influence peddling. In fact much of thevast governmental apparatus can be dissolved as unnecessary. Without the needfor oil there is no Middle East vital interest. Without pollution, the pollutionindustry, and its powerful lobby disappears.US Government opposition, stemming from the 1989 Bush-Seaborg meeting forcedcold fusion R&D essentially into the private sector although some individualgovernment scientists continue to do excellent individual work and of coursecame under harassment for their dedication.This peer opposition is tough on individual researchers, especially in the earlystages, but in the long run will speed development and benefit society.Consequently we are skeptical about the need for government involvement beyondfunding basic research (as suggested by David Nagel of U.S. Navy) and provisionof seed money. Bring in Government and cold fusion development becomes apolitical football, distorts the resource allocation mechanism and enables thesame tired old revolving door operators to use Government access for influenceand control. To replace an entrepreneur using his own capital with a technocratusing taxpayer funds is the height of folly. We should have learned that lessonby this time.The private sector approach is fairer, faster, practical and beneficial tosociety. To be sure the pioneers carry a heavy personal burden, but this theyknow and recognize.This is not monopoly technology. There is no argument for Governmentintervention. The technology is available by licensing to any entrepreneur withaccess to technical ability, capital and market knowledge. A start-upentrepreneur doesn't need friends in high places or even lobbying assets. Thereis nothing the politicians need to do for this technology, except vote some seedmoney and keep out of the way. The technical problem today is not duplication ofa cold fusion process but the more limited challenges of scale up, processcontrol, electrode surfaces and creating the conditions for reproducibility.There are unknowns but these are normal at this stage of any new technology."},{"pageContent":"ReferencesFor a quick authoritative overview get a copy of Infinite Energy , a bi-monthlyjournal edited by Dr. Eugene Mallove, former Press Officer at MIT.

What these books prove is that science has lost its way andapparently most scientists (in 1998) prefer their theoretical assumptions overobservable fact.Their genius lies in funding, not science. This official group has conned thepoliticians into funding only their science...and the innocent taxpayer ends uppaying their bills. Meanwhile, the honest pioneers have to fund their ownresearch."}]
