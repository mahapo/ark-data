Roosevelt in the United States, and the1933 seizure of power by Adolf Hitler in Germany.Each of these events introduced some variant of socialism into a major country —i.e., Bolshevik socialism in Russia, New Deal socialism in the United States,and National socialism in Germany.Contemporary academic histories, with perhaps the sole exception of CarrollQuigley’s Tragedy And Hope, ignore this evidence. On the other hand, it isunderstandable that universities and research organizations, dependent onfinancial aid from foundations that are controlled by this same New Yorkfinancial elite, would hardly want to support and to publish research on theseaspects of international politics. The bravest of trustees is unlikely to bitethe hand that feeds his organization.It is also eminently clear from the evidence in this trilogy that“public-spirited businessmen” do not journey to Washington as lobbyists andadministrators in order to serve the United States. They are in Washington toserve their own profit-maximizing interests. Their purpose is not to further acompetitive, free-market economy, but to manipulate a politicized regime, callit what you will, to their own advantage,It is business manipulation of Hitler’s accession to power in March 1933 that isthe topic of Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler.ANTONY C. SUTTONJuly, 1976"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONUnexplored Facets of NaziismSince the early 1920s unsubstantiated reports have circulated to the effect thatnot only German industrialists, but also Wall Street financiers, had some role —possibly a substantial role — in the rise of Hitler and Naziism. This bookpresents previously unpublished evidence, a great deal from files of theNuremberg Military Tribunals, to support this hypothesis. However, the fullimpact and suggestiveness of the evidence cannot be found from reading thisvolume alone. Two previous books in this series, Wall Street and the BolshevikRevolution1 [bm06.html#fm6fn1] and Wall Street and FDR,2 [bm06.html#fm6fn2]described the roles of the same firms, and often the same individuals and theirfellow directors, hard at work manipulating and assisting the Bolshevikrevolution in Russia in 1917, backing Franklin D. Roosevelt for President in theUnited States in 1933, as well as aiding the rise of Hitler in pre-war Germany.In brief, this book is part of a more extensive study of the rise of modernsocialism and the corporate socialists.This politically active Wall Street group is more or less the same elitistcircle known generally among Conservatives as the “Liberal Establishment,” byliberals (for instance G. William Domhoff) as “the ruling class,”3[bm06.html#fm6fn3] and by conspiratorial theorists Gary Allen4[bm06.html#fm6fn4] and Dan Smoot5 [bm06.html#fm6fn5] as the “Insiders.” Butwhatever we call this self-perpetuating elitist group, it is apparentlyfundamentally significant in the determination of world affairs, at a level farbehind and above that of the elected politicians.The influence and work of this same group in the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germanyis the topic of this book. This is an area of historical research almost totallyunexplored by the academic world. It is an historical minefield for the unwaryand the careless not aware of the intricacies of research procedures. TheSoviets have long accused Wall Street bankers of backing international fascism,but their own record of historical accuracy hardly lends their accusations muchcredence in the West, and they do not of course criticize support of their ownbrand of fascism.This author falls into a different camp. Previously accused of being overlycritical of Sovietism and domestic socialism, while ignoring Wall Street and therise of Hitler, this book hopefully will redress an assumed and quite inaccuratephilosophical imbalance and emphasize the real point at issue: Whatever you callthe collectivist system — Soviet socialism, New Deal socialism, corporatesocialism, or National socialism — it is the average citizen, the guy in thestreet, that ultimately loses out to the boys running the operation at the top.Each system in its own way is a system of plunder, an organizational device toget everyone living (or attempting to live) at the expense of everyone else,while the elitist leaders, the rulers and the politicians, scalp the cream offthe top,The role of this American power elite in the rise of Hitler should also beviewed in conjunction with a little-known aspect of Hitlerism only now beingexplored: the mystical origins of Naziism, and its relations with the ThuleSociety and with other conspiratorial groups. This author is no expert onoccultism or conspiracy, but it is obvious that the mystical origins, theneo-pagan historical roots of Naziism, the Bavarian Illuminati and the ThuleSociety, are relatively unknown areas yet to be explored by technicallycompetent researchers. Some research is already recorded in French; probably thebest introduction in English is a translation of Hitler et la Tradition Cathareby Jean Michel Angebert.6 [bm06.html#fm6fn6]Angebert reveals the 1933 crusade of Schutzstaffel member Otto Rahn in search ofthe Holy Grail, which was supposedly located in the Cathar stronghold inSouthern France. The early Nazi hierarchy (Hitler and Himmler, as well asRudolph Hess and Rosenberg) was steeped in a neo-pagan theology, in partassociated with the Thule Society, whose ideals were close to those of theBavarian Illuminati. This was a submerged driving force behind Naziism, with apowerful mystical hold over the hard-core S.S. faithful. Our contemporaryestablishment historians barely mention, let alone explore, these occultorigins; consequently, they miss an element equally as important as thefinancial origins of National Socialism,In 1950 James Stewart Martin published a very readable book, All Honorable Men,7[bm06.html#fm6fn7] describing his experiences as Chief of the Economic WarfareSection of the Department of Justice investigating the structure of Naziindustry. Martin asserts that American and British businessmen got themselvesappointed to key positions in this post-war investigation to divert, stifle andmuffle investigation of Nazi industrialists and so keep hidden their owninvolvement. One British officer was sentenced by court martial to two years injail for protecting a Nazi, and several American officials were removed fromtheir positions. Why would American and British businessmen want to protect Nazibusinessmen? In public they argued that these were merely German businessmen whohad nothing to do with the Nazi regime and were innocent of complicity in Naziconspiracies. Martin does not explore this explanation in depth, but he isobviously unhappy and skeptical about it. The evidence suggests there was aconcerted effort not only to protect Nazi businessmen, but also to protect thecollaborating elements from American and British business.The German businessmen could have disclosed a lot of uncomfortable facts. Inreturn for protection, they told very little. It is undoubtedly not coincidentalthat the Hitler industrialists on trial at Nuremberg received less than a slapon the wrist. We raise the question of whether the Nuremberg trials should nothave been held in Washington — with a few prominent U.S. businessmen as well asNazi businessmen in the dock!Two extracts from contemporary sources will introduce and suggest the theme tobe expanded. The first extract is from Roosevelt’s own files. The U.S.Ambassador in Germany, William Dodd, wrote FDR from Berlin on October 19, 1936(three years after Hitler came to power), concerning American industrialists andtheir aid to the Nazis:Much as I believe in peace as our best policy, I cannot avoid the fears whichWilson emphasized more than once in conversations with me, August 15, 1915 andlater: the breakdown of democracy in all Europe will be a disaster to thepeople. But what can you do? At the present moment more than a hundred Americancorporations have subsidiaries here or cooperative understandings. The DuPontshave three allies in Germany that are aiding in the armament business. Theirchief ally is the I. G. Farben Company, a part of the Government which gives200,000 marks a year to one propaganda organization operating on Americanopinion. Standard Oil Company (New York sub-company) sent $2,000,000 here inDecember 1933 and has made $500,000 a year helping Germans make Ersatz gas forwar purposes; but Standard Oil cannot take any of its earnings out of thecountry except in goods. They do little of this, report their earnings at home,but do not explain the facts. The International Harvester Company president toldme their business here rose 33% a year (arms manufacture, I believe), but theycould take nothing out. Even our airplanes people have secret arrangement withKrupps. General Motor Company and Ford do enormous businesses [sic] here throughtheir subsidiaries and take no profits out. I mention these facts because theycomplicate things and add to war dangers.8 [bm06.html#fm6fn8]Second, a quote from the diary of the same U.S. Ambassador in Germany. Thereader should bear in mind that a representative of the cited Vacuum Oil Company— as well as representatives of other Nazi-supporting American firms — wasappointed to the post-war Control Commission to de-Nazify the Nazis:January 23. Thursday. Our Commercial Attaché brought Dr. Engelbrecht, chairmanof the Vacuum Oil Company in Hamburg, to see me. Engelbrecht repeated what hehad said a year ago: “The Standard Oil Company of New York, the parent companyof the Vacuum, has spent 10,000,000 marks in Germany trying to find oilresources and building a great refinery near the Hamburg harbor.” Engelbrecht isstill boring wells and finding a good deal of crude oil in the Hanover region,but he had no hope of great deposits. He hopes Dr. Schacht will subsidize hiscompany as he does some German companies that have found no crude oil. TheVacuum spends all its earnings here, employs 1,000 men and never sends any ofits money home. I could give him no encouragement. . . .9 [bm06.html#fm6fn9]And further:These men were hardly out of the building before the lawyer came in again toreport his difficulties. I could not do anything. I asked him, however: Why didthe Standard Oil Company of New York send $1,000,000 over here in December,1933, to aid the Germans in making gasoline from soft coal for war emergencies?Why do the International Harvester people continue to manufacture in Germanywhen their company gets nothing out of the country and when it has failed tocollect its war losses? He saw my point and agreed that it looked foolish andthat it only means greater losses if another war breaks loose.10[bm06.html#fm6fn10]The alliance between Nazi political power and American “Big Business” may wellhave looked foolish to Ambassador Dodd and the American attorney he questioned.In practice, of course, “Big Business” is anything but foolish when it comes topromoting its own self-interest. Investment in Nazi Germany (along with similarinvestments in the Soviet Union) was a reflection of higher policies, with muchmore than immediate profit at stake, even though profits could not berepatriated. To trace these “higher policies” one has to penetrate the financialcontrol of multinational corporations, because those who control the flow offinance ultimately control the day-to-day policies.Carroll Quigley11 [bm06.html#fm6fn11] has shown that the apex of thisinternational financial control system before World War II was the Bank forInternational Settlements, with representatives from the international bankingfirms of Europe and the United States, in an arrangement that continuedthroughout World War II. During the Nazi period, Germany’s representative at theBank for International Settlements was Hitler’s financial genius and presidentof the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Horace Greeley SchachtHjalmar Horace Greeley SchachtWall Street involvement with Hitler’s Germany highlights two Germans with WallStreet connections — Hjalmar Schacht and “Putzi” Hanfstaengl. The latter was afriend of Hitler and Roosevelt who played a suspiciously prominent role in theincident that brought Hitler to the peak of dictatorial power — the Reichstagfire of 1933.12 [bm06.html#fm6fn12]The early history of Hjalmar Schacht, and in particular his role in the SovietUnion after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, was described in my earlier book,Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution. The elder Schacht had worked at theBerlin office of the Equitable Trust Company of New York in the early twentiethcentury. Hjalmar was born in Germany rather than New York only by the accidentof his mother’s illness, which required the family to return to Germany. BrotherWilliam Schacht was an American-born citizen. To record his American origins,Hjalmar’s middle names were designated “Horace Greeley” after the well-knowDemocrat politician. Consequently, Hjalmar spoke fluent English and the post-warinterrogation of Schacht in Project Dustbin was conducted in both German andEnglish. The point to be made is that the Schacht family had its origins in NewYork, worked for the prominent Wall Street financial house of Equitable Trust(which was controlled by the Morgan firm), and throughout his life Hjalmarretained these Wall Street connections.13 [bm06.html#fm6fn13] Newspapers andcontemporary sources record repeated visits with Owen Young of General Electric;Farish, chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey; and their banking counterparts.In brief, Schacht was a member of the international financial elite that wieldsits power behind the scenes through the political apparatus of a nation. He is akey link between the Wall Street elite and Hitler’s inner circle.This book is divided into two major parts. Part One records the build-up ofGerman cartels through the Dawes and Young Plans in the 1920s. These cartelswere the major supporters of Hitler and Naziism and were directly responsiblefor bringing the Nazis to power in 1933. The roles of American I. G. Farben,General Electric, Standard Oil of New Jersey, Ford, and other U.S. firms isoutlined. Part Two presents the known documentary evidence on the financing ofHitler, complete with photographic reproduction of the bank transfer slips usedto transfer funds from Farben, General Electric, and other firms to Hitler,through Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht."},{"pageContent":"PART ONEWALL STREET BUILDSNAZI INDUSTRY"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEWall Street Paves the Way for HitlerThe Dawes Plan, adopted in August 1924, fitted perfectly into the plans of theGerman General Staffs military economists. (Testimony before United StatesSenate, Committee on Military Affairs, 1946.)The post-World War II Kilgore Committee of the United States Senate hearddetailed evidence from government officials to the effect that,. . .when the Nazis came to power in 1933, they found that long strides had beenmade since 1918 in preparing Germany for war from an economic and industrialpoint of view.1 [bm06.html#ch1fn1]This build-up for European war both before and after 1933 was in great part dueto Wall Street financial assistance in the 1920s to create the German cartelsystem, and to technical assistance from well-known American firms which will beidentified later, to build the German Wehrmacht. Whereas this financial andtechnical assistance is referred to as “accidental” or due to the“short-sightedness” of American businessmen, the evidence presented belowstrongly suggests some degree of premeditation on the part of these Americanfinanciers. Similar and unacceptable pleas of “accident” were made on behalf ofAmerican financiers and industrialists in the parallel example of building themilitary power of the Soviet Union from 1917 onwards. Yet these Americancapitalists were willing to finance and subsidize the Soviet Union while theVietnam war was underway, knowing that the Soviets were supplying the otherside.The contribution made by American capitalism to German war preparations before1940 can only be described as phenomenal. It was certainly crucial to Germanmilitary capabilities. For instance, in 1934 Germany produced domestically only300,000 tons of natural petroleum products and less than 300,000 tons ofsynthetic gasoline; the balance was imported. Yet, ten years later in World WarII, after transfer of the Standard Oil of New Jersey hydrogenation patents andtechnology to I. G. Farben (used to produce synthetic gasoline from coal),Germany produced about 6 1/2 million tons of oil — of which 85 percent (5 1/2million tons) was synthetic oil using the Standard Oil hydrogenation process.Moreover, the control of synthetic oil output in Germany was held by the I. G.Farben subsidiary, Braunkohle-Benzin A. G., and this Farben cartel itself wascreated in 1926 with Wall Street financial assistance.On the other hand, the general impression left with the reader by modernhistorians is that this American technical assistance was accidental and thatAmerican industrialists were innocent of wrongdoing. For example, the KilgoreCommittee stated:The United States accidentally played an important role in the technical armingof Germany. Although the German military planners had ordered and persuadedmanufacturing corporations to install modern equipment for mass production,neither the military economists nor the corporations seem to have realized tothe full extent what that meant. Their eyes were opened when two of the chiefAmerican automobile companies built plants in Germany in order to sell in theEuropean market, without the handicap of ocean freight charges and high Germantariffs. Germans were brought to Detroit to learn the techniques of specializedproduction of components, and of straight-line assembly. What they saw causedfurther reorganization and refitting of other key German war plants. Thetechniques learned in Detroit were eventually used to construct the dive-bombingStukas . ... At a later period I. G. Farben representatives in this countryenabled a stream of German engineers to visit not only plane plants but othersof military importance, in which they learned a great deal that was eventuallyused against the United States.2 [bm06.html#ch1fn2]Following these observations, which emphasize the “accidental” nature of theassistance, it has been concluded by such academic writers as Gabriel Kolko, whois not usually a supporter of big business, that:It is almost superfluous to point out that the motives of the American firmsbound to contracts with German concerns were not pro-Nazi, whatever else theymay have been.3 [bm06.html#ch1fn3]Yet, Kolko to the contrary, analyses of the contemporary American business pressconfirm that business journals and newspapers were fully aware of the Nazithreat and its nature, while warning their business readers of German warpreparations. And even Kolko admits that:The business press [in the United States] was aware, from 1935 on, that Germanprosperity was based on war preparations. More important, it was conscious ofthe fact that German industry was under the control of the Nazis and was beingdirected to serve Germany’s rearmament, and the firm mentioned most frequentlyin this context was the giant chemical empire, I, G. Farben.4 [bm06.html#ch1fn4]Further, the evidence presented below suggests that not only was an influentialsector of American business aware of the nature of Naziism, but for its ownpurposes aided Naziism wherever possible (and profitable) — with full knowledgethat the probable outcome would be war involving Europe and the United States.As we shall see, the pleas of innocence do not accord with the facts,1924: The Dawes PlanThe Treaty of Versailles after World War I imposed a heavy reparations burden ondefeated Germany. This financial burden — a real cause of the German discontentthat led to acceptance of Hitlerism — was utilized by the international bankersfor their own benefit. The opportunity to float profitable loans for Germancartels in the United States was presented by the Dawes Plan and later the YoungPlan. Both plans were engineered by these central bankers, who manned thecommittees for their own pecuniary advantages, and although technically thecommittees were not appointed by the U.S. Government, the plans were in factapproved and sponsored by the Government,Post-war haggling by financiers and politicians fixed German reparations at anannual fee of 132 billion gold marks. This was about one quarter of Germany’stotal 1921 exports. When Germany was unable to make these crushing payments,France and Belgium occupied the Ruhr to take by force what could not be obtainedvoluntarily. In 1924 the Allies appointed a committee of bankers (headed byAmerican banker Charles G. Dawes) to develop a programme of reparationspayments. The resulting Dawes Plan was, according to Georgetown UniversityProfessor of International Relations Carroll Quigley, “largely a J. P. Morganproduction.”5 [bm06.html#ch1fn5] The Dawes Plan arranged a series of foreignloans totalling $800 million with their proceeds flowing to Germany. These loansare important for our story because the proceeds, raised for the greater part inthe United States from dollar investors, were utilized in the mid-1920s tocreate and consolidate the gigantic chemical and steel combinations of I. G.Farben and Vereinigte Stahlwerke, respectively. These cartels not only helpedHitler to power in 1933; they also produced the bulk of key German war materialsused in World War II.Between 1924 and 1931, under the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan, Germany paid outto the Allies about 36 billion marks in reparations. At the same time Germanyborrowed abroad, mainly in the U.S., about 33 billion marks — thus making a netGerman payment of only three billion marks for reparations. Consequently, theburden of German monetary reparations to the Allies was actually carried byforeign subscribers to German bonds issued by Wall Street financial houses — atsignificant profits for themselves, of course. And, let it be noted, these firmswere owned by the same financiers who periodically took off their banker hatsand donned new ones to become “statesmen.” As “statesmen” they formulated theDawes and Young Plans to “solve” the “problem” of reparations. As bankers, theyfloated the loans. As Carroll Quigley points out,It is worthy of note that this system was set up by the international bankersand that the subsequent lending of other people’s money to Germany was veryprofitable to these bankers.6 [bm06.html#ch1fn6]Who were the New York international bankers who formed these reparationscommissions?The 1924 Dawes Plan experts from the United States were banker Charles Dawes andMorgan representative Owen Young, who was president of the General ElectricCompany. Dawes was chairman of the Allied Committee of Experts in 1924. In 1929Owen Young became chairman of the Committee of Experts, supported by J. P.Morgan himself, with alternates T. W. Lamont, a Morgan partner, and T. N.Perkins, a banker with Morgan associations. In other words, the U.S. delegationswere purely and simply, as Quigley has pointed out, J. P. Morgan delegationsusing the authority and seal of the United States to promote financial plans fortheir own pecuniary advantage. As a result, as Quigley puts it, the“international bankers sat in heaven, under a rain of fees and commissions.”7[bm06.html#ch1fn7]The German members of the Committee of Experts were equally interesting. In 1924Hjalmar Schacht was president of the Reichsbank and had taken a prominent rolein organization work for the Dawes Plan; so did German banker Carl Melchior. Oneof the 1928 German delegates was A. Voegler of the German steel cartelStahlwerke Vereinigte. In brief, the two significant countries involved — theUnited States and Germany — were represented by the Morgan bankers on one sideand Schacht and Voegler on the other, both of whom were key characters in therise of Hitler’s Germany and subsequent German rearmament,Finally, the members and advisers of the Dawes and Young Commissions were notonly associated with New York financial houses but, as we shall later see, weredirectors of firms within the German cartels which aided Hitler to power.1928: The Young PlanAccording to Hitler’s financial genie, Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, and Naziindustrialist Fritz Thyssen, it was the 1928 Young Plan (the successor to theDawes Plan), formulated by Morgan agent Owen D. Young, that brought Hitler topower in 1933.Fritz Thyssen claims that,I turned to the National Socialist party only after I became convinced that thefight against the Young Plan was unavoidable if complete collapse of Germany wasto be prevented.8 [bm06.html#ch1fn8]The difference between the Young Plan and the Dawes Plan was that, while theYoung Plan required payments in goods produced in Germany financed by foreignloans, the Dawes Plan required monetary payments and “In my judgment [wroteThyssen] the financial debt thus created was bound to disrupt the entire economyof the Reich.”The Young Plan was assertedly a device to occupy Germany with American capitaland pledge German real assets for a gigantic mortgage held in the United States.It is noteworthy that German firms with U.S. affiliations evaded the Plan by thedevice of temporary foreign ownership. For instance, A.E.G. (German GeneralElectric), affiliated with General Electric in the U.S., was sold to aFranco-Belgian holding company and evaded the conditions of the Young Plan. Itshould be noted in passing that Owen Young was the major financial backer forFranklin D. Roosevelt in the United European venture when FDR, as a budding WallStreet financier, endeavoured to take advantage of Germany’s 1923hyperinflation. The United European venture was a vehicle to speculate and toprofit upon the imposition of the Dawes Plan, and is clear evidence of privatefinanciers (including Franklin D. Roosevelt) using the power of the state toadvance their own interests by manipulating foreign policy.Schacht’s parallel charge that Owen Young was responsible for the rise ofHitler, while obviously self-serving, is recorded in a U.S. GovernmentIntelligence report relating the interrogation of Dr. Fritz Thyssen inSeptember, 1945:The acceptance of the Young Plan and its financial principles increasedunemployment more and more, until about one million were unemployed. People weredesperate. Hitler said he would do away with unemployment. The government inpower at that time was very bad, and the situation of the people was gettingworse. That really was the reason of the enormous success Hitler had in theelection. When the last election came, he got about 40%.9 [bm06.html#ch1fn9]However, it was Schacht, not Owen Young, who conceived the idea which laterbecame the Bank for International Settlements. The actual details were workedout at a conference presided over by Jackson Reynolds, “one of the leading NewYork bankers,” together with Melvin Traylor of the First National Bank ofChicago, Sir Charles Addis, formerly of the Hong Kong and Shanghai BankingCorporation, and various French and German bankers.10 [bm06.html#ch1fn10] TheB.I.S. was essential under the Young Plan as a means to afford a readyinstrument for promoting international financial relations. According to his ownstatements, Schacht also gave Owen Young the idea that later became thepost-World War II International Bank for Reconstruction and Development:“A bank of this kind will demand financial co-operation between vanquished andvictors that will lead to community of interests which in turn will give rise tomutual confidence and understanding and thus promote and ensure peace.”I can still vividly recall the setting in which this conversation took place.Owen Young was seated in his armchair puffing away at his pipe, his legsoutstretched, his keen eyes fixed unswervingly on me. As is my habit whenpropounding such arguments I was doing a quiet steady “quarter-deck” up and downthe room. When I had finished there was a brief pause. Then his whole facelighted up and his resolve found utterance in the words:“Dr. Schacht, you gave me a wonderful idea and I am going to sell it to theworld.”11 [bm06.html#ch1fn11]B.I.S. — The Apex of ControlThis interplay of ideas and cooperation between Hjalmar Schacht in Germany and,through Owen Young, the J. P. Morgan interests in New York, was only one facetof a vast and ambitious system of cooperation and international alliance forworld control. As described by Carroll Quigley, this system was “... nothingless than to create a world system of financial control, in private hands, ableto dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world asa whole.”12 [bm06.html#ch1fn12]This feudal system worked in the 1920s, as it works today, through the medium ofthe private central bankers in each country who control the national moneysupply of individual economies. In the 1920s and 1930s, the New York FederalReserve System, the Bank of England, the Reichbank in Germany, and the Banque deFrance also more or less influenced the political apparatus of their respectivecountries indirectly through control of the money supply and creation of themonetary environment. More direct influence was realized by supplying politicalfunds to, or withdrawing support from, politicians and political parties. In theUnited States, for example, President Herbert Hoover blamed his 1932 defeat onwithdrawal of support by Wall Street and the switch of Wall Street finance andinfluence to Franklin D. Roosevelt.Politicians amenable to the objectives of financial capitalism, and academicsprolific with ideas for world control useful to the international bankers, arekept in line with a system of rewards and penalties. In the early 1930s theguiding vehicle for this international system of financial and politicalcontrol, called by Quigley the “apex of the system,” was the Bank forInternational Settlements in Basle, Switzerland. The B.I.S. apex continued itswork during World War II as the medium through which the bankers — whoapparently were not at war with each other — continued a mutually beneficialexchange of ideas, information, and planning for the post-war world. As onewriter has observed, war made no difference to the international bankers:The fact that the Bank possessed a truly international staff did, of course,present a highly anomalous situation in time of war. An American President wastransacting the daily business of the Bank through a French General Manager, whohad a German Assistant General Manager, while the Secretary-General was anItalian subject. Other nationals occupied other posts. These men were, ofcourse, in daily personal contact with each other. Except for Mr. McKittrick[see infra] they were of course situated permanently in Switzerland during thisperiod and were not supposed to be subject to orders of their government at anytime. However, the directors of the Bank remained, of course, in theirrespective countries and had no direct contact with the personnel of the Bank.It is alleged, however, that H. Schacht, president of the Reichsbank, kept apersonal representative in Basle during most of this time.13 [bm06.html#ch1fn13]It was such secret meetings, “... meetings more secret than any ever held byRoyal Ark Masons or by any Rosicrucian Order . . .”14 [bm06.html#ch1fn14]between the central bankers at the “apex” of control that so intriguedcontemporary journalists, although they only rarely and briefly penetratedbehind the mask of secrecy.Building the German CartelsA practical example of international finance operating behind the scenes tobuild and manipulate politico-economic systems is found in the German cartelsystem. The three largest loans handled by the Wall Street international bankersfor German borrowers in the 1920s under the Dawes Plan were for the benefit ofthree German cartels which a few years later aided Hitler and the Nazis topower. American financiers were directly represented on the boards of two ofthese three German cartels. This American assistance to German cartels has beendescribed by James Martin as follows: “These loans for reconstruction became avehicle for arrangements that did more to promote World War II than to establishpeace after World War I.”15 [bm06.html#ch1fn15]The three dominant cartels, the amounts borrowed and the Wall Street floatingsyndicate were as follows:German Cartel Wall Street Syndicate Amount Issued AllgemeineElektrizitäts-Gesellschait(A.E.G.)

Kuczynski, Bankers Profits from German Loans (Washington, D.C.;Brookings Institution, 1932), p. 127.After the mid-1920s the two major German combines of I.G. Farben and VereinigteStahlwerke dominated the chemical and steel cartel system created by theseloans. Although these firms had a voting majority in the cartels for only two orthree basic products, they were able — through control of these basics — toenforce their will throughout the cartel. I.G. Farben was the main producer ofbasic chemicals used by other combines making chemicals, so its economic powerposition cannot be measured only by its capacity to produce a few basicchemicals. Similarly, Vereinigte Stahlwerke, with a pig-iron capacity greaterthan that of all other German iron and steel producers combined, was able toexercise far more influence in the semi-finished iron and steel products cartelthan its capacity for pig-iron production suggests. Even so the percentageoutput of these cartels for all products was significant:Vereinigte Stahlwerkeproducts Percent of German totalproduction in 1938 Pig iron 50.8 Pipes and tubes 45.5 Heavy plate 36.0Explosives 35.0 Coal tar 33.3 Bar steel 37.1 I.G. FarbenPercent of German totalproduction in 1937 Synthetic methanol100.0 Magnesium100.0 Chemical nitrogen70.0Explosives60.0 Synthetic gasoline(high octane)46.0 (1945) Brown coal20.0Among the products that brought I. G. Farben and Vereinigte Stahlwerke intomutual collaboration were coal tar and chemical nitrogen, both of primeimportance for the manufacture of explosives. I. G. Farben had a cartel positionthat assured dominance in the manufacture and sale of chemical nitrogen, but hadonly about one percent of the coking capacity of Germany. Hence an agreement wasmade under which Farben explosives subsidiaries obtained their benzol, toluol,and other primary coal-tar products on terms dictated by Vereinigte Stahlwerke,while Vereinigte Stahlwerke’s explosives subsidiary was dependent for itsnitrates on terms set by Farben. Under this system of mutual collaboration andinter-dependence, the two cartels, I. G. Farben and Vereinigte Stahlwerke,produced 95 percent of German explosives in 1937-8 on the eve of World War II.This production was from capacity built by American loans and to some extent byAmerican technology.The I. G. Farben-Standard Oil cooperation for production of synthetic oil fromcoal gave the I. G. Farben cartel a monopoly of German gasoline productionduring World War II. Just under one half of German high octane gasoline in 1945was produced directly by I. G. Farben and most of the balance by its affiliatedcompanies.In brief, in synthetic gasoline and explosives (two of the very basic elementsof modern warfare), the control of German World War II output was in the handsof two German combines created by Wall Street loans under the Dawes Plan.Moreover, American assistance to Nazi war efforts extended into other areas.17[bm06.html#ch1fn17] The two largest tank producers in Hitler’s Germany wereOpel, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors (controlled by the J. P.Morgan firm), and the Ford A. G subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company of Detroit.The Nazis granted tax-exempt status to Opel in 1936, to enable General Motors toexpand its production facilities. General Motors obligingly reinvested theresulting profits into German industry. Henry Ford was decorated by the Nazisfor his services to Naziism. Alcoa and Dow Chemical worked closely with Naziindustry with numerous transfers of their domestic U.S. technology. BendixAviation, in which the J. P. Morgan-controlled General Motors firm had a majorstock interest, supplied Siemens & Halske A. G. in Germany with data onautomatic pilots and aircraft instruments. As late as 1940, in the “unofficialwar,” Bendix Aviation supplied complete technical data to Robert Bosch foraircraft and diesel engine starters and received royalty payments in return.In brief, American companies associated with the Morgan-Rockefellerinternational investment bankers — not, it should be noted, the vast bulk ofindependent American industrialists — were intimately related to the growth ofNazi industry. It is important to note as we develop our story that GeneralMotors, Ford, General Electric, DuPont and the handful of U.S. companiesintimately involved with the development of Nazi Germany were — except for theFord Motor Company — controlled by the Wall Street elite — the J. P. Morganfirm, the Rockefeller Chase Bank and to a lesser extent the Warburg Manhattanbank.18 [bm06.html#ch1fn18] This book is not an indictment of all Americanindustry and finance. It is an indictment of the “apex” — those firms controlledthrough the handful of financial houses, the Federal Reserve Bank system, theBank for International Settlements, and their continuing internationalcooperative arrangements and cartels which attempt to control the course ofworld politics and economics."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOThe Empire of I.G. FarbenFarben was Hitler and Hitler was Farben. (Senator Homer T. Bone to SenateCommittee on Military Affairs, June 4, 1943.)On the eve of World War II the German chemical complex of I. G. Farben was thelargest chemical manufacturing enterprise in the world, with extraordinarypolitical and economic power and influence within the Hitlerian Nazi state. I.G. has been aptly described as “a state within a state.”The Farben cartel dated from 1925, when organizing genius Hermann Schmitz (withWall Street financial assistance) created the super-giant chemical enterpriseout of six already giant German chemical companies — Badische Anilin, Bayer,Agfa, Hoechst, Weiler-ter-Meer, and Griesheim-Elektron. These companies weremerged to become Internationale Gesellschaft Farbenindustrie A.G. — or I.G.Farben for short. Twenty years later the same Hermann Schmitz was put on trialat Nuremberg for war crimes committed by the I. G. cartel. Other I. G. Farbendirectors were placed on trial but the American affiliates of I. G. Farben andthe American directors of I. G. itself were quietly forgotten; the truth wasburied in the archives.It is these U.S. connections in Wall Street that concern us. Without the capitalsupplied by Wall Street, there would have been no I. G. Farben in the firstplace and almost certainly no Adolf Hitler and World War II.German bankers on the Farben Aufsichsrat (the supervisory Board of Directors)1[bm06.html#ch2fn1] in the late 1920s included the Hamburg banker Max Warburg,whose brother Paul Warburg was a founder of the Federal Reserve System in theUnited States. Not coincidentally, Paul Warburg was also on the board ofAmerican I. G, Farben’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiary. In addition to Max Warburgand Hermann Schmitz, the guiding hand in the creation of the Farben empire, theearly Farben Vorstand included Carl Bosch, Fritz ter Meer, Kurt Oppenheim andGeorge von Schnitzler.2 [bm06.html#ch2fn2] All except Max Warburg were chargedas “war criminals” after World War II.In 1928 the American holdings of I. G. Farben (i.e., the Bayer Company, GeneralAniline Works, Agfa Ansco, and Winthrop Chemical Company) were organized into aSwiss holding company, I. G. Chemie (Internationale Gesellschaft für ChemischeUnternehmungen A. G.), controlled by I. G. Farben in Germany. In the followingyear these American firms merged to become American I. G. Chemical Corporation,later renamed General Aniline & Film. Hermann Schmitz, the organizer of I. G.Farben in 1925, became a prominent early Nazi and supporter of Hitler, as wellas chairman of the Swiss I. G. Chemie and president of American I. G. The Farbencomplex both in Germany and the United States then developed into an integralpart of the formation and operation of the Nazi state machine, the Wehrmacht andthe S.S.I. G. Farben is of peculiar interest in the formation of the Nazi state becauseFarben directors materially helped Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933. Wehave photographic evidence (see Chapter Three [chapter03.html#ch3]) that I.G.Farben contributed 400,000 RM to Hitler’s political “slush fund.” It was thissecret fund which financed the Nazi seizure of control in March 1933. Many yearsearlier Farben had obtained Wall Street funds for the 1925 cartelization andexpansion in Germany and $30 million for American I. G. in 1929, and had WallStreet directors on the Farben board. It has to be noted that these funds wereraised and directors appointed years before Hitler was promoted as the Germandictator.The Economic Power of I. G. FarbenQualified observers have argued that Germany could not have gone to war in 1939without I. G. Farben. Between 1927 and the beginning of World War II, I.G.Farben doubled in size, an expansion made possible in great part by Americantechnical assistance and by American bond issues, such as the one for $30million offered by National City Bank. By 1939 I. G. acquired a participationand managerial influence in some 380 other German firms and over 500 foreignfirms. The Farben empire owned its own coal mines, its own electric powerplants, iron and steel units, banks, research units, and numerous commercialenterprises. There were over 2,000 cartel agreements between I. G. and foreignfirms — including Standard Oil of New Jersey, DuPont, Alcoa, Dow Chemical, andothers in the United States. The full story of I.G. Farben and its worldwideactivities before World War II can never be known, as key German records weredestroyed in 1945 in anticipation of Allied victory. However, one post-warinvestigation by the U.S. War Department concluded that:Without I. G.’s immense productive facilities, its intense research, and vastinternational affiliations, Germany’s prosecution of the war would have beenunthinkable and impossible; Farben not only directed its energies toward armingGermany, but concentrated on weakening her intended victims, and thisdouble-barreled attempt to expand the German industrial potential for war and torestrict that of the rest of the world was not conceived and executed “in thenormal course of business.” The proof is overwhelming that I. G, Farbenofficials had full prior knowledge of Germany’s plan for world conquest and ofeach specific aggressive act later undertaken . . . .3 [bm06.html#ch2fn3]Directors of Farben firms (i.e., the “I. G. Farben officials” referred to in theinvestigation) included not only Germans but also prominent American financiers.This 1943 U.S. War Department report concluded that I.G.’s assignment fromHitler in the pre-war period was to make Germany self-sufficient in rubber,gasoline, lubricating oils, magnesium, fibers, tanning agents, fats, andexplosives. To fulfil this critical assignment, vast sums were spent by I.G. onprocesses to extract these war materials from indigenous German raw materials —in particular the plentiful German coal resources. Where these processes couldnot be developed in Germany they were acquired from abroad under cartelarrangements. For example, the process for iso-octane, essential for aviationfuels, was obtained from the United States,, . . in fact entirely [from] the Americans and has become known to us in detailin its separate stages through our agreements with them [Standard Oil of NewJersey] and is being used very extensively by us.4 [bm06.html#ch2fn4]The process for manufacturing tetraethyl lead, essential for aviation gasoline,was obtained by I. G. Farben from the United States, and in 1939 I.G. was sold$20 million of high-grade aviation gasoline by Standard Oil of New Jersey. Evenbefore Germany manufactured tetraethyl lead by the American process it was ableto “borrow” 500 tons from the Ethyl Corporation. This loan of vital tetraethyllead was not repaid and I.G. forfeited the $1 million security. Further, I.G.purchased large stocks of magnesium from Dow Chemical for incendiary bombs andstockpiled explosives, stabilizers, phosphorus, and cyanides from the outsideworld.In 1939, out of 43 major products manufactured by I.G., 28 were of “primaryconcern” to the German armed forces. Farben’s ultimate control of the German wareconomy, acquired during the 1920s and 1930s with Wall Street assistance, canbest be assessed by examining the percentage of German war material outputproduced by Farben plants in 1943. Farben at that time produced 100 percent ofGerman synthetic rubber, 95 percent of German poison gas (including all theZyklon B gas used in the concentration camps), 90 percent of German plastics, 88percent of German magnesium, 84 percent of German explosives, 70 percent ofGerman gunpowder, 46 percent of German high octane (aviation) gasoline, and 33percent of German synthetic gasoline.5 [bm06.html#ch2fn5] (See Chart 2-1 andTable 2-1)Table 2-1: German Army (Wehrmacht) Dependence on I.G. Farben Production (1943):Product Total GermanProduction Percent Produced byI.G. Farben Synthetic Rubber 118,600 tons 100 Methanol 251,000 tons 100 Lubricating Oil 60,000 tons 100 Dyestuffs 31,670 tons 98 Poison Gas — 95 Nickel 2,000 tons 95 Plastics 57,000 tons 90 Magnesium 27,400 tons 88 Explosives 221,000tons 84 Gunpowder 210,000 tons 70 High Octane (Aviation)Gasoline 650,000 tons 46 Sulfuric Acid 707,000 tons 35Dr. von Schnitzler, of the I.G. Farben Aufsichsrat, made the following pertinentstatement in 1943:It is no exaggeration to say that without the services of German chemistryperformed under the Four Year Plan the prosecution of modern war would have beenunthinkable.6 [bm06.html#ch2fn6]Unfortunately, when we probe the technical origins of the more important ofthese military materials — quite apart from financial support for Hitler — wefind links to American industry and to American businessmen. There were numerousFarben arrangements with American firms, including cartel marketingarrangements, patent agreements, and technical exchanges as exemplified in theStandard Oil-Ethyl technology transfers mentioned above. These arrangements wereused by I.G. to advance Nazi policy abroad, to collect strategic information,and to consolidate a worldwide chemical cartel.One of the more horrifying aspects of I.G. Farben’s cartel was the invention,production, and distribution of the Zyklon B gas, used in Nazi concentrationcamps. Zyklon B was pure Prussic acid, a lethal poison produced by I.G. FarbenLeverkusen and sold from the Bayer sales office through Degesch, an independentlicence holder. Sales of Zyklon B amounted to almost three-quarters of Degeschbusiness; enough gas to kill 200 million humans was produced and sold by I.G.Farben. The Kilgore Committee report of 1942 makes it clear that the I.G. Farbendirectors had precise knowledge of the Nazi concentration camps and the use ofI.G. chemicals. This prior knowledge becomes significant when we later considerthe role of the American directors in I.G.’s American subsidiary. The 1945interrogation of I.G. Farben director von Schnitzler reads:Q.What did you do when they told you that I.G. chemicals was [sic] being used tokill, to murder people held in concentration camps? A.I was horrified. Q.Did youdo anything about it? A.I kept it for me [to myself] because it was tooterrible. ... I asked Muller-Cunradi is it known to you and Ambros and otherdirectors in Auschwitz that the gases and chemicals are being used to murderpeople Q.What did he say? A.Yes: it is known to all I.G. directors inAuschwitz.7 [bm06.html#ch2fn7]There was no attempt by I.G. Farben to halt production of the gases — a ratherineffective way for von Schnitzler to express any concern for human life,“because it was too terrible.”The Berlin N. W. 7 office of I.G. Farben was the key Nazi overseas espionagecentre. The unit operated under Farben director Max Ilgner, nephew of I.G.Farben president Hermann Schmitz. Max Ilgner and Hermann Schmitz were on theboard of American I.G, with fellow directors Henry Ford of Ford Motor Company,Paul Warburg of Bank of Manhattan, and Charles E. Mitchell of the FederalReserve Bank of New York.CHART 2-1: GERMAN ARMY DEPENDENCE ON I.G. FARBEN PRODUCTION (1943)image [images/pg38.jpg]Source: Elimination of German Resources,At the outbreak of war in 1939 VOWI employees were ordered into the Wehrmachtbut in fact continued to perform the same work as when nominally under I.G.Farben. One of the more prominent of these Farben intelligence workers in N.W. 7was Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, who joined Farben in the early 1930safter completion of an 18-month period of service in the black-uniformed S.S.8[bm06.html#ch2fn8]The U.S. arm of the VOWI intelligence network was Chemnyco, Inc. According tothe War Department,Utilizing normal business contacts Chemnyco was able to transmit to Germanytremendous amounts of material ranging from photographs and blueprints todetailed descriptions of whole industrial plants.9 [bm06.html#ch2fn9]Chemnyco’s vice president in New York was Rudolph Ilgner, an American citizenand brother of American I. G. Farben director Max Ilgner. In brief, Farbenoperated VOWI, the Nazi foreign intelligence operation, before World War II andthe VOWI operation was associated with prominent members of the Wall StreetEstablishment through American I.G. and Chemnyco.The U.S. War Department also accused I. G. Farben and its American associates ofspearheading Nazi psychological and economic warfare programmes throughdissemination of propaganda via Farben agents abroad, and of providing foreignexchange for this Nazi propaganda. Farben’s cartel arrangements promoted Nazieconomic warfare — the outstanding example being the voluntary Standard Oil ofNew Jersey restriction on development of synthetic rubber in the United Statesat the behest of I. G. Farben. As the War Department report puts it:The story in short is that because of Standard Oil’s determination to maintainan absolute monopoly of synthetic rubber developments in the United States, itfully accomplished I.G.’s purpose of preventing United States production bydissuading American rubber companies from undertaking independent research indeveloping synthetic rubber processes.10 [bm06.html#ch2fn10]In 1945 Dr. Oskar Loehr, deputy head of the I.G. “Tea Buro,” confirmed that I.G. Farben and Standard Oil of New Jersey operated a “preconceived plan” tosuppress development of the synthetic rubber industry in the United States, tothe advantage of the German Wehrmacht and to the disadvantage of the UnitedStates in World War II.Dr. Loehr’s testimony reads (in part) as follows:Q.Is it true that while the delay in divulging the buna [synthetic rubber]processes to American rubber companies was taking place, Chemnyco and Jasco werein the meantime keeping I.G. well informed in regard to synthetic rubberdevelopment in the U.S.? A.Yes. Q.So that at all times I.G. was fully aware ofthe state of the development of the American synthetic rubber industry? A.Yes.Q.Were you present at the Hague meeting when Mr. Howard [of Standard Oil] wentthere in 1939? A.No. Q.Who was present? A.Mr. Ringer, who was accompanied by Dr.Brown of Ludwigshafen. Q.Did they tell you about the negotiations? A.Yes, as faras they were on the buna part of it. Q.Is it true that Mr. Howard told I.G. atthis meeting that the developments in the U.S. had reached such a stage that itwould no longer be possible for him to keep the information in regard to thebuna processes from the American companies? A.Mr. Ringer reported it. Q.Was itat that meeting that for the first time Mr. Howard told I.G. the American rubbercompanies might have to be informed of the processes and he assured I.G. thatStandard Oil would control the synthetic rubber industry in the U.S.? Is thatright? A.That is right. That is the knowledge I got through Mr. Ringer. Q.Sothat in all these arrangements since the beginning of the development of thesynthetic rubber industry the suppression of the synthetic rubber industry inthe U.S. was part of a preconceived plan between I.G. on the one hand and Mr.Howard of Standard Oil on the other? A.That is a conclusion that must be drawnfrom the previous facts.11 [bm06.html#ch2fn11]I. G. Farben was pre-war Germany’s largest earner of foreign exchange, and thisforeign exchange enabled Germany to purchase strategic raw materials, militaryequipment, and technical processes, and to finance its overseas programmes ofespionage, propaganda, and varied military and political activities precedingWorld War II. Acting on behalf of the Nazi state, Farben broadened its ownhorizon to a world scale which maintained close relations with the Nazi regimeand the Wehrmacht. A liaison office, the Vermittlungsstelle W, was establishedto maintain communications between I.G. Farben and the German Ministry of War:The aim of this work is the building up of a tight organization for armament inthe I.G. which could be inserted without difficulty in the existing organizationof the I.G. and the individual plants. In the case of war, I.G. will be treatedby the authorities concerned with armament questions as one big plant which, inits task for the armament, as far as it is possible to do so from the technicalpoint of view, will regulate itself without any organizational influence fromoutside (the work in this direction was in principle agreed upon with theMinistry of War Wehrwirtschaftsant) and from this office with the Ministry ofEconomy. To the field of the work of the Vermittlungsstelle W belongs, besidesthe organizational set-up and long-range planning, the continuous collaborationwith regard to the armament and technical questions with the authorities of theReich and with the plants of the I.G.12 [bm06.html#ch2fn12]Unfortunately the files of the Vermittlungsstelle offices were destroyed priorto the end of the war, although it is known from other sources that from 1934onwards a complex network of transactions evolved between I.G. and theWehrmacht. In 1934 I. G. Farben began to mobilize for war, and each I.G. plantprepared its war production plans and submitted the plans to the Ministries ofWar and Economics. By 1935-6 war games were being held at I. G. Farben plantsand wartime technical procedures rehearsed.13 [bm06.html#ch2fn13] These wargames were described by Dr. Struss, head of the Secretariat of I.G.’s TechnicalCommittee:It is true that since 1934 or 1935, soon after the establishment of theVermittlungsstelle W in the different works, theoretical war plant games hadbeen arranged to examine how the effect of bombing on certain factories wouldmaterialize. It was particularly taken into consideration what would happen if100- or 500-kilogram bombs would fall on a certain factory and what would be theresult of it. It is also right that the word Kriegsspiele was used for it.The Kriegsspiele were prepared by Mr. Ritter and Dr. Eckell, later on partly byDr. von Brunning by personal order on Dr. Krauch’s own initiative or by order ofthe Air Force, it is not known to me. The tasks were partly given by theVermittlungsstelle W and partly by officers of the Air Force. A number ofofficers of all groups of the Wehrmacht (Navy, Air Force, and Army) participatedin these Kriegsspiele.The places which were hit by bombs were marked in a map of the plant so that itcould be ascertained which parts of the plant were damaged, for example a gasmeter or an important pipe line. As soon as the raid finished, the management ofthe plant ascertained the damages and reported which part of the plant had tostop working; they further reported what time would be required in order torepair the damages. In a following meeting the consequences of the Kriegsspielewere described and it was ascertained that in the case of Leuna [plant] thedamages involved were considerably high; especially it was found out thatalterations of the pipe lines were to be made at considerable cost.14[bm06.html#ch2fn14]Consequently, throughout the 1930s I. G. Farben did more than just comply withorders from the Nazi regime. Farben was an initiator and operator for the Naziplans for world conquest. Farben acted as a research and intelligenceorganization for the German Army and voluntarily initiated Wehrmacht projects.In fact the Army only rarely had to approach Farben; it is estimated that about40 to 50 percent of Farben projects for the Army were initiated by Farbenitself. In brief, in the words of Dr. von Schnitzler:Thus, in acting as it had done, I.G. contracted a great responsibility andconstituted a substantial aid in the chemical domain and decisive help to Hitlers foreign policy, which led to war and to the ruin of Germany. Thus, I mustconclude that I.G. is largely responsible for Hitler’s policy.Polishing I. G. Farben’s Public ImageThis miserable picture of pre-war military preparation was known abroad and hadto be sold — or disguised — to the American public in order to facilitate WallStreet fund-raising and technical assistance on behalf of I. G Farben in theUnited States. A prominent New York public relations firm was chosen for the jobof selling the I.G. Farben combine to America. The most notable public relationsfirm in the late 1920s and 1930s was Ivy Lee & T.J. Ross of New York. Ivy Leehad previously undertaken a public relations campaign for the Rockefellers, tospruce up the Rockefeller name among the American public. The firm had alsoproduced a syncophantic book entitled USSR, undertaking the same clean-up taskfor the Soviet Union — even while Soviet labour camps were in full blast in thelate 20s and early 30s.From 1929 onwards Ivy Lee became public relations counsel for I. G. Farben inthe United States. In 1934 Ivy Lee presented testimony to the House Un-AmericanActivities Committee on this work for Farben.15 [bm06.html#ch2fn15] Leetestified that I.G. Farben was affiliated with the American Farben firm and “TheAmerican I.G. is a holding company with directors such people as Edsel Ford,Walter Teagle, one of the officers of the City Bank . . . .” Lee explained thathe was paid $25,000 per year under a contract made with Max Ilgner of I.G.Farben. His job was to counter criticism levelled at I.G. Farben within theUnited States. The advice given by Ivy Lee to Farben on this problem wasacceptable enough:In the first place, I have told them that they could never in the world get theAmerican people reconciled to their treatment of the Jews: that that was justforeign to the American mentality and could never be justified in the Americanpublic opinion, and there was no use trying.In the second place, anything that savored of Nazi propaganda in this countrywas a mistake and ought not to be undertaken. Our people regard it as meddlingwith American affairs, and it was bad business.16 [bm06.html#ch2fn16]The initial payment of $4,500 to Ivy Lee under this contract was made by HermannSchmitz, chairman of I.G. Farben in Germany! It was deposited in the New YorkTrust Company under the name of I. G Chemie (or the “Swiss I.G,” as Ivy Leetermed it). However, the second and major payment of $14,450 was made by Williamvon Rath of the American I.G. and also deposited by Ivy Lee in New York TrustCompany, for the credit of his personal account. (The firm account was at theChase Bank.) This point about the origin of the funds is important when weconsider the identity of directors of American I.G., because payment by AmericanI.G. meant that the bulk of the Nazi propaganda funds were not of German origin.They were American funds earned in the U.S. and under control of Americandirectors, although used for Nazi propaganda in the United States.In other words, most of the Nazi propaganda funds handled by Ivy Lee were notimported from Germany,The use to which these American funds were put was brought out under questioningby the House Un-American Activities Committee:Mr. DICKSTEIN. As I understand you, you testified that you received nopropaganda at all, and that you had nothing to do with the distribution ofpropaganda in this country?Mr. LEE. I did not testify I received none Mr. Dickstein.Mr. DICKSTEIN. I will eliminate that part of the question, then.Mr. LEE. I testified that I disseminated none whatever.Mr. DICKSTEIN. Have you received or has your firm received any propagandaliterature from Germany at any time?Mr. LEE. Yes, sir.Mr. DICKSTEIN. And when was that?Mr. LEE. Oh, we have received — it is a question of what you call propaganda. Wehave received an immense amount of literature.Mr. DICKSTEIN. You do not know what that literature was and what it contained?Mr. LEE. We have received books and pamphlets and newspaper clippings anddocuments, world without end.Mr. DICKSTEIN. I assume someone in your office would go over them and see whatthey were?Mr. LEE. Yes, sir.Mr. DICKSTEIN. And then after you found out what they were, I assume you keptcopies of them?Mr. LEE. In some cases, yes: and in some, no. A great many of them, of course,were in German, and I had what my son sent me. He said they were interesting andsignificant, and those I had translated or excerpts of them made.17[bm06.html#ch2fn17]Finally, Ivy Lee employed Burnham Carter to study American newspaper reports onGermany and prepare suitable pro-Nazi replies. It should be noted that thisGerman literature was not Farben literature, it was official Hitler literature:Mr. DICKSTEIN. In other words, you receive this material that deals with Germanconditions today. You examine it and you advise them. It has nothing to do withthe German Government, although the material, the literature, is officialliterature of the Hitler regime. That is correct, is it not?Mr. LEE. Well, a good deal of the literature was not official.Mr. DICKSTEIN. It was not I.G. literature, was it?Mr. LEE. No; I.G. sent it to me.Mr. DICKSTEIN. Can you show us one scrap of paper that came in here that hadanything to do with the I.G.?Mr. LEE. Oh, yes. They issue a good deal of literature. But I do not want to begthe question. There is no question whatever that under their authority I havereceived an immense amount of material that came from official and unofficialsources.Mr. DICKSTEIN. Exactly. In other words, the material that was sent here by theI.G. was material spread — we would call it propaganda — by authority of theGerman Government. But the distinction that you make in your statement is, as Itake it, that the German Government did not send it to you directly; that it wassent to you by the I.G.Mr. LEE. Right.Mr. DICKSTEIN. And it had nothing to do with their business relations just now.Mr. LEE. That is correct.18 [bm06.html#ch2fn18]The American I.G. FarbenWho were the prominent Wall Street establishment financiers who directed theactivities of American I.G, the I.G. Farben affiliate in the United Statespromoting Nazi propaganda?American I.G. Farben directors included some of the more prominent members ofWall Street. German interests re-entered the United States after World War I,and successfully overcame barriers designed to keep I.G. out of the Americanmarket. Neither seizure of German patents, establishment of the ChemicalFoundation, nor high tariff walls were a major problem,By 1925, General Dyestuff Corporation was established as the exclusive sellingagent for products manufactured by Gasselli Dyestuff (renamed General AnilineWorks, Inc., in 1929) and imported from Germany. The stock of General AnilineWorks was transferred in 1929 to American I.G. Chemical Corporation and later in1939 to General Aniline & Film Corporation, into which American I.G. and GeneralAniline Works were merged. American I.G. and its successor, General Aniline &Film, is the unit through which control of I.G.’s enterprises in the U.S. wasmaintained. The stock authorization of American I.G. was 3,000,000 common Ashares and 3,000,000 common B shares. In return for stock interests in GeneralAniline Works and Agfa-Ansco Corporation, I.G. Farben in Germany received allthe B shares and 400,000 A shares. Thirty million dollars of convertible bondswere sold to the American public and guaranteed as to principal and interest bythe German I.G. Farben, which received an option to purchase an additional1,000,000 A shares.Table 2-2: The Directors of American I.G. at 1930:American I.G.

Farben at this period,The management of American I.G. (later General Aniline) was dominated by I.G. orformer I.G. officials. (See Table 2-2.) Hermann Schmitz served as president from1929 to 1936 and was then succeeded by his brother, Dietrich A. Schmitz, anaturalized American citizen, until 1941. Hermann Schmitz, who was also adirector of the Bank for International Settlements, the “apex” of theinternational financial control system. He remained as chairman of the board ofdirectors from 1936 to 1939.The original board of directors included nine members who were, or had been,members of the board of I.G. Farben in Germany (Hermann Schmitz, Carl Bosch, MaxIlgner, Fritz ter Meer, and Wilfred Grief), or had been previously employed byI.G. Farben in Germany (Walter Duisberg, Adolph Kuttroff, W.H. von Rath, HermanA. Metz). Herman A. Metz was an American citizen, a staunch Democrat in politicsand a former comptroller of the City of New York. A tenth, W.E. Weiss, had beenunder contract to I.G.image [images/pg47.jpg]The remaining four members of the American I.G. board were prominent Americancitizens and members of the Wall Street financial elite: C.E. Mitchell, chairmanof National City Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Edsel B. Ford,president of Ford Motor Company; W.C. Teagle, another director of Standard Oilof New Jersey; and, Paul Warburg, first member of the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York and chairman of the Bank of Manhattan Company.Directors of American I.G. were not only prominent in Wall Street and Americanindustry but more significantly were drawn from a few highly influentialinstitutions. (See chart above.)Between 1929 and 1939 there were changes in the make-up of the board of AmericanI.G. The number of directors varied from time to time, although a majorityalways had I.G. backgrounds or connections, and the board never had less thanfour American directors. In 1939 — presumably looking ahead to World War II — aneffort was made to give the board a more American complexion, but despite theresignation of Hermann Schmitz, Carl Bosch, and Walter Duisberg, and theappointment of seven new directors, seven members still belonged to the I.G.group. This I.G. predominance increased during 1940 and 1941 as Americandirectors, including Edsel Ford, realized the political unhealthiness of I.G.and resigned,Several basic observations can be made from this evidence. First, the board ofAmerican I.G. had three directors from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, themost influential of the various Federal Reserve Banks. American I.G. also hadinterlocks with Standard Oil of New Jersey, Ford Motor Company, Bank ofManhattan (later to become the Chase Manhattan), and A.E.G. (German GeneralElectric). Second, three members of the board of this American I.G. were foundguilty at Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. These were the German, not the American,members. Among these Germans was Max Ilgner, director of the I.G. Farben N. W. 7office in Berlin, i.e., the Nazi pre-war intelligence office. If the directorsof a corporation are collectively responsible for the activities of thecorporation, then the American directors should also have been placed on trialat Nuremberg, along with the German directors — that is, if the purpose of thetrials was to determine war guilt. Of course, if the purpose of the trials hadbeen to divert attention away from the U.S, involvement in Hitler’s rise topower, they succeeded very well in such an objective."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEGeneral Electric Funds HitlerAmong the early Roosevelt fascist measures was the National Industry RecoveryAct (NRA) of June 16, 1933. The origins of this scheme are worth repeating.These ideas were first suggested by Gerard Swope of the General Electric Company. . . following this they were adopted by the United States Chamber of Commerce. . . .(Herbert Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Great Depression,1929-1941, New York: The Macmillan Company, 1952, p. 420)The multinational giant General Electric has an unparalleled role intwentieth-century history. The General Electric Company electrified the SovietUnion in the 1920s and 1930s, and fulfilled for the Soviets Lenin’s dictum that“Socialism = electrification.”1 [bm06.html#ch3fn1] The Swope Plan, created byGeneral Electric’s one-time president Gerard Swope, became Franklin D.Roosevelt’s New Deal, by a process deplored by one-time President Herbert Hooverand described in Wall Street and FDR.2 [bm06.html#ch3fn2] There was along-lasting, intimate relationship between Swope and Young of General ElectricCompany and the Roosevelt family, as there was between General Electric and theSoviet Union. In 1936 Senator James A. Reed of Missouri, an early Rooseveltsupporter, became aware of Roosevelt’s betrayal of liberal ideas and attackedthe Roosevelt New Deal programme as a “tyrannical” measure “leading todespotism, [and] sought by its sponsors under the communistic cry of ‘SocialJustice.’ ” Senator Reed further charged on the floor of the Senate thatFranklin D. Roosevelt was a “hired man for the economic royalists” in WallStreet and that the Roosevelt family “is one of the largest stockholders in theGeneral Electric Company.”3 [bm06.html#ch3fn3]As we probe into behind-the-scenes German interwar history and the story ofHitler and Naziism, we find both Owen D. Young and Gerard Swope of GeneralElectric tied to the rise of Hitlerism and the suppression of German democracy.That General Electric directors are to be found in each of these three distincthistorical categories—i.e., the development of the Soviet Union, the creation ofRoosevelt’s New Deal, and the rise of Hitlerism—suggests how elements of BigBusiness are keenly interested in the socialization of the world, for their ownpurposes and objectives, rather than the maintenance of the impartialmarketplace in a free society.4 [bm06.html#ch3fn4] General Electric profitedhandsomely from Bolshevism, from Roosevelt’s New Deal socialism, and, as weshall see below, from national socialism in Hitler’s Germany.General Electric in Weimar GermanyWalter Rathenau was, until his assassination in 1922, managing director ofAllgemeine Elekrizitats Gesellschaft (A.E.G.), or German General Electric, andlike Owen Young and Gerard Swope, his counterparts in the U.S., he was aprominent advocate of corporate socialism. Walter Rathenau spoke out publiclyagainst competition and free enterprise. Why? Because both Rathanau and Swopewanted the protection and cooperation of the state for their own corporateobjectives and profit. (But not of course for anybody else’s objectives andprofits.) Rathanau expressed their plea in The New Political Economy:The new economy will, as we have seen, be no state or governmental economy but aprivate economy committed to a civic power of resolution which certainly willrequire state cooperation for organic consolidation to overcome inner frictionand increase production and endurance.5 [bm06.html#ch3fn5]When we disentangle the turgid Rathenau prose, this means that the power of theState was to be made available to private firms for their own corporatepurposes, i.e., what is popularly known as national socialism. Rathenau spokeout publicly against competition and “free enterprise, inheritance.”6[bm06.html#ch3fn6] Not their own wealth, so far as can be determined, but thewealth of others who lacked political pull in the State apparatus.Owen D. Young of General Electric was one of the three U.S. delegates to the1923 Dawes Plan meeting which established the German reparations programme. Andin the Dawes and Young Plans we can see how some private firms were able tobenefit from the power of the State. The largest single loans from Wall Streetto Germany during the 1920s were reparations loans; it was ultimately the U.S.investor who paid for German reparations. The cartelization of the Germanelectrical industry under A.E.G. (as well as the steel and chemical industriesdiscussed in Chapters One and Two) was made possible with these Wall Streetloans:Date of OfferingBorrowerManaging Bank in the U.S.Face Amount of Issue Jan. 26,1925Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft(A.E.G.)National City Co.$10,000,000Dec. 9, 1925Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft A.E.G.)National CityCo.10,000,000 May 22, 1928Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft(A.E.G)NationalCity Co.10,000,000 June 7, 1928AllgemeineElektrizitäts-Gesellschaft(A.E.G)National City Co.5,000,000In 1928, at the Young Plan reparations meetings, we find General Electricpresident Owen D. Young in the chair as the chief U.S. delegate, appointed bythe U.S. government to use U.S. government power and prestige to decideinternational financial matters enhancing Wall Street and General Electricprofits. In 1930 Owen D. Young, after whom the Young Plan for German reparationswas named, became chairman of the Board of General Electric Company in New YorkCity. Young was also chairman of the Executive Committee of Radio Corporation ofAmerica and a director of both German General Electric (A.E.G.) and Osram inGermany. Young also served on the boards of other major U.S. corporations,including General Motors, NBC, and RKO; he was a councillor of the NationalIndustrial Conference Board, a director of the International Chamber ofCommerce, and deputy chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork.Gerard Swope was president and director of General Electric Company as well asFrench and German associated companies, including A.E.G. and Osram in Germany.Swope was also a director of RCA, NBC, and the National City Bank of New York.Other directors of International General Electric at this time reflect Morgancontrol of the company, and both Young and Swope were generally known as theMorgan representatives on the G. E. board, which included Thomas Cochran,another partner in the J. P. Morgan firm. General Electric director Clark HaynesMinor was president of International General Electric in the 1920s. Anotherdirector was Victor M. Cutter of the First National Bank of Boston and a figurein the “Banana Revolutions” in Central America.In the late 1920s Young, Swope, and Minor of International General Electricmoved into the German electrical industry and gained, if not control as somehave reported, then at least a substantial say in the internal affairs of bothA.E.G. and Osram. In July 1929 an agreement was reached between General Electricand three German firms — A.E.G., Siemens & Halske, and Koppel and Company —which between them owned all the shares in Osram, the electric bulbmanufacturer. General Electric purchased 16% percent of Osram stock and reacheda joint agreement for international control of electric bulbs production andmarketing. Clark Minor and Gerard Swope became directors of Osram.7[bm06.html#ch3fn7]In July 1929 great interest was shown in rumours circulating in German financialcircles that General Electric was also buying into A.E.G. and that talks to thisend were in progress between A.E.G. and G.E.8 [bm06.html#ch3fn8] In August itwas confirmed that 14 million marks of common A.E.G. stock were to be issued toGeneral Electric. These shares, added to shares bought on the open market, gaveGeneral Electric a 25-percent interest in A.E.G. A closer working agreement wassigned between the two companies, providing the German company U.S. technologyand patents. It was emphasized in the news reports that A.E.G. would not haveparticipation in G.E., but that on the other hand G.E. would finance expansionof A.E.G. in Germany.9 [bm06.html#ch3fn9] The German financial press also notedthat there was no A.E.G. representation on the board of G.E. in the UnitedStates but that five Americans were now on the board of A.E.G. The VossischeZeitung recorded,The American electrical industry has conquered the world, and only a few of theremaining opposing bastions have been able to withstand the onslaught. . . .10[bm06.html#ch3fn10]By 1930, unknown to the German financial press, General Electric had similarlygained an effective technical monopoly of the Soviet electrical industry and wassoon to penetrate even the remaining bastions in Germany, particularly theSiemens group. In January 1930 three G.E. men were elected to the board ofA.E.G. — Clark H. Minor, Gerard Swope, and E. H. Baldwin — and InternationalGeneral Electric (I.G.E.) continued its moves to merge the world electricalindustry into a giant cartel under Wall Street control.In February General Electric focused on the remaining German electrical giant,Siemens & Halske, and while able to obtain a large block of debentures issued onbehalf of the German firm by Dillon, Read of New York, G. E. was not able togain participation or directors on the Siemens board. While the German pressrecognized even this limited control as “an historical economic event of thefirst order and an important step toward a future world electric trust,”11[bm06.html#ch3fn11] Siemens retained its independence from General Electric —and this independence is important for our story. The New York Times reported,The entire press emphasizes the fact that Siemens, contrary to A.E.G., maintainsits independence for the future and points out that no General Electricrepresentative will sit on Siemens board of directors.12 [bm06.html#ch3fn12]There is no evidence that Siemens, either through Siemens & Halske orSiemens-Schukert, participated directly in the financing of Hitler. Siemenscontributed to Hitler only slightly and indirectly through a share participationin Osram. On the other hand, both A.E.G. and Osram directly financed Hitlerthrough the Nationale Treuhand in substantial ways. Siemens retained itsindependence in the early 1930s while both A.E.G. and Osram were under Americandominance and with American directors. There is no evidence that Siemens,without American directors, financed Hitler. On the other hand, we haveirrefutable documentary evidence (see document No. 391–395) that both GermanGeneral Electric and Osram, both with American directors, financed Hitler.In the months following the attempted Wall Street take over of Siemens, thepattern of a developing world trust in the electrical industry clarified; therewas an end to international patent fights and the G.E. interest in A.E.G.increased to nearly 30 percent.13 [bm06.html#ch3fn13]Consequently, in the early 1930s, as Hitler prepared to grab dictatorial powerin Germany—backed by some, but by no means all, German and Americanindustrialists—the German General Electric (A.E.G.) was owned by InternationalGeneral Electric (about 30 percent), the Gesellschaft für ElectrischeUnternemungen (25 percent), and Ludwig Lowe (25 percent). International GeneralElectric also had an interest of about 16 2/3rds percent in Osram, and anadditional indirect influence inCompanies Linked to German General Electric through Common Directors:Directorsof German General Electric (A.E.G.)Relationship of Linked Firm with Financing ofHitler: Accumulatoran-FabrikQuandtPfefferDirect Finance OsramMamrothPferlsDirect Finance Deutschen Babcock-WilcoxLandauNot known VereinigteStahlwerkeWolffDirect Finance Nathan Kirdorf Goldschmidt KruppNathanKlotzbachDirect Finance I.G.

On the board of A.E.G., apart from the fourAmerican directors (Young, Swope, Minor, and Baldwin), we find Pferdmenges ofOppenheim & Co. (another Hitler financier), and Quandt, who owned 75 percent ofAccumlatoren-Fabrik, a major direct financier of Hitler. In other words, amongthe German board members of A.E.G. we find representatives from several of theGerman firms that financed Hitler in the 1920s and 1930s.General Electric and the Financing of HitlerThe tap root of modern corporate socialism runs deep into the management of twoaffiliated multinational corporations: General Electric Company in the UnitedStates and its foreign associates, including German General Electric (A.E.G.),and Osram in Germany. We have noted that Gerard Swope, second president andchairman of General Electric, and Walter Rathanau of A.E.G. promoted radicalideas for control of the State by private business interests,From 1915 onwards International General Electric (I.G.E.), located at 120Broadway in New York City, acted as the foreign investment, manufacturing, andselling organization for the General Electric Company. I.G.E. held interests inoverseas manufacturing companies including a 25 to 30-percent holding in GermanGeneral Electric (A.E.G.), plus holdings in Osram G.m.b.H.Kommanditgesellschaft, also in Berlin. These holdings gave International GeneralElectric four directors on the board of A.E.G, and another director at Osram,and significant influence in the internal domestic policies of these Germancompanies. The significance of this General Electric ownership is that A.E.G.and Osram were prominent suppliers of funds for Hitler in his rise to power inGermany in 1933. A bank transfer slip dated March 2, 1933 from A.E.G. toDelbrück Schickler & Co. in Berlin requests that 60,000 Reichsmark be depositedin the “Nationale Treuhand” (National Trusteeship) account for Hitler’s use.This slip is reproduced below.I.G. Farben was the most important of the domestic financial backers of Hitler,and (as noted elsewhere) I.G. Farben controlled American I.G. Moreover, severaldirectors of A.E.G. were also on the board of I.G. Farben—i.e., Hermann Bucher,chairman of A.E.G. was on the I.G. Farben board; so were A.E.G. directors JuliusFlechtheim and Walter von Rath. I.G. Farben contributed 30 percent of the 1933Hitler National Trusteeship (or takeover) fund.image [images/pg56.jpg]Source: Nuremberg Military Tribunal, document No. 391-395.Walter Fahrenhorst of A.E.G. was also on the board of Phoenix A-G, Thyssen A-Gand Demag A-G — and all were contributors to Hitler’s fund. Demag A-Gcontributed 50,000 RM to Hitler’s fund and had a director with A.E.G. — thenotorious Friedrich Flick, and early Hitler supporter, who was later convictedat the Nuremberg Trials. Accumulatoren Fabrik A-G was a Hitler contributor(25,000 RM) with two directors on the A.E.G. board, August Pfeffer and GuntherQuandt. Quandt personally owned 75 percent of Accumulatoren Fabrik.Osram Gesellschaft, in which International General Electric had a 16 2/3rdsdirect interest, also had two directors on the A.E.G. board: Paul Mamroth andHeinrich Pferls. Osram contributed 40,000 RM directly to the Hitler fund. TheOtto Wolff concern, Vereinigte Stahlwerke A-G, recipient of substantial New Yorkloans in the 1920s, had three directors on the A.E.G. board: Otto Wolff, HenryNathan and Jakob Goldschmidt, Alfred Krupp von Bohlen, sole owner of the Krupporganization and an early supporter of Hitler, was a member of the Aufsichsratof A.E.G. Robert Pferdmenges, a member of Himmler’s Circle of Friends, was alsoa director of A.E.G.In other words, almost all of the German directors of German General Electricwere financial supporters of Hitler and associated not only with A.E.G. but withother companies financing Hitler.Walter Rathenau14 [bm06.html#ch3fn14] became a director of A.E.G. in 1899 and bythe early twentieth century was a director of more than 100 corporations.Rathenau was also author of the “Rathenau Plan,” which bears a remarkableresemblance to the “Swope Plan” — i.e., FDR’s New Deal but written by Swope ofG.E. In other words, we have the extraordinary coincidence that the authors ofNew Deal-like plans in the U.S. and Germany were also prime backers of theirimplementers: Hitler in Germany and Roosevelt in the U.S.Swope was chairman of the board of General Electric Company and InternationalGeneral Electric. In 1932 the American directors of A.E.G. were prominentlyconnected with American banking and political circles as follows:GERARD SWOPEChairman of International General Electric and president of GeneralElectric Company, director of National City Bank (and other companies), directorof A.E.G. and Osram in Germany. Author of FDR’s New Deal and member of numerousRoosevelt organizations. OWEN D. YOUNGChairman of board of General Electric,and deputy chairman, Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Author, with J. P.Morgan, of the Young Plan which superseded the Dawes Plan in 1929. (See ChapterOne.) CLARK H. MINORPresident and director of International General Electric,director of British Thomson Houston, Compania Generale di Electtricita (Italy),and Japan Electric Bond & Share Company (Japan). image [images/pg58.jpg]In brief, we have hard evidence of unquestioned authenticity (see previousdocument) to show that German General Electric contributed substantial sums toHitler’s political fund. There were four American directors of A.E.G. (Baldwin,Swope, Minor, and Clark), which was 30 percent owned by International GeneralElectric. Further, I.G.E. and the four American directors were the largestsingle interest and consequently had the greatest single influence in A.E.G.actions and policies. Even further, almost all other directors of A.E.G. wereconnected with firms (I. G. Farben, Accumulatoren Fabrik, etc.) whichcontributed directly — as firms — to Hitler’s political fund. However, only theGerman directors of A.E.G. were placed on trial in Nuremberg in 1945.Technical Cooperation with KruppQuite apart from financial assistance to Hitler, General Electric extended itsassistance to cartel schemes with other Hitler backers for their mutual benefitand the benefit of the Nazi state. Cemented tungsten carbide is one example ofthis G.E.-Nazi cooperation. Prior to November 1928, American industries hadseveral sources for both tungsten carbide and tools and dies containing thishard-metal composition. Among these sources were the Krupp Company of Essen,Germany, and two American firms to which Krupp was then shipping and selling,the Union Wire Die Corporation and Thomas Prosser & Son. In 1928 Krupp obligateditself to grant licences under United States patents which it owned to theFirth-Sterling Steel Company and to the Ludlum Steel Company. Before 1928, thistungsten carbide for use in tools and dies sold in the United states for about$50 a pound.image [images/pg60.jpg]Source: Nuremberg Military Tribunal, document NI-391-395.The United States patents which Krupp claimed to own were assigned from OsramKommanditgesellschaft, and had been previously assigned by the Osram Company ofGermany to General Electric. However, General Electric had also developed itsown patents, principally the Hoyt and Gilson patents, covering competingprocesses for cemented tungsten carbide. General Electric believed that it couldutilize these patents independently without infringing on or competing withKrupp patents. But instead of using the G.E. patents independently incompetition with Krupp, or testing out its rights under the patent laws, GeneralElectric worked out a cartel agreement with Krupp to pool the patents of bothparties and to give General Electric a monopoly control of tungsten carbide inthe United States.The first step in this cartel arrangement was taken by Carboloy Company, Inc., aGeneral Electric subsidiary, incorporated for the purpose of exploiting tungstencarbide. The 1920s price of around $50 a pound was raised by Carboloy to $453 apound. Obviously, no firm could sell any great amounts of tungsten carbide inthis price range, but the price would maximize profits for G.E. In 1934 GeneralElectric and Carboloy were also able to obtain, by purchase, the licence grantedby Krupp to the Ludlum Steel Company, thereby eliminating one competitor. In1936, Krupp was induced to refrain from further imports into the United States.Part of the price paid for the elimination from the American market of tungstencarbide manufactured abroad was a reciprocal undertaking that General Electricand Carboloy would not export from the U.S. Thus these American companies tiedtheir own hands by contract, or permitted Krupp to tie their hands, and deniedforeign markets to American industry. Carboloy Company then acquired thebusiness of Thomas Prosser & Son, and in 1937, for nearly $1 million, Carboloyacquired the competing business of the Union Wire Die Corporation. By refusingto sell, Krupp cooperated with General Electric and Carboloy to persuade UnionWire Die Corporation to sell out.Licences to manufacture tungsten carbide were then refused. A request forlicence by the Crucible Steel Company was refused in 1936. A request by theChrysler Corporation for a licence was refused in 1938. A licence by theTriplett Electrical Instrument Company was refused on April 25, 1940. A licencewas also refused to the General Cable Company. The Ford Motor Company forseveral years expressed strong opposition to the high-price policy followed bythe Carboloy Company, and at one point made a request for the right tomanufacture for its own use. This was refused. As a result of these tactics,General Electric and its subsidiary Carboloy emerged in 1936 or 1937 withvirtually a complete monopoly of tungsten carbide in the United States.In brief, General Electric — with the cooperation of another Hitler supporter,Krupp — jointly obtained for G.E. a monopoly in the U.S. for tungsten carbide.So when World War II began, General Electric had a monopoly at an establishedprice of $450 a pound — almost ten times more than the 1928 price — and use inthe U.S. had been correspondingly restricted.A.E.G. Avoids the Bombs in World War IIBy 1939 the German electrical industry had become closely affiliated with twoU.S. firms: International General Electric and International Telephone andTelegraph. The largest firms in German electrical production and theiraffiliations listed in order of importance were:Firm and Typeof ProductionPercent of German1939 productionU.S. AffiliatedFirm Heavy Current Industry General Electric (A.E.G.)40 percentInternationalGeneral Electric Siemens Schukert A.G.40 percentNone Brown Boveri et Cie17percentNone Telephone and Telegraph Siemens und Halske60 percentNone Lorenz AG35percentI.T.T.

This industrial complex wasnever a prime target for bombing in World War II. The A.E.G. and I.T.T. plantswere hit only incidentally in area raids and then but rarely. The electricalequipment plants bombed as targets were not those affiliated with U.S. firms. Itwas Brown Boveri at Mannheim and Siemensstadt in Berlin — which were notconnected with the U.S. — who were bombed. As a result, German production ofelectrical war equipment rose steadily throughout World War II, peaking as lateas 1944. According to the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey reports, “In the opinionof Speers’ assistants and plant officials, the war effort in Germany was neverhindered in any important manner by any shortage of electrical equipment.”15[bm06.html#ch3fn15]One example of the non-bombing policy for German General Electric was the A.E.G.plant at 135 Muggenhofer Strasse, Nuremberg. Study of this plant’s output inWorld War II is of interest because it illustrates the extent to which purelypeacetime production was converted to war work. The pre-war plant manufacturedhousehold equipment, such as hot plates, electric ranges, electric irons,toasters, industrial baking ovens, radiators, water heaters, kitchen ovens, andindustrial heaters. In 1939, 1940 and 1941, most of the Nuremberg plant’sproduction facilities were used for the manufacture of peacetime products. In1942 the plant’s production was shifted to manufacture of war equipment. Metalparts for communications equipment and munitions such as bombs and mines weremade. Other war production consisted of parts for searchlights and amplifiers.The following tabulation very strikingly shows the conversion to war work:Year Total sales in 1000 RM Percent for war Percent ordinary production1939 12,469 5 95 1940 11,754 15 85 1941 21,194 40 60 1942 20,689 61 391943 31,455 67 33 1944 31,205 69 31image [images/pg64.jpg]Source: Nuremberg Military Tribunal, document No. NI-391-395.The actual physical damage by bombing to this plant was insignificant. Noserious damage occurred until the raids of February 20 and 21, 1945, near theend of the war, and then protection had been fairly well developed. Raids duringwhich bombs struck in the plant area and the trifling damage done are listed asfollows:Date of raidBombs striking plantDamage done March 8, 194330 stick type I.B.Trifling, but 3 storehouses outside the main plant destroyed.

Galbraith and such Wall Streeters as George W. Balland Paul H. Nitze. Their “German Electrical Equipment Industry Report” datedJanuary 1947 concludes:The industry has never been attacked as a basic target system, but a few plants,i.e. Brown Boveri at Mannheim, Bosch at Stuutgart and Siemenstadt in Berlin,have been subjected to precision raids; many others were hit in area raids.17[bm06.html#ch3fn17]At the end of World War II an Allied investigation team known as FIAT was sentto examine bomb damage to German electrical industry plants. The team for theelectrical industry consisted of Alexander G.P.E. Sanders of InternationalTelephone and Telegraph of New York, Whitworth Ferguson of Ferguson ElectricCompany, New York, and Erich J. Borgman of Westinghouse Electric. Although thestated objective of these teams was to examine the effects on Allied bombing ofGerman targets, the objective of this particular team was to get the Germanelectrical equipment industry back into production as soon as possible.Whitworth Ferguson wrote a report dated March 31, 1945 on the A.E.G.Ostlandwerke and concluded, “this plant is immediately available for productionof fine metal parts and assemblies.”18 [bm06.html#ch3fn18]To conclude, we find that both Rathenau of A.E.G. and Swope of General Electricin the U.S. had similar ideas of putting the State to work for their owncorporate ends. General Electric was prominent in financing Hitler, it profitedhandsomely from war production — and yet it managed to evade bombing in WorldWar II. Obviously the story briefly surveyed here deserves a much more thorough— and official — investigation."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURStandard Oil Fuels World War IIIn two years Germany will be manufacturing oil and gas enough out of soft coalfor a long war. The Standard Oil of New York is furnishing millions of dollarsto help. (Report from the Commercial Attaché, U.S. Embassy in Berlin, Germany,January 1933, to State Department in Washington, D.C.)The Standard Oil group of companies, in which the Rockefeller family owned aone-quarter (and controlling) interest,1 [bm06.html#ch4fn1] was of criticalassistance in helping Nazi Germany prepare for World War II. This assistance inmilitary preparation came about because Germany’s relatively insignificantsupplies of crude petroleum were quite insufficient for modern mechanizedwarfare; in 1934 for instance about 85 percent of German finished petroleumproducts were imported. The solution adopted by Nazi Germany was to manufacturesynthetic gasoline from its plentiful domestic coal supplies. It was thehydrogenation process of producing synthetic gasoline and iso-octane propertiesin gasoline that enabled Germany to go to war in 1940—and this hydrogenationprocess was developed and financed by the Standard Oil laboratories in theUnited States in partnership with I.G. Farben.Evidence presented to the Truman, Bone, and Kilgore Committees after World WarII confirmed that Standard Oil had at the same time “seriously imperiled the warpreparations of the United States.”2 [bm06.html#ch4fn2] Documentary evidence waspresented to all three Congressional committees that before World War IIStandard Oil had agreed with I.G. Farben, in the so-called Jasco agreement, thatsynthetic rubber was within Farben’s sphere of influence, while Standard Oil wasto have an absolute monopoly in the U.S. only if and when Farben alloweddevelopment of synthetic rubber to take place in the U.S.:Accordingly [concluded the Kilgore Committee] Standard fully accomplished I.G.’spurpose of preventing United States production by dissuading American rubbercompanies from undertaking independent research in developing synthetic rubberprocesses.3 [bm06.html#ch4fn3]Regrettably, the Congressional committees did not explore an even more ominousaspect of this Standard Oil—I.G. Farben collusion: that at this time directorsof Standard Oil of New Jersey had not only strategic warfare affiliations toI.G. Farben, but had other links with Hitler’s Germany—even to the extent ofcontributing, through German subsidiary companies, to Heinrich Himmler’spersonal fund and with membership in Himmler’s Circle of Friends as late as1944.During World War II Standard Oil of New Jersey was accused of treason for thispre-war alliance with Farben, even while its continuing wartime activitieswithin Himmler’s Circle of Friends were unknown. The accusations of treason werevehemently denied by Standard Oil. One of the more prominent of these defenceswas published by R.T. Haslam, a director of Standard Oil of New Jersey, in ThePetroleum Times (December 25, 1943), and entitled “Secrets Turned into MightyWar Weapons Through I.G. Farben Agreement.”4 [bm06.html#ch4fn4] This was anattempt to turn the tables and present the pre-war collusion as advantageous tothe United States.Whatever may have been Standard Oil’s wartime recollections and hasty defence,the 1929 negotiations and contracts between Standard and I.G. Farben wererecorded in the contemporary press and describe the agreements between StandardOil of New Jersey and I.G. Farben and their intent. In April 1929 Walter C.Teagle, president of Standard Oil of New Jersey, became a director of the newlyorganized American I.G. Farben. Not because Teagle was interested in thechemical industry but because,It has for some years past enjoyed a very close relationship with certainbranches of the research work of the I.G. Farbenindustrie which bear closelyupon the oil industry.5 [bm06.html#ch4fn5]It was announced by Teagle that joint research work on production of oil fromcoal had been carried on for some time and that a research laboratory for thiswork was to be established in the United States.6 [bm06.html#ch4fn6] In November1929 this jointly owned Standard—Farben research company was established underthe management of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, and all research andpatents relating to production of oil from coal held by both I.G. and Standardwere pooled. Previously, during the period 1926-1929, the two companies hadcooperated in development of the hydrogenation process, and experimental plantshad been placed in operation in both the U.S. and Germany. It was now proposedto erect new plants in the U.S. at Bayway, New Jersey and Baytown, Texas, inaddition to expansion of the earlier experimental plant at Baton Rouge. Standardannounced:. . . the importance of the new contract as applied to this country lay in thefact that it made certain that the hydrogenation process would be developedcommercially in this country under the guidance of American oil interests.7[bm06.html#ch4fn7]In December 1929 the new company, Standard I.G. Company, was organized. F.A.Howard was named president, and its German and American directors were announcedas follows: E.M. Clark, Walter Duisberg, Peter Hurll, R.A. Reidemann, H.G.Seidel, Otto von Schenck, and Guy Wellman.The majority of the stock in the research company was owned by Standard Oil. Thetechnical work, the process development work, and the construction of three newoil-from-coal plants in the United States was placed in the hands of theStandard Oil Development Company, the Standard Oil technical subsidiary. It isclear from these contemporary reports that the development work on oil from coalwas undertaken by Standard Oil of New Jersey within the United States, inStandard Oil plants and with majority financing and control by Standard. Theresults of this research were made available to I.G. Farben and became the basisfor the development of Hitler’s oil from-coal-programme which made World War IIpossible.The Haslam article, written by a former Professor of Chemical Engineering atM.I.T. (then vice president of Standard Oil of New Jersey) argued—contrary tothese recorded facts—that Standard Oil was able, through its Farben agreements,to obtain German technology for the United States. Haslam cited the manufactureof toluol and paratone (Oppanol), used to stabilize viscosity of oil, anessential material for desert and Russian winter tank operations, and bunarubber. However, this article, with its erroneous self-serving claims, found itsway to wartime Germany and became the subject of a “Secret” I.G. Farbenmemorandum dated June 6, 1944 from Nuremberg defendent and then-Farben officialvon Knieriem to fellow Farben management officials. This von Knieriem “Secret”memo set out those facts Haslam avoided in his Petroleum Times article. The memowas in fact a summary of what Standard was unwilling to reveal to the Americanpublic—i.e., the major contribution made by Standard Oil of New Jersey to theNazi war machine. The Farben memorandum states that the Standard Oil agreementswere absolutely essential for I.G. Farben:The closing of an agreement with Standard was necessary for technical,commercial, and financial reasons: technically, because the specializedexperience which was available only in a big oil company was necessary to thefurther development of our process, and no such industry existed in Germany;commercially, because in the absence of state economic control in Germany atthat time, IG had to avoid a competitive struggle with the great oil powers, whoalways sold the best gasoline at the lowest price in contested markets;financially, because IG, which had already spent extraordinarily large sums forthe development of the process, had to seek financial relief in order to be ableto continue development in other new technical fields, such as buna.8[bm06.html#ch4fn8]The Farben memorandum then answered the key question: What did I.G. Farbenacquire from Standard Oil that was “vital for the conduct of war?” The memoexamines those products cited by Haslam—i.e., iso-octane, tuluol,Oppanol-Paratone, and buna—and demonstrates that contrary to Standard Oil’spublic claim, their technology came to a great extent from the U.S., not fromGermany.On iso-octane the Farben memorandum reads, in part,By reason of their decades of work on motor fuels, the Americans were ahead ofus in their knowledge of the quality requirements that are called for by thedifferent uses of motor fuels. In particular they had developed, at greatexpense, a large number of methods of testing gasoline for different uses. Onthe basis of their experiments they had recognized the good antiknock quality ofiso-octane long before they had any knowledge of our hydrogenation process. Thisis proved by the single fact that in America fuels are graded in octane numbers,and iso-octane was entered as the best fuel with the number 100. All thisknowledge naturally became ours as a result of the agreement, which saved usmuch effort and protected us against many errors.I.G. Farben adds that Haslams claim that the production of iso-octane becameknown in America only through the Farben hydrogenation process was not correct:Especially in the case of iso-octane, it is shown that we owe much to theAmericans because in our own work we could draw widely on American informationon the behavior of fuels in motors. Moreover, we were also kept currentlyinformed by the Americans on the progress of their production process and itsfurther development.Shortly before the war, a new method for the production of iso-octane was foundin America — alkylation with isomerization as a preliminary step. This process,which Mr. Haslam does not mention at all, originates in fact entirely with theAmericans and has become known to us in detail in its separate stages throughour agreements with them, and is being used very extensively by us.On toluol, I.G. Farben points to a factual inaccuracy in the Haslam article:toluol was not produced by hydrogenation in the U.S. as claimed by ProfessorHaslam. In the case of Oppanol, the I.G. memo calls Haslams information“incomplete” and so far as buna rubber is concerned, “we never gave technicalinformation to the Americans, nor did technical cooperation in the buna fieldtake place.” Most importantly, the Farben memo goes on to describe some productsnot cited by Haslam in his article:As a consequence of our contracts with the Americans, we received from them,above and beyond the agreement, many very valuable contributions for thesynthesis and improvement of motor fuels and lubricating oils, which just nowduring the war are most useful to us; and we also received other advantages fromthem. Primarily, the following may be mentioned:(1) Above all, improvement of fuels through the addition of tetraethyl-lead andthe manufacture of this product. It need not be especially mentioned thatwithout tetraethyl-lead the present methods of warfare would be impossible. Thefact that since the beginning of the war we could produce tetraethyl-lead isentirely due to the circumstances that, shortly before, the Americans hadpresented us with the production plans, complete with their know-how. It was,moreover, the first time that the Americans decided to give a licence on thisprocess in a foreign country (besides communication of unprotected secrets) andthis only on our urgent requests to Standard Oil to fulfill our wish.Contractually we could not demand it, and we found out later that the WarDepartment in Washington gave its permission only after long deliberation.(2) Conversion of low-molecular unsaturates into usable gasoline(polymerization). Much work in this field has been done here as well as inAmerica. But the Americans were the first to carry the process through on alarge scale, which suggested to us also to develop the process on a largetechnical scale. But above and beyond that, plants built according to Americanprocesses are functioning in Germany.(3) In the field of lubricating oils as well, Germany through the contract withAmerica, learned of experience which is extraordinarily important for presentday warfare.In this connection, we obtained not only the experience of Standard, but,through Standard, the experiences of General Motors and other large Americanmotor companies as well.(4) As a further remarkable example of advantageous effect for us of thecontract between IG and Standard Oil, the following should be mentioned: in theyears 1934/1935 our government had the greatest interest in gathering fromabroad a stock of especially valuable mineral oil products (in particular,aviation gasoline and aviation lubricating oil), and holding it in reserve to anamount approximately equal to 20 million dollars at market value. The GermanGovernment asked IG if it were not possible, on the basis of its friendlyrelations with Standard Oil, to buy this amount in Farben’s name; actually,however, as trustee of the German Government. The fact that we actuallysucceeded by means of the most difficult negotiations in buying the quantitydesired by our government from the American Standard Oil Company and theDutch—English Royal—Dutch—Shell group and in transporting it to Germany, wasmade possible only through the aid of the Standard Oil Co.Ethyl Lead for the WehrmachtAnother prominent example of Standard Oil assistance to Nazi Germany—incooperation with General Motors—was in supplying ethyl lead. Ethyl fluid is ananti-knock compound used in both aviation and automobile fuels to eliminateknocking, and so improve engine efficiency; without such anti-knocking compoundsmodern mobile warfare would be impractical,In 1924 the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation was formed in New York City, jointlyowned by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and General Motors Corporation,to control and utilize U.S. patents for the manufacture and distribution oftetraethyl lead and ethyl fluid in the U.S. and abroad. Up to 1935 manufactureof these products was undertaken only in the United States. In 1935 EthylGasoline Corporation transferred its know-how to Germany for use in the Nazirearmament programme. This transfer was undertaken over the protests of the U.S.Government.Ethyl’s intention to transfer its anti-knock technology to Nazi Germany came tothe attention of the Army Air Corps in Washington, D.C. On December 15, 1934 E.W. Webb, president of Ethyl Gasoline9 [bm06.html#ch4fn9], was advised thatWashington had learned of the intention of “forming a German company with theI.G. to manufacture ethyl lead in that country.” The War Department indicatedthat there was considerable criticism of this technological transfer, whichmight “have the gravest repercussions” for the U.S.; that the commercial demandfor ethyl lead in Germany was too small to be of interest; and,. . . it has been claimed that Germany is secretly arming [and] ethyl lead woulddoubtless be a valuable aid to military aeroplanes.10 [bm06.html#ch4fn10]The Ethyl Company was then advised by the Army Air Corps that “under noconditions should you or the Board of Directors of the Ethyl GasolineCorporation disclose any secrets or ‘know-how’ in connection with themanufacture of tetraethyl lead to Germany.”11 [bm06.html#ch4fn11]On January 12, 1935 Webb mailed to the Chief of the Army Air Corps a “Statementof Facts,” which was in effect a denial that any such technical knowledge wouldbe transmitted; he offered to insert such a clause in the contract to guardagainst any such transfer. However, contrary to its pledge to the Army AirCorps, Ethyl subsequently signed a joint production agreement with I.G. Farbenin Germany to form Ethyl G.m.b.H. and with Montecatini in fascist Italy for thesame purpose,It is worth noting the directors of Ethyl Gasoline Corporation at the time ofthis transfer:12 [bm06.html#ch4fn12] E.W. Webb, president and director; C.F.Kettering; R.P. Russell; W.C. Teagle, Standard Oil of New Jersey and trustee ofFDR’s Georgia Warm Springs Foundation; F. A. Howard; E. M. Clark, Standard Oilof New Jersey; A. P. Sloan, Jr.; D. Brown; J. T. Smith; and W. S. Farish ofStandard Oil of New Jersey.The I.G. Farben files captured at the end of the war confirm the importance ofthis particular technical transfer for the German Wehrmacht:Since the beginning of the war we have been in a position to produce leadtetraethyl solely because, a short time before the outbreak of the war, theAmericans had established plants for us ready for production and supplied uswith all available experience. In this manner we did not need to perform thedifficult work of development because we could start production right away onthe basis of all the experience that the Americans had had for years.13[bm06.html#ch4fn13]In 1938, just before the outbreak of war in Europe, the German Luftwaffe had anurgent requirement for 500 tons of tetraethyl lead. Ethyl was advised by anofficial of DuPont that such quantities of ethyl would be used by Germany formilitary purposes.14 [bm06.html#ch4fn14] This 500 tons was loaned by the EthylExport Corporation of New York to Ethyl G.m.b.H. of Germany, in a transactionarranged by the Reich Air Ministry with I.G. Farben director Mueller-Cunradi.The collateral security was arranged in a letter dated September 21, 193815[bm06.html#ch4fn15] through Brown Brothers, Harriman & Co. of New York.Standard Oil of New Jersey and Synthetic RubberThe transfer of ethyl technology for the Nazi war machine was repeated in thecase of synthetic rubber. There is no question that the ability of the GermanWehrmacht to fight World War II depended on synthetic rubber—as well as onsynthetic petroleum—because Germany has no natural rubber, and war would havebeen impossible without Farben’s synthetic rubber production. Farben had avirtual monopoly of this field and the programme to produce the large quantitiesnecessary was financed by the Reich:The volume of planned production in this field was far beyond the needs ofpeacetime economy. The huge costs involved were consistent only with militaryconsiderations in which the need for self-sufficiency without regard to cost wasdecisive.16 [bm06.html#ch4fn16]As in the ethyl technology transfers, Standard Oil of New Jersey was intimatelyassociated with I.G. Farben’s synthetic rubber. A series of joint cartelagreements were made in the late 1920s aimed at a joint world monopoly ofsynthetic rubber. Hitler’s Four Year Plan went into effect in 1937 and in 1938Standard provided I.G. Farben with its new butyl rubber process. On the otherhand Standard kept the German buna process secret within the United States andit was not until June 1940 that Firestone and U.S. Rubber were allowed toparticipate in testing butyl and granted the buna manufacturing licences. Eventhen Standard tried to get the U.S. Government to finance a large-scale bunaprogramme — reserving its own funds for the more promising butyl process.17[bm06.html#ch4fn17]Consequently, Standard assistance in Nazi Germany was not limited to oil fromcoal, although this was the most important transfer. Not only was the processfor tetraethyl transferred to I.G. Farben and a plant built in Germany ownedjointly by I.G, General Motors, and Standard subsidiaries; but as late as 1939Standard’s German subsidiary designed a German plant for aviation gas.Tetraethyl was shipped on an emergency basis for the Wehrmacht and majorassistance was given in production of butyl rubber, while holding secret in theU.S. the Farben process for buna. In other words, Standard Oil of New Jersey(first under president W.C. Teagle and then under W.S. Farish) consistentlyaided the Nazi war machine while refusing to aid the United States.This sequence of events was not an accident. President W.S. Farish argued thatnot to have granted such technical assistance to the Wehrmacht “. . . would havebeen unwarranted.”18 [bm06.html#ch4fn18] The assistance was knowledgeable,ranged over more than a decade, and was so substantive that without it theWehrmacht could not have gone to war in 1939.The Deutsche-Amerikanische Petroleum A.G. (DAPAG)The Standard Oil subsidiary in Germany, Deutsche-Amerikanische Petroleum A.G.(DAPAG), was 94-percent owned by Standard Oil of New Jersey. DAPAG had branchesthroughout Germany, a refinery at Bremen, and a head office in Hamburg. ThroughDAPAG, Standard Oil of New Jersey was represented in the inner circles ofNaziism—the Keppler Circle and Himmler’s Circle of Friends. A director of DAPAGwas Karl Lindemann, also chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce inGermany, as well as director of several banks, including the Dresdner Bank, theDeutsche Reichsbank, and the private Nazi-oriented bank of C, Melchior &Company, and numerous corporations including the HAPAG (Hamburg-Amerika Line).Lindemann was a member of Keppler’s Circle of Friends as late as 1944 and sogave Standard Oil of New Jersey a representative at the very core of Naziism.Another member of the board of DAPAG was Emil Helffrich, who was an originalmember of the Keppler Circle.In sum, Standard Oil of New Jersey had two members of the Keppler Circle asdirectors of its German wholly owned subsidiary. Payments to the Circle from theStandard Oil subsidiary company, and from Lindemann and Helffrich as individualdirectors, continued until 1944, the year before the end of World War II.19[bm06.html#ch4fn19]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVELTX Works Both Sides of the WarThus while I.T.T.

During his lifetime Behn was the epitome of the politicizedbusinessman, earning his profits and building the I.T.T. empire throughpolitical manoeuvrings rather than in the competitive marketplace. In 1923,through political adroitness, Behn acquired the Spanish telephone monopoly,Companhia Telefonica de Espana [images/Espana.jpg]. In 1924 I.T.T., now backedby the J.P.

In brief, I.T.T. was aMorgan-controlled company; and we have previously noted the interest ofMorgan-controlled companies in war and revolution abroad and politicalmanoeuvring in the United States.2 [bm06.html#ch5fn2]In 1930 Behn acquired the German holding company of Standard Elekrizitats A.G,controlled by I.T.T. (62.0 percent of the voting stock), A.E.G. (31.1 percent ofthe voting stock) and Felton & Guilleaume (six percent of the voting stock). Inthis deal Standard acquired two German manufacturing plants and a majority stockinterest in Telefonfabrik Berliner A.G. I.T.T. also obtained the Standardsubsidiaries in Germany, Ferdinand Schuchardt Berliner Fernsprech-undTelegraphenwerk A.G, as well as Mix & Genest in Berlin, and Süddeutsche ApparateFabrik G.m.b.H. in Nuremberg.It is interesting to note in passing that while Sosthenes Behn’s I.T.T.controlled telephone companies and manufacturing plants in Germany, the cabletraffic between the U.S. and Germany was under the control ofDeutsch-Atlantische Telegraphengesellschaft (the German Atlantic Cable Company).This firm, together with the Commercial Cable Company and Western UnionTelegraph Company, had a monopoly in transatlantic U.S.-German cablecommunications. W.A. Harriman & Company took over a block of 625,000 shares inDeutsch-Atlantische in 1925, and the firm’s board of directors included anunusual array of characters, many of whom we have met elsewhere. It included,for example, H. F. Albert, the German espionage agent in the United States inWorld War I; Franklin D, Roosevelt’s former business associate vonBerenberg-Gossler; and Dr. Cuno, a former German chancellor of the 1923inflationary era. I.T.T. in the United States was represented on the board byvon Guilleaume and Max Warburg of the Warburg banking family.Baron Kurt von Schröder and the I.T.T.There is no record that I.T.T. made direct payments to Hitler before the Nazigrab for power in 1933. On the other hand, numerous payments were made toHeinrich Himmler in the late 1930s and in World War II itself through I.T.T.German subsidiaries. The first meeting between Hitler and I.T.T. officials — sofar as we know — was reported in August 1933,3 [bm06.html#ch5fn3] when SosthenesBehn and I.T.T. German representative Henry Manne met with Hitler inBerchesgaden. Subsequently, Behn made contact with the Keppler circle (seeChapter Nine) and, through Keppler’s influence, Nazi Baron Kurt von Schröderbecame the guardian of I.T.T. interests in Germany. Schröder acted as theconduit for I.T.T. money funnelled to Heinrich Himmler’s S.S. organization in1944, while World War II was in progress, and the United states was at war withGermany.4 [bm06.html#ch5fn4]Through Kurt Schröder, Behn and his I.T.T. gained access to the profitableGerman armaments industry and bought substantial interest in German armamentsfirms, including Focke-Wolfe aircraft. These armaments operations made handsomeprofits, which could have been repatriated to the United States parent company.But they were reinvested in German rearmament. This reinvestment of profits inGerman armament firms suggests that Wall Street claims it was innocent ofwrongdoing in German rearmament — and indeed did not even know of Hitler’sintentions — are fraudulent. Specifically, I.T.T. purchase of a substantialinterest in Focke-Wolfe meant, as Anthony Sampson has pointed out, that I.T.T.was producing German planes used to kill Americans and their allies — and itmade excellent profits out of the enterprise.In Kurt von Schröder, I.T.T. had access to the very heart of the Nazi powerelite. Who was Schröder? Baron Kurt von Schröder was born in Hamburg in 1889into an old, established German banking family. An earlier member of theSchröder family moved to London, changed his name to Schroder (without thedierisis) and organized the banking firm of J. Henry Schroder in London and J.Henry Schroder Banking Corporation in New York. Kurt von Schröder also became apartner in the private Cologne Bankhaus, J. H. Stein & Company, founded in thelate eighteenth century. Both Schröder and Stein had been promoters, in companywith French financiers, of the 1919 German separatist movement which attemptedto split the rich Rhineland away from Germany and its troubles. In this escapadeprominent Rhineland industrialists met at J. H. Stein’s house on January 7, 1919and a few months later organized a meeting, with Stein as chairman, to developpublic support for the separatist movement. The 1919 action failed. The grouptried again in 1923 and spearheaded another movement to break the Rhineland awayfrom Germany to come under the protection of France. This attempt also failed.Kurt von Schröder then linked up with Hitler and the early Nazis, and as in the1919 and 1923 Rhineland separatist movements, Schröder represented and workedfor German industrialists and armaments manufacturers.In exchange for financial and industrial support arranged by von Schröder, helater gained political prestige. Immediately after the Nazis gained power in1933 Schröder became the German representative at the Bank for InternationalSettlements, which Quigley calls the apex of the international control system,as well as head of the private bankers group advising the German Reichsbank.Heinrich Himmler appointed Schröder an S.S. Senior Group Leader, and in turnHimmler became a prominent member of Keppler’s Circle. (See Chapter Nine.)In 1938 the Schroder Bank in London became the German financial agent in GreatBritain, represented at financial meetings by its Managing Director (and adirector of the Bank of England), F.C. Tiarks. By World War II Baron Schröderhad in this manner acquired an impressive list of political and bankingconnections reflecting a widespread influence; it was even reported to the U.S.Kilgore Committee that Schröder was influential enough in 1940 to bring PierreLaval to power in France. As listed by the Kilgore Committee, Schröder’spolitical acquisitions in the early 1940s were as follows:SS Senior Group Leader.Iron Cross of First and Second Class.Swedish Consul General.International Chamber of Commerce – Member of administrative committee.Council of Reich Post Office – Member of advisory board.German Industrial and Commerce Assembly – Presiding member.Reich Board of Economic Affairs – Member.Deutsche Reichsbahn – President of administrative board.Trade Group for Wholesale and Foreign Trade – Manager.Akademie für Deutsches Recht (Academy of Germany Law) – Member.City of Cologne – Councillor,University of Cologne – Member of board of trustees.Kaiser Wilhelm Foundation – Senator.Advisory Council of German – Albanians.Goods Clearing Bureau – Member.Working Committee of Reich Group for Industry and Commerce – Deputy chairman.5[bm06.html#ch5fn5]Schröder’s banking connections were equally impressive and his businessconnections (not listed here) would take up two pages:Bank for International Settlements – Member of the directorate.J.H. Stein & Co, Cologne – Partner (Banque Worms was French correspondent).Deutsche Reichsbank, Berlin. Adviser to board of directors.Wirtschaftsgruppe Private Bankegewerbe – Leader.Deutsche Verkehrs-Kredit-Bank, A.G., Berlin (Controlled by Deutsche Reichsbank)– Chairman of board of directors.Deutsche Ueberseeische Bank (Controlled by Deutsche Bank, Berlin) – Director.6[bm06.html#ch5fn6]This was the Schröder who, after 1933, represented Sosthenes Behn of I.T.T. andI.T.T. interests in Nazi Germany. Precisely because Schröder had these excellentpolitical connections with Hitler and the Nazi State, Behn appointed Schröder tothe boards of all the I.T.T. German companies: Standard Electrizitatswerke A.G.in Berlin, C. Lorenz AG. of Berlin, and Mix & Genest A.G. (in which Standard hada 94-percent participation),In the mid-1930s another link was forged between Wall Street and Schröder, thistime through the Rockefellers. In 1936 the underwriting and general securitiesbusiness handled by J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation in New York was mergedinto a new investment banking firm — Schroder, Rockefeller & Company, Inc. at 48Wall Street. Carlton P. Fuller of Schroder Banking Corporation became presidentand Avery Rockefeller, son of Percy Rockefeller (brother of John D. Rockefeller)became vice president and director of the new firm. Previously, AveryRockefeller had been associated behind the scenes with J. Henry Schroder BankingCorporation; the new firm brought him out into the open.7 [bm06.html#ch5fn7]Westrick, Texaco, and I.T.T.I.T.T. had yet another conduit to Nazi Germany, through German attorney Dr.Gerhard Westrick. Westrick was one of a select group of Germans who hadconducted espionage in the United States during World War I. The group includednot only Kurt von Schröder and Westrick but also Franz von Papen — whom we shallmeet in company with James Paul Warburg of the Bank of Manhattan in Chapter Ten— and Dr. Heinrich Albert. Albert, supposedly German commercial attaché in theU.S. in World War I, was actually in charge of financing von Papen’s espionageprogramme. After World War I Westrick and Albert formed the law firm of Albert &Westrick which specialized in, and profited heavily from, the Wall Streetreparations loans. The Albert & Westrick firm handled the German end of the J.Henry Schroder Banking loans, while the John Foster Dulles firm of Sullivan andCromwell in New York handled the U.S. end of the Schroder loans.Just prior to World War II the Albert-Papen-Westrick espionage operation in theUnited States began to repeat itself, only this time around the Americanauthorities were more alert. Westrick came to the U.S. in 1940, supposedly as acommercial attaché but in fact as Ribbentrop’s personal representative. A streamof visitors to the influential Westrick included prominent directors of U.S.petroleum and industrial firms, and this brought Westrick to the attention ofthe FBI.Westrick at this time became a director of all I.T.T. operations in Germany, inorder to protect I.T.T. interests during the expected U.S. involvement in theEuropean war.8 [bm06.html#ch5fn8] Among his other enterprises Westrick attemptedto persuade Henry Ford to cut off supplies to Britain, and the favouredtreatment given by the Nazis to Ford interests in France suggests that Westrickwas partially successful in neutralizing U.S. aid to Britain.Although Westrick’s most important wartime business connection in the UnitedStates was with International Telephone and Telegraph, he also represented otherU.S. firms, including Underwood Elliott Fisher, owner of the German companyMercedes Buromaschinen A.G.; Eastman Kodak, which had a Kodak subsidiary inGermany; and the International Milk Corporation, with a Hamburg subsidiary.Among Westrick’s deals (and the one which received the most publicity) was acontract for Texaco to supply oil to the German Navy, which he arranged withTorkild Rieber, chairman of the board of Texaco Company.In 1940 Rieber discussed an oil deal with Hermann Goering, and Westrick in theUnited States worked for Texas Oil Company. His automobile was bought withTexaco funds, and Westrick’s driver’s licence application gave Texaco as hisbusiness address. These activities were publicized on August 12, 1940. Riebersubsequently resigned from Texaco and Westrick returned to Germany. Two yearslater Rieber was chairman of South Carolina Shipbuilding and Dry Docks,supervising construction of more than $10 million of U.S. Navy ships, and adirector of the Guggenheim family’s Barber Asphalt Corporation and Seaboard OilCompany of Ohio.9 [bm06.html#ch5fn9]I.T.T. in Wartime GermanyIn 1939 I.T.T. in the United States controlled Standard Elektrizitäts inGermany, and in turn Standard Elektrizitäts controlled 94 percent of Mix &Genest. On the board of Standard Elektrizitäts was Baron Kurt von Schröder, aNazi banker at the core of Naziism, and Emil Heinrich Meyer, brother-in-law ofSecretary of State Keppler (founder of the Keppler Circle) and a director ofGerman General Electric. Schröder and Meyer were also directors of Mix & Genestand the other I.T.T. subsidiary, C. Lorenz Company; both of these I.T.T.subsidiaries were monetary contributors to Himmler’s Circle of Friends — i.e.,the Nazi S.S. slush fund. As late as 1944, Mix & Genest contributed 5,000 RM toHimmler and Lorenz contributed 20,000 RM. In short, during World War IIInternational Telephone and Telegraph was making cash payments to S.S. leaderHeinrich Himmler.10 [bm06.html#ch5fn10] These payments enabled I.T.T. to protectits investment in Focke-Wolfe, an aircraft manufacturing firm producing fighteraircraft used against the United States.The interrogation of Kurt von Schröder on November 19, 1945 points up thedeliberate nature of the close and profitable relationship between ColonelSosthenes Behn of I.T.T., Westrick, Schröder, and the Nazi war machine duringWorld War II, and that this was a deliberate and knowledgeable relationship.Q.You have [told] us in your earlier testimony, a number of companies in Germanyin which the International Telephone and Telegraph Company or the StandardElectric Company had a participation. Did either International Telephone andTelegraph Company or the Standard Electric Company have a participation in anyother company in Germany? A.Yes. The Lorenz Company, shortly before the war,took a participation of about 25 percent in Focke-Wolfe A.G. in Bremen.Focke-Wolfe was making airplanes for the German Air Ministry. I believe thatlater as Focke-Wolfe expanded and took in more capital that the interest ofLorenz Company dropped a little below this 25 percent. Q.So this participationin Focke-Wolfe by Lorenz Company began after Lorenz Company was nearly100-percent owned and controlled by Colonel Behn through the InternationalTelephone and Telegraph Company? A.Yes. Q.Did Colonel Behen [sic] approve ofthis investment by the Lorenz Company in Focke-Wolfe? A.I am confident thatColonel Behn approved before his representatives who were in close touch withhim formally approved the transaction. Q.What year was it that the LorenzCompany made the investment which gave it this 25 percent participation inFocke-Wolfe? A.I remember it was shortly before the outbreak of war, that is,shortly before the invasion of Poland. [Ed: 1939] Q.Would Westrick know allabout the details of the participations of Lorenz Company in Focke-Wolfe, A.G.of Bremen? A.Yes. Better than I would. Q.What was the size of the investmentthat Lorenz Company made in the Focke-Wolfe A.G., of Bremen, which gave them theinitial 25 percent participation? A.250,000 thousand RM initially, and this wassubstantially increased, but I don’t recall the extent of the additionalinvestments that Lorenz Company made to this Focke-Wolfe A.G. of Bremen. Q.From1933, until the outbreak of the European War, was Colonel Behn in a position totransfer the profits from investments of his companies in Germany to hiscompanies in the United States? A.Yes. While it would have required that hiscompanies take a little less than the full dividends because of the difficultyof securing foreign exchange, the great bulk of the profits could have beentransferred to the company of Colonel Behn in the United States. However,Colonel Behn did not elect to do this and at no time did he ask me if I couldaccomplish this for him. Instead, he appeared to be perfectly content to haveall the profits of the companies in Germany, which he and his interestscontrolled, reinvesting these profits in new buildings and machinery and anyother enterprises engaged in producing armaments. Another one of these enterprises, Huth and Company, G.m.b.H., of Berlin,which made radio and radar parts, many of which were used in equipment going tothe German Armed Forces. The Lorenz Company as I recall it [had] a 50-percentparticipation in Huth and Company. The Lorenz Company also had a smallsubsidiary which acted as a sales agency for the Lorenz Company to privatecustomers. Q.You were a member of the board of Lorenz Company’s board ofdirector, from about 1935 up to the present time. During this time, LorenzCompany and some of the other companies, such as Focke-Wolfe with which it hadlarge participations, were engaged in the manufacture of equipment for armamentsand war production. Did you know or did you hear of any protest made by ColonelBehn or his representatives against these companies engaged in these activitiespreparing Germany for war? A.No. Q.Are you positive that there was no otheroccasion in which you were asked by either Westrick, Mann [sic], Colonel Behn orany other person connected with the International Telephone and TelegraphicCompany interests in Germany, to intervene on behalf of the company with theGerman authorities. A.Yes. I don’t remember any request for my intervention inany matter of importance to the Lorenz Company or any other InternationalTelephone and Telegraph interests in Germany. I have read the record of this interrogation and I swear that the answers Ihave given to the question of Messrs. Adams and Pajus are true to the best ofknowledge and belief. s/Kurt von SchröderIt was this story of I.T.T.-Nazi cooperation during World War II and I.T.T.association with Nazi Kurt von Schröder that I.T.T. wanted to conceal — andalmost was successful in concealing. James Stewart Martin recounts how duringthe planning meetings of the Finance Division of the Control Commission he wasassigned to work with Captain Norbert A. Bogdan, who out of uniform was vicepresident of the J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation of New York. Martinrelates that “Captain Bogdan had argued vigorously against investigation of theStein Bank on the grounds that it was ‘small potatoes.’ “11 [bm06.html#ch5fn11]Shortly after blocking this manoeuvre, two permanent members of Bogdan’s staffapplied for permission to investigate the Stein Bank — although Cologne had notyet fallen to U.S. forces. Martin recalls that “The Intelligence Divisionblocked that one,” and so some information on the Stein-Schröder Bank-I.T.T.operation survived."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOWALL STREET ANDFUNDS FOR HITLER"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXHenry Ford and the NazisI would like to outline the importance attached by high [Nazi] officials torespect the desire and maintain the good will of “Ford,” and by “Ford” I meanyour father, yourself, and the Ford Motor Company, Dearborn. (Josiah E. Dubois,Jr., Generals in Grey Suits, London: The Bodley Head, 1953, p. 250.)Henry Ford is often seen to be something of an enigma among the Wall Streetelite. For many years in the 20s and 30s Ford was popularly known as an enemy ofthe financial establishment. Ford accused Morgan and others of using war andrevolution as a road to profit and their influence in social systems as a meansof personal advancement. By 1938 Henry Ford, in his public statements, haddivided financiers into two classes: those who profited from war and used theirinfluence to bring about war for profit, and the “constructive” financiers.Among the latter group he now included the House of Morgan. During a 1938 NewYork Times interview1 [bm06.html#ch6fn1] Ford averred that:Somebody once said that sixty families have directed the destinies of thenation. It might well be said that if somebody would focus the spotlight ontwenty-five persons who handle the nation’s finances, the world’s real warmakerswould be brought into bold relief.The Times reporter asked Ford how he equated this assessment with hislong-standing criticism of the House of Morgan, to which Ford replied:There is a constructive and a destructive Wall Street. The House of Morganrepresents the constructive. I have known Mr. Morgan for many years. He backedand supported Thomas Edison, who was also my good friend ....After expounding on the evils of limited agricultural production — allegedlybrought about by Wall Street — Ford continued,. . . if these financiers had their way we’d be in a war now. They want warbecause they make money out of such conflict — out of the human misery that warsbring.On the other hand, when we probe behind these public statements we find thatHenry Ford and son Edsel Ford have been in the forefront of American businessmenwho try to walk both sides of every ideological fence in search of profit. UsingFord’s own criteria, the Fords are among the “destructive” elements.It was Henry Ford who in the 1930s built the Soviet Union’s first modernautomobile plant (located at Gorki) and which in the 50s and 60s produced thetrucks used by the North Vietnamese to carry weapons and munitions for useagainst Americans.2 [bm06.html#ch6fn2] At about the same time, Henry Ford wasalso the most famous of Hitler’s foreign backers, and he was rewarded in the1930s for this long-lasting support with the highest Nazi decoration forforeigners,This Nazi favour aroused a storm of controversy in the United States andultimately degenerated into an exchange of diplomatic notes between the GermanGovernment and the State Department. While Ford publically protested that he didnot like totalitarian governments, we find in practice that Ford knowinglyprofited from both sides of World War II — from French and German plantsproducing vehicles at a profit for the Wehrmacht, and from U.S. plants buildingvehicles at a profit for the U.S. Army.Henry Ford’s protestations of innocence suggest, as we shall see in thischapter, that he did not approve of Jewish financiers profiting from war (assome have), but if anti-Semitic Morgan3 [bm06.html#ch6fn3] and Ford profitedfrom war that was acceptable, moral and “constructive.”Henry Ford: Hitler’s First Foreign BackerOn December 20, 1922 the New York Times reported4 [bm06.html#ch6fn4] thatautomobile manufacturer Henry Ford was financing Adolf Hitler’s nationalist andanti-Semitic movements in Munich. Simultaneously, the Berlin newspaper BerlinerTageblatt appealed to the American Ambassador in Berlin to investigate and haltHenry Ford’s intervention into German domestic affairs. It was reported thatHitler’s foreign backers had furnished a “spacious headquarters” with a “host ofhighly paid lieutenants and officials.” Henry Ford’s portrait was prominentlydisplayed on the walls of Hitler’s personal office:image [images/pg91.jpg]The wall behind his desk in Hitlers private office is decorated with a largepicture of Henry Ford. In the antechamber there is a large table covered withbooks, nearly all of which are a translation of a book written and published byHenry Ford.5 [bm06.html#ch6fn5]The same New York Times report commented that the previous Sunday Hitler hadreviewed,The so-called Storming Battalion ... 1,000 young men in brand-new uniforms andarmed with revolvers and blackjacks, while Hitler and his henchmen drove aroundin two powerful brand-new autos.The Times made a clear distinction between the German monarchist parties andHitler’s anti-Semitic fascist party. Henry Ford, it was noted, ignored theHohenzollern monarchists and put his money into the Hitlerite revolutionarymovement.These Ford funds were used by Hitler to foment the Bavarian rebellion. Therebellion failed, and Hitler was captured and subsequently brought to trial. InFebruary 1923 at the trial, vice president Auer of the Bavarian Diet testified:The Bavarian Diet has long had the information that the Hitler movement waspartly financed by an American anti-Semitic chief, who is Henry Ford. Mr. Ford’sinterest in the Bavarian anti-Semitic movement began a year ago when one of Mr.Ford’s agents, seeking to sell tractors, came in contact with Diedrich Eichart,the notorious Pan-German. Shortly after, Herr Eichart asked Mr. Ford’s agent forfinancial aid. The agent returned to America and immediately Mr. Ford’s moneybegan coming to Munich.Herr Hitler openly boasts of Mr. Ford’s support and praises Mr. Ford as a greatindividualist and a great anti-Semite. A photograph of Mr. Ford hangs in HerrHitler’s quarters, which is the centre of monarchist movement.6[bm06.html#ch6fn6]Hitler received a mild and comfortable prison sentence for his Bavarianrevolutionary activities. The rest from more active pursuits enabled him towrite Mein Kampf. Henry Ford’s book, The International Jew, earlier circulatedby the Nazis, was translated by them into a dozen languages, and Hitler utilizedsections of the book verbatim in writing Mein Kampf.7 [bm06.html#ch6fn7]We shall see later that Hitler’s backing in the late 20s and early 30s came fromthe chemical, steel, and electrical industry cartels, rather than directly fromindividual industrialists. In 1928 Henry Ford merged his German assets withthose of the I.G. Farben chemical cartel. A substantial holding, 40 percent ofFord Motor A.G. of Germany, was transferred to I.G. Farben; Carl Bosch of I.G.Farben became head of Ford A.G. Motor in Germany. Simultaneously, in the UnitedStates Edsel Ford joined the board of American I.G. Farben. (See Chapter Two[chapter02.html#ch2].)Henry Ford Receives a Nazi MedalA decade later, in August 1938 — after Hitler had achieved power with the aid ofthe cartels — Henry Ford received the Grand Cross of the German Eagle, a Nazidecoration for distinguished foreigners. The New York Times reported it was thefirst time the Grand Cross had been awarded in the United States and was tocelebrate Henry Ford’s 75th birthday.8 [bm06.html#ch6fn8]The decoration raised a storm of criticism within Zionist circles in the U.S.Ford backed off to the extent of publicly meeting with Rabbi Leo Franklin ofDetroit to express his sympathy for the plight of German Jews:My acceptance of a medal from the German people [said Ford] does not, as somepeople seem to think, involve any sympathy on my part with naziism. Those whohave known me for many years realize that anything that breeds hate is repulsiveto me.9 [bm06.html#ch6fn9]The Nazi medal issue was picked up in a Cleveland speech by Secretary ofInterior Harold Ickes. Ickes criticized both Henry Ford and Colonel Charles A.Lindbergh for accepting Nazi medals. The curious part of the Ickes speech, madeat a Cleveland Zionist Society banquet, was his criticism of “wealthy Jews” andtheir acquisition and use of wealth:A mistake made by a non-Jewish millionaire reflects upon him alone, but a falsestep made by a Jewish man of wealth reflects upon his whole race. This is harshand unjust, but it is a fact that must be faced.10 [bm06.html#ch6fn10]Perhaps Ickes was tangentially referring to the roles of the Warburgs in theI.G. Farben cartel: Warburgs were on the board of I.G. Farben in the U.S. andGermany. In 1938 the Warburgs were being ejected by the Nazis from Germany.Other German Jews, such as the Oppenheim bankers, made their peace with theNazis and were granted “honorary Aryan status.”Ford Motor Company Assists the German War EffortA post-war Congressional subcommittee investigating American support for theNazi military effort described the manner in which the Nazis succeeded inobtaining U.S. technical and financial assistance as “quite fantastic.”11[bm06.html#ch6fn11] Among other evidence the Committee was shown a memorandumprepared in the offices of Ford-Werke A.G. on November 25, 1941, written by Dr.H. F. Albert to R. H. Schmidt, then president of the board of Ford-Werke A.G.The memo cited the advantages of having a majority of the German firm held byFord Motor Company in Detroit. German Ford had been able to exchange Ford partsfor rubber and critical war materials needed in 1938 and 1939 “and they wouldnot have been able to do that if Ford had not been owned by the United States.”Further, with a majority American interest German Ford would “more easily beable to step in and dominate the Ford holdings throughout Europe.” It was evenreported to the Committee that two top German Ford officials had been in abitter personal feud about who was to control Ford of England, such “that one ofthem finally got up and left the room in disgust.”According to evidence presented to the Committee, Ford-Werke A.G. wastechnically transformed in the late 1930s into a German company. All vehiclesand their parts were produced in Germany, by German workers using Germanmaterials under German direction and exported to European and overseasterritories of the United States and Great Britain. Any needed foreign rawmaterials, rubber and non-ferrous metals, were obtained through the AmericanFord Company. American influence had been more or less converted into asupporting position (Hilfsstellung) for the German Ford plants,At the outbreak of the war Ford-Werke placed itself at the disposal of theWehrmacht for armament production. It was assumed by the Nazis that as long asFord-Werke A.G. had an American majority, it would be possible to bring theremaining European Ford companies under German influence — i.e., that ofFord-Werke A.G. — and so execute Nazi “Greater European” policies in the Fordplants in Amsterdam, Antwerp, Paris, Budapest, Bucharest, and Copenhagen:A majority, even if only a small one, of Americans is essential for thetransmittal of the newest American models, as well as American production andsales methods. With the abolition of the American majority, this advantage, aswell as the intervention of the Ford Motor Company to obtain raw materials andexports, would be lost, and the German plant would practically only be worth itsmachine capacity.12 [bm06.html#ch6fn12]And, of course, this kind of strict neutrality, taking an international ratherthan a national viewpoint, had earlier paid off for Ford Motor Company in theSoviet Union, where Ford was held in high regard as the ultimate of technicaland economic efficiency to be achieved by the Stakhanovites.In July 1942 word filtered back to Washington from Ford of France about Ford’sactivities on behalf of the German war effort in Europe. The incriminatinginformation was promptly buried and even today only part of the knowndocumentation can be traced in Washington.We do know, however, that the U.S. Consul General in Algeria had possession of aletter from Maurice Dollfuss of French Ford — who claimed to be the firstFrenchman to go to Berlin after the fall of France — to Edsel Ford about a planby which Ford Motor could contribute to the Nazi war effort. French Ford wasable to produce 20 trucks a day for the Wehrmacht, which [wrote Dollfuss] isbetter than,. . . our less fortunate French competitors are doing. The reason is that ourtrucks are in very large demand by the German authorities and I believe that aslong as the war goes on and at least for some period of time, all that we shallproduce will be taken by the German authorities . . . . I will satisfy myself bytelling you that . . . the attitude you have taken, together with your father,of strict neutrality, has been an invaluable asset for the production of yourcompanies in Europe.13 [bm06.html#ch6fn13]Dollfuss disclosed that profits from this German business were already 1.6million francs, and net profits for 1941 were no less than 58,000,000 francs —because the Germans paid promptly for Ford’s output. On receipt of this newsEdsel Ford cabled:Delighted to hear you are making progress. Your letters most interesting. Fullyrealize great handicap you are working under. Hope you and family well. Regards.s/Edsel Ford14 [bm06.html#ch6fn14]Although there is evidence that European plants owned by Wall Street interestswere not bombed by the U.S. Air Force in World War II, this restrictionapparently did not reach the British Bombing Command. In March 1942 the RoyalAir Force bombed the Ford plant at Poissy, France. A subsequent letter fromEdsel Ford to Ford General Manager Sorenson about this RAF raid commented,“Photographs of the plant on fire were published in American newspapers butfortunately no reference was made to the Ford Motor Company.”15[bm06.html#ch6fn15] In any event, the Vichy government paid Ford Motor Company38 million francs as compensation for damage done to the Poissy plant. This wasnot reported in the U.S. press and would hardly be appreciated by thoseAmericans at war with Naziism. Dubois asserts that these private messages fromFord in Europe were passed to Edsel Ford by Assistant Secretary of StateBreckenridge Long. This was the same Secretary Long who one year latersuppressed private messages through the State Department concerning theextermination of Jews in Europe.16 [bm06.html#ch6fn16] Disclosure of thosemessages conceivably could have been used to assist those desperate people.A U.S. Air Force bombing intelligence report written in 1943 noted that,Principal wartime activities [of the Ford plant] are probably manufacture oflight trucks and of spare parts for all the Ford trucks and cars in service inAxis Europe (including captured Russian Molotovs).16 [bm06.html#ch6fn16]The Russian Molotovs were of course manufactured by the Ford-built works atGorki, Russia. In France during the war, passenger automobile production wasentirely replaced by military vehicles and for this purpose three largeadditional buildings were added to the Poissy factory. The main buildingcontained about 500 machine tools, “all imported from the United States andincluding a fair sprinkling of the more complex types, such as Gleason gearcutters, Bullard automatics and Ingersoll borers.”17 [bm06.html#ch6fn17]Ford also extended its wartime activities into North Africa. In December 1941 anew Ford Company, Ford-Afrique, was registered in France and granted all therights of the former Ford Motor Company, Ltd. of England in Algeria, Tunisia,French Morocco, French Equatorial, and French West Africa. North Africa was notaccessible to British Ford so this new Ford Company — registered inGerman-occupied France — was organized to fill the gap. The directors werepro-Nazi and included Maurice Dollfuss (Edsel Ford’s correspondent) and RogerMessis (described by the U.S. Algiers Consul General as “known to this office byrepute as unscrupulous, is stated to be a 100 percent pro-German”).18[bm06.html#ch6fn18]The U.S. Consul General also reported that propaganda was common in Algiersabout. . . the collaboration of French-German-American capital and the questionablesincerity of the American war effort, [there] is already pointing an accusingfinger at a transaction which has been for long a subject of discussion incommercial circles.19 [bm06.html#ch6fn19]In brief, there is documentary evidence that Ford Motor Company worked on bothsides of World War II. If the Nazi industrialists brought to trial at Nurembergwere guilty of crimes against mankind, then so must be their fellowcollaborators in the Ford family, Henry and Edsel Ford. However, the Ford storywas concealed by Washington — apparently like almost everything else that couldtouch upon the name and sustenance of the Wall Street financial elite."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENWho Financed Adolf Hitler?The funding of Hitler and the Nazi movement has yet to be explored in exhaustivedepth. The only published examination of Hitler’s personal finances is anarticle by Oron James Hale, “Adolph Hitler: Taxpayer,”1 [bm06.html#ch7fn1] whichrecords Adolf’s brushes with the German tax authorities before he becameReichskanzler. In the 1920s Hitler presented himself to the German tax man asmerely an impoverished writer living on bank loans, with an automobile bought oncredit. Unfortunately, the original records used by Hale do not yield the sourceof Hitler’s income, loans, or credit, and German law “did not requireself-employed or professional persons to disclose in detail the sources ofincome or the nature of services rendered.”2 [bm06.html#ch7fn2] Obviously thefunds for the automobiles, private secretary Rudolf Hess, another assistant, achauffeur, and expenses incurred by political activity, came from somewhere.But, like Leon Trotsky’s 1917 stay in New York, it is hard to reconcile Hitler’sknown expenditures with the precise source of his income.Some Early Hitler BackersWe do know that prominent European and American industrialists were sponsoringall manner of totalitarian political groups at that time, including Communistsand various Nazi groups. The U.S Kilgore Committee records that:By 1919 Krupp was already giving financial aid to one of the reactionarypolitical groups which sowed the seed of the present Nazi ideology. Hugo Stinneswas an early contributor to the Nazi Party (National Socialistische DeutscheArbeiter Partei). By 1924 other prominent industrialists and financiers, amongthem Fritz Thyssen, Albert Voegler, Adolph [sic] Kirdorf, and Kurt von Schröder,were secretly giving substantial sums to the Nazis. In 1931 members of thecoalowners association which Kirdorf headed pledged themselves to pay 50pfennigs for each ton of coal sold, the money to go to the organization whichHitler was building.3 [bm06.html#ch7fn3]Hitler’s 1924 Munich trial yielded evidence that the Nazi Party received $20,000from Nuremberg industrialists. The most interesting name from this period isthat of Emil Kirdorf, who had earlier acted as conduit for financing Germaninvolvement in the Bolshevik Revolution.4 [bm06.html#ch7fn4] Kirdorf’s role infinancing Hitler was, in his own words;In 1923 I came into contact for the first time with the National-Socialistmovement. . . . I first heard the Fuehrer in the Essen Exhibition Hall. Hisclear exposition completely convinced and overwhelmed me. In 1927 I first metthe Fuehrer personally. I travelled to Munich and there had a conversation withthe Fuehrer in the Bruckmann home. During four and a half hours Adolf Hitlerexplained to me his programme in detail. I then begged the Fuehrer to puttogether the lecture he had given me in the form of a pamphlet. I thendistributed this pamphlet in my name in business and manufacturing circles.Since then I have placed myself completely at the disposition of his movement.Shortly after our Munich conversation, and as a result of the pamphlet which theFuehrer composed and I distributed, a number of meetings took place between theFuehrer and leading personalities in the field of industry. For the last timebefore the taking over of power, the leaders of industry met in my housetogether with Adolf Hitler, Rudolf Hess, Hermann Goering and other leadingpersonalities of the party.5 [bm06.html#ch7fn5]In 1925 the Hugo Stinnes family contributed funds to convert the Nazi weeklyVolkischer Beobachter to a daily publication. Putzi Hanfstaengl, Franklin D.Roosevelt’s friend and protégé, provided the remaining funds.6[bm06.html#ch7fn6] Table 7-1 summarizes presently known financial contributionsand the business associations of contributors from the United States. Putzi isnot listed in Table 7-1 as he was neither industrialist nor financier.In the early 1930s financial assistance to Hitler began to flow more readily.There took place in Germany a series of meetings, irrefutably documented inseveral sources, between German industrialists, Hitler himself, and more oftenHitler’s representatives Hjalmar Schacht and Rudolf Hess. The critical point isthat the German industrialists financing Hitler were predominantly directors ofcartels with American associations, ownership, participation, or some form ofsubsidiary connection. The Hitler backers were not, by and large, firms ofpurely German origin, or representative of German family business. Except forThyssen and Kirdorf, in most cases they were the German multinational firms —i.e., I.G. Farben, A.E.G., DAPAG, etc. These multinationals had been built up byAmerican loans in the 1920s, and in the early 1930s had American directors andheavy American financial participation.One flow of foreign political funds not considered here is that reported fromthe European-based Royal Dutch Shell, Standard Oil’s great competitor in the 20sand 30s, and the giant brainchild of Anglo-Dutch businessman Sir HenriDeterding. It has been widely asserted that Henri Deterding personally financedHitler. This argument is made, for instance, by biographer Glyn Roberts in TheMost Powerful Man in the World. Roberts notes that Deterding was impressed withHitler as early as 1921:. . . and the Dutch press reported that, through the agent Georg Bell, he[Deterding] had placed at Hitler s disposal, while the party was “still in longclothes,” no less than four million guilders.7 [bm06.html#ch7fn7]It was reported (by Roberts) that in 1931 Georg Bell, Deterding’s agent,attended meetings of Ukrainian Patriots in Paris “as joint delegate of Hitlerand Deterding.”8 [bm06.html#ch7fn8] Roberts also reports:Deterding was accused, as Edgar Ansell Mowrer testifies in his Germany Puts theClock Back, of putting up a large sum of money for the Nazis on theunderstanding that success would give him a more favoured position in the Germanoil market. On other occasions, figures as high as £55,000,000 were mentioned.9[bm06.html#ch7fn9]Biographer Roberts really found Deterding’s strong anti-Bolshevism distasteful,and rather than present hard evidence of funding he is inclined to assume ratherthan prove that Deterding was pro-Hitler. But pro-Hitlerism is not a necessaryconsequence of anti-Bolshevism; in any event Roberts offers no proof of finance,and hard evidence of Deterding’s involvement was not found by this author.Mowrer’s book contains neither index nor footnotes as to the source of hisinformation and Roberts has no specific evidence for his accusations. There iscircumstantial evidence that Deterding was pro-Nazi. He later went to live inHitler’s Germany and increased his share of the German petroleum market. Sothere may have been some contributions, but these have not been proven.Similarly, in France (on January 11, 1932), Paul Fauré, a member of the Chambredes Députés, accused the French industrial firm of Schneider-Creuzot offinancing Hitler — and incidentally implicated Wall Street in other financingchannels.10 [bm06.html#ch7fn10]The Schneider group is a famous firm of French armaments manufacturers. Afterrecalling the Schneider influence in establishment of Fascism in Hungary and itsextensive international armaments operations, Paul Fauré turns to Hitler, andquotes from the French paper Le Journal, “that Hitler had received 300,000 Swissgold francs” from subscriptions opened in Holland under the case of a universityprofessor named von Bissing. The Skoda plant at Pilsen, stated Paul Fauré, wascontrolled by the French Schneider family, and it was the Skoda directors vonDuschnitz and von Arthaber who made the subscriptions to Hitler. Fauréconcluded:... I am disturbed to see the directors of Skoda, controlled by Schneider,subsidizing the electoral campaign of M. Hitler; I am disturbed to see yourfirms, your financiers, your industrial cartels unite themselves with the mostnationalistic of Germans ....Again, no hard evidence was found for this alleged flow of Hitler funds.Fritz Thyssen and W.A. Harriman Company of New YorkAnother elusive case of reported financing of Hitler is that of Fritz Thyssen,the German steel magnate who associated himself with the Nazi movement in theearly 20s. When interrogated in 1945 under Project Dustbin,11[bm06.html#ch7fn11] Thyssen recalled that he was approached in 1923 by GeneralLudendorf at the time of French evacuation of the Ruhr. Shortly after thismeeting Thyssen was introduced to Hitler and provided funds for the Nazisthrough General Ludendorf. In 1930-1931 Emil Kirdorf approached Thyssen andsubsequently sent Rudolf Hess to negotiate further funding for the Nazi Party.This time Thyssen arranged a credit of 250,000 marks at the Bank voor Handel enScheepvaart N.V. at 18 Zuidblaak in Rotterdam, Holland, founded in 1918 with H.J. Kouwenhoven and D. C. Schutte as managing partners.12 [bm06.html#ch7fn12]This bank was a subsidiary of the August Thyssen Bank of Germany (formerly vonder Heydt’s Bank A.G.). It was Thyssen’s personal banking operation, and it wasaffiliated with the W. A, Harriman financial interests in New York. Thyssenreported to his Project Dustbin interrogators that:I chose a Dutch bank because I did not want to be mixed up with German banks inmy position, and because I thought it was better to do business with a Dutchbank, and I thought I would have the Nazis a little more in my hands.13[bm06.html#ch7fn13]Thyssen’s book I Paid Hitler, published in 1941, was purported to be written byFritz Thyssen himself, although Thyssen denies authorship, The book claims thatfunds for Hitler — about one million marks — came mainly from Thyssen himself. IPaid Hitler has other unsupported assertions, for example that Hitler wasactually descended from an illegitimate child of the Rothschild family.Supposedly Hitler’s grandmother, Frau Schickelgruber, had been a servant in theRothschild household and while there became pregnant:. . . an inquiry once ordered by the late Austrian chancellor, EngelbertDollfuss, yielded some interesting results, owing to the fact that the dossiersof the police department of the Austro-Hungarian monarch were remarkablycomplete.14 [bm06.html#ch7fn14]This assertion concerning Hitler’s illegitimacy is refuted entirely in a moresolidly based book by Eugene Davidson, which implicates the Frankenbergerfamily, not the Rothschild family.In any event, and more relevant from our viewpoint, the August Thyssen frontbank in Holland — i.e., the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V. — controlledthe Union Banking Corporation in New York. The Harrimans had a financialinterest in, and E. Roland Harriman (Averell’s brother) was a director of, thisUnion Banking Corporation. The Union Banking Corporation of New York City was ajoint Thyssen-Harriman operation with the following directors in 1932:15[bm06.html#ch7fn15]E. Roland HARRIMANVice president of W. A.

Kurt von SCHRÖDERMix & GenestLorenz Heinrich Himmler S.S.via Keppler’s CircleThyssen arranged a credit of 250,000 marks for Hitler, through this Dutch bankaffiliated with the Harrimans. Thyssen’s book, later repudiated, states that asmuch as one million marks came from Thyssen,Thyssen’s U.S. partners were, of course, prominent members of the Wall Streetfinancial establishment. Edward Henry Harriman, the nineteenth-century railroadmagnate, had two sons, W. Averell Harriman (born in 1891), and E. RolandHarriman (born in 1895). In 1917 W. Averell Harriman was a director of GuarantyTrust Company and he was involved in the Bolshevik Revolution.16[bm06.html#ch7fn16] According to his biographer, Averell started at the bottomof the career ladder as a clerk and section hand after leaving Yale in 1913,then “he moved steadily forward to positions of increasing responsibility in thefields of transportation and finance.”17 [bm06.html#ch7fn17] In addition to hisdirectorship in Guaranty Trust, Harriman formed the Merchant ShipbuildingCorporation in 1917, which soon became the largest merchant fleet under Americanflag. This fleet was disposed of in 1925 and Harriman entered the lucrativeRussian market.18 [bm06.html#ch7fn18]In winding up these Russian deals in 1929, Averell Harriman received a windfallprofit of $1 million from the usually hard-headed Soviets, who have a reputationof giving nothing away without some present or later quid pro quo. Concurrentlywith these successful moves in international finance, Averell Harriman hasalways been attracted by so-called “public” service. In 1913 Harrimans “public”service began with an appointment to the Palisades Park Commission. In 1933Harriman was appointed chairman of the New York State Committee of Employment,and in 1934 became Administrative Officer of Roosevelt’s NRA — theMussolini-like brainchild of General Electric’s Gerard Swope.19[bm06.html#ch7fn19] There followed a stream of “public” offices, first the LendLease programme, then as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, later as Secretary ofCommerce.By contrast, E. Roland Harriman confined his activities to private business ininternational finance without venturing, as did brother Averell, into “public”service. In 1922 Roland and Averell formed W. A. Harriman & Company. Still laterRoland became chairman of the board of Union Pacific Railroad and a director ofNewsweek magazine, Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, a member of theboard of governors of the American Red Cross, and a member of the AmericanMuseum of Natural History.Nazi financier Hendrik Jozef Kouwenhoven, Roland Harrimans fellow-director atUnion Banking Corporation in New York, was managing director of the Bank voorHandel en Scheepvaart N.V. (BHS) of Rotterdam. In 1940 the BHS heldapproximately $2.2 million assets in the Union Banking Corporation, which inturn did most of its business with BHS.20 [bm06.html#ch7fn20] In the 1930sKouwenhoven was also a director of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G., the steelcartel founded with Wall Street funds in the mid-1920s. Like Baron Schröder, hewas a prominent Hitler supporter,Another director of the New York Union Banking Corporation was JohannGroeninger, a German subject with numerous industrial and financial affiliationsinvolving Vereinigte Stahlwerke, the August Thyssen group, and a directorship ofAugust Thyssen Hütte A.G.21 [bm06.html#ch7fn21]This affiliation and mutual business interest between Harriman and the Thysseninterests does not suggest that the Harrimans directly financed Hitler. On theother hand, it does show that the Harrimans were intimately connected withprominent Nazis Kouwenhoven and Groeninger and a Nazi front bank, the Bank voorHandel en Scheepvaart. There is every reason to believe that the Harrimans knewof Thyssen’s support for the Nazis. In the case of the Harrimans, it isimportant to bear in mind their long-lasting and intimate relationship with theSoviet Union and the Harriman’s position at the centre of Roosevelt’s New Dealand the Democratic Party. The evidence suggests that some members of the WallStreet elite are connected with, and certainly have influence with, allsignificant political groupings in the contemporary world socialist spectrum —Soviet socialism, Hitler’s national socialism, and Roosevelt’s New Dealsocialism.Financing Hitler in the March 1933 General ElectionPutting the Georg Bell-Deterding and the Thyssen-Harriman cases to one side, wenow examine the core of Hitler’s backing. In May 1932 the so-called “KaiserhofMeeting” took place between Schmitz of I.G. Farben, Max Ilgner of American I.G.Farben, Kiep of Hamburg-America Line, and Diem of the German Potash Trust. Morethan 500,000 marks was raised at this meeting and deposited to the credit ofRudolf Hess in the Deutsche Bank. It is noteworthy, in light of the “Warburgmyth” described in Chapter Ten that Max Ilgner of the American I.G. Farbencontributed 100,000 RM, or one-fifth of the total. The “Sidney Warburg” bookclaims Warburg involvement in the funding of Hitler, and Paul Warburg was adirector of American I.G. Farben22 [bm06.html#ch7fn22] while Max Warburg was adirector of I.G. Farben.There exists irrefutable documentary evidence of a further role of internationalbankers and industrialists in the financing of the Nazi Party and theVolkspartie for the March 1933 German election. A total of three millionReichmarks was subscribed by prominent firms and businessmen, suitably “washed”through an account at the Delbrück Schickler Bank, and then passed into thehands of Rudolf Hess for use by Hitler and the NSDAP. This transfer of funds wasfollowed by the Reichstag fire, abrogation of constitutional rights, andconsolidation of Nazi power. Access to the Reichstag by the arsonists wasobtained through a tunnel from a house where Putzi Hanfstaengl was staying; theReichstag fire itself was used by Hitler as a pretext to abolish constitutionalrights. In brief, within a few weeks of the major funding of Hitler there was alinked sequence of major events: the financial contribution from prominentbankers and industrialists to the 1933 election, burning of the Reichstag,abrogation of constitutional rights, and subsequent seizure of power by the NaziParty.The fund-raising meeting was held February 20,1933 in the home of Goering, whowas then president of the Reichstag, with Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht actingas host. Among those present, according to I.G. Farben’s von Schnitzler, were:Krupp von Bohlen, who, in the beginning of 1933, was president of theReichsverband der Deutschen Industrie Reich Association of German Industry; Dr.Albert Voegler, the leading man of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke; Von Loewenfeld;Dr. Stein, head of the Gewerkschaft Auguste-Victoria, a mine which belongs tothe IG.23 [bm06.html#ch7fn23]Hitler expounded his political views to the assembled businessmen in a lengthytwo-and-one-half hour speech, using the threat of Communism and a Communisttake-over to great effect:It is not enough to say we do not want Communism in our economy. If we continueon our old political course, then we shall perish . ... It is the noblest taskof the leader to find ideals that are stronger than the factors that pull thepeople together. I recognized even while in the hospital that one had to searchfor new ideals conducive to reconstruction. I found them in nationalism, in thevalue of personality, and in the denial of reconciliation between nations ....Now we stand before the last election. Regardless of the outcome, there will beno retreat, even if the coming election does not bring about decision, one wayor another. If the election does not decide, the decision must be brought aboutby other means. I have intervened in order to give the people once more thechance to decide their fate by themselves ....There are only two possibilities, either to crowd back the opponent onconstitutional grounds, and for this purpose once more this election; or astruggle will be conducted with other weapons, which may demand greatersacrifices. I hope the German people thus recognize the greatness of the hour.24[bm06.html#ch7fn24]After Hitler had spoken, Krupp von Bohlen expressed the support of the assembledindustrialists and bankers in the concrete form of a three-million-markpolitical fund. It turned out to be more than enough to acquire power, because600,000 marks remained unexpended after the election.Hjalmar Schacht organized this historic meeting. We have previously describedSchacht’s links with the United States: his father was cashier for the BerlinBranch of Equitable Assurance, and Hjalmar was intimately involved almost on amonthly basis with Wall Street.The largest contributor to the fund was I.G. Farben, which committed itself for30 percent (or 500,000 marks) of the total. Director A. Steinke, of BUBIAG(Braunkohlen-u. Brikett-Industrie A.G.), an I.G. Farben subsidiary, personallycontributed another 200,000 marks. In brief, 45 percent of the funds for the1933 election came from I.G. Farben. If we look at the directors of AmericanI.G. Farben — the U.S. subsidiary of I.G. Farben — we get close to the roots ofWall Street involvement with Hitler. The board of American I.G. Farben at thistime contained some of the most prestigious names among American industrialists:Edsel B. Ford of the Ford Motor Company, C.E. Mitchell of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, and Walter Teagle, director of the Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, and President Franklin D.Roosevelt’s Georgia Warm Springs Foundation.Paul M. Warburg, first director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York andchairman of the Bank of Manhattan, was a Farben director and in Germany hisbrother Max Warburg was also a director of I.G. Farben. H. A. Metz of I.G.Farben was also a director of the Warburg’s Bank of Manhattan. Finally, CarlBosch of American I.G. Farben was also a director of Ford Motor Company A-G inGermany,Three board members of American I.G. Farben were found guilty at the NurembergWar Crimes Trials: Max Ilgner, F. Ter Meer, and Hermann Schmitz. As we havenoted, the American board members — Edsel Ford, C. E. Mitchell, Walter Teagle,and Paul Warburg — were not placed on trial at Nuremberg, and so far as therecords are concerned, it appears that they were not even questioned about theirknowledge of the 1933 Hitler fund.The 1933 Political ContributionsWho were the industrialists and bankers who placed election funds at thedisposal of the Nazi Party in 1933? The list of contributors and the amount oftheir contribution is as follows:FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO HITLER: Feb. 23-Mar. 13, 1933:(The Hjalmar Schacht account at Delbrück, Schickler Bank)Political Contributions by Firms (with selected affiliated directors)AmountPledgedPercent of Firm Total Verein fuer die Bergbaulichen Interessen(Kirdorf)$600,00045.8 I.G.

Springorum (Chairman:Eisen-und Stahlwerke Hoesch A.G.)36,000Source-. See Appendix for translation of original document.How can we prove that these political payments actually took place?The payments to Hitler in this final step on the road to dictatorial Naziismwere made through the private bank of Delbrück Schickler. The Delbrück SchicklerBank was a subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft A.G. (“Metall”), an industrialgiant, the largest non-ferrous metal company in Germany, and the dominantinfluence in the world’s non-ferrous metal trading. The principal shareholdersof “Metall” were I.G. Farben and the British Metal Corporation. We might noteincidentally that the British directors on the “Metall” Aufsichsrat were WalterGardner (Amalgamated Metal Corporation) and Captain Oliver Lyttelton (also onthe board of Amalgamated Metal and paradoxically later in World War II to becomethe British Minister of Production).There exists among the Nuremberg Trial papers the original transfer slips fromthe banking division of I.G. Farben and other firms listed above to the DelbrückSchickler Bank in Berlin, informing the bank of the transfer of funds fromDresdner Bank, and other banks, to their Nationale Treuhand (NationalTrusteeship) account. This account was disbursed by Rudolf Hess for Nazi Partyexpenses during the election. Translation of the I.G. Farben transfer slip,selected as a sample, is as follows:25 [bm06.html#ch7fn25]Translation of I.G. Farben letter of February 27, 1933, advising of transfer of400,000 Reichsmarks to National Trusteeship account:I.G. FARBENINDUSTRIE AKTIENGESELLSCHAFTBank Departmentimage [images/pg112.jpg]By special delivery.26 [bm06.html#ch7fn26]At this juncture we should take note of the efforts that have been made todirect our attention away from American financiers (and German financiersconnected with American-affiliated companies) who were involved with the fundingof Hitler. Usually the blame for financing Hitler has been exclusively placedupon Fritz Thyssen or Emil Kirdorf. In the case of Thyssen this blame was widelycirculated in a book allegedly authored by Thyssen in the middle of World War IIbut later repudiated by him,27 [bm06.html#ch7fn27] Why Thyssen would want toadmit such actions before the defeat of Naziism is unexplained.Emil Kirdorf, who died in 1937, was always proud of his association with therise of Naziism. The attempt to limit Hitler financing to Thyssen and Kirdorfextended into the Nuremberg trials in 1946, and was challenged only by theSoviet delegate. Even the Soviet delegate was unwilling to produce evidence ofAmerican associations; this is not surprising because the Soviet Union dependson the goodwill of these same financiers to transfer much needed advancedWestern technology to the U.S.S.R.At Nuremberg, statements were made and allowed to go unchallenged which weredirectly contrary to the known direct evidence presented above. For example,Buecher, Director General of German General Electric, was absolved from sympathyfor Hitler:Thyssen has confessed his error like a man and has courageously paid a heavypenalty for it. On the other side stand men like Reusch of theGutehoffnungshuette, Karl Bosch, the late chairman of the I.G. FarbenAufsichtsrat, who would very likely have come to a sad end, had he not died intime. Their feelings were shared by the deputy chairman of the Aufsichtsrat ofKalle. The Siemens and AEG companies which, next to I.G. Farben, were the mostpowerful German concerns, and they were determined opponents of nationalsocialism.I know that this unfriendly attitude on the part of the Siemens concern to theNazis resulted in the firm receiving rather rough treatment. The DirectorGeneral of the AEG (Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft), Geheimrat Buecher,whom I knew from my stay in the colonies, was anything but a Nazi. I can assureGeneral Taylor that it is certainly wrong to assert that the leadingindustrialists as such favoured Hitler before his seizure of power.28[bm06.html#ch7fn28]Yet we reproduce a document No. 391–395 originating with General Electric,transferring General Electric funds to the National Trusteeship accountcontrolled by Rudolf Hess on behalf of Hitler and used in the 1933 elections.Similarly, von Schnitzler, who was present at the February 1933 meeting onbehalf of I.G. Farben, denied I.G. Farben’s contributions to the 1933 NationaleTreuhand:I never heard again of the whole matter [that of financing Hitler], but Ibelieve that either the buro of Goering or Schacht or the Reichsverband derDeutschen Industrie had asked the office of Bosch or Schmitz for payment of IG’sshare in the election fund. As I did not take the matter up again I not even atthat time knew whether and which amount had been paid by the IG. According tothe volume of the IG, I should estimate IG’s share being something like 10percent of the election fund, but as far as I know there is no evidence thatI.G. Farben participated in the payments.29 [bm06.html#ch7fn29]As we have seen, the evidence is incontrovertible regarding political cashcontributions to Hitler at the crucial point of the takeover of power in Germany— and Hitler’s earlier speech to the industrialists clearly revealed that acoercive takeover was the premeditated intent.We know exactly who contributed, how much, and through what channels. It isnotable that the largest contributors — I.G. Farben, German General Electric(and its affiliated company Osram), and Thyssen – were affiliated with WallStreet financiers. These Wall Street financiers were at the heart of thefinancial elite and they were prominent in contemporary American politics.Gerard Swope of General Electric was author of Roosevelt’s New Deal, Teagle wasone of NRA’s top administrators, Paul Warburg and his associates at AmericanI.G. Farben were Roosevelt advisers. It is perhaps not an extraordinarycoincidence that Roosevelt’s New Deal — called a “fascist measure” by HerbertHoover — should have so closely resembled Hitler’s programme for Germany, andthat both Hitler and Roosevelt took power in the same month of the same year –March 1933."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTPutzi: Friend of Hitler and RooseveltErnst Sedgwick Hanfstaengl (or Hanfy or Putzi, as he was more usually called),like Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, was another German-American at the core ofthe rise of Hitlerism. Hanfstaengl was born into a well-known New Englandfamily; he was a cousin of Civil War General John Sedgwick and a grandson ofanother Civil War General, William Heine. Introduced to Hitler in the early1920s by Captain Truman-Smith, the U.S. Military Attaché in Berlin, Putzi becamean ardent Hitler supporter, on occasion financed the Nazis and, according toAmbassador William Dodd, “... is said to have saved Hitler’s life in 1923.”1[bm06.html#ch8fn1]By coincidence, S.S. leader Heinrich Himmler’s father was also Putzi’s formmaster at the Royal Bavarian Wilhelms gymnasium. Putzi’s student day friends atHarvard University were “such outstanding future figures” as Walter Lippmann,John Reed (who figures prominently in Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution),and Franklin D. Roosevelt. After a few years at Harvard, Putzi established thefamily art business in New York; it was a delightful combination of business andpleasure, for as he says, “the famous names who visited me were legion, PierpontMorgan, Toscanini, Henry Ford, Caruso, Santos-Dumont, Charlie Chaplin,Paderewski, and a daughter of President Wilson.”2 [bm06.html#ch8fn2] It was alsoat Harvard that Putzi made friends with the future President Franklin DelanoRoosevelt:I took most of my meals at the Harvard Club, where I made friends with the youngFranklin D. Roosevelt, at that time a rising New York State Senator. Also Ireceived several invitations to visit his distant cousin Teddy, the formerPresident, who had retired to his estate at Sagamore Hill.3 [bm06.html#ch8fn3]From these varied friendships (or perhaps after reading this book and itspredecessors, Wall Street and FDR and Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution,the reader may consider Putzi’s friendship to have been confined to a peculiarlyelitist circle), Putzi became not only an early friend, backer and financier ofHitler, but among those early Hitler supporters he was, “... almost the onlyperson who crossed the lines of his (Hitler’s) groups of acquaintances.”4[bm06.html#ch8fn4]In brief, Putzi was an American citizen at the heart of the Hitler entouragefrom the early 1920s to the late 1930s. In 1943, after falling out of favourwith the Nazis and interned by the Allies, Putzi was bailed out of the miseriesof a Canadian prisoner of war camp by his friend and protector PresidentFranklin D. Roosevelt. When FDR’s actions threatened to become an internalpolitical problem in the United States, Putzi was re-interned in England. As ifit is not surprising enough to find both Heinrich Himmler and Franklin D.Roosevelt prominent in Putzi’s life, we also discover that the Nazi stormtrooper marching songs were composed by Hanfstaengl, “including the one that wasplayed by the brownshirt columns as they marched through the Brandenburger Toron the day Hitler took over power.”5 [bm06.html#ch8fn5] To top this eye-opener,Putzi averred that the genesis of the Nazi chant “Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil,” used inthe Nazi mass rallies, was none other than “Harvard, Harvard, Harvard, rah, rah,rah.”6 [bm06.html#ch8fn6]Putzi certainly helped finance the first Nazi daily press, the VolkischeBeobachter. Whether he saved Hitler’s life from the Communists is lessverifiable, and while kept out of the actual writing process of Mein Kampf —much to his disgust — Putzi did have the honour to finance its publication, “andthe fact that Hitler found a functioning staff when he was released from jailwas entirely due to our efforts.”7 [bm06.html#ch8fn7]When Hitler came to power in March 1933, simultaneously with Franklin DelanoRoosevelt in Washington, a private “emissary” was sent from Roosevelt inWashington, D.C. to Hanfstaengl in Berlin, with a message to the effect that asit appeared Hitler would soon achieve power in Germany, Roosevelt hoped, in viewof their long acquaintance, that Putzi would do his best to prevent any rashnessand hot-headedness. “Think of your piano playing and try and use the soft pedalif things get too loud,” was FDR’s message. “If things start getting awkwardplease get in touch with our ambassador at once.”8 [bm06.html#ch8fn8]Hanfstaengl kept in close touch with the American Ambassador in Berlin, WilliamE. Dodd—apparently much to his disgust, because Putzi’s recorded comments onDodd are distinctly unflattering:In many ways, he [Dodd] was an unsatisfactory representative. He was a modestlittle Southern history professor, who ran his embassy on a shoestring and wasprobably trying to save money out of his pay. At a time when it needed a robustmillionaire to compete with the flamboyance of the Nazis, he teetered aroundself-effacingly as if he were still on his college campus. His mind and hisprejudices were small.9 [bm06.html#ch8fn9]In point of fact Ambassador Dodd pointedly tried to decline Roosevelt’sAmbassadorial appointment. Dodd had no inheritance and preferred to live on hisState Department pay rather than political spoils; unlike the politician Doddwas particular from whom he received money. In any event, Dodd commented equallyharshly on Putzi, “. . . he gave money to Hitler in 1923, helped him write MeinKampf, and was in every way familiar with Hitler’s motives. . . .”Was Hanfstaengl an agent for the Liberal Establishment in the U.S.? We canprobably rule out this possibility because, according to Ladislas Farago, it wasPutzi who blew the whistle on top-level British penetration of the Hitlercommand. Farago reports that Baron William S. de Ropp had penetrated the highestNazi echelons in pre-World War II days and Hitler used de Ropp “. . . as hisconfidental consultant about British affairs.”10 [bm06.html#ch8fn10] De Ropp wassuspected as being a double agent only by Putzi. According to Farago:The only person . . . who ever suspected him of such duplicity and cautioned theFuehrer about him was the erratic Putzi Hanfstaengl, the Harvard educated chiefof Hitler s office dealing with the foreign press.As Farago notes, “Bill de Ropp was playing the game in both camps—a double agentat the very top.”11 [bm06.html#ch8fn11] Putzi was equally diligent in warninghis friends, the Hermann Goerings, about potential spies in their camp. Witnessthe following extract from Putzi’s memoirs, in which he points the accusingfinger of espionage at the Goerings’ gardener:“Hermann,” I said one day, “I will bet any money that fellow Greinz is a policespy.” “Now really, Putzi,” Karin [Mrs. Hermann Goering] broke in, “he’s such anice fellow and he’s a wonderful gardener.” “He’s doing exactly what a spy oughtto do,” I told her, “he has made himself indispensable.”12 [bm06.html#ch8fn12]By 1941 Putzi was out of favour with Hitler and the Nazis, fled Germany, and wasinterned in a Canadian prisoner of war camp. With Germany and the United Statesnow ar war Putzi re-calculated the odds and concluded, “Now I knew for certainthat Germany would be defeated.”13 [bm06.html#ch8fn13] Putzi’s release from thePOW camp came with the personal intervention of old friend President Roosevelt:One day a correspondent of the Hearst press named Kehoe obtained permission tovisit Fort Henry. I managed to have a few words with him in a corner. “I knowyour boss well,” I told him. “Will you do me a small service?” Fortunately herecognized my name.I gave him a letter, which he slipped into his pocket. It was addressed to theAmerican Secretary of State, Cordell Hull. A few days later it was on the deskof my Harvard Club friend, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In it I offered to act asa political and psychological warfare adviser in the war against Germany.14[bm06.html#ch8fn14]The response and offer to “work” for the American side was accepted. Putzi wasinstalled in comfortable surroundings with his son, U.S. Army Sergeant EgonHanfstaengl, also there as a personal aide. In 1944, under pressure of aRepublican threat to blow the whistle on Roosevelt’s favouritism for a formerNazi, Egon was shipped out to New Guinea and Putzi hustled off to England, wherethe British promptly interned him for the duration of the war, Roosevelt or noRoosevelt.Putzi’s Role in the Reichstag FirePutzi’s friendships and political manipulations may or may not be of any greatconsequence, but his role in the Reichstag fire is significant.The firing of the Reichstag on February 27, 1933 is one of the key events ofmodern times. The fire was used by Adolf Hitler to claim imminent Communistrevolution, suspend constitutional rights, and seize totalitarian power. Fromthat point on there was no turning back for Germany; the world was set upon thecourse to World War II.At the time the firing of the Reichstag was blamed on the Communists, but thereis little question in historical perspective that the fire was deliberately setby the Nazis to provide an excuse to seize political power. Fritz Thyssencommented in the post-war Dustbin interrogations:When the Reichstag was burned, everyone was sure it had been done by thecommunists. I later learned in Switzerland that it was all a lie.15[bm06.html#ch8fn15]Schacht states quite emphatically:Nowadays it would be quite clear that this action could not be fastened on theCommunist Party. To what extent individual National Socialists co-operated inthe planning and execution of the deed will be difficult to establish, but inview of all that has been revealed in the meantime, the fact must be acceptedthat Goebbels and Goering each played a leading part, the one in planning, theother in carrying out the plan.16 [bm06.html#ch8fn16]The Reichstag fire was deliberately set, probably utilizing a flammable liquid,by a group of experts. This is where Putzi Hanfstaengl comes into the picture.The key question is how did this group, bent on arson, gain access to theReichstag to do the job? After 8 p.m. only one door in the main building wasunlocked and this door was guarded. Just before 9 p.m. a tour of the building bywatchmen indicated all was well; no flammable liquids were noticed and nothingwas out of the ordinary in the Sessions Chamber where the fire started.Apparently no one could have gained access to the Reichstag building after 9p.m., and no one was seen to enter or leave between 9 p.m. and the start of thefire.There was only one way a group with flammable materials could have entered theReichstag — through a tunnel that ran between the Reichstag and the Palace ofthe Reichstag President. Hermann Goering was president of the Reichstag andlived in the Palace, and numerous S.A. and S.S. men were known to be in thePalace. In the words of one author:The use of the underground passage, with all its complications, was possibleonly to National-Socialists, the advance and escape of the incendiary gang wasfeasible only with the connivance of highly-placed employees of the Reichstag.Every clue, every probability points damningly in one direction, to theconclusion that the burning of the Reichstag was the work ofNational-Socialists.17 [bm06.html#ch8fn17]How does Putzi Hanfstaengl fit into this picture of arson and politicalintrigue?Putzi — by his own admission — was in the Palace room at the other end of thetunnel leading to the Reichstag. And according to The Reichstag Fire Trial,Putzi Hanfstaengl was actually in the Palace itself during the fire:Hanfstaengl directed operations within the Palace, the propaganda apparatusstood ready, and the leaders of the Storm Troopers were in their places. Withthe official bulletins planned in advance, the orders of arrest prepared,Karwahne, Frey and Kroyer waiting patiently in their cafe, the preparations werecomplete, the scheme almost perfect.18 [bm06.html#ch8fn18]Dimitrov also asserts that:The National-Socialist leaders, Hitler, Goering and Goebbels, together with thehigh National-Socialist officials, Daluege, Hanfstaengl and Albrecht, happenedto be present in Berlin on the day of the fire, despite that the electioncampaign was at its highest pitch throughout Germany, six days before the poll.Goering and Goebbels, under oath, furnished contradictory explanations for their“fortuitous” presence in Berlin with Hitler on that day. The National-SocialistHanfstaengl, as Goering’s “guest,” was present in the Palace of the ReichstagPresident, immediately adjacent to the Reichstag, at the time when the firebroke out, although his “host” was not there at that time.19 [bm06.html#ch8fn19]According to Nazi Kurt Ludecke, there once existed a document signed by S.A.Leader Karl Ernst — who supposedly set the fire and was later murdered by fellowNazis — which implicated Goering, Goebbels, and Hanfstaengl in the conspiracy,Roosevelt’s New Deal and Hitler’s New OrderHjalmar Schacht challenged his post-war Nuremberg interrogators with theobservation that Hitler’s New Order programme was the same as Roosevelt’s NewDeal programme in the United States. The interrogators understandably snortedand rejected the observation. However, a little research suggests that not onlyare the two programmes quite similar in content, but that Germans had no troublein observing the similarities. There is in the Roosevelt Library a small bookpresented to FDR by Dr. Helmut Magers in December 1933.20 [bm06.html#ch8fn20] Onthe flyleaf of this presentation copy is written the inscription,To the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in profoundadmiration of his conception of a new economic order and with devotion for hispersonality. The author, Baden, Germany, November 9, 1933.FDR’s reply to this admiration for his new economic order was as follows:21[bm06.html#ch8fn21](Washington) December 19, 1933My dear Dr. Magers: I want to send you my thanks for the copy of your littlebook about me and the “New Deal.” Though, as you know, I went to school inGermany and could speak German with considerable fluency at one time, 1 amreading your book not only with great interest but because it will help myGerman.Very sincerely yours,The New Deal or the “new economic order” was not a creature of classicalliberalism. It was a creature of corporate socialism. Big business as reflectedin Wall Street strived for a state order in which they could control industryand eliminate competition, and this was the heart of FDR’s New Deal. GeneralElectric, for example, is prominent in both Nazi Germany and the New Deal.German General Electric was a prominent financier of Hitler and the Nazi Party,and A.E.G. also financed Hitler both directly and indirectly through Osram.International General Electric in New York was a major participant in theownership and direction of both A.E.G. and Osram. Gerard Swope, Owen Young, andA. Baldwin of General Electric in the United States were directors of A.E.G.However, the story does not stop at General Electric and financing of Hitler in1933.In a previous book, Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, the authoridentified the role of General Electric in the Bolshevik Revolution and thegeographic location of American participants as at 120 Broadway, New York City;the executive offices of General Electric were also at 120 Broadway. WhenFranklin Delano Roosevelt was working in Wall Street, his address was also 120Broadway. In fact, Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, the FDR Foundation, waslocated at 120 Broadway. The prominent financial backer of an early RooseveltWall Street venture from 120 Broadway was Gerard Swope of General Electric. Andit was “Swope’s Plan” that became Roosevelt’s New Deal — the fascist plan thatHerbert Hoover was unwilling to foist on the United States. In brief, bothHitler’s New Order and Roosevelt’s New Deal were backed by the sameindustrialists and in content were quite similar — i.e., they were both plansfor a corporate state.There were then both corporate and individual bridges between FDR’s America andHitler’s Germany. The first bridge was the American I.G. Farben, Americanaffiliate of I.G. Farben, the largest German corporation. On the board ofAmerican I.G. sat Paul Warburg, of the Bank of Manhattan and the Federal ReserveBank of New York. The second bridge was between International General Electric,a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric Company and its partly ownedaffiliate in Germany, A.E.G. Gerard Swope, who formulated FDR’s New Deal, waschairman of I.G.E. and on the board of A.E.G. The third “bridge” was betweenStandard Oil of New Jersey and Vacuum Oil and its wholly owned Germansubsidiary, Deutsche-Amerikanische Gesellschaft. The chairman of Standard Oil ofNew Jersey was Walter Teagle, of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He was atrustee of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Georgia Warm Springs Foundation andappointed by FDR to a key administrative post in the National RecoveryAdministration.These corporations were deeply involved in both the promotion of Roosevelt’s NewDeal and the construction of the military power of Nazi Germany. PutziHanfstaengl’s role in the early days, up to the mid-1930s anyway, was aninformal link between the Nazi elite and the White House. After the mid-1930s,when the world was set on the course for war, Putzi’s importance declined —while American Big Business continued to be represented through suchintermediaries as Baron Kurt von Schröder attorney Westrick, and membership inHimmler’s Circle of Friends."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINEWall Street and the Nazi Inner CircleDuring the entire period of our business contacts we had no inkling of Farben’sconniving part in Hitler’s brutal policies. We offer any help we can give to seethat complete truth is brought to light and that rigid justice is done. (F.W.Abrams, Chairman of the Board, Standard Oil of New Jersey, 1946.)Adolf Hitler, Hermann Goering, Josef Goebbels, and Heinrich Himmler, the innergroup of Naziism, were at the same time heads of minor fiefdoms within the NaziState. Power groups or political cliques were centred around these Nazi leaders,more importantly after the late 1930s around Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler,Reich-Leader of the S.S. (the dreaded Schutzstaffel). The most important ofthese Nazi inner circles was created by order of the Fuehrer; it was known firstas the Keppler Circle and later as Himmler’s Circle of Friends.The Keppler Circle originated as a group of German businessmen supportingHitler’s rise to power before and during 1933. In the mid-1930s the KepplerCircle came under the influence and protection of S.S. chief Himmler and theorganizational control of Cologne banker and prominent Nazi businessman Kurt vonSchröder. Schröder, it will be recalled, was head of the J.H. Stein Bank inGermany and affiliated with the J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation of NewYork. It is within this innermost of the inner circles, the very core ofNaziism, that we find Wall Street, including Standard Oil of New Jersey andI.T.T., represented from 1933 to as late as 1944.Wilhelm Keppler, founder of the original Circle of Friends, typifies thewell-known phenomenon of a politicized businessman — i.e., a businessman whocultivates the political arena rather than the impartial marketplace for hisprofits. Such businessmen have been interested in promoting socialist causes,because a planned socialist society provides a most lucrative opportunity forcontracts through political influence.Scenting such profitable opportunities, Keppler joined the national socialistsand was close to Hitler before 1933. The Circle of Friends grew out of a meetingbetween Adolf Hitler and Wilhelm Keppler in December 1931. During the course oftheir conversation — this was several years before Hitler became dictator — thefuture Fuehrer expressed a wish to have reliable German businessmen availablefor economic advice when the Nazis took power. “Try to get a few economicleaders — they need not be Party members — who will be at our disposal when wecome into power.”1 [bm06.html#ch9fn1] This Keppler undertook to do.In March 1933 Keppler was elected to the Reichstag and became Hitler’s financialexpert. This lasted only briefly. Keppler was replaced by the infinitely morecapable Hjalmar Schacht, and sent to Austria where in 1938 he became ReichsCommissioner, but still able to use his position to acquire considerable powerin the Nazi State. Within a few years he captured a string of lucrativedirectorships in German firms, including chairman of the board of two I.G.Farben subsidiaries: Braunkohle-Benzin A.G. and Kontinental Oil A.G.Braunkohle-Benzin was the German exploiter of the Standard Oil of New Jerseytechnology for production of gasoline from coal. (See Chapter Four[chapter04.html#ch4].)In brief, Keppler was the chairman of the very firm that utilized Americantechnology for the indispensible synthetic gasoline which enabled the Wehrmachtto go to war in 1939. This is significant because, when linked with otherevidence presented in this chapter, it suggests that the profits and control ofthese fundamentally important technologies for German military ends wereretained by a small group of international firms and businessmen operatingacross national borders,Keppler’s nephew, Fritz Kranefuss, under his uncle’s protection, also gainedprominence both as Adjutant to S.S. Chief Heinrich Himmler and as a businessmanand political operator. It was Kranefuss’ link with Himmler which led to theKeppler circle gradually drawing away from Hitler in the 1930s to come withinHimmler’s orbit, where in exchange for annual donations to Himmler’s pet S.S.projects Circle members received political favours and not inconsiderableprotection from the S.S.Baron Kurt von Schröder was, as we have noted, the I.T.T. representative in NaziGermany and an early member of the Keppler Circle. The original Keppler Circleconsisted of:THE ORIGINAL (PRE-1932) MEMBERS OF THE KEPPLER CIRCLE Circle MemberMain Associations Wilhelm KEPPLERChairman of I.G. Farbensubsidiary Braunkohle-Benzin A.G.

Circle of FriendsThis original Circle of Friends met with Hitler in May 1932 and heard astatement of Nazi objectives. Heinrich Himmler then became a frequentparticipant in the meetings, and through Himmler, various S.S. officers as wellas other businessmen joined the group. This expanded group in time becameHimmler’s Circle of Friends, with Himmler acting as protector and expeditor forits members.Consequently, banking and industrial interests — including American interests —were heavily represented in the inner circle of Naziism, and their pre-1933financial contributions to Hitlerism which we have earlier enumerated were amplyrepaid. Of the “Big Five” German banks, the Dresdner Bank had the closestconnections with the Nazi Party: at least a dozen members of Dresdner Bank’sboard of directors had high Nazi rank and no fewer than seven Dresdner Bankdirectors were among Keppler’s expanded Circle of Friends, which never exceeded40.When we examine the names comprising both the original pre-1933 Keppler Circleand the post-1933 expanded Keppler and Himmler’s Circle, we find the Wall Streetmultinationals heavily represented — more so than any other institutional group.Let us take each Wall Street multinational or its German associate in turn —those identified in Chapter Seven as linked to financing Hitler — and examinetheir links to Keppler and Heinrich Himmler.I.G. Farben and the Keppler CircleI.G. Farben was heavily represented within the Keppler Circle: no fewer thaneight out of the peak circle membership of 40 were directors of I.G. Farben or aFarben subsidiary. These eight members included the previously described WilhelmKeppler and his nephew Kranefuss, in addition to Baron Kurt von Schröder. TheFarben presence was emphasized by member Hermann Schmitz, chairman of I.G.Farben and a director of Vereinigte Stahlwerke, both cartels built andconsolidated by the Wall Street loans of the 1920s. A U.S. Congressional reportdescribed Hermann Schmitz as follows:Hermann Schmitz, one of the most important persons in Germany, has achievedoutstanding success simultaneously in the three separate fields, industry,finance, and government, and has served with zeal and devotion every governmentin power, He symbolizes the German citizen who out of the devastation of theFirst World War made possible the Second.Ironically, his may be said to be the greater guilt in that in 1919 he was amember of the Reich’s peace delegation, and in the 1930s was in a position toteach the Nazis much that they had to know concerning economic penetration,cartel uses, synthetic materials for war.2 [bm06.html#ch9fn2]Another Keppler Circle member on the I.G. Farben board was Friedrich Flick,creator of the steel cartel Vereinigte Stahlwerke and a director of AllianzVersicherungs A.G. and German General Electric (A.E.G.). Heinrich Schmidt, adirector of Dresdner Bank and chairman of the board of I.G. Farben subsidiaryBraunkohle-Benzin A.G., was in the circle; so was Karl Rasche, another directorof the Dresdner Bank and a director of Metallgesellschaft (parent of theDelbrück Schickler Bank) and Accu-mulatoren-Fabriken A.G. Heinrich Buetefischwas also a director of I.G. Farben and a member of the Keppler Circle. In brief,the I.G. Farben contribution to Rudolf Hess’ Nationale Treuhand — the politicalslush fund — was confirmed after the 1933 takeover by heavy representation inthe Nazi inner circle,How many of these Keppler Circle members in the I.G.

CircleMajor U.S. multinationals were also very well represented in the later HeinrichHimmler Circle and made cash contributions to the S.S. (the Sonder Konto S) upto 1944 — while World War II was in progress.Almost a quarter of the 1944 Sonder Konto S contributions came from subsidiariesof International Telephone and Telegraph, represented by Kurt von Schröder. The1943 payments from I.T.T. subsidiaries to the Special Account were as follows:Mix & Genest A.G. 5,000 RM C. Lorenz AG20,000 RM Felten & Guilleaume25,000 RMKurt von Schröder16,000 RMAnd the 1944 payments were:Mix & Genest A.G 5,000 RM C.

Emil H.Meyer, S.S. Untersturmfuehrer, member of the Vorstand of the Dresdner Bank,A.E.G., and a director of all the I.T.T. subsidiaries in Germany, was also amember of the Himmler Circle of Friends — giving I.T.T. two powerfulrepresentatives at the heart of the S.S.A letter to fellow member Emil Meyer from Baron von Schröder dated February 25,1936 describes the purposes and requirements of the Himmler Circle and thelong-standing nature of the Special Account ‘S’ with funds at Schröder’s ownbank — the J.H.

In Munich it was decidedthat the undersigned would make themselves available for setting up and handlingthis account. In the meantime the account was set up and we want everyparticipant to know that in case he wants to make contributions to the ReichLeader for the aforementioned tasks — either on behalf of his firm or the Circleof Friends — payments may be made to the banking firm J.H. Stein, Cologne(Clearing Account of the Reich Bank, Postal Checking Acount No. 1392) to theSpecial Account S.Heil Hitler!(Signed) Kurt Baron von Schröder(Signed) Steinbrinck3 [bm06.html#ch9fn3]This letter also explains why U.S. Army Colonel Bogdan, formerly of the SchroderBanking Corporation in New York, was anxious to divert the attention of post-warU.S. Army investigators away from the J. H. Stein Bank in Cologne to the “biggerbanks” of Nazi Germany. It was the Stein Bank that held the secrets of theassociations of American subsidiaries with Nazi authorities while World War IIwas in progress. The New York financial interests could not know the precisenature of these transactions (and particularly the nature of any records thatmay have been kept by their German associates), but they knew that some recordcould well exist of their war-time dealings — enough to embarrass them with theAmerican public. It was this possibility that Colonel Bogdan triedunsuccessfully to head off,German General Electric profited greatly from its association with Himmler andother leading Nazis. Several members of the Schröder clique were directors ofA.E.G., the most prominent being Robert Pferdmenges, who was not only a memberof the Keppler or Himmler Circles but was a partner in the aryanized bankinghouse Pferdmenges & Company, the successor to the former Jewish banking houseSal Oppenheim of Cologne. Waldemar von Oppenheim achieved the dubiousdistinction (for a German Jew) of “honorary Aryan” and was able to continue hisold established banking house under Hitler in partnership with Pferdmenges,MEMBERS OF THE HIMMLER CIRCLE OF FRIENDS WHO WERE ALSO DIRECTORS OFAMERICAN-AFFILIATED FIRMS: I.G.

In 1943 and 1944 DAG contributed asfollows: Staatsrat Helffrich of Deutsch-Amerikanische Petroleum A.G.10,000 RMStaatsrat Lindemann of Deutsch-Amerikanische Petroleum A.G.10,000 RM andpersonally 4,000 RMIt is important to note that Staatsrat Lindemann contributed 4,000 RMpersonally, thus making a clear distinction between the corporate contributionof 10,000 RM from Standard Oil of New Jersey’s wholly owned subsidiary and thepersonal contribution from director Lindemann. In the case of StaatsratHelffrich, the only contribution was the Standard Oil contribution of 10,000 RM;there is no recorded personal donation.I.G. Farben, parent company of American I.G. (see Chapter Two[chapter02.html#ch2]), was another significant contributor to Heinrich Himmler’sSonder Konto S. There were four I.G. Farben directors within the inner circle:Karl Rasche, Fritz Kranefuss, Heinrich Schmidt, and Heinrich Buetefisch. KarlRasche was a member of the management committee of the Dresdner Bank and aspecialist in international law and banking. Under Hitler Karl Rasche became aprominent director of many German corporations, including Accumulatoren-FabrikA.G. in Berlin, which financed Hitler; the Metallgesellschaft; and Felten &Guilleaume, an I.T.T. company. Fritz Kranefuss was a member of the board ofdirectors of Dresdner Bank and a director of several corporations besides I.G.Farben. Kranefuss, nephew of Wilhelm Keppler, was a lawyer and prominent in manyNazi public organizations. Heinrich Schmidt, a director of I.G. Farben andseveral other German companies, was also a director of the Dresdner Bank.It is important to note that all three of the above — Rasche, Kranefuss, andSchmidt — were directors of an I.G. Farben subsidiary, Braunkohle-Benzin A.G. —the manufacturer of German synthetic gasoline using Standard Oil technology, aresult of the I.G. Farben-Standard Oil agreements of the early 1930s.In brief, the Wall Street financial elite was well represented in both the earlyKeppler Circle and the later Himmler Circle.5 [bm06.html#ch9fn5]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENThe Myth of “Sidney Warburg”A vital question, only partly resolved, is the extent to which Hitler’saccession to power in 1933 was aided directly by Wall Street financiers. We haveshown with original documentary evidence that there was indirect Americanparticipation and support through German affiliated firms, and (as for examplein the case of I.T.T.) there was a knowledgeable and deliberate effort tobenefit from the support of the Nazi regime. Was this indirect financingextended to direct financing?After Hitler gained power, U.S. firms and individuals worked on behalf ofNaziism and certainly profited from the Nazi state. We know from the diaries ofWilliam Dodd, the American Ambassador to Germany, that in 1933 a stream of WallStreet bankers and industrialists filed through the U.S. Embassy in Berlin,expressing their admiration for Adolf Hitler — and anxious to find ways to dobusiness with the new totalitarian regime. For example, on September 1, 1933Dodd recorded that Henry Manne of the National City Bank and Winthrop W. Aldrichof the Chase Bank both met with Hitler and “these bankers feel they can workwith him.”1 [bm06.html#ch10fn1] Ivy Lee, the Rockefeller public relations agent,according to Dodd “showed himself at once a capitalist and an advocate ofFascism.”2 [bm06.html#ch10fn2]So at least we can identify a sympathetic response to the new Nazi dictatorship,reminiscent of the manner in which Wall Street international bankers greeted thenew Russia of Lenin and Trotsky in 1917.Who Was “Sidney Warburg”?The question posed in this chapter is the accusation that some Wall Streetfinanciers (the Rockefellers and Warburgs specifically have been accused)directly planned and financed Hitler’s takeover in 1933, and that they did thisfrom Wall Street. On this question the so-called myth of “Sidney Warburg” isrelevant. Prominent Nazi Franz von Papen has stated in his Memoirs-.3[bm06.html#ch10fn3]. . . the most documented account of the National Socialists’ sudden acquisitionof funds was contained in a book published in Holland in 1933, by the oldestablished Amsterdam publishing house of Van Holkema & Warendorf, called DeGeldbronnen van Het Nationaal-Socialisme (Drie Gesprekken Met Hitler) under thename “Sidney Warburg.”A book with this title in Dutch by “Sidney Warburg” was indeed published in1933, but remained on the bookstalls in Holland only for a matter of days. Thebook was purged.4 [bm06.html#ch10fn4] One of three surviving original copies wastranslated into English. The translation was at one time deposited in theBritish Museum, but is now withdrawn from public circulation and is unavailablefor research. Nothing is now known of the original Dutch copy upon which thisEnglish translation was based.The second Dutch copy was owned by Chancellor Schuschnigg in Austria, andnothing is known of its present whereabouts. The third Dutch copy found its wayto Switzerland and was translated into German. The German translation hassurvived down to the present day in the Schweizerisches Sozialarchiv in Zurich,Switzerland. A certified copy of the authenticated German translation of thisSwiss survivor was purchased by the author in 1971 and translated into English.It is upon this English translation of the German translation that the text inthis chapter is based.Publication of the “Sidney Warburg” book was duly reported in the New York Times(November 24, 1933) under the title “Hoax on Nazis Feared.” A brief articlenoted that a “Sidney Warburg” pamphlet has appeared in Holland, and the authoris not the son of Felix Warburg. The translator is J. G. Shoup, a Belgiannewspaperman living in Holland. The publishers and Shoup “are wondering if theyhave not been the victims of a hoax.” The Times account adds:The pamphlet repeats an old story to the effect that leading Americans,including John D. Rockefeller, financed Hitler from 1929 to 1932 to the extentof $32,000,000, their motive being “to liberate Germany from the financial gripof France by bringing about a revolution.” Many readers of the pamphlet havepointed out that it contains many inaccuracies.Why was the Dutch original withdrawn from circulation in 1933? Because “SidneyWarburg” did not exist and a “Sidney Warburg” was claimed as the author. Since1933 the “Sidney Warburg” book has been promoted by various parties both as aforgery and as a genuine document. The Warburg family itself has gone to somepains to substantiate its falsity.What does the book report? What does the book claim happened in Germany in theearly 1930s? And do these events have any resemblance to facts we know to betrue from other evidence?From the viewpoint of research methodology it is much more preferable to assumethat the “Sidney Warburg” book is a forgery, unless we can prove the contrary.This is the procedure we shall adopt. The reader may well ask — then why botherto look closely at a possible forgery? There are at least two good reasons,apart from academic curiosity.First, the Warburg claim that the book is a forgery has a curious and vitalflaw. The Warburgs deny as false a book they admit not to have read — nor evenseen. The Warburg denial is limited specifically to non-authorship by a Warburg.This denial is acceptable; but it does not deny or reject the validity of thecontents. The denial merely repudiates authorship.Second, we have already identified I.G. Farben as a key financier and backer ofHitler. We have provided photographic evidence (document No. NI-391–395) of thebank transfer slip for 400,000 marks from I.G. Farben to Hitler’s “NationaleTreuhand” political slush fund account administered by Rudolf Hess. Now it isprobable, almost certain, that “Sidney Warburg” did not exist. On the otherhand, it is a matter of public record that the Warburgs were closely connectedwith I.G. Farben in Germany and the United States. In Germany Max Warburg was adirector of I.G. Farben and in the United States brother Paul Warburg (father ofJames Paul Warburg) was a director of American I.G. Farben. In brief, we haveincontrovertible evidence that some Warburgs, including the father of JamesPaul, the denouncer of the “Sidney Warburg” book, were directors of I.G. Farben.And I.G. Farben is known to have financed Hitler. “Sidney Warburg” was a myth,but I.G. Farben directors Max Warburg and Paul Warburg were not myths. This isreason enough to push further.Let us first summarize the book which James Paul Warburg claims is a forgery.A Synopsis of the Suppressed “Sidney Warburg” BookThe Financial Sources of National Socialism opens with an alleged conversationbetween “Sidney Warburg” and joint author/translator J. G. Shoup. “Warburg”relates why he was handing Shoup an English language manuscript for translationinto Dutch and publication in Holland. In the words of the mythical “SidneyWarburg”:There are moments when I want to turn away from a world of such intrigue,trickery, swindling and tampering with the stock exchange .... Do you know whatI can never understand? How it is possible that people of good and honestcharacter — for which I have ample proof — participate in swindling and fraud,knowing full well that it will affect thousands.Shoup then describes “Sidney Warburg” as “son of one of the largest bankers inthe United States, member of the banking firm Kuhn, Loeb & Co., New York.”“Sidney Warburg” then tells Shoup that he (“Warburg”) wants to record forhistory how national socialism was financed by New York financiers.The first section of the book is entitled simply “1929.” It relates that in 1929Wall Street had enormous credits outstanding in Germany and Austria, and thatthese claims had, for the most part, been frozen. While France was economicallyweak and feared Germany, France was also getting the “lion’s share” ofreparations funds which were actually financed from the United States. In June1929, a meeting took place between the members of the Federal Reserve Bank andleading American bankers to decide what to do about France, and particularly tocheck her call on German reparations. This meeting was attended (according tothe “Warburg” book) by the directors of Guaranty Trust Company, the “Presidents”of the Federal Reserve Banks, in addition to five independent bankers, “youngRockefeller,” and Glean from Royal Dutch Shell. Carter and Rockefeller accordingto the text “dominated the proceedings. The others listened and nodded theirheads.”The general concensus at the bankers’ meeting was that the only way to freeGermany from French financial clutches was by revolution, either Communist orGerman Nationalist. At an earlier meeting it had previously been agreed tocontact Hitler to “try to find out if he were amenable to American financialsupport.” Now Rockefeller reportedly had more recently seen a German-Americanleaflet about the Hitler national socialist movement and the purpose of thissecond meeting was to determine if “Sidney Warburg” was prepared to go toGermany as a courier to make personal contact with Hitler.In return for preferred financial support, Hitler would be expected to conductan “aggressive foreign policy and stir up the idea of revenge against France.”This policy, it was anticipated, would result in a French appeal to the UnitedStates and England for assistance in “international questions involving theeventual German aggression.” Hitler was not to know about the purpose of WallStreet’s assistance. It would be left “to his reason and resourcefulness todiscover the motives behind the proposal.” “Warburg” accepted the proposedmission and left New York for Cherbourg on the Ile de France, “with a diplomaticpassport and letters of recommendation from Carter, Tommy Walker, Rockefeller,Glean and Herbert Hoover.”Apparently, “Sidney Warburg” had some difficulty in meeting Hitler. The AmericanConsul in Munich did not succeed in making contact with the Nazis, and finallyWarburg went directly to Mayor Deutzberg of Munich, “with a recommendation fromthe American Consul,” and a plea to guide Warburg to Hitler. Shoup then presentsextracts from Hitler’s statements at this initial meeting. These extractsinclude the usual Hitlerian anti-Semitic rantings, and it should be noted thatall the anti-Semitic parts in the “Sidney Warburg” book are spoken by Hitler.(This is important because James Paul Warburg claims the Shoup book is totallyanti-Semitic.) Funding of the Nazis was discussed at this meeting and Hitler isreported to insist that funds could not be deposited in a German bank but onlyin a foreign bank at his disposal. Hitler asked for 100 million marks andsuggested that “Sidney Warburg” report on the Wall Street reaction through vonHeydt at Lützowufer, 18 Berlin.5 [bm06.html#ch10fn5]After reporting back to Wall Street, Warburg learned that $24 million was toomuch for the American bankers; they offered $10 million. Warburg contacted vonHeydt and a further meeting was arranged, this time with an “undistinguishedlooking man, introduced to me under the name Frey.” Instructions were given tomake $10 million available at the Mendelsohn & Co. Bank in Amsterdam, Holland.Warburg was to ask the Mendelsohn Bank to make out cheques in marks payable tonamed Nazis in ten German cities. Subsequently, Warburg travelled to Amsterdam,completed his mission with Mendelsohn & Co., then went to Southampton, Englandand took the Olympia back to New York where he reported to Carter at GuarantyTrust Company. Two days later Warburg gave his report to the entire Wall Streetgroup, but “this time an English representative was there sitting next to Gleanfrom Royal Dutch, a man named Angell, one of the heads of the Asiatic PetroleumCo.” Warburg was questioned about Hitler, and “Rockefeller showed unusualinterest in Hitler’s statements about the Communists.”A few weeks after Warburg’s return from Europe the Hearst newspapers showed“unusual interest” in the new German Nazi Party and even the New York Timescarried regular short reports of Hitler’s speeches. Previously these newspapershad not shown too much interest, but that now changed.6 [bm06.html#ch10fn6]Also, in December 1929 a long study of the German National Socialist movementappeared “in a monthly publication at Harvard University.”Part II of the suppressed “Financial Sources of National Socialism” is entitled“1931” and opens with a discussion of French influence on internationalpolitics. It avers that Herbert Hoover promised Pierre Laval of France not toresolve the debt question without first consulting the French government and[writes Shoup]:When Wall Street found out about this Hoover lost the respect of this circle atone blow. Even the subsequent elections were affected — many believed thatHoover’s failure to get re-elected can be traced back to the issue.7[bm06.html#ch10fn7]In October 1931, Warburg received a letter from Hitler which he passed on toCarter at Guaranty Trust Company, and subsequently another bankers’ meeting wascalled at the Guaranty Trust Company offices. Opinions at this meeting weredivided. “Sidney Warburg” reported that Rockefeller, Carter, and McBean were forHitler, while the other financiers were uncertain. Montague Norman of the Bankof England and Glean of Royal Dutch Shell argued that the $10 million alreadyspent on Hitler was too much, that Hitler would never act. The meeting finallyagreed in principle to assist Hitler further, and Warburg again undertook acourier assignment and went back to Germany.On this trip Warburg reportedly discussed German affairs with “a Jewish banker”in Hamburg, with an industrial magnate, and other Hitler supporters. One meetingwas with banker von Heydt and a “Luetgebrunn.” The latter stated that the Nazistorm troopers were incompletely equipped and the S.S. badly needed machineguns, revolvers, and carbines,In the next Warburg-Hitler meeting, Hitler argued that “the Soviets cannot missour industrial products yet. We will give credit, and if I am not able todeflate France myself, then the Soviets will help me.” Hitler said he had twoplans for takeover in Germany: (a) the revolution plan, and (b), the legaltakeover plan. The first plan would be a matter of three months, the second plana matter of three years. Hitler was quoted as saying, “revolution costs fivehundred million marks, legal takeover costs two hundred million marks—what willyour bankers decide?” After five days a cable from Guaranty Trust arrived forWarburg and is cited in the book as follows:Suggested amounts are out of the question. We don’t want to and cannot. Explainto man that such a transfer to Europe will shatter financial market. Absolutelyunknown on international territory. Expect long report, before decision is made.Stay there. Continue investigation. Persuade man of impossible demands. Don’tforget to include in report own opinion of possibilities for future of man.Warburg cabled his report back to New York and three days later received asecond cablegram reading:Report received. Prepare to deliver ten, maximum fifteen million dollars. Adviseman necessity of aggression against foreign danger.The $15 million was accepted for the legal takeover road, not for therevolutionary plan. The money was transferred from Wall Street to Hitler viaWarburg as follows—$5 million to be paid at Mendelsohn & Company, Amsterdam; $5million at the Rotterdamsche Bankvereinigung in Rotterdam; and $5 million at“Banca Italiana.”Warburg travelled to each of these banks, where he reportedly met Heydt,Strasser and Hermann Goering. The groups arranged for cheques to be made out todifferent names in various towns in Germany. In other words, the funds were“laundered” in the modern tradition to disguise their Wall Street origins. InItaly the payment group was reportedly received at the main building of the bankby its president and while waiting in his office two Italian fascists, Rossi andBalbo, were introduced to Warburg, Heydt, Strasser, and Goering. Three daysafter payment, Warburg returned to New York from Genoa on the Savoya. Again, hereported to Carter, Rockefeller, and the other bankers.The third section of “Financial Sources of National Socialism” is entitledsimply “1933.” The section records “Sidney Warburg’s” third and last meetingwith Hitler — on the night the Reichstag was burned. (We noted in Chapter Eightthe presence of Roosevelt’s friend Putzi Hanfstaengl in the Reichstag.) At thismeeting Hitler informed Warburg of Nazi progress towards legal takeover. Since1931 the Nationalist Socialist party had tripled in size. Massive deposits ofweapons had been made near the German border in Belgium, Holland, and Austria —but these weapons required cash payments before delivery. Hitler asked for aminimum of 100 million marks to take care of the final step in the takeoverprogramme. Guaranty Trust wired Warburg offering $7 million at most, to be paidas follows — $2 million to the Renania Joint Stock Company in Düsseldorf (theGerman branch of Royal Dutch), and $5 million to other banks. Warburg reportedthis offer to Hitler, who requested the $5 million should be sent to the BancaItaliana in Rome and (although the report does not say so) presumably the other$2 million was paid to Düsseldorf. The book concludes with the followingstatement from Warburg:I carried out my assignment strictly down to the last detail. Hitler is dictatorof the largest European country. The world has now observed him at work forseveral months. My opinion of him means nothing now. His actions will prove ifhe is bad, which I believe he is. For the sake of the German people I hope in myheart that I am wrong. The world continues to suffer under a system that has tobow to a Hitler to keep itself on its feet. Poor world, poor humanity.This is a synopsis of “Sidney Warburg’s” suppressed book on the financialorigins of national socialism in Germany. Some of the information in the book isnow common knowledge—although only part was generally known in the early 1930s.It is extraordinary to note that the unknown author had access to informationthat only surfaced many years later—for example, the identity of the von Heydtbank as a Hitler financial conduit. Why was the book taken off the bookstandsand suppressed? The stated reason for withdrawal was that “Sidney Warburg” didnot exist, that the book was a forgery, and that the Warburg family claimed itcontained anti-Semitic and libellous statements.The information in the book was resurrected after World War II and published inother books in an anti-Semitic context which does not exist in the original 1933book. Two of these post-war books were Rene Sonderegger’s Spanischer Sommer andWerner Zimmerman’s Liebet Eure Feinde.Most importantly James P. Warburg of New York signed an affidavit in 1949, whichwas published as an appendix in von Papen’s Memoirs. This Warburg affidavitemphatically denied the authenticity of the “Sidney Warburg” book and claimed itwas a hoax. Unfortunately, James P. Warburg focuses on the 1947 Sondereggeranti-Semitic book Spanischer Sommer, not the original suppressed “SidneyWarburg” book published in 1933—where the only anti-Semitism stems from Hitler’salleged statements.In other words, the Warburg affidavit raised far more questions than itresolved. We should therefore look at Warburg’s 1949 affidavit denying theauthenticity of Financial Sources of National Socialism.James Paul Warburg’s AffidavitIn 1953 Nazi Franz von Papen published his Memoirs.8 [bm06.html#ch10fn8] Thiswas the same Franz von Papen who had been active in the United States on behalfof German espionage in World War I. In his Memoirs, Franz von Papen discussesthe question of financing Hitler and places the blame squarely on industrialistFritz Thyssen and banker Kurt von Schröder. Papen denies that he (Papen)financed Hitler, and indeed no credible evidence has been forthcoming to linkvon Papen with Hitler’s funds (although Zimmerman in Liebert Eure Feinde accusesPapen of donating 14 million marks). In this context von Papen mentions “SidneyWarburg’s” The Financial Sources of National Socialism, together with the twomore recent post-World War II books by Werner Zimmerman and Rene Sonderegger(alias Severin Reinhardt).9 [bm06.html#ch10fn9] Papen adds that:James P. Warburg is able to refute the whole falsification in his affidavit. . .. For my own part I am most grateful to Mr. Warburg for disposing once and forall of this malicious libel. It is almost impossible to refute accusations ofthis sort by simple negation, and his authoritative denial has enabled me togive body to my own protestations.10 [bm06.html#ch10fn10]There are two sections to Appendix II of Papen’s book. First is a statement byJames P. Warburg; second is the affidavit, dated July 15, 1949.The opening paragraph of the statement records that in 1933 the Dutch publishinghouse of Holkema and Warendorf published De Geldbronnen van HetNationaal-Socialisme-Drie Gesprekken Met Hitler, and adds that,This book was allegedly written by “Sidney Warburg.” A partner in the Amsterdamfirm of Warburg & Co. informed James P. Warburg of the book and Holkema andWarendorf were informed that no such person as “Sidney Warburg” existed. Theythereupon withdrew the book from circulation.James Warburg then makes two sequential and seemingly contradictory statements:. . . the book contained a mass of libellous material against various members ofmy family and against a number of prominent banking houses and individuals inNew York. I have never to this day seen a copy of the book. Apparently only ahandful of copies escaped the publisher’s withdrawal.Now on the one hand Warburg claims he has never seen a copy of the “SidneyWarburg” book, and on the other hand says it is “libellous” and proceeds toconstruct a detailed affidavit on a sentence by sentence basis to refute theinformation supposedly in a book he claims not to have seen! It is verydifficult to accept the validity of Warburg’s claim he has “never to this dayseen a copy of the book.” Or if indeed he had not, then the affidavit isworthless.James Warburg adds that the “Sidney Warburg” book is “obvious anti-Semitism,”and the thrust of Warburg’s statement is that the “Sidney Warburg” story is pureanti-Semitic propaganda. In fact (and Warburg would have discovered this fact ifhe had read the book), the only anti-Semitic statements in the 1933 book arethose attributed to Adolf Hitler, whose anti-Semitic feelings are hardly anygreat discovery. Apart from Hitler’s ravings there is nothing in the original“Sidney Warburg” book remotely connected with anti-Semitism, unless we classifyRockefeller, Glean, Carter, McBean, etc. as Jewish. In fact, it is notable thatnot a single Jewish banker is named in the book—except for the mythical “SidneyWarburg” who is a courier, not one of the alleged money givers. Yet we know froman authentic source (Ambassador Dodd) that the Jewish banker Eberhard vonOppenheim did indeed give 200,000 marks to Hitler,11 [bm06.html#ch10fn11] and itis unlikely “Sidney Warburg” would have missed this observation if he wasdeliberately purveying false anti-Semitic propaganda,The first page of James Warburg’s statement concerns the 1933 book. After thefirst page James Warburg introduces Rene Sonderegger and another book written in1947. Careful analysis of Warburg’s statement and affidavit point up that hisdenials and assertions essentially refer to Sonderegger and not to SidneyWarburg. Now Sonderegger was anti-Semitic and probably was part of a neo-Nazimovement after World War II, but this claim of anti-Semitism cannot be laid tothe 1933 book—and that is the crux of the question at issue. In brief, JamesPaul Warburg starts out by claiming to discuss a book he has never seen butknows to be libellous and anti-Semitic, then without warning shifts theaccusation to another book which was certainly anti-Semitic but was published adecade later. Thus, the Warburg affidavit so thoroughly confuses the two booksthat the reader is lead to condemn the mythical “Sidney Warburg” along withSonderegger.12 [bm06.html#ch10fn12] Let us look at some of J.P. Warburg’sstatements:James P. Warburg’s Sworn Affidavit New York City, July 15, 1949Author’s Commentson James P. Warburg Affidavit 1. Concerning the wholly false and maliciousallegations made by Rene Sonderegger of Zurich, Switzerland, et al., as setforth in the foregoing part of this statement, I, James Paul Warburg, ofGreenwich, Connecticut, U.S.A., depose as follows:Note that the affidavitconcerns Rene Sonderegger, not the book published by J.G. Shoup in 1933. 2. Nosuch person as “Sidney Warburg” existed in New York City in 1933, nor elsewhere,as far as I know, then or at any other time.We can assume that the name “SidneyWarburg” is a pseudonym, or used falsely. 3. I never gave any manuscript, diary,notes, cables, or any other documents to any person for translation andpublication in Holland, and, specifically, I never gave any such documents tothe alleged J.G. Shoup of Antwerp. To the best of my knowledge and recollectionI never at any time met any such person,The affidavit confines itself to grantof materials “for translation and publication in Holland.” 4. The telephoneconversation between Roger Baldwin and myself, reported by Sonderegger, nevertook place at all and is pure invention.Reported by Sonderegger, not “SidneyWarburg.” 5. I did not go to Germany at the request of the President of theGuaranty Trust Company in 1929, or at any other time.But Warburg did go toGermany in 1929 and 1930 for the International Acceptance Bank, Inc. 6. I did goto Germany on business for my own bank, The International Acceptance Bank Inc.,of New York, in both 1929 and 1930. On neither of these occasions did I haveanything to do with investigating the possible prevention of a Communistrevolution in Germany by the promotion of a Nazi counterrevolution. As a matterof recorded fact, my opinion at the time was that there was relatively littledanger of a Communist revolution in Germany and a considerable danger of a Naziseizure of power. I am in a position to prove that, on my return from Germanyafter the Reichstag elections of 1930, I warned my associates that Hitler wouldvery likely come to power in Germany and that the result would be either aNazi-dominated Europe or a second world war—perhaps both. This can becorroborated as well as the fact that, as a consequence of my warning, my bankproceeded to reduce its German commitments as rapidly as possible.Note thatWarburg, by his own statement, told his banking associates that Hitler wouldcome to power. This claim was made in 1930—and the Warburgs continued asdirectors with I.G. Farben and other pro-Nazi firms. 7. I had no discussionsanywhere, at any time, with Hitler, with any Nazi officials, or with anyone elseabout providing funds for the Nazi Party. Specifically, I had no dealing of thissort with Mendelsohn & Co., or the Rotterdamsche Bankvereiniging or the BancaItaliana. (The latter is probably meant to read Banca d’Italia, with which Ilikewise had no such dealings.)There is no evidence to contradict thisstatement. So far as can be traced Warburgs were not connected with thesebanking firms except that the Italian correspondent of Warburg’s Bank ofManhattan was “Banca Commerciale Italiana” —which is close to “Banca Italiana.”8. In February 1933 (see pages 191 and 192 of Spanischer Sommer) when I amalleged to have brought Hitler the last installment of American funds and tohave been received by Goering and Goebbels as well as by Hitler himself, I canprove that I was not in Germany at all. I never set foot in Germany after theNazis had come to power in January 1933. In January and February I was in NewYork and Washington, working both with my bank and with President-electRoosevelt on the then-acute banking crisis. After Mr. Roosevelt’s inauguration,on March 3, 1933, I was working with him continuously helping to prepare theagenda for the World Economic Conference, to which I was sent as FinancialAdviser in early June. This is a matter of public record.There is no evidence tocontradict these statements. “Sidney Warburg” provides no supporting evidencefor his claims, See Wall Street and FDR, (New York: Arlington House Publishers,1975), for details of FDR’s German associations. 10. The foregoing statementsshould suffice to demonstrate that the whole “Sidney Warburg” myth and thesubsequent spurious identification of myself with the non-existent “Sidney” arefabrications of malicious falsehood without the slightest foundation intruth.No. James P. Warburg states he has never seen the original “SidneyWarburg” book published in Holland in 1933. Therefore his affidavit only appliesto the Sonderegger book which is inaccurate. Sidney Warburg may well be a myth,but the association of Max Warburg and Paul Warburg with I.G. Farben and Hitleris not a myth.Does James Warburg intend to mislead?It is true that “Sidney Warburg” may well have been an invention, in the sensethat “Sidney Warburg” never existed. We assume the name is a fake; but someonewrote the book. Zimmerman and Sonderegger may or may not have committed libel tothe Warburg name, but unfortunately when we examine James P. Warburg’s affidavitas published in von Papen’s Memoirs we are left as much in the dark as ever.There are three important and unanswered questions: (1) why would James P.Warburg claim as a forgery a book he has not read; (2) why does Warburg’saffidavit avoid the key question and divert discussion away from “SidneyWarburg” to the anti-Semitic Sonderegger book published in 1947; and (3) whywould James P. Warburg be so insensitive to Jewish suffering in World War II topublish his affidavit in the Memoirs of Franz von Papen, who was a prominentNazi at the heart of the Hitler movement since the early days of 1933?Not only were the German Warburgs persecuted by Hitler in 1938, but millions ofJews lost their lives to Nazi barbarism. It seems elementary that anyone who hassuffered and was sensitive to the past sufferings of German Jews would avoidNazis, Naziism, and neo-Nazi books like the plague. Yet here we have Nazi vonPapen acting as a genial literary host to self-described anti-Nazi James P.Warburg, who apparently welcomes the opportunity. Moreover, the Warburgs hadample opportunity to release such an affidavit with wide publicity withoututilizing neo-Nazi channels.The reader will profit from pondering this situation. The only logicalexplanation is that some of the facts in the “Sidney Warburg” book are eithertrue, come close to the truth, or are embarrassing to James P. Warburg. Onecannot say that Warburg intends to mislead (although this might seem an obviousconclusion), because businessmen are notoriously illogical writers andreasoners, and there is certainly nothing to exempt Warburg from thiscategorization,Some Conclusions from the “Sidney Warburg” Story“Sidney Warburg” never existed; in this sense the original 1933 book is a workof fiction. However, many of the then-little-known facts recorded in the bookare accurate; and the James Warburg affidavit is not aimed at the original bookbut rather at an anti-Semitic book circulated over a decade later.Paul Warburg was a director of American I.G. Farben and thus connected with thefinancing of Hitler. Max Warburg, a director of German I.G. Farben, signed—alongwith Hitler himself—the document which appointed Hjalmar Schacht to theReichsbank. These verifiable connections between the Warburgs and Hitler suggestthe “Sidney Warburg” story cannot be abandoned as a total forgery without closeexamination.Who wrote the 1933 book, and why? J.G. Shoup says the notes were written by aWarburg in England and given to him to translate. The Warburg motive was allegedto be genuine remorse at the amoral behaviour of Warburgs and their Wall Streetassociates. Does this sound like a plausible motive? It has not gone unnoticedthat those same Wall Streeters who plot war and revolution are often in theirprivate lives genuinely decent citizens; it is not beyond the realm of reasonthat one of them had a change of heart or a heavy conscience. But this is notproven.If the book was a forgery, then by whom was it written? James Warburg admits hedoes not know the answer, and he writes: “The original purpose of the forgeryremains somewhat obscure even today.”13 [bm06.html#ch10fn13]Would any government forge the document? Certainly not the British or U.S.governments, which are both indirectly implicated by the book. Certainly not theNazi government in Germany, although James Warburg appears to suggest thisunlikely possibility. Could it be France, or the Soviet Union, or perhapsAustria? France, possibly because France feared the rise of Nazi Germany.Austria is a similar possibility. The Soviet Union is a possibility because theSoviets also had much to fear from Hitler. So it is plausible that France,Austria, or the Soviet Union had some hand in the preparation of the book.Any private citizen who forged such a book without inside government materialswould have to be remarkably well informed. Guaranty Trust is not a particularlywell-known bank outside New York, yet there is an extraordinary degree ofplausibility about the involvement of Guaranty Trust, because it was the Morganvehicle used for financing and infiltrating the Bolshevik revolution.14[bm06.html#ch10fn14] Whoever named Guaranty Trust as the vehicle for fundingHitler either knew a great deal more than the man in the street, or hadauthentic government information.What would be the motive behind such a book?The only motive that seems acceptable is that the unknown author had knowledge awar was in preparation and hoped for a public reaction against the Wall Streetfanatics and their industrialist friends in Germany—before it was too late.Clearly, whoever wrote the book, his motive almost certainly was to warn againstHitlerian aggression and to point to its Wall Street source, because thetechnical assistance of American companies controlled by Wall Street was stillneeded to build Hitler’s war machine. The Standard Oil hydrogenation patents andfinancing for the oil from coal plants, the bomb sights, and the other necessarytechnology had not been fully transferred when the “Sidney Warburg” book waswritten. Consequently, this could have been a book designed to break the back ofHitler’s supporters abroad, to inhibit the planned transfer of U.S. war-makingpotential, and to eliminate financial and diplomatic support of the Nazi state.If this was the goal, it is regrettable that the book failed to achieve any ofthese purposes."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENWall Street-Nazi Collaboration in World War IIBehind the battle fronts in World War II, through intermediaries in Switzerlandand North Africa, the New York financial elite collaborated with the Naziregime. Captured files after the war yielded a mass of evidence demonstratingthat for some elements of Big Business, the period 1941-5 was “business asusual.” For instance, correspondence between U.S. firms and their Frenchsubsidiaries reveals the aid given to the Axis military machine — while theUnited States was at war with Germany and Italy. Letters between Ford of Franceand Ford of the U.S. between 1940 and July 1942 were analyzed by the ForeignFunds Control section of the Treasury Department. Their initial report concludedthat until mid-1942:(1) the business of the Ford subsidiaries in France substantially increased; (2)their production was solely for the benefit of the Germans and the countriesunder its occupation; (3) the Germans have “shown clearly their wish to protectthe Ford interests” because of the attitude of strict neutrality maintained byHenry Ford and the late Edsel Ford; and (4) the increased activity of the FrenchFord subsidiaries on behalf of the Germans received the commendation of the Fordfamily in America.1 [bm06.html#ch11fn1]Similarly, the Rockefeller Chase Bank was accused of collaborating with theNazis in World War II France, while Nelson Rockefeller had a soft job inWashington D.C.:Substantially the same pattern of behaviour was pursued by the Paris office ofthe Chase Bank during German occupation. An examination of the correspondencebetween Chase, New York, and Chase, France, from the date of the fall of Franceto May, 1942 discloses that: (1) the manager of the Paris office appeased andcollaborated with the Germans to place the Chase banks in a “privilegedposition;” (2) the Germans held the Chase Bank in a very special esteem — owingto the international activities of our (Chase) head office and the pleasantrelations which the Paris branch has been maintaining with many of their(German) banks and their (German) local organizations and higher officers; (3)the Paris manager was “very vigorous in enforcing restrictions against Jewishproperty, even going so far as to refuse to release funds belonging to Jews inanticipation that a decree with retroactive provisions prohibiting such releasemight be published in the near future by the occupying authorities;” (4) the NewYork office despite the above information took no direct steps to remove theundesirable manager from the Paris office since it “might react against our(Chase) interests as we are dealing, not with a theory but with a situation.”2[bm06.html#ch11fn2]An official report to then-Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau concluded that:These two situations [i.e., Ford and Chase Bank] convince us that it isimperative to investigate immediately on the spot the activities of subsidiariesof at least some of the larger American firms which were operating in Franceduring German occupation . . . .3 [bm06.html#ch11fn3]Treasury officials urged that an investigation be started with the Frenchsubsidiaries of several American banks — that is, Chase, Morgan, National City,Guaranty, Bankers Trust, and American Express. Although Chase and Morgan werethe only two banks to maintain French offices throughout the Nazi occupation, inSeptember 1944 all the major New York banks were pressing the U.S. Governmentfor permission to re-open pre-war branches. Subsequent Treasury investigationproduced documentary evidence of collaboration between both Chase Bank and J. P.Morgan with the Nazis in World War II. The recommendation for a fullinvestigation is cited in full as follows:TREASURY DEPARTMENT INTER-OFFICE COMMUNICATIONDate: December 20, 1944To: Secretary MorgenthauFrom: Mr. SaxonExamination of the records of the Chase Bank, Paris, and of Morgan and Company,France, have progressed only far enough to permit tentative conclusions and therevelation of a few interesting facts:CHASE RANK, PARISa. Niederman, of Swiss nationality, manager of Chase, Paris, was unquestionablya collaborator;b. The Chase Head Office in New York was informed of Niederman’scollaborationist policy but took no steps to remove him. Indeed there is ampleevidence to show that the Head Office in New York viewed Niederman’s goodrelations with the Germans as an excellent means of preserving, unimpaired, theposition of the Chase Bank in France;c. The German authorities were anxious to keep the Chase open and indeed tookexceptional measures to provide sources of revenue;d. The German authorities desired “to be friends” with the important Americanbanks because they expected that these banks would be useful after the war as aninstrument of German policy in the United States;e. The Chase, Paris showed itself most anxious to please the German authoritiesin every possible way. For example, the Chase zealously maintained the accountof the German Embassy in Paris, “as every little thing helps” (to maintain theexcellent relations between Chase and the German authorities);f. The whole objective of the Chase policy and operation was to maintain theposition of the bank at any cost.MORGAN AND COMPANY, FRANCEa. Morgan and Company regarded itself as a French bank, and therefore obligatedto observe French banking laws and regulations, whether Nazi-inspired or not;and did actually do so;b. Morgan and Company was most anxious to preserve the continuity of its housein France, and, in order to achieve this security, worked out a modus vivendiwith the German authorities;c. Morgan and Company had tremendous prestige with the German authorities, andthe Germans boasted of the splendid cooperation of Morgan and Company;d. Morgan continued its pre-war relations with the great French industrial andcommercial concerns which were working for Germany, including the Renault Works,since confiscated by the French Government, Puegeqt [sic], Citroen, and manyothers.e. The power of Morgan and Company in France bears no relation to the smallfinancial resources of the firm, and the enquiry now in progress will be of realvalue in allowing us for the first time to study the Morgan pattern in Europeand the manner in which Morgan has used its great power;f. Morgan and Company constantly sought its ends by playing one governmentagainst another in the coldest and most unscrupulous manner.Mr. Jefferson Caffery, U.S. Ambassador to France, has been kept informed of theprogress of this investigation and at all times gave me full support andencouragement, in principle and in fact. Indeed, it was Mr. Caffery himself whoasked me how the Ford and General Motors subsidiaries in France had acted duringthe occupation, and expressed the desire that we should look into thesecompanies after the bank investigation was completed,RECOMMENDATIONI recommend that this investigation, which, for unavoidable reasons, hasprogressed slowly up to this time, should now be pressed urgently and thatadditional needed personnel be sent to Paris as soon as possible.4[bm06.html#ch11fn4] The full investigation was never undertaken, and no investigation has been madeof this presumably treasonable activity down to the present day.American I.G. in World War IICollaboration between American businessmen and Nazis in Axis Europe wasparalleled by protection of Nazi interests in the United States. In 1939American I.G. was renamed General Aniline & Film, with General Dyestuffs actingas its exclusive sales agent in the U.S. These names effectively disguised thefact that American I.G. (or General Aniline & Film) was an important producer ofmajor war materials, including atabrine, magnesium, and synthetic rubber.Restrictive agreements with its German parent I.G. Farben reduced Americansupplies of these military products during World War II.An American citizen, Halbach, became president of General Dyestuffs in 1930 andacquired majority control in 1939 from Dietrich A. Schmitz, a director ofAmerican I.G. and brother of Hermann Schmitz, director of I.G. Farben in Germanyand chairman of the board of American I.G. until the outbreak of war in 1939.After Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Treasury blocked Halbach’s bank accounts. In June1942 the Alien Property Custodian seized Halbach’s stock in General Dyestuffsand took over the firm as an enemy corporation under the Trading with the EnemyAct. Subsequently, the Alien Property Custodian appointed a new board ofdirectors to act as trustee for the duration of the war. These actions werereasonable and usual practice, but when we probe under the surface another andquite abnormal story emerges.Between 1942 and 1945 Halbach was nominally a consultant to General Dyestuffs.In fact Halbach ran the company, at $82,000 per year. Louis Johnson, formerAssistant Secretary of War, was appointed president of General Dyestuffs by theU.S. Government, for which he received $75,000 a year. Louis Johnson attemptedto bring pressure to bear on the U.S. Treasury to unblock Halbach’s blockedfunds and allow Halbach to develop policies contrary to the interests of theU.S., then at war with Germany. The argument used to get Halbach’s bank accountsunblocked was that Halbach was running the company and that theGovernment-appointed board of directors “would have been lost without Mr.Halbach’s knowledge.”During the war Halbach filed suit against the Alien Property Custodian, throughthe Establishment law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, to oust the U.S. Governmentfrom its control of I.G. Farben companies. These suits were unsuccessful, butHalbach was successful in keeping the Farben cartel agreements intact throughoutWorld War II; the Alien Property Custodian never did go into court during WorldWar II on the pending anti-trust suits. Why not? Leo T. Crowley, head of theAlien Property Custodian’s office, had John Foster Dulles as his advisor, andJohn Foster Dulles was a partner in the above-mentioned Sullivan and Cromwellfirm, which was acting on behalf of Halbach in its suit against the AlienProperty Custodian,There were other conflict of interest situations we should note. Leo T, Crowley,the Alien Property Custodian, appointed Victor Emanuel to the boards of bothGeneral Aniline & Film and General Dyestuffs. Before the war Victor Emanuel wasdirector of the J. Schroder Banking Corporation. Schröder, as we have alreadyseen, was a prominent financier of Hitler and the Nazi party — and at that verytime was a member of Himmler’s Circle of Friends, making substantialcontributions to S.S. organizations in Germany.In turn Victor Emanuel appointed Leo Crowley head of Standard Gas & Electric(controlled by Emanuel) at $75,000 per annum. This sum was in addition toCrowley’s salary from the Alien Property Custodian and $10,000 a year as head ofthe U.S. Government Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. By 1943 James E.Markham had replaced Crowley as A.P.C. and was also appointed by Emanuel as adirector of Standard Gas at $4,850 per year, in addition to the $10,000 he drewas Alien Property Custodian.The wartime influence of General Dyestuffs and this cosy government-businesscoterie on behalf of I.G Farben is exemplified in the case of American Cyanamid.Before the war I.G. Farben controlled the drug, chemical, and dyestuffsindustries in Mexico. During World War II it was proposed to Washington thatAmerican Cyanamid take over this Mexican industry and develop an “independent”chemical industry with the old I.G. Farben firms seized by the Mexican AlienProperty Custodian,As hired hands of Schröder banker Victor Emanuel, Crowley and Markham, who werealso employees of the U.S. Government, attempted to deal with the question ofthese I.G. Farben interests in the United States and Mexico. On April 13, 1943James Markham sent a letter to Secretary of State Cordell Hull objecting to theproposed Cyanamid deal on the grounds it was contrary to the Atlantic Charterand would interfere with the aim of establishing independent firms in LatinAmerica. The Markham position was supported by Henry A. Wallace and AttorneyGeneral Francis Biddle,The forces aligned against the Cyanamid deal were Sterling Drug, Inc. andWinthrop. Both Sterling and Winthrop stood to lose their drug market in Mexicoif the Cyanamid deal went through. Also hostile to the Cyanamid deal of coursewas I.G. Farben’s General Aniline and General Dyestuffs, dominated by VictorEmanuel, banker Schröder’s former associate.On the other hand, the State Department and the Office of the Coordinator ofInter-American affairs — which happened to be Nelson Rockefeller’s wartime baby— supported the proposed Cyanamid deal. The Rockefellers are, of course, alsointerested in the drug and chemical industries in Latin America. In brief, anAmerican monopoly under influence of Rockefeller would have replaced a Nazi I.G.Farben monopoly.I.G. Farben won this round in Washington, but more ominous questions are raisedwhen we look at the bombing of Germany in wartime by the U.S.A.A.F. It has longbeen rumoured, but never proven, that Farben received favoured treatment — i.e.,that it was not bombed. James Stewart Martin comments as follows on favouredtreatment received by I.G. Farben in the bombing of Germany:Shortly after the armies reached the Rhine at Cologne, we were driving along thewest bank within sight of the undamaged I.G. Farben plant at Leverkusen acrossthe river. Without knowing anything about me or my business he (the jeep driver)began to give me a lecture about I.G. Farben and to point at the contrastbetween the bombed-out city of Cologne and the trio of untouched plants on thefringe: the Ford works and the United Rayon works on the west bank, and theFarben works on the east bank.5 [bm06.html#ch11fn5]While this accusation is very much of an open question, requiring a great dealof skilled research into the U.S.A.A.F. bombing records, other aspects offavouritism for the Nazis are well recorded.At the end of World War II, Wall Street moved into Germany through the ControlCouncil to protect their old cartel friends and limit the extent to which thedenazification fervour would damage old business relationships. General LuciusClay, the deputy military governor for Germany, appointed businessmen whoopposed denazification to positions of control over the denazification proceeds.William H. Draper of Dillon, Read, the firm which financed the German cartelsback in the 1920s, became General Clay’s deputy.Banker William Draper, as Brigadier General William Draper, put his control teamtogether from businessmen who had represented American business in pre-warGermany. The General Motors representation included Louis Douglas, a formerdirector of G.M., and Edward S. Zdunke, a pre-war head of General Motors inAntwerp, appointed to supervise the Engineering Section of the Control Council.Peter Hoglund, an expert on German auto industry, was given leave from GeneralMotors. The personnel selection for the Council was undertaken by Colonel GraemeK. Howard — former G.M. representative in Germany and author of a book which“praises totalitarian practices [and] justifies German aggression. . . .”6[bm06.html#ch11fn6]image [images/pg156.jpg]Treasury Secretary Morgenthau was deeply disturbed at the implications of thisWall Street monopoly of the fate of Nazi Germany and prepared a memorandum topresent to President Roosevelt. The complete Morgenthau memorandum, dated May29, 1945, reads as follows:MEMORANDUMMay 29, 1945Lieutenant-General Lucius D. Clay, as Deputy to General Eisenhower, activelyruns the American element of the Control Council for Germany. General Clay’sthree principal advisers on the Control Council staff are:1. Ambassador Robert D. Murphy, who is in charge of the Political Division.2. Louis Douglas, whom General Clay describes “as my personal adviser oneconomical, financial and governmental matters.” Douglas resigned as Director ofthe Budget in 1934; and for the following eight years he attacked thegovernment’s fiscal policies. Since 1940, Douglas has been president of theMutual Life Insurance Company, and since December 1944, he has been a directorof the General Motors Corporation.3. Brigadier-General William Draper, who is the director of the EconomicsDivision of the Control Council. General Draper is a partner of the banking firmof Dillon, Read and Company.Sunday’s New York Times contained the announcement of key personnel who havebeen appointed by General Clay and General Draper to the Economic Division ofthe Control Council. The appointments include the following:1. R.J. Wysor is to be in charge of the metallurgical matters. Wysor waspresident of the Republic Steel Corporation from 1937 until a recent date, andprior thereto, he was associated with the Bethlehem Steel, Jones and LaughlinSteel Corporation and the Republic Steel Corporation.2. Edward S. Zdunke is to supervise the engineering section. Prior to the war,Mr. Zdunke was head of General Motors at Antwerp.3. Philip Gaethke is to be in charge of mining operations. Gaethke was formerlyconnected with Anaconda Copper and was manager of its smelters and mines inUpper Silesia before the war.4. Philip P. Clover is to be in charge of handling oil matters. He was formerlya representative of the Socony Vacuum Oil Company in Germany.5. Peter Hoglund is to deal with industrial production problems. Hoglund is onleave from General Motors and is said to be an expert on German production.6. Calvin B. Hoover is to be in charge of the Intelligence Group on the ControlCouncil and is also to be a special advisor to General Draper. In a letter tothe Editor of the New York Times on October 9, 1944, Hoover wrote as follows:The publication of Secretary Morgenthau’s plan for dealing with Germany hasdisturbed me deeply . . . such a Carthaginian peace would leave a legacy of hateto poison international relations for generations to come . . . the void in theeconomy of Europe which would exist through the destruction of all Germanindustry is something which is difficult to contemplate.7. Laird Bell is to be Chief Counsel of the Economic Division. He is awell-known Chicago lawyer and in May 1944, was elected the president of theChicago Daily News, after the death of Frank Knox.One of the men who helped General Draper in the selection of personnel for theEconomics Division was Colonel Graeme Howard, a vice-president of GeneralMotors, who was in charge of their overseas business and who was a leadingrepresentative of General Motors in Germany prior to the war. Howard is theauthor of a book in which he praises totalitarian practices, justifies Germanaggression and the Munich policy of appeasement, and blames Roosevelt forprecipitating the war.So when we examine the Control Council for Germany under General Lucius D. Claywe find that the head of the finance division was Louis Douglas, director of theMorgan-controlled General Motors and president of Mutual Life Insurance. (Opel,the General Motors German subsidiary, had been Hitler’s biggest tank producer.)The head of the Control Council’s Economics Division was William Draper, apartner in the Dillon, Read firm that had so much to do with building NaziGermany in the first place, All three men were, not surprisingly in the light ofmore recent findings, members of the Council on Foreign Relations.Were American Industrialists and Financiers Guilty of War Crimes?The Nuremberg War Crimes Trials proposed to select those responsible for WorldWar II preparations and atrocities and place them on trial. Whether such aprocedure is morally justifiable is a debatable matter; there is somejustification for holding that Nuremberg was a political farce far removed fromlegal principle.7 [bm06.html#ch11fn7] However, if we assume that there is suchlegal and moral justification, then surely any such trial should apply to all,irrespective of nationality. What for example should exempt Franklin D.Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, but not exempt Adolf Hitler and Goering? If theoffense is preparation for war, and not blind vengeance, then justice should beimpartial.The directives prepared by the U.S. Control Council in Germany for the arrestand detention of war criminals refers to “Nazis” and “Nazi sympathizers,” not“Germans.” The relevant extracts are as follows:a. You will search out, arrest, and hold, pending receipt by you of furtherinstructions as to their disposition, Adolph Hitler, his chief Nazi associates,other war criminals and all persons who have participated in planning orcarrying out Nazi enterprises involving or resulting in atrocities or warcrimes.Then follows a list of the categories of persons to be arrested, including:(8) Nazis and Nazi sympathizers holding important and key positions in (a)National and Gau Civic and economic organizations; (b) corporations and otherorganizations in which the government has a major financial interest; (c)industry, commerce, agriculture, and finance; (d) education; (e) the judiciary;and (f) the press, publishing houses and other agencies disseminating news andpropaganda.Top American industrialists and financiers named in this book are covered by thecategories listed above. Henry Ford and Edsel Ford respectively contributedmoney to Hitler and profited from German wartime production. Standard Oil of NewJersey, General Electric, General Motors, and I.T.T. certainly made financial ortechnical contributions which comprise prima facie evidence of “participating inplanning or carrying out Nazi enterprises.”There is, in brief, evidence which suggests:(a) cooperation with the Wehrmacht (Ford Motor Company, Chase Bank, MorganBank);(b) aid to the Nazi Four Year Plan and economic mobilization for war (StandardOil of New Jersey);(c) creating and equipping the Nazi war machine (I.T.T.);(d) stockpiling critical materials for the Nazis (Ethyl Corporation);(e) weakening the Nazis’ potential enemies (American I.G. Farben); and,(f) carrying on of propaganda, intelligence, and espionage (American I.G. Farbenand Rockefeller public-relations man Ivy Lee).At the very least there is sufficient evidence to demand a thorough andimpartial investigation. However, as we have noted previously, these same firmsand financiers were prominent in the 1933 election of Roosevelt and consequentlyhad sufficient political pull to squelch threats of investigation. Extracts fromthe Morgenthau diary demonstrate that Wall Street political power was sufficienteven to control the appointment of officers responsible for the denazificationand eventual government of post-war Germany.Did these American firms know of their assistance to Hitler’s military machine?According to the firms themselves, emphatically not. They claim innocence of anyintent to aid Hitler’s Germany. Witness a telegram sent by the chairman of theboard of Standard Oil of New Jersey to Secretary of War Patterson after WorldWar II, when preliminary investigation of Wall Street assistance was under way:During the entire period of our business contacts, we had no inkling of Farben sconniving part in Hitler’s brutal politics. We offer any help we can give to seethat complete truth is brought to light, and that rigid justice is done.F.W. Abrams, Chairman of BoardUnfortunately, the evidence presented is contrary to Abrams’ telegraphedassertions. Standard Oil of New Jersey not only aided Hitler’s war machine, buthad knowledge of this assistance. Emil Helffrich, the board chairman of aStandard of New Jersey subsidiary, was a member of the Keppler Circle beforeHitler came to power; he continued to give financial contributions to Himmler’sCircle as late as 1944.Accordingly, it is not at all difficult to visualize why Nazi industrialistswere puzzled by “investigation” and assumed at the end of the war that theirWall Street friends would bail them out and protect them from the wrath of thosewho had suffered. These attitudes were presented to the Kilgore Committee in1946:You might also be interested in knowing, Mr. Chairman, that the top I.G. Farbenpeople and others, when we questioned them about these activities, were inclinedat times to be very indignant. Their general attitude and expectation was thatthe war was over and we ought now to be assisting them in helping to get I.G.Farben and German industry back on its feet. Some of them have outwardly saidthat this questioning and investigation was, in their estimation, only aphenomenon of short duration, because as soon as things got a little settledthey would expect their friends in the United States and in England to be comingover. Their friends, so they said, would put a stop to activities such as theseinvestigations and would see that they got the treatment which they regarded asproper and that assistance would be given to them to help reestablish theirindustry.8 [bm06.html#ch11fn8]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVEConclusionsWe have demonstrated with documentary evidence a number of critical associationsbetween Wall Street international bankers and the rise of Hitler and Naziism inGermany.First: that Wall Street financed the German cartels in the mid-1920s which inturn proceeded to bring Hitler to power,Second: that the financing for Hitler and his S.S. street thugs came in partfrom affiliates or subsidiaries of U.S. firms, including Henry Ford in 1922,payments by I.G. Farben and General Electric in 1933, followed by the StandardOil of New Jersey and I.T.T. subsidiary payments to Heinrich Himmler up to 1944.Third: that U.S. multinationals under the control of Wall Street profitedhandsomely from Hitler’s military construction programme in the 1930s and atleast until 1942.Fourth: that these same international bankers used political influence in theU.S. to cover up their wartime collaboration and to do this infiltrated the U.S.Control Commission for Germany.Our evidence for these four major assertions can be summarized as follows:In Chapter One [chapter01.html#ch1] we presented evidence that the Dawes andYoung Plans for German reparations were formulated by Wall Streeters,temporarily wearing the hats of statesmen, and these loans generated a rain ofprofits for these international bankers. Owen Young of General Electric, HjalmarSchacht, A. Voegler, and others intimately connected with Hitler’s accession topower had earlier been the negotiators for the U.S. and German sides,respectively. Three Wall Street houses — Dillon, Read; Harris, Forbes; and,National City Company — handled three-quarters of the reparations loans used tocreate the German cartel system, including the dominant I.G. Farben andVereinigte Stahlwerke, which together produced 95 percent of the explosives forthe Nazi side in World War II.The central role of I.G. Farben in Hitler’s coup d’état was reviewed in ChapterTwo [chapter02.html#ch2]. The directors of American I.G. (Farben) wereidentified as prominent American businessmen: Walter Teagle, a close Rooseveltassociate and backer and an NRA administrator; banker Paul Warburg (his brotherMax Warburg was on the board of I.G. Farben in Germany); and Edsel Ford. Farbencontributed 400,000 RM directly to Schacht and Hess for use in the crucial 1933elections and Farben was subsequently in the forefront of military developmentin Nazi Germany.A donation of 60,000 RM was made to Hitler by German General Electric (A.E.G.),which had four directors and a 25-30 percent interest held by the U.S. GeneralElectric parent company. This role was described in Chapter Three[chapter03.html#ch3], and we found that Gerard Swope, an originator ofRoosevelt’s New Deal (its National Recovery Administration segment), togetherwith Owen Young of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Clark Minor ofInternational General Electric, were the dominant Wall Streeters in A.E.G. andthe most significant single influence.We also found no evidence to indict the German electrical firm Siemens, whichwas not under Wall Street control. In contrast, there is documentary evidencethat both A.E.G. and Osram, the other units of the German electrical industry —both of which had U.S. participation and control — did finance Hitler. In fact,almost all directors of German General Electric were Hitler backers, eitherdirectly through A.E.G. or indirectly through other German firms. G.E. roundedout its Hitler support by technical cooperation with Krupp, aimed at restrictingU.S. development of tungsten carbide, which worked to the detriment of the U.S.in World War II. We concluded that A.E.G. plants in Germany managed, by a yetunknown manoeuvre, to avoid bombing by the Allies.An examination of the role of Standard Oil of New Jersey (which was and iscontrolled by the Rockefeller interests) was undertaken in Chapter Four[chapter04.html#ch4]. Standard Oil apparently did not finance Hitler’s accessionto power in 1933 (that part of the “myth of Sidney Warburg” is not proven). Onthe other hand, payments were made up to 1944 by Standard Oil of New Jersey, todevelop synthetic gasoline for war purposes on behalf of the Nazis and, throughits wholly owned subsidiary, to Heinrich Himmler’s S.S. Circle of Friends forpolitical purposes. Standard Oil’s role was technical aid to Nazi development ofsynthetic rubber and gasoline through a U.S. research company under themanagement control of Standard Oil. The Ethyl Gasoline Company, jointly owned byStandard Oil of New Jersey and General Motors, was instrumental in supplyingvital ethyl lead to Nazi Germany — over the written protests of the U.S. WarDepartment — with the clear knowledge that the ethyl lead was for Nazi militarypurposes.In Chapter Five [chapter05.html#ch5] we demonstrated that InternationalTelephone and Telegraph Company, one of the more notorious multinationals,worked both sides of World War II through Baron Kurt von Schröder, of theSchroder banking group. I.T.T. also held a 28-percent interest in Focke-Wolfeaircraft, which manufactured excellent German fighter planes. We also found thatTexaco (Texas Oil Company) was involved in Nazi endeavours through Germanattorney Westrick, but dropped its chairman of the board Rieber when theseendeavours were publicized.Henry Ford was an early (1922) Hitler backer and Edsel Ford continued the familytradition in 1942 by encouraging French Ford to profit from arming the GermanWehrmacht. Subsequently, these Ford-produced vehicles were used against Americansoldiers as they landed in France in 1944. For his early recognition of, andtimely assistance to, the Nazis, Henry Ford received a Nazi medal in 1938. Therecords of French Ford suggest Ford Motor received kid glove treatment from theNazis after 1940.The provable threads of Hitler financing are drawn together in Chapter Seven[chapter07.html#ch7] and answer with precise names and figures the question, whofinanced Adolf Hitler? This chapter indicts Wall Street and, incidentally, noone else of consequence in the United States except the Ford family. The Fordfamily is not normally associated with Wall Street but is certainly a part ofthe “power elite.”In earlier chapters we cited several Roosevelt associates, including Teagle ofStandard Oil, the Warburg family, and Gerard Swope. In Chapter Eight[chapter08.html#ch8] the role of Putzi Hanfstaengl, another Roosevelt friend anda participant in the Reichstag fire, is traced. The composition of the Naziinner circle during World War II, and the financial contributions of StandardOil of New Jersey and I.T.T. subsidiaries, are traced in Chapter Nine[chapter09.html#ch9]. Documentary proof of these monetary contributions ispresented. Kurt von Schröder is identified as the key intermediary in this S.S.“slush fund.”Finally, in Chapter Ten [chapter10.html#ch10] we reviewed a book suppressed in1934 and the “myth of ‘Sidney Warburg.’ ” The suppressed book accused theRockefellers, the Warburgs, and the major oil companies of financing Hitler.While the name “Sidney Warburg” was no doubt an invention, the extraordinaryfact remains that the argument in the suppressed “Sidney Warburg” book isremarkably close to the evidence presented now. It also remains a puzzle whyJames Paul Warburg, fifteen years later, would want to attempt, in a rathertransparently slipshod manner, to refute the contents of the “Warburg” book, abook he claims not to have seen. It is perhaps even more of a puzzle why Warburgwould choose Nazi von Papen’s Memoirs as the vehicle to present his refutation.Finally, in Chapter Eleven [chapter11.html#ch11] we examined the roles of theMorgan and Chase Banks in World War II, specifically their collaboration withthe Nazis in France while a major war was raging.In other words, as in our two previous examinations of the links between NewYork international bankers and major historical events, we find a provablepattern of subsidy and political manipulation.The Pervasive Influence of International BankersLooking at the broad array of facts presented in the three volumes of the WallStreet series, we find persistent recurrence of the same names: Owen Young,Gerard Swope, Hjalmar Schacht, Bernard Baruch, etc.; the same internationalbanks: J. P. Morgan, Guaranty Trust, Chase Bank; and the same location in NewYork: usually 120 Broadway,This group of international bankers backed the Bolshevik Revolution andsubsequently profited from the establishment of a Soviet Russia. This groupbacked Roosevelt and profited from New Deal socialism. This group also backedHitler and certainly profited from German armament in the 1930s. When BigBusiness should have been running its business operations at Ford Motor,Standard of New Jersey, and so on, we find it actively and deeply involved inpolitical upheavals, war, and revolutions in three major countries,The version of history presented here is that the financial elite knowingly andwith premeditation assisted the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 in concert withGerman bankers. After profiting handsomely from the German hyper-inflationarydistress of 1923, and planning to place the German reparations burden onto thebacks of American investors, Wall Street found it had brought about the 1929financial crisis,Two men were then backed as leaders for major Western countries: Franklin D.Roosevelt in the United States and Adolf Hitler in Germany, The Roosevelt NewDeal and Hitler’s Four Year Plan had great similarities. The Roosevelt andHitler plans were plans for fascist takeovers of their respective countries.While Roosevelt’s NRA failed, due to then-operating constitutional constraints,Hitler’s Plan succeeded.Why did the Wall Street elite, the international bankers, want Roosevelt andHitler in power? This is an aspect we have not explored. According to the “mythof ‘Sidney Warburg,’ ” Wall Street wanted a policy of revenge; that is, itwanted war in Europe between France and Germany. We know even from Establishmenthistory that both Hitler and Roosevelt acted out policies leading to war.The link-ups between persons and events in this three-book series would requireanother book. But a single example will perhaps indicate the remarkableconcentration of power within a relatively few organizations, and the use ofthis power.On May 1st, 1918, when the Bolsheviks controlled only a small fraction of Russia(and were to come near to losing even that fraction in the summer of 1918), theAmerican League to Aid and Cooperate with Russia was organized in Washington,D.C. to support the Bolsheviks. This was not a “Hands off Russia” type ofcommittee formed by the Communist Party U.S.A. or its allies. It was a committeecreated by Wall Street with George P. Whalen of Vacuum Oil Company as Treasurerand Coffin and Oudin of General Electric, along with Thompson of the FederalReserve System, Willard of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and assortedsocialists,When we look at the rise of Hitler and Naziism we find Vacuum Oil and GeneralElectric well represented. Ambassador Dodd in Germany was struck by the monetaryand technical contribution by the Rockefeller-controlled Vacuum Oil Company inbuilding up military gasoline facilities for the Nazis. The Ambassador tried towarn Roosevelt. Dodd believed, in his apparent naiveté of world affairs, thatRoosevelt would intervene, but Roosevelt himself was backed by these same oilinterests and Walter Teagle of Standard Oil of New Jersey and the NRA was on theboard of Roosevelt’s Warm Springs Foundation. So, in but one of many examples,we find the Rockefeller-controlled Vacuum Oil Company prominently assisting inthe creation of Bolshevik Russia, the military build-up of Nazi Germany, andbacking Roosevelt’s New Deal.Is the United States Ruled by a Dictatorial Elite?Within the last decade or so, certainly since the 1960s, a steady flow ofliterature has presented a thesis that the United States is ruled by aself-perpetuating and unelected power elite. Even further, most of these booksaver that this elite controls, or at the least heavily influences, all foreignand domestic policy decisions, and that no idea becomes respectable or ispublished in the United States without the tacit approval, or perhaps lack ofdisapproval, of this elitist circle.Obviously the very flow of anti-establishment literature by itself testifiesthat the United States cannot be wholly under the thumb of any single group orelite. On the other hand, anti-establishment literature is not fully recognizedor reasonably discussed in academic or media circles. More often than not itconsists of a limited edition, privately produced, almost hand-to-handcirculated. There are some exceptions, true; but not enough to dispute theobservation that anti-establishment critics do not easily enter normalinformation/distribution channels.Whereas in the early and mid-1960s, any concept of rule by a conspiratorialelite, or indeed any kind of elite, was reason enough to dismiss the proponentout of hand as a “nut case,” the atmosphere for such concepts has changedradically. The Watergate affair probably added the final touches to along-developing environment of skepticism and doubt. We are almost at the pointwhere anyone who accepts, for example, the Warren Commission report, or believesthat that the decline and fall of Mr. Nixon did not have some conspiratorialaspects, is suspect. In brief, no one any longer really believes theEstablishment information process. And there is a wide variety of alternativepresentations of events now available for the curious.Several hundred books, from the full range of the political and philosophicalspectrum, add bits and pieces of evidence, more hypotheses, and moreaccusations. What was not too long ago a kooky idea, talked about at midnightbehind closed doors, in hushed and almost conspiratorial whispers, is now openlydebated — not, to be sure, in Establishment newspapers but certainly onnon-network radio talk shows, the underground press, and even from time to timein books from respectable Establishment publishing houses,So let us ask the question again: Is there an unelected power elite behind theU.S. Government?A substantive and often-cited source of information is Carroll Quigley,Professor of International Relations at Georgetown University, who in 1966 hadpublished a monumental modern history entitled Tragedy and Hope.1[bm06.html#ch12fn1] Quigley’s book is apart from others in this revisionistvein, by virtue of the fact that it was based on a two-year study of theinternal documents of one of the power centres. Quigley traces the history ofthe power elite:. . . the powers of financial capitalism had another far reaching aim, nothingless than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able todominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as awhole.Quigley also demonstrates that the Council on Foreign Relations, the NationalPlanning Association, and other groups are “semi-secret” policymaking bodiesunder the control of this power elite.In the following tabular presentation we have listed five such revisionistbooks, including Quigley’s. Their essential theses and compatibility with thethree volumes of the “Wall Street” series are summarized. It is surprising thatin the three major historical events noted, Carroll Quigley is not at allconsistent with the “Wall Street” series evidence. Quigley goes a long way toprovide evidence for the existence of the power elite, but does not penetratethe operations of the elite.Possibly, the papers used by Quigley had been vetted, and did not includedocumentation on elitist manipulation of such events as the BolshevikRevolution, Hitler’s accession to power, and the election of Roosevelt in 1933.More likely, these political manipulations may not be recorded at all in thefiles of the power groups. They may have been unrecorded actions by a small adhoc segment of the elite. It is noteworthy that the documents used by thisauthor came from government sources, recording the day-to-day actions ofTrotsky, Lenin, Roosevelt, Hitler, J. P. Morgan and the various firms and banksinvolved.On the other hand, such authors as Jules Archer, Gary Allen, Helen P. Lasell,and William Domhoff, writing from widely different political standpoints,2[bm06.html#ch12fn2] are consistent with the “Wall Street” evidence. Thesewriters present a hypothesis of a power elite manipulating the U.S. Government.The “Wall Street” series demonstrates how this hypothesized “power elite” hasmanipulated specific historical events.Obviously any such exercise of unconstrained and supra-legal power isunconstitutional, even though wrapped in the fabric of law-abiding actions. Wecan therefore legitimately raise the question of the existence of a subversiveforce operating to remove constitutionally guaranteed rights.The New York Elite as a Subversive ForceTwentieth-century history, as recorded in Establishment textbooks and journals,is inaccurate. It is a history which is based solely upon those officialdocuments which various Administrations have seen fit to release for publicconsumption.IS THE EVIDENCE IN THE “WALL STREET” SERIES CONSISTENT WITH RELATED REVISIONISTARGUMENTS PRESENTED ELSEWHERE?Author and Title:Essential Thesis:Is the Thesis Consistent with: (1) Wall Streetand the Bolshevik Revolution(2) Wall Street and FDR(3) Wall Street and the Riseof Hitler Carroll QUIGLEY: Tragedy and Hope (1)“Semi-secret” EasternEstablishment and interlocks have dominant role in planning and policy inU.S.Quigley does not include evidence of Wall Street in the Bolshevik Revolution(pp. 385-9)No: Quigley’s argument is totally inconsistent with above (see p.533)Quigley’s account of the rise of Hitler (pp. 529-33) does not includeevidence of Establishment involvement.

New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 1967.But an accurate history cannot be based on a selective release of documentaryarchives. Accuracy requires access to all documents. In practice, as previouslyclassified documents in the U.S. State Department files, the British ForeignOffice, and the German Foreign Ministry archives and other depositories areacquired, a new version of history has emerged; the prevailing Establishmentversion is seen to be, not only inaccurate, but designed to hide a pervasivefabric of deceit and immoral conduct.The centre of political power, as authorized by the U.S. Constitution, is withan elected Congress and an elected President, working within the framework andunder the constraints of a Constitution, as interpreted by an unbiased SupremeCourt. We have in the past assumed that political power is consequentlycarefully exercised by the Executive and legislative branch, after duedeliberation and assessment of the wishes of the electorate. In fact, nothingcould be further from this assumption. The electorate has long suspected, butnow knows, that political promises are worth nothing. Lies are the order of theday for policy implementors. Wars are started (and stopped) with no shred ofcoherent explanation. Political words have never matched political deeds. Whynot? Apparently because the centre of political power has been elsewhere thanwith elected and presumably responsive representatives in Washington, and thispower elite has its own objectives, which are inconsistent with those of thepublic at large,In this three-volume series we have identified for three historical events theseat of political power in the United States — the power behind the scenes, thehidden influence on Washington — as that of the financial establishment in NewYork: the private international bankers, more specifically the financial housesof J.P. Morgan, the Rockefeller-controlled Chase Manhattan Bank, and in earlierdays (before amalgamation of their Manhattan Bank with the former Chase Bank),the Warburgs.The United States has, in spite of the Constitution and its supposedconstraints, become a quasi-totalitarian state. While we do not (yet) have theovert trappings of dictatorship, the concentration camps and the knock on thedoor at midnight, we most certainly do have threats and actions aimed at thesurvival of non-Establishment critics, use of the Internal Revenue Service tobring dissidents in line, and manipulation of the Constitution by a court systemthat is politically subservient to the Establishment.It is in the pecuniary interests of the international bankers to centralizepolitical power — and this centralization can best be achieved within acollectivist society, such as socialist Russia, national socialist Germany, or aFabian socialist United States,There can be no full understanding and appreciation of twentieth-centuryAmerican politics and foreign policy without the realization that this financialelite effectively monopolizes Washington policy.In case after case, newly released documentation implicates this elite andconfirms this hypothesis. The revisionist versions of the entry of the UnitedStates into World Wars I and II, Korea, and Vietnam reveal the influence andobjectives of this elite.For most of the twentieth century the Federal Reserve System, particularly theFederal Reserve Bank of New York (which is outside the control of Congress,unaudited and uncontrolled, with the power to print money and create credit atwill), has exercised a virtual monopoly over the direction of the Americaneconomy. In foreign affairs the Council on Foreign Relations, superficially aninnocent forum for academics, businessmen, and politicians, contains within itsshell, perhaps unknown to many of its members, a power centre that unilaterallydetermines U.S. foreign policy. The major objective of this submerged — andobviously subversive — foreign policy is the acquisition of markets and economicpower (profits, if you will), for a small group of giant multinationals underthe virtual control of a few banking investment houses and controlling families.Through foundations controlled by this elite, research by compliant andspineless academics, “conservatives” as well as “liberals,” has been directedinto channels useful for the objectives of the elite essentially to maintainthis subversive and unconstitutional power apparatus.Through publishing houses controlled by this same financial elite unwelcomebooks have been squashed and useful books promoted; fortunately publishing hasfew barriers to entry and is almost atomistically competitive. Through controlof a dozen or so major newspapers, run by editors who think alike, publicinformation can be almost orchestrated at will. Yesterday, the space programme;today, an energy crisis or a campaign for ecology; tomorrow, a war in the MiddleEast or some other manufactured “crisis.”The total result of this manipulation of society by the Establishment elite hasbeen four major wars in sixty years, a crippling national debt, abandonment ofthe Constitution, suppression of freedom and opportunity, and creation of a vastcredibility gulf between the man in the street and Washington, D.C. While thetransparent device of two major parties trumpeting artificial differences,circus-like conventions, and the cliché of “bipartisan foreign policy” no longercarries credibility, and the financial elite itself recognizes that its policieslack public acceptance, it is obviously prepared to go it alone without evennominal public support.In brief, we now have to consider and debate whether this New York-based elitistEstablishment is a subversive force operating with deliberation and knowledge tosuppress the Constitution and a free society. That will be the task ahead in thenext decade.The Slowly Emerging Revisionist TruthThe arena for this debate and the basis for our charges of subversion is theevidence provided by the revisionist historian. Slowly, over decades, book bybook, almost line by line, the truth of recent history has emerged as documentsare released, probed, analyzed, and set within a more valid historicalframework.Let us consider a few examples. American entry into World War II was supposedlyprecipitated, according to the Establishment version, by the Japanese attack onPearl Harbor. Revisionists have established that Franklin D. Roosevelt andGeneral Marshall knew of the impending Japanese attack and did nothing to warnthe Pearl Harbor military authorities. The Establishment wanted war with Japan.Subsequently, the Establishment made certain that Congressional investigation ofPearl Harbor would fit the Roosevelt whitewash. In the words of Percy Greaves,chief research expert for the Republican minority on the Joint CongressionalCommittee investigating Pearl Harbor:The complete facts will never be known. Most of the so-called investigationshave been attempts to suppress, mislead, or confuse those who seek the truth.From the beginning to the end, facts and files have been withheld so as toreveal only those items of information which benefit the administration underinvestigation. Those seeking the truth are told that other facts or documentscannot be revealed because they are intermingled in personal diaries, pertain toour relations with foreign countries, or are sworn to contain no information ofvalue.3 [bm06.html#ch12fn3]But this was not the first attempt to bring the United States into war, or thelast. The Morgan interests, in concert with Winston Churchill, tried to bringthe U.S. into World War I as early as 1915 and succeeded in doing so in 1917.Colin Simpson’s Lusitania implicates President Woodrow Wilson in the sinking ofthe Lusitania — a horror device to generate a public backlash to draw the UnitedStates into war with Germany. Simpson demonstrates that Woodrow Wilson knew fourdays beforehand that the Lusitania was carrying six-million rounds of ammunitionplus explosives, and therefore, “passengers who proposed to sail on that vesselwere sailing in violation of statute of this country.”4 [bm06.html#ch12fn4]The British Board of Inquiry under Lord Mersey was instructed by the BritishGovernment “that it is considered politically expedient that Captain Turner, themaster of the Lusitania, be most prominently blamed for the disaster.”In retrospect, given Colin Simpson’s evidence, the blame is more fairly to beattributed to President Wilson, “Colonel” House, J. P. Morgan, and WinstonChurchill; this conspiratorial elite should have been brought to trial forwilful negligence, if not treason. It is to Lord Mersey’s eternal credit thatafter performing his “duty” under instructions from His Majesty’s government,and placing the blame on Captain Turner, he resigned, rejected his fee, and fromthat date on refused to handle British government commissions. To his friendsLord Mersey would only say about the Lusitania case that it was a “dirtybusiness.”Then in 1933-4 came the attempt by the Morgan firm to install a fascistdictatorship in the United States. In the words of Jules Archer, it was plannedto be a Fascist putsch to take over the government and “run it under a dictatoron behalf of America’s bankers and industrialists.”5 [bm06.html#ch12fn5] Again,a single courageous individual emerged — General Smedley Darlington Butler, whoblew the whistle on the Wall Street conspiracy. And once again Congress standsout, particularly Congressmen Dickstein and MacCormack, by its gutless refusalto do no more than conduct a token whitewash investigation,Since World War II we have seen the Korean War and the Vietnamese War —meaningless, meandering no-win wars costly in dollars and lives, with no othermajor purpose but to generate multibillion-dollar armaments contracts. Certainlythese wars were not fought to restrain communism, because for fifty years theEstablishment has been nurturing and subsidizing the Soviet Union which suppliedarmaments to the other sides in both wars — Korea and Vietnam. So ourrevisionist history will show that the United States directly or indirectlyarmed both sides in at least Korea and Vietnam.In the assassination of President Kennedy, to take a domestic example, it isdifficult to find anyone who today accepts the findings of the Warren Commission— except perhaps the members of that Commission. Yet key evidence is stillhidden from public eyes for 50 to 75 years. The Watergate affair demonstratedeven to the man in the street that the White House can be a vicious nest ofintrigue and deception.Of all recent history the story of Operation Keelhaul6 [bm06.html#ch12fn6] isperhaps the most disgusting. Operation Keelhaul was the forced repatriation ofmillions of Russians at the orders of President (then General) Dwight D.Eisenhower, in direct violation of the Geneva Convention of 1929 and thelong-standing American tradition of political refuge. Operation Keelhaul, whichcontravenes all our ideas of elementary decency and individual freedom, wasundertaken at the direct orders of General Eisenhower and, we may now presume,was a part of a long-range programme of nurturing collectivism, whether it beSoviet communism, Hitler’s Naziism, or FDR’s New Deal. Yet until recentpublication of documentary evidence by Julius Epstein, anyone who dared tosuggest Eisenhower would betray millions of innocent individuals for politicalpurposes was viciously and mercilessly attacked.7 [bm06.html#ch12fn7]What this revisionist history really teaches us is that our willingness asindividual citizens to surrender political power to an elite has cost the worldapproximately two-hundred-million persons killed from 1820 to 1975. Add to thatuntold misery the concentration camps, the political prisoners, the suppressionand oppression of those who try to bring the truth to light.When will it all stop? It will not stop until we act upon one simple axiom: thatthe power system continues only so long as individuals want it to continue, andit will continue only so long as individuals try to get something for nothing.The day when a majority of individuals declares or acts as if it wants nothingfrom government, declares it will look after its own welfare and interests, thenon that day power elites are doomed. The attraction to “go along” with powerelites is the attraction of something for nothing. That is the bait. TheEstablishment always offers something for nothing; but the something is takenfrom someone else, as taxes or plunder, and awarded elsewhere in exchange forpolitical support.Periodic crises and wars are used to whip up support for other plunder-rewardcycles which in effect tighten the noose around our individual liberties. And ofcourse we have hordes of academic sponges, amoral businessmen, and just plainhangers-on, to act as non-productive recipients for the plunder.Stop the circle of plunder and immoral reward and elitist structures collapse.But not until a majority finds the moral courage and the internal fortitude toreject the something-for-nothing con game and replace it by voluntaryassociations, voluntary communes, or local rule and decentralized societies,will the killing and the plunder cease."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX AProgramme of the National Socialist German Workers PartyNote: This programme is important because it demonstrates that the nature ofNaziism was known publicly as early as 1920.THE PROGRAMMEThe programme of the German Workers’ Party is limited as to period. The leadershave no intention, once the aims announced in it have been achieved, of settingup fresh ones, merely in order to increase the discontent of the massesartificially, and so ensure the continued existence of the Party.1. We demand the union of all Germans to form a Great Germany on the basis ofthe right of the self-determination enjoyed by nations,2. We demand equality of rights for the German People in its dealings with othernations, and abolition of the Peace Treaties of Versailles and St. Germain.3. We demand land and territory (colonies) for the nourishment of our people andfor settling our superfluous population.4. None but members of the nation may be citizens of the State. None but thoseof German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. No Jew,therefore, may be a member of the nation.5. Any one who is not a citizen of the State may live in Germany only as a guestand must be regarded as being subject to foreign laws.6. The right of voting on the State’s government and legislation is to beenjoyed by the citizen of the State alone. We demand therefore that all officialappointments, of whatever kind, whether in the Reich, in the country, or in thesmaller localities, shall be granted to citizens of the State alone.We oppose the corrupting custom of Parliament of filling posts merely with aview to party considerations, and without reference to character or capability.7. We demand that the State shall make it its first duty to promote the industryand livelihood of citizens of the State. If it is not possible to nourish theentire population of the State, foreign nationals (non-citizens of the State)must be excluded from the Reich.8. All non-German immigration must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans,who entered Germany subsequent to August 2nd, 1914, shall be required forthwithto depart from the Reich.9. All citizens of the State shall be equal as regards rights and duties.10. It must be the first duty of each citizen of the State to work with his mindor with his body. The activities of the individual may not clash with theinterests of the whole, but must proceed within the frame of the community andbe for the general good.We demand therefore:11. Abolition of incomes unearned by work.ABOLITION OF THE THRALDOM OF INTEREST12. In view of the enormous sacrifice of life and property demanded of a nationby every war, personal enrichment due to a war must be regarded as a crimeagainst the nation. We demand therefore ruthless confiscation of all war gains,13. We demand nationalisation of all businesses which have been up to thepresent formed into companies (Trusts),14. We demand that the profits from wholesale trade shall be shared out.15. We demand extensive development of provision for old age.16. We demand creation and maintenance of a healthy middle class, immediatecommunalisation of wholesale business premises, and their lease at a cheap rateto small traders, and that extreme consideration shall be shown to all smallpurveyors to the State, district authorities and smaller localities.17. We demand land-reform suitable to our national requirements, passing of alaw for confiscation without compensation of land for communal purposes;abolition of interest on land loans, and prevention of all speculation in land,18. We demand ruthless prosecution of those whose activities are injurious tothe common interest. Sordid criminals against the nation, usurers, profiteers,etc, must be punished with death, whatever their creed or race.19. We demand that the Roman Law, which serves the materialistic world order,shall be replaced by a legal system for all Germany.20. With the aim of opening to every capable and industrious German thepossibility of higher education and of thus obtaining advancement, the Statemust consider a thorough re-construction of our national system of education.The curriculum of all educational establishments must be brought into line withthe requirements of practical life. Comprehension of the State idea (Statesociology) must be the school objective, beginning with the first dawn ofintelligence in the pupil. We demand development of the gifted children of poorparents, whatever their class or occupation, at the expense of the State,21. The State must see to raising the standard of health in the nation byprotecting mothers and infants, prohibiting child labour, increasing bodilyefficiency by obligatory gymnastics and sports laid down by law, and byextensive support of clubs engaged in the bodily development of the young.22. We demand abolition of a paid army and formation of a national army,23. We demand legal warfare against conscious political lying and itsdissemination in the Press. In order to facilitate creation of a German nationalPress we demand:(a) that all editors of newspapers and their assistants, employing the Germanlanguage, must be members of the nation;(b) that special permission from the State shall be necessary before non-Germannewspapers may appear. These are not necessarily printed in the German language;(c) that non-Germans shall be prohibited by law from participating financiallyin or influencing German newspapers, and that the penalty for contravention ofthe law shall be suppression of any such newspaper, and immediate deportation ofthe non-German concerned in it.It must be forbidden to publish papers which do not conduce to the nationalwelfare. We demand legal prosecution of all tendencies in art and literature ofa kind likely to disintegrate our life as a nation, and the suppression ofinstitutions which militate against the requirements above-mentioned.24. We demand liberty for all religious denominations in the State, so far asthey are not a danger to it and do not militate against the moral feelings ofthe German race.The Party, as such, stands for positive Christianity, but does not bind itselfin the matter of creed to any particular confession. It combats theJewish-materialist spirit within us and without us, and is convinced that ournation can only achieve permanent health from within on the principle:THE COMMON INTEREST BEFORE SELF25. That all the foregoing may be realised we demand the creation of a strongcentral power of the State. Unquestioned authority of the politicallycentralized Parliament over the entire Reich and its organisation; and formationof Chambers for classes and occupations for the purpose of carrying out thegeneral laws promulgated by the Reich in the various States of theconfederation.The leaders of the Party swear to go straight forward — if necessary tosacrifice their lives — in securing fulfilment of the foregoing Points.Munich, February 24th, 1920.Source: Official English translation by E.

Webb,President Ethyl Gasoline Corporation, 135 E. 42nd Street, New York City.Dear Mr. Webb: I learned through our Organic Chemicals Division today that theEthyl Gasoline Corporation has in mind forming a German company with the I.G. tomanufacture Ethyl lead in that country.I have just had two weeks in Washington, no inconsiderable part of which wasdevoted to criticising the interchanging with foreign companies of chemicalknowledge which might have a military value. Such giving of information by anindustrial company might have the gravest repercussions on it. The EthylGasoline Corporation would be no exception, in fact, would probably be singledout for special attack because of the ownership of its stock.It should seem, on the face of it, that the quantity of Ethyl lead used forcommercial purposes in Germany would be too small to go after. It has beenclaimed that Germany is secretly arming. Ethyl lead would doubtless be avaluable aid to military aeroplanes.I am writing you this to say that in my opinion under no conditions should youor the Board of Directors of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation disclose any secretsor ‘know how’ in connection with the manufacture of tetraethyl lead to Germany.I am informed that you will be advised through the Dyestuffs Division of thenecessity of disclosing the information which you have received from Germany toappropriate War Department officials.Yours very truly,Source: United States Senate, Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Committee onMilitary Affairs, Scientific and Technical Mobilization, 78th Congress, SecondSession, Part 16, (Washington D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1944), p. 939."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX EExtract from Morgenthau Diary (Germany) Regarding Sosthenes Behn of I.T.TMarch 16, 194511:30 a.m.GROUP MEETINGBretton Woods — I.T. & T. — ReparationsPresent:Mr. WhiteMr. FussellMr. FeltusMr. CoeMr. DuBoisMrs. KlotzH.M., Jr.: Frank, can you boil down this business on I.T. & T.?Mr. Coe: Yes, sir. I.T. & T. by the way did transfer or did get $15 millionyesterday or a few days ago of their debts in dollars paid to them by theSpanish Government and that they are allowed to do under our general licence, sothat’s all right. However, it is in part in their representation to us, part ofa deal for the sale of the company in Spain, so they are trying thereby to forceour hand. Now, the proposition which they have had up over some years indifferent forms now takes this form. They can get their receivables paid off indollars, which they say they have not been able to do hitherto — either $15million now and $10 million or $11 million later. They will sell the company toSpain and take in return $30 million worth of bonds — Spanish Government bonds —which are to be amortized over a number of years and roughly at the rate of $2million per annum, and they are to receive 20% of those exports in order toamortize bonds faster, if they are to export it to the United States.H. M. Jr.: Like the match dealer I mentioned in my speech.Mr. Coe: That’s right. The Spanish Government. They are willing, they say — theyare able to get from the Spanish Government assurances, that these will not be,that the shares which the Spanish Government intends to resell will not go toanybody on the black list, and so forth. In some negotiations we have had withthem over the last few weeks, they have been willing to come further on that.Our hesitation on the matter relates to two things; First, that you can’t trustFranco, and that if they are able — if Franco is able to sell $50 million worthof shares of this company in Spain in the next period of time, he may very wellsell it to pro-German interests. It seems doubtful that he would be able todispose of it to the Spaniards, so that is the first thing. The second thing wecan’t document too well, but I think it is more pronounced in my mind than inthe minds of the Foreign Funds and legal people. I don’t think we can reallytrust Behn either.Mr. White: I’m sure you can’t.Mr. Coe: We have records here of interviews, going far back, that some of yourmen had with Behn — Klaus was one — in which Behn said that he had hadconversations with Goering with the proposition that Goering was to hold I.T. &T.’s property in Germany, and as you recall, I.T. & T. here did try to purchaseGeneral Aniline and make it an American company thereby and that was part of thedeal which Behn told State and our lawyers very frankly he had discussed. Hethought it was perfectly all right protecting property: That was before weentered the war.H. M., Jr.: I don’t remember that.Mr. Coe: The man in charge of their properties now is Westrick who you recallcame over here and was mixed up with Texaco. They tried in every way to cook updeals earlier to escape. They are tied up with top German group and etc. On theother hand, Colonel Behn has been used several times as an emissary by the StateDepartment, and I believe he is personally on very good terms with Stettinius.We have heard from State on this letter saying they have no objections. Weproposed to you earlier — the letter which I sent in to you suggesting that youask State, if in view of our safe haven objectives, they still said yes. I amconfident from talking with them on the phone the last day or two, they willwrite back and say yes, they still think it is a good deal,H. M., Jr.: This is the position I am in. As you gentlemen know I amoverextended now and I can’t go into this thing personally, and I think that weare just going to have to throw the thing in the lap of the State Department,and if they want to clear it, all right. I just haven’t got the time or theenergy to fight them on that basis.Mr. Coe: Then we ought to licence it now.Mr. White: First you ought to get a letter. I agree with the Secretary on thispoint of view that this fellow Behn is not to be trusted around the corner.There is something about this deal that looks suspicious and has been for thelast couple of years we have been dealing with him. However, it is one thing tobelieve that and another thing to defend that before the pressure that will bebrought in here that they are trying to deprive this company of the businessdeal, but I think that what we might do is get the State Department on recordthat in view of a safe haven project they don’t think that there is any dangerthat any of these assets — I would cite some of them, spell the letter out. Getthem down on record and even make them a little frightened and hold out or theywill at least have had the record and you will have called their attention tothese dangers. This fellow Behn hates our guts anyway. We have been standingbetween him and deals for 4 years, at least.H. M., Jr.: Follow what White said. Something along that line. “Dear Mr.Stettinius: I am bothered about these things due to the following facts, and Iwould like you to advise me whether we should or should not. . . .”Mr. White: “In view of the danger that German assets may be cloaked here, thefuture —” and let him come back and say, “No,” and we’ll watch him.Mr. Coe: We said we wanted to give Acheson something Monday.H. M., Jr.: And if you get that ready for me by tomorrow morning, I’ll sign it.Mr. Coe: O.K.Source: United States Senate, Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration ofthe Internal Security Act.

Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken of EindhovenHolland, see Chapter 11, “Electric Eels,” in James Stewart Martin, op cit.Martin was Chief of the Economic Warfare Division of the U.S. Department ofJustice and comments that “The A.E.G. of Germany was largely controlled by theAmerican company, General Electric.” The assumption by this author is that theG. E. influence was somewhat less than controlling although substantial enough.Because of Martin’s official position and access to official documents, notknown to the author, his statement that A.E.G. was “largely controlled” by U.S.General Electric cannot be lightly dismissed. However, if we accept that G.E.“largely controlled” A.E.G., then the most serious questions arise which clamourfor investigation. A.E.G. was a prime financier of Hitler and “control” wouldmore deeply implicate the U.S. parent company than is suggested by the evidencepresented here.14.

Consequently, “production during the war was adequate until November1944” and “in the opinion of Speer assistants and plant officials the war effortin Germany was never hindered in any important manner by any shortage ofelectrical equipment.” Difficulties arose only at the very end of the war whenthe whole economy was threatened with collapse. The report concluded, “Allimportant needs for electrical equipment in 1944 may therefore be said to havebeen met, since plans were always optimistic.”18.

The English text for this chapter is translated from an authenticatedsurviving German translation of a copy of the Dutch edition of De Geldbronnenvan Het Nationaal-Socialisme (Drie Gesprekken Met Hitler), or The FinancialSources of National Socialism (Three conversations with Hitler. The originalDutch author is given as “Door Sidney Warburg, vertaald door J.G. Shoup” (BySidney Warburg, as told by J.G. Shoup).The copy used here was translated from the Dutch by Dr. Walter Nelz, WilhelmPeter, and Rene Sonderegger in Zurich, February 11, 1947, and the Germantranslation bears an affidavit to the effect that: “The undersigned threewitnesses do verify that the accompanying document is none other than a true andliteral translation from Dutch into German of the book by Sidney Warburg, a copyof which was constantly at their disposal during the complete process oftranslation. They testify that they held this original in their hands, and thatto the best of their ability they read it sentence by sentence, translating itinto German, comparing then the content of the accompanying translation to theoriginal conscientiously until complete agreement was reached.”5. Note that “von Heydt” was the original name for the Dutch Bank voor Handelen Scheepvaart N.V., a subsidiary of the Thyssen interests and now known to havebeen used as a funnel for Nazi funds. See Elimination of German Resources.6. Examination of the index for the New York Times confirms the accuracy of thelatter part of this statement. See for example the sudden rush of interest bythe New York Times, September 15, 1930 and the feature article on “Hitler,Driving Force in Germany’s Fascism” in the September 21, 1930 issue of the NewYork Times. In 1929 the New York Times listed only one brief item on AdolfHitler. In 1931 it ran a score of substantial entries, including no fewer thanthree “Portraits.”7.
