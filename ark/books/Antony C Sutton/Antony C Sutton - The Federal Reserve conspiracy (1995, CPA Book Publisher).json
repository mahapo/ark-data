Sutton, D.Sc. was born in London, England in 1925, spent most of his life in the United States and has been a citizen for 40 years. With an academic background in economics and engineering, Sutton has worked in mining exploration, iron and steel industries before graduate school at UCLA. In the 1960s he was Professor of Economics at California State University, Los Angeles, followed by seven years as a Research Fellow at Stanford University. While at the Hoover Institution (Stanford), Sutton wrote the three volume definitive work on Soviet technology, Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development (still in print after 25 years). This was followed by National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union (Arlington House) which accused the Establishment of killing Am ericans in Vietnam with our own technology. Hoover Institution, under pressure from the White House, arbitrarily converted Sutton to a \"non-person\" by removing his Fellowship. Intrigued by the powerful forces behind this assault, he then researched and wrote another three volumes on the financial and political support given by Wall Street international bankers to three variants of socialism. These were published as Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler and Wall Street and FDR (all in the 1970s). After leaving Stanford, Sutton edited The Phoenix Letter, a monthly newsletter on the Abuse of Power (still published today) and in 1990 started another newsletter, Future Technology Intelligence Report, covering suppressed technology.

Conventional wisdom dictates that anyone who attacks the Federal Reserve System is doomed and Congressional investigation of the Fed would result in economic chaos and a disastrous plunge in the stock market. Recently President Clinton got to appoint Alan Blinder to a seat on the seven-member Board of Governors. Blinder launched into criticism of Fed actions, i.e ., interest rates are too high and differed from the policy laid down by Chairman Alan Greenspan. Poor Blinder was blindsided by the establishment press and no doubt received advice to keep quiet because since this initial speech, Blinder has repeatedly st ated there are no differences between himself and Chairman Greenspan and refuses to go beyond this curious mea culpa. There is a vast misconception about the Fed. The President and the Congress have very little , if any, influence on policy. The Congress handed over all monetary powers to the Fed in 1913. The Fed is a private bank, owned by banks, and pays dividends on its shares owned only by banks. The Fed is a private Bankers' Bank. 1"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy Yet Fed policy, not Government policy, is the dominant factor in economic growth. The Fed can create jobs by loosening credit. The Government talks a lot about creating jobs but in fact can only create bureaucracies which restrict rather th an promote enterprise. The private sector creates productive jobs and the private sector is heavily dependent on Fed policy to do this. The Congress has never investigated the Fed and is highly unlikely to do so. No one sees Fed a ccounts; they are not audited. No balance sheets are issued. No one, but no one, ever criticizes the Fed and survives. Why all the secrecy and caution? Simply because the Fed has a legal monopoly of money granted by Congress in 1913 proceedings that were unconstitutional and fraudulent. Most of Congress had no idea of the contents of the Federal Reserve Bill signed by President Woodrow Wilson who was in debt to Wall Street. The Federal Reserve has the power to create money. This money is fiction, created out of nothing. This can be money in the form of created credit through the discount window at which other banks borrow at the discount rate of interest or it can be notes printed by the Treasury and sold to the Fed and paid for by Fed-created funds In brief, this private group of bankers has a money machine monopoly. This monopoly is uncontrolled by anyone and is guaranteed profit. Further, the monopoly doesn't have to answer questions or produce books or file annual statements. It is an unrestricted money monopoly. This book explains how this money monopoly came about. Obviously, Congress and the general public were misled and lied to when the Federal Reserve Bank was in discussion. Why the monopoly has continued is that the public is lazy, and so long as their individual world is reasonably fulfilling, has no reason to question Fed actions. 2"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Bankers' Bank Even if they do they will find few books that surface the real facts.

These arguments are that the Republic and the Constitution are always in danger from the so- called \"money power,\" a group of autocrats, an elite we would call them today, who have manipulat ed the political power of the state to gain a monopoly over money issue. Our modern academics even ignore Thomas Jefferson's chief reason for remaining in politics, i.e., to save the newly born United States from those elitists Jefferson called \"monocrats\" and \"monopolists.\" It was the banking monopoly that Jefferson considered to be the greatest danger to the survival of the Republic. The Jeffersonian ideal, one th at contemporary elitists and Marxists sneer at, was a Republic comprising small property owning citizens (Marx would la ter call them bourgeoisie and Nelson Rockefeller used to call them \"peasants\") with a sense of civic awareness and a regard for the rights of their neighbors.

While Jefferson rejected socialist ideas he equally rejected the monopoly power of banking interests and feared what elitist banking power would do to American liberties. Said Jefferson: If the American people ever allow the banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all propert y until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers occupied. The issuing power of money should be taken from the banks and restored to Congress and the people to whom it belongs. I sincerely believe the banking institutions are more dangerous to liberty than standing armies. (1) The First Private Banking Monopoly The Founding Fathers' discussion of banks and the money power reflect the clash of political philo sophies among early Americans with Alexander Hamilton on one side and Jefferson, Madison and Franklin on the Jeffersonian side. Hamilton represented the autocratic tradition prominent in Europe that figured on winning through a banking monopoly what could not be won politically. It was Hamilton who introduced a bill in December, 1790 into the House of Representatives to grant a charter for the privately owned Bank of the United States, thus creating the first private money monopoly in the U.S., a predecessor to the privately owned Federal Reserve System. And it was Alexander Hamilton who just a few years before wrote the charter for the Bank of New York, the first bank in New York City. Isaac Roosevelt, great-great-grandfather 6"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Thomas Jefferson and the Money Power of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was its second president, from 1796- 1791. The Hamiltonian proposal for a national bank was a charter for private monopoly, a Congressional grant for a privileged few. The Bank of the U.S. had the sole right to issue currency, it was exempt from taxation, and the U.S. government was ultimately responsible for its actions and debts. As d escribed by George Bancroft: Hamilton recommended a National Bank with a capital of ten or fifteen million dollars, to be paid one-third in hard money and the other two-thirds in European funds or landed security. It was to be erected into a legal corporation for thirty years, during which no other bank, public or priv ate, was to be permitted. Its capital and deposits were to be exempt from taxation, and the United States, collectively and par ticularly, were to become conjointly responsible for all its transactions. Its sources of profit were to be the sole right of issuing a currency for the United States equal in amount to the whole capital stock of the bank. (2) Public reaction to Congressiona l grant of a private banking monopoly for a group of private citizens was caustic. Declared James Madison: In case of a universal circulation of the notes of the proposed bank, the profits will be so great that the government ought to receive a very considerable sum for granting the charter. There are other defects...and the right to establish subordinate banks ought not to be delegated to any set of men under Heaven. (3) In the Senate, William McClay made a strong denunciation: 7"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy Jan. 17 (1790) Monday. I told them plainly that I was no advocate of the banking system; that I considered them machines for promoting the profits of unproductive Men;...that the whole profit of the bank ought to belong to the public, provided it was possible to advance the whole stock on her account. But I must remark that the public was grossly imposed upon in the present instances. While she (Ed: the public,) advanced all specie; individuals (Ed: the bank organizers) advanced three- fourths in certificates, which were of no more value in the support of the bank than so much stubble. Besides, the certificates were all under interest already, and it was highly unjust that other paper (money) should be issued on their credit which bore a premium and operated as a further tax on the country. (4) Hamilton's proposal was referred to a Senate Committee. But this Committee included Philip Schyler (Hamilton's father-in-law) and all its members shared Hamilton's political views. In brief, the Committee was stacked. President Washington then referred the bill to Thomas Jefferson (Secretary of State) and Edmund Randolph (Attorney General). Both found it to be unconstitutional. Jefferson's opinion on the unconstitutionality of the bank included the following powerful argument: I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid on this ground; That \"all powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states, or to the people.\" 8"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Thomas Jefferson and the Money Power To take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specifically drawn around the powers of Co ngress is to take possession of a boundless field of power no longer susceptible of any definition. The Bill delivers us up bound to the National Bank, who are free to refuse all arrangements, but on their own terms, and the public not free, on such refusal, to employ any other bank. (5) The Bank of New York This was not Alexander Hamilton's first proposal for a self- interested bank charter: five years earlier, in 1784, Hamilton joined with Isaac Roosevelt and others to create the Bank of New York. It is remarkable that academics have not emphasized the association of the Roosevelt family with the Bank of New York, the first bank founded in New York City and New York State and also one of the very first banks founded in the United States. Only the Bank of North America and the Pennsylvania Bank organized during the Revolutionary War preceded the Bank of New York. The initial meeting of the Bank of New York was held March 15, 1784 and the following directors were present: (6) Alexander McDougal (President) Wlliam Maxwell Samuel Franklin Nicholas Low Robert Bowne Daniel McCormick Comfort Sands Isaac Roosevelt Alexander Hamilton John Vanderbilt Joshua Waddington Thomas Randall Thomas B. Stoughton Alexander Hamilton, who as we have seen, staunchly opposed Thomas Jefferson and the Jeffersonian democratic tradition in American politics, was connected with the Bank of New York from the start. The constitution of the Bank of 9"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy ___________________________ New York was in fact written by Alexander Hamilton. And as most of the newly elected officers of the bank were not familiar with banking business it was Alexander Hamilton who provided a letter of introduction to the Bank of North America which supplied the necessary in formation and guidance. The first president of the Ba nk of New York was Jeremiah Wadsworth. His tenure was brief and in May, 1786 Isaac Roosevelt was elected president, with William Maxwell as vice president. The bank offices were in the old Walton House with the Roosevelt sugar refinery just across the street at number 159 Quinn Street. Conflict of interest is more than obvious on the part of Alexander Hamilton, who became Secretary of the Treasury when the Constitution of the United States went into effect in 1789. While Hamilton did not take a daily active part as director of the Bank of New York, Hamilton advised its cashier William Seaton, and in 1790 the bank of New York was made an agent of the United States government for the sale of 200,000 guilders. Simultaneously Hamilton laid before Congress the idea of the Bank of the United States -a private banking monopoly. Furthermore Hamilton used his cabinet influence to prevent the Bank of the United States from establishing a branch in the City of New York, in competition with the Bank of New York. It also appears that Hamilton tried to make the Bank of New York the exclusive agent of the United States government in New York. In January, 1791 Alexander Hamilton wrote to William Seaton as follows: I shall labor to give what has taken place a turn favorable to another union the pr opriety of which is to say clearly illustrated by the present state of things. It is my wish that the Bank of New 10"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Thomas Jefferson and the Money Power York may by all means continue to receive deposits from the collection in the paper of the Bank of the United States and that they may also receive payment for the Dutch bills in the same paper. (7) Later in the same letter, Hamilton writes as follows: Be confidential with me if you are pressed whatever support may be in my power shal l be afforded. I consider the public interest as materially involved in aiding a valuable institution like yours to withstand the attacks of a confederated host of frantic and I fear in too many instances unprincipled gamblers. Alexander Hamilton was also overly protective when in 1791 a rival bank was proposed for New York City. When Hamilton heard of the project he expressed strong disapproval in a letter to William S eaton dated January 18, 1791: I have learned with infinite pa in the circumstance of a new bank having started up in your city. Its effects cannot but be in every way pernicious . I sincerely hope that the Bank of New York will listen to no coalition with this newly engendered monster, a better alliance I am strongly persuaded will be brought about for it and the joint force of two solid institutions will without effort or violence remove the excrescence just appeared. I express myself in these strong terms to you confiden tially not that I have any objection to my opinion in be ing known as to the natural tendency of the thing. (8) According to Myers' History of the Great American Fortunes (9) the Bank of New York \"injected itself virulently into politics and fought the spread of de mocratic ideas with sordid but effective weapons.\" It is Myers' contention that the bank and its founders in the Hamiltonian tradition fully 11"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy understood the danger to their financial interests in the Jeffersonian principle. Even in 1930 the Bank of New York contained a representative of the Roosevelt interests - W.

Morgan partner influential in the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. (10) The Second Bank of the United States On March 4, 1809 James Madison, a quiet, unassuming man, entered the office of President. In 1776 Madison was a member of the Virginia Convention and served on the committee which framed the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. In 1787 Madison became a member of the Virginia delegation to the Philadelphia Convention and made specific constitutional suggestions, assembled in the so-called 'Virginia Plan.\" In many ways Madison can be termed the \"master builder of the Constitution.\" Consequently Madison' s views on the constitutionality of private banking monopolies are fundamental. The charter of the First Bank expired in 1811 and Congress refused to grant a new charter on the grounds of unconstitutionality. President Madison's message repeated the argument on the unconstitutionality of the bank and made the following comment: On the whole it is considered that the proposed establishments will: 1. enjoy a monopoly of the profits of a National Bank for a period of twenty years; 2. that the monopolized profits will be continually growing with the progress of the national population and wealth; 3. and that the nation will, during the same period, be dependent on the notes of the bank for the 12"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"_________________ Thomas Jefferson and the Money Power species of circulating me dium whenever the precious metals may be wanted; and 4. at all times (will the nation be dependent on the notes of the bank) for so much thereof as may be an eligible substitute for a specie medium; and 5. that the extensive employment of the notes (bank) in the collection of the augmented taxes w ill, moreover, enable the banks greatly to extend its profitable issues of them (bank notes) without the expense of specie capital to support their circulation; It is as reasonable as it is requisite that the government, in return for these extraordinary concessions to the bank, should have a greater security for attain ing the public objects of the institution than is presented in this Bill.... (11) The War of 1812 presented bank supporters with a new argument - financial distress brought about by the war required financial relief in the form of a new national bank.

According to modern academic opinion the Jackson veto is \"legalistic, demagogic and full of sham.\" (1) In fact, on reading the message today Andrew Jackson was clearly prophetic in his warnings and arguments to the American people. In the first inaugural address in January 1832, Jackson stated his position on the bank and renewal of the charter: As the Charter of the Bank of the United States will expire in 1836, and its stockholders will most probably apply for a renewal of their privileges; in order to avoid the evils resulting from precipitancy in a measure involving such important principles and such deep pecuniary interests, I feel that I cannot in justice to our constituents and to the parties interested too soon present it to the 17"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy deliberate consideration of the Legislature and the people.

(2) Andrew Jackson's personal view on the Second Bank of the United States is contained in a memorandum in Jackson's own handwriting written in January, 1832. (3) The opinion shows how far presen t constitutional interpretation has diverged from the intent of our founding fathers. Jackson's opening argument is that all \"sovereign power is in the people and the states,\" and then argues that in cases, such as the power to grant corporations, where the power is not expressly given to the general (Federal) government, then \"no sovereign power not expressly granted can be exercised, by implication.\" The key is \"implied power.\" There are no implied powers in the Constitution. Jackson goes on to argue that it may be possible for \"necessity\" to give power to grant charters to banks and corporations, but this must be a \"positive necessity not a fained one .\" And then only within the ten mile square of Washington, DC itself does Congress have such sovereign power. Jackson argues as follows: It is inconsistent with any of the powers granted that our government should form a corporation and become a member of it. The founders were too well aware of the corrupting influence of a great moneyed monopoly upon government to legalize such a corrupting monster 18"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Andrew Jackson: The Last Anti-Elitist President by any grant either expressed or implied in the Constitution. The extraordinary difficulty and massive political power that Jackson faced in fighting the \"money monopoly\" and its influence is shown in his letter to H ugh L.

The struggles against the rechartering of the United States Bank are to be met. The corrupting influence of the Bank upon the morals of the people and upon Congress are to be fearlessly met.... Many who you would not have supposed have secretly enlisted in its ranks and between bank men nullifiers and internal improvement men it is hard to get a cabinet who will unite with me heart and hand in the great task of democratic reform in the administration of our government. (4) By 1833 the struggle over the r echartering of the Bank of the United States had degenerated in to a conflict between Andrew Jackson and his secretary of the treasury, William J. Duane and ultimately led to dismissal of Duane. Jackson wanted to withdraw all government deposits from the private Bank of the United States while Duane refused to order removal of the deposits. In a letter dated June 26, 1833 (Vol. 5, page 111) Andrew Jackson expands on his demand for withdrawal of government deposits from the Bank of the United States, and proposes that one bank be selected in each of various cities to receive government deposits. State banks with good credit would be preferable to th e concentration of 19"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy ___________________________ government funds in one ba nk which wa s a private monopoly. The letter was accompanied by a paper explaining Jackson's views on possible government relations with the Bank of the United States and the future. Incl uded was this straightforward statement: The framers (of our Constitution) were too well aware of the corrupting influences of a great moneyed monopoly upon government to legalize such a corrupting monster by any grant either express or implied in the constitution. Bank corporations are brokers on a large scale, and could it be really urged that the framers of the Constitution intended that our Government should become a Government of Brokers? If so, then the profits of the National Brokers Shop must enure to the benefit of the whole people, and not a few privileged moneyed capitalists , to the utter rejection of the many. (5) The opinion recalled that in December 1831 Congress petitioned for a renewal of the bank charter and Jackson had vetoed the bill. As Jackson was then a candidate for reelection this in effect brought the veto dire ctly before the el ectorate and in approving the president the public also condemned the bill as both \"inexpedient and unconstitutional.\" In other words Jackson argued that his veto had already received public approval. Theref ore, Jackson continued, \"the duty of the bank was to wind up its concerns in such a manner that will produce the least pressure upon the money market.\" Jackson recalled the extraordinary and rapid increase of government debt to the bank which had grown by $28 20"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Andrew Jackson: The Last Anti-Elitist President million or 66 percent in a period of 16 months. Jackson commented as follows: The motive of the enormous exten sion of loans can no longer be doubted. It was unquestionably to gain power in the country and force the government through the influence of the debtors to grant it a new charter. This must be the first and last statement from an American President declaring what many now su spect: that certain banks (but not all bankers) use debt as a political weapon for control. We cannot include all bankers because bankers in Catholic countries, for example, are forbidden on grounds of religion fr om using debt for control. This would amount to usury. Jackson goes on to outline the r easons for his wish to sever connections between the bank and the government: a leading objection is that the Bank of the United States has the power and in that event will have the disposition to crush the state banks particularly those which may be selected by the government as the depositories of its funds and thus cause wide spread distress and ruin throughout the United States. Then Jackson makes an argument strange to the ears of those reading in the 20th century: The only currency known to th e Constitution of the United States is gold and silver. This is consequently the only currency which that instrument delegates to Congress the power to regulate.

President Andrew Jackson's final message on March 4, 1837 was unbelievably prophetic in its content - and the last time an American President was sufficiently independent of the elitist powers behind the scenes to publicly warn American citizens of the dangers to their freedoms and livelihood. Here is an extract from Jackson's final message to the American people: The distress and alarm which pervaded and agitated the whole country when the Bank of the United States waged war upon the people in order to compel them to submit to its demands cannot yet be forgotten. The ruthless and unsparing temper with which whole cities and communities were oppressed, individuals impoverished and ruined, and a scene of cheerful prosperity suddenly changed into one of gloom and despondency ought to be indelibly impressed on the memory of the people of the United States. If such was its power in a time of peace, what would it not have been in a season of war, w ith an enemy at your doors? No nation but the free men of the United States could have come out victorious from such a contest; yet, if you had not conquered, the government would have passed from the hands of the many to the few, and this organized money pow er, from its secret conclave, would have dictated the choice of your highest officials and compelled you to make peace or war, as best suited their own wishes.

While one branch of the Roosevelt family developed the Bank of New York and the sugar refining industr y, another branch of the family worked its way into practical po litics and even theoretical political philosophy. For example, long before Franklin Delano Roosevelt became President, James J. Roosevelt was a member of the New York State Legislature in 1835, 1839, and 1840, a member of the Loco Focos and distinguished himself by opposition to Whig attempts to eliminate \"ballot stuffing.\" (1) Roosevelt was not only powerful within Tammany Hall's inner circle but according to one biographer, \"he was in effect liaison officer between the Hall and Wall Street, one who carried orders from the bankers to the politicians and dictat ed nominations and elections in a ruthless manner.\" (2) James Roosevelt was the 1840s link between the inner circles of Tammany Hall and Wall Street banking including the Roosevelts' own Bank of New York. But it was Clinton Roosevelt, born in 1804, son of Elbert Cornelius Roosevelt, who provided a socialist manifesto some years before Marx plagiarized his more famous Communist Manifesto from French Socialist Victor Considerant (see Chapter Five). Clinton Roosevelt was a 19th-century cousin to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and incidentally also related to President Theodore Roosevelt, John Quincy Adams, and President Martin Van Buren. Clinton Roosevelt's only literary effort is contained in a rare booklet dated 1841. (3) In essence it is a Socratic discussion between the author Roosevelt (i.e., the few) and a \"Producer\" presumably representing the rest of us (i.e., the many). Roosevelt proposes a totalitarian government much like Karl Marx's, where all individuality is submerged to a collective run by an elitist aristocratic group (i.e., the few, or 26"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Roosevelt's Socialist Manifesto the vanguard in Marxist terms) who design and enact all legislation. Roosevelt demanded abandonment of the Constitution to achieve his goals: P. (Producer): But I ask again: Would you at once abandon the old doctrines of the Constitution? A. (Author): Not by any means. Not any more than if one were in a leaky vessel he should spring overboard to save himself from drowning. It is a ship put hastily together when we left the British flag, and it was then thought an experiment of very doubtful issue. (4) The Rooseveltian system depended \"First, on the art and science of cooperation. This is to bring the whole to bear for our mutual advantage.\" It is this cooperation, i.e., the ability to bring the whole to bear for the interest of the few, that is the encompassing theme of writings and preachings from Marx to the present Trilateral Commission. In the Roosevelt schema each man rises through fixed and specified grades in the social system and is appointed to a class of work to which he is best suited. Choice of occupation is strictly limited. In the words of Clinton Roosevelt: Whose duty will it be to make appointments to each class? A. The Grand Marshal's. P. Who will be accountable that the men appointed are the best qualified? A.

No. If any one of good character insisted, he might try until he found the occupation mo st congenial to his tastes and feelings.

What is the duty of the Marshal of the Creating or Producing order? A. It is to estimate the amount of produce and manufactures necessary to produce a sufficiency in each department below him.

(6) Seventy-five years later, in 1915, Bernard Baruch was invited by President Woodrow Wilson to design a plan for a defense mobilization committee. This Baruch plan subsequently became the War Industries Board, which absorbed and replaced the old General Munitions Board. The War Industries Board as a concept was similar to cooperative trade associations, a device long desired by Wall Street to control the unwanted rigors of competition in the marketplace, and much like Clinton Roosevelt's 1841 Plan. Committees of industry, big business and small business, both represented in Washington, and both with Washington representation back home ... this was to be the backbone of the whole structure. By March, 1918, President Wilson, acting without Congressional authority, had endowed Baruch with more power than any other individual had been granted in the history of the United States. The War Industries Board, with Baruch as its chairman, became responsible for building all factories and for the supply of all raw material, all products, and all transportation, and all its fi nal decisions rested with chairman Baruch. The War Industries Board was the organizational forerunner of the 1933 National Recovery Administration and some of the 1918 WIB corporate elite appointed by Baruch - Hugh Johnson, for example - found administrative niches in Roosevelt's NRA Plan.

The ten points of the Marxian Manifesto, a program de signed to overthrow the middle class bourgeoisie (not the big cap italists) have been implemented by successive Democrat and Republican governments since Woodrow Wilson under guidance of a self-perpetuating establishment. Marx's big enemy was the middle class, the bourgeoisie. Marx wanted to seize property from this middle class in a revolution led by the so-called work ing class, or the proletariat. Unfortunately for Marx the worki ng class has never had too much liking for communist revolution, as we saw in the Revolutions of the 1980s. In practice, communist revolution is led by a handful of communists. How can a revoluti on be made and kept in power by a small group? Only because communists have always had help from the so-called ruling clas s - capitalists and bankers. This aid and assistance has been cons istent from financing Marx's Manifesto in 1848 down to the late 20th century when a David Rockefeller-dominated Administration is helping Communist revolution and revolutio naries in Central America, Angola and Mozambique. 33"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy Let's start with the 1848 Manifesto. Marx wanted to seize middle class property. In the Manifesto, Ma rx phrased the objective like this: In the first instance, of course, this can only be effected by despotic interference with bourgeoi s methods of production; that is to say by measures which seem economically inadequate and untenable, but have far-reaching effects, and are necessary as means for revolutionizing the whole system of production. (1) To bring about this \"despotic\" seizure of middle class property, Marx laid out a ten-point program of \"measures\" as follows: These measures will naturally differ from country to country. In the most advanced countries they will, generally speaking, take the following forms: 1. Expropriation of landed property, and the use of landrents to defray State expenditure. 2. A vigorously graduated income tax. 3. Abolition of the right of inheritance. 4. Confiscation of the property of all emigres and rebels. 5. Centralisation of credit in the ha nds of the State, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly. 6. Centralisation of the means of transport in the hands of the State. 7. Increase of national factories and means of production, cultivation of uncultivated land, and 34"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Karl Marx and His Manifesto improvement of cultivated land in accordance with a general plan. 8. Universal and equal obligation to work; organisation of industrial armies, especially for agriculture. 9. Agriculture and urban industry to work hand-in-hand, in such a way as, by degrees, to obliterate the distinction between town and country. 10. Public and free education of all children. Abolition of factory work fo r children in its present form. Education and material production to be combined. (2) As we shall see later, Marx's ten points for destruction of the middle class have almost been comple ted in the United States. The 16th Amendment, for example (the income tax) is an archaic political concept that goes back some 4,000 ye ars in history to the time of the Pharaohs in Egypt. The Pharaohs and their elitist advisors had the notion that the entrepreneur, the businessmen, and the workers of Egypt who produced the wealth of that civilization somehow were not competent to manage that wealth. These elitist advisors and Pharaoh said, \"Look, we're going to force you people to do what we know you should. Because after all, were omnipotent, we are standing up here looking down on all of you and we can decide what is best for all. Much better than each of you can individually decide for yourselves. We're going to force you to have a government retirement program, so that when you reach retirement age you can retire with some dignity. We're going to force you to do what we know you should do, because we kn ow you won't do it if left to your own devices. Also, we're going to force you to have a government food storage program. We're going to 35"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Federal Reser ve Cons piracy_____________________________ store grain in the government granaries because we know that you are not competent - you are not capable of storing food by yourselves. \"Furthermore, we know you can't take care of your health so we're going to force you to have a government medical program. We know health is important and we know that you don't have the responsibility or capability for looking after yourselves. We're going to force it on you for your own best interests. \"The method used to accomplish these objectives was to withhold a fifth part of the production of Egypt. If you go back and read the Old Testament it says, \"That the Pharaoh had decided to take up a fifth power of the production of Egypt and to store it in granaries for the benefit of all.\" The modern day proponent of the Pharaoh's philosophy is none other than Karl Marx and the Comm unist Manifesto. The Manifesto has become the most significant economic document of the 20th Century. The significance lies in the unfortunate fact that the Manifesto is the economic guiding light of our leadership today, of the executive branch of our government and in most cases the leadership of both parties in this country who work to support and bring about the measures of the manifesto. Basically what the Manifesto states is that when you have implemented these 10 programs in any free enterprise system, \"capitalism\" will have been destroyed and a communist state established in its place. This is what Marx wrote: Strictly speaking, political power is the organized use of force by one class in order to keep another class in subjection. When the proletariat, in the course of its fight against the bourgeoisie, necessarily consolidates itself into a class, by means 36"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Karl Marx and His Manifesto of a revolution makes itself the ruling class, it forcibly sweeps away the old system of production. Item 2 of Marx's Manifesto reads as follows: A heavy, progressive, or graduating income tax\" This became the 16th Amendment of the United States Constitution, the law of the land in our country since 1913. Later on in 1913 we saw the passage of the Federal Reserve Act. Interestingly enough the idea for that program is in Karl Marx's program in the Communist Manifesto as Item 5 and is possibly the most important point in the Communist Manifesto. Item 5 reads as follows: Centralization of Credit in the hands of the state by means of a National Bank with state capital and exclusive monopoly. In other words Marx proposed a scheme exactly like the First Bank of the United States and the Federal Reserve Act with establishment of a fractional reserve central banking system on the model of the earlier European central banks. Karl Marx as a Plagiarist Marx was a brilliant fellow. He was no fool. Marx knew that if he could place under the control of a small group of men the ability to control the supply of money and credit of any nation, he could boom or bust those economies almost at will. By having foreknowledge of economic and monetary policies, billions of dollars of wealth could be transferred from one group to anothe r, from the suffering middle class to the ruling elite. To do this requi red propaganda and in the mid-19th century the pamphlet was an effective means of propagandizing. A most interesting feature of the brief Manifesto has been almost universally ignored by academics, i.e ., that the Manifesto doesn't favor the working class at all and it certainly doesn't favor the middle class which is targeted for elimination. 37"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy The Manifesto is a blueprint for elitist control. The Manifesto favors takeover of political and economic power by an elite. And when we look at the source of the assistance given to Marx, it is clear that the benefits to the elite were obvious even in the 1840s. Marx was certainly paid to write the Manifesto, as we shall see later. Furthermore, the Manifesto was plagiarized from an obscure French socialist named Victor Considerant, and his work, Principes du Socialisme: Manifeste de la Demo cratie au Dix Neuvieme Siecle, published in 1843. The second edition of Considerant's work was published in Paris in 1847, a year before the Manifesto and while Marx and Engels were living in Paris. The plagiarism was spotted by an even more obscure writer, W. Tcherkesoff, and published in precise detail in his Pages of Socialist History (Cooper, New York, 1902). Let Tcherkesoff explain Marx's plagiarism in his own words: I felt myself stupefied, indignant, even humiliated, when, about a year ago, I had occasion to read the work of Victor Considerant, \"Principles of Socialism: Manifesto of the Democracy of the Nineteenth Century,\" written in 1843, second edition published in 1847. There wa s reason for it. In a pamphlet of 143 pages, Victor Considerant expounds with his habitual clearness all the bases of Marxism , of this \"scientific\" Socialism that the parliamentarians desire to impose upon the whole world. Properly speaking, the theoretical part, in which Considerant treats of questions of principle, does not exceed the first 50 pages; the remainder is consecrated to th e famous prosecution that the government of Louis Philippe brought against the journal of the Fourierists, \"La Democratic 38"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Karl Marx and His Manifesto pacifique,\" and which the jurors of the Seine quashed. But in these 50 short pages the famous Fourierist, like a true master, gives us so many profound, clear, and brilliant generalizations, that even an infinitesimal portion of his ideas contains in entirety all the Marxian laws and theories -including the famous concentration of capital and the whole of the \"Manifesto of the Communist party.\" So that the whole theoretical part, that is chapters one and two, which Engels himself says \"are on the whole as correct today as ever,\" is simply borrowed. This \"Manifesto,\" this Bible of legal revolutionary democracy, is a very mediocre paraphrase of numerous pass ages of the \"Manifesto\" of V. Considerant. Not only have Marx and Engels found the contents of their \"Manifesto\" in the \"Manifesto\" of V. Considerant, but the form and the titles of the chapters have also been retained by the imitators. Paragraph two in the second chapt er with V. Considerant bears the title: \"The present Situation and '89; the Bourgeoisie and the Proletarians.\" \"The Bourgeois and the Proletarians,\" is the title of the first chapter with Marx and Engels. V. Considerant examines different Socialist and revolutionary parties under the name of Democracy and his paragraphs bear the titles: Stagnant Democracy; Retrograde Democracy; The Socialist Party in the Retrograde Democracy; The titles with Marx and Engels are: 39"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Federal Reser ve Cons piracy _____________________________ Reactionary Socialism Conservative and Bourgeois Socialism Critical Utopian Socialism and Communism Would not one think all these titles belonged to the selfsame work? When comparing the conten ts we shall see that in reality these two manifestos are identical. (3) Line by line Tcherkesoff demonstrates Marx to be a common thief. The great Marx, the adored Marx, rates no more than a third-rate school boy! There can be no argument concerning the massive influence of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels on world history. Yet, by contrast, the secondhand nature of Marxist ideas and arguments have always been overlooked. How about Marx's collaborator - Frederick Engels? The sloppiness of Engels' work has been documented in the introduction to Condition of the Working Class in England by W. O. Henderson and W. H. Chaloner (Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1958). As far back as 1848 Bruno Hildebrand compiled a detailed criticism of Engels' book and particul arly his biased interpretation of British government reports. Engels want ed to prove a case and distorted the facts to make the case. Further pointed out by Henderson and Chaloner, \"Engels' vivid imagination was sometimes used in lieu of facts.\" For example, on page 118 of Henderson we find: In evidence before a Parliamentary enquiry the Nottingham coroner stated that one druggist had admitted using 13 cwt. of treacle in a year in the manufac ture of Godfrey's Cordial. But in the 1887 edition of Engels this became \"used thirteen hundredweight of laudanum in one year in the preparation of Godfrey's Cordial.\" 40"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Karl Marx and His Manifesto Laudanum is of course tincture of opium and far different from treacle. The implication is that the children of the working class were being drugged. Marx's Financial Backers Where did Karl Marx get his money? How did he live? On investigation we find that funds came mainly from four sources, and each of these four sources can be linke d to the ruling elite in Germany and the United States. The conduit for financing the printing of the Manifesto was none other than Louisiana pirate Jean Laffite, who was, among his later occupations, a spy for Spain and a courier for a group of American bankers. The evidence for this twist in mode rn history has been ignored by modern historians although the documents, authenticated by Library of Congress and other sources, have been available for some 30 years. It is extraordinary that the firs t academics to report this source of financing for Marx were writing in French, not English! It was a French book by Georges Blond entitled Histoire de la Filibuste that contains the remarkable story of Karl Marx as a friend of Jean Laffite the pirate who \"financed the printing of the Ma nifesto of the Communist party.\" Where did Blond get his information? It originated in two privately printed books published in New Orleans by Stanley Clisby Arthur, Jean Laffite, the Gentleman Rover and The Journal of Jean Laffite. These books contain original documents describing meetings between Marx and Laffite and the method used to finance the Manifesto. Now of course if you look up the name Jean Laffite in the Encyclopedia Britannica, you will learn that Laffite died in 1823 and therefore could not possibly have financed Marx in 1847 and 1848. Unfortunately the Britannica is wrong, as it is on many other points. Laffite went underground about 41"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy 1820 and lived a long and exciting life as courier for American bankers and businessmen. Laffite's courier and underground work for American bankers is noted in The Journal: We employed four men as secret officers to spy and report every pertinent conversation and to make verbal reports about any new happenings. We carried out our secret missions very well. We had only two ships operating under private contract with banking interests in Philadelphia. We decided, and took our oath, never to visit saloons or travel th e same route twice, or ever go back to Louisiana, Texas or Cuba or any of the Spanish speaking countries. (4) In the same Journal under date of April 24, 1848 we find the note: My interviews were brief, but direct. I lived at the home of Mr. Louis Bertillon in Paris and sometimes hotels. I met Mr. Michel Chevreul, Mr. Louis Br aille, Mr. Augustin Thierry, Mr. Alexis de Tocqueville, Mr. Karl Marx, Mr. Frederic Engels, Mr. Daguerre and many others. (5) Then Laffite goes on to the eye-opening statement: Nobody knew the real facts about my mission in Europe. I opened an account in a bank in Paris, a credit in escrow to finance two young men, Mr. Marx and Mr. Engels to help bring about the revolution of working men of the world. They are now working at it. (6) So here we have it. Jean Laffite was the agent of American banking interests and arranged for the financing of the Manifesto. In The Journal the reader will find other prominent names, i.e., Dupont, Peabody, Lincoln and so on. 42"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Karl Marx and His Manifesto While Jean Laffite was in Brussels he wrote at length to his artist friend De Franca in St. Louis, Missouri about financing Marx.

I have had a number of conversations with Mr. Marx and Mr. Engels, but have refused to participate in the conferences with the other debaters to compose the manifest, because I do not wish to be identified with the other men. Mr. Engels is going with me to Paris so that I may prepare a schedule to finance Mr. Marx and him, for a long time in advance, to proceed with their manuscripts, and to put in texts \"Capital and Labor.\" From the beginning it seemed to me that the two young men are themselves gifted and endowed, I firmly believe, with the highest intelligence and that they merit this is justified by the statistic research in the disco very on \"La Categorie du Capital,\" Value, Price and Profit.

(6) The second source of American financing for Karl Marx came from Charles Anderson Dana, Editor of the New York Tribune owned by Horace Greeley. Both Dana and Greeley were fraternally associated with the Clinton Roosevelt we cited in Chapter Three and with his Roosevelt Manifesto for dictatoria l government. Dana hired Marx to write for the New York Tribune. This Marx did, in over 500 articles spread over ten years from 1851 to 1861. Marx's prime source of German funds came from his associate Frederic Engels, son of a wealthy Bremen cotton manufacturer and subsidy provider to Marx for many years. More surprising is the subsidy to Marx from the Prussian elite. Karl Marx married Jenny von Westphalen. Jennys brother Baron Ferdinand von Westphalen was Minister of the Interior in Prussia (overseeing the police department) while Karl was under \"investigation\" by this same Prussian department. In other words, Marx's brother-in-law was in charge of investigating subversive activities. Over the years the von Westphalen family strongly supported Marx. For 40 years the Marx's maid, Demuth, was paid by the Westphalens and in fact Demuth was personally selected for the job by Baroness Caroline von Westphalen. Two of Karl Marx's early essays were actually written in the von Westphalen estate at Kreuznach, and money from the estate was left to Marx. In brief, between the American bankers and the German aristocracy Marx was well funded fo r the Manifesto and later writings. Why would the elite fund Marx?

Lincoln from the very beginning of his Administratio n faced a heavy burden of financing the Civil War with a monetary system under private control. During the Civil War the Union government was hardpressed to raise sufficient funds to pay troops, there was a shortage of coin and the private banking system was unwilling to meet the needs of the Union Army without personal gain. Lincoln was in the Jeffersonian-Jacksonian tradition. This tradition reserved the right to issue currency to the Federal Government and argued that this right could not lawfully be transferred to a private monopol y. In 1862 Lincoln presented to Congress a bill to make United States notes full legal tender and so enable the Federal Government to print sufficient paper money to finance the Civil War. Presumably while Lincoln did not envisage the inflationary poten tial in expanding the government's spending power there is little question that his financial program was intended as a means of paying off debts and 49"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Federal Reser ve Cons piracy _____________________________ government expense without allowing the private money monopoly to profit from the public purse. Unfortunately, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury, Samuel Portland Chase, was an ally of the banking interests. During the Civil War Chase supported Lincoln's monetary policy but later presented legislation to Congress favorable to the banking interests. Similarly Senator John Sherman, responsible for Senate passage of financial legislation, added even more financial power to that already granted the money monopoly in the form of National Bank legislation. Lincoln's legal tender bill was reported on February 25, 1862. This was to issue $150 million of legal tender United States notes. At that time Secretary Chase commented: I have a greater aversion to making anything but coin a legal tender in payment of debt;...it is however at present impossible in consequence of the large expenditure entailed by the war to procure sufficient coin for disbursements: And it has therefore become indispensably necessary that we should resort to the issue of United States notes. (1) In similar manner Senator John Sherman of Ohio advocated the measure on the grounds, \"in no other way could the payment of the troops and the satisfaction of other ju st demands be so economically or so well provided for.\" However this program of a national currency was opposed by the New York banking interests and Sena tor John Sherman's advocation did not, as we shall see later, reflect his true intent. (To be repeated in 1913 by Senator Owen and Congressman Glass who misrepresented their true positions to the public on the Federal Reserve Act.) The idea of a national currency was opposed by banking interests, the money power, because it would obviously remove from bankers the privilege of issuing an effective 50"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Abraham Lincoln: Last President to Fight the Money Power substitute for money (defined in the Constitution as gold and silver). What bankers wanted the government to undertake was transfer the right to issue money to banking interests, i.e., to allow bankers to act as agents of the Federal Government. The U.S. Government would then be a perpetual borrower required to borrow funds at interest from a private money monopoly - which had obtained the monopoly power from the government itself. Given the restrictions of the Constitution, banking interests had to tread carefully. The Clinton Roosevelt (Bank of New York) proposal was to remove the Constitution, shadowed in the late 20th century by the Trilateral Commission pleas that the Constitution is outdated. Moreover the public itself, apart from Constitutional limits, would hardly agree to a private money monopoly if the truth were to be widely known. So we find from the time of Jefferson to the 1990s that any discussion of a private money monopoly is quickly and thoroughly suppressed. Nothing is more dangerous to the power of the elite than the public discovery and understanding of the private control of money supply. What the bankers wanted in the 1860s was for the government to issue interest-bearing bonds. These bonds were to be used as the basis of bank credit. While Lincoln pushed his legal tender act the bankers met to draft what became the National Bank Act of 1863. The purpose of the National Bank Act was to give control of the money issue to bankers. This monopol y could be used for profit and with the Civil War, profits would be substantial. The difference between Lincoln and the money power was essentially whether the medium of exchange (convertible bank notes and inconvertible bank credit transferred by check) was to be created and issued by 51"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Federal Reser ve Cons piracy_____________________________ private monopoly or government monopoly. In other words, whether the power of government is subordina te to a banking elite or bankers subject to the power of government which, if Congress did its job honestly, also means subordinate to the power of the people. An extraordinary letter from Se nator John Sherman to Rothschild Brothers in London dated June 25, 1863 (and leaked on Wall Street in 1863) demonstrates the double dealing of even \"prominent\" and \"well regarded\" politicians. Sherman saw a chance to curry favor with the preeminent world bankers of the time and personally brought the possibilities of the proposed National Banking Act to the attention of international bankers.

The Legal Tender Bill wanted by Lincoln was subjected to intense lobbying in Washington and so loaded with amendments as to become useless. One amendment required that interest on bonds and notes - mere pieces of paper - was to be paid twice a year in gold coin. Suffocati on by ridiculous amendments was successful.

On July 23, 1862 Lincoln vetoed the Private Bank Note Bill on grounds that it was the responsibilit y of the Federal Government to provide a circulating medium and that United States notes could equally fulfill the function of sm all private notes. This veto was Lincoln's challenge to the banking interests. Lincoln was a caustic critic of ba nkers. A delegation of New York bankers came to Washington to lobby in favor of the Legal Tender Bill. The Secretary of the Treasury intr oduced the delegation as follows: These gentlemen from New York have come to see the Secretary of the Treasury about our new loan. As bankers they are obliged to hold our national securities. I can vouch for their patriotism and loyalty, for, as the Good Book says, \"for where the treasure is, there will the heart be also.\" Lincoln replied: There is another test that I might apply, \"Wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together. \" (4) ; Lincoln's national currency scheme was in direct opposition to the international bankers who at that time planned to extend the Bank of England gold standard private money to the United States. Later in the 20th century bankers went for fiat money not backed by gold but in the mid-19th century the gold-silver system offered more opportunities for personal gain. Lincoln was proposing that instead of the Federal Government borrowing paper or created money from the bankers that the bankers borrow coin or gold from the Treasury. In this way the banking interest would be unable to create fictional wealth from the printing press. 57"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy _________________________ The National Bank Act was presented to the United States as a device to raise money to run the Civil War and achieve financial stability. Under the Act any five persons could form a bank with a capital of $50,000 or more. After deposit in the United States Treasury of intere st-bearing bonds equal to one- third of the paid-in capital, the Government would print National Bank certificates on behalf of the bank to the amount of 90 percent of the part value of the bonds printed. These National Bank certificates could then be used by the bank to carry on banking business and receive full profit on them as though they were the bank's own notes. Furthermore the bank received from the Federal Government interest payments in gold coin on bonds deposited in the Treasury. In other words the bankers had a double profit. First, interest on government guaranteed money issues and second, interest paid on bonds in gold. The National Banking Act was a guaranteed profit making machine for anyon e who wanted to get into banking. Once again the Jeffersonian-Jacksonian tradition raised its voice. It claimed that the Nati onal banking system would create an even greater centralization of the money power than the Bank of the United States - which Andrew Jackson had vetoed. This time around the money power was much more organized.

From time to time the Fed makes pronouncements and before the pronouncement they have to decide what to pronounce. They get together, they discuss, they make plans and then they issue statements.

The Federal Reserve system is a private system owned by the banks and gives only banks this advance information. The idea for the Fed was conceived on a small island in the Atlantic Ocean off Glynn County, Georgia.

It was on Jekyl Island that the money trust designed its plan for Congressional approval of a private money monopoly. American public opinion at the turn of the century was hostile to the idea of a central bank and generally opposed any further power for Wall Street interests. Yet a central bank along European lines offered vast secure profits for any financia l group that could persuade Congress to enact central bank legislation. An elastic fiat and credit system offered power not possible with gold and silver as rigid disciplines on the financial system. The clandestine Jekyl Island meeting was to design a plan to bring a central bank to the United States disguised as a regional banking system....while the bankers publicly opposed what they privately proposed. This dissimulation was so successful that, according to private secretary Joseph Tumulty, Woodrow Wilson, in signing the Federal Reserve Act actually believed he was removing financial power from Wall Street interests. President Wilson when governor of New Jersey in 1911 had declared: The greatest monopoly in this country is the money monopoly. So long as that exists, our old variety of freedom and individual energy of development are out of the question. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrat ed. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men.... This is the greatest question of all: and to this statesmen must address themselves with earnest 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Money Trust Creates The Fed determination to serve the long future and the true liberties of free men. (1) Wilson may actually have believed his own statement that the Federal Reserve System was \"the keystone of the great arch of the Democratic Administration.\" (2) What then is the reality behind this financial power known 100 years ago as the \"money trust\" or the \"money power\" and today as an elite group that can profit from a central bank? To answer this question we have to go back in history and look at the 19th century trusts and the financial tip of the trust pyramid as it existed in the first decade of the twentieth century. Between 1870 and the onset of World War One, American industry was concentrated under the control or influence of a handful of financiers, mostly in New York. John Moody, editor of the standard reference, Moody's Manual of Corporation Securities, recorded the trustification of American industry in a monumental volume of statistics and evidence. (3) Moody was a sympathetic observer and like Clarence Barron (4) another acute observer, considered trusts to be both useful and inevitable. Criticism of the industrial trusts was widespread. John Moody's The Truth About Trusts with its wealth of detail demonstrated the pervasive money powers dominating the steel, non-ferrous metals, oil, tobacco, shipping, sugar and railroad industries - specifically the power of J. P. Morgan, the Rockefelle r brothers, Edward Harriman, John McCormick, Henry Havemeyer and Thomas F. Ryan. In tracing the early history of the drive for an American central bank by the \"money power,\" two historical episodes stand out: (l) the 1907 financial panic used by the bankers and their allies to urge the necessity for a central bank (although 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Federal Reser ve Conspiracy ____________________________ the panic was precipitated by Wall Street, this was not proven until many years later.) (2) the meteoric rise of German banker Paul Warburg with his missionary zeal to promote a carbon copy of the German Reichsbank in the United States. In 1907 there were still a few cap italists willing to challenge Wall Street and dispute its iron grip on financial power. Among these outsiders was Montana copper milli onaire Frederick Augustus Heinze, who was selected as the key target for the 1907 panic. Heinze brought his copper fortune to New York and joined with C. W. Morse of the Ice Trust. Jointly they acquired control of Mercantile National Bank, using the assets of the Bank of North America already dominated by Morse. Heinze and Morse then acquired control of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, allied with the Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust. They then incorporated a speculative vehicle, the United Copper Company. It was stock market games with United Copper that precipitated the 1907 crisis. Banks und er control of the \"money trust\" called their loans to United Copper and began a run on the Heinze- Morse Mercantile National Bank. It is now generally agreed \"that the 1907 panic was precipitated by the struggle to get rid of Heinze.\" (5) In 1913 the money trust and the 1907 panic were investigated by the Pujo Committee, which recorded the enormous power of the J. P. Morgan firm. (6) During the years 1900 to 1920 the money trust was effectively controlled by the banking firm of J. P. Morgan, comprising Morgan himself until his death in 1913, then his son, J. P. Morgan, Jr. and the firm's dozen to 15 partners in association with their Rockefeller, Harriman and Kuhn Loeb allies. After an extended documented inquiry, the 1912 Pujo Committee concluded that the \"money trust\" was 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Money Trust Creates The Fed Far more dangerous than all that has happened to us in the past in the way of elimination of competition in industry, is the control of credit through the domination of these groups over banks and industries. It is impossible that there should be competition with all the facilities for raising money or selling large issues of bonds in the hands of these few bankers and their partners and allies, who together dominate the financial policies of most of the existing systems.... The acts of this inner group, as here described, have, nevertheless, been mo re destructive of competition than anything accomplished by the trusts, for they strike at the very vitals of potential competition in every industry that is under their protection, a condition which if p ermitted to continue, will render impossible all attempts to restore normal competitive conditions in the industrial world. (7) In the public debate over creation of a Federal Reserve System in the United States, the 1907 crash was repeatedly used as the reason to install a central bank in the United States. The Fed was put forward as a way to stop financial panics. However, the 1907 panic was deliberately created by the \"Standard Oil crowd\" and the Morgan firm. In other words, the same group that stood to benefit from a central bank created the panic used to persuade the electorate that a central bank was vital. How well this private monopoly has maintained its power over the intervening decades since 1913 is the conclusion of a 1976 Congressional staff report.

(8) What is important to note is that the Federal Reserve is a private system with private stockholders. The money trust of the 19th century has been granted a legal monopoly while almost all other industry is subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act. It is monopoly, and monopoly requires political power to keep in place. It is also noteworthy that writing on the Federal Reserve glosses over the private ownership, yet the very aspect of the Federal Reserve that needs to be publicly discussed is its private nature, who owns what and what advantages accrue to ownership. Where J. P. Morgan sat on the councils of New York City finance in 1907, David Rockefeller sat in the 1970s and Alan Greenspan sits today. Wall Street Journal in 1977 showed how these insiders used privileged Fed information for persona l advantage. In 1907 it was J. P. Morgan who summoned the Treasury S ecretary for an interview. In 1980 David Rockefeller summons Henry Kissinger for a meeting. How did the Money Trust pull off this coup -establishment of a central bank under their control in a country that strongly opposed the idea? Justice Brandeis desc ribes the process as follows: The development of our financial oligarchy, ...with which the history of political despotism has familiarized us - usurpation proceeding by gradual encroachment rather than by violent acts; and by \"subtle and often long concealed concentration.\" It was by processes such as these that Caesar Augustus became master of Rome. The makers of 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Money Trust Creates The Fed our Constitution had in mind like dangers to our political liberty, when they provided so caref ully for the separation of governmental powers. (10) The J. P. Morgan firm which dominated the Money Trust understood this process of \"subtle \" and \"gradual encroachment\" to perfection. The firm even publicly opposed the Federal Reserve bill which they had privately put together. The Morgan partners understood this process and were carefully chosen. In exchange for absolute loyalty they received guaranteed opportunities to make personal fortunes from the political and financial power of the monopoly. While Morgan was nominally only senior partner he held final and absolute powers within the firm. Few Morgan partners entered politi cs. Most partners preferred to work quietly behind the scenes. In the period 1900 - 1930, four partners were exceptions to this rule and by tracing their political moves we can today identify how they used duplicity to bring about objectives. These four partners were E. P. Davison, Dwight Whitney Morrow, Edward R. Stettinius and George W. Perkins. In an earlier book we described how the firm of Morgan manipulated the Bolshevik Revolution so the Morgan firm would profit whoever won in Russia. Morgan partner Davison was head of the Red Cross War Council in 1917-1919 and worked with W. Boyd Thompson, another Morgan ally who aided the Bolshevik side of the Revolution with funds. Dwight W. Morrow used his influence to get arms and diplomatic support for the Bolsheviks (we reprinted a Morrow memorandum on this in Bolshevik Revolution). Thomas Lamont used his influence in London to soften the British position against the Bolsheviks. 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Federal Reser ve Conspiracy_____________________________ Yet the Morgan firm and other partners gave help to the White Russians fighting the Bolsheviks an d was prominent in the Siberian intervention. Morrow retired from his Morgan partnership in the 1920s and after a year as Chairman of the Aircraft Board became U.S. Ambassador to Mexico (1927-1930) and a United States Senator in 1931. Stettinius supervised all war purchases for the United States in World War One - to the considerable advantage of Morgan-dominated firms. George Perkins was a founder in 1912 and then Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Progressi ve Party - a Morgan political vehicle to split the Republican Party and ease Woodrow Wilson into the White House. David Rockefeller used the same tactic with John Anderson in the 1980 election. The device used by the Morgan fi rm to control American finance and industry was the voting trust. The handful of directors, usually three in a voting trust, was selected by J. P. Morgan personally. These directors, members of the Morgan inner group, and the voting directors in turn selected directors of banks and firms. Thus the voting trust for Guaranty Trust had two Morgan partners: Thomas W. Lamont and William H. Po rter, plus George F. Baker, who was president of Morgan-controlled First National Bank. This group selected other outside Guaranty Trust directors, and Guaranty Trust in turn controlled numerous firms, les ser banks and financial institutions. This Morgan complex was, in 1912, able to dominate Wall Street banks, and so the \"Money Trust.\" Morgan control was simplicity itself, based on a pyramid of power principle. Morgan partners selected directors of major financial instituti ons, and in return for the privileges of directorship, the loyalty of these outside directors to the Morgan firm was guaranteed. In turn these financial 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Money Trust Creates The Fed institutions controlled industr ial and railroad trusts and combinations. The system worked well in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. This is how Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House saw this \"Money Trust\": I think Woodrow Wilson's remark that the \"money trust\" was the most pernicious of all trusts is eminently correct...a few individuals and their satell ites control the leading banks and trust companies in Americ a...they also control the leading corporations... (12) The Money Trust was legalized in 1913 as the Federal Reserve System, a suitably innocuous name that disguises the fact that it is a private central bank. The history of the system can be traced through three stages: the original plan created secretly in 1910, the promotion of Woodrow Wilson for President by the Money Power and then finally by what we can only describe as illegal passage of the Federal Reserve bill through the Congress. Representative Lindbergh from Minnesota, father of the world famous flier, was one of the most consistent and ardent critics of the Morgan group during his ten years in the House of Representatives. He is said to be the only man in Congress who read the entire 20 volumes of the Aldrich Monetary Commission. Such a Niagara of words poured over Congressmen raised the suspicion among reasonable pe ople that those interests responsible for it are purpos ely making it impossible for Congressmen to digest it. Of th e Aldrich Banking and Currency Plan, Lindbergh said: The Aldrich Banking and Currency Plan is a monstrous scheme to place under one co ntrol all the finances of the country, public and private.

The meeting was secret, it involved six persons and it was illegal...as we shall show later. The six conspirators were: Senator Nelson Aldrich, father-in-law of John D.

The secret Jekyl Island meeting was actually described in conspiratorial terms by one of the participants: Despite my views about the value to society of greater publicity for the affairs of corporations, there was an occasion, near the close of 1910, when I was as secretive, indeed as furtive, as any conspirator. None of us who participated felt that we were conspirators; on the contrary we felt we were engaged in a patriotic work. We were trying to plan a mechanism that would correct the weaknesses of our banking system as revealed under the strains and pressures of the panic of 1907. I do not feel it is any exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyl Island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System. (1) After the 1907 panic plans were fo rmulated to convince the public of a \"need\" for a central bank. The key at this point was Senator Nelson Aldrich, a wealthy businessman linked to the Rockefeller family through marriage of his daughter Abby to John D. Rockefeller Jr. Former Vice President Nelson Rockefeller was a direct descendent of this branch of the Rockefeller family. In the post-1907 panic era, Sena tor Aldrich headed a Senate Monetary Commission which toured Europe to discuss and study European central banks and especially the German Reichsbank system. From this junket Aldrich emerged as the Congressional expert on bank planning. Few spotted his close links with the banking interests. (2) Herbert L. Satterlee was Morgan's son-in-law and, from the inside, comments on Aldrich's close relations with the Money Trust 76"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Jekyl Island Conspiracy and planning for the Federal Reserve System. Aldrich, according to Satterlee, ...turned to Mr. Morgan for advice and then during the next two years they were to spend many hours together working out an orderly pattern for the banking world of this country from coast to coast. (3) Again, according to Satterlee, J. P. Morgan \"lent him (Aldrich) Harry Davison (Morgan partner) to he lp with details while Paul M. Warburg, the Kuhn Loeb partner, also \"put his service at Senator Aldrich's disposal.\" (4) This triad -Morgan-Aldrich-Warburg - was the focal point for planning the introduction of central banking to the United States. The remaining Jekyl Island conspirators came on the scene later. Frank Vanderlip (whom we have alr eady quoted) of National City Bank was linked to the Rockefeller family by marriage and came into the group in early 1910 after receiving a letter from Stillman, founder and chairman of National City Bank. This letter referred to a meeting between Stillman and Aldrich in Europe on the central bank question. From this letter we learn that the conspirators used a code and that Aldrich's code name was \"Zivil.\" In his book, Vanderlip states: Mr. Stillman wrote me that I should make everything else subservient to giving my whole time and thought to a thorough consideration of the subject (i.e., the currency plan) and to draft a bill for the new Congress without a Wall Street tag. (5) Above all the conspirators knew they had to maintain absolute secrecy. If any Wall Street na me ever became attached to a central banking Federal Reserve bill it would be the kiss of death. Not only were code names adopted but individuals went to great lengths to avoid public knowledge of th eir meetings and discussions. 77 "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy Without any question if the public in 1913 had known what we know today the Federal Reserve Act w ould have no possibility at all of becoming law. On the question of public suspicions of the close family links in the group, for which the group claimed disinterested impartiality, Vanderlip noted: But would the electorate have believed that? I question their ability to do so. Just to give you a faint idea: Senator Aldrich was the father-in-law of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and himself a very rich man.Once I had written to Woodrow Wilson at Princeton, inviting him to speak at a dinner. Wishing to impress him with the importance of the occasion, I had mentioned that Senator Aldrich also had been invited to speak. My friend Dr. Wilson had astonished me by replying that he could not bring himself to speak on the same platform with Senator Aldrich. He did come and make a speech, however, after I had reported that Mr. Aldrich's health would prevent him from appearing. Now then, fancy what sort of head-lines might have appeared over a story that Aldrich was conferring about new money legislation with a Morgan partner (Davison) and the president of the biggest bank (Vanderlip). (6) The National City Bank founded by Stillman is significant because one of its directors was Cleveland Dodge, the financial powerhouse and influence behind Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson, who was to sign the Federal Reserve Act into law, was a deliberate creation of the Money Power, who was approved in the spring of 1912 at a weekend meeting at Beechwood, the Vanderlip estate at Scarborough on Hudson. According to one observer, Wilson passed the test because Va nderlip and William Rockefeller discussed the 78"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Jekyl Island Conspiracy role of American capital ab road in front of Wilson. (7) This we shall describe in more detail later. The central intellectual figure in the creation of the Federal Reserve System was not an American but a German banker - Paul Moritz Warburg, a banker born in 1868 into the Hamburg Oppenheim family. Warburg's father was a part ner in the M. M. Warburg banking house founded in 1798. Warburg's early career was with Samuel Montagu & Co. in London and the Banque Russe Pour he Commerce Etranger in Paris. In 1891 Warburg went to work at the family bank in Hamburg and became a partner in 1895. In 1902 he came to the United States as a partner in Kuhn Loeb, and in spite of defective English, began a campaign for a Federal Reserve System. The plan may be found in his pamphlets, \"Defects and Needs of our Banking System since 1907\" and \"A plan for a modified central bank\" (1907). In 1910 Warburg proposed a plan for a United Reserve Bank and much of this plan was embodied in the Federal Reserve System. These were the men who met in secret on Jekyl Island to put together the initial draft of the Federal Reserve Act. The secret meeting was recorded by Frank Vanderlip: Since it would be fatal to Senator Aldrich's plan to have it known that he was calling on anybody from Wall Street to help him in preparing his report and bill, precautions were taken that would have delighted the heart of James Stillman. We were told to leave our last names behind us...that we should avoid dining together on the night of our departure to come one at a time and as unobtru- sively as possible to the railroad terminal on the New Jersey littoral of the Hudson, where Senator Aldrich's private car would be in readiness, attached to the rear end of a train for the South. 79"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy When I came to that car the blinds were down and only slender threads of amber light showed the shape of the windows. Once aboard the private car we began to observe the taboo that had been fixed on last names. We addressed each other as \"Ben,\" \"Paul,\" \"Nelson,\" and \"Abe.\" Davison and I adopted even deeper disguises, abandoning our own first names. On the theory that we were always right, he became Wilbur and I became Orville, after those two aviation pioneers, the Wright brothers. The servants and the train crew may have known the identities of one or two of us, but they did not know all, and it was the names of all printed together that would have made our mysterious journey significant in Washington, in Wall Street, even in London. Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted. If it were to be exposed publicly that our particular group had gotten together and written a banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress. (8) The last sentence says it all from th e vantage point of an insider - this was a planned conspiracy. The American public would never hand over a monopoly of the money supply to a small group. After all, the Sherman Antitrust Act had just made monopoly in restraint of trade illegal and a money monopoly was even less acceptable. To avoid public knowledge, these bankers went skulking off to a remote island in the dead of night using code names and disguises!

What this group proposed to do - and actually did do in 1913 - was replace gold and silver with a paper factory which they controlled. How this could be presented as a public-spi rited act is probably beyond most readers. We were taken by boat from th e mainland to Jekyl Island and for a week or ten days were completely secluded, without any contact by telephone or tele graph with the outside. We had disappeared from the world onto a deserted island. There were plenty of colored servants but they had no idea who Ben and Paul and Nelson were; even Vanderlip, or Davison, or Andrew, would have meant less than nothing to them. There we worked in the club-hou se - We returned to the North as secretly as we had gone South. It was agreed that Senator Aldrich would present the bill we had drafted to the Senate. It became known to the country as the Aldrich Plan. Aldrich and Andrew left us at Washington,and Warburg, Davison, Strong, and I returned to New York. Congress was about to meet; but on a Saturday we got word in New York that Senator Aldrich was ill, too ill to write an appropriate document to accompany his plan. Ben Strong and I went on to Washington and together we prepared that report. If what we had done then had been made known publicly, the effort would have been denounced as a piece of Wall Street chicanery, which it certainly was not.

He was a con- 81"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Federal Reser ve Cons piracy_____________________________ scientious, public-spirited man. He had called on the four of us who had Wall Street addresses because he knew that we had for years been studying aspects of the problem with which it was his public duty to deal. The Aldrich plan written by Va nderlip and Strong did not get through Congress. It was shot down. An ailing Senator Aldrich retired and the Money Trust was forced to look elsewhere to get its plans through Congress. National City Bank director Cleveland Dodge was a classmate (1879, Princeton) of Woodrow Wilson. McCormick of the Harvester Trust was in the same Princeton Class. By the early 1900s, Wilson, with help from Cleveland Dodge, had become President of Princeton University and Dodge let it be known that Wall Street considered Wilson \"presidential material.\" A flattered Woodrow Wilson wrote journalist George Harvey in December, 1906 to identify \"the influential men who considered him as presidential material.\" Harvey rep lied, \"naming some of the most influential bankers, utility executives and conservative journalists in the country.\" (9) Wilson, for all his public image of a teetering, owlish professor, had one lesson down by heart, that to get along, one has to go along. In March, 1907 George Harvey introduced Wilson to Thomas Fortune Ryan, member of the copper trust and a prominent financier. After this meeting, Wilson wrote a brief for the Wall Street establishment in which he provided academic support for th e Trusts -incidentally, in total contradiction to his public statements. This Wall Street cabal, with the aid of New Jersey political bosses, pushed for Woodrow Wilson to become Governor of New Jersey in November, 1910. Within a few months, Cleveland Dodge opened a bank account in New York and an office at 42 Broadway to boom 82"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Jekyl Island Conspiracy Wilson into the Presidency.

Dodge then provided funds to mail out the True American of Trenton, New Jersey to 40,000 subscribers throughout the United States, followed by a regular two pages a week of promotional material on Wilson For President. Two-thirds of Wilson's campaign funds for the presidency came from just seven individuals, all Wall Streeters and linked to the very trusts Wilson was publicly denounc ing. Wilson's election slogans promoted him as a man of peace and against trusts and monopoly. These were the very sources financing his campaign: (10) Cleveland H. Dodge $51,300 (Director: National City Bank, etc.); Henry Morgenthau (financier) $20,000 Cyrus PL McCormick (Harvester Trust) $12,500 Abram I. Elkus (Wall Street lawyer) $12,500 Frederick C. Penfield $12,000 (Philadelphia real estate) William F. McCombs $11,000 Charles R. Crane (Crane Co., Chicago) $10,000 Wilson received the nomination and wrote to \"dear Cleve\" (Dodge) to exult, \"I am so happy I can hardly think!\" (11) Wilson's acceptance speech was written on board the Corona, Dodge's yacht, while they planned strategy for the coming campaign. (12) In brief, Woodrow Wilson was in the hands of the Money Trust, had lied to the American public about his true position on the trusts and Wall Street and betrayed the Jef-fersonian-Jacksonian tradition of the Democratic Party. Wilson was elected President.

The reader may judge if they are accurate after reading this chapter: an almost hour by hour detail of the passage of the Act and signature by President Wilson. The Act transferred control of the monetary supply of the United States from Congress to a pr ivate elite. Paper fiat currency replaced gold and silver. Wall Street financiers were able now to tap an unlimited supply of fiat money at no cost. Yet, as Senator Townsend stated: \"This bill did not originate in any party platform. The people have not expressed themselves on it anywhere and at any time.\" (1) An extraordinary lobbying effort surrounded the bill just as today in the 1990s an extraordinary amount of lobbying is brought forth by any attempt to curtail or even investigate the Fed.

(2) On September 18, 1913 the Glass Bill, the house version of the Morgan central banking bill, passed th e House of Representatives by an overwhelming margin of 287 to 85. Most Congressmen had no idea what the bill was about. There were no amendments. Members voted for or against, and only the brave voted against. This Glass bill was named after Congressman Carter Glass of Virginia (1858-1946) - a banker (a director of the United Loan and Trust and the Virginia Trust Company). The Glass Bill then went to the Senate and became the Owen Bill after Senator Robert Latham Owen (1856-1947) of Oklahoma, Chairman of the Senate Finan ce Committee -and a banker (a major stockholder in the First National Bank of Muskogee). The Senate took exactly 4 1/2 hours to debate and adopt the Owen Bill, 43 to 25. The Republicans did not even see the conference report. This is normally read to the floor. No member of the Senate could have known of its contents and some Senators even stated on the floor of the Senate that they had no knowledge of the contents of the Owen Bill. At 6:02 p.m. on the same day the Bill was hurried through the Senate without discussion. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 into law. A detailed review of the Senate debate indicates the Senators had no details to discuss and every criticism went unanswered. Republican Senator Bristow (1861-1944) made bitter comments on the obvious conflict of interest: 89"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy My allegation is that this bill has been drawn in the interests of the banks; that the Senator from Oklahoma, as the chairman of the committee, is largel y interested in banks; that the profits which will accrue to those banks directly will add to his personal fortune; that he has voted to increase the dividends on the stock of the regional banks, which will be paid to the member banks, from 5 per cent to 6 per cent; that he has voted against permitting the public to hold the stock of these regional banks and has insisted that it shall be held by the member banks; and that he has voted against giving the Government the control of the regional banks and in favor of the banks controlling the regional banks, and it is for him to say whether he has violated the rule laid down in Jefferson's Manual. (3) The Senate debate, for what it was worth without a conference report, culminated in a test of political strength on Monday, December 15, 1913. At this vote the amendmen ts proposed by Senator Hitchcock - the only Democrat working against the bill - were tabled by a vote of 40 to 35. Hitchcock's amendments were aimed to make the Federal Reserve System a government rather than a private monopoly, i.e., the control of the Money Trust would be placed in the Department of the Treasury. It is interesting that the Sena te would overwhelmingly refuse to place control of the money supply within the Treasury and prefer to hand it over to the House of Morgan. Colonel House had done his work well. On rereading the lengthy rambling debate, the likelihood of price inflation was recognized. The argument was a common sense approach that without the discipline of limited gold and silver, the pressure of unlimited flat money would lead to price inflation. The only argument against was 90"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Money Trust Cons Congress a rather weak \"sound bankers would not allow price inflation.\" Note that we use the term price inflation. In 1913 the term inflation always referred to \"currenc y inflation,\" i.e., expansion of the note issue. In the intervening decades the meaning has changed entirely. Today when the term inflation is used it always refers to price inflation, i.e., an increase in prices. The key Senator warning of inflation (currency inflation) ahead was Senator Root, who oddly accused Bryan, the pro-silver populist, as the dominating influence behind the Federal Reserve Act (most unlikely, and a probable red herring). However, Root did warn of curre ncy inflation and financial panic but then defended the Glass-Owen bill on the grounds that no inflation could come about \"unless the sou nd money men who run the banks brought it about.\" Once again we have the Money power controlling the opposition, i.e., proclaiming arguments that can be easily countered while ensuring that the really potent criticisms do not see the light of day. Today the irrefutable link between currency inflation and price inflation is buried in a confusion of academic double-talk and algebraic manipulation. Today's academic economists are so beholden to mathematical manipulation (with the deluding plea of rigorousness) that they have entirely overlooked fundamental economic truisms. With very few exceptions (Hillsdale College, Ludwig von Mises Institute at Auburn University), academic economic departments are willing pawns of the modern money trust or the Federal Reserve System. (This author can speak first hand of the abysmal ignorance of the UCLA Economics Department in the early 1960s). The reply to Reed came from Sena tor Hitchcock, who pointed out that under the Bill, \"the control of the currency 91"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy system of the country would have to be turned over to the bankers.\" Others like Senator Weeks were unc oncerned on the grounds that \"the United States has the most competent bank men in the world.\" But then, Weeks was a banker himself. The last speech on this Monday afternoon came from Congressman Mann of Illinois, the Republican floor leader who made the rather odd assertion that the U. S. was in the midst of a financial and industrial panic which demanded passage of the Federal Reserve Act. Tuesday, December 16, 1913 In Tuesday's Senate debate, Senator Root again emphasized the danger of inflation from the proposed Federal Reserve Act. Constant interruptions, according to the New York Times (December 17), suggest that supporters of the bill were publicly worried. They argued in reply that inflation was not possible if the securities issued were good government securities - to which Root replied: That is neither here nor there so far as my criticism of the bill is concerned. My objection is that the bill permits a vast inflation of our currency and that inflation can be accomplished just as readily and just as certai nly by loans of the Government paper on good security as upon bad security... emphasizing the point that; no one denies that in the past from time to time great commercial nations have found themselves moving along a tide of optimism which, with the faciliti es of easy money has brought them to a point of most injurious and serious collapse. 92"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Money Trust Cons Congress Root reinforced his \"tide of optimism\" argument as follows, ...judgement becomes modified by the optimism of the hour and grows less and less effective in checking the expansion of business as the period of expansion goes on. He clinched the argument: ...instead of doing our duty as the responsible legislative branch of the Government of the United States, we are shirking that duty and throwing it upon a subordinate agency of the government. Unfortunately, Root did not push his argument to the limit, i.e., that this \"subordinate agency of government\" as he called it, was in effect going to be a private money monopoly of national bankers. The general response to warnings of inflation was to cite the existence of a gold reserve backing for the money supply: proposed at 33 1/3 percent. For example, Senator Williams of Mississippi claimed that the great inflation feared by Senator Root was only a \"bare mathematical possibility.\" Why? Because, argued Senator Williams, \"no President conceivably would appoint one member of the board who believed in fiat money.\" Eighty years later, Senator Williams to the contrary, every single member of the Federal Reserve Board and its Regional Banks is an ardent believer in fiat money and an adversary of gold! In President Wilson's era it was impossible to conceive that the role of gold could ever cease. In President Clinton's era it is impossible for policy makers to visualize that gold has any role at all. Wednesday, December 17, 1913 On Wednesday the powerful behind-the-scenes pressure for the Federal Reserve Act surfaced when the White House 93"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy announced that it expected the Sena te to pass a currency bill before Saturday, that the House would accept this Senate version of the bill without changes and the bill would then go to the President for signature on Christmas eve. The flaw with this hurry-up scenario was that on Wednesday Senator Root's warnings about price inflation had some effect and a Democratic Party caucus was called, during the short dinner recess in the evening, to consider two of Root's proposals: (a) that the note issue should be limited by law and (b) that the gold reserve should be increased to 50 percent with a heavy tax on \"depletions\" below this level. After discussion the note limitation amendment was rejected, but the caucus did adopt a proposal to increase the gold reserve to 40 percent while requiring that a portion of regional reserve bank earnings be set aside as a gold reserve. It is interesting to note that the Democratic majority was well aware of the discipline of gold and it was not the intent of Congress in 1913 in any way to reject, or even limit this discipline. In brief, the present day attempt to demonetize gold by phasing it out of the monetary system was not only rejected by the Congress of 1913 but the dangers of any such demonetization were recognized as ominous for the welfare of the United States. Even after the caucus, criticis m was to be heard from a few Senators. Senator Crawford of South Dakota didn't like the private monopoly aspects at all: ...you are simply creating a bank of big bankers, a bank to help big banks, but for which you assess the little banks to get the capital. The little banks are simply commanded to carry wood and water for the big banks. You say to the Vanderlips and the Hepburns and the Morgans and the Reynoldses, \"come in with your short term paper and get the money\" but you say to the Smiths and 94"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Money Trust Cons Congress the Browns and the Joneses from the small country districts, \"go somewhere else with your long term farmers paper; we cannot discount it.\" The intriguing aspect of the Wednesday evening is that while a majority of Congress understood more or less the idea that the system would be inflationary, they were apparently unwilling to bring themselves to vote against the bill. Thursday, December 18, 1913 By Thursday effective opposition had crumbled, and to speed passage the Senate operated under a 15-minute rule. By this device half a dozen Hitchcock amendments were disposed of and others proposed in the previous night's Democratic Party caucus given little attention. The debate records serious doubts and differences of opinion coupled with predictions that the bill would become law before Christmas and signed on Monday or Tuesday of the following week. The opposition was sidetracked. Problems were overlooked. Fundamental questions, including the possibility of inflati on, were bypassed by the leadership. One senses almost an air of panic - to pass a \"currency bill,\" at whatever cost. Consequently, although the b ill was known to be defective, the New York Times for Friday, December 19 ran its reporting under the head, \"Near end of tight on currency bill.\" The White House promptly announced that it was considering names for Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. The first name to be floated out of the White House was that of James J. Hill of the Great Northern Railroad. It was proposed by international banker Ja mes Speyer - confirming the behind- the-scenes activity of bankers. 95"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy Friday, December 19, 1913 On Friday, December 19, the Friday before Christmas when Congressional thoughts were more on Christmas trees than money trees, the Senate passed President W ilson's currency bill without further ado by an overwhelming vote of 54 to 34. Every Democrat in the Senate, plus six Republicans and one Progressive Republican, voted for the Federal Reserve system. Against the Federal Reserve were 34 Republicans. As a sop to criticism, th e bill included a so-called \"radical amendment,\" i.e. that Congressmen could not serve on Federal Reserve Boards. Bankers, not unexpectedly, were repor ted to be \"relieved\" by the passage of the bill - but not fully satisfied and still pressed for changes in committee. William A. Gaston, President of the National Shawmut Bank, spent some days in Washingt on in conference with members of the House and Senate Currency Committees and commented: \"...The prospective conference changes will make the bill more workable for the banks.-\" Edmund D. Hulbert, Vice President of Merchants Loan and Trust Company, added to this: \"...on the whole it is a sound bill and will do much toward putting banking and currency on a sound footing.\" (4) W. M.

The conference then met for four hours on Saturday evening, December 20, at which time at least 20 (some say 40) major points of difference in the two versions were uncovered, in a ddition to minor disagreements in language requiring over 100 correctio ns. In most of these minor items the Senate yielded to the House. However, none of the 20 (40) major differences were discussed in this Saturday evening conference, and it was generally agreed that Monday passage of the joint bill was extremely unlikely.

Its twofold function is: (a) to regulate the flow of credit and money for specific economic objec tives, and (b) to supervise commercial banks, i.e., mostly itself. The central policymaking body of the FRS is the Board of Governors appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Each of the 12 regional banks has its own directors. These are divided into three classes. Class A directors represent the banking system, Class B directors re present industry and Class C, the public, supposedly. In fact, Class C directors have never represented the public. It is not at all unusual for a banker to serve a term as a Class A director then go on and serve anot her term as a Class C director.

It's so powerful that no Congressman dare ask simple questions. 107"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy Of course, there is good reason why the Fed doesn't want citizens poking around asking questions. It is a moneymaking machine literally — and this is freely admitted by the U. S. Government. Here is an official statement: Where does the Federal Reserve get the money with which to create bank reserves'? It doesn't \"get\" the money, it creates it. When the Federal Reserve writes a check it is creating money. This can result in an increase in bank reserves - a demand deposit or in cash. If the customer prefers cash he can demand Federal Reserve Notes and the Federal Reserve will have the Treasury Department print them. The Federal Reserve is a total moneymaking machine. It can issue money or checks. And it never has a problem in making its checks good because it can obtain $5 and $10 bills necessary to cover its checks simp ly by asking the Treasury Department to print them. (Source: Money Facts, published by the Committee on Banking and Currency, 1964, U. S. Congress.) Back in 1913 when the Federal Reserve Act was passed, the idea of a Federal Reserve System - in effect a central bank - was promoted to the American people by both bankers and President Woodrow Wilson as an institution outside the control and influence of bankers - on the grounds that monetary policy was too important to be left in the hands of private interests. However, in fact, the institution is completely dominated, and always has been, by major New York bankers. The Fed lied! The very first meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on October 5, 1914, was held in the offices of the Bank of Manhattan, 40 Wall Street, New York. Bank of 108"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Today Manhattan later merged with Chase National to become Chase Manhattan Bank. Skipping intervening history for lack of space, we also find that in the mid-1970s, the leading Class A director of the New York Fed was none other than Chairman of the Trilateral Commission - David Rockefeller. David's term expired in 1976 and he was replaced by the chairman of Morgan Guaranty Trus t. However, David's influence was perpetuated in two ways: by appointment of Trilateral Paul Volcker as president of the New York Federa l Reserve Bank, a permanent position not subject to the necessity of re-election at periodic intervals and appointment of G. William Miller (member of the Chase Advisory Board) as Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, replacing Trilateralist Arthur Burns. Moreover, others (of the nine) Federal Reserve Bank of New York directors had links to Chase Manhattan Bank. For example, the three Class B directors were Maurice F. Granville, Chairman of the board of Texaco; William S. Sneath, Chairman of the Board of Union Carbide; and John R. Mulhearn, President of New York Telephone. Let's look briefly at the career of Paul Volcker, former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. In 30 years, Volcker has divided his time almost equally between the Federal Reserve Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank and sub-cabinet positions in Washington, D.C. - a perfect example of the so-called \"revolving door\" and the Trilateral objective of \"blurring the distinctions between public and private institutions\" for Trilateral advantage. Paul Volcker was born in 1927 in New Jersey. His first degree is from Princeton, his M. A. from Harvard and his post-graduate work from the London School of Economics -that well known home of British socialism. In 1952, stra ight from the London School of Economics, Volcker joined the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as an economist. He stayed for five years, until 1957, at which time Volcker moved 109"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Conspiracy from Liberty Street to become an economist for Chase Manhattan Bank, where he stayed for four years, until 1961. In 1961, Volcker went to the Treasury Department in Washington, thus completing the first round of his three stop \"revolving door.\" Appointed as Deputy Undersecretary for Monetary Affairs, he held that job just long enough to learn the ropes in Washington, and returned to New York, to Chase Manhattan Bank, as Vice President in charge of Planning. After three years in that post, Volcker left in 1969 to become Undersecretary for Monetary Affairs at the U. S. Treasury Department. After five years, Volcker completed the second round of his \"revolving door\" with an appointment as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Volcker is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Rockefeller Foundation and the American Friends of the London School of Economics. If Paul Volcker was a solitary phenomenon, we could make no case for Trilateral control of the Federal Reserve System. In fact, the Volcker phenomenon is one of a dozen parallel situations.

The original Federal Reserve Board represented those very interests that Woodrow Wilson assured the American public would not be represented in the Federal Rese rve System. The Chairman of the Board was William G. M'Adoo, a prominent Wall Street figure, former Secretary of the Treasury - and Woodrow Wilson's son-in-law. A key appointment was Paul M. Warburg, the German banker brains behind the Federal Reserve System. The Warburg family controlled the Manhattan Bank. Also on the Board was Charles S. Hamlin, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Another member of the original board was banker W. P. G. Harding. Franklin D. Roosevelt's uncle, Frederic A. Delano, was Vice Governor of the board - very appropriate because the \"liberal\" Roosevelts came from an old-time New York banking family. John Skelton Williams, President of the Richmond Trust Company was another member. Thus, the initial makeup of the original Board of G overnors reflected the elite and the banking interests and from that time on the Federal Reserve System has continued to reflect those interests. Trilateral Arthur M. Burns was Chairman of the Board from 1970 to 1978, a dominant voice who pretty much dictated Federal Reserve policy. According to Board member and Trilateral Andrew Brimmer, \"Arthur Burns has had a direct hand in selecting every board member.\" Trilateral dominance of the domes tic monetary system suggests we examine Trilateral world order objectives for a possible linkage. Trilateral policy makers and analysts fully realize that the world monetary system, with created money as reserve assets, is in a state of collapse.

Triangle Paper No. 1 identified two world problems: (a), how to achieve full employment without \"rapid\" inflation, and (b), how to combine \"managed\" national economies into a \"mutually beneficial world economy.\" It is vital to hold Trilateralist as sumptions in mind. Trilateralists are not looking for a solution to the world monetary problems: Trilateralists are looking for a \"solution\" consistent with, and which will promote, their own objectives. These objectives are: (a), a managed economy, i.e., managed by Trilaterals; and (b), a \"new world order\" of these managed economies. Once again we find manipulation of a problem to achieve Trilateral objectives. Almost on a daily basis we find reflections of the struggle to keep a hold on the U.S. monetary system in order to achieve a world federal reserve system. Fed Monetizes Foreign Debt In the early 1980s the Fed, through Paul Volcker, conned Congress into another vast expans ion of monetary credit through monetization of foreign debt instruments. The so-called Depository Instituti ons Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 is a total misnom er. In practice it brings all banks under Fed control whether they like it or not and gives the Fed power to vastly increase fiat money by monetizing foreign debt, much of it worthless (see attached reproduction from the Bill). Once again the Fed did everything possible to avoid publicity. Only one Congressman, Dr. Ron Paul, spotted the clause to monetize foreign debt. To avoid any publicity, the 112"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Today Chairman of the Banking Committee quick ly agreed to Paul's request to remove the clause: \"You want it removed? We'll take it out.\" Then we get a repeat of th e unconstitutional conduct surrounding the 1913 FRS Act. The House voted for the Bill without the clause - but in Conference Committee it was quietly re-inserted and became part of the Act as finally approved by both Houses. We doubt any Congressman knew what was included in the bill as finally passed - that's the influence of the Fed today. Quietly, without fanfare - and with the vast bulk of citizens unaware - the world bankers have been building an international money machine: an international Federal Reserve System with power to control the world's financial and economic system. The elements of this global money machine can be traced back to the League of Nations and the Bank of International Settlements in the 1920s. After World War Two the International Money Fund and the World Bank were instituted to globalize credit and loans. Then in the late 1950s came th e Eurodollar market, now a vast international market dealing in de posits and credits denominated in dollars outside the United States. The Eurodollar system may in the light of history come to be seen as a first step in a global dollar system. Eurodollars are dealt in by banks not resident in the U.S. and by institutions not subject to U.S. banking regulations and restrictions. Paul A. Volcker, former Fed Ch airman, has made the role of appointments to the Federal Reserve Board clear, - to support the Chairman's policy. In reference to Clinton appointment Alan Blinder, Volcker commented: I think a vice chairman has a responsibility for supporting policy in public statements.

In replying to criticism that he spoke out too much, Alan Blinder made a revealing comment: \"When we take actions, they are not reversible by any other body of government...\" New York Times, September 26, 1994. So here we have it. The Federal Reserve is a private monopoly of money credit created by Congress under highly questionable circumstances which is beholden to the Chairman of the Board and whose decisions cannot be changed by Government or anyone else.
