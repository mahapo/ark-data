Conventional wisdom dictates that anyone who attacksthe Federal Reserve System is doomed and Congressional investigation of the Fedwould result in economic chaos and a disastrous plunge in the stock market.Recently President Clinton got to appoint Alan Blinder to a seat on theseven-member Board of Governors. Blinder launched into criticism of Fed actions,i.e., interest rates are too high and differed from the policy laid down byChairman Alan Greenspan.Poor Blinder was blindsided by the establishment press and no doubt receivedadvice to keep quiet because since this initial speech, Blinder has repeatedlystated there are no differences between himself and Chairman Greenspan andrefuses to go beyond this curious mea culpa.There is a vast misconception about the Fed. The President and the Congress havevery little, if any, influence on policy. The Congress handed over all monetarypowers to the Fed in 1913. The Fed is a private bank, owned by banks, and paysdividends on its shares owned only by banks. The Fed is a private Bankers' Bank.Yet Fed policy, not Government policy, is the dominant factor in economicgrowth. The Fed can create jobs by loosening credit. The Government talks a lotabout creating jobs but in fact can only create bureaucracies which restrictrather than promote enterprise. The private sector creates productive jobs andthe private sector is heavily dependent on Fed policy to do this.The Congress has never investigated the Fed and is highly unlikely to do so. Noone sees Fed accounts; they are not audited. No balance sheets are issued. Noone, but no one, ever criticizes the Fed and survives.Why all the secrecy and caution? Simply because the Fed has a legal monopoly ofmoney granted by Congress in 1913 proceedings that were unconstitutional andfraudulent. Most of Congress had no idea of the contents of the Federal ReserveBill signed by President Woodrow Wilson who was in debt to Wall Street.The Federal Reserve has the power to create money. This money is fiction,created out of nothing. This can be money in the form of created credit throughthe discount window at which other banks borrow at the discount rate of interestor it can be notes printed by the Treasury and sold to the Fed and paid for byFed-created fundsIn brief, this private group of bankers has a money machine monopoly. Thismonopoly is uncontrolled by anyone and is guaranteed profit. Further, themonopoly doesn't have to answer questions or produce books or file annualstatements.It is an unrestricted money monopoly.This book explains how this money monopoly came about. Obviously, Congress andthe general public were misled and lied to when the Federal Reserve Bank was indiscussion. Why the monopoly has continued is that the public is lazy, and solong as their individual world is reasonably fulfilling, has no reason toquestion Fed actions.Even if they do they will find few books that surface the real facts.Academicians are too interested in protecting the Fed monopoly. An academic bookcriticizing the Fed will never find a publisher and the economist author wouldprobably find tenure denied.This is the first book that details hour by hour the events that led up topassage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 - and the many decades of work andsecret planning that private bankers had invested to obtain their moneymonopoly. The Federal Reserve Conspiracy[../images/00001.jpeg] Los Angeles Times Cartoon by Ed Gamble, 1994"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2Thomas Jeffersonand The Money Power It is fashionable in our contemporary academic world to ignore the powerfularguments of the Founding Fathers: the arguments of Presidents Thomas Jefferson,James Madison, and Andrew Jackson in particular. These arguments are that theRepublic and the Constitution are always in danger from the so- called \"moneypower,\" a group of autocrats, an elite we would call them today, who havemanipulated the political power of the state to gain a monopoly over moneyissue.Our modern academics even ignore Thomas Jefferson's chief reason for remainingin politics, i.e., to save the newly born United States from those elitistsJefferson called \"monocrats\" and \"monopolists.\" It was the banking monopoly thatJefferson considered to be the greatest danger to the survival of the Republic.The Jeffersonian ideal, one that contemporary elitists and Marxists sneer at,was a Republic comprising small property owning citizens (Marx would later callthem bourgeoisie and Nelson Rockefeller used to call them \"peasants\") with asense of civic awareness and a regard for the rights of their neighbors. Thebest government for Jefferson was the least government, where individualcitizens take it upon themselves to protect the rights of neighbors. WhileJefferson rejected socialist ideas he equally rejected the monopoly power ofbanking interests and feared what elitist banking power would do to Americanliberties. Said Jefferson:If the American people ever allow the banks to control the issuance of theircurrency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporationsthat will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property untiltheir children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers occupied.The issuing power of money should be taken from the banks and restored toCongress and the people to whom it belongs. I sincerely believe the bankinginstitutions are more dangerous to liberty than standing armies.(1) The First Private Banking MonopolyThe Founding Fathers' discussion of banks and the money power reflect the clashof political philosophies among early Americans with Alexander Hamilton on oneside and Jefferson, Madison and Franklin on the Jeffersonian side. Hamiltonrepresented the autocratic tradition prominent in Europe that figured on winningthrough a banking monopoly what could not be won politically. It was Hamiltonwho introduced a bill in December, 1790 into the House of Representatives togrant a charter for the privately owned Bank of the United States, thus creatingthe first private money monopoly in the U.S., a predecessor to the privatelyowned Federal Reserve System. And it was Alexander Hamilton who just a few yearsbefore wrote the charter for the Bank of New York, the first bank in New YorkCity. Isaac Roosevelt, great-great-grandfather Thomas Jefferson and the MoneyPower of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was its second president, from 1796- 1791.The Hamiltonian proposal for a national bank was a charter for private monopoly,a Congressional grant for a privileged few. The Bank of the U.S. had the soleright to issue currency, it was exempt from taxation, and the U.S. governmentwas ultimately responsible for its actions and debts. As described by GeorgeBancroft:Hamilton recommended a National Bank with a capital of ten or fifteen milliondollars, to be paid one-third in hard money and the other two-thirds in Europeanfunds or landed security. It was to be erected into a legal corporation forthirty years, during which no other bank, public or private, was to bepermitted. Its capital and deposits were to be exempt from taxation, and theUnited States, collectively and particularly, were to become conjointlyresponsible for all its transactions. Its sources of profit were to be the soleright of issuing a currency for the United States equal in amount to the wholecapital stock of the bank.(2)Public reaction to Congressional grant of a private banking monopoly for a groupof private citizens was caustic. Declared James Madison:In case of a universal circulation of the notes of the proposed bank, theprofits will be so great that the government ought to receive a veryconsiderable sum for granting the charter.There are other defects... and the right to establish subordinate banks oughtnot to be delegated to any set of men under Heaven.(3)In the Senate, William McClay made a strong denunciation:Jan. 17 (1790) Monday. I told them plainly that I was no advocate of the bankingsystem; that I considered them machines for promoting the profits ofunproductive Men; ...that the whole profit of the bank ought to belong to thepublic, provided it was possible to advance the whole stock on her account.But I must remark that the public was grossly imposed upon in the presentinstances. While she (Ed: the public,) advanced all specie; individuals (Ed: thebank organizers) advanced three- fourths in certificates, which were of no morevalue in the support of the bank than so much stubble. Besides, the certificateswere all under interest already, and it was highly unjust that other paper(money) should be issued on their credit which bore a premium and operated as afurther tax on the country.(4)Hamilton's proposal was referred to a Senate Committee. But this Committeeincluded Philip Schyler (Hamilton's father-in-law) and all its members sharedHamilton's political views. In brief, the Committee was stacked.President Washington then referred the bill to Thomas Jefferson (Secretary ofState) and Edmund Randolph (Attorney General). Both found it to beunconstitutional. Jefferson's opinion on the unconstitutionality of the bankincluded the following powerful argument:I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid on this ground; that \"allpowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited byit to the states, are reserved to the states, or to the people.\"To take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specifically drawn around thepowers of Congress is to take possession of a boundless field of power no longersusceptible of any definition.The Bill delivers us up bound to the National Bank, who are free to refuse allarrangements, but on their own terms, and the public not free, on such refusal,to employ any other bank.(5) The Bank of New YorkThis was not Alexander Hamilton's first proposal for a self- interested bankcharter: five years earlier, in 1784, Hamilton joined with Isaac Roosevelt andothers to create the Bank of New York.It is remarkable that academics have not emphasized the association of theRoosevelt family with the Bank of New York, the first bank founded in New YorkCity and New York State and also one of the very first banks founded in theUnited States. Only the Bank of North America and the Pennsylvania Bankorganized during the Revolutionary War preceded the Bank of New York.The initial meeting of the Bank of New York was held March 15, 1784 and thefollowing directors were present:(6) Alexander McDougal (President)William MaxwellSamuel FranklinNicholas LowRobert BowneDaniel McCormickComfort SandsIsaac RooseveltAlexander HamiltonJohn VanderbiltJoshua WaddingtonThomas RandallThomas B. StoughtonAlexander Hamilton, who as we have seen, staunchly opposed Thomas Jefferson andthe Jeffersonian democratic tradition in American politics, was connected withthe Bank of New York from the start. The constitution of the Bank of New Yorkwas in fact written by Alexander Hamilton. And as most of the newly electedofficers of the bank were not familiar with banking business it was AlexanderHamilton who provided a letter of introduction to the Bank of North Americawhich supplied the necessary information and guidance.The first president of the Bank of New York was Jeremiah Wadsworth. His tenurewas brief and in May, 1786 Isaac Roosevelt was elected president, with WilliamMaxwell as vice president. The bank offices were in the old Walton House withthe Roosevelt sugar refinery just across the street at number 159 Quinn Street.Conflict of interest is more than obvious on the part of Alexander Hamilton, whobecame Secretary of the Treasury when the Constitution of the United States wentinto effect in 1789. While Hamilton did not take a daily active part as directorof the Bank of New York, Hamilton advised its cashier William Seaton, and in1790 the bank of New York was made an agent of the United States government forthe sale of 200,000 guilders. Simultaneously Hamilton laid before Congress theidea of the Bank of the United States -a private banking monopoly.Furthermore Hamilton used his cabinet influence to prevent the Bank of theUnited States from establishing a branch in the City of New York, in competitionwith the Bank of New York.It also appears that Hamilton tried to make the Bank of New York the exclusiveagent of the United States government in New York. In January, 1791 AlexanderHamilton wrote to William Seaton as follows:I shall labor to give what has taken place a turn favorable to another union thepropriety of which is to say clearly illustrated by the present state of things.It is my wish that the Bank of New York may by all means continue to receivedeposits from the collection in the paper of the Bank of the United States andthat they may also receive payment for the Dutch bills in the same paper.(7)Later in the same letter, Hamilton writes as follows:Be confidential with me if you are pressed whatever support may be in my powershall be afforded. I consider the public interest as materially involved inaiding a valuable institution like yours to withstand the attacks of aconfederated host of frantic and I fear in too many instances unprincipledgamblers.Alexander Hamilton was also overly protective when in 1791 a rival bank wasproposed for New York City. When Hamilton heard of the project he expressedstrong disapproval in a letter to William Seaton dated January 18, 1791:I have learned with infinite pain the circumstance of a new bank having startedup in your city. Its effects cannot but be in every way pernicious. I sincerelyhope that the Bank of New York will listen to no coalition with this newlyengendered monster, a better alliance I am strongly persuaded will be broughtabout for it and the joint force of two solid institutions will without effortor violence remove the excrescence just appeared. I express myself in thesestrong terms to you confidentially not that I have any objection to myopinion in being known as to the natural tendency of the thing.(8)According to Myers' History of the Great American Fortunes(9) the Bank of NewYork \"injected itself virulently into politics and fought the spread ofdemocratic ideas with sordid but effective weapons.\" It is Myers' contentionthat the bank and its founders in the Hamiltonian tradition fully understood thedanger to their financial interests in the Jeffersonian principle.Even in 1930 the Bank of New York contained a representative of the Rooseveltinterests - W. Emlen Roosevelt was on the 1930 board as was Cleveland Dodge, thebacker of Woodrow Wilson for president (see below), and Allen Wardwell, the J.P.Morgan partner influential in the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.(10) The Second Bank of the United StatesOn March 4, 1809 James Madison, a quiet, unassuming man, entered the office ofPresident. In 1776 Madison was a member of the Virginia Convention and served onthe committee which framed the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. In 1787Madison became a member of the Virginia delegation to the PhiladelphiaConvention and made specific constitutional suggestions, assembled in theso-called 'Virginia Plan.\" In many ways Madison can be termed the \"masterbuilder of the Constitution.\" Consequently Madison's views on theconstitutionality of private banking monopolies are fundamental. The charter ofthe First Bank expired in 1811 and Congress refused to grant a new charter onthe grounds of unconstitutionality. President Madison's message repeated theargument on the unconstitutionality of the bank and made the following comment:On the whole it is considered that the proposed establishments will:(1) enjoy a monopoly of the profits of a National Bank for a period of twentyyears;(2) that the monopolized profits will be continually growing with theprogress of the national population and wealth;(3) and that the nation will, during the same period, be dependent on thenotes of the bank for the species of circulating medium whenever the preciousmetals may be wanted; and(4) at all times (will the nation be dependent on the notes of the bank) forso much thereof as may be an eligible substitute for a specie medium; and(5) that the extensive employment of the notes (bank) in the collection ofthe augmented taxes will, moreover, enable the banks greatly to extend itsprofitable issues of them (bank notes) without the expense of specie capital tosupport their circulation;It is as reasonable as it is requisite that the government, in return for theseextraordinary concessions to the bank, should have a greater security forattaining the public objects of the institution than is presented in thisBill....(11)The War of 1812 presented bank supporters with a new argument - financialdistress brought about by the war required financial relief in the form of a newnational bank.Under these pressing circumstances the House and Senate passed a bill creatingthe Second Bank of the United States. James Madison signed the bill into lawApril 10, 1816. The Money Trust Honors Woodrow WilsonFederal Reserve Notes have a curious match up of denominations with Presidents.The highest value Federal Reserve Note of $100,000 bears the portrait of WoodrowWilson, a real friend of the money trust. The next highest value of $10,000bears the portrait of Samuel Chase, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary who pushedthrough the National Bank bill for the money interest.Ben Franklin gets the $100 bill and Abe Lincoln the $5.00 bill. The only note inthe 1934 Series that bears the inscription \"payable in gold\" is the$100,000 note which is only used for transfers between the various FederalReserve regional banks.[../images/00002.jpeg] [../images/00003.jpeg] [../images/00004.jpeg] [../images/00005.jpeg] ENDNOTES TO CHAPTER TWO (1)The Writings of Jefferson, vol. 7 (Autobiography, Correspondence, Reports,Messages, Addresses and other Writings) (Committee of Congress: Washington,D.C., 1861) p. 685.(2)The History of the Constitution of the United States, (D.

A new charter for the (Second)Bank of the United States to replace the expiring grant was passed by Congressin July 1832, and President Andrew Jackson promptly vetoed the charter, with anemphatic message of major historical interest.According to modern academic opinion the Jackson veto is \"legalistic, demagogicand full of sham.\"(1) In fact, on reading the message today Andrew Jackson wasclearly prophetic in his warnings and arguments to the American people. In thefirst inaugural address in January 1832, Jackson stated his position on the bankand renewal of the charter:As the Charter of the Bank of the United States will expire in 1836, and itsstockholders will most probably apply for a renewal of their privileges; inorder to avoid the evils resulting from precipitancy in a measure involving suchimportant principles and such deep pecuniary interests, I feel that I cannot injustice to our constituents and to the parties interested too soon present it tothe deliberate consideration of the Legislature and the people.The constitutionality of this law has been well questioned... because it grantsto those who hold stock exclusive privileges of a dangerous tendency. Itsexpediency is denied by a large portion of our citizens... and it is believednone will deny that it has failed in the great end of our establishing a uniformand sound currency throughout the United States.(2)Andrew Jackson's personal view on the Second Bank of the United States iscontained in a memorandum in Jackson's own handwriting written in January,1832.(3)The opinion shows how far present constitutional interpretation has divergedfrom the intent of our founding fathers. Jackson's opening argument is that all\"sovereign power is in the people and the states,\" and then argues that incases, such as the power to grant corporations, where the power is not expresslygiven to the general (Federal) government, then \"no sovereign power notexpressly granted can be exercised, by implication.\" The key is \"implied power.\"There are no implied powers in the Constitution.Jackson goes on to argue that it may be possible for \"necessity\" to give powerto grant charters to banks and corporations, but this must be a \"positivenecessity not a fained one.\" And then only within the ten mile square ofWashington, DC itself does Congress have such sovereign power. Jackson argues asfollows:It is inconsistent with any of the powers granted that our government shouldform a corporation and become a member of it. The founders were too well awareof the corrupting influence of a great moneyed monopoly upon government tolegalize such a corrupting monster by any grant either expressed or implied inthe Constitution.The extraordinary difficulty and massive political power that Jackson faced infighting the \"money monopoly\" and its influence is shown in his letter to HughL. White, dated April 29, 1831 (Vol. 4, page 271):The great principles of democracy which we have both at heart to see restored tothe federal government cannot be accomplished unless by a united cabinet wholabor to this end. The struggles against the rechartering of the United StatesBank are to be met. The corrupting influence of the Bank upon the morals of thepeople and upon Congress are to be fearlessly met....Many who you would not have supposed have secretly enlisted in its ranks andbetween bank men nullifiers and internal improvement men it is hard to get acabinet who will unite with me heart and hand in the great task of democraticreform in the administration of our government.(4)By 1833 the struggle over the rechartering of the Bank of the United States haddegenerated into a conflict between Andrew Jackson and his secretary of thetreasury, William J. Duane and ultimately led to dismissal of Duane. Jacksonwanted to withdraw all government deposits from the private Bank of the UnitedStates while Duane refused to order removal of the deposits.In a letter dated June 26, 1833 (Vol. 5, page 111) Andrew Jackson expands on hisdemand for withdrawal of government deposits from the Bank of the United States,and proposes that one bank be selected in each of various cities to receivegovernment deposits. State banks with good credit would be preferable to theconcentration of government funds in one bank which was a private monopoly.The letter was accompanied by a paper explaining Jackson's views on possiblegovernment relations with the Bank of the United States and the future. Includedwas this straightforward statement:The framers (of our Constitution) were too well aware of the corruptinginfluences of a great moneyed monopoly upon government to legalize such acorrupting monster by any grant either express or implied in the constitution.Bank corporations are brokers on a large scale, and could it be really urgedthat the framers of the Constitution intended that our Government should becomea Government of Brokers? If so, then the profits of the National Brokers Shopmust enure to the benefit of the whole people, and not a few privileged moneyedcapitalists, to the utter rejection of the many.(5)THE OPINION RECALLED THAT IN DECEMBER 1831 CONGRESS PETITIONED FOR A RENEWAL OFTHE BANK CHARTER AND JACKSON HAD VETOED THE BILL. AS JACKSON WAS THEN ACANDIDATE FOR REELECTION THIS IN EFFECT BROUGHT THE VETO DIRECTLY BEFORE THEELECTORATE AND IN APPROVING THE PRESIDENT THE PUBLIC ALSO CONDEMNED THE BILL ASBOTH \"INEXPEDIENT AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL.\"In other words Jackson argued that his veto had already received publicapproval. Therefore, Jackson continued, \"the duty of the bank was to wind up itsconcerns in such a manner that will produce the least pressure upon the moneymarket.\"Jackson recalled the extraordinary and rapid increase of government debt to thebank which had grown by $28 million or 66 percent in a period of 16 months.Jackson commented as follows:The motive of the enormous extension of loans can no longer be doubted. It wasunquestionably to gain power in the country and force the government through theinfluence of the debtors to grant it a new charter.This must be the first and last statement from an American President declaringwhat many now suspect: that certain banks (but not all bankers) use debt as apolitical weapon for control. We cannot include all bankers because bankers inCatholic countries, for example, are forbidden on grounds of religion from usingdebt for control. This would amount to usury.Jackson goes on to outline the reasons for his wish to sever connections betweenthe bank and the government:a leading objection is that the Bank of the United States has the power and inthat event will have the disposition to crush the state banks particularly thosewhich may be selected by the government as the depositories of its funds andthus cause wide spread distress and ruin throughout the United States.Then Jackson makes an argument strange to the ears of those reading in the 20thcentury:The only currency known to the Constitution of the United States is gold andsilver. This is consequently the only currency which that instrument delegatesto Congress the power to regulate.This suggests that Andrew Jackson would have considered the present FederalReserve System, a private bank-owned monopoly, to be unconstitutional and infact \"the money monster\" in new form.President Andrew Jackson's final message on March 4, 1837 was unbelievablyprophetic in its content - and the last time an American President wassufficiently independent of the elitist powers behind the scenes to publiclywarn American citizens of the dangers to their freedoms and livelihood. Here isan extract from Jackson's final message to the American people:The distress and alarm which pervaded and agitated the whole country when theBank of the United States waged war upon the people in order to compel them tosubmit to its demands cannot yet be forgotten. The ruthless and unsparing temperwith which whole cities and communities were oppressed, individuals impoverishedand ruined, and a scene of cheerful prosperity suddenly changed into one ofgloom and despondency ought to be indelibly impressed on the memory of thepeople of the United States.If such was its power in a time of peace, what would it not have been in aseason of war, with an enemy at your doors? No nation but the freemen of theUnited States could have come out victorious from such a contest; yet, if youhad not conquered, the government would have passed from the hands of the manyto the few, and this organized money power, from its secret conclave, would havedictated the choice of your highest officials and compelled you to make peace orwar, as best suited their own wishes.(6)Even while Jackson wrote this message to the American people our government hadpassed \"from the hands of the many to the hands of the few.\" Moreover, the few\"from its secret enclave\" was already dictating political choices, boom andslump and war and peace.In the United States the Jacksonian Democrats, the Whig tradition in Americanpolitics, were the last remnant that knew and understood the power behind thescenes. Across the Atlantic in England the Cobdenites under Richard Cobden andJohn Bright tried to maintain a similar torch of individual freedom. They alsofailed.As Jackson wrote his last message, socialist manifestos were being weighed andput to paper. Not to improve the lot of the common man as they would have usbelieve, but as devices to gain political power for the elite.

PRESIDENT MARTIN VAN BURENTRIED BRIEFLY AND FAILED TO STEM THEIR POWER. ABRAHAM LINCOLN TRIED, AND ALSOFAILED. EVERY PRESIDENT SINCE LINCOLN HAS NEGLECTED EVEN TO TRY TO CURB THEPOWER OF THE ELITE.On the one hand is the \"money monopoly\" controlling the status quo and theruling establishments. On the other hand is the \"revolution of risingexpectations\" superficially created by socialist revolutionaries, but in factsocialism in theory and practice is created, supported and controlled with debtand political power created by the \"money monopoly.\"In this chapter we will look at an American socialist manifesto, the forerunnerof FDR's New Deal, written by Clinton Roosevelt in 1841. Clinton Roosevelt, oneof the lesser known Roosevelt cousins was descended from the New York bankingRoosevelts and linked by his socialist writings to the 20th century Roosevelts.Then in Chapter Five we will describe a more well-known manifesto, that of KarlMarx, also financed from the United States.The \"money monopoly\" creates and nurtures socialism. Let's start to probe thisidea with the Roosevelts, who have been both bankers and socialistssimultaneously.While one branch of the Roosevelt family developed the Bank of New York and thesugar refining industry, another branch of the family worked its way intopractical politics and even theoretical political philosophy.For example, long before Franklin Delano Roosevelt became President, James J.Roosevelt was a member of the New York State Legislature in 1835, 1839, and1840, a member of the Loco Focos and distinguished himself by opposition to Whigattempts to eliminate \"ballot stuffing.\"(1)Roosevelt was not only powerful within Tammany Hall's inner circle but accordingto one biographer, \"he was in effect liaison officer between the Hall and WallStreet, one who carried orders from the bankers to the politicians and dictatednominations and elections in a ruthless manner.\"(2)James Roosevelt was the 1840s link between the inner circles of Tammany Hall andWall Street banking including the Roosevelts' own Bank of New York. But it wasClinton Roosevelt, born in 1804, son of Elbert Cornelius Roosevelt, who provideda socialist manifesto some years before Marx plagiarized his more famousCommunist Manifesto from French Socialist Victor Considerant (see Chapter Five).Clinton Roosevelt was a 19th-century cousin to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, andincidentally also related to President Theodore Roosevelt, John Quincy Adams,and President Martin Van Buren. Clinton Roosevelt's only literary effort iscontained in a rare booklet dated 1841.(3) In essence it is a Socraticdiscussion between the author Roosevelt (i.e., the few) and a \"Producer\"presumably representing the rest of us (i.e., the many).Roosevelt proposes a totalitarian government much like Karl Marx's, where allindividuality is submerged to a collective run by an elitist aristocratic group(i.e., the few, or the vanguard in Marxist terms) who design and enact alllegislation. Roosevelt demanded abandonment of the Constitution to achieve hisgoals:P. (Producer): But I ask again: Would you at once abandon the old doctrines ofthe Constitution?A. (Author): Not by any means. Not any more than if one were in a leaky vesselhe should spring overboard to save himself from drowning. It is a ship puthastily together when we left the British flag, and it was then thought anexperiment of very doubtful issue.(4)The Rooseveltian system depended \"First, on the art and science of cooperation.This is to bring the whole to bear for our mutual advantage.\" It is thiscooperation, i.e., the ability to bring the whole to bear for the interest ofthe few, that is the encompassing theme of writings and preachings from Marx tothe present Trilateral Commission. In the Roosevelt schema each man risesthrough fixed and specified grades in the social system and is appointed to aclass of work to which he is best suited. Choice of occupation is strictlylimited. In the words of Clinton Roosevelt:Whose duty will it be to make appointments to each class?A. The Grand Marshal's.P. Who will be accountable that the men appointed are the best qualified?A. A Court of physiologists, Moral Philosophers, and Farmers and Mechanics, tobe chosen by the Grand Marshal and accountable to him.P. Would you constrain a citizen to submit to their decisions in the selectionof a calling?A. No. If any one of good character insisted, he might try until he found theoccupation most congenial to his tastes and feelings.(5)Then Roosevelt invented the Marshal of Creation, whose job it is to balanceproduction and consumption, much like a master planner:P. What is the duty of the Marshal of the Creating or Producing order?A. It is to estimate the amount of produce and manufactures necessary to producea sufficiency in each department below him. When in operation, he shall reportexcesses and deficiencies to the Grand Marshal.P. How shall he discover such excesses and deficiencies?A. The various merchants will report to him the demand and supplies in everyline of business, as will be seen hereafter.P. Under this order are agriculture, manufactures and commerce, as I perceive.What then is the duty of the Marshal of Agriculture?A. He should have under him four regions, or if not, foreign commerce must makegood the deficiency.P. What four regions?A. The temperate, the warm, the hot region and the water region.P. Why divide them thus?A. Because the products of these different regions require different systems ofcultivation, and are properly subject to different minds.(6)Seventy-five years later, in 1915, Bernard Baruch was invited by PresidentWoodrow Wilson to design a plan for a defense mobilization committee. ThisBaruch plan subsequently became the War Industries Board, which absorbed andreplaced the old General Munitions Board. The War Industries Board as a conceptwas similar to cooperative trade associations, a device long desired by WallStreet to control the unwanted rigors of competition in the marketplace, andmuch like Clinton Roosevelt's 1841 Plan. Committees of industry, big businessand small business, both represented in Washington, and both with Washingtonrepresentation back home ... this was to be the backbone of the whole structure.By March, 1918, President Wilson, acting without Congressional authority, hadendowed Baruch with more power than any other individual had been granted in thehistory of the United States. The War Industries Board, with Baruch as itschairman, became responsible for building all factories and for the supply ofall raw material, all products, and all transportation, and all its finaldecisions rested with chairman Baruch.The War Industries Board was the organizational forerunner of the 1933 NationalRecovery Administration and some of the 1918 WIB corporate elite appointed byBaruch - Hugh Johnson, for example - found administrative niches in Roosevelt'sNRA Plan. Comparison of Roosevelt's New Deal, actually written by Gerard Swopeof General Electric, with Clinton Roosevelt's early 1841 scheme shows aremarkable similarity. Clinton Roosevelt - The Science of Government(New York 1841)This is a proposal for a totalitarian government without individual rights runby an elitist establishment. Clinton Roosevelt was a cousin of Franklin DelanoRoosevelt. The book has been removed from the current Library of Congresscatalog although it was listed in the earlier 1959 edition.

Marx wanted to seizeproperty from this middle class in a revolution led by the so-called workingclass, or the proletariat. Unfortunately for Marx the working class has neverhad too much liking for communist revolution, as we saw in the Revolutions ofthe 1980s. In practice, communist revolution is led by a handful of communists.How can a revolution be made and kept in power by a small group? Only becausecommunists have always had help from the so-called ruling class - capitalistsand bankers. This aid and assistance has been consistent from financing Marx'sManifesto in 1848 down to the late 20th century when a DavidRockefeller-dominated Administration is helping Communist revolution andrevolutionaries in Central America, Angola and Mozambique.Let's start with the 1848 Manifesto. Marx wanted to seize middle class property.In the Manifesto, Marx phrased the objective like this:In the first instance, of course, this can only be effected by despoticinterference with bourgeois methods of production; that is to say by measureswhich seem economically inadequate and untenable, but have far-reaching effects,and are necessary as means for revolutionizing the whole system ofproduction.(1)To bring about this \"despotic\" seizure of middle class property, Marx laid out aten-point program of \"measures\" as follows:These measures will naturally differ from country to country. In the mostadvanced countries they will, generally speaking, take the following forms:1. Expropriation of landed property, and the use of land rents todefray State expenditure.2. A vigorously graduated income tax.3. Abolition of the right of inheritance.4. Confiscation of the property of all émigrés and rebels.5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the State, by means of anational bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.6. Centralization of the means of transport in the hands of the State.7. Increase of national factories and means of production, cultivationof uncultivated land, and improvement of cultivated land in accordance with ageneral plan.8. Universal and equal obligation to work; organization of industrialarmies, especially for agriculture.9. Agriculture and urban industry to work hand-in-hand, in such a wayas, by degrees, to obliterate the distinction between town and country.10. Public and free education of all children. Abolition of factory workfor children in its present form. Education and material production to becombined.(2)As we shall see later, Marx's ten points for destruction of the middle classhave almost been completed in the United States. The 16th Amendment, for example(the income tax) is an archaic political concept that goes back some 4,000 yearsin history to the time of the Pharaohs in Egypt.The Pharaohs and their elitist advisors had the notion that the entrepreneur,the businessmen, and the workers of Egypt who produced the wealth of thatcivilization somehow were not competent to manage that wealth.These elitist advisors and Pharaoh said, \"Look, we're going to force you peopleto do what we know you should. Because after all, were omnipotent, we arestanding up here looking down on all of you and we can decide what is best forall. Much better than each of you can individually decide for yourselves. We'regoing to force you to have a government retirement program, so that when youreach retirement age you can retire with some dignity. We're going to force youto do what we know you should do, because we know you won't do it if left toyour own devices. Also, we're going to force you to have a government foodstorage program. We're going to store grain in the government granaries becausewe know that you are not competent - you are not capable of storing food byyourselves.“Furthermore, we know you can't take care of your health so we're going to forceyou to have a government medical program. We know health is important and weknow that you don't have the responsibility or capability for looking afteryourselves. We're going to force it on you for your own best interests.”The method used to accomplish these objectives was to withhold a fifth part ofthe production of Egypt. If you go back and read the Old Testament it says,\"That the Pharaoh had decided to take up a fifth power of the production ofEgypt and to store it in granaries for the benefit of all.\"The modern day proponent of the Pharaoh's philosophy is none other than KarlMarx and the Communist Manifesto. The Manifesto has become the most significanteconomic document of the 20th Century. The significance lies in the unfortunatefact that the Manifesto is the economic guiding light of our leadership today,of the executive branch of our government and in most cases the leadership ofboth parties in this country who work to support and bring about the measures ofthe manifesto.Basically what the Manifesto states is that when you have implemented these 10programs in any free enterprise system, \"capitalism\" will have been destroyedand a communist state established in its place. This is what Marx wrote:Strictly speaking, political power is the organized use of force by one classin order to keep another class in subjection. When the proletariat, in thecourse of its fight against the bourgeoisie, necessarily consolidates itselfinto a class, by means of a revolution makes itself the ruling class, itforcibly sweeps away the old system of production.Item 2 of Marx's Manifesto reads as follows: A heavy, progressive, or graduatingincome tax\"This became the 16th Amendment of the United States Constitution, the law of theland in our country since 1913.Later on in 1913 we saw the passage of the Federal Reserve Act. Interestinglyenough the idea for that program is in Karl Marx's program in the CommunistManifesto as Item 5 and is possibly the most important point in the CommunistManifesto. Item 5 reads as follows: Centralization of Credit in the hands of thestate by means of a National Bank with state capital and exclusive monopoly.In other words Marx proposed a scheme exactly like the First Bank of the UnitedStates and the Federal Reserve Act with establishment of a fractional reservecentral banking system on the model of the earlier European central banks. Karl Marx as a PlagiaristMarx was a brilliant fellow. He was no fool. Marx knew that if he could placeunder the control of a small group of men the ability to control the supply ofmoney and credit of any nation, he could boom or bust those economies almost atwill. By having foreknowledge of economic and monetary policies, billions ofdollars of wealth could be transferred from one group to another, from thesuffering middle class to the ruling elite. To do this required propaganda andin the mid-19th century the pamphlet was an effective means of propagandizing.A most interesting feature of the brief Manifesto has been almost universallyignored by academics, i.e., that the Manifesto doesn't favor the working classat all and it certainly doesn't favor the middle class which is targeted forelimination.The Manifesto is a blueprint for elitist control. The Manifesto favors takeoverof political and economic power by an elite. And when we look at the source ofthe assistance given to Marx, it is clear that the benefits to the elite wereobvious even in the 1840s.Marx was certainly paid to write the Manifesto, as we shall see later.Furthermore, the Manifesto was plagiarized from an obscure French socialistnamed Victor Considerant, and his work, Principes du Socialisme: Manifeste de laDemocratie au Dix Neuvieme Siecle, published in 1843. The second edition ofConsiderant's work was published in Paris in 1847, a year before the Manifestoand while Marx and Engels were living in Paris.The plagiarism was spotted by an even more obscure writer, W. Tcherkesoff, andpublished in precise detail in his Pages of Socialist History (Cooper, New York,1902).Let Tcherkesoff explain Marx's plagiarism in his own words:I felt myself stupefied, indignant, even humiliated, when, about a year ago, Ihad occasion to read the work of Victor Considerant, \"Principles of Socialism:Manifesto of the Democracy of the Nineteenth Century,\" written in 1843, secondedition published in 1847. There was reason for it. In a pamphlet of 143 pages,Victor Considerant expounds with his habitual clearness all the bases ofMarxism, of this \"scientific\" Socialism that the parliamentarians desire toimpose upon the whole world. Properly speaking, the theoretical part, in whichConsiderant treats of questions of principle, does not exceed the first 50pages; the remainder is consecrated to the famous prosecution that thegovernment of Louis Philippe brought against the journal of the Fourierists,\"La Democratic pacifique,\" and which the jurors of the Seine quashed. But inthese 50 short pages the famous Fourierist, like a true master, gives us so manyprofound, clear, and brilliant generalizations, that even an infinitesimalportion of his ideas contains in entirety all the Marxian laws and theories-including the famous concentration of capital and the whole of the \"Manifestoof the Communist party.\" So that the whole theoretical part, that is chaptersone and two, which Engels himself says \"are on the whole as correct today asever,\" is simply borrowed. This \"Manifesto,\" this Bible of legal revolutionarydemocracy, is a very mediocre paraphrase of numerous passages of the \"Manifesto\"of V. Considerant. Not only have Marx and Engels found the contents of their\"Manifesto\" in the \"Manifesto\" of V. Considerant, but the form and the titles ofthe chapters have also been retained by the imitators.Paragraph two in the second chapter with V. Considerant bears the title: \"Thepresent Situation and '89; the Bourgeoisie and the Proletarians.\" \"The Bourgeoisand the Proletarians,\" is the title of the first chapter with Marx and Engels.V. Considerant examines different Socialist and revolutionary parties under thename of Democracy and his paragraphs bear the titles:Stagnant Democracy; Retrograde Democracy;The Socialist Party in the Retrograde Democracy; The titles with Marx and Engelsare:Reactionary SocialismConservative and Bourgeois SocialismCritical Utopian Socialism and CommunismWould not one think all these titles belonged to the selfsame work? Whencomparing the contents we shall see that in reality these two manifestos areidentical.(3)Line by line Tcherkesoff demonstrates Marx to be a common thief. The great Marx,the adored Marx, rates no more than a third-rate school boy!There can be no argument concerning the massive influence of Karl Marx andFrederick Engels on world history. Yet, by contrast, the secondhand nature ofMarxist ideas and arguments have always been overlooked.How about Marx's collaborator - Frederick Engels? The sloppiness of Engels' workhas been documented in the introduction to Condition of the Working Class inEngland by W. O. Henderson andW. H. Chaloner (Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1958).As far back as 1848 Bruno Hildebrand compiled a detailed criticism of Engels'book and particularly his biased interpretation of British government reports.Engels wanted to prove a case and distorted the facts to make the case. Furtherpointed out by Henderson and Chaloner, \"Engels' vivid imagination was sometimesused in lieu of facts.\" For example, on page 118 of Henderson we find:In evidence before a Parliamentary inquiry the Nottingham coroner stated thatone druggist had admitted using 13 cwt. of treacle in a year in the manufactureof Godfrey's Cordial. But in the 1887 edition of Engels this became \"usedthirteen hundredweight of laudanum in one year in the preparation of Godfrey'sCordial.\"Laudanum is of course tincture of opium and far different from treacle. Theimplication is that the children of the working class were being drugged. Marx's Financial BackersWhere did Karl Marx get his money? How did he live? On investigation we findthat funds came mainly from four sources, and each of these four sources can belinked to the ruling elite in Germany and the United States.The conduit for financing the printing of the Manifesto was none other thanLouisiana pirate Jean Laffite, who was, among his later occupations, a spy forSpain and a courier for a group of American bankers.The evidence for this twist in modern history has been ignored by modernhistorians although the documents, authenticated by Library of Congress andother sources, have been available for some 30 years.It is extraordinary that the first academics to report this source of financingfor Marx were written in French, not English! It was a French book by GeorgesBlond entitled Histoire de la Filibuste that contains the remarkable story ofKarl Marx as a friend of Jean Laffite the pirate who \"financed the printing ofthe Manifesto of the Communist party.\" Where did Blond get his information? Itoriginated in two privately printed books published in New Orleans by StanleyClisby Arthur, Jean Laffite, the Gentleman Rover and The Journal of JeanLaffite. These books contain original documents describing meetings between Marxand Laffite and the method used to finance the Manifesto.Now of course if you look up the name Jean Laffite in the EncyclopediaBritannica, you will learn that Laffite died in 1823 and therefore could notpossibly have financed Marx in 1847 and 1848. Unfortunately the Britannica iswrong, as it is on many other points. Laffite went underground about 1820 andlived a long and exciting life as courier for American bankers and businessmen.Laffite's courier and underground work for American bankers is noted in TheJournal:We employed four men as secret officers to spy and report every pertinentconversation and to make verbal reports about any new happenings. We carried outour secret missions very well. We had only two ships operating under privatecontract with banking interests in Philadelphia. We decided, and took our oath,never to visit saloons or travel the same route twice, or ever go back toLouisiana, Texas or Cuba or any of the Spanish speaking countries.(4)In the same Journal under date of April 24, 1848 we find the note:My interviews were brief, but direct. I lived at the home of Mr. Louis Bertillon in Paris and sometimes hotels. I met Mr. Michel Chevreul, Mr. LouisBraille, Mr. Augustin Thierry, Mr. Alexis de Tocqueville, Mr. Karl Marx, Mr.Frederic Engels, Mr. Daguerre and many others.(5)Then Laffite goes on to the eye-opening statement:Nobody knew the real facts about my mission in Europe. I opened an account in abank in Paris, a credit in escrow to finance two young men, Mr. Marx and Mr.Engels to help bring about the revolution of working men of the world. They arenow working at it.(6)So here we have it. Jean Laffite was the agent of American banking interests andarranged for the financing of the Manifesto. In The Journal the reader will findother prominent names, i.e., Dupont, Peabody, Lincoln and so on.While Jean Laffite was in Brussels he wrote at length to his artist friend DeFranca in St. Louis, Missouri about financing Marx. Here's the translation ofthe letter dated September 29, 1847:I am leaving Brussels for Paris, in three or four weeks I will go to Amsterdam,then enroute for America. I have had a number of conversations with Mr. Marx andMr. Engels, but have refused to participate in the conferences with the otherdebaters to compose the manifest, because I do not wish to be identified withthe other men.Mr. Engels is going with me to Paris so that I may prepare a schedule to financeMr. Marx and him, for a long time in advance, to proceed with their manuscripts,and to put in texts \"Capital and Labor.\" From the beginning it seemed to me thatthe two young men are themselves gifted and endowed, I firmly believe, with thehighest intelligence and that they merit this is justified by the statisticresearch in the discovery on \"La Categorie du Capital,\" Value, Price and Profit.They have penetrated a forgotten time in the exploitation of man by man withouthalt. From the Serf, of the Feudal Slave, and the Salaried Slave, they discoverthat exploitation is at the base of all evil. It has taken a long time toprepare \"The manifests for the workers of the world.\" A great debate took placebetween the two young men and others from Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris, and othersfrom the Swiss Republic.I am enthused in regard to the manifests and other prospects for the future, asI heartily support the two young men. I hope and I pray that the projects maybecome joined in a strong doctrine to shake the foundations of the highestdynasties and leave them to be devoured by the lower masses.Mr. Marx advises and warns me not to plunge into all America with the manifestsbecause there are others of the same kind for New York. But I hope that Jean orHarry will show the manifests to Mr. Joshua Speed, and he, in his turn, can showthem to Mr. Lincoln. I know that nothing else can confuse it, as it would havethe same chance. Its reception at Washington would be a sacred promise that thepath that I am on is in conformity with the policy at present pursued in theRepublic of Texas.Mr. Marx accepts some of my texts on the communes that I was forced to abandonsome time ago, weighing carefully rules and regulations not based on a strongfoundation, as so-called pure and simple Utopia, without preamble or body,without an apparent base to build on. I was in accord with the two young men atthis date, apropos of my Utopian dreams of the past.The sacrifice was made to preserve the great manuscript that was composed andits constitution, to endure forever with the radiance of the stars, but not forthose in power to abuse or exploit.Oh! to my dismay; I have agreed to the abuses practiced in the last part of thesame year after the Dragon was eradicated and utterly abolished. I havedescribed my second commune which I was forced to break up and abandon to theflambeau March 3, 1821, I then took the resolution to withdraw without convert.I am no longer aiding those who are opposed to my principles.I must stop. I will bring several manuscripts and the manifest. I hope thatJules and Glenn are progressing at school with Miss Wing and Miss Burgess. Iknow they have much patience as teachers. Glenn is not as strong as Jules.(6)The second source of American financing for Karl Marx came from Charles AndersonDana, Editor of the New York Tribune owned by Horace Greeley. Both Dana andGreeley were fraternally associated with the Clinton Roosevelt we cited inChapter Three and with his Roosevelt Manifesto for dictatorial government. Danahired Marx to write for the New York Tribune. This Marx did, in over 500articles spread over ten years from 1851 to 1861.Marx's prime source of German funds came from his associate Frederic Engels, sonof a wealthy Bremen cotton manufacturer and subsidy provider to Marx for manyyears.More surprising is the subsidy to Marx from the Prussian elite. Karl Marxmarried Jenny von Westphalen. Jennys brother Baron Ferdinand von Westphalen wasMinister of the Interior in Prussia (overseeing the police department) whileKarl was under \"investigation\" by this same Prussian department.In other words, Marx's brother-in-law was in charge of investigating subversiveactivities. Over the years the von Westphalen family strongly supported Marx.For 40 years the Marx's maid, Demuth, was paid by the Westphalens and in factDemuth was personally selected for the job by Baroness Caroline von Westphalen.Two of Karl Marx's early essays were actually written in the von Westphalenestate at Kreuznach, and money from the estate was left to Marx.In brief, between the American bankers and the German aristocracy Marx was wellfunded for the Manifesto and later writings. Why would the elite fund Marx? Simply because the entire Marxist philosophical battery is aimed atextermination of the middle class and the supremacy of the elite. Marxism is adevice for consolidating power by the elite. It has nothing to do with relievingthe misery of the poor or advancing mankind: it is an elitist political devicepure and simple.

Lincoln from the very beginning of his Administration faced aheavy burden of financing the Civil War with a monetary system under privatecontrol. During the Civil War the Union government was hard-pressed to raisesufficient funds to pay troops, there was a shortage of coin and the privatebanking system was unwilling to meet the needs of the Union Army withoutpersonal gain.Lincoln was in the Jeffersonian-Jacksonian tradition. This tradition reservedthe right to issue currency to the Federal Government and argued that this rightcould not lawfully be transferred to a private monopoly. In 1862 Lincolnpresented to Congress a bill to make United States notes full legal tender andso enable the Federal Government to print sufficient paper money to finance theCivil War. Presumably while Lincoln did not envisage the inflationary potentialin expanding the government's spending power there is little question that hisfinancial program was intended as a means of paying off debts and governmentexpense without allowing the private money monopoly to profit from the publicpurse.Unfortunately, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury, Samuel Portland Chase, wasan ally of the banking interests. During the Civil War Chase supported Lincoln'smonetary policy but later presented legislation to Congress favorable to thebanking interests. Similarly Senator John Sherman, responsible for Senatepassage of financial legislation, added even more financial power to thatalready granted the money monopoly in the form of National Bank legislation.Lincoln's legal tender bill was reported on February 25, 1862. This was to issue$150 million of legal tender United States notes. At that time Secretary Chasecommented:I have a greater aversion to making anything but coin a legal tender in paymentof debt; ...it is however at present impossible in consequence of the largeexpenditure entailed by the war to procure sufficient coin for disbursements:And it has therefore become indispensably necessary that we should resort to theissue of United States notes.(1)In similar manner Senator John Sherman of Ohio advocated the measure on thegrounds, \"in no other way could the payment of the troops and the satisfactionof other just demands be so economically or so well provided for.\"However this program of a national currency was opposed by the New York bankinginterests and Senator John Sherman's advocation did not, as we shall see later,reflect his true intent. (To be repeated in 1913 by Senator Owen and CongressmanGlass who misrepresented their true positions to the public on the FederalReserve Act.)The idea of a national currency was opposed by banking interests, the moneypower, because it would obviously remove from bankers the privilege of issuingan effective substitute for money (defined in the Constitution as gold andsilver). What bankers wanted the government to undertake was transfer the rightto issue money to banking interests, i.e., to allow bankers to act as agents ofthe Federal Government. The U.S. Government would then be a perpetual borrowerrequired to borrow funds at interest from a private money monopoly - which hadobtained the monopoly power from the government itself. Given the restrictionsof the Constitution, banking interests had to tread carefully.The Clinton Roosevelt (Bank of New York) proposal was to remove theConstitution, shadowed in the late 20th century by the Trilateral Commissionpleas that the Constitution is outdated.Moreover the public itself, apart from Constitutional limits, would hardly agreeto a private money monopoly if the truth were to be widely known. So we findfrom the time of Jefferson to the 1990s that any discussion of a private moneymonopoly is quickly and thoroughly suppressed. Nothing is more dangerous to thepower of the elite than the public discovery and understanding of the privatecontrol of money supply.What the bankers wanted in the 1860s was for the government to issueinterest-bearing bonds. These bonds were to be used as the basis of bank credit.While Lincoln pushed his legal tender act the bankers met to draft what becamethe National Bank Act of 1863.The purpose of the National Bank Act was to give control of the money issue tobankers. This monopoly could be used for profit and with the Civil War, profitswould be substantial.The difference between Lincoln and the money power was essentially whether themedium of exchange (convertible bank notes and nonconvertible bank credittransferred by check) was to be created and issued by private monopoly orgovernment monopoly. In other words, whether the power of government issubordinate to a banking elite or bankers subject to the power of governmentwhich, if Congress did its job honestly, also means subordinate to the power ofthe people.An extraordinary letter from Senator John Sherman to Rothschild Brothers inLondon dated June 25, 1863 (and leaked on Wall Street in 1863) demonstrates thedouble dealing of even \"prominent\" and \"well regarded\" politicians.Sherman saw a chance to curry favor with the preeminent world bankers of thetime and personally brought the possibilities of the proposed National BankingAct to the attention of international bankers. On the following pages wereproduce a letter from Rothschild Brothers (London) to Ikleheimer, Morton andVandergould (Wall Street, New York) acknowledging receipt of a Sherman letterand relaying its contents. These bankers reply to Rothschild Brothers on July 6,1863, with details of the National Banking Act and some insights into thecharacter of Senator John Sherman. London, June 25, 1863;Messrs. Ikleheimer, Morton and VandergouldNo. 3, Wall St.,New York, U.S.A.Dear Sirs:A Mr. John Sherman has written us from a town in Ohio, U.S.A., as to the profitthat may be made in the National Banking business, under a recent act of yourCongress; a copy of this act accompanies this letter.Apparently this act has been drawn up on the plan formulated here by theBritish Bankers Association, and by that Association recommended to our Americanfriends, as one that if enacted into law, would prove highly profitable to thebanking fraternity throughout the world.Mr. Sherman declares that there has never been such an opportunity forcapitalists to accumulate money as that presented by this act. It gives theNational Bank almost complete control of the National finance. \"The few whounderstand the system,\" he says, \"will either be so interested in its profits,or so dependent on its favors that there will be no opposition from that class,while on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable ofcomprehending the tremendous advantages that Capital derives from the system,will bear its burden without complaint, and perhaps without even suspecting thatthe system is inimical to their interests.... Your respectful servantsRothschild Brothers New York CityJuly 6, 1863Messrs. Rothschild Brothers,London, England.Dear Sirs:We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 25, in which you refer to acommunication received of Honorable John Sherman of Ohio, with reference to theadvantages and profits of an American investment under the provisions of theNational Banking Act.Mr. Sherman possesses in a marked degree the distinguishing characteristics of asuccessful financier. His temperament is such that whatever his feelings may bethey never cause him to lose sight of the main chance.He is young, shrewd and ambitious. He has fixed his eyes upon the Presidency ofthe United States and is already a member of Congress (he has financialambitions, too). He rightfully thinks that he has everything to gain by beingfriendly with men and institutions having large financial resources, and whichat times are not too particular in their methods, either of obtaining governmentaid, or protecting themselves against unfriendly legislation.As to the organization of the National Bank here and the nature and profits ofsuch investment we beg leave to refer to our printed circulars enclosed herein,vis:\"Any number of persons not less than five may organize a National BankingCorporation.\"Except in cities having 6000 inhabitants or less, a National Bank cannot haveless than $1,000,000 capital.\"They are private corporations organized for private gain, and select their ownofficers and employees.\"They are not subject to control of State Laws, except as Congress may from timeto time provide.\"They may receive deposits and loan the same for their own benefit. They can buyand sell bonds and discount paper and do a general banking business.\"To start a National Bank on the scale of $1,000,000 will require purchase ofthat amount (par value) of U. S. Government Bonds.\"U. S. Government Bonds can now be purchased at 50% discount, so that a bank of$1,000,000 capital can be started at this time for only $500,000.\"These bonds must be deposited in the U.S. Treasury at Washington as securityfor the National Bank currency, that will be furnished by the government to thebank.\"The United States Government will pay 6% interest on the bonds in gold, theinterest being paid semi-annually. It will be seen that at the present price ofbonds the interest paid by the government itself is 12% in gold on all moneyinvested.\"The U.S. Government on having the bonds aforesaid deposited with the Treasurer,on the strength of such security will furnish National currency to the bankdepositing the bonds, at an annual interest of only one per cent per annum.\"The currency is printed by the U.S. Government in a form so like greenbacks,that the people do not detect the difference although the currency is but apromise of the bank to pay.\"The demand for money is so great that this money can be readily loaned to thepeople across the counter of the bank at a discount at the rate of 10% at thirtyto sixty days’ time, making it about 12% interest on the currency.\"The interest on the bonds, plus the interest on the currency which the bondssecure, plus incidentals of the business, ought to make the gross earnings ofthe bank amount to from 28% to 33-1/3%.\"National Banks are privileged to increase and contract their currency at willand, of course, can grant or withhold loans as they may see fit. As the bankshave a National organization and can easily act together in withholding loans orextending them, it follows that they can by united action in refusing to makeloans cause a stringency in the money market, and in a single week or even asingle day cause a decline in all products of the country.\"National Banks pay no taxes on their bonds, nor on their capital, nor on theirdeposits.\"Requesting that you will regard this as strictly confidential.... Most respectfully yours,Ikelheimer, Morton and Vandergould (3) It was particularly important to international bankers that they succeed withLincoln. If Lincoln implemented public control of finance in the United Statesthen other nations would pluck up courage to strip financial power from theirbankers.European bankers, especially those in England, organized against Abraham Lincolnand used commercial banking channels to pressure bankers in the U.S. forsupport. The Legal Tender Bill wanted by Lincoln was subjected to intenselobbying in Washington and so loaded with amendments as to become useless. Oneamendment required that interest on bonds and notes - mere pieces of paper - wasto be paid twice a year in gold coin. Suffocation by ridiculous amendments wassuccessful. Defeat of the Legal Tender Bill was followed in 1862 by a bill toallow banks to issue private bank notes less than $5.00 within the District ofColumbia, a first step towards a privately controlled fiat money supply.On July 23, 1862 Lincoln vetoed the Private Bank Note Bill on grounds that itwas the responsibility of the Federal Government to provide a circulating mediumand that United States notes could equally fulfill the function of small privatenotes. This veto was Lincoln's challenge to the banking interests.Lincoln was a caustic critic of bankers. A delegation of New York bankers cameto Washington to lobby in favor of the Legal Tender Bill. The Secretary of theTreasury introduced the delegation as follows:These gentlemen from New York have come to see the Secretary of the Treasuryabout our new loan. As bankers they are obliged to hold our national securities.I can vouch for their patriotism and loyalty, for, as the Good Book says, \"forwhere the treasure is, there will the heart be also.\"Lincoln replied: There is another test that I might apply, \"Wherever the carcassis, there will the eagles be gathered together.\"(4);Lincoln's national currency scheme was in direct opposition to the internationalbankers who at that time planned to extend the Bank of England gold standardprivate money to the United States. Later in the 20th century bankers went forfiat money not backed by gold but in the mid-19th century the gold-silver systemoffered more opportunities for personal gain.Lincoln was proposing that instead of the Federal Government borrowing paper orcreated money from the bankers that the bankers borrow coin or gold from theTreasury. In this way the banking interest would be unable to create fictionalwealth from the printing press.The National Bank Act was presented to the United States as a device to raisemoney to run the Civil War and achieve financial stability. Under the Act anyfive persons could form a bank with a capital of $50,000 or more. After depositin the United States Treasury of interest-bearing bonds equal to one-third ofthe paid-in capital, the Government would print National Bank certificates onbehalf of the bank to the amount of 90 percent of the part value of the bondsprinted.These National Bank certificates could then be used by the bank to carry onbanking business and receive full profit on them as though they were the bank'sown notes. Furthermore the bank received from the Federal Government interestpayments in gold coin on bonds deposited in the Treasury.In other words the bankers had a double profit. First, interest on governmentguaranteed money issues and second, interest paid on bonds in gold. The NationalBanking Act was a guaranteed profit making machine for anyone who wanted to getinto banking.Once again the Jeffersonian-Jacksonian tradition raised its voice. It claimedthat the National banking system would create an even greater centralization ofthe money power than the Bank of the United States - which Andrew Jackson hadvetoed.This time around the money power was much more organized. The National BankingBill was in the Senate only three or four days and in the House only two daysbefore it was rushed through at a particularly critical time in the Civil War.The Bill was signed into law by President Lincoln on February 25, 1863.

WHAT THEY WILL BE TOMORROW,NEXT WEEK, NEXT MONTH AND NEXT YEAR.From time to time the Fed makes pronouncements and before the pronouncement theyhave to decide what to pronounce. They get together, they discuss, they makeplans and then they issue statements.The meetings are always secret, known only to the Fed Directors. However, if weknew what Chairman Alan Greenspan was going to announce on monetary and creditpolicies, what the discount rate will be, or what the prime rate will be, wecould quickly make a fortune, because that knowledge has impact on Treasury billrates, on metals markets, on the stock market and on real estate markets.The Federal Reserve System is a private system owned by the banks and gives onlybanks this advance information.The idea for the Fed was conceived on a small island in the Atlantic Ocean offGlynn County, Georgia. Back in 1910 Jekyll Island was a private club used by anelitist group of Wall Street financiers as a hideaway to discuss extra privatebusiness away from prying public ears. It was on Jekyll Island that the moneytrust designed its plan for Congressional approval of a private money monopoly.American public opinion at the turn of the century was hostile to the idea of acentral bank and generally opposed any further power for Wall Street interests.Yet a central bank along European lines offered vast secure profits for anyfinancial group that could persuade Congress to enact central bank legislation.An elastic fiat and credit system offered power not possible with gold andsilver as rigid disciplines on the financial system.The clandestine Jekyll Island meeting was to design a plan to bring a centralbank to the United States disguised as a regional banking system.... while thebankers publicly opposed what they privately proposed.This dissimulation was so successful that, according to private secretary JosephTumulty, Woodrow Wilson, in signing the Federal Reserve Act actually believed hewas removing financial power from Wall Street interests.President Wilson when governor of New Jersey in 1911 had declared:The greatest monopoly in this country is the money monopoly. So long as thatexists, our old variety of freedom and individual energy of development are outof the question.A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system ofcredit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all ouractivities are in the hands of a few men....This is the greatest question of all: and to this statesmen must addressthemselves with earnest determination to serve the long future and the trueliberties of free men.(1)Wilson may actually have believed his own statement that the Federal ReserveSystem was \"the keystone of the great arch of the Democratic Administration.\"(2)What then is the reality behind this financial power known 100 years ago as the\"money trust\" or the \"money power\" and today as an elite group that can profitfrom a central bank?To answer this question we have to go back in history and look at the 19thcentury trusts and the financial tip of the trust pyramid as it existed in thefirst decade of the twentieth century.Between 1870 and the onset of World War One, American industry was concentratedunder the control or influence of a handful of financiers, mostly in New York.John Moody, editor of the standard reference, Moody's Manual of CorporationSecurities, recorded the trustification of American industry in a monumentalvolume of statistics and evidence.(3) Moody was a sympathetic observer and likeClarence Barron(4) another acute observer, considered trusts to be both usefuland inevitable.Criticism of the industrial trusts was widespread. John Moody's The Truth AboutTrusts with its wealth of detail demonstrated the pervasive money powersdominating the steel, non-ferrous metals, oil, tobacco, shipping, sugar andrailroad industries - specifically the power of J.P. Morgan, the Rockefellerbrothers, Edward Harriman, John McCormick, Henry Havemeyer and Thomas F. Ryan.In tracing the early history of the drive for an American central bank by the\"money power,\" two historical episodes stand out:(l) the 1907 financial panic used by the bankers and their allies to urge thenecessity for a central bank (although the panic was precipitated by WallStreet, this was not proven until many years later.)(2) the meteoric rise of German banker Paul Warburg with his missionary zeal topromote a carbon copy of the German Reichsbank in the United States.In 1907 there were still a few capitalists willing to challenge Wall Street anddispute its iron grip on financial power. Among these outsiders was Montanacopper millionaire Frederick Augustus Heinze, who was selected as the key targetfor the 1907 panic. Heinze brought his copper fortune to New York and joinedwith C. W. Morse of the Ice Trust. Jointly they acquired control of MercantileNational Bank, using the assets of the Bank of North America already dominatedby Morse.Heinze and Morse then acquired control of the Knickerbocker Trust Company,allied with the Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust. They thenincorporated a speculative vehicle, the United Copper Company. It was stockmarket games with United Copper that precipitated the 1907 crisis. Banks undercontrol of the \"money trust\" called their loans to United Copper and began a runon the Heinze- Morse Mercantile National Bank. It is now generally agreed \"thatthe 1907 panic was precipitated by the struggle to get rid of Heinze.\"(5)In 1913 the money trust and the 1907 panic were investigated by the PujoCommittee, which recorded the enormous power of the J.P. Morgan firm.(6)During the years 1900 to 1920 the money trust was effectively controlled by thebanking firm of J.P. Morgan, comprising Morgan himself until his death in 1913,then his son, J.P. Morgan, Jr. and the firm's dozen to 15 partners inassociation with their Rockefeller, Harriman and Kuhn Loeb allies. After anextended documented inquiry, the 1912 Pujo Committee concluded that the \"moneytrust\" was;Far more dangerous than all that has happened to us in the past in the way ofelimination of competition in industry, is the control of credit through thedomination of these groups over banks and industries.It is impossible that there should be competition with all the facilities forraising money or selling large issues of bonds in the hands of these few bankersand their partners and allies, who together dominate the financial policies ofmost of the existing systems....The acts of this inner group, as here described, have, nevertheless, been moredestructive of competition than anything accomplished by the trusts, for theystrike at the very vitals of potential competition in every industry that isunder their protection, a condition which if permitted to continue, will renderimpossible all attempts to restore normal competitive conditions in theindustrial world.(7)In the public debate over creation of a Federal Reserve System in the UnitedStates, the 1907 crash was repeatedly used as the reason to install a centralbank in the United States. The Fed was put forward as a way to stop financialpanics. However, the 1907 panic was deliberately created by the \"Standard Oilcrowd\" and the Morgan firm.In other words, the same group that stood to benefit from a central bank createdthe panic used to persuade the electorate that a central bank was vital.How well this private monopoly has maintained its power over the interveningdecades since 1913 is the conclusion of a 1976 Congressional staff report. Afteridentifying the closed shop directors of the Federal Reserve System in themid-1970s this Congressional investigation concludes:In summary the Federal Reserve directors are apparently representative of asmall elite group which dominates much of the economic life of this nation.(8)What is important to note is that the Federal Reserve is a private system withprivate stockholders. The money trust of the 19th century has been granted alegal monopoly while almost all other industry is subject to the ShermanAntitrust Act. It is monopoly, and monopoly requires political power to keep inplace. It is also noteworthy that writing on the Federal Reserve glosses overthe private ownership, yet the very aspect of the Federal Reserve that needs tobe publicly discussed is its private nature, who owns what and what advantagesaccrue to ownership.Where J. P. Morgan sat on the councils of New York City finance in 1907, DavidRockefeller sat in the 1970s and Alan Greenspan sits today. Wall Street Journalin 1977 showed how these insiders used privileged Fed information for personaladvantage. In 1907 it was J. P. Morgan who summoned the Treasury Secretary foran interview. In 1980 David Rockefeller summons Henry Kissinger for a meeting.How did the Money Trust pull off this coup -establishment of a central bankunder their control in a country that strongly opposed the idea? JusticeBrandeis describes the process as follows:The development of our financial oligarchy, ...with which the history ofpolitical despotism has familiarized us - usurpation proceeding by gradualencroachment rather than by violent acts; and by \"subtle and often longconcealed concentration.\"It was by processes such as these that Caesar Augustus became master of Rome.The makers of our Constitution had in mind like dangers to our politicalliberty, when they provided so carefully for the separation of governmentalpowers.(10)The J. P. Morgan firm which dominated the Money Trust understood this process of\"subtle\" and \"gradual encroachment\" to perfection. The firm even publiclyopposed the Federal Reserve bill which they had privately put together.The Morgan partners understood this process and were carefully chosen. Inexchange for absolute loyalty they received guaranteed opportunities to makepersonal fortunes from the political and financial power of the monopoly. WhileMorgan was nominally only senior partner he held final and absolute powerswithin the firm.Few Morgan partners entered politics. Most partners preferred to work quietlybehind the scenes. In the period 1900 - 1930, four partners were exceptions tothis rule and by tracing their political moves we can today identify how theyused duplicity to bring about objectives.These four partners were E. P. Davison, Dwight Whitney Morrow, Edward R.Stettinius and George W. Perkins. In an earlier book we described how the firmof Morgan manipulated the Bolshevik Revolution so the Morgan firm would profitwhoever won in Russia.Morgan partner Davison was head of the Red Cross War Council in 1917-1919 andworked with W. Boyd Thompson, another Morgan ally who aided the Bolshevik sideof the Revolution with funds. DwightW. Morrow used his influence to get arms and diplomatic support for theBolsheviks (we reprinted a Morrow memorandum on this in Bolshevik Revolution).Thomas Lamont used his influence in London to soften the British positionagainst the Bolsheviks.Yet the Morgan firm and other partners gave help to the White Russians fightingthe Bolsheviks and was prominent in the Siberian intervention.Morrow retired from his Morgan partnership in the 1920s and after a year asChairman of the Aircraft Board became U.S. Ambassador to Mexico (1927-1930) anda United States Senator in 1931. Stettinius supervised all war purchases for theUnited States in World War One - to the considerable advantage ofMorgan-dominated firms.George Perkins was a founder in 1912 and then Chairman of the ExecutiveCommittee of the Progressive Party - a Morgan political vehicle to split theRepublican Party and ease Woodrow Wilson into the White House. David Rockefellerused the same tactic with John Anderson in the 1980 election.The device used by the Morgan firm to control American finance and industry wasthe voting trust. The handful of directors, usually three in a voting trust, wasselected by J. P. Morgan personally. These directors, members of the Morganinner group, and the voting directors in turn selected directors of banks andfirms.Thus the voting trust for Guaranty Trust had two Morgan partners: Thomas W.Lamont and William H. Porter, plus George F. Baker, who was president ofMorgan-controlled First National Bank. This group selected other outsideGuaranty Trust directors, and Guaranty Trust in turn controlled numerous firms,lesser banks and financial institutions.This Morgan complex was, in 1912, able to dominate Wall Street banks, and so the\"Money Trust.\" Morgan control was simplicity itself, based on a pyramid of powerprinciple. Morgan partners selected directors of major financial institutions,and in return for the privileges of directorship, the loyalty of these outsidedirectors to the Morgan firm was guaranteed. In turn these financialinstitutions controlled industrial and railroad trusts and combinations. Thesystem worked well in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. This ishow Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House saw this \"Money Trust\":I think Woodrow Wilson's remark that the \"money trust\" was the most perniciousof all trusts is eminently correct... a few individuals and their satellitescontrol the leading banks and trust companies in America... they also controlthe leading corporations...(12)The Money Trust was legalized in 1913 as the Federal Reserve System, a suitablyinnocuous name that disguises the fact that it is a private central bank.The history of the system can be traced through three stages: the original plancreated secretly in 1910, the promotion of Woodrow Wilson for President by theMoney Power and then finally by what we can only describe as illegal passage ofthe Federal Reserve bill through the Congress.Representative Lindbergh from Minnesota, father of the world famous flier, wasone of the most consistent and ardent critics of the Morgan group during his tenyears in the House of Representatives. He is said to be the only man in Congresswho read the entire 20 volumes of the Aldrich Monetary Commission. Such aNiagara of words poured over Congressmen raised the suspicion among reasonablepeople that those interests responsible for it are purposely making itimpossible for Congressmen to digest it. Of the Aldrich Banking and CurrencyPlan, Lindbergh said:The Aldrich Banking and Currency Plan is a monstrous scheme to place under onecontrol all the finances of the country, public and private. It would create onegreat central association with fifteen branches to encompass all the states....It would admit of no membership except banks and trust companies, andexclude the smaller ones of these. The rest of the world would not only beexcluded from holding stock, but by the nature of the association, powers andrelations of finances to commerce, it would dictate the terms on which businessshould be done. With that power centered in the great city banks and these bankscontrolled by the trusts and money powers, the politics as well as the businessof the country would be under its dictation.(13) Chart 7 – 1;STAGE ONE: THE ORIGINAL PLAN FOR AFEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM[../images/00007.jpeg] Endnotes to Chapter Seven(1) Louis D.

The Federal ReserveSystem originated in a conspiracy. A \"conspiracy\" is defined legally as a secretmeeting for an illegal purpose. The meeting was secret, it involved six personsand it was illegal...as we shall show later.The six conspirators were:Senator Nelson Aldrich, father-in-law of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.German banker Paul Warburg, of the German bankers MM Warburg of Hamburg and KuhnLoeb in the United States;Henry P. Davison, partner in J. P. Morgan and Chairman of Bankers Trust Company;Benjamin Strong, Vice President of Bankers Trust; Frank Vanderlip, Chairman ofNational City Bank; Charles D. Norton, President of First National Bank.The last three banks were in the Morgan group; Warburg represented Kuhn-Loeb andAldrich represented Rockefeller interests and the \"Standard Oil crowd.\" TheHarriman interest in Guaranty Trust had been absorbed into the Morgan groupafter the death of Harriman.These six dominated wealth and financial power and had considerable politicalinfluence.The secret Jekyll Island meeting was actually described in conspiratorial termsby one of the participants:Despite my views about the value to society of greater publicity for the affairsof corporations, there was an occasion, near the close of 1910, when I was assecretive, indeed as furtive, as any conspirator. None of us who participatedfelt that we were conspirators; on the contrary we felt we were engaged in apatriotic work. We were trying to plan a mechanism that would correct theweaknesses of our banking system as revealed under the strains and pressures ofthe panic of 1907. I do not feel it is any exaggeration to speak of our secretexpedition to Jekyll Island as the occasion of the actual conception of whateventually became the Federal Reserve System.(1)After the 1907 panic plans were formulated to convince the public of a \"need\"for a central bank. The key at this point was Senator Nelson Aldrich, a wealthybusinessman linked to the Rockefeller family through marriage of his daughterAbby to John D. Rockefeller Jr. Former Vice President Nelson Rockefeller was adirect descendent of this branch of the Rockefeller family.In the post-1907 panic era, Senator Aldrich headed a Senate Monetary Commissionwhich toured Europe to discuss and study European central banks and especiallythe German Reichsbank system. From this junket Aldrich emerged as theCongressional expert on bank planning. Few spotted his close links with thebanking interests.(2) Herbert L. Satterlee was Morgan's son-in-law and, from theinside, comments on Aldrich's close relations with the Money Trust and planning for the Federal Reserve System. Aldrich, according to Satterlee,...turned to Mr. Morgan for advice and then during the next two years they wereto spend many hours together working out an orderly pattern for the bankingworld of this country from coast to coast.(3)Again, according to Satterlee, J. P. Morgan \"lent him (Aldrich) Harry Davison(Morgan partner) to help with details while Paul M. Warburg, the Kuhn Loebpartner, also \"put his service at Senator Aldrich's disposal.\"(4) This triadMorgan-Aldrich-Warburg - was the focal point for planning the introduction ofcentral banking to the United States.The remaining Jekyll Island conspirators came on the scene later. FrankVanderlip (whom we have already quoted) of National City Bank was linked to theRockefeller family by marriage and came into the group in early 1910 afterreceiving a letter from Stillman, founder and chairman of National City Bank.This letter referred to a meeting between Stillman and Aldrich in Europe on thecentral bank question. From this letter we learn that the conspirators used acode and that Aldrich's code name was \"Zivil.\" In his book, Vanderlip states:Mr. Stillman wrote me that I should make everything else subservient to givingmy whole time and thought to a thorough consideration of the subject (i.e., thecurrency plan) and to draft a bill for the new Congress without a Wall Streettag.(5)Above all the conspirators knew they had to maintain absolute secrecy. If anyWall Street name ever became attached to a central banking Federal Reserve billit would be the kiss of death. Not only were code names adopted but individualswent to great lengths to avoid public knowledge of their meetings anddiscussions.Without any question if the public in 1913 had known what we know today theFederal Reserve Act would have no possibility at all of becoming law. On thequestion of public suspicions of the close family links in the group, for whichthe group claimed disinterested impartiality, Vanderlip noted:But would the electorate have believed that? I question their ability to do so.Just to give you a faint idea: Senator Aldrich was the father-in-law of John D.Rockefeller, Jr., and himself a very rich man. Once I had written to WoodrowWilson at Princeton, inviting him to speak at a dinner. Wishing to impress himwith the importance of the occasion, I had mentioned that Senator Aldrich alsohad been invited to speak. My friend Dr. Wilson had astonished me by replyingthat he could not bring himself to speak on the same platform with SenatorAldrich. He did come and make a speech, however, after I had reported that Mr.Aldrich's health would prevent him from appearing. Now then, fancy what sort ofhead-lines might have appeared over a story that Aldrich was conferring aboutnew money legislation with a Morgan partner (Davison) and the president of thebiggest bank (Vanderlip).(6)The National City Bank founded by Stillman is significant because one of itsdirectors was Cleveland Dodge, the financial powerhouse and influence behindWoodrow Wilson.Woodrow Wilson, who was to sign the Federal Reserve Act into law, was adeliberate creation of the Money Power, who was approved in the spring of 1912at a weekend meeting at Beechwood, the Vanderlip estate at Scarborough onHudson. According to one observer, Wilson passed the test because Vanderlip andWilliam Rockefeller discussed the role of American capital abroad in front ofWilson.(7) This we shall describe in more detail later.The central intellectual figure in the creation of the Federal Reserve Systemwas not an American but a German banker - Paul Moritz Warburg, a banker born in1868 into the Hamburg Oppenheim family. Warburg's father was a partner in the M.M. Warburg banking house founded in 1798. Warburg's early career was with SamuelMontagu & Co. in London and the Banque Russe Pour he Commerce Etranger in Paris.In 1891 Warburg went to work at the family bank in Hamburg and became a partnerin 1895. In 1902 he came to the United States as a partner in Kuhn Loeb, and inspite of defective English, began a campaign for a Federal Reserve System. Theplan may be found in his pamphlets, \"Defects and Needs of our Banking Systemsince 1907\" and \"A plan for a modified central bank\" (1907). In 1910 Warburgproposed a plan for a United Reserve Bank and much of this plan was embodied inthe Federal Reserve System.These were the men who met in secret on Jekyll Island to put together theinitial draft of the Federal Reserve Act.The secret meeting was recorded by Frank Vanderlip:Since it would be fatal to Senator Aldrich's plan to have it known that he wascalling on anybody from Wall Street to help him in preparing his report andbill, precautions were taken that would have delighted the heart of JamesStillman. We were told to leave our last names behind us ...that we should avoiddining together on the night of our departure to come one at a time and asunobtrusively as possible to the railroad terminal on the New Jersey littoral ofthe Hudson, where Senator Aldrich's private car would be in readiness, attachedto the rear end of a train for the South.When I came to that car the blinds were down and only slender threads of amberlight showed the shape of the windows. Once aboard the private car we began toobserve the taboo that had been fixed on last names. We addressed each other as\"Ben,\" \"Paul,\" \"Nelson,\" and \"Abe.\" Davison and I adopted even deeper disguises,abandoning our own first names. On the theory that we were always right, hebecame Wilbur and I became Orville, after those two aviation pioneers, theWright brothers.The servants and the train crew may have known the identities of one or two ofus, but they did not know all, and it was the names of all printed together thatwould have made our mysterious journey significant in Washington, in WallStreet, even in London. Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else allour time and effort would be wasted. If it were to be exposed publicly that ourparticular group had gotten together and written a banking bill, that bill wouldhave no chance whatever of passage by Congress.(8)The last sentence says it all from the vantage point of an insider - this was aplanned conspiracy. The American public would never hand over a monopoly of themoney supply to a small group. After all, the Sherman Antitrust Act had justmade monopoly in restraint of trade illegal and a money monopoly was even lessacceptable.To avoid public knowledge, these bankers went skulking off to a remote island inthe dead of night using code names and disguises!Vanderlip goes on to describe the secret meeting itself and that Vanderlip andStrong actually wrote the so-called Aldrich report and the bill presented to theSenate. What is interesting is the utter assurance on the part of Vanderlip thatthe bankers were acting in the interests of the country as a whole rather thanin their own selfish interests.What this group proposed to do - and actually did do in 1913 - was replace goldand silver with a paper factory which they controlled. How this could bepresented as a public-spirited act is probably beyond most readers.We were taken by boat from the mainland to Jekyll Island and for a week or tendays were completely secluded, without any contact by telephone or telegraphwith the outside. We had disappeared from the world onto a deserted island.There were plenty of colored servants but they had no idea who Ben and Paul andNelson were; even Vanderlip, or Davison, or Andrew, would have meant less thannothing to them.There we worked in the club-house - We returned to the North as secretly as wehad gone South. It was agreed that Senator Aldrich would present the bill we haddrafted to the Senate. It became known to the country as the Aldrich Plan.Aldrich and Andrew left us at Washington, and Warburg, Davison, Strong, and Ireturned to New York.Congress was about to meet; but on a Saturday we got word in New York thatSenator Aldrich was ill, too ill to write an appropriate document to accompanyhis plan. Ben Strong and I went on to Washington and together we prepared thatreport. If what we had done then had been made known publicly, the effort wouldhave been denounced as a piece of Wall Street chicanery, which it certainly wasnot. Aldrich never was a man to be a mere servant of the so-calledmoney-interests. He was a conscientious, public-spirited man. He had called onthe four of us who had Wall Street addresses because he knew that we had foryears been studying aspects of the problem with which it was his public duty todeal.The Aldrich plan written by Vanderlip and Strong did not get through Congress.It was shot down. An ailing Senator Aldrich retired and the Money Trust wasforced to look elsewhere to get its plans through Congress.National City Bank director Cleveland Dodge was a classmate (1879, Princeton) ofWoodrow Wilson. McCormick of the Harvester Trust was in the same PrincetonClass. By the early 1900s, Wilson, with help from Cleveland Dodge, had becomePresident of Princeton University and Dodge let it be known that Wall Streetconsidered Wilson \"presidential material.\"A flattered Woodrow Wilson wrote journalist George Harvey in December, 1906 toidentify \"the influential men who considered him as presidential material.\"Harvey replied, \"naming some of the most influential bankers, utility executivesand conservative journalists in the country.\"(9)Wilson, for all his public image of a teetering, owlish professor, had onelesson down by heart, that to get along, one has to go along. In March, 1907George Harvey introduced Wilson to Thomas Fortune Ryan, member of the coppertrust and a prominent financier. After this meeting, Wilson wrote a brief forthe Wall Street establishment in which he provided academic support for theTrusts -incidentally, in total contradiction to his public statements.This Wall Street cabal, with the aid of New Jersey political bosses, pushed forWoodrow Wilson to become Governor of New Jersey in November, 1910.Within a few months, Cleveland Dodge opened a bank account in New York and anoffice at 42 Broadway to boomWilson into the Presidency. The campaign bank account was opened with a checkfor $1,000 from Cleveland Dodge. Dodge then provided funds to mail out the TrueAmerican of Trenton, New Jersey to 40,000 subscribers throughout the UnitedStates, followed by a regular two pages a week of promotional material on WilsonFor President.Two-thirds of Wilson's campaign funds for the presidency came from just sevenindividuals, all Wall Streeters and linked to the very trusts Wilson waspublicly denouncing. Wilson's election slogans promoted him as a man of peaceand against trusts These were the very sources financing his campaign: (10) Cleveland H. Dodge$51,300(Director: National City Bank, etc.);Henry Morgenthau (financier)$20,000Cyrus PL McCormick (Harvester Trust)$12,500Abram I. Elkus (Wall Street lawyer)$12,500Frederick C. Penfield$12,000(Philadelphia real estate)William F. McCombs$11,000Charles R. Crane (Crane Co., Chicago)$10,000 Wilson received the nomination and wrote to \"dear Cleve\" (Dodge) to exult, \"I amso happy I can hardly think!\"(11) Wilson's acceptance speech was written onboard the Corona, Dodge's yacht, while they planned strategy for the comingcampaign.(12)In brief, Woodrow Wilson was in the hands of the Money Trust, had lied to theAmerican public about his true position on the trusts and Wall Street andbetrayed the Jeffersonian-Jacksonian tradition of the Democratic Party.Wilson was elected President. And the ballots had hardly been counted when WallStreet bustled about to arrange \"currency reform.\" By early December, 1912,Colonel House had already talked with key members of Congress to get them behindWilson, and when Paul Warburg telephoned House on December 12, 1912, the Coloneltold him that the plan was ready. Added House in his memoirs: \"I knew thePresident-elect thought straight concerning the issue.\"(13)In March, Frank Vanderlip talked with House, and two weeks later a group ofbankers arrived at the White House with a printed \"currency reform\" bill forWilson to present to Congress. House suggested that it would not be wise toflaunt the power of the House of Morgan with a pre-printed reform bill - so theFederal Reserve Act was taken back to Wall Street and a typewritten copy madefrom the printed plan.(14) It now only remained to get the Federal Reserve Billthrough Congress.

These areharsh words. The reader may judge if they are accurate after reading thischapter: an almost hour by hour detail of the passage of the Act and signatureby President Wilson.The Act transferred control of the monetary supply of the United States fromCongress to a private elite. Paper fiat currency replaced gold and silver. WallStreet financiers were able now to tap an unlimited supply of fiat money at nocost.Yet, as Senator Townsend stated: \"This bill did not originate in any partyplatform. The people have not expressed themselves on it anywhere and at anytime.\"(1) An extraordinary lobbying effort surrounded the bill just as today inthe 1990s an extraordinary amount of lobbying is brought forth by any attempt tocurtail or even investigate the Fed. In 1913 the Democratic Party leadershipcame under strong pressure from Woodrow Wilson and New York banking lobbyists toensure that opposition did not water down the currency bill and allow otherprivate interests to become stockholders.Witness the complaint of Senator Gilbert Minell Hitchcock, an independent-mindedgentleman from Nebraska and publisher of the Omaha World Herald. The Bill hadcome to the Senate from the House:Mr. HITCHCOCK: \"Sacred document\" as it came from the House, of which, as I havesaid, we were forbidden to dot an \"i\" or to cross a \"t.\"Mr. OWEN: By whom?Mr. HITCHCOCK: And which we were commanded to pass without a hearing and withoutmuch investigation.Mr. POMERENE: Mr. President, I have been around these hallowed precincts forsome time, and I have not heard that anybody has forbidden anybody else tochange his views or to criticize any bill that came from the House, or any billthat originated here. Anyone has a right to change his view. The Senator himselfhas changed his view a number of times. I say that not to his discredit, butsimply for the purpose of showing that he has been a free moral agent all theseweeks.Mr. HITCHCOCK: Mr. President...Mr. OWEN: The Senator from Nebraska did not tell us by whom he had been orderednot to dot an \"i\" nor cross a \"t,\" and I would be glad if the Senator woulddisclose that valuable information, unless it is confidential with the Senator.Mr. HITCHCOCK: I think I will leave that for the country to judge. I will takemy chances on it.Mr. OWEN: If the Senator is content to leave that as an insinuation, it is forthe Senator to do so.Mr. HITCHCOCK: I will take that liberty.(2)On September 18, 1913 the Glass Bill, the house version of the Morgan centralbanking bill, passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming margin of287 to 85. Most Congressmen had no idea what the bill was about. There were noamendments. Members voted for or against, and only the brave voted against. ThisGlass bill was named after Congressman Carter Glass of Virginia (1858-1946) - abanker (a director of the United Loan and Trust and the Virginia Trust Company).The Glass Bill then went to the Senate and became the Owen Bill after SenatorRobert Latham Owen (1856-1947) of Oklahoma, Chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee -and a banker (a major stockholder in the First National Bank ofMuskogee).The Senate took exactly 4 1/2 hours to debate and adopt the Owen Bill, 43 to 25.The Republicans did not even see the conference report. This is normally read tothe floor. No member of the Senate could have known of its contents and someSenators even stated on the floor of the Senate that they had no knowledge ofthe contents of the Owen Bill.At 6:02 p.m. on the same day the Bill was hurried through the Senate withoutdiscussion. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 intolaw.A detailed review of the Senate debate indicates the Senators had no details todiscuss and every criticism went unanswered. Republican Senator Bristow(1861-1944) made bitter comments on the obvious conflict of interest:My allegation is that this bill has been drawn in the interests of the banks;that the Senator from Oklahoma, as the chairman of the committee, is largelyinterested in banks; that the profits which will accrue to those banks directlywill add to his personal fortune; that he has voted to increase the dividends onthe stock of the regional banks, which will be paid to the member banks, from 5per cent to 6 per cent; that he has voted against permitting the public to holdthe stock of these regional banks and has insisted that it shall be held by themember banks; and that he has voted against giving the Government the control ofthe regional banks and in favor of the banks controlling the regional banks, andit is for him to say whether he has violated the rule laid down in Jefferson'sManual.(3)The Senate debate, for what it was worth without a conference report, culminatedin a test of political strength on Monday, December 15, 1913. At this vote theamendments proposed by Senator Hitchcock - the only Democrat working against thebill - were tabled by a vote of 40 to 35.Hitchcock's amendments were aimed to make the Federal Reserve System agovernment rather than a private monopoly, i.e., the control of the Money Trustwould be placed in the Department of the Treasury.It is interesting that the Senate would overwhelmingly refuse to place controlof the money supply within the Treasury and prefer to hand it over to the Houseof Morgan. Colonel House had done his work well.On rereading the lengthy rambling debate, the likelihood of price inflation wasrecognized. The argument was a common sense approach that without the disciplineof limited gold and silver, the pressure of unlimited flat money would lead toprice inflation. The only argument against was a rather weak \"sound bankerswould not allow price inflation.\"Note that we use the term price inflation. In 1913 the term inflation alwaysreferred to \"currency inflation,\" i.e., expansion of the note issue. In theintervening decades the meaning has changed entirely. Today when the terminflation is used it always refers to price inflation, i.e., an increase inprices.The key Senator warning of inflation (currency inflation) ahead was SenatorRoot, who oddly accused Bryan, the pro-silver populist, as the dominatinginfluence behind the Federal Reserve Act (most unlikely, and a probable redherring).However, Root did warn of currency inflation and financial panic but thendefended the Glass-Owen bill on the grounds that no inflation could come about\"unless the sound money men who run the banks brought it about.\"Once again we have the Money power controlling the opposition, i.e., proclaimingarguments that can be easily countered while ensuring that the really potentcriticisms do not see the light of day.Today the irrefutable link between currency inflation and price inflation isburied in a confusion of academic double-talk and algebraic manipulation.Today's academic economists are so beholden to mathematical manipulation (withthe deluding plea of rigorousness) that they have entirely overlookedfundamental economic truisms. With very few exceptions (Hillsdale College,Ludwig von Mises Institute at Auburn University), academic economic departmentsare willing pawns of the modern money trust or the Federal Reserve System. (Thisauthor can speak first hand of the abysmal ignorance of the UCLA EconomicsDepartment in the early 1960s).The reply to Reed came from Senator Hitchcock, who pointed out that under theBill, \"the control of the currency system of the country would have to be turnedover to the bankers.\" Others like Senator Weeks were unconcerned on the groundsthat \"the United States has the most competent bank men in the world.\" But then,Weeks was a banker himself.The last speech on this Monday afternoon came from Congressman Mann of Illinois,the Republican floor leader who made the rather odd assertion that the U. S. wasin the midst of a financial and industrial panic which demanded passage of theFederal Reserve Act. Tuesday, December 16, 1913In Tuesday's Senate debate, Senator Root again emphasized the danger ofinflation from the proposed Federal Reserve Act. Constant interruptions,according to the New York Times (December 17), suggest that supporters of thebill were publicly worried. They argued in reply that inflation was not possibleif the securities issued were good government securities - to which Rootreplied:That is neither here nor there so far as my criticism of the bill is concerned.My objection is that the bill permits a vast inflation of our currency and thatinflation can be accomplished just as readily and just as certainly by loans ofthe Government paper on good security as upon bad security...emphasizing the point that;no one denies that in the past from time to time great commercial nations havefound themselves moving along a tide of optimism which, with the facilities ofeasy money has brought them to a point of most injurious and serious collapse.Root reinforced his \"tide of optimism\" argument as follows,...judgment becomes modified by the optimism of the hour and grows less and lesseffective in checking the expansion of business as the period of expansion goeson.He clinched the argument:...instead of doing our duty as the responsible legislative branch of theGovernment of the United States, we are shirking that duty and throwing it upona subordinate agency of the government.Unfortunately, Root did not push his argument to the limit, i.e., that this\"subordinate agency of government\" as he called it, was in effect going to be aprivate money monopoly of national bankers.The general response to warnings of inflation was to cite the existence of agold reserve backing for the money supply: proposed at 33 1/3 percent. Forexample, Senator Williams of Mississippi claimed that the great inflation fearedby Senator Root was only a \"bare mathematical possibility.\" Why? Because, arguedSenator Williams, \"no President conceivably would appoint one member of theboard who believed in fiat money.\" Eighty years later, Senator Williams to thecontrary, every single member of the Federal Reserve Board and its RegionalBanks is an ardent believer in fiat money and an adversary of gold! In PresidentWilson's era it was impossible to conceive that the role of gold could evercease. In President Clinton's era it is impossible for policy makers tovisualize that gold has any role at all. Wednesday, December 17, 1913On Wednesday the powerful behind-the-scenes pressure for the Federal Reserve Actsurfaced when the White House announced that it expected the Senate to pass acurrency bill before Saturday, that the House would accept this Senate versionof the bill without changes and the bill would then go to the President forsignature on Christmas eve. The flaw with this hurry-up scenario was that onWednesday Senator Root's warnings about price inflation had some effect and aDemocratic Party caucus was called, during the short dinner recess in theevening, to consider two of Root's proposals: (a) that the note issue should belimited by law and (b) that the gold reserve should be increased to 50 percentwith a heavy tax on \"depletions\" below this level.After discussion the note limitation amendment was rejected, but the caucus didadopt a proposal to increase the gold reserve to 40 percent while requiringthat a portion of regional reserve bank earnings be set aside as a gold reserve.It is interesting to note that the Democratic majority was well aware of thediscipline of gold and it was not the intent of Congress in 1913 in any way toreject, or even limit this discipline. In brief, the present day attempt todemonetize gold by phasing it out of the monetary system was not only rejectedby the Congress of 1913 but the dangers of any such demonetization wererecognized as ominous for the welfare of the United States.Even after the caucus, criticism was to be heard from a few Senators. SenatorCrawford of South Dakota didn't like the private monopoly aspects at all:...you are simply creating a bank of big bankers, a bank to help big banks, butfor which you assess the little banks to get the capital. The little banks aresimply commanded to carry wood and water for the big banks. You say to theVanderlips and the Hepburns and the Morgans and the Reynoldses, \"come in withyour short term paper and get the money\" but you say to the Smiths and theBrowns and the Joneses from the small country districts, \"go somewhere else withyour long term farmers paper; we cannot discount it.\"The intriguing aspect of the Wednesday evening is that while a majority ofCongress understood more or less the idea that the system would be inflationary,they were apparently unwilling to bring themselves to vote against the bill. Thursday, December 18, 1913By Thursday effective opposition had crumbled, and to speed passage the Senateoperated under a 15-minute rule. By this device half a dozen Hitchcockamendments were disposed of and others proposed in the previous night'sDemocratic Party caucus given little attention. The debate records seriousdoubts and differences of opinion coupled with predictions that the bill wouldbecome law before Christmas and signed on Monday or Tuesday of the followingweek. The opposition was sidetracked. Problems were overlooked. Fundamentalquestions, including the possibility of inflation, were bypassed by theleadership. One senses almost an air of panic - to pass a \"currency bill,\" atwhatever cost. Consequently, although the bill was known to be defective, theNew York Times for Friday, December 19 ran its reporting under the head, \"Nearend of tight on currency bill.\" The White House promptly announced that it wasconsidering names for Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. The first name tobe floated out of the White House was that of James J. Hill of the GreatNorthern Railroad. It was proposed by international banker James Speyer -confirming the behind- the-scenes activity of bankers. Friday, December 19, 1913On Friday, December 19, the Friday before Christmas when Congressional thoughtswere more on Christmas trees than money trees, the Senate passed PresidentWilson's currency bill without further ado by an overwhelming vote of 54 to 34.Every Democrat in the Senate, plus six Republicans and one ProgressiveRepublican, voted for the Federal Reserve System. Against the Federal Reservewere 34 Republicans. As a sop to criticism, the bill included a so-called\"radical amendment,\" i.e. that Congressmen could not serve on Federal ReserveBoards.Bankers, not unexpectedly, were reported to be \"relieved\" by the passage of thebill - but not fully satisfied and still pressed for changes in committee.William A. Gaston, President of the National Shawmut Bank, spent some days inWashington in conference with members of the House and Senate CurrencyCommittees and commented: \"...The prospective conference changes will make thebill more workable for the banks.-\"Edmund D. Hulbert, Vice President of Merchants Loan and Trust Company, added tothis: \"...on the whole it is a sound bill and will do much toward puttingbanking and currency on a sound footing.\"(4)W. M. Habliston, Chairman of the First National Bank of Richmond, stated, \"Itwill result in an elastic currency which will avert panics,\" and Oliver J.Sands, President of the American National Bank, commented thatThe passage of the currency measure will have a beneficial effect upon thecountry at large and its operation will help business. It seems to me thebeginning of an era of general prosperity....The only reported objection from bankers came from Charles McKnight, Presidentof National Bank for Western Pennsylvania: \"It will do the country no good....\" Saturday, December 20, 1913After passage of the Owen bill in the Senate the measure was sent to a jointHouse-Senate conference to iron out the major differences between the Glass billfrom the House and the Owen bill from the Senate. This conference excluded allRepublican members. The conference then met for four hours on Saturday evening,December 20, at which time at least 20 (some say 40) major points of differencein the two versions were uncovered, in addition to minor disagreements inlanguage requiring over 100 corrections. In most of these minor items the Senateyielded to the House. However, none of the 20 (40) major differences werediscussed in this Saturday evening conference, and it was generally agreed thatMonday passage of the joint bill was extremely unlikely. As reported by the NewYork Times (December 21, 1913), \"The points seriously at issue embodypractically all the substantial Senate amendments.\"In an effort to work out some of the major differences, the conferees agreed tomeet all day Sunday. Further, on this Saturday the full House met and refused toaccept the Senate version of the bill by a vote of 294 to 59 and then proceededto pass amendments binding on the House conferees.By Saturday evening, December 20, 1913, the following were some of the principalmajor points of dispute between the House and the Senate and reflectedsignificant, fundamental differences in the approach to a currency bill:First - the number of regional reserve banks,Second - the question of guarantee of deposits,Third - the amount of gold reserve to be required against the circulating notes,Fourth - the changes with respect to domestic acceptance in the case of domesticand foreign trade,Fifth - the changes in the reserve provisions,Sixth - the right of member banks to use the notes of the Federal reserve banksfor reserve purposes,Seventh - the status of the two percent Government bonds used as security fornational bank notes,Eighth - the Senate's provision with respect to an increase in national bankcirculation.This was the legislative position late Saturday night. Sunday, December 21, 1913Quite what happened on this Sunday in Washington, D.C. we shall never know forsure.What we do know is that on Sunday morning the Senate-House conferees were facedwith more than 20 (some say 40) fundamental differences on a criticallyimportant bill - a bill to affect the lives of every American then and in thefuture. Yet, the following Monday morning the New York Times (December 22)reported on the front page, \"Money Bill may be law today.\" The Times reportedthat in some undisclosed way the House-Senate conferees had adjusted theirdifferences. The \"newspaper of record\" put it this way:With almost unprecedented speed, the conference to adjust House and Senatedifferences on the currency bill practically completed its labors early thismorning (Monday 22nd). On Saturday the conferees did little more than dispose ofthe preliminaries, leaving forty essential differences to be thrashed outSunday.The \"almost unprecedented\" speed in the conference probably occurred at a mostunlikely time - between 1:30 a.m. and 4 a.m. Monday, December 22. Let's look atthat critical Monday in more detail. MONDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1913AT MIDNIGHT SUNDAY, DECEMBER 21, EITHER 20 OR 40 (DEPENDING ON THE SOURCE) MAJORPOINTS OF DISAGREEMENT REQUIRED RESOLUTION. AT 11 P.M. MONDAY, 23 HOURS LATER,THE HOUSE VOTED 298 TO 60 AND PASSED THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT. DURING THIS BRIEF23 HOURS THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES WERE RECONCILED, WORDED, SENT TO THE PRINTER, SETUP IN TYPE, PROOFREAD, PRINTED, DISTRIBUTED, READ BY EVERY MEMBER OF THE HOUSE,DISCUSSED, PONDERED, WEIGHED, DELIBERATED, DEBATED -AND VOTED UPON. THIS MIRACLEOF SPEEDINESS, NEVER EQUALED BEFORE OR AFTER IN THE U.S. CONGRESS, IS OMINOUSLYCOMPARABLE TO THE RUBBER STAMP LAWMAKING OF THE BANANA REPUBLICS. Mon. Dec. 22, 19131:30 a.m. –4:30 a.m.House-Senate conferees adjust 20 (40) major differences in the two bills. 4:30 a.mReport handed to printers12½ hours from conference to printed report 7:00 a.m.Proofs read 1:00 p.m.Printed copies delivered from printers 2:00 p.mPrinted report on Senate desks with notification of a meeting at 4 p.m 4:00 p.mRepublican members of conference go to Conference room – to be told that a billhad already been concluded5 hours from printed final report to House vote6:00 p.mPrinted conference report submitted to the House by Congressman Glass – mostHouse members go to the restaurant for dinner while the bill is read (1 ½ hours) 7:30 p.mDebate begins with a 20 minute speech by Glass 11:00 p.m.He House votes 298 to 60 in favor of the Federal Reserve Act. The manner in which the Federal Reserve bill was handled by the Democraticmajority and specifically by banker-politician Senator Owen andbanker-politician Carter Glass is reflected in a complaint on the Senate floorby Senator Bristow of Kansas, the Republican leader, in which he explains why hewould not sign the conference report:Mr. LA FOLLETTE: Would it disturb the Senator to inform us who did participatein this conference and whether any Senator declined to participate?Mr. BRISTOW: As to those who participated in the conference I am not advised. Iwas a member of the committee of conference appointed by the President of theSenate, but I had no knowledge as to the meeting of the conferees until afterthe report as it is before us had been made, printed, and placed upon the desksof Senators. I was then notified by the chairman of the committee that therewould be a meeting of the committee of conference at 4 o'clock, two hours afterthis report of the committee of conference of the two Houses of Congress on thebill (H.R. 7837) to provide for the establishment of Federal reserve banks, forfurnishing an elastic currency, affording means of rediscounting commercialpaper, and to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the UnitedStates, and for other purposes, had been placed upon my desk. I, in company withthe Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Nelson), visited the room where we were invitedto appear. We found the chairman of the committee and the Democratic members ofthe committee of conference there, and were given to understand that they hadperfected the conference report. We were then invited to express our opinion ofit, but I preferred to express my opinion where it might appear in the Record,rather than in the privacy of the committee room, and that I shall undertake todo this morning.I see this report is signed by the Democratic members of the committee. Ofcourse, I did not sign it because I was not invited to sign it, and I should nothave done so, anyway, for I did not know at the time the report was preparedwhat it contained, and I had no opportunity of ascertaining what itcontained.(5)In brief, the Republican leader did not know what was in the Act nor was hegiven the opportunity to find out what was in the Act. Later in debate Bristowdirectly accused Owen of inserting provisions for the profit of his own bank.There were major abuses of the legislative process in the passage of the FederalReserve Act - sufficient to void the act. If we have a society that lives byrules then there is no Federal Reserve Act.Both Finance Committee Chairmen, Congressman Glass and Senator Owen, hadconflict of interest with personal banking interests and stood to gain from thebill. Meetings to discuss the bill were held without knowledge of committeemembers. Decisions were arrived at and established without the knowledge andagreement of members. Major sections of the bill were settled withoutconsultation and railroaded into final form. There is indisputable evidence ofoutside banking influence upon Congress.The Federal Reserve Act is, even from our superficial investigation, suspectlegislation. Most of Congress had no idea of the contents of the final bill andcertainly none had the opportunity to reflect and consult with the broad base ofthe electorate. A private money monopoly was granted to a few national bankersunder suspect circumstances.As Congressman Lindbergh stated on December 23, 1913:This Act established the most gigantic trust on earth. When the President signsthis bill, the invisible government by the Monetary Power will be legalized. Thepeople may not know it immediately but the day of reckoning is only a few yearsremoved...CHART 9-2STAGE TWO: WOODROW WILSON IN DEBT TO THE MONEY TRUST[../images/00008.jpeg] ENDNOTES TO CHAPTER NINE (1) Congressional Record: Senate, February 8, 1915.(2) op. cit.(3) op. cit.(4) New York Times, December 20, 1913.(5) Congressional Record: Senate, December 23, 1913, p. 1468"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10The Federal Reserve Today Today in the 1990s the Federal Reserve quietly, and protected from any publicexamination or accounting, continues its never challenged monopoly of the moneysupply.Its twofold function is: (a) to regulate the flow of credit and money forspecific economic objectives, and (b) to supervise commercial banks, i.e.,mostly itself.The central policy-making body of the FRS is the Board of Governors appointed bythe President and confirmed by the Senate. Each of the 12 regional banks has itsown directors. These are divided into three classes. Class A directors representthe banking system, Class B directors represent industry and Class C, thepublic, supposedly.In fact, Class C directors have never represented the public. It is not at allunusual for a banker to serve a term as a Class A director then go on and serveanother term as a Class C director.The Federal Reserve is a private system owned by the banks (see figure below).Fed control over money is a private monopoly granted by Congress.It's so powerful that no Congressman dare ask simple questions.Of course, there is good reason why the Fed doesn't want citizens poking aroundasking questions. It is a moneymaking machine literally — and this is freelyadmitted by the U. S. Government. Here is an official statement:Where does the Federal Reserve get the money with which to create bankreserves'?It doesn't \"get\" the money, it creates it. When the Federal Reserve writes acheck it is creating money. This can result in an increase in bank reserves - ademand deposit or in cash. If the customer prefers cash he can demand FederalReserve Notes and the Federal Reserve will have the Treasury Department printthem. The Federal Reserve is a total moneymaking machine. It can issue money orchecks. And it never has a problem in making its checks good because it canobtain $5 and $10 bills necessary to cover its checks simply by asking theTreasury Department to print them. (Source: Money Facts, published by theCommittee on Banking and Currency, 1964, U.S. Congress.)Back in 1913 when the Federal Reserve Act was passed, the idea of a FederalReserve System - in effect a central bank - was promoted to the American peopleby both bankers and President Woodrow Wilson as an institution outside thecontrol and influence of bankers - on the grounds that monetary policy was tooimportant to be left in the hands of private interests. However, in fact, theinstitution is completely dominated, and always has been, by major New Yorkbankers.The Fed lied!The very first meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on October 5,1914, was held in the offices of the Bank of Manhattan, 40 Wall Street, NewYork. Bank of Manhattan later merged with Chase National to become ChaseManhattan Bank.Skipping intervening history for lack of space, we also find that in themid-1970s, the leading Class A director of the New York Fed was none other thanChairman of the Trilateral Commission - David Rockefeller. David's term expiredin 1976 and he was replaced by the chairman of Morgan Guaranty Trust. However,David's influence was perpetuated in two ways: by appointment of Trilateral PaulVolcker as president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, a permanent positionnot subject to the necessity of re-election at periodic intervals andappointment of G. William Miller (member of the Chase Advisory Board) asChairman of the Federal Reserve System, replacing Trilateralist Arthur Burns.Moreover, others (of the nine) Federal Reserve Bank of New York directors hadlinks to Chase Manhattan Bank. For example, the three Class B directors wereMaurice F. Granville, Chairman of the board of Texaco; William S. Sneath,Chairman of the Board of Union Carbide; and John R. Mulhearn, President of NewYork Telephone.Let's look briefly at the career of Paul Volcker, former president of the NewYork Federal Reserve Bank. In 30 years, Volcker has divided his time almostequally between the Federal Reserve Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank and sub-cabinetpositions in Washington, D.C. - a perfect example of the so-called \"revolvingdoor\" and the Trilateral objective of \"blurring the distinctions between publicand private institutions\" for Trilateral advantage.Paul Volcker was born in 1927 in New Jersey. His first degree is from Princeton,his M.A. from Harvard and his post-graduate work from the London School ofEconomics - that well known home of British socialism. In 1952, straight fromthe London School of Economics, Volcker joined the Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork as an economist. He stayed for five years, until 1957, at which timeVolcker moved from Liberty Street to become an economist for Chase ManhattanBank, where he stayed for four years, until 1961. In 1961, Volcker went to theTreasury Department in Washington, thus completing the first round of his threestop \"revolving door.\" Appointed as Deputy Undersecretary for Monetary Affairs,he held that job just long enough to learn the ropes in Washington, and returnedto New York, to Chase Manhattan Bank, as Vice President in charge of Planning. After three years in that post, Volcker left in 1969 to become Undersecretaryfor Monetary Affairs at the U.S. Treasury Department. After five years, Volckercompleted the second round of his \"revolving door\" with an appointment asPresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Volcker is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the RockefellerFoundation and the American Friends of the London School of Economics.If Paul Volcker was a solitary phenomenon, we could make no case for Trilateralcontrol of the Federal Reserve System. In fact, the Volcker phenomenon is one ofa dozen parallel situations. THE REVOLVING DOOR CAREER OFTRILATERAL PAUL VOLCKER1952-57 Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of New York1957-61 Economist, Chase Manhattan Bank1962-63 U.S. Treasury1963-65 Deputy Undersecretary for Monetary Affairs, U.S. Treasury1965-68 Vice President for Planning, Chase Manhattan Bank1969-74 Undersecretary for Monetary Affairs, U.S. Treasury1975President, Federal Reserve Bank of New York The Federal Reserve Board itself is appointed by the President.The original Federal Reserve Board represented those very interests that WoodrowWilson assured the American public would not be represented in the FederalReserve System. The Chairman of the Board was William G. M'Adoo, a prominentWall Street figure, former Secretary of the Treasury - and Woodrow Wilson'sson-in-law. A key appointment was Paul M. Warburg, the German banker brainsbehind the Federal Reserve System. The Warburg family controlled the ManhattanBank. Also on the Board was Charles S. Hamlin, of the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace. Another member of the original board was banker W. P. G.Harding. Franklin D. Roosevelt's uncle, Frederic A. Delano, was Vice Governor ofthe board - very appropriate because the \"liberal\" Roosevelts came from anold-time New York banking family. John Skelton Williams, President of theRichmond Trust Company was another member. Thus, the initial makeup of theoriginal Board of Governors reflected the elite and the banking interests andfrom that time on the Federal Reserve System has continued to reflect thoseinterests.Trilateral Arthur M. Burns was Chairman of the Board from 1970 to 1978, adominant voice who pretty much dictated Federal Reserve policy. According toBoard member and Trilateral Andrew Brimmer, \"Arthur Burns has had a direct handin selecting every board member.\"Trilateral dominance of the domestic monetary system suggests we examineTrilateral world order objectives for a possible linkage.Trilateral policy makers and analysts fully realize that the world monetarysystem, with created money as reserve assets, is in a state of collapse. TheTriangle Papers dealt with the world monetary systems (Towards a Renovated WorldMonetary System), and was authored by Richard N. Cooper (later Undersecretary ofState for Economic Affairs). Motoo Kaji, Professor of Economics at TokyoUniversity (author of a book in Japanese, Gendai No Kokusai Kinyu - ContemporaryInternational Monetary Affairs) and Claudio Segre, a French banker withCompagnie Europeenne de Placements.Triangle Paper No. 1 identified two world problems: (a), how to achieve fullemployment without \"rapid\" inflation, and (b), how to combine \"managed\" nationaleconomies into a \"mutually beneficial world economy.\"It is vital to hold Trilateralist assumptions in mind. Trilateralists are notlooking for a solution to the world monetary problems: Trilateralists arelooking for a \"solution\" consistent with, and which will promote, their ownobjectives. These objectives are: (a), a managed economy, i.e., managed byTrilaterals; and (b), a \"new world order\" of these managed economies.Once again we find manipulation of a problem to achieve Trilateral objectives.Almost on a daily basis we find reflections of the struggle to keep a hold onthe U.S. monetary system in order to achieve a world federal reserve system. FED MONETIZES FOREIGN DEBTIn the early 1980s the Fed, through Paul Volcker, conned Congress into anothervast expansion of monetary credit through monetization of foreign debtinstruments.The so-called Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of1980 is a total misnomer. In practice it brings all banks under Fed controlwhether they like it or not and gives the Fed power to vastly increase fiatmoney by monetizing foreign debt, much of it worthless (see attachedreproduction from the Bill).Once again the Fed did everything possible to avoid publicity. Only oneCongressman, Dr. Ron Paul, spotted the clause to monetize foreign debt. To avoidany publicity, theChairman of the Banking Committee quickly agreed to Paul's request to remove theclause: \"You want it removed? We'll take it out.\"Then we get a repeat of the unconstitutional conduct surrounding the 1913 FRSAct. The House voted for the Bill without the clause - but in ConferenceCommittee it was quietly re-inserted and became part of the Act as finallyapproved by both Houses. We doubt any Congressman knew what was included in thebill as finally passed - that's the influence of the Fed today.Quietly, without fanfare - and with the vast bulk of citizens unaware - theworld bankers have been building an international money machine: aninternational Federal Reserve System with power to control the world's financialand economic system.The elements of this global money machine can be traced back to the League ofNations and the Bank of International Settlements in the 1920s. After World WarTwo the International Money Fund and the World Bank were instituted to globalizecredit and loans.Then in the late 1950s came the Eurodollar market, now a vast internationalmarket dealing in deposits and credits denominated in dollars outside the UnitedStates. The Eurodollar system may in the light of history come to be seen as afirst step in a global dollar system. Eurodollars are dealt in by banks notresident in the U.S. and by institutions not subject to U.S. banking regulationsand restrictions.Paul A. Volcker, former Fed Chairman, has made the role of appointments to theFederal Reserve Board clear, - to support the Chairman's policy.In reference to Clinton appointment Alan Blinder, Volcker commented:I think a vice chairman has a responsibility for supporting policy in publicstatements. If he has any real difference of opinion at the end of the day thatshouldn't be disguised but as much as possible he should support theinstitution.In brief, the policy created by New York bankers should prevail, whatever thepersonal opinions of the Vice Chairman of the Board or any lesser Director.Which is about as close to a closed shop monopoly as one can get.In replying to criticism that he spoke out too much, Alan Blinder made arevealing comment: \"When we take actions, they are not reversible by any otherbody of government...\" New York Times, September 26, 1994.So here we have it. The Federal Reserve is a private monopoly of money creditcreated by Congress under highly questionable circumstances which is beholden tothe Chairman of the Board and whose decisions cannot be changed by Government oranyone else.A free society under the rule of law? The United States has quietly become ahostage to a handful of international bankers. And just dare any Congressmanchallenge Fed authority!Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Claims \"Some people think we're a branchof the Government. We're not. We're the banks' Bank.\"[../images/00009.jpeg] This confirms our discussion in this book."}]
