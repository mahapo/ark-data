I just got orders that I’m supposed to be here, not there. Well the last talk I gave at this forum was on a light pleasant t opic. It was about how humans are an en- dangered species and given the nature of thei r institutions they are likely to destroy themselves in a fairly short time. So this time there is a little relief and we have a pleasant topic instead, the new war on terror. Unfortunately, the world keeps coming up with things that ma ke it more and more horrible as we proceed. Assume Tw o Conditions for this Talk I’m going to assume two conditions for this talk. • The first one is just what I assume to be recognition of fact. That is that the events of September 11 were a horrendous atrocity probably the most devastating instant human toll of any cr ime in history, outside of war. • The second assumption has to do with the goals. I’m assuming that our goal is that we are interested in r educing the likelihood of such crimes whether they are against us or against someone else. If you don’t accept those two assumptions, then what I say will not be ad- dressed to you. If we do accept them , then a number of questions arise, closely related ones, which merit a good deal of thought. The 5 Questions One question, and by far the most impor tant one is what is happening right now? Implicit in that is what can we do about it? The second has to do with the very common assumption that what happened on Septem ber 11 is a his- toric event, one which will change history. I tend to agree with that. I think it’s Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 37"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The New War Against Terror true. It was a historic event and the question we should be asking is exactly why? The third question has to do with t he title, The War Against Terrorism. Exactly what is it? And there is a re lated question, namely what is terrorism? The fourth question which is narrower but important has to do with the origins of the crimes of S eptember 11th. And the fifth questi on that I want to talk a lit- tle about is what policy options there ar e in fighting this war against terrorism and dealing with the situations that led to it. I’ll say a few things about each. Glad to go beyond in discussion and don’t hesitate to bring up other questions. Thes e are ones that come to my mind as prominent but you may easily and plausibly have other choices. 1. What’s Happening Right Now ? Starvation of Three to Four Million People Well let’s start with right now. I’ll talk about the situation in Afghanistan. I’ll just keep to uncontroversial sources like t he New York Times [crowd laughter]. According to the New York Times there are seven to eight million people in Afghanistan on the verge of st arvation. That was true actually before Septem- ber 11th. They were surviving on inter national aid. On September 16th, the Times reported, I’m quoting it, that t he United States dem anded from Pakistan the elimination of truck convoys that provide much of t he food and other sup- plies to Afghanistan’s civilian population. As far as I could determine there was no reaction in the United States or for that matter in Europe. I was on na- tional radio all over Europe the next day . There was no reaction in the United States or in Europe to my knowledge to the demand to impose massive star- vation on millions of people. The threat of military st rikes right after Septem- ber.....around that time forced the remova l of international aid workers that crippled the assistance progr ams. Actually, I am quoting again from the New York Times. Refugees reaching Pakist an after arduous journeys from AF are describing scenes of desperation and fear at home as the thr eat of American led military attacks turns their long runni ng misery into a potential catastrophe. The country was on a lifeline and we just cut the line. Quoting an evacuated aid worker, in the New York Times Magazine. The World Food Program, the UN program , which is the main one by far, were able to resume after three weeks in early October, they began to resume at a lower level, resume food shipment s. They don’t have international aid workers within, so the distribution system is hampered. That was suspended as soon as the bombing began. They then resumed but at a lower pace while aid agencies leveled scathing condemnati ons of US airdrops, condemning them as propaganda tools which are probably doing more harm than good. That happens to be quoting the London Financia l Times but it is easy to con- tinue. After the first week of bombing, the New York Times reported on a back page inside a column on something else, that by the arithmetic of the United Nations there will soon be seven and a hal f million Afghans in acute need of even a loaf of bread and there are only a few weeks left before the harsh win- ter will make deliveries to many areas to tally impossible, continuing to quote, but with bombs falling the delivery rate is down to half of what is needed. Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 38 "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Noam Chomsky Casual comment. Which tells us that We stern civilization is anticipating the slaughter of, well do the arit hmetic, three to four million people or something like that. On the same day, the leader of Western civilization dismissed with contempt, once again, offers of negotiati on for delivery of the alleged target, Osama bin Laden, and a request for some evidence to substantiate the de- mand for total capitulation. It was dism issed. On the same day the Special Rapporteur of the UN in c harge of food pleaded with the United States to stop the bombing to try to save millions of vi ctims. As far as I’m aware that was un- reported. That was M onday. Yesterday the major aid agencies OXFAM and Christian Aid and others joined in that pl ea. You can’t find a report in the New York Times. There was a line in t he Boston Globe, hidden in a story about another topic, Kashmir. Silent Genocide Well we could easily go on....but all of that....first of all indicates to us what’s happening. Looks like what’s happening is some sort of silent genocide. It also gives a good deal of insight into the elite culture, the cu lture that we are part of. It indicates that whatever, what will happen we don’t know, but plans are being made and programs implemented on the assump tion that they may lead to the death of several million people in the next few months....very casually with no comment, no particular thought about it, that’s just kind of normal, here and in a good part of Europe. Not in the rest of the world. In fact not even in much of Europe. So if y ou read the Irish pre ss or the press in Scotland...that close, reactions are ve ry different. Well that’s what’s happen- ing now. What’s happening now is very mu ch under our control. We can do a lot to affect what’s happening. And that’s roughly it. 2. Why was it a Historic Event? National Territory Attacked Alright let’s turn to the slightly more abstract question, forgetting for the mo- ment that we are in the midst of apparent ly trying to murder three or four mil- lion people, not Taliban of course, their victims. Let’s go back...turn to the question of the historic event that took place on Sept ember 11th. As I said, I think that’s correct. It was a historic event. Not unfortunately because of its scale, unpleasant to think about, but in terms of the scale it’s not that unusual. I did say it’s the worst...probably the wo rst instant human toll of any crime. And that may be true. But there are terro rist crimes with effects a bit more drawn out that are more ex treme, unfortunately. Nevert heless, it’s a historic event because there was a change. The change was the direction in which the guns were pointed. That’s new. R adically new. So, take US history. The last time that the national territory of the United Stat es was under attack, or for that matter, even threatened was when the British burned down Wash- ington in 1814. There have been many...it was common to bring up Pearl Harbor but that’s not a good analogy. The Japanese, what ever you think about it, the Japanese bombed military bases in two US colonies not the na- tional territory; colonies which had been ta ken from their inhabitants in not a Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 39"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The New War Against Terror very pretty way. This is the national territory that’s been attacked on a large scale, you can find a few fringe examples but this is unique. During these close to two hundred years, we, the United States expelled or mostly exterminated the indigenous populati on, that’s many millions of people, conquered half of Mexico, carried out depredat ions all over the region, Carib- bean and Central America, someti mes beyond, conquered Hawaii and the Philippines, killing several hundred thousand Filipinos in the process. Since the Second World War, it has extended its reach around the world in ways I don’t have to describe. But it was a lways killing someone else, the fighting was somewhere else, it was others w ho were getting slaughtered. Not here. Not the national territory. Europe In the case of Europe, the change is even more dramatic because its history is even more horrendous than ours. We are an offshoot of Europe, basically. For hundreds of years, Eu rope has been casually slaughtering people all over the world. That’s how they conquered t he world, not by handing out candy to babies. During this period, Europe did suffer murderous wars, but that was European killers murdering one another. T he main sport of Europe for hun- dreds of years was slaught ering one another. The only reason that it came to an end in 1945, was....it had nothing to do with Democracy or not making war with each other and other fashionable noti ons. It had to do with the fact that everyone understood that the next time they play the game it was going to be the end for the world. Because the Europeans, including us, had developed such massive weapons of destruction t hat that game just have to be over. And it goes back hundreds of years. In the 17th century, about probably forty percent of the entire population of Germany was wiped out in one war. But during this whole bloody murderous period, it was Europeans slaughtering each other, and Europeans slaughtering peopl e elsewhere. The Congo didn’t attack Belgium, India didn’t attack Engl and, Algeria didn’t attack France. It’s uniform. There are again small exceptions, but pretty small in scale, certainly invisible in the scale of what Europe and us were doing to the rest of the world. This is the first change. The fi rst time that the guns have been pointed the other way. And in my opinion that ’s probably why you see such different reactions on the two sides of the Iris h Sea which I have noticed, incidentally, in many interviews on both sides, nat ional radio on both sides. The world looks very different depending on whether you are holding the lash or whether you are being whipped by it for hundreds of years, very different. So I think the shock and surprise in Europe and it s offshoots, like here, is very under- standable. It is a historic event but regre ttably not in scale, in something else and a reason why the rest of the world...most of the rest of the world looks at it quite differently. Not lacking sympathy fo r the victims of the atrocity or being horrified by them, that’s almost uniform, but viewing it fr om a different per- spective. Something we might want to understand. Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 40 "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Noam Chomsky 3. What is the War Against Terrorism? Well, let’s go to the third question, ‘W hat is the war against terrorism?’ and a side question, ‘What’s terrorism?’. The war against terrorism has been de- scribed in high places as a struggle against a plague, a cancer which is spread by barbarians, by “depraved opponents of civilizat ion itself.” That’s a feeling that I share. The words I’ m quoting, however, happen to be from twenty years ago. Those are...that’s President Reagan and his Secretary of State. The Reagan administration came in to office twenty years ago declaring that the war against international terrori sm would be the core of our foreign policy....describing it in terms of the kind I just mentioned and others. And it was the core of our foreign policy. The Reagan administration responded to this plague spread by deprav ed opponents of civilization it self by creating an extraordinary international terrorist network, totally unprecedented in scale, which carried out massive atrocities all over the world, pr imarily....well, partly nearby, but not only there. I won’t run th rough the record, you’re all educated people, so I’m sure you learned about it in High School. [crowd laughter] Reagan-US War Against Nicaragua But I’ll just mention one case which is to tally uncontroversial, so we might as well not argue about it, by no means the most extreme but uncontroversial. It’s uncontroversial because of the judgm ents of the highest international au- thorities the International Court of Justice, the World Court, and the UN Secu- rity Council. So this one is uncontrove rsial, at least among people who have some minimal concern for international law, human rights, justice and other things like that. And now I’ll leave you an exercise. You can estimate the size of that category by simp ly asking how often this uncontroversial case has been mentioned in the commentar y of the last month. And it’s a particularly relevant one, not only because it is unc ontroversial, but because it does offer a precedent as to how a law abiding st ate would respond to...did respond in fact to international terrorism, which is uncontroversial. And was even more extreme than the events of September 11th. I’m ta lking about the Reagan-US war against Nicaragua which left tens of thousands of people dead, the coun- try ruined, perhaps beyond recovery. Nicaragua’s Response Nicaragua did respond. They didn’t respond by setting off bombs in Washing- ton. They responded by taking it to t he World Court, presenting a case, they had no problem putting toget her evidence. The World Court accepted their case, ruled in their favor, order ed the...condemned what they called the “unlawful use of force,” which is another word for international terrorism, by the United States, ordered t he United States to terminate the crime and to pay massive reparations. The United States, of course, dismissed the court judg- ment with total contempt and announced that it would not accept the jurisdic- tion of the court henceforth. Then Nic aragua then went to the UN Security Council which considered a resolution calli ng on all states to observe interna- tional law. No one was mentioned but everyone understood. The United States vetoed the resolution. It now st ands as the only state on record which Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 41"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The New War Against Terror has both been condemned by the World Cour t for international terrorism and has vetoed a Security Council resolution calling on states to observe interna- tional law. Nicaragua then went to the General Assembly where there is tech- nically no veto but a negative US vote amounts to a veto. It passed a similar resolution with only the United States, Israel, and El Salvador opposed. The following year again, this time the United States could only rally Israel to the cause, so two votes opposed to observing international law. At that point, Nicaragua couldn’t do anything lawful. It tr ied all the measures. They don’t work in a world that is ruled by force. This case is uncontroversial but it’s by no means the most extreme. We gain a lot of insight into our own cultur e and society and what’s happening now by asking ‘how much we know about all th is? How much we talk about it? How much you learn about it in school? How mu ch it’s all over the front pages?’ And this is only the beginning. The United States responded to the World Court and the Security Council by i mmediately escalating the war very quickly, that was a biparti san decision incidentally. The terms of the war were also changed. For the first time there were official orders gi ven...official orders to the terrorist army to attack what are called “soft targets,” meaning unde- fended civilian targets, and to keep aw ay from the Nicaraguan army. They were able to do that because the United St ates had total control of the air over Nicaragua and the mercenary army was supplied with advanced communica- tion equipment, it wasn’t a guerrilla army in the normal sense and could get instructions about the disposition of t he Nicaraguan army forces so they could attack agricultural collectives, health c linics, and so on...soft targets with im- punity. Those were the official orders. What w as the Reaction Here? What was the reaction? It wa s known. There was a reaction to it. The policy was regarded as sensible by left liber al opinion. So Michael Kinsley who represents the left in mainstream discussi on, wrote an article in which he said that we shouldn’t be too qui ck to criticize this policy as Human Rights Watch had just done. He said a “sensible policy” must “meet the te st of cost benefit analysis” -- that is, I’m quoting now, t hat is the analysis of “the amount of blood and misery that will be poured in, and the likelihood that democracy will emerge at the other end.” Democracy as the US understands the term, which is graphically illustrated in the surrounding countries. Notice that it is axiomatic that the United States, US elites, have the right to conduct the analysis and to pursue the project if it passes their tests. And it did pass thei r tests. It worked. When Nicaragua finally succumbed to superpower assault, commentators openly and cheerfully lauded the success of the methods that were adopted and described them accurately. So I’ll quote Time Magazine just to pick one. They lauded the success of the methods adopted: “to wreck the economy and prosecute a long and deadly proxy war unt il the exhausted natives overthrow the unwanted government themse lves,” with a cost to us that is “minimal,” and leaving the victims “with wrecked br idges, sabotaged power stations, and ru- ined farms,” and thus providing the US candidate with a “winning issue”: “end- Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 42 "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Noam Chomsky ing the impoverishment of the people of Nicaragua.” T he New York Times had a headline saying “Americans United in Joy” at this outcome. Terrorism Works – Terrorism is not the Weapon of the Weak That is the culture in which we live and it reveals several facts. One is the fact that terrorism works. It doesn’t fail. It works. Violence usually works. That’s world history. Secondly, it’s a very se rious analytic error to say, as is com- monly done, that terrorism is the weapon of the weak. Like other means of violence, it’s primarily a weapon of the strong, overwhelmingly, in fact. It is held to be a weapon of the weak because t he strong also control the doctrinal systems and their terror doesn’t count as te rror. Now that’s close to universal. I can’t think of a historical exception, even the worst mass murderers view the world that way. So pick the Nazis. They weren’t carrying out terror in occupied Europe. They were protecting the loca l population from the terrorisms of the partisans. And like other resistance move ments, there was terrorism. The Na- zis were carrying out counter terror. Furthermore, the United States essen- tially agreed with that. After the war, t he US army did extensive studies of Nazi counter terror operations in Europe. First I should say that the US picked them up and began carrying them out itsel f, often against the same targets, the former resistance. But the militar y also studied the Nazi methods pub- lished interesting studies, sometimes critic al of them because they were inef- ficiently carried out, so a critical analysis, you didn’t do this right, you did that right, but those methods with the advice of Wermacht officers who were brought over here became t he manuals of counter insu rgency, of counter ter- ror, of low intensity conflict, as it is called, and are the manuals, and are the procedures that are being used. So it’s not just that the Nazis did it. It’s that it was regarded as the right thing to do by the leaders of western civilization, that is us, who then pr oceeded to do it themselves. Terrorism is not the weapon of the weak. It is the weapon of those who are against ‘us’ whoever ‘us’ happens to be. And if y ou can find a historical exception to that, I’d be in- terested in seeing it. Nature of our Culture – How We Regard Terrorism Well, an interesting indication of the natur e of our culture, our high culture, is the way in which all of this is regar ded. One way it’s regarded is just sup- pressing it. So almost nobody has ever hear d of it. And the power of American propaganda and doctrine is so strong that even among the vict ims it’s barely known. I mean, when you talk about this to people in Argentina, you have to remind them. Oh, yeah, that happened, we forgot about it. It’s deeply sup- pressed. The sheer consequences of the monopoly of violence can be very powerful in ideological and other terms. The Idea that Nicaragua Might Have The Right To Defend Itself Well, one illuminating aspect of our own a ttitude toward terrorism is the reac- tion to the idea that Nicaragua might have the right to defend itself. Actually I went through this in some detail with dat abase searches and that sort of thing. The idea that Nicaragua might have the ri ght to defend itself was considered Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 43"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The New War Against Terror outrageous. There is virtually nothing in mainstream commentary indicating that Nicaragua might have that right. A nd that fact was exploited by the Reagan administration and its propaganda in an interesting way. Those of you who were around in that time will remem ber that they periodically floated ru- mors that the Nicaraguans were getting M IG jets, jets from Russia. At that point the hawks and the doves split. The hawks said, ‘ok, let’s bomb ‘em.’ The doves said, `wait a minute, let’s see if the rumors are true. And if the rumors are true, then let’s bomb them. Because they are a threat to the United States.’ Why, incidentally were they getting MIGs. Well they tried to get jet planes from European countries but the Un ited States put pressure on its al- lies so that it wouldn’t send them means of defense because they wanted them to turn to the Russians. That’s good for propaganda purposes. Then they become a threat to us. Remember, they were just two days march from Harlingen, Texas. We actually decla red a national emergency in 1985 to pro- tect the country from the threat of Nicar agua. And it stayed in force. So it was much better for them to get arms from the Russians. Why would they want jet planes? Well, for the reasons I already mentioned. The Unit ed States had to- tal control over their airspace, was over flying it and using that to provide in- structions to the terrorist army to enable them to attack soft targets without running into the army that might defend them. Everyone knew that that was the reason. They are not going to use their jet planes for anything else. But the idea that Nicaragua should be permi tted to defend its airspace against a superpower attack that is directing te rrorist forces to attack undefended civil- ian targets, that was considered in the United States as outrageous and uni- formly so. Exceptions are so slight, you know I can practically list them. I don’t suggest that you take my word for this . Have a look. That includes our own senators, incidentally. Honduras – The Appointment of J ohn Negroponte as Ambassador to the United Nations Another illustration of how we regard terrorism is happening right now. The US has just appointed an ambassador to the United Nations to lead the war against terrorism a couple weeks ago. W ho is he? Well, his name is John Ne- groponte. He was the US am bassador in the fiefdom, wh ich is what it is, of Honduras in the early 1980’s. There was a little fuss made about the fact that he must have been aware, as he certainly was, of the large-scale murders and other atrocities that were being carri ed out by the security forces in Hon- duras that we were supporti ng. But that’s a small part of it. As proconsul of Honduras, as he was called there, he was the local supervisor for the terrorist war based in Honduras, for which hi s government was condemned by the world court and then the Security Counc il in a vetoed resolution. And he was just appointed as the UN Ambassador to lead the war against terror. Another small experiment you can do is check and see what the reaction was to this. Well, I will tell you what you are going to fi nd, but find it for yourself. Now that tells us a lot about the war against terrorism and a lot about ourselves. After the United States t ook over the country again under the conditions that were so graphically described by the pr ess, the country was pretty much de- Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 44 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Noam Chomsky stroyed in the 1980’s, but it has totally collapsed since in every respect just about. Economically it has declined sharpl y since the US take over, democ- ratically and in every other respect. It’ s now the second poorest country in the Hemisphere. I should say....I’m not going to talk about it, but I mentioned that I picked up Nicaragua because it is an uncont roversial case. If you look at the other states in the regi on, the state terror was far more extreme and it again traces back to Washington and that’s by no means all. US & UK Backed South African Attacks It was happening elsewhere in the world too, take say Africa. During the Reagan years alone, South African attacks, backed by the United States and Britain, US/UK-backed South Afric an attacks against the neighboring coun- tries killed about a million and a half peopl e and left sixty billion dollars in damage and countries destroyed. And if we go around the world, we can add more examples. Now that was the first war against terror of which I’ve given a small sample. Are we supposed to pay attent ion to that? Or kind of think that that might be relevant? After all it’s not exactly anci ent history. Well, ev idently not as you can tell by looking at the current discussion of the war on terror which has been the leading topic for the last month. Haiti, Guatemala, and Nicaragua I mentioned that Nicaragua has now bec ome the second poorest country in the hemisphere. What’s the poorest country ? Well that’s of co urse Haiti which also happens to be the victim of most US intervention in the 20th century by a long shot. We left it totally devastat ed. It’s the poorest country. Nicaragua is second ranked in degree of US intervention in the 20th century. It is the sec- ond poorest. Actually, it is vying with G uatemala. They interchange every year or two as to who’s the second poorest. A nd they also vie as to who is the leading target of US militar y intervention. We’re supposed to think that all of this is some sort of accident. That is has nothing to do with anything that hap- pened in history. Maybe. Colombia and Turkey The worst human rights violator in the 1990’s is Colombia, by a long shot. It’s also the, by far, the leading recipient of US military aid in the 1990’s maintain- ing the terror and human rights violations. In 1999, Colombia replaced Turkey as the leading recipient of US arms wo rldwide, that is excluding Israel and Egypt which are a separate category. A nd that tells us a lot more about the war on terror right now, in fact. Why was Turkey getting such a huge flow of US arms? Well if you take a look at the flow of US arms to Turkey, Turk ey always got a lot of US arms. It’s stra- tegically placed, a member of NATO, and so on. But the arms flow to Turkey went up very sharply in 1984. It didn’t hav e anything to do with the cold war. I mean Russian was collapsing. And it stayed high from 1984 to 1999 when it Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 45"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The New War Against Terror reduced and it was replaced in the lead by Colombia. What happened from 1984 to 1999? Well, in 1984, [Turkey] l aunched a major terrorist war against Kurds in southeastern Turkey. And that’s when US aid went up, military aid. And this was not pistols. This was je t planes, tanks, military training, and so on. And it stayed high as the atrocities escalated through the 1990’s. Aid fol- lowed it. The peak year was 1997. In 1997, US military aid to Turkey was more than in the entire period 1950 to 1983, that is the cold war period, which is an indication of how much the cold war has affected policy. And the results were awesome. This led to two to th ree million refugees. Some of the worst ethnic cleansing of the late 1990’s. T ens of thousands of people killed, 3500 towns and villages destroyed, way mo re than Kosovo, even under NATO bombs. And the United States was provid ing eighty percent of the arms, in- creasing as the atrocities increased, peaking in 1997. It declined in 1999 be- cause, once again, terror worked as it usually does when carried out by its major agents, mainly the powerful. So by 1999, Turkish terror, called of course counter-terror, but as I said, t hat’s universal, it worked. Therefore Tur- key was replaced by Colombia which had not yet succeeded in its terrorist war. And therefore had to move into fi rst place as recipient of US arms. Self Congratulation on the Pa rt of Western Intellectuals Well, what makes this all particularly stri king is that all of this was taking place right in the midst of a huge flood of se lf-congratulation on t he part of Western intellectuals which probably has no counterpar t in history. I mean you all re- member it. It was just a couple year s ago. Massive self-adulation about how for the first time in history we are so magnificent; that we are standing up for principles and values; dedicated to endi ng inhumanity everywhere in the new era of this-and-that, and so -on-and-so-forth. And we certainly can’t tolerate atrocities right near t he borders of NATO. That was repeated over and over. Only within the borders of NATO where we can not only can tolerate much worse atrocities but contribute to them . Another insight into Western civiliza- tion and our own, is how often was this brought up? Try to look. I won’t repeat it. But it’s instructive. It’s a pretty impressive feat for a propaganda system to carry this off in a free society. It’s pr etty amazing. I don’t think you could do this in a totalitarian state. Turkey is Very Grateful And Turkey is very grateful. Just a few days ago, Prime Minister Ecevit an- nounced that Turkey would join the coa lition against terror, very enthusiasti- cally, even more so than others. In fac t, he said they would contribute troops which others have not willing to do. And he explained why. He said, We owe a debt of gratitude to the Un ited States because the Un ited States was the only country that was willing to contribute so massively to our own, in his words “counter-terrorist” war, that is to our own massive ethnic cleansing and atroci- ties and terror. Other countries helped a little, but they stayed back. The United States, on the other hand, cont ributed enthusiastically and decisively and was able to do so because of the silenc e, servility might be the right word, of the educated classes who could easily find out about it. It’s a free country Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 46 "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Noam Chomsky after all. You can read human rights repor ts. You can read all sorts of stuff. But we chose to contribute to the atro cities and Turkey is very happy, they owe us a debt of gratitude for that and therefore will c ontribute troops just as during the war in Serbia. Turkey was very much praised for using its F-16’s which we supplied it to bomb Serbia exactly as it had been doing with the same planes against its own population up until the time when it finally suc- ceeded in crushing internal terror as they called it. And as usual, as always, resistance does include terror. Its true of the American Revoluti on. That’s true of every case I know. Just as its tr ue that those who have a monopoly of vio- lence talk about themselves as carrying out counter terror. The Coalition – Including Algeri a, Russia, China, Indonesia Now that’s pretty impressive and that has to do with the coa lition that is now being organized to fight the war against terro r. And it’s very interesting to see how that coalition is being described. So have a look at this morning’s Chris- tian Science Monitor. That’s a good new spaper. One of the best international newspapers, with real coverage of the wo rld. The lead story, the front-page story, is about how the United States, you know people used to dislike the United States but now they are beginni ng to respect it, and they are very happy about the way that the US is l eading the war against terror. And the prime example, well in fact the only seri ous example, the ot hers are a joke, is Algeria. Turns out that Algeria is very enthusiastic about the US war against terror. The person who wrote the article is an expert on Africa. He must know that Algeria is one of the most vicious terrorist states in the world and has been carrying out horrendous terror agains t its own population in the past couple of years, in fact. For a while, this was under wraps. But it was finally exposed in France by defecto rs from the Algerian army. It’s all over the place there and in England and so on. But here, we’re very proud because one of the worst terrorist states in the world is now enthusiastically welcoming the US war on terror and in fact is cheering on t he United States to lead the war. That shows how popular we are getting. And if you look at the coalition that is being formed against terror it tells you a lot more. A leading member of the coa lition is Russia which is delighted to have the United States support its mur derous terrorist war in Chechnya in- stead of occasionally criticiz ing it in the background. China is joining enthusi- astically. It’s delighted to have support for the atrocities it’s carrying out in western China against, what it called, Mu slim secessionists. Turkey, as I men- tioned, is very happy with the war agains t terror. They are experts. Algeria, Indonesia delighted to have even more US support for atrocities it is carrying out in Ache and elsewhere. Now we c an run through the list, the list of the states that have joined t he coalition against terror is quite impressive. They have a characteristic in common. They are certainly among the leading terror- ist states in the world. And they happen to be led by the world champion. What is Terrorism? Well that brings us back to the questi on, what is terrorism? I have been as- suming we understand it. Well, what is it? Well, there happen to be some Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 47"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The New War Against Terror easy answers to this. There is an official definition. You can find it in the US code or in US army manuals. A brief statement of it taken from a US army manual, is fair enough, is that terror is the calculated use of violence or the threat of violence to attain political or religious ideological goals through in- timidation, coercion, or instilling fear. That’s terrorism. That’s a fair enough definition. I think it is reasonable to accept that. The problem is that it can’t be accepted because if you accept that, all the wrong consequences follow. For example, all the consequences I have just been reviewing. Now there is a ma- jor effort right now at the UN to tr y to develop a comprehensive treaty on ter- rorism. When Kofi Annan got the Nobel Prize the other day, you will notice he was reported as saying that we should st op wasting time on this and really get down to it. But there’s a problem. If you use the official definition of terrorism in the com- prehensive treaty you are going to get completely the wrong results. So that can’t be done. In fact, it is even worse t han that. If you take a look at the defi- nition of Low Intensity Warfare which is o fficial US policy you find that it is a very close paraphrase of what I just read. In fact, Low Intensity Conflict is just another name for terrorism. That’s why a ll countries, as far as I know, call whatever horrendous acts they are carrying out, counter terrorism. We hap- pen to call it Counter Insur gency or Low Intensity Conflict. So that’s a serious problem. You can’t use the actual definit ions. You’ve got to carefully find a definition that doesn’t hav e all the wrong consequences. Why did the United States and Israel Vote Against a Major Resolution Condemning Terrorism? There are some other probl ems. Some of them came up in December 1987, at the peak of the first war on terrorism, that’s when the furo re over the plague was peaking. The United Nations General Assembly passed a very strong resolution against terrorism, condemning the plague in the strongest terms, calling on every state to fight against it in every possible way. It passed unanimously. One country, Honduras absta ined. Two votes against; the usual two, United States and Israel. Why shoul d the United States and Israel vote against a major resolution condemning terrori sm in the strongest terms, in fact pretty much the terms that the Reagan administration was us ing? Well, there is a reason. There is one paragraph in t hat long resolution which says that nothing in this resolution infringes on the rights of people struggling against racist and colonialist regimes or fore ign military occupation to continue with their resistance with the assistance of ot hers, other states, states outside in their just cause. Well, t he United States and Israel can’t accept that. The main reason that they couldn’t at the time was because of South Africa. South Af- rica was an ally, officially called an ally . There was a terrorist force in South Africa. It was called the African National Congress. They were a terrorist force officially. South Africa in contrast wa s an ally and we certainly couldn’t support actions by a terrorist group struggling agai nst a racist regime. That would be impossible. Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 48 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Noam Chomsky And of course there is another one. Namely the Israeli occupied territories, now going into its thirty-fifth year. Suppor ted primarily by t he United States in blocking a diplomatic settlement for th irty years now, still is. And you can’t have that. There is another one at the time. Israel was occupying Southern Lebanon and was being combated by what the US calls a terrorist force, Hes- bollah, which in fact succeeded in drivi ng Israel out of Lebanon. And we can’t allow anyone to struggle against a militar y occupation when it is one that we support so therefore the US and Israel had to vote against the major UN reso- lution on terrorism. And I mentioned before that a US vote against...is essen- tially a veto. Which is only half the story. It also vetoes it fr om history. So none of this was every reported and none of it appeared in the annals of terrorism. If you look at the scholarly work on te rrorism and so on, nothing that I just mentioned appears. The reason is that it has got t he wrong people holding the guns. You have to carefully hone the def initions and the scholarship and so on so that you come out wit h the right conclusions; ot herwise it is not respect- able scholarship and honorable journalism. Well, these are some of problems that are hampering the effort to dev elop a comprehensive treaty against ter- rorism. Maybe we should have an academic conference or something to try to see if we can figure out a way of defining terrorism so that it comes out with just the right answers, not the wrong answers. That won’t be easy. 4. What are the Origins of the September 11 Crime? Well, let’s drop that and turn to the four th question, What are the origins of the September 11 crimes? Here we have to make a distinction between two cate- gories which shouldn’t be run together. One is the act ual agents of the crime, the other is kind of a reservoir of at least sympathy, sometimes support that they appeal to even among people who ve ry much oppose the criminals and the actions. And those are two different things. Category One: The Likely Perpetrators Well, with regard to the perpetrators, in a certain sense we are not really clear. The United States either is unabl e or unwilling to provide any evidence, any meaningful evidence. There was a sort of a play a week or two ago when Tony Blair was set up to try to present it. I don’t exactly know what the pur- pose of this was. Maybe so that the US could look as though it’s holding back on some secret evidence that it can’t re veal or that Tony Blair could strike proper Churchillian poses or something or other. Whatever the PR [public re- lations] reasons were, he gave a present ation which was in serious circles considered so absurd that it was barely even menti oned. So the Wall Street Journal, for example, one of the more serious papers had a small story on page twelve, I think, in which they poi nted out that there was not much evi- dence and then they quoted some high US offi cial as saying that it didn’t mat- ter whether there was any evidence becaus e they were going to do it anyway. So why bother with the ev idence? The more ideological press, like the New York Times and others, they had big fr ont-page headlines. But the Wall Street Journal reaction was reasonable and if you look at the so-called evidence you can see why. But let’s assume that it’s true. It is astonishing to me how weak the evidence was. I sort of thought y ou could do better than that without any Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 49"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The New War Against Terror intelligence service [audience laughter]. In fact, remember this was after weeks of the most intensive investigati on in history of all the intelligence ser- vices of the western world working over time trying to put something together. And it was a prima facie, it was a very strong case even before you had any- thing. And it ended up about where it start ed, with a prima facie case. So let’s assume that it is true. So let’s assume that, it looked obvious the first day, still does, that the actual perpetrators come from the radical Is lamic, here called, fundamentalist networks of which t he bin Laden network is undoubtedly a sig- nificant part. Whether they were in volved or not nobody knows. It doesn’t really matter much. Where did they come from? That’s the background, thos e networks. Well, where do they come from? We know all about that. Nobody knows about that better than the CIA because it helped organize them and it nurtured them for a long time. They were brought together in the 1980’s actua lly by the CIA and its associates elsewhere: Paki- stan, Britain, France, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, China was involved, they may have been involved a little bit earlier, maybe by 1978. The idea was to try to harass the Russians, the common enemy. Accordi ng to President Carter’s National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski , the US got involved in mid 1979. Do you remember, just to put the dates right, that Russia invaded Afghanistan in December 1979. Ok. According to Brze zinski, the US support for the moja- heddin fighting against the government began 6 months earlier. He is very proud of that. He says we drew the Ru ssians into, in his words, an Afghan trap, by supporting the mojaheddin, getting them to invade, getting them into the trap. Now then we coul d develop this terrific mercenary army. Not a small one, maybe one hundred thousand men or so bringing together the best kill- ers they could find, who were radical Islamist f anatics from around North Af- rica, Saudi Arabia....anywhere they coul d find them. They were often called the Afghanis but many of them, like bi n Laden, were not Afghans. They were brought by the CIA and its friends from el sewhere. Whether Brzezinski is tell- ing the truth or not, I don’t know. He may have been bragging, he is appar- ently very proud of it, knowing the c onsequences incidentally. But maybe it’s true. We’ll know someday if the document s are ever released. Anyway, that’s his perception. By January 1980 it is not even in doubt that the US was orga- nizing the Afghanis and this massive milit ary force to try to cause the Rus- sians maximal trouble. It was a legitima te thing for the Afghans to fight the Russian invasion. But the US intervent ion was not helping the Afghans. In fact, it helped destroy the country and much more. The Afghanis, so called, had their own...it did force the Russians to withdrew, finally. Although many analysts believe that it probably delayed their withdrawal because they were trying to get out of it. Anyway, whatever, they did withdraw. Meanwhile, the terrorist forces that the CIA was organizing, arming, and train- ing were pursuing their own agenda, right away. It was no secret. One of the first acts was in 1981 when they assa ssinated the President of Egypt, who was one of the most enthus iastic of their creator s. In 1983, one suicide bomber, who may or may not have been c onnected, it’s pretty shadowy, no- Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 50 "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Noam Chomsky body knows. But one suicide bomber dr ove the US army-military out of Leba- non. And it continued. They have t heir own agenda. The US was happy to mobilize them to fight its cause but meanwhile they are doing their own thing. They were clear very about it. Afte r 1989, when the Russians had withdrawn, they simply turned elsewhere. Since then they have been fighting in Chech- nya, Western China, Bosnia, Kashmir, S outh East Asia, North Africa, all over the place. The Are Telling Us What They Think They are telling us just what they think. The United States wants to silence the one free television channel in the Arab world because it’s broadcasting a whole range of things from Powell over to Osama bin Laden. So the US is now joining the repressive regimes of the Arab world that try to shut it up. But if you listen to it, if you listen to w hat bin Laden says, it’s worth it. There is plenty of interviews. And t here are plenty of interviews by leading Western re- porters, if you don’t want to listen to his own voice, Robert Fisk and others. And what he has been saying is pretty cons istent for a long time. He’s not the only one but maybe he is the most eloquen t. It’s not only consistent over a long time, it is consistent with their actions. So there is every reason to take it seriously. Their prime enemy is what t hey call the corrupt and oppressive au- thoritarian brutal regime s of the Arab world and when the say that they get quite a resonance in the region. They also want to defend and they want to replace them by properly Islamist governments. That’s where they lose the people of the region. But up till then, they are with t hem. From their point of view, even Saudi Arabia, the most extrem e fundamentalist state in the world, I suppose, short of the Taliban, which is an offshoot, even that’s not Islamist enough for them. Ok, at that point, they get very little support, but up until that point they get plenty of support. Also they want to defend Muslims elsewhere. They hate the Russians like poison, but as soon as the Russians pulled out of Afghanistan, they stopped carrying out terro rist acts in Russia as they had been doing with CIA backing befor e that within Russia, not just in Afghanistan. They did move over to Chechnya. But there they are defending Muslims against a Russian invasion. Same with all the other places I mentioned. From their point of view, they are defending the Muslims against the infidels. And they are very clear about it and t hat is what they have been doing. Why did they turn against the United States? Now why did they turn against the Un ited States? Well that had to do with what they call the US invasion of Saudi Arabia. In 1990, the US established permanent military bases in Saudi Arabia which from their point of view is comparable to a Russian invasion of Af ghanistan except that Saudi Arabia is way more important. That’s the home of t he holiest sites of Is lam. And that is when their activities turned against the Unites States. If you recall, in 1993 they tried to blow up the World Trade C enter. Got part of the way, but not the whole way and that was only part of it. The plans were to blow up the UN building, the Holland and Lincoln tunnels, the FBI building. I think there were others on the list. Well, they sort of got part way, but not a ll the way. One per- son who is jailed for that, finally, among the people who were jailed, was a Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 51"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The New War Against Terror Egyptian cleric who had been brought into the United States over the objec- tions of the Immigration Service, than ks to the intervention of the CIA which wanted to help out their friend. A coupl e years later he was blowing up the World Trade Center. And this has been goi ng on all over. I’m not going to run through the list but it’s, if you want to understand it, it’s consistent. It’s a con- sistent picture. It’s descr ibed in words. It’s revealed in practice for twenty years. There is no reason not to take it seriously. That’s the first category, the likely perpetrators. Category Tw o: What about the reservoir of support? What about the reservoir of support? Well, it’s not hard to find out what that is. One of the good things that has happened since September 11 is that some of the press and some of the discu ssion has begun to open up to some of these things. The best one to my knowl edge is the Wall Str eet Journal which right away began to run, within a couple of days, serious reports, searching serious reports, on the reasons why t he people of the region, even though they hate bin Laden and despise everythi ng he is doing, nevertheless support him in many ways and even regard him as the conscience of Islam, as one said. Now the Wall Street Journal and ot hers, they are not surveying public opinion. They are surveying the opinion of their friends: bankers, profession- als, international lawyers, businessm en tied to the United States, people who they interview in MacDonald’s restaur ant, which is an elegant restaurant there, wearing fancy American clothes. That’s the people they are interview- ing because they want to find out what t heir attitudes are. And their attitudes are very explicit and very clear and in many ways consonant with the mes- sage of bin Laden and others. They are very angry at the United States be- cause of its support of aut horitarian and brutal regime s; its intervention to block any move towards democracy; it s intervention to stop economic devel- opment; its policies of devastating the ci vilian societies of Iraq while strength- ening Saddam Hussein; and they remember, ev en if we prefer not to, that the United States and Britain supported Saddam Hussein right through his worst atrocities, including the gassing of t he Kurds, bin Laden br ings that up con- stantly, and they know it even if we don’ t want to. And of course their support for the Israeli military occupation which is harsh and brutal. It is now in its thirty-fifth year. The US has been prov iding the overwhelming economic, mili- tary, and diplomatic support for it, and st ill does. And they know that and they don’t like it. Especially when that is pai red with US policy towards Iraq, to- wards the Iraqi civilian society which is getting destroyed. Ok, those are the reasons roughly. And when bin Laden gi ves those reasons, people recognize it and support it. Now that’s not the way peopl e here like to think about it, at least educated lib- eral opinion. They like the following li ne which has been all over the press, mostly from left liberals, incidentally. I have not done a real study but I think right wing opinion has generally been more honest. But if you look at say at the New York Times at the first op-ed they ran by Ronald Steel, serious left liberal intellectual. He asks Why do they hate us? This is the same day, I think, that the Wall Street Journal was running the survey on why they hate Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 52 "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Noam Chomsky us. So he says “They hate us because we champion a new world order of capitalism, individualism, secularism , and democracy that should be the norm everywhere.” That’s why they hate us. The same day the Wa ll Street Journal is surveying the opinions of bankers, pr ofessionals, international lawyers and saying `look, we hate you because you are blocking democracy, you are pre- venting economic development, you are s upporting brutal regimes, terrorist regimes and you are doing these horrible things in the region.’ A couple days later, Anthony Lewis, way out on the left, explained that the terrorist seek only “apocalyptic nihilism,” nothing more and nothing we do matters. The only con- sequence of our actions, he says, that c ould be harmful is t hat it makes it harder for Arabs to join in the coaliti on’s anti-terrorism effo rt. But beyond that, everything we do is irrelevant. Well, you know, that’s got the advantage of being sort of comforting. It makes you feel good about yourself, and how w onderful you are. It enables us to evade the consequences of our actions. It has a couple of defects. One is it is at total variance with everything we know . And another defect is that it is a perfect way to ensure that you escalate the cycle of violence. If you want to live with your head buried in the s and and pretend they hate us because they’re opposed to globalizat ion, that’s why they killed Sadat twenty years ago, and fought the Russians, tried to blow up the World Trade Center in 1993. And these are all people who are in the midst of ... corporate globaliza- tion but if you want to believe that, y eah...comforting. And it is a great way to make sure that violence escalates. That ’s tribal violence. You did something to me, I’ll do something worse to you. I don’t care what the reasons are. We just keep going that way. And that’s a wa y to do it. Pretty much straight, left- liberal opinion. 5. What are the Policy Options? What are the policy options? Well, t here are a number. A narrow policy option from the beginning was to follow the advice of really far out radicals like the Pope [audience laughter]. The Vatican immedi ately said look it’s a horrible ter- rorist crime. In the case of crime, you try to find the perpetrators, you bring them to justice, you try them. You don’ t kill innocent civilians. Like if some- body robs my house and I think the guy who did it is probably in the neighbor- hood across the street, I don’ t go out with an assault rifle and kill everyone in that neighborhood. That’s not the way you deal with cr ime, whether it’s a small crime like this one or really massi ve one like the US terrorist war against Nicaragua, even worse ones and others in between. A nd there are plenty of precedents for that. In fact, I ment ioned a precedent, Nicaragua, a lawful, a law abiding state, that’s why presumably we had to destroy it, which followed the right principles. Now of course, it didn’t get anywhere because it was run- ning up against a power that wouldn’t allo w lawful procedures to be followed. But if the United States tried to purs ue them, nobody would stop them. In fact, everyone would applaud. And there are plenty of other precedents.

And of course to wipe out West Belfast. Well, you know, quite apart from the feasibilit y, it would have been criminal idiocy. The way to deal with it was pretty much what they did. You know, find the perpetrators; bring them to trial; and look for the reasons. Because these things don’t come out of nowhere. They co me from something. Whether it is a crime in the streets or a monstrous terrorist crime or anything else. There’s reasons. And usually if you look at the reasons, some of them are legitimate and ought to be addressed, independently of the crime, they ought to be ad- dressed because they are legitimate. And that’s the way to deal with it. There are many such examples. But there are problems with that. One probl em is that the Un ited States does not recognize the jurisdiction of internat ional institutions. So it can’t go to them. It has rejected the jurisdiction of t he World Court. It has refused to ratify the International Criminal Court. It is powerful enough to set up a new court if it wants so that wouldn’t stop anything. But there is a probl em with any kind of a court, mainly you need evidence. Y ou go to any kind of court, you need some kind of evidence. Not Tony Blair ta lking about it on television. And that’s very hard. It may be impossible to find. Leaderless Resistance You know, it could be that the people w ho did it, killed themselves. Nobody knows this better than the CIA. Thes e are decentralized, nonhierarchic net- works. They follow a prin ciple that is called Leaderless Resistance. That’s the principle that has been developed by the Christian Right terrorists in the United States. It’s called Leaderless Resi stance. You have sm all groups that do things. They don’t talk to anybody else. There is a kind of general back- ground of assumptions and then you do i t. Actually people in the anti war movement are very familiar with it. We us ed to call it affinity groups. If you as- sume correctly that whatever group y ou are in is being penetrated by the FBI, when something serious is happening, you don’t do it in a m eeting. You do it with some people you know and trust, an a ffinity group and then it doesn’t get penetrated. That’s one of the reasons wh y the FBI has never been able to fig- ure out what’s going on in any of the popular move ments. And other intelli- gence agencies are the same. They can’t. That’s leaderless resistance or af- finity groups, and decentralized networ ks are extremely hard to penetrate. And it’s quite possible that they just don’t know. When Osama bin Laden claims he wasn’t involved, that’s entirely possible. In fact, it’s pretty hard to imagine how a guy in a cave in Afghani stan, who doesn’t even have a radio or a telephone could have planned a highly sophisticated operation like that. Chances are it’s part of the background. You know, like other leaderless resis- tance terrorist groups. Which means it’s going to be extremely difficult to find evidence. Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 54 "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Noam Chomsky Establishing Credibility And the US doesn’t want to present ev idence because it wants to be able to do it, to act without evidence. That’s a crucial part of the reaction. You will no- tice that the US did not ask for Security Council authorization which they probably could have gotten this time, not for pretty reasons, but because the other permanent members of the Security Council are also terrorist states. They are happy to join a coalition agains t what they call terror, namely in sup- port of their own terror. Li ke Russia wasn’t going to veto, they love it. So the US probably could have gotten Security Council authorization but it didn’t want it. And it didn’t want it because it follows a l ong-standing principle which is not George Bush, it was explicit in the Clinton adm inistration, articulated and goes back much further and that is t hat we have the right to act unilater- ally. We don’t want international author ization because we act unilaterally and therefore we don’t want it. We don’t ca re about evidence. We don’t care about negotiation. We don’t care about treatie s. We are the st rongest guy around; the toughest thug on the block. We do what we want. Authorization is a bad thing and therefore must be avoided. There is even a name for it in the tech- nical literature. It’s called establishing credibility. You have to establish credi- bility. That’s an impor tant factor in many policies. It was the official reason given for the war in the Balkans and the most plausible reason. You want to know what credibility means, ask your favorite Mafia Don. He’ll explain to you what credibility means. And it ’s the same in international affairs, except it’s talked about in universities us ing big words, and that sort of thing. But it’s basically the same principle. A nd it makes sense. A nd it usually works. The main historian who has written about this in the last couple years is Charles Tilly with a book called Coerci on, Capital, and European States. He points out that violence has been the l eading principle of Europe for hundreds of years and the reason is because it works. You know, it’s very reasonable. It almost always works. When you have an overwhelming predominance of vio- lence and a culture of violence behind it. So therefore it makes sense to follow it. Well, those are all probl ems in pursuing lawful paths . And if you did try to follow them you’d really open some ve ry dangerous doors. Like the US is de- manding that the Taliban hand over Os ama bin Laden. And they are respond- ing in a way which is regarded as tota lly absurd and outlandish in the west, namely they are saying, Ok, but first give us some evidence. In the west, that is considered ludicrous. It’s a sign of t heir criminality. How can they ask for evidence? I mean if somebody asked us to hand someone over, we’d do it tomorrow. We wouldn’t ask for any evidence. [crowd laughter]. Haiti In fact it is easy to prove that. We don’t have to make up cases. So for exam- ple, for the last several years, Hait i has been requesting the United States to extradite Emmanuel Constant. He is a ma jor killer. He is one of the leading figures in the slaughter of maybe four thousand or five thousand people in the years in the mid 1990’s, under the military junt a, which incidentally was being, not so tacitly, supported by the Bush and the Clinton administr ations contrary to illusions. Anyway he is a leading kille r. They have plenty of evidence. No Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 55"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The New War Against Terror problem about evidence. He has alr eady been brought to trial and sentenced in Haiti and they are asking the United St ates to turn him over. Well, I mean do your own research. See how much discussion there has been of that. Ac- tually Haiti renewed the request a coupl e of weeks ago. It wasn’t even men- tioned. Why should we turn over a convicted killer who was largely responsi- ble for killing four thousand or five t housand people a couple of years ago. In fact, if we do turn him over, who k nows what he would say. Maybe he’ll say that he was being funded and hel ped by the CIA, which is probably true. We don’t want to open that door. And he is not he only one. Costa Rica I mean, for the last about fifteen years, Costa Rica which is the democratic prize, has been trying to get the United States to hand over a John Hull, a US land owner in Costa Rica, who they char ge with terrorist crimes. He was using his land, they claim with good evidence as a base for the US war against Nicaragua, which is not a controversial conclusion, remember. There is the World Court and Security Council behind i t. So they have been trying to get the United States to hand him over. Hear about that one? No. They did actually confiscate the land of another American landholder, John Hamilton. Paid compensati on, offered compensation. The US refused. Turned his land over into a national park bec ause his land was also being used as a base for the US attack against Nicaragua. Costa Rica was punished for that one. They were punished by withholding aid. We don’t accept that kind of in- subordination from allies. And we c an go on. If you open the door to questions about extradition it leads in very unpleas ant directions. So that can’t be done. Reactions in Afghanistan Well, what about the reacti ons in Afghanistan. The init ial proposal, the initial rhetoric was for a massive assault wh ich would kill many people visibly and also an attack on other count ries in the region. Well the Bush administration wisely backed off from that. They were being told by every foreign leader, NATO, everyone else, every specialis t, I suppose, their own intelligence agencies that that would be the stupidest thing they could possibly do. It would simply be like opening recruiting offices for bin Laden all over the re- gion. That’s exactly what he wants. And it would be extremel y harmful to their own interests. So they backed off that one. And they are turning to what I de- scribed earlier which is a ki nd of silent genocide. It’s a.... well, I already said what I think about it. I don’t think anythi ng more has to be said. You can figure it out if you do the arithmetic. A sensible proposal which is kind of on the verge of being considered, but it has been sensible all along, and it is bei ng raised, called for by expatriate Af- ghans and allegedly tribal leaders internally, is for a UN initiative, which would keep the Russians and Americ ans out of it, totally. These are the two coun- tries that have practically wiped the country out in the last twenty years. They should be out of it. They should provide massive reparations.

And then it was going to be Infinite Justice, but the PR agents said, wait a minute, you are sounding like you are divinity. So that wouldn’t work. And then it was changed to enduring freedom.

And a there are pl enty of people around the world who have endured what we call freedom. Again, fortunately we have a very well- behaved educated class so nobody has yet poi nted out this ambiguity. But if its done there will be another problem to deal with. But if we can back off enough so that some more or le ss independent agency, maybe the UN, maybe credible NGO’s (non governmental organizations) can take the lead in trying to reconstruct something from t he wreckage, with plent y of assistance and we owe it to them. Them maybe so mething would come out. Beyond that, there are other problems. An Easy Way To Reduce The Level Of Terror We certainly want to reduce the level of terror, certainly not escalate it. There is one easy way to do that and therefore it is never discussed. Namely stop participating in it. That would automat ically reduce the level of terror enor- mously. But that you can’t discuss. Well we ought to make it possible to dis- cuss it. So that’s one easy way to reduce the level of terror. Beyond that, we should rethink the ki nds of policies, and Afghanistan is not the only one, in which we organize and trai n terrorist armies. That has effects. We’re seeing some of these effects now . September 11th is one. Rethink it. Rethink the policies that are creating a reservoir of support. Exactly what the bankers, lawyers and so on are saying in places like Saudi Arabia. On the streets it’s much more bitter, as you can imagine. That’s possible. You know, those policies aren’t graven in stone. And further more there are opportunities. It’s hard to find many rays of light in the last couple of weeks but one of them is that there is an increased open- ness. Lots of issues are open for discussi on, even in elite circles, certainly among the general public, that were not a couple of weeks ago. That’s dra- matically the case. I mean, if a new spaper like USA Today can run a very good article, a serious article, on lif e in the Gaza Strip...there has been a change. The things I mentioned in t he Wall Street Jour nal...that’s change. And among the general public, I think there is much more openness and will- ingness to think about things that we re under the rug and so on. These are opportunities and they should be used, at least by people who accept the goal of trying to reduce the le vel of violence and terror, including potential threats Human Nature Review – Volume 1, 2001, Page 57"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The New War Against Terror that are extremely severe and could ma ke even September 11th pale into in- significance.
