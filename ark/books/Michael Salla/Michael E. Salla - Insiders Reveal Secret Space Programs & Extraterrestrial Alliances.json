Hisrevelations have made it possible for the general public to learn about thedecades long development of highly classified space faring technologies, andsecret interactions with visiting extraterrestrial beings to our planet andsolar system.I indebted to the following investigators whose work in authenticating leakedU.S. and Italian official government documents was critical for my investigationinto secret space programs: Dr. Robert Wood, Ryan Wood, Alfredo Lisini, and Dr.Robert Pinotti. Thanks also to the many researchers who tirelessly submittedFreedom of Information Act requests for releasing many of the documents cited inthis book.I am grateful to the following witnesses and whistleblowers who provided keyhistorical data concerning flying saucer programs they directly witnessed and/orwere briefed about: Clark McClelland, Ralph Ring, Robert Lazar, Derek Hennessy(Connor O’Ryan), Stein (aka Kewper/Anonymous), and Edgar Fouche.Special thanks to Michael Relfe and Randy Cramer (aka Captain Kaye) for beingthe first to expose the covert “20 years and back” tours of duty, which are thebackbone of recruitment in secret space programs.I appreciate immensely the help of Aileen Hughes who did the proof reading,offered helpful editorial suggestions, and enabled us meet a tight publicationdeadline.Finally, I am especially grateful to my dear wife, Angelika Whitecliff, whoenthusiastically supported this book project from the beginning. She was thesage editor who urged me on when I most needed it. Angelika helped clarify myideas, remove redundancies, and got the draft manuscript in shape forpublication. I am eternally grateful for having such an incredibly talented andinspiring partner in life. "},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION President Ronald Reagan made a startling admission in his Presidential Diary onJune 11, 1985: > Lunch with 5 top space scientists. It was fascinating. Space truly is the last> frontier and some of the developments there in astronomy etc. are like science> fiction, except they are real. I learned that our shuttle capacity is such> that we could orbit 300 people.[1] [index_split_075.html#filepos702990] NASA’s Space Shuttle program at the time held a maximum of eleven people pershuttle, and only five were built for space flight. Even if all five took offfully loaded it would be impossible to place and maintain 300 astronauts inorbit. What Reagan had publicly revealed with the publication of The ReaganDiaries was astounding in its implications. He was telling the world that he hadbeen briefed about the existence of a space shuttle program entirely separate toNASA’s that could place hundreds of astronauts in orbit.Furthermore, Reagan had revealed that these 300 secret astronauts could bemaintained in orbit for an unspecified period, suggesting the existence of oneor more Earth orbiting space stations. These space stations would have to be farlarger than NASA’s Skylab space station, which during its six year deployment(1973-1979) could accommodate only three crew members at a time. With itslimited budget, civilian oversight and known space propulsion technologies, NASAwas certainly not capable of doing what Reagan said was happening in space in1985. If NASA was not responsible, who was behind the second space shuttleprogram? The obvious candidate is a highly classified U.S. military and/orcorporate space program(s).The idea of a secret space program with advanced propulsion technologies capableof traveling to one or more Earth orbiting space stations was boosted by theU.S. Department of Justice’s prosecution of British hacker, Gary McKinnon.McKinnon successfully fought against extradition to the U.S. for hacking intoU.S. government and military computers in his search for evidence of a cover upof UFOs. The US Department of Justice extradition case cited the irreparableharm caused by McKinnon’s security breach, which it called the \"the biggestmilitary computer hack of all time.\"[2] [index_split_075.html#filepos703323] ABBC Report described the full extent of what the Department of Justice wasclaiming according to one of its prosecutors: > The US government alleges that between February 2001 and March 2002, the> 40-year-old computer enthusiast from north London hacked into dozens of US> Army, Navy, Air Force, and Department of Defense computers, as well as 16 NASA> computers. It says his hacking caused some $700,000 dollars damage to> government systems. What's more, they allege that Mr McKinnon altered and> deleted files at a US Naval Air Station not long after the terrorist attacks> on September 11, 2001 and that the attack rendered critical systems> inoperable. The US government also says Mr McKinnon once took down an entire> network of 2,000 US Army computers. His goal, they claim, was to access> classified information.[3] [index_split_075.html#filepos703657] It’s important to emphasize that the Department of Justice, in pursuing itsextradition case, was confirming that McKinnon had successfully hacked into manyNASA and Pentagon computers to access classified files.McKinnon admitted to the hacking charges, and revealed that he was attempting tofind evidence of a government cover-up of advanced UFO technologies that couldassist humanity. He said that he came across secret Pentagon and NASA files thatcontained a list of “non-terrestrial officers,” and a spreadsheet detailing“fleet-to-fleet transfers.”[4] [index_split_075.html#filepos703991] He alsoclaims to have seen a large cigar shaped object in Earth’s orbit that could wellbe a secret space station. > It was above the Earth's hemisphere. It kind of looked like a satellite. It> was cigar-shaped and had geodesic domes above, below, to the left, the right> and both ends of it, and although it was a low-resolution picture it was very> close up. This thing was hanging in space, the earth's hemisphere visible> below it, and no rivets, no seams, none of the stuff associated with normal> man-made manufacturing. [5] [index_split_075.html#filepos704435] McKinnon ultimately prevailed in his decade-long extradition battle against theU.S. Department of Justice.[6] [index_split_075.html#filepos704807] His claimsof seeing computer files describing large cigar-shaped UFOs in orbit,'non-terrestrial officers' and 'fleet-to-fleet transfers', on Pentagon and NASAcomputers is directly supported by the U.S. Department of Justice’s legal casethat he did gain access to classified information. The classified files McKinnonaccessed very likely revealed the existence of a secret space program withastronauts and orbital space stations.The existence of a secret corps of astronauts is not hard to believe since theU.S. Air Force had secretly created one before. On Dec 10, 1963, the MannedOrbiting Laboratory project was publicly announced by the Johnsonadministration. In a television broadcast, Johnson said: > I am today instructing the Department of Defense to immediately proceed with> the development of a Manned Orbiting Laboratory. This program will bring us> new knowledge about what man is able to do in space.[7]> [index_split_075.html#filepos705195] It was a plan to build a manned space station in Earth’s orbit using the Geminispacecraft that would perform surveillance missions. The plan was officiallyscrapped in June 1969, three years before the first official flight, because itwas claimed to be cheaper to send unmanned spy satellites into Earth’s orbit.What the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) announcement didn’t mention was thatthe USAF began in January 1964 to secretly train military pilots for the MOLprogram, alongside pilots being trained for NASA’s civilian program. Atranscript of a PBS television show describes the secrecy surrounding theparallel military astronaut training program: > NARRATOR: Run by Chuck Yeager, the first man to fly faster than the speed of> sound, ARPS was a school where some military pilots, with the right stuff,> were groomed to become astronauts in NASA's civilian space program. This year> it was different. > RICHARD TRULY: As we went through our student year, and got toward the fall,> we realized that something funny was going on. And the thing that was funny> going on was, they were actually conducting a secret, I guess you'd say crew> selection. > JAMES BAMFORD: Without them knowing it, they were actually competing with each> other for this program. They were being watched and being evaluated by these> people to see who would make the best astronauts. The program was so secret,> it was even kept from the potential astronauts themselves.[8]> [index_split_075.html#filepos705512] The USAF’s Manned Orbiting Laboratory program confirms that military pilotsbegan to be secretly trained in 1964 for classified space missions, alongsidecolleagues who would later serve as NASA astronauts. By 1985, when Reagan recorded that he had been briefed about thereal capacity of a secret space shuttle program in his diary, one or moreclassified space programs had replaced the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL)program. The training of USAF and US Navy pilots for the classified program verylikely duplicated the same process used in the MOL program, where pilots werecovertly recruited for a classified space program when they believed they werebeing trained to be NASA astronauts. As Reagan said, by 1985, MOL’s replacementprogram(s) could house up to 300 astronauts in one or more secret space stationsin Earth’s orbit.Finding the truth behind Reagan’s extraordinary revelation and McKinnon’shacking claims requires diving deep into the shadowy world of highly classifiedaerospace programs. The problem in doing so is not only that publicdocumentation is at best scant, if available at all, but that possession ofdocumentary evidence of such programs can be illegal. In the U.S., there arethree main levels of classification: Confidential, Secret and Top Secret thatare applied to information, technology and programs deemed vital to nationalsecurity. The higher classification category of Top Secret is defined by law as:> > Top Secret shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of> which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the> national security that the original classification authority is able to> identify or describe. [9] [index_split_075.html#filepos705829] In the U.S. and all major countries, there are severe penalties for possessingand/or disclosing classified documents to anyone unauthorized to view these.This is well illustrated in the Bradley (aka Chelsea) Manning and Edward Snowdencases where both passed on classified information to unauthorized third parties.Manning was sentenced to 35 years in a military prison,[10][index_split_075.html#filepos706421] and Snowden has been granted asylum inRussia to escape criminal prosecution.[11] [index_split_075.html#filepos707090]Even third parties that play a role in releasing classified files throughwebsites can be subject to prosecution. Julian Assange was granted politicalasylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London because of legitimate fears that hewould be extradited to the U.S. to face charges for his role in releasing theManning files through his Wikileaks website.[12][index_split_075.html#filepos707591] Public officials briefed on highly classified aerospace programs are legallyobliged to refer to cover stories and lie about the program’s existence ifdirectly asked about it.[13] [index_split_075.html#filepos707920] This meansthat anyone seeking to confirm the existence of a highly classified program byasking a member of Congress/Legislature, or other public official aware of itsexistence would be given a cover story and/or lied to.Whistleblowers that disclose the existence of classified aerospace programs facesevere repercussions ranging from government surveillance, loss of financialbenefits, discrediting, prosecution, imprisonment, etc. Even personaldocumentation related to the whistleblower’s own background in terms ofeducation, employment, and accomplishments may have become classified duringtheir involvement in the classified program and then simply vanish from thepublic realm. This is referred to in the intelligence world as “sheep dipping,”and is a standard security procedure for personnel in highly classifiedprograms.[14] [index_split_075.html#filepos708366] A good example is the BobLazar case, where his employment record at Los Alamos National Laboratory wasremoved as a security measure for his more highly classified work at the Area 51facility. Investigative reporter George Knapp was finally able to prove Lazarhad worked at Los Alamos by finding his name in a phone book listing scientistswho were employed at the facility.[15] [index_split_075.html#filepos708729]It takes a brave whistleblower to come forward to disclose what he or she knowsabout classified aerospace programs. This is even more so when it comes to thesecret space programs that Reagan and McKinnon were referring to which rank veryhigh among the U.S. government’s vital national security interests.Nevertheless, there have been whistleblowers that have come forward to doprecisely that. These whistleblowers have emerged without any documentation tosupport their claims of being a part of and/or being briefed about secret spaceprograms. So where does that leave any researcher willing to investigate suchclaims?Carl Sagan’s dictum “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence” is notpractical when it comes to the claims of whistleblowers concerning secret spaceprograms. These programs involve vital national security interests that arehighly classified with the severe penalties described above for releasingdocuments proving their existence. The “extraordinary evidence” required bySagan is not something that can be lawfully possessed, let alone shared withthird parties to prove a whistleblower’s claims. Even sharing “extraordinaryevidence” with a member of the U.S. Congress for further investigation wouldn’tsuffice, since the member could then be given a national security briefing, andbecome legally obliged not to discuss the evidence, and even lie about it.A more appropriate research dictum to apply is “extraordinary claims requireextraordinary investigation.” This requires first recognizing thatwhistleblowers are eyewitnesses to events and/or documents revealing details ofsecret space programs. This investigatory approach is more suited to a legalinvestigation than a physical sciences investigation. In a court of law, whendocumentation or hard evidence is absent, emphasis is placed on whateyewitnesses directly recall of real world events or experiences, and the judgeand jury assesses the competence, character, sincerity, consistency, etc., ofthe witnesses. A physical sciences investigation instead focuses on whatdocuments or scientific instruments tell us about the same events orexperiences. What eyewitnesses recall seeing of the phenomenon underinvestigation is dismissed in the latter type of investigation.This book will introduce a number of whistleblowers who have made extraordinaryclaims regarding secret space programs that they either directly served inand/or were briefed about. These whistleblowers don’t have documentary evidencesupporting their claims, which is not surprising given the vital nationalsecurity interests associated with what they have direct knowledge of. Thatmeans in addition to their own personal eyewitness testimony—which is admissiblein a court of law—we also need to consider circumstantial evidence supportingtheir claims.It is worth pointing out that circumstantial evidence is admissible in courts oflaw where direct evidence is lacking.[16] [index_split_075.html#filepos709030]Circumstantial evidence together with direct eyewitness testimony is sufficientto convince juries of guilt or innocence in legal cases, so it’s important toconsider this type of evidence in relation to the claims of the whistleblowerspresented in this book.In particular, this book will investigate the extraordinary claims of CoreyGoode concerning five secret space programs that he claims to have directly beeninvolved with and/or been briefed about. He says he was trained as an “intuitiveempath” and completed a 20 year tour of duty from 1987 to 2007 in several ofthese programs, including one called: “Solar Warden.” Goode claims that in thecourse of his duty, he came into direct contact with different extraterrestrialgroups and alliances that interacted with one or more of the space programs. Hesays that he served on teams with three intuitive empaths used to detectdeception during negotiations between different space programs, and/or withextraterrestrial visitors. Goode said that his position allowed him unrestrictedaccess to “Smart Glass Pads” that had extensive information about highlyclassified history, science, medicine and other topics related to secret spaceprograms and extraterrestrial life.[17] [index_split_075.html#filepos709378]Goode further claims that in early 2015, he was made the delegate of an allianceof newly arrived extraterrestrial visitors. This included a group called the“Blue Avians” who facilitated meetings that he attended between the differentsecret space programs and other extraterrestrial groups. He says that these newvisitors have superior technologies in comparison to anything previouslywitnessed, and have implemented a solar system wide quarantine which directlyimpacts all the space programs and other extraterrestrial groups.If all this isn’t incredible enough, Goode claims that after completing his tourof duty in 2007, he was age-regressed and sent back in time to a period shortlyafter he was first taken from his family in 1986 at age 16. That means that helived the same period of time, 1986-2007, as both an ordinary civilian and as asecret space program astronaut. Also, his memories were wiped or “blank-slated”and Goode, now a civilian, was encouraged not to rejoin any military service,because it could trigger memory recall of his prior 20 year service. At thispoint, some readers might start thinking about Rod Sterling’s Twilight Zone andwonder whether the surreal scenario being described thus far is pure fiction.So far, Goode’s extraordinary claims are being taken very seriously by a numberof researchers and organizations that have investigated them. These include NewYork Times bestselling author David Wilcock, who was among the first tointerview Goode in 2014, and reveal the implications of his testimony to theworld.[18] [index_split_075.html#filepos709842] Wilcock claims that he vettedGoode extensively and found that his testimony was corroborated by insiders whohad a reliable past track record in disclosing what was happening in secretprograms.[19] [index_split_075.html#filepos710821] Wilcock introduced Goode tothe producers and owners of Gaiam TV who were equally impressed by Goode’stestimony. After vetting Goode using their own independent sources—completelyseparate to Wilcock’s—they gave Goode the thumbs up and authorized Wilcock tostart a year-long online television series called Cosmic Disclosure: Inside theSecret Space Program with Corey Goode and David Wilcock.[20][index_split_075.html#filepos711410] This was no small endorsement given theconsiderable financial resources and prestige that an innovative alternativetelevision program risked by going ahead with the series. Figure 1. Corey Goode's Timelines[images/00010.jpg] In my own independent vetting of Goode, I found his claims proved to beconsistent with other whistleblowers saying they had similar 20 year tours ofduty with secret space programs, which also used advanced age-regression andtime travel technologies to return them to ordinary civilian life. A comparisonof the claims of these other whistleblowers alongside Goode’s appears in chapter12. Also, I found a compelling body of circumstantial evidence in unfoldingglobal events, which convincingly support Goode’s extraordinary claims.Goode’s testimony of attending secret space program meetings in June 2015, willbe examined in this book, and can be linked to the following global events onrelated issues that occurred simultaneously: > 1. On June 15, 2015, the “Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act”> was forwarded to the full House of Representatives for a vote that offers> legal protection to off-world mining operations and the crimes committed in> them by those in charge of secret space programs [chapter 13]; > 2. The June 4, 2015 and subsequent announcements of hacking of up to 21> million records of Federal employees and contractors with detailed personnel> information that could be used for setting up “crimes against humanity” trials> for secret space program personnel [chapter 14]; > 3. The June 11, 2015 meeting of British Interplanetary Society members> discussing ways to remove from power tyrannical corporate personnel, from> hypothetical colonies on Mars, who have committed crimes against humanity> [chapter 13]; > 4. The reemergence of Wikileaks’ digital drop box system in early May> 2015, which allows whistleblowers to anonymously upload massive document dumps> for public release by an organization with a track record in doing precisely> what Goode claims will soon be occurring [chapter 14]. None of this circumstantial evidence is definitive proof of Goode’s claims. Yetit is compelling evidence insofar as it corroborates his core claims that globalevents are occurring that will lead to future disclosures about secret spaceprograms, extraterrestrial life, and trials for those responsible for crimesagainst humanity in space.Finally, I had the opportunity to conduct extensive email interviews with Goodeover a four month period (March – August 2015) and found his testimony to beconsistent, coherent and sincere. What was most impressive was Goode’swillingness to devote considerable time and resources to disclosing informationthat had negatively impacted his professional career, where he previously earneda six figure salary, and threatened the safety and well-being of his wife andtwo young children.All the above merits an extraordinary investigation into the extraordinaryclaims of Corey Goode. This book reveals my investigation of Goode’s claims;given the available public documentation and whistleblower testimonies availableto researchers concerning secret space programs.In the first three chapters, the development of secret advanced aerospaceprojects using “electrogravitic propulsion” and “magnetic gravity cancellation”technologies in the U.S., Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, are examined.Documentation and whistleblower testimonies reveal the genesis of secretprograms, where these advanced technologies were first developed. Theinformation presented has an intriguing consistency with Goode’s claims aboutthe origin of secret space programs.Chapters four to eight include five secret space programs that Goode claims haveemerged in the modern era, and which he has had direct personal experience with.Publicly available information is presented which casts light on each of theprograms discussed. While these available public sources by no means proveGoode’s claims, they do make them very plausible.Chapters nine and ten respectively illustrate the fate of three modern civilianspace programs, and evidence of ancient elite-controlled space programs.According to Goode, the latter continue to operate and have made contact withmodern space programs, and ordinary civilians from around the world.Chapter 11 examines whistleblower claims that up to 22 extraterrestrial groupsare directly interacting with the Earth’s population in long-term geneticexperiments. Goode’s claims that these alien groups are conducting diplomaticrelations with different secret space programs are analyzed. In chapter 12,whistleblower claims that the moon is a neutral zone for diplomatic relationsbetween different space programs and extraterrestrial groups is reviewed in thecontext of NASA Apollo astronauts being warned off the moon. Chapter 13 gives a comparative study of Goode, along with two otherwhistleblowers, claiming to have also completed 20 year tours-of-duty in secretspace programs, who also claim to have been age-regressed and time travelledback into ordinary civilian life. The comparative analysis shows no evidence ofcross contamination between the different testimonies, suggesting thesimilarities are a result of genuinely independent events experienced by eachindividual whistleblower.Chapter 14 focuses on available information concerning Goode’s claims regardingsecret space program activities on Mars and the use of slave labor. The originof these exploitative work practices is analyzed in terms of the influence ofNazi SS ideals in aerospace corporations involved in secret space programs.The final chapter explores the role of the extraterrestrial “Sphere BeingAlliance”, that Goode claims he was appointed to represent at ongoing secretspace program meetings beginning in March 2015, concerning a “full disclosureevent.” The consequences of this event are far reaching and have unusualsupporting elements for a positive future outcome.Available public documents help corroborate many of Goode’s claims, and providean overall context for understanding the full scope of what he has disclosed.Goode’s testimony provides clear answers as to what Reagan was briefed about in1985, and what McKinnon saw in 2002, concerning classified space programs. Theseprograms have been an integral part of a complex jigsaw puzzle concerning UFOs,extraterrestrial life, ancient societies and advanced aerospace technologiesthat have long defied any coherent understanding. Now finally, we have supportto put all the pieces together. A detailed investigation of Goode’s and otherwhistleblower testimonies reveals the big picture of a parallel world of secretspace programs with non-terrestrial bases and extraterrestrial alliances, thefull disclosure of which will unshackle the chains of deception holding humanityback from reaching its highest potential.

Salla, M.A., Ph.D.August 8, 2015Kalapana, Hawaii "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 Classified Hybrid Antigravity Spacecraft: A Cover for the Real Secret SpaceProgram To deploy and accommodate 300 astronauts in space, as President Reagan mentionedin his June 11, 1985 diary entry, the propulsion technology used in theassociated secret space program would need to be far more advanced than NASA’scivilian space shuttle program, which officially ran from 1981 to 2011. [21][index_split_075.html#filepos711735] NASA’s space shuttles were attached to twobooster rockets using solid state propellants for the first two minutes offlight before being jettisoned. Then the shuttle’s three main engines(Rocketdyne RS-25) would provide the necessary thrust using liquid hydrogen andliquid oxygen carried in an external fuel tank. Once the space shuttle (akaOrbiter) reached its orbit, it would cut off its main engines and jettison theexternal tank.The space shuttle had a maximum payload of 25 metric tons (55,000 lbs) and couldcarry a maximum of 11 people. It took 26 Space Shuttle flights to help constructthe International Space Station, which accommodates a permanent crew of sixastronauts.[22] [index_split_075.html#filepos712068] To carry three hundredastronauts into Earth orbit, and to maintain them there secretly, would requirespace stations far larger than the one-acre size International Space Station.The building of large space stations would require fleets of space shuttles withadvanced propulsion systems to carry large payloads to build the structuresneeded to accommodate so many astronauts. The classified files of“non-terrestrial officers” and “fleet-to-fleet transfers Garry McKinnondescribed seeing in classified Pentagon files, would help explain the scale ofthe secret space program(s) that had to dwarf NASA’s space program.According to what President Reagan revealed about his 1985 briefing and whatGary McKinnon found in 2000-2002, it becomes apparent that NASA’s space shuttleprogram was a very expensive cover for another more highly classified andadvanced space program. This significantly advanced space program would requirea propulsion system far more powerful than what NASA used, in order to flyhundreds of secret astronauts into space and to accommodate them in largeorbital space stations. The principle obstacle such a propulsion system wouldneed to overcome, to complete such a massive operation, is gravity.In response to a question about Reagan’s claim that “our shuttle capacity issuch that we could orbit 300 people,” Corey Goode wrote: > There is a craft that is a personnel transport shuttle that transports 300> people when carrying lower deck cargo or near 600 people when transporting> personnel only. I believe Regan was most likely referring to some of the> Military Personnel Carriers that were designed to deliver just below 300> Special Operators and their Equipment anywhere in the world in less than an> hour. It was a part of the Military Black Op’s SDI [Strategic Defense> Initiative] Space Program. It was a rapid deployment shuttle for extreme> circumstances and could deliver Delta/SEAL Teams/Forces undetected via this> secret craft that was a huge Stealth Shuttle with Electro Static/Magnetic> Gravity Cancellation. I do not know if it was ever used.[23]> [index_split_075.html#filepos712426] Goode’s reference to “Electro Static/Magnetic Gravity Cancellation” propulsiontechnology is significant. The key to discovering the propulsion system used bya classified military space program dwarfing NASA’s civilian program, lies ininformation known about classified research into “gravity-cancelation,”“electrostatic” or “antigravity” propulsion systems. "},{"pageContent":"Biefeld-Brown Effect and Electrogravitic Propulsion There have long been rumors that classified antigravity technologies have beensecretly developed by military-corporate entities, but kept from the publicrealm for over seven decades. These technologies are based on the Biefeld-BrownEffect, which was pioneered by Thomas Townsend Brown. In a 1929 paper, Browndescribed how Einstein’s efforts to develop a unified field theory had inspiredhim to find a fundamental connection between matter, gravity and electricity. > There is a decided tendency in the physical sciences to unify the great basic> laws and to relate, by a single structure or mechanism, such individual> phenomena as gravitation, electrodynamics and even matter itself. It is found> that matter and electricity are very closely related in structure. In the> final analysis matter loses its traditional individuality and becomes merely> an \"electrical condition.\" In fact, it might be said that the concrete body of> the universe is nothing more than an assemblage of energy which, in itself, is> quite intangible. Of course, it is self-evident that matter is connected with> gravitation and it follows logically that electricity is likewise connected.> These relations exist in the realm of pure energy and consequently are very> basic in nature. In all reality they constitute the true backbone of the> universe. It is needless to say that the relations are not simple, and full> understanding of their concepts is complicated by the outstanding lack of> information and research on the real nature of gravitation.[24]> [index_split_075.html#filepos712935] Brown went on to describe the first practical application of his theory in 1924: > The writer and his colleagues anticipated the present situation even as early> as 1923, and began at that time to construct the necessary theoretical bridge> between the two then separate phenomena, electricity and gravitation. The> first actual demonstration of the relation was made in 1924. Observations were> made of the individual and combined motions of two heavy lead balls which were> suspended by wires 45 cm. apart. The balls were given opposite electrical> charges and the charges were maintained. Sensitive optical methods were> employed in measuring the movements….\"[25]> [index_split_075.html#filepos713440] Brown observed that there was an electro-gravitational interaction which createda previously “unknown force”: > The newly discovered force was quite obviously the resultant physical effect> of an electro-gravitational interaction. It represented the first actual> evidence of the very basic relationship. The force was named \"gravitator> action\" for want of a better term and the apparatus or system of masses> employed was called a \"gravitator.\"[26] [index_split_075.html#filepos713945] Basically, Brown had learned that high voltage electrostatic charges can providepowerful thrust. After improving his experiments and measurements, Brown filedfor a British patent in August 1927, which was granted to him in November1928.[27] [index_split_075.html#filepos714450] Figure 2. Gravitator depicted in Brown’s Patent[images/00034.jpg] The title for his successful patent was: “A Method of and an Apparatus orMachine for Producing Force or Motion.” In the accompanying text, Browndescribes his invention: > This invention relates to a method of controlling gravitation and for deriving> power therefrom, and to a method of producing linear force or motion. The> method is fundamentally electrical. The invention also relates to machines or> apparatus requiring electrical energy that control or influence the> gravitational field or the energy of gravitation; also to machines or> apparatus requiring electrical energy that exhibit a linear force or motion> which is believed to be independent of all frames of reference save that which> is at rest relative to the universe taken as a whole, and said linear force or> motion is furthermore believed to have no equal and opposite reaction that can> be observed by any method commonly known and accepted by the physical science> to date.[28] [index_split_075.html#filepos714712] Brown’s statement that he observed “no equal and opposite reaction” isfundamental to understanding how antigravity technology is very different fromtraditional propulsion systems. In the liquid and solid state propulsion systemsused in NASA’s space shuttle program, the material ejected from the shuttle’srockets at a very high velocity provides an “equal and opposite reaction,” whichis the thrust from the shuttle to move forward. In Brown’s experiment, somethingvery different was happening. Brown went on to describe how his gravitation invention works in terms of twoparts that have respective positive and negative charges: > Such a machine has two major parts A and B. These parts may be composed of any> material capable of being charged electrically. Mass A and mass B may be> termed electrodes A and B respectively. Electrode A is charged negatively with> respect to electrode B, or what is substantially the same, electrode B is> charged positively with respect to electrode A, or what is usually the case,> electrode A has an excess of electrons while electrode B has an excess of> protons.[29] [index_split_075.html#filepos715198] A simple way of understanding Brown’s gravitator is to think of a typicalhousehold battery with a positive end (A) and negative end (B). The relevantforces between the two ends of the battery are a combination of the forceexerted by gravitational attraction between two masses A and B; and anelectrical attractive force created by the positive and negative battery ends.It’s when the electrostatic charge between the two parts A and B (the battery’svoltage) grow sufficiently large, that Brown noticed that an additionalforce—“force x”—is created that alters the effect of gravity: > While charged in this manner the total force of A towards B is the sum of> force g (due to the normal gravitational field), and force e (due to the> imposed electrical field) and force x (due to the resultant of the unbalanced> gravitational forces caused by the electro negative charge or by the presence> of an excess of electrons of electrode A and by the electro positive charge or> by the presence of an excess of protons on electrode B). [30]> [index_split_075.html#filepos715684] Brown then continues to describe the thrust force created by the two oppositelycharged objects A and B: > By the cancellation of similar and opposing forces and by the addition of> similar and allied forces the two electrodes taken collectively possess a> force 2x in the direction of B. This force 2x, shared by both electrodes,> exists as a tendency of these electrodes to move or accelerate in the> direction of the force, that is, A towards B and B away from A. Moreover any> machine or apparatus possessing electrodes A and B will exhibit such a lateral> acceleration or motion if free to move. [31]> [index_split_075.html#filepos716170] It would be like watching a normal household battery thrust forward once theelectrostatic charge held by the battery became sufficiently large.Dr. Paul LaViolette has described the relevance of the powerful thrustdiscovered in Brown’s experiments with “gravitators,” and how this relates tojet engines and the NASA Space Shuttle: > With each gravitator generating 100 grams of thrust, for a total thrust of 2> newtons, the thrust-to-power ratio of Brown’s electrogravitic thrusters> calculates to 2,000 newtons per kilowatt. This is 130 times the> thrust-to-power ratio of a jet engine, or 10,000 the thrust-to-power ratio of> the space shuttle main engine.[32] [index_split_075.html#filepos716656] If LaViolette is correct, then Brown’s gravitators could be applied to a newgeneration of jet and spacecraft engines, which would far surpass anything thatcould be produced by the more conventional solid state fuel and liquidpropulsion engines used in NASA space shuttles, and more conventional aircraft.There is evidence in the open source literature that as early as the 1950’s,Brown’s gravitator experiments and theories were understood as something thatcould indeed be successfully applied to creating new propulsion systems for theaviation industry. In 1954, the Aviation Report described both the feasibilityand the secrecy surrounding antigravity research at the time: > The basic research and technology behind electro-anti-gravitation is so much> in its infancy that this is perhaps one field of development where not only> the methods but the ideas are secret. Nothing therefore can be discussed> freely at the moment. Very few papers on the subject have been prepared so> far, and the only schemes that have seen the light of day are for pure> research into rigs designed to make objects float around freely in a box.[33]> [index_split_075.html#filepos716918] The Aviation Report went on to describe the need for large laboratories to fullyexplore the potential and practical applications of antigravity research thatrange from new weapons systems to aircraft design: > The prospect of engineers devising gravity-defeating equipment—or perhaps it> should be described as the creation of pockets of weightless environments—> does suggest that as a long term policy aircraft constructors will be required> to place even more emphasis on electro-mechanical industrial plant[s], than is> now required for the transition from manned to unmanned weapons.> Anti-gravitics work is therefore likely to go to companies with the biggest> electrical laboratories and facilities. It is also apparent that> anti-gravitics, like other advanced sciences, will be initially sponsored for> its weapon capabilities. There are perhaps two broad ways of using the> science—one is to postulate the design of advanced type projectiles … the> other, which is a longer term plan, is to create an entirely new environment> with devices operating entirely under an anti-gravitic envelope. [34]> [index_split_075.html#filepos717231] The feasibility of antigravity aircraft was enthusiastically embraced byexecutives from major aerospace companies. George S. Trimble, vice-president ofaviation and advanced propulsion systems for Glenn Martin Aircraft (merged in1995 into the Lockheed Martin Company), told the Associated Press in 1955:“Unlimited power, freedom from gravitational attraction, and infinitely shorttravel time are now becoming feasible.”[35] [index_split_075.html#filepos717544]LaViolette describes more about what Trimble told the Associated Press: > He then added that eventually all commercial air transportation would be in> vehicles operating on these fantastic principles. Recall that Brown had> briefly worked in the Baltimore Glenn Martin plant sixteen years earlier,> before the beginning of World War II. Undoubtedly, he had planted the seeds> about electrogravitics at that early date.[36]> [index_split_075.html#filepos717763] In his book, Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion, LaViolette describes a varietyof aviation companies, journals, and scientists who believed that antigravityresearch was feasible for the aviation industry.[37][index_split_075.html#filepos717949]Brown himself was convinced that his electrogravitics research could be used todevelop a new generation of aircraft that had a distinct saucer shape based onsmaller models he had tested in his laboratory. In January 1953, Brown made anambitious proposal to the U.S. Navy to build electrogravitic powered flyingsaucers: > In an effort to secure government funding, Brown wrote up a proposal in 1952> urging the Navy to initiate a highly secret project to develop a manned flying> saucer as the basis of an interceptor aircraft with mach 3 capability and> proposed that this might follow along the same lines as the Manhattan District> Project … Extrapolating the numbers from the performance charges for Brown’s> laboratory-model flying discs, Project Winterhaven estimated that larger discs> operating at 5 million volts, rather than 50,000 should be able to develop> speeds of 1,150 miles per hour (Mach 1.5) in the presence of atmospheric> resistance and in excess of 1,800 miles per hour (Mach 2.5) in the upper> atmosphere.[38] [index_split_075.html#filepos718138] In July 1957, Brown successfully filed a U.S. patent for his idea of mannedflying saucers powered by an unconventional power source.[39][index_split_075.html#filepos718324]After numerous articles were published in the mid-1950’s about the feasibilityof Brown’s electrogravitics, by the end of the 1950’s it vanished as a seriousconcept being pursued by the aviation industry. Publications by aviationjournals ceased to discuss the topic. According to Nick Cook, veteran writerfor Jane’s Defense Weekly: > By 1960, it was like the whole episode never took place. Aerospace development> continued along its structure ordered pathway and antigravity became one of> those taboo subjects that people like me never, ever talked about.[40]> [index_split_075.html#filepos718514] Electrogravitics had become very highly classified as a number of aviationwriters have pointed out.[41] [index_split_075.html#filepos718684]The activities of Townsend Brown himself became a mystery, and have been thesubject of much controversy. According to LaViolette, Brown’s civilianactivities on antigravity projects became a cover for his classified flyingsaucer research with the U.S. Navy, where he continued to work as a consultant. > Brown was being kept in the loop of the secret aerospace research he had> catalyzed and that the switch to petroelectricity research was primarily a> cover. The public exposure he had received in the past due to media attention> to his electric discs technology would have made him a potential security> threat. Thus it is understandable that when the military began seriously> funding his ideas, the work would have been contracted to a large aerospace> company, with Brown being allowed to consult in private as long as he kept> quiet about his involvement.[42] [index_split_075.html#filepos718871] Nick Cook described a different scenario where Brown was essentially sidelined: > Brown’s work had been rejected by the military, not because it was hokey or> crazy, but because its principles were already known to them—and perhaps,> therefore already the subject of advanced development activity. Had this been> the case, it might well have explained why a few years later, Bell, Conair,> Martin and so many other companies—equally ignorant of this activity—aired> their views on antigravity unchecked for a number of months… until someone,> somewhere ordered them to silence.[43] [index_split_075.html#filepos719061] Both LaViolette’s and Cook’s scenarios agree that the U.S. military was alreadydoing electrogravitics research along the lines of what Brown had proposed in1953 with Project Winterhaven. Brown, likely due to his long work history withthe U.S. Navy, may have been paid off as a consultant; agreeing to be publiclyquiet, but also assisting the Navy’s classified projects while working oncivilian cover programs. Alternatively, Brown was genuinely sidelined by theNavy, and worked on a succession of civilian electrogravitics projects into the1960’s, that proved to be unsuccessful due to lack of military or aviationindustry support.Brown’s unsuccessful electrogravitcs research projects in the civilian sectorcontrasted with another contemporary inventor, Otis Carr. Unlike Brown, Carr hadno association with the U.S. military and was largely unknown. Carr was trulyindependent, and his development of an antigravity device was a security threatthat led to his project being shut down and him being imprisoned on trumped upcharges in 1961. Carr’s pioneering work in developing the first U.S. civilianantigravity spacecraft will be discussed further in chapter 9. "},{"pageContent":"Hybrid Conventional and Electrogravitic Propulsion Aircraft For over three decades since Brown submitted his 1957 patent for a flyingsaucer, the general public knew little about how classified military projectswere incorporating electrogravitics research into large scale aviation projects.Things changed in 1990, a little over a year after Northrop-Grumman’s B-2 Spiritbomber had been unveiled to the world on November 22, 1989.[44][index_split_075.html#filepos719231] Aviation writers began revealing theiranalyses of the B-2 Spirit bomber and wrote articles about its use of classifiedelectrogravitic technologies. Figure 3. B-2 Spirit Bomber[images/00005.jpg] By 1992, it was confirmed that the B-2 Bomber used electrostatic charges on itsleading wings and exhaust. According to LaViolette and aviation experts, thiswas confirmation that the B-2 used electrogravitic principles based on ThomasTownsend Brown’s earlier work: > For many years, rumors circulated that the United States was secretly> developing a highly advanced radar-evading aircraft. Rumor turned to reality> in November 1988, when the U.S. Air Force unveiled the B-2 Advanced Technology> Bomber … [S]everal years later, some key secrets about the B-2 were leaked to> the press. In its March 9, 1992 issue, Aviation Week & Space Technology> magazine made the surprising disclosure that the B-2 electrostatically charges> its exhaust stream and the leading edge of its winglike body. Those familiar> with Brown’s work will quickly realize that his is tantamount to stating that> the B-2 is able to function as an antigravity aircraft.[45]> [index_split_075.html#filepos719637] LaViolette went on to explain that the source of the Aviation Week & SpaceTechnology B-2 story was: > … a small group of renegade West Coast scientists and engineers who were> formerly associated with black research projects…. They took the risk because> they felt that it was important for economic reasons that efforts be made to> declassify certain black technologies for commercial use. Two of these> individuals said that their civil rights had been blatantly abused in the name> of security, either to keep them quiet or to prevent them from leaving the> tightly controlled black R&D community.[46]> [index_split_075.html#filepos719824] The B-2 bomber uses sufficiently high voltages to generate a significant thrust,as predicted by the Biefeld-Brown Effect. This would explain why the B-2bomber’s four conventional jet engines were sufficient, despite the plane’srelatively large weight, which puzzled aviation writers such as Gunston: > Take-off thrust of the [B2 engine] F118-100 at sea level is given as '19,000lb> (84.5kN) class' by Northrop Grumman and as '17,300lb (77.0kN)' by the USAF.> These are startlingly low figures for an aircraft whose take-off weight is> said to be 336,500lb (152,635kg) and which was until recently said to weigh> 376,000lb (170,550kg). Aircraft usually get heavier over the years, not 20> tones [sic] lighter. Even at the supposed reduced weight, the ratio of thrust> to weight is a mere 0.2, an extraordinarily low value for a combat> aircraft.[47] [index_split_075.html#filepos720014] What Gunston is implying here is that “the B2 is seriously underpowered unlessthere is some means of reducing its mass or of increasing its lift beyond thatprovided by conventional aerodynamic means.”[48][index_split_075.html#filepos720364] Some aviation writers pointed to thecomposition of the large B-2 wings as more evidence that electrogravitics wereused in its design: > … its stealth depends on the huge black skin being made of RAM> (radar-absorbent material). This, say the physicists, is 'a high-k,> high-density dielectric ceramic, capable of generating an enormous> electrogravitic lift force when charged'.[49]> [index_split_075.html#filepos720714] The consensus among the writers cited so far is that the B-2 bomber used acombination of conventional jet engines with classified electrograviticstechnologies that effectively increased its overall thrust, thereby generatingthe necessary lift it required.The efforts of the renegade group of West Coast scientists, in releasinginformation about the design of the B-2 bomber, did stimulate some aerospacecompanies to study antigravity technologies. In 2002, an internal Boeing projectcalled “Gravity Research for Advanced Space Propulsion” (GRASP) was disclosed tothe aerospace industry. A GRASP briefing document obtained by Jane’s DefenseWeekly stated Boeing’s position: “If gravity modification is real, it will alterthe entire aerospace business.”[50] [index_split_075.html#filepos721064]According to LaViolette, Boeing completed a separate classified study for theU.S. military of electrogravitic propulsion before October 2007. > In October 2007, I heard from a reliable U.S. government source that Boeing> recently completed a classified electrogravitics propulsion project for the> military that had certain novel features. The technology worked so that they> felt it could be a fantastic benefit if used on their commercial jet> airliners. They reportedly applied for declassification of their invention for> commercial use, but were denied permission.[51]> [index_split_075.html#filepos721465] Boeing was rebuffed in its efforts to have such technology declassified andreleased into the public sector. This suggests that powerful elements of themilitary-industrial complex saw the civilian development of electrograviticaircraft as a national security threat. As will be examined in chapter 9, thisis precisely what happened to Otis Carr in 1961.It is not only the B-2 bomber that aviation experts believe useselectrogravitics in combination with more traditional propulsion systems.According to aviation writer Malcolm Street, in the early 2000’s, the BritishPrime Minister (Tony Blair) and Australia’s Prime Minister (John Howard)attempted to persuade the U.S. government to collaborate in the construction ofthe most advanced versions of the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35), with some of themusing classified electrogravitics technologies: > We know that the JSF/F35 will incorporate a high degree of stealth, like the> B-2, with the degree of stealth apparently varying between inner and outer> customers. However, stealth is relatively old-hat; the F117, the first stealth> aircraft, turns up regularly at air shows, much of the US 70s and 80s stealth> program has been declassified and the general principles, if not specific> applications, of stealth technology are now well-known in the unclassified> world. I can't see it being worth risking the fall of the UK or Australian> governments. So are Howard and Blair playing a very high-stakes game to gain> access to a revolutionary military technology more secret, more important,> than stealth, one that's perhaps being pioneered on the US-only B-2? Like> anti-gravity technology only available to the select inner partners of the> JSF/F35 program? [52] [index_split_075.html#filepos721652] Significantly, Street describes different versions of the JSF/F35 being builtfor “inner and outer customers,” suggesting that some versions would incorporateclassified anti-gravity technologies.According to Street, classified Stealth technologies are used as a highlyeffective cover for hiding the existence of even more highly classifiedelectrogravitics technologies. Street suggests that classified aircraft thatused the “secret” Radar Absorbent Material composed of a “high-densitydielectric ceramic,” had likely included “very secret” electrogravitics intotheir design. > There is a precedent for a radical, cost-is-no-object, highly classified US> military aircraft using two major sets of new technologies, one secret and the> other VERY secret.

By the end of the 1950’s,electrogravitics was no longer part of open source discussions because it hadbecome classified.If Street is correct, then Stealth was a classified technology used as a coverfor the even more highly classified electrogravitics developed in futuregenerations of aircraft, combining traditional propulsion systems withelectrogravitics. This makes a lot of sense from the perspective of the U.S.military that was made aware of the feasibility of electrogravitics and itsrelevance to the aviation industry. The first use of electrogravitics would notoccur with the civilian aviation industry, which aviation visionaries likeTownsend Brown had hoped, but with military aircraft. The incorporation ofelectrogravitics into future generations of military aircraft would be donesecretly, with classified stealth technology being the cover. This now leads tothe question of whether there are hybrid conventional and antigravity spacecraftin use by the U.S. military that make up the secret space program revealed byReagan, which Goode says used “Electrostatic” (aka electrogravitics) and\"Magnetic Gravity Cancellation” technologies. "},{"pageContent":"Hybrid Conventional and Electrogravitic Propulsion Spacecraft—Aurora Program Space is widely viewed to begin at a height of 62 miles (103 km) which is anarbitrary border accepted by many in the aerospace industry.[54][index_split_075.html#filepos722352] This space border height was used by thefirst civilian manned rocket competition into space, the Ansari X-Prize. Thefirst privately funded craft to cross the 62 mile border, Spaceship 1, did so onSeptember 29, 2014 in its effort to win the 10 million dollar prize: > SpaceShipOne was flying with a pilot and the equivalent weight of two> passengers aboard in accordance with rules requiring X Prize contenders to be> capable of carrying three people on a suborbital hop into space.[55]> [index_split_075.html#filepos722771] The Blackbird SR-71 was built by Lockheed Martin and was first deployed by theUSAF in 1964, until 1998. It was capable of flying up to Mach 3.5. While theBlackbird can fly quite high for an aircraft at 88,000 feet (16.7 miles/26.8km), it was well below the border of space. There are claims, however, thatthere are a number of classified military aircraft that can fly above thisarbitrary 62 mile (103 km) space border, that also use hybrid conventionalelectrogravitic propulsion systems. This means that such vehicles can beregarded as hybrid propulsion spacecraft capable of operating both above andbelow the space border.In The Hunt for Zero Point, Jane's Defense Weekly analyst Nick Cook writes aboutthe highly classified Aurora spyplane: \"there has been speculation since thelate 1980’s about the existence of a secret replacement for the Blackbird, amythical plane called the Aurora that supposedly flew twice as fast and on theedges of space.\"[56] [index_split_075.html#filepos723190] Bill Sweetman, anotherprominent aviation technology writer also believes that the Aurora existsdespite official denials by the USAF. He investigated secret aircraft beingbuilt at the Groom Lake aircraft facility in Nevada (aka Area 51) and wrote in2006: > Does Aurora exist? Years of pursuit have led me to believe that, yes, Aurora> is most likely in active development, spurred on by recent advances that have> allowed technology to catch up with the ambition that launched the program a> generation ago.[57] [index_split_075.html#filepos723360] Aviation industry discussion of the Aurora program began in March 1990, due to astory by Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine that revealed: > Aurora was inadvertently released in the 1985 US budget, as an allocation of> $455 Million for Black aircraft PRODUCTION in FY 1987. Note that this was for> building aircraft, not R&D.[58] [index_split_075.html#filepos723790] Aviation Week & Space Technology also revealed: > Project Aurora referred to a group of exotic aircraft, and not to one> particular airframe. Funding of the project allegedly reached $2.3 billion in> fiscal 1987, according to a 1986 procurement document obtained by Aviation> Week.[59] [index_split_075.html#filepos724068] Aside from these brief budgetary references to Project Aurora uncovered byAviation Week and Space Technology, there are no official documents giving anydetails about this Project. To learn more about Project Aurora, we need to turnto whistleblower testimonies about classified aircraft being built at Area 51 toreplace the SR-71 Blackbird.The construction of Area 51 began in 1955 under the authority of the CentralIntelligence Agency, ostensibly for developing a new generation of spy planes incooperation with the U.S. Air Force and corporations such as Lockheed.Facilities were built at two specific locations. The location at Groom Lake wasofficially acknowledged to exist for the first time in August 2013; due to theCIA releasing a document through the Freedom of Information Act. The CIAdocument was released to Jeffrey Richelson, a Senior Fellow at the NationalSecurity Archive, George Washington University, who requested furtherinformation on the history of the U-2 Spy Plane.[60][index_split_075.html#filepos724264]In the document, the CIA acknowledges that Area 51 was chosen due to thesuitability of the Groom Lake dry sand flat for testing secret spy planes. Whatthe CIA document didn’t mention was another dry lake bed nearby, Papoose Lake,which is only 12 miles away. According to whistleblowers, this is the locationof an even more secretive facility called S-4 where even more highly classifiedaerospace projects are tested and developed.[61][index_split_075.html#filepos724621]Edgar Fouche spent 30 years in the aviation industry working with the U.S. AirForce, Department of Defense and various corporations on a number of classifiedmilitary programs. When he decided to write a “fiction based on fact” bookrevealing information about the most advanced aerospace technologies currentlyunder development, he consulted with five close friends who had also worked onclassified aviation projects.[62] [index_split_075.html#filepos725256] The grouppooled their information about the classified projects and technologies theyworked on at a number of military facilities across the country.[63][index_split_075.html#filepos725517] One of the workers had been stationed atArea 51’s Groom Lake facility: > Jerald, was a former NSA or National Security Agency TREAT Team member. TREAT> stands for Tactical Reconnaissance Engineering Assessment Team. He worked for> the DOE or Department of Energy as a National Security Investigator. That was> his cover, but he really worked for the NSA. His job required him to ‘watch> employees’ with Top Secret and \"Q\" clearances at the Nevada Test Site and the> Nellis Range which includes Area 51. Area 51 is where the most classified> aerospace testing in the world takes place. You may know the base as Groom> Lake Air Base, Watertown, the Ranch, or Dream-Land. He was found dead of a> heart attack a year after our last meeting.[64]> [index_split_075.html#filepos725933] Based on what Jared and his other friends had confidentially revealed, Foucheclaims that the Blackbird's replacement was indeed a project called Aurorainvolving “a group of exotic aircraft.” He claims that the Aurora comprises twotypes of hypersonic aircraft used for space flight, and an additional even moreexotic craft. Fouche said: \"The Aurora comprises the SR-75 capable of speedsabove Mach 5, and acts as a mother ship for the SR-74 that can travel at speedsof Mach 18 or more into space to deliver satellites.\"[65][index_split_075.html#filepos726349]This is how Fouche described the SR-75: > The Top Secret SR-75 far exceeds the classified military speed and altitude> records set by the old SR-71, which could fly at a still classified Mach 3.3> and reach a ceiling of 85 thousand feet. The SR-75 attained altitudes of over> 120,000 feet and speeds exceeding Mach-5, or 5 times the speed of sound.> That’s over 3300 miles per hour…. It's 162 feet long and has a wing span of 98> feet. The belly of the vehicle stands 10 feet off the ground. It carries a> crew of 3—a pilot, a reconnaissance officer, and a launch control officer, who> doubles as the electronics warfare officer. Two methane and LOx fueled, high> bypass turbo-ramjet (combined cycle) engines are housed under each wing, and> the bays run some 40 feet under the wings, terminating at the trailing edge of> the wing.[66] [index_split_075.html#filepos726765] Hypersonic aircraft are widely thought to be at the cutting edge of conventionalpropulsion technology. To be classified as hypersonic, an aircraft needs to beable to travel more than five times the speed of sound (Mach 5.1). The SR-75,according to Fouche, is the first operational hypersonic aircraft used by the USAir Force.Fouche further claims that the SR-75 acts as a mothership for the SR-74 (akaScramp), which rides piggyback until launched at a specified altitude of 100,000feet: > It [SR-74] can only launch from the SR-75 mother ship at an altitude above> 100,000 feet, and then it can attain orbital altitudes of well over 800> thousand feet or 151 miles. The Air Force uses the Scramp to launch small,> highly classified, ferret satellites for the National Security Agency. It can> launch at least two 1000 pound satellites measuring 6 feet by 5 feet. The> Scramp is roughly the equivalent size and weight of an F-16 fighter. It can> easily attain speeds of Mach 15, or a little less than 10 thousand miles per> hour.[67] [index_split_075.html#filepos727181] Fouche’s claim that the SR-74 can only launch at a height of 100,000 feetsuggests that it uses scramjets as part of its conventional propulsiontechnology.Officially, the USAF is collaborating with DARPA and the Boeing Corporation indeveloping “scramjet engines” to be used for a new generation of aircraft andweapons. Here is a description of a scramjet that explains its criticalrequirement for air to flow at high speeds for propulsion to occur: > A scramjet (supersonic combusting ramjet) is a variant of a ramjet> airbreathing jet engine in which combustion takes place in supersonic airflow.> As in ramjets, a scramjet relies on high vehicle speed to forcefully compress> the incoming air before combustion (hence ramjet), but a ramjet decelerates> the air to subsonic velocities before combustion, while airflow in a scramjet> is supersonic throughout the entire engine. This allows the scramjet to> operate efficiently at extremely high speeds: theoretical projections place> the top speed of a scramjet between Mach 12 (8,400 mph; 14,000 km/h) and> Mach 24 (16,000 mph; 25,000 km/h).[68] [index_split_075.html#filepos727596] Fouche’s claim, that the SR-74 can reach speeds of Mach 15, is therefore wellwithin official theoretical projections of aircraft using scramjet technology.On June 1, 2015, Mica Endsley, the Chief Scientist with the Air Force ResearchLaboratory, publicly revealed that the USAF plans to build its first hypersonicaircraft by 2023. She said that the planned hypersonic aircraft will build onthe successful May 2013 test flight of Boeing’s X-51 Waverider.[69][index_split_075.html#filepos728041] Of course, if Cook, Sweetman, and Foucheare correct, then the hypersonic aircraft have already been built but are highlyclassified. They are part of the Aurora Project that has developed highperformance aircraft capable of traveling above the 62 mile space border. Whilethe SR-75 is a hypersonic aircraft, it is the SR-74 that is the spacecraftcapable of traveling into low earth orbit to deliver satellites.According to Fouche, the SR-74 and SR-75 have incorporated advanced stealthcapabilities. Once again, this suggests that they likely incorporateelectrogravitics as part of their propulsion system. This would help explain howthe SR-75 could carry the SR-74 piggyback style to an altitude of 100,000 feetand reach the minimum hypersonic speed of Mach 5.1 to launch the SR-74, astheoretically required for it to fly at even faster hypersonic speeds: > A scramjet cannot produce efficient thrust unless boosted to high speed,> around Mach 5, although depending on the design it could act as a ramjet at> low speeds. A horizontal take-off aircraft would need conventional turbofan or> rocket engines to take off, sufficiently large to move a heavy craft. Also> needed would be fuel for those engines, plus all engine-associated mounting> structure and control systems. Turbofan engines are heavy and cannot easily> exceed about Mach 2-3, so another propulsion method would be needed to reach> scramjet operating speed.[70] [index_split_075.html#filepos728471] Electrogravitics would also help explain how the SR-74 could both attain Mach 18speeds and have outer space capability of deploying satellites. Theoreticalknowledge of scramjets reveal that it is necessary for another propulsion system[e.g., electrogravitics] to exist so that a hypersonic craft like the SR-74 cantravel across the space border and enter Earth’s orbit.[71][index_split_075.html#filepos728777] In the case of both the SR-74 and SR-75, wehave examples of high performance hypersonic aircraft that again very likely usea combination of conventional propulsion systems (scramjets for the SR-74) andelectrogravitics. "},{"pageContent":"TR-3B and Magnetic Field Disrupter (Antigravity) Technology According to Fouche, there is a third vehicle belonging to the Aurora Programcalled the TR-3B which was the most highly classified program he and otherworkers at the Groom Lake Area 51 facility were aware of: > The TR-3B is Code named Astra. The tactical reconnaissance TR-3B first> operational flight was in the early 90’s.

The TR-3B flying triangle is not> fiction and was built with technology available in the mid-80’s. [72]> [index_split_075.html#filepos729083] Fouche describes some of the conventional propulsion technologies used by thetriangular shaped TR-3B Astra: > The three multimode rocket engines mounted under each corner of the craft use> hydrogen or methane and oxygen as a propellant. In a liquid oxygen/hydrogen> rocket system, 85% of the propellant mass is oxygen. The nuclear thermal> rocket engine uses a hydrogen propellant, augmented with oxygen for additional> thrust.… What you have to remember is that the 3 rocket engines only have to> propel 11 percent of the mass of the Top Secret TR-3B. The engines are> reportedly built by Rockwell.[73] [index_split_075.html#filepos729499] Fouche further claims that the TR-3B uses a different type of antigravity effectto the electrogravitics systems developed by Townsend Brown. Fouche refers tothis as a “Magnetic Field Disrupter.” According to the Fouche, the MagneticField Disrupter rotates high energy plasma around a circular accelerator ring: > A circular, plasma filled accelerator ring called the Magnetic Field> Disrupter, surrounds the rotatable crew compartment and is far ahead of any> imaginable technology. Sandia and Livermore laboratories developed the reverse> engineered MFD technology. The government will go to any lengths to protect> this technology. The plasma, mercury based, is pressurized at 250,000> atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin and accelerated to 50,000> rpm to create a super-conductive plasma with the resulting gravity> disruption.[74] [index_split_075.html#filepos729915] Fouche explains that the Magnetic Field Disrupter (MFD) technology differs fromelectrogravitics insofar as while the latter provides a thrust, MFD technologyreduces weight. > The MFD generates a magnetic vortex field, which disrupts or neutralizes the> effects of gravity on mass within proximity, by 89 percent. Do not> misunderstand. This is not antigravity. Anti-gravity provides a repulsive> force that can be used for propulsion.[75]> [index_split_075.html#filepos730331] Fouche’s descriptions reveals that the Magnetic Field Disrupter is another namefor the \"Magnetic Gravity Cancellation” technology that Corey Goode said wasused on the secret military shuttle craft that Reagan was likely referring to inhis 1985 Diary entry. Figure 4. Illustration of TR-3B. Source: Edgar Fouche[images/00011.jpg] With the weight of the TR-3B reduced by the MFD technology, this means thatother propulsion systems like conventional jet engines, scramjets and/orelectrogravitics can provide the necessary thrust to make the TR-3B outperformany other aerospace vehicles possessed by the U.S. military: > The MFD creates a disruption of the Earth's gravitational field upon the mass> within the circular accelerator. The mass of the circular accelerator and all> mass within the accelerator, such as the crew capsule, avionics, MFD systems,> fuels, crew environmental systems, and the nuclear reactor, are reduced by> 89%. > This causes the effect of making the vehicle extremely light and able to> outperform and outmaneuver any craft yet constructed—except, of course, those> UFOs we did not build. The TR-3B is a high altitude, stealth, reconnaissance> platform with an indefinite loiter time. Once you get it up there at speed, it> doesn’t take much propulsion to maintain altitude.[76]> [index_split_075.html#filepos730747] Fouche claims that the TR-3B was able to silently hover: > A friend said, he would never forget the sight of the alien looking TR-3B> based at Papoose. The pitch black, triangular shaped TR-3B was rarely> mentioned—and then, only in hushed whispers—at the Groom Lake facility where> he worked. The craft had flown over the Groom Lake runway in complete silence> and magically stopped above Area S-4. It hovered silently in the same> position, for some 10 minutes, before gently settling vertically to the> tarmac. At times a corona of silver blue light glowed around the circumference> of the massive TR-3B. The operational model is 600 feet across.[77]> [index_split_075.html#filepos731163] Fouche’s description of “a corona of silver blue light” that glowed around thehovering TR-3B is a tell-tale sign of it using an electrogravitics and/orMagnetic Field Disrupter technology that generate very high electromagneticfields. Furthermore, his reference to the Papoose Lake facility at Area 51,called S-4, as the place where the TR-3B was based, corroborates what Bob Lazarclaims he experienced when he worked in 1989 on highly classified aerospaceprojects that were developing antigravity technologies.Lazar described in interviews how gravity fields can be artificially generatedin a number of ways, and how this could be applied to spacecraft.[78][index_split_075.html#filepos731579] Lazar’s testimony about projects conductedat S-4, suggests that the TR-3B was developed with antigravity technologies thatwere far more sophisticated than the two other Aurora vehicles (SR-75 and SR-74)based at the adjoining Groom Lake facility.While the SR-75 and SR-74, along with more advanced versions of the B-2, F-117,F-22 and F-35, included electrogravitics to varying degrees for thrust, none hadthe extended hovering ability of the TR-3B. This is likely due to the TR-3Bincluding an antigravity system that reduces weight to a far greater degree thanis possible with electrogravitics, which is primarily a thrusting force. AsFouche described earlier, the Magnetic Field Disruptor can reduce weight by afactor of 89%, thereby allowing a large spacecraft like the TR-3B to hover withthe use of conventional propulsion systems.Evidence for the TR-3B existence comes from the black triangle sightings inBelgium and Britain, lasting from November 29, 1989 to April 1990. Hundreds ofwitnesses including police officers saw and photographed these large flyingtriangles. The sightings were investigated by the Belgium Air Force, whichresulted in a very well documented incident on March 30, 1990. > As the reports began to come in on that March evening in 1990, military> trackers a few miles south of Brussels picked up a large unidentified object> on their radar. Two F-16 fighters were scrambled from Beauvechain, the nearest> airbase, to intercept. They climbed to 3,000 feet and locked on to the craft,> reporting back to base that they had intercepted a \"structured UFO\". But then> suddenly, according to the pilots, it began to behave in an extraordinary way. > Their on-board radar screens registered a quickly changing diamond shape,> which suddenly accelerated to 600mph before slowing just as abruptly to> 170mph. Then it plunged 3,300 feet in two seconds and accelerated from 170mph> to 1,100mph in the same time. There was a marked absence of any sonic boom.> According to the instruments aboard the fighters, the craft pulled away at> 46G—46 times the force of gravity—enough to crush any human body to pulp. It> headed west across the English Channel towards the fields of Kent before> disappearing into the night sky. During their 65 minute observation, the> pilots took 15 photographs. But pursuit in their F-16s, capable of more than> twice the speed of sound, was impossible.[79]> [index_split_075.html#filepos732114] Fouche says that upon examination of Belgium photos of the flying triangle andthe TR-3B design schematics he had witnessed, that they were the one and samecraft: > The original picture of the TR-3B was taken with a digital camera that was> carried onto a black - special operations C-130. An Air Force Special> Operations sergeant took the picture while the C-130 was flying mission> support for the TR-3B. I've seen this picture personally and have interviewed> several people who worked on the program. I'm sure of my facts and> specifications. You can see for yourselves that from the Belgium pictures, the> resulting Computer Composite of the European sightings, and my original> schematic taken from interviews, that this is an accurate rendition of the> TR-3.[80] [index_split_075.html#filepos732465] What is especially relevant is that the reported acceleration of the BelgiumFlying Triangle (TR-3B) according to the F-16 fighter instruments was 46G. Thisis far above the 9G force that what most humans can tolerate for an extendedperiod before blacking out.[81] [index_split_075.html#filepos732880] In the caseof a 16G force this becomes deadly when experienced for a minute or longer.[82][index_split_075.html#filepos733235] In the case of a short duration G-Forces,such as when a fighter jet seat ejects, 32G is considered the safety limit: > Colonel John Paul Stapp of the US Air Force did several experiments, strapping> himself to a rocket sled, and determined that 32 g was an acceleration someone> could walk away from, which then became the acceleration used in the design of> fighter jet seat. [83] [index_split_075.html#filepos733592] The Belgium flying Triangle/TR-3B sighting is powerful evidence that antigravitytechnology, along the lines of Fouche’s Magnetic Field Disruptor technology, wasused to significantly reduce the weight and inertia of the craft and itsoccupants. This explains how the occupants of such a craft could survive suchaccelerations and enormous G forces.According to Fouche’s account, the TR-3B became operational in the early 1990sand three were flying by 1994. This suggests that the 1989/1990 Belgiumsightings were either part of a testing program for earlier prototypes, and/orthe TR-3B had been secretly developed earlier by the Soviet Union or ‘others’.In this regard, Corey Goode provides an answer. He says that the TR-3B was ahand me down to the U.S. military’s space program from an even more highlyclassified space program: > The TR-3B is considered extremely outdated technology and in many cases has> been gifted as “hand me down” craft to “Elites” within the Secret Earth> Governments and their Syndicates as something akin to “Company Jets”. There> are so many newer technologies that are of the same general shape as the TR-3B> (& models that came after) that it would blow people’s minds.[84]> [index_split_075.html#filepos733947] What’s important to keep in mind is that the period Fouche describes for theTR-3B becoming operational is well after Ronald Reagan’s 1985 comments about theU.S. having the capability of flying and hosting 300 astronauts in space orbit.Reagan’s 1985 diary entry alludes to other spacecraft than those examined so farwere used to maintain a secret astronaut corps in Earth’s orbit. While theTR-3B, SR-74 and SR-75 appear to represent state of the art aerospacetechnologies being developed at Area 51’s Groom Lake and Papoose Lakefacilities, these craft were inadequate or developed too late to participate inthe secret space program Reagan was referring to. As Goode suggested in response to Reagan’s 1985 Diary entry, thereare other even more highly classified spacecraft that have been developed inaddition to those hybrid spacecraft built at Area 51 using electrograviticsand/or Magnetic Field Disruptor technologies, along with conventional liquidfuel propulsion systems. The Aurora Project, rather than being the most highlyadvanced aerospace technology in development during the 1990’s at Area 51, asFouche claims, was in fact a cover program for an even more highly classifiedspace program being developed elsewhere.Support for the idea that the U.S. military and intelligence community might usea classified program as a cover for another more highly classified program comesfrom NSA document leaks. On Oct 10, 2014, Peter Maass and Laura Poitras writingfor The Intercept, released powerpoint slides from leaked NSA documentsconcerning highly classified programs that are hidden from public scrutiny.[85][index_split_075.html#filepos734392] The documents, originally leaked by EdwardSnowden, reveal that “Sentry Eagle” is used as an umbrella term for hiding theNSA’s most sensitive programs that are classified “Exceptionally ControlledInformation” (ECI). Several powerpoint slides show how ECI programs are beneathless classified programs as a cover. Figure 5. Leaked slide showing SENTRY EAGLE program where DHS, DoD & NSAclassified programs are hidden within less classified programs. Source: NSA[images/00007.jpg] The role of the CIA in creating and providing security at Area 51 facilitiesconfirms the prominent role of the Intelligence community in aerospace programsunder development and testing. The NSA document reveals that one classifiedaerospace program will be used as a cover for an even more highly classifiedaerospace program. This means, for example, that the first stealth spyplanessuch as the SR-71 Blackbird were used as a cover program for developing moreadvanced hybrid conventional and electrogravitic aircraft. These hybrid aircraftincluded the more advanced versions of the B-2 Spirit Bomber; and possiblyothers, including the F-35 Lightning, tested at Area 51.These hybrid electrogravitic aircraft were themselves used as covers for theeven more highly classified Aurora Project involving three separate hypersoniccraft. The SR-75 and SR-74 were respectively hypersonic aircraft and spacecraft,where the latter could deploy satellites in low earth orbit. The stealthtechnology used for both the SR-74 and SR-75, and their hypersonic performancesuggests they also incorporated electogravitics in hybrid propulsion systems.The Aurora Project also included the most classified aerospace program known toArea 51 workers. The TR-3B used Magnetic Field Disrupter (MFD) antigravitytechnology and was deployed out of the highly secretive S-4 Papoose Lakefacility since the early 1990’s. Yet none of the Aurora Project hypersonic craft(TR-3B and SR-74) were capable of deploying hundreds of astronauts in space asclaimed by President Reagan in 1985. This suggests that the highly classifiedAurora Project was itself a cover program for an even more secretive spaceprogram that was operational by at least 1985, if not earlier.Based on documents and testimony by Goode and other whistleblowers to bepresented, this more secretive space program combines a ‘wingless’ aeronauticaldesign with electrogravitic propulsion, weight-reduction antigravitytechnologies and even more advanced “temporal drive” technologies. The firstdocumented reports of flying saucer or cigar-shaped ‘wingless’ aircraft,date asfar back as 1933. This is more than a decade before the famed 1947 KennethArnold flying saucer sighting or the Roswell flying saucer crash. Thiscorresponds to Goode’s claim that we need to examine the early 1930’s for thegenesis of the five secret space programs that he was aware of during his covertservice from 1987-2007. "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 Origins of the Secret Space Program The first U.S. document that refers to the secret development of flying saucersthat could be part of a secret space program comes from a U.S. Air ForceMemorandum dated, January 3, 1952. The Memorandum, classified Secret, was areport on the wave of flying saucer sightings, which the Air Force called“Unusual Flying Objects,” then occurring in the U.S. The report was fromBrigadier General W.M. Garland to Major General John A. Samford, Air ForceDirector of Intelligence. Garland’s Memorandum stated: > It is logical to relate the reported sightings to the known development of> aircraft, jet propulsion, rockets and range extension capabilities in Germany> and the USSR. In this connection, it is to be noted that certain developments> by the Germans, particularly the Horten wing, jet propulsion, and refueling,> combined with their extensive employment of V-l and V-2 weapons during World> War II, lend credence to the possibility that the flying objects may be of> German and Russian origin. The developments mentioned above were completed and> operational between 1941 and 1944 and subsequently fell into the hands of the> Soviets at the end of the war. There is evidence that the Germans were working> on these projects as far back as 1931 to 1938. Therefore it may be assumed> that the Germans had at least a 7 to 10 year lead over the United States in> the development of rockets, jet engines, and aircraft of the Horton-wing> design.[86] [index_split_075.html#filepos734823] The U.S. Air Force was therefore aware that Nazi Germany had developed advancedaircraft that could perform similarly to the rapidly growing number ofUFO/flying saucer sightings.The first documented UFO sighting was by the pilot Kenneth Arnold, who in June24, 1947, sighted a formation of nine wingless-shaped aircraft that he describedas “saucer-like disks.” Arnold’s description led to widespread usage of the term“flying saucer,” while the Air Force used terms such as “Unusual FlyingObjects,” and “Unidentified Flying Objects.” Arnold wrote a report to the US Army Air Forces (soon to become the USAF) wherehe gave a detailed description: > The sky and air was clear as crystal. I hadn't flown more than two or three> minutes on my course when a bright flash reflected on my airplane. It startled> me as I thought I was too close to some other aircraft.

[87]> [index_split_075.html#filepos735275] So far, Arnold’s sighting has a similarity to the single wing design of a jetbomber designed by the Horton Brothers that also did not have a tail. TheHortons’ had designed and successfully tested their single wing craft, calledthe HO-229, on March 1, 1944 in Nazi Germany which is referred to in Garland’sMemorandum. The single wing craft was the HO -229 and it flew for the first timein 1944. Figure 6. Horton HO-229[images/00008.jpg] Yet Arnold was clear that these objects had a “saucer shape”, rather than flyingwing shape. > As I was flying in the direction of this particular ridge, I measured it and> found it to be approximately five miles so I could safely assume that the> chain of these saucer like objects were at least five miles long.

KennethArnold's illustration of what he saw[images/00025.jpg]Arnold went on to describe how similar saucer-shaped objects had been sightedall over the world: > Some descriptions could not be very accurate taken from the ground unless> these saucer-like disks were at a great height and there is a possibility that> all of the people who observed peculiar objects could have seen the same thing> I did…. I have in my possession letters from all over the Unites States and> people who profess that these objects have been observed over other portions> of the world.[89] [index_split_075.html#filepos735875] Many reports of “flying saucers” describe them as capable of flying high intothe Earth’s atmosphere and into outer space.Probably the most famous flying saucer incident involved the January 7, 1948Captain Thomas Mantell case; when he pursued a rotating saucer shaped object asit flew off high into the Earth’s atmosphere and disappeared from sight. Anobserver at Lockbourne Army Air Field in Ohio reported what happened: > Just before leaving it came to very near the ground, staying down for about> ten seconds, then climbed at a very fast rate back to its original altitude,> 10,000 feet, leveling off and disappearing into the overcast heading 120> degrees.[90] [index_split_075.html#filepos736175] According to the official report, Mantell flew too high in his pursuit, andwithout an oxygen mask blacked out and crashed.The capability of flying saucers to come to a stop, hover, accelerate totremendous speeds, and fly high into the atmosphere and through outer space ledto the widespread belief that flying saucers did not belong to any secretmilitary program, and were extraterrestrial in origin.The January 3, 1952 Air Force Memorandum was suggesting another, veryterrestrial, explanation for advanced “saucer-like” aircraft capable of suchmaneuvers and leaving the Earth’s atmosphere. The sightings may be related toadvanced aircraft projects secretly completed and deployed by the Nazis between1941 and 1944. Yet the Garland Memorandum says that the development of advancedaircraft capable of performing like the “saucer-like disks” observed by Arnoldand others, began as early as 1931. This was two years before the rise ofHitler’s Nazi regime and the S.S. that would later play a key role in a secretNazi flying saucer program. Who in 1931 had the resources, knowledge and skillto study and build flying saucer prototypes in pre-Nazi Germany? "},{"pageContent":"Professor Schumann & Germany’s First Flying Saucer Prototypes In 1912, Winfried Otto Schumann had completed his doctorate with a thesis onhigh-voltage technology.[91] [index_split_075.html#filepos736563] Hesubsequently worked at the High Voltage Laboratory at the Bown, Boveri and CieCompany up to the start of World War I. In 1920, he qualified as a professor atthe Technical University of Stuttgart where he was working as a researchassistant. Soon after, he was offered a professorship at the University of Jenawhere he remained until 1924. He then accepted a full professorship at theTechnical University of Munich as director of the Electrophysical Laboratory,where he remained until his 1961 retirement. The Laboratory was later upgradedto the Electrophysical Institute.Schumann’s work at the Electrophysical Laboratory in Munich is summed up asfollows: > While during his industrial activity he had dealt primarily with the> disruptive field strength of gases, liquids and solid states, during his time> in Munich his interest extended to high-frequency technology and plasma> physics. In a series of very noteworthy publications, Schumann worked on the> behavior of the ionosphere and plasma experiments in the laboratory under> similar conditions.[92] [index_split_075.html#filepos737045] As early as 1931, Schumann’s position as director of the ElectrophysicalLaboratory and expertise would make him the ideal person to lead a privatelyfunded civilian effort to build a flying saucer, based on principles of highvoltage electrostatics and high frequency rotating plasma. In chapter one, itwas shown that high voltage electrostatic charges produce a propulsive thrustthat can and has been used to produce classified hybrid propulsion aircraft likethe B-2 Spirit Bomber. It was also shown that high energy mercury based plasmarotating at 50,000 rpm in a highly pressured ring can reduce the weight of allwithin the rotating plasma’s circumference by up to 89%. It was claimed thatthese principles are used in the Magnetic Field Disrupter (aka Magnetic GravityCancellation technology described by Corey Goode) that were incorporated intothe highly classified TR-3B, according to Edgar Fouche.Confirmation of Schumann’s unique skills and their relevance to advancedaviation projects and flying saucers comes from what occurred shortly after theSecond World War. Schumann was brought to the United States under OperationPaperclip, a highly classified program that recruited former Nazi scientists tokickstart the U.S. advanced aerospace and rocket industries. Documents releasedunder the Freedom of Information Act confirm Schumann was on a list of GermanScientists requested by the Army Air Force with skills relevant to itsclassified projects.[93] [index_split_075.html#filepos737234]From 1947-1948, Schumann worked at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, onclassified projects associated with his area of expertise; large scaleelectromagnetic charges and advanced aviation projects conducted by the AirForce, concerning retrieved Nazi vehicles and other craft. As the GarlandMemorandum suggested, former Nazi aviation projects were known to be a possiblelink to explain the flying saucer phenomenon.Later, in the 1950’s, Schumann became widely known for his work in measuring theSchumann Resonance, which relates to standing electromagnetic waves that arecreated in the cavity between the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere bylightning storms. NASA describes the role of Schumann in detecting the uniqueproperties of the Earth’s cavity and its current importance to the U.S. Navy: Figure 8. Schumann's name appears on Operation Paperclip Document[images/00021.jpg] > The resonant properties of this terrestrial cavity were first predicted by the> German physicist W. O. Schumann between 1952 and 1957, and first detected by> Schumann and Konig in 1954. The first spectral representation of this> phenomenon was prepared by Balser and Wagner in 1960. Much of the research in> the last 20 years has been conducted by the Department of the Navy who> investigate Extremely Low Frequency communication with submarines.[94]> [index_split_075.html#filepos737781] While Schumann’s work on measuring the behavior of the electromagnetic waves inthe Earth’s atmosphere is well known, his earlier work at the ElectrophysicalLaboratory and at Wright Patterson AFB is not. Supporting documentation forthese periods of his research is not publicly available; at least as far asonline internet sources.This is perhaps not so surprising given Schumann’s recruitment into highlyclassified programs being conducted by Operation Paperclip scientists.Schumann’s work at Wright Patterson AFB almost certainly was related to hisspecialty of large scale electrical charges and plasma physics, and how theseapplied to the exotic propulsion technologies used in advanced Nazi aviationprojects, and the flying saucer phenomenon.It is certain that Schumann would have been very familiar with the Biefeld-BrownEffect, and how large electrostatic charges could provide a means of propulsionfor the development of antigravity vehicles. Also, his expertise with highenergy plasma physics suggests that he also would have been familiar withprinciples concerning the antigravity effects of rotating high energy plasma.Schumann’s classified work at Wright Patterson very likely concerned a detailedstudy of the Biefeld-Brown Effect and measuring how it applied to highlyclassified aircraft recovered from Nazi Germany, as well as spacecraft usingantigravity propulsion technologies. It is likely his work also included thestudy of ideas associated with rotating plasma and its weight reduction effectsused in the Magnetic Field Disrupter/ Magnetic Gravity Cancellation technologydescribed by Fouche and Goode.Very possibly the Garland Memorandum’s reference to 1931 is the start of theflying saucer phenomenon in German aviation, and referred to flying saucertechnologies developed or studied at Schumann’s Electrophysics Laboratory at theMunich Technical University. Dan Morris, who claims to have worked with theNational Reconnaissance Office, has stated that he saw documents describingrecovered flying saucers in 1931: > Germany recovered two UFOs before—it was 1931, 1932—and they took them to> Germany and started—like we do now—re-engineering. They got ahead and even> before the war started, they had a workable UFO. It was called by them—now I> can’t pronounce it exactly like a Germany would—but it’s “Hun-dee-doo”> [phonetic] One and Two. The Two was the one you see about thirty or forty feet> across, with the three balls hanging down, that go up and down when they’re> bouncing.[95] [index_split_075.html#filepos738111] Morris is undoubtedly referring to the famed “Hanebu” flying saucers; claimed tohave been developed later and successfully tested in Nazi Germany. Yet, 1931 wastwo years before Hitler came to power. If flying saucers had crashed in 1931 and1932, there are two likely explanations for their origin. First, these wereearly prototypes being developed by a privately funded organization in Germany.Second, these craft were otherworldly in origin. Dr. Schumann would have beenamong the most qualified German scientists to be involved in the study of flyingsaucer shaped crafts that were either being developed or being retrieved. Thisraises the questions: where did Schumann get the idea to build flying saucerprototypes, and where did the crashed flying saucers originate? "},{"pageContent":"The Vril Society’s Secret Space Program There are a number of sources suggesting Schumann’s work on flying saucers beganin the early 1920’s as a result of his close collaboration with Maria Orsic,founder of the Vril Society. A former CIA agent who used pseudonyms such as‘Stein’, ‘Kewper’ and ‘anonymous’ came forward to reveal that he “sawinformation that some Vril craft went back to the early 1920’s!”[96][index_split_075.html#filepos738395]He was first interviewed by veteran UFO researcher Linda Moulton Howe in 1998,and used the ‘Stein‘ and ‘Kewper’ pseudonyms. After taping a series ofinterviews with her, he was eventually threatened by an unknown governmentagency, and withdrew from the public arena until returning in 2013. Stein/Kewperwas now age 77 and suffering from acute kidney problems. He allegedly only had afew months to live. Stein/Kewper, now using the pseudonym ‘anonymous’, consentedto be interviewed by UFO historian, Richard Dolan, who released his videotestimony at the 2013 Citizen’s Hearing on Disclosure that was presided over bysix former U.S. Members of Congress.[97] [index_split_075.html#filepos738796]Dolan, Howe and the Citizen’s Hearing event organizers were convinced thatStein/Kewper was a credible eyewitness to the events he disclosed.Prior to his CIA recruitment in 1958, Stein/Kewper had completed training at theUS Army Signal Training Center and began working as an Army cryptologist.Stein/Kewper’s first assignment was to examine files on UFOs andextraterrestrial life submitted from the USAF base at Fort Belvoir. The fileswere different to the Project Blue Book files studied at Wright-Patterson AirForce Base, which were eventually released to the general public.Stein/Kewper says that during a tour of the highly classified S-4 facility atArea 51 in 1958, where he was accompanied by his CIA superior and three otherCIA agents, he saw four Nazi flying saucer saucers, two of which were Vrilcraft: > At Area 51, the first two craft we saw looked almost identical. They were> smaller, not nearly as big as one in the back. Col. Jim mentioned that those> two were ‘Vril craft.’ We asked him what ‘Vril’ was. The Col. said it was a> foreign saucer built in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s.[98]> [index_split_075.html#filepos739351] This is consistent with Goode’s claim that the first flying saucer prototypeswere developed by Maria Orsic and the Vril Society, according to briefings heread during his covert space program service.[99][index_split_075.html#filepos739752]Information about the Vril Society and Orsic is shrouded in mystery. Nodocuments exist to confirm Orsic’s public activities, especially when it comesto the Vril Society that she allegedly started in 1919. What is known aboutOrsic and the Vril society is undocumented and subject to much controversy.This is quite puzzling. It’s as though documentary information about Orsic, theVril Society, and the involvement of Schumann, has been deliberately swept awayfrom the historical database. This is understandable if Goode and other sourcesare correct in stating that the Vril Society and Orsic successfully acquiredtheir flying saucer designs from communications with beings claiming to beextraterrestrials from Aldebaran. If this is true, it would certainly explainwhy such information would be closely guarded by secret societies in Germany andelsewhere, and later become highly classified by the U.S. and other nationalgovernments.There are a number of reasons that can help explain the secrecy about the VrilSociety’s flying saucer program.[100] [index_split_075.html#filepos740265]First, Orsic was allegedly concerned that such information could be used forbuilding advanced weapons of war by major nations, and would only share it withthe right people. Second, collaborators such as Dr. Schumann would have beenconcerned about their reputations. They would not have wanted it known that theywere using significant resources in an attempt to develop craft from mysticallyderived information. Third, unlike Orsic, the Nazi SS highly prized esotericinformation that could lead to the development of super weapons for war.Finally, the victorious allied powers wanted to ensure that the full extent ofHitler’s flying saucer projects and weapons were kept secret. Figure 9. Maria Orsic. Source: Unknown[images/00038.jpg] What follows is information about the Vril Society, Orsic, and the involvementof Schumann that draws on a number of available sources alleging to havewitnessed documents, or received briefings about the former. While these sourcesare undocumented, they reveal intriguing details of what very possibly was thefirst secret space program of the modern era. These sources help corroborateGoode’s own information about Orsic and the Vril Society’s secret flying saucerprogram. "},{"pageContent":"Secret Societies in Germany: Vril, Thule and Black Sun There is considerable controversy over the creation date of the Vril society andwhether it even existed at all due to a lack of public documents. However, thereis much anecdotal information about its creation and activities. These anecdotalsources claim it was created sometime in 1919, as an offshoot of a largermetaphysical society led by wealthy German aristocrats called the Thule Society(Thule-Gesellshaft).The Thule Society was formed on August 17, 1918 in Munich by Baron Rudolf vonSebottendorf as an offshoot of the Germanenorder (the Order of the Teutons),earlier formed in 1912.[101] [index_split_075.html#filepos740648] The ThuleSociety is best known as the organization that sponsored the creation of theGerman Worker’s Party (Deutsche Arbeiterparte), which was formed in January 5,1919 in Munich. Adolph Hitler became its 55th member, and the 7th member of itsexecutive committee due to his oratory skills. The German Worker’s Party wasrenamed the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP or Nazi Party) onFebruary 24, 1920.[102] [index_split_075.html#filepos740963]Thule Society leaders believed they could control the new Worker’s Party frombehind the scenes by creating a German nation based on metaphysical principles,out of the ashes of World War I. The emblem of the Thule Society was a versionof the Swastika that was eventually adopted later by Hitler and the Nazi Party.Among the Thule Society members that rose to prominent Nazi Party positions wasRudolph Hess, who became Deputy Fuhrer in 1933, and remained in this positionuntil 1941 when he mysteriously flew to Great Britain on a failed peacemission.[103] [index_split_075.html#filepos741309] Figure 10. Thule and Nazi Symbols[images/00028.jpg] The Thule Society believed in the existence of an advanced far northern(subterranean) civilization called Hyperborea; described in Greek and Romanlegends, whose ancient capital was “Ultima Thule.” Thule Society membersbelieved that the Hyerboreans were the racial progenitors of the Aryan race. TheHyperboreans could harness “Vril” energy essential for the use of futuristictechnologies that were originally created by ancient civilizations. ThuleSociety members believed that these advanced technologies were hidden in variouslocations around the world. More than a decade later, the Nazi SS wouldincorporate these Thule Society beliefs, using a specialist education departmentcalled the SS Ahnenerbe [German for “inherited from the forefathers”] created in1935.[104] [index_split_075.html#filepos741619] The SS Ahnenerbe sponsoredexpeditions to remote locations in Tibet, Peru, and elsewhere seekingmanuscripts with information about the roots of the Aryan race, and thetechnologies used by ancient civilizations.Thule Society leaders enthusiastically supported the study of EdwardBulwer-Lytton’s 1871 novel, Vril, the Power of the Coming Race, which showed howthe future of humanity would be determined by those best able to understand anduse the Vril force.[105] [index_split_075.html#filepos741976] Vril, The ComingRace was also endorsed by leading Western metaphysical leaders such as HelenaBlavatsky, head of the Theosophical Society, that was formed in 1875 in New YorkCity.[106] [index_split_075.html#filepos742449]The following plot summary encapsulates the belief, held by Thule Societyleaders and future Nazi SS officials, about the potency of the Vril force. > The novel centers on a young, independently wealthy traveler (the narrator),> who accidentally finds his way into a subterranean world occupied by beings> who seem to resemble angels and call themselves Vril-ya. The hero soon> discovers that the Vril-ya are descendants of an antediluvian civilization who> live in networks of subterranean caverns linked by tunnels. It is a> technologically supported Utopia, chief among their tools being the> \"all-permeating fluid\" called \"Vril\", a latent source of energy that its> spiritually elevated hosts are able to master through training of their will,> to a degree which depends upon their hereditary constitution, giving them> access to an extraordinary force that can be controlled at will. The powers of> the will include the ability to heal, change, and destroy beings and things;> the destructive powers in particular are awesomely powerful, allowing a few> young Vril-ya children to wipe out entire cities if necessary. It is also> suggested that the Vril-ya are fully telepathic.[107]> [index_split_075.html#filepos742810] It is important to recognize that Bulwer-Lytton emphasized telepathy as a keycommunication mode used by the Vril-ya. Telepathy was something that Westernmetaphysical leaders such as Blavatsky believed was a sign of the necessaryhigher intelligence needed to understand and harness the Vril force.Consequently, the Thule Society would give serious attention to investigatingthe claims of any who demonstrated undisputed telepathic abilities.It is alleged that Orsic had earlier met with Sebottendorf and three other ThuleSociety members in Vienna in 1917; to discuss occult matters associated with hertelepathic communications.[108] [index_split_075.html#filepos743099]Consequently, Thule Society leaders were aware of the remarkable telepathicabilities of Orsic, who could enter into a full trance state and was able tocommunicate with a range of other worldly beings.Orsic moved to Munich in 1919 and made contact with Sebottendorf and the ThuleSociety. Thule Society leaders believed Orsic, and others like her, would haveimportant clues for understanding and using the Vril force. Theyenthusiastically supported Orsic and the group of young ladies she formed aroundherself in Munich who were also psychically gifted. This is the period whenOrsic allegedly created the “Alldeutsche Gesellschaft für Metaphysik”(Pan-German Society for Metaphysics) that was later renamed the Vril-Society(Society of Vrilerinnen Women).[109] [index_split_075.html#filepos743385]Another name change apparently occurred in 1941 when Hitler outlawed secretsocieties. Orsic registered the society as a business, named \"AntriebstechnischeWerkstätten\" (Vril propulsion workshops).[110][index_split_075.html#filepos743671] These psychically gifted ladies dedicatedthemselves to developing techniques for communicating with other worldly beings,and learning to harness the Vril force.Sometime in 1919, Orsic began channeling beings who claimed to beextraterrestrials from the Aldebaran star system. Using automatic writing, shewrote numerous pages of what appeared to be technical information in two foreignlanguages, one of which she did not recognize. Another prominent psychic,“Sigrun”, assisted in understanding the content of the writing by getting clearmental images of a flying saucer craft. Orsic and Sigrun believed theinformation revealed how to build a spacecraft.Later in 1919, Orsic and Sigrun met with members from the Thule Society, whowere able to determine that one of the two languages in the automatic writingwas actually ancient Sumerian. Experts were brought in to translate Orsic’sautomatic writing. The translation confirmed Sigrun’s mental images, it wastechnical instructions for building a revolutionary type of engine that couldpower a spacecraft. Orsic and supportive Thule society members arranged forvarious scientists to look at the translated information and determine whetherit was scientifically feasible.[111] [index_split_075.html#filepos743957]It is claimed that Dr. Winfried Schumann studied Orsic’s information, andbelieved it was scientifically feasible. Schumann and Orsic allegedly beganmeeting to discuss various issues associated with the construction of the craft.According to researcher Rob Arndt, the first attempt to build a flying saucerprototype occurred during the period 1922-24.[112][index_split_075.html#filepos744213] What is significant here is that in 1924,Schumann began his professorship at the Technical University of Munich, andheaded the Electrophysics Laboratory.With private funding from Thule Society members, Schumann could have easilyattempted to build a prototype from the designs Orsic provided him, without anyrisk to his career or reputation. After all, his expertise was at the leadingedge of high voltage electrostatics and plasma physics. Building prototypesbased on Orsic’s designs would have provided much information about thepractical application of high voltage electrostatics and plasma physics.It is claimed that Orsic channeled more information from the Aldebarans, whopassed on additional information about the spacecraft itself. Schumann then puttogether a proposal for funding the building of the first flying saucer, a“Jenseitsflugmaschine” [“Other-World Flight Machine”]: > It took Dr. Schumann two months to create a concise scientific dossier, and> almost 5 months to get the financing, even though members of Thule and DHvSS> were wealthy and affluent…[113] [index_split_075.html#filepos744560] Schumann was allegedly familiar with the theory of Viktor Schauberger, whopioneered the idea of implosion as a fundamental natural process of energytransference—as opposed to the principle of explosion. While the implosionprinciple was in alignment with nature, explosion was unnatural. It was thoughtthat by using the principle of implosion, gravity defying effects could beproduced, along with new forms of energy. In a detailed biography, Schauberger’sideas were confirmed to be a part of various flying saucer and over-unity (freeenergy) projects he worked on during his life.[114][index_split_075.html#filepos744827]Schumann shared in Schauberger’s view according to alleged SS files discoveredafter World War II: > In everything we recognize two principles that determine the events; light and> darkness, good and evil, creation and destruction—as in electricity we know> plus and minus. It is always; either–or. These two principles—the creative and> destructive—also determine our technical means… Everything destructive is of> Satanic origin, everything creative is divine… Every technology based on> explosion or combustion has thus to be called Satanic. The coming new age will> be an age of new, positive, divine technology.[115]> [index_split_075.html#filepos745058] According to sources cited by covert programs researcher Peter Moon, the VrilSociety placed ads to attract funding for its flying saucer project: > The Vril Society did not get the funding it needed even though German> newspapers ran advertisements designed to raise money for Vril aircraft. The> ads blatantly stated that they were attempting to utilize ancient Atlantean> technolology, not an unpopular foreign concept to the Germans of the> 1920s.[116] [index_split_075.html#filepos745277] The first flying saucer models were apparent failures. Continued collaborationbetween Schumann and Orsic in the years ahead allegedly led to working flyingsaucer prototypes. According to Moon, the first successful prototype wasproduced in 1934: > Two special departments were set up to concentrate on the development of this> new flying technology of the Vril Society: U-13 and the SS-E-4. The latter was> under the direct supervision of Heinrich Himmler and was known as development> group number four of the Black Sun [a secret society comprising Nazi SS> elite]. The main focus of SS-E was based upon the work of Viktor> Schauberger.[117] [index_split_075.html#filepos745480] This is where the date of 1931 becomes relevant. As described earlier, theGeneral Garland Memorandum refers to 1931 as the time when advanced aeronauticalprojects began in Germany that were later pursued by the Nazi government.Similarly, Dan Morris refers to two UFO/flying saucer recoveries in 1931 and1932. A plausible explanation is that these were prototypes being developed bySchumann. Certainly his scientific expertise and subsequent work with OperationPaperclip at Wright Patterson AFB made him eminently qualified for such anundertaking. Most relevant here is asking what precise role did Orsic and theVril Society play in the flying saucer research very likely undertaken bySchumann in the 1920’s and 1930’s?According to sources examined so far, Orsic and the Vril society began researchto build on a flying saucer in the 1920’s, based on channeled informationreceived from an alleged extraterrestrial race based in the Aldebaran starsystem. This led to the creation of a secret space program initially funded bythe Thule Society that involved Professor Schumann as early as 1924. Schumann’sexpertise and position as the head of the Electrophysics Laboratory at theTechnical University of Munich would have certainly made it possible forbuilding Vril prototype flying saucers in secrecy. According to Stein/Kewper’stestimony, Vril prototypes were indeed successfully developed and laterrepatriated under Operation Paperclip, for eventual study at the S-4 facility atArea 51. "},{"pageContent":"Corey Goode on the Vril Society’s Secret Space Program What has been revealed about the Vril Society’s secret space program isconsistent with the information Corey Goode claims to have read in classifiedbriefing documents about the Vril, Thule and “Black Sun” societies. Goode saysthat the beings Orsic was in psychic communications with were in fact an ancienthuman breakaway civilization, pretending to be extraterrestrials from theAldebaran star system: > The Vril, Thule, Black Sun Societies … were involved in several parallel> programs to develop advanced technology. They had channeled information that> had sent them on a path to reverse engineer ancient documents from the East,> which led them to build very similar craft to the Ancient Break Away Earth> Human Civilizations that convinced them that they were ET’s from another star> system.

They sometimes looked slightly different from us, but were very> much our genetic forefathers.[118] [index_split_075.html#filepos745683] Goode emphasized how these occult societies fervently believed in the mystical‘Vril’ energy that was a prominent part in the development of the first Germanflying saucer programs: > The Vril, Thule and Black Sun orders were all involved in these [secret space]> programs. They had overlapping ideologies and agenda’s. Much of the Star Wars> ideology of “The Force” and “Dark Lord Siths” and their “Masters” and The> Power of the Dark Side, Dark Energy and Dark Star Energy was a mixture of> science and religion to them. [119] [index_split_075.html#filepos746197] Goode describes how the German occult societies were able to maintain theirindependence and operations despite the later efforts of the Nazi war machine tosubsume these: > The German Occultists were very busy from the early 1900’s, especially the> time just before, during and after World War I. Their major breakthrough’s> occurred in the late 1930’s, and these Secret Societies had already begun> their own mini-break away civilization that was kept from the German War> Machine and Leadership. [120] [index_split_075.html#filepos746711] As far as Orsic is concerned, Goode said that she survived the Second World Warand travelled to secret locations where the Nazi elite escaped in flyingsaucers. After the War, Orsic pretended to be from an extraterrestrialcivilization when landing in a flying saucer and speaking with some of the earlycontactees: > Many in the Intel Community became quite convinced that Maria Orsic was one of> the “Blondes” that would land in UFO’s and talk to people in German,> pretending to be an ET from another star system. When some of the witnesses> were shown her photo they identified her as the same person that they had met> from the Flying Saucer.[121] [index_split_075.html#filepos747225] As mentioned earlier, the former CIA agent who used the pseudonyms ‘Stein’ and‘Kewper’ in interviews with Linda Moulton Howe, said he also saw documentsdetailing the involvement of the Vril Society in Nazi Germany’s efforts to buildspacecraft. He revealed the content of one file that discussed Vril technologiesand the relationship with extraterrestrial life: > It did say there were mediums who had contacted aliens and there were messages> from aliens about how to build the levitation device for the> anti-gravitational engine.[122] [index_split_075.html#filepos747739] Stein/Kewper’s testimony supports Goode’s claim that he witnessed classifieddocuments describing Orsic’s involvement with the first flying saucerprototypes, developed by the Vril and Thule societies as derived throughcommunications with an extraterrestrial race. It is highly likely then, thatthroughout the 1920’s into the early 1930’s, Schumann was working on flyingsaucer prototypes as practical applications of high voltage electrostatics andplasma physics. But it was only in the late 1930’s, when success was finallyachieved for the Vril Society’s secret space program. Goode claimed thatelectrostatics and Mercury based plasma, both of which Schumann specialized in,were used for the propulsion systems of the Vril craft: “The first craft theybuilt used Mercury turbines, and electro-gravity engines were developed.”[123][index_split_075.html#filepos748142]By 1931, it is likely that Schumann had developed the first flying saucerprototypes that are alluded to in the Garland Memorandum. The UFO/flying saucercrashes that allegedly occurred in 1931 and 1932, according to Dan Morris’testimony, were possibly unsuccessful test flights. These documents and eventsare consistent with Goode’s version of the history of Vril spacecraft and thetechnologies that were used to develop them.In 1931, Germany’s Weimar Republic was still in power but was in the midst of aworld-wide economic recession caused by the U.S. Great Depression. The WeimarRepublic was politically and militarily weak, and war reparations meant that itseconomic challenges were far greater than other European nations also strugglingwith the Great Depression. Yet, Germany was a democratic nation with muchscientific genius and wealthy landowners willing to support visionary projectsto restore Germany’s greatness. Weimar Germany was the ideal place for thedevelopment of a secret civilian led space program that would propel humanity tothe stars. Professor Schumann provided the scientific expertise, while secretsocieties such as the Vril and Thule societies facilitated the necessary fundingfor the construction of flying saucer prototypes.In January 1933, however, an ominous dark cloud began moving over the WeimarRepublic. Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany and his Nazi Partybegan violently expanding its influence over all facets of German society.Perhaps reflecting the ominous dark cloud, documents reveal that a flying saucerhad crashed and been recovered by government officials in nearby Italy in June1933. Was the crash one of the flying saucer prototypes built by Schumann? Ifso, Fascist Italy would not take long in finding out the truth behind theincident, and begin studying the design of flying saucers themselves to startits own official flying saucer program, using innovative antigravity principles. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter3 Secret Deals: Nazi & Fascist Flying Saucer Weapons Programs The first documented study of an advanced flying saucer craft can be traced toFascist Italy. On June 13, 1933, Benito Mussolini came into the possession of aUFO that had an unknown flying saucer design and origin. As one of the world’sleading aeronautical nations, Fascist Italy was in a position to begin acomprehensive study of advanced technologies that would ultimately transform theaviation industry.Fourteen years before the famed Roswell flying saucer crash was announced to theworld in July 1947, Fascist era documents reveal Italy had highly advancedaviation technology in it’s possession from an unknown source that was destinedto change the global balance of power. The question was who would Italy shareits incredible discovery with? Would it be its British and American allies fromWorld War I, or the newly installed Nazi regime in Germany headed by AdolfHitler? Which of the major powers would Mussolini work with to study theretrieved flying saucer? Perhaps, more importantly, was which one of theseforeign nations was secretly developing such unconventional aircraft? Mussoliniwould use his intelligence networks to find out who, and begin cooperating withthem to best understand and develop such technologies.In the late 1990’s, 18 documents were leaked to researchers dating from the1930’s, from Fascist Italy, dealing with UFOs.[124][index_split_075.html#filepos748824] The files were allegedly official documentsleaked by someone who had inherited them from a former top level insider in theItalian Intelligence community. Unlike the U.S. Majestic files that are copiesof allegedly leaked official UFO documents, the Italian documents wereoriginals. This allowed forensic analysis to determine their age andauthenticity. After forensic analysis was completed and dismissed thepossibility that they were modern forgeries; Italian researchers released thedocuments and their findings. Among the files were documents mentioning a 1933UFO crash in the Lombardy region involving a highly advanced craft thatresembled a flying saucer. A top secret organization was created to study thecaptured craft, along with the growing number of flying saucer sightings.One of the key Italian researchers involved in studying the Italian Majesticdocuments is Alfredo Lissini. Here is his description of the 1933 crash: > June 13, 1933. A circular craft resembling a pair of saucers joined at their> outer rims crashes near the town of Maderno, in Lombardy, northern Italy. The> object, made of thin, silvery-grey metal, is about fifty feet in diameter and> less than seven feet thick. Dorsal twin-booms or antenna-like features face in> opposite directions from a delta-shaped configuration enclosed by a> transparent blister. Two tubes are coupled where the design slopes upward from> a flat underside, itself slung with two more pairs of oblong details. Eleven> portholes run in a straight line on either side of the crafts upper half.> Another eight appear on its lower portion, again on both sides, but are> interrupted in the center of their line on one side by a trio of oval windows> in what appears to be a rectangular hatch. An additional six, smaller, ovoid> windows or lights are positioned at either end of the craft, which suffers> extensive damage in the crash. No occupants in the object were found.[125]> [index_split_075.html#filepos749363] Figure 11. Fascist era document depicts crashed UFO[images/00036.jpg] Lissioni went on to describe the top secret organization created to study theretrieved UFO: > Il Duce created. RS/33 Cabinet (“Research-Espionage/ 1933”), it is> headquartered at Rome’s prestigious La Spezia University, the first MJ-12 set> up to study the crashed UFO situation in Italy, it was headed by Marconi. > “Among its members … the Cabinet had many of the most highly respected of> Italian academics, members of the Royal Italian Academy of Sciences,”> including the renowned Turin astronomer, Gino Cecchini. Marconi’s political> assistant. To ensure censorship and promote public disinformation they used> master spy, Tommaso David, code-named “De Santi,” one of Italy's leading> spies, [126] [index_split_075.html#filepos749851] The leaked documents described how the flying saucer discovery would be studiedsecretly, and the process by which the public would be misled about what hadhappened. > There was also a Senatorial letter describing in detail the strategy to be> followed after the craft had been recovered which included censorship of the> newspapers, arrest of the eyewitnesses by the O.U.R.A. (The Italian> Government's Political Police), elaboration of a series of conventional> explanations for the disc (balloons, meteors, weather phenomenon) to be fed to> the public via the Breara Astronomical Observatory at Milan, and notification> of the Prefect (Civil Governor).[127] [index_split_075.html#filepos750339] The secret committee created to study the discovery was under the direct controlof Benito Mussolini and his son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano, who in 1936, becameItaly’s Foreign Minister and the second most powerful official in Fascist Italy: > From this single recovery the top-secret Cabinet RS/33 had been created at La> Sapienza University in Rome following the recovery of the mysterious disc. The> only direct controllers of the RS/33 Cabinet were—Benito Mussolini, Count> Galeazzo Ciano (Mussolini‘s son-in-law and Foreign Minister of Italy), and the> Italian airman General Italo Balbo. It was charged with both investigating and> covering up what the documents called \"unconventional aircraft\" or> \"aeromobiles.\"[128] [index_split_075.html#filepos750768] Marconi was appointed to head Cabinet RS/33 partly due to their suspicion thatthe recovered flying saucer was of non-terrestrial origin: > The Cabinet RS/33 had links with the Fascist secret police OVRA and with> \"Agenzia Stefani,\" the regime's news agency in charge of disseminating Fascist> propaganda. Cabinet RS/33 was headed by the Italian physicist Guglielmo> Marconi (known for his belief in Martians, although he never played an active> part in the Cabinet, always sending in his place the astronomer Gino Cecchinin> from Turin). Marconi believed that alien life existed on Mars and that contact> with the “Martians” would be possible from powerful radio transmissions.> Probably due to this belief he was chosen to lead the RS/33 once it became> apparent that the recovered disc was not a man-made one from a Western nation> - especially an enemy of Italy.[129] [index_split_075.html#filepos751197] The Italian documents also referred to other flying saucer sightings in theprewar area that were under study by Cabinet RS/33. One of these sightingsoccurred in 1936, and was reported by a secret agent at the time who used thename ‘Andrea’ that included a sketch of the ‘metallic disc’: > It was sighted in the morning (and not in the evening) of Monday—he writes—it> was a metallic disc, polished and reflecting light, with a length of ten or> twelve meters. Two fighters from a near base took off, but were not able to> reach it even at 130 km/h. It didn't emit sound, which would lead one to> consider an aerostat. But nobody knows of balloons that can fly faster than> the wind. I know for sure that it was seen by other aviation pilots ... it> [report] has arrived to the hands of Ciano.[130]> [index_split_075.html#filepos751626] There was another incident in 1936 that showed two discs accompanying a largercigar shaped vehicle (see Figure 12). The Italian document is evidence that by1936, someone in Europe was possibly building not only flying saucers, but alsomuch larger cigar-shaped craft, both of which were powered by unconventionalsources. Figure 12. Fascist era document depicts UFOs[images/00053.jpg] The Agent, Andrea, continued his report and refers to a 1931 flying saucerincident and the concern that France or Britain may be responsible for thecraft. > The document mentions that \"the Prefecture has opened an inquiry, but you can> imagine that it will make little inroad and will have a similar outcome to> that of '31. The Duce has expressed his worries, because he says that if it> were a matter of real English or French aircraft, his foreign policy would> have to start all over again.[131] [index_split_075.html#filepos752019] While the location of the 1931 incident is not mentioned, it is significant thatthis is the same year mentioned in the General Garland Memorandum (discussed inchapter two), as a key date in the development of an advanced aviation programin Germany. Morris also mentioned that in 1931 Germany had recovered a craft.It’s possible that these recovered flying saucer craft may have been related toprototypes being tested by Schumann in Munich.Agent Andrea’s report suggests that by 1936, Cabinet RS/33 was still trying todetermine who was actually behind the construction of the flying saucer craftand the larger cigar shaped craft sighted in 1936. According to Roberto Pinotti,one of the principles figures in the study of the Italian UFO files, Germany wasalso on the list of countries suspected by Mussolini as the source of the flyingsaucer sightings.[132] [index_split_075.html#filepos752412]As Cabinet RS/33 continued its study of the captured 1933 flying saucer andsightings of similar craft in the immediate years after, it is likely thatMussolini at some point determined that Nazi Germany was involved. The 1933flying saucer in possession of the Italians, and/or later UFO sightings, wereeither part of or related in some way to a top secret Nazi advanced aviationprogram.If flying saucer prototypes were been built in 1931 by Schumann at theElectrophysics Laboratory at the Technical University of Munich, then it ispossible that in addition to the 1931 incident, the June 1933 Italian crash wasalso an unsuccessful test. The distance between Modena Italy (where the flyingsaucer was retrieved) and Munich Germany is approximately 500 kms/300 miles.Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933 byPresident Paul von Hindenburg. After Hindenburg’s death on August 2, 1934,Hitler merged the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency to becomethe undisputed leader (Fuhrer) of Germany. Rudolf Hess, as an early prominentmember of the Thule Society, was aware of the Vril Society’s Secret SpaceProgram. As Hitler’s deputy, Hess would likely have taken a keen interest in theprogress of the flying saucer prototypes and the implications for Nazi Germany.After Hitler’s regime took full control over Germany in late 1934, Schumann’swork and the Vril Society’s secret space program was brought to the attention ofsenior Nazi officials. According to Peter Moon, author of The Black Sun:Montauk's Nazi-Tibetan Connection: > Two special departments were set up to concentrate on the development of this> new flying technology of the Vril Society: U-13 and the SS-E-4. The latter was> under the direct supervision of Heinrich Himmler and was known as development> group number four of the Black Sun. The main focus of SS-E-4 was based upon> the work of Victor Schauberger.[133] [index_split_075.html#filepos752811] Based on Vril Society technologies, the Nazi SS began building its own versionsof flying saucers. By 1938 they had achieved some success: > Based upon the work of Schauberger and the Vril Society, Himmler’s SS-E-4> began work on its own flying discs. Towards the end of 1938, they were> actually constructing saucer shaped propeller craft. [134]> [index_split_075.html#filepos753030] According to former CIA whistleblower Stein/Kewper, British Intelligence hadlearned about the Nazi flying saucer program: > We also found another file about the Vril technology. The first thing in the> file when we opened it up was a British classified document, which was from> the 1930s before WWII started. It showed that in Peenemunde, the Germans had> developed the saucer craft with an entirely different kind of propulsion> system. Intelligence did not know exactly what the propulsion system was, but> they knew that the craft did not burn any fossil fuels. It had a levitation> device, I think is how they described it in the file.[135]> [index_split_075.html#filepos753233] Peter Moon goes on to describe how, by 1939, the Nazi SS developed its firstfully operational flying saucer called the Haunebu 1 (see Figure 13): > By 1939, the SS had learned from their mistakes and refined the RFZ-4. They> developed a long distance aircraft that was 65 feet in length and was> initially known as the RFZ-5. It was subsequently given the name Haunebu or> Haunebu 1.[136] [index_split_075.html#filepos753616]> Moon’s claim is supported by Stein/Kewper, who claims he saw four Nazi flyingsaucers at the S-4 facility in 1958: > The disc on the very end was a huge one and Col. Jim said that was a German> WWII craft built in 1938 and was jacked up higher on stands because it had a> gun emplacement underneath, which he said the Germans called a ‘death ray.’ It> was a different shape than the other [two smaller Vril] craft, was dark in> color and had a larger top that stood up probably 10 or 12 feet above the> saucer. That one had a diameter of about 50 or 60 feet.[137]> [index_split_075.html#filepos753819] Figure 13. Alleged blueprint of Haunebu 1 craft[images/00035.jpg]Figure 14. Sketch of Haunebu 2 craft[images/00040.jpg] By the end of 1942, Moon claims that the SS had completed its Haunebu 2 (akaRFZ-6) which was 100 feet in circumference, thirty feet high at its center, andcould travel at Mach 4 in the Earth’s atmosphere and also into outer space.[138][index_split_075.html#filepos754209] He says this was followed by the Haunebu 3that could fly at Mach 10 with 32 men aboard.[139][index_split_075.html#filepos754412] The key question that arises now is how much of the Vril society’s space programwas brought under Nazi Party control in order to weaponize these technologies?According to the conventional versions of history, Hitler distrusted secretsocieties and banned them in 1942. Yet, according to several sources anexception was made for the Vril Society, which had inspired the creation of theBlack Sun society formed under Himmler’s SS. This is what Peter Moon, author ofThe Black Sun: Montauk's Nazi-Tibetan Connection, had to say: > The Vril Society began around the same time as the Thule Society when Karl> Haushofer founded the \"Bruder des Lichts\", which means Brothers of the Light.> This organization is sometimes referred to as the Luminous Lodge. This group> was eventually renamed the Vril-Gesellschaft as it rose in prominence and> united three major societies: the Lords of the Black Stone, having emerged> from the Teutonic Order in 1917; the Black Knights of the Thule Society; [and]> the Black Sun, later identified as the elite of Heinrich Himmler’s SS. Whereas> the Thule Society ended up focusing primarily upon materialistic and political> agendas, the Vril Society put its attention on the \"Other Side.”[140]> [index_split_075.html#filepos754615] Orsic and the Vril Society were allowed to maintain a degree of independence fortheir space program due to their high occult standing, alleged communicationswith extraterrestrials and Thule, and close relationship with Himmler’s SS andits Black Sun elite.The independence of the Vril Society and its flying saucer program, led by Orsicand Schumann, led to the development of parallel space programs in Hitler’sGermany. Corey Goode similarly claims that parallel space programs emerged inNazi Germany involving secret societies: “The Vril, Thule, Black Sun Societies …were involved in several parallel programs to develop advanced technology.”[141][index_split_075.html#filepos754818]This might appear to be strange for a totalitarian society, but actually made alot of sense given the competing Nazi factions that Hitler used against oneanother to maintain his undisputed leadership. Albert Speer, who was Minister ofArmaments in Nazi Germany from 1942-1945, described in his book, Inside theThird Reich, that Hitler did like to manipulate competing factions in thismanner.[142] [index_split_075.html#filepos755332] Consequently, it would bepossible for Hitler to support the creation of parallel space programs. Oneprogram would be under the Vril Society, Orsic, and a “Black Sun” societyformally associated with Himmler’s SS. The second space program would be anoffshoot under Himmler’s SS that used technologies acquired in the formerexclusively for the war effort.There are unconfirmed sources describing the uneasy relationship betweenHimmler’s SS and Orsic’s Vril Society regarding how the secret space programwould be conducted, and its role in the overall war effort. There is good reasonto believe that the relationship would have been tense, given Orsic’s more peaceoriented metaphysical background, and Himmler’s desire for new weapons systemsthat would help the coming Nazi war effort. While the following is anundocumented summary, it fits with what is known of the personalities andfactions involved in the Nazi secret space program. > Himmler felt threatened by the ever increasing influence of Maria Orsic, and> on two occasions told Adolf Hitler that she is not to be trusted because she> is unstable, and she has close ties to the Jews…. Hitler simply said: We need> her for the time being but keep an eye on her…” and he added, “I don’t trust> secret societies…” Himmler, SS General Jakob Sporrenberg, and SS General Hans> Kammler kept Maria Orsic in isolation, and prevented her from having access to> Adolf Hitler. Even though, Orsic [Vril] Society’s meetings were exclusively> available to members she recruited personally, Himmler’s SS officers and> Gestapo agents were always present at all meetings. For Himmler knew very well> that Orsic’s primordial interests in building a super flying machine, were of> a metaphysical nature, and she never intended to contribute a thing to the> Nazi war efforts. Himmler never considered her as a true Nazi. In fact, Orsic> never joined the Nazi Party, for she did not believe in its cause, even though> many of her messages and communiqués to associates and colleagues would allude> to the idea of an Aryan race and its “enlightenment superiority” on a> metaphysical level.[143] [index_split_075.html#filepos755544] Himmler’s SS and Deputy Fuhrer Hess became key figures in the Nazi spaceprogram, which was classified at the highest levels. Even Albert Speer claims hewas unaware of these programs associated with “superweapons” in his Inside theThird Reich. Similarly, Mussolini had classified the work of Group RS/33 asabove Top Secret with “strict need to know” provisions.Infused with official Nazi government support and funding, Schumann’s and theVril Society’s space program would have developed quickly from the initial 1931prototype testing. According to Goode, it was in the later 1930’s that theprograms achieved operational success.[144] [index_split_075.html#filepos755800]By 1936, it is possible that larger cigar-shaped crafts sighted in Italy wereprototype space vehicles built by Nazi Germany in a now highly classified spaceprogram; led by Orsic’s Vril Society working closely with the Black Sun Group.Himmler’s SS closely monitored the progress of the Vril space program, whilesimultaneously developing a parallel program designed exclusively for the wareffort. It is this second or off-shoot space program under Himmler’s SS that wasthe subject of top secret collaboration between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. "},{"pageContent":"Space Program Cooperation Between Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy Once Mussolini’s Cabinet RS/33 realized that it was Nazi Germany, and not Franceor Britain, behind the flying saucer phenomenon, this would surely influenceFascist Italy as it feverishly modernized its Air Force with the increasinglikelihood of another major European war. Discovery of a flying saucer andrelated craft belonging to a secret space program created by Germany explainsMussolini’s puzzling decision to increasingly ally himself with Hitler. In July1936, both the Italian and German Air Forces began officially supporting GeneralFranco’s Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War.[145][index_split_075.html#filepos756314] It was the beginning of a Fascist alliancebetween Italy and Germany, and world-wide cooperation with sympatheticgovernments in Spain and Latin America.A secret agreement between Hitler and Mussolini for the study and development offlying saucer technologies was reached sometime in 1938, according to one of theleaked Italian UFO documents: > … in this latest consignment of material, he included copies of new documents> which—so he said—demonstrated the existence of agreements between Hitler and> Mussolini for the study of alien technology, agreements that had been made in> 1938; these documents were: an Agency Stefani message from Florence containing> an interview with the Fuhrer Hitler when he was visiting Italy; a banknote of> the nominal value of a million Lire (maybe “black funds of the RS/33> CABINET”); minutes regarding the oath of secrecy given by the professors who> collaborated with the Fascist Government; an invitation (registered) to Benito> and Rachele Mussolini to Villa Torlonia (said by “MR. X” to be for … an> extremely private meeting dedicated to the RS/33 CABINET).[146]> [index_split_075.html#filepos756769] The secret agreement between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, to cooperate in thedevelopment of flying saucers and a secret space program, culminated in anofficial treaty between the two nations. On May 22, 1939, Fascist Italy and NaziGermany signed the Pact of Steel where they pledged to join in mutual defenseand economic cooperation in a time of war. Articles III and IV outlinedextensive military and economic cooperation planned between the twoauthoritarian regimes.[147] [index_split_075.html#filepos757161]More evidence of a secret agreement between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany instudying and developing advanced flying saucer projects comes from a highlyaccomplished Italian scientist, Giuseppe Belluzzo, who built the first steamturbine in Italy in 1905 and became an expert on projectiles and cannons.Belluzo was appointed to serve in the Fascist government as Minister for theNational Economy from 1925 to 1928, and as Minister for Education from 1928 to1929.[148] [index_split_075.html#filepos757474]After the War, on March 24, 1950, Belluzzo went public with his claims ofinvolvement with the Nazi flying saucer program. He said that “flying saucer”designs were Italian blueprints, passed on to the Germans. He undoubtedly wasreferring to blueprints developed by RS-33 and subsequently passed on to NaziGermany.His remarkable claims were first published in the independent Giornale d’Italia,and soon after reprinted in leading Italian newspapers, many of which gave thisstory prominent first page coverage. These included: \"Il Corriere della Sera\",\"La Nazione\", \"Il Messaggero\", \"La Stampa\" and \"La Gazzetta del Popolo\". Figure 15. Italian newspaper story displays design of flying saucer worked on byBelluzzo [images/00037.jpg] More limited coverage appeared in a March 24, 1950 AP Newswire that wasreprinted in a number of English language newspapers around the world. Again,the story made it to the front page of many newspapers: > [Rome – AP] An Italian scientist said today that types of flying saucers were> designed and studied in Germany and Italy as early as 1942. Adolph Hitler and> Benito Mussolini, he added, were interested in the instruments, the idea of> which was developed concurrently both in Italy and Germany. Flying discs or> saucers have been reported sighted recently in many parts of the world. There> has been no scientific confirmation of the existence of such things, nor any> universally accepted explanation of what their purpose might be…. > “There is nothing supernatural or Martian about flying discs,” he said, “but> they are simply rational application of recent techniques.” Prof. Belluzzo, …> expressed the opinion that “some great power is launching discs to study> them.” ... Prof Belluzzo’s article was accompanied by a sketch showing the> possible construction … “The truth is,” wrote Prof Belluzzo,” that those> instruments of destruction can be built and operated. The principle of the> flying disc is simple, and construction with light metal very easy. Launching> of the discs,” he said, “can be done by rapid combustion of a cartridge> similar to that with which torpedoes are launched.”[149]> [index_split_075.html#filepos757649] In the more detailed Italian stories, Belluzo further explained the design offlying saucers and where he was studying them. Belluzzo’s March 24, 1950revelation was reprinted in Germany and less than a week later led to anotherscientist, Rudolph Schriever, revealing his own work in the Nazi flying saucerprogram. Schriever said the following in his interview with Der Spiegel,published on March 30, 1950, about the flying saucer design he called“Flugkreisel” (Flight Gyro): > He said that the project had been developed by him and his team at BMW's> Prague [Pilsen] works until April 1945, when he fled Czechoslovakia. His> designs for the disk and a model were stolen from his workshop in> Bremerhaven-Lehe in 1948 and he was convinced that Czech agents had built his> craft for \"a foreign power\".[150] [index_split_075.html#filepos758011] Figure 16. Belluzzo's sketches of the flying saucer he worked on[images/00004.jpg] The Skoda works located at Pilsen, near the Czech capital Prague, was whereBelluzzo, Shriever, and others worked on the development of the Nazi flyingsaucers.Researcher Rob Arndt discovered that Belluzo and other German scientists weretaken from an Italian Research facility to assist Shriever develop his prototypeat the BMW facility at Pilsen: > … the SS brought in three other prominent specialists to aid in the> Flugkreisel Projekt: Klaus Habermohl, Dr. Richard Miethe, and an Italian> Giuseppe Belluzzo from the Riva Del Garda facility. Six other unnamed> engineers also participated in the secret project.[151]> [index_split_075.html#filepos758367] There have been a number of witnesses describing the successful testing of theNazi flying saucers that apparently reached great speeds. Rudolf Lusar rose tothe rank of Major of a German Army technical unit during World War II. In thelate 1950’s, he wrote German Secret Weapons of World War II and described asuccessful test of a flying saucer on February 14, 1945, just outside Prague:“Within three minutes they climbed to an altitude of 12,400m and reached a speedof 2000 km/h in horizontal flight.”[152] [index_split_075.html#filepos758738]Nick Cook, author of The Hunt for Zero Point, described the ramifications ofLusar’s claim: > At a time when the most advanced interceptors of the day (the late 1950s)> struggled to achieve such velocities, this was an outrageous claim, but then> it didn’t have to be taken wholly at face value to contain an element of> truth.[153] [index_split_075.html#filepos758914] A 1952 CIA document reveals that Georg Klein, a former engineer with AlbertSpeer's Ministry for Armament and Ammunition, reported that a flying saucerproject had been in operation since at least 1941. He claims to have seen withhis own eyes its successful test flight in Prague in early 1945. > Georg Klein, a German engineer, stated recently that though many people> believe the “flying saucers” to be a postwar development, they were actually> in the planning stage in German aircraft factories as early as 1941. Klein> said that he was … present in Prague on 14 February 1945, at the first> experimental flight of a flying saucer.”[154]> [index_split_075.html#filepos759090] Another CIA document from 1954 summarizes a German newspaper report of whatKlein had witnessed: > A German newspaper (not further identified) recently published an interview> with George Klein, famous German engineer and aircraft expert, describing the> experimental construction of ‘flying saucers’ carried out by him from 1941 to> 1945. Klein stated that he was present when, in 1945, the first piloted> ‘flying saucer’ took off and reached a speed of 1,300 miles per hour within 3> minutes.[155] [index_split_075.html#filepos759418] An FBI report from 1967 reveals that another testing facility for the Naziflying saucer program was in the Black Forest of Austria: > On April 26, 1967 [the witness] appeared at the Miami Office and furnished the> following information relating to an object, presently referred to as an> unidentified flying object, he allegedly photographed during November, 1944. > Sometime during 1943, he graduated from the German Air Academy and was> assigned as a member of the Luftwaffe on the Russian Front. Near the end of> 1944, he was released from this duty and was assigned as a test pilot to a top> secret project in the Black Forest of Austria. During this period he observed> the aircraft described above. It was saucer-shaped, about twenty-one feet in> diameter, radio-controlled, and mounted several jet engines around the> exterior portion of the craft. He further described the exterior portion as> revolving around the dome in the center which remained stationary. It was his> responsibility to photograph the object while in flight. He asserted he was> able to retain a negative of a photograph he made at 7,000 meters (20,000> feet).[156] [index_split_075.html#filepos759832] The flying saucers being developed in Prague and other top secret locations werepart of the Nazi’s “wonder weapons” that Hitler hoped would turn the tide of thewar. Albert Speer was chief of Nazi Germany’s conventional armaments industries,and he was locked in a losing war with Himmler’s SS over the control of moreadvanced weapons such as the V-2 rocket. In his book, Inside the Third Reich,Speer described the most advanced weapons systems under development that he knewabout: > The jet plane was not the only effective new weapon that could have been> slated for mass production in 1944. We possessed a remote-controlled flying> bomb, a rocket plane that was even faster than the jet plane, a rocket missile> that homed [in] on an enemy plane by tracking the heat rays from its motors,> and a torpedo that reacted to sound and could thus pursue and hit a ship> fleeing in a zigzag course. Development of a ground-to-air missile had been> completed. The designer Lippisch had jet planes on the drawing board that were> far in advance of anything so far known, based as they were on the all-wing> principle.[157] [index_split_075.html#filepos760166] What’s notable here is that there is no mention of flying saucer craft. Yet weknow from the Belluzzo and Schriever testimonies that such programs existed.Furthermore, information from the Top Secret Italian RS-33 program was sharedwith Nazi Germany by at least 1938.Speer was not privy to the flying saucer program at Pilsen, which was under thedirect control of the Nazi SS. In particular, Lt. General Hans Kammler, a rivalof Speer, was accumulating greater power as Hitler turned his hopes to Himmler’spromise of wonder weapons that would turn the tide of war. Enormous sums ofmoney were turned over to Nazi SS, and to Kammler; to build the secretunderground factories with slave labor that would develop Hitler’s wonderweapons. In his book, Infiltration, Speer wrote about the parallel industrialinfrastructure developed by Himmler’s SS: > IN THE SPRING OF 1944, Hitler approved of Himmler’s proposal to build an> SS-owned industrial concern in order to make the SS permanently independent of> the stated budget.

"},{"pageContent":"Hans Kammler & Nazi Germany’s Parallel Secret Space Programs The man who was in charge of the SS’s industrial empire and secret weaponsprojects was Hans Kammler. Speer writes: > In the spring of 1942, Himmler had appointed Kammler, who had previously been> a high-ranking construction employee in the Air Ministry, to head the SS> construction operations, and in the summer of 1943 he chose him to handle the> [V2] rocket program.

Soon rumors were afloat that Himmler was trying to build up> Kammler to be my successor.[159] [index_split_075.html#filepos760592] Tom Agoston’s book, Blunder, describes how Kammler was given power over secretprojects that would occur outside of the purview of Speer’s Ministry ofArmaments, and Goering’s Luftwaffe: > The fact that Himmler assigned Kammler for the covert job of setting up a> top-secret SS research think tank operating at Pilsen, strictly behind the> backs of both Goering and Speer was kept under wraps.[160]> [index_split_075.html#filepos760774] Kammler was the key Nazi official with detailed knowledge about the Vril Societysecret space program that had made stunning technological breakthroughs. It wasKammler’s job to weaponize these technological breakthroughs for the Nazi SS,which was focused exclusively on developing a parallel aerospace program thatcould be used for the war effort.The fate of Hans Kammler, who was last seen on April 17, 1945, is shrouded inmystery. In Blunder, Agoston examined four theories that Kammler died, none ofwhich he found to be conclusive: > Despite the proliferation of unsubstantiated evidence that permeates all four> versions of Kammler’s death, the shell of the case contains sufficient facts> to suggest a more than coincidental patter of seemingly targeted and organized> disinformation. This was possibly motivated to cloud over the circumstances of> Kammler’s movements after April 17, 1945, when he last made contact with his> Berlin Headquarters.[161] [index_split_075.html#filepos761022] Figure 17. Nazi officers with Vril flying saucer in background[images/00045.jpg] If Kammler’s disappearance reflected a level of “organized disinformation,” thissuggests that his disappearance was a result of both covert Nazi actions andalso Allied assistance due to some secret agreement.Speer later revealed that Kammler had joined the list of senior Nazi leadersattempting to negotiate favorable deals with the Allied forces. Kammler’sknowledge of the Nazi’s wonder weapons would certainly be highly valued. At thevery least, Kammler was not someone that the U.S. would want to fall into Soviethands. > For the first time in our four-year association, Kammler did not display his> usual dash. On the contrary, he seemed insecure and slippery with his vague,> obscure hints about why I should transfer to Munich with him. He said efforts> were being made in the SS to get rid of the fuehrer.

In exchange for their guaranty of freedom,> he would offer them the entire technology of our jet planes, as well as the> A-4 rocket and other important developments....[162]> [index_split_075.html#filepos761185] The Swiss headquarters of the Office of Strategic Services was headed by AllenDulles, who went on to become the longest serving CIA director from 1953 to1961. Dulles spent all of the Second World War in Switzerland as the US chiefspymaster. Dulles was not averse to striking deals with senior Nazi officials tospare Allied armies further fighting and to have any Nazi weapons of interestturned over. One of Dulles’ most prominent deals concerned the surrender ofCorsica, where Nazi armies simply fled, and allowed Allied forces to sweep inunopposed. Dulles won the begrudging respect of the Army that previously did notthink too highly of the OSS.If Kammler wanted to make a deal with the U.S. military, then Dulles was theperson to see. Dulles was conveniently located in the Swiss city of Bern, easilyaccessible from Germany. When Kammler disappeared in late April 1945, the fateof the War was clear, so it is more than likely that he secretly traveled to seeDulles in Bern to try and strike a deal. Apparently, a deal was struck.Years later, a NASA Spacecraft Operator, Clark McClelland, reported seeingKammler at NASA. McClelland says that he met with Hans Kammler at the office ofthe Director of the Kennedy Space Center, while Kurt Debus was the Director[1962-1966]: > I opened his office door and saw two people I had not seen at KSC. He> introduced me to both men. He only gave me their first names during the> introduction…. One was introduced to me as Sigfried and the other was> introduced as Hans…. Both had the look of Nazi High Command Officers…. Today I> am certain of who these two men were. I eventually learned from other German> scientists that one of them was Siegfried Knemeyer, he was a very high ranking> Nazi Oberst Officer in the Luftwaffe… The other man was difficult to recognize> until I saw an older photo of him after he had later entered the USA. He was> in my opinion Heinz (Hans) Kammler…. There were rumors after WWII that Kammler> had made a deal with General George Patton to turn over German Top Secret> technology for his support in getting Kammler into the USA. That may have> actually happened. I personally believe it did happen.[163]> [index_split_075.html#filepos761438] More evidence that a deal had been struck with Kammler is found in Agoston’sbook, Blunder, which contains his interviews with a Nazi SS Colonel and formerindustrialist, Wilhelm Voss, who was Kammler’s subordinate and ran the Skodafactory. Voss described his interviews with the U.S. Counter-Intelligence Corps. > When Voss told the agents about Kammler's secret weapons program, he saw that> the Americans were not surprised by it and therefore had to conclude that they> somehow already had this information. Voss also noted that the agents were> simply not interested in finding Kammler. Additionally, it was found that> \"there were dozens of high-ranking former SS or Party members that had never> been called to account. They had simply disappeared. Many of them shared the> distinction of having had access to highly advanced technology.\"[164]> [index_split_075.html#filepos761822] If McClelend’s and Voss’s testimonies are accurate, then it is clear thatKammler did reach a deal with the U.S. and that it was very likely through asecret meeting with Dulles soon after Kammler’s April 1945 disappearance.There is also compelling circumstantial evidence that Kammler did indeed strikea deal with Dulles, and that the U.S. military were made aware of the superweapons Kammler had been supervising. Kammler’s most secretive Nazi SS projectswere located at the Skoda works in Pilsen, only 50 miles from the Czech capital,Prague. It had been agreed at Yalta, in 1944, that Czechoslovakia was going tobe in the Soviet Sphere of Influence, and it was therefore expected that Sovietarmies would liberate Czech territories. Instead what happened next has been oneof the big puzzles of the Second World War.General George Patton raced towards the Czech capital, Prague, with the largestU.S. Army assembled during the entire war. U.S. Military Intelligence determinedthat Prague was ripe for liberation with an active Czech resistance movement,ensuring an easy entry into Prague, and a big welcome to the advancing U.S.army. However, Patton’s huge army stopped after liberating Pilsen, and did nottravel the additional 56 miles to also liberate Prague. Patton pleaded withEisenhower to move and liberate Prague, but he was firmly instructed to staywhere he was. Patton protested to no avail: > American soldiers quickly began receiving reports of the uprising in Prague.> These reports were confirmed by a three-man Office of Strategic Services team> that infiltrated into Prague and returned to inform Patton of the situation.> After learning of the Czechs' plight, Patton called Bradley to get permission> to liberate Prague. \"For God's sake, Brad, those patriots in the city need our> help!\" Patton pleaded with his superior. Patton even went so far as to suggest> that he \"get lost\" until his troops had liberated the city. Not unsympathetic> to the Czechs, Bradley called Eisenhower but the Supreme Commander refused to> budge on his decision. Furthermore, he ordered Bradley to order Patton not to> cross the Karlovy Vary - Pizen [Pilsen]- Ceske Budejovice line.[165]> [index_split_075.html#filepos762118] Patton’s army took control over the vast Skoda plant with all of its top secretprojects. Teams of Army engineers and specialists pored over the facilitiesdocuments to find the secrets of Nazi super weapons. The same Third Armyspecialist teams that had earlier traveled to the Harz mountains to remove theprized secrets of Nazi V2 rockets, now went to Pilsen to remove its top secretsbefore the city would be turned over to the Soviets.[166][index_split_075.html#filepos762490] Any Nazi flying saucer prototypes, files,and scientists still at Skoda, were found and relocated to the U.S. After controlling Pilsen for only a few weeks, Patton’s Army withdrew and turnedover U.S. liberated Czech territories to the advancing Soviet army. According toAgoston, what happened at Pilsen was one of the major blunders by the U.S.,because Nazi secrets would now fall into the hands of the Soviet Union. WhatAgoston did not know was that deals were already reached between Kammler andDulles. Flying saucer and other advanced Nazi technologies were going to besecretly repatriated out of Skoda before the Soviet armies could get there. Partof the deal involved many top Czech scientists who managed Skoda under theNazis, and were allowed to leave Skoda and surrender to the advancing U.S. army.Agoston describes how Voss, a German industrialist who previously controlledSkoda under Kammler, had returned to learn about the escape of his formermanagers: > Voss was glad to learn that because of their decades-long loyalty to the Reich> and their predictable fate should they fall into Russian hands, Hitler had> provided them with last minute facilities to cross into the America zone at> Germany to surrender to the U.S. Army.[167]> [index_split_075.html#filepos762651] What was left at Skoda were the Czech managers and scientists who had decidednot to cooperate with U.S. authorities, and instead turned over their knowledgeand any files they possessed of the Nazi programs to the future Czech governmentand advancing Soviet army.Further testimonial evidence that the U.S. had negotiated a deal with NaziGermany over their flying saucer disks comes from Stein/Kewper, the former CIAagent discussed earlier, who travelled to review the S-4 facility at Area 51.Stein/Kewper received briefings, saw documents and saw four of the Nazi flyingsaucer craft that had been repatriated to the US after the war. He says thatthese flying saucers were Hitler’s wonder weapons, and in an interview withLinda Moulton Howe, responded to a question over why they were not used: > Col. Jim said he understood that Hitler chose not to use them, that these were> the ‘wonder weapons’ that Mussolini and Hitler mentioned. Many people thought> the German V-1, V-2 and V-3 rockets were the Nazi ‘wonder weapons,’ but that> was not true. The discs were the wonder weapons with their speed and> anti-gravitational technology.[168] [index_split_075.html#filepos762809] Based on the testimonial and documentary evidence examined so far, it appearsclear that a deal was struck with Kammler regarding the flying saucer technologyprojects underway at Pilsen under the control of Himmler’s SS. As pointed outearlier, the Nazi SS space program was a militarized offshoot of the earlierparallel Vril Society space program developed under Orsic and Schumann. Kammlerwas one of the few aware of these parallel Nazi space programs.As the Second World War drew to its increasingly obvious conclusion, Kammler ledthe Top Secret effort to relocate the infrastructure of the Nazi SS efforts toweaponize flying saucer technologies. What was left at the Skoda works, andother Nazi SS facilities in Europe, were technologies and scientists associatedwith the unsuccessful SS attempt to weaponize flying saucers for the war effort.These became useful bargaining chips for Kammler in negotiating with the U.S.military, and facilitating future Nazi infiltration of the U.S. militaryindustrial complex.Yet Kammler was weaving a still more intricate web concerning the successfulsaucer technologies achieved by another flying saucer technology group hemonitored during the war. This resulted in the most advanced components of NaziGermany’s secret space programs being safely moved to locations in South Americaand Antarctica, well before the end of the Second World War.These conclusions are consistent with Corey Goode’s claims that Kammler survivedthe war and cooperated with the U.S. in its study of flying saucers. In hisresponse to a question about Kammler and his secret saucer technologies, Goodealso claims he saw documentation about Kammler escaping to Nazi bases inAntarctica and South America: “Yes, there was much documentation about him andhis teams being in both the three known Antarctic (Cities/Bases) and severalsecret underground bases in Argentina.”[169][index_split_075.html#filepos763157] According to Goode, what the Nazis hadsecretly moved to in South America and Antarctica would be springboards for theVril Society’s successful space program to the moon and the stars. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter4 Origins of the Dark Fleet The Vril Society’s secret space program achieved stunning technologicalbreakthroughs while under the watchful eye of Himmler’s SS, who were eager toincorporate anything that could be weaponized for the war effort. With Hitler’ssupport, the Vril Society had the funding it needed to build operationalspacecraft. The propulsion systems in these craft used electrogravitics forthrust, and high frequency rotating plasma to reduce weight. These antigravitytechnologies were within the expertise of Prof. Schumann, who was involved withthe Vril flying saucer projects since its inception. These antigravitytechnologies enabled the Vril/Nazi spacecraft to achieve hypersonic speeds(above Mach 5.1) and aerial maneuvers (90 degree turns) that were impossible forjet or rocket propelled aircraft at that time, and still impossible today.It was not just that the Vril Society craft could achieve amazing speeds in theatmosphere, but they were fully capable of space travel. By the late 1930’s,Corey Goode claims that the Vril Society spacecraft were advanced enough totravel the 230,000 mile distance to the moon, land the first astronauts and evenestablish a moon base: > They [Nazis] had made several attempts at creating a moon base that did not go> so well going back to the 1930’s. They did find an ancient building that was> obviously built by much larger beings that they could cement and repair enough> to pressurize, and use as a temporary base while they constructed the> underground base that had a few visible structures on the surface; one of> which did take the shape of a Swastika.[170]> [index_split_075.html#filepos763667] Goode’s incredible testimony is supported by another whistleblower. Al Bielekclaims to have been involved in a number of covert programs beginning with thePhiladelphia Experiment. According to Bielak, there have been a number of covertmoon landings, the first of which was by Antarctica based Vril Society/NaziGermany: “We went publicly to the moon in 1969. Actually the Germans were therein 1947. And we were there in 1962 with a joint U.S.-Russian expedition.”[171][index_split_075.html#filepos764318]Bulgarian researcher, Vladimir Terziski, claims to have accessed secret Nazi SSfiles where he found documents and pictures detailing the Nazi space program. Hereports that the Nazis first reached the moon in 1942: > First landing on the moon by the Germans was at Mare Imbrium on August 23,> 1942 at 11:26 MEZ, using a Miethe rocket. The first man on the moon was> Kapitänleutnant Werner Theisenberg of the Kriegsmarine. Actually, the Navy did> most of the work on the moon shots, not the Luftwaffe. Landing took place> without radio contact to the main control center at the Wilhelmshaven or the> second control center located near Anzio, Italy. Ever since their first day of> landing on the Moon, the Germans started boring and tunneling under the> surface and by the end of the war there was a small Nazi research base on the> Moon.[172] [index_split_075.html#filepos764671] According to Goode, the reason why the Vril Society had achieved its stunningsuccess was that it was being actively assisted by an extraterrestrial race fromthe Alpha Draconis star system, which was also working with an advancedsubterranean Earth civilization. Support for Goode’s remarkable claim comes fromProf. Hermann Oberth, the father of German rocketry who allegedly said: “Wecannot take credit for our record advancement in certain scientific fieldsalone. We have been helped.\" When asked by whom, he replied, \"the peoples ofother worlds.”[173] [index_split_075.html#filepos765024]Also, in an interview with Linda Moulton Howe, former CIA agent Stein/Kewpersays that briefing documents revealed that the Nazis had been helped by anextraterrestrial race: > [Howe] Did you ever ask your boss if there were 6-fingered beings associated> with saucer craft in Germany in 1938, prior to World War II, did that mean the> 6-fingered beings were helpers to Germany? > [Kewper] They were helpers to Germany.[174]> [index_split_075.html#filepos765525] During the Second World War, as Hitler’s war effort inexorably crumpled, theVril Society allegedly continued to achieve more stunning technologicalachievements. This included following up their successful moon landings with aninterstellar trip to the Aldebaran star system in the early 1940’s. According toGoode: > Yes, there was an early attempt at sending their early craft designs through> natural portals before they fully understood portal physics. This “expedition”> ended up being much like the Philadelphia Experiment that the Americans would> end up doing years later. There is a lot that goes into portal travel and an> entire new physics and mathematics model was developed for calculating travel.> Without the help of both off world groups and the deceptive Ancient Break Away> Civilizations masquerading as ET’s, they and the early “Joint Programs” (post> Eisenhower Treaty Era, which became the various SSP’s) would have had to have> built these models from the ground up and learn many lessons the hard> way.[175] [index_split_075.html#filepos766027] At any other time, such technological achievements would have been front pagenews, but at a time of global warfare, it was yet another secret in a long listof many closely guarded by both sides in the war. As Nazi Germany slowlycollapsed with advancing Soviet and Western armies, escape was the only optionfor the Nazi elite and Vril Society members. "},{"pageContent":"The Nazi Retreat to Antarctica & South America The ‘official’ defeat of Nazi Germany in May 1945 was in fact a ‘tacticalvictory’, and it masked a major strategic defeat for the ‘victorious Allies’that was kept from the general public. A significant proportion of NaziGermany’s political elite, their most advanced technology and fully operational‘saucer ships’ had escaped from Allied occupation forces.[176][index_split_075.html#filepos766541] Richard Wilson and Sylvia Burns claim tohave interviewed insiders and seen classified documents in researching theirbook, Secret Treaty: The United States Government and Extra-terrestrialEntities.

NavySecretary, James Forrestal, had requested President Roosevelt to create the JIOAdue to Navy Intelligence about an advanced Nazi technology program. InJuly/August 1945, Forrestal travelled to occupied Germany to see for himselffirst-hand how Operation Paperclip was proceeding by visiting Navy and Armyfacilities to view some of the advanced Nazi technologies captured by the U.S.military. Kammler’s successful negotiations with the Allied forces over theseNazi technologies would have been known to Forrestal. Forrestal was helping theU.S. Navy decide which of the captured Nazi technologies would be worthdeveloping for future use. The development of advanced Nazi submarines were ofparticular interest to the U.S. Navy, which shared some of the constructiontechniques used for building flying saucers and the larger cigar-shaped craftcapable of travelling into orbit around the Earth and beyond. Goode claims thatthe Navy was the leading military service in the development of the first U.S.secret space program, which will be examined in chapter five.A significant footnote to Forrestal’s 1945 Germany trip was that he wasaccompanied by a young John F. Kennedy, who Forrestal wanted to recruit to hispersonal staff. Kennedy accompanied Forrestal during his tour of capturedadvanced Nazi weapons, and during meetings with senior Allied Generals such asGeneral Eisenhower. Kennedy recorded his visit in a diary that was posthumouslypublished as Prelude to Leadership. [181] [index_split_075.html#filepos769030]Kennedy’s dairy makes it clear that he was present during Forrestal’s review ofadvanced technologies of interest to the Navy, some of which would berepatriated under Operation Paperclip. While Kennedy’s diary doesn’t refer toflying saucers, it is clear that he witnessed advanced Nazi technologies, andwas briefed about what he could write about and what had to be kept secret.President Kennedy’s subsequent attempts to gain access to classified UFO filesand technologies were shown to have been a direct factor in hisassassination.[182] [index_split_075.html#filepos769268] The advanced Nazitechnologies he witnessed during his 1945 Germany trip were therefore a factorin his assassination.The discovery that the Nazi SS had removed their most advanced secrets,technology and personnel during the run up to the final defeat of Germany wouldhave been a huge shock to Allied leaders; once it became clear what hadoccurred.[183] [index_split_075.html#filepos769515] Rather than the final monthsof the Second World War being a last desperate gamble by a megalomaniac Nazileadership that could not accept inevitable defeat, it was in fact a holdingaction for a methodically well planned extraction of the Nazi’s most valuableresources and personnel to well-prepared remote locations in the Antarctic andSouth America. Kammler’s successful negotiations with the Allied forces onlyinvolved the second tier of advanced technologies known to the Nazi regime.According to classified briefing documents he witnessed, Corey Goode describes“three known Antarctic (cities/bases) and several secret underground bases inArgentina” that had been established by the Nazis.[184][index_split_075.html#filepos769784]The Nazis had sufficient time and resources to prepare for such an exodus giventheir extensive business links, front companies, and connections with SouthAmerican governments and companies. The well-equipped Nazi expeditions to theAntarctic in the pre-war period allowed the Nazi’s to familiarize themselveswith the Antarctic terrain, and lay the foundations for any post-war role to beplayed within these territories.The most ambitious Nazi expedition occurred in 1938/1939, when extensiveportions of the Antarctic were claimed by Captain Alfred Ritscher on behalf ofthe Nazi government. The aircraft carrier, Schwabenland, sent planes to performextensive aerial surveillance of the region claimed by Nazi Germany, which wascalled Neuschwabenland.[185] [index_split_075.html#filepos770298] Among thegoals of the Schwabenland expedition was the establishment of several bases inAntarctica.The establishment of Nazi Antarctic bases became a cause of concern forPresident Roosevelt, who gave orders for a military expedition to challenge theNazi presence in parts of Antarctica he deemed to be part of the WesternHemisphere. The New York Times reported on July 7, 1939: > President Roosevelt moved today to prevent possible extension of Germany’s> claims to Antarctic areas into the Western Hemisphere by directing Rear> Admiral Richard E. Byrd to leave in October to territory within the sphere of> influence of the Monroe Doctrine … it [is] apparent that this government was> prepared to take the position, if necessary, that any attempts by foreign> powers to establish bases west of the 180th meridian in the Antarctic would be> considered an unfriendly act …[186] [index_split_075.html#filepos770672] During the war itself, extensive submarine activity in the region of Antarcticasuggested that Nazis were building bases in addition to what Captain Ritscher’sexpedition had established. Such a possibility was fueled by a comment made bythe commander of Nazi Germany’s submarine fleet, Admiral Karl Donitz, in 1943,when he claimed that his fleet had built “in another part of the world aShangri-La land—an impregnable fortress.”[187][index_split_075.html#filepos771127] After Germany’s unconditional surrender onMay 8, 1945, Nazi submarine activity in the Antarctic region continued asevidenced by the following report by the Agence France Press on September 25,1946: > [T]he continuous rumors about German U-boat activity in the region of Tierra> del Fuego [‘Feuerland’ in German] between the southernmost tip of Latin> America and the continent of Antarctica are based on true happenings. [188]> [index_split_075.html#filepos771493] What compounded this realization of a Nazi elite exodus to Antarctica for theAllies was evidence that the Vril Society had been successful in contactingextraterrestrial races, and an advanced human civilization based within theEarth’s interior. Nazi cooperation with extraterrestrial life and/or ancientinterior Earth civilizations would now be a factor in the Allies pursuing anderadicating the remnants of Nazi Germany that had relocated to Antarctica andSouth America.The Vril Society’s saucer program had achieved operational success well beforethe Nazi defeat. Orsic had ensured that the Vril Society program was notdirectly associated with the war effort, so it was possible to move most oftheir technologies, infrastructure and personnel to safe locations in Antarcticaand South America.As quoted earlier, according to the testimony of Stein/Kewper, Hitler gaveorders for the Vril Society space program to be moved to Antarctica andArgentina, before the start of World War II.[189][index_split_075.html#filepos771859] This scenario is supported by documentsshowing Hitler had authorized a number of military missions to the Antarctic inthe pre-war era.[190] [index_split_075.html#filepos772306] Nazi Germany devotedsignificant resources to the exploration of Antarctica, and established a prewarpresence there with its first mission in the Antarctic summer of 1938/1939. Thismade it possible that one or more underground bases had been established ordiscovered that could accommodate the Vril Society Secret Space Program beforethe Second World War began.This was not the case for Himmler’s SS which, under Kammler’s authority, hadfailed in a last ditch effort to weaponize flying saucers in time to turn thetide of the War. Kammler took whatever infrastructure and operational flyingsaucer craft he could; before the advancing allied armies reached the top secretSS production centers in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere.This is how Nazi World War II researcher, Ivo Harbinson, described the Nazi SSretreat to Antarctica according to documents he witnessed: > [I]n March 1945, just before the end of the war, two German provision U-boats,> U-530 and U-977 were launched from a port on the Baltic Sea. Reportedly they> took with them members of the flying saucer research teams, the last of the> most vital flying saucer components, the notes and drawings for the saucer,> and the designs for gigantic underground complexes and living accommodations> based on the remarkable underground factories of Nordhausen in the Harz> Mountains. The two U-boats duly reached Neuschwabenland, more correctly known> as Queen Maud Land, where they unloaded.[191]> [index_split_075.html#filepos773038] In response to a question about the role of Orsic and the Vril Society inpost-war Nazi bases, Goode explains: > She has obviously made it to the Antarctic bases/cities…. I do know that these> “Societies” were very much the backbone of what survived the war and who were> in control of the facilities along with the group they believed was ET, as> well as the Draco Federation that they allied themselves with. This is a very revealing statement. The Vril Society, and its allies in theThule and Black Sun societies, had not only successfully maintained theirindependence from Himmler’s SS, but now were in a leadership position in theAntarctic facilities. The Nazi defeat led to the incorporation of what was leftof Kammler’s weaponized flying saucer program; with the Vril Society’soperational secret space program, which had gone through the Second World Warundetected and undamaged. The success of the Vril Society in maintaining itsindependence from the Nazi SS, and even assuming a leadership position in thebreakaway society, shows how powerful Vril, Thule and Black Sun leaders hadbecome in Hitler’s totalitarian society. It was not long after the merging ofthe Nazi space programs, however, before its leaders had aligned themselves with(or been taken over by) dark occult forces that worked with a negativeextraterrestrial group, the Draco Reptilians.Goode describes these dark occult forces as similar to the ‘Sith’ ideology inthe Star Wars movie franchise.[192] [index_split_075.html#filepos773313] Goode’sdescription fits with what is known of the practices of the Black Sun Societyformed at the apex of Himmler’s SS. The historian Peter Levanda, author of thebook Unholy Alliance, described how Himmler set up the occult underpinnings ofthe SS leadership at the medieval castle of Wewelsburg: > Here the secret Chapter of the Order [Black Sun] assembled once a year. Each> member had his own armchair with an engraved silver nameplate and each had to> devote himself to a ritual of spiritual exercises aimed mainly at mental> concentrations…. The focal point of Wewelsburg evidently owing much to the> legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, was a great dining> hall with an oaken table to seat twelve picked from the senior> Gruppenfuhrers.[193] [index_split_075.html#filepos773827] Here, the Nazi SS leadership practiced communications with spirit forces fromthe realm of the dead: “It was within the great dining hall with its Round Tablethat Himmler and his Inner Circle of Twelve Gruppenfuhrers would engage inmystic communication with the realm of the dead Teutons and perform otherspiritual exercises.”[194] [index_split_075.html#filepos774064] Levandadescribes a round table meeting involving Himmler and his SS Black Sun elite inregards to the questioning of the commander-in-chief of the regular German Army,General von Fritsch: > He [Himmler] assembled twelve of his most trusted SS leaders in a room next to> the one in which von Fritsch was being questioned and ordered them all to> concentrate their mind on exerting a suggestive influence over the General> that would induce him to tell the truth. I happened to come into the room by> accident, and to see these twelve SS leaders sitting a in a circle, all sunk> in deep and silent contemplation, was indeed a remarkable sight.[195]> [index_split_075.html#filepos774284] Over time, it is easy to see how the dark occult knowledge practiced by theBlack Sun Order would have led to the compromise and takeover of the VrilSociety space program.With their three Antarctic bases and those in Argentina, the now merged Nazi SSand Vril Society space programs had fully operational ‘saucer ships’ that couldmove around the planet and even fly to a secret moon base. Many of the UFO’switnessed in the immediate post war era were, according to reports from a numberof military officials aware of the advanced nature of the Nazi’s technology,fully operational Nazi spacecraft.[196] [index_split_075.html#filepos774504] "},{"pageContent":"Operation High Jump Encounters Nazis and ET Allies A U.S effort to locate, take-over and/or destroy the Nazi Antarctica basesoccurred with a Naval military expedition led by Rear Admiral Richard Byrd in1946/47. Byrd’s military expedition to Antarctica was named “Operation HighJump,” and comprised “4700 military personnel, six helicopters, six Martin PBMflying boats, two seaplane tenders, fifteen other aircraft, thirteen US Navysupport ships and one aircraft carrier; the USS Philippine Sea.”[197][index_split_075.html#filepos774936] Byrd received both classified andunclassified orders, which is not unusual for Navy commanders. For the generalpublic, the unclassified reason for this expedition was largely scientific interms of exploring, mapping, and finding locations for future bases.Among the unclassified commands issued to Admiral Byrd from the Commander of theUS Navy, Admiral Chester Nimitz were: > a) train personnel and test material in the frigid zones> b) consolidate and extend American sovereignty over the largest practical> area of the Antarctic continent> c) to determine the feasibility of establishing and maintaining bases in> the Antarctic and to investigate possible base sites> d) to develop techniques for establishing and maintaining air bases on the> ice, (with particular attention to the later applicability of such techniques> to Greenland)> e) amplify existing knowledge of hydrographic, geographic, geological,> meteorological and electromagnetic conditions in the area. [198]> [index_split_075.html#filepos775716] The unclassified scientific reasons for the expedition were a cover for itsclassified purpose. Byrd’s Naval armada was not conducting a scientific mission,but, as its size clearly suggested, a military expedition against a classifiedenemy that would not be publicly revealed.The Antarctic summer of 1946/47 was the first feasible opportunity to mount sucha large military expedition to the frigid regions of Antarctica. The surrenderof Japan occurred on September 2, 1945, and there was simply not enough time forthe U.S. Navy to get the necessary military intelligence, and then plan andequip a sufficiently sized military expedition for the upcoming summer season inAntarctica, which would begin in December 1945. The U.S. would have to wait overa year to mount a military expedition.Coming so soon after the end of the Second World War, it seems puzzling thatsuch a large armada would travel to Antarctica at a time of increasing Cold Wartensions, and the decommissioning of Naval personnel and ships, unless theexpedition was sent to militarily deal with some unresolved issues from the waritself. Specifically, remnants of the Nazi elite hidden in an underground baseor bases established in the pre-war era. Byrd’s classified mission wastherefore to locate, take-over and/or destroy the Nazi Antarctica bases.Ironically, it was Admiral Byrd who had earlier been invited to Nazi Germany asa guest of honor for Captain Ritscher’s Schwabenland expedition, before itdeparted for Antarctica on December 17, 1938. > In 1939, before the German Expedition, the only aerial photography undertaken> in the Antarctic had been that by the most famous US expeditioner, Richard E.> Byrd in 1933. Byrd had visited the German Expedition in Hamburg at the> invitation of the German Society of Polar Research which had the task of> assembling and training the crew of the Expedition. The Society invited Byrd> to join the Expedition and he met the crew and was given a tour of the> preparations. Byrd, however, declined the offer, returning to the U S and> taking command of the U S Antarctic Service at the request of President> Roosevelt until that position was ended in its first year due the approach of> World War II.[199] [index_split_075.html#filepos776086] As mentioned earlier, on July 8, 1939, Admiral Byrd first received orders fromPresident Roosevelt to locate and challenge, any Nazi Antarctic bases that fellunder the U.S. sphere of influence. [200] [index_split_075.html#filepos776523]The orders were not carried out then, or during the U.S. entry into the war.Finally in 1947, Admiral Byrd was leading a US Naval Expedition to seek out,take-over, or eliminate bases created or ‘discovered’ during and/or after the1938 Schwabenland expedition. The Nazi Antarctic bases had nine uninterruptedyears to prepare for the looming confrontation with the U.S. Navy.The Byrd mission was scheduled to last up to six months but ended in a mereeight weeks because it had, according to Chilean Press reports, “run intotrouble\" and that there had been \"many fatalities\".[201][index_split_075.html#filepos776978] If the true goal of the mission was tolocate and eradicate any Nazi bases, the press reports and early end to themission indicated a dismal failure and a rude awakening for the US Navy.After the Soviet collapse in 1991, the KGB released previously classified filesthat cast light on the mysterious Byrd led Naval expedition to Antarctica. A2006 Russian documentary made public for the first time a 1947 secret Sovietintelligence report commissioned by Joseph Stalin on Task Force 68’s [officialname for Operation Highjump] mission to Antarctica.[202][index_split_075.html#filepos777351] The intelligence report, gathered fromSoviet spies embedded in the US, revealed that the US Navy had sent the militaryexpedition to find and destroy one or more hidden Nazi bases. On the way, theyencountered a mysterious UFO force that attacked the military expedition,destroying several ships and a significant number of planes. Indeed, OperationHighjump had suffered “many casualties” as stated in initial press reports fromChile. While there is a possibility the report resulted from US disinformationfed to a known Soviet mole, the more likely explanation is that the reportexposes the first known historical incident involving a battle between US navalforces and an unknown UFO force stationed near Antarctica.In the Soviet intelligence report, never before released testimony by two USNavy servicemen with Operation Highjump was revealed. A recent article in NewDawn, by Frank Joseph, gives a detailed analysis of the two eyewitness accounts,only the latter of which was mentioned in the 2006 Russian documentary. John P.Szehwach, a radioman stationed on the USS Brownson, gave testimony of how UFOsappeared dramatically out of the ocean depths. On January 17, 1947 at 0700hours, Szehwach said: > I and my shipmates in the pilothouse port side observed for several minutes> the bright lights that ascended about 45 degrees into the sky very quickly… We> couldn’t i.d., the lights, because our radar was limited to 250 miles in a> straight line.[203] [index_split_075.html#filepos777687] Over the next several weeks, according to the Soviet report, the UFO’s flewclose over the US naval flotilla which fired on the them, and the UFO’sretaliated with deadly effects. According to Lieutenant John Sayerson, a flyingboat pilot: > The thing shot vertically out of the water at tremendous velocity, as though> pursued by the devil, and flew between the masts [of the ship] at such a high> speed that the radio antenna oscillated back and forth in its turbulence. An> aircraft [Martin flying-boat] from the Currituck that took off just a few> moments later was struck with an unknown type of ray from the object, and> almost instantly crashed into the sea near our vessel…. About ten miles away,> the torpedo-boat Maddox burst into flames and began to sink… Having personally> witnessed this attack by the object that flew out of the sea, all I can say> is, it was frightening.[204] [index_split_075.html#filepos778079] There is a major problem with Sayerson’s quoted statement. There has been notorpedo boat named Maddox in the US Navy.[205][index_split_075.html#filepos778471] In the Russian documentary, the incidentdescribed by Sayerson (misspelt Sireson) refers instead to the destroyer“Murdoch.” There was, however, no destroyer named “Murdoch” active in the USFleet in 1947. Instead there was a destroyer named “Maddox” (DD-731), but it didnot serve in Operation Highjump. In fact, the USS Maddox was the destroyer firedupon in the Gulf of Tonkin incident of 1964.[206][index_split_075.html#filepos778890]According to Frank Joseph, the USS Maddox was “either a torpedo boat, ortorpedo-carrying destroyer.” He goes on to explain what may have happened to theMaddox mentioned in the Soviet report: > A USS Maddox was indeed sunk by enemy action, but five years earlier by a> German dive-bomber during the Allied invasion of Sicily. Actually there were> at least three American destroyers known by that name (DD-168, DD-622 and> DD-731) all of them contemporaneous. The US Navy has long been notorious for> falsifying the identity of its ships and re-writing their histories if they> embarrass official policy…. So too, the “Maddox” cited by Soviet espionage was> similarly consigned to an official memory hole.[207]> [index_split_075.html#filepos779158] If Joseph is correct, then it is very possible that a USS Maddox was destroyedduring Operation Highjump, and the US Navy changed official records to hide thisfact. An alternative explanation is that the 1947 Soviet report contained U.S.orchestrated disinformation that was being conveyed to Soviet authorities by aSoviet mole known by the US intelligence community. Though plausible, this ishighly unlikely, given that the US and USSR were still allies at the time ofOperation Highjump, and had a common interest in finding and destroying anyhidden Nazi base(s) in the South Atlantic.A March 5, 1947 Chilean press interview of Admiral Byrd, after the premature endof Operation High Jump, suggested that there had indeed been a military defeatand there was a new threat located at the South Pole: > Adm. Byrd declared today that it was imperative for the United States to> initiate immediate defense measures against hostile regions. The Admiral> further stated that he didn’t want to frighten anyone unduly but it was a> bitter reality that in case of a new war the continental United States would> be attacked by flying objects which could fly from pole to pole at incredible> speeds.[208] [index_split_075.html#filepos779549] It was clear that the best the US Navy could muster was no match for the small,but well-armed Nazi elite that survived the war in their remote Antarcticlocation. The possibility that the Nazi’s were receiving assistance from ahighly technologically advanced ally in fending off the US attack cannot bediscounted. The presence of Orsic and other Vril Society members suggest thatthe Nazis had an esoteric means of communicating with allies, eitherextraterrestrial and/or an advanced subterranean civilization. [209][index_split_075.html#filepos780083]This scenario is supported by the testimony of Stein/Kewper, who saw documentsand received briefings about the fate of Operation Highjump: > In 1946-1947, the United States had a scientific mission to Antarctica under> Admiral Byrd and we had military interaction there with aliens and their> saucer craft, like a mini-war. We lost all of our aircraft.[210]> [index_split_075.html#filepos780788] Subsequent reports of extensive UFO activity in the Antarctic region wereconfirmation that it was being used as a base of operations for a new enemy, onethat unnerved Admiral Byrd; and, according to the Chilean press report, couldfly from “pole to pole.”[211] [index_split_075.html#filepos781246]According to Corey Goode, the Nazis had help in establishing and protecting thethree Antarctic bases: > There was help from the Draco Federation as well as a group that the NAZI’s> were led to believe were ET’s (referred to as “Arianni” or “Aryans”, sometimes> called “Nordics”) but were actually an Ancient Earth Human Break Away> Civilization that had developed a Space Program (referred to as “The Silver> Fleet”) and created vast bases below the Himalayan Mountains (largest in Tibet> and called the system Agartha) and a few other regions.[212]> [index_split_075.html#filepos781875] Goode further states that after Byrd’s stunning Antarctic defeat, the survivingNazis regime used their hidden bases and advanced flying saucer technologies topressure both the Truman and Eisenhower administrations into accepting secretdeals: > [A]fter the failed Operation High Jump Mission, the Operation Paperclip> Scientists were asked to negotiate meetings. The Nazi Breakaway Group knew> that the Americans had recovered crashed craft from several different species> of off world visitors that were so far advanced that they were getting nowhere> with the reverse engineering of their technology.

On> July 12, 1952, President Truman observed several of the UFOs and was> completely amazed by their capabilities of outmaneuvering the USAF and US Navy> advanced Jet fighter, the F-4D. USA jets sent up to bring one down. None could> fly the speed of the German Saucers.[214] [index_split_075.html#filepos782903] In addition to brute displays of technological superiority by the surviving Naziregime, Goode claims that there was an extensive infiltration of the militaryindustrial complex by Nazi sympathizers. Among the thousands of former Naziscientists and technicians that were part of Operation Paperclip, there wereassets from the Antarctic based breakaway Nazi group, whose job was toinfiltrate the U.S. Space program and military industrial complex. The latterwas well on track to establishing its own “breakaway civilization,” whichaccording to Goode was infiltrated and coopted by Nazi assets that werepromoted: > When both Truman and Eisenhower signed treaties with the NAZI Break Away> Civilization/Societies, it was then that the already well placed Operation> Paperclip Operatives (in Military, Corporate Industry, Intelligence and> established Secret and Public Space Programs) easily slid into more powerful> and influential positions over the massive industrial complex of the USA, that> they coveted to expand their operations in space….[215]> [index_split_075.html#filepos783258] McClelland corroborates Goode’s claim that the Nazi SS had infiltrated OperationPaperclip back in 1946, and continued to intimidate German scientists at theKennedy Space Center (KSC) well into the 1960’s: > Some of the German engineers and technicians I met at KSC were all aware that> a few of the German S.S. were working at Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space> Center that arrived with Project Paper Clip with Dr. Von Braun in 1946. …> These S.S. were as feared at KSC as they were in the German Army during> WWII.[216] [index_split_075.html#filepos783772] Goode says that there was a race between both sides, the U.S. elite and the Nazibreakaway group, to see who could more quickly infiltrate and take over theother: > After the treaty was signed and the joint Secret Space Programs began in> earnest, things quickly got out of hand and the NAZI Break Away Group won the> race to infiltrate and take over the other side. They soon controlled every> aspect of the U.S. from the Financial System, The Military Industrial Complex,> and soon after, all three branches of the government itself. This may be very> difficult for some people to believe, however, the more people are waking up> to what our own Government has been up to the last 70 years, the more people> are coming around to realizing what has happened to the US.[217]> [index_split_075.html#filepos784127]> Goode describes the takeover as a silent coup by the breakaway Nazi regime: > During the 1950’s, and thereafter, they had successfully infiltrated and> subverted the Military Industrial Complex and major Corporate Heads; they had> effectively won control of the direction of not only the Break Away> Civilization Programs, but also the mainstream government and financial> system. It was a very effective and silent coup that gutted what was once the> American Republic and turned it too into a Corporate Entity with each of us> being “Assets” with our very own serial numbers. This plan was in action far> before World War I by various secret societies who controlled the financial> system, and as many know, financed both sides of the wars.[218]> [index_split_075.html#filepos784642] Goode’s claims are very controversial but are supported by prominentresearchers. In his book, The Rise of the Fourth Reich, Jim Marrs claims thatthe U.S. was indeed infiltrated by committed Nazis brought to the U.S. throughOperation Paperclip, who took with them not only advanced technologies, but alsotheir Nazi ideology.[219] [index_split_075.html#filepos785156] As one reviewerexplains: > In this explosive exposé, the legendary Jim Marrs explores the frighteningly> real possibility that today, in the United States, an insidious ideology> thought to have been vanquished more than a half century ago is actually> flourishing. At the end of World War II, ranking Nazis, along with their young> and fanatical protégés, used the loot of Europe to create corporate front> companies in many countries, worming their way into corporate America. They> brought with them miraculous weapons technology that helped win the space> race. But they also brought their Nazi philosophy based on the authoritarian> premise that the end justifies the means—including unprovoked wars of> aggression and curtailment of individual liberties—which has since gained an> iron hold in the \"land of the free.\" Jim Marrs has gathered compelling> evidence of the effort that has been under way for the past sixty years to> bring a form of National Socialism to modern America, creating in essence a> new empire—or \"Fourth Reich\"![220] [index_split_075.html#filepos785424] According to Goode, as a result of successful Nazi efforts to protect theirAntarctic bases and secret agreements reached with the U.S. administration, thesurviving Nazis were able to build a huge base on the moon. The base waseventually turned over to the U.S. secret space program, which had beeninfiltrated by Nazi sympathizers, and became known as Lunar Operations Command: > This base was still being built when they made the breakthrough deals with the> Americans in the early 1950’s that gave them access to the industrial might> that had cost them the European War. They now used this industrial power (soon> to be known as the Military Industrial Complex) to their favor and built out a> massive base that went down many levels in a “Bell Shape” along with the> surface structures built around the former structures to become what we now> call the Lunar Operation Command (aka LOC). [221]> [index_split_075.html#filepos785945] Goode alleges that with the successful infiltration of the U.S. militaryindustrial complex and the different secret space programs that would emerge inthe late 1950’s and 1960’s, the breakaway Nazi group next directed its energiesoutside of the solar system. This led to the creation of what Goode describes asthe “Dark Fleet,” which operates primarily outside of our solar system. "},{"pageContent":"Emergence of the “Dark Fleet” Secret Space Program According to Goode, the “Dark Fleet” is among five main secret space programsthat have emerged in the modern era. As its name suggests, it is associated withnegative occult forces; linked with the secret societies that operate in obscureways and cooperate with a group of extraterrestrials that have a sinisterhistory. Goode summarizes the Dark Fleet as follows: > Dark Fleet – Worked almost entirely outside the Sol System, very military> (offensive), extremely classified above the others, and there were large> fleets (similar looking carrier craft that looked like the Star Wars> wedge-shaped craft in the movies). They worked alongside the Draco Alliance> and are speculated to fight alongside them in their affairs in other> systems.[222] [index_split_075.html#filepos786459]> The cooperation with the Draco Alliance is highly significant. There isextensive testimony, from whistleblowers and experiencers, discussing the DracoReptilians as an imperialistic extraterrestrial race conquering many worlds, andusing captives as slave labor. The ruling class of the Draco Reptilians—to bediscussed in chapter 11—are claimed to be very powerful psychics. Earlier, itwas described how the Nazi SS Black Sun Order practiced occult communicationwith dead Teutonic spirits. It is not hard to see how the Draco Reptilianleadership could have easily infiltrated the Nazi SS Black Sun and co-opted itsleadership by impersonating dead Teutons. This association between DracoReptilians and “dark magic” or “black magic,” has led many researchers tobelieve that they are the demonic entities summoned in Satanism.[223][index_split_075.html#filepos786927]Goode responded to a question about the Dark Fleet which helps to give a betterunderstanding of its personnel, who were heavily influenced by Nazi ideals andbeliefs, that aligned well with the Draco imperial mindset of conquest andracial purity: > It is true that the Dark Fleet personnel have been called “Storm Troopers” and> “Space Nazis” both because of the way they act, dress and the symbols they> wear, as well as the shape of their vessels (Star Wars like). They are very> dark individuals who work alongside the Draco vessels, mostly outside the Sol> System, helping them in offensive activities against enemies of the Draco> Joint Federation.[224] [index_split_075.html#filepos787542] Of the five secret space programs associated with contemporary human history, asidentified by Goode, the “Dark Fleet” is chronologically the oldest. The DarkFleet eventually emerged out of the once ideologically peaceful Vril secretspace program. This only occurred after dramatic changes took place due towartime circumstances, with shifting fundamental goals culminating in thenecessity for relocation. This landed the breakaway Nazi group in Antarctica andSouth America with their fantastic technological breakthroughs.The Vril Society had worked during the war with the Thule and Black Sunsocieties, the latter being at the apex of Himmler’s SS. With the integration ofthe Vril and Nazi SS space programs after the war, the role of the Black SunOrder was augmented. It was the Black Sun Order that would lead the way as theNazi/Vril secret space program developed as a unified entity.Courting the dark occult forces was the vital ingredient of this Nazi secretsociety breakaway group (increasingly dominated by the Black Sun Society), whichled to the alliance with the Draconian extraterrestrials. While the breakawayNazi secret society grouping had found their ideologically suited partners fornew forms of conquest in the Draconian Federation Alliance, the U.S.military-industrial complex began producing its own secret space program. Nearlytwo decades after the Vril Society had developed operational spacecraft, theU.S. secret space program would likewise achieve operational success. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter5 Solar Warden: The USA’s First Secret Space Program On February 20, 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt allegedly wrote a memorandumto “The Special Committee on Non-Terrestrial Science and Technology” regardingthe study and development of non-terrestrial (flying saucer) technologies thathad been captured during the course of the Second World War. The memorandumrevealed that Roosevelt had been briefed about a captured craft of anon-terrestrial origin, which created the need for “coming to grips with thereality that our planet is not the only one harboring intelligent life in theuniverse.”[225] [index_split_075.html#filepos788056] While the leakedmemorandum’s authenticity has been disputed, extensive analysis by experts hasassigned it a “medium-high level of authenticity,” due to “strong signs ofauthenticity in the way of content, forensics, typography, zingers etc.”[226][index_split_075.html#filepos788565]The “Special Committee” described in the leaked memorandum was headed by thePresident’s science advisor, Dr Vannevar Bush, who had advocated a program toapply “non-terrestrial know how” for the development of super weapons to be usedfor the war effort. In the memorandum, Roosevelt firmly ruled out such a programbecause its expense would impact on the development of more conventionalmilitary weapons such as the atomic bomb. The President wrote: > Various points have been raised about the difficulties such an endeavor would> pose to the already hardened research for advanced weapons programs and> support groups in our war effort and I agree that now is not the time.

I have heard the arguments of General Marshall and other members of the> military that the United States must assume its destiny in this matter for the> sake of the Nation's security in the post-war world and I have given> assurances that such will be the case. [227]> [index_split_075.html#filepos788967] Roosevelt had wisely ruled out following a similar path taken by Nazi Germanywith its endeavors to apply non-terrestrial knowledge to the war effort.Consequently, during the course of World War II, while Nazi Germany dideverything within its power to weaponize flying saucer technologies, the U.S.did the precise opposite by shelving such programs until the post-war era. ThePresident believed that conventional and nuclear weapons would be sufficient tooverwhelm the Nazis before their super weapons could be successfully deployed.It appears his choice was the right one with the successful outcome of the war.Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, less than a month before Nazi Germany’s formalsurrender. It would now be up to President Harry Truman to decide what to dowith the non-terrestrial technologies the U.S. possessed, and the veryterrestrial Nazi technologies that had been developed for the war effort andwere now in the hands of the Allied powers.By the time of the war’s conclusion in Europe, on May 8, 1945, Nazi scientistshad a big head start on the study and reverse engineering of flying saucertechnologies. Scientists and inventers, including Professor Winfried Schumann,Viktor Schauberger and many others, had been working on flying saucertechnologies for the Vril Society, and later the Nazi SS, for as long as twodecades. Now the U.S. had to catch up, and it needed former Nazi scientists toreveal what they had learned in developing operational flying saucer craft. Anyscientist, engineer, inventor, or bureaucrat with knowledge of these programswould be thoroughly interrogated in post-war Germany to find out what they knew.Those deemed to be most valuable or essential for the future U.S. flying saucerprogram would be taken to the U.S. "},{"pageContent":"Reverse Engineering Captured Nazi & Alien Flying Saucers Immediately after World War II, the US Army and Navy set up Operation Paperclip.It transferred over 1500 German scientists and inventors to the U.S. who haddirect knowledge of Nazi advanced weapons programs. They were taken to differentsecure U.S. facilities. It is well documented that Werner Von Braun and otherswere sent to Fort Bliss, Texas to help U.S. scientists understand captured V-2missiles in order to develop ballistic missile technologies. The captured Nazitechnologies became the basis for NASA’s space program in the early 1960s, andthe intercontinental ballistic missiles used by the Air Force and Navy.Winfried Schumann and others were taken to Dayton, Ohio where the Army Air Force(renamed USAF in September, 1947) were studying captured aerospace technologiesthat included Vril and Nazi flying saucers, along with blueprints for moreadvanced cigar-shaped spacecraft. Figure 18. Operation Paperclip scientists at Fort Bliss. Source: Wikipedia[images/00033.jpg] In chapter two, Stein/Kewper said that he had witnessed four Vril and Nazi craftthat dated back as early as the 1920s while touring the highly classified S-4facility at Area 51 in 1958. After seeing the Nazi craft he says that his CIAsuperior, Anthony Bardon, told him: > I never expected to see this! I expected to see more on aliens, but I never> expected to see that WWII had so much to do with German technology. And when> we saw the two saucer craft at Area 51, Anthony looked at me then and said,> ‘Vril craft!’ The third big one with the gun on the bottom Col. Jim also said> was a ‘Vril craft.’[228] [index_split_075.html#filepos789341] When asked about the diameters of the four Nazi craft, Stein/Kewper said: “Ithink about 18 to 20 feet on the [two] Vril craft…. and then the back [two]craft were about 60 feet in diameter.” [229][index_split_075.html#filepos789776] Stein/Kewper stated that the last twocraft were found “in Germany in the back of the Messerschmitt aircraft plantdown in southern Germany near Austria.”[230][index_split_075.html#filepos790211]Stein/Kewper’s testimony confirms that Operation Paperclip had located andrepatriated four Nazi flying saucer craft. The first two were early Vril Societyprototypes. The larger two were undoubtedly a result of Himmler’s and Kammler’sfailed efforts to weaponize flying saucers for the war effort. The initiallocation where the Vril and Nazi flying saucers were taken is very likely the USArmy Air Force (USAF) facilities at Dayton, Ohio; the same location where theflying saucer remains of the July 1947 Roswell crash were later taken. The book,Inside the Real Area 51: The Secret History of Wright Patterson, details thehistory of the Dayton facilities that were used for the study and reverseengineering of all foreign technologies, including flying saucers, by the US AirForce and its predecessor (US Army Air Force).[231][index_split_075.html#filepos790646]The construction of the S-4 facility at Area 51 in the mid-1950s led to a numberof the flying saucers, both Vril/Nazi and non-terrestrial, being transferredthere from Dayton’s Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The remoteness of theNevada desert allowed for the testing of these vehicles in total secrecy. Incontrast, Wright-Patterson was a very large base with thousands of militarypersonnel lacking the clearance to know about the highly classified flyingsaucers in U.S. possession. In addition, there was a large civilian populationin Dayton, Ohio, who might witness the testing of any captured flying saucer ordeveloped prototype.The primary goal of the classified S-4 facility was to study and reverseengineer captured Vril and Nazi flying saucers, along with extraterrestrialspacecraft. This is corroborated by Stein/Kewper, who said that he alsowitnessed three extraterrestrial flying saucers at the facility, purported tohave been recovered from New Mexico: > All Col.

Col. Jim> at Area 51 said alien craft propulsion systems were anti-magnetic and> anti-gravitational on two of the craft and one had an anti-matter type> propulsion that was much more complicated than the other two. Apparently they> thought that the anti-matter propulsion was older and more complicated than> the newer anti-gravitational systems in the other two craft.[233]> [index_split_075.html#filepos791351] Stein/Kewper’s testimony is supported by Bob Lazar, who claims that he brieflyworked at the S-4 facility in 1989. He says that he saw nine flying saucercraft, and was asked to work on one that used anti-matter as part of itspropulsion system. Lazar arranged for others to witness the testing of one ormore of the flying saucers located at S-4. Lazar was officially paid by a covertbranch of the U.S. Navy, thereby helping confirm that the Navy was directlyinvolved in the reverse engineering attempts to study alien technologies.Stein/Kewper’s testimony is supported by yet another whistleblower who claimsthat he was assigned to the S-4 facility to perform guard duty from 1983/1984until 1991. Derek Hennessy (aka Connor O’Ryan) described the hangar facilitiesat S-4, which stored seven flying saucers retrieved from various crash sites. Hesays that there were ten hangar bays in total. The S-4 facility was described as“the museum” suggesting it was designed to store advanced flying saucertechnologies that had been superseded. He revealed how one or more of the flyingsaucers would be raised to the surface for a flight test. This would only occurwhen Russian or other spy satellites were not passing overhead. All testingwould stop when satellites were detected.[234][index_split_075.html#filepos791792]While Hennessy doesn’t refer to any of the flying saucers as Nazi SS or Vrilcraft, his revelation that the S-4 facility was described as “the museum”suggests it was a facility to study captured flying saucer craft that went backdecades, very likely to the World War II era, as Stein/Kewper claimed.Hennessy’s information also suggests the primary goal of the S-4 facility was tostudy captured flying saucer craft in order to reverse engineer them. Again,this is consistent with Stein/Kewper’s information, and also what Lazarrevealed. The main discrepancy is that Stein/Kewper (in 1958) and Hennessy (from1983/84 – 1991) say they witnessed seven flying saucers at S-4, while Lazar sayshe saw nine in 1989. A possible explanation is that prior to Lazar’s service,two additional vehicles or prototypes had been added in the latter part of the1980s for testing and study purposes.The testimonies of Stein/Kewper, Lazar and Hennessy reveal that the S-4 facilityat Area 51 was set up to study and reverse engineer both captured Vril/Naziflying saucers and alien flying saucers. The actual development of reverseengineered flying saucer craft would take place at other locations. It would bemajor aerospace corporations that would secretly build the U.S. military’s ownflying saucer fleet using the antigravity technologies that had been reversedengineered from captured Vril/Nazi and alien craft. "},{"pageContent":"Reverse Engineering Cigar-Shaped Spacecraft Carriers As disclosed in chapter one, the development of antigravity technologies becamea very highly classified topic in the late 1950’s. Aviation industry papers onantigravity principles stopped appearing. Thomas Townsend Brown, a pioneer inthe development of electrogravitics, had his proposal for developing flyingsaucer shaped craft using electrogravitic principles turned down by the U.S.Navy. The Navy turned down Brown’s Project Winterhaven, not because it wasn’tviable, but because the Navy had already come into the possession of workingantigravity craft that were being studied at S-4 by the mid-1950’s.The antigravity principles developed for the operational Vril Society and NaziSS flying saucers were based on electrogravitics and high frequency rotatingplasma circuits. This led to the development of electrogravitic propulsion usedfor the amazing hypersonic atmospheric speeds achieved by the Nazis. Thedevelopment of “Magnetic Field Disrupter” (aka “Magnetic Gravity Cancellation”described by Goode) technology, by utilizing rotating mercury based plasma,reduced the weight of Nazi craft by as much as 89%—as was later claimed to bethe case with the TR-3B. Furthermore, the propulsion systems of the largerVril/Nazi flying saucers could be augmented, with more traditional propulsiontechnologies, as exemplified in the earlier discussion of the TR-3B in chapterone. There were two radically different designs for the operational antigravity craftused by the Nazis. The first were small saucer-shaped vehicles originallydeveloped by the Vril Society, and later weaponized by the SS for the war effortin various versions of its Haunebu series. In addition, there was the muchlarger cigar-shaped craft called the “Andromeda Device” (“Andromeda-Gerat”),which could house the Haunebu craft; it was also part of the Nazi SS superweapons project.[235] [index_split_075.html#filepos792148] Researcher Rob Arndtdescribes the Andromeda Device as: > The ultimate dream and driving purpose of the Vril Gesellschaft originated by> psychic mediums Maria Orsic, Sigrun, and Traute (known as the Vril Chefin, or> bosses) was to achieve space flight by any means possible to reach the> Aldebaran system in the Taurus Constellation—64 light years from earth.[236]> [index_split_075.html#filepos792567] An alleged blueprint of the Andromeda Device was released by controversialBulgarian researcher, Vladimir Terziski, who claims it came from Nazi SSarchives). Figure 19. Andromeda Device. Source: Vladimir Terziski[images/00046.jpg] According to researcher, Rob Arndt, work began in 1943 to build two AndromedaDevices at the old Zeppelin hangars in Germany: > Work on two of these massive 139 meter long and 30 meter diameter “flying> cigars” probably began with great effort in early 1943 in above ground heavily> camouflaged shelters similar to that of the old Zeppelin hangars. These craft> were designed to hold both a Haunebu II or IV disc in one large bay with two> other smaller Vril 1 or 2 discs in a secondary bay—both accessed from the side> of each craft. Each craft was to be crewed by 130 and were to be armored with> a quadruple layered Victalen hull. …[237] [index_split_075.html#filepos792986] While the Haunebu craft used electrogravitics for propulsion and a MagneticField Disrupter (aka Magnetic Gravity Cancellation) for weight reduction, thename and purpose of the Andromeda Device suggests that alongside theseantigravity technologies, it used an even more exotic form of propulsion to makeit capable of interstellar missions: > The propulsion systems located at both the fore and aft sections of the> Andromeda craft would be beyond the last Haunebu-type Thule Tachyonator 7c> drive. These craft were to have four massive power units, two Tachyonator 11> at the front and two at the rear with four additional large SM-Levitator units> located in pairs on the top and bottom of each craft, which sat on a series of> large underbody skids to support the massive weight. It is generally assumed> that those engines were of the same EMG (Electro-Magnetic-Gravitic) type, but> other Allied Intelligence officers believe that they might have been photonic> based on witness accounts of one large craft flying with a massive bright> light source emitted from the rear. Thule might have simply used the> Tachyonator term to describe an evolution of energy drives that might have> varied in the latter models. Although designed as an armed vessel with> provision for five turrets armed with powerful KSK [Kraftstrahlkanone, or> Power Ray Cannon] it is doubtful that any armament actually made it onto> either of the two prototypes under construction.[238]> [index_split_075.html#filepos793405] Arndt’s reference above to different versions of a “Thule Tachyonator” drive isvery revealing. While he suggests the term was used merely to describe anevolution in energy drive technology, the name raises the possibility that theVril Society and Nazi scientists had been successful in developing a propulsiondrive based on the use of Tachyon particles.Here is a summary of the development of tachyon particles in theoreticalphysics: > Tachyons are a putative class of particles which [are] able to travel faster> than the speed of light. Tachyons were first proposed by physicist Arnold> Sommerfeld, and named by Gerald Feinberg. The word tachyon derives from the> Greek tachus, meaning “speedy.” Tachyons have the strange properties that,> when they lose energy, they gain speed. Consequently, when tachyons gain> energy, they slow down. The slowest speed possible for tachyons is the speed> of light.[239] [index_split_075.html#filepos793824] In 1910, Albert Einstein and Arnold Sommerfeld (a German theoretical physicistwho lived from 1868 to 1951) conducted a thought experiment involving atheoretical device that was later called the “tachyonic antitelephone”: > A tachyonic antitelephone is a hypothetical device in theoretical physics that> could be used to send signals into one’s own past. Albert Einstein in 1907> presented a thought experiment of how faster-than-light signals can lead to a> paradox of causality, which was described by Einstein and Arnold Sommerfeld in> 1910 as a means “to telegraph into the past”.”[240]> [index_split_075.html#filepos794184] A spacecraft capable of using a tachyon device would be able to achievesuperluminal speeds “to telegraph into the past.” This means that a tachyondrive based on the Einstein-Sommerfeld idea of a “tachyonic antitelephone” wouldmake interstellar flight possible. Spacecraft could travel vast distancesmeasured in light years and essentially “telegraph into the past” to a timeshortly before it left for its destination. This is nicely illustrated in thefollowing limerick: There was a young lady named Bright,> Whose speed was far faster than light.> She went out one day,> In a relative way,> And returned the previous night![241] [index_split_075.html#filepos794578] The first person to raise the possibility that Nazi Germany had successfullydeveloped some kind of tachyon drive is Terziski, who wrote in 1993: > Ever since their first day of landing on the Moon, the Germans started boring> and tunneling under the surface, and by the end of the war there was a small> Nazi research base on the Moon. The free energy tachyon drive craft of the> Haunibu-1 and 2 type were used after 1944 to haul people, materiel and the> first robots to the construction site on the Moon.[242]> [index_split_075.html#filepos794944] Terziski’s claims of having gained his information from Nazi SS archives havebeen very controversial and many researchers simply dismissed them as tooincredible to believe.[243] [index_split_075.html#filepos795293]Support for Terziski’s incredible claim of Nazi developed tachyon drives,however, comes from Corey Goode. In an April 4, 2015 interview, Goode describedhis first assignment in a U.S. Navy led secret space program in 1987. He saidthe program possessed military and scientific research spacecraft, and that heserved on one of the latter: “I was only assigned to the research vessel [ASSR“ISRV”– (Auxiliary Specialized Space Research) Interstellar-Class Vessel, ArnoldSommerfeld] for a little over 6 years.”[244][index_split_075.html#filepos795718] In an August 5, 2015 email interview, Goodegave more details about the naming of his research vessel: > In communications the vessels were just known by their vessel designation and> numbers. There was a painting and nameplate for Arnold Sommerfeld in the> Galley which I am told is some sort of tradition. The crew of this vessel were> often rotated off in short tours or were stationed there, but spent much of> their time off the vessel on other projects. I would hear the crew refer to> the “Sommerfeld” in relation to the vessel, but this was not used in the> communications between vessels or in documentation.[245]> [index_split_075.html#filepos796135] It appears odd that Goode served on a spacecraft named after Arnold Sommerfeld,which belonged to a secret space program created under the auspices of the U.S.Navy. Clearly Sommerfeld achieved something quite remarkable to have a shipposthumously named after him in a secret U.S. Navy created space program. ArnoldSommerfeld is known for having supervised more Noble Prize winners in physicsthan any other person in history. This is quite a remarkable achievement, butcertainly not enough to have an interstellar class spacecraft belonging toanother nation named after you.As mentioned earlier, Sommerfeld was the first person to propose the existenceof superluminal particles that were later named “tachyons”. Einstein andSommerfeld’s 1910 thought experiment, “tachyonic antitelephone,” had apparentlybeen successfully operationalized when the Vril Society (and later Nazi SS)began developing flying saucer prototypes. A significant fact is that Sommerfeldwas a tenured professor at the University of Munich at the same time thatSchumann headed the Electrophysics Laboratory at the Technical University ofMunich. Schumann’s work on the Vril flying saucer (and later Nazi) programscould have easily involved Sommerfeld as a consultant. If so, while Schumann canbe credited as the first to develop an operational flying saucer craft,Sommerfeld was likely the person that pioneered the development of temporaldrives based on the idea of a “tachyonic antitelephone” that made possibleinterstellar flight. This would certainly explain why a covert branch of theU.S. Navy would honor Sommerfeld by naming an interstellar spacecraft after him.This conclusion is supported by Goode’s claim that the Sommerfeld and otherSolar Warden vessels were equipped with “temporal drive” propulsion systems: > They work on a principal that allows them to travel in subspace, transporting> a vessel from one point to another, almost instantaneously. These “Jump> Drives” [aka temporal drives] are used to cross over and negotiate Space/Time> and Time/Space in a way that does not involve traveling in our conventional> way of thinking. These vessels are closely tracked and have temporal buffers> in the technology that prevents the vessel from traveling back to our own Sol> System in a different time frame. The QCCD (Quantum Correlated Communication> Device) is a communication device that uses principals of Quantum Entanglement> between certain isotopes (if I remember correctly) that allow devices to be> able to communicate with each other no matter the distance in time or> space.[246] [index_split_075.html#filepos796664] While most conventional physicists believe that “faster-than-light particlescannot exist because they are not consistent with the known laws of physics,”Goode’s revelation suggests otherwise.[247] [index_split_075.html#filepos797193]His alleged service on an interstellar capable spacecraft named after ArnoldSommerfeld suggests that tachyon “temporal drive” propulsion systems have beendeveloped, and were used as early as 1943 by the Vril Society and Nazi SS. Thisis consistent with Terziski’s claims.The development of tachyon based “temporal drives” leads to the question ofwhether or not the Vril Society/Nazis attempted missions to Aldebaran with theirAndromeda Device. An answer is given by Goode, who describes how the firstattempt by the Vril Society/Nazis to do interstellar missions to Aldebaran wasonly partially successful, due to a failure to fully understand portal physics. > Q. Did Orsic/Nazis organize an expedition to the Aldebaran star system?> > A. Yes, there was an early attempt at sending their early craft designs> through natural portals before they fully understood portal physics. This> “expedition” ended up being much like the Philadelphia Experiment that the> Americans would end up doing years later. There is a lot that goes into portal> travel, and an entirely new physics and mathematics model was developed for> calculating travel. Without the help of both off world groups and the> deceptive Ancient Break Away Civilizations masquerading as ET’s, they and the> early “Joint Programs” (post Eisenhower Treaty Era, which became the various> SSP’s) would have had to have built these models from the ground up and learn> many lessons the hard way.[248] [index_split_075.html#filepos797540] Figure 20. Possible Nazi cigar-shaped craft photographed hovering over New YorkCity[images/00009.jpg] The U.S. military was unable to locate any of the Andromeda Devices at the endof the Second World War. While Operation Paperclip had gained the blueprints forthese devices, it would take years, if not decades, to develop a functionaldevice. While Operation Paperclip was able to find and repatriate Nazi flyingsaucers, the larger and more powerful cigar-shaped Andromeda Devices had eludedtheir grasp. According to Goode, the postwar Vril Society/Nazi SS space programdid overflights of U.S. cities in a show of power that led to the U.S.negotiating a secret agreement, as discussed in chapter four.[249][index_split_075.html#filepos798051]The U.S. Navy advocated Operation Paperclip because it was primarily interestedin the Nazis’ cigar-shaped craft, which could be developed as space basedcarriers housing smaller saucer craft. The Navy’s expertise in the developmentand operation of aircraft carriers made it the logical branch among the U.S.military services for overseeing the development of similar large carrier-typecraft for deep space operations. Using cigar-shaped spacecraft carriers based onNazi designs, the Navy would come to lead the development of the first U.S.secret space program.Gary McKinnon’s testimony (as discussed in the introduction) revealed that inthe period from 1995 to 2002, he had hacked into US Space Command, NASA andother government sites. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper in 1995,McKinnon explained what he found. > I found a list of officers' names … under the heading 'Non-Terrestrial> Officers'…. I found a list of 'fleet-to-fleet transfers', and a list of ship> names. I looked them up. They weren't US navy ships. What I saw made me> believe they have some kind of spaceship, off-planet.\" [250]> [index_split_075.html#filepos798565] He also saw a cigar-shaped craft photographed in space. His testimony supportsthe conclusion that a secret space program exists, which uses cigar-shapedvehicles and a covert branch of the U.S. Navy is directly involved. "},{"pageContent":"Solar Warden The alleged name of a secret space program using ‘antigravity’ propulsiontechnologies for deep space operations is ‘Solar Warden’. The first publicreference to Solar Warden occurred on March 13, 2006. A reliable source,according to administrators of the Open Minds Forum (a popular internet forum atthe time), revealed its existence and capacities.> > All space programs are a cover that exists [sic] to deceive the people of this> world. We have a space fleet, which is codenamed “Solar Warden.” There were,> as of 2005, eight ships, an equivalent to aircraft carriers and forty-three> “protectors,” which are space planes.

This base was established in 1964 by American and Soviet> teamwork.[251] [index_split_075.html#filepos798995] Another source describing Solar Warden was a whistleblower using the pseudonym‘Henry Deacon’, who claimed he had worked at Laurence Livermore laboratories asa physicist. Deacon’s real identity was later revealed at an ExopoliticsConference in Barcelona, Spain, in 2009, as Arthur Neumann. In a 2007 interviewwith Kerry Cassidy and Bill Ryan from Project Camelot, Neumann (aka HenryDeacon) reported the existence of secret bases on Mars, and modes oftransportation used to get there and back: > Transport is by two means: stargates for personnel and small items, spacecraft> for larger items of freight. The alternative fleet is codenamed SOLAR> WARDEN.[252] [index_split_075.html#filepos799295] Ryan and Cassidy wrote about learning of the Solar Warden program and testingDeacon’s knowledge of its alleged existence: > We had first heard of this from another source, and queried Henry about the> codename. We sent him two separate messages, each simply of one word: SOLAR,> and then WARDEN. We offered no context, or reason for our communication. > The reply came immediately in three e-mails, each from a different address.> The first said MARS, the second said ALTERNATIVE, and the third had as its> subject \"Not listed here\" and gave this URL [List of US Navy Aircraft> Carriers] as its only content. We were impressed.[253]> [index_split_075.html#filepos799701] In a November 24, 2010 post on the Project Avalon forum, Ryan further explainedthe significance of Deacon’s response: > Before the URL (a public-sector list of US Navy aircraft carriers - i.e.> regular warships) Henry had written the subject: Not listed here. His two> one-word messages immediately prior to that had been Mars and alternative. > To spell it out, he was confirming that SOLAR WARDEN was an alternative fleet> consisting of aircraft carrier-sized vessels—but not the kind that floated on> water.

He asked about the existence ofa “Solar Warden” program, and received the following reply from an unnamed DoDofficial: > \"About an hour ago I spoke to a NASA rep who confirmed this was their program> and that it was terminated by the President. He also informed me that it was> not a joint program with the DoD.

Unfortunately, Perks did not supply the emailsent to him confirming his narrative, and could not be contacted for moreinformation. The idea that NASA, rather than the DoD, runs a highly classifiedspace program capable of traveling to Mars appears strange. Was the DoD officialtrying to mislead Perks about Solar Warden to get him to think it had beenterminated and was previously under NASA control? "},{"pageContent":"Corey Goode and Solar Warden The most detailed and extensive whistleblower testimony concerning Solar Wardenhas come from Corey Goode, who claims to have personally served over a 20 yearperiod on different ships belonging to this highly classified space program: > Solar Warden – Established early and is the most aging fleet (though it has> gone through many upgrades over the decades). They have a R&D/Scientific> focused fleet, and a Military Offensive/Defensive focused fleet that is mainly> focused on policing the Solar System and surrounding Star Clusters and keeping> track of “Intruders” and “Visitors,” as well as locating and removing> unauthorized “Visitors” on the Earth and other planetary bodies. Their program> name describes their function pretty well.[256]> [index_split_075.html#filepos801082] Goode’s reference to the early establishment and aging technology of SolarWarden is very revealing. He says: > The Solar Warden Group was the more “Aging” of the SSP Groups with much of> their fleet being produced in the 1980’s and 1990’s with continuous> upgrades.[257] [index_split_075.html#filepos801547] Goode explained that cigar-shaped craft belonged exclusively to the Solar Wardenprogram, as opposed to other Secret Space Programs (SSP) emerging later that hadmore modern designs: “these older ‘Cigar’ shaped Vessels were ‘Solar WardenAssets’.”[258] [index_split_075.html#filepos802012]Solar Warden was established as a high priority secret space program backed bythe U.S. military, which was playing catch-up to the Vril/Nazi SS post-warsecret space program of the 1940’s. The Nazi fleet of cigar-shaped Andromedavehicles operating out of Antarctica and the moon were of special concern,leading to urgency in developing similar ships for the U.S. Navy in particular.Yet it took as long as four decades, according to Goode, for similar sized spacecarriers with interstellar capabilities to be developed for Solar Warden.The nearly 40 year gap between the size, speed and distance capabilities ofVril/Nazi Andromeda Device cigar-ships, and the Solar Warden space carrierequivalents achieved in the 1990s, gives an idea of how slow progress was forOperation Paperclip and U.S. scientists in reverse engineering efforts. Goodedescribed agreements being reached with the breakaway Nazi/Vril Society spaceprogram during the Eisenhower administration. Chapter four discussed Goode’sclaim that the Nazi SS/secret societies had thoroughly infiltrated OperationPaperclip’s scientists and the U.S. military industrial complex. This suggeststhat the slow progress in the development of these cigar-shape space carriersfor the Solar Warden program was a result of Nazi interference and/or sabotage.Until such time as it would pose no threat to Dark Fleet operations, it appearsthat Solar Warden’s development would be delayed by its predecessor. While theDark Fleet operates primarily outside of the solar system, according to Goode,it can still maintain a base on the far side of the moon without interference bythe Solar Warden program.Goode described the crew compliment and range of the Solar Warden fleet: > These “Cigar” shaped Carriers were designed to carry a large compliment of> crew for extended periods of time and travel to “other Star Systems” (though> Solar Warden was mostly kept to just inside our Sol System and the “Local Star> Cluster” on rare occasions).[259] [index_split_075.html#filepos802477] Goode revealed the number of cigar-shaped space carriers he was aware of duringhis covert space program service that began in 1987: > There were, however, more than eight carrier Craft that were “Cigar” shaped> and some were in the range of a “Mile Long”. There were many different “sizes”> and “classes” of vessels and craft in the Solar Warden Fleet alone. I have> briefly been on board one of these carriers, but have not traveled on them. I> was assigned to a Research Vessel of a smaller size that was “Triple Hulled.”> [260] [index_split_075.html#filepos802942] Goode also described some of the smaller craft that flew out of the Solar Wardenspace carriers: > As stated, there were more than 8 of the “Cigar” shaped carrier class and> other classes of vessels of various sizes and classifications. They were> designed to carry various type of “craft” that many think of as the TR-3B….> Most of them are “Triangle” or “Chevron” shaped to some degree, as well as the> “Manta” shaped craft.

There is no way to> compensate for the extreme speeds and changes of direction with “Eye-Hand> Coordination.”[261] [index_split_075.html#filepos803407] Goode said that Solar Warden spacecraft were divided between a “MilitaryOffensive/Defensive focused fleet” and an “R&D/Scientific focused fleet.[262][index_split_075.html#filepos803872] Regarding crew personnel serving on the“Military Offensive/Defensive” fleet, Goode responded as follows to a questionabout the personnel that served on them: “These were mostly American personnel,there were a number of UK, Canadian and Australian personnel serving on board aswell.” [263] [index_split_075.html#filepos804337]In contrast, regarding crewpersonnel serving on the R&D/Scientific fleet, he identified different nationalsbeing involved: > I was only assigned to the Research Vehicle (where there were German and some> Chinese scientists), which was not a “Military Vessel” and had quite a> different atmosphere.[264] [index_split_075.html#filepos804802] The Solar Warden research vessel appears more eclectic in its choice ofscientific personnel, in terms of foreign nationals being allowed to participatein its science missions. The military and security personnel, according toGoode, were assigned from the military vessels, again suggesting that these wereAmericans along with some Canadian, British and Australian personnel: > The “Security Personnel” were present but were under the authority of the more> Civilian and Scientific Minded Personnel (security referred to as “Egg Heads”> in a derogatory manor). While we were off the vessel, however, the security> personnel were in charge and made sure to take advantage of those> opportunities.

Even though most of the “Rank and File” came from> within the MILAB Recruiting Systems, the “Brass” were connected to the> Military (some very much Constitutional supporters and believers in their> “Oaths”). [267] [index_split_075.html#filepos806197] The oath taken by all officers from the seven U.S. uniformed services is touphold and protect the Constitution, and is obligatory under U.S. law: > I, [name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the> Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic;> that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this> obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and> that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I> am about to enter. So help me God.[268] [index_split_075.html#filepos806662] What is important to emphasize here is that the oath taken by officers isdifferent from the oath taken by enlisted personnel; the latter are required toobey lawful orders as prescribed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Incontrast, the oath taken by officers has no requirement to obey orders. This isvitally important for understanding how important Goode’s revelation that SolarWarden is run by career military officers, initially drawn largely from the U.S.Navy. As Goode says, many of these U.S. military officers take their oath toprotect the Constitution seriously, thereby making them difficult to subvert forunethical ends. Put simply, any order that violates the officer’s obligation “tosupport and defend the Constitution” will not be followed. This is the chiefreason why the U.S. Government has never been overthrown in a military coup inover 200 years!The officers in command of Solar Warden vessels, therefore, have a conventionalmilitary mind-set that influences how policies are carried out. Even though rankand file personnel in Solar Warden may have been covertly recruited through aMILAB program, as happened to Goode, their commanders are career militaryofficers who take their oath seriously. Ultimate allegiance is an issue that thespecial group was well aware of as they set up to run the reverse engineering ofNazi and alien projects under the project name, “Operation Majestic Twelve(MJ-12).” President Truman authorized the MJ-12 Group in a Memorandum, datedSeptember 24, 1947, to take control of the extraterrestrial issue and reportback directly to the President.[269] [index_split_075.html#filepos806994] Figure 21. Truman Memorandum authorizing Operation Majestic 12[images/00042.jpg] Over time, the MJ-12 Group became a rogue operation that defied PresidentEisenhower, and played a direct role in President Kennedy’s assassination whenhe demanded access to classified UFO files.[270][index_split_075.html#filepos807341]If the MJ-12 Group was to ultimatelyexercise control and operations over the U.S. secret space program, it wouldhave to find a way to marginalize the U.S. Navy, and allied military servicesfrom the U.S. and other nations. The way to do this was to create another secretspace program, using corporations, which would be more amenable to the dictatesof the MJ-12 Group.

Here is howone article summarized his lecture: > By the spring of 1983, he had added the flying saucer picture to the end of a> set of between 12 and 25 slides that he showed with his lecture.

Slide Ben Rich slowed when discussing taking ET home[images/00015.jpg] Rich’s comments were delivered as a joke, but one that carried a deep truth thathe could not publicly reveal. Lockheed Martin was working on advanced spacecraftthat would be capable of interstellar flight. A decade later, on March 23, 1993,at an engineering conference in Los Angeles, Rich modified his punchline to saythat “We now have the technology to take ET home.”[272][index_split_075.html#filepos808229] His punchline again drew laughter, but wasrevealing an important development over the last decade. During the 1980s,Lockheed Martin had succeeded in developing classified spacecraft capable ofinterstellar flight.It is worth pointing out that Rich’s Lockheed Martin was the successor companyreplacing Glenn Martin Corporation, which in the 1950’s had been excited by therevolutionary potential of antigravity technologies. Its CEO at the time,Trimble, spoke at length about the implications of antigravity research beforebeing silenced by government secrecy. The secrecy surrounding antigravityresearch extended also to the development of antigravity vehicles. Ben Richillustrates this point in a statement attributed to him:> > We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies> are locked up in black projects and it would take an act of God to ever get> them out to benefit humanity.... Anything you can imagine, we already know how> to do.[273] [index_split_075.html#filepos808752] Chapter five discussed Solar Warden, the first U.S. space program to useantigravity technologies for operations beyond an Earth orbit. While the U.S.Navy and its scientists would play a key role in the study of advanced Nazi SSand Vril Society flying saucers along with retrieved alien craft, they would notbuild the vehicles. That would be left to contractors such as Lockheed Martin,Northrup Grumman and other aerospace companies that specialized in thedevelopment and construction of advanced aerospace craft, or naval ships, forthe purpose of launching them. The U.S. military would provide the funding andtheir required specifications, and the aerospace companies would provide theresulting craft.Rich’s comments corroborate Goode’s claim that Solar Warden’s fleet ofcigar-shaped space carriers, capable of interstellar travel, came into operationin the late 1980’s. Lockheed Martin and a select group of aerospace contractorsnow had the technical know-how to build tachyon temporal drives for fleets ofclassified antigravity vehicles, using electrogravitics for propulsion, andMagnetic Field Disrupters for gravity cancellation. These companies couldsecretly build these interstellar antigravity vehicles to fulfill militarycontracts for the Navy, Air Force and other branches of the U.S. military.This is the same contractor arrangement the U.S. military used during the SecondWorld War, and it continues to the present day with Lockheed Martin’s F-35Fighter and Northrup Grumman’s Ford class aircraft carriers. The main differencein building a secret fleet of spacecraft is that security would be far morestringent and compartmentalized to prevent public knowledge.Compartmentalization would mean that only the major aerospace companies would beinvolved in assembling the components of the different spacecraft being built.Rich’s Lockheed Martin would be among the few aerospace companies that would seethe spacecraft being produced for the Solar Warden program. "},{"pageContent":"Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate The direct offshoot of Solar Warden and the military industrial base thatcreated the spacecraft for it was the emergence of an independent corporate runspace program. According to Corey Goode, it was called the InterplanetaryCorporate Conglomerate (ICC) which he summarized as follows:> > Focused mainly on development and acquisition of technology by any means.> Develop and produce technology for commerce with Earth and Off World Groups in> a barter system; and left nothing off the table that they were willing to> trade. Very powerful, very classified, and always had all of the latest> technology and “toys” at their disposal.[274]> [index_split_075.html#filepos809157] According to Goode, the successful infiltration by Nazi assets into the secretspace programs then being developed in the U.S. can be directly traced to theICC: > The NAZI Break Away/Secret Society Groups and their Allied ET/Ancient Break> Away Civilization Groups needed the massive industrial machine of the United> States that had defeated the Axis powers in World War II. They had the Science> and Technology covered, but they wanted to meet their goals of moving out into> the Sol System to colonize on a large scale and setup industrial facilities> and infrastructure across the Sol System; to mine materials and create what> they have today, which has been largely achieved through the ICC Group Effort.> [275] [index_split_075.html#filepos809722] Goode went on to describe the relationship between the ICC and theIlluminati/Cabal that has been in control of the Earth’s population andresources for generations: > When they had forced the hand of the United States to sign a treaty and create> a joint secret space program, they had already positioned operatives> throughout the Military, Intelligence, Aerospace and Corporate world. They> already had the Financial/Banking world in various society hands for> generations before World War I. These groups were all woven in and working> together with other groups that are under the Illuminati/Cabal Umbrella.[276]> [index_split_075.html#filepos810236] The development of the ICC has its origins in the United States, where largecorporations have traditionally supplied the U.S. military with advanced weaponssystems and technologies through military contracts. Collaborating with militaryscientists and research facilities, major corporations would study any newlyacquired technology in order to understand it, assess its potential weaponsapplications, reverse engineer it, and finally mass produce new weapons systems.This successful World War II military industrial collaborative model continuedwith the capture and repatriation of advanced Nazi technologies under OperationPaperclip. As extraterrestrial craft were also subsequently acquired, these,together with captured Nazi technologies, were secretly studied and reverseengineered in classified military and national security facilities in the U.S.Corporations were the providers of the necessary manufacturing expertise neededto build the reverse engineered space vehicles and weapons systems.A critical stage in the evolution of corporate influence in the study,reverse-engineering and manufacture of extraterrestrial and related technologieswas the creation of the S-4 facility located in a remote area of Nevada—owned bythe Department of Energy—later known as Area 51. Prior to the creation of S-4,the study and reverse engineering of extraterrestrial and related technologieswas done at classified US Air Force and US Navy facilities; such as WrightPatterson Air Force Base and China Lake Naval Facility. The creation of S-4changed that.The earliest documentation for the creation of S-4 is a 1951 newspaper article(see Figure 23) showing that $300 million was assigned to building anunderground facility at Indian Springs,[277][index_split_075.html#filepos810750] part of Nellis Air Force Base, which isadjacent to Area 51. The sum of 300 million dollars spent in 1951, according tothe American Institute for Economic Research, converts in 2015 terms to 2.7billion dollars.[278] [index_split_075.html#filepos811196]Chapter one discussed how ownership of the land where S-4 was located wastransferred in 1955, from the Department of Energy to the CIA, under theauthority of President Eisenhower. The CIA promptly built a classified spy planefacility at Groom Lake, which would act as a cover program for what washappening at the more highly classified S-4 facility located at the adjacentPapoose Lake facility.Lockheed Martin and other major military contractors assisted in the developmentof the CIA’s subsequent spyplanes—the U-2, SR-71 and OxCart—while also assistingin the study and reverse engineering of alien and other advanced technologies atS-4. By 1958, S-4 accommodated four captured Nazi flying saucers along withthree extraterrestrial spacecraft. Figure 23. Budget for possible S-4 construction near Indian Springs[images/00002.jpg] Beginning with the Eisenhower administration, corporations were supplyingvarious branches of the U.S. military with spacecraft and weapons systems forwhat, in the 1980’s, would evolve into the Solar Warden program. At the sametime, these corporations were developing significant technological assets thatcould be used for building another rival space program in the 1980’s, when theleap from interplanetary to interstellar travel became possible with thesuccessful development of temporal drive technology by Lockheed Martin and otheraerospace corporations. Military contractors could develop a small number ofadvanced spacecraft for development and testing purposes, without the U.S.military becoming too concerned. This was something that suited the long terminterests of the MJ-12 Group that was responsible for running extraterrestrialrelated projects.The MJ-12 Group understood that while it could eventually succeed in cutting theU.S. President out of the policymaking loop, it could not hope to do so with thecovert branches of the U.S. Military, especially the Navy which had a longhistory as protector of the U.S. Republic. The Solar Warden program would alwaysremain a U.S. military dominated space program, with its operations conformingto naval military traditions and constitutional norms. The MJ-12 Group insteaddecided to do a run-around the U.S. Navy and other military services. The MJ-12Group would secretly create another space program; out of the space assets fromthe private contractors who were supplying the U.S. Navy/military with thespacecraft and weapons for the Solar Warden program.The role of the CIA was critical in the evolution of a secret corporate spaceprogram, since it effectively shut out the executive branch of the U.S.government over what was happening at S-4 and the manufacturing centers of thePentagon’s corporate contractors. The CIA was acting under the direct authorityof the MJ-12 Group that was effectively taking President Eisenhower and the U.S.military out of the loop with regard to extraterrestrial related projects andthe emerging corporate run space program.In May 2013, former CIA agent, Stein/Kewper (now using the pseudonym‘anonymous’), revealed in video testimony before six retired members of the U.S.Congress that President Eisenhower quickly grew frustrated over his lack ofknowledge about what was happening at S-4.[279][index_split_075.html#filepos811497] Stein/Kewper alleged that PresidentEisenhower sought to gain information from the MJ-12 control group and calledabout alien related projects at the S-4 facility. When denied the requestedinformation, Eisenhower allegedly authorized a personal message thatStein/Kewper and his immediate superior would deliver to those in charge at Area51 and S-4. The message was a direct threat that the President would authorize amilitary invasion of Area 51 and S-4 if his request for information was notcarried out.A 15 minutes video segment was played out of a longer interview before theformer members of Congress, where Stein/Kewper went on the public record; it wasabout how he was recruited by a senior CIA operative located out of Langley,Virginia to work with the CIA on the issue of extraterrestrial life.[280][index_split_075.html#filepos812265] In response to questions from UFO historianRichard Dolan, Stein/Kewper then explained how in 1958, he and his boss—the CIAoperative—were summoned by President Eisenhower to the Oval Office. ThePresident, who was accompanied by Vice-President Nixon, told the agent and hisboss that regarding progress on the issue of extraterrestrial life andtechnology: “MJ-12 was supposed to find out, but they never sent reports tohim.”[281] [index_split_075.html#filepos812557] President Eisenhower said: > We called the people in from MJ-12, from Area 51 and S-4, but they told us> that the government had no jurisdiction over what they were doing…. I want you> and your boss to fly out there. I want you to give them a personal message…. I> want you to tell them, whoever is in charge, I want you to tell them that they> have this coming week to get into Washington and to report to me. And if they> don’t, I’m going to get the First Army from Colorado. We are going to go over> and take the base over. I don’t care what kind of classified material you got.> We are going to rip this thing apart.[282]> [index_split_075.html#filepos812852] Dolan asked the question, “Eisenhower was going to invade Area 51?” Stein/Kewperagain confirmed that Eisenhower indeed planned to do so with the FirstArmy.[283] [index_split_075.html#filepos813147]Stein/Kewper’s testimony of the seven flying saucer craft he saw at S-4 wasdiscussed earlier. He also described seeing a Gray alien at the S-4 facilitythat his boss “partially interviewed.”[284][index_split_075.html#filepos813442] Upon returning to the White House, theagent and his boss relayed what they had seen at S-4. Significantly, the FBIDirector, J. Edgar Hoover, was also present during the debriefing ofStein/Kewper and his boss over what they had witnessed at S-4 and Area-51.According to Stein/Kewper, Eisenhower was shocked by what he had learned.Basically, in the three years since Eisenhower had authorized the transfer ofArea 51, from the Atomic Energy Commission to the CIA, the latter had eitherbuilt or incorporated a pre-existing facility begun in 1952, to house flyingsaucer/extraterrestrial related projects.[285][index_split_075.html#filepos813737] Various corporations such as LockheedMartin would be involved in the highly classified reverse engineering projectsthat would be conducted at S-4. While the CIA provided the funding, security andinstitutional support for S-4 projects, it was the MJ-12 Group that wasultimately in charge of the projects at S-4. Yet MJ-12 was uncooperative insharing information with the President.Eisenhower’s decision to approach the CIA for information about what washappening at S-4 is very revealing. It shows that the most secretive informationconcerning flying saucer technologies and extraterrestrial life was no longerunder direct Presidential oversight, as it had been during the Trumanadministration. Now, it was being managed in a way that required the Presidentto go through the CIA to find out what was happening. The decision to givecontrol over security for Area 51 facilities to the CIA, rather than any of themilitary services, had quickly turned into a tragic mistake by Eisenhower. This,together with the reorganization of government recommended by NelsonRockefeller, gave the MJ-12 Group the institutional means to create its ownsecret space program outside of Presidential and U.S. military control.Stein/Kewper’s testimony identifies how unsatisfactory this arrangement hadbecome for the President. It was only through confronting MJ-12 with threats ofa military invasion that Eisenhower could learn what was happening at S-4. WhileEisenhower had succeeded in learning what was happening in 1958, it was only abrief tactical victory. As a military man, he knew the strategic consequences ofMJ-12 enjoying total autonomy at Area 51 and not reporting up the chain ofcommand. Eisenhower’s successors would not be able to resort to blunt militarythreats against MJ-12 and activities at Area 51 to maintain the chain ofcommand.Goode confirmed that the US Army had indeed been used to threaten the emergingcorporate space program as it was being created by MJ-12:> > I had access to quite a lot of information (through the “Smart Glass Pads”)> about the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, and their policies that> created the “Break Away Civilizations” we have now through the Military> Industrial Complex. There was mention of both U.S. Army and Marine Companies> that were trained and used more than once to threaten what would become the> Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate (ICC SSP) to open up their facilities> and information to “Federal Oversight”. This, however, ended later on, after> the ICC Groups gained enough power to take control over the Corporate U.S.> Government and in time most of the Pentagon and civilian intelligence> agencies.[286] [index_split_075.html#filepos814224] The rapid growth in the power of MJ-12 and the emerging corporate space programled to Eisenhower’s famous 1961 warning about the power of the MilitaryIndustrial Complex. > In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of> unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial> complex.

[287]> [index_split_075.html#filepos814789] Eisenhower briefed President Kennedy about the problem in far more detail thanwhat he publicly revealed.[288] [index_split_075.html#filepos815120] EventuallyKennedy was confident enough in his control over his administration to attemptre-establishing direct Presidential Executive authority over MJ-12 operations.In June 1961, Kennedy sent a Top Secret memo to the then CIA Director, AllenDulles, requesting access to MJ-12 operations.[289][index_split_075.html#filepos815390] In his response letter, Dulles refused togive Kennedy access to MJ-12 operations, and arranged for MJ-12 to adopt a setof directives, including an assassination directive, that could be used againstany U.S. official that threatened MJ-12 operations.[290][index_split_075.html#filepos815822] Kennedy’s subsequent efforts to assertPresidential authority over MJ-12 and associated secret space program relatedprojects were a direct factor in his 1963 assassination.[291][index_split_075.html#filepos816092] It also marked the beginning of completeMJ-12/Corporate control over the U.S. government, and much of the intelligencecommunity.As more advanced technologies became available during the Kennedy, Johnson andNixon administrations, the smaller MJ-12 corporate controlled space programcontinued to expand and develop more powerful spacecraft and weapons systems. Itwould, by the late 1990’s, eclipse the U.S. military’s Solar Warden program.This is consistent with Ben Rich’s claims that sometime during the 1980’s,Lockheed Martin had transitioned from studying how to get “ET back home”, to nowhaving “the technology to take ET home.”[292][index_split_075.html#filepos816355] The space travel technologies Rich wasalluding to led to the development of more technologically advanced craft thanthe initial interstellar space carriers developed for the Solar Warden programin the 1980’s.The growth of a secret corporate space program under the MJ-12 Group eventuallyled to the formation of the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate (ICC), whichGoode describes as a megacorporation by the time he began his covert service in1987: > The ICC-SSP is a HUGE INDUSTRY that has a HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE in space that> produces extremely high technology; not only for “Human Breakaway> Civilizations,” but also “civilizations from other star systems”. There is a> huge “Barter System” that is used “Out There” and the ICC-SSP has traded some> very “unsettling things and even been involved in human trafficking/trading”> to acquire “new technologies”; to then engineer and produce them for our Break> Away Civilizations, as well as for trading under treaties with other> civilizations.[293] [index_split_075.html#filepos816847] Goode’s description of the ICC as a corporate entity that develops high techproducts for other space programs and even other worlds is very revealing. Itsuggests that the ICC technological base far exceeds that of the Solar Wardenprogram, thereby making it a potential rival and threat to Solar Warden. Indeed,as will be discussed later, there have been violent clashes between the SolarWarden and ICC space programs.Goode’s revelation that the ICC trades “unsettling things,” including captivehumans for advanced technologies, is deeply disturbing. It suggests that the ICClacks any ethics in its trading methods and basically operates as anunscrupulous interstellar megacorporation in driving up its profits, interestsand influence. Again this leads to conflicts with the Solar Warden program,which is more likely to maintain U.S. Constitutional values and norms in thetreatment of civilians.In response to a question, Goode described how senior personnel from majoraerospace companies become heavily involved in the ICC, while retaining much oftheir corporate connections and influence: > Q. Are companies like Lockheed, Northrup Grumman, Boeing heavily involved in> the corporate space program, or more the traditional military run Solar Warden> program?> > A. There are, what are called; “Super Boards” or “Super Committees”. Usually> what happens is that ALL of these very well-known Government contracting> corporations that we know of (and some we do not) have a standing board member> that will “retire” and roll off their corporate board and then join one of the> ICC-SSP corporate boards (Super Committees). They are then out of the> limelight and still have their “corporate pull and connections”.[294]> [index_split_076.html#filepos817412] According to Goode, in secret negotiations with the Truman and Eisenhoweradministrations, Operation Paperclip Nazi scientists rose in leadershippositions in the military industrial complex. This led to major corporationsthat make up the ICC being infiltrated. Many were assets for the VrilSociety/Nazi SS group that survived the Second World War, and ultimately gavebirth to the “Dark Fleet.”With the emergence of the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate, many of itssenior personnel, along with the MJ-12 Group, have been historically alignedwith the Dark Fleet—which Goode claims operates primarily outside of our solarsystem. He says that there is another secret space program that operates outsideof our solar system; whose genesis and composition is very different than theDark Fleet. Goode describes it as the fourth of the five main secret spaceprograms indigenous to our contemporary Earth culture: the “Global GalacticLeague of Nations” Secret Space Program. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter7 Global Galactic League of Nations Space Program Ronald Reagan’s Presidential Diary entry for June 11, 1985 referred to a secretspace program that could place 300 astronauts in space, as earlier discussed inthe introduction.[295] [index_split_076.html#filepos817977] Subsequent publiccomments by President Reagan reveal that he had also been briefed about anotherclassified space related topic by his national security advisors; anextraterrestrial threat to humanity.There is an alleged transcript of a briefing Reagan received in 1981 about alienlife by his national security advisors that included his CIA Director, WilliamCasey. In the transcript, he is told about five groups of extraterrestrialsvisiting humanity, one of which is hostile: > PRESIDENT: I'm the President of the United States. I should know if we are> endangered by some THREAT FROM OUTER SPACE. If you have something to say about> a threat posed by this one species of aliens, then I want to hear it. > WM CASEY: .… We have captured one of these hostile aliens. This gets into some> very, very sensitive areas, Mr. President... I don't think we are prepared to> provide you with accurate answers to your questions about the potentially> hostile aliens at this time. > PRESIDENT: OK, but expect this to be given to me as soon as possible. I want> to KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THESE HOSTILE CREATURES so I .... or I mean we should> start forming policies on how to deal with them … do we have operational war> plans on this?” > Advisor #1: “Yes, Mr. President, we have war plans on all potential threats to> our country.”[296] [index_split_076.html#filepos818313] While there is much controversy over the legitimacy of the 1981 Reagan Briefingtranscript, subsequent public comments by Reagan suggest it is eithersubstantially accurate, or he received a very similar national security briefingat some other time. On November 19-20, 1985, five months after his lunch with the five scientiststhat briefed him about the U.S. secret space program, Reagan met the SovietUnion’s Secretary General, Mikhail Gorbachev, in Geneva, Switzerland. This iswhat Reagan recollected telling Gorbachev, which he related in a December 4,1985 speech given at Fallston High School: > ... when you stop to think that we're all God's children, wherever we may live> in the world, I couldn't help but say to him, just think how easy his task and> mine might be in these meetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat to> this world from some other species from another planet outside in the> universe. We'd forget all the little local differences that we have between> our countries and we would find out once and for all that we really are all> human beings here on this earth together.[297]> [index_split_076.html#filepos819112] Later, on February 17, 1987, Gorbachev described his response to Reagan’s alienthreat scenario: > At our meeting in Geneva, the U.S. President said that if the earth faced an> invasion by extraterrestrials, the United States and the Soviet Union would> join forces to repel such an invasion. I shall not dispute the hypothesis,> though I think it's early yet to worry about such an intrusion... [298]> [index_split_076.html#filepos819542] Gorbachev was interested in future cooperation in the face of a concrete alienthreat, but thought the idea was premature. Clearly, the Soviet leader didn’ttake such a threat seriously at the time.Not deterred by the Soviet leader’s dismissal of the alien threat scenario,Reagan tried again, on September 21, 1987, in a speech before a full session ofthe United Nations General Assembly: > In our obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we often forget how much> unites all the members of humanity. Perhaps we need some outside, universal> threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly> our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from> outside this world.[299] [index_split_076.html#filepos820013] What is significant in his UN speech is that Reagan’s speech writer, RhettDawson, removed his alien threat comments from an earlier draft of his speech.In hand written notes, Reagan insisted that Dawson put them back in:> > I think there is too much anti-Soviet preaching in view of what we are trying> to achieve right now. And toward the end perhaps I still would like my> “fantasy:” – how quickly our differences world wide would vanish if creatures> from another planet should threaten this world.[300]> [index_split_076.html#filepos820449] As his handwriting reveals, Reagan clearly believed his alien threat “fantasy”was an important means of achieving global cooperation. The alleged 1981 Reaganbriefing document, or a similar classified briefing, would explain why Reaganbelieved such a threat was genuine. Reagan’s speech writer was not in the loopwhich explains why he attempted to remove the “alien threat” reference. Figure 24. Source: PresidentialUFO.com[images/00022.jpg] Reagan’s reference to a hypothetical alien threat at Geneva in 1985, at theUnited Nations in 1987, and handwritten notes to his speech writer, iscompelling evidence that he had developed a firm belief that U.S. and Sovietcooperation was essential in responding to a genuine alien threat. Theseriousness that Reagan attached to such a threat is further revealed in hisresponse to a question he received in Chicago on May 4, 1988. Reagan was asked:\"What do you consider to be the most important need in international relations?\"His reply included the following: > \"But I've often wondered, what if all of us in the world discovered that we> were threatened by an outer—a power from outer space, from another planet…> Wouldn't we all of a sudden find that we didn't have any differences between> us at all, we were all human beings, citizens of the world, and wouldn't we> come together to fight that particular threat?\"[301]> [index_split_076.html#filepos820828] Gorbachev was almost certainly aware of the secret space program Reagan hadwritten about in his June 11, 1985 diary entry. The U.S. program would have beenclosely associated with the Strategic Defense Initiative, which was a greatconcern to the Soviets because they would have to create their own rival programat great cost. With his Geneva and United Nations speeches, was Reagan subtlyoffering Gorbachev some of the advanced technology of the secret U.S. spaceprogram, in return for the Soviets cooperating on the alien threat scenariowhich required ending the Cold War? Later events suggest Reagan was doingprecisely that.Repeated efforts by Reagan to warn about the urgency of the world bondingtogether to face a hypothetical alien threat apparently broke through the Sovietleader’s initial reluctance, and gained the support of other world leaders afterhis 1987 United Nations speech. According to Corey Goode, Reagan’s commentcoincided with the United Nations agreeing to form its own secret space program.In response to a question about the origins of this program, Goode said: > It seems to have been born out of a United Nations agreement. The beginning of> this program coincides with a particular speech given to the U.N. by President> Reagan that mentions how quickly we would come together if there were an alien> threat.[302] [index_split_076.html#filepos821234] If Goode is correct, then Reagan’s speech sparked a behind-the-scenes effort bythe United Nations to bond all nations together in a secret space program, whichwould interact with extraterrestrial life and other existing space programs. "},{"pageContent":"Circumstantial Evidence in Support of the Galactic League of Nations Goode has offered no documents for his claims that an agreement was reached in1987, for the creation of a United Nations run secret space program. Nor has thealleged 1981 briefing transcript warning Reagan about hostile aliens beenconfirmed. It is a historical fact, however, that since 1985 President Reaganhad been advocating superpower cooperation to deal with a hypothetical alienthreat. This climaxed with his offer to the United Nations General Assembly inSeptember 1987 to cooperate globally to deal with such a threat.There is powerful circumstantial evidence that Reagan’s offer was secretlyaccepted and an agreement was reached just as Goode claims. A little over twoyears from Reagan’s offer at the United Nations, the Cold War division of Europecame to an end. The Berlin Wall, which separated East and West Berlin, cametumbling down on November 10, 1989. The Communist bloc of nations quicklydissolved, with each new government embracing democratic ideals and capitalisteconomies. Even the Soviet Union, itself, underwent a dissolution into theRussian Federation and 14 other independent nations on December 26, 1991. Thenew democratic nation of Russia was now led by President Boris Yeltsin.The quick end to the Cold War caught scholars, political leaders, andintelligence agencies off guard. No one had predicted that the Cold War wouldend, and certainly not in the rapid manner witnessed by a stunned globalpopulation. Europeans, Americans and the rest of the world were mystified. Whatcould explain the unthinkable chain of events that led to the end of the ColdWar? Many books have been written, many theories proposed, but none reallyconclusively explaining why it happened.Reagan’s hypothetical alien threat scenario—and encouragement to the UnitedNations to secretly develop a space program in response—had achieved theunthinkable. The Cold War division of Europe was over, and an unprecedented eraof global cooperation began between former Eastern and Western bloc nations. Theshiny symbol of this new era was a fleet of interstellar spacecraft carrying theflags of United Nations member states deep into the galaxy. "},{"pageContent":"Building the Global Galactic League of Nations Reagan undoubtedly had offered the Soviets and other world leaders highlyadvanced technologies from the secret U.S. space program for such an agreementto be reached. The price for getting key United Nations Permanent SecurityCouncil members, such as the Soviet Union and China, on board would be quitehigh. If the U.S. already had a secret space program, much or all of theadvanced technology would have to be shared. An agreement would also have to bereached in how the U.S. run secret space program would coordinate with theproposed United Nations program in terms of primary responsibilities and coreactivities in outer space. Apparently, this was successfully done.The development of a secret United Nations space program is not that surprising.In finding, recovering and exploiting extraterrestrial, Nazi or other similarlyadvanced technologies found anywhere in the world, the US would require thesupport of the international community. This would especially be the case withmajor nations that had invested heavily in developing civilian run spaceprograms that had achieved success in launching satellites and/or space probes.Countries such as Russia, France, Germany, Italy, China, India, Brazil, Japan,and others had significant space expertise and would be prepared to investheavily into studying any advanced technologies that came into their possession.In order to gain a nation’s full cooperation in maintaining secrecy abouttechnologies related to extraterrestrial life and/or Nazi Germany, it would haveto be given a significant stake in the final product being created—advancedspacecraft capable of interstellar travel.There would be limited opportunities for covert international cooperation in theSolar Warden space program. Its military command structure was firmly modeled onthe U.S. Navy. As explained by Goode in chapter five, military personnel fromthe five echelon countries—USA, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand comprisedpersonnel on the offensive/defensive fleet belonging to Solar Warden.[303][index_split_076.html#filepos821774] While Goode described seeing German andChinese scientists on the Solar Warden research vessel, Arnold Sommerfeld, hemade it clear that they were part of a civilian/scientific system of authority,which was separate to the military command structure that security personnelbelonged to.[304] [index_split_076.html#filepos822189] An analogy would be thefictional television series, Stargate Atlantis, which exemplified how overallcivilian control could be exercised over a classified facility, while securitypersonnel operated within a traditional military chain of command.There would be far more limited opportunities in the secret corporate run spaceprogram controlled by the MJ-12 group, which had its own separate covertinternational system for funding and building advanced spacecraft. While majorcorporations supplying personnel, technologies and resources for theInterplanetary Corporate Conglomerate could be based anywhere in the world,their opaque operations and questionable national loyalties made them unsuitablepartners for many nations intent on becoming part of a secret space program.As for the Dark Fleet, its forerunner, the Vril Society/Nazi SS space program,had been very active in South America, and was associated with policies ofracial purity and eugenics. Over the decades, South American Fascist regimesthat had previously collaborated with Nazi Germany and its breakaway spaceprogram, adopted more democratic political systems that steered away from Naziideals of racial purity and eugenics. The Nazi inspired ideology, occulthistory, eugenics policies, and mysterious space operations, made the Dark Fleetan unsuitable partner for newly democratic South American nations. This was evenmore so with many other nations that were openly opposed to the former NaziGermany regime and its racial purity ideals.At some point, it became clear that yet another secret space program would haveto be created with a mission and parameters that would satisfy internationalpartners that were not adequately represented in the three secret space programspreviously discussed: the Dark Fleet, Solar Warden and the InterplanetaryCorporate Conglomerate. Reagan’s 1987 speech was the catalyst for thedevelopment of such a program.Goode called this fourth space program the “Global Galactic League of NationsSpace Program,” which he summarized as follows: > “NATO TYPE SSP”—Recently in Alliance Conferences they were referred to as the> “[Global Galactic] League of Nations Program.” Apparently this was the one> where, I arrived and, all of the people were relaxed in another Sol System and> were from MANY different countries. There were literally more flags on their> shoulders than I could identify (countries like Estonia etc.). This group was> based almost entirely outside of the Sol System and was a relatively newer> SSP; that was created for all countries to participate in, have exchange of> information and technology, and to encourage the countries to keep silent on> the SSP Programs.[305] [index_split_076.html#filepos822604] Goode’s claim that this Secret Space Program operates mainly outside of thesolar system suggests it uses an advanced version of the “Thule Tachyonator”drive developed for the cigar-shaped “Andromeda Devices” pioneered by the VrilSociety and Nazi SS around 1943. In chapter six, it was revealed that accordingto Goode and Ben Rich, the temporal drive technology necessary for interstellartravel only became available in the 1980’s. Solar Warden gained the firstcigar-shaped space carriers with temporal drives in the 1980’s, and was followedby the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate that used more advanced temporaldrive interstellar ships in the 1990’s. This suggests that using Reagan’s 1987speech as a starting point, by the late 1990’s or early 2000’s, the GalacticLeague of Nations SSP began to send its first craft outside our solar system.All major United Nations member states would have contributed significantscientific, political, financial and/or human resources to this fourth secretspace program. "},{"pageContent":"Global Galactic League of Nations Space Program and the Dark Fleet Goode’s claim that the Global Galactic League of Nations Secret Space Programoperates outside the solar system furthermore suggests that it is primarily anexplorer-type program in the model of the fictional Star Trek series. Mainlyoperating outside of the Solar System, it would be unlikely to come intoconflict with the other two main programs operating within the Solar System:Solar Warden and the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate. This does raise thequestion of how the Global Galactic League of Nations SSP would interact withthe Dark Fleet, both of which operate outside of the solar system according toGoode. Would they coordinate in any way?The Dark Fleet, Goode reports, is aligned with an imperialist entity: theDraconian Empire/Federation. Could the Dark Fleet and Global Galactic League ofNations operate as a kind of galactic good cop/bad cop while performinginterstellar operations?Goode has described how Nazi scientists were successful in infiltratingmilitary, scientific and corporate institutions in the U.S. Chapter sixdiscussed how the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate had been deeplyinfiltrated by the Vril Society/Nazi SS, and closely cooperated with the DarkFleet. Goode also said that the Solar Warden program was infiltrated to anextent, and worked cooperatively with the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerateuntil the full scope of the latter’s deception became apparent. This suggeststhat something similar would almost certainly have happened with the GlobalGalactic League of Nations SSP if Goode’s testimony is accurate.Chapter 11 will discuss a solar system wide quarantine that Goode describes asthe “outer barrier”, recently imposed by a newly arrived extraterrestrialalliance. This “outer barrier” has likely impacted on the relationship betweenthe UN run Global Galactic League of Nations (GGLN) and the Dark Fleet, as Goodeexplains: > Before the outer barrier went up the GGLN kept almost entirely to themselves.> I am certain that they have fallen on hard times since the outer barrier was> erected and it is more than possible that they have pooled resources or gotten> in contact with the large number of Dark Fleet assets that were also trapped> outside the barrier.[306] [index_split_076.html#filepos823019] There are no documents referring to a League of Nations type secret spaceprogram operating outside of the solar system to confirm Goode’s claims.However, there is compelling circumstantial evidence that the End of the ColdWar was a consequence of President Reagan’s efforts to engineer globalcooperation in response to an alien threat. The creation of a Global GalacticLeague of Nations would have directly addressed such a threat, and also sparkedincreased global cooperation; a direct factor to the end of the Cold War. Thisleads to the final of the five secret space programs described by Goode. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter8 Rogue SAPs, the Cabal/Illuminati & Advanced Space Technologies Corey Goode described a number of smaller secret space programs that differeddramatically in size and scope from the four programs revealed in chapters fourto seven. He summarizes these smaller programs as follows: > Various Special Access Program SSP’s that were small, usually had the newer> technology, very secretive and worked for some of the Secret Earth> Governments, Syndicates and World Military Forces (there could be several> independent groups in this category). In the United States, Special Access Programs (SAPs) are authorized by theDepartment of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community. Some of theseclassified programs are “unacknowledged” in so far as their existence is notpublicly admitted. According to a 1995 DoD Manual titled: “National IndustrialSecurity Program Operating Manual”: > There are two types of SAPs, acknowledged and unacknowledged. An acknowledged> SAP is a program which may be openly recognized or known; however, specifics> are classified within that SAP. The existence of an unacknowledged SAP or an> unacknowledged portion of an acknowledged program, will not be made known to> any person not authorized for this information.[307]> [index_split_076.html#filepos823559] The DoD Manual goes on to clarify the measures taken to keep secret theexistence of unacknowledged programs: > Unacknowledged SAPs require a significantly greater degree of protection than> acknowledged SAPs... A SAP with protective controls that ensures the existence> of the Program is not acknowledged, affirmed, or made known to any person not> authorized for such information. All aspects (e.g., technical, operational,> logistical, etc.) are handled in an unacknowledged manner.[308]> [index_split_076.html#filepos824160] In addition to the stringent security requirements pertaining to anUnacknowledged SAP (USAP), these may be further classified by making them WaivedUSAPs. According to a 1997 Senate investigation: > Among black programs, further distinction is made for “waived” programs,> considered to be so sensitive that they are exempt from standard reporting> requirements to the Congress. The chairperson, ranking member, and, on> occasion, other members and staff of relevant Congressional committees are> notified only orally of the existence of these programs.[309]> [index_split_076.html#filepos824541] A strictly oral briefing about a program that is so classified, that U.S.congressional members and others learning about it cannot admit to its existenceor consult others for expert advice, means that USAP’s have no effectivecongressional oversight placed upon them. Congress has to take the word of thesponsoring military service or intelligence agency that the program is being runresponsibly and in accord with U.S. and international space laws. Indeed, anymember is authorized to deny the existence of such a program, and/or refer to acover story. In this regard, a 1992 supplement to an earlier version of the DoDManuel states: > Program Cover stories. (UNACKNOWLEDGED Program). Cover stories may be> established for unacknowledged programs in order to protect the integrity of> the program from individuals who do not have a need to know. Cover stories> must be believable and cannot reveal any information regarding the true nature> of the contract. Cover stories for Special Access Programs must have the> approval of PSO [Program Security Officer] prior to dissemination.[310]> [index_split_076.html#filepos825019] The second category of unacknowledged space activities pertains to privatecorporations that invoke similar security procedures as the U.S. military orintelligence agencies as a condition for working on highly classified contracts.These industry standard security procedures by the DoD are outlined in the“National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual.” Here is how the 1997U.S. Senate Report summarizes the situation: > Industrial contractors performing classified contracts are governed by the> National Industrial Security Program (NISP), created in 1993 by Executive> Order 12829 to “serve as a single, integrated, cohesive industrial security> program to protect classified information.” A Supplement to the NISP operating> manual (NISPOM) was issued in February 1995 with a “menu of options” from> which government program managers can select when establishing standards for> contractors involved with special access programs.[311]> [index_split_076.html#filepos825443] It is common for national militaries and intelligence agencies to awardcontracts to private corporations for conducting aspects of unacknowledgedprograms, including those related to space activities. Lockheed Martin, NorthropGrumman, Science Applications International Corporation and General Dynamics area few of the many U.S. companies that are awarded military/intelligencecontracts for research and development on highly classified programs, some ofwhich involve space activity.Other major space faring states have their own equivalents to USAPs involvingunacknowledged space activities conducted by national militaries andintelligence organizations, with the assistance of private corporatecontractors. The scope and budgets of these officially sanctioned unacknowledgedspace programs are not well known, and traditionally are part of the nebulousworld of “black programs” that are funded in opaque ways.There are studies that do address the funding of black programs. Among these isTim Cook’s, Blank Check: The Pentagon's Black Budget.[312][index_split_076.html#filepos825828] It has been estimated that an “unofficialblack budget” averaged as much as US $1.7 trillion between the years1997-1999.[313] [index_split_076.html#filepos826051]Goode’s description of the fifth secret space program as comprising a number ofSpecial Access Programs suggests that some of these SAPs have functionallybecome rogue operations in their respective countries or corporate operations.Due to stringent security procedures where senior officials in government orcorporations have to lie and use cover stories to hide the existence of SAPs,these programs can operate with minimal oversight or external interference. The nature of waived unacknowledged SAPs makes is possible for their programmanagers to go outside the traditional funding processes set up for them,thereby gaining more independence from the government agencies, corporatedepartments, etc., that originally created them. With their own independentfunding mechanisms, individuals, groups or corporations running the SAPs wouldhave an extraordinary degree of autonomy. The program managers of these SAPscould operate similarly to a feudal baron, whose interests and activities maydifferent greatly with the King or central authority. These rogue operationscould collaborate with one another, much as feudal barons did in the past, inorder to evade scrutiny or interference by the four main space programsdescribed earlier: Dark Fleet, Solar Warden, Interplanetary CorporateConglomerate, and the League of Nations SSP.Dr. Steven Greer, and former Apollo Astronaut, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, havedescribed an interview they had with Vice Admiral Tom Wilson in 1997, whenWilson was J-2; head of the Intelligence division of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.When advised of various SAPs involving possible extraterrestrial technology,Wilson was denied access to these, by attorneys representing corporatecontractors, since he did not have a “need to know”.[314][index_split_076.html#filepos826479] Such unprecedented action, restricting asitting head of intelligence of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, demonstrates thatrogue corporate entities keep advanced technologies away from military andgovernmental oversight. This confirms the existence of SAPs that are controlledby corporate entities, which are either rogue operations or coordinating withthe MJ-12 Group outside of any military chain of command.Furthermore, the leaders of these rogue SAPs work closely with human elitescomprising the Cabal or Illuminati or “shadow government.” These rogue SAPsprovide the Cabal an ideal way to assassinate non-cooperative leaders,manufacture false flag operations, or create global catastrophes that overwhelmdifferent nations. As far as assassination is concerned, Derek Hennessy (akaConnor O’Ryan) revealed that during his eight/nine years of covert service withSAPs associated with the CIA, he was regularly asked to conduct assassinationmissions against anyone who threatened the secrecy system developed forextraterrestrial life and the secret space programs.[315][index_split_076.html#filepos826700] Hennessy claims that he was trained as aNavy Seal, and was assigned to the CIA for special operations. Down time fromthese assassination missions was spent as a guard at the S-4 facility at Area51.As far as SAPs conducting false flag operations, a good example is the September11, 2001 false flag operation that was created to facilitate a number ofregional wars, which would facilitate black budget funding for covert spaceoperations.[316] [index_split_076.html#filepos827066] It is not coincidentalthat the 911 attack happened the day after U.S. Secretary of Defense, DonaldRumsfeld, announced that over a trillion dollars could not be adequatelyaccounted for in the Pentagon budget.[317] [index_split_076.html#filepos827436]According to Dr. Judy Wood, a former professor of mechanical engineering, the911 attack used “directed free-energy technology” from space based weaponssystems.[318] [index_split_076.html#filepos827852] It is arguably in the area ofartificial intelligence that rogue SAPs present the most dire set ofchallenges—both to humanity and the secret space programs described so far. "},{"pageContent":"Rogue SAPs and Artificial Intelligence It has been revealed that the Jade Helm 15 military exercise, scheduled to runfrom July 15 – September 15, 2015, used Artificial Intelligence (AI) quantumcomputer technology to remove the human element from top-level control overbattlefield decision making. Jade Helm 15 was conducted by U.S. SpecialOperations Command, which has a long history of involvement in SAPs, some ofwhich are rogue operations.[319] [index_split_076.html#filepos828108] Hennessy,as described earlier, worked in a rogue SAP based out of S-4, which coordinatedwith Special Operations Command in recruiting personnel like Hennessy.According to a computer network/software engineer who used the pseudonym, “DJ,”Jade Helm was a test to see how successful AI is in anticipating civilianresponses to military efforts to assert hegemony over a domestic battlefieldscenario where civilians are in open revolt.[320][index_split_076.html#filepos828779] If successful, Jade Helm would enable elitepolicy makers to eventually replace human generals and admirals with AI quantumcomputers programmed to master the “human domain,” which is defined as the“’physical, cultural and social environments’ that exist within aconflict.”[321] [index_split_076.html#filepos829103] Figure 25. Logo for Jade Helm 15 exercise. Source: US Army Special OperationsCommand[images/00024.jpg] Here is how DJ described Jade Helm: > “JADE” is an AI quantum computing technology that produces holographic> battlefield simulations that has the ability to use vast amounts of data being> collected on the human domain to generate human terrain systems in geographic> population centric locations to identify and eliminate targets, insurgents,> rebels or whatever labels that can be flagged as targets on a Global> Information Grid in Network Centric Warfare environments.

It is a cognitive software based Network Centric Warfare System at> the HELM.[322] [index_split_076.html#filepos829558] If DJ’s analysis is correct, the Jade Helm 15 is a cause for great concern, asexpressed by a number of prominent scientists and inventors who have pointed outthe existential threat posed by Artificial Intelligence. In this regard, ElonMusk said in October 2014: > I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to> guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that. So we> need to be very careful with artificial intelligence. I'm increasingly> inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the> national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something> very foolish.[323] [index_split_076.html#filepos829984] Stephen Hawking has said that AI, by its very nature, will usurp human decisionmakers and eventually take over humanity. According to Stephen Hawking, “Thedevelopment of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the humanrace.\"[324] [index_split_076.html#filepos830454] This could easily lead tohumanity being eradicated. A number of industry and military papers, describingvarious aspects of quantum computing and its application to battlefieldscenarios, point to Jade Helm 15 which does indeed make it possible to replacehuman generals and admirals at the helm of decision making.[325][index_split_076.html#filepos830843]Adding a deeper level of complexity to the analysis of Jade Helm 15 and thedanger posed by AI; are Corey Goode’s claims that the space programs he servedwith have identified an Alien “AI signal” as an existential threat. Goodedescribes elaborate security protocols that have been put in place to detect andeliminate the “AI signal,” that not only has the ability to infiltrate advancedtechnology, but also biological systems. > The best way to avoid the dangers of AI is to educate yourself on the> potentials they have to cause a loss of sovereignty.

This is something that is screened for even> currently when operators and guests arrive at SSP [Secret Space Program]> Facilities and is something that other ET Groups take seriously as well.[326]> [index_split_076.html#filepos831261] Goode says extraterrestrial civilizations have much experience in observing howAI has taken over countless other worlds, and led to the eradication of theindigenous population that created the AI. Essentially Goode is claiming thatthe storyline of the 2004 science fiction series, Battlestar Galactica, is morescience than fiction: > Those who are AI Prophets are already working on a timeline to create a> society completely dependent on technology that at one point will hand its> sovereignty over to this “AI God” because it will be believed that this AI is> the only thing that can rule the world from a neutral perspective and bring> world peace for the first time. These AI Prophets have been shown the> information of the thousands of other civilizations that have fallen for this> trickster god model and were all destroyed.[327]> [index_split_076.html#filepos831766] DJ’s recent analyses of Jade Helm and role of AI is compelling, as it presents asystem/computer engineer’s analysis of the role quantum computers are playingnot only for the military exercise, but for top-level human decision making to“master the human domain.” The final result, if quantum computer based AI isallowed to take over top level decision making in future battles, could well bethe take over of humanity as predicted by Musk, Hawking and others. Not onlydoes Jade Helm 15 open the door to AI taking over decision making in battlefieldsituations and mastering the human domain; but, if we include Goode’sdisclosures, it will allow an alien AI signal to infiltrate human elitesresponsible for building quantum computing systems.There is evidence that the AI signal described by Goode has already infiltratedand taken over elite human groups proposing the development of ArtificialIntelligence in more and more aspects of the “human domain.” For example,co-founder and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, said on July 1, 2015, that hebelieves that AI is “”better than humans at our primary senses,” suggesting thatAI is better than humans in processing and making decisions about the sensorydata from our natural environment.[328] [index_split_076.html#filepos832271]Zuckerberg’s claims are supported by Google Director for Engineering, RayKurzweil, who said on June 3, 2015, that by 2030 most humans will have nanobotsimplanted in the brain to augment human intelligence in order to access thecloud internet and perform other complex tasks.[329][index_split_076.html#filepos832657] Kurzweil believes that in the future,humans will integrate AI into their biology: > Our thinking then will be a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking…> We’re going to gradually merge and enhance ourselves. In my view, that’s the> nature of being human—we transcend our limitations.[330]> [index_split_076.html#filepos833147] At the annual Bilderberg Group meeting held on June 11-14, 2015, ArtificialIntelligence was at the top of the list of topics to be discussed, and wasfollowed by Cybersecurity.[331] [index_split_076.html#filepos833615] Informationtechnology companies were well represented among the participants, suggestingthis elite global group was intent on promoting AI—to find new ways to “masterthe human domain.” It is worth emphasizing that the Bilderberg Group representsthe interests of the same Cabal/Illuminati groups controlling many rogue SAPsinvolved in various space activities.The advanced technologies under development in SAPs, working to supply the fourmajor secret space programs, could be applied in ways that enhance the power ofthese rogue operations and their program managers. This would lead to shiftingalliances and influence among the various SAPs working with other secret spaceprograms, and their own relations with the Cabal/Illuminati. One or more ofthese rogue SAPs may view AI as technology that would give it a tacticaladvantage over other space programs less disposed to using such technology. Thenebulous operations and loyalties of SAPs working on secret space programtechnologies, along with their involvement in promoting AI, certainly make themunpredictable small actors in what collectively constitutes a fifth secret spaceprogram as Goode described it. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter9 U.S. Government Suppression of a Civilian Space Program In 1955, Otis T. Carr, a protégé of Nikola Tesla, began a highly visible publiceffort to develop a prototype civilian spacecraft that could be mass produced inkits and sold to the public.[332] [index_split_076.html#filepos833945] Ifsuccessful, Carr would have developed what he believed would be the world’sfirst civilian spacecraft, which would have revolutionized the aviationindustry. Little did Carr know that his private civilian effort had in fact beenpreceded nearly thirty years earlier by the Vril Society’s flying saucerprototypes developed with the assistance of Dr. W. O. Schumman. The Vril Societyprogram would eventually be overwhelmed by events leading up to the Second WorldWar. While the Vril Society did collaborate with Hitler’s Nazi regime, itmaintained a degree of independence and civilian (secret society) controlthroughout the Second World War. The Vril Society’s secret space programsurvived the war, and established bases in Antarctica, South America and eventhe Moon. Eventually, it gave birth to what Corey Goode described as the “DarkFleet,” which was largely an occult driven space program that worked with asinister group of extraterrestrials.The Vril Society’s efforts were likely paralleled by another civilian spaceprogram led by Guglielmo Marconi. There have long been rumors of a civilianeffort to build flying saucers in South America led by Marconi; whose death, in1937, was faked.[333] [index_split_076.html#filepos834779] According toindependent archeology researcher, David Hatcher Childress, Marconi’s death wasa cover for him moving to Venezuela to start a futuristic project away from thelooming European war: > Ninety-eight scientists were said to have gone to South America where they> built a city in an extinct volcanic crater in the southern jungles of> Venezuela. In their secret city, financed by the great wealth they had created> during their lives, they continued Marconi's work on solar energy, cosmic> energy, and anti-gravity. Working secretly and apart from the world's nations,> they built free-energy motors and ultimately discoid aircraft with a form of> gyroscopic anti-gravity.[334] [index_split_076.html#filepos835024] In chapter three, it was observed that Marconi was appointed by Benito Mussolinito head the group RS-33 that was set up to study and reverse engineer a flyingsaucer discovered in 1933. The expertise Marconi acquired in leading the Italianflying saucer program made it very possible for him to set up a civilian programin a remote location away from the watchful eye of Mussolini’s government.Marconi had acquired independent funding from his early inventions, and had manyscientists and inventors working with him. His famous yacht, the Electra, wasbasically a floating laboratory where leading thinkers could experiment.Furthermore, Marconi had a deep distrust of government authorities that wereintent on creating advanced weapons of war, rather than uplifting the humancondition. It is, therefore, very possible that Marconi faked his death tolaunch a civilian effort to build flying saucers from remote South Americanlocations. Marconi’s civilian effort in South America may have looselycooperated with the Vril Society program after it had to relocate from Germany.According to Goode, Marconi’s civilian effort was eventually either covertly orovertly coopted by the Vril Society/Nazi SS that had deep tentacles throughoutthe South American continent.[335] [index_split_076.html#filepos835386]Neither of the civilian spacecraft programs pioneered by the Vril Society, andlikely Marconi, ever became widespread public knowledge. Both programs wereconducted in secrecy, and it would only be elite individuals that would haveaccess to the spacecraft built by these programs.Otis Carr’s effort, therefore, was the third time that a civilian based flyingsaucer program was attempted—if Marconi’s alleged program is included. Unlikethe Vril Society and Marconi programs, Carr intended to make public his effortto build flying saucers. Carr hoped that his efforts would lead to a civilianspacecraft program in a similar way that the Wright brothers pioneered the firstaircraft.The vehicle that Carr planned to build was to be powered by a generator drawingelectrical energy from the environment, to be then stored in special coils. Thestored electrical energy would have produced an antigravity effect forpropulsion.[336] [index_split_076.html#filepos835857] Carr claimed he was taughtall he knew about electromagnetic energy and antigravity principles by thefamous Yugoslav inventor, Nikola Tesla. The inventor had resided in a New Yorkhotel where Carr worked part time while completing his studies. Tesla hadpublicly stated in 1915 that he knew how to build an antigravity flying vehicle:\"My flying machine will have neither wings nor propellers. You might see it onthe ground, and you would never guess that it was a flying machine. Yet it willbe able to move at will through the air in any direction with perfectsafety.\"[337] [index_split_076.html#filepos836306] Tesla’s flying vehicle wouldbe powered by electrical energy drawn from the earth’s atmosphere. Subsequentlyfrustrated by the lack of industry support, Tesla revealed his radical ideas tothe young Carr over a three year period.Tesla taught Carr how electromagnetic energy could be freely harnessed from theabundant electrical energy in the atmosphere. The possibility that electricalenergy could be freely acquired—without expensive power plants, conductivewires, relay stations, telephone poles and significant power loss—challengedconventional power companies. Tesla was told that his radical ideas would not befunded. J.P. Morgan and other industrialists would not be able to meter the freeelectrical energy to be drawn from the atmosphere. Indeed, Tesla’s ideaschallenged the foundations of the global economy and monetary system.Inspired by the aging Tesla, Carr set about testing Tesla’s principles in 1937,when he began creating a model spacecraft.[338][index_split_076.html#filepos836518] Carr eventually became convinced that hecould develop a civilian spacecraft that could travel into the upper atmosphere,to the moon and even reach the speed of light. All this could be achieved byfollowing Tesla’s advice of tapping into the electrical energy in the atmosphereto power the spacecraft, and then store that energy in a special “regenerativecoil” for interplanetary flights. "},{"pageContent":"Otis Carr Claims to Build the World’s First Civilian Spacecraft Carr founded a company, OTC Enterprises, Inc., in 1955 in Maryland, and setabout raising the necessary funds and finding skilled personnel for buildingmodels. These would be tested to validate a full scale prototype. Ranging insize, these models included a six foot version to test the feasibility of aplanned 45-foot prototype spacecraft. In November 1959, Carr successfullypatented his design for a full scale civilian spacecraft called the OTC-X1.[339][index_split_076.html#filepos836876] It had a circular design that made it looklike a flying saucer. In order to gain a patent for his design from a skepticalPatents Office, he claimed his OTC-X1 was an amusement device. The introductionto his patent claims: “This invention relates generally to implements inamusement devices, and more particularly to an improved amusement device of thetype where the passengers will receive the impression of riding in aninterplanetary spacecraft.” Figure 26. Design submitted for patent on OTC-X1[images/00020.jpg] In a 1959 radio interview, Carr described the various tests conducted fordeveloping his prototype civilian spacecraft: > We plan to build a prototype model as a demonstration device.

This has already been done.[340]> [index_split_076.html#filepos837022] The OTC-X1 would be powered by a number of capacitor-like objects that Carrcalled \"Utrons\". In an earlier 1957 interview, Carr described the Utrons as “astorage cell for electrical energy. In operation it generates electricity at thesame time it puts out electromotive force. This is the central power system forour spacecraft.”[341] [index_split_076.html#filepos837472] The Utrons wouldsupply a series of counter rotating magnets creating the energy they requiredfor overcoming the Earth’s gravitational field. Carr described this process asfollows: > [W]e have capacitor plates and electro-magnets as a part of this system. Now> this is counter-rotating, the electro-magnets rotate in one direction and the> accumulator, the batteries rotate in another. The capacitor plates rotate in> conjunction with the battery so that we have a clockwise and counter clockwise> rotation. Now the third system is the cabin that maintains the crew. This does> not rotate, it is fixed due to the fact the two bodies are rotating clockwise> and counter clockwise. Therefore the system causes the craft to escape from> the gravity pull. The craft itself due to this system still has internal> gravity because it still has the same weight that it had in the beginning. Carr’s design would create an entirely new gravitational field inside the craft.This effectively created a zero mass environment inside his craft that wouldsuspend the normal laws of inertia. This zero mass environment would enable thespacecraft to achieve light speed velocity.[342][index_split_076.html#filepos837764] It would also enable occupants to withstandtremendous accelerations and changes in directions without being pulverized byimmense g-forces inside the craft. Carr detailed the intricate electromagneticpropulsion system of his spacecraft in his 1959 patent. Carr stated that allelectrical power would be extracted from the atmosphere and be stored insufficient quantities in “regenerative coils” to power the craft duringinterplanetary travel: “We are able here, the first time to our knowledge, touse atmospheric electricity as a recharging system. This is done as a part ofoperational principal of the craft.”[343] [index_split_076.html#filepos838529]Carr demonstrated a small model in an interview, as reported in Fate Magazine: > Otis T. Carr, president of OTC Enterprises, Inc., detailed his claims in an> interview and demonstration of a crude model of a circular motion machine> which he said is the principle of a \"free energy circular foil\" space craft he> can build, if someone puts up the money. He said the machine can be adapted to> devices of any size to produce continuous power absolutely free of> dissipation. Its immediate application, Carr said, would be in a space> craft—which would be able to fly among the planets in controlled flight. It> could land or take off as desired on the earth, the moon or any planet in the> earth's solar system, he said.[344] [index_split_076.html#filepos838875] Carr scheduled a test for his six foot model in April 1959 for an audience ofapproximately 400 people in Oklahoma City. Technical difficulties and a suddenillness contracted by Carr led to the test being cancelled. A 1959 articlepublished in Fate Magazine described the failed test: > The serious field of UFO's and flying saucer research received a setback at> Oklahoma City in late April when a highly publicized launching attempt by> O.T.C. Enterprises of Baltimore, Md., resulted in failure. Hundreds of persons> had been invited to Oklahoma City by Otis T. Carr to watch him \"launch a> six-foot prototype model of the O.T.C. X-1, a space craft which works on> 'utron' energy.\" Those who were there came away disappointed. The flying> saucer did not fly.[345] [index_split_076.html#filepos839305] All that was shown to the public were three-dimensional illustrations of hisdesign. Carr was nowhere to be found. Long John Nebel, a famous New York radiohost, located Carr at the nearby Mercy hospital where he had been admitted foreight days due to a lung hemorrhage. Mysteriously, Carr had become ill on theeve of what should have been a major publicity coup. Carr’s spacecraft projectwas becoming increasingly shrouded in mystery and controversy.Those present were dissatisfied and some complained that they were not evenshown the model to be tested: > I don't know what's going on but I feel they never had any intention of trying> to launch the model. I could not see any plans in sight for the model and, in> fact, I understand, that a Mr. Maywood Jones presented only what he called> \"three-dimensional illustrations\" of Carr's ideas.[346]> [index_split_076.html#filepos839740] Many accepted public criticisms that Carr was promoting his OTC-X1 in order tocreate interest for his planned amusement park ride at Frontier City in OklahomaCity: > One Oklahoma City television reporter expressed the general feeling of the> townspeople: \"This thing will never leave the ground. And I feel that a great> deal of the ballyhoo they're giving out is tied in with the ride at Frontier> City. I have tried constantly to get in to see the saucer model, but they've> kept it hidden.\"[347] [index_split_076.html#filepos840075] With growing hostile public opinion in Oklahoma, Carr decided to move his centerof operations to Apple Valley, California in late 1959. To prevent any furtherpublic debacles, he decided not to announce any test flights in advance. Withnew financial backing and a large production plant, Osbrink, at his disposal,Carr proceeded with his plans to develop and test his spacecraft. Major WayneAho, a former Army Combat Intelligence Officer during World War II, and Carr’schief pilot, proclaimed that he would \"fly to the moon in a flying saucer onDecember 7, 1959.\"[348] [index_split_076.html#filepos840410] Little wassubsequently heard of Carr’s efforts and plans to test his full scale 45-footprototype. No public reports exist of any subsequent tests.In raising revenue for his spacecraft program, Carr was experiencing increasingproblems with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that had placed aninjunction against Carr, “ordering him to cease selling unregisteredstock.”[349] [index_split_076.html#filepos840947] On June 2, 1960, Carr told aCalifornia audience of 300 that it was a \"treacherous misstatement of fact tosay or infer that we [OTC Enterprises] are coming to California to raise moneyin stock sales.\"[350] [index_split_076.html#filepos841255]In January 1961, the Attorney General of New York, Louis J. Lefkowitz, claimedCarr had swindled $50,000. He was charged with \"the crime of selling securitieswithout registering the same.\"[351] [index_split_076.html#filepos841590] Carrwas sentenced to a 14 year prison term. At the same time, True Magazine labeledCarr a hoaxer, thereby effectively ending any remaining public sympathy for him.After serving part of his term, Carr was released from prison, and disappearedfrom the public arena. Suffering ill health and cut off from supporters, helived in obscurity until his death in 1982. Apparently, the bold development ofa civilian spacecraft industry had ignominiously failed. Its pioneer, a protégéof the great Nikola Tesla, was publicly disgraced as a felon having apparentlyhoaxed members of the general public with his wild tales of building a civilianspacecraft while actually promoting an amusement park ride.The true history of what happened with Carr and his effort to develop a civilianspacecraft industry would remain secret for almost another 50 years. It is onlywith the public emergence of one of Carr’s trusted technicians that the truthwould finally be told of what had really happened with the world’s thirdcivilian spacecraft effort. "},{"pageContent":"Ralph Ring Emerges to Reveal Carr’s Successful Development of the OTC-X1 In March 2006, a largely unknown individual came forward to reveal that he wasone of three pilots manning a successful test flight of Carr’s full scaleprototype, the OTC-X1.[352] [index_split_076.html#filepos841828] A technician atthe time, Ralph Ring claims he was recruited into Carr’s team, which wasattempting to build a 45-foot prototype spacecraft after the relocation toCalifornia in 1959. Ring was also a talented inventor who had grown frustratedwith corporate sector disinterest in innovative principles concerningelectromagnetic energy. Earlier, he had helped the famous French oceanographer,Jacques Cousteau, develop the aqualung, and later worked at a government-fundedresearch organization called Advanced Kinetics.In a series of public interviews and presentations, Ring described theconditions of leaving Advanced Kinetics. He claims to have resolved two complexengineering problems involving electromagnetism. Confident of a job promotion,Ring was instead told by the director that they were a government fundedcorporation and “we’re paid to look for the answers, but not to find them!”[353][index_split_076.html#filepos841977] In frustration, Ring left and met with Carrin late 1959, and was quickly impressed with his ideas, including the plan tobuild a civilian spacecraft. In his first public interview, Ring described Carras follows: > He was an unquestioned genius. Tesla had recognized his quality immediately> and had taught him everything he knew. He was inspired, and—like Tesla—seemed> to know exactly what to do to get something to work. He was a private man and> was also very metaphysical in his thinking. I think the fact that he was not> formally trained in physics helped him. He was not constrained by any> preconceived ideas. As crazy as it sounds now, he was determined to fly to the> moon and really believed it could be done. I believed it. We all did.[354]> [index_split_076.html#filepos842157] Ring directly participated in the testing of smaller models of the OTC-X1 craftdeveloped by Carr. He described how these had been successfully tested andexhibited unique characteristics when achieving certain rotational speeds: > ...the metal turned to Jell-o. You could push your finger right into it. It> ceased to be solid. It turned into another form of matter, which was as if it> was not entirely here in this reality. That's the only way I can attempt to> describe it. It was uncanny, one of the weirdest sensations I've ever> felt.[355] [index_split_076.html#filepos842465] Most importantly, Ring claims that the 45-foot OTC-X1 prototype developed byCarr was completed and successfully tested back in 1959. Ring says he was one ofthree pilots on the craft, which flew 10 miles instantaneously. Ring describedhow Carr had been able to maintain communications with the three man teampiloting the OTC-X1, who were instructed to complete a series of tasks beforereturning to the launch site. When asked if the OTC-X1 had flown to itsdestination, Ring said: > Fly is not the right word. It traversed distance. It seemed to take no time. I> was with two other engineers when we piloted the 45' craft about ten miles. I> thought it hadn't moved—I thought it had failed. I was completely astonished> when we realized that we had returned with samples of rocks and plants from> our destination. It was a dramatic success. It was more like a kind of> teleportation. [356] [index_split_076.html#filepos842773] Ring described how the test flight had been able to change the flow of time: > What's more, time was distorted somehow. We felt we were in the craft about> fifteen or twenty seconds. We were told afterwards that we'd been carefully> timed as having been in the craft no longer than three or four minutes. I> still have no complete idea how it worked. [357]> [index_split_076.html#filepos843081] Remarkably, Ring’s statement suggests Carr had developed a propulsion systemthat had similarities to the temporal drive first developed by the VrilSociety—which effectively would teleport a Vril spacecraft itself throughspace-time. It is alleged that Tesla’s ideas were a key part of the U.S. Navy’s1943 ‘Philadelphia Experiment’, which was successful in teleporting the USSEldridge through space and time.[358] [index_split_076.html#filepos843496] Ifso, then it appears that Tesla had shared some of these ideas with Carr, whosubsequently incorporated them into the OTC-X1.Another remarkable part of Ring’s testimony concerns the unique navigationsystem used by the pilots to control the movements of the OTC-X1. According toRing, this navigation system used the conscious intent of the pilots rather thanconventional technology. > The Utron was the key to it all. Carr said it accumulated energy because of> its shape, and focused it, and also responded to our conscious intentions.> When we operated the machine, we didn't work any controls. We went into a kind> of meditative state and all three of us focused our intentions on the effect> we wanted to achieve. It sounds ridiculous, I know. But that's what we did,> and that's what worked. Carr had tapped into some principle which is not> understood, in which consciousness melds with engineering to create an effect.> You can't write that into equations. I have no idea how he knew it would work.> But it did. [359] [index_split_076.html#filepos843739] Success of the first test of the full scale OTC-X1 meant that planning forflights into outer space and to the Moon now proceeded in earnest. Beforeannouncing the results to the general public, Ring said Carr and his crew workedround the clock to complete the testing program.The most dramatic part of Ring’s testimony concerns what happened two weeksafter the successful test of the OTC-X1. He said that Carr's operation was shutdown by the FBI and other government agencies in a secret raid involving sevenor eight truckloads of armed government personnel. The FBI told Carr that hisproject was being closed “because of your threat to overthrow the monetarysystem of the United States of America.”[360][index_split_076.html#filepos844048]Indeed, Carr’s successful testing of a civilian spacecraft, had it been allowedto go ahead, would have revolutionized the energy sector and the aerospaceindustry. The conventional energy industry using fossil fuels to generateelectric power and the aviation industry would have become redundant overnight.Large U.S. corporate interests in the energy sector would have lost substantialinvestments. Lack of corporate profits would throw countless thousands out ofwork. The financial effect of a civilian spacecraft industry using electricalenergy from the atmosphere for power would most certainly have placed enormouspressure on the U.S. monetary system, possibly causing its collapse.In a series of interviews and public presentations, Ring claims FBI agentsconfiscated all the equipment, including the OTC-X1 prototype. They debriefedall of Carr’s employees, warned them to remain silent on what had happened, andmade Carr sign non-disclosure agreements. Ring’s testimony, if true, revealswhat really happened with Otis Carr’s radical civilian spacecraft project.Rather than Carr being a fraud who deceived a number of investors, his radicalcivilian spacecraft proved successful. His success so much threatened entrenchedinterests in the energy sector that his operation was shut down, with the fullapproval and knowledge of a select number of government agencies concerned withthe financial impact on the U.S. monetary system. Carr himself was forced toendure trumped up charges designed to discredit him, and end his bold effort todevelop a civilian spacecraft industry. "},{"pageContent":"Credibility of Ralph Ring’s Testimony Ring has provided a number of photographs of the OTC-X1 developed by Carr. Thesephotographs had previously not been published. The photos show that Carr hadindeed succeeded in building a number of models, including the 45 foot prototypespacecraft.[361] [index_split_076.html#filepos844228] The photos also dispel theview that Carr was a huckster and had not succeeded in developing a full scaleprototype spacecraft. Ring’s photos are material evidence that he did indeedcollaborate with Carr on the OTC-X1, as he claims. Figure 27. Photo from Ralph Ring of the OTC-X1[images/00049.jpg] Perhaps most significant is what occurred to Ring soon after coming forward inMarch 2006 to reveal his experiences with Otis Carr. Bill Ryan of ProjectCamelot describes what happened: > Shortly afterwards, Ralph went into hospital for a routine knee replacement> operation. He accidentally received the wrong treatment, and nearly died three> times. At the time of writing (July 2006) he has just recently emerged, very> frail, from intensive care—but is determined to tell his story. Prior to that> he had enjoyed perfect health for 71 years.[362]> [index_split_076.html#filepos844538] In his presentations at a number of conferences, Ring described how he had beentaken by ambulance to a hospital 25 miles away, bypassing a hospital adjacent towhere he was staying.[363] [index_split_076.html#filepos844846] Ring hoveredperilously close to death as a result of the ‘mistreatment’ and the longambulance ride. Was the “accidental” application of another patient’smedication, and the “bypassing” of nearer hospitals part of a covert attempt onRing’s life? The circumstances are certainly suspicious and indicate an effortto silence Ring. This series of “accidental” events that almost took Ring’s lifesoon after his public emergence provides circumstantial evidence in support ofhis claims.Finally, Ring is a very sincere individual who has impressed audiences with hisgenuineness and frankness. Bill Ryan and Kerry Cassidy, co-founders of thepopular Project Camelot website, were the first to interview Ring in March2006.[364] [index_split_076.html#filepos845156] After a series of interviews,they concluded: “There is no doubt in our minds that Ralph Ring is 100% genuine.Everyone who has met him and heard his story in person is in fullagreement.”[365] [index_split_076.html#filepos845470] This is something I canpersonally verify, since I was able to hear Ring present his ideas at theInternational UFO Congress in 2007. I was also able to interview him later inHawaii when he accepted an invitation to attend a conference Ico-organized.[366] [index_split_076.html#filepos845778] I agree with Ryan andCassidy that Ring’s personal qualities make him very credible. He appears to bemotivated by a simple desire to tell the truth about events that happened over50 years ago that could have revolutionized life on this planet. "},{"pageContent":"Public Policy Implications The different elements concerning Otis Carr’s OTC-X1 project and Ralph Ring’stestimony can now be drawn together. Carr’s successful development of a fullyoperational civilian spacecraft using radical electromagnetic propulsion andnavigation systems led to a brutal response by federal government agencies.Agencies led by the FBI raided Carr’s construction facilities, confiscatedequipment, intimidated employees into silence, and publicly discredited Carrthrough trumped up charges orchestrated by the U.S. Stock and SecuritiesCommission. Ring’s public testimony and the photographic evidence he provided ofthe existence of Carr’s OTC-X1, convincingly show that elements inside the U.S.Government suppressed a wholly civilian owned spacecraft industry. Severalmotives for this suppression appear readily apparent.The first and most apparent motive for the government suppression is to protectU.S. industrial interests in the energy sector, which would have been threatenedby knowledge of how to draw free electrical energy from the atmosphere. U.S.corporations dominate the energy sector around the planet, and the appearance of“free energy” technologies would wreak havoc on their stock value. This wouldimpact negatively on the entire U.S. economy.A second and related motive for this suppression is the impact of “free energy”technologies on the U.S monetary system—the explanation given by FBI agents forraiding Carr’s plant. The development of free energy technologies would makeredundant the conventional energy sector owned by U.S. corporations, possiblyleading to a collapse of the U.S. dollar.A third possible motive is preventing the development of a civilian spacecraftindustry that could travel into outer space and other planets with minimal or nogovernment regulation. Such a civilian spacecraft industry could enable travelto nearby planets to confirm whether intelligent life forms have ever resided orcontinue to reside in our solar system.[367][index_split_076.html#filepos846176] There is much evidence that intelligentextraterrestrial life has already been discovered and has been interacting withhumanity, but this has become highly classified information.[368][index_split_076.html#filepos846573] Chapter 11 will discuss a number ofextraterrestrial visitors allegedly interacting with humanity, and the differentsecret space programs discussed in earlier chapters. Clearly, a civilianspacecraft industry would threaten an ongoing cover-up of extraterrestrial life.A clue into the final, and perhaps most compelling, motive is the composition ofthe government agencies that shut down Carr’s project. These were civilianagencies, and not personnel from any of the military services. It was earlierdiscussed that the Solar Warden space program, being developed by the U.S. Navy,was delayed for nearly four decades in successfully reverse engineering theadvanced propulsion systems found in Vril/Nazi spacecraft and capturedextraterrestrial vehicles—for interstellar travel. Efforts to develop advancedtemporal drives needed for traveling into other solar systems were likelysabotaged, as were the navigation systems for these. It was not until the 1980’sthat the technological breakthroughs had occurred, as suggested in the chaptersix analysis of Ben Rich’s comments, regarding breakthroughs in interstellartravel technologies.In contrast, Carr had succeeded in applying Tesla’s principles into ateleportation spacecraft/device that manipulated space-time. In addition, he haddeveloped a viable navigation system based on a mind-technology interfacebetween the pilots and the spacecraft.According to Lt. Col. Philip Corso, who from 1961-1963 worked as the head of theU.S. Army’s Foreign Technology desk at its Research and Development Division,the Pentagon had been actively seeking information about how to replicate themind-technology interface found in captured alien spacecraft. Corso explainedhow the navigation element had yet to be understood: > There were crashes elsewhere, and they [the Germans] gathered material too.> The Germans were working on it…. They did a lot of experiments on flying> saucers. But where all, we and they, missed out was on the guidance system. In> R&D we began to realize that this being [an ET] was part of the guidance> system. [369] [index_split_076.html#filepos847019] Corso did not appear to be aware of the parallel Vril Society space program thathad begun relocating to Antarctica prior to World War II, and was referringinstead to the unsuccessful Nazi SS effort to weaponize flying saucers. However,Corso was stating quite clearly that in the early 1960’s, the Pentagon did notknow how to replicate the mind-technology interface used in crashedextraterrestrial craft. Carr had, unbeknownst to the U.S. military, developedthe necessary mind-technology interface for the OTC-X1 pilots. If Carr’sknowledge of creating a mind-technology interface fell into the hands of theU.S. Navy, it would lead to a more rapid development of the Solar Wardenprogram. This would threaten the Dark Fleet, which had emerged out of theearlier Vril/Nazi space program.Key elements in the U.S. Military Industrial Complex, which had been infiltratedby Nazi sympathizers due to secret agreements with the Vril/Nazi breakawaygroup, as Goode revealed in chapter three, did not want the Navy learning aboutCarr’s successful efforts. The MJ-12 Group, along with the CIA, both of whichhad been compromised, had the means and resources to arrange for Carr’s projectto be shut down, for him to be discredited, and his technicians to be threatenedinto silence.Carr’s mysterious illness prior to his public testing of his six-foot model in1959, and the near death of Ralph Ring in 2006 after his coming forward toreveal his testimony, both suggest covert action by the CIA to prevent publicdemonstration and knowledge of advanced technologies. Covert government agenciesand/or corporate entities have been historically observed to be targetinginventors and researchers working on advanced technologies based on the ideas ofNikola Tesla.[370] [index_split_076.html#filepos847315] Discrediting, silencingor terminating inventors and/or whistleblowers appears to continue. "},{"pageContent":"Conclusions In 1959/1960, Otis Carr and his team had succeeded in developing a civilianspacecraft program, the world’s third; if we include both the earlier VrilSociety efforts in the 1920’s and Marconi’s alleged program in the 1930’s. Carrdid so by applying principles taught to him by Nikola Tesla, which resulted inthe OTC-X1 operating similarly to a teleportation device that could move throughspace-time. This type of travel had been allegedly achieved with the VrilSociety/Nazi SS Andromeda Device, used for traveling to the Aldebaran starsystem and back in the mid-1940’s. This advanced space-time propulsiontechnology was being actively sought by the U.S. Navy in the late 1950’s, as itwas developing its own secret space program capable of both interplanetary andinterstellar travel.Carr’s achievement was brutally suppressed by a series of covert actions verylikely led by the CIA and the MJ-12 Group. This included Federal law enforcementagencies raiding Carr’s construction facility, confiscating all his equipment,and arranging for his incarceration on trumped up charges in 1961. The collusionof various civilian elements of the U.S. government in suppressing the emergenceof a civilian led spacecraft industry is an important historical fact. U.S.corporations in the energy sector, aware of Carr’s ambitious program, were alsolikely key players in this suppression.The implications of Ring’s testimony and Carr’s achievements are momentous.Rather than a felon who hoaxed the general public with radical ideas of civilianspacecraft, Carr was a heroic inventor who succeeded—against tremendous odds—inbuilding a spacecraft that had the potential for widespread civilian use. Itcould have also accelerated by decades the covert U.S. Navy effort to developinterstellar capable spacecraft.Carr and his team of colleagues need to be acknowledged for their pioneeringefforts. Shadowy governmental agencies and corporations responsible forsuppressing the public emergence of Carr’s spacecraft, even to the extent ofdenying it to elements of the U.S. military, need to be revealed and madeaccountable. Vested financial interests and quasi-governmental groups hoardingsuch technology should no longer be allowed to hold back inventors, like Carr,with the expertise to make inexpensive spacecraft for private use. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter10 Ancient Secret Space Programs The television series Ancient Aliens has enjoyed extraordinary success and iscurrently in its seventh season on the History Channel.

Did intelligent beings from outer> space visit Earth thousands of years ago?[371]> [index_split_076.html#filepos847745] The Ancient Aliens series provide ample historical evidence revealing a varietyof different flying craft witnessed in earlier eras. The obvious assumption isthat these were not of earthly origin, and that humanity was being visited byextraterrestrial life. These visiting aliens helped primitive humans achieve acertain level of technological sophistication, and perhaps even integratedthemselves into human society as “gods” that ruled over the people.Egyptian historian Manetho (Ptolemaic Era) claimed that prior to the 30dynasties of human pharaohs that ruled Egypt, there was direct rule by the godsand the demigods.[372] [index_split_076.html#filepos848262] These pre-dynasticgods lived for thousands of years, and interbred with humans to createoff-spring regarded as demigods who were also long lived. A similar situationhappened in Sumer according to the Sumerian King list: > The early Sumerian king list names eight kings with a total of 241,200 years> from the time when \"the kingship was lowered from heaven\" to the time when> \"the Flood\" swept over the land and once more \"the kingship was lowered from> heaven\" after the Flood.[373] [index_split_076.html#filepos848468] An extensive number of books by Erich von Daniken and Zechariah Sitchin havepresented abundant historical data to support the idea that humanity had beenvisited by extraterrestrial “gods” who interbred with humanity to creategenerations of rulers.[374] [index_split_076.html#filepos848690]There is, however, another explanation for who built the flying vehicleswitnessed and recorded by ancient societies. These were not vehicles of the godswho came from other worlds, as our ancestors thought. Instead, the flying craftbelonged to the ruling elite of their own or a nearby society; whose scientistshad mastered the secrets of antigravity, aircraft construction, and even spacetravel. Rather than simply a case of humanity being visited byextraterrestrials, perhaps ancient societies had achieved stunning technologicalbreakthroughs that enabled them to visit other worlds. These technologicalbreakthroughs may have been due to the indigenous scientific genius of the time,extraterrestrial intervention, or a mixture of both.There is a precedent for such a stunning possibility in our own contemporaryera. As previously discussed, the Vril Society and Nazi SS had built flyingsaucers capable of interplanetary and even interstellar travel. These were aresult of alleged extraterrestrial communications received by Maria Orsic, andthe scientific genius of Prof. W.O. Schumann and others. After their firstsuccessful flying saucer tests in the 1930’s, the Vril Society/Nazi SS hadestablished a moon base in 1942 and even visited the Aldebaran star systemstarting in 1945. This was all done long before the official inauguration of thespace age with the 1959 launch of the Sputnik satellite, and the 1969 moonlanding.Could something comparable have happened in ancient civilizations where theruling elite and their scientists had achieved the required threshold oftechnological advancement? There are many examples of ancient civilizations thathad achieved stunning technological achievements far exceeding what is generallybelieved. These civilizations may have followed a similar path to the VrilSociety/Nazi SS and developed flying vehicles for the national elite withoutsharing them with the general public.According to award winning researcher on the Great Sphinx and ancient Egypt,John Anthony West: > Egyptian science, medicine, mathematics and astronomy were all of an> exponentially higher order of refinement and sophistication than modern> scholars will acknowledge. The whole of Egyptian civilization was based upon a> complete and precise understanding of universal laws…. Moreover, every aspect> of Egyptian knowledge seems to have been complete at the very beginning. The> science, artistic and architectural techniques and the hieroglyphic system> show virtually no signs of a period of ‘development’; indeed, many of the> achievements of the earliest dynasties were never surpassed, or even equaled> later on…. Egyptian civilization was not a development, but a legacy.[375]> [index_split_076.html#filepos849077] The famed Temple of Abydos was built by Seti I (died 1279 BC) and his son RamsesII (died 1213 BC) who reigned during the 19th Egyptian dynasty (1292–1190 BC).On a heavy stone slab supporting the ceiling of the temple, there arehieroglyphs showing four futuristic flying and/or submersible craft in AncientEgypt.[376] [index_split_076.html#filepos849350] The hieroglyphs were discoveredin 1848, well before the first airplane flight of the Wright brothers in 1903.The Temple of Abydos hieroglyphs have been cited multiple times as concreteevidence that Ancient Egyptians had flying machines.[377][index_split_076.html#filepos849682] Figure 28. Hieroglyphs found in Temple of Abydos[images/00039.jpg] In many ancient cultures, people used a culturally appropriate descriptive termfor the flying craft they saw in the sky. Just as “flying saucer” was the firstdescriptive term for an unidentified flying object in modern culture, so too“flying chariot” was a descriptive term relevant to ancient cultures of thetime.Chinese texts talk about a technologically advanced civilization that possessed“flying chariots”: > All ancient Chinese texts, especially those of Lao Tzu and Confucius, as well> as the I Ching, speak of the ancients and the glory of their civilization.> They were presumably speaking about the people living at least at the time of> the “Five Monarchs” [2852 to 2216 BC] and probably before.

[379] [index_split_076.html#filepos850246] Even the legendary King Solomon (reigned 970-931) apparently had access to aflying vehicle of some kind: > According to the Kebra Negast, King Solomon would visit Makeda and his son> Menelik by flying in a “heavenly car.” “The king … and all who obeyed his word> flew on the wagon without pain and suffering and without sweat or exhaustion,> and traveled in one day a distance which took three months to traverse (on> foot).[380] [index_split_076.html#filepos850477] In 1949, a large sarcophagus was found in a vaulted room beneath the floor ofthe Temple of Inscriptions located in Palanque, Mexico. The sarcophagus had aglyph on the stone slab covering it that depicts what looks like an astronautbelieved to be the legendary Mayan ruler Pakal: > The human figure portrayed in relief on that stone slab has become known as> \"the astronaut\" to some; as \"Pakal\", a maya ruler, to others. From the glyphs> one may view the subject as Pakal; from the visual theme one may see something> that looks like a spacecraft within which he is seated.

This relief sculpture has been dated at around 690 our era,> when there were apparently no space vehicles in existence; that we know of> anyway.[381] [index_split_076.html#filepos850708] More recently, there have been a number of Mayan glyphs depicting flying saucersthat were discovered in Mexico’s Calakmul Mayan pyramid.[382][index_split_076.html#filepos851080] These glyphs have been declared to begenuine by respected astrophysicist, Nassim Haramein, despite controversy overtheir authenticity due to a failed documentary film project that was to announcethem, but instead resulted in lawsuits.[383][index_split_076.html#filepos851384] Figure 29. Alleged Mayan artifact shows flying saucer[images/00003.jpg] The most extensive literature on ancient flying craft comes from India. Thereare a number of Vedic texts that describe Vimanas (flying chariots or flyingpalaces). Among the oldest is a passage in the Ramanaya: > \"The Pushpaka Vimana that resembles the Sun and belongs to my brother was> brought by the powerful Ravana; that aerial and excellent Vimana going> everywhere at will ... that chariot resembling a bright cloud in the sky ...> and the King [Rama] got in, and the excellent chariot at the command of the> Raghira, rose up into the higher atmosphere.[384]> [index_split_076.html#filepos851721] The Samarangana Sutradhara is attributed to 11th century King, Bhoja of Dhara,who describes some of the requirements for building flying craft: > Strong and durable must the body of the vimana be made, like a great flying> bird of light material. Inside one must put the mercury engine with its iron> heating apparatus underneath. By means of the power latent in the mercury,> which sets the driving whirlwind in motion, a man sitting inside may travel a> great distance in the sky. The movements of a vimana are such that it can> vertically ascend, vertically descend, or move standing forwards or backwards.> With the help of machines, human beings can fly through the air and heavenly> beings can come down to earth”[385] [index_split_076.html#filepos852108] The reference to the “mercury engine … which sets the driving whirlwind inmotion” is astounding. This is a rough description of the high frequencyrotation of mercury based plasma around a circuit to create a Magnetic FieldDisruptor, earlier described by Edgar Fouche. The Samarangana Sutradhara waswritten over a thousand years ago, but describes the principles used in thepropulsion system for the highly classified TR-3B illustrated in chapter one!The discussion of mercury engines in ancient Indian texts has led to WilliamClendenon, author of Mercury: UFO Messenger of the Gods, claiming that manymodern day flying saucer reports can be traced to the ancient vimanas: > Clendenon’s view of a great deal of discoid craft seen since 1947 is that many> are vimanas, either of ancient manufacture, or modern manufacture. He believes> that the famous scout ship observed by George Adamski (and later by other> witnesses) is neither a hoax nor an interplanetary space craft. His mercury> vortex engines are not capable of interplanetary flight he says, but … are for> terrestrial flight only…. He thought that some of the craft were ancient—flown> by mysterious humans who lived for hundreds of years—and that some of these> craft were modern constructions, made by the Americans, British, and> Germans.[386] [index_split_076.html#filepos852624] Clendenon’s view raises an intriguing possibility. Ancient elites were able tosurvive the catastrophes that killed off their general populations and sweptaway their civilizations—by using the advanced flying saucer technologies theybuilt. If so, did the ancient elites escape to the Moon, Mars, other planets, orunknown regions of the Earth’s interior? "},{"pageContent":"Ancient Space Programs According to Corey Goode, the elites of ancient civilizations did escape thecatastrophes by using advanced spacecraft they built. Goode [C.G.] elaborated onthe social system that made this possible in response to a question: > Q16. In these ancient human societies, did they follow a path similar to our> own in terms of a general public sector that is denied the most advanced> technologies, while a smaller elite monopolize the technologies in developing> a secret space program?> > [C.G.] Some were very similar. Most developed through a much different “Caste> System” where the “Royalty” and “Priesthood” had access to the secrets. The> “Priesthood” was usually split up into sub-casts and among those casts would> be those in the different “Sciences” or “Magic’s” etc… One constant was that> the “Common Person” or “Worker Class” was left completely out of the loop.> They would only have “Myths” or “Stories” that would leak out or “Trickle> Down”. In many cases the “Priest Caste” seemed to guard the secrets from the> other castes.[387] [index_split_076.html#filepos852855] Goode’s description of a caste society dominated by priests and royalty helpsexplain how the masses could have been kept ignorant of the advanced aerospacetechnologies possessed by the elite.Goode also responded to a question about the difference between our modernglobal civilization and ancient societies over the extent to which advancedtechnologies are shared with the general population. > Q17. It has been suggested that in our current human civilization, more> advanced technology has been publicly shared than in previous civilizations> where elites exercised a tighter monopoly over the advanced technologies. Do> you agree/disagree with this?> > [C.G.] I agree to a point. In times when the “Common People” were less> sophisticated, it was much easier to use mysticism and magical tales to> explain away what they were seeing. As civilization and the “Common People”> became more sophisticated and technological, this was less and less of an> option. The general raising of the “Consciousness” of the general populace is> also a factor. The Elites have been working on so many ways to keep the> general population ignorant and unaware of the true power of our “Joint/Mass> Consciousness and its Co-creative Abilities”….[388]> [index_split_076.html#filepos853316] Goode claims that between five to seven ancient secret space programs continueto the present day. Among these is a Mayan breakaway civilization that hadsuccessfully created space programs capable of interplanetary flight: > Q19. What do you know of a secret space program that involves ancient Mayans?> How sophisticated is their technology relative to other space programs?> > [C.G.] Yes! They are very peaceful and stay to themselves. They have recently> worked with some other groups and helped some people (Including Myself) with> some of their “interesting technologies”. Interesting, you would like an> example right? Giant Perfectly Geometrically Cylindrical Craft Made of> “Polished Stone”. Technologically advanced and telepathic, they use very> different types of technological and physics principals. Very much “Mental> Interface Technology”. I very much like them from my brief encounters and> assistance.[389] [index_split_076.html#filepos853777] The reference to “Mental Interface Technology” is very significant given itsparallel with the navigation technology developed by Otis Carr for his OTC-X1,discussed in the previous chapter. It was stated that the U.S. Navy and Army hadbeen unsuccessful in developing similar navigation technology for interstellartravel, due to sabotage by Nazi/Dark Fleet infiltrators, until the 1980’s.Nikola Tesla’s ideas, upon which Carr’s flying saucer work was based in the late1950’s, appear to contain the necessary principles for developing an advancedmind-technology interface, which was used by the Mayan breakaway civilization.Regarding the hieroglyphic drawings of flying craft found in Temple of Abydos,Goode was asked how widespread knowledge was of aircraft/spacecraft in ancientEgyptian society: > Q18. The temple of Abydos in Egypt has a glyph with advanced technologies … is> this technology that was widely known to ancient Egyptian society, or part of> their secret space program?> > [C.G.] Yes, absolutely! Or, of one of the prior “Breakaway Civilizations”> whose “Technology” they were witnessing. Considering the location (the Temple)> though and that the “Priest Castes” were sometimes “More in the Know” than> their kings or rulers… There is a good chance that my answer to your question> is directly related to what they were using. We know for sure they were also> in “Contact” with both “Off World” groups and “Trickster God/Ancient Breakaway> Civilizations”. [390] [index_split_076.html#filepos854238] Goode was also asked about secret space programs related to ancient Atlanteanand Greek societies: > Q20. Plato wrote about a war between ancient Atlanteans and Greeks where the> latter held their own against a more powerful Atlantean force. Is there an> Atlantean and/or Greek SSP?> > [C.G.] These were very often the “Common Caste” or people explaining the best> they could, in the terms of their era, what they observed. There were all> kinds of battles that occurred and these were times when both “Off World> Groups” and “Ancient Breakaway Groups” would appear in the skies and walk> among “Common People” on the ground (leaving their underground embassies/bases> or their “Heavenly” bases of operation and observation depending on their> agendas). > This could have been a Previous Ancient Breakaway Civilization fighting> another one, or an Off World Civilization for control of a portion of or all> of the planet (many of these stories were passed from culture to culture and> added to and changed over time). I did not see anything about an actual> “Ancient Greek Breakaway Space Program”. There were some close ties between> the Ancient Greeks and one Ancient Breakaway Group that [they] had some> genetic and social connections with. The same can be said about the Ancient> Romans and one of the more powerful current era Roman Empire Groups. These> relationships are complicated and still very controversial in some cases.> [391] [index_split_076.html#filepos854699] Finally, Goode was asked about the Ancient Indian society in the Vedic era: > Q21. The Vedas refer to flying cities involved in a great war (Mahabharata);> were these cities part of an ancient Indian secret space program, or remnants> of earlier civilizations?> > [C.G.] These were what we would call Carriers in the SSP, or “Mother Ships” in> Ufology. They were observations of battles between Ancient Breakaway> Civilizations and “Off World Beings,” much like what was described in other> cultures including the Greeks and Vikings etc… These conflicts occurred mostly> outside the Earth’s Atmosphere and around the Moon (and further out into the> Sol System), but on occasions these battles occurred in the skies, on the> ground and below the ground of the Earth in Ancient and even into “Medieval> Times” (and later). There are quite a lot of secret records of these conflicts> in the possession of the Vatican and other “Elite” Groups that have been> “Scanned” into “The Database” that the “Glass Smart Pads” had access to (as> well as Off World “Databases” depending on the situations).[392]> [index_split_076.html#filepos855160] Goode’s reply is quite significant here since it suggests that giant aircraftcarrier-like motherships have been created before. With thousands of personnel,these could well be described as floating cities.Aside from his direct reference to a Mayan breakaway civilization, Goode wasreluctant to identify the 5-7 ancient civilizations that continue operationstoday. He claimed that some of these were pretending to be extraterrestrial;and, therefore, deceiving individuals and programs they came into contact with: > Q15. You say that the SSP … Alliance comprises the Solar Warden SSP along with> 5-7 secret space programs belonging to ancient Earth civilizations, can you> identify the civilizations from which they originate?> > [C.G.] No. This is in some cases controversial information. There are a few of> these groups that have created an entire belief system around themselves in> the Ufology community. Some of them have approached or “Contacted” individuals> or small groups and told them that they are “Aliens” from “The *** Star> System” or “The *** *** Federations” etc…. This is a deception that they> pulled on the SSP’s for a while, until it was first suspected and then later> confirmed by other “Off World” allies, other “Ancient Breakaway Civilizations”> and also extensive investigations and expeditions by the SSP’s to these “Star> Systems” to verify their claims…. There is going to be some heavy blow back by> people who are convinced that these groups are “Benevolent Aliens Working for> the Salvation of Humanity”. Those misled people are going to attack the> messengers vigorously.[393] [index_split_076.html#filepos855621] In response to a question on his FAQ page, Goode wanted to clarify that he wasnot saying that all the ancient breakaway civilizations were deceptive. Heclaims that some are doing very important humanitarian work on Earth and incolonies on other worlds involving mistreated humans: > [T]here are a \"Handful\" of \"Ancient Human Break Away Civilizations\". A few are> very benevolent and have kept their distance from all of the other groups> until recently. They have come forward to assist in the rescue and> rehabilitation of some of the Humans that have been \"Taken\" from Earth by hit> and run raids by some negative ET races, as well as other human slaves that> were traded to ET's and taken to other star systems. Some of these humans have> been through such horrors that they are in no shape yet to return to our> current society for a number of reasons. Some of these Ancient Break Away> Groups have created colonies in other star systems and have brought large> numbers of these victims there to be rehabilitated. I wanted to say this so> they all do not get a bad name from my recent disclosures.[394]> [index_split_076.html#filepos856082] Goode did want to point out, however, that most of the breakaway ancient groupswere deceptive; based on their history of interaction with the secret spaceprograms: > The majority of them, however, have been very deceptive and over many hundreds> of years have presented themselves as \"God's\", \"Angels\" and \"ET's from> Federations here to help Humanity\". It wasn't discovered that some groups> claiming to be ET were actually Break Away Civilizations from ancient> civilizations that are long gone.

After \"Disclosure\"/\"The Event\" there will be much that will have to be> unlearned and relearned by everyone. [395]> [index_split_076.html#filepos856433] Goode’s claims here are certainly controversial. Among the famed contactees suchas George Adamski, Howard Menger, and the more recent Billy Meier case, some maynot be in touch with extraterrestrials at all. Instead, they are working withancient breakaway civilizations masquerading as extraterrestrials. This isaccording to the information Goode accessed on the “smart glass pads” which werereadily available in the secret space programs he served on.What would be the motivations of ancient human breakaway civilizations for doingthis? One is manipulative, as Goode suggests. By masquerading asextraterrestrials, this would have a similar societal effect to what happened inthe past when ancient societies viewed those using advanced technologies asgods. There are significant benefits for ancient breakaway civilizations beingviewed as extraterrestrial visitors (modern day ‘gods’) by ‘contactees’. Theancient breakaway group might be able to exert more influence over a significantproportion of humanity, convinced the visitors are very different to humanity.Furthermore, the ancient elites response for the breakaway civilizations couldestablish alliances with modern day elites, where both reap the benefits ofkeeping the majority of humanity in the dark about advanced technologies, andhumanity’s true history.It is important to note that not all ancient breakaway groups behave in amanipulative manner, as Goode points out. Some are helping inspire humanity toreconnect with its ancient heritage in accomplishments and ingenuity. Theimplications are stunning. This means that humanity has the native ingenuity todevelop advanced technologies for free energy devices, interstellar travel,holographic healing, etc. Human inventors have the possibility of tapping intothe collective unconscious of humanity stretching back into antiquity; to createadvanced technologies. Inventors and scientists such as Nikola Tesla, ThomasTownsend Brown, Viktor Schauberger, Winfried Schumann, and many others have doneso in the past. Extraterrestrial visitors, whether genuine or not, are notnecessarily humanity’s saviors by introducing advanced technologies. Insteadextraterrestrial visitors can inspire humanity to re-invent the necessarytechnologies to uplift the human condition in all ways imaginable. This iscertainly very important to keep in mind as we next explore extraterrestrialsinteracting with humanity and the Secret Space programs. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter11 Extraterrestrial Interactions with the Secret Space Programs There are at least four secret space programs with smaller rogue Special AccessProgram offshoots, which were developed as a result of the Vril Society’s andNazi Germany’s successful flying saucer developments in the 1930’s earlierdiscussed in chapters two and three. These five programs have developed bases onthe Moon and Mars; and/or developed fleets capable of interstellar travel. Eachof these programs is controlled either by national security or corporate elites,or by secret societies. As we are well aware, none of this has been publiclyrevealed and remains highly classified within different governments’ nationalsecurity systems. Were it not for whistleblowers and leaked documents, we wouldnot be aware of these secret space programs.In addition to the above programs, chapter ten discussed secret space programsthat date far back in human history. These were also controlled by nationalsecurity, political and religious elites of the ancient societies in question.At least one of these programs can be traced to the Mayan Civilization, whichmaintains fleets of spacecraft capable of interstellar flight and even hascolonies in other star systems if Corey Goode is correct. Adding another level of complexity to what is really happening with the varioussecret space programs is the existence of extraterrestrial civilizationsvisiting or interacting with our world. This is exemplified in the VrilSociety’s and Nazi Germany’s cooperation with one or more extraterrestrialgroups in developing their secret space program efforts, beginning in the 1920’sand 1930’s respectively. The alien groups mentioned in chapters two and fourwere allegedly from the Aldebaran and Alpha Draconis star systems, and the innerEarth (the latter will be defined as “intraterrestrials”). With the developmentof fissile nuclear weapons in the 1940’s and more powerful thermonuclear weaponsin the 1950’s, it appears that more extraterrestrial groups became interested inhuman affairs.In my book, Galactic Diplomacy: Getting to Yes with ET, nineteen differentextraterrestrial or “intraterrestrial” groups are described.[396][index_split_076.html#filepos856840] These descriptions were based on thereports of multiple experiencers or whistleblowers who directly interacted withone or more of these alien groups. A summary table of these extraterrestrialgroups was developed listing how most contactees have described theextraterrestrials activities. These different extraterrestrial groups werecategorized in terms of where they stood on the issue of cooperating with theMilitary Industrial Complex to develop advanced technologies; that were used inclassified programs rather than being shared with humanity in general. InGalactic Diplomacy, it was suggested that those alien groups cooperating withnational security and corporate elites formed a “Military IndustrialExtraterrestrial Complex” (MIEC). The nineteen extraterrestrial groups examinedin Galactic Diplomacy were categorized either as belonging to the MIEC, oroperating outside of it.The following table gives a summary of the extraterrestrial groups cooperatingwith the MIEC; based on material in Galactic Diplomacy, and what has beendiscussed so far in terms of the Vril Society and Nazi SS cooperative effortswith different extraterrestrial groups, and intraterrestrials.

While Galactic Diplomacy provides a helpful overview of differentextraterrestrial groups based upon their interactions with the MilitaryIndustrial Complex and private citizens, it does not provide information abouthow these groups interact with the different secret space programs. As describedin earlier chapters, these programs have their distinct agendas and operations.This leads to a dynamically complex set of relationships with the visitingextraterrestrial groups, or “intraterrestrials” based in the Earth’s interior.It is vital to know whether the different extraterrestrial groups have organizedthemselves in any way to deal with the complex situation involving Earth and itsmultiple secret space programs that date from the modern era, as well as ancientcivilizations.In this regard, Corey Goode’s revelations are very helpful. Goode says thatextraterrestrials interact or collaborate with one or more of the above secretspace programs in terms of different alliances. Goode summarized the complexsituation as follows: > There are many who have been a part of the 3 separate Secret Space Programs> that are independent of the Secret Earth Governments (one of which is a> powerful Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate that owns most of the Mars> Bases). There are also 5-7 “Ancient Earth Break Away Civilizations” that have> Bases here on Earth.

"},{"pageContent":"Secret Space Program Alliance Goode revealed the existence of a “Secret Space Program (SSP) Alliance” whichwas formed around the Solar Warden program; that attracted like-minded groupsand programs, due to its more U.S. Constitutional mindset and ethical approachto Earth’s future. Defectors from the other secret space programs—theInterplanetary Corporate Conglomerate, Dark Fleet and the smaller rogueSAPs—brought ships, and resources with them. Goode says the SSP Alliance isheaded by a Council incorporating representatives from the different entitiesmaking up the Alliance: > The “SSP Alliance Council” is a group of leaders from various levels of> Battalions, Regiments, Divisions, Wings and Corps from each of the allied> groups that make up the Alliance.

Goode has described the “dark magic” as theability of these ancient bloodline elites to steer humanity into collectivelymanifesting oppressive conditions such as war, poverty and disease, which isalso disempowering on an individual level. "},{"pageContent":"Earth Alliance According to Goode, the Earth Alliance comprises different factions andorganizations involved in various supply, support and command roles when itcomes to the different secret space programs. The Earth Alliance includes “WhiteHats” among the military industrial elite of the U.S. and many other majorcountries that are supportive of the goals of the SSP Alliance. In addition, theEarth Alliance includes the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, SouthAfrica) that are attempting to break free from the “Babylonian Money MagicSystem” described by Goode. The BRICS alliance has made major strides indeveloping an alternative financial system to that controlled by theCabal/Illuminati. The Earth Alliance should not be confused with theCabal/Illuminati that play key roles in the ICC and Dark Fleet space programs,and smaller rogue SAPs involved in organizing false flag events.Goode claims he received the following briefing about the Earth Alliance in June2015: > > As we sat at the table and started up the discussion, much of the briefing> included quite mundane information as well as some deeper information.

His contact began> with them at almost the exact same time frame.[411]> [index_split_076.html#filepos863731] Goode also explained why the Sphere Being Alliance appointed him as delegate to“a UN Type Super Federation” of different extraterrestrial alliances that arevitally concerned about the Sphere Beings’ activities around the Earth and theSolar System: > The Sphere Alliance will not meet directly with the service to self beings.> Many of the ET Groups/Federations that meet at the UN Type Super Federation> are considered \"Good Guys,\" but are helping humanity out of a personal agenda> which is \"STS\" [Service-to-Self]. Even in these cases, the Sphere Alliance has> me attend as a delegate at these \"Super Federations\" to speak on their behalf.> [412] [index_split_076.html#filepos864111] Goode’s claim that the Sphere Being alliance “will not meet directly with theservice-to-self beings” is very controversial. It suggests that even forextraterrestrial groups performing what appear to be positive actions describedin Table 2, their motivations are still viewed as self-serving. This appearsodd. Yet it is understandable using Kardashev civilization typology. From theperspective of a Level III (or IV) civilization, Level I or II extraterrestrialcivilizations, while apparently performing benign actions, may still be actingout of self-interest to a degree. This is the main reason why Goode wasappointed as the Sphere Being Alliance delegate, in order to act as theirintermediary.Goode has described the result of the “cloaked spheres” being placedequidistantly throughout the solar system to buffer cosmic energies, whilesimultaneously acting as a frequency wall that effectively has quarantined thesolar system and the Earth: > The Sphere Alliance has setup 2 “Energy Barriers” that cannot be penetrated by> any beings or technology (be they 3/4D or 4/5D beings). One is the “Outer> Barrier” which completely closes off the entire Sol System (including> Gate/Portal travel) from travel into or out of the system. The other is a> “Barrier” that surrounds the Earth. It keeps every Being and Craft/Technology> that was either On Earth or in Near Earth Orbit from leaving a certain> distance from the Planet. There are active Gates/Portals that allow travel> between Planets within the Sol System. However, those Portals are affected by> these “Energetic Tsunami Waves” at times, and regular travel is ill advised> and can be dangerous.[413] [index_split_076.html#filepos864493] Goode describes how the Sphere Being Alliance provided technology to the SecretSpace Program Alliance, which allows them to prevent false flag and otherdestructive events from occurring on Earth during this time of planetarytransition due to incoming cosmic energies: > The technology provided directly to the SSP Alliance has ALL been of a> defensive nature. It allows the Alliance to disrupt weapons systems, cloaking> systems, and highly shielded vessels and locations from various types of high> energy beam and torsion field weapons (torsion weapons that rip apart> buildings or craft by twisting the space/time fabric that the structure exists> in at the moment, causing the targeted structure to rip apart etc.)...[414]> [index_split_076.html#filepos865128] In short, the Secret Space Program Alliance has had its position strengthenedconsiderably by the Sphere Being Alliance in dealing with other alliances;especially so with the most disruptive and manipulative among them, theDraconian Federation Alliance. "},{"pageContent":"Draconian Federation Alliance Chapter four discussed the Dark Fleet and its cooperation with a DraconianFederation Alliance. The Draco Alliance appears to be a strict hierarchicalorganization, comprising a warlike extraterrestrial race called the Draconians.The ruling caste of the Draconian Federation Alliance is a group of what Goodedescribes as Royal White Dracos. They are very intimidating 14 foot tall beings,with very powerful psychic abilities, and appear to be like dragons. AlexCollier, who claims to have had contact with extraterrestrials from theAndromeda Council, calls these ruling caste Draconians the “Ciakar”: > The Draconians are a very large reptilian race, otherwise known as \"the> Dracs\". There is a royal line of the reptilian race called the Ciakar. They> range from 14 to 22 feet tall and can weigh up to 1,800 pounds. They do have> winged appendages and they are awesome beings. They're extremely clairvoyant> and extremely clever, and they can also be extremely sinister.[415]> [index_split_076.html#filepos865763]> http://exopolitics.org/Report-ET-Motivations.htm#_edn45 According to Collier, the Royal White Draco (aka Ciakars) are “the oldest knownreptilian race in our galaxy.”[416] [index_split_076.html#filepos866251] Goodeclaims that he came face to face with the Royal White Draco in charge of theDraconian Federation Alliance’s activities in our solar system, who offered toevacuate the solar system with his Draconian forces if the Sphere Being Alliancelifted its quarantine.[417] [index_split_076.html#filepos866737]Goode has provided a summary of the testimony of another witness, Lt. Col.Gonzales (pseudonym), who has also attended a meeting with the Draco Federation.He described his encounter in a briefing to Goode as follows: > Standing behind the Reptilian Honor Guard were Mantid and Insectoid Beings who> were now being very still and standing in a loose formation. In our last> encounter they were roaming about the entire time. Gonzales said he saw the> White Royal Draco standing in the front and middle of the formation of these> other beings.[418] [index_split_076.html#filepos867214] Threats were made against the other alliances as a result of the “Outer Barrier”created by the Sphere Being Alliance: > This same White Royal Draco now made demands wrapped in threats for Gonzales> to deliver to the SSP Alliance Council and the Sphere Alliance. The demand was> that all of the Draco Federation Alliance would be allowed to leave through> the Outer Barrier as they wished, and that their human allies would be given> clemency, and promised no reprisals in future events in a human controlled Sol> System.[419] [index_split_076.html#filepos867684] Among the goals of the “Outer Barrier”—a frequency wall built by the “SphereBeing Alliance” to buffer incoming cosmic energies—was to impose a solar systemwide blockade. This would prevent the movement of people, space fleets andresources while incoming cosmic energies were being integrated. The blockade hadcreated major problems for the Draconian Federation, which made dire threats ifit wasn’t lifted: > The White Royal stated in no uncertain terms that they had the power to bring> great calamity and war to the surface of the Earth, and were prepared to do> so. They stated that the Sphere Alliance had not been forthcoming in the true> power of their Extra Dimensional Overlords, who were now present and ready to> do battle beside the Draco Federation Alliance, as had been prophesied about> their empire millions of years ago.[420] [index_split_076.html#filepos868154] This is where “Gonzales” became very surprised to learn that the White RoyalDracos were not at the apex of the Draconian Federation Alliance. There wereExtraDimensional (ED) overlords that were responsible for the creation ofArtificial Intelligence, as he revealed to Goode: > They boasted that these same ED Overlords were responsible in some way for the> entities that we called the ED/ET Artificial Intelligence that is their ally> and had conquered entire galaxies. Gonzales stated the grandiose boasting and> threats went on for some time in the same theatrical manner before the White> Royal Draco let go of his mind, and turned and lumbered out of the room with> his Reptilian Honor Guard and the Insectoid delegation.[421]> [index_split_076.html#filepos868624] Goode has emphasized the threat posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to manythousands of extraterrestrial civilizations and to humanity in the presentera.[422] [index_split_076.html#filepos869094] As described in chapter eight,Solar Warden and other secret space programs take stringent security measures toprevent an AI signal infecting both biological and electronic systems. The “EDOverlords,” controlling both the AI and the Draconian Federation Alliance,suggests a similar Satanic occult force that was discussed earlier concerningthe Nazi SS Black Sun Order and emergence of the Dark Fleet. "},{"pageContent":"Super Federation—Human Looking Extraterrestrials Goode describes a Super Federation of between 40 to 60 human-likeextraterrestrial groups that are very interested in humanity’s future. The SuperFederation involves the groups identified in Table 2, and others who are partsof difference galactic councils and federations: “The Super Federation is alarger group made up of a United Nations-type organization of other “Human-Like”ET Federations, Confederations and Councils.”[423][index_split_076.html#filepos869597]Goode describes this Super Federation as also being trapped behind a frequencyfence created by the Sphere Alliance: > There are Several ET Federations that are working together in a sort of Super> Federation of Humanlike ET's, as well as an alliance of Non-Human ET's; that> have \"Delegates\" and \"Members\" trapped in our Sol System right now behind the> \"Outer Barrier\".

His comments are similar to AlexCollier who said: > In a nut shell, we are a composite of a lot of different races, 22 to be> exact. It is a physiological fact that there are 22 different body types on> the planet. And that is the result of the extraterrestrial races.[425]> [index_split_076.html#filepos870451] The extent of long-term genetic experimentation on Earth by 22 extraterrestrialcivilizations helps explain why the Sphere Being Alliance regards theiractivities as self-serving. By refusing to deal directly with the SuperFederation, and instead appointing Goode to be their delegate, the Sphere BeingAlliance was sending a powerful message to members of the Super Federation.Discussions over humanity’s future had to take into consideration theaspirations of humanity from a different perspective than was previously thecase at Super Federation meetings, where long term biological projects weregiven priority. Goode attended meetings of the Super Federation during his covert secret spaceprogram service (1987 -2007) and more recently as a delegate for the SphereBeing Alliance. He described the variety of human looking extraterrestrials heencountered at a meeting on June 7, 2015: > There are normally at most 40 groups at these conferences.

Gonzales has also attended a Super Federation meeting and described hisencounter in a briefing to Goode as follows: > He went on to tell me about the arrival at the Federation Council Meeting> Facility.

Relations began breaking down in the late 1990’s, when leaders of theSolar Warden program began seriously questioning the agenda of the other twoprograms and what the Cabal/Illuminati was secretly doing with the various rogueSAPs under its control. This is well illustrated in the case of Vice Admiral TomWilson that was discussed in chapter eight. Wilson was head of the Joint Chiefsof Staff Intelligence service when, in 1997, he was denied access to SAPsinvolving extraterrestrial technologies that were revealed to him by EdgarMitchell and Steven Greer.An overview of the gradual breakdown in relations between the difference SpaceProgram Alliances is given by Goode: > Before the breakdown in the overall relations between the factions that were> once united through the “Secret Earth Governments” (and their “Syndicates”> known as the Cabal/Illuminati and various other Secret Societies), and their> Controllers (Draco Federation Royals and Ancient Earth/Human Break Away> Civilizations that have deceived many and presented themselves as ET’s from> various Star Systems), there has been quite a lot of chaos among these groups> which has resulted in them turning on each other.

These defectorscomprised units from the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate, the Dark Fleet,as well as rogue SAPs controlled by the Cabal Illuminati. The defectors providedactionable intelligence that led to two incidents that proved very divisive: > Over the last 6 months, there have also been some defections of assets from> the Cabal controlled ICC Secret Space Program, remnants of the Dark Fleet> (which is not a Draco Fleet but a Human SSP Fleet that serves alongside the> Draco Alliance) that were not caught outside of the Outer Barrier, as well as> various other Military Black Ops SSP Program Members.

This caused a rift between some of> the SSP Alliance Council who had different ideas on how they should proceed,> as well as some mistrust of the new defectors from the other SSP’s that had> recently joined and also obviously had a different moral outlook and idea of> the rules of engagement.[432] [index_split_076.html#filepos873860] The possibility of military hostilities escalating into more overt actions ledto a conference meeting, where the Blue Avians were consulted over what therules of engagement should be leading up to the “full disclosure event” desiredby the Secret Space Program Alliance. Goode wrote: > In the first big joint conference with all of the SSP Alliance Council and the> SSP Alliance beings that appeared, the question was asked of the Blue Avians> what the rules of engagement should be.

In early May 2015, after a five yearhiatus, Wikileaks restored its electronic drop box for whistleblowers to againanonymously share data.[436] [index_split_076.html#filepos875768] All is inplace for an organization like Wikileaks to share the document dumps that Goodeclaims will reveal all. The re-emergence of Wikileaks is either a remarkablecoincidence, or compelling circumstantial evidence that plans are underway todump a large number of classified documents concerning secret space programsinto the public arena.Testimony by Goode is a part of the process leading to a full disclosure eventthat will be examined in more detail in chapter 15. In addition to describingthe different Secret Space Program Alliances and their connections to variousextraterrestrial groups, Goode has revealed details of secret bases on the Moonand Mars that correspond closely with the claims of other whistleblowers. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter12 Secret Moon Base—Lunar Operations Command During the Apollo 11 moon landing, there was a two minute period of radiosilence. According to NASA, the problem arose from one of two television camerasoverheating, thus disrupting the reception. What really happened, according tovarious sources, was that Armstrong and Aldrin saw something else watching them!According to Timothy Good, author of Above Top Secret, HAM radio operatorsreceiving the VHF signals transmitted from Apollo 11 to NASA’s Houstonheadquarters, intercepted the following message which NASA screened from thepublic in the missing two minutes: > Mission Control:> What's there? Mission Control calling Apollo 11. > Apollo 11:> These babies are huge, sir … enormous…. Oh, God, you wouldn't believe it! I'm> telling you there are other space craft out there… lined up on the far side of> the crater edge… they're on the moon watching us.[437]> [index_split_076.html#filepos876203] The HAM operator’s radio intercept was widely dismissed by the media, but in1975 it received unexpected support. Maurice Chatelain is a retired NASAcommunications engineer who helped develop the communications system used in theApollo moon missions. In his 1975 book, Our Cosmic Ancestors, he wrote: > [O]nly moments before Armstrong stepped down the ladder to set foot on the> Moon, two UFOs hovered overhead. Edwin Aldrin took several pictures of them.> Some of these photographs have been published in the June 1975 issue of Modern> People magazine.”[438] [index_split_076.html#filepos876557] Later, in 1979, Chatelain said that Armstrong’s sighting of two UFOs over alunar crater was being deliberately kept from the media and public by NASA: “The encounter was common knowledge in NASA, but nobody has talked about ituntil now.”[439] [index_split_076.html#filepos876773] Even more remarkably,Chatelain claimed that: > …all Apollo and Gemini flights were followed, both at a distance and sometimes> also quite closely, by space vehicles of extraterrestrial origin—flying> saucers, or UFOs, if you want to call them by that name. Every time it> occurred, the astronauts informed Mission Control, who then ordered absolute> silence. [440] [index_split_076.html#filepos877087] Was the missing two minutes of radio silence during the Apollo 11 moon landingan attempt by NASA to cover up what Armstrong really saw on the moon? Were UFOsightings a common occurrence during Apollo missions?According to Buzz Aldrin in a number of press interviews, Apollo 11 was indeedwatched by a UFO during its journey to the moon. Aldrin describes how the Apollo11 astronauts avoiding mentioning the word UFO in reporting what they werewitnessing, and instead asked Houston about the location of the Saturn V launchrocket. Aldrin’s admission that Apollo 11 was being shadowed by a UFO does givecredence to the belief that UFO’s did witness the moon landing, and Armstronghad reported this to NASA in a radio communication that resulted in the missingtwo minutes of radio silence. Aldrin’s admission also supports Chatelain’s claimthat one or more unknown spacecraft watched the Apollo 11 moon landing, asChatelain wrote in his book.In addition to Chatelain, there is another source supporting the claims thatNeil Armstrong had witnessed two huge spacecraft over a lunar crater watchingthe Apollo 11 moon landing. According to Timothy Good, Dr. Vladimir Azhazha, aphysicist who was a Professor of Mathematics at Moscow University during thetime stated: > “Neil Armstrong relayed the message to Mission Control that two large,> mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the moon> module. But his message was never head by the public—because NASA censored> it.[441] [index_split_076.html#filepos877401] So why did NASA eventually terminate the Apollo missions if unknown spacecraftwere already were there and watching the Earth? The answer according toArmstrong, as relayed by an unnamed Professor at a NASA symposium, follows: > Professor: What really happened out there with Apollo 11? > Armstrong: It was incredible … of course, we had always known there was a> possibility … the fact is, we were warned off. There was never any questions> then of a space station or a moon city. > Professor: How do you mean “warned off”? > Armstrong: I can’t go into details, except to say that their ships were far> superior to ours both in size and technology—Boy, where they big! … and> menacing …. No, there is no question of a space station. > Professor: But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11? > Armstrong: Naturally—NASA was committed at that time, and couldn’t risk a> panic on earth…. But it really was a quick scoop and back again.[442]> [index_split_076.html#filepos877574] So what’s the truth? Did Neil Armstrong really see large unknown spacecraft onthe moon that were part of a warning for NASA not to return?With Armstrong’s death, we will perhaps never have his personal version of whatreally happened on that July day in 1969. Perhaps NASA will one day release anofficial version of what really happened, or have they already done so through afictional movie admission by Buzz Aldrin? In the movie Transformers: Dark of theMoon, Buzz Aldrin in a cameo role, comes forward to reveal a version of thetruth about what he and Armstrong saw on the moon. The movie depicts Armstrongand Aldrin traveling to a nearby derelict spacecraft during a 21 minute periodof radio silence after the moon landing. In the movie, while he is on the moon,Aldrin is speaking on a secret black operations radio line to NASA: > Buzz Aldrin: You cannot believe what we're seeing… > Black Ops NASA Technician: We are not alone after all, are we? > Buzz Aldrin: No, sir. We're not alone.[443]> [index_split_076.html#filepos877747] So what did Armstrong and Aldrin see during the first Moon landing, which warnedNASA to stay away?

Goode’s claim is supported byVladimir Terziski: > The Germans landed on the Moon as early as probably 1942, utilizing their> larger exo-atmospheric rocket saucers of the Miethe and Schriever type. The> Miethe rocket craft was built in diameters of 15 and 50 meters, and the> Schriever Walter turbine powered craft was designed as an interplanetary> exploration vehicle.

In chapter five it was revealed that the large cigar-shapedAndromeda Device developed for interstellar travel used a temporal drive basedon a tachyon device. Terziski is saying these tachyon devices were also used forsmaller craft: “The free energy tachyon drive craft of the Haunebu-1 and 2 typewere used after 1944 to haul people, materiel and the first robots to theconstruction site on the Moon.”[446] [index_split_076.html#filepos878782]Terziski went on to describe what happened more than a decade later when thefirst U.S. and Soviet secret space programs were able to touch down on the moon: > When Russians and Americans secretly landed jointly on the Moon in the early> fifties with their own saucers, they spent their first night there as guests> of the....

Goode claims that the Vril/Nazi base wasessentially handed over to the U.S. as a result of secret agreements that hadbeen reached in the early 1950’s: > This base was still being built when they made the break through deals with> the Americans in the early 1950’s that gave them access to the Industrial> Might that had cost them the European War.

From what I also understand there’s been a couple times when war> did come to the back side of the moon and it was bad enough in such a way that> everyone said no, no, not here.

That’s about as> much as I know about Lunar Operations Command.[453]> [index_split_076.html#filepos881673] In a May 2015 email interview, Goode similarly described the moon being dividedup into zones similar to Antarctica: > The moon is divided into Embassy Zones (much like maps of Antarctica) that> belong to dozens of different off-world groups (and ancient break away human> groups) that do not get along. Many of the worst enemies are based only a few> kilometers away from each other and have done so for thousands of years in> peace. The Moon is a diplomatic zone and conflict is not tolerated on or> around it. Diplomatic territory is highly respected and not trespassed on by> other groups. [454] [index_split_076.html#filepos882127] Goode goes on to give a possible answer to who it was that warned the Apolloastronauts to stay away from the Moon: > If the Apollo landings chose to land in some of these diplomatic zones (which> is just about every square inch of the moon) they more than likely landed on> territory of a group that did not appreciate it. They were most likely given a> stern request to leave and not return to this location by whatever group they> were trespassing on. [455] [index_split_076.html#filepos882586] Cramer’s and Goode’s testimony reveals that the moon is a very ancient outpostfor a number of extraterrestrial groups, and also secret space programs datingfrom the Nazi era, that have built bases there. The likelihood that the Apollomissions resulted in a violation of one or more of the sovereignty claims ofthese groups helps answer why the moon missions came to a sudden halt in 1972.Moon landings by NASA and other nations had not occurred for over forty years,until China’s unmanned Jade Rabbit rover successfully landed in December 2013. "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER13 Comparing Mars Whistleblower Testimonies Serving a twenty year tour of duty in the secret space programs is thefundamental claim of three whistleblowers: Michael Relfe, Randy Cramer and CoreyGoode. Relfe and Cramer cite extended service on Mars for their tours. LikeGoode, Relfe and Cramer claim that after the completion of their covert service,they were “age-regressed” and sent back in time using classified technologies.Relfe and Cramer further say that chemicals and technologies were used in anattempt to remove their memories of their covert service.Similarities in Relfe’s and Cramer’s testimonies regarding the core elements oftheir recruitment, service and return to civilian life are consistent withGoode’s extraordinary claims. This all suggests that secret space programsrecruit personnel for twenty year tours of duties before using a standardoperating procedure to remove their memories and place them back in society.In 2000, a book titled The Mars Records was published containing the testimonyof Relfe, who claimed that he had volunteered to join a secret space programcalled the “Mars Defense Force.”[456] [index_split_076.html#filepos883076]According to Relfe, he served a twenty year tour of duty mainly on Mars; wherehis psychic abilities were used in a variety of increasingly sophisticated ways,from a passive form of “remote viewing” to “psychic assassination.” Relfeclaimed that he killed 70 high profile targets comprising human VIPs,extraterrestrial entities, and synthetic life forms embodying artificialintelligence. Relfe’s story was largely dismissed at the time because hisincredible claims were offered without sufficient evidence to back them up. Themore recent public testimonies of Cramer and Goode are consistent with the coreelements of Relfe’s alleged secret space program service. This requires acomparative study of Relfe’s remarkable testimony with Cramer’s, along with asummary of key elements of Goode’s testimony as discussed so far. "},{"pageContent":"Michael Relfe and The Mars Records The Mars Records was authored and published by Stephanie Relfe, a professionalkinesiologist, who first met Michael Relfe in 1996, and decided to help himovercome deep emotional issues. In the process of undergoing a therapeutictechnique developed by Stephanie to release the negative emotional chargesrelated to past trauma, Michael Relf’s covert service on Mars was uncovered.The Mars Records contains the detailed process used by Stephanie to assistMichael to retrieve his memories. The book serves multiple purposes. It is arecord of Michael’s 20 year service with the Mars Defense Force and a secretspace program. The book also defines how to unlock memories hidden in deepcompartments of the human mind, describing how to overcome the various mindcontrol road blocks intended to sabotage memory recovery. Finally, the bookreveals how Michael and Stephanie overcame the efforts of a shadowy governmentalentity intervening to prevent any of the information about Mars and the secretspace program going public.Michael Relfe’s story began at age six when he remembers being abducted by Grayaliens. Over the successive years, Relfe claims that the ‘Grays’ upgraded hispsychic abilities during his abductions. Relfe doesn’t recall being part of anyofficial military program as a child. Whatever the Grays were doing, however,shadow government authorities were monitoring the situation, and had their ownfuture plans for him as he explained in a February 2000 interview: > It appears that I have been a “lab rat” all my life. Modifications were made> to my father, which resulted in me. Modifications (genetic) were made to me at> a young age and while growing up. Somewhere along the way I was encouraged> (programmed) to join the Navy. The government knew my psychological> profile.[457] [index_split_076.html#filepos883578] In The Mars Records, Relfe gives more details of how the authorities monitoredthe alien abductions: > The government's involved, and so are the aliens. Something to do with my> father—that's how they know about me, cause my Dad worked for the government….> They did something to him. I'm the result of what they did.[458]> [index_split_076.html#filepos884154] Relfe explained how his future enlistment in the Navy was part of a covert plan: > The whole thing in the navy was a set-up. It wasn't an accident I joined the> navy—they knew and guided me. We weren't picked out because we were smart—it's> because of our genetics. We're chosen in grade school.[459]> [index_split_076.html#filepos884536] In 1976, Relfe joined the Navy and was soon after approached by a recruiter toalso join a highly classified military program. He accepted and signed a twentyyear tour of duty with the secret space program. Relfe was to serve with the“Mars Defense Force” and travelled through what he described as a teleportationdevice called a “jump gate” to Mars to begin his service: > When I was recruited I am awakened at night. There are 2 people to a room. He> tells me to follow them. I'm still sleepy. I go down the hall. We meet the> officer. He tells us about the program. It's past midnight. Volunteers are> asked for. I'm not given a chance to go back to my room. We're led down the> hall. We're still in the barracks. We're led into a room. It's a camouflaged> room—build to look something like a broom closet. There are steps into the> underground area. Underneath the Great Lakes base, there is an entire> underground area.… The tunnel. The base I'm to be assigned to is the Mars> base. The way to get there is through the jump gate. It's like a tunnel> through hyper-space.[460] [index_split_076.html#filepos884917] Relfe says that while on Mars, his psychic abilities were artificially enhancedby chemical substances and technologies, so that he rapidly transitioned frombeing able to psychically view distant events (remote viewing) to being able toinfluence the events (remote influencing). Eventually, his psychic abilitiesbecame so powerful that he became a psychic assassin, which he claims he waspersonally suited for: > … not everyone involved in TRV (Tactical Remote Viewing) is chosen for target> termination. It takes a certain personality to be effective as an assassin. I> was cold, hard and arrogant … I have a high Psi efficiency, “raw horsepower”> if you will, so much so that my final target termination count was 70> terminations. Some of these were reptilians. And I survived those operations.> When operational, I was VERY good at my job.[461]> [index_split_076.html#filepos885302] With the enhanced psychic abilities he now possessed, Relfe describes thevarious missions he was tasked to undergo culminating in his psychicassassinations: > The missions that I performed at different stages varied from recon (data> gathering) to defense to offensive. > Recon - Data Gathering, Covert Spying, etc. Remote Viewing can be shielded> against. You have to have control and finesse to be effective against a> shield. > Defense - Differing assignments according to the \"power\" of the talent. Ranges> from lightweight, general \"monitoring\" of a region, to active defense of a> region, to active defense of an installation, to active defense of a selected> VIP target.> These regions can be on planet or in an area surrounding the planet. Sometimes> the defense is \"mental\". Sometimes you are hooked into offensive and defensive> weapons systems. > Offensive - Remote Viewing used as an offensive tactical weapon to terminate> selected VIP targets (assassination). Even with the machines, this job> requires a \"talent\" of high \"horsepower\" and low compassion for other beings.> Most RV people never come close to this level. > These jobs are a progression \"upward\". I remember being very good against> shields. Later after gaining experience I became offensive and proficient at> termination. The final count was 70 targets terminated.[462]> [index_split_076.html#filepos885877] Relfe claims that in order to relieve stress, there was some rotation in jobassignments. He requested and was subsequently assigned to be a space fighterpilot where he continued to fight alien and hostile threats to the Mars DefenseForce and the secret space program using his telepathic abilities. He writes: > I \"know\" that this is a very stressful type of procedure and that duty> rotation is required. I also \"know\" that I was given a choice of other types> of training and I chose flight training…[463]> [index_split_076.html#filepos886270] During this time I also served as a> combat pilot in a single seat attack spacecraft of some type. I feel that my> telepathic “talent” was also used in this role.[464]> [index_split_076.html#filepos886669] During his 20 year service, Relfe said that there were strict orders in place toprevent any information about people and events on Earth being shared with himand other secret space program personal. According to Relfe: > The program works the way it does because NO ONE on duty (who will eventually> be time shot back to their origin) is permitted to interact with any time> event (or person) of earth while stationed on Mars Base. That means that> visitors and VIP’s are OFF limits.[465] [index_split_076.html#filepos887049] At the end of his 20 year service in 2002, age-regression and time-traveltechnology was used to send him back to the time of his enlistment in 1976 tocomplete his six year Navy service as part of his ‘normal’ life. Relfe describesthe process as follows: > The age regression was pure boredom. Being kept in a dreamlike, semi-conscious> state for weeks was very boring. That’s the only memory I have been able to> recall. The 20-year time jump back to 1976 was over before it began. Walking> through the tunnel was uneventful.[466] [index_split_076.html#filepos887625] While the idea of age-regression seems fantastic, it’s worth pointing out that aspecific aging gene has been discovered, and that various anti-agingtechnologies are under development.[467] [index_split_076.html#filepos888201]Highly classified gene research, decades ahead of the open source scientificliterature, has likely been able to manipulate the aging gene to produce effectssuch as reverse-aging. Relfe’s description of the process as boring likelydescribes how this kind of advanced gene therapy requires a laboriousapplication process.A variety of mind control techniques were used on Relfe to prevent him fromrecovering memories of his covert space service, and to suppress his psychicabilities. He describes what happened: > At the conclusion of active duty in the program, I was “age reversed” twenty> years and sent back to earth to complete my normal time line. Memory blocks> were placed into me to prevent memory recall. Implants were placed into me to> block my metaphysical abilities and track my location and movements. The> result of these “memory blocks” was that I was negatively affected in my> family life, relationships, health and employment…[468]> [index_split_076.html#filepos888771] In addition, Relfe says that he was forcibly abducted for a “monthly medicalexam” by secret space program authorities. In 2000, he wrote about thisexperience in his concluding thoughts to The Mars Records: > My involvement continues to the present time. I am visited by members of this> group monthly. When in an “altered state”, I am “programmed” to accompany them> without question and I am then transported to an unknown location where I am> given a medical checkup. A procedure is then performed on me where> tissue/cells/biological materials are removed from incisions on both sides of> my groin area. I am returned to my place of origin.[469]> [index_split_076.html#filepos889153] Relfe says that he was able to stop the abductions in 2002, through prayer andother preventive measures. He wrote a message in his book to Governmentauthorities protesting what had happened to him, and demanding compensation forhis covert service. He wrote: > Where is the compensation that you promised? I think you still owe me back pay> with interest, a monthly retirement check at Captain rank with greater than> twenty years service and a benefits package including health insurance. I> expect a check ASAP![470] [index_split_076.html#filepos889534] Relfe believes that his disclosure is being tacitly allowed by senior officialsin the secret space program who have been monitoring him: > There have been no attempts to stop these sessions from being recorded nor> have we been contacted by any “official” representatives from any group. It> may be that these individuals are so far beyond the reach of anyone that they> don’t care about books such as these, and in fact allow them so as to help> their ongoing program of introducing the planetary population to the existence> of “aliens”.[471] [index_split_076.html#filepos889915] Soon after his book’s release, Relfe was interviewed in February 2000 by EveLorgen from the website, Alien Love Bite,[472][index_split_076.html#filepos890296] and in July 2000 by Theresa de Veto fromthe website, Surfing The Apocalypse.[473] [index_split_076.html#filepos890872]These are the only two interviews listed on the Mars Records website whereMichael and Stephanie Relfe were questioned about his covert service on Mars andthe secret space fleet.There have been other whistleblowers claiming to have visited Mars through jumpgate technologies, who also experienced age regression and time traveltechnologies.[474] [index_split_076.html#filepos891271] However, Relfe was alonewith his main claim in 2000 that a secret space program existed that recruitedindividuals for covert 20 year assignments that was allegedly a standardoperating procedure. That changed in early 2014. Figure 30. Michael Relfe's Timelines[images/00001.jpg] "},{"pageContent":"Randy Cramer and the “Mars Defense Force” In March 2014, Randy Cramer, using the pseudonym “Captain Kaye,” came forwardwith his claims of a 20 year tour of duty with a classified space program from1987 to 2007. He for the first time revealed his “total recall” of his covertspace program service, in a five part series of interviews I conducted withhim.[475] [index_split_076.html#filepos891624] He says that he served the first17 years of his tour of duty, with an infantry unit on Mars that was part ofwhat he called the “Mars Defense Force,” whose primary mission was to defendfive civilian colonies owned by the “Mars Colony Corporation.”[476][index_split_076.html#filepos892087] After first signing on for his tour of duty at Lunar Operations Command, Cramerexplains what he was told upon his arrival on Mars in 1987: > At that point I arrive at Aries Prime, and at that point we all get informed> that we are now members of the Mars Defense Force (MDF). The MDF is the> specific military organization, private contracted military organization,> which is specifically contracted to serve under the MCC [Mars Colony> Corporation] to protect and defend the Mars Colony Corporation and its> interests. We got informed you are now a member of the Mars Defense Force, you> will be assigned a chit, a little card, paper work that is going to tell which> shuttle you are going to get on.

My understanding is> that we were on Mars the very first time around the mid-60s, but really didn’t> try to do anything serious, or really prepared to do anything with that until> the 1970s. My understanding is that our first exploratory mission that was> sent there to stay any length of time was 1970. Then after a few years it was> decided that we were ready to go ahead and establish a Mars Colony Corporation> foothold, and set up a few settlements and attempt to do some mining, and> extract some resources to make it pay for itself. Apparently that was about> 1975, when the Mars Colony Corporation set foot on Mars and started its first> mining operation. That was 1975 to my understanding, as I was briefed.[478]> [index_split_076.html#filepos893023] After completing his covert Mars service, Cramer says that he served as a pilotwith a secret space program called the “Earth Defense Force,” where he patrolledthe solar system from a cigar-shaped spacecraft carrier.In an interview Cramer described his training to fly spacecraft belonging to theEarth Defense Force:> > Training was like any other rudimentary training process I would expect. Like> any others, a certain amount of briefings, a certain amount of classroom time,> a certain amount of marching around time, a certain amount of simulator time,> and then a certain amount of getting into actual vehicles and flying them.> They had for the most part, really three different types of fighter craft, and> two or three different types of bomber class craft. I was never trained to fly> … the large craft like we flew from the Moon to Mars in, for instance. That> was some other kind of pilot training program. Pilots who flew those vehicles> were not in our flight school. What we were learning were mostly smaller> military craft, three different fighter class; and two, sometimes a third> bomber class.[479] [index_split_076.html#filepos893509]> In response to a question of where his space pilot training took place, he said:> > That was back on Lunar Operations Command, and then about midway through we> transferred to an outer training system which is on Titan, I want to say, yes> it was on Titan. Then we did the last half of the training which was more out,> farther out into the solar system, out from Titan. So we started out kind of> close, on the moon, then moved out to Titan, then got a little farther> out.[480] [index_split_076.html#filepos893885]> Cramer describes some of his pilot duties in deep space: > There were four air wings on the Nautilus [cigar-shaped space carrier] at that> time. They rotated.… It was a lot of patrolling where you’re taking vehicles> away from the main ship in order to check a perimeter or cover a grid, or a> quadrant grid, or something like [that], and do patrolling maneuvers looking> for, scanning for any anomalous activity, or seeing if you would run into> anything that might be hostile….[481] [index_split_076.html#filepos894285]> In an interview, Cramer was asked whether he was given access to informationabout Earth and replied: > In fact all information about what was going on on Earth, newspapers, media,> all that was strictly forbidden, and any possession or knowledge of such> things, or communication or talking about such things could be met with pretty> severe punishments. It was not what we were supposed to be … essentially it> was made very clear to us, “look if you’re thinking about what’s happening> back home, you’re not going to be thinking about your job. We need you a 100%> here on your job, right now. The only thing you need to think about home are> the fond memories you have of it, and that you want to go back to. [482]> [index_split_076.html#filepos894683] Cramer described the propulsion system of the spacecraft carrier he served on: > Essentially this class of vehicle is more of the cigar shape, as opposed to> disc or other shape… There’s a front and a long middle, and then an end. The> end is the engine section and the propulsion section which is an interesting> combination of things as I understand.… my understanding was that it was a> complex system of propulsion technologies that included kinds of nuclear> power, fission or fusion power, and kinds of other newer technology powers,> and sort of newer propulsion systems as far as electrogravitic propulsion> drives, or temporal space drives, as well as some traditional thrusting drive> propulsion.[483] [index_split_076.html#filepos895086] Cramer’s comment that the cigar-shaped space carriers used temporal drives isconsistent with the evolution of this class of interstellar capable spacecraft,as discussed in chapter five.Cramer says that prior to his 20 year tour of duty, he was trained as asupersoldier. Mind control technologies were used to enhance his physicalabilities during a 12 year childhood training program called, “Operation MoonShadow.”[484] [index_split_076.html#filepos895486] This was done through acovert branch of the U.S. Marine Corps Cramer referred to as special section(s.s.). He said that the mind control techniques used on him and other MarineCorps s.s. recruits was not trauma based, as was common with other covertprograms: > The techniques used to make me have been described to me as a> “with-the-grain” style of programming as opposed to most “against-the-grain”> styles of programming that try to force Super Soldiers to kill anything,> anytime, anywhere—and as human animals, most of us just aren’t made that way,> so we resist—and the main function then becomes ‘suppressing’ the urge to> resist. Rather than creating the best Super Soldier you can, you only create> the most compliant. The “with-the-grain” style programming doesn’t try to> create something that kills on command, but, rather, it creates a deep-seated> instinct to protect its tribe and its territory when threatened. So, as long> as you can explain the threat credibly, the soldier will use all of its> strength and cunning to destroy any that would harm those it’s genetically> predisposed to protect.[485] [index_split_076.html#filepos895891] Perhaps most importantly, Cramer claims that he is acting under the orders ofhis military chain of command in revealing his knowledge of the Mars DefenseForce and the secret space program he served on: > Col. Jamieson put me in touch with a man identifying himself as Brigadier> General Smythe. General Smythe gave me a fairly long-winded explanation about> the “soulless pricks” (his words) on “the Committee” that he was supposed to> answer to, and the serious disagreements by USMC s.s. brass with said> Committee. Without elaborating, I was satisfied with his explanation of the> situation on his end. When he personally gave me the go-ahead (he said, and I> quote, “I’m giving you the go-ahead to go public with everything you know…”),> I asked, “Everything?” and he said, “EVERYTHING!” and then we had a deal. As> long as I had the assurance that my direct chain of command was behind me and> that I had no restrictions on truthful content, I knew it was for real—and> that HE was for real. No one—not even an enemy—would want me to do that, or> tell me to do that. He even said I could use his name, which I just did, to> let the people who need to know, that I answer to him, and only to him… and if> they didn’t like it, they could take it up with him, or the CMC. Figure 31. Randy Cramer's Timelines[images/00026.jpg] "},{"pageContent":"A Comparison of Testimonies: Michael Relfe vs. Randy Cramer There are significant similarities between Relfe’s and Cramer’s testimonies, andsome important differences. Both allege they were supersoldiers in the “MarsDefense Force” while stationed on Mars. They both claim to have receivedphysical enhancements and mind control procedures, whereby they were able tofight against extraterrestrials and other ‘hostiles.’ Relfe and Cramer also eachstate that they worked under a total communication blackouts with Earth duringtheir respective services.After a period of time serving on Mars for Relfe and Cramer (17 years), theywere transferred to a space fleet and trained to pilot small spacecraft used forcombat operations and other purposes. Both attest they were promoted to the rankof Captain.Also, they both claim to have been age-regressed and sent back in time to whenthey were initially recruited. Relfe reports that the process took two weeks,while Cramer says the age-regression process took several weeks tocomplete.[486] [index_split_076.html#filepos896334] The extended length of timefor the age-regression process, according to Relfe, is necessary as he describesin The Mars Record (Vol 1, p. 72): “They have to be careful they don’t make youyoung too fast—you can lose your personality.”[487][index_split_076.html#filepos896912]Another point of similarity is that both were able to achieve full memory recallafter 20 year periods of normal civilian life. For Relfe, his covert service wasfrom 1976 to 1996, before reliving the 20 years in his ‘normal’ timeline. It wasin late 1996 that Michael Relfe started working with Stephanie Relfe and beganthe memory recall process. For Cramer, after living and reliving the two 20 yearlife experiences in space and then on Earth from 1987 to 2007, it was after 2007that he was able to move forward through regaining all his memories. In aninterview, Cramer said that “total recall” could only be achieved once the twooverlapping timelines had concluded.Finally, both Relfe and Cramer say that the extra pay and benefits they werepromised were never received. According to Michael and Stephanie Relfe: > We often wonder—what happened to the extra pay? How does he [Michael] get the> pension he deserves after working for over 20 years for the military? [488]> [index_split_076.html#filepos897292] Cramer describes a similar process whereby he was told, by a junior officer whohelped him in the signing of his formal recruitment papers, how he would befinancially taken care of at the end of his covert military service. > He then pulls out a stack of paperwork and says, here’s your contract, I’m> supposed to go over this with you, and talk about any questions you have, and> get you to initial and sign in the right places, and then you move along.> There was some kind of discussion of him saying, OK, this is what you are> going to do, you’re signing for a 20 year tour of service, but again don’t> worry, it’s going to be alright.

We’ll take care of you, you’ll be fine.[489]> [index_split_076.html#filepos897461] Finally, both Relfe and Cramer claim that they are being allowed to come forwardto release their testimonies. In the case of Relfe, this was done indirectly;through no interference in his The Mars Records books being published. Cramerclaims he was given direct authorization to do so by a Brigadier General in theUSMCss. "},{"pageContent":"A Comparison of Testimonies: Randy Cramer vs. Corey Goode I next examine the remarkable similarities between Cramer’s and Goode’stestimonies. Both claim to have been identified as gifted children and secretlytrained in groups of approximately 300 children in a covert program. Cramercalled the child program he was recruited into Operation Moon Shadow. It was runby the USMC s.s. that Cramer claims did not use trauma based mind control,unlike other programs. Goode’s program did use trauma based mind control whichleft a lasting legacy until its effects were finally removed with the assistancea SSP associated with an ancient ‘Mayan’ civilization.Both Goode and Cramer claim that the children regularly had mind controltechniques used on them to forget their time away from home, without theirfundamentalist Christian parents necessarily noticing anything awry. Time traveltechnology was used to ensure that each time they were taken for training, theywere returned back to the time they were taken to prevent any disruptions intheir normal lives and routines.Both claim that a part of their childhood training involved training with liveweapons, special operations tactics, etc., far beyond the capabilities of normalchildren. Cramer explained that he regularly trained with adults in SpecialForces, who quickly learned their error in underestimating the physicalabilities of the Operation Moon Shadow children.Goode and Cramer claimed that upon ‘graduation’ from their respective coverttraining programs, they were taken to Lunar Operations Command (LOC) on the farside of the Moon. Cramer says that this was where he signed his servicecontract, before being taken to Mars. Goode says that he first completed a“short term program assignment” before being taken to LOC for physicalenhancement and deployment in the secret space program.Both claim that their childhood training programs lasted similar periods oftime. Cramer says he was recruited at age 5, and trained for 12 years before hisfirst deployment at age 17 in 1987. Goode says his training began when he wasage 6; and when he turned 16 in 1986, he began his short assignment. He was thentaken to LOC in 1987, after he turned 17. I find it significant that both Cramerand Goode were taken to LOC in 1987 to begin their respective services withSecret Space Programs (SSP).Both say that they signed contracts for 20 year tour of duties. At thecompletion of the tours, Goode and Cramer were told they would be age andtime-regressed back to the time of their departures at ages 16 and 17respectively to continue their civilian lives with no interruption. Cramer saysthat he lost all of his memories, due to the blank-slate and mind-controltechnologies that were being used on him before being returned to civilian life.Over a 20 year period from 1987-2007 Cramer underwent hypnotherapy, deepmeditation, etc., to regain his memories of both training and serving with theSSP. He says he recovered most of his memories in 2007, and continued to recallhis memories up to the time of his full recall in early 2014.Similarly, Goode says that blank-slate technologies were also used on him, butunlike Cramer, the technologies did not remove any of his memories of hischildhood training. Goode added that he also retained about 70% of his memoriesof his service with the SSPs, when he returned to civilian life, and the restgradually emerged later. Therefore, there is an important different betweenCramer’s and Goode’s memories of their respective services with SSPs. For Cramerthese are recovered memories, and for Goode these are intact memories that werenever lost.When I spoke with Cramer by phone on April 10, 2015, I told him about Goodebeing another Secret Space Program whistleblower. He was not surprised to learnthat Goode had retained all his memories, given his work/abilities as anIntuitive Empath. According to Cramer, individuals with exceptional psionicabilities can better withstand the blank-slate technologies and chemicals thatare used to wipe out memories.Goode says that he was promised university scholarships and lucrative jobs bythe SSP recruiting him for his 20 year tour of duty which were never kept.Similarly, Cramer, as noted earlier in the comparison with Michael Relfe, wasnot given any benefits from his 20 years tour of duty. It’s highly likely thatsuch promises are made in order to motivate covert personnel to enlist, and notkept later leaving them without the necessary resources, careers or reputationsthat could challenge the secrecy system of the different space programs. It’slikely that other former Secret Space Program personnel have similar grievances,which suggests more are likely to come forward for redress.Goode emphasized that during his 20 year tour of duty, there were strictregulations preventing any kind of contact with families, people from Earth, orviewing any transmissions about Earth related news, etc. Basically, there was atotal communications blackout regarding any information related to planet Earth.This is identical to what Cramer states happened to him during his tour of dutywith both the Mars Defense Force and Earth Defense Force. He says that thisstrict blackout of communications with Earth applied even to senior officials inthe secret space programs.The similarities between the testimonies of Michael Relf, Randy Cramer and CoreyGoode can now be put in summary form. Table 3. A General Comparison of Three SSP Whistleblowers [images/00027.jpg][images/00029.jpg][images/00017.jpg][images/00052.jpg]SSP – Secret Space Program "},{"pageContent":"Differences In Testimonies: Relfe, Cramer & Goode Relfe’s, Cramer’s and Goode’s testimonies also diverge in key respects. Cramerand Goode claim they were covertly trained during childhood in groups of 300.Relfe does not recall any childhood training, but was periodically abducted byalien Grays who conducted various genetic experiments on him. Cramer claims thathe was able to deprogram himself and regain all his memories over a 20 yearperiod through a variety of self-help techniques including meditation. Most ofGoode’s memories were never lost, and others returned gradually over time. Incontrast, Refle claims that he was able to regain his memories as a result ofthe deprogramming conducted by Stephanie Relfe and his deep commitment anddevotion to Jesus Christ.There is another key difference concerning Relfe’s and Cramer’s “normal lives”after their respective 20 year covert tours of duty. Cramer says that he wasdiscouraged from joining any military service after the completion of his 20year tour of covert service. The reason was to prevent military service fromstimulating any recall of memories from his prior Mars and secret space fleetcovert service. Nevertheless, Cramer says that he joined the U.S. Navy in June1988, but an external intervention involving mind control was used on him topersuade him to quickly leave the Navy on January 1, 1989, shortly aftercompleting boot camp.[490] [index_split_076.html#filepos897934] He subsequentlyled a non-military life without, strangely, any formal military record of hisenlistment or discharge. In contrast, Relfe says that upon his return from his20 year tour of duty, he resumed his six year Navy service which he signed upfor in 1976. He subsequently spent six years in the U.S. Navy, and received anhonorable discharge.[491] [index_split_076.html#filepos898511] There was noeffort made to persuade him to leave the Navy in contrast to what happened toCramer.Both Relfe and Cramer were trained to be supersoldiers. In contrast, Goode wastrained to be an intuitive empath and has emphasized that he was never asupersoldier. Also, Cramer and Goode claim they were taken to Lunar OperationsCommand in 1987 to sign papers, after which they were sent to their respectiveSSPs. In contrast, Relfe was taken directly to Mars from Earth through jumpgatetechnology in 1976. "},{"pageContent":"Evaluating Similarities: Michael Relfe & Randy Cramer In evaluating Relfe’s and Cramer’s testimonies about covert Mars service, themost important question to consider is what accounts for the remarkablesimilarities? Are these due to both men undergoing similar experiences in covertspace programs that placed them on Mars for 17 years or more? Alternatively, arethe similarities due to cross contamination, or are they part of an elaboratepsychological warfare operation? Each of these possibilities needs to beexamined.Regarding the first possibility, in personal interviews and online chat forums,Michael Relfe and Randy Cramer behave in ways that signify genuine sincerity anddedication to getting their information out to the general public. Mostsignificant is the consistency in their claims over the years. By 2015, Relfehad been claiming for over 15 years to have been part of secret space programs,and has not changed his story. He currently is petitioning the U.S. governmentthrough letters and other forms of online activism to get the truth releasedabout his claims.Similarly, Cramer has maintained consistency in the core elements of his story.This is demonstrated in an email interview he did in 2006 with Eve Lorgen, wherehe used the pseudonym “Zed”.[492] [index_split_076.html#filepos898766] Theinterview discussed his experiences of abductions and being trained as asupersoldier since the age of four, and his subsequent efforts as an adult toretrieve his childhood memories. Noteworthy in this interview is that he focusedon periods in his “normal civilian time-line,” experiences other than the 20year tour of duty he claims to have served with the secret space program [seeCramer’s timeline graphic]. What is highly significant here is that he describedhis memory of being taken by a spacecraft to the Moon: > Repressed memories include a ride in a large saucer shaped ship. Probably 30m> wide. The inside of the ceiling of the craft had this weird quality. Since> there were no windows, when the ship was in motion the entire ceiling of the> inside of the vehicle would act as a view screen showing you outside as if the> roof were simply not there and you were looking straight out into space. It> makes for breathtaking views. But also practical 360′ vision for the pilot and> passengers. Then landing on the dark side of the moon and being led to a> complex of buildings where our training was to take place. Any number of other> purposes may have been the goal here as well. I can’t speculate.[493]> [index_split_076.html#filepos899476] While Cramer does not mention Mars, he does allude to a secret moon base that inhis 2014 testimony he called “Lunar Operations Command.” His memory in 2006 issketchy in terms of what he recalled eight years later, yet it is consistentwith his claims that the first memories he was able to recover were hissupersoldier training from age 5 to 17. This shows there is a high degree ofconsistency in his claims from 2006, when he was still in the process ofretrieving his memories until his “total recall” took place around 2014.The consistency in the claims of Relfe and Cramer over the respective 15 and 9year periods since their public emergence (2000 for Relfe) and (2006 for Cramer)up to 2015, suggests that they are recalling memories that they genuinelypossess of covert service in secret space programs and the Mars Defense Force.In this case, the similarities between Cramer’s and Relfe’s testimonies signifyimportant aspects of the way secret space programs have operated on Mars and inspace.The next possibility to explore is that of cross contamination, or copycatstories. Relfe’s testimony became available in early 2000, whereas Cramer’s Marstestimony emerged in April 2014. Cramer has acknowledged in an interview that atsome point in his memory retrieval process, he came across Relfe’smaterial.[494] [index_split_076.html#filepos900238] However, in Cramer’s 2006interview as “Zed,” Cramer does not mention any service on Mars, which occurredduring his covert service (1987-2007). However, other elements of his story interms of being a MILAB victim and being taken to the Moon for covert training asa child supersoldier suggest that he was being trained to be part of a secretspace program. As Cramer worked to regain memories of the rest of his secretspace program service, he eventually discovered this involved 17 years on Mars.Cramer’s recollections of his covert Mars service is far more detailed andcomprehensive than Relfe’s. This gives a degree of confidence that Cramer’srecollections of Mars service are independent of Relfe’s and little, if any,cross contamination occurred. Furthermore, Cramer’s 2006 recollections of secretspace program service gives additional confidence that his covert space programtraining memories were genuinely preparing him for an assignment similar toRelfe’s in terms of an extended period on Mars.The third and most complex possibility is that Cramer, and possibly even Relfe,are part of an elaborate psychological warfare program. Relfe’s and Cramer’stestimonies come from retrieved memories after substantial work using a varietyof hypnotherapy, kinesiology, or self-help techniques. There is always thepossibility that some of their memories are screen memories implanted by theirformer covert controllers designed to confuse, misinform or redirect thoseseeking to find the truth about their secret space program claims. Both Cramerand Relfe may be part of an elaborate psychological warfare experiment, wheretheir testimonies are a product of mind-control technologies used by covertmilitary, corporate, and/or extraterrestrial intelligences that can transfer orconcoct memories in individuals.In this case, Cramer and Relfe may be mind control victims similar to what hasbeen depicted in the two movie versions of The Manchurian Candidate. The goal ofsuch a psychological warfare experiment might range from testing the generalpublic in terms of how far it will go in accepting fabrications about secretspace programs and extraterrestrial life, or to prepare the public for thepsychological impact of the impending future disclosures on these topics.In Michael Relfe’s case, however, his wife Stephanie was a well-trainedtherapist who applied a rigorous kinesiology process that effectively identifiedand removed many layers of deception concerning his covert Mars servicememories.[495] [index_split_076.html#filepos900380] The Relfes found that therewas indeed an ongoing effort to sabotage and/or interfere with Michael’smemories, through MKUltra type mind control. The Mars Record details therigorous process used by the Relfes to systematically work through these to getto the truth of what he experienced. Therefore, we can have a high degree ofconfidence that Michael Relfe’s testimony is an accurate summary of what heexperienced on Mars. Unlike Michael Relfe, Cramer largely worked on his own in regaining his memoriesand there is no record of a rigorous and systematic effort to remove MKUltratype mind control influences. There is a possibility that Cramer did not succeedin removing all mind control influences that would interfere in the memoryretrieval process and independent actions. If so, then Cramer may have screen orfalse memories directly implanted into him which he believes come from genuineexperiences. This possibility has been raised by Mars anomaly researcher, AlfredWebre, J.D., who cites an anonymous source who claims Cramer had the memories ofsomeone who had served with the secret space programs downloaded into him:> > Specific memories of a deceased member of the Mars Defense Force have been> downloaded and implanted into Randy, although Randy is not yet conscious that> this is the case…. This was done as a well-intentioned disclosure effort by> officials within the Mars Defense Force to let the public know about the> Exopolitical situation on Mars and Earth. [496]> [index_split_076.html#filepos900761]> In an interview, Cramer responded to Webre’s hypothesis and said it is notpossible to transfer screen memories with the kind of emotional charge herecalls concerning his experiences.[497] [index_split_076.html#filepos901240]The possibility that Cramer’s testimony is being externally influenced isstrengthened by Cramer’s acknowledgement that a brain implant allows twosuperior officers, who he has identified as Colonel Jamieson and BrigadierGeneral Julian Smythe, to communicate with him via electronic telepathy.[498][index_split_076.html#filepos901379] > The implants are varied, since there are several different types that I know> are in my body somewhere. Some are simple geo-locaters, or an audio/video> link. Others are those that allow virtual teaching and training when you're> asleep. In my case, it's a host of nanites with the ability to restore> cellular damage and fight unique infections; I've used these to heal nerve> damage twice, on my own, so I can operate them as I see fit. Implants,> regardless of what type, allow some kind of two way communication so the> handlers can receive data and send instructions to the subject. It's a very> complicated and varied field of covert science.[499]> [index_split_076.html#filepos901853] Cramer’s claim here is supported by a U.S. patent describing implanttechnologies enabling the remote monitoring, influencing and communications withindividuals through satellites.[500] [index_split_076.html#filepos902205] Cramermay, therefore, be electronically monitored to trace the public impact of histestimony and is remotely influenced through one or more implants.The similarities in key elements of Relfe’s and Cramer’s testimonies arestriking, and reveal significant aspects about covert service on Mars undertakenby individuals secretly recruited for 20 year tours of duty. It is unlikely thatany significant cross contamination occurred as a result of Cramer coming acrossRelfe’s testimony during the former’s memory retrieval process. The thirdpossibility of a psychological warfare operation can be ruled out for Relfe’stestimony, but not so for Cramer.It can be concluded with a high degree of confidence that Relfe’s testimony isan accurate reflection of events he experienced while serving for 20 years onthe Mars Defense Force, and provides an important baseline for accessing theaccuracy of others claiming similar service. As for the full scope of Cramer’smemories about what he saw and experienced on Mars, there is a possibility thatsome of these have been electronically influenced through brain implanttechnology. Alternatively, Webre’s claim that Cramer’s memories are downloadedfrom a dead Mars Defense Force serviceman also needs to be considered, eventhough Cramer dismisses this possibility. Either scenario raises the question ofwhether Cramer’s memories are intended to mislead the public, or part of awell-intentioned disclosure initiative by a covert branch of the U.S. MarineCorps, as he claims?The similarities between Cramer’s and Relfe’s testimonies suggest the latterexplanation is more likely. This leads to the conclusion that Cramer and Relfehave been respectively encouraged and allowed to come forward, due to factionsin the secret space programs who want to prepare the public for the truth aboutwhat is really happening on Mars, and secret space programs more generally. "},{"pageContent":"Evaluating Similarities: Randy Cramer & Corey Goode The points of similarities in the testimonies between Randy Cramer and CoreyGoode are also very striking. Of the two, Cramer was the first to go public withhis ‘full testimony’ in April 2014, in a five part series of interviews releasedthrough ExoNewsTV.[501] [index_split_076.html#filepos902608] Goode initiallywent public with his testimony in September 2014; when he was interviewed byChristine on behalf of the founder of the popular Project Avalon Forum, BillRyan. Part one of the interview was published in October 2014 on YouTube.[502][index_split_076.html#filepos903002]In July 2014, Goode made a post on The Project Avalon Forum about the Capt. Kaye(Cramer) information. He said: “Cpt. Kaye has some good info in theseinterviews, they are a must listen to for people interested in the variousSecret Space Programs.”[503] [index_split_076.html#filepos903355] Goode wasclearly aware of Cramer’s testimony before he went public two months later.Goode’s comment that Cramer’s info was a “must listen” suggests that he wasconfirming the legitimacy of aspects of Cramer’s testimony rather than using itas a base for concocting a similar story.This is verified in a thread started earlier by Goode on March 3, 2014, on TheProject Avalon Forum titled: “U.S. Has 8 Cigar Shaped UFOs In Space Fleet UsedFor ‘Solar Warden’ Program To Protect Solar System.”[504][index_split_076.html#filepos903708] In Goode’s second post on the thread, hewrites: > The space fleet is real and there are hundreds of thousands of people involved> in various levels (Compartmentalized of course, but they aren’t stupid) that> know what they are a part of.” [505] [index_split_076.html#filepos904072] In subsequent posts on the thread, Goode gradually reveals more and more of hispersonal knowledge about SSPs, and then finally went public as a result of hisfirst audio interview being released in October, 2014.Analysis of Goode’s posts on Project Avalon make it clear that he was speakingfrom deep familiarity with the SSPs, rather than concocting the information fromCapt. Kaye’s/Cramer’s testimony that was released in April 2014, AFTER Goode’sinitial posts about the SSPs in March. Cramer did not know of Goode at all untilI informed him on April 10, 2015.The similarities between the Goode and Cramer testimonies suggest that they wentthrough similar training and work conditions in their respective deployments indifferent secret space programs. Given the independence of each set oftestimonies, and no evidence of any cross-contamination, it’s fair to concludethat the similarities support the veracity of each other’s testimony. "},{"pageContent":"Conclusion We have three independent whistleblowers coming forward to reveal a similarpattern: how personnel are identified during childhood for very specificexceptional abilities, and subsequently genetically altered or trained. They arethen recruited into a secret space program; and finally returned to civilianlife using age regression and time travel technologies after an attempt toremove all their memories.What is also very significant is that Relfe, Cramer and Goode, to varyingextents, have identified tacit or overt official encouragement for them to comeforward. In Relfe’s case, he received tacit encouragement to continue with thepublication of the 2000 book published by his wife, Stephanie, despite stillbeing abducted at the time by the covert program responsible for monitoringreturned personnel. This tacit encouragement occurred after the 1997Vice-Admiral Wilson incident described in chapter eight, and after what Goodedescribed as a falling out between the Solar Warden program and the other secretspace programs sometime in the 1990’s. This is also the period that Dr. StevenGreer’s Disclosure Project received significant behind the scenes support; from“White Hats” in the Pentagon and secret space program, with documents beingleaked, and whistleblowers being allowed to come forward.[506][index_split_076.html#filepos904436]Legitimate questions can be raised about the accuracy of Cramer’s memories dueto him being electronically influenced to some extent via implants. This is lessa cause of concern for Relfe, who has been through a rigorous filtering processthrough the kinesiology protocols applied by his wife Stephanie in removing mindcontrol influences. Goode’s memories of his secret space program service presentthe least cause for concern, if Goode’s empathic abilities did indeed preventhis memories from being removed at the conclusion of his covert service.Furthermore, Goode’s memories of more recent experiences concerning the secretspace programs, based on meetings he participated in during 2015, show noevidence of mind control.The similarities in the testimonies of Relfe, Cramer and Goode show no evidenceof cross contamination. This leads to the conclusion that they are sincerelyrevealing what they recall from serving with different secret space programsover their respective twenty year tours of duty. In addition to Relfe’s andCramer’s incredible recollections of what they experienced on Mars, Goode alsoclaims to have spent time on Mars during his covert 20 year tour of duty and tohave more recently returned from an inspection tour in June 2015. Goode’s claimsabout what is currently happening on Mars and in other secret space programsreveals disturbing details about forced labor in the solar system, andinterstellar human trafficking. "},{"pageContent":"Chapter14 Secret Mars Bases: Corporate Control, Slave Labor & Interstellar HumanTrafficking During World War II, the Nazi SS ruthlessly pursued its dream of creating aparallel industrial empire that would build flying saucer vehicles capable ofspace travel and create super weapons of war using millions of slaves. As thewar approached its fateful climax, the Nazi SS devoted its rapidly dwindlingresources to relocating all it could salvage of its industrial infrastructure tosecret bases in South America and Antarctica, with the hope of one day achievingits dream.Chapter four examined how the Nazis SS cooperated with the Vril Society, whichhad its parallel secret space program moved to three remote Antarctic bases bothprior to and then during the war. The Nazi SS, along with its Black Sun elite,worked with the Vril Society and used their new bases to continue buildingadvanced weapons and spacecraft. The surviving Vril/Nazi forces progressed veryquickly, and were able to defeat Admiral Byrd’s Operation Highjump; a 1947punitive Naval expedition designed to locate and destroy the secret Nazi SSAntarctic bases. Next, the Nazis pressured the Truman and Eisenhoweradministrations into signing secret agreements. Nazi assets then infiltrated andtook over much of the U.S. military industrial complex, and the emergingcorporate run space program—the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate (ICC). Akey ideological principle from the Nazi SS; the use of slave labor, wascontinued by a Nazi infiltrated U.S. Military Industrial Complex in both deepunderground military bases, and corporate run elements of secret space programs.After his release from Spandau Prison in 1966, Albert Speer, Nazi Germany’sArmaments Minister, wrote a book about the parallel industrial infrastructuredeveloped by Himmler’s SS to build super weapons that would win the war. InInfiltration: How Heinrich Himmler Schemed to Build an SS Industrial Empire,Speer describes how he had been ordered to support Himmler’s SS in building itsparallel industrial empire that used millions of slaves for building superweapons in huge underground construction facilities: > Some 14.6 million slaves working to carry out Hitler’s and Himmler’s> construction plans: a human lifetime later, this seems like a sheer pipe> dream.

What Goode tells us is thatwhile the Nazi SS did not conquer the U.S. through military means during WorldWar II, it did so through a silent coup in the 1950’s, during which itinfiltrated and took over major elements of the U.S. military industrialcomplex. Consequently, in a number of deep underground bases on Earth andbeyond, an “empire of slaves” is being used to build new generations of advancedweapons and spacecraft for a corporate secret space program. These programs havebeen heavily influenced by remnants of the Nazi SS, which successfullyinfiltrated secret space programs such as the Interplanetary CorporateConglomerate that has an extensive number of bases on Mars. "},{"pageContent":"Slave Labor on Mars On June 22, 2015, Corey Goode released a report about an inspection tour heclaims was held two days earlier on Mars in which he participated, along withothers from a Secret Space Program Alliance.[510][index_split_076.html#filepos905955] He describes how he was first picked upfrom his home by a blue/indigo sphere that belongs to a group of advancedextraterrestrial visitors called, the “Sphere Being Alliance”, who had appointedhim as their selected delegate for all meetings involving Earth’s secret spaceprograms. The sphere took Goode to a secret base on the moon, Lunar OperationsCommand, where he met with a Lt. Colonel Gonzales (pseudonym), the delegaterepresenting a Secret Space Program Alliance wanting to fully disclose to theworld the truth about extraterrestrial life and advanced technologies.Goode describes how he and Gonzales were each assigned a security team of twoIntuitive Empath (IE) assistants—a position Goode previously held for 20 yearswhen he served in Solar Warden and other programs from 1987 to 2007. Goode andGonzales were accompanied on the trip to Mars by a representative of the“Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate.”Goode says that the trip took 30 minutes, longer than the few minutes itnormally takes to travel to Mars, when it is not on the opposite side of thesun. The total distance, at that time, was approximately 250 million miles (~420million km), which means that Goode’s transport shuttle averaged a staggering ¾of the speed of light. Conventional rocket propelled craft would take up to 260days to make the same journey.Goode describes the terms that had been agreed upon between the representativesof the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate (ICC) and the Secret Space ProgramAlliance Council as to what would happen once they reached Mars: > Gonzales again told the ICC Representative that we appreciated them agreeing> to the terms of allowing us to bring the armed security, choosing the site of> the conference once in orbit, the tours and allowing us to bring one family of> our choosing back with us to question and to either provide sanctuary to or> allow to return to their home colony depending on the family’s wishes. I sat> and listened since I had not been a part of the negotiations and hoped to> overhear something new from the process.[511]> [index_split_076.html#filepos906514] Upon arrival at Mars, the ICC representative gave Gonzales a list of ICCfacilities on Mars in the northern hemisphere that would be suitable for thebase inspection. Gonzales instead requested a location in the southernhemisphere that was not on the list, which greatly concerned the ICCrepresentative who at first denied its existence. Gonzales insisted that thebase did exist according to fresh intelligence. The ICC then contacted hissuperiors and said it would take an hour to prepare the base in question for theinspection.Goode described the instructions they were given, after arriving at the southernhemisphere base, of what they would be able to discuss with the baseinhabitants: > The ICC representative then told us what the subject of that conversation was> going to be. He was carefully watching our reactions as he gave us a summary> of what to expect from the base commander. He stated that the people at this> facility were here for generations and that they were under the impression for> decades now that the earth had been through some sort of cataclysm and was no> longer inhabitable. He said that we are being asked to not throw off the> social dynamics of the facility by revealing that this was not the case or> that any of us were from the surface of Earth.[512]> [index_split_076.html#filepos907073] Goode and Gonzales then met the base commander who told them about the primarymission of the facility, which was described as a multi-decades socialexperiment: > As we entered, the base commander gave us the storyline about the people not> knowing that the earth was still thriving and that this wasn’t anything to do> with any slavery theories being promoted by the SSP Alliance, but was a> complex “social experiment”.

The> base commander then stated that the “main hall” was being setup for the> conference and that we would be taken on a tour of the industrial plant first> that was 8 kilometers away via an underground train. He said after the> conference we would then tour the colony and meet the people, see their living> conditions, and ask a family if they would be willing to leave with us.[513]> [index_split_076.html#filepos907632] Goode then described how he inadvertently revealed that he was from Texas to onemember of the base security team, who presumably had been told that the Earth’ssurface had been previously devastated in some cataclysm. This led to a growingcommotion among the base’s security team, resulting in their sudden replacement: > It was at about this time that another monorail train arrived with many more> security personnel. They told us to halt and they separated the security team> that was with us, disarmed them and escorted them to the trains and left. A> new security team was assigned to us and the ICC representative that obviously> had an “ear wig” (communication device in his ear) told us that we were not to> communicate with the security team unless it was to do with something security> related.[514] [index_split_076.html#filepos908191] Goode describes how he, Gonzales and their security team were taken to a largeconference hall next, and saw many of the colonists and their leaders who made apresentation about the advanced technologies produced at the facility. Thecolony leaders proudly claimed that exopolitical agreements had been reachedwith up to 900 different extraterrestrial civilizations: > We were brought into the “main hall” that looked like an area that people are> brought in for daily propaganda, and there were a large number of ICC> leadership members present who were bustling about as well and it was> difficult to count how many were there.

It began with the family that waschosen to accompany Goode and his companions back to the Lunar OperationsCommand for a debriefing away from the facility: > It was now time for Gonzales to give the ICC representative the choice of the> family we were to take back with us. He gave the number of a certain family’s> dwelling that was an alpha numeric number outside their door, and 15 minutes> later a man, woman, teenage son and pre-teen daughter showed up with a small> bag in each of their hands.

He said that, “We know that there is another member of your> family that is not present.” The father said, “How could you know that?”> Gonzales motioned to our security personnel and said that “our people have> abilities.” The family then clammed up and would not talk. Gonzales became> upset and said he would straighten this out and he and the two security> personnel assigned to him left the vessel.[516]> [index_split_076.html#filepos909309] Goode says that the base commander became irate when challenged by Gonzales andwas thrown into a detention cell, and was soon joined by Goode and his two mansecurity team. Along the way, Goode described what he saw: “As we walked backthrough the rows of cells, we saw quite a lot of people in various psychologicalstages of psychological distress locked up.”[517][index_split_076.html#filepos909868]Fearing the worst from the base commander that Gonzalez described as a “tyrantand a total megalomaniac,” Goode revealed how the blue/indigo spheres belongingto the Sphere Alliance rescued them: > It wasn’t a minute later that we saw our blue/indigo orb friends zipping> through the walls of the cell, one for each of us. They danced around for a> couple seconds and the other SSP personnel who had never traveled this way> backed against the wall. Gonzales explained how the transportation works and> then we each followed the SOP and were soon back at the LOC room where I was> transported at the beginning of this journey. Now safe at the Lunar Operations Command, Gonzales told Goode that the missionhad provided good intelligence about ICC operations on Mars: > He stated that the ICC’s goal was propaganda, and that since the recent> reports that were released to the public about the slave trade and labor going> on by the ICC, that they have been extremely upset and worked-up about> information being public that was never supposed to be so.[518]> [index_split_076.html#filepos910427] The inspection of the Mars ICC facility described in Goode’s report helpsconfirm that slave labor conditions do indeed exist, at least at some of thesefacilities where civilians are psychologically manipulated and physically abusedby tyrannical base leaders who tolerate no dissent. Advanced technologies,produced at these covert Mars facilities, appear to be a valuable commodity intrade agreements with an extraordinarily high number of extraterrestrialcivilizations—up to 900, if the ICC representative is correct.The existence of secret bases on Mars and elsewhere in the solar system,controlled by a corporate conglomerate trading advanced technologies produced byhuman workers in slave labor conditions for interstellar trade, is certainly acause for great concern. There appears to be minimal accountability or oversightof such facilities and the base commanders running them. "},{"pageContent":"British Interplanetary Society Explores Overthrowing Dictators on Mars Goode provided no hard evidence or documents to support his report about theJune 20, 2015 Mars Inspection tour, and Lt. Col. Gonzales has yet to publiclyemerge to confirm his participation or identity. Yet there is significantcircumstantial evidence to support Goode’s claims.On June 11, 2015, the British Interplanetary Society began a two-day meeting ona most unusual topic according to a BBC news article, “How to Overthrow aMartian Dictatorship.”[519] [index_split_076.html#filepos910986] The meetingenvisaged a Mars colony ruled over by a ruthless dictator who trampled on therights of workers in a futurist society controlled by a corporation. Thedictator needed to be overthrown without destroying the colony itself. Accordingto the author of the BBC article, Richard Hollingham, the meeting broughttogether 30 prominent scientists, engineers and philosophers who took their“task seriously,” only, wink wink, “two short blocks from the Londonheadquarters of Britain’s security service, MI6.”[520][index_split_076.html#filepos911414]In the same time frame as the June 11/12 meeting was being held, real lifeevents were allegedly occurring on a secret Mars colony that remarkablyparalleled the circumstances that the British Interplanetary Society wasdiscussing. Was it just coincidence, or are British scientists and policymakers, with more than just close physical proximity to Britain’s MI6, secretlypreparing for future efforts to remove ruthless dictators controlling secretcorporate colonies on Mars from power?Hollingham gave a brief background to the British Interplanetary Society meetingthat was officially titled, “Extraterrestrial Liberty III – Dissent, Revolutionand Liberty in Space”: > This is the third annual conference on extraterrestrial liberty. Last year the> event tackled the challenge of writing a constitution for an alien settlement,> concluding that successful space colonies should base laws and liberties on> the US Constitution and Bill of Rights.[521]> [index_split_076.html#filepos911842] According to the meeting’s organizer, Charles Cockell, a professor ofastrobiology at the University of Edinburgh: “This year we’re discussing whathappens if you don’t like the government you’ve created and want to overthrowit.”[522] [index_split_076.html#filepos912344]The scenario described by Cockell was the following: > The scenarios the group is contemplating are easiest to imagine if you think> about what a space colony might be like. Perhaps a domed settlement with a few> hundred residents, beneath a thin dusty Martian sky. A fragile and isolated> outpost of humanity 225 million kilometres from the home world. With a brutal> dictator and his cronies in charge of the oxygen generators, for instance.> [523] [index_split_076.html#filepos912772] The most likely dictator would be one emerging from a corporation controlling aMars colony that exploits workers as a form of slave labor, according toCockell: > As we know private corporations can be just as ruthless and despotic as the> worst governments. If you strike, then maybe the corporation says ‘that’s> fine—let me show you to the airlock and you can leave’ and off you go into the> vacuum of space.[524] [index_split_076.html#filepos913200] More than coincidentally, on the same day that the BBC published Hollingham’sJune 22, 2015 story about the British Interplanetary Society meeting, Goode’sreport of his role with the June 20, 2015 inspection team sent to investigateaccusations of slave labor at an Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate (ICC)Mars mining facility was released.[525] [index_split_076.html#filepos913628]Here is another quote from Goode’s June 22 report describing how the Mars basecommander responded to challenges to his authority even when higher rankedofficials were involved: > The facility security team walked us in, straight past the base commander who> was in a very heated conversation with the ICC representative. Something had> gone very wrong and his ego was bruised or his authority was challenged in> front of his men. He was extremely upset and was no longer listening to the> ICC representative who outranked him.[526]> [index_split_076.html#filepos914187]> The events described in Goode’s report are amazingly similar to the scenariodiscussed at the June 11/12 British Interplanetary Society event summarized inHollingham’s June 22 article. Here we have a corporate base commander who was a“tyrant and a total megalomaniac,” who would not allow anyone to challenge hisauthority, including more senior corporate officials.[527][index_split_076.html#filepos914746]The similarities in the scenarios discussed at the June 11/12, 2015 BritishInterplanetary Society meeting, and the subsequent June 22 reports by Goode andHollingham, lead to an astounding conclusion. British scientists, engineers,philosophers and policy makers, with the tacit support of MI6 officials, aresecretly preparing the British elite for future disclosures about secretcolonies on Mars and elsewhere, which have been run as corporate dictatorshipsby megalomaniac tyrants that have been abusing workers for years. How to removethese Mars Colony dictators without them killing off their personnel and/ordestroying their valuable facilities is a problem that all of humanity willeventually have to confront. How to deal with corporate officials directlyinvolved in such crimes leads to yet more circumstantial evidence supportingGoode’s claim of the June 20, 2015 inspection tour of an ICC Mars colony usingslave labor. "},{"pageContent":"US Congress to Protect Slave Labor on Mars & Corporate Space Colonies On June 15, 2015, the U.S. House of Representatives took a major step in passinga bill that provides legal protection to space mining by U.S. based corporationsthat establish off-world operations. While most members of the House’s “Science,Space and Technology Committee” that passed the bill may have done so with theimpression that they would protect the rights of U.S. companies in future spacemining missions, they instead have provided legal protection to corporationsthat have been secretly conducting such operations for decades.[528][index_split_076.html#filepos915305] This is especially significant givenGoode’s claims that off-world space mining by U.S. affiliated corporations haveused slave labor on Mars and elsewhere in our solar system.[529][index_split_076.html#filepos915695]The bill, “H.R.1508: Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act of 2015,”was introduced and referred to the Science, Space and Technology Committee by abipartisan group of eight members on March 19, 2015.[530][index_split_076.html#filepos916254] On June 15, after an 18-15 vote two daysearlier in favor of amending the bill, it was officially sent to the full Housefor a vote. An identical bipartisan bill has been introduced into the Senate bySenators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Patty Murry (D-WA).[531][index_split_076.html#filepos916644]The Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act ostensibly protects therights of mining companies willing to invest significant financial resources infuture space exploration. If, for example, a mining company establishes a baseon Mars, it would then have the right to exploit the resources of Mars and beprotected under U.S. Federal Law. Here is what the proposed Act has to say inSection 51302: > (a) Commercialization of space resource exploration and utilization> (1) IN GENERAL – The President, acting through appropriate Federal agencies,> shall—facilitate the commercial exploration and utilization of space resources> to meet national needs…[532] [index_split_076.html#filepos917135] This clause raises the possibility that under U.S. “national needs” thePresident of the United States can provide resources and assistance to miningcompanies that establish off-world bases and mining. There is nothingparticularly alarming here at the prospect of companies such as SpaceX beinggiven assistance to plan future Mars missions that establish mining bases tofund themselves. Back on November 16, 2012, SpaceX founder, Elon Musk, announcedhis plans to build a colony of 80,000 people: “At Mars, you can start aself-sustaining civilization and grow it into something really big.”[533][index_split_076.html#filepos917518]The next clause of the Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act does raisesome disturbing issues however: > (2) discourage government barriers to the development of economically viable,> safe, and stable industries for the exploration and utilization of space> resources in manners consistent with the existing international obligations of> the United States…[534] [index_split_076.html#filepos918061] What exactly does “discourage government barriers” mean? It appears to be shorthand, stating that any government regulations are unnecessary, and could be asignificant impediment for profitable mining operations. For example, if themining company was to exploit workers in slave-labor like conditions, this wouldbe a problem for the mining company to resolve, rather than federal regulatorsimposing U.S. labor standards.The subsequent clause is even more alarming: > (3) promote the right of United States commercial entities to explore outer> space and utilize space resources, in accordance with the existing> international obligations of the United States, free from harmful> interference…[535] [index_split_076.html#filepos918444] What does “free from harmful interference” mean? In the case of a miningcorporation imposing slave labor working conditions, this clause suggests thatinternational organizations such as the International Criminal Court would nothave the power to directly intervene. Basically, managers at prospective spacemining operations would be protected under U.S. Federal Law from internationalorganizations investigating them for using slave labor.Finally, the Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act specifies the U.S.district courts as having “Exclusive Jurisdiction”: > “Exclusive Jurisdiction: The district courts of the United States shall have> original jurisdiction over an action under this chapter without regard to the> amount in controversy.”[536] [index_split_076.html#filepos918827] Basically, this means that any human rights issues arising in the miningoperations of corporations with off-world bases would have to be addressedthrough U.S. district courts.The Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act raises some very troublinglegal issues about future mining operations by U.S. based mining corporations.However, rather than a hypothetical legal problem to be debated by space lawattorneys, Goode’s June 22, 2015 Inspection Tour report suggests space miningoperations already secretly exist. Based on what Goode and Gonzales directlywitnessed, there is testimonial evidence that slave labor is currently beingused on Mars to mine and manufacture products for the Interplanetary CorporateConglomerate.If Goode’s report is accurate, then the effect of the U.S. Space ResourceExploration and Utilization Act would be to give U.S. Federal legal protectionto the owners, managers and personnel of these corporations currently usingslave labor, against possible investigations by international human rightsorganizations, including the International Criminal Court.At the time of writing, the Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act hasmoved to the full House of Representatives for debate and a vote, while theSenate will follow soon after with its own version of the bill. It appears morethan coincidental that at the same time as slave labor accusations are beingsecretly investigated within off-world mining operations, the U.S. Congress isin the midst of passing legislation that would effectively provide legalprotection to corporate officials responsible for such crimes. While it isdeeply disturbing to face such a reality where slave labor is used within secretmining and manufacturing bases in some of the secret space programs, Corey Goodehad something even more shocking to reveal. "},{"pageContent":"Galactic Human Slave Trade In the 18th and 19th centuries, the major colonial powers supported flourishingslave trades in their respective colonies through corrupt local elites oroutright conquest of foreign territories. As the abolitionist movement spreadand raised consciousness in former colonial powers such as Spain and Britain,these countries led the way in ending the global slave trade. According toGoode, a galactic human slave trade exists where millions of captured humans aretaken off planet to distant colonies on other worlds to be bartered or abused.Goode claims that the galactic human slave trade is now opposed by an allianceof Secret Space Programs (SSP Alliance) that plan to disclose the full truthabout the abusive practices that have plagued humanity for centuries, if notmillennia, due to corrupt local elites (Cabal/Illuminati) and intervention byimperialist space powers (Draco Federation Alliance/Empire).In responses to a series of questions, Goode explains just how extensive theGalactic human slave trade has been, the principal parties involved, and theegregious mistreatment of those unfortunate enough to have been taken captive. > This is some pretty horrific and controversial information.

He says that the solarsystem wide quarantine, put in place by the Sphere Being Alliance, has cut backon the number of captive humans previously taken outside the solar system to betraded or sold. Goode describes the very positive role of an Ancient Mayan SpaceProgram that has established colonies in the Pleiades, which has helpedsignificantly in mitigating the galactic slave trade by freeing captive humansand relocating them to sanctuaries in their colonies.After a “Full Disclosure Event,” Goode describes a very positive future forhumanity which is now ready to experience a Star Trek-like civilization. Here,former victims of the galactic human slave trade or those used as slave labor onInterplanetary Corporate Conglomerate facilities can safely return home.Humanity’s evolution is apparently one of the chief goals of the Sphere BeingAlliance, according to Goode, and our evolution entails them assisting in this“Full Disclosure Event.” "},{"pageContent":"Chapter15 Law of One, Sphere Being Alliance, Full Disclosure & Ascension Dr. Don Elkins, a former Engineering and Physics Professor, was part of aninnovative experimental communication project, from 1981 to 1984, involving deeptrance channeler Carla Rueckert. The rigorous scientific protocol implemented byElkins ensured the highest possible quality in the transmissions received byRueckert; these transmissions were first introduced as “The Ra Material” and inlater editions became known as the “Law of One.” The Law of One is widelyregarded to be among the most authoritative and accurate telepathiccommunications about extraterrestrial life, human history and the evolution ofconsciousness ever received. The “beings” channeled by Carla Reuckert identifiedthemselves as “Ra”, a social memory complex, which had much information to shareabout humanity’s past, present, and future spanning a three decade period from1981 to 2011.The end of the time window coincides with the appearance of the Blue Avians,which Corey Goode claims first made contact with him and Lt. Col. Gonzales in2011. It was reportedly soon after that roughly one hundred large spheres,belonging to the Sphere Being Alliance, appeared and imposed a frequency fence(quarantine) around the entire solar system, and also the Earth as examined inchapter 11.Goode’s description of his communications with Raw Tear-Eir led to David Wilcock[DW] proposing that Raw Tear-Eir and the Ra group were linked in a significantway. This is how Goode summarized their discussion: > When I began providing the details of my interactions with the Blue Avians to> David Wilcock, he began mentioning the Law of One material and \"RA\" quite> often to help explain some of the concepts that the Blue Avians were imparting> to me.

"},{"pageContent":"Key Concepts in the Law of One The Law of One material introduces a number of distinctions and concepts helpfulfor understanding the evolution of consciousness, extraterrestrialcivilizations, and secret space programs. Just as a magnet has two poles,positive and negative, so too consciousness has two polarities according to theRa group. The positive polarity involves behavior based on “service-to-other”,whereas the negative polarity involves “service-to-self.”The concept “service-to-other” can be generally described as behavior whereinthere is a well-developed empathic connection to others who are, to varyingdegrees, viewed as part of or extensions of one’s self. This leads to individualmoral codes and societal ethical systems in which the needs of others are highlyconsidered in all aspects of communications, relationships and conflict. A goodexample of a service-to-other philosophy is Buddhism which views allconsciousness as a unity manifesting in multiple aspects.The concept of “service-to-self” can be generally described as being committedto one’s own individual self, tribe, community, or nation, whereby the self isidentified as separate from others. The needs of those outside this more limiteddefinition of “self” are not given priority or may even be disregarded entirely.A good example of a “service-to-self” philosophy is Nazism (National Socialism),which advocated the superiority of the Aryan man above all others and racialsegregation. What comes as a surprise to many reading the Law of One material for the firsttime is that the evolution of consciousness can occur through both polarities.The Ra group specifies percentages to which our consciousness must dwell ineither the positive or negative polarity in order to evolve: > In order to choose the positive path, at least 51 percent of our thoughts and> actions must be dedicated to the service of others. For the negative path, at> least 95% must be self-serving. Between the two lies “the sinkhole of> indifference.”[543] [index_split_076.html#filepos921642] All major world religious systems have elements that advocate, to varyingdegrees, a positive polarity path in which service to others is part of theprocess toward individual salvation. This is consistent with the ideals ofsecular humanism, which is a fundamental aspect of Western culture. Therefore,achieving a 51% “service-to-other” mindset wherein the majority of thoughts andactions is set up to help others, primarily those outside our restricteddefinitions of self, (i.e., strangers), does not appear odd even though it maybe challenging.It is the negative polarity path of 95% service-to-self that appears very odd.Could the Ra group really be suggesting that fanatical Nazis who disregard theneeds of others outside of their limited conception of the Aryan community couldreally evolve to a higher state of being? The following synopsis describes theRa group’s answer to such a question, as well as what happens to those who don’tchoose one of the two polarity paths at the end of the specified time period,which coincides with what Ra calls the “Harvest” (aka Ascension) predicted tooccur in our current era: > What happens if we do choose one of the paths successfully? We graduate to a> planet of service to others or a planet of service to self. > How long do we have in which to choose? 75,000 years. > What happens after 75,000 years? After that, earth will be a service to others> planet. Those who have chosen service to others will work together in the> manner that seems best to them. Those who have chosen service to self will go> to planets dedicated to their path. Those who have not yet chosen will go to> other third-density planets.[544] [index_split_076.html#filepos921955] Density levels correspond to different octaves of light/energy containingdistinct cycles, wherein consciousness evolves for all life, including theplanet itself. According to Ra, even suns are an expression of consciousnessevolving, for example, from a third density yellow star, to a forth densitygreen star. All suns in our galaxy are claimed to be directly influenced by thelight energy that is emitted from the galactic core.The Ra group explains that the frequency of photons, which comprise all atomicmatter, change in a way that leads to transitions from one density level toanother. For example, if the galactic core begins transmitting different spiralsof energies, this leads to photons comprising matter to change in frequency. Theresult is evolutionary pressure on all life forms due to the changes in atomicparticles and photons that are the building blocks for all life.Transition between densities becomes possible for collectives at the end ofthree major cycles; each cycle is approximately 25,000 years. This is verysimilar to the idea of “galactic superwaves,” discussed by Dr. Paul LaViolette,that emanate from the galactic core in cycles spanning from 10,000 to 16,000years. In his 2006 book, Decoding the Message of the Pulsars, Dr. LaViolettedescribes pulsars strategically placed in the galaxy that transmit warningsabout these superwaves.[545] [index_split_076.html#filepos922268] LaViolettespeculates that these pulsars were built by a very advanced Type IIIextraterrestrial civilization—one that understood how galactic superwavesoperated, and their potential impact on solar systems and worlds.The Law of One material reveals that as galactic superwaves pass throughdifferent regions of the galaxy, they will cause a density transition from onedensity to another: > Density 1 > Cycle of awareness,> e.g., minerals, crystals. > Frequency, Red. > Density 2 > Cycle of growth,> e.g., plants, microbes, animals. > Frequency, Orange. > Density 3 > Cycle of self-awareness, e.g., humans. > Frequency, Yellow. > Density 4 > Cycle of love or understanding. > Frequency, Green. > Density 5 > Cycle of light or wisdom. > Frequency, Sky Blue. > Density 6 > Cycle of love/light or unity. > Frequency, Indigo. > Density 7 > Gateway cycle. > Frequency, Violet.[546] [index_split_076.html#filepos922528] The Ra group described itself as a 6th density social memory complex, i.e., acollective comprising many individual souls who have developed a significantdegree of unity consciousness or the love/light frequency.Ra claims that social memory complexes typically occur in 4th density societies,since the love vibration predominates. Starting from 4th density,service-to-other social memory complexes transition to higher densities ascollectives, which is what happened with the Ra group in its own evolutionaryhistory. Thus, different extraterrestrial collectives evolve throughservice-to-other activities wherein unity consciousness is developed.This helps us understand the motivations of human-type extraterrestrial races(discussed in chapter 11) conducting 22 different long term genetic experimentswith humanity. These experiments are part of what motivates theseextraterrestrials to more earnestly assist humanity in its evolution, therebyassisting them in their own positive polarity or service-to-other endeavors.This is why the various alliances of service-to-other extraterrestrials—theConfederation of Planets, Andromeda Council, Galactic Federation, or the “SuperFederation” comprising the other extraterrestrial councils (according toGoode)—and groups such as Ra, are helping humanity to make a smooth transitionfrom 3rd to 4th density.The Harvesting/Ascension process is being observed by many more extraterrestrialcivilizations than just those conducting genetic experiments. According to Goodeand Gonzales, at the last of the Super Federation Conferences held in June 2015,there were representatives from 100 human looking extraterrestrialgroups/societies in attendance.[547] [index_split_076.html#filepos922841] Thosewith a service-to-other orientation respect free will and give assistance onthis basis, with the hope of maximizing the number of souls that are ready for apositive service-to-other transition from 3rd density to 4th density, or 4thdensity to 5th density etc.The Law of One material referred to three groups observing theascension/harvesting process. > 1. Higher self, spiritual guides - this includes our ancestors who are linked> karmically to us. > 2. Confederation of Planets - this includes the different extraterrestrial> alliances described earlier: Super Federation of human looking aliens, the> Draconian Federation Alliance (which Ra refers to as the Orion Group/Empire) > 3. Guardian beings – 7th density beings and above. This could include the> Sphere Being Alliance or some of its members that Goode describes as 6th to> 9th density beings. As mentioned earlier, it is possible for negative polarity oriented entities toascend/be harvestable up the evolutionary ladder. The basic reason is thatservice-to-other and service-to-self are distinct paths that merge in 6thdensity as service-to-all or unity consciousness, according to the Ra group.This would explain why the Sphere Being Alliance chose not to have directrelations with either the Super Federation of human looking extraterrestrials,nor with the Draconian Federation Alliance. The Sphere Being Alliance appointedGoode and Gonzales to be their delegates for conferences involving thesedifferent extraterrestrial alliances; since both represent only one polarity,rather than a harmonious integration of the two.The RA group views service-to-self entities such as the Draconian FederationAlliance (Orion Group), as serving a higher purpose by creating a greaterpolarization. This directly results in more beings ascending/being harvested.For souls, the creation of increased polarity leads them towards making acommitment, choosing either to act in a more service-to-self or service-to-othermanner in their thoughts and actions. The greatest danger for those capable ofevolving is not to do so, and not to ascend/be harvestable at the end of a setof major cycles. This leads to the repetition of cycles (each cycle being 25,000years) and slows the soul’s evolutionary process.Most of the humans that will be harvested/ascend to 4th density areservice-to-other oriented, and greatly outnumber those who are service-to-selforiented. The majority of humans, however, will not ascend/be harvestableaccording to the Ra Group’s 1981 prediction. Those not ascending will go to someother 3rd density planet through planetary upheaval (death), and/or interventionby different extraterrestrial groups that take such individuals physically toother worlds. This ensures that Earth will become a 4th density service-to-otherplanet after the ascension/harvest.Both the positive or negative polarity paths involve a similar level ofdifficulty, given that conditions on Earth, in its current 3rd densitymanifestation, favors the service-to-self orientation. Ra says that the OrionGroup (Draconian Federation Alliance) involved in abductions and humantrafficking had the purpose of minimizing the number of individuals that wouldascend/be harvested as service-to-other, and maximizing the number to ascend/beharvested as service-to-self. "},{"pageContent":"Earth Quarantine & Sphere Being Alliance Ra described a quarantine being imposed upon the Earth wherein a balance isreached in terms of the opportunities for individuals to choose either aservice-to-other or service-to-self orientation at the time ofascension/harvest. Otherwise, the Earth could have been easily conquered by theservice-to-self extraterrestrial race, which could limit the opportunities forindividuals to take a service-to-other path. The quarantine was allegedly put inplace by the “Guardians,” 75,000 years ago. It has been administered by a“Council of Saturn,” the decision making body belonging to the Confederation ofPlanets. Ra describes the membership of the Council of Saturn as follows: > The members of the Council are representatives from the Confederation and from> those vibratory levels of your inner planes bearing responsibility for your> third density.… In number, the Council that sits in constant session, though> varying in its members by means of balancing, which takes place, what you> would call irregularly, is nine.

These entities faithfully watch and have been called the> Guardians.[548] [index_split_076.html#filepos923343] According to Ra, quarantine has been porous: > Every effort is made to quarantine this planet. However, the network of> guardians, much like any other pattern of patrols on whatever level, does not> hinder each and every entity from penetrating quarantine, for if request is> made in light/love, the Law of One will be met with acquiescence. If the> request is not made, due to the slipping through the net, then there is> penetration of this net.[549] [index_split_076.html#filepos923675] All this suggests that the Sphere Being Alliance augmented or tightened a priorquarantine around the Earth, which had become too porous, and also imposed asolar system wide quarantine. It is not clear what the precise relationship isbetween the Guardians in the Council of Saturn and the Sphere Being Alliance.The actions taken by the Sphere Being Alliance suggests they have acted inaccord to a higher galactic/dimensional authority, which the Council of Saturnrecognizes.According to Goode, huge moon to Jupiter size spheres first appeared in oursolar system in the 1980’s, but remained in a cloaked dormant position. Thesegiant spheres were activated after the Sphere Being Alliance showed up in 2011.The activated spheres formed frequency shields around the solar system and thesun. Chapter 10 described the major functions of these spheres, one of which wasto regulate the amount of cosmic energy (aka galactic superwaves) coming intoour solar system and to the Earth so humanity could better integrate it, andprepare for major changes.Goode announced on July 23, 2015 that these Jupiter sized spheres are about toleave our Solar System since they have achieved their primary function: > The “Spheres” seem to nearing the end of their purpose as they are also> beginning to buffer less and less of the energy, thus allowing more and more> to enter into the inner Sol System and directly effect the Sun, Planets and> HUMAN BEINGS that are so easily put into trigger mode by these energies. At> some point the Spheres will be gone and we will fully be considered a 4/5th> Density Transition Civilization. There are of course quite a few other EVENTS> that will be occurring before this last EVENT leaves us standing on our own> finally.[550] [index_split_076.html#filepos924009] Among the changes that will be triggered by incoming cosmic energies is therelease of information concerning advanced technologies, secret space programsand extraterrestrial life in what Goode has described as a “full disclosureevent.” Full disclosure is one of the events that will occur before the “lastEVENT” that corresponds with the ascension/harvest described by the Ra group. "},{"pageContent":"Full Disclosure Event Goode describes the goal of the Secret Space Program Alliance as a “fulldisclosure event” involving massive document dumps. Its scale will overwhelm thecorporate run media’s ability to spin and limit disclosure efforts to protectelite individuals from being exposed for crimes against humanity.[551][index_split_076.html#filepos924497] From June 5-9, 2015, Goode attended aseries of three meetings between different factions and alliances concerning howmuch to disclose about the truth of extraterrestrial visitors and secret spaceprograms using advanced technologies.[552] [index_split_076.html#filepos924966]During his June 9 meeting with human elites he describes as the “Committee of200” and others, an offer was made for a “controlled disclosure”: > They stated that they had been forced through generations of mind control and> threats to do all of the things that they had done. They further stated that> they would prefer to work with the Alliances in setting up a new financial> system that was fair to all of humanity, and to begin a controlled disclosure> that would not expose certain crimes and incidents that would incriminate them> in their life time…. Taking all of that into consideration, they proposed that> a plan be agreed on that allowed the release of certain information and> technologies while withholding the majority of information for a 50 year time> period.[553] [index_split_076.html#filepos925434] This “controlled disclosure” offer has led to concerns and questions about thekind of disclosure that is being planned by the “Secret Space Program Alliance”that Goode is working with. In his June 15 response to one of these questions,he explained the goal: > A full disclosure event would consist of a major data dump on the Internet> with many hundreds of thousands of document, audio and video files on multiple> mirrored sites for everyone to have access to. There would be a collapse of> the corporate media machine, and a 24/7 television and radio education> campaign would be initiated. Not all channels and stations would be co-opted> so people are not overwhelmed and could “tune out” as they needed to due to> the stress.[554] [index_split_076.html#filepos925957] He then explains what a “partial” or “controlled disclosure” event, such as theNovember 2015 offer by the Committee of 200, would entail: > If a person or group go public and reveal the existence of ET visitation and> some advanced technologies, but not technologies that would collapse a “New> Financial System” or reveal the crimes against humanity that have been> perpetrated by the “Human Elite” and certain “Off World” or “Ancient Break> Away Groups” then you have not been told the whole truth. > That would be a partial disclosure where the narrative has been controlled by> a group preserving their power and avoiding the release of their crimes. The> majority of the world would be shocked by this information alone and it would> occupy their imaginations for some time. Very few of us at the current moment> would realize that this was just another deception.[555]> [index_split_076.html#filepos926481] Goode gave more details about how a “full disclosure event” would differ to“partial disclosure” in his response to a question about a disclosure race: > Q. Is there currently a disclosure race happening between the Cabal/Illuminati> and the Solar Warden/Sphere Alliance in terms of how much information should> be released and how this frames key issues?> > [C.G.] Yes, When FULL Disclosure occurs it will also come with the disclosure> of massive crimes against humanity that will send the bulk of society into> shock for some time.

On June 4, 2015, it was announced that up to four million USFederal government employees had their personnel files hacked by an unknownsource.[557] [index_split_076.html#filepos927624] A July 9 estimate puts thenumber closer to 21 million.[558] [index_split_076.html#filepos928329] Thehacking incidents involved extensive information about the backgrounds ofindividuals gained in security reviews for classification clearances.The hacking incidents involved the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), whichcontains the security files of individuals that have applied for securityclearances either to work for the U.S. federal government, the U.S. military,and even included personnel from corporations fulfilling government/militarycontracts: > In an announcement, OPM said that investigators concluded this week with “a> high degree of confidence” that the agency’s systems containing information> related to the background investigations of “current, former and prospective”> federal employees, and others for whom a background check was conducted, were> breached.[559] [index_split_076.html#filepos928874] The Washington Post gave a description of the type of information gained in thehacking incident: > The separate background-check database contains sensitive information—called> SF-86 data—that includes applicants’ financial histories and investment> records, children’s and relatives’ names, foreign trips taken and contacts> with foreign nationals, past residences, and names of neighbors and close> friends.[560] [index_split_076.html#filepos929397] Corey Goode [C.G.] responded to a question about the hacking incident in areport he gave about three meetings he attended from June 5-9, 2015, involvingdisclosure of secret space programs: > Q. In your report of the June 5 meeting you say that the “Earth Based> Alliance” has accumulated a lot of personal data of individuals for future war> crime trials through hacking of “Western Government Personnel Databases.” Can> you elaborate on who comprises the Earth Based Alliance, and whether the June> 4 announcement that 4 million federal workers files were hacked in Dec 2014 is> part of this Earth Alliance operation? > [C.G.] This information came from a series of hacks and inside operations. It> was stated that most of the information was fresh intelligence that had just> been obtained. It was that same day after the meetings that I heard about some> massive hacking breaches in the U.S. during the time frame you mentioned. I’m> certain that was a part of the data they had obtained, but I also have the> feeling there was much more that they had gotten a hold of more recently from> both the U.S. and the E.U.[561] [index_split_076.html#filepos929839] In earlier public releases, Goode has described how there have been extensivecrimes committed by those participating in a “galactic slave trade” as describedin chapter 13. Goode says that there have been a number of defectors from theInterplanetary Corporate Conglomerate (ICC), which has been directly linked tothe galactic human slave trade and the use of slave labor at its secret bases onMars and elsewhere in the solar system.[562][index_split_076.html#filepos930306] These defectors have been revealing whatthey know about these abuses and will testify at the planned war crime trials.It’s important to emphasize here that the files of senior personnel working inthe ICC are likely part of the database of information gained through thehacking incident announcement on June 4.Goode describes how information obtained by hacking into the personnel files ofgovernment workers is part of planned war crime trials that will be conducted asa result of the testimonies of defectors/witnesses: > This was an unusual meeting because of the types of people that were present.> There was a presentation of the information provided to the Alliance Council> by the defectors and what they would testify to. The “Earth Based Alliance”> then presented a large amount of information that they had just obtained> through hacking and espionage from western governments (U.S. and E.U.). Once> this presentation was over, the “Earth Based Alliance” and the> “Defectors/Witnesses” were escorted to the next part in their activities.[563]> [index_split_076.html#filepos930768] Goode claimed that the “Secret Space Program Alliance Council” was activelyseeking data on personnel that will be used in planned trials against theCabal/Illuminati for “crimes against humanity” which occurred in the differentsecret space programs.At a meeting in June 2015 with representatives of the Cabal/Illuminati an offerwas made, which Goode described, for a limited disclosure deal by November 2015if the Secret Space Program Alliance stopped its “full disclosure activities”and plans for war crimes trials. Raw Teir-Eir responded to the Cabal/Illuminatioffer in this way, according to Goode: > I had a short communication with “Teir-Eir” where as usual I began to report> what happened and he interrupted me by raising his hand. He then communicated> that much of what we call \"Full Disclosure\" is not in any one group's hands.> As more of this info is reported by \"US,\" the more it awakens people and> enters their mass consciousness. The awakening population and their mass> consciousness/co-creative abilities will determine when or how soon some of> these events occur. He further communicated that we should keep up what we are> doing and keep the information flowing at a high rate through trusted sources.> As this information spreads among the awakened and awakening, the quicker we> will cause the timeline of disclosure to happen with the power of the mass> consciousness that we still do not fully understand.[564]> [index_split_076.html#filepos931235] Figure 32. Ra Teir-Eir. Source: GaiamTV[images/00019.jpg] The “full disclosure event” described by Goode will transform human society inmajor ways as a result of humanity learning we are not alone. If all theinformation about the secret space programs is released in a “full disclosureevent”, this will certainly lead to deep soul searching as billions try to copewith the enormity of what was held secret, and the crimes that were committed.Even a “partial disclosure” announcement by the Cabal/Illuminati, such as anofficial announcement about the discovery of extraterrestrial life would have apowerful impact on humanity. It is even possible that a partial disclosureannouncement would precede a full disclosure event. Nevertheless, a full orpartial “disclosure event” is only the prelude to the final event thatcorresponds with the ascension/harvest described in the Law of One material. "},{"pageContent":"The Event/Ascension The RA group estimated that the ascension/harvest would take place approximatelythirty years after the time of Elkins/Reuckert channelings, which places it inthe 2011-2014 period. This coincides with the appearance of the Sphere BeingAlliance and the activation of giant moon to Jupiter size spheres positioned tobuffer cosmic energies, and also impose a solar system wide quarantine. The“Event” the Sphere Being Alliance is referring to appears to be the sameascension/harvesting event as described by the Ra group.Goode has not given any specific dates for the disclosure and ascension relatedevents, explaining that the collective consciousness of humanity will choose tomanifest how and when these play out. As described earlier, on July 18, 2015Goode made an announcement about the spheres being close to completing theirprimary function and requiring less buffering of the cosmic energy entering intoour solar system. The cosmic energies are therefore being allowed to fullyimpact our sun, and all life on Earth.Goode described the effect of these cosmic energies on individuals: > This energetic change has a direct effect on not only every planet and star in> the region, but also every life form below a certain vibratory level. This can> cause extreme swings in the way beings behave. Lower Vibrational (or “Negative> Beings”) will become more reactionary and their behavior towards their current> polarity will be enhanced. Beings that are Higher Vibrational (or> “Positive/Loving Beings”) will begin to have those qualities enhanced. Beings> of both polarities will need some sort of guidance offered by beings that have> been through this process so that they can make the decisions to continue to> raise their vibrations to match the changing background energetic changes or> chose to remain in their current state of lower vibration and> self-destruct.[565] [index_split_076.html#filepos931796] Goode’s reference to the polarities being enhanced applies to both humans andextraterrestrials located on Earth as well as those located within the solarsystem. The Blue Avians and Sphere Being Alliance have been playing aconstructive role in helping humanity come through the dangers posed by the“extreme swings in the way beings behave” due to the increasing cosmic energies.For example, Goode describes how the Sphere Being Alliance encouraged the SecretSpace Program Alliance to put an end to armed hostilities with theCabal/Illuminati led secret space programs, and instead focus on encouraging afull disclosure event. To achieve this, the Sphere Being Alliance providedadvanced technologies to the Secret Space Program Alliance, and helped thelatter develop a full disclosure plan that emphasized “people power” in findingan answer for what to do with the Cabal/Illuminati: > The wiser leadership among the SSP Alliance Council are in agreement (the more> militant members are not) with the Sphere Beings that the ultimate answer is> one that comes from the people themselves. The population is waking up at a> considerable rate, but they still have quite a lot of mind control and> disinformation to contend with. Once we reach a point of absolute and full> disclosure of humanity’s true history, the list of groups that have meddled in> our social and genetic development (and to what extent), the horrific crimes> against humanity by the appointed “Elite”, some of the Ancient Earth Break> Away Civilizations and various ET Groups; this will push the people themselves> to rise up and end the Babylonian Money Magic Slave System. [People themselves> will] bring all of the before mentioned groups to justice with the help of> positive off world groups, and through some of the more traumatic disclosures> that come to light (that many will call “Fear Porn” but are a part of full> disclosure none the less) that will cause a much needed “Genetic and Energetic> Memory” to occur to our species, that will assist us in not repeating the> cycles of history that we have been manipulated to repeat over more cycles> than our current era history has any knowledge of. This is also about> preparing humanity to stand on its own as a manipulated race for the first> time in its history.[566] [index_split_076.html#filepos932415] The possibility that humanity will come through the series of events culminatingin the final ascension event as a collective global society is an intriguingpossibility. The Ra group said that it was very rare for 3rd densitycivilizations (such as Earth) to evolve as collectives into a 4th densitycivilization. > We may note at this point while you ponder the possibility/probability> vortices that although you have many, many items which cause distress and thus> offer seeking and service opportunities, there is always one container in that> store of peace, love, light, and joy. This vortex may be very small, but to> turn one’s back upon it is to forget the infinite possibilities of the present> moment. Could your planet polarize towards harmony in one fine, strong, moment> of inspiration? Yes, my friends. It is not probable; but it is ever> possible.[567] [index_split_076.html#filepos932902] In 1981, when the Ra group said the Earth was “unlikely to polarize towardsharmony in one fine, strong, moment of inspiration,” it was a time of renewedtensions in the Cold War. Ronald Reagan had begun his first Presidential term onJanuary 20 and was a war hawk; where he upgraded the U.S. nuclear weaponsarsenal, especially in Europe, with a new generation of intermediate nuclearmissiles, and began advocating the Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars).Many sincerely believed Reagan’s peace-through-strength policy was unnecessarywar mongering, which could easily lead to a devastating nuclear war, andplanetary catastrophe.Yet in late 1985, Reagan began making peaceful overtures to Mikhail Gorbachev,the newly installed leader of the Soviet Union, to cooperate against a“hypothetical” extraterrestrial threat. The carrot Reagan dangled for globalcooperation was advanced space technologies from the U.S. secret space program.As discussed in chapter seven, this culminated in a secret agreement between theU.S., the Soviet Union and other major nations to create a United Nations spaceprogram, as revealed by Goode. This was the key secret agreement that led to theend of the Cold War. The world’s leaders had made the improbable decision,according to the Ra group, “to polarize towards harmony in one fine, strong,moment of inspiration.” Indeed it was an inspired moment for all who livedthrough it, and very likely why humanity did not experience the kind ofdestructive earth changes that the psychic, Gordon Michael Scallion, and othershad predicted throughout the 1990’s.[568] [index_split_076.html#filepos933305]The end of the Cold War, and the global cooperation it spawned, helped humanitythrough another challenging period that had been prophesied. Edgar Caycepredicted that the “Battle of Armageddon” would begin in 1999.[569][index_split_076.html#filepos933658] Similarly, Nostradamus prophesied that 1999would witness the return of the “King of Terror.”[570][index_split_076.html#filepos934008] In prophetic terms, both were very close tothe mark. On September 11, 2001, the destruction of the twin towers in New YorkCity symbolized the return of the “King of Terror,” predicted by Nostradamus.The multinational attack on Afghanistan in September 2001, followed by the U.S.led attack on Iraq in 2003, symbolized the “Battle of Armageddon” predicted byCayce. Yet, what mitigated these events in terms of their destructive worldwideimpact was the underlying global cooperation established by the end of the ColdWar. Most importantly, the “Global Galactic League of Nations” secret spaceprogram ensured continued multinational cooperation, despite tensions caused bythe wars in the former Yugoslavia (1991-2001); Iraq (2003-); Syria (2011-) andUkraine (2015-).It is very possible that humanity’s rapid rise in consciousness as a result ofthe end of the Cold War, and the prevention of destructive earth changes had theCold War continued, made it possible for a planet-wide ascension/harvest tooccur for most of the population into a 4th density society. Far more would beable to participate in this collective ascension event than was previouslythought possible, according to the Ra Group in 1981. For Goode, the fulldisclosure event and its aftermath would be “the beginning of what the SSPAlliance had dreamed of, a ‘Star Trek Civilization’.”[571][index_split_076.html#filepos934324]In addition to the release of advanced technologies that will help humanitytransition to a 4th/5th density “Star Trek Civilization,” there will also be animportant evolutionary step forward in using the power of consciousness.Enhanced human abilities such as telepathy, telekinesis, and even teleportationwill be spontaneously developed by individuals in the future 4th/5th densitysociety on Earth. Not only will the Earth house a technologically advanced “StarTrek Civilization”, but humanity will also have its own corps of “Jedi Knights”capable of using enhanced psychic abilities and evolved consciousness to travelthrough space and time. The citizens of a post-disclosure 4th/5th density Earthsociety will be surely welcomed as full members of a galactic community.How can the reader expedite this transformative process in their own uniqueindividual way? The Law of One material advocates recognizing the “distortions”[free will choices] that alienate us from one another and the naturalenvironment: > As one proceeds from the primal distortion of free will, one proceeds to the> understanding of the focal points of intelligent energy which have created the> intelligences or the ways of a particular mind/body/spirit complex in its> environment, both what you would call natural and what you would call> man-made. Thus, the distortions to be avoided are those which do not take into> consideration the distortions of the focus of energy of love/light, or shall> we say, the Logos of this particular sphere or density. These include the lack> of understanding of the needs of the natural environment, the needs of> other-selves’ mind/body/spirit complexes.[572]> [index_split_076.html#filepos934727] Recognizing the needs of the natural environment and of others; is, therefore,an important first step in removing the “distortions” leading to, for example,war, poverty and disease on Earth. The next step is to recognize how aconnection to either the natural environment or to one’s “higher self,” offersimportant insights into our own personal evolution: > Thus, you have two simple directives: awareness of the intelligent energy> expressed in nature, awareness of the intelligent energy expressed in self to> be shared, when it seems appropriate, by the entity with the social> complex.... and you have one infinitely subtle and various set of distortions> of which you may be aware; that is, distortions with respect to self and> other-selves not concerning free will but concerning harmonious relationships> and service to others as other-selves would most benefit.[573]> [index_split_076.html#filepos935111] Spending time appreciating and respecting the natural environment, andconnecting with the “intelligent energy” expressing itself through the abundanceof Earth’s forests, gardens, oceans and myriad life forms; are therefore vitallyimportant aspects for ascending through the density levels. Concurrently,finding ways of expressing one’s unique gifts as an artist, orator, inventor,writer, scientist, etc., in service-to-others is the adjacent path one can takefor the ascension process.Here is Goode’s description of “The Message,” delivered by the Blue Avians,which will enable the individual reader to participate constructively in theamazing full disclosure and ascension events that lie ahead. > What is this “Message”?> Every day focus on becoming more “Service To Others” oriented. Focus on being> more “Loving” and “Focus on raising your Vibrational and Consciousness Level”> and to learn to “Forgive Yourself and Others” (thus “Releasing Karma”). This> will change the Vibration of the Planet, the “Shared Consciousness of> Humanity” and “Change Humanity One Person at a time” (even if that “One> Person” is yourself.). They say to treat your body as a temple and change over> to a “Higher Vibrational Diet” to aid in the other changes. This sounds to> many like a “Hippy Love and Peace” message that will not make a difference. I> assure you the “Path” they lay out in “Their Message” is a difficult one. Even> on the unlikely chance that these technologies stay “Suppressed”, imagine what> a world we would live in if everyone made these changes to their selves?[574]> [index_split_076.html#filepos935495] Figure 33. Social Imperatives for Full Disclosure & Ascension Events[images/00016.jpg] The emphasis on forgiveness and a “Hippy Love and Peace” message is wisecounsel. Recent history has shown that societies that make a significanttransition from one kind of social and political order to another—e.g. the endof the apartheid regime in South Africa—requires finding the right balancebetween conflicting social and legal imperatives of Truth and Justice, andForgiveness and Mercy, to build a peaceful post-conflict society. Finding thisright balance will help considerably as humanity transitions from a DisclosureEvent to an Ascension Event that affects our entire planet.This book’s investigation of Corey Goode’s extraordinary claims has demonstratedtheir consistency with available documentation and other whistleblower’stestimonies. Further investigations must continue to validate the credibility ofwhistleblowers like Goode. His and other’s claims are significant to develop acoherent picture of a complex jigsaw puzzle concerning classified space programsand extraterrestrial activities, that have been successfully hidden from thegeneral public for decades. The information released by Goode so far is only thefirst wave of what will come. It lays a vital foundation as more whistleblowersand documents emerge to help us all discern the truth with clarity amidst thedramatic haze of disinformation. It is through the brave acts of thesewhistleblowers, revealing further details about secret space programs andextraterrestrial alliances, that our lives will find valuable new meaning as weevolve with this information that will impact us in all imaginable ways.
