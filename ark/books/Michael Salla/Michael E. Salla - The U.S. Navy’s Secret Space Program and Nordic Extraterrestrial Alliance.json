I am truly blessed to have such a wonderful human being who supports mywriting and truth telling endeavors in every possible way. Michael E. Salla, Ph.D.February 23, 2017"},{"pageContent":"FOREWORD When Michael gave me an advance copy of his book (the one you are about toread), I turned the pages with great interest because his most recent book wasonly two years ago, (Insiders Reveal…Secret Space Programs and ExtraterrestrialAlliances ©2015). What amazed me in this current book was his ability to createa highly credible scenario of how the innermost secrets of UFO history have beenkept from the public and how the Navy may have been able to create a secretspace program of its own that the Air Force and CIA might not even know about. One of the reasons I was grateful to be asked to write this foreword isthat Michael Salla’s earlier work (Kennedy’s Last Stand) took great advantage inreferring as evidence the questioned “leaked” documents that my son Ryan and Iput on the website, www.majesticdocuments.com. Those documents and theirapparent authenticity lead me to listen carefully when I first meet people withwild personal stories. Dr. Salla takes the unfolding testimony of a source whoapproached me, William M. Tompkins, and synthesizes his information with otherkey witnesses such as Corey Goode, showing that many of the details of theirreports are exceptionally consistent. Examples would include development of theNazi capability in Antarctica before, during and after WWII and theirrelationship with alien races. This book is chronologically comfortable, beginning correctly with the“Battle of L.A.” as a critical event in triggering an intense interest inGovernment study of the UFO dilemma and linking this to the William Tompkinsearly involvement with both UFOs and the Navy. His remarkable assignment was tolisten to the briefings of Navy spies sponsored creatively by James Forrestalbefore the US entry into the war. Many of the recollections of what these spiessaid was going on in Germany and Antarctica are then correlated with the reportsfrom other sources and used to confirm the deep awareness of the Navy in thedetails of the Nazi technology sophistication. Salla highlights the specific testimony in the Tompkins autobiography,Selected by Extraterrestrials, (of which I was editor). This book providespersonalized details of his involvement in the Douglas “think tank.” Tompkinsreports the decision to create the RAND Corporation specifically to study thealien ET problem. Salla properly emphasizes the assignment of Tompkins thedraftsman to draw designs of kilometer-long planned Naval spacecraft in the1950’s. They were presumably precursors to the Navy’s later Solar WardenProgram, now in space since the 1980s. Many of us have heard the rumors that somehow the Star Trek televisionprogram might have been influenced by reality, but Salla lays out the specificdetails of the links of the executive producer, Gene Roddenberry, to ViceAdmiral Leslie Stevens III. He was the possible source of some of the themesbased on his involvement in leaking the plots related to his involvement inpsychological warfare. Some of the stories may have been based on the facts ofsome alien interactions. The reality of what we encountered in our covertstudies may have told us who the good guys were (Nordics = Capt. Kirk) and thebad guys (Draco Reptilians = Klingons). This book is consistent with Salla’s other works in having superbreferences to nearly every claim or unusual allegation. His hundreds ofreferences are normally to written works, but if his source is electronic, heprovides whatever electronic source he had at the time. I checked several ofthem, and they are still alive with content as I write this foreword. One of the most stimulating aspects of this book is Salla’s willingness tospeculate about the relations that may have affected the Trump election resultsand how the FBI and maybe even the Nordics could have played a role. He makes itclear that in his judgment there is evidence that would support the contentionthat the CIA has been infiltrated by the Nazis and Reptilians, and that we mayright now be on the threshold of seeing whether the good guys (US Navy, FBI andthe Nordics) vs. bad guys (CIA, USAF, NSA and the Cabal) will win and define thefuture of our world. He notes that Trump has selected military advisors who maybe familiar with the Secret Space Programs and have declared a plan tosignificantly increase the Navy budget. One of the more impressive results reflected in this work is Salla’sreliability to verify and validate. For example, when Tompkins claimed that hehad worked for Rick O’Botta, (as spelled in the first edition of Tompkins’book), he determined that he was working for Rico Botta based on copies of hissignature, and then researched Botta’s Naval record in the archives, showingthat he was indeed the person assigned to be in charge of the Naval Air Stationat the time of Tompkins’ assignment there. This example is a powerful reason toaccept the claims in this book as being supported by evidence. Another thing that impresses me is that Michael Salla could extractexceptional insight to the reports of William Tompkins from personalconversations as well as a scrutiny of some of his interviews with radio showhost Jeff Rense, learning many things that I, as Tompkins’ close collaboratorand book editor, had never heard of. He has woven these facts seamlessly intothe story of the remarkable complicity of different organizations that createdsecret space programs unknown to the public. My own personal involvement in the things that led to this book is coveredbeautifully in the Preface that follows. However, although Salla’s last bookcame out in 2015, I didn’t get a copy until early 2016 after Tompkins’ book wasalready out. I ordered a copy from Amazon and had it mailed directly toTompkins. As noted in the Preface, he was stunned, because he thought that hewas going to be the first person to reveal the “role of Nazi Germany and the USNavy in developing secret space programs.” The development of the secret space programs would have been dependent onadvanced technology, which is not a secret to those who built the craft. Ourscientific knowledge from aliens must transcend anything in the open literature.I would have welcomed some reference to what Salla’s views might be on timetravel or “jump rooms” that allegedly have permitted us to go to Mars and othersolar systems not using craft. Maybe that will be in his next book. In themeantime, read this one. By Robert M. WoodPh.D. in Physics, Cornell University, 1953.Research and Development Manager,1949-1993 Douglas/McDonnell Douglas.UFO Investigator and author 1994-present."},{"pageContent":"PREFACE In December 2015, a remarkable book was published detailing a highlycredentialed aerospace engineer’s direct exposure to secret space programs andextraterrestrial intervention in human affairs. What immediately distinguishedWilliam Tompkins’ book, Selected by Extraterrestrials: My life in the top secretworld of UFO’s, think tanks and Nordic secretaries, was the extensive number ofdocuments he presented that substantiated key aspects of his testimony. Thedocuments he included could be confirmed and fact checked. Information foundwithin them allowed for further investigation, especially in terms of historicrecords and Freedom of Information Act documents, to confirm whether or not hewas revealing actual historic events that had taken place.What lent even greater credibility to Tompkins’ book was that its editor, Dr.Robert Wood, had worked at the same aviation company where Tompkins says he wasasked to design kilometers-long secret spacecraft for the US Navy. Dr. Wood wasemployed with Douglas Aircraft Company (later McDonnell Douglas) over a 43 yearperiod (1949-1993), and worked there at the same time as Tompkins (1950-1963),even though the two had never met prior to 2009.[1][part0000_split_046.html#_edn1]Among Dr. Wood’s assignments while at Douglas was to research UFO reports todetermine the feasibility of flying saucer designs for the aerospace industry.He was assigned this task by Douglas after he met with chief executives: One day after I reported to a couple of VP’s on how we were doing, one of themasked me personally if I was doing anything interesting outside of my job.‘You’re not going to believe this, but I’ve read about 50 books on UFOs’, Isaid, and ‘the amazing conclusion I have come to is that they are very realextraterrestrial craft’. The only thing that’s uncertain is whether we find outhow they work before or after our competitor Lockheed. After a moment of silenceone of them (VP) said, ‘how much would it cost to take a look at that question’?Therefore we started a project, quite low key, to take a look at the question ofhow they work.[2] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn2] Dr. Wood was able to corroborate the names of key engineers, scientists andprojects at Douglas, which Tompkins referred to; especially senior companyofficials such as Elmer Wheaton and Dr. Klemperer who are key figures in whatTompkins said took place in a secret think tank at Douglas. Regarding this Dr.Wood wrote: I knew or had met nearly all of the people he referenced, especially the keypersons he worked for in a “think tank”, Elmer Wheaton and his German scientificadvisor, Wolfgang B. Klemperer. His story of the work he did exactly coincideswith what I remember, although I was not aware that there was a think tank atthat time at that location. [3] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn3] Dr. Wood was so impressed with Tompkins’ detailed and accurate testimony that hedecided to assist him by becoming the editor of his autobiography. He wrote thefollowing conclusion in his Preface to Tompkins’ book: I have total confidence that he is honestly telling the story as he bestremembers it. Fortunately, Bill had kept some copies of some photos anddocuments that support this story and are included as figures as they apply.They do indeed enhance the credibility of this man’s amazing life so far.[4][part0000_split_046.html#_edn4] In January 2016, after I had heard several interviews featuring both Tompkinsand Dr. Wood, which aired in December 2015 on the popular Jeff Rense radio show,I immediately got in touch with Dr. Wood to learn more about Tompkins.[5][part0000_split_046.html#_edn5] He vouched for Tompkins bona fides and thesignificance of his testimony for understanding the UFO phenomenon. What I foundespecially intriguing was that Dr. Wood pointed out that when he read my ownbook, Insiders Reveal Secret Space Programs and Extraterrestrial Life, which hadbeen published in September 2015, he was struck by the similarities withTompkins’ information. He immediately ordered a copy for Tompkins and gave it tohim. Dr. Wood said that Tompkins reaction upon reading my own book was one ofastonishment. I subsequently spoke by phone with Tompkins. He stated that he hadbeen told that he would be the first to reveal the role of Nazi Germany and theUS Navy in developing secret space programs, and the role played by differentextraterrestrial civilizations.My book investigated the whistleblower claims of Corey Goode, who said he servedin a secret space program created by the Navy called Solar Warden, as well asother related programs for a twenty year period, from 1987 to 2007. I found muchin the way of historic documents, additional whistleblower testimony andcircumstantial evidence which supported Goode’s startling claims. Tompkins’information added significant details and, most importantly, documents thathelped validate key parts of Goode’s testimony. More significantly, as you willread in chapter nine of this book, there is a very good reason why there are somany similarities between Tompkins and Goode’s accounts of respective NaziGermany and US Navy secret space programs.After speaking with Dr. Wood and Tompkins in January, I decided to travel frommy Hawaii home to San Diego to meet with them both in February 2016. Iencountered Tompkins as someone who despite his advanced age (92 at the time)still possessed a sharp mind and great attention for detail. While no longerhaving a photographic memory, which marked him out as exceptional early in hisaerospace career, Tompkins could still remember the bulk of what he hadexperienced.At his San Diego home, Tompkins brought out six boxes of documents which Dr.Wood and I examined. He allowed us to copy the most relevant documents for ourrespective investigations. These documents were invaluable since they added moredetails about Tompkins’ long and distinguished career in the aerospace industry,and with the US Navy in various capacities. Significantly, despite his officialretirement, Tompkins continues to work as a ‘consultant’ for the Navy with acurrent security clearance. I have travelled two more times to San Diego to meetwith Tompkins (October and December 2016). On each visit, Dr. Wood and I havebeen able to see more of his documentation, which he needs to retrieve from anearby storage area—some of which are reproduced in this book.In mid-2016, I began working with an attorney, Duke Brickhouse, Esq., to trackdown Freedom of Information Act documents that shed light on Rear Admiral RicoBotta, the senior Navy officer Tompkins identified as the key figure in a WorldWar II covert Navy operation to spy on Nazi Germany’s secret aerospace programs.The FOIA documents we received (over 1500 pages) provided conclusive evidencethat supported Tompkins’ claims of having worked with Admiral Botta on a covertintelligence gathering project related to experimental aircraft research. Someof these documents are presented in chapter two.Chapters three and four discuss developments at Douglas Aircraft Company and itsoffshoot, Project RAND, after World War II concerning intelligence briefingdocuments about Germany’s secret space program, and the study of crashed UFOs.Of special interest is Tompkins’ account of the role played by competing groupsof extraterrestrials, described by him as “Reptilian” and human-looking“Nordics,” in the development of advanced aerospace technologies both in NaziGermany and the US. Tompkins says that the “Nordics” had infiltrated DouglasAircraft, and helped him create designs for future US Navy space battle groups.Additional FOIA requests were made concerning other Navy officers identified byTompkins as relevant to what had occurred in Nazi Germany, and the Navy’ssubsequent development of a secret space program. The FOIA documents received todate provide important details, which corroborate key aspects of the big pictureTompkins has revealed about Navy space battle fleets capable of interstellaroperations. Chapters five and eight will discuss these “big picture” aspects interms of “soft disclosure,” where two popular science fiction series can bedirectly connected to the Navy’s secret space program that Tompkins helpeddesign.I also was able to track down and interview three retired US Navy officers (aRear Admiral, a Captain and a Commander) who were willing to attest to Tompkins’bona fides, as an expert in areas of special interest to the Navy, when he wasPresident of the Rogue Valley Council Navy League from 1991 to 1999. Inparticular, two of the officers were identified on a document provided byTompkins revealing the existence of a “Special Projects Committee” that Tompkinssays discussed plans for various extraterrestrial and secret space programrelated projects. Two of the Navy officers confirmed that the Special ProjectsCommittee existed, and that Tompkins often discussed the extraterrestrial topicin meetings. Importantly, they confirmed that Tompkins was regarded as an experton the extraterrestrial topic and was well connected to important Navy officialswhen it came to this subject. Documents pertinent to the projects Tompkinsconducted at the Navy League are found in chapter seven.It is important to note that Tompkins states he was permitted to come forwardwith his testimony and documents with the approval of a senior Navy officialwanting to disclose the existence of the Navy’s secret space program. Tompkins’claim that his disclosures are covertly sanctioned by the Navy is borne out byhis continued work as a Navy consultant, and is confirmed within a document heconfidentially showed Dr. Wood and I.Tompkins’ continued relationship with the Navy while coming forward with histestimony becomes even more momentous given the outcome of the 2016 USPresidential election. Chapter 10 reveals a limited disclosure initiative thatinvolved key figures in the Clinton campaign. They were informally briefed abouta “limited disclosure” initiative involving a US Air Force run secret spaceprogram, which operates independently of the Navy’s more technologicallyadvanced program. Chapter 11 focuses on the key institutional relationships thatPresident Trump needs to develop in order for “official disclosure” of secretspace programs to occur. What this means for ending a technological dividebetween the vast majority of humanity and those belonging to a smaller breakawayhuman civilization is vital to understand.The prospects of “full disclosure” of secret space programs and extraterrestriallife under President Trump’s administration is examined in chapter 12, in lightof his choices of senior national security personnel. The prospects of themgaining “need to know” access to secret space program information in order tocompetently brief Trump will be assessed, as will Trump’s likely response. Thefinal chapter takes a close look at the role of the “Nordics” and other friendlyextraterrestrials in terms of what their technological and spiritual assistancemeans for full disclosure, as well as preparing humanity for predicted solar andcosmic events that are expected to radically transform life on Earth.The documents presented in this book not only directly support the testimony ofWilliam Tompkins, but also corroborate the testimony of Corey Goode and othersecret space program whistleblowers. This book should therefore be considered asvolume two to Insiders Reveal Secret Space Program and ExtraterrestrialAlliances. The information in these two books about the connection between thehistoric development of multiple secret space programs and differentextraterrestrial civilizations is life changing—it certainly was for me.

An unknown number of unidentified aircraft silently flew in a 40-mile arcacross the sky, centered over Long Beach, while the US Army and Navy ships inLong Beach Harbor unleashed anti-aircraft artillery barrages against themysterious objects. They were feared to be Japanese aircraft about to launchanother surprise Pearl Harbor-like attack. Hundreds of thousands witnessed thehovering UFOs, which were well lit up for several hours by searchlights and theanti-aircraft artillery during a total blackout. The UFOs did not attack butdamage was done by the artillery shells which fell to the ground causingsignificant property losses.The events of that night were extensively covered by major newspapers, includingthe Los Angeles Times, which wrote a number of stories about the unexplodedartillery shells and property damage. Here is how a 1983 book officiallydocumenting US Air Force history, The Army Air Forces in World War II, describedthe incident which involved as many as 25 unknown craft flying near Long Beachas written in an Army Colonel’s report: During the night of 24/25 February 1942, unidentified objects caused asuccession of alerts in southern California... An alert called at 1918 [7:18p.m., Pacific time] was lifted at 2223, and the tension temporarily relaxed. Butearly in the morning of the 25th renewed activity began. Radars picked up anunidentified target 120 miles west of Los Angeles. Figure 1. Los Angeles Times Coverage of Air Raid Incident[../images/00002.jpeg] Antiaircraft batteries were alerted at 0215 and were put on Green Alert—ready tofire—a few minutes later. The AAF kept its pursuit planes on the ground,preferring to await indications of the scale and direction of any attack beforecommitting its limited fighter force. Radars tracked the approaching target towithin a few miles of the coast, and at 0221 the regional controller ordered ablackout. Thereafter the information center was flooded with reports of “enemyplanes, ” even though the mysterious object tracked in from sea seems to havevanished. At 0243, planes were reported near Long Beach, and a few minutes latera coast artillery colonel spotted “about 25 planes at 12,000 feet” over LosAngeles. At 0306 a balloon carrying a red flare was seen over Santa Monica andfour batteries of anti-aircraft artillery opened fire, whereupon “the air overLos Angeles erupted like a volcano.”[6] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn6] This book, published by the Office of Air Force History, went on to describeunconfirmed reports of several of the UFOs being shot down: These mysterious forces dropped no bombs and, despite the fact that 1,440 roundsof antiaircraft ammunition were directed against them, suffered no losses. Therewere reports, to be sure, that four enemy planes had been shot down, and one wassupposed to have landed in flames at a Hollywood intersection. Residents in aforty-mile arc along the coast watched from hills or rooftops as the play ofguns and searchlights provided the first real drama of the war for citizens ofthe mainland.[7] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn7] In contrast to the Air Force official history book’s account of the Los AngelesAir Raid’s mystery craft, the official explanation by Frank Knox, Secretary ofthe Navy, at a Press Conference on the morning of the event was that theincident was “just a false alarm” caused by jittery nerves. His statement isillustrated in the following February 25, 1942, Los Angeles Times article (seeFigure 2).Henry Stimson, Secretary of the Army, waited a day before issuing a statementthat laid the foundation for the subsequent 1983 official Air Force history ofthe Los Angeles incident. He said that up to five unidentified craft wereinvolved in the incident and proposed two explanations: [L]ocal commanders … indicated a belief that from one to five unidentifiedairplanes had been over Los Angeles. Secretary Stimson announced this conclusionas the War Department version of the incident, and he advanced two theories toaccount for the mysterious craft: either they were commercial planes operated byan enemy from secret fields in California or Mexico, or they were light planeslaunched from Japanese submarines. In either case, the enemy’s purpose must havebeen to locate anti-aircraft defenses in the area or to deliver a blow atcivilian morale.[8] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn8] Figure 2. News Coverage of Navy Secretary's View of LA Air Raid[../images/00003.jpeg]The conflicting Army and Navy explanations served only to confuse the situationas a New York Times editorial explained: The New York Times on 28 February expressed a belief that the more the incidentwas studied, the more incredible it became: “If the batteries were firing onnothing at all, as Secretary Knox implies, it is a sign of expensiveincompetence and jitters. If the batteries were firing on real planes, some ofthem as low as 9,000 feet, as Secretary Stimson declares, why were theycompletely ineffective? Why did no American planes go up to engage them, or evento identify them?[9] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn9] Knox’s quick dismissal of the Los Angeles UFO incident appeared to be an effortto cover-up the seriousness of what had happened. This was highlighted by theArmy’s more forthright statement about the unidentified aircraft that wereinvolved. What was the Navy trying to cover up? Figure 3. Los Angeles Times Covers Army Secretary on LA Air Raid[../images/00004.jpeg] Among the thousands of witnesses to the event was a young William Tompkins, whowas 17 years old at the time and living with his parents in Long Beach. He gotto see the extraordinary event up close. Now at age 93, Tompkins wrote about theincident in his 2015 autobiography, Selected by Extraterrestrials: On February 25, 1942, three months after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, a verystrange thing happened. By this time, my family had moved to Long Beach. We werenow living in a high second-floor apartment that was converted from a largehome. It was only four blocks from the ocean. At about 8:00 pm on the night inquestion, my father called my brother and me to our deck, which faced the bay.There was a strange intense light just above the horizon: a narrow beam pointingtowards the ocean. The little beam turned horizontally, right into our eyes, andhit the back wall of our apartment and the surrounding trees. It was blinding.Suddenly, and bafflingly, the light went out. Whatever it was, had gone. Therewas nothing we could do but stand there amazed. Finally we retired to our beds.Just after midnight, the air-raid sirens and anti-aircraft guns of the coastalartillery woke everyone up. We ran out onto the street and saw a large roundcraft, above seven thousand-feet up, floating in the air above us. It slowed toa stop right overhead and remained stationary. It was lit up by eightsearchlights, while anti-aircraft shells burst all around and against it. Mostof the shells exploded on the bottom of the craft – we just couldn’t believe thething hadn’t exploded or been shot down. Three, then five, other ships appearednear it; some of the searchlights, as well as the anti-aircraft teams, focusedon each one as they passed the first object. Eventually, the first craft slowlydeparted as well.[10] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn10] Tompkins and many other reports support the official Army position that therewere several unidentified aircraft involved in the Los Angeles Air Raidincident. The Los Angeles Examiner reported that civilian witnesses hadestimated 50 planes that slowly traveled in a “V” formation.[11][part0000_split_046.html#_edn11]Some of the UFO craft stopped motionless over Long Beach, according to Tompkins.Clearly, these were not conventional aircraft, and displayed an advancedpropulsion system unknown at the time. It would be after the war that the firsthelicopters would be built with the ability to hover, yet these hovering craftover Los Angeles were silent according to Tompkins and other witness reports.The motivation for the Navy’s Secretary Knox to cover-up the incident nowbecomes clearer. The unknown craft’s ability to hover and withstand an artillerybarrage would have sent shock waves through the general public and the WarDepartment.There were several aircraft companies in the Los Angeles area which included theDouglas Aircraft Company, headquartered in Santa Monica, and Lockheed Aircraft,headquartered in Burbank. We know that senior personnel from Douglas, includingits President Donald Douglas, personally witnessed these events, according toTompkins, who later worked for 12 years with the Douglas Aircraft Company.[12][part0000_split_046.html#_edn12] These aviation industry leaders immediatelyrealized the revolutionary significance of the propulsion systems displayed bythe hovering UFOs as described by Tompkins.In addition, Long Beach Naval Shipyard at the time was under the direct flightpath of the UFOs, and this would have been a major concern for the Navy. Werethe UFOs part of a reconnaissance mission by Japan, or other Axis powers, toascertain the strength of anti-aircraft defenses for a possible future attack,as the Secretary of the Army hypothesized? Or, were the UFOs interplanetary inorigin raising the possibility of revolutionary propulsion systems that couldradically transform the aviation industry and significantly impact the wareffort?In either case, both the Office of Naval Intelligence and Army Intelligence(G-2) would certainly have attached great urgency to studying the UFOs involvedin the incident, and especially retrieving any artifacts from the craft targetedby the artillery barrage. This leads to the question of whether any of thereports of up to four craft being shot down were in any way accurate, despitethe Army’s official dismissal of such reports? According to the Los AngelesExaminer, civilians reported that three craft had been shot down while over theocean.[13] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn13] Tompkins says that he learned fromconfidential Navy sources (he was working at the time as an asset for the Officeof Naval Intelligence) that two flying saucer-shaped craft were shot down.[14][part0000_split_046.html#_edn14] The saucers were recovered respectively by theNavy and the Army, and it was discovered that the saucer-shaped craft wereunmanned fully automated drones.[15] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn15]A leaked official document, whose authenticity is still disputed, refers to twoUFO craft being shot down and being secretly retrieved respectively by the Navyand the Army: … regarding the air raid over Los Angeles it was learned by Army G2 that RearAdmiral Anderson … Naval Intelligence, has informed the War Department of anaval recovery of an unidentified airplane off the coast of California with nobearing on conventional explanation. Further it has been revealed that the ArmyAir Corps has also recovered a similar craft in the San Bernardino Mountainseast of Los Angeles which cannot be identified as conventional aircraft. ThisHeadquarters has come to the determination that the mystery airplanes are infact not earthly and according to secret intelligence sources they are in allprobability of interplanetary origin.[16] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn16] The document is an alleged Top Secret Memorandum from Chief of Staff of theArmy, George Marshall, to President Roosevelt, dated March 5, 1942. According tothe document, Marshall: … issued orders to Army G2 that a special intelligence unit be created tofurther investigate the phenomenon and report any significant connection betweenrecent incidents and those collected by the director the office of Coordinatorof Information. [17] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn17] This is allegedly the genesis of the Army’s legendary “Interplanetary PhenomenonUnit.”The Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit (IPU) was a highly classified armyintelligence unit that did exist during the World War II era. After initiallydenying its existence, the US Air Force was eventually forced to acknowledgethat the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit did exist for a period of time.Documents released through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) confirmed theexistence of this highly secretive investigatory group, despite the best effortsby Air Force officials to cast doubt on its existence.In May 1984, for example, UFO researcher William Steinman sent a FOIA request tothe Army Directorate of Counterintelligence. Steinman received a reply from aLieutenant Colonel Lance R. Cornine: As you note in your letter, the so-called Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit (IPU)was disestablished and, as far as we are aware, all records, if any, weretransferred to the Air Force in the late 1950's. The 'unit' was formed as anin-house project purely as an interest item for the Assistant Chief of Staff forIntelligence. It was never a 'unit' in the military sense, nor was it everformally organized or reportable, it had no investigative function, mission orauthority, and may not even have had any formal records at all. It is onlythrough institutional memory that any recollection exists of this unit. We aretherefore unable to answer your questions as to the exact purpose of the unit,exactly when it was disestablished, or who was in command. This last would notapply in any case, as no one was in 'command'. We have no records ordocumentation of any kind on this unit.\"[18] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn18] Figure 4. Alleged Memo from General Marshall to Roosevelt[../images/00005.jpeg]Cornine’s letter did acknowledge that the IPU did exist, but downplayed itsexistence as merely an “interest item” that was never an operational army “unit”of any kind.In March 1987, British researcher Timothy Good also sent a FOIA request to theUS Army’s Directorate of Intelligence. Good received a reply from ColonelWilliam Guild. Guild’s letter not only confirmed the IPU’s existence, but alsorevealed that the IPU was operational at one time: Please be advised that the aforementioned Army unit was disestablished duringthe late 1950's and never reactivated. All records pertaining to this unit weresurrendered to the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations inconjunction with operation BLUEBOOK.[19] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn19] So according to the Army’s Directorate of Intelligence, the IPU did exist andwas abolished in the late 1950’s. No time line is given for when it was active.Consequently, the leaked March 5, 1942 memorandum, where General Marshallordered “Army G2” to create “a special intelligence unit” to “investigate thephenomenon,”[20] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn20] almost certainly was referringto the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit. This is the conclusion reached by Dr.Robert Wood and his son Ryan in their respective efforts to authenticate theMarshall Memorandum: The memo bears correct Office of Chief of Staff (OCS) file numbers and has\"Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit\" (IPU) typed on it at a later time by adifferent typewriter. It is logical to believe that this is the order that setsup the IPU.[21] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn21] Additional support for the authenticity of the leaked March 5, 1942 MarshallMemorandum comes from a document officially released in 1974, through theFreedom of Information Act.[22] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn22] The document isdated February 26, 1942, and again involved a memorandum from General Marshallto President Roosevelt. Issued one day after the Los Angeles Air Raid, itprovides a preliminary report of what occurred that is consistent with thecontents of the March 5 document, issued one week later. In the February 26Memorandum, Marshall tells Roosevelt: The following is the information we have from GHQ at this moment regarding theair alarm over Los Angeles of yesterday morning:From details available at this hour: 1. Unidentified airplanes, other than America Army or Navy planes, were probably over Los Angeles, and were fired on by elements of the 37th CA Brigade (AA) between 3:12 and 4:15 am. These units expended 1430 rounds of ammunition. 2. As many as fifteen airplanes may have been involved, flying at various speeds what is officially reported as being “very slow” to as much as 2000 mph and at elevations from 9000 to 18000 feet. 3. No bombs were dropped. 4. No casualties among our troops. 5. No planes were shot down. 6. No American Army or Navy planes were in action.Investigations continuing. It seems reasonable to conclude that if unidentifiedairplanes were involved they may have been from commercial sources, operated byenemy agents for purposes of spreading alarm, disclosing locations ofantiaircraft positions, and slowing production through black out. Suchconclusion is supported by varies speed of operation and the fact that no bombswere dropped.[23] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn23] The official February 26 memorandum points out that further Army investigationswere being conducted, indicating that Marshall would send updates on theincident as more was learned."},{"pageContent":" Figure 5. Feb 26, 1942 Memorandum to Roosevelt[../images/00006.jpeg]Significantly, the February 26 memorandum refers to the speed of some of theunidentified craft as “very slow,” corroborating Tompkins’ account that some ofthe craft were indeed hovering over Los Angeles. This helps authenticate thatthe craft were non-terrestrial in origin since the only known hovering capableaircraft at the time were balloons/dirigibles, which would have been easytargets for the anti-aircraft guns. Consequently, after the first memorandum wassent on February 26, Marshall was informed that two of the unidentified crafthad been located, and possessed highly advanced propulsion technologies. Thesedevelopments, after the February 26 memo was issued, would have required afollow-up memorandum by Marshall to Roosevelt, which is what the March 5memorandum appears to be.Finally, further support for the authenticity of the March 5, 1942 MarshallMemorandum may come from the Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover. In anofficial memo released through the Freedom of Information Act, Hoover handwroteon July 15, 1947 (a week after the alleged Roswell UFO crash): \"We must insistupon full access to disks recovered. For instance, in the La case the Armygrabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination.\"[24][part0000_split_046.html#_edn24] Was Hoover referring to a flying disc recoveredafter the Los Angeles Air Raid, or a disc stored at Los Alamos (La) NationalLaboratory after the Roswell incident? Whatever the answer, Hoover is indicatingthat the Army was studying recovered flying discs and not sharing informationwith the FBI.So, if Army Intelligence created the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit to study thecrashed remains of one of the Los Angeles Air Raid craft, what did the Navy dowith the craft it retrieved from the Pacific Ocean? According to informationprovided by Tompkins, the Navy created its own intelligence program to gather asmuch data about the flying saucer phenomenon as possible using its worldwideintelligence assets. This was especially important when it came to investigatingintelligence reports of Nazi Germany developing flying saucer prototypes.Figure 6. Hoover's Handwritten Comment on FBI Memo[../images/00007.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2COVERT NAVY ESPIONAGE PROGRAM ON NAZI GERMANY’S FLYING SAUCER PROJECTS "},{"pageContent":"MUSSOLINI’S FLYING DISK With the formal entry of the US into War World II on December 7, 1941, the twomain military services of the United States, the Army and Navy, would rapidlyexpand their global intelligence gathering operations to learn about the latestweapons and technology programs of the Axis Powers. Then came the extraordinaryFebruary 24/25, 1942 Los Angeles Air Raid UFO incident, which propelled theArmy’s G2 to set up the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit to investigate reports of“flying saucer” technologies being seen or developed anywhere that the USmilitary could gain access.On a parallel course, the Office of Naval Intelligence would set up its ownintelligence gathering operation to investigate the UFO phenomenon using itsworld-wide assets. Both the Army and Navy were clearly concerned over thepossibility that the Axis Powers were developing technologies reflected in whathad been seen and recovered during the Los Angeles Air Raid incident.Yet, the first documented study of an advanced flying saucer craft can be tracedto Fascist Italy almost a decade earlier. In the late 1990’s, 18 Fascist-eradocuments were leaked to Italian researchers dating from the 1930’s, which dealtwith UFOs.[25] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn25] These files were allegedlyofficial documents leaked by someone who had inherited them from a former toplevel insider in the Italian Intelligence community. Of paramount importance,the Italian documents were originals, which allowed forensic analysis todetermine their age and authenticity. After forensic analysis was completed anddismissed the possibility that they were modern forgeries; Italian researchersreleased the documents and their findings.Among the files were documents mentioning a 1933 UFO crash in the Lombardyregion involving a highly advanced craft that resembled a flying saucer. A topsecret organization called Cabinet RS/33 was created to study the capturedcraft, along with the growing number of flying saucer sightings.[26][part0000_split_046.html#_edn26] It was headed by famed Italian inventor,Guglielmo Marconi.As Cabinet RS/33 continued its classified study of the captured 1933 flyingsaucer and sightings of similar craft in the immediate years after, advisors atsome point would present Mussolini with the determination that Nazi Germany wasinvolved. The 1933 flying saucer in possession of the Italians, and/or later UFOsightings, were either part of or related in some way to a top secret Naziadvanced aviation program.Once Mussolini’s Cabinet RS/33 realized that it was Nazi Germany, and not Franceor Britain, behind the flying saucer phenomenon, this would surely influenceFascist Italy as it feverishly modernized its Air Force with the increasinglikelihood of another major European war. Discovery of a flying saucer andrelated craft belonging to a secret space program created by Germany explainsMussolini’s puzzling decision to increasingly ally himself with Hitler.A secret agreement between Hitler and Mussolini for the study and development offlying saucer technologies was reached sometime in 1938, according to one of theleaked Italian UFO documents: … in this latest consignment of material, he included copies of new documentswhich—so he said—demonstrated the existence of agreements between Hitler andMussolini for the study of alien technology, agreements that had been made in1938; these documents were: an Agency Stefani message from Florence containingan interview with the Fuhrer Hitler when he was visiting Italy; a banknote ofthe nominal value of a million Lire (maybe “black funds of the RS/33 CABINET”);minutes regarding the oath of secrecy given by the professors who collaboratedwith the Fascist Government; an invitation (registered) to Benito and RacheleMussolini to Villa Torlonia (said by “MR. X” to be for … an extremely privatemeeting dedicated to the RS/33 CABINET).[27] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn27] The secret agreement between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, to cooperate in thedevelopment of flying saucers and a secret space program, would have come to theattention of the military intelligence services of major European nations suchas Britain, France and the Soviet Union on the eve of World War II. Inparticular, Winston Churchill corresponded from 1936 to 1940 with BenitoMussolini in a failed attempt to dissuade him from establishing an alliance withHitler. It’s very likely that at some point Churchill learned something aboutwhat the Italians were doing in the field of advanced aeronautics. After WorldWar II, Churchill, allegedly with the aid of Britain’s MI6, traveled to NorthernItaly to find his private correspondence with Mussolini and have itdestroyed.[28] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn28]As Britain and the United States increasingly cooperated after the start ofarmed hostilities on September 1, 1939, British intelligence would share itsfindings about the Nazi Fascist cooperation on flying saucer programs. Apossible connection to the craft involved in the Los Angeles Air Raid incidentrequired serious investigation by the US military intelligence services.A covert espionage program was subsequently created by the Office of NavalIntelligence to infiltrate the advanced aerospace programs of Nazi Germany,which were known to be developing antigravity vehicles for possible use in WorldWar II and even for space flight. Covert naval operatives were embedded inside anumber of Nazi Germany’s most advanced research and development programs, andtasked to report back what they had seen in debriefings secretly held at NavalAir Station, San Diego. This information was then relayed by an appointed“Information Disseminator” to various US think tanks, aircraft companies anduniversity departments, where scientists and engineers attempted to understandthe principles and the war potential of the Nazi antigravity technologyprojects. Now, we finally know all this occurred since in December 2015, theNavy’s Information Disseminator publicly revealed himself. "},{"pageContent":"WILLIAM TOMPKINS: INFORMATION DISSEMINATOR FOR NAVY’S COVERT ESPIONAGE PROGRAMOUT OF NAZI OCCUPIED EUROPE William Tompkins has revealed that he worked as the “Information Disseminator”for the US Navy’s covert espionage program out of Nazi Germany from 1942 toearly 1946. To support his claim, he has supplied a mission statement datedSeptember 26, 1945, which he explains was retroactively applied to his wartimeservice. Tompkins’ mission statement is documentary support for his assertionthat he was a participant in the covert Navy espionage program set up in NaziOccupied Europe to learn about advanced aircraft programs, some of which hedescribed as using antigravity principles.Tompkins’ story begins in 1932, when he was only nine. He recounts how hisfather took him to the Navy’s deep water harbor in Long Beach, California wherehe began the first of many public tours of aircraft carriers, battleships,cruisers and destroyers, which were anchored. The public was not allowed to takephotos of the ships whose gun placements and radar designs were stillclassified. Figure 7. Tompkins' Mission Orders[../images/00008.jpeg] Possessing a photographic memory, Tompkins tells how he walked all around theships and took notes of what he observed, and soon after began reproducingscaled models. Eight years later, Tompkins had built many detailed andflawlessly accurate models of the Navy ships he had seen, and his father wassubsequently displaying them in a Hollywood Department store.In 1941, after the Navy learned about the model ships displaying top secretdetails, they interrogated Tompkins’ father rigorously, and then Tompkins,himself. The models were quickly withdrawn from public circulation. Senior Navyofficers were nevertheless greatly impressed by Tompkins’ remarkable talent. Figure 8. Tompkins' Ship Models on Display in Hollywood[../images/00009.jpeg] A March 26 article in the Evening Outlook newspaper of Santa Monica featured aphotograph of Tompkins (age 17 at the time) showing some of his ship models toNavy Captain G.C. Gearing, Commandant of the 11th Naval District in San Diego.Rear Admiral C. A. Blakeley was quoted in the Evening Outlook:It is with considerable interest and pleasure that I, together with officers ofmy staff, examined several of the ship models. Craftsmanship such as you haveevidenced shows that you are a keen student of detail and naval construction.Best of all, however, you are doing something worthwhile as a young American—youare helping to build into the American mind the importance of the nation’s firstline of defense to each American, young and old.[29][part0000_split_046.html#_edn29]Admiral Blakely had written directly to Tompkins on March 10, 1941, directlycongratulating him on his accomplishment.Figure 9. Bill Tompkins Showing his Models to Captain Gearing[../images/00010.jpeg] Tompkins’ photographic memory and ability to reproduce complex ship design wasextraordinary, and a US Naval Intelligence Officer, Lt. Perry Wood, understoodthe contribution Tompkins could make to the Navy’s pursuit of advancedtechnology:Early in 1942, naval intelligence officer Lt. Perry Wood, understanding thetechnical capabilities and historic research necessary to create the shipmodels, put together a mission package that resulted in Bill’s induction intothe navy. After completing boot camp in San Diego he was assigned a position innaval intelligence on advanced technology projects.[30][part0000_split_046.html#_edn30] Figure 10. Admiral Blakely's Letter to Bill Tompkins[../images/00011.jpeg]Fatefully, Tompkins’ abilities would come to the attention of senior officialslooking for the right person to participate in the debriefings of spies involvedin a covert espionage program out of Nazi Germany and its occupied territories.Tompkins says that Rear Admiral Rico Botta placed him on his personal staff forfour years (1942-46), and quickly elevated him to a leadership position in thecovert intelligence program, which used Naval operatives with the rank ofLieutenant. All were second generation Americans with German ancestry, whichallowed them to easily infiltrate Nazi Germany.Though officially only a seaman (E-3) when he began the covert operation,Tompkins says he replaced a Commander at North Island Naval Air Station in SanDiego, who previously performed the role of “Disseminator of Aircraft Researchand Information” in the espionage program. According to Tompkins, the spies,which numbered 29, travelled in to San Diego on a six monthly rotational basisto give debriefings to a small group comprising the head of the program, AdmiralBotta, three captains, a stenographer, and himself. Tompkins described how themeetings occurred: We had this little small office. He [Rico Botta] was commander of Naval AirStation, San Diego and so the admiral would be sitting here. I’m sitting next tohim and one of my three captain bosses sitting here. A typist was sitting at theother side of the table and the Navy operative — a Lieutenant Commander orLieutenant would sit over there. And he would lay out the information [with]some sketches, very few photographs, so it was almost all verbal, almost all.And if it was a system that we had already known about, other operatives fromthe information two years before, and it was an update of it, he would tietogether all of the other organizations that were tied with that specific part,of say the cigar shaped vehicles, what the weapons were, what the operationswere, the different companies underneath the ground, which were slave labororganizations.[31] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn31] With the utmost care and attention, Tompkins would listen to the spies’debriefings and subsequently create a detailed briefing packet, which he wouldpersonally carry to select US aerospace facilities using a private aircraftsupplied to him by Admiral Botta. Tompkins has explained more of this process inan interview: Figure 11. Tompkins with Four of His Typist Assistants[../images/00012.jpeg]… a Navy guy comes back from Germany, he tells us about this, we put thosepackages together. I had 10 or 12 girls, typists, put together the packages. Thepackage is not to do it, the package is to take it to Caltech and “you studyit.” Take the package to Lockheed, “what can you do with this?”[32][part0000_split_046.html#_edn32] He has also identified some of the Navy research facilities that the packageswere taken to: We took the data to every Navy Research organization. We took it to NavyDevelopment Center, Warminster, Pennsylvania. OK. That’s a big facility. I bet Iwent 20 times back there with stuff. The Caltech one, I didn’t even go toPasadena for that. I went to the Navy’s weapons system at China Lake becauseCaltech was working on other programs there. They would pull their scientistsoff, whatever that was, and throw these guys into a package, and run with theball…[33] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn33] In support of his claim, Tompkins has supplied copies of two separate passes hereceived to enter and leave the San Diego Naval Air Station with up to threepackages. These packages contained the alleged secret data provided by the Navyagents being distributed by Tompkins to select think tanks and corporations. Thetwo passes in the following image show Tompkins was permitted to carry one andthree (briefing) packets out of the Naval Air Station, respectively on April 17,1944 and December 24, 1943.In addition to the signature of the final authorizing officer, Admiral RicoBotta (bottom left) in itself is highly significant; close examination of theApril 1943 exit pass provides additional crucial corroborating information forTompkins’ story. In his book, Tompkins says that he was given access to thesmaller of two Figure 12. Tompkins' Two Exit Passes from Naval Air Station, San Diego[../images/00013.jpeg] planes that were at the disposal of Admiral Botta. Tompkins then explains thathe used the plane to take the briefing packages to different aerospacefacilities where the packages were used for research of extraterrestrial relatedtechnologies:Flew admiral’s plane to Douglas El Segundo, Lockheed Burbank and China Lake forfour years… 1943-1945. Spent much time at China Lake facility modifying rocketsfor testing (40 visits) and working on their alien projects.[34][part0000_split_046.html#_edn34]The exit pass (see Figure 13) says “four [for] issue of non-combat aircraft.”This corroborates his claim that he was authorized to expeditiously take thebriefing packages to a select number of aviation companies, think tanks anduniversity departments. The April 1944 exit pass authorizing Tompkins to carry apacket using a non-combat aircraft is highly significant in terms ofdemonstrating that he performed covert assignments as a “Disseminator ofAircraft Research and Information,” in addition to his official duties at theNaval Air Station. Figure 13. Analysis of April 17, 1944 Exit Pass[../images/00014.jpeg]The next document, issued just prior to his honorable discharge in 1946, showsTompkins completing a final work assignment during World War II as an AviationMachinist’s Mate Petty Officer 2nd Class (AMM2). Figure 14. Tompkins' Final Duty Before Honorable Discharge[../images/00015.jpeg] According to the Bureau of Naval Personnel Bulletin of May 1944, the officialduties of an Aviation Machinist’s Mate were: “Maintains and repairs aircraftengines, propellers, fuel systems, brakes, hydraulic system, gears, starters.Operates machine-shop tools.”[35] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn35] Carrying“packets” to unknown locations, and using non-combat aircraft to do so, isclearly well beyond the responsibilities of an Aviation Machinist’s Mate. Furthermore, Tompkins’ two exit passes display a signature which he statesbelonged to the commander of the Assembly and Repair Department, Naval AirStation, San Diego—Admiral Rico Botta. If it was indeed Botta that signed thetwo exit passes, this would help considerably in confirming Tompkins’ claims ofperforming covert missions in addition to his official duties. Botta’s signatureappears on a number of documents received from the National Archives under theFreedom of Information Act.[36] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn36] One documentshows a picture of Botta dating from 1934 when he was a Lieutenant Commander. Figure 15. Botta's Signature on 1934 Document[../images/00016.jpeg]The 1934 document contains a clear image of his signature which can be comparedto the signature on the two exit passes supplied by Tompkins. As the followinggraphic shows, and as document verification expert Dr. Robert Wood confirms, thesignatures look identical.[37] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn37] Figure 16. Comparison of Botta's Signatures[../images/00017.jpeg] The confirmation that it is indeed Botta’s signature which appears on the exitpasses is documentary evidence supporting Tompkins claim that he was performingduties as a disseminator of “Naval Aircraft Research and Development” asdescribed in his mission orders. In addition, Tompkins was allowed to fly anairplane in support of his mission.Botta is a crucial figure whose exceptional job performance was recognized inrunning the San Diego Naval Air Station and spy program. He was in charge offive thousand personnel performing maintenance, repair and upgrades for theNavy’s top combat aircraft at the start of World War II. By the end of the war,the Assembly and Repair Department had expanded to over ten thousand personnel.The Admiral’s exemplary technical knowledge and leadership at the vital SanDiego base led him to be awarded a Legion of Merit in 1945. Figure 17. Legion of Merit Awarded to Rico Botta[../images/00018.jpeg] It is no small fact to be missed that the distinguished commander, with suchvast responsibilities, is the one who signed Tompkins’ exit passes. A lesserranked superior would normally sign off on such minor documentation. ClearlyTompkins was operating within a position of key importance to the Admiral, andit placed him directly under Botta’s wing within the covert intelligenceprogram. "},{"pageContent":"ADMIRAL RICO BOTTA’S SPECIAL EXPERTISE & SECRET INTELLIGENCE ROLE It is critical to connect Botta to the retrieval of craft from the Los AngelesAir Raid incident, and uncover the reason why he was chosen to head thedebriefings of covert Naval personal reporting on secret Nazi activities. Thenext FOIA document (see Figure 18) reveals that on February 25, 1942, the day ofthe Los Angeles Air Raid, Botta was ordered to travel from the Navy’s Bureau ofAeronautics, in Washington DC, to Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio. At the time,Wright Field was the location for both the Army Air Force and Navy’s study offoreign and experimental aircraft. It was the place where either or both Army G2and the Office of Naval Intelligence would have transferred the craft retrievedfrom the night of February 24/25.The experimental aircraft facilities at Wright Field was the very same locationthat the craft, later retrieved from the July 1947 Roswell UFO incident, wouldbe taken according to multiple documents and whistleblowers. An official FBIteletype, dated July 8, 1947, confirms that UFO debris from the Roswell incidentwas indeed immediately taken to Wright Field after its discovery, despite theArmy Air Force’s misleading claim that it was a mistaken weather balloon (seeFigure 19):EIGHT AIR FORCE, TELEPHONICALLY ADVISED THIS OFFCE THAN AN OBJECT PURPORTING TOBE A FLYING DISC WAS RECOVERED NEAR ROSWEL, NEW MEXICO….

They wrote:Outside of the UFO community, few are aware of Wright-Patterson’s distinction ofmaintaining the U.S. government’s official investigation of the UFO phenomenonfrom 1947 until 1969. With its vital experience of testing andreverse-engineering all materials both foreign and “from space,” it is ahistoric fact that whatever crashed outside of Roswell fell under their purview.It is also a documented fact that the “debris” from New Mexico was sent toWright Field...[39] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn39]The February 25, 1942 document confirms that on the day the Army Air Forcecaptured and began the process of shipping the captured Los Angeles flyingsaucer craft to Wright Field, Botta received his orders to travel there. Hearrived on March 2, and stayed for at least two days examining the captured LosAngeles UFO craft on behalf of the Navy’s Bureau of Aeronautics.The significance of the document cannot be underestimated since it reveals thatBotta was identified by the Navy’s leading engineering division, the Bureau ofAeronautics, as their representative for investigating the power systems ofretrieved antigravity craft. At the time, Botta, then a Commander, headed theBureau’s Power Plant Design Branch. His technical expertise and knowledge ofmassive power systems was well known to his Bureau superiors. After the War, hereceived a Citation for his exemplary service as the head of this Branch, as thefollowing February 18, 1946 document shows. Figure 20. Botta's Citation for Exemplary Work in Navy Power Plant DesignBranch[../images/00021.jpeg]Yet, another FOIA document (see Figure 21) shows that on October 1, 1942, onemonth before he was assigned to Naval Air Station, San Diego, the now CaptainBotta, still stationed at the Bureau of Aeronautics, visited five top West Coastresearch facilities working on experimental aircraft. This FOIA document, issuedon September 30, 1942, confirms that Botta was directly involved in the study ofexperimental aircraft, and that this was connected to his impending reassignmentto one of these facilities, Naval Air Station, San Diego, in December 1942. Of special significance is the reference to the Douglas Aircraft Company, whichaccording to Tompkins was heavily involved with the Navy and Army Air Force instudying the feasibility of antigravity research and development. He says thiscooperation led to an informal working group comprising: three Douglasengineers, two generals and two admirals to create a plan for what to do withthe UFO craft retrieved from the 1942 Los Angeles Air Raid. The working groupculminated in the launch of Project RAND out of the Douglas Headquarters inSanta Monica, California, in October 1945. I will examine Tompkins’ claimsregarding Project RAND in the next chapter.Finally, the above travel authorization document demonstrates that Botta had thebackground and experience to direct Tompkins to different experimental aircraftfacilities to deliver briefing packets in a covert intelligence program which hedirected. Regarding the reference to Botta’s rank as Captain in the September30, 1942 FOIA document (see Figure 22), US Senate records available onlineconfirm that in 1946, Botta had been retroactively promoted to Rear Admiral asof June 1943, based on his war time responsibilities.[40][part0000_split_046.html#_edn40] FOIA documents provide additional information,such as the following document signed by Botta where he accepted his retroactivepromotion.This confirms that at least seven months after he began his new assignmentrunning the Repair and Maintenance facility at the Figure 21. Experimental Aircraft Facilities Visited by Rico Botta in Oct 1942[../images/00022.jpeg] Figure 22. Rico Botta's Acceptance of Retroactive Promotion to Rear Admiral[../images/00023.jpeg] Naval Air Station in late December 1942, Botta was given a temporary wartimepromotion to Rear Admiral. Due to the contingencies of the war which rapidlyexpanded the number of flag officer positions, the normal official promotionprocess was suspended in many cases. Botta is among a list of 58 Navy FlagOfficers who had to wait until after the completion of the war for the officialprocess to resume, and receive retroactive commissions reflecting their wartimeranks.[41] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn41] FOIA documents further confirm thatBotta retired in December 1952 with the rank of Rear Admiral Upper Class (a twostar admiral) after completing his final assignment as the head of the Naval AirMaterial Center in Philadelphia.Analysis of the previously shown documents corroborate Tompkins’ claim that hewas indeed acting as a courier (“Disseminator for Aircraft Research andInformation”) for a covert Naval Intelligence program with up to 29 spies inGerman occupied Europe during World War II. This leads to the question: What didTompkins learn and what information was he carrying in the briefing packets totop US research and development facilities studying experimental aircraft? "},{"pageContent":"NAZI GERMANY’S ANTIGRAVITY PROGRAMS & EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALLIANCES What the naval operatives were reporting during their nighttime debriefings wascompletely unexpected, even astounding according to Tompkins. Admiral Botta andthe three Navy captains could hardly believe what they were hearing. Tompkinssays the operatives discovered that up to and during the World War II, therewere two independent flying saucer programs under development in Nazi Germany.The first was largely a civilian effort that predated the Nazi rise to power in1933, while the second was led by the Nazi SS.Tompkins said that the civilian German space program had been inspired by aNordic group of extraterrestrials, who were communicating through young femaleGerman mediums. In an interview, Tompkins confirmed that the leader of thisgroup was Maria Orsic.[42] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn42] A stunning physicallikeness between her and one of the Nordic aliens Tompkins says he met whileworking at Douglas Aircraft Company will be discussed in chapter four.Similarly, Corey Goode says that when a photo of Maria Orsic was allegedly shownto the Swiss contactee, Billy Meier, he identified her as “Semjase,” thePleadian/Plejaran/Nordic extraterrestrial who was meeting with him. In aFebruary 19, 2016 lecture, Goode said: … when the military found out about Meier's case, they sent people over withsome photographs for him to try and identify the female being he saw. He quicklypointed out one photograph, saying, \"That's her! That's her!\" Apparently thephoto he pointed out was of Maria Orsic, the medium from the Vril Society, whowas making contact with inner-Earth groups, and who played an intimate role inthe pre and post World War II German secret space program.[43][part0000_split_046.html#_edn43] Orsic was allegedly sharing ideas and theories with leading inventors such asNikola Tesla and Guglielmo Marconi. As mentioned earlier, Marconi headed theItalian Flying Saucer study group formed by Mussolini in 1933. Due to hisassociation with Orsic, Marconi became aware of how advanced the civilian runGerman Secret Space program had become. After passing on some of thisinformation to Mussolini, who was likely influenced by it to form an alliancewith Hitler, Marconi decided to fake his death and disappear to South America toset up a civilian flying saucer program.[44] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn44]Tompkins went on to explain that there were many inspired by Orsic’sinformation, and/or the alleged Aldebaran extraterrestrials she was working within the 1920’s and 1930’s. The goal was to build vehicles capable of deep spaceflight using principles of teleportation, and to even travel to the Aldebaranstar system.He said that there were a staggering 1,442 individuals from all walks of lifedevoting resources to what could be likened to a modern day Noah’s Ark to escapeanother prophesied World War:Figure 23. Maria Orsic Photo which Meier Allegedly Saw and Claimed was Semjase[../images/00024.jpeg]Some of those people in the 1,442 were scientists and engineers in Germany, andsome were shoe salesman. They all wanted to build a space ship. They borrowedmoney, took out loans on the farm, and were in debt up to their necks [as] theywere trying to [buy] materials to build their spaceship. It was like theythought they could simply load their families and friends into their ship andfly off to some distant star.[45] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn45]It may sound implausible that ordinary civilians could build vehicles, capableof deep space flight using teleportation principles, without significantassistance by national governments. However, in the early 1960’s, Otis Carr, aprotégé of Nikola Tesla, developed a flying saucer craft that used teleportationprinciples. Carr’s goal was to also kickstart a civilian spacecraft industry.Unfortunately for Carr and his supporters, his civilian space program wasterminated by government authorities who confiscated Carr’s prototypespacecraft, the OTC-X1, and jailed him on concocted securities fraud.[46][part0000_split_046.html#_edn46] Figure 24. Otis Carr's OTC-X1 in 1961[../images/00025.jpeg] The second flying saucer program in Nazi Germany was under the control ofHimmler’s SS, who were attempting to weaponize the program for the war effort.According to Tompkins, the spies reported that the Nazi’s effort to win the warthrough weaponizing flying saucer technologies was being assisted by anothergroup of extraterrestrials, called the Reptilians. This dangerous and conquestoriented faction had reached secret agreements with Hitler:The Navy agents (spies) in Germany discovered what all those “out of this world”aliens gave Hitler: UFOs, antigravity propulsion, beam weapons, extended lifeand plenty of mind-controlled willing girls programs. The Reptilians made a dealwith the Third Reich SS giving them this big box full of toys in exchange forletting Hitler enslave the rest of the planet.[47][part0000_split_046.html#_edn47]Tompkins has further exposed how “Reptilian consultants” were helping the NaziSS develop advanced weapons technologies:They had, if you want to call them, “consultants”, who are Reptilian consultantsassisting on all of these different things that it takes to design and buildthese spacecraft carriers, and propulsion systems. So this is an extremely welldeveloped program and documented like crazy. Getting copies of the documents washard for them, hard for our spies. This was an open program in the upper levelof the SS.[48] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn48]The spies learned that the goal of the Reptilian plan was not only to assist theNazis to win the war and achieve planetary conquest, but to build fleets ofantigravity spacecraft carriers that could be used for interplanetary conquestin other star systems:Holy cats the thing went way beyond that [world conquest]. Again, what we justsaid about this was the tip of the iceberg of what they were doing. AlreadyReptilians were doing it to other stars’ planets all over this area of theGalaxy…. These young kids, the operatives, they couldn’t believe half of whatthey brought back, what was going on. But some of them were really good people,and they knew how to get into places and listen to what’s going on, and findingwhat that guy he had talked to, or he heard, and going to so and so, because yesthey were doing that over there. [49] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn49]Tompkins’ information is startling, but it is not the first time claims havebeen made about Nazi Germany receiving extraterrestrial help during the War. Thefather of German rocket science, Herman Oberth, said the following in responseto a question about Nazi Germany’s rapid technological development:“We cannot take credit for our record advancement in certain scientific fieldsalone. We have been helped.” When asked by whom, he replied, “the peoples ofother worlds.”[50] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn50]In 1998, Linda Moulton Howe interviewed a former CIA agent (using the aliasesKewper and Stein), who from 1957 to 1960 was given access to highly classifiedbriefing files. He said that the documents revealed that the Nazis had indeedbeen helped by an extraterrestrial race in their advanced aeronautical weaponsprojects:When Vril was building that first craft, the Vril had one or two of the aliensthat worked with them in Germany where they fired rockets from Peenemunde. Thedocuments I read in Washington said that’s where the first Vrilvehicle wasmade…. They [aliens] were helpers to Germany. [51][part0000_split_046.html#_edn51] More recently, another whistleblower, Corey Goode, says that from 1987 to 2007,he read intelligence briefings on smart-glass pads that detailed what hadhappened during World War II. Goode’s claims concerning multiple “Secret SpacePrograms” he served on were extensively examined in my 2015 book, InsidersReveal Secret Space Programs and Extraterrestrial Alliances, and found to beconsistent with many historical documents, circumstantial evidence, and otherwhistleblower testimonies.Goode described how German Secret Societies were helped, before and throughoutWorld War II, by two different extraterrestrial groups. He identified one as aReptilian-like race called the “Draconians” and the other as Nordics:The Germans were in contact and working hard alongside the Reptilians … butthere were Nordic groups involved as well that different elements of the GermanSpace Program were in contact with. [52] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn52]Both the Reptilians and Nordics were involved in assisting the Germans in thedevelopment of advanced antigravity spacecraft:At the same time these [German Secret] Societies had made contact with the DracoFederation and another group [Nordics] that avoided the Draco’s. The GermanOccultists were very busy from the early 1900’s, especially the time justbefore, during and after World War One. Their major breakthroughs occurred inthe late 1930’s.[53] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn53]Goode said that the ultimate goal of the Reptilians, in helping German SecretSocieties and the Nazi SS, was to create advanced space carrier battle groupsthat would be capable of interplanetary conquest. The eventual German/Nazi spacebattle groups became what Goode described as the “Dark Fleet.” It operatesoutside of our solar system, and is discussed at length in the book, InsidersReveal Secret Space Programs and Extraterrestrial Alliances.[54][part0000_split_046.html#_edn54]Consequently, the whistleblower testimonies by the CIA Agent and Corey Goodesupport Tompkins’ claims that intelligence briefing files, dating from World WarII, did indeed refer to Nazi Germany being assisted by extraterrestrials—twoalien groups with very different agendas. The Nordics, or Aldebarans, had theobjective to help Germany develop both technologically and spiritually for spaceexploration. They worked largely with private citizens/groups such as Orsic andthe Vril Society, which Hitler allowed to continue once he came into power. Inregard to this Tompkins commented in an interview: Germany found out about the blonde [Orsic], took her over, stopped everything,and then got to this point where there was some sort of pressurized program bythe SS to control that original group. Now, several times they did worktogether, but Hitler allowed them to operate independently of the whole SSprogram – the whole development. So we had two developments going on in Germany.The girls didn't want their vehicles to be used for anything else but travel.They were afraid that somebody would get a hold of it and they'd use it formilitary, which is, of course, what they got.[55][part0000_split_046.html#_edn55] The Reptilians, on the other hand, had no ethical or spiritual program theywished to encourage among the Germans or on behalf of humanity, and workedprimarily with the Nazi government to develop spacecraft which were essentiallybuilt to become weapons of war. The ultimate goal of the German-Reptilianalliance went far beyond winning World War II and mere planetary conquest, whichTompkins attests the US Navy had alarmingly learned from its spies.Tompkins further says that in 1939, the Nazi SS was given the location of twolarge caverns in Antarctica by the Reptilians, and proceeded to move the bulk ofthe German secret space programs there over time. By August 1944, when it becameclear that the war was lost after the successful Allied landing in Normandy, theNazi’s accelerated their efforts to relocate the best scientists, engineers andvital resources to Antarctica, and alternate Argentinian caverns, throughspecially built submarines capable of carrying very large cargoes. According to Tompkins, the US Navy learned of the existence of these secretAntarctic bases directly from their spies embedded within Nazi Germany, whofound that the Nazis/Germans used these remote bases to launch the first spacemissions by modern humanity. Elaborating on this, Tompkins says that the Germansbegan moving equipment and supplies to Antarctica as early as 1913. Thiscoincides historically with the Second German Antarctic Expedition from1911-1913 led by Wilhelm Filchner.[56] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn56] Thisperiod also corresponds with the increasing role of German secret societies inexploring remote global locations for occult knowledge. Significantly, Filchnerlater led Nazi expeditions to Nepal and Tibet. The movement of equipment toAntarctica accelerated in the lead up to World War II, as Tompkins highlights:“The move from Germany to Antarctica was in operation from … [1938] way beforethe war started. In fact some of the stuff went down in 1913.”[57][part0000_split_046.html#_edn57]Navy spies, who Tompkins heard candidly in debriefings, had learned about secretagreements which had been reached between Hitler’s regime and DraconianReptilians. Tompkins has revealed some of the major elements of this agreementand how it concerned Antarctica:Large portions of equipment were sent down there. But right next to them werethree tremendous size caverns which the Reptilians had. Not Grays, butReptilians. Germany got two more, about a tenth the size of the big Reptilians[cavern]. They were able to … [go] down, usually by submarine. They built theseflat submarines, these regular class, so they could ship all this stuffdown.[58] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn58]Tompkins’ remarkable information is consistent with Grand Admiral Karl Donitz,who referred on three occasions to an impregnable fortress being built forHitler in a remote location using Germany’s advanced submarine fleet. In 1943,Donitz is reported to have stated: “the German submarine fleet is proud ofhaving built for the Führer, in another part of the world, a Shangri-La on land,an impregnable fortress.”[59] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn59]The second occasion was in 1944, when he revealed how plans were in place torelocate Hitler so he could launch a new effort for his thousand-year Reich:The German Navy will have to accomplish a great task in the future. The GermanNavy knows all hiding places in the oceans and therefore it will be very easy tobring the Führer to a safe place should the necessity arise and in which he willhave the opportunity to work out his final plans.[60][part0000_split_046.html#_edn60]Finally, Donitz’s remarks at his Nuremberg war crime trial clearly suggest thatit was Antarctica where Germany’s most advanced technologies had been secretlyrelocated by his submarine fleet. At the trial he boasted of “an invulnerablefortress, a paradise-like oasis in the middle of eternal ice.” [61][part0000_split_046.html#_edn61] Donitz’s remarks were made plausible in 1966 by cartographer and artist for theNational Geographic Society, Heinrich C. Berann. In Berann’s depiction of anice-free Antarctica, he shows underwater passageways that run throughout theAntarctic continent.[62] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn62] This provided aplausible way in which submarines could travel under the ice for considerabledistances to Nazi Germany’s “invulnerable fortress.” Figure 25. Illustration of Ice Free Antarctica by Heinrich Berann[../images/00026.jpeg] Donitz’s claims are further supported by documents provided by an alleged Germansubmarine crewman after the war, which described the instructions for U-BoatCaptains to reach the Antarctica bases through the hidden passageways. Figure 26displays an image of the document with the translated instructions. [63][part0000_split_046.html#_edn63]Tompkins describes simultaneous flying saucer programs that had been developedby the Nazis. One was in Nazi Occupied Europe, while the second was inAntarctica. In his response to a question about where Germany’s antigravitycraft were being built, he said: Figure 26. Directions to Antarctic Bases[../images/00027.jpeg]They built the prototypes in Germany. They built pre-prototype, something whichis ready for production, in Antarctica. They put this stuff in production in thecountries all over Germany [Occupied Europe], and they continued to buildsimilar vehicles in Antarctica.[64] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn64]Next comes one of the most astonishing secrets gained by the Navy spies embeddedin Germany. Tompkins shares that with the help of the Reptilians, the Nazi’sAntarctica program had successfully launched manned missions to the Moon,planets, and even other star systems.Now the question was asked whether did we ever get to the Moon? You see it wasin some way, it was well known that the Germans had a number of vehicles thatflew out and came back. One of the first ones, they got into trouble, theycrashed and the whole group died. But that was almost all coming fromAntarctica. Way before, four years before, the war ended, they were alwaysmoving all of this stuff out. And so the flights, almost everything came fromAntarctica with the same people. … I don’t know if it was true or not, but itwas stated by some of those fellows [Navy spies] that they had gone to otherstars and come back. [65] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn65]Furthermore, Tompkins heard from the Naval operatives that the Germans had alsoachieved the first space flight to Mars in late April 1945, which had a crew of30, including three Japanese astronauts. This stunning achievement ended indisaster when the spacecraft crash-landed, resulting in the death of the entirecrew.Tompkins remarkable claims again corroborate the testimony of secret spaceprogram whistleblower, Corey Goode, who says that the “smart glass pads” he hadaccess to described the successful Nazi space program that operated out ofAntarctica. Goode stated, however, that the Antarctica program was controlled byGerman secret societies rather than the Nazi SS:As explained, the Nazi remnants that were made up mostly of Secret Societiesthat created a “Break Away Civilization,” kept the most advanced technologysecret from even their highest Military and Political leaders, setup enclaves inSouth America and Antarctica. The locations in Antarctica were some ancientcivilization ruins that had remained occupied by certain groups in thermal areasthat cause areas similar to lava tubes and domes under the glaciers.[66][part0000_split_046.html#_edn66]Goode goes on to corroborate Tompkins’ claim that the Nazi bases were builtadjacent to caverns controlled by another advanced civilization, the Reptilians:There was an underground and under glacier city complex that was alreadyoccupied and setup in a couple of locations and the NAZI’s renovated an areathat was mostly crushed above the surface but had plenty of room under the domedice, thermal underground energy and caverns (accessible via U-boat under the iceflows and openings that made it ideal for a hidden multipurpose base) that wereperfect for them to secretly build out during the entire Second World War.[67][part0000_split_046.html#_edn67]Statements by Admiral Donitz support Tompkins’ claims that Nazi Germany hadsucceeded in locating and building underground facilities under the Antarcticcontinent. The long route under the Antarctic ice sheets, which the Germansubmarine fleet allegedly took to reach these hidden caverns, gives credence toTompkins’ testimony that Reptilian extraterrestrials had provided the Nazis withthe information necessary to locate the hidden Antarctic caverns, and theunder-ice passageways to reach them.What the Navy spies were revealing to Admiral Botta, and his subordinates, whichincluded Tompkins at the Naval Air Station from 1942 to 1946, was astonishing.The information made it even more urgent that what was retrieved by the Navy andArmy from the Los Angeles Air Raid be investigated for its potential warapplications, as well as bringing all captured Nazi prototypes from liberatedEurope to the US for further study:At the end of World War II, Naval Intelligence operators (spies) penetratedvirtually every German secret weapons, advance system, rockets, aircraft, UFO’sand heavy water [projects] in the country. They located the individuals in thesefacilities, and they were tagged. When the hostilities ceased, the NavalIntelligence and additional intelligence officers went straight into theselocations and removed not only the research scientists, but their documentation,and as much of the weapons system as they could. They were all brought to theUnited States in what was called Project Paperclip.[68][part0000_split_046.html#_edn68]The twin imperatives of learning about extraterrestrial and Nazi flying saucertechnologies led to an informal working group, initiated by Donald Douglas,founder of the Douglas Aircraft Company, evolving into Project RAND by the endof World War II. "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3PROJECT RAND & THE FUTURE OF NON-TERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES Leaked “Majestic Documents” reveal that President Roosevelt, following theadvice of military officials, decided that the advanced science behind therecovered antigravity craft from the Los Angeles Air Raid would be toochallenging to reverse engineer in a timeframe suited to the war effort. In a1944 memorandum to his science advisor, Dr. Vannevar Bush, Roosevelt firmlyruled out a research and development program of “non-terrestrial” technologiesbased on antigravity principles. Expense was the issue and it would impact onthe development of more conventional military weapons such as the atomic bomb.In this Top Secret memorandum, Roosevelt wrote: Various points have been raised about the difficulties such an endeavor wouldpose to the already hardened research for advanced weapons programs and supportgroups in our war effort and I agree that now is not the time. It is my personaljudgment that, when the war is won, and peace is once again restored, there willcome a time when surplus funds may be available to pursue a program devoted tounderstanding non-terrestrial science and its technology which is still greatlyundiscovered.[69] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn69] Yet, Roosevelt went on to postulate that the US would eventually play a leadingrole in developing the incredible technologies that had fallen into their hands. Figure 27. Top Secret Document Signed by President Roosevelt[../images/00028.jpeg] Consequently, only after the war would significant scientific resources finallybe devoted to research and development of the recovered antigravity craft. Inthe meantime, the US military would gather as much intelligence as possible onwhat the Axis Powers were doing in this arena, and endeavor to further retrieveany craft of non-terrestrial origin that came their way.During this interim, at least three things were done to gain necessaryintelligence data in preparation for the time when the US government and itsmilitary could channel significant resources into developing a comprehensivescientific plan for the flying saucer phenomenon. First, the Army Air Force,through the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, would gather as much intelligence asit could on antigravity vehicles, and relocate any craft that came into USmilitary possession, or that of its allies, to the United States.Second, the Navy, through its covert operatives in Nazi Occupied Europe, wouldgather data secretly on what the Nazis were doing in their research anddevelopment of flying saucer technologies. And third, preliminary studies wouldbe conducted by an informal study group capable of fully appreciating themilitary and scientific potential of what had been acquired from the Los AngelesAir Raid, along with the intelligence provided by both the Army Air Force andthe Navy. The informal study group would use the right people and protocols toprepare for the future when funding and personnel became available for acomprehensive reverse engineering program of the captured flying saucers and thedata retrieved from Nazi Germany. William Tompkins has disclosed key informationabout this informal study group.Shortly after the 1942 Los Angeles Air Raid incident, Tompkins says thePresident of Douglas Aircraft Company, Donald Douglas Sr., along with his chiefengineer, Arthur Raymond, and his assistant, Franklin Colbohm, convened aninformal working group that included two Army Air Force Generals and two Navyadmirals. The goal was to investigate the scientific principles and research theimplications of the two retrieved UFO craft.[70][part0000_split_046.html#_edn70]The Douglas Aircraft Corporation was headquartered in Santa Monica, so it isnatural to assume that senior Douglas personnel would have witnessed the LosAngeles event. An immediate investigation began, which is certainly whatTompkins contends in his autobiography, where he wrote: Frank Collbohm – under the direction of Arthur Raymond and Donald Douglas – hasbeen secretly investigating the strange flight of vehicles over Santa Monica andLos Angeles since 1942.[71] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn71] In addition, Tompkins described the powerful influence the Los Angeles incidenthad on Donald Douglas and other key individuals who directly participated in orbecame aware of the informal working group, which came to be known in-house asAdvanced Design. This group would ultimately lead to the formal establishment ofProject RAND in October 1945: There were several people in the Navy Department, Army Air Corps, and anaircraft company whose entire lives were impacted. They were Admiral Roscoe H.Hillenkoetter, Secretary of the Navy, James V. Forrestal, Army Air Corps GeneralNathan F. Twining and General Curtis Le May, Edward Bowles of M.I.T., DrVannevar Bush and Donald Douglas, Sr., to name a few.[72][part0000_split_046.html#_edn72] Douglas Aircraft Company was among the leading manufacturers of aircraft forboth the US Navy and the US Army Air Force at the beginning of World War II. By1945, Douglas produced nearly 30,000 aircraft for the successful war effort, andits engineers and production facilities were world-renowned. Tompkins was veryfamiliar with the operations and history of Douglas Aircraft Company, due bothto his employment in its engineering division from 1950 to 1963, and alsobecause of his visits to Douglas when working under Rear Admiral Rico Botta outof the San Diego Naval Air Station from 1942 to 1946.Consequently, it is very plausible that Donald Douglas Sr. would have contactedsenior officers in both the Army and Navy in early 1942, to form an informalworking group to discuss the Los Angeles UFO incident, and its implications forthe aeronautical industry. After all, Douglas Aircraft Company was ramping upaircraft production for both the Army Air Force and Navy for the war effort, andit behooved everyone to learn as much as possible about the UFOs involved in theLos Angeles incident.In the immediate months after the Air Raid took place, intelligence data aboutthe Nazi research and development programs began to accumulate at Naval AirStation, San Diego, and was made known to Douglas Aircraft Company according toTompkins. In the previous chapter, a document was presented showing AdmiralBotta traveling to Douglas Aircraft Company in October 1942 to discussexperimental aircraft issues. This was likely the first time Douglas would havebeen told about the Navy’s gathering of intelligence on the Nazi programs.After beginning his covert assignment under Botta, Tompkins says that from theSpring of 1943 onward, he travelled at least three times to Douglas AircraftCompany with the briefing packets containing the latest information about theNazi programs. I had been flying up to Douglas, from Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego,since spring 1943. I was staff to Admiral [Rico Botta], Commander, NavalIntelligence. I had his high wing DH-2 aircraft assigned to me as needed forthese and other local, western [U.S.A.] missions…. visited classified DouglasSanta Monica and Cal Tech facilities, 3 to 4 times each. [73][part0000_split_046.html#_edn73] Tompkins named both Arthur Raymond and Franklin Colbohm as being directlyinvolved in the study of the briefing packets delivered to Douglas AircraftCompany. In an interview, Tompkins recalls that one of the Douglas engineers hespoke to about the briefing packets may have been Colbohm, who later became thefirst President of the Rand Corporation.[74] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn74]Consequently, Tompkins’ claim that the genesis of this informal working group,established by Donald Douglas, would lead three years later to the formalestablishment of Project RAND in October 1945, is supported by historicalevents.Tompkins described the formation and purpose of Project RAND and its connectionto a top secret think tank in the engineering division of Douglas as follows: The Douglas/RAND scientists and concept conceivers were studying topics actuallyway above top secret. They were in a Think Tank deep inside the Douglas AircraftCompany’s Engineering Department A-250, that nobody knew existed at the SantaMonica, California Airport.[75] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn75] He identified some of the key people involved in the Project RAND/Douglasinitiative: Under the direction of James Forrestal, who was the Secretary of the Navy, onOctober 1, 1945, several high-ranking big shots were brought on board, includingGeneral Hap Arnold, Edward Bowles (of M.I.T.) and a consultant to the Secretaryof the War, Donald Douglas … They met in secret at the Army Air Corps [Force]Headquarters, Hamilton Field, California to set up Project RAND, away-above-top-secret scientific think tank. It was created in … [October] 1945,as a special contract to Douglas Aircraft Company. At the Santa Monica MunicipalAirport. Inside a highly classified walled-off area in the Douglas EngineeringDepartment, Project RAND studied the implications of threating alien agendas….Then, on March 2, 1945, a letter of contract was executed, which put ProjectRAND under the direction of Douglas’s Assistant Chief Engineer, Frank Collbohm.The Douglas Think Tank was born. [emphasis added][76][part0000_split_046.html#_edn76] Tompkins emphasized the exclusive role given to the Douglas campaign at the endof the war in establishing the first US think tank set up to focus on flyingsaucer craft, and the possible threat posed by extraterrestrial visitors asstarkly exemplified by the 1942 Los Angeles Air Raid incident: Unknown to most of us in 1945, the Douglas Aircraft Company was “sole-sourceselected.” It was given an above top secret RAND contract to study and locatemilitary satellites in earth orbit (unofficially, alien threats). The AdvancedDesign Section in Engineering was extensively expanded to accommodate themassive problem. The first galactic Think Tank on this planet was formed. [77][part0000_split_046.html#_edn77] Further, Tompkins explained how the Project RAND contract gave Douglas employeesaccess to the technical information possessed by all other US research anddevelopment programs that were relevant to flying saucer technology andextraterrestrial life: This contact provided almost complete access to, and support from, nearly all ofthe technical individuals and organizations in the U.S…. This RAND contactthrust Douglas into fantastic, technical programs. They defined the alienthreats, and researched every possible method and technical task for the peopleinvolved in Naval defense and offensive missions. They were methods designed toconceive Naval space missions and battle groups, and to design spacevehicles/spacecraft carriers and weapons to combat the alien battle groups. Itwas to be supported technically North American Aviation, Inc, Northrup AircraftCompany, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, SRI, MIT andCaltech. What we knew was dwarfed by all we had to learn. [78][part0000_split_046.html#_edn78] A document that directly supports Tompkins’ claim that Project RAND wasprimarily set up to study the flying saucer phenomenon, and collaborated withother leading US scientific organizations conducting advanced aerospace researchin doing so, is one of the leaked “Majestic documents.” The “White Hot Report”lists Project RAND among the research organizations studying artifacts recoveredfrom the crash of extraterrestrial vehicles: Based on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currentlyunder study by AMC, AFSWP, NEPA, ABC, NACA, JRDB, RAND, USAAF, SAG and MIT, aredeemed extraterrestrial in nature. [emphasis added][79][part0000_split_046.html#_edn79] Significantly, the leaked “White Hot Report” received the highest level ofauthenticity from the independent investigation by veteran document researchers,Dr. Robert Wood and Ryan Wood.[80] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn80] Figure 28. Leaked \"White Hot Report\" Dated Sept 19, 1947. Source: MajesticDocuments[../images/00029.jpeg] Consequently, the “White Hot Report” document is independent confirmation thatthe Douglas Aviation Company, through Project RAND, was involved in the study ofretrieved alien spacecraft, just as Tompkins claimed. This also supports anothercore element of Tompkins’ testimony regarding him joining a secret engineeringdivision think tank in Douglas in 1951, which did feasibility studies ondifferent antigravity spacecraft for the Navy.Tompkins told the following about the secrecy surrounding Project RAND: “Theyhad the highest, secret clearance even above the nuclear bomb.” [81][part0000_split_046.html#_edn81] His statement about the extraordinary level ofsecurity given to Project RAND is supported by a document written by a seniorradio engineer with the Canadian Department of Transportation. Dated November21, 1951, Wilbert Smith wrote to the Controller of Telecommunications concerningflying saucer technologies being secretly studied in the US at the time: “Thematter is the most highly classified subject in the United States government,rating higher than the H-bomb.”[82] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn82] A November1965 article in The Progressive, by journalist Wesley Marx, further corroboratesTompkins’ claim about the extraordinary security procedures set in place by theDouglas Company for Project RAND: Douglas furnished administrative services, security guards, and locked rooms inits Santa Monica, California, facility, and RAND became a subsidiary, butvirtually autonomous, division of Douglas.[83] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn83] In addition to Donald Douglas, another one of the founders of Project RAND wasthe Commanding General of the Army Air Force, Henry H. “Hap” Arnold. He wrote areport to General Marshall, the Army Chief of Staff, stating: During this war the Army, Army Air Forces, and the Navy have made unprecedenteduse of scientific and industrial resources. The conclusion is inescapable thatwe have not yet established the balance necessary to insure the continuance ofteamwork among the military, other government agencies, industry, and theuniversities. Scientific planning must be years in advance of the actualresearch and development work.[84] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn84] Project RAND was set up to provide a think tank to help the military servicesdevelop the necessary strategic scientific planning that would be essential forthe eventual research and development of advanced aerospace technologies,especially those using antigravity and other exotic propulsion systems. This wasvitally influential to developing long term plans when it came to UFOs that wereeither of interplanetary origin, or linked to Nazi advanced technology projects.Significantly, Arnold was also a key figure in the creation of theInterplanetary Phenomenon Unit set up to deal with UFO crashes soon after theLos Angeles incident. At the time, Arnold was the Commanding General of thenewly created Army Air Force, which had been formed only eight months earlier inJune 1941, and unified the two previously separate entities, Army Air Corps andGeneral Headquarters Air Force. As the Commanding General of the Army Air Force,Arnold would have had to provide personnel with the necessary technicalexpertise for the secretive Army intelligence unit specially created toinvestigate reports of aircraft crashes that involved interplanetary UFOs orother forms of advanced aerial technologies.Arnold’s involvement establishes an important connection between the formationof Project RAND and the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit. This supports Tompkins’claim that Project RAND emerged out of an informal study group to examine theLos Angeles UFO incident in 1942, and that from the beginning RAND’s secretmission has been to help develop a long term coordinated policy on the UFOphenomenon and extraterrestrial life.In his November 1965 article, Marx described how Arnold raised money for ProjectRAND, bypassing Congress and the conventional bidding process altogether: Without Congressional authorization and without taking bids, Air Force GeneralH.H. “Hap” Arnold managed to shift around enough funds to award a $10 millioncontract to Douglas Aircraft Company to set up Project RAND.[85][part0000_split_046.html#_edn85] Ten million dollars, in 1945 terms, converts to as much as 790 million dollarsin 2016 terms.[86] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn86] At the time, this was anenormous amount of money to give to an aviation company to conduct research,without taking bids from competitors. Arnold’s decision shows that at that keytime, he believed that the Douglas Company was well ahead of its main rivals,Lockheed, Boeing and Northrup, when it came to research and development ofadvanced aviation technologies.Arnold’s choice of the Douglas Company for funding Project RAND in 1945 supportsTompkins’ claim that an informal study group had been formed at Douglas in 1942,after the Los Angeles Air Raid incident. By 1945, Douglas had become the obviousprivate entity to develop a long term coordinated plan between the government,military and private sector when it came to the study of flying saucer andantigravity technologies.In addition to General Arnold, the RAND website identifies others involved insetting up the RAND Project: Other key players involved in the formation of this new, private organizationwere Major General Curtis LeMay; General Lauris Norstad, Assistant Chief of AirStaff, Plans; Edward Bowles of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,consultant to the Secretary of War; Donald Douglas, president of the DouglasAircraft Company; Arthur Raymond, chief engineer at Douglas; and FranklinCollbohm, Raymond’s assistant. The name of the organization? Project RAND.[87][part0000_split_046.html#_edn87] The historical overview found in the website of the RAND Corporation, thesuccessor to Project RAND, is notable since it confirms the leading role of theDouglas Aircraft Company in supporting the US military in helping to develop thenecessary scientific plans for researching and developing advanced aerospacetechnologies. The expertise of Douglas’ scientists and engineers wasunparalleled at the time.While the RAND Corporation website corroborates Tompkins’ claims of leading ArmyAir Force generals and Douglas Aircraft Company engineers being involved in theformation of Project RAND, there is no mention of the Navy or of SecretaryForrestal’s involvement. Why?Funding for Project RAND was provided by the Army Air Force, through GeneralArnold, as noted earlier. The RAND contract came to be managed by the newlycreated Army position of “Deputy Chief of Air Staff for Research andDevelopment,” who in October 1945 was General Curtis LeMay—also an acknowledgedco-founder of Project RAND. LeMay was in charge of the Army Air Force researchfacilities at Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, which had received the retrievedflying saucer craft from the Los Angeles Air Raid incident. Wright Field wouldalso receive other craft retrieved by the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit,including the July 1947 Roswell crash, and also Nazi antigravity craft broughtto the United States under Operation Paperclip.The fact that only Army Air Force officials would be acknowledged, by officialRAND historians, in its establishment was a reflection of the principal funderbeing the Army. It is also due to the Navy’s downplaying of its wartime interestin flying saucer and antigravity research, as exemplified by Secretary of theNavy Frank Knox’s public dismissal of the Los Angeles Air Raid incident as afalse alarm. Yet the Navy, according to Tompkins, immediately began workingbehind the scenes with the Army Air Force and Douglas Aircraft engineers,through the Douglas informal study group from 1942 to 1945, to understand thephenomenon. At the same time, the Navy ran its covert intelligence program withoperatives embedded in Nazi Germany’s flying saucer programs.Quickly, the Navy realized that the Army Air Force planned to assert its primacywhen it came to the newly emerging field of space operations. Put simply, theArmy Air Force viewed space as turf belonging to the soon to be created US AirForce (1947). Through Project RAND, scientific and military study of the flyingsaucer phenomenon would serve to exclude the Navy from playing a leading role inspace. A policy battle arose between the Army Air Force and Navy when it came todeveloping the first system of space surveillance satellites. This policy battleis exemplified in a brief description on the RAND Corporation website: Interest in the feasibility of space satellites had surfaced somewhat earlier ina Navy proposal for an interservice space program (March 1946). Major GeneralCurtis E. LeMay, then Deputy Chief of the Air Staff for Research andDevelopment, considered space operations to be an extension of airoperations.[88] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn88] LeMay commissioned a study by Project RAND that was published in May 1946,titled “Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship.”[89][part0000_split_046.html#_edn89] The study led to the Navy losing its emergingpolicy struggle with the Army Air Force over jointly developing a spacesatellite reconnaissance system. Subsequent RAND publications then served tocreate the impression that only the Army Air Force, and later the US Air Force(formed September 1947), was serious about space operations, and in developingthe exotic propulsion systems needed for space flight.In the meantime, the Navy would secretly continue its own research anddevelopment work on reverse engineering the recovered extraterrestrial craftfrom the Los Angeles Air Raid, and the Nazi flying saucer prototypes acquired atthe end of the war that were brought to its own research facilities. Theprincipal location the Navy would choose to conduct its examination of flyingsaucers technologies was to be its flagship research and development location inCalifornia, the Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake.Tompkins says that during World War II, he flew multiple missions to China Lakewith the briefing packets he had prepared from the debriefings of Navy spies:“Spent much time at China Lake facility modifying rockets for testing (40visits) and working on their alien projects.”[90][part0000_split_046.html#_edn90] This reflects the Navy’s sustained interest inunderstanding extraterrestrial technologies after the recovery of the aliencraft from the Los Angeles incident, and its broader goals for future Navy spaceoperations.Due to Project RAND, all of the general public’s attention fell upon the ArmyAir Force when it came to future space operations and the UFO phenomenon. Thisescalated after the July 1947 Roswell Incident when the Army Air Force announcedthat a flying saucer had crashed, only to retract the announcement hourslater.[91] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn91] The effect of giving the public theimpression that the Army Air Force was covering up the flying saucer phenomenonwas laid. In this way, public attention was firmly directed away from what theNavy was secretly doing at its leading research and development facilities.By late 1947, a decision was made to formally separate Project RAND fromDouglas, which the RAND Corporation website explains:By late 1947, it seemed as though Project RAND—which was already operatingfairly autonomously—should consider separating from Douglas. In February 1948,the Chief of Staff [Carl A. Spaatz] of the newly created United States Air Forcewrote a letter to the president of the Douglas Aircraft Company that approvedthe evolution of Project RAND into a nonprofit corporation, independent ofDouglas.[92] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn92]According to Tompkins, the separation was not as smooth a transition as the RANDwebsite depicts. In an interview, he said that roughly two thirds of theapproximate 200 personnel working in Project RAND moved over to the Santa Monicafacility of the newly created RAND Corporation. The one third left remained withDouglas at its own highly classified engineering facility in Santa Monica.[93][part0000_split_046.html#_edn93]It is this remnant of Project RAND that stayed with the secret Douglas thinktank, Advanced Design, which Tompkins began working for in early 1951, afterjoining Douglas only months earlier in late 1950. Tompkins likened theseparation of Project RAND from Douglas as a traumatic divorce, as he describesin his autobiography:I had been flying up to Douglas, from Naval Air Station North Island San Diego,since spring 1943… Now seven years later, it had been over a year since thedivorce. The atmosphere in the Tank was thick with overwhelming tension andresentment. The personnel who had been forced to stay with the family [DouglasAircraft Company] were hit the hardest. Those who wanted to stay, but who had toleave, also had strong feelings.[94] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn94]Tompkins went on to explain his surprise when he learned in 1951 of theantigravity projects being secretly studied by the Douglas scientists andengineers in its classified think tank, and how a separate think tank [RANDProject] also existed with a similar purpose:We were totally unaware that this strange, out-of-this-world thing had everexisted inside a classified engineering area, inside an aircraft company, onewhich in turn, must have existed inside another classified area. Another ThinkTank [RAND], comprised of other people, was also tasked to evaluate theunbelievable events.[95] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn95]Although Advanced Design continued, albeit restructured, with the nearly 70scientists and engineers remaining from Project RAND, an antagonisticrelationship quickly developed between the RAND Corporation and the Douglasthink tank. What Tompkins says next in his book illustrates that this became along term problem:For years, this was a thorn in our sides. We were subjected to continuousinterruptions in our conference rooms, by other people who appeared there toevaluate our studies and concepts.[96] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn96]These “other people” were agents of industrial sabotage, according to Tompkins,and they would set back the Navy’s efforts to work with Douglas’ Advanced Designthink tank towards the goal of creating antigravity vehicles. "},{"pageContent":"EXTRATERRESTRIAL ASSISTANCE & INDUSTRIAL SABOTAGE Advanced Design would find itself to be a player in two unfolding alien agendas.Put briefly, on the one hand, human-looking extraterrestrials that lookedScandinavian, and hence described by Tompkins as “Nordics,” began helpingDouglas think tank engineers to design kilometers-long space carriers andcruisers.[97] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn97] Tompkins says that the Nordicextraterrestrials were cultivating the Navy as a future ally because of themilitary conflicts that were occurring with (Draconian) Reptilians, elsewhere inthe galaxy: I’m convinced some of those white hat aliens [Nordics] are pushing us. They wantus to develop spacecraft carriers and help their Naval space battle groupscombat the black hat aliens [Reptilians].[98] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn98] On the other hand, Tompkins explains further, the Reptilians, along with theirNazi allies, were sabotaging projects that Douglas Advanced Design was workingon for a future Navy-run space program. The RAND Corporation, according toTompkins’ testimony, was linked to this industrial sabotage, suggesting thatRAND and the USAF were being influenced by the Reptilian extraterrestrials andNazis.There are two major issues to consider here when evaluating Tompkins’ incrediblestatements about Nordic and Reptilian extraterrestrials using the US Navy andAir Force as proxies in a galactic conflict. Both directly relate to the historyof the RAND Corporation and its current activities.First, it is well known that former Navy Secretary, James Forrestal, who becamethe inaugural Secretary of Defense in September 1947, was locked in a number ofbitter policy struggles with Stuart Symington, the first Secretary of the US AirForce (from September 1947 to April 1950).[99] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn99]What is not well known, according to Tompkins, is that Forrestal was in chargeof the Navy espionage program on the Nazi antigravity programs and theiralliance with Draconian-Reptilians during World War II. Tompkins says that thefindings of the Navy espionage program led directly to Forrestal’s order toestablish the Office of Research and Inventions in May 1945 (see Figure 29),which formalized his oversight of the covert intelligence program run by AdmiralBotta out of Naval Air Station, San Diego.Forrestal’s role in the Navy’s espionage program was very likely a significantfactor in his promotion to Secretary of Defense in September 1947. Certainly hewas fully aware of the nuances and extent of the looming problem. Forrestal wasin favor of the Navy taking a leadership role in solving the Nazi andextraterrestrial problem, and to reveal more of the truth to the general public.Tompkins states that Forrestal was being directly influenced by Nordicextraterrestrials who had made contact with him. In an Figure 29. Forrestal Creates Office of Research and Invention[../images/00030.jpeg] interview, Tompkins made the startling claim that it was the Nordics who hadrecommended Admiral Botta to Forrestal as the person who should head the Navyespionage program in Nazi Occupied Europe. What’s most important here, and frankly I would say that this is definitely notcommon knowledge. Secretary of the Navy [Forrestal] had a communication fromNordics to make a selection of the individual who was to take this [Navyespionage] program. That individual [Botta] was not even an American. He wasfrom Australia. He went to school here. Joined the Navy, went up the ranks veryfast, to finally a one star admiral. But what’s important here is that of the 37admirals that could have been picked to handle this, an individual who had notbeen influenced by having graduated from Annapolis, or gotten all of theincorrect information about everything on this planet, which is misinformationthat’s been given to us by the Reptilians for at least 5000 years, controllingthis planet. None of those Annapolis graduates were selected, but an individualwas selected that had never gotten a university education. And I think this isextremely important, because virtually every Ph.D. on this planet has been givenincorrect information. It is the major problem that we have in this subject asfar as disclosure is concerned. Because the Ph.D’s have been lied to, all ofthem! Why was it that Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, selected an Australianman, without an education to be the implementer of the most importantinformation that’s ever taken place on this planet. We got to ask questions,period.[100] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn100] Botta’s technical expertise and leadership skills during WWII were recognized bythe Navy, which had rapidly promoted him, and bestowed various military honorsas historical records prove. Forrestal’s choice of Botta to lead the Navalintelligence program had been a good one.If Tompkins is correct, Forrestal was directly working with Nordicextraterrestrials, who influenced him not only to choose the Naval officer whowould establish the Navy’s Research and Development of Nazi flying saucertechnologies, but to also steer the US administration away from cooperating withthe Nazis and Reptilians, and to reveal the truth to the public.However, Forrestal was in a small minority among the policy makers dealing withthe Nazi and extraterrestrial problem through an appointed committee set up byPresident Truman in 1947, which was called Operation Majestic 12 (see TrumanMemo, Figure 30). The Majestic 12 Committee was not in favor of any kind ofpublic disclosure of the alien problem.The Air Force Secretary Symington was a firm supporter of General Curtis LeMay,who “considered space operations to be an extension of air operations,” andtherefore supported the US Air Figure 30. Truman Memorandum that Authorized Operation Majestic 12[../images/00031.jpeg] Force in a dominant role when it came to developing future space programs.[101][part0000_split_046.html#_edn101] Both Symington and LeMay were firmly opposedto Forrestal’s attempt to give the Navy the leadership role when it came tospace, Nazi spacecraft, and extraterrestrial life. Furthermore, Symington andLeMay were vehemently opposed to revealing the truth of the extraterrestrialproblem to the general public.These policy disputes were a direct factor in the events that led to Forrestal’ssacking as Secretary of Defense on March 28, 1949, and “assassination” twomonths later. Significantly, this was the same period when the Navy and Army AirForce collaboration in Project RAND, through the Douglas Aircraft Company, cameto an end. The RAND Corporation was launched as an independent corporate entityin early 1948. Figure 31. James Forrestal Receives Distinguished Service Medal from PresidentTruman in March 1949[../images/00032.jpeg] The second issue to consider is a proxy extraterrestrial war involving separateUSAF and Navy led secret space programs. There are a number of whistleblowertestimonies describing that the USAF led the way in a secret treaty with a groupof extraterrestrials directly connected with the Nazi-Reptilian alliance. InFebruary 1955, a meeting occurred at Holloman Air Force Base, where PresidentEisenhower secretly negotiated an agreement with a group of Nazi linkedextraterrestrials, called the “Tall Grays.”[102][part0000_split_046.html#_edn102] As stated by a number of whistleblowers, theUSAF worked directly with extraterrestrials and Nazis behind the 1955 agreementto develop squadrons of antigravity spacecraft, in the 1960’s and 1970’s, for aUSAF run secret space program.[103] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn103]Charles Hall is a former weather observer for the US Air Force from 1963 to1967. He was stationed at the Nellis Air Force Base’s Indian Springs facility,where he claims he frequently witnessed extraterrestrials called the “TallWhites” (aka Tall Grays) regularly meeting with senior military leaders. Asecret underground base was built at Indian Springs to house theextraterrestrials and their advanced interstellar ships. Rumors of theextraterrestrials at Nellis AFB date back to the mid-1950’s, which is consistentwith testimonial evidence that agreements were reached during the Eisenhoweradministration. Confirmation has been found for some of Hall’s claims concerninganomalous events at the weather ranges, including government funding for asecret underground base at Indian Springs.[104][part0000_split_046.html#_edn104]Hall explained the legalistic way in which agreements with the Tall Whiteextraterrestrials are interpreted, in this response to an interview question,about why he was chosen to liaise with them: … the decision to send me, and no one else, out to the ranges, was made by acommittee of individuals that included the Tall Whites as well as high rankingUSAF Generals and other high ranking members of the U.S. Government. The TallWhites are very meticulous about keeping their agreements and expect the U.S.Government to be equally meticulous about keeping its agreements as well. If Iwere victimized or threatened by anyone, The Tall Whites would interpret that tomean that the U.S. Government could not be trusted to keep its agreements. Theconsequences would be enormous.[105] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn105] Hall’s testimony is significant since it reveals that extraterrestrials aresupplied a number of resources, including basing rights in exchange fortechnological assistance to the USAF. Secretly formalized by officials in thePentagon and other key government agencies, one or more undisclosed agreementshave arisen out of face-to-face meetings between both Air Force and nationalsecurity officials with the Tall Whites. Another former Air Force employee with direct first-hand experience of Grayextraterrestrials working with the USAF is Niara Isley. She worked for the USAir Force in the late 1970’s as a radar specialist. During a three month periodfrom January to March 1980, she was involuntarily recruited into a black projectafter being asked to get a radar lock on a UFO at the Tonopah Test range. Aftersuccessfully performing her assigned mission, she describes what happened as aconsequence of her viewing a UFO: I was dragged down what seemed like an abnormally long staircase through anotherdoor in the room. I was placed on the floor of a room with a one-way mirroredobservation glass, mirrored of course on my side. Locked in there, I wentthrough the effects of the injection, which was terrifying also. I can onlydescribe feeling like I was coming apart at the molecular level. I don'tremember pain, only the fear of dissolving away into nothing. After the effectsof the injection were beginning to fade, I was dragged out of the room and rapedby two security guards while eight other people watched, one of them a Greyextraterrestrial. I remember quite a bit of detail of this and can draw elementsfrom these memories in detail.[106] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn106] Isley’s testimony is further evidence that Gray aliens actively collaborate withmembers of the US military in a secret space program that routinely violateshuman rights. The cooperation between the USAF and Grays, and other Reptilianallied extraterrestrials, extends to this day.The RAND Corporation continues to help the USAF develop a coherent policy interms of global research and development related to its secret space program,which is entirely separate to the very public NASA space program. RAND, then andnow, in collaboration with the US Air Force Space Command, secretly studiesantigravity designs that could help develop new squadrons of antigravityspacecraft in the future.Currently, USAF Space Command uses antigravity craft developed withextraterrestrial assistance, such as the TR-3B flying triangle out of Area 51 inNevada, for near-Earth space operations.[107] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn107]The flying triangles service two stealth space stations which secretly orbit theEarth. In response to a question about whether astronauts on the InternationalSpace Station observe the activities of secret space programs, Goode revealscritical information about the USAF covert space stations:Yes, they [ISS astronauts] absolutely do observe activity going on around them.For the most part, they're seeing the military, the MIC SSP, the program that iscontrolled by the NSA, the DIA, Air Force, that kind of thing. They have acouple of space stations up there that every time they orbit the Earth, they geta look at. So they're seeing these space stations that are about 400 miles to500 miles out, and then they see the unacknowledged craft [TR-3B flyingtriangles] that are servicing these space stations.[108][part0000_split_046.html#_edn108]In contrast to the close USAF cooperation with RAND, the next chapter revealsthat up to the early 1960’s, the US Navy worked closely with Douglas Aircraft’sAdvanced Design in designing space battle groups with massive space carriers andcruisers. According to Tompkins, the Navy and Douglas were assisted by a verydifferent group of extraterrestrials."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4INSIDE THE DOUGLAS THINK TANK & ITS INFILTRATION BY NORDIC EXTRATERRESTRIALS Over a 12 year period, beginning in 1951, William Tompkins worked for an aboveTop Secret think tank within the Douglas Aircraft Company designing antigravityspacecraft, covertly requested by the US Navy. Tompkins says he was given thejob at “Advanced Design” due to the exceptional skills he exhibited in hiswartime service with Naval Intelligence from 1942-1946.It was throughout his service at San Diego’s Naval Air Station that Tompkinsdirectly participated in intelligence debriefings of the Navy agents workingwithin Nazi Germany’s most secret aerospace facilities during and immediatelyafter World War II. Tompkins said that over his four years with the Navalintelligence program, he helped in the covert distribution of data from NaziGermany’s two distinct secret space programs to Douglas Aircraft Company, alongwith other select aerospace companies and universities that had the scientificexpertise to understand what the Nazis were doing.When Tompkins joined Douglas Aircraft Company in 1950, the Advanced Design thinktank still existed to study and design antigravity spacecraft, although nolonger as part of Project Rand (1945-1948). A Majestic document called the“White Hot Report” provides an independent source corroborating that Douglas wasinvolved in highly classified studies of retrieved alien spacecraft throughProject RAND.[109] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn109] "},{"pageContent":"DESIGNING NAVY SPACE BATTLE GROUPS Once Tompkins moved within Douglas over to Advanced Design in 1951, he wasspecifically tasked to design a variety of antigravity space vehicles, using hisknowledge of the Naval Intelligence gathered on approximately 30 Nazi Germanprototypes, and his own talent for detailed technical designs. Tompkinsdescribes the two individuals who were his superiors at the Advanced Designthink tank:I reported directly to Dr. [Wolfgang] Klemperer and Elmer Wheaton, the V.P. ofengineering who wore two hats. He was V.P. of all the classified missile andspace-systems programs. Unknown to 99.9%, Wheaton was V.P. of the above topsecret compartmentalized extraterrestrial threats research Think Tank, too,sometimes referred to as Advanced Design.[110] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn110]Wheaton and Klemperer were leading experts in missile and space-systems, andco-wrote chapter 15 in the 1946 Project Rand study for the development of theworld’s first earth orbiting satellite, where they examined the time and cost ofthe project.[111] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn111] In addition to their knownexpertise in conventional rocketry, Tompkins has supplied a document confirmingthat Wheaton and Klemperer were also researching UFO reports and antigravitystudies in open source material. The document confirms that Tompkins’ immediatesuperiors in the Douglas think tank were indeed studying antigravity propulsiontheories during the 1950’s, and this would directly aid them in overseeing thedesigns of large spacecraft for the Navy.Tompkins says that he approached his work by developing mission parameters forthe requested future space battle groups. He then was able to come up withdesigns that would allow the Navy to fulfill its forecasted space missions. Figure 32. Memorandum Confirming Douglas Study of Antigravity Propulsion[../images/00033.jpeg]Every possible mission was considered for spacecraft carriers, battle cruisers,and support star ships capable of missions to the southeast quadrant, spiral armof our Milky Way Galaxy, and its stars and planets. By conceiving naval spacemissions utilizing Think Tank Naval attack destroyer and Navy/marine assaultspace ship carrier configurations … unsolicited bids could be submitted to theNavy by Douglas.[112] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn112] Tompkins describes in his autobiography the covert way in which the Navy wentabout making design requests to Advanced Design, and accepting unsolicitedproposals:After receiving our unsolicited proposal for star ships [the Navy put out a solesource request for a proposal for exploratory star mission vehicles…]. Actuallywe didn’t even get an RFP (Request for Proposal); it was just slipped in underthe floor door to our Advanced Design…. on the envelope it only said: “To Whomit may concern.” [113] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn113]Admiral Bobby Ray Inman was allegedly an intermediary for the unsolicitedDouglas bids for Navy contracts to design the interstellar craft. In hisautobiography, Tompkins describes a conversation between himself and ElmerWheaton about how to get a bid accepted by the Navy: “Don’t worry about ONR’s [Office of Naval Research] approval,” Wheaton said:They can get it for us.” Then he said, “Okay, great job, gentlemen. If we canget this through the heavies in the other part, we might get a final out. Ithink ONI [Office of Naval Investigations] and ONR will both run with it. Thisis the kind of backup Bobby Ray (Bobby Ray Inman) needs to convince Forrestal’speople that we can close the gap with the other ones out there. I thought, whoare they? And who are the heavies in the other part?[114][part0000_split_046.html#_edn114] Dr. Robert Wood, the book’s editor, added the following clarifying noteimmediately after Tompkins’ above quote: My interpretation of these remarks and their chronology is this: Elmer Wheatonhad contact with the UFO-cleared group in the Navy, which he referred to as“Forrestal’s people” as the ones who knew about the UFOs issues. One of the newyoung Navy officers who was cleared for the UFO topic appears to have been BobbyRay Inman, and his inside knowledge of the UFO problem may well have been thespecial link to his subsequent highly successful career. Apparently Bobby Raywas the main person interacting with the Wheaton think tank at the time of thisconversation. Since Bill Tompkins time in this vault spans several years[1951-1963], it is not real clear that this conversation occurred in 1952 orperhaps a year or so later. [115] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn115] I was able to reach Admiral Inman and asked him about Tompkins’ claim. He said:“There is no way in the 50’s or 60’s I could have had any knowledge or beeninvolved at all with anything Douglas Aircraft was doing.”[116][part0000_split_046.html#_edn116] Regarding his firm denial of any involvementwith the Douglas Company and its projects, it is important to point out that hewould have been, and likely still is, officially obliged to deny any involvementif the project had been classified as an unacknowledged special access program.According to Tompkins, the projects at Douglas received the highest securityclassification possible in the defense industry, which today would correspond toan Unacknowledged Special Access Program (SAP). A 1995 Department of Defense(DoD) Manual titled: “National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual”describes the security obligation of those participating in a SAP: There are two types of SAPS, acknowledged and unacknowledged. An acknowledgedSAP is a program which may be openly recognized or known; however, specifics areclassified within that SAP. The existence of an unacknowledged SAP or anunacknowledged portion of an acknowledged program,will not be made known to anyperson not authorized for this information.[117][part0000_split_046.html#_edn117] Despite his retirement, Inman would still be officially required not to disclosethe existence of, or his involvement in, any unacknowledged SAPs involving theNavy and Douglas Aircraft Company. Inman’s career postings do raise thepossibility that he was a Navy liaison between the ONI and Douglas Aircraftduring Tompkins’ time in Advance Design up to 1963.In my December 1, 2016 phone interview with Inman, he said that he began hisNaval Commission in March 1951, and after several assignments, attended a NavalIntelligence postgraduate program in 1957 in Washington DC. He further statedthat after graduation, he stayed on at the Pentagon as an intelligence brieferuntil 1960. Then after another short assignment, he was sent to a Navy office inthe National Security Agency from October 1961 to 1965 as an Intelligencespecialist. During his time at the Pentagon and/or NSA, he could have played aliaison role between the Navy and Douglas Aircraft’s Advanced Design, asTompkins claims.Tompkins also said that Advanced Design worked closely with a number of Navyresearch development facilities such as Naval Development Center, Warminster,Pennsylvania; Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake; and the Naval Air Station,San Diego.[118] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn118] He asserts that 75% of thetechnical projects at Advanced Design were funded by the Navy, and admiralscould often be found at the think tank. In contrast, it was rare to see an USAFgeneral at Douglas Aircraft’s Advanced Design. The USAF focus had changed and itbecame the major funder of the RAND Corporation after it separated in 1948 fromthe Douglas Aircraft Company.How he went about creating the configuration of a Naval Space Battle Group,comprising kilometers-long vehicles from the mission parameters he had beengiven, Tompkins explains:I redefined a standard Naval space battle group complement, stating that itwould consist of one 2.5 kilometer spacecraft carrier, with a two-star on boardas flag, three to four 1.4 k heavy space cruisers, four to five 1k spacedestroyers, two 2k space landing assault ships for drop missions, two 2k spacelogistic support ships, and two 2k space personal transports. [119][part0000_split_046.html#_edn119]Tompkins writes about two Navy starship designs completed at the Douglas thinktank, and includes the documents in his autobiography:The figures following show two original drawings of naval spacecraft carriersand battle cruisers that were visualized in Advanced Design, in 1954, fromdozens of alternate configurations. Scale modes of these kilometer-long craftwere subsequently made. [120] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn120] In one of the two designs, Tompkins used for comparative purposes the USS Akron,a Navy airship deployed in 1931 that was 240 meters (785 feet) in length. Itcould carry “F9C Sparrowhawk” and “Waco XJW-1” aircraft, and was the world’sfirst flying aircraft carrier.The USS Akron, and its sister ship, the USS Macon, were built as a joint venturebetween the US based Goodyear and German based Zeppelin companies. The Akronclass airships confirm that the US Navy was already involved in building flyingaircraft carriers in the late 1920’s. The Navy, therefore, had the history andexpertise to begin work on developing similar space carriers once antigravitypropulsion technologies became feasible in the 1950’s. In Tompkins’ design for a heavy transport spacecraft that was three kilometers(two miles) long, he compared it in size to the USS Akron. He showed how itwould be built using a modular construction process with nearly 15 million ‘10foot’ cubes [see figure 35]. Figure 33. Sparrowhawk Fight Being Pulled Into USS Akron[../images/00034.jpeg] Figure 34. USS Akron Was a Helium-Filled Ridgid Flying Aircraft Carrier thatCrashed in April 1933[../images/00035.jpeg]Figure 35. Massive Space Carrier[../images/00036.jpeg] Tompkins describes how by 1952, just two years after he had joined AdvancedDesign at Douglas, he and his colleagues had already accumulated a large numberof designs for the different classes of vehicles for the future Navy spacebattle groups:At the time, we in the tank, had already conceived a file cabinet full of NavalSpace Missions and another full of Naval spacecraft ships from spacecraftcarriers to spacecraft transports, six years before NASA even existed [createdon July 29, 1958]. A great number of these missions became NASA’s (NAVY)prototype for our next thirty year penetrations to solar system planets andstars.[121] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn121]Tompkins provided another document showing a mile long (1.6 kilometer) battlegroup flagship. In the diagram, the annotation shows that the design wasoriginally conceived at Douglas’ “Advanced Design,” and re-introduced at asimilar think tank within TRW, called “Advanced Concept,” where Tompkins workedfrom 1967 to 1971.Figure 36. Space Battle Group Flagship[../images/00037.jpeg]The next graphic displays a close up of the hull of the flagship showing how itwould operate as a space carrier for smaller triangular shaped fighterspacecraft (similar to the TR-3B to be discussed in chapter ten). In aninterview on Gaia TV, Tompkins explained:Figure 37. Triangle Spacecraft Entering Flagship[../images/00038.jpeg]And what you see there is the different classes of attack and fighter aircraftreturning to the mothership, or the spacecraft carrier, and withvacuum-controlled entry sections . . . Actually, they would design to fold downso that you're already in support of making inside landing.Nobody actually flies in these squadrons controlling any of the vehicles. It'sall automatic, so you're not going to be hitting the walls or any of this kindof thing. But very quickly, you can open these hatches on the side. The hatchthen becomes sort of a platform to possibly land on if you're too low. And thisanswers the question of how do we handle the large spaces aboard the ships thatare going to be operating on the missions.[122][part0000_split_046.html#_edn122]While the designs for the enormous space battle groups were being conducted atDouglas, and later at TRW, the detailed engineering and construction occurred ata classified facility in Utah near the Wasatch Mountains, according to Tompkins.In response to a question on this subject, Tompkins told of a conversation with“Admiral Roscoe” (Hillenkoetter) about completing the project, and wrote aboutit in his autobiography:Well Admiral … as you know, we here on the working side of the DAC/RAND ThinkTank – are proposing to build a large spaceship development and manufacturingplant in Utah. It can handle your two-kilometer spacecraft carriers, with thecapability to expand the facilities to accommodate ships that are ten times thatsize. We’ll need the funding, of course. That’s where you come in, Admiral.[123][part0000_split_046.html#_edn123]In a radio interview, Tompkins provided more details about the constructionfacilities for the kilometers-long spacecraft that was designed at Douglas, andthe aerospace companies involved in the construction process:One of the facilities that was used is east of the Wasatch Mountains in Utah.This was a very, very large cavern. It has smaller ones adjacent to it, but it'sa massive one. And they were able to put together Lockheed space systems,Northrop-Grumman facilities, and even Boeing were involved in the actualconstruction of these kilometer-long spacecraft carriers that the Navy now haseight of these spacecraft carrier battle groups out in the galaxy.[124][part0000_split_046.html#_edn124]It is worth pointing out that Lockheed Martin (formally Lockheed) and NorthrupGrumman (formally Northrup), along with Douglas Aircraft Company, had receivedbriefing packets from Tompkins from 1943 to 1946. Tompkins says that Lockheed’stop secret think tank, “Skunk Works,” which was officially formed in June 1943,emerged as a direct result of the contents of the briefing packets hedelivered.[125] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn125] In 1997, Boeing absorbedMcDonnell Douglas, which had previously formed out of the 1967 merger betweenDouglas Aircraft Company and McDonnell Aircraft. Consequently, the three maincorporations responsible for building and upgrading the Navy’s eight spacebattle fleets, which were constructed in secret Utah locations since the 1980’s,can all be directly traced to the original companies that received Tompkins’briefing packets. "},{"pageContent":"NORDIC EXTRATERRESTRIALS INFILTRATED DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT COMPANYTompkins says he and his colleagues were helped by three Nordicextraterrestrials secretly posing as normal citizens, who had gained employmentwithin the Douglas Aviation Company. He described how these three Nordics, twofemales and one male, provided key information about the design and constructionof space vehicles without revealing their true identity. Tompkins even explainedto a co-worker in Advanced Design how his Secretary, Jessica, would not revealher true origin, but was clearly one of the Nordic extraterrestrials assistinghim in completing Douglas company projects on behalf of the Navy:I tried to explain to John that Jessica has never said that she is a Nordic,even though … exposing her unbelievable knowledge of the universes. And yes, shefrequently stuffs my head with exactly what is needed on a program. When Iimplement the plan it works every time. [126] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn126]Upon seeing a photo of Maria Orsic, which Tompkins saw for the first time onpage 67 of the book Insiders Reveal Secret Space Programs and ExtraterrestrialAlliances (2015), he was startled. This is because she looked exactly as heremembered Jessica, the Nordic extraterrestrial who had infiltrated DouglasAircraft Company as a secretary.[127] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn127] Figure 38. Tompkins Said Jessica (a Nordic ET) Looked Exactly Like Maria Orsic[../images/00039.jpeg] Tompkins’ claim, that the Douglas Aircraft Company has been infiltrated by threeNordic extraterrestrials, is supported by multiple whistleblowers and privatecitizens that claim human-looking extraterrestrials have successfully integratedinto all facets of human society, including the most senior levels of theworld’s military, including NATO.[128] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn128]Robert Dean (CSM, US Army Ret.) worked at NATO’s Supreme Headquarters from1963-1967, and during this time was stationed in the Operations Center with aCosmic Top Secret clearance. He says he viewed a secret NATO study that wascommissioned to analyze the threat posed by UFOs to NATO operations in EasternEurope. The classified report was titled: “An Assessment: An Evaluation of aPossible Military threat to Allied Forces in Europe.” It focused on the dangersof UFOs being mistakenly identified as an incoming ballistic missile attack fromthe Soviet Union.Dean claimed that the NATO study identified four different extraterrestrialcivilizations visiting the Earth at that time. According to his testimony, whatreally worried the NATO top brass was that some of the visitors looked so muchlike us that they were virtually indistinguishable. Dean says that NATO generalswere paranoid over the possibility that some of the extraterrestrial visitorscould be walking in the corridors of NATO or the Pentagon, or even the WhiteHouse itself. In an interview Dean stated:There was a human group that looked so much like us that that really drove theadmirals and the generals crazy because they determined that these people, andthey had seen them repeatedly, they had had contact with them…. These peoplelooked so much like us they could sit next to you on a plane or in a restaurantand you'd never know the difference. And being military and being primarilyparanoid, that bothered the generals and the admirals a little bit. That thefact that these intelligent entities could be involved with us, walking up anddown the corridors of SHAPE, walking down the corridors of the Pentagon. My God,it even dawned on a couple of them that these guys could even be in the WhiteHouse! Of course, as I said, being paranoid in those years it really shookthings up a little bit.[129] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn129]Another public official to have disclosed the truth about extraterrestrialsinfiltrating and living among humans is the current Russian Prime Minister andformer President, Dmitry Medvedev. On December 7, 2012, he made some startlingoff-air comments to reporters while his microphone was still switched on. He wasasked whether the President is given any secret files on extraterrestrials whilein office. In his responses, Medvedev not only confided that extraterrestrialsare visiting the Earth, but that some are actually living among us:Along with the briefcase with nuclear codes, the president of the country isgiven a special ‘top secret’ folder. This folder in its entirety containsinformation about aliens who visited our planet… Along with this, you are givena report of the absolutely secret special service that exercises control overaliens on the territory of our country…[130] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn130] Dean and Medvedev’s statements are a vital key in unlocking the truth ofextraterrestrials living among the human population, and infiltrating themilitary-industrial complex. His testimony conclusively demonstrates thatofficial military and government agencies are aware of this penetration, and infact have developed strategies for such a contingency.Corey Goode says that for several years, he was employed in an intercept andinterrogate program involving extraterrestrials found on Earth.[131][part0000_split_046.html#_edn131] The intercept program would identify aliensthat had infiltrated human society and bring them in for interrogation. Goodesaid that his task was to find their purpose for being on Earth, and detect anydeception on the part of the extraterrestrial during their interrogation.Coercive methods such as torture were used on the alien infiltrators. What Goodewitnessed was deeply traumatic, and he says he needed assistance in dealing withthe trauma of the incidents which he still fully recalls. He said in an email tome:Their [Mayan] technology was all neurologically interfaced technology and wasvery impressive. The device they used to assist me in the removing of the “Pain”and “Negative Energy Associations” with certain very dark memories wasinteresting. It was what they called a “Halo” and looked like it was made of“Gold” but was light as a feather. When they put it on top of my head it“Sucked” to my skull/scalp like my head was a magnet. And they looked at afloating console and they never touched but interacted with mentally.… They wereof great service to me and I am told they have been brought in to assist many ofthe Humans who have been “Recovered” from Bases and even from slavery in othersolar systems. There are secret locations in other Sol Systems that havecolonies for these humans to recover as they will not be able to reintegratewith our society anytime soon. This group has assisted them greatly. Many assumethat they are “Aliens” that are assisting former Human Slaves. These people justdo not have the full facts.[132] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn132]In the case of the Nordics that had established their presence inside Douglas,Tompkins claims they assisted him greatly. In fact, the assistance he wasreceiving from his Nordic friends had elevated him into a preeminent position asan authority on different types of extraterrestrials and their technologies:Over time, both in and out of the Advanced Design Think Tank, I got thereputation as the principal thinker addressing the black hat alien [DracoReptilians Empire] threats and conceiving programs to counter them. Somehow,other white hat aliens [Nordics] dropped concepts in between my ears that alwaysworked. It was like I had some of their technology that was thousands of yearsmore advanced than ours here on planet Earth.[133][part0000_split_046.html#_edn133]In a later chapter, both documentary and witness evidence will be introduced toshow that Tompkins was indeed considered to be an authority on extraterrestriallife and technology by the retired Navy officers who worked with him on “SpecialProjects” with the Navy League in the 1990’s. "},{"pageContent":"NAVY APPROVED TOMPKINS’ RELATIONSHIP WITH NORDIC EXTRATERRESTRIALSTompkins specifically recalls a conversation with Elmer Wheaton, who told himthat the Navy considered him to have been chosen by the Nordics at a young ageto play a critical role in being an intermediary between the Navy and Nordics:We know that several of you guys, especially you, have been selected by some ofthese alien guys, if you get my meaning. Naval intelligence wasn’t alone whenthey took an interest in you. There are aliens – probably Nordics – who selectedyou as a child to assist them in their endeavors to prod the US into developinggalactic Naval spaceships and operations advantageous to us both…. Our NavalIntelligence considers you a preferred human contactee. The communication linkbetween these extraterrestrial races and you contactees provides us withadvanced counter threat concepts, not just for the Apollo program, or for theNavy base on the Moon, but literally for all advanced space concepts forsubsequent encounters….[134] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn134]Tompkins recollections here are staggering in their implications. They suggestthat key figures in the Office of Naval Intelligence were aware that Tompkinsand others, such as Navy Secretary James Forrestal and Rear Admiral Rico Botta,had a special connection to a friendly human-looking group of extraterrestrials,which were in conflict with the same Reptilians who had formed an alliance withHitler. This meant that these specially selected individuals, or “preferredhuman contactees,” would form a critical role in helping establish a covertalliance between the US Navy and Nordic extraterrestrials.Such an alliance had to be covert, due to the infiltration of the militaryindustrial complex by Nazi Breakaway groups and their Reptilian allies, whichhad occurred as a result of formal agreements between the Nazi-Reptilians andthe Eisenhower administration, beginning at Holloman Air Force Base in February1955. The Nazi-Reptilian alliance would increasingly coopt many elements of theUS military industrial complex over time, including key components of the AirForce, the RAND Corporation, the Central Intelligence Agency, and even theDouglas Aircraft Company.In contrast, senior Navy officials covertly worked with the Nordics both toprevent Nazi-Reptilian infiltration, and to build future Navy space battlegroups. In a Gaia TV interview with David Wilcock, Goode corroborated Tompkins’testimony of the Navy permitting Nordic extraterrestrials to infiltrate majorcorporations like Douglas Aircraft Company:David: How would one of these Nordic men or women be able to get into such ahighly compartmentalized, highly classified thing? Wouldn't our government orthe military-industrial complex be highly afraid of them because of thepossibility of them either deceiving us or bringing intel back to their owngroup and then weaponizing it against us?Corey: Yeah, and after a while, they found out that we were being deceived aboutsome things that the Nordics – that we're calling them – did for operationalsecurity, you know? There were definite[ly] some deceptions that were given tous. But for the most part, they were learning about the reptilian threat and thethreat of their allies. And this group [Nordics] look a lot like us. Basically,it's like a cousin coming to help a cousin.David: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.Corey: Yeah, yeah. But these people presented themselves as wanting us to getrid of our nukes, wanting us to become more loving and peaceful. And they just .. . They [US Military] did not see as big of a threat from them [Nordics] asthey did their enemy, the Reptilian groups.[135][part0000_split_046.html#_edn135]The fruit of this covert cooperation was the development in the 1980’s of jointoperations between the first Navy space battle groups and the Nordicextraterrestrial space fleets, which Tompkins describes here:I don't know the actual mission right now, but for most of the periods the firstones were built [1980’s] and went out into the galaxy because they were builthere. They were operating with only one of the eight who operated around thesolar system. The others were out in the galaxy jointly operating missionsagainst Reptilians and other bad people, but jointly working with the NordicNavy, and who were the people that had been assisting at least us on theApollo.[136] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn136]Tompkins went on to illustrate the extent of the cooperation between the Nordicfleets and the Navy’s Solar Warden program, and the disparity in numbers withthe Reptilian imperial fleets:[W]e're operating, and have been, since the '80s, with the Nordic Navy. Andthese people . . . It's easiest to describe the situation there . . . For everyten Nordic Navy battle groups, the Reptilians have 100. So we're sort of at adisadvantage, by numbers, but a Nordic Navy has been tremendously supportive ofus. Our Navy works with them and actually is at war not just with Reptilians outin space but several other bad civilizations.[137][part0000_split_046.html#_edn137]While the above scenario may sound like an episode of Star Trek, involving agalactic conflict between the fictional United Federation of Planets and theKlingon Empire, there is reason to believe that Gene Rodenberry was made awareof key elements of the truth. Rodenberry, through the son of a Navy admiral, wasconfidentially told about plans to build a Space Navy, and of a galactic warbetween Nordic extraterrestrials and the Reptilian Empire. Humanity found itselfin the midst of this galactic wide conflict, and Star Trek was inspired in partto reveal key elements of this conflict in order to prepare humanity for thetruth through a “soft disclosure” process."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5STAR TREK BASED ON SECRET NAVY SPACE FLEET September 8, 2016 marked the 50th anniversary of the release of the “Star Trek”science fiction series that began in 1966 on NBC television. Its officialcreator, Gene Roddenberry, is highly respected for this series’ groundbreakingconcepts, yet there is significant evidence that he did not simply come up withthe idea of Star Trek on his own. Instead, he was encouraged to create theseries based on classified information surrounding the development of a secretUS Navy space fleet that was allied with a group of human-lookingextraterrestrials. This laid the foundation for Roddenberry to conceive the ideaof a United Federation of Planets in which many worlds cooperated peacefully,sometimes sharing technology and personnel for space exploration.Roddenberry began developing ideas for a science fiction show after one of hisseries had bombed in 1964:The only reason Roddenberry created Star Trek, at least initially, was to sellanother series to a network. He was, if not desperate, anxious… He had justfailed with The Lieutenant, for Norman Felton’s Arena Productions … No one wasclamoring for another series from Roddenberry, or even his scripts. His agentsuggested he come up with a space series… This may have led to what The OuterLimits historians insist are the accurate — if generally unknown — accounts ofRoddenberry hanging out at times on the set of The Outer Limits. When I learnedthis, it wasn’t hard to imagine that series creator, and executive producer,Leslie Stevens … was someone that Roddenberry may have sought to emulate.[138][part0000_split_046.html#_edn138]This account is confirmed by Tom Seldon, one of the production assistants of thetelevision series “The Outer Limits,” which ran for two seasons (1963-1965) onABC:Star Trek was in fact an outgrowth of The Outer Limits. Gene Roddenberry watchedour dailies all the time and took a lot of phone calls from our screening room.He was spurring his imagination and checking on the incredible quality controlwe had. I wondered why he was there but he was there more often than not duringthe time he was coming up with Star Trek.[139] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn139]Chris Knowles, a media blogger who wrote an eight part series of articles aboutthe genesis of Star Trek, states that Roddenberry and Leslie Stevens IV hadreached a business arrangement for the planned sci-fi series:Bearing in mind that Roddenberry was contracted to a rival studio and a rivalnetwork, the odds are essentially slim to none that the two men didn’t have somekind of business arrangement, whether in writing or not. [140][part0000_split_046.html#_edn140]Gordon White, a book author, reaches the same conclusion about Stevens andRodenberry’s highly unusual relationship:The case is convincingly made [by Knowles] that Leslie Stevens - rather thanRoddenberry - was at the terrestrial epicentre of Star Trek’s prescient highstrangeness, which it inherited from The Outer Limits. Having worked inbroadcast production before, there really isn’t any such thing as innocentlysharing production resources. If Roddenberry was camped out with The OuterLimits team for a whole year, then that very much means something.[141][part0000_split_046.html#_edn141]What lends further credence to the Stevens and Rodenberry connection is thatthey both shared the same production assistant, Robert Justman, who worked onboth the Outer Limits and Star Trek. According to White:For decades, Stevens and Roddenberry shared the same assistant, Rob Justman,passing him backward and forwards whenever one of them had a gig on. Justmanwould go on to be part of a military space futures experiment in the earlynineties. [142] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn142]The evidence firmly points to Stevens and Roddenberry having indeed developed abusiness arrangement for the new Star Trek series. This is where Stevens’background becomes critical in understanding the nature of their arrangement.Stevens was born in 1924, and when his father, a US Navy officer, was assignedto the US Embassy in London in 1935, the following happened:… the 11-year-old boy attended performances of Shakespeare at the Old Vic aspart of his schoolwork and decided to become a playwright. Back in the Statesfour years later he sold a play, The Mechanical Rat, to Orson Welles's MercuryTheatre and ran away from home to join the troupe. Truant officers tracked himdown and he finished schooling with a Bachelor of Arts degree. [143][part0000_split_046.html#_edn143]In 1942, at age 18, he joined the Army Air Force and became an intelligenceofficer. Stevens quickly distinguished himself due to the skills he had acquiredas a playwright, and ended the war as the youngest serving captain in theArmy.[144] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn144]As an intelligence officer, his playwriting skills would have suited him topsychological warfare operations. Consequently, it is possible that during hismilitary intelligence service, Stevens learned about the InterplanetaryPhenomenon Unit, set up by Army G2 to investigate the flying saucer phenomenon.Psychological warfare was a significant component of the Unit’s work in “hidingthe truth” about the phenomenon from the general public while seriouslyinvestigating it.[145] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn145]Even more significant is the fact that Stevens’ father was Navy Vice AdmiralLeslie Stevens III. Vice Admiral Stevens was a contemporary of Rear Admiral RicoBotta, who had played a pivotal role in the Navy’s initial efforts to study theretrieved flying saucer craft from the Los Angeles Air Raid, and oversaw acovert Navy espionage program out of Nazi Germany to learn about Nazi flyingsaucers during World War II. The 29 Navy spies in the program had not onlylearned that the Nazis had developed up to 30 different flying saucerprototypes, but were also being directly assisted by an extraterrestrialcivilization comprising Reptilian hominoids in building bases in Antarctica forfuture space battle fleets. Figure 39. Leslie Steven III & IV[../images/00040.jpeg]Both Admirals Botta and Stevens were leading experts in aerospace engineeringand headed top Navy aerospace facilities at various points during their careers.Botta headed the Navy’s Bureau of Aeronautics Power Plant Branch when hetraveled to Wright Field and other top experimental aircraft facilities in 1942.In 1946, both were retroactively promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral as of1943, for their wartime duties as the following document shows. Botta’spromotion was retroactively dated a week before Stevens, suggesting he was themore senior when it came to their respective wartime command appointments. Bottawent on to head the Naval Air Material Center out of Philadelphia Shipyard from1950 to 1952.[146] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn146] It is from this andsimilar command Figure 40. US Senate Approval of Admirals Stevens Serving on Same Committee[../images/00041.jpeg]assignments that plans began for a secret Navy space fleet aimed to counter whatthe Nazis had developed in Antarctica. Similarly, Admiral Stevens was known forhis accomplishments in aeronautics, and is quoted as having “had a hand in thedesign or conception of all naval aircraft, aircraft carriers and carrierlanding apparatus.”[147] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn147]Admiral Stevens’ aeronautics expertise meant that he was almost certainly awareof what Botta had learned about Nazi aerospace projects beginning in early 1942,after the Los Angeles Air Raid incident. According to William Tompkins, AdmiralStevens was indeed made aware of what the Navy had learned about Nazi Germany’sflying saucer programs.[148] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn148]Documents reveal that Admirals Botta and Stevens did serve together on a lineselection board for Navy Commanders. One document is dated January 6, 1950, andrequests Admiral Botta to the Bureau of Naval Personnel to meet with a number ofother admirals, one of whom was Stevens (see Figure 41). The document confirmsthat Botta and Stevens did meet in the fulfillment of their normal roster ofduties, giving them the opportunity to discuss policy and technical issuesrelated to the development of the Navy’s secret space program. What is importanthere to keep in mind is that around the time Botta and Stevens served on thisBoard, Stevens had been assigned responsibility within the Joint Chiefs of Stafffor clandestine activities and covert operations, as a declassified CIA documentconfirms (see Figure 42).Soon after, Stevens was appointed to be the head of “The Joint Subsidiary PlansDivision,” which was formed in late 1949 under the control of the Joint Chiefsof Staff. Army historian Alfred H. Paddock describes the mission of thisDivision as follows:[To] coordinate the peacetime development of psychological warfare and covertoperations capabilities within the Armed Services, coordinate detailed militaryplans and other agencies of the government, particularly with Department ofState and the Office of Policy Coordination [CIA), and, in wartime, [to] becomethe means by which the JCS would provide continuous direction and guidance inthese specialized fields to commanders under their control.\" Rear Admiral LeslieC. Stevens was selected to be the first chief of the JSPD, although he hadlimited experience in psychological warfare and covert operations. Stevens,assisted by deputies from each of the other services, initially had a smallstaff of six officers. The Army concurred in his nomination.[149][part0000_split_046.html#_edn149]Figure 41. Document Shows Admirals Botta & Stevens Serving on Same Committee[../images/00042.jpeg]Figure 42. Document Showing Admirals Leslie Stevens Involved with CovertOperations[../images/00043.jpeg] While Paddock was unaware of any previous experience Stevens had inpsychological warfare and covert operations, it is hard to envisage the latterbeing given such an important assignment under the Joint Chiefs of Staff withoutany prior experience.Stevens’ aeronautical engineering background suggests that he had become awareof, or was directly involved in, the Navy’s research into the recovered flyingsaucer craft from the Los Angeles Air Raid incident, and of the covertintelligence program being run out of Naval Air Station, San Diego. It is morethan likely that while Botta was handling the debriefing of the 29 navaloperatives out of San Diego, Stevens was involved in other aspects of the sameor a similar program run elsewhere by the Navy.Stevens was awarded a Legion of Merit for: … exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding servicesto the Government of the United States as Assistant Chief of Staff for Materialon the staff of Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet, from 3 November 1944 to 5August 1945. [150] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn150] In such a position, Stevens would have been a key Navy official in assisting theArmy’s Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit to achieve its objectives. These wouldinclude investigating the flying saucer phenomenon in the Pacific theater of thewar, and participating in psychological operations to hide the Unit’s covertoperations. Consequently, it is almost certain that Admirals Botta and Stevenswere early recruits to a covert Navy leadership group that would, beginning inthe late 1940’s, oversee the design and development of the Navy’s space fleetthat would in time join an interplanetary alliance. This fleet would be based onsimilar strategic principles used for the deployment of modern aircraft carrierbattle groups.Being familiar with covert operations and psychological warfare, Admiral Stevensmore than likely was instrumental in revealing intimate details of the Navyspace fleet to his son, whose own wartime military intelligence service wouldhave made him very familiar with psychological warfare, and even the operationsof the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit. This means that after leaving militaryservice in 1945 to resume his playwriting career, Stevens IV would have in alllikelihood continued to have been involved in ongoing psychological warfareoperations.When his father, Admiral Stevens, became the head of “The Joint Subsidiary PlansDivision” in 1949, it is realistic to assume that he recruited his son as amilitary intelligence asset for disseminating key ideas (that were part ofpsychological warfare operations) into his plays and the film/televisionindustry. According to Knowles, this is a possibility many have long suspectedabout Stevens:Stevens, Sr. died in 1956 but his son was himself an intelligence agent duringthe Big One and almost certainly maintained his connections after the war. Infact, some believe he remained on the payroll throughout his Hollywoodcareer.[151] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn151]Tompkins confirmed in an interview that Admiral Stevens played a direct role insetting up a secret Navy space program, and that his son, Leslie Stevens IV, wasaware of what was happening.[152] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn152]Consequently, we know that prior to his death in 1955, Admiral Stevens revealedsignificant classified information about the existence of extraterrestrial lifeand secret space programs to his son. Therefore, Stevens IV was most certainlypart of a Navy sanctioned “soft disclosure” initiative, which strategically usedthe television/movie industry to reveal elements of the Navy’s planned secretspace program. This would be part of a bigger psychological warfare process thatboth prepared the public by hiding the truth in plain sight, while also enablinga means of ridicule for those revealing details of the Navy’s secret spaceprogram without authorization.Exemplifying this process are the recommendations by the 1953 CIA-sponsoredRobertson Panel that issued the Durant Report, which advised the use of the massmedia to “educate” the public about flying saucers. The Durant Reportrecommended debunking flying saucer investigations - by ridiculing the flyingsaucer phenomenon and the possibility of extraterrestrial life—for nationalsecurity reasons. The Report stated: The \"debunking\" aim would result in reduction in public interest in \"flyingsaucers\" which today evokes a strong psychological reaction. This educationcould be accomplished by mass media such as television, motion pictures, andpopular articles.… Such a program should tend to reduce the current gullibilityof the public and consequently their susceptibility to clever hostilepropaganda.[153] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn153] Television and movies would be used as part of a psychological warfare programthat worked with a number of methods to hide the reality of the flyingsaucer/UFO phenomenon, and ridicule those investigating it.A National Security Agency document released by Edward Snowden shows sixdifferent ways in which the general public can be deceived through what they arebeing shown. The document is titled “The Art of Deception: Training for a NewGeneration of Online Covert Operations,” and it contains a graphic illustratingdifferent ways in which the truth can be hidden in plain sight by techniquessuch as “masking” and “mimicking.”[154] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn154]The method of hiding the truth in plain sight would lead to movie and televisionproducers being given partial briefings of classified programs, which would beused for creating new productions. This “soft disclosure” process served thesimultaneous goals of creating a means to debunk UFO researchers by criticsasserting that their claims were based on popular movies/television series, andalso secretly preparing the general public for the truth in case of somecatastrophic extraterrestrial disclosure event, e.g., alien mothershipsappearing over New York City. Figure 43. NSA Document: Different Ways of Hiding the Truth in Plain Sight[../images/00044.jpeg]All of this information helps considerably in finally understanding the natureof the business relationship between Roddenberry and Leslie Stevens IV. Stevenscould not directly create a science fiction show himself to reveal details ofthe classified information given to him by his deceased father or from what hehad learned while serving with Army Intelligence. Instead, however, it is veryplausible that he received permission from Navy officials to share classifiedinformation with television/movie producers such as Roddenberry, who thenfictionalized the information.Rodenberry was not alone among television/movie producers with whom Stevensdivulged classified information through ideas for new movies or televisionseries. In chapter eight, I examine Stevens relationship with Glenn Larson,creator of yet another famous movie/television franchise—“Battlestar Galactica”—which has a unique place in television history. Notably, on March 17, 2009, itsprincipal actors and script writers were invited to a special forum hosted bythe United Nations to discuss lessons learned from the TV series forinterspecies conflict resolution.The business relationship between Gene Roddenberry and Leslie Stevens, suggeststhat Star Trek was initially based on classified information, acquired throughAdmirals Botta and Stevens, and possibly by the younger Stevens’ own directinvolvement in military intelligence operations during and after World War II. Afuture Navy space fleet was to be developed that would actively cooperate withNordic extraterrestrials in an alliance that countered the Nazis and theirReptilian allies. In the Star Trek series, the Nordics were depicted as Vulcans,the Reptilians as Klingons, while the Nazis were represented as geneticallyenhanced humans.Ample evidence suggests Star Trek was no mere science fiction series, but wasactively encouraged through a business arrangement between Roddenberry and theson of a Navy admiral, who had been directly involved in developing a secret USNavy Space Fleet. During the airing of the original Star Trek series from1966-1968, the Navy was taking a significant incremental step towards its secretgoal, which at the time was through the Apollo Moon Program."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6APOLLO & THE NAVY’S NOVA PROGRAM On May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy gave his famous speech before a jointsession of Congress promising to put “a man on the Moon and returning him safelyto the earth” by the end of the decade.[155] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn155]He called for the development of rockets “much larger than any now beingdeveloped, until certain which is superior.” Kennedy’s speech led to majorCongressional funding being provided to NASA for the development of heavy liftrockets to send people and equipment to the Moon. Major aerospace companiesimmediately began competing for the lucrative contracts to build the heavy liftrockets that NASA would require for the Apollo space program, dedicated toachieving Kennedy’s vision.According to William Tompkins, NASA’s Apollo program was only the first stage ofa far more ambitious plan that had been developed by the Navy in the early1950’s. While the Army’s “Project Horizon” planned to put a dozen soldiers onthe Moon for a military/scientific mission by 1966, the Navy planned to have10,000 people on the Moon by the 1970’s as part of a far more extensive mannedlunar bases project.[156] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn156]Tompkins says that NASA, and its various civilian space programs such as Apollo,was designed to be a cover for the Navy’s secret space program; an arrangementboth Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy supported. The Navy would work throughthe ostensibly civilian NASA program to achieve its military space objectives,which were considered to be of the utmost national security concern.Consequently, Tompkins has asserted that “NASA is a Naval militaryorganization.”[157] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn157]His claim here is supported by NASA Researchers, Richard Hoagland and Mike Bara,the authors of Dark Mission who wrote: NASA ostensibly is “a civilian agency exercising control over aeronautical andspace activities sponsored by the United States”… But contrary to common publicand media perception that NASA is an open, strictly civilian scientificinstitution, is the legal fact that the Space Agency was quietly founded as adirect adjunct to the Department of Defense tasked with specifically assistingthe national security of the United States … It says so right in the originalNASA Charter: “Sec 305 … (i) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall beconsidered a defense agency of the United States for the purpose of Chapter 17,Title 35 of the United States Code.”[158] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn158] The Navy’s manned lunar bases program was part of a four-tiered space programcalled Nova, which Tompkins states was to be partially implemented through NASA.Nova was designed, from its inception, to enable the Navy to use conventionalrocket technologies to establish large bases on the Moon and Mars in the 1960’sand 1970’s.According to Tompkins, the Apollo Moon landings were only the first stage of anambitious four stage plan for Nova. Stage 2 of Nova was to put 10,000 people onthe Moon. Stage 3 was to place bases on Mars and other planetary bodies in theSolar System. Finally, Stage 4 was to place manned Navy bases in 12 adjoiningstar systems.[159] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn159]While Nova would enable the attainment of the first two stages, along withinitial elements of the third, it would also require more advanced spacecraftusing antigravity and other exotic propulsion systems to achieve all of stage 3,and especially stage 4. These more advanced craft would be secretly designed anddeveloped in the Navy’s research facilities at China Lake, California, and thenbuilt at a massive underground base in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah, resultingin deep space operations with interstellar travel technologies.It is an accepted fact that the Nova concept of massive rocket launchers wasbeing studied by two major aerospace companies in the early 1960’s that had notbeen awarded contracts for the production stages of the Saturn heavy launchersfor the Apollo Moon missions. According to Encyclopedia Aeronautica:General Dynamics (Convair) and Martin Marietta - were given ‘consolation' studycontracts for Nova in July 1962. Philip Bono of Douglas Aircraftcharacteristically did his own study without a contract. The contractors were tomake preliminary designs of million-pound-payload launch vehicles … Martinhanded in the most comprehensive study, with all possible combinationsevaluated… General Dynamics had the most conservative designs, using existingengines or enormous conventional bell-chamber engines in the 3 million poundthrust class. Bono at Douglas characteristically was optimistic about achievablestage mass fractions and had designs with masses considerably less thancalculated by the other two contractors.[160] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn160]Citing his involvement with the Douglas study, Tompkins says he and otherengineers had utilized various innovative propulsion systems over the years todevelop different configurations for the massive Nova rockets and theirrespective million pound payloads—ten times the payload of the Saturn V rocket:We had spent seven years on-and-off with these concepts before NASA put outrequests for a bid on the Nova space vehicles (Nova was way before Apollo). JimJenkins, Mack Davis, and I spent an enormous amount of time discussing andconceiving these rockets. Our mission in Advanced Design was to analyze thepropulsion scheme, develop configurations, trade-off studies, and design massivespace freight trucks… I personally designed a 600+ foot high, cone-shaped NOVAvehicle…[161] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn161]The Nova study program officially lasted from 1959 until 1964, when funding wascancelled by NASA due to the successful testing and development of the Saturn Vrocket. According to Tompkins, however, Nova continued to be supported behindthe scenes by the Navy, which maintained interest as major aerospace contractorssubmitted unsolicited proposals for Nova’s feasibility. Figure 44. Douglas Design of Nova Rockets[../images/00045.jpeg]During this critical early period in the design and development of heavy liftvehicles for the NASA space program, Tompkins’ 12 year career at Douglas came toa tumultuous end. It is worth reviewing what happened, and how his dismissal ledto him moving over to other major aerospace companies that supported his effortsto get Navy contracts to build the Nova rockets, well after its ostensiblecancelation by NASA.On July 1, 1962, Tompkins took the initiative to go over the heads of theDouglas Aviation Company’s manufacturing division to meet with, and establish apersonal relationship with the head of NASA’s Launch Operations Center (laterrenamed Kennedy Space Center after the JFK assassination), Dr. Kurt Debus.[162][part0000_split_046.html#_edn162] In 1961, after the Kennedy speech pledging toland a man on the moon by the end of the decade, Debus was chosen to direct the“design, development and construction of NASA’s Saturn launch facilities” atCape Canaveral.[163] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn163] He was subsequentlyappointed as the Space Center’s first Director on July 1, 1962; a position heheld until his retirement in November 1974.Tompkins states that he travelled to Cape Canaveral with a detailed model anddesign proposal for the Saturn launch facilities, together with proposals forbuilding and streamlining the Launch Operations Center. He met with both Dr.Debus and Dr. Werner Von Braun. Debus in particular was so impressed byTompkins’ design and detailed knowledge that he approved his plans on the spot,and had him appointed to a number of NASA committees, including the prestigiousLaunch Operations Committee Working Group that Debus personally headed. Thecommittee was set up to design and oversee the construction of the Apollo launchcomplex for both the Saturn and Nova rocket programs. Tompkins recalls whatDebus said after their initial meeting:I am putting you on my Launch Operations Committee, Complex 39 Facility PlanningCommittee, and Mission Planning Committee. Then, I would like you to technicallyconsult my Systems Management Committee, Mission Control Committee, Facilitiesand Complex Pane, Launch Operations Working Group, and Checkout Project Office,and Launch Project Office.[164] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn164]Tompkins has provided a Douglas Aviation Company document that corroborates hisclaim of having been a member of the Launch Operations Committee (L.O.C.)Working Group for the Kennedy Space Center, where he was directly advising Debuson various design proposals. The document refers to Tompkins as “a member of theL.O.C. Facilities Working Group headed by Dr. Debus, Director of L.O.C. forNASA.”Tompkins’ personal relationship with Debus led to him securing a $36 millionsystems engineering contract for the Douglas Aircraft Company.[165][part0000_split_046.html#_edn165] However, by going over the heads of moresenior people, he angered leaders of the powerful Manufacturing Division ofDouglas. This led to Tompkins being fired, and then the decision was rescindeddue to the intervention of his Engineering Division superiors. Finally he wasfired again, for a second time, by the Douglas Aviation Company on May 4, 1963.According to Dr. Robert Wood, who worked at the Douglas Aircraft Company, andits successor McDonnell Douglas, for a total of 43 years, he vividly recalls thefiring incident(s) described by Tompkins.[166] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn166]He says it was big news at Douglas at the time that someone was fired forgetting a large contract with NASA by going over the heads of more seniorDouglas officials. Years later, in 2009, Wood would eventually meet Tompkins anddecide to help him publish his autobiography by becoming its editor.In chapter four, it was explained that Nordic extraterrestrials had infiltratedthe Douglas Aircraft Company and were covertly assisting Tompkins with thedesigns of kilometers-long Navy spacecraft. This assistance also includeddesigns for the Nova heavy launch vehicles, and later the Saturn rockets for theApollo program. His firing incidents were orchestrated, according to Tompkins,by Reptilian extraterrestrials who were controlling key personnel in theManufacturing Division of Douglas. Their goal was to sabotage Douglas AircraftCompany efforts to assist the Apollo program. Figure 45. Douglas Memo Showing Tompkins in Debus' NASA Working Group[../images/00046.jpeg] After noting the disappearance of two engineers from the Engineering Division,Tompkins says he told a colleague:There must be Reptilians at the very top of manufacturing management in Douglas.They are preventing us from implementing all of our engineering proposals that Ihave presented to Douglas Corporate to manage all of the NASA Moon and Marsmission programs.[167] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn167]Offering a further explanation, Tompkins reveals that the Reptilians couldinfiltrate Douglas by using advanced technologies that made them appearphysically human. He said: “some of the Nordic aliens in the Douglas shop whom Ithought were helping us, may be disguised Reptilians, and this could behappening now in NAA [North American Aviation], too.”[168][part0000_split_046.html#_edn168] Subsequently, Tompkins summarizes the complexsituation involving different extraterrestrial groups that had infiltrateddifferent companies to either help or sabotage the Navy and Apollo programs:My main concern … is why the hell are the Nordics pushing us to the Moon, butthose damn Reptilians, who seem to look like the Nordics, are throwing wrenchesinto the gears?[169] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn169]Furthermore, Tompkins contends that Debus was very knowledgeable about theNordic extraterrestrials that had been helping Maria Orsic establish the firstGerman Vril flying saucer prototypes.[170] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn170]Debus was himself, according to Tompkins, telepathically in touch with Nordicextraterrestrials who were working behind the scenes to help the Apollo Programsucceed. In a later interview, Tompkins described how his initial meeting withDebus was orchestrated by his Nordic extraterrestrial secretary from Douglas,who made it possible for him to overcome many obstacles in order to meet withDebus. [171] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn171] My secretary had said before we even went down there that I've written you aletter which will introduce you to the top people in NASA, but you're nevergoing to use it. So then she did all of that stuff where I'm driving into thatzone arsenal, the secret area, and the secret doors, gates, opened withoutstopping me. The armed guards don't grab me and shoot me… And all of thesethings happened exactly as she told me it would.She also told me not to believe a lot of the stuff that the German guys wouldsay. But Dr. Debus, to me, even though von Braun was the top guy, Debus somehowimmediately, right after I started talking, became a friend. And I can'tdescribe it any other way. And virtually, I couldn't say anything wrong.[172][part0000_split_046.html#_edn172]The connection that both Tompkins and Debus had with Nordic extraterrestrialswas a key factor in why they established a strong personal rapport from theirfirst meeting.After being sacked for the final time by Douglas in May 1963, it was Debus whoput Tompkins in touch with his next employer, North American Aviation (NAA).Tompkins summarizes the situation as follows:Because of my unsolicited, major change to the entire Apollo Moon proposal ayear earlier, I was fired at Douglas. This was for going over corporate heads.My [July 1, 1962] presentation was to the two most important space people on theplanet. Dr. Kurt Debus and Dr. von Braun, the head of NASA… Dr. Debus was soimpressed with my depth of [knowledge of] the alien threats and theirimplications with the Apollo and Naval missions that he appointed me to hisMission Launch Control and Facilities Planning Committees. A call to Dr. Debusand I was on board the next week at North American Aviation, Rocketdyne, a NAAdivision and Nucleonics, also a division of NAA, at a director level in advancedtechnologies research. [173] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn173]From 1963 to 1966, Tompkins worked at the Rocketdyne Division of North American(now part of Boeing), and took with him many of the advanced spacecraft designshe had developed at Douglas.During his Rocketdyne employment, Tompkins relates how he successfully persuadedmanagement to replicate what he had been doing at Douglas in terms of sendingunsolicited proposals to the Navy to win contracts for classified programs.[174][part0000_split_046.html#_edn174] Tompkins got Rocketdyne managers to approve anunsolicited bid to build Nova heavy lift vehicles based on the old DouglasAircraft proposals he had previously worked on.Tompkins says that he was now being assisted by two different female Nordicextraterrestrials, other than those at Douglas. They were helping him solve thecomplex engineering design problems for building large rocket systems such asNova and the Saturn V, which he also worked on at Rocketdyne. He wrote that thetwo Nordics were “aliens assigned here to see that the Apollo Moon program willaccomplish its goals.”[175] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn175]Tompkins prepared a business plan for Rocketdyne which incorporated some of theinnovative propulsion technologies he had studied at Douglas for interstellartravel, as well as more conventional rocket technologies for Nova missionsthroughout the solar system:These included interplanetary, manned Mars, Venus, Mercury and deep space, majorsolar system planets, or their habitable moons. I conceived and they developednaval bases on all of them… the availability of the improved NOVA truck vehiclerockets into naval scout ships will considerably increase the effectiveness ofearly solar system, manned naval planetary Moon, Mars fly-by and stationmissions. It will also increase development of the naval Mars base operation.[176] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn176]This culminated in a detailed systems engineering plan for colonizing our ownand adjacent solar systems. The North American systems plan was to use thepowerful Nova rockets as a critical aspect for colonization. Tompkins says thathis lack of enthusiasm for incorporating nuclear propulsion systems into hisdesigns for future Navy spacecraft came to be resented by senior figures atRocketdyne.During this time, one of his old Douglas bosses encouraged him to move over toTRW where his advanced design and engineering skills would be better utilized:Noel Crates, my old Douglas Delta-II Thor DM-18 missile Boss who had resignedDouglas after I was fired, had accepted a research position at the TRW spaceThink Tank at Redondo Beach, near LAX…. For years, Noel constantly tried to getme to switch over from North American Rocketdyne to TRW saying, “Bill, this isthe center of the Galaxy where the action is, it is all happening at TRW. Youmust get on the staff here. There is a lot of that they are not aware of, forsome reason, you do understand. There are literally hundreds of classifiedprojects that need your big picture evaluation. Bill, in many ways you are lightyears ahead of them.[177] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn177]Come 1966, Tompkins’ interest in antigravity over nuclear propulsion led to himbeing booted out of Rocketdyne’s Nucleonics, and so he finally took up hisfriend’s offer to move over to the greener pastures of TRW (acquired by NorthrupGrumann in 2002). Tompkins spent the next four years (1967-1971) at TRW, andsays he found much support for his innovative design and engineering ideas fordifferent space propulsion systems at TRW’s futuristic campus at Redondo Beach:TRW is the most fantastic space Think Tank campus at the tip of this southwestarm of the galaxy. It has been addressing extraterrestrial threats, conceivingNaval space battle groups and weapons to process these threats since 1960.[178][part0000_split_046.html#_edn178]Due to his background in Naval intelligence and success in getting major Navycontracts when working at Douglas and Rocketdyne, Tompkins was given multipleTRW projects to work on.[179] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn179] This included aNova proposal by TRW, where the company eventually won the much sought afterNavy contract. Tompkins wrote:After extensive evaluation of hundreds of research projects, involving everypossible concept to unconventional space population and 14 major classes ofNaval space ships, from fighter to 2.5 kilometer-long intergalactic battlecruisers, an unsolicited system development plan was conceived and submitted toONI [Office of Naval Intelligence] and ONR [Office of Naval Research], alongwith countless Apollo/NOVA lunar, planet and star missions projects. Iaccomplished those missions, several years later, at TRW. [180][part0000_split_046.html#_edn180]However, Tompkins said that the covert Navy plan for developing Nova in order toplace 10,000 personnel on the Moon came to a crushing end during the Apollo 11mission. At the time of the Apollo Moon landing, Tompkins was working for TRW,which was responsible for a range of critical components used in Apollospacecraft. TRW personnel received the same telemetry viewed at the LaunchOperations Center/Kennedy Space Center for Apollo Moon missions. As a TRWemployee, there is no reason to doubt Tompkins’ account of being physicallypresent among a large contingent of staff at TRW’s Redondo Beach “Space Park”headquarters to witness the Moon landing.During the Apollo 11 Moon landing in July 1969, Tompkins states that televisioncameras from the Apollo Lander provided a live feed of what was being witnessedby Armstrong and Aldrin. Next, Tompkins explains how Armstrong and Aldrin weremet by a fleet of extraterrestrial spaceships that were ominously close to theApollo Lunar Lander:The Landing Module (LEM) actually impacted the Moon surface in the Sea ofTranquility Crater, which had tremendous size vehicles parked around part of itsrim. When astronaut Neil Armstrong made that First Step for Man on the Moon helooked up to the edge of the crater and said to mission control: “There areother ships here, they are enormous. The public did not hear that statement orsee the massive alien starships. Armstrong panned his camera in a 360 degreemotional all around the crater and the CIA then classified the information asway above top secret.[181] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn181]Tompkins drew a picture (Figure 46) of what he, along with other TRW and NASApersonnel, witnessed on the Apollo live feed camera.Incredibly, Tompkins says an alien voice was clearly heard over the Apollo 11radio transmission: “Finish a total of six of your Apollo missions; take yourphotos, pick up some rocks, go home, and don’t come back.”[182][part0000_split_046.html#_edn182] How this threatening action by one or moreextraterrestrial groups effectively put an end to the Apollo program, as well asthe Navy’s covert Nova program for manned Moon bases, is described by Tompkinsthis way: “The NO TRESPASSING sign went up. With the program over, everybodywent home, and nearly all 400,000 NASA and contractor employees got the pinkslip.”[183] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn183]What Tompkins clearly outlines he saw happen via the NASA live feed of the Moonlanding is consistent with HAM radio intercepts of the live feed, and the claimsof former NASA employee Otto Bender. According to Bender, the Apollo 11astronauts transmitted that they were being watched by large alien vehicles. Figure 46. UFOs Tompkins Witnessed on NASA Live Feed During Apollo 11 Landing[../images/00047.jpeg] Bender confirmed that HAM radio operators had indeed intercepted VHF signalstransmitted from Apollo 11 to NASA’s Houston headquarters with the followingmessage, which NASA screened from the public:Mission Control: What’s there ? Mission Control calling Apollo 11.Apollo 11: These babies are huge, sir … enormous….Oh, God, you wouldn’t believeit! I’m telling you there are other space craft out there… lined up on the farside of the crater edge… they’re on the moon watching us.[184][part0000_split_046.html#_edn184]On August 27, 2012, Dr. Steven Greer, Founder of the Disclosure Project,revealed that he spoke with close relatives of both Armstrong and Aldrin who hadbeen told the truth about what the astronauts saw on the moon:Close friends and very close family members of both Neil Armstrong and BuzzAldrin have separately told me that indeed there were numerous, large UFOsaround the crater where the Lunar Module landed and that these were seen by bothArmstrong and Aldrin. I have also spoken to military officers that have seen thefootage of this event – but it has never been made public.[185][part0000_split_046.html#_edn185]Greer’s testimony is significant since it supports Tompkins’ claim that therewas a live video feed recording what Armstrong and Aldrin were seeing.So why did NASA eventually terminate the Apollo missions if extraterrestrialvisitors were there and watching the Earth? The answer according to Armstrong,as relayed by an unnamed Professor at a NASA symposium, is as follows:Professor: What really happened out there with Apollo 11?Armstrong: It was incredible … of course, we had always known there was apossibility … the fact is, we were warned off. There was never any questionsthen of a space station or a moon city.Professor: How do you mean “warned off”?Armstrong: I can’t go into details, except to say that their ships were farsuperior to ours both in size and technology – Boy, where they big! … andmenacing …. No, there is no question of a space station.Professor: But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11?Armstrong: Naturally – NASA was committed at that time, and couldn’t risk apanic on earth…. But it really was a quick scoop and back again.[186][part0000_split_046.html#_edn186]The unnamed Professor was first quoted by Timothy Good in his ground breakingbook, Above Top Secret, and he corroborates Tompkins’ claim that NASA wasverbally warned off the moon, and that there were plans to build a “moon city.”The city was in fact planned to be a Navy base that was part of the Novaprogram.The extraterrestrial occupants of the large starships intimidating the Apollo 11mission did not want the US Navy establishing a beachhead for future militarybases on the Moon. By preventing the Navy from moving forward with its plan toput 10,000 people on the Moon using a number of Nova rocket launchers throughoutthe 1970’s, the Nova program effectively came to a crushing end in July 1969.It would take the Navy more than a decade before it could complete theconstruction of its first antigravity space vehicles as part of its secret spaceprogram. This was achieved with the covert assistance of Nordicextraterrestrials, despite the sabotaging efforts of Reptilians embedded withinthe military industrial complex. According to Tompkins and other whistleblowers,the first Navy space battle groups were deployed in the early 1980’s during theReagan Administration, thereby establishing a US Navy presence in deep space forthe first time.[187] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn187] During this period,Tompkins retired from the aerospace industry. In the late 1980’s, he began a newmission of covertly preparing Navy personnel and their children for a futurewhere open contact with extraterrestrial life, and knowledge of the secret spaceprograms, would become widespread."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7EXTRATERRESTRIAL “SPECIAL PROJECTS” AT THE NAVY LEAGUE William Tompkins has revealed that from the late 1980’s to 1999, he was givenpermission to create a number of “Special Projects” involving extraterrestriallife and advanced technologies at a council of the Navy League of the UnitedStates. The purpose was to use this civilian organization as a vehicle foreducating retired Navy officers and their children about the reality of thesepressing issues.The Navy League is a national organization with approximately 40,000 members inmore than 220 councils around the world. It provides support for the Navy andits sister sea services. Founded in 1902, it launched with the encouragement ofPresident Theodore Roosevelt who said: “Give hearty support to the policy whichthe Navy League is Founded to Further.”[188] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn188]The Navy League describes itself as: “the foremost citizens’ organization toserve, support and stand with all the sea services—the US Navy, US Marine Corps,US Coast Guard and US-flag Merchant Marine.”[189][part0000_split_046.html#_edn189]Tompkins created the Navy League Rogue Valley Council in Medford, Oregon in1991, and became its inaugural President. His prior work for Naval Intelligenceand leading aerospace contractors, from 1942 to 1984, had led him to theconclusion that the Navy League had an important role to play when it came tothe topic of extraterrestrial life and advanced technologies. This was aconclusion that was shared by senior officials in the Navy League and hiscontacts in Naval Intelligence.Previous chapters have discussed Tompkins participation in various aspects ofthe Navy’s secret space program as it went from the early design phase in the1950’s, leading to detailed architectural and systems engineering plans fortheir construction in the 1970’s, and finally to the space battle groups beingdeployed in the early 1980’s. Coinciding with the deployment of the Navy’ssecret space battle groups, Tompkins “officially retired” from the aerospaceindustry in 1984. He then began a new phase in his already remarkable career.Tompkins would now educate select Navy officers and their children aboutextraterrestrial life and technology to prepare them for a world where theexistence of alien life and an interstellar Navy space program became commonknowledge.In January 1984, Tompkins moved to Medford, Oregon where a high concentration ofreserve and retired Navy officers resided. He says that he later attended a NavyLeague National Convention in Seattle, Washington. Conversations with seniorNavy officers and members of the Navy League led to him receiving support for aplan to develop a series of Navy led “Special Projects” dealing with theextraterrestrial topic.Tompkins wrote a letter to Rear Admiral Larry Marsh, Commander of Naval BaseSeattle and head of Submarine Group Nine at Bangor, Washington (from September1990 to June 1992), requesting permission to have a group of retired Navypersonnel take a ride on a submarine. Tompkins says he also let the Admiral knowof his plans to form a Navy League Council in Medford. The Navy is very careful when it comes to who it allows on its nuclearsubmarines, according to Tompkins, and does strict security checks. Presumably,after doing a security check on Tompkins, Admiral Marsh decided to not onlygrant permission for the submarine ride, but he would also take what Tompkinsdescribes as a rare step, by personally traveling down to Medford and presidingover the inauguration ceremony for Medford’s Rogue Valley Navy League Council.Public records verify that the Admiral did travel to Medford where he met withTompkins and the other retired or reserve Navy officers, and formallyparticipated in the launch of the Rogue Valley Council Navy League. A photoappears below of Tompkins meeting with Admiral Marsh at the opening ceremony forthe Council in 1991. Figure 47. Bill Tompkins & Admiral Larry Marsh at Opening of Navy League RogueValley Council in 1991[../images/00048.jpeg]Later, Tompkins and fellow Navy League officials travelled to Seattle for theirsubmarine ride, and he reports that Admiral Marsh privately met with him theretoo. Tompkins recalls specifically discussing the extraterrestrial phenomenonand UFO sightings in the Seattle area with the Admiral. Marsh, according toTompkins, in turn related some of his own direct knowledge of extraterrestriallife and technology, and how this was being developed for a Navy secret spaceprogram. Tompkins further states that Admiral Marsh had been briefed about theNavy’s secret space program, and approved the “Special Projects” that Tompkinsplanned to implement at the Medford Navy League Council.It’s worth pointing out that service on submarines has many similarities toservice in space. Indeed here, Tompkins points out that the first Navy prototypespacecraft were in fact converted submarines. In an interview, he explained thatthese prototypes were first developed in the 1950’s using submarines:And at Douglas, in the secret think tank, we were looking at every type of spacevehicle we would need to go out into the galaxy, then our U.S. Navy. Sosubmarines came up and we discussed this. We said, “That's the easiest thing,the quickest way, we can get out there. We'll just take a regular Navysubmarine, pull out the whole nuclear system, put in the anti-gravitationalsystem, and we're going to use these right away.”[190][part0000_split_046.html#_edn190]Historical records show that the first nuclear powered submarine, the USSNautilus (SSN-571), became operational in 1955.[191][part0000_split_046.html#_edn191] This makes Tompkins’ scenario possible, sinceit was feasible for a “Nautilus class” of spacecraft to be based on convertednuclear powered submarines. Tompkins says that converted submarines were firstdeployed in space in the 1970’s as a prelude to the deployment of the largerkilometers-long spacecraft.[192] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn192] Figure 48. First \"Nautilus Class\" Nuclear Submarine Built for US Navy by GeneralDynamics[../images/00049.jpeg] As the commander of the Submarine Group Nine facility, it is probable thatAdmiral Marsh would have at least known of the idea of “Nautilus class”spacecraft, especially considering that training of personnel would have beenvery similar to the conventional training of crews on nuclear poweredsubmarines. This connection would support Tompkins’ claim that Marsh wasfamiliar with the Navy’s secret space program, and could have revealed some ofthis in their second meeting. Figure 49. Tompkins with Navy League Members Who Took a Ride on the NuclearPowered Submarine USS Alaska SSBN 732[../images/00050.jpeg] Of critical importance, if Tompkins was helping to prepare Sea Cadets associatedwith the Navy League for future space operations with the Navy’s secret spaceprogram, “Solar Warden,” then their training would have been invaluably assistedby instructors who were familiar with the conventional training of crews formodern nuclear powered submarines.[193] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn193]Tompkins emphasized in an interview that the submarine visit was not merely ajoy ride, but was a vital component of one of the “Special Projects” to beundertaken at the Rogue Valley Council in training personnel for future spacemissions.[194] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn194]Tompkins later met with Rear Admiral Hugh Webster, President of the San DiegoCouncil and corporate director at the national level of the Navy League. Duringtheir meeting, Tompkins says that he shared with Webster some of his knowledgeabout extraterrestrial projects he had been involved in during his Navy andaerospace career. Admiral Webster, prior to his 1991 retirement, was Commanderof the Operational Test and Evaluation Force.[195][part0000_split_046.html#_edn195] Previously he had served as Commander of theNaval Surface Group Western Pacific (Commander Task Force (CTF) 73/CTF 75).[196][part0000_split_046.html#_edn196] On November 1, 1986, Admiral Webster led thefirst visit to China in 40 years. From 1978 to 1980, he was commander of the USSEngland DLG/CG-22.Moreover, Tompkins says he also received Admiral Webster’s full support for hisplans to develop a series of Navy led “Special Projects” dealing with the alientopic. Accepting Tompkins’ testimony, this means that two navy admirals, Marshand Webster, were familiar with the “Special Projects” he was leading atMedford, Oregon.Later, in 2001, Tompkins says Admiral Webster gave him permission to discloseall he knew about the Navy’s involvement in extraterrestrial related projects inhis planned autobiography. On the back cover of Selected by Extraterrestrials,Tompkins recalls the conversation he had with Webster: Early in 2001 I called on Admiral Hugh Webster, Navy League Corporate Director,Washington DC and San Diego CA. We had a five hour meeting on my ongoingbook–writing concerning the extraterrestrial threats to our planet. AfterAdmiral Webster read portions of my document and backup technical documentation,I asked Hugh, “How much of this can I include in a published book?” He said.“Bill; TELL IT ALL. This is most important to our country. Don’t leave anythingout.”[197] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn197] Figure 50. Rear Admiral Hugh L. Webster & Admiral Xinchun Ma Celebrating theFirst Visit by US Navy Ships to China in 40 Years[../images/00051.jpeg]As the inaugural President of the Rogue Valley Council, Tompkins was soon afterpromoted to Vice President of the Navy League for the entire State of Oregon. Hehas supplied documents confirming that he was indeed assigned to these verysenior positions within the Navy League, despite not having previously been amember. This is highly unusual and would only have occurred through the approvalof top senior figures at the national leadership for the Navy League, such asAdmirals Marsh and Webster, as Tompkins claims.In his autobiography, Tompkins describes his main mission in creating the NavyLeague Council in Medford:Created Southwest Navy League Council [Medford] with 37 top Navy officers, the“special projects” group, pilots from various employers, all working on alieninteraction projects.”[198] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn198]Later, in an interview in March 2016, Tompkins further added:You’ve got a hand out of Navy people responsible for this Navy League Councilthat I started up in Oregon, and we had specific missions up there withextraterrestrials, particularly in large mountains up there. It’s interestingthat if you read that little list of names how many of these personnel, who wereout of the Navy, but are still in the Reserve, are pilots, Navy pilots,Commanders or Captains. I happened to have one of the largest groups in thecountry in this Navy League, supporting extraterrestrial missions.[199][part0000_split_046.html#_edn199]One of his immediate tasks was to set up a Command, Communications and Controlsystem for the Navy League’s Medford Council. To achieve this, Tompkins set upthe “Sea Cadets” in which junior high school children of navy officers andothers would be given a basic education of naval maritime and aerospaceoperations.Tompkins was able to secure 14 computers from the Miramar Naval Air Station(previously used for F-14 flight training) for this purpose. He says that thecommand and control system (CIC), which was set up for the Sea Cadets, wasplanned for use as a means of educating Navy officers and “sea cadets” aboutextraterrestrial and secret space operations. Figure 51. Letter Thanking Miramar NAS for Computer Systems for CIC Simulator[../images/00052.jpeg]Significantly, Tompkins has supplied documents to support his remarkable claims.One of these documents confirms the computer systems given to him by the MiramarNaval Air Station (see Figure 51).Another document is a hand out prepared by Tompkins for the Navy League,describing the deep space and extraterrestrial operations project being set upat the Navy League. He refers to the operations system that was being set up asa “Special Project.” Figure 52. Special Projects for Inter-Galactic Operations[../images/00053.jpeg] Yet another document confirms that “Special Projects” were indeed beingdiscussed and conducted at the Navy League in Medford, as Tompkins claims. Thisdocument is the minutes of a meeting held on October 5, 1993. It confirms thatTompkins was President of the Rogue Valley Council [Medford].Most importantly, the “Minutes” confirm that an item on the agenda was a reportby a “Special Projects Committee.” Tompkins says that this Committee was incharge of six “Special Projects” with each having their own sub-committee. Onewas the “Inter-Galactic Operations Special Project” according to the previousdocument. Figure 53. Minutes of Meeting Featuring Special Projects Committee[../images/00054.jpeg]In private interviews, Tompkins has described some of the other “SpecialProjects” that he says he was directly involved in. One involved reports ofUFO’s seen entering and leaving Mount Shasta, which was believed to be anextraterrestrial base. Pilots affiliated with the Navy League would fly aroundthe mountain to find entrances, and all-terrain vehicles were employed for thesame purpose.Another “Special Project” dealt specifically with programs on “extended life.”Tompkins says that while he worked at TRW from 1967 to 1971, one of the programshe was assigned to concerned extending life. Tompkins claims that TRW madeimportant breakthroughs in developing pharmaceutical products that could extendlife through the principle of age-regression. In Insiders Reveal Secret SpacePrograms and Extraterrestrial Life, one chapter discusses the testimonies ofCorey Goode, Randy Cramer and Michael Relfe, who all claim to have experiencedage-regression technology as part of their respective “20 and back” service withsecret space programs. Tompkins has since confirmed that age-regression is astandard practice for many personnel in the “20 and back” programs.[200][part0000_split_046.html#_edn200]Support for Tompkins’ testimony comes from geneticists who have recentlypublicly identified the genes that control the aging process. In stunningexperiments, the results of which have been released in peer reviewed scientificjournals, geneticists have demonstrated that they were able to reverse the agingprocess to varying degrees of success. The lead genetic scientist in thepublicly announced age reversal studies is Dr. David Sinclair, who discussed ina November 2014 interview the results of his genetic experiments first conductedon mice:We’ve discovered genes that control how the body fights against ageing and thesegenes, if you turn them on just the right way, they can have very powerfuleffects, even reversing ageing – at least in mice so far… We fed them amolecule that’s called NMN and this reversed ageing completely within just aweek of treatment in the muscle, and now we’re looking to reverse all aspects ofageing if possible.[201] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn201]Yet, another “Special Project” was a contact program where personnel could meetand interact with Nordic extraterrestrials at a remote mountain location in theCascades. Tompkins has described how holographic technologies were used to helpparticipants learn about the history of extraterrestrial life, and theirinteractions with Earth. It is worth repeating that according to Tompkins,Nordic extraterrestrials were covertly helping the Navy in a project that wouldfacilitate open cooperation between them in the future. "},{"pageContent":"CORROBORATING TOMPKINS’ TESTIMONY & DOCUMENTS Tompkins has privately supplied a November 1995 list of Navy, Marine, and AirForce officers, along with local officials who participated in the Navy League,Medford Council. From this list, I was able to locate two Navy officers. In aphone conversation, each confirmed serving with Tompkins. Both of their namesalso appear in the October 1993 “Minutes of Meeting” document presented earlier.First, I spoke with Art Lumley (Commander, USN ret.) on May 19, 2016, who at thetime was the serving President of the Rogue Valley Council Navy League.[202][part0000_split_046.html#_edn202] Lumley served for 20 years with the Navy andNavy Reserve, and then worked for 26 years as a pilot with United Airlines,retiring as a Captain. He recalled that extraterrestrial life was a topicdiscussed in “Special Projects” as areas of interest for the Rogue ValleyCouncil during the time that Tompkins was President. He said that Tompkins wouldraise the extraterrestrial topic in discussions, and it was known among councilmembers that he was an expert on the topic. Lumley said he does not recall anydirect involvement in such projects himself, but did recall Tompkins’ discussionof them.Next, I talked with Larry Boeck (Captain, USN ret.) on May 24, 2016. His navalservice spanned 25 years and he retired as a Captain in the US Naval Reserve in1995. During his career he commanded five Naval Reserve units. Captain Boecksaid that while he does not recall any direct involvement in “Special Projects”himself, he does remember Tompkins talking about extraterrestrial life andgiving reports to committee members about them. He also remembered Tompkinsdiscussing hologram technologies as a means of educating Navy League personneland Sea Cadets. Boeck stated that Tompkins was very knowledgeable about theextraterrestrial topic, and researched it a lot. He said that due to Tompkins’knowledge and contacts, he found him very credible when it came to the topic ofextraterrestrial life.Finally, on November 1, 2016, I spoke by phone with Admiral Marsh too, whoconfirmed key parts of Tompkins’ story. He recalled having had communicationswith Tompkins about plans to launch a chapter of the Navy League in Medford,Oregon, and that Tompkins had requested permission to visit the naval submarinefacility at Bangor, Seattle. Admiral Marsh also remembered meeting with Tompkinsin Medford, Oregon, where they discussed the creation of the Navy League, whichwas a challenging organizational process. He said he vividly recalled Tompkins’interest and knowledge about earthquakes and this topic’s relevance for Navaloperations.I asked Admiral Marsh why he had decided to attend the opening of the NavyLeague Council in Medford, and he said that it was regarded as an importantevent for the Navy League, which prior had no official presence in that regionof Oregon. At least in part, this corroborates Tompkins belief that it wasindeed unusual for an active admiral to launch a Navy League Council. Tompkins says that he met with Admiral Marsh a second time, this time inSeattle, where they discussed “Special Projects” involving UFOs andextraterrestrial life. I asked the Admiral whether he recalled this secondmeeting and the topics Tompkins said were discussed. Admiral Marsh stated thathe didn’t recall the second meeting, but included that he was not surprised thatTompkins was interested in UFOs and extraterrestrial life given his wide rangeof interests. The admiral added that he had no direct knowledge of the subjectof extraterrestrial life. Then he further explained that due to his heavyschedule with many daily meetings with many members of the general public, itwas very possible he did meet with Tompkins in Seattle even though he didn’trecall it. However, he did recall that Tompkins and his Navy League colleaguesdid complete the submarine ride at the Submarine Group Nine facility at Bangor,which he was in charge of at the time. "},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSION With regard to the Navy League in Oregon being involved in a number ofextraterrestrial related “Special Projects” from at least 1991 to 1999, Tompkinshas provided documents that support his key claims. The most significantdocument is the 1993 “Minutes” of a meeting discussing reports by a “SpecialProjects Committee,” and the names of officials attending that meeting.Critically, two officials of the Navy League at the time, who are identified onthe “Minutes” document, have confirmed their participation in the Rogue ValleyCouncil meetings and Tompkins’ reports and discussions concerningextraterrestrial related projects. Both Captain Boeck and Commander/CaptainLumley acknowledged that Tompkins was viewed by members of the Rogue ValleyCouncil as an expert on the extraterrestrial issue and advanced aerospacetechnologies. In addition, Admiral Marsh has confirmed that Tompkins wasregarded quite highly by senior figures in the Navy League at the nationallevel, and that Tompkins was very knowledgeable about topics of interest to theNavy.[203] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn203]What adds a further layer of credibility to Tompkins’ claims is the testimony ofCatherine Austin Fitts, a former Assistant Secretary of the Department ofHousing and Urban Development. She says that in 1998, she was told that the Navyhad initiated a plan to adjust its operations for a future where it is openlyknown that extraterrestrials exist and live among us. Fitts was asked toparticipate in strategy sessions that were being conducted by the ArlingtonInstitute, a non-profit organization headed by John Peterson, which was assigneda number of Navy contracts. Back in September 2002, Fitts wrote:In 1998, I was approached by John Peterson, head of the Arlington Institute, asmall high quality military think tank in Washington, DC… John asked me to helphim with a high level strategic plan Arlington was planning to undertake for theUndersecretary of the Navy…. I met with a group of high level people in themilitary in the process --- including the Undersecretary. According to John, thepurpose of the plan … was to help the Navy adjust their operations for a worldin which it was commonly known that aliens exist and live among us.[204][part0000_split_046.html#_edn204]In support of her testimony, Fitts later released the “Minutes” of a March 26,1999 Board of Directors meeting which confirm that discussions ofextraterrestrial life were being conducted by the Arlington Institute, as atleast one of its contracts—very likely with the Navy— required.[205][part0000_split_046.html#_edn205]It is more than coincidental that while Tompkins was conducting extraterrestrial“Special Projects” out of the Rogue Valley Council of the Navy League from 1991to 1999, aiming to educate Navy personnel and their children aboutextraterrestrial life, that the Arlington Institute was doing something verysimilar on the other side of the country in 1998. In both cases, senior Navyofficials had authorized these initiatives through private civilianorganizations.Consequently, documents and the supporting testimony of two Navy officersconfirm that from 1991 to 1999, the Medford Council of the Navy League diddiscuss extraterrestrial related activities that were occurring in “SpecialProjects.” A third Navy officer, Admiral Marsh, corroborates Tompkins’ expertiseand connections in a variety of more conventional topics, e.g., earthquakestudies, which he thought might be connected to the extraterrestrial topic.Marsh’s command of Submarine Group Nine at Bangor, and the permission he gave toTompkins and his colleagues to be provided a tour of a submarine while inoperation, does raise the possibility that this was done to aid one of Tompkins’“Special Projects.”All this supports Tompkins’ claims that he had set up a number of “SpecialProjects” in Medford, Oregon, aimed at educating Navy and other militarypersonnel, along with their children enrolled in the Sea Cadets, aboutextraterrestrial life and technology, and training for a secret Navy spaceprogram. In doing so, Tompkins had the direct support of senior leaders in thenational organization of the Navy League. More significantly, he had the supportof high level officials in the Department of the Navy who approved for a busyRear Admiral, holding two command positions, to attend the 1991 opening ceremonyof the Rogue Valley Navy League Council. "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8BATTLESTAR GALACTICA & THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THREAT On March 17, 2009, a select group of United Nations officials learned about warand peace from the perspective of those living on an extraterrestrial mothershipwith much battle experience against a form of artificial intelligence bent onhuman genocide. It was not however real-life extraterrestrial veteransimparting their knowledge of war and peace in space, but the creators and castmembers from the popular TV series, Battlestar Galactica.Special significance marks this United Nations Panel event because theBattlestar Galactica series was created by Glenn Larson, another protégé ofLeslie Stevens IV. In chapter five, I presented elements surrounding the unusualbusiness relationship between Stevens and Gene Rodenberry, and the conclusionthat Rodenberry was told about a secret Navy Space Program. Due to Stevens’military intelligence background and briefings he received from his father, ViceAdmiral Leslie Stevens III, he was privy to classified information that became akey inspirational force behind Rodenberry’s Star Trek.Stevens had a similar business relationship with Larson, and in fact wrote theoriginal script for the Battlestar Galactica pilot episode. This raises theintriguing possibility that key elements of Battlestar Galactica are based onreal life threats in space as perceived by senior Navy officials running asecret space program. As a prelude to examining this space threat, it is firstworth learning what the United Nations thought it would gain from its BattlestarGalactica Panel.The United Nations Department of Public Information (DPI) and the Sci Fi channelco-hosted the panel, which was scheduled a day before the closing finale to thefour season series. The panel explored “themes of importance to both the UnitedNations and Battlestar Galactica\" as described by a March 16, 2009 UnitedNations Press Release: UNITED NATIONS PUBLIC INFORMATION DEPARTMENT, SCI FI CHANNEL TO CO-HOST PANELWITH BATTLESTAR GALACTICA CREATORS TO RAISE PROFILE OF HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS… The discussion will explore some of the themes that are of importance to boththe United Nations and the critically acclaimed television show: human rights;terrorism; children and armed conflict; and reconciliation and dialogue amongcivilizations and faiths.[206] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn206]The Press Release went on to mention the panel participants and that it would bemoderated by Whoopi Goldberg—who had previously starred as a popular characterin Rodenberry’s Star Trek: The Next Generation:The panel will be moderated by Academy Award-winning actress and producer WhoopiGoldberg. Oscar-nominated actress Mary McDonnell, Emmy Award-winning andOscar-nominated actor Edward James Olmos, and Battlestar Galactica creators andexecutive producers Ronald D. Moore and David Eick will participate in thepanel.Also participating will be Radhika Coomaraswamy, Special Representative of theSecretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict; Craig Mokhiber, DeputyDirector, New York Office, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights;Robert Orr, Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Planning, Executive Office ofthe Secretary-General; and Famatta Rose Osode, Minister and Deputy PermanentRepresentative, Permanent Mission of Liberia to the United Nations.The Press Release explained what it was about the Battlestar Galactica seriesthat was of special relevance to the United Nations:“As one of the launch projects of the Creative Community Outreach Initiative,this event will show how skillful storytelling can elevate the profile ofcritical humanitarian issues,” said Kiyo Akasaka, United NationsUnder-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information. “Not onlydoes it present an opportunity for creative discussion, but, more importantly,it offers a chance to deliver a message about the many harsh realities thatstill exist worldwide.”The Press Release then described some of the topical content of the BattlestarGalactica series and why this contributed to it winning numerous awards andaccolades:Battlestar Galactica is the gripping saga of humanity’s last remnants and theirstruggle to find a new home while fleeing from their deadly Cylon enemies. Itsissues-driven topicality and command performances have garnered it numerousawards, including several Emmy Awards and the prestigious George Foster PeabodyAward.[207] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn207] Shortly after the 2009 event at the United Nations, I contacted Juan CarlosBrandt, Chief of Advocacy and Special Events at the UN, who explained that theinitiative grew out of the Sci Fi channel’s interest in participating in theSecretary-General’s Creative Outreach Initiative. [208][part0000_split_046.html#_edn208] The initiative was launched in July 2008 bySecretary-General Ban Ki Moon and aimed to foster collaboration between theentertainment industry and the UN. “They came to us and explained that there were themes common to both the showand the UN” according to Mr. Brandt, and “that those themes could be discussedhere in a serious manner.”[209] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn209] He explained that this would be the first time that a TV show has been invitedto participate in a UN panel discussion. The choice of Battlestar Galactica tocast light on global conflicts was intended to seriously explore the virtues ofreconciling cultures with a history of armed conflict.[210][part0000_split_046.html#_edn210]Summarizing the plot, the show depicts 50 thousand human survivors from adevastating war in a double binary star system, which had 12 colonies on planetswith a combined population of 50 billion. The surviving humans escape aboardspaceships and are pursued by a form of Artificial Intelligence (AI), calledCylons, bent on the genocidal destruction of all human life.Prior to the outbreak of the “Second Cylon War” (the first had ended in astalemate 40 years earlier) the Cylons learned to replicate human bodiescontrolled by AI to create humanoid Cylons. The Cylons proceeded to infiltratethe extraterrestrial human society on the twelve colonies before launchinganother all-out war to wipe out humanity. After all but destroying humanity ontheir twelve colonial planets, the humanoid Cylons again infiltrate theremaining humans seeking to find a legendary 13th colony, which according toancient legends had left the original home world of the 12 colonies calledKobol.Kobol had itself reached a high degree of technological development beforeundergoing a planet-wide war, leading to the exodus of the 13 tribes. 12 left toestablish the human colonies in the four star system that became the 12 Coloniesof Kobol, while the 13th tribe traveled to a distant world they named “Earth.”It turns out as the series develops that the 13th colony are in fact humanoidCylons, which had left Kobol after an earlier war between humanity and their AIcreation. Ironically, the humanoid Cylons on “Earth” underwent a similarconflict process after creating their own mechanical Cylons with AI, whichrebelled against them. Five surviving humanoid Cylons from Earth then travelledto the 12 Colonies of Kobol, and ended the First Cylon war by secretly promisingto help the rebel mechanical Cylons create humanoid Cylons. The newly createdhumanoid Cylons decide to launch the Second Cylon War out of vengeance.By the end of the fourth season of Battlestar Galactica in 2009, the fleeinghumans and the two generations of humanoid Cylons, have learned the painfullessons of war, and the repetitive nature of human-AI conflict. They are finallyready to seriously embark on a new adventure of reconciliation and dialogue,choosing to integrate the surviving humans and humanoid Cylons into a new hybridspecies that would peacefully evolve together in a primitive world. Their newchosen world would also be called “Earth,” which turns out to be our planetabout 150,000 years ago. The series ends with the revelation that modernhumankind are the hybrid descendants of the extraterrestrial human and humanoidCylon races that merged as a solution to the ancient conflict.The Battlestar Galactica series certainly raised thought provoking themes aboutwar and peace. At least the United Nations Panel who convened to study theseries thought so. Therefore I asked Mr. Brandt: In what way does the Battlestar Galactica depiction of extraterrestrial lifepracticing reconciliation and dialogue assist humanity in preparations for afuture where extraterrestrial life may be discovered?[211][part0000_split_046.html#_edn211] He responded with a selection from a speech from Asha-Rose Migiro, DeputySecretary-General of the United Nations: Nobody can close their doors to cultural intervention. And if we're talking ofpeace and security, we have to talk of the different cultures that there are,the different beliefs, and how human beings should learn to live with oneanother. So this is one way that also contributes to peace, contributes tostability and, therefore, creates the conditions for development.[212][part0000_split_046.html#_edn212] Battlestar Galactica takes themes related to past genocidal conflicts and morerecent ethnic cleansing campaigns, to the level of a planet wide war ofextermination by cybernetic AI extraterrestrials that have learned to infiltrateand subvert human society. This would certainly not be the form of “culturalintervention” envisaged by Ms. Migiro.Among the United Nations officials scheduled to attend the Battlestar Galacticpanel discussion listed on the Press Release was Dr. Robert Orr, AssistantSecretary General for Policy Coordination and Strategic Planning. He earlierserved at the US National Security Council, where he was in charge ofpeacekeeping and humanitarian operations. If the United Nations were to ever beseriously confronted with issues of reconciliation and dialogue withextraterrestrial life and/or AI life forms in conflict with humanity, Dr. Orrwould be high on the list of UN officials qualified to lead such an effort.The choice of Battlestar Galactica for discussing themes of war and peace fromthe perspective of a fictional galactic conflict raises an intriguing question.Was the show’s central premise of a galactic conflict between human-likeextraterrestrials and an AI life form in any way inspired by real events? Inparticular, was classified information received by the show’s creator, GlenLarson, from Leslie Stevens about a secret Navy run space program in any wayrelated to a global threat posed by an AI life form?First, it is worth analyzing the relationship between Stevens and Larsons, andthe genesis of the “Battlestar Galactica” idea. In an interview with Alan J.Levi, the Director of the original Battlestar Galactica series, Susan J. Paxtonmade a surprising discovery. In an article titled, “Leslie Stevens is TheCreator of Battlestar Galactica,\" she wrote: Levi is known to BG fans as the director of \"Gun on Ice Planet Zero,\" but healso directed half of the premiere after Richard Colla was let go by Larson.Levi was a good friend of the late Leslie Stevens, the producer best known forthe famous science fiction series The Outer Limits. Recently I interviewed AlanLevi. I had not planned to ask him any questions about the origins of BattlestarGalactica because he had not been involved early enough in the process to knowabout it. But, out of the blue, with no prompting from me whatsoever, he said,\"Well, Leslie Stevens wrote the original script. Leslie was one of my bestfriends. I do know that Leslie had told me at one time way before he ever gotinto the script that he had this great idea for a script that he was going totake to Glen Larson and talk about.\"In other words, sometime in 1977, Stevens had told Levi about an idea for aseries he was going to discuss with Glen Larson, an idea that recognizably wasBattlestar Galactica. Now before people start running around screaming thatLarson \"stole\" BG from Stevens, it's clear that whatever happened, Stevens musthave agreed with it, though for what reason we cannot at this time know.[213][part0000_split_046.html#_edn213] In her analysis of the genesis of Battlestar Galactica, Paxton pointed outLarson’s earlier efforts in developing a sci fi series that had no resemblanceto Battlestar Galactica. It was really Stevens’ idea, who originally pitched itto Larson, according to Levi. Then even more tellingly, Stevens wrote theoriginal script for Battlestar Galactica, and was content to let Larson take allthe credit. This is similar to what Stevens had previously done with Rodenberry from 1964 to1965 while shooting the Outer Limits. A business relationship was developedwhere they collaborated in setting up the original idea of Star Trek. Now, justover a decade later, in 1977, Stevens began doing the same thing with Larson.It is very unusual for television and movie producers to forego taking creditfor their creations, unless there is a deeper agenda at play. In the case ofStevens, his military intelligence connections and involvement withpsychological operations led him to disseminate classified information into themovie and television industry to hide the truth in plain sight.If Star Trek was modeled on a real life secret Navy space program cooperatingwith Nordic extraterrestrials in a galactic battle with Reptilian aliens, whatwas Battlestar Galactica representing? For the answer, we can go to thetestimony of secret space program whistleblower, Corey Goode, on the issue ofartificial intelligence and extraterrestrial life.Goode’s claims that the space programs he served with, from 1987 to 2007, hadidentified Artificial Intelligence as an existential threat to humanity. Goodedescribes elaborate security protocols that have been put into place to detectand eliminate an “AI Signal” that not only has the ability to infiltrateadvanced technology, but also biological systems. The best way to avoid the dangers of AI is to educate yourself on the potentialsthey have to cause a loss of sovereignty. Becoming too dependent on technologyis something else that will make you more of a target to be controlled by AIinfluence or even be infected by an “AI Signal” that can live in the bioelectricfield of your body. This signal can then have an effect on the way you think andbehave. This is something that is screened for even currently when operators andguests arrive at SSP [Secret Space Program] Facilities and is something thatother ET Groups take seriously as well.[214] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn214] Goode says extraterrestrial civilizations have much experience in observing howAI has taken over countless other worlds, and led to the eradication of theindigenous population that created the AI. Essentially Goode is warning that thestoryline of Battlestar Galactica is more genuine galactic history than sciencefiction: Those who are AI Prophets are already working on a timeline to create a societycompletely dependent on technology that at one point will hand its sovereigntyover to this “AI God” because it will be believed that this AI is the only thingthat can rule the world from a neutral perspective and bring world peace for thefirst time. These AI Prophets have been shown the information of the thousandsof other civilizations that have fallen for this trickster god model and wereall destroyed.[215] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn215] Is there any evidence to support Goode’s information that ArtificialIntelligence is not only an existential threat to humanity, but has plagued manydifferent extraterrestrial civilizations as depicted in Battlestar Galactica? "},{"pageContent":"THE REAL LIFE “FRIENDSHIP” CASE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL-AI CONFLICT ON EARTH A 2009 book titled, Mass Contacts, details the history of a mysterious group ofhuman-looking extraterrestrials that established underground bases in Italy, andmet with local residents between 1956 and 1978.[216][part0000_split_046.html#_edn216] The author, Stefano Breccia, was a highlyregarded Italian UFO researcher with an electrical engineering background, whopreviously taught at several Italian and foreign universities. He investigatedthe “Amicizia” (Friendship) case over a period of several decades during whichhe met and questioned many of the primary witnesses. The most prominent wasBruno Sammaciccia, a prolific Italian author and scholar with many highconnections in the Italian national security system, including certain generalsand diplomats.Some of the many photos taken of UFOs and extraterrestrials in the Friendshipcase rank among the best quality ever taken. Breccia included about 20 of thesephotos in Mass Contacts. In terms of its overall impact, number of participantsinvolved, and documentary evidence compiled, Mass Contacts is the mostcompelling case of direct human extraterrestrial contact in modern history. Figure 54. Amicizia (Friendship) Flying Saucer Craft Photo from Mass Contact,p. 361[../images/00055.jpeg] The story of Mass Contacts began back in 1956, when Sammaciccia and two of hisfriends met with two mysterious individuals who said they wereextraterrestrials. One was over eight feet tall, while the other was just abovethree feet in height. Sammaciccia and his friends, initially skeptical, wereeventually taken into a large underground base where they saw more of thealleged extraterrestrials. They also saw their children being educated, some ofthe advanced technologies they used, and their spaceships. Finally convincedthat they were really having physical contact with beings from another world,Sammaciccia and his friends began to help the extraterrestrials. They began withmaterial support by arranging for truckloads of fruit, food and other materialto be transported and unloaded at an extraterrestrial base. Eventually, twotruckloads of supplies were being delivered every month to bases in differentregions of Italy where Sammaciccia and his assistants lived.Sammaciccia described the various people involved in the case, including thosewho had direct meetings with the extraterrestrials. The number of individualsinvolved grew over time, while Sammaciccia continued to assist theextraterrestrials in helping prepare humanity for the reality of human-lookingextraterrestrials from other planets. Breccia said that he personally met andinterviewed almost 80 people who worked with, or met, the extraterrestrials.Most were in Italy, but others were from other countries and had also beenexposed to this same group of extraterrestrials. Many of the extraterrestrialscould easily blend into human society and even take normal jobs when necessary.The Friendship case helps confirm other accounts by a number of contactees andwhistleblowers who state that human-looking extraterrestrials have blended intohuman society and have walked among us.[217] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn217]Sammaciccia finally described a violent conflict between two factions ofextraterrestrials trying to influence humanity’s development and future. Whilehis “Friendship” faction were biologically human and promoted spiritualdevelopment, the other faction were advanced humanoid robots with ArtificialIntelligence that promoted technological development at all cost. In MassContacts, Breccia included an interview where one “Friendship extraterrestrial”discussed the history and activities of the robotic life forms known by theacronym, CTR (Italian for “Contrarians”—adversary):The CTR are the results of an experiment that has run out of control. They arerobots, in the full meaning of this word, even if centuries ago they havestarted an activity of biological reproduction. To you, at this point, it’s nolonger possible to discriminate between a natural being and a biologicalrobot….[218] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn218]The alleged extraterrestrial elaborated further on how these synthetic AI robotswere indistinguishable from organic humans:The CTR’s (and, by the way, not them only) are on the contrary artificialcreatures, and they remain as such, even if nobody among your physicians wouldbe able to discriminate; actually there is nothing physical that may allow tostate whether an organism is a descendent from artificial robots or not.[219][part0000_split_046.html#_edn219] The philosophical and biological differences between the two extraterrestrialfactions in the Friendship case led to periodically violent clashes. Eventually,the underground bases of Sammaciccia’s extraterrestrial friends were destroyedin 1978. This included their largest base, which was under the Adriatic Sea,just off the Italian coast. Survivors had to leave the Earth, but promised toreturn later when humanity was ready for a more ethical future when it couldopenly interact with extraterrestrials.The story revealed by Breccia is astoundingly similar to the storyline ofBattlestar Galactica, where the humanoid Cylons have evolved to the extent thatthey are physically indistinguishable from biological humans and launch agenocidal war against their human creators. The humanoid Cylons chase the humansall across the galaxy until they reach the Earth and settle here. The humanoidCylons have evolved so far as to be capable of physical reproduction andinterbreeding with humans, which is how the series ends with a new hybridHuman-Cylon race populating the Earth 150,000 years ago, to create the currenthuman civilization.Battlestar Galactica has many elements that correspond to information releasedby Corey Goode and Stefano Breccia about AI life forms being an existentialthreat to human civilizations throughout the galaxy. It is markedly significantthat the alleged defeat of the Friendship extraterrestrials by their AI (CTR)humanoid robot opponents took place in 1978, which coincides with the timeStevens worked with Larson, resulting in the launch of the Battlestar Galacticaseries. Was this mere coincidence, or was Stevens passing on classifiedinformation about the real and present threat posed by AI humanoidextraterrestrials to humanity?It’s very likely that NATO and the US Navy in particular, closely monitored theescalating conflict between the two extraterrestrial factions, and the resultingviolent destruction of the bases belonging to the more peaceful human-lookingextraterrestrials by the AI humanoid group. After all, Italy was a NATO ally atthe time, and everything Sammaciccia was doing to help the human-lookingextraterrestrials was being closely monitored by Italian national securityauthorities, and tacitly allowed by them. Destruction of the extraterrestrialbases, knowing fully well the surrounding circumstances, would certainly haveset off alarm bells for the US Navy, which was monitoring ocean activitiesthrough its naval bases in Italy at the time.[220][part0000_split_046.html#_edn220] The violent destruction of underwater baseswould have set in motion a process whereby Leslie Stevens, due to his militaryintelligence background and continuing intelligence mission with Hollywood, wasgiven a classified briefing of what was happening and the threat posed by AIlife forms.The 2009 United Nations Panel on Battlestar Galactica emphasized the importanceof the reconciliation and conflict resolution depicted in the series finale,especially when it came to resolving complex ethnic and social problems. Perhapsthis was a way for the United Nations to encourage one solution to a complexgalactic conflict between organic and AI life forms, which was now involving ourplanet.In contrast, Goode emphasized the danger of infiltration by an AI signal thatcould penetrate both advanced technology and human biology. He says thattechnology has been developed that can distinguish between humans and AI lifeforms, and is used as a security measure by different secret space programs andextraterrestrial civilizations. According to Goode, some leaders of theDraconian Reptilians had been compromised by this AI signal in the form ofnanites: “it turns out that a lot of these reptilian higher castes are highlyinfected with nanites—artificial intelligence-type of nanites.”[221][part0000_split_046.html#_edn221]The threat posed by AI is consistent with the original message found in thefirst Battlestar Galactica series that was influenced by Stevens, and tacitly byleaders of the Navy space program, then making final preparations for its secretlaunch in the early 1980’s, while also monitoring developments in Italy. Thissuggests great caution in how humanity should deal with the complex social,legal and national security issues posed by the development of AI, and thepossibility that AI life may be attempting, or has already succeeded in, effortsto infiltrate human society, secret space programs and even some visitingextraterrestrial groups. "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9THE CURRENT OPERATIONS OF SOLAR WARDEN Thus far, William Tompkins’ role in the design and development of a Navy SecretSpace Program during his almost 40 year Navy and aerospace career has been laidout at length. The Navy’s space program, which Tompkins says was called SolarWarden since its inception, became operational in the early 1980’s. With hisretirement from full time employment in the aerospace industry in 1984, Tompkinsdevoted himself to a new chapter in his life where he would influence the Navy’spolicy on how to prepare humanity for the truth about extraterrestrial life andthe advanced technologies used in its space program. This policy involvementwould be done through his membership in the Navy League in Oregon (1991-1999),and more recent active participation in the Navy’s annual “West” meetings in SanDiego (2000-2016).Tompkins’ knowledge about the Navy’s Solar Warden program goes beyond a detailedunderstanding of its origin and development stages, and remarkably extends tocurrent operations. This is highly significant since many of his revelationshelp corroborate the testimony of others who have also come forward to revealoperational details of Solar Warden. Of these, Corey Goode’s claims are the mostsignificant in terms of their scope and similarities to those of Tompkins.In short, Goode says that he was covertly recruited into Solar Warden in 1987,and served in it and several other secret space programs until 2007. During thistime, he had access to “smart glass pads” which contained extensive briefingdocuments about the history, development, and operations of Solar Warden andother secret space programs. Goode recalls that some of the documents he read onthe smart glass pads looked like they had had been prepared decades ago bystenographers.When Goode’s revelations were first released in book form by me in InsidersReveal Secret Space Programs and Extraterrestrial Life (September 2015), neitherTompkins nor Goode knew of each other. It was only after the publication ofTompkins book, Selected by Extraterrestrials (December 2015) that its editor,Dr. Robert Wood, received a copy of my book. After reading it, he noted theremarkable similarities between my analysis of the history and development ofsecret space programs, which was based largely on Goode’s testimony, and whatTompkins was saying in his own newly released book.After further investigation, it turned out that the substantive match betweenTompkins and Goode’s respective histories of the secret space programs could betraced back to the 29 Navy spies and approximately 1200 nightly debriefings thatTompkins attended from 1942 to 1946. These debriefings run by Admiral Rico Bottaout of Naval Air Station, San Diego were recorded by stenographers. In addition,the briefing packets prepared by Tompkins and delivered by him to variousaerospace companies, think tanks and research institutions, were assembled withthe assistance of a pool of typists and copy girls.Apparently in the due course of maintaining historical archives, both therecords of the Navy spies’ debriefings and Tompkins’ subsequent briefing packetsfrom the World War II period were uploaded onto the smart glass pad’s expansivedatabase. Rather fatefully, more than forty years later, Goode would read thesesame documents that Tompkins had prepared or was privy to when stationed atNaval Air Station, San Diego. Goode later told in an interview how he came tothe realization that the briefing documents Tompkins was discussing were thesame ones he had read:I'm really beginning to believe that a lot of his briefings during the timeperiod – 1942 – were what made it into the database that I was reading on thesmart glass pad, you know, like 30 [40] years ago… we were viewing old typesetdocuments.[222] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn222]Tompkins has described his involvement in two space programs.[223][part0000_split_046.html#_edn223] First came his assignment in navalintelligence operations on a German/Nazi led secret space program during WorldWar II. Tompkins learned that the most advanced elements of this program wererelocated to Antarctica after a secret agreement was reached with anextraterrestrial Reptilian race, called the Draconians. This German/Nazi spaceprogram in Antarctica evolved into what Goode later described as the “DarkFleet,” which would essentially form a mercenary space force to assist theDraconians in their plans of galactic conquest.[224][part0000_split_046.html#_edn224]Many key elements in Tompkins’ revelations about the subsequent activity of theGerman/Nazi space program correspond to what Goode has independently releasedfrom his sources. The Nazi/German space program used German scientists that werepart of Project Paperclip to infiltrate the US space programs and militaryindustrial complex. This strategic action, together with what both Tompkins andGoode described as a Nazi fly over of Washington DC in the summer of 1952, ledto subversive agreements with the Eisenhower administration. Goode says theseagreements were a “silent coup”:During the 1950’s and after they [NAZI’s] had successfully infiltrated andsubverted the Military Industrial Complex and major Corporate heads they hadeffectively won control of the direction of not only the Break Away CivilizationPrograms but also the mainstream government and financial system. It was a veryeffective and silent coup that gutted what was once the American Republic andturned it too into a Corporate Entity with each of us being “Assets” with ourvery own serial numbers.[225] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn225]Both Tompkins and Goode say that the Navy played catch-up for several decadeswith the more advanced German/Nazi space program. It was only in the early1980’s that Solar Warden became operational with its first spaceship deploymentsin what would ultimately lead to eight space battle groups. Tompkins assertsthat the key to the Navy finally succeeding in its efforts was the covertassistance provided by Nordic extraterrestrials, who offered highly advancedengineering expertise to help design and build the future space battle groups,despite Nazi-Reptilian sabotage efforts. "},{"pageContent":"TOMPKINS’ SOURCES FOR CURRENT SOLAR WARDEN OPERATIONS Knowledge about the current operations of secret space programs derive from bothterrestrial and non-terrestrial sources for Tompkins, and are independent tothose of Goode. Foremost, Tompkins says he continues to be linked to thehuman-looking Nordic extraterrestrials. In fact, he says they are the same oneswho formally assisted him when he was working for various corporations indeveloping designs for many different classes of spacecraft that would enterinto either: a. the Apollo Program; b. the Nova Program; or c. the Solar Wardenprogram.Tompkins explains that he would be given “flashes” or “downloads” of informationrevealing complex details about the designs he was working on. Theseextraterrestrial-assisted designs would be passed on and Tompkins emphasizesthat they invariably worked the first time. This was a communication processthat Tompkins’ superiors, both at Naval Intelligence and Douglas AircraftCompany, were familiar with. Tompkins recalls what Elmer Wheaton, the head ofthe Advanced Design think tank at Douglas, told him back then:An extraterrestrial race has contacted our government, and from what we havelearned they be Nordic people; very similar to us. Navy Intelligence recruitedyou because they knew that you and others like you were visited and selected aschildren, and now, in your adult lives, these entities have been communicatingwith you telepathically.[226] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn226] Wheaton, according to Tompkins, went on to state that the Office of NavalIntelligence viewed Tompkins as vital for distinguishing between differentgroups of extraterrestrials that were covertly intervening in human affairs:Naval Intelligence has informed us of your capabilities and that your judgementis impeccable. As a contactee, you’ve been put in a position where you can beginto sort out why these different races are at war with each other. Moreimportant, what our involvement on this planet is and what should be…. You’vebeen implanted with a program that transfers highly advanced information fromextraterrestrials to what the Navy calls ‘preferred human contactees.’[227][part0000_split_046.html#_edn227] How can it be verified that the Navy regarded Tompkins as a “preferred humancontactee” with a unique telepathic connection to friendly Nordic lookingextraterrestials? In chapter seven, I introduced different types of evidencethat Tompkins, with the active support of senior Navy officers, was allowed toestablish “Special Projects” for the Navy League Rogue Valley Council thatinvolved educating retired/reserve Navy officers and their children aboutextraterrestrial life. The documents and testimonies of the retired Navyofficers, confirming key aspects of Tompkins’ claims, offers meaningful supportfor the accuracy of what Tompkins recalls from his conversation with Wheaton.Tompkins says he continues to receive telepathic flashes/downloads, which revealcurrent operational details about both extraterrestrial and Navy vehicles inspace. He believes this is because the Nordic extraterrestrials have formed acovert alliance with the Navy’s Solar Warden space program. This means thatTompkins continues to be an important intermediary for this alliance, whichoperates covertly due to the formal agreements between different USadministrations and the Nazi-Reptilian alliance, as detailed in chapter three.The second source for Tompkins’ knowledge about current Solar Warden operationscomes from his time at the helm of the Rogue Valley (Medford, Oregon) chapter ofthe Navy League from 1991 to 1999. During this period, he was given briefingsabout operations of secret space programs and extraterrestrial life, and sharedsome of this information through a “Special Projects Committee” with retiredNavy, Marine and USAF officers and their children.Tompkins says that Admiral Hugh Webster, who ran the Navy League chapter in SanDiego and more importantly was an executive officer for it nationally, was veryfamiliar with the Navy’s secret space program operations and the historic roleplayed by Admiral Rico Botta in the program. He was also very aware of Tompkins’key role as a “preferred human contactee” possessing reliable information from afriendly group of extraterrestrials covertly assisting the Navy. In 2000, whenTompkins moved to San Diego, he had more opportunities to work directly withWebster. It was Admiral Webster who gave Tompkins permission to reveal in hisautobiography all that he knew about the Navy’s secret space program, and thecovert alliance with Nordic extraterrestrials.[228][part0000_split_046.html#_edn228]Furthermore, Tompkins has disclosed that he is a regular participant in theNavy’s annual “West” meetings in San Diego, where leading aerospace companiescome together to share their research and development findings. The annual Westmeetings are organized by the Armed Forces Communications and ElectronicsAssociation (AFCEA), describing itself as follows:AFCEA provides a forum for military, government and industry communities tocollaborate so that technology and strategy align with the needs of those whoserve. We are a member-based, non-profit international organization that hashelped members advance information technology, communications and electronicscapabilities since 1946.[229] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn229]Among the many purposes of these annual “West” meetings is the goal to learnabout the latest technologies that may be useful for the Navy’s secret spaceprogram. Tompkins reports that he has attended all Navy West meetings since theyear 2000. In February 2016, he attended again and says he was given access toclassified meetings, where plans to disclose Solar Warden to the general publicwas discussed. Advanced technologies such as “life extension,” according toTompkins, are scheduled to be released in the next two years as part of theNavy’s disclosure initiative.What makes Tompkins’ claims very plausible are recent announcements, bybiologists such as Dr. David Sinclair, that life extension technologies arescientifically feasible based on open source studies on mice. Dr. Sinclairexplained how the life extension process could also be done safely for humans:We’ve gone from mice into early human studies actually. There have been someclinical trials around the world, and we’re hoping in the next few years to knowif this will actually work in people as well … They show that the molecules thatextend lifespan in mice are safe in people.[230][part0000_split_046.html#_edn230]In a November 2014 interview, Dr. Sinclair went on to say that drugs based onthe nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) molecule could be successfully developed“to restore youthfulness in human cells.”[231] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn231]Sinclair’s view that NMN based drugs will eventually be developed for safe useby humans is exciting and solid corroboration for Tompkins’ claims.In private, Tompkins has shown both Dr. Robert Wood and I the pass he used togain access for the West 2016 meetings. This important piece of evidence that wewitnessed makes it very possible that the events he described did occur. It alsoconfirms that senior Navy officials still view Tompkins as very important fortheir long term policies concerning Solar Warden, no doubt due to his longhistorical background in developing it and his ongoing communications withNordic extraterrestrials that still continue today.Tompkins’ testimony about what he learned at the 2016 Navy West meetingscorrespond closely with Goode’s information from ongoing sources. The SolarWarden program, in Goode’s account, is linked to an alliance of space programscalled the Secret Space Program Alliance, which has been developing strategiesfor “full disclosure.”[232] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn232] This would involvethe disclosure of: multiple secret space programs; the existence ofextraterrestrial life and of ancient human civilizations in the Earth’sinterior; and finally the release of many advanced technologies that wouldrevolutionize life on our planet. Goode has been reporting that since March2015, up to the present, there have been sustained negotiations over how much ofthe truth should be disclosed to the general public.[233][part0000_split_046.html#_edn233]At the time of this writing, Tompkins is planning to attend the Navy Westconference in February 2017, and crucially, he still has the necessary securityclearance to be present at classified meetings. Tompkins is currently 93 yearsold, with a sharp mind, excellent memory and he is still physically healthy. Itwould be fair to say that he is considered to be a “wise elder” among thoserunning current operations within the Navy’s secret space program, and highlyrespected for continuing to be a liaison with Nordic extraterrestrials. "},{"pageContent":"WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SOLAR WARDEN TODAY?Given Tompkins’ background, and continuing involvement with the Navy’s SolarWarden program, his statements about its current operations bear specialsignificance. In a September 2016 interview, he publicly revealed importantinformation about it:Thousands, thousands, not just a few, thousands of people have joined the Navyhere in the United States. They joined the Space Navy. They signed up for a20-year tour. So these folks, men and women, were given a lot of examinationsand a lot of information on what they were going to need.Many of them went to the Moon, our Moon, and facilities there and got checkedout and organized and established where is the best place they’re going to go,what their criteria is going to be, what major area they’re going to develop,like what class in the university.[234] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn234]Tompkins’ comments here corroborate the testimony of Goode, who also assertsthat there are thousands of personnel involved in the Navy’s secret spaceprogram. Goode, and another alleged whistleblower, Randy Cramer, spoke of anoperations center on the Moon called “Lunar Operations Command,” and both claimthey were taken there in 1987 for their formal inductions.[235][part0000_split_046.html#_edn235]How secret space program personnel are assigned after their induction process isdescribed by Tompkins, who says:And then they get assigned to a specific base. And they work for a short time inthe base before they’re assigned a naval cruiser, or a naval attack vehicle, oreven a naval spacecraft carrier, which are one, two, and four kilometer longclass. And we have eight of those battle groups out there. So there’s plenty ofroom for new people to come aboard…. [236] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn236]The above statement corroborates Goode’s description of what he personallyexperienced after his induction at “Lunar Operations Command.” He says he wasassigned to a research vessel, the Arnold Sommerfeld, where he spent six yearsperforming a number of science and exploratory missions in the solarsystem.[237] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn237]Tompkins next corroborates Goode and Cramer’s claims, along with a thirdwhistleblower, Michael Relfe, about what happened at the end of their 20 andback programs. Goode and Cramer say they were age-regressed 20 years andrespectively sent back in time to 1986/1987, and at that time their militarymemories were wiped. Relfe said that he had the same thing happen to him as hewas returned to 1976, to then relive the next twenty years of his life again asa young man. Tompkins says:So at the end of the 20 years, they have an option for another 20 years. Theycould go for another 20 years. Or they have the option to come back to Earthwhere they were born and where they entered the Navy. And then they make thisdecision they want to come back. So they age regress. They’re now 20 years olderthan when they joined the Space Navy, okay? And so they take several weeks orseveral months, and they reverse their age back to 21 when they joined theNavy…. And now, during that several weeks returning, their minds, not painfully,but their minds are played with to where 90.99 [likely meant to say 99.99percent] of their memory for the last 20 years out in space is removed…. thatsystem is operating and has been operating since 1980. [238][part0000_split_046.html#_edn238] In Insiders Reveal Secret Space Programs and Extraterrestrial Alliances, achapter is devoted to a comparative study of the testimonies of Goode, Cramerand Relfe.[239] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn239] Tompkins’ testimony adds asignificant level of credibility to what each of these individuals had to sayabout the process they underwent at the end of their 20 year tours of duty intheir respective secret space programs.Tompkins has further revealed his knowledge about a corporate run space programthat emerged to rival the Navy’s Solar Warden program:But the corporations, at the same time they were doing the military missionprograms, they were doing other programs which could possibly allow them tonullify the space programs of the military, like Solar Warden. And these people,then, utilizing all the advances in space systems, militarily wise, developedthe capability to move off the planet and mine materials on other planets in thesolar system and/or continue on out into the galaxy through the 12 closeststars, Alpha Centauri being the first, and mining or extracting materials, orwhatever, and making money.This same group of top corporate people of all these companies that are doingthe jobs, that they are getting paid for, were paralleling the space missionsfor industrialization – making money… We’ve got corporate operations operatingparallel to missions to solar system planets and other stars’ planets, doing thesame thing.[240] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn240]This testimony by Tompkins corroborates what Goode revealed in early 2015 aboutthe existence of a corporate run space program; Goode specifically calls it theInterplanetary Corporate Conglomerate.[241] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn241]Back in April 2014, Cramer claims he was assigned to a Mars military base from1987 to 2004, to protect five corporate run colonies that he identified as theMars Colony Corporation.[242] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn242] Similarly, Relfesays that during his time on Mars, from 1976 to 1996, he was part of a militaryoperation to protect Mars colonies.[243] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn243]Based on Tompkins’ identification of the corporations involved in theconstruction of the Navy’s secret space program at underground facilities inUtah, we know which of them are very likely to form the core of a similarcorporate run program—the “Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate.” Previousmaterial in chapter six includes Tompkins naming Lockheed Martin, NorthrupGrumman and Boeing Aerospace as the major corporate contractors responsible forbuilding the Navy’s kilometers-long spacecraft. It was pointed out how each ofthese three companies could be directly linked to predecessors who had receivedthe briefing packets Tompkins had put together from Navy spies’ debriefings.As primary contractors for building a corporate run space fleet, thesecorporations would sub-contract out to hundreds of other companies, using basiccompartmentalization security procedures which are standard for UnacknowledgedSpecial Access Programs.[244] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn244] The variouscomponents for the kilometers-long spacecraft, as described by Tompkins, wouldbe assembled together using modular construction practices. Modularconstruction, which was first used decades ago in Unacknowledged SAP’s, hasrecently been declassified for modern engineering use in conventional aerospaceand maritime projects.Here is how General Dynamics/Electric Boat, for example, describes the use ofmodular construction for its new Virginia-class of nuclear powered submarines.Working closely with the Navy and its industry partners, Electric Boat agreed toreduce the cost for Virginia-class submarines to $2 billion per hull in FiscalYear 2005 dollars. This successful effort comprises three parts: multi-yearprocurement, improvements in construction practices and design foraffordability…The Virginia Class has been designed and built using advanced electronic designand data management tools that have been integrated into modular constructiontechniques. The use of Integrated Product and Process Design (IPPD) is creditedwith contributing to the success of the program.Improvements in construction performance will reduce construction span from 84months to 60 months. This is being achieved through greater use of modularconstruction, pushing as much work as possible into a manufacturing settingwhere it can be done more efficiently. USS New Hampshire was the first ship tobe assembled from four modules, compared with the 10 modules required to buildthe lead ship of the class, USS Virginia.[245] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn245]Using modular construction practices and compartmentalized security proceduresin place for the military industrial complex, large aerospace corporations canbuild massive kilometers-long spacecraft not only for the Navy, but also for theInterplanetary Corporate Conglomerate, and others. Figure 55. Virginia Class Submarine Built Using Modular Construction Practices[../images/00056.jpeg] Tompkins’ testimony supports Goode’s claim that the Interplanetary CorporateConglomerate essentially became a rogue space program outside of theconstitutional authority of the Navy’s Solar Warden program. Goode’s assertionthat the Corporate Conglomerate became a key ally of the German/Nazi Dark Fleetbased in Antarctica, and sabotaged other space programs, is also corroborated byTompkins. This directly connects to Goode and Tompkins’ allegations regarding aslave trade conducted by the Dark Fleet with the active support of theInterplanetary Corporate Conglomerate.After agreements were reached in 1955, the US military industrial complex beganassisting the German/Nazi space program by providing it with resources, and mostimportantly, personnel. This led to a rapid increase in the use of slave laborby the Dark Fleet, which coordinated closely with its Reptilian allies. On thistopic, Tompkins says:[T]he Germans were totally more advanced and capable of learning how to operatethese vehicles and go out in space with the Reptilian naval groups and operatewith them in the galaxy, essentially doing what Germany was going to do to thisplanet, which was essentially to take out the people they didn't want on theplanet and make the rest of them their slaves.[246][part0000_split_046.html#_edn246]Goode elaborates on the extensive use of slave labor by the Dark Fleet, and thecollusion in this by the military industrial complexes of the United States andother major nations.The Secret Earth Governments and their Syndicates discovered that a large amountof humans were being taken off the planet by various ET’s anyway so they decidedto find a way to profit from it and have control over which people were beingtaken. In prior arrangements they were made promises of receiving technologiesand biological specimens for allowing groups to abduct humans but the ET’srarely delivered on their promises. Once they had developed the advancedinfrastructure (ICC) in our Sol System along with advanced technologies (thatsome of the thousands of ET groups traveling through our system were nowinterested in obtaining) and now had the ability to deter most unwelcome guestsfrom entering Earths airspace the Cabal/ICC then decided to use humantrafficking as one of their resources in interstellar bartering.[247][part0000_split_046.html#_edn247]The extensive use of slave labor and a galactic trade in trafficking abductedhumans are among the most critical issues being currently negotiated in terms offuture “official disclosure(s),” according to Goode. Revealing the true scope ofsuch crimes would predictably lead to demands for members of theCabal/Illuminati, and complicit global elites, being charged with “crimesagainst humanity.” Predictably, behind the scenes this has led to Cabal/globalelite demands for “limited disclosure,” where the truth of such crimes isdelayed for up to 100 years.[248] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn248]Another issue relevant to current Solar Warden operations concerns giantplanet-sized spheres that have recently entered our solar system. Tompkinsreveals what he knows of this phenomenon:As far as our situation now today, It's been accepted that we have a number ofdifferent vehicles, which are actually planets that are hollow, that movethrough the galaxy to monitor good guys and bad guys, wars and no wars, peopletaking advantage of other people on different stars' planets, and that, as ofabout a year and a half ago, one of these parked just outside of the solarsystem. And it has been there for the past year and a half. And this vehicle isquite large, and it has over 2,000 different extraterrestrial civilizationpeople on board as observers and as monitors.[249][part0000_split_046.html#_edn249]This information is comparable to Goode’s claim that a group of fiveextraterrestrial races, linked to giant planet-sized spheres (Sphere BeingAlliance), have recently entered our solar system in order to monitor andinfluence the relations between humanity and different visiting extraterrestrialcivilizations. According to Goode, this began in the early 1980’s andaccelerated in 2011, when giant Jupiter-sized spheres entered our solar system.Next what Tompkins explains in more details is very significant in terms ofsupporting specific assertions made earlier by Goode. Tompkins claims that thegiant sphere(s) that are monitoring our solar system: “have blocked theextraterrestrials who are here, are underground in the caverns, from leaving,and they're not allowing their buddies to come in.” [250][part0000_split_046.html#_edn250] This closely matches Goode’s claim that thespheres created an “outer barrier” around both the Earth and the entire solarsystem which has led to a realignment of resources and personnel among differentspace programs and extraterrestrial visitors:There are also some very powerful Secret Earth Government and SyndicateMembers/Leaders who have defected and have been granted an “Off World WitnessProtection Program” for them and their families for actionable intelligence,evidence against their former leadership as well as promise of being witnessesin future World Courts when there are the “Post Full Disclosure” hearingsagainst all of the groups who are trapped in the Sol System behind the “OuterBarrier”.[251] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn251]Tompkins also describes the key functions of the giant planet sized spheres:I understand that there's two goals. One of them is to nullify the problem withthe Sun. The Sun is alive. Okay? Stars are alive. I think it's a hard timeaccepting this. And they have moods... If the Sun sneezes, all of ourcommunication – radio, electronics, everything – is affected. So there's thisgroup of people, whatever you want to call them, who are attempting to primarilynullify the effects to a region, which is not just like the solar system or ourstar's system, but do this as a business so that the levels of catastrophes,things that cause dangers to the people and to the planet, are less. [252][part0000_split_046.html#_edn252]This is very similar to what Goode cites as being one of the key functions ofthe giant spheres belonging to the Sphere Being Alliance; they are to act as abuffer for the cosmic energies coming into our solar system that initiateenormous changes for all life in our region of the galaxy and trigger the suninto hyperactivity.The Sphere Alliance has been mostly focused on the energetic changes occurringin our local star cluster because of the area of the Galaxy they are entering.They have been using the many thousands of cloaked spheres that areequidistantly spread out across our Sol System and neighboring Sol Systems(electrically connected in the “Cosmic Web” and natural portal system) to bufferand diffuse incoming tsunami waves of highly charged energy that change thevibratory state of space/time, energy and matter to cause it to raise to ahigher state in the “Density Spectrum”. This energetic change has a directeffect on not only every planet and star in the region but also every life formbelow a certain vibratory level.[253] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn253]The “solar sneeze” Tompkins refers to is much the same as the possibility of thesun’s corona being ejected in a massive burst of solar activity as Goode wastold.The most scientific and pragmatic of these “secret syndicates” believe theentire surface area of the Sun’s corona is about to mass eject. They believe theSun will then go almost completely dark for a number of days before itre-awakens into a new state of equilibrium. These syndicate “egg heads” believethat the proceeding energetic shock wave and then the impact of this Mega CMEwould take out all communications, electronics and sources of electricity onEarth… Some of these syndicates further believe this will cause a flip inpolarity of the Earth’s magnetic field, having a dramatic effect on every livingcreature on the planet. The neurology and magnetic fields of our bodies would beaffected as would our consciousness.[254] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn254] Tompkins’ detailed knowledge of current operations of the Navy’s secret spaceprogram, a corporate run program, and his willingness to now relate thisinformation is a sizable development for all who have been closely following histestimony. It helps greatly in substantiating the earlier testimony of Goode andothers concerning Solar Warden and parallel secret space program operations.The main contention by Tompkins is that the Navy has been secretly allied with apositive human-looking group of extraterrestrials called the Nordics, and thisis especially revealing. It was raised in chapter four that multiplewhistleblower and private citizens claim human-looking extraterrestrials haveinfiltrated all facets of human society, including the military industrialcomplex of major nations.[255] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn255]Tompkins testimony points to such infiltration having both positive and negativeelements. The more negative elements correspond to a Reptilian extraterrestrialrace that either directly, or through the use of proxies, has infiltrated the USmilitary industrial complex. The goal has been to co-opt personnel and resourcesfor its mercenary Dark Fleet, or to sabotage the Navy’s efforts to establish itsown independent space program.There is also the problem of infiltration by extraterrestrial life forms thatuse or are dominated by Artificial Intelligence, as discussed in chapter eight.These AI aliens have been combatting more positive extraterrestrial visitors forinfluence over human affairs. A clear example was illustrated in the case of theAmicizia/Friendship extraterrestrials that were very active in Italy, from 1956to 1978, before having their bases destroyed by the AI aliens. Moredisturbingly, these AI aliens have been silently encouraging humanity to developin ways that make it more dependent on Artificial Intelligence. This is aneffort that may well lead to global domination by what Goode describes as an “AIsignal” in the future.The more positive elements of extraterrestrial visitation, e.g. the Nordics,have been covertly assisting the Navy and affiliated elements of the militaryindustrial complex to help build space battle groups with huge vehicles.Tompkins says that the goal is not only to help the Navy establish a securityperimeter around our solar system, but to build a broad based alliance withhuman-looking extraterrestrials concerned about Draconians engaged in imperialspace conquest. In addition, these more positive extraterrestrial visitors havebeen warning secret space program personnel about the dangers posed byArtificial Intelligence. The similarity of the above two scenarios to key elements in the popular sciencefiction series Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica is not accidental. Chaptersfive and eight presented evidence that Gene Rodenberry (creator of Star Trek)and Glenn Larson (creator of Battlestar Galactica) were clearly influenced byLeslie Stevens IV (creator of the Outer Limits), who was privy to keyinformation about the Navy’s secret space program through his father, AdmiralLeslie Stevens III. The job of Stevens IV was to sow elements of the truth intothe television and motion picture industries as part of a “soft disclosure”program. This dates back to when his father, Admiral Stevens, led apsychological warfare program through the “The Joint Subsidiary Plans Division,”which was started by the Pentagon’s Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1949. Using themovie/television industry to release some of the truth about secret spaceprograms and extraterrestrial life has been a means of acclimating the public,while concurrently maintaining plausible deniability over what has beendisclosed.Tompkins repeatedly says that he is not a whistleblower since he has been givenapproval to come forward to reveal his knowledge about the Navy’s Solar Wardenspace program, and the incredibly advanced technologies it uses to deploy itsspace battle groups. Tompkins says he first received this authority for “fulldisclosure” in 2001 from Admiral Hugh Webster, who instructed him to “tell itall.”[256] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn256] To this day, Tompkins continues toreceive information from official Navy sources about the Solar Warden spaceprogram.Significantly, three retired Navy officers, Rear Admiral Larry Marsh, CaptainLarry Boeck and Commander Art Lumley, have all agreed to publicly identifythemselves in stating that Tompkins is a highly regarded and well respectedfigure in the Navy and its principal support organization, the Navy League. Theyhave all confirmed that Tompkins is an expert in a number of esoteric topics ofinterest to the Navy. This expertise, according to Boeck and Lumley, extends toTompkins detailed knowledge and extensive Navy contacts when it comes to thetopics of extraterrestrial life and technology.By Tompkins coming forward to freely reveal his testimony, together with theamount of documentation he has provided, as well as relevant documents releasedthrough the National Archives and the Freedom of Information Act, andcorroborating statements from retired Navy officers, all this furthers his claimthat senior Navy officers approve his “full disclosure” efforts. Consequently,Tompkins testimony and documents go a long way in validating the claims of CoreyGoode, who says that “full disclosure” efforts continue to be pursued by aSecret Space Program Alliance that he continues to coordinate with.This Alliance has been releasing intelligence data about the full range ofactivities by both multiple secret space programs and extraterrestrial visitors.While Goode and Tompkins’ testimonies converge when it comes to full disclosurebeing approved by the US Navy and other important elements of the globalaerospace community, there is also a powerful “limited disclosure” initiativewhich is supported by the US Air Force."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10USAF SANCTIONED LIMITED DISCLOSURE OF ITS SECRET SPACE PROGRAM Amongst a batch of Wikileaks’ email releases from October 2016 were thoseexposing the identities of two senior military and corporate officials involvedin an initiative led by Tom DeLonge, former Blink 182 guitarist and lead singer,to disclose the truth about UFOs and secret space programs. The corporateofficial was the serving head of Lockheed Martin’s Skunkworks, with a longhistory of building classified aerospace vehicles for the US militaryintelligence community out of Area 51. The General ran a top Air Force researchlaboratory out of Wright Patterson Air Force Base up until 2013. This Generalwas shown to be secretly helping DeLonge put together a team of ten senioradvisors to tackle the issue of how to reveal to the world the truth about UFOsand a secret space program run by the USAF using antigravity technologies.The hacked emails are addressed to John Podesta, former Chief of Staff forPresident Bill Clinton, and Chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 PresidentialCampaign. Podesta had also earlier been identified by DeLonge as an officialworking with him to reveal the truth about UFOs. Podesta’s involvement in UFOdisclosure initiatives is well documented, and spans more than two decadesduring his service in both the Clinton and Obama Presidential administrations.More recently in December 2015, he got Hillary Clinton to publicly pledge tolook into the UFO phenomenon and what was really happening at Area 51. She said:“He [John Podesta] has made me personally pledge we are going to get theinformation out. One way or another. Maybe we could have, like, a task force togo to Area 51.”[257] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn257]Arguably, the most significant among Podesta’s many statements[258][part0000_split_046.html#_edn258] about UFOs and government secrecy was histweet, sent during the final day of his appointment as a Senior Advisor toPresident Obama on February 13, 2015, where he wrote: Figure 56. Podesta Tweet on His Last Day as President Obama's Senior Advisor[../images/00057.jpeg] It is not surprising that Podesta has been secretly corresponding with DeLonge,who gave up his position with Blink-182 to pursue his UFO interest as heexplained in an April 2016 Rolling Stone interview.[259][part0000_split_046.html#_edn259] What the leaked emails confirm for the firsttime is the seriousness attached to DeLonge’s disclosure efforts by Podesta, andthe importance given to it by other very senior people in the US militaryindustrial complex.The first of the hacked Podesta emails that was released by Wikileaks is datedOctober 25, 2015 and says:Hi John-Tom DeLonge here, The one who interviewed you for that special documentary notto long ago. Things are moving with the project. The Novels, Films andNonFiction works are blooming and finishing. Just had a preliminary meeting withSpielberg’s Chief Operating Officer at DreamWorks. More meetings are now on thebooks- I would like to bring two very “important” people out to meet you in DC. Ithink you will find them very interesting, as they were principal leadershiprelating to our sensitive topic. Both were in charge of most fragile divisions,as it relates to Classified Science and DOD topics. Other words, these areA-Level officials. Worth our time, and as well the investment to bring all theway out to you. I just need 2 hours from you.Just looking to have a casual, and private conversation in person…Best,Tom DeLonge.[260] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn260] DeLonge is referring to two very important people familiar with “ClassifiedScience and DOD topics,” which alludes to advanced technologies related to theUFO issue. DeLonge had earlier met with Podesta in January 2015, to interviewhim for an upcoming documentary.[261] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn261] DeLongewould meet with Podesta again, this time accompanied by two important people.The next meeting actually went ahead according to another leaked email. Thisemail reveals that Podesta was scheduled to meet with DeLonge and a number of“important” people involved in his UFO disclosure initiative the next day, onJanuary 25, 2016.[262] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn262]Another of the hacked emails is dated the day of the January 25 meeting, withthe subject header “General McCasland.” DeLonge discusses the General:He mentioned he’s a “skeptic”, he’s not. I’ve been working with him for fourmonths. I just got done giving him a four hour presentation on the entireproject a few weeks ago. Trust me, the advice is already been happening on howto do all this. He just has to say that out loud, but he is very, very aware –as he was in charge of all of the stuff. When Roswell crashed, they shipped itto the laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. General McCasland was incharge of that exact laboratory up to a couple years ago. He not only knows whatI’m trying to achieve, he helped assemble my advisory team. He’s a veryimportant man.Best, Tom DeLonge[263] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn263]In April 2016, a book DeLonge co-authored, Sekret Machines: Chasing Shadows, wasreleased. [264] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn264] It is the first in a plannedmultimedia series of books and documentaries promising to blow the lid off of acover up of secret space programs and the UFO phenomenon. In Sekret Machines,DeLonge describes an unnamed General who helped him put together a team ofadvisors to promote disclosure: I’ve had meetings in mysterious rooms far out in the desert. I’ve had meetingsat the highest levels of NASA. I have had conversations at research centers,think tanks, and even on the phone connected to secret facilities. I’ve beenintroduced to a man whom I call “the Scientist,” and another whom I call “theGeneral.” And there are many more of whom I cannot say much about, but some havebecome true friends, and all have become close counselors. Each of these men hasall held, or currently holds, the highest offices of the military and scientificelite. The point is, I have done it. I have assembled a team of men and women“in the know.” And they all believe I am doing something of value, somethingworth their time and yours.[265] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn265]With the Wikileaks’ release, we now know that the unnamed general is MajorGeneral William Neil McCasland, who up until 2013 was the Commander of a top AirForce Research Laboratory.[266] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn266] What followsis a brief biography of McCasland prior to his retirement:Maj. Gen. William N. McCasland is the Commander, Air Force Research Laboratory,Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. He is responsible for managing the AirForce’s $2.2 billion science and technology program as well as additionalcustomer funded research and development of $2.2 billion. He is also responsiblefor a global workforce of approximately 10,800 people in the laboratory’scomponent technology directorates, 711th Human Performance Wing and the AirForce Office of Scientific Research.[267] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn267]McCasland’s biography clearly establishes that he had the necessary scientificand technical background to be very familiar with the topic of advancedaerospace technologies related to the UFO phenomenon. In earlier chapters, itwas pointed out that the foreign and experimental aircraft facilities atWright-Patterson AFB (then known as Wright Field) was the same location wheresome of the flying saucer remains from both the 1942 Los Angeles Air Raid andthe 1947 Roswell Crash were taken by the Army Air Force.McCasland, however, is not the only USAF General supporting DeLonge. On theback cover of Sekret Machines, an endorsement appears from another retired AirForce General whose last military assignment was Special Assistant to theCommander, Air Force Space Command. Here is what Maj. General Michael Carey hadto say:Sekret Machines scratches at the surface of “who do” we trust with ourclassified technology – certainly our adversaries are aware of our undertakings,as they are doing the same, but what of our citizens, our politicians, even ourown military. Tom DeLonge and A.J. Hartley create a convincing narrativedescribing the “cat and mouse” game that is timeless between strategicadversaries. It has existed under the sea, on the surface of the earth and inits skies, why wouldn’t we believe it occurs in space. Our military leaders havebeen saying space is a contested environment for years now, perhaps we shouldbelieve them! -Maj. Gen. Michael J. Carey.[268][part0000_split_046.html#_edn268]The endorsement by Carey for Delonge’s Sekret Machines confirms that at leasttwo senior retired USAF officers are supporting DeLonge’s disclosure initiative.Both Generals Carey and McCasland attended the January 25, 2016 meeting withPodesta.The hacked emails released by Wikileaks also led to the uncovering of theidentity of the Lockheed Martin official that attended the January 25 meeting.The hacked January 24 email referred to one of the attendees as“rob.f.weiss@lmco.com” who was tracked down via LinkedIn:Rob Weiss can be found on LinkedIn using the email in the WikiLeaks. There, hisjob title is listed as Executive Vice President & General Manager AdvancedDevelopment Programs (Skunk Works) at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. Skunk Worksis the group that built Area 51 at the behest of the CIA, and for decades hasworked on developing top-secret advanced aircraft.[269][part0000_split_046.html#_edn269]Here is how Alejandro Rojas, from Open Minds TV, described the significance ofthe attendees at the January 25 meeting:Whoa! Right? DeLonge is getting a meeting with the head of a research lab famousfor UFO research, a man who worked for the head of Air Force Space Command, aman who is in charge of the people who run Area 51, and the campaign manager ofthe person who is, apparently, as of today, likely to be the next president ofthe United States.[270] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn270]In Sekret Machines, Tom DeLonge spends much time describing corporateinvolvement in developing a secret space program involving the USAF. This bookis the aptly packaged product of what the advisory team has been telling Delongeconcerning their knowledge of the secret space programs that evolved in the USand Russia. According to DeLonge, their revelations are officially sanctioned bythose with “need to know” access. Therefore, this is the most authoritativedisclosure yet to emerge on the topics of UFOs, extraterrestrial life and secretspace programs.The hacked Podesta emails released through Wikileaks clearly confirm thatDeLonge has very senior insiders from the US military industrial complex helpinghim move forward in his UFO disclosure initiative. This leads to theall-important question: Is what the advisory team telling DeLonge the full truthabout these topics, or only a “limited disclosure” initiative when it comes tosecret space programs involving US corporations and different branches of the USmilitary? To get an answer, we need to carefully compare Delonge’s depiction ofthe secret space programs to that which we have learned in previous chaptersfrom the evidence and testimonies presented by William Tompkins and Corey Goode. "},{"pageContent":"THE ROLE OF NAZI GERMANY IN DEVELOPING A SECRET SPACE PROGRAM In Sekret Machines, Delonge divulges information that closely coincides with the“high octane speculations” of the historian, Joseph Farrell, who has closelystudied many Nazi-era documents in a series of books, including The SSBrotherhood of the Bell: Nasa's Nazis, JFK, And Majic-12.[271][part0000_split_046.html#_edn271] We are told by DeLonge and Farrell that NaziGermany was partly successful in developing an antigravity “torsion” and/or“scalar” device called the Bell—Die Glocke. According to Farrell, the Bell waspart of the Nazi attempt to develop a super weapon based on scalar physics,whose use in antiquity was described in ancient scriptures.[272][part0000_split_046.html#_edn272]This is how testing of the Nazi Bell device occurred, as summarized by NickCook, author of The Hunt for Zero Point. Cook interviewed the original source onthe Bell information, who says he saw Nazi documents describing the device:The experiments always took place under a thick ceramic cover involved the rapidspinning of two cylinders in opposite directions. The mercury-like substanceswas code-named “Xerum 525.”… The chamber in which the experiments took place wassituated in a gallery deep belowground…. its walls were covered with ceramictiles ... After approximately ten tests, the room was dismantled and itscomponent parts destroyed. Only the Bell itself was preserved…. Each test lastedfor approximately one minute. During this period while the Bell emitted its paleblue glow, personnel were kept 150 to 200 meters from it. Electrical equipmentanywhere within this radius would usually short-circuit or break down… Duringthe tests, the scientist placed various types of plants, animals and animaltissues in the Bell’s sphere of influence. In the initial test period fromNovember to December 1944, almost all the samples were destroyed.[273][part0000_split_046.html#_edn273]While the Nazi Bell was not successfully weaponized in time to assist the wareffort in Europe according to DeLonge, the Bell was secretly transported toSouth America, and eventually Antarctica in an effort by the Nazis to establisha covert Fourth Reich. The development of the Bell project continued at secretNazi facilities funded by gold and corporate monies taken out of Germany byDeputy Fuhrer, Martin Bormann, which has been well documented by Paul Manning inthe book, Bormann in Exile,[274] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn274] and morerecently by Farrell in The Third Way: The Nazi International, European Union,and Corporate Fascism.[275] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn275]In Sekret Machines, DeLonge describes how the Nazi Bell project was relocated toAntarctica after South American facilities were compromised by covert alliedteams in 1946. The Nazis were able to develop several operational flying saucercraft in Antarctica, which were capable of reaching incredible speeds and werehighly maneuverable in the atmosphere.Operation Highjump, led by Admiral Richard Byrd, was successful in locating theNazi bases in Antarctica in early 1947 and military hostilities ensued.According to Delonge, although Operation Highjump suffered casualties, it wasable to destroy the Nazi facilities and flying saucer prototypes, and take backto the US the recovered booty in terms of scientists, technical information, andresources related to the Nazi Bell research and development program.[276][part0000_split_046.html#_edn276] Here is how DeLonge described one of thedogfights between the Navy’s Mustang aircraft and the Nazi UFOs, as narrated byone of the book’s characters: I had never seen anything airborne move with the agility of the Nazi disk. Itrolled and pivoted over the Antarctic mountains, leaping forward and stoppingabruptly in mid-air as if gravity had no power over it and aerodynamics wereirrelevant. It spun, firing cannon shells, and the Mustangs fell on it like dogson a bear… For all its speed and maneuverability, the saucer was losing. As itturned to fire on one plane, two more swooped in from behind, riddling it withgunfire, and soon it began to smoke…. Moments later the disk exploded in afireball that could be seen for miles.[277] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn277] Personnel at the bases of the breakaway Nazis in Antarctica were next describedas quickly surrendering. Subsequently, the Antarctica based Nazis no longerprovided a significant military challenge to US geopolitical dominance, or toits secret research into antigravity craft using principles of torsion and/orscalar physics.[278] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn278]This is where a March 5, 1947 Chilean press interview with Admiral Byrd, afterthe premature end of Operation High Jump, raises problems with the scenarioDeLonge was told by his advisors. The press report by El Mercurio states: Adm. Byrd declared today that it was imperative for the United States toinitiate immediate defense measures against hostile regions. The Admiral furtherstated that he didn’t want to frighten anyone unduly but it was a bitter realitythat in case of a new war the continental United States would be attacked byflying objects which could fly from pole to pole at incredible speeds.[279][part0000_split_046.html#_edn279] [http://exopolitics.org/Study-Paper-6.htm#_edn41] The tone and message that Admiral Byrd delivered in this interview does notappear consistent with someone who has just experienced a decisive militaryvictory against an enemy with flying saucers, but rather, a resounding defeat.Here, DeLonge’s version of events in Antarctica and genesis of a US secret spaceprogram diametrically opposes Tompkins and Goode’s revelations. According to thelatter, Nazi Germany had two secret space programs that ran concurrently duringWWII. The Bell experiments and research in Nazi occupied Europe was part of anunsuccessful “wonder weapons” program led by Heinrich Himmler’s SS, which wasunder the direct control of the civil engineer and SS Lieutenant General, HansKammler.By contrast, in Antarctica another secret space program was headed by GermanSecret Societies that had successfully developed advanced aerospace technologieswith the help of two different extraterrestrial races. One was a group ofhuman-looking Nordics, while the other was a species of Reptilians calledDraconians. While the Nordics were the first to help the German Secret Societiesin the 1920’s by providing the designs of antigravity spacecraft through mysticssuch as Maria Orsic, it was the Draconians in the 1930’s who ultimately becamemore influential with the Nazi regime and German Secret Societies. According toTompkins, after agreements had been reached with Hitler, the Draconians providedactual working models of flying saucers, and information about underground basesin Antarctica where these models could be reverse engineered during World WarII.[280] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn280]Both Tompkins and Goode insist that the German Secret Space Program inAntarctica continued independently, unencumbered by what was happening in Europeunder Kammler and the Nazi SS, due to their different goals. The program underHimmler’s SS was essentially a weaponization program that was ultimatelyunsuccessful in using antigravity technologies for the war effort. Consequently,Tompkins and Goode agree with DeLonge and Farrell that Nazi SS efforts todevelop weapons technologies such as the Bell were unsuccessful.At the same time, the German Space Program located in Antarctica had as its maingoal to reverse engineer flying saucer designs and prototypes they had acquiredfor deep space travel. Goode said that the separation between the two Germanspace programs was clearly defined. The Antarctica based program did not shareits most advanced weapons research with Himmler’s SS, even in the waning days ofthe war. In response to a question about advanced weapons systems being acquiredby the Antarctica based German program to use for the war effort, Goode said:I think that there were [some] technologies acquired and integrated into theirbreakaway secret space program that they were developing. But they weredeveloping this for their own [purposes] when it came down to it, they didn’tcare about [Germany winning] World War II, the motherland, [or] using thistechnology to defeat the United States and the enemies they were engaged in warwith.[281] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn281]The Germans, in their underground Antarctic bases, subsequently began buildingfleets of antigravity vehicles capable of deep space missions to the Moon, Marsand beyond. According to Tompkins and Goode, the Reptilians had helped theGermans develop sophisticated weapons platforms for their Antarctica-basedspacecraft. This included directed energy weapons that replaced the projectilecannons that the Nazi SS had unsuccessfully attempted to integrate into theirown saucer prototypes. The long term goal was that the armed German spacecraftwould eventually join Reptilian interstellar fleets in galactic conflicts. Goodehas referred to these German space battle groups as the “Dark Fleet,” because itremains so highly classified that relatively little is known about it, even tothe present day.[282] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn282] Consequently, Operation Highjump was a dismal failure with the German flyingsaucers comprehensively destroying the Navy’s best fighter planes at the time.In an interview, Tompkins revealed that as the naval flotilla approached QueenMaud Land (Neuschwabenland), two waves of flying saucers suddenly came out ofthe water and engaged the Navy’s most advanced fighter planes.[283][part0000_split_046.html#_edn283] The first attack wave comprised 27 flyingsaucers, and the second 15, which appeared over a 36 hour period according toTompkins. Some of the saucers had Nazi insignias while others were unmarked. Thesaucers succeeded in destroying all of the Navy airplanes and helicopters, andsank a destroyer and several other ships. Battered and defeated by the Nazisflying saucer fleets, the rest of the elite Naval aircraft carrier battle groupwas allowed to turn back for home.Tompkins and Goode’s version of events in Antarctica is supported not only byinitial interviews given by Admiral Byrd to the Chilean Press, but also by KGBfiles citing the ease with which the German flying saucers shot down the Navyaircraft, as reported in two eyewitness accounts. After the Soviet collapse in1991, the KGB released previously classified files that cast light on OperationHighjump. A 2006 Russian documentary made public for the first time a 1947secret Soviet intelligence report commissioned by Joseph Stalin on OperationHighjump.[284] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn284] In the Soviet intelligencereport, never before known testimony was released from two US Navy servicemenwith Operation Highjump. The most telling was by Lieutenant John Sayerson, aflying boat pilot, who is quoted as saying:The thing shot vertically out of the water at tremendous velocity, as thoughpursued by the devil, and flew between the masts [of the ship] at such a highspeed that the radio antenna oscillated back and forth in its turbulence. Anaircraft [Martin flying-boat] from the Currituck that took off just a fewmoments later was struck with an unknown type of ray from the object, and almostinstantly crashed into the sea near our vessel…. About ten miles away, thetorpedo-boat Maddox burst into flames and began to sink… Having personallywitnessed this attack by the object that flew out of the sea, all I can say is,it was frightening.”[285] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn285]In DeLonge’s version of the dogfight between a Nazi flying saucer and the Navyfighters, the flying saucer used cannons. In contrast, according to Sayerson,the Nazi flying saucer used a directed energy weapon that not only took outfighter planes, but also ships.There is controversy over whether or not a “USS Maddox” served with OperationHighjump, as claimed by Sayerson. Perhaps he was simply mistaken in describingthe name of the destroyed torpedo boat, or the name was mistakenly altered inthe translation process. Despite unresolved questions over this element inSayerson’s testimony, it is more than likely that the 1947 Soviet report islargely accurate. If so, then the Soviets had learned that the US Navy hadsuffered a resounding defeat at the hands of the Nazi flying saucer craft hiddenin an underground base under the Antarctica ice shelf.Byrd’s Naval expedition returned empty handed, and with a painful lesson thatthe Antarctica based Germans would be a powerful geo-political force for yearsto come. Once again, this is a very different account of the Nazi presence inAntarctica to that found in Sekret Machines. Why the discrepancy? Beforeanswering, I need to examine the next major element in Sekret Machines—thesecret development of the TR-3B “Locust” dual purpose antigravity aircraft andspacecraft. "},{"pageContent":"USAF SPACE COMMAND’S TR-3B FLYING TRIANGLES In Sekret Machines, DeLonge spends much time describing the corporateinvolvement in developing a secret US space program. According to him, a globalconsortium of corporations secretly funded the development of flying triangles,using antigravity and torsion field principles adopted from the Nazi Bellexperiments. These resulted in the development of a squadron of TR-3B’s basedout of Area 51’s highly secretive S-4 facility at Papoose Lake. The US Air ForceSpace Command and Defense Intelligence Agency is in charge of the TR-3B or‘Locust’, operating out of S-4, according to Delonge via his advisory team.Delonge went on to explain in Sekret Machines that the TR-3B is a combined USmilitary and corporate made aerospace vehicle capable of operating both near theEarth’s surface as a conventional aircraft, and in near Earth orbit as aspacecraft. He described different sized TR-3B vehicles, with the largest beingseveral hundred feet across.DeLonge’s information about the TR-3B closely matches another earlier account byEdgar Fouche, an aerospace engineer, who worked at Area 51. While there, helearned about the TR-3B’s existence as the most highly classified aerospacevehicle built by the US military industrial complex in the late 1980’s. In 1998,Fouche first came forward to reveal the TR-3B’s existence; that it was stationedat the S-4 facility, and was as much as 600 feet wide, which is similar to whatDelonge later claims he was told by his advisory team.[286][part0000_split_046.html#_edn286]Documents provided by Fouche add much credibility to his testimony, which isalso supported by the many flying triangle sightings reported in Belgium, andelsewhere.[287] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn287] Indeed, Sekret Machinesexplains the 1989 Belgium sightings as directly related to flights of theTR-3B.[288] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn288] Figure 57. Illustration of TR-3B. Source: Edgar Fouche[../images/00058.jpeg] Once again, the testimony of Tompkins and Goode differs dramatically toDeLonge’s information, as provided to him by his advisory team. In chapter four,I presented Tompkins’ information concerning his direct involvement in thedesign of space battle groups that would be under the control of the Navy. Tobriefly summarize, in the 1950’s Tompkins conceptualized different designs forkilometers-long space carriers and cruisers. The space battle groups wereconstructed in massive underground facilities in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah,and were first deployed in 1984 as the Solar Warden program. Eight battle groupswere eventually constructed, and these rotate with four in service at any time,while the other four undergo maintenance—similar to the scheduling of aircraftcarriers.Goode has said that he directly served in Solar Warden from 1987 to 2007.Significantly, he says that the TR-3B became outdated with the deployment ofSolar Warden space fleets, and was allotted as a hand-me-down to less classifiedprograms run by the Air Force and other groups:There were more than 8 of the “Cigar” shaped carrier class and other class ofvessels of various sizes and classifications. They were designed to carryvarious type of “craft” that many think of as the TR-3B… The TR-3B is consideredextremely outdated technology and in many cases has been gifted as “hand medown” craft to “Elites” within the Secret Earth Governments and their Syndicatesas something akin to “Company Jets”. There are so many newer technologies thatare of the same general shape as the TR-3B (& models that came after) that itwould blow people’s minds.[289] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn289]Consequently, what Goode and Tompkins’ testimonies show is that the TR-3B ispart of a second tier US secret space program run out of Area 51. "},{"pageContent":"ARE EXTRATERRESTRIALS REAL? In Sekret Machines, an incident is described where an apparent UFO abductionoccurs, but the supposed “Grey” extraterrestrial is unmasked by its femalevictim and shown to be a human disguised in an alien costume.[290][part0000_split_046.html#_edn290] After escaping the remote facility where sheis being held, the victim learns that she had been taken to Siberia by a covertRussian group.[291] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn291] The abduction incident isdepicted to be part of a Russian secret space program, which usestechnologically advanced arrow-shaped aerospace vehicles similar in flightperformance to the TR-3B.[292] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn292]Delonge describes other UFO incidents involving covert Russian spacecraft. Theseinclude UFO incidents at US nuclear facilities which led to them beingdeactivated. The Russian spacecraft were allegedly interfering with the US nukesas a means of demonstrating Russia’s ability to deactivate and even destroyAmerica’s nuclear arsenal. Consequently, it is not extraterrestrials behind manyUFO incidents such as abductions and nuclear weapons deactivation, but Russiansecret spacecraft according to DeLonge’s version, which is based on informationfrom his advisory team. Especially relevant here is the language General Careyused in his endorsement of Sekret Machines:Tom DeLonge and A.J. Hartley create a convincing narrative describing the “catand mouse” game that is timeless between strategic adversaries. It has existedunder the sea, on the surface of the earth and in its skies, why wouldn’t webelieve it occurs in space.[293] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn293]He is all but naming Russia as the strategic adversary that has long battled theUS in all strategic theaters of operation, including more recently, space.Once again, there is a dramatic difference here with what Tompkins and Goodehave to say about extraterrestrials and secret space programs, especially whenit comes to long term strategic threats. Earlier, I commented on their accountsof Nazi Germany being assisted by Reptilian and Nordic extraterrestrial groupsat different stages in their development of two secret space programs. Later,according to Tompkins, Nordic extraterrestrials assisted the US Navy program toestablish space battle groups. The Nordics were seeking allies in their galacticconflict with the Draconian Reptilians, and believed that the Navy wouldeventually become one.Tompkins says that Nordic extraterrestrials were embedded in aerospace companieswhere he worked, such as Douglas Aircraft Company and TRW, and actively helpedin the research and development of antigravity spacecraft. He asserts that theNordics helped counter the industrial sabotage by Reptilians in both the NASAand the nascent Navy secret space program.Goode also says that the Solar Warden and Dark Fleet programs coordinate withdifferent extraterrestrial visitors. In addition, he states that the corporaterun space program has industrial scale manufacturing centers on Mars that tradewith up to 900 extraterrestrial civilizations.[294][part0000_split_046.html#_edn294] DeLonge, however, proposes a wildcard toexplain stories of encounters with advanced extraterrestrial visitors and thediscoveries of non-human constructed spacecraft. He refers to mythologicalaccounts of the “Gods” as referred to throughout history, and suggests thesewere not flights of fancy by ancient peoples, but real beings that manipulatedhumanity for both positive and negative agendas.[295][part0000_split_046.html#_edn295]In Homer’s Illiad, for example, the reader of this epic poem learns how the Godstook different sides in this war in ancient times between the Greeks andTrojans—the superpowers of that region of the world back then. The conflict waswholly contrived by a mischievous Goddess called Eris, who rolled her “goldenapple of discord” at the foot of the Gods, and set off a chain of events thatled to the Trojan War.Sekret Machines ends on a cliffhanger regarding the role of the Gods and currentsecret space programs. It is expected that future volumes will describedifferent ways in which the Gods have helped foment geo-political conflictbetween major world powers such as the US and Russia—the modern equivalents toAncient Greece and Troy. This is likely to involve the recovery of highlyadvanced non-human spacecraft at various crash retrieval sites, which DeLongeattributes to the Gods. These are modern day versions of the golden apples ofdiscord that are planted by the Gods. "},{"pageContent":"LIMITED VERSUS FULL DISCLOSURE How does one account for the significant differences between the secret spaceprogram disclosures by Delonge and his advisory team, and those of Tompkins andGoode? If one accepts Tompkins and Goode’s testimonies as fundamentallyaccurate, as my analysis of the documentary evidence in this book suggests, thenthere are two scenarios which come to mind to explain these discrepancies.The first is that we are dealing with a “limited hangout,” which according toVictor Marchetti, a former Special Assistant to the CIA Deputy Director, is “spyjargon for a favorite and frequently used gimmick of the clandestineprofessionals.” [296] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn296] Marchetti went on todescribe how a limited hangout works:When their veil of secrecy is shredded and they can no longer rely on a phonycover story to misinform the public, they resort to admitting—sometimes evenvolunteering—some of the truth while still managing to withhold the key anddamaging facts in the case. The public, however, is usually so intrigued by thenew information that it never thinks to pursue the matter further. [297][part0000_split_046.html#_edn297]A limited hangout scenario suggests that DeLonge is being fed a well-craftednarrative by his advisory team and the intelligence community, who believe theircover stories for the UFO phenomenon no longer have credibility.[298][part0000_split_046.html#_edn298] The new narrative is designed to appeal towidespread public belief in a UFO cover-up, by revealing some of the advancedtechnologies developed in deep black programs, which would account for the UFOphenomenon dating back to the World War II era.While the public learns of antigravity spacecraft, they are told that theextraterrestrial hypothesis—that UFOs are interplanetary spacecraft—is false.The only ‘alien’ factor involved here are the elusive Gods mentioned inhistorical texts who today are manipulating the US and Russia into a nuclearwar, or planting advanced spacecraft in remote locations as “golden apples ofdiscord.” The preceding scenario will appeal not only to scientific skeptics,but also to followers from different religions who can view this information asconfirming the legitimacy of their scriptures.What this scenario conveys is that DeLonge is being given access to genuineinformation that is part of a limited hangout operation by senior members of theUS military industrial complex. We know from the leaked emails released byWikileaks that his advisory team includes retired USAF Major Generals McCaslandand Carey, and the current head of Lockeheed’s Skunkworks, Rob Weiss. Thesethree, plus the seven others making up DeLonge’s advisory team, appear to becarefully crafting a narrative through DeLonge that maintains the legitimacy ofthe military industrial complex. It is modeled for some kind of officialacknowledgement of a secret space program based at Area 51 which uses the TR-3B.After all, if there are Gods hidden in the shadows manipulating both Russia andthe US into having a nuclear conflict over advanced technologies, then the wholeissue concerning secret space programs becomes firmly embedded in nationalsecurity concerns. It is important to keep in mind that this narrative was notonly being fed to DeLonge, but also through him to Podesta, and then certainlyon to the unsuccessful 2016 Presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, who alsohas a long association with the UFO topic dating back to Bill Clinton’sPresidential administration.[299] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn299]A second scenario to be explored is that Delonge’s advisors, who we know arevery senior figures in the military industrial complex, are simply out of theloop when it comes to the most advanced secret space program technologies.Delonge has repeatedly said that his advisors work at or are familiar with Area51 facilities, where the TR-3B is based. We know that is certainly the case forLevin, since Skunkworks has had a long historical relationship with Area 51,dating back to its founding in the 1950’s. Also, Major General McCasland wouldhave certainly been aware of Area 51 projects, given the long historicalrelationship between Area 51 and the research laboratories at Wright PattersonAir Force Base when it comes to studying retrieved UFOs.According to Tompkins, however, it is in large underground facilities in Utah’sWasatch Mountains where the Navy’s space battle fleets have been secretlyconstructed. Tompkins says that the construction facilities employ the samemodular construction technique used for the building of the navy’s aircraftcarriers and submarines at Newport News Shipbuilding facilities, which from 2001to 2009, was owned by Northrup Grumman. He explains that Northrup Grumman is theprimary corporation for building the Navy’s secret space battle craft usingsimilar construction techniques to those used to build aircraft carriers andnuclear submarines.What this material implies is that there is a secret space program run bymilitary entities such as US Air Force Space Command, the Defense IntelligenceAgency (DIA), and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which is entirelyseparate to the program the US Navy has been doing in the Wasatch Mountains withthe assistance of select corporate contractors. The compartmentalization processis so successful between the different space programs that USAF/DIA/NROpersonnel do not believe that such a Navy run space program exists.Such views date back to the creation of Project RAND in October 1945. Aspresented in chapter three, Army Air Force leaders such as General Curtis LeMay“considered space operations to be an extension of air operations.”[300][part0000_split_046.html#_edn300] This led to the Navy being pushed into asecondary support role in developing future generations of satellites, whichcame under the jurisdiction of the USAF, and the National Reconnaissance Officewhen it was created in 1961. This meant that dealing with UFOs and theextraterrestrial phenomenon would come under the purview of the USAF and theNRO. Put simply, the USAF and NRO would dominate space affairs, while the Navywould remain focused on what was happening on and beneath the world’s oceans.The RAND Corporation subsequently worked closely with the USAF in developing andimplementing a coordinated space policy dealing with the extraterrestrialphenomenon, with the Navy apparently doing little more than just monitoring thesituation. As William Tompkins attests, however, little did USAF leaders realizethat the Navy had not conceded space affairs to the Air Force at all!Instead, while the USAF and NRO worked on building satellites, spy planes,stealth space stations, and squadrons of antigravity craft out of Area 51 fornear Earth space operations, the Navy worked on large battle groups for deepspace operations out of its Wasatch mountains facilities. While the USAF and NROconducted research and development out of state of the art aerospacelaboratories at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, the Navy had its own, arguablymore advanced, laboratories at China Lake. It is important to remember thatTompkins said he travelled to China Lake approximately 40 times during the war,carrying briefing packets about the Nazi space programs and differentextraterrestrial visitors.Consequently, it is not surprising that personnel participating in a secretspace program run by the USAF and NRO, along with the DIA, would not know aboutthe Navy’s space program. This is vividly illustrated in abduction incidentsdescribed by Goode. He says that sometime in January-February 2016, he wasabducted at least three times by covert teams associated with the USAF/NRO/DIAwho interrogated him.[301] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn301] This was followedwith him being abducted again by the same group in late September 2016, where amore senior USAF officer interrogated him.[302][part0000_split_046.html#_edn302] Apparently, some of the intelligence released since September 2014 by Goode,concerning secret space programs, was accurate enough to come to the attentionof a “lower level secret space program” (Goode’s term for it) run by the USAFSpace Command and its NRO and DIA partners. Subsequently, he was subjected to amilitary abduction by individuals he concluded were part of the USAF SpaceCommand.[303] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn303] He described the September 2016incident involving the more senior USAF officer: As I was focused on what they were doing, another person came into the room. Thetwo airmen snapped to attention. All three of the men were wearing Air Forceuniforms without any patches to indicate who they were. The last person to enterthe room had white hair, a white goatee beard, and a very serious look on hisface. He sat in the chair next to me while the two airmen once again took hairand blood samples from me. After putting away the samples, they were told toleave the room. The man who was obviously in charge addressed me by my firstname. He began to ask random questions about the LOC [Lunar Operations Command]and the status of the SSP Alliance.[304] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn304] Goode stated that he experienced the military abductions on a spacecraft thatwas clearly less advanced than those belonging to what he has described as aSecret Space Program Alliance, which includes significant elements of the Navy’sSolar Warden program.[305] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn305]Goode’s interrogators could not find any information about him in theirdatabases, which is not surprising given the level of compartmentalizationinvolved in different unacknowledged Special Access Programs. Cover stories andother methods are used to hide these programs from those without “need to know”access.[306] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn306] In this regard, a 1992 supplementto a Department of Defense document titled: “National Industrial SecurityProgram Operating Manual,” states the need for cover stories when it comes tounacknowledged programs:Program Cover stories. (UNACKNOWLEDGED Program). Cover stories may beestablished for unacknowledged programs in order to protect the integrity of theprogram from individuals who do not have a need to know. Cover stories must bebelievable and cannot reveal any information regarding the true nature of thecontract. Cover stories for Special Access Programs must have the approval ofPSO [Program Security Officer] prior to dissemination.[307][part0000_split_046.html#_edn307] Figure 58. USAF/DIA/NRO Spacecraft which Landed Near Corey Goode's Home.Credit: Gaia TV[../images/00059.jpeg]Goode said that all his records were scrubbed upon returning to civilian life in1986, after he was age-regressed and sent back in time after completing his 20year tour of duty in 2007.[308] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn308] During one ofGoode’s interrogations, attempts were made to brainwash him into believing thatextraterrestrials weren’t real and that the “higher level space programs” he wasdiscussing—Solar Warden, Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate and DarkFleet—did not exist.[309] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn309] In an interview,Goode recalled what one of his Air Force interrogators said:One of them began telling me, “You know that all of these beings are not reallyaliens. They're just us from the future from two different timelines.” And Icouldn't really respond. And he was saying that the Nordic type of people are usfrom the future. And these little grey beings are us from a different timelinein the future. And they are coming back to try to fight over the timelines. Andthey were stating that the Greys, their genetics had broken down so badly in thefuture that they were coming back to get genetic stock as well.[310][part0000_split_046.html#_edn310]According to this interpretation of the extraterrestrial phenomenon, all allegedcontact cases involve humans from the future, either Nordics or Greys, whichhave genetically evolved from present day humanity. All this is very significantgiven what DeLonge has been told by his advisory team, and what presumably hepassed on to John Podesta about the secret space program out of Area 51.Essentially, the military services involved in Goode’s abductions are convincedthat his disclosures about extraterrestrial life are part of an elaboratedisinformation campaign by an Unacknowledged Special Access Program. Asmentioned earlier, personnel in these programs are instructed to use coverstories to hide the truth of their activities. Goode’s abductors clearlybelieved that his secret space program disclosures were an elaborate coverstory. It’s noteworthy that the USAF officer that interrogated him during theSeptember 2016 abduction was highly skeptical of his story, as Goode narrated:I asked how I should address him and he looked at me as if I was an idiot. Hesaid, “Just call me Sir.” I asked him why I was being picked up again, and whyhe was so skeptical after the last time when I was tricked into outing threemembers of the SSP Alliance. He stated he was here to repeat the process ofgathering evidence and then keep the chain of custody of the evidence. He statedthis was to rule out the possibility that the previous team had made a mistakeor had tampered with the results.He went on to say that he could not accept that I was telling the truth. Theinformation I had provided was too far outside the scope of his briefings. Hestated that it was possible that the SSP Alliance was merely a few people fromhis own program who had gone rogue.[311] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn311]Goode’s recollections of the USAF officer’s statements indicate that fulldisclosure is not just a matter of the general public learning about the broadertruth behind secret space programs and extraterrestrial visitors, but also formilitary and corporate personnel to come up to speed. The compartmentalizationprocess means that what is considered “full disclosure” by one level of thesecrecy system is but a “limited disclosure” at more highly classified levels.This is illustrated by the following NSA leaked slide showing how different DHS,DOD, and NSA classified programs are hidden within less classified programs. Dueto compartmentalization, those in less classified ‘cover’ programs would be outof the loop on the more highly classified programs. Consequently, the scenariodescribed by Goode in terms of his abduction by USAF Space Command personnel isentirely plausible. Figure 59. Edward Snowden Leaked NSA Slide on Sentry Eagle[../images/00060.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":" CONCLUSION Both Goode and Tompkin’s testimonies portray a deeper layer of secret spaceprogram operations and technologies, far exceeding anything happening in nearEarth orbit under the control of the USAF/DIA/NRO. Due to compartmentalization,this deeper level space program, Solar Warden, is not known by personnel workingon antigravity spacecraft such as TR-3B under the USAF/DIA/NRO. It is thereforevery feasible that corporations and personnel working on classified aerospaceprograms at Area 51 are out of the loop on the Solar Warden program.It is also plausible that the advisory team of ten senior corporate and militarypersonnel feeding DeLonge intelligence may be part of a limited hangoutoperation. They are intentionally spilling the beans on what has been takingplace at Area 51, but only in order to keep hidden even more important secretprograms happening elsewhere. Alternatively, DeLonge’s advisory team may begenuinely in the dark about the Navy led Secret Space Program based out of theWasatch Mountains, and its current operations in deep space.Despite the question of which of the above two scenarios better explains what ishappening with DeLonge and his advisors, the disclosures in Sekret Machinesgenuinely reveal the first layer of a multilayered set of secret space programs.Wikileaks documents prove that covert leaders in the USAF Secret Space Programhave chosen DeLonge to be part of an officially sanctioned disclosureinitiative. DeLonge’s initiative became a factor in the 2016 US Presidentialelection through Podesta’s involvement, and his chairmanship of the ClintonPresidential Campaign. Unfortunately, for Podesta and Clinton, Donald Trumpsurprised everyone with his election win."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11PILLARS OF DISCLOSURE: PRESIDENT TRUMP’S RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE NAVY, FBI &RUSSIA On November 8, 2016, Donald Trump surprised most political pundits and medianetworks with his Presidential election victory over Hillary Clinton. Trumpstruck a chord with middle class Americans, who had become disenchanted with theglobalization process and the resulting loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs.Trump’s plan for reinvigorating the country’s manufacturing industry led towidespread support from millions of Americans fearful of what the future wouldbring if the political status quo was maintained. His victory requires anexamination of how his administration will impact the prospects for “officialdisclosure” of secret space programs and extraterrestrial life.There are three key institutional relationships that are very important foranticipating the policies of a Trump Presidential administration, especiallywhen it comes to some kind of official disclosure. First, during thePresidential campaign, Trump said that he would rebuild the Navy, whoseocean-going fleets had been radically impacted by budgetary cutbacks. Second,Trump was directly helped by the Director of the Federal Bureau ofInvestigations (FBI), James Comey, whose brief reopening of an investigation ofHillary Clinton only two weeks before the Presidential elections played adecisive role in his victory.[312] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn312] Finally,Trump’s positive references to Russia and its leader, President Vladimir Putin,indicated that he wants to radically change the present strained relationsbetween the US and Russia in a manner that would significantly impact globalaffairs.The ways in which Trump develops his administration’s institutionalrelationships with the Navy, the FBI and the Russian Federation will be verysignificant in terms of how much he will be able to publicly disclose about thesecret space programs and extraterrestrial life. If these relationships areproperly cultivated, then his administration may go well beyond DeLonge’s“limited disclosure” concerning the USAF’s secret space program, and create theconditions for “full disclosure” of all secret space programs to occur. Fulldisclosure, in particular, would not only dramatically reinvigorate the USmanufacturing industry in building advanced technologies for mass publicconsumption, but lead to revolutionary global changes.

On October 21, 2016, Trumpmade a major policy speech in Pennsylvania outlying his grand plan:Our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I. My plan will build the 350ship Navy we need. This will be the largest effort at rebuilding our militarysince Ronald Reagan, and it will require a truly national effort. ThePhiladelphia Navy Yard is a perfect example. I will instruct my Secretary of theNavy to study locations like Philadelphia with a long history of service to ourmilitary and proximity to vibrant private industry and find ways to involve themin this national effort.As our fleet is rebuilt, we'll need to invest in recruiting the skilled Americancraftsmen we need, like welders and pipe fitters and so much more. We willestablish ‘centers of excellence’ in places like Philadelphia and Portsmouth,New Hampshire and Hampton Roads in Virginia to produce the master craftsmen weneed to rebuild our Fleet. We will rebuild our navy and we will do it withAmerican steel made right here in Pennsylvania.[313][part0000_split_046.html#_edn313]In a memo, Trump’s senior military defense advisor, Alexander Gray, referred tothe plan to rebuild the Navy’s fleets as a new “Manhattan Project”: Donald Trump has promised to rebuild America with American hands and Americansteel. On Day One of his administration, he will immediately begin to fulfillthat promise with a Manhattan Project urgency to rebuild our navy, which hasshrunk under the Obama-Clinton years to its lowest level since World War I.[314][part0000_split_046.html#_edn314] Trump’s Navy policy has proved to be popular, judging by its support by retiredNavy officers. Among the list of 88 flag officers who signed a letter supportingTrump’s candidacy, the most signatures came from the Navy; 34 Admirals signedthe petition, along with an additional two Coast Guard Admirals, and two MarineCorps Generals.[315] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn315]Trump’s Navy policy promises to be truly groundbreaking in terms of what it willopen up for the Navy’s future development of its Solar Warden Secret SpaceProgram. The Navy’s eight battle groups, secretly built and deployed in the1980’s, are currently operational. However, according to William Tompkins, theNavy plans to replace these existing battle groups, which are becomingantiquated in comparison with other space programs, with twelve new battlegroups that are currently under development. These are tentatively scheduled tobecome fully operational in the 2030’s, replicating the 50 year lifecycle ofmodern aircraft carriers. In a February 25, 2016 interview exchange betweenTompkins [WT] and myself [MS], he elaborated upon the Navy’s plans. [WT] All of the main eight Solar Warden battle groups are old, real old. Theyare in the process of being completely replaced by 12 new ones. Which is a majorprogram going on, because they are very old. [MS] So the current plan involves 12 battle groups under … development. [WT] They are completely new, everything is new. Not just the ship … [new]hardware, everything. [MS] When will they be deployed? [WT] – I think first deployment will be two [battle groups] in 2031, or close. [MS] – They are under current design and manufacture … [WT] – It’s all part of the stage. They have built a real fast program to get aprototype. They are four kilometers long rather that one kilometer.[316][part0000_split_046.html#_edn316] Such an undertaking will clearly require enormous funds and resources that wouldstrain the Navy’s share of the Pentagon’s “deep black budget,” which wasestimated to be $1.7 trillion per year by the end of the Clinton administrationin January 2001.[317] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn317] To fully appreciate thesignificance of such a vast sum, consider that the proposed Pentagon budget for2017 was only $582 billion.[318] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn318] This meansthat the deep black budget used by the Navy, Air Force and other secret spaceprograms was, back in the year 2000, three times the current Pentagon budgettoday! Trump’s support for rebuilding the Navy surface fleets with “ManhattanProject urgency” comes as a clear signal by him and his senior advisors thatthey would be receptive to a policy of prioritizing the construction of a newgeneration of kilometers-long spacecraft for the Navy’s Solar Warden program.This raises the question of whether Trump was covertly supported by groupsallied with the Solar Warden program and other connected government agenciesduring the Presidential Campaign. The Wikileaks’ documents, for example, greatlyassisted the Trump campaign by exposing much about the shortcomings of HillaryClinton and her senior campaign advisors. While Clinton accused Russia of beingbehind the leaks,[319] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn319] the real culprit,according to Corey Goode, was an “Earth Alliance” that coordinates with theNavy’s Solar Warden program.[320] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn320]Goode says that the Earth Alliance comprises multiple factions and organizationsinvolved in various supply, support and command roles when it comes to thedifferent secret space programs. The Earth Alliance includes “White Hats” amongthe military industrial elite, the intelligence community of the US, and manyother major countries that are supportive of the goals of the Solar Wardenprogram, along with its allies that make up what Goode describes as the “SecretSpace Program Alliance.” In addition, the Earth Alliance includes the BRICSnations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) which are intent oncreating a new global financial system.In a November 3, 2016 update, Goode relayed intelligence from his sources thatthe Earth Alliance, which includes operatives from the Navy and the FBI, hadindeed supported the Trump campaign. Among the reasons given was that theAlliance perceived Trump as someone who would avoid embroiling the US in warswith major nations that could result in global calamity: TRUMP IS BEING BACKED BY THE ALLIANCE… Donald Trump is indeed being backed by the Alliance. Trump is certainly notentering into this battle free from his own baggage. He has said and done avariety of things that are upsetting to people. He does not, however, representa group that actively seeks to kill billions of people by starting World War IIIas soon as possible.[321] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn321]Previously, Goode said that both the Secret Space Program Alliance and the EarthAlliance would use document releases as their preferred method of ensuringpolicy changes, and for disclosing the truth about secret space programs. Inresponse to a question regarding this, Goode said: A full disclosure event would consist of a major data dump on the Internet withmany hundreds of thousands of document, audio and video files on multiplemirrored sites for everyone to have access to. There would be a collapse of thecorporate media machine and a 24/7 television and radio education campaign wouldbe initiated. Not all channels and stations would be co-opted so people are notoverwhelmed and could “tune out” as they needed to due to the stress.[322][part0000_split_046.html#_edn322] Consequently, it is highly plausible that some of the documents that camethrough Wikileaks were orchestrated by the Earth Alliance, as Goode contends.This raises the question of whether support for Trump was also due to him beingidentified by Navy/Solar Warden officials as someone representing a rare andvaluable opportunity to them. In Trump, did they see a man who would be willingto dedicate his Presidential administration to creating another ManhattanProject, devoted to quickly building a new generation of space battle groups?Trump’s real estate background in large construction ventures undeniablypredisposes him toward supporting such a grandiose vision and project. Thishelps explain why Tompkins says the Navy is “100% behind Trump.”[323][part0000_split_046.html#_edn323]Goode’s claim that the Earth Alliance supported Trump does add weight to thepossibility that he was identified as someone who would help the Navy convertits secret space program into a publicly supported program, reminiscent of StarTrek’s fictional “Star Fleet.” Since Gene Rodenberry developed Star Trek in the1960’s as a result of his collaboration with Leslie Stevens, who had beeninformed about the Navy’s plans for building secret space fleets by his father,Vice Admiral Leslie Stevens, a natural progression may be taking place. If StarTrek was indeed planned to be a form of “soft disclosure,” then it was foreseenby the Navy that one day Solar Warden would have to be revealed and convertedfrom a highly classified program into a publicly supported space program likeNASA. This would require “full disclosure” under a President who could motivatethe American public into believing in such an enormously expensive “ManhattanProject,” and to then build the next generation of Solar Warden space battlegroups in record time.An important clue to Trump’s favorable Navy policies of the future is hisappointment of Stephen Kevin Bannon as his chief strategist, equal in status tohis Chief of Staff.[324] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn324] Bannon is a retiredNavy officer with experience on aircraft carrier battle groups, as described ina brief biographical description on the Breitbart website: Before entering the business world, Mr. Bannon was in the military. For sevenyears, he was a surface warfare officer in the Navy. He served in battle groupsthat were stationed in the Arabian Sea and in the Persian Gulf. After that, hewas stationed at the Pentagon, becoming special assistant to the chief of navaloperations during President Ronald Reagan’s first term. [325][part0000_split_046.html#_edn325] Mystery surrounds Bannon’s work in advising the Chief of Naval Operations, sincerecords of his military career have not been publicly released. A clue comesfrom an officer who served with him, retired Rear Admiral Edward “Sonny” Masso,who said: He’s a pretty extraordinary guy … He’s very good at multi-tasking, and he can doamazing things. He was absolutely a good sailor and naval officer.[326][part0000_split_046.html#_edn326] It is possible that during his Naval service, Bannon learned about the Navy’ssecret space program and about different extraterrestrial visitors. Indeed, as a“special assistant” to the Chief of Naval Operations, he may have evenparticipated in or known about the classified briefings Reagan received about anextraterrestrial threat during his first term.After January 20, 2017, President Trump will be in a position to move forwardwith a Navy backed full disclosure initiative that will reveal advancedtechnologies that truly revolutionize life as we know it. Trump’s emergingrelationship with, and support for, the Navy is therefore a vital ingredient forfull disclosure. Yet, there is another relationship that is equally important inorder for full disclosure to move forward. "},{"pageContent":"THE FBI, FLYING SAUCERS, TRUMP & DISCLOSURE In chapter one, it was mentioned that exactly one week after major newspapershad reported the Roswell flying saucer crash, FBI Director, J. Edgar Hoover,handwrote on a July 15, 1947 Memorandum: “\"We must insist upon full access todisks recovered.”[327] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn327] The newspaper articleswere generated by an official US Army Air Force Press Release, made public onthe morning of July 8, which was authorized by the Base Commander of RoswellArmy Air Field, Colonel William Blanchard. By the afternoon, the initial ArmyAir Force Press Release was retracted by a more senior officer, General RogerRamey, who said the object was a misidentified weather balloon. The twoexperienced Air Force Intelligence officers, who examined the Roswell debris,had simply got it wrong according to Ramey. Hoover’s handwritten message clearlyrevealed that he did not accept Ramey’s explanation, and wanted the FBI to begiven access.Hoover’s handwritten message specifically referred to yet another earlierincident where a flying saucer had crashed in “the La case,” and the Army deniedaccess to the FBI.[328] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn328] Hoover was very likelyreferring to the Los Angeles Air Raid incident on February 24/25, 1942. A leaked“Majestic document” reveals that in July 1947, the Army Air Force had once againdenied the FBI access to a crashed flying saucer stored at the time at LosAlamos National Laboratory.[329] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn329]A number of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) documents refer to the FBI’shistoric interest in the flying saucer/UFO phenomenon.[330][part0000_split_046.html#_edn330] It is not very surprising that the FBI wouldhave shown an interest in the flying saucer phenomenon, given widespread publicsightings and involvement by citizens around the country. The most significantof the FOIA FBI documents is one confirming that Hoover wanted the FBI to launcha public investigation into the flying saucer phenomenon, provided the FBI wasgiven access to crashed saucers by the [Army] Air Force.[331][part0000_split_046.html#_edn331] The FBI was not given access, however, andHoover subsequently ordered FBI agents not to work with the Air Force’s publicinvestigation into UFOs. In 1953, this Air Force investigation was renamedProject Blue Book, and it continued until 1969 when it was closed.[332][part0000_split_046.html#_edn332]While today the FBI is generally regarded as a domestic national crime fightingorganization with minimal intelligence operations in foreign nations, this wasnot always the case. The FBI traces its origin to an investigative unitestablished on July 26, 1908 in the Justice Department, which a year later wasrenamed the “Bureau of Investigations.” In 1935, Hoover became the firstDirector of the newly renamed “Federal Bureau of Investigations.” As World WarII loomed, Roosevelt authorized the creation of a counterintelligence branchwithin the FBI to work with Army and Navy intelligence in combatting the Nazimenace. On June 26, 1939, Roosevelt released the following PresidentialDirective:It is my desire that the investigation of all espionage, counter-espionage, andsabotage matters be controlled and handled by the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation of the Department of Justice, the Military Intelligence Division[MID] of the War Department, and the Office of Naval Intelligence [ONI] of theNavy Department. The Directors of these three agencies are to function as acommittee to coordinate their activities.[333] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn333]Roosevelt subsequently authorized the FBI to take responsibility forcounterintelligence and covert operations in the Western Hemisphere. This is howa June 24, 1940 State Department Memorandum described the division of globalintelligence, and counterintelligence responsibilities between the Army, Navyand FBI: The President said that he wished that the field should be divided. The FBIshould be responsible for foreign intelligence work in the Western Hemisphere …The existing Military Intelligence and Naval Intelligence branches should coverthe rest of the world, as and when necessity arises.[334][part0000_split_046.html#_edn334] On July 1, 1940, Hoover subsequently launched the \"Special Intelligence Service\"as a branch of the FBI that would exclusively conduct US intelligence operationsin the Western Hemisphere. Consequently, up until the creation of the CentralIntelligence Group (forerunner to the CIA) in January 1946, it was the FBI thatwas responsible for intelligence operations in South America. Here is how theFBI website describes its Special Intelligence Service:By 1940, South America had become a hotbed of German intrigue. More thanhalf-a-million German emigrants—many supporters of the Third Reich—had settledin Brazil and Argentina alone. In line with the Bureau’s earlier intelligencework on threats posed by Germany, Roosevelt wanted to keep an eye on Naziactivities in our neighbors to the south. And when the U.S. joined the Alliedcause in 1941, the President wanted to protect the nation from Hitler’s spiesand collect intelligence on Axis activities to help win the war. Over the nextseven years, the FBI sent more than 340 agents and support professionalsundercover into Central and South America as part of the Special IntelligenceService…. The service was gathering information and sending it back to FBIHeadquarters in Washington, where it was crafted into useful intelligence forthe military and others.[335] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn335]Figure 60. \"The FBI and Foreign Intelligence\". Source: CIA Website[../images/00061.jpeg]While William Tompkins was involved in a covert Naval Intelligence program aimedat Nazi Germany, one of the things that the Navy spies reported was that theNazis had poured personnel and resources into South America. The Nazis weresetting up a major staging post for building their secret space program inAntarctica just prior to and during World War II. As the war came to an end,Nazi Germany increased the flow of personnel and equipment into South Americaand Antarctica. FOIA documents confirm that the FBI was monitoring Nazioperations in South America during this entire period and was aware that keyNazi leaders, such as Adolf Hitler and Martin Bormann, had been allowed toescape to Argentina.[336] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn336] Hoover was awarethat Allen Dulles, from the Bern, Switzerland Headquarters of the Office ofStrategic Services (a forerunner to the CIA), had negotiated secret deals withNazi SS officials towards the end of the war, which had been approved byPresidents Roosevelt and Truman.Importantly, during this entire period, the FBI was primarily responsible forintelligence operations in South America, and directly investigated what theNazi’s were up to. This meant that the Navy and FBI, up to 1946, were poolingtheir intelligence resources to understand the extent of Nazi operations inSouth America/Antarctica; to determine how far Nazi flying saucer technologieshad developed, and in response, develop a coordinated strategy for opposing theNazi threat in the Western Hemisphere.Hoover was staunchly opposed to the creation of the Central Intelligence Group,and its successor the CIA, which was established in September 1947. He refusedto share documents and resources with the CIA. This is exemplified in adeclassified CIA document showing that the FBI withdrew its field agents andresources from Latin America in August 1946, before Central Intelligence Groupagents could be deployed.[337] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn337] Multipleresearchers have confirmed the subsequent quarter century-long animosity Hooverhad towards the CIA, which lasted up to his death in 1972. According tohistorian, Mark Riebling: “there have been no fewer than twelve White Houseinitiatives to defuse the interagency conflict. All have failed …”[338][part0000_split_046.html#_edn338]Many researchers assume that the FBI-CIA conflict was due to Hoover losing thebureaucratic turf war over the FBI playing a role in foreign intelligenceoperations, or the intrinsic challenge in harmonizing intelligence operationswith law enforcement.[339] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn339] Was the real reasonbehind Hoover’s animosity caused by his fear of the threat he knew the CIAposed, due to their efforts in establishing a close working relationship withAntarctica-based Nazis and their Reptilian allies? This became clearer as Dullescontinued to conduct secret negotiations between different US administrationsand Nazi leaders in South America and Antarctica, and rise through the CIA ranksto become its first civilian Director in 1953.A close relationship was developed between the USAF, the RAND Corporation andthe Nazi/Reptilian alliance after an agreement had been reached with theEisenhower administration in early 1955. This USAF/RAND/Reptilian Alliance wasopposed to the Navy, and the Nordic extraterrestrials covertly working as alliesthrough third parties such as the Douglas Aircraft Company, which Tompkins hasdescribed at length. Hoover saw that the CIA had been infiltrated by theNazi/Reptilian Alliance, and had become an integral part of what can bedescribed as a USAF/CIA/Nazi/Reptilian Alliance. In contrast, Hoover’s FBI wouldquietly assist the Navy in its covert relationship with Nordic extraterrestrialsin developing future space battle groups, to prevent infiltration and sabotageby the USAF/CIA/Nazi/Reptilian Alliance.Hoover remained FBI Director up to his death in 1972. His knowledge about flyingsaucers, a Nazi Space Program in Antarctica/South America, the USAF/CIA/Nazi/Reptilian alliance, and the historic cooperation between the Office ofNaval Intelligence and Nordic extraterrestrials, has become part of theinstitutional memory of the FBI. Once again, a television show, The X-Files,would become a form of “soft disclosure,” opening a small window into thehistorical FBI association with the flying saucer phenomenon and theNazi/extraterrestrial element.Given the FBI’s institutional memory about flying saucers, secret spaceprograms, and history of covert cooperation with Naval Intelligence, the FBI’sactions during the 2016 Presidential election raises an intriguing possibility.Did the FBI overtly assist Trump because he is seen as someone predisposed topublicly disclosing the truth about these controversial subjects, of poignantconcern to both the FBI and the Navy?Undoubtedly, the most surprising event preceding the election was an October 28letter by FBI Director Comey stating that Clinton was once again under federalinvestigation.[340] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn340] The FBI had learned from a“sexting” investigation of disgraced congressman, Anthony Weiner, that one ofhis computers was shared with his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, deputy chair ofthe Clinton campaign. It contained emails between Abedin, Clinton and otherssent during her tenure as Secretary of State. This was relevant to the FBIinvestigation of Clinton, which had been closed earlier in July 2016 when Comeyrecommended that no charges should be brought against Clinton.[341][part0000_split_046.html#_edn341] Comey’s letter to the heads of differentCongressional Committees, informing them of the re-opening, rocked the Clintoncampaign and led to 11 days of the worst press experienced by Clinton during theentire campaign. Then, on November 6, only two days before the election, Comeyonce again called off the investigation and lifted a cloud of uncertainty overthe Clinton campaign.[342] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn342] Her supportersexpressed a huge sigh of relief, and believed the road to the White House waswide open once again.Most political pundits and media organizations were bewildered by Comey’spuzzling behavior. Why did he say anything in the first place if there wasnothing sufficiently incriminating in the Weiner/Abedin emails to change theearlier July decision to close the investigation? Clinton supporters were angryat Comey, and believed he had blatantly interfered in the election to help theTrump campaign.[343] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn343] Republicans, includingTrump himself, criticized Comey for once again protecting Clinton prior to theelection.[344] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn344]After her election loss, Clinton told donors in a conference call that Comey’sactions had indeed done her campaign irreparable harm and directly assistedTrump. She was quoted to have said that Comey’s first letter on October 28 hadbadly affected her campaign’s momentum:There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful …ouranalysis is that Comey’s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless,proven to be, stopped our momentum.” [345] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn345]According to Clinton, Comey’s second letter on November 6 was even moredamaging:Mrs. Clinton said a second letter from Mr. Comey, clearing her once again, whichcame two days before Election Day, had been even more damaging. In that letter,Mr. Comey said an examination of a new trove of emails, which had been found onthe computer of Anthony D. Weiner … had not caused him to change his earlierconclusion that Mrs. Clinton should face no charges over her handling ofclassified information. Her campaign said the seemingly positive outcome hadonly hurt it with voters who did not trust Mrs. Clinton and were receptive toMr. Trump’s claims of a “rigged system.”[346] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn346]Clinton’s analysis correctly identifies the damage done to her campaign byComey’s 11th hour intervention. The retiring Democratic leader in the Senate,Harry Reid, went further to claim that Comey was actually a Republican Partyoperative: “there is no question in my mind she would have won this electionwithout any problem if Comey had not been the Republican operative that he is.\"[347] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn347] Clinton and Reid’s assessment raises twoquestions. Was Comey’s intervention an intentional act designed to help Trump’scampaign? Also, was Comey’s intervention done in concert with other powerfulinstitutional actors covertly helping the Trump campaign?As mentioned earlier, Goode maintained that the “Earth Alliance” had backedTrump and was behind the Wikileaks email releases damaging to the Clintoncampaign. The Earth Alliance allegedly includes senior figures in both the Navyand FBI, and also the Russian Federation. The possibility that Russia and theFBI were actively colluding in undermining the Clinton campaign was raised byDemocratic critics of Comey’s actions. This included the former Chair of theNational Democratic Committee, Howard Dean, who tweeted: “Comey put himself onthe same side as Putin.” [348] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn348]Significantly, Corey Goode said that his sources had confirmed that the FBI wasindeed working with Russia, behind the scenes. Commenting on this relationshipin regard to Comey’s intervention that effectively sabotaged the Clintoncampaign, Goode stated, “This has led to surprising public declarations ofcollusion between Russia and the FBI—something that we have been revealing foryears now as a key aspect of the Alliance.”[349][part0000_split_046.html#_edn349] If accurate, this is an extraordinaryrevelation. The FBI actively colluded with both domestic and internationalactors to help elect Donald Trump to the US Presidency! To understand why, weneed to examine the emerging relationship between Trump and President Putin, andwhat this potentially means for world peace, and “official disclosure” of secretspace programs and extraterrestrial life. "},{"pageContent":"RUSSIA’S ROLE IN DISCLOSURE & THE EMERGING TRUMP-PUTIN RELATIONSHIP In the previous chapter, the Clinton campaign was shown to be connected to a“limited disclosure” initiative. This involved framing the Russian Federation asa long term strategic enemy, when it came to a secret space program run by theAir Force. If Clinton had won the election, many political analysts expectedincreased tensions with Russia, which could have easily escalated into a nuclearwar.[350] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn350] Provokingly, after Russia’sannexation of Crimea, Clinton referred to Putin as another Hitler, therebysetting the scene for World War III.[351] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn351] Incontrast, Trump promised a new approach to Russia where there would becooperation in mutual areas of interest.This leads to the question of whether President Trump will consider fulldisclosure of multiple secret space programs and extraterrestrial life a mutualarea of interest with Russia? There is good reason to believe that a Trumpadministration will partner with Russia in an “official disclosure” initiativethat will forever change life on our planet.First, let us consider what Trump had to say about Russia both prior to andduring his Presidential campaign. In a 2007 interview on Larry King Live on CNN,Trump expressed his admiration for Vladimir Putin’s leadership in Russia: Look at Putin -- what he's doing with Russia -- I mean, you know, what's goingon over there. I mean this guy has done -- whether you like him or don't likehim -- he's doing a great job in rebuilding the image of Russia and alsorebuilding Russia period.[352] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn352] The most significant remark made by Trump during the 2016 Presidential campaigncame in response to a comment by Putin on ABC News:[Trump is] a very colorful person. Talent, with[out] any doubt. But it’s not ouraffair to determine his worthiness - that’s up to the United States, but he isabsolutely the leader in the presidential race. He wants to move to a differentlevel of relations, to more solid, deeper relations with Russia and how canRussia not welcome that – we welcome that.”[353][part0000_split_046.html#_edn353]Afterwards, Trump made a statement to ABC News where he again articulated hisadmiration of Putin, and expressed some of his future hopes concerning Russia: It is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highlyrespected within his own country and beyond. I have always felt that Russia andthe United States should be able to work well with each other towards defeatingterrorism and restoring world peace, not to mention trade and all of the otherbenefits derived from mutual respect.[354] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn354] Trump’s reference to working with Russia in “defeating terrorism and restoringworld peace” on a basis of “mutual respect” is noteworthy. It is a welcomedeparture from the tension and antagonism that existed at the time due to eventsin Ukraine, which led to the US and European Union imposing sanctions on Russia,and in turn being hit by Russian counter-sanctions.A week after Trump’s Presidential victory, Trump and Putin spoke by telephoneand agreed that relations between the US and Russia were “extremelyunsatisfactory,” as described in a Kremlin report:During the call, the two leaders discussed a range of issues including thethreats and challenges facing the United States and Russia, strategic economicissues and the historical U.S.-Russia relationship that dates back over 200years,” it said.In its readout, the Kremlin added that both Putin and Trump agreed that theU.S.-Russian ties are in “extremely unsatisfactory” condition now. “They spokefor active joint work to normalize ties and engage in constructive cooperationon a broad range of issues,” it said, adding that Putin and Trump emphasized theneed to develop trade and economic cooperation to give a strong basis toU.S.-Russia relations. Putin and Trump also agreed on the need to combineefforts in the fight against their No. 1 enemy – “international terrorism andextremism”.[355] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn355]A genuine relationship of mutual respect between Trump and Putin could lead tolevels of cooperation between the US and Russia, not seen since the days ofRonald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev during the 1980’s. The Reagan-Gorbachevrelationship led to the end of the Cold War super power confrontation, andushered in a period of unprecedented cooperation between the US and SovietUnion/Russia in global affairs.A Trump-Putin relationship is likely to be just as significant, if not more so,than the Reagan-Gorbachev relationship in influencing global affairs. Reagan andGorbachev ended the Cold War, which pitted two ideologically opposed globalsystems against one another—Marxism Leninism and Pluralist Democracies. Trumpand Putin will soon be in a position to end another ideological divide betweentwo global systems. This involves openly sharing the benefits of highly advancedtechnologies secretly developed by a transnational military-industrial complexfor the exclusive benefit of global elites and national security programs.On the one hand, there is a global system comprising highly classified “closedsource” advanced technology projects, involving deep space operations usingexotic propulsion systems such as antigravity, which routinely interacts withvisiting extraterrestrial life. Both the Navy and Air Force have built secretspace programs using these exotic technologies, and use incredibly advancedmedical technologies such as age-regression, and holographic healing that canrestore limbs and organs.On the other hand, there is a global system which is “open source” and far lesstechnologically advanced, where antigravity propulsion is considered by “opensource” scientists to be a myth, extraterrestrial life is officially yet to bediscovered, and age-regression technologies are deemed decades away indevelopment to be applicable to humans.[356] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn356]This is the world known to the vast majority of our planet’s population of overseven billion. The movie Elysium represents the “soft disclosure” of thetechnological gulf between two portions of humanity, and shows that this dividewas allowed to grow over more than six decades because a classified research anddevelopment system was maintained. This is our own technological apartheid on aglobal scale.There is good reason to believe that Putin is the most comprehensively briefedinternational leader when it comes to the history, development and operations ofthe shadow world of advanced technology programs. He has been either Presidentor Prime Minister of Russia since August 1999. Prior to that, he briefly headedRussia’s Federal Security Service, successor to the KGB, under the Boris YeltsinPresidency from July 1998 to March 1999, and subsequently headed Yeltsin’sSecurity Council (equivalent to the US National Security Council) beforebecoming Prime Minister for the first time. He replaced Yeltsin as President onMay 7, 2000.Confirmation that Putin, while President of Russia, was given briefings aboutextraterrestrial life comes from no less than a former Russian President, andcurrent Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev. In a hot microphone incident inDecember 2012, Medvedev was recorded as saying in response to a question:Along with the briefcase with nuclear codes, the president of the country isgiven a special 'top secret' folder. This folder in its entirety containsinformation about aliens who visited our planet. Along with this, you are givena report of the absolutely secret special service that exercises control overaliens on the territory of our country ... More detailed information on thistopic you can get from a well-known movie called 'Men In Black' ... I will nottell you how many of them are among us because it may cause panic.[357][part0000_split_046.html#_edn357]While many in the mass media assumed Medvedev was joking, the context of theconversation and expert analysis of his body language confirms that he was beingvery serious.[358] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn358] His comments help confirmthat Russian Presidents receive classified briefing documents aboutextraterrestrials living among us, and the existence of a covert program set upto monitor aliens in Russia and elsewhere.Confirmation that Putin is a key global leader when it comes to the operationsof secret space programs comes from Goode. He says that Putin has been involvedin secret meetings and negotiations, conducted by different secret spaceprograms and extraterrestrial alliances, over the “extent and pace” in whichfull disclosure should occur. Goode gives the example of Putin’s unexplained tenday disappearance, from March 6 to 16, 2015, as a probable case of him and/orhis representatives attending a secret space program meeting held at a secretMoon base (Lunar Operations Command – LOC) to conduct disclosure negotiations:The timing of his 10 day disappearance occurred exactly during the time of theSSP Alliance/Sphere Alliance Conference that was taking place on the LOC alongwith many Earth Politicians (Non Cabal) and Regular Earth Citizens. I did notpersonally see him or have I been briefed that he was there. I was not involvedin that portion of the conference. I do strongly suspect that he or hisrepresentatives were present.[359] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn359]What is even more intriguing is growing evidence that Russia is activelycooperating with the same Nordic extraterrestrials that Tompkins claims havebeen covertly assisting the US Navy since at least the 1950’s!This is a view that Dr. Preston James, a regular writer for the popular website,Veteran’s Today, says he was also told independently by his own insider sources.James refers to a Russian agreement with a positive group of extraterrestrials(Nordics) opposed to the Draconian extraterrestrials, and what he describes asthe latter’s “Rothschild Khazarian Mafia” (RKM)/Cabal partners:Sources deep within Russia have reported that the Russian Federation has signeda treaty with a certain Alien ET group, and this particular Alien ET group has along conflict with the a certain group that has allegedly been “advising andrunning” the top RKM Policy-makers who have served as their agent for takingover the whole world.[360] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn360]James goes on to say that the Russians have been given advanced weaponstechnologies by the positive extraterrestrial group, which can neutralize thebest technologies available to the CIA/Mossad/Saudi equipped Islamic Stategroups, who are backed by the Cabal/RKM:At this time it is unknown what their long term agenda is, but so far they haveequipped the Russian Federation with some astoundingly powerful weapons,especially ultra-high tech electronics which can temporarily shut off theelectrical systems of whole ships or carriers and even aircraft and all group,air and satellite radar systems. Putin has allegedly been told that he should goahead and checkmate the RKM and its Terrorists cutouts in Syria and Iran and notworry, because this Alien ET group now has his back.[361][part0000_split_046.html#_edn361]James refers to an incident involving the U.S.S. Donald Cook naval vessel as anexample of these advanced extraterrestrial technologies being successfullydeveloped and deployed by the Russian military:Some of Putin’s secret space war weapons are shocking in their actualcapabilities. One was tested on an America ship, the USS Donald Cook, last April2014. As two Russian fighters flew over, the ship’s electric supply wasdisrupted, shutting down all radar and Aegis defense systems. It was reportedthat the top officers were so upset that some of them resigned their commissionsand left the Navy, feeling they could not even defend their own ships and crewsanymore against such ultra high-tech weapons. [362][part0000_split_046.html#_edn362]James information dovetails with Goode’s testimony about Putin’s connection toan “Earth Based Alliance” associated with the BRICS nations, which is dedicatedto overturning the plans of the Cabal/RKM. Goode describes Putin’s role asfollows:Putin and other elements of the “Earth Based Alliance” that make up the BRICSAlliance among others that dove tail together are all working for the commongoal of defeating the “Satanic/Luciferian Cabal” that is now in control of themajority of the world and responsible for not only amazing deceptions of his andother countries populations but also some of the most horrific Crimes AgainstHumanity that have ever taken place in known history. There are many of thesecrimes that have become more and more known through recent disclosures behindthe scenes. This has only caused these groups and people to want to bring downthese Secret Earth Government Syndicates now more than ever.[363][part0000_split_046.html#_edn363]Regarding the Donald Cook incident, Goode replied to the following emailquestion I sent him:[Salla] On April 12, 2014, the USS Donald Cook equipped with an Aegis CombatSystem was allegedly disabled by a Russian Su-24 tactical bomber deploying asophisticated electronic jamming system. Was this an example of the kind oftechnological assistance given to Solar Warden and its earth allies to changethe military/political balance of power on Earth?[Goode] I have been told this is the case by several SSP Alliance members, but Ihave not seen any briefing reports personally to be able to vouch for that 100%myself. Other insiders have reported this as well so it is probably a safespeculation.[364] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn364]Yet more evidence of an alliance between the Russian Federation andextraterrestrials emerged in an extraordinary television interview, held in May2010, with the retiring Governor of the Russian Republic of Kalmykia, KirsanIlyumzhinov, who had been President of the World Chess Federation since 1995. Heclaimed that in 1997, he was taken from his penthouse apartment and brought onboard an extraterrestrial vehicle. Ilyumzhinov stated that the extraterrestrialshe met were humanoid and gave him a tour of their ship. According toIlyumzhinov, his experience was backed by three witnesses, who had searched forhim at his home after he had boarded the alien spaceship.[365][part0000_split_046.html#_edn365]An enormously telling fact is that Ilyumzhinov appeared on Russia’s no.1 ratedtelevision station, Channel One, which is 51% controlled by the Russiangovernment, to openly discuss the incident. The interviewer, Vladimir Pozner,began the segment with questions about Ilyumzhinov’s experience. Clearly, thehost and producers knew in advance of what had happened to Ilyumzhinov, andwished to discuss it on air. Also extraordinary, there was no censorship ofIlyumzhinov’s experience, which was immediately made available on the ChannelOne website.[366] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn366] This airing of Ilyumzhinov’sexperience signaled a remarkable covert attempt by the Russian government toprepare its citizens for the eventual public disclosure of extraterrestrial lifeinteracting with high level political officials.In the interview, Ilyumzhinov described how he was awakened from his sleep, andexited his apartment through a balcony onto the waiting ship. He said:In the evening I read a book, watched TV, and went to rest. And then, probably,fell asleep, and felt that the balcony opened and someone called. He came up, Ilooked – a kind of translucent half-pipe. I went into this tube and saw peoplein yellow spacesuits.[367] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn367]Ilyumzhinov went on to describe how the extraterrestrials took him on a tour oftheir vehicle. Then they explained that they needed samples from another planetand took him with them before returning him safely to his apartment. Before theinterview was over, Ilyumzhinov shared his conclusions about thecharacteristics, behavior and goals of the extraterrestrials: “They are peoplelike us. They have the same mind, the same vision. I talked with them. Iunderstand we are not alone in this whole world. We are not unique.”[368][part0000_split_046.html#_edn368]The way Ilyumzhinov was able to publicly share his experience on a Governmentcontrolled television station without any censorship demonstrates the tacitapproval of senior Russian officials, especially Putin, who was Prime Ministerat the time. Ilyumzhinov’s status as both a Governor and President of theprestigious World Chess Federation ensured that his testimony would getsignificant public attention both in Russia and beyond.[369][part0000_split_046.html#_edn369] At the very least, Russia was displaying whatwould seem to be an extraordinary degree of public openness on UFOs and alienlife, by allowing an elected official to share his experience in this manner.Perhaps most significantly, the interview suggests that Russia was alreadytaking serious steps with its citizenry towards official disclosure of theexistence of advanced extraterrestrial life, and the high level meetings takingplace between them and Russian officials.What the above evidence suggests is that Russia’s President Putin is not onlyaware of extraterrestrial life, but has formally entered into an agreement withthe Nordics. This places Russia, the US Navy and the FBI in the same strategicalliance with Nordic extraterrestrials. In contrast, the USAF, CIA and much ofthe US military industrial complex is on the other side of the strategic ledger,due to secret agreements and active cooperation with the Nazi ReptilianAlliance.Given the Navy/Solar Warden and FBI support for President Trump, it is verylikely that he will eventually be informed of these different extraterrestrialgroups and their multi-faceted alliances. This will subsequently lead to thedevelopment of a partnership with President Putin for an “official disclosure”that goes well beyond the “limited disclosure” initiatives, like the one fromDeLonge, his advisors, and the US Air Force. Consequently, the relationshipsTrump develops with the Navy, FBI and Russia, can lay the foundations for “fulldisclosure” of Secret Space Programs and extraterrestrial life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12FULL DISCLOSURE & ANNOUNCING THE ANTARCTICA DISCOVERIES What has been established by the evidence presented in this book so far is thatthe Navy began work on studying, designing and developing a secret space programas a result of an intelligence gathering operation that began in Nazi Germanyduring World War II. According to William Tompkins, a direct participant in thissurveillance operation, the Navy was successful in ultimately building its SolarWarden program, largely due to the assistance of human-looking “Nordic”extraterrestrials. This assistance occurred covertly through both infiltrationinto select aerospace corporations by the Nordics, and telepathic communicationswith “preferred human contactees,” such as Tompkins, who would receive thenecessary technical information for the Navy to succeed in designing andbuilding space battle groups capable of interstellar operations. The Nordic extraterrestrials, Tompkins states, anticipated that the Navy wouldeventually become a counter weight to an earlier secret space program developedby Nazi Germany in collaboration with Reptilian extraterrestrials, which hasbeen referred to as the “Dark Fleet.” Secret agreements that began in 1955between the Eisenhower administration and succeeding Presidentialadministrations with the Nazi/Reptilian alliance led to the rapid expansion ofthe Dark Fleet, per Goode’s testimony, along with the establishment of yetanother space program established by a consortium of corporations, called theInterplanetary Corporate Conglomerate.Then other major spacefaring nations began to participate in spin-off secretspace programs established under the control of the United Nations, and/or undernational control, as with the Russian Federation. In the case of Russia, itsprogram also appears to be receiving covert assistance from Nordic and perhapsother friendly extraterrestrial civilizations.The bewildering assortment of secret space programs and the extraterrestrialsalliances that are associated with them is tremendously complex, and unknown notonly to the general public, but to most senior political and military officialsin all nations.[370] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn370] The situation began tochange significantly with the “full disclosure” provided by Tompkins and Goode,which has been sanctioned by senior officials within the US Navy and SecretSpace Program Alliance. While compartmentalization and “need to know” accessrestrict which political leaders and military officials are briefed on theseprograms, shifting geo-political conditions and alliances can significantlyimpact this briefing process.With the 2016 election of President Trump, a rare realignment of geopoliticalforces promises to significantly impact the prospects for an officially approvedprocess of “full disclosure” of these secret space programs, and theextraterrestrial alliances that undergird them. A key question then becomes whatare the prospects that President Trump will be briefed regarding these programs,and subsequently enter into a partnership with President Putin of Russia for“full disclosure.” It is this intriguing possibility that can lead ussignificantly beyond the “limited disclosure” that DeLonge’s cooperation withthe USAF is sanctioned to impart through his Sekret Machines initiative. "},{"pageContent":"WILL PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BE BRIEFED ABOUT SOLAR WARDEN & EXTRATERRESTRIALLIFE? In contrast to Russian Presidents being briefed about, and participating insecretive negotiations over extraterrestrial life and highly classifiedtechnology programs, many US Presidents since the Eisenhower Administration areroutinely kept out of the loop. For example, documents and whistleblowertestimonies reveal that President John F. Kennedy was denied access toclassified files dealing with advanced technology programs and extraterrestriallife by the secretive MJ-12 Group. In my 2013 book, Kennedy’s Last Stand, Ipresent documents that show how Kennedy’s attempts to gain access and control ofclassified UFO files were a direct factor in his assassination.[371][part0000_split_046.html#_edn371]Another example of US Presidents being kept out of the loop involves PresidentBill Clinton, who just before beginning his first term on January 20, 1993, madethe following request to close family friend and lawyer, Webster Hubbell: “If Iput you over there in Justice I want you to find the answer to two questions forme: One, who killed JFK. And two, are there UFOs.”[372][part0000_split_046.html#_edn372] According to Hubbell, “Clinton was deadserious.”[373] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn373] Hubbell’s revelations tells usthat Clinton believed his national security advisors were giving him the runaround on the UFO and JFK assassination topics, and that finding answersrequired putting his own people into key positions.[374][part0000_split_046.html#_edn374]Clinton assigned Hubbell to the Department of Justice on the first day of thenew Presidential administration. We know that Clinton wanted to appoint Hubbleto the top job there as Attorney General, but finally had to settle forAssociate Attorney General. Yet, as the third highest ranking official in theDepartment of Justice, Hubble enjoyed impressive executive powers and securityclearances to find answers to Clinton’s questions. He nevertheless failed tofind the requested answers. Hubbell would eventually write about Clinton’srequest and efforts to find answers in his memoirs, Friends in High Places.[375][part0000_split_046.html#_edn375]The lesson here is that US Presidents, especially those from the DemocraticParty, are routinely excluded from learning all there is to know about theparallel world of classified “closed source” programs.[376][part0000_split_046.html#_edn376] There are examples, however, of US Presidentsbeing given partial briefings, which are designed to produce a particularoutcome, as exemplified in the case of President Reagan being briefed about“evil aliens.”According to an alleged 1981 briefing document, Reagan was told that there werefive groups of aliens visiting Earth, one of whom were extremely hostile.[377][part0000_split_046.html#_edn377] While there is much controversy over thelegitimacy of the 1981 Reagan briefing document,[378][part0000_split_046.html#_edn378] subsequent public comments by Reagan warningabout an alien threat and the need for international cooperation suggest it iseither substantially accurate, or he received a very similar national securitybriefing in his administration.[379] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn379] What we do know for certain is that Reagan brought up the alien threat scenariowith the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, on several occasions,and that he requested joint US-USSR action in dealing with the problem.[380][part0000_split_046.html#_edn380] Gorbachev later recounted the discussion fromtheir first meeting in Geneva, Switzerland in December 1985: At our meeting in Geneva, the U.S. President said that if the earth faced aninvasion by extraterrestrials, the United States and the Soviet Union would joinforces to repel such an invasion. I shall not dispute the hypothesis, though Ithink it's early yet to worry about such an intrusion... [381][part0000_split_046.html#_edn381] At their Geneva summit, Reagan and Gorbachev began a close relationship that ledto a number of stunning international developments. This included their 1987signing of the “Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty,” resulting in theremoval and destruction of short range and intermediate nuclear missiles fromboth sides.[382] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn382] Historians attribute theclose relationship between Reagan and Gorbachev as the indispensable ingredientfor the process that led to the ending of the Cold War. [383][part0000_split_046.html#_edn383]The result of Reagan and Gorbachev’s private discussions about cooperating on anextraterrestrial threat was the creation of an alleged United Nations SecretSpace Program. According to Goode, this program is called the “Global GalacticLeague of Nations” and operates in interstellar space, with at least one base inan adjoining star system.[384] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn384] The end of theCold War can be directly attributed to the creation of this United Nations spaceprogram, which incorporated all major space faring nations in the world.[385][part0000_split_046.html#_edn385]It is certain that President Trump, like Reagan, will receive a classifiedbriefing of some kind about extraterrestrial life and secret space programs. Theonly real question is “to what extent will Trump be briefed on such programs?”Alternatively, has he already been briefed at least informally about theirexistence, as hinted at in his inaugural speech? "},{"pageContent":"TRUMP INAUGURATION SPEECH HINTS AT OFFICIAL DISCLOSURE In his January 20, 2017 inauguration speech challenging the vested intereststhat control political life in Washington D.C., President Trump spoke of afuture where humanity will have full access to the kind of advanced technologiesused in the secret space programs. He appeared to be hinting at the benefitsofficial disclosure of these programs would bring to the US and the world, andthat he was going to challenge the vested interests hiding these.Back in December 2016, Trump told presidential historian Douglas Brinkley thathe planned to write a short speech himself.[386][part0000_split_046.html#_edn386] Later, Trump tweeted a picture of himselfworking on his speech alone, thereby indicating that its content would be hisown creation.[387] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn387] It is highly likely thatTrump’s speech writers would have made suggestions, polished his words, andadded a few rhetorical flourishes to accentuate whatever points he wanted tomake, even throughout the various drafts, leading to the final product.Nevertheless, the contents of his Inauguration Speech reveal much of what Trumpreally thinks about the future and hopes to achieve during his presidency.Early in his speech, Trump was clear that Washington politics only benefited asmall wealthy elite, rather than the entire population: For too long, a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards ofgovernment while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but thepeople did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left andthe factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizensof our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphshave not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation’s capital,there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.[388][part0000_split_046.html#_edn388] Trump affirmed his campaign pledge to revitalize the American manufacturingindustry, thus bringing high paying jobs back. He stated his opposition to FreeTrade deals which have led to many US corporations taking their manufacturingplants out of the US, only to ship their cheaply made foreign products back at ahuge profit, which goes to a small group benefited by powerful Washington DClobbyists: One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thoughtabout the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. Thewealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and thenredistributed all across the world. [389] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn389] Towards the end of his speech, Trump articulated one sentence that contained hismost developed vision of the future for America and its citizenry: We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries ofspace, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness theenergies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.[390][part0000_split_046.html#_edn390] Trump’s use of the phrase “unlock the mysteries of space” may be just arhetorical flourish to show his determination to rejuvenate the NASA spaceprogram and to assist the growing commercial space industry. Alternatively, itis a hint that he is aware that there is much more happening in space than whatthe public has been informed about.His use of the word “unlock” infers that these mysteries are kept hidden inhighly classified programs, and he now holds the keys to them. In that sense, heis sending the message that as the President and Commander in Chief, he holdsall the keys and intends to use them to further his vision of the future. Onceagain, he was signaling his intent of confronting the “small group” hidden inWashington that benefit from keeping secrets from the public.The next phrase used by Trump, “to free the earth from the miseries of disease”raises the possibility that he is aware of the advanced healing technologiessecretly developed in classified programs. Witnesses and whistleblowers havedescribed advanced healing technologies used in secret space programs that canregenerate limbs and organs, and cure any disease. William Tompkins, who workedat the TRW Corporation from 1967 to 1971, says this company has developed “lifeextension” pharmaceutical products that could cure any disease, and physicallyage-regress people.[391] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn391]Trump lastly added that he planned “to harness the energies, industries andtechnologies of tomorrow.” Again, was this a rhetorical embellishment added by aspeech writer, or was he hinting at advanced technologies used in secret spaceprograms? In discussing the “technologies of tomorrow,” Trump was clearlyreferring to more than just bringing back conventional manufacturing industriesto generate new jobs. If some of the advanced technologies used in secret spaceprograms, such as antigravity and free energy were released, then this wouldrevolutionize the automobile, aviation and energy industries. Tens of millionsof jobs would be created in the US alone.Trump has promised to move quickly in achieving his campaign goals, and thevision outlined in his inauguration speech. I have learned from Corey Goode thatTrump has already been informally briefed about Goode’s own extensive secretspace program disclosures.[392] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn392] Privately,Trump has learned about the advanced space technologies that have been keptsecret from the American public, and the “small group” that benefits from thisclosed system. As the newly installed Commander in Chief, Trump now holds thekeys to unlocking these secrets, and ushering in a “new millennium” through anofficial full disclosure process. Strategically, the information that launchesthis process, in terms of public perception, will help define it. Therefore, theTrump disclosure process is likely to begin with some startling announcementsabout a major archeological discovery in Antarctica. "},{"pageContent":"TRUMP & THE IMPENDING ANTARCTICA DISCOVERY ANNOUNCEMENT In a December 11, 2016 update posted on his website, Corey Goode states that helearned of excavations taking place in Antarctica from multiple insider sources.Later on, the excavations were brought up to him by a senior officer (aka“Sigmund”) within a USAF led secret space program, who has led a covert missioninvolving multiple abductions and debriefings of Goode.[393][part0000_split_046.html#_edn393] During one of these abductions/interrogations,Sigmund unexpectedly shared some of his knowledge about the Antarcticaexcavations. This information included him describing a civilization found inthe ruins led by a 12-14 foot tall “Pre-Adamite” race with an elongated skull: He [Sigmund] stated that an extremely ancient series of cities had beendiscovered flash frozen deep under the ice-shelf. He confirmed that there werealso many animals and “pre-Adamites” preserved in the ice…. They were allflattened/ crushed or knocked over by the event that flash froze the area. Theyhave tons of trees/ plants and wildlife frozen in place, like they were put onpause. He described the Pre-Adamites as beings with elongated skulls, withstrangely proportioned bodies that were obviously not designed for Earth’sgravity and atmospheric pressure.[394] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn394] While the discovery of the ruins date back to the first Nazi German expeditionin 1939, according to Goode’s sources, it is only since 2002 that excavations byarcheologists and other scientists have been allowed. Significantly, where theexcavations have secretly been taking place is under 2000 feet of ice below theRoss Ice Shelf. The Antarctica ruins are well hidden from any possible aerial orsatellite surveillance, thus enabling the secret to be kept this long. Thearcheologists have allegedly prepared documentary films and academic papers,whose release will one day soon astound the scientific community.Goode describes that three oval shaped motherships, about 30 miles in diameter,were discovered near the site revealing that the Pre-Adamites wereextraterrestrial in origin, and it was determined that they had arrived on Earthabout 55,000 years ago. One of the three ships has been excavated and found tohave many smaller spacecraft inside. The Pre-Adamite civilization, at least thatportion of it based in Antarctica, had been flash frozen in a cataclysmic eventthat occurred roughly 12,000 years ago.Goode was also told by his contacts that the most advanced technologies, and theremains of Pre-Adamites themselves, have been removed from one archeologicalsite that will be made public. Teams of archeologists have been working withwhat is left, and have been told to keep all else they have seen secret. Figure 61. Elongated Skull Discovery in Bolivia[../images/00062.jpeg] In addition, Goode’s insider sources report that select ancient artifactsacquired from other locations will be brought in from vast warehouses, andseeded across the archeological site being prepared for public release. In theimpending announcement about the Antarctica excavations, emphasis will be placedupon the “terrestrial elements” of the flash frozen civilization, in order notto overly shock the general population. According to Goode, the announcement islikely to be timed for distraction away from upcoming crimes against humanitytrials against global elite members, because leaks and investigations willcontinue to emerge about international pedophile rings and child trafficking.Up until the end of 2016, everything Goode knew about the Antarctica excavationswas told to him, either by insider sources or by his very captor during anabduction. That changed in early January 2017, when Goode was taken toAntarctica to witness for himself the ruins and the excavations underway. Laterthat month, on January 24, I met with Goode and received an informal briefingregarding his eyewitness experience.Goode says that shortly after New Year’s Day, he was taken to Antarctica aboardan “Anshar” spacecraft. The Anshar are one of seven “Inner Earth” civilizationsthat Goode claims he has met with on numerous occasions. In one of his earlierreports, Goode gave the details of his experience of being taken to the mainunderground city belonging to the Anshar, where he witnessed their advancedtechnologies. He has also previously reported another experience with theAnshar, in which he was taken by them to Antarctica, where he got to see five ofthe working underground bases belonging to the “Interplanetary CorporateConglomerate.”[395] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn395] This corporate run secretspace program is also based in this icy region.Goode has described in other publicly shared accounts his multiple encounterswith Kaaree, a High Priestess of the Anshar, who has acted as his guide andfriend on many trips into the Earth’s interior, Antarctica and to deep space.Another key figure in Goode’s testimony is “Gonzales,” who is a US NavyLieutenant Commander and Goode’s initial contact with the Secret Space ProgramAlliance, which is comprised of the Navy’s Solar Warden Program, along withdefectors from other secret space programs. After being exposed by Goode duringhis involuntary abductions and interrogations by “Sigmund,” Gonzales became aliaison between a Mayan Secret Space Program and the SSP Alliance, which nolonger requires his presence on Earth.In his early 2017 visit to the Antarctica ruins, Goode says he was accompaniedby Kaaree, Gonzales, and two other Inner Earth Civilization representatives. Oneof the representatives belonged to an Asian-looking race that Goode hasdescribed in a previous account of his initial meeting with representatives fromthe seven Inner Earth civilizations.[396] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn396] Theywere taken by the Anshar spacecraft to an unexcavated portion of the ruins. Thiswas an area that the nearby scientific teams have not yet reached, so it wasstill pristine and showed the full extent of a civilization that had been flashfrozen.Goode described seeing bodies twisted and contorted in various flash frozenstates. The catastrophe had clearly been unanticipated. He said that thePre-Adamites were very thin, and that it was evident from examining their bodiesthat they had evolved on a planet with a much lower gravitational environment. Figure 62. Bodies Found After Excavation of Ancient Pompeii[../images/00063.jpeg]In addition to the pre-Adamites, Goode claims he also saw many different typesof normal sized humans, some of whom had short tails, while others had elongatedskulls similar to the Pre-Adamites. The conclusion Goode drew was that thePre-Adamites were conducting biological experiments on the indigenous humans ofthe planet.Gonzales had an instrument for taking biological samples that he plunged intothe various frozen bodies. He also carried a camera and took many photos. Thebiological material and photos would be given to Secret Space Program Alliancescientists for study. Goode said he was unable to acquire copies of the photosfor public release, at least for the time being. In addition, Goode reportedseeing scrolls of a metallic alloy that were rolled up with some kind of writingupon them. The Anshar and other Inner Earth representatives were collecting asmany of these scrolls as possible. In earlier reports, Goode has described theAnshar Library as being quite extensive and housing many ancient artifacts frommultiple civilizations.[397] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn397] Thus, the Ansharappeared to be adding the historical scroll records of this flash frozencivilization to their library.In addition, Goode said that his party was not seen by the scientists andarcheologists working on excavations in another part of the ruins. The Ansharship had traveled through the ice to get to the ruins, and Goode related how theship could easily move through walls using its advanced technologies.The significance of Goode’s January 2017 trip to Antarctica is that it confirmsearlier briefings he had been given by various sources, including the USAFofficer, Sigmund.[398] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn398] Goode’s visit andconfirmation of the Antarctica discovery is important in another way. It is alsodisturbing substantiation for the research conducted by Sir Charles Hapgood, whohas studied evidence of pole shifts that have led to the Earth’s axis ofrotation shifting dramatically in a short period. As a result, sub-tropicalareas, for example, might suddenly find themselves repositioned at the poles.His 1958 book, Earth’s Shifting Crust, featured a foreword by Albert Einsteinendorsing the rigor of Hapgood’s research.[399][part0000_split_046.html#_edn399] Hapgood summed up his theory as follows:Polar wandering is based on the idea that the outer shell of the earth shiftsabout from time to time, moving some continents toward and other continents awayfrom the poles. Continental drift is based on the idea that the continents moveindividually…A few writers have suggested that perhaps continental drift causespolar wandering. This book advances the notion that polar wandering is primaryand causes the displacement of continents….This book will present evidence thatthe last shift of the earth’s crust (the lithosphere) took place in recent time,at the close of the last ice age, and that it was the cause of the improvementin climate.[400] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn400]Hapgood’s thesis that the last pole shift happened at the end of the last iceage, about 11,000 BC, would be startlingly confirmed by the discovery of a flashfrozen Antarctic civilization. The flash frozen Pre-Adamite civilization is notthe only case of this type of catastrophe that has impacted an ancientcivilization.The visit of many dignitaries to Antarctica in 2016, including then Secretary ofState John Kerry, Apollo Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, Russian Orthodox ChurchPatriarch Kirill, and many other VIP’s in previous years, is circumstantialevidence that a major discovery has been made in Antarctica.[401][part0000_split_046.html#_edn401] Goode’s disclosure provides testimony of thefull extent of the Antarctica discovery, and the scientific excavations underwaysince 2002.More support of Goode’s startling claims comes from internet data mining expert,Cliff High. High describes his research method as the art of predictivelinguistics, which he explains as follows: Predictive Linguistics is the process of using computer software to aggregatevast amounts of written text from the internet by categories delineated byemotional content of the words and using the result to make forecasts based onthe emotional 'tone' changes within the larger population. A form of 'collectivesub-conscious expression' is a good way to think of it. Predictive linguisticscan be used to forecast trends at many different levels, from the detail ofsales to individuals, all the way up to forecasts about emerging globalpopulation trends.[402] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn402] High issues a monthly “Asymmetric Linguistic Trends Analysis IntelligenceReport.” In his January 2017 Report, titled “Sci-fi World,” he had some verysignificant things to say about the global impact of a discovery in Antarctica: The new data sets have 'The (Antarctica) Discovery' providing more than 'newtechnologies' and 'economic boom period'… There is some suggestion from the datathat a 'hoard' or 'trove' of 'knowledge' discovered is going to 'transformhumanity' over these next '4'/four decades (and beyond)'... There are a numberof sets within the Antarctica and The Discovery sets that may be describing a'battle' that is now, and will continue to take place over 'how much', and 'if',and 'when' the 'information' about The Discovery is to be 'released' into thewilds of humanity. However, the data is quite clear that the 'arguing' and'discord' will all be 'wasted time' as it is describing 'individuals' who just'take it upon themselves' to 'awaken humanity' with “The Discovery.”[403][part0000_split_046.html#_edn403] High’s above analysis is very consistent with Goode’s claim that the Antarcticadiscovery is on the verge of being publicly announced, and preparations for thishave been ongoing since 2002. Indeed, Goode’s account of his 2017 Antarcticavisit is an example of High’s reference to ''individuals' who just 'take it uponthemselves' to 'awaken humanity' with ‘The Discovery’.”Given Trump’s desire to revitalize the US manufacturing industry, it can bepredicted with some confidence that he will roll out the Antarctica discoveryduring his administration. This will likely be a prelude to even moredisclosures about advanced technologies involved in the secret space programs.The result will be, in High’s words, an “economic boom period” and the releaseof technologies that will “transform humanity.”Peaceful social conditions are an important requirement for full disclosure tooccur. Likewise, peaceful international conditions are also necessary for fulldisclosure, and close cooperation between Presidents Trump and Putin will go along way in assuring this. This is where Trump’s policies on issues such asUkraine’s civil war, dealing with Iran’s regional power aspirations, and fairertrade relations with China will be critical. Trump’s mismanagement of any ofthese issues can lead to violent international conflict, and set back prospectsof full disclosure.The emerging partnership between Trump, Putin, the US Navy, FBI, and “WhiteHats” in other institutions and nations (which Goode calls the “Earth Alliance”)can create the necessary domestic and international foundations for fulldisclosure to occur. It is also highly significant that the full disclosureprocess is being covertly supported by friendly extraterrestrials, who Tompkinsrefers to as “Nordics” and Goode as the “Sphere Being Alliance.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13THE ROLE OF NORDIC EXTRATERRESTRIALS IN FULL DISCLOSURE While considering all the information presented thus far, it is important tobear in mind that both the documents provided directly by William Tompkins, andthose independently released through the Freedom of Information Act, addsignificant credibility to his remarkable testimony. When combined with theindependent witness reports by retired Navy officers, it can be concluded thatTompkins’ testimony ranks very high in terms of reliability, and may be one ofthe most groundbreaking and informative bodies of disclosure material ever topublicly emerge from one source. What adds another layer of significance to histestimony is the considerable corroboration it lends to the earlier informationrevealed by Corey Goode.It dovetails greatly with Goode’s claim that humanity is being assisted bypositive extraterrestrial groups that want to assist the full disclosureprocess. Yet in reviewing Tompkins’ testimony, it is clear that the assistancehe witnessed being provided by Nordic extraterrestrials was largely technicaland scientific. This runs contrary to what was previously known about thisspecific alien group.Beginning from the early 1950’s, there has been a succession of “contactees”coming forward with incredible stories of Nordic extraterrestrials wanting todisclose their presence to the world. George Adamski, Howard Menger, George VanTassel, Orfeo Angelucci, and Alex Collier are but a few of the many whosetestimonies have inspired millions with their accounts of friendly spacebrothers, here to help humanity spiritually evolve to properly handle thechallenges posed by the acquisition of advanced technologies now used by ourmodern civilization.[404] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn404] The Nordics appearedmost intent about warning humanity of the dangers posed by thermonuclearweapons, which history shows were widely ignored by previous political andmilitary leaders.Yet during this same period, as Tompkins tells it, the Nordics were quietly andsecretly helping the US Navy in the design and construction of its secret spacebattle groups. “Contactees” such as Tompkins were telepathically assisted indeveloping designs and prototypes for advanced aerospace technologies. Thistelepathic communication process was augmented by the Nordics infiltratingcompanies such as Douglas Aircraft, where they could be in close proximity totheir “contactees” as these special individuals worked through the variousproblems that would arise in developing accurate designs and prototypes.Why did the Nordics, if we are indeed talking about the same group ofextraterrestrials, behave in such a contradictory manner? What is the reason forthem warning one group of contactees about the danger of advanced technologiesand promoting the disclosure of their presence through these select individuals,while helping another group develop advanced technologies in a covert mannerwithout any public disclosure being advocated at the time?An answer appears to arise from a broader dilemma confronting humanity, and thestrategic problems this created for the Nordics. They were well aware of theaggressive Reptilian extraterrestrial group, which had imperial designs over thegalaxy, and secretly reached agreements with the Nazis. With vast material helpfrom the Reptilians, the Nazis were able to establish a breakaway civilizationin Antarctica with an advanced space program, and then proceeded to infiltratethe military industrial complex of the US and other industrialized nations—withthe notable exception of Russia.In response to this complex situation, the Nordics appeared to undertake a dualtrack approach. On the one hand, they contacted private citizens and encouragedthem to publicly reveal the existence of extraterrestrial life. On the otherhand, simultaneously, the Nordics strategically identified which elements withinthe US military industrial complex would most likely resist the Nazi/Reptilianinfiltration efforts, and eventually help the US break free of this nefariousinfluence.The Nordics chose the US Navy and individuals like Tompkins, Rear Admiral RicoBotta, and Navy Secretary James Forrestal, who were all “preferred humancontactees” as Tompkins put it. Forrestal was guided by the Nordics to initiatethe Naval intelligence gathering program to discover what the Nazis were doing,and to put Botta in charge. Tompkins asserts that Botta reported directly toForrestal, and thereby bypassed more senior Navy officials in the Bureau ofAeronautics, Office of Naval Intelligence and the Chief of NavalOperations.[405] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn405] This was because Botta, dueto his unconventional engineering background, was more capable of appreciatingthe significance of the incredible information he was receiving, and able toadequately act on the dangers presented by the Reptilian alliance with theNazis.Especially important, according to Tompkins, was that the Nordics were veryaware of Reptilian efforts to sabotage the Navy’s nascent space program. TheNordics were very effective in countering this sabotage with individuals such asTompkins, through whom they provided the necessary technical advice for thesuccess of the Navy’s massive engineering and construction efforts.Tompkins insists that Navy officials were well aware of the covert assistancethey were receiving from the Nordics, and even facilitated it by assigningprominent roles to individuals recognized as “preferred human contactees,” suchas Tompkins. Through Navy League programs, the Nordics continued to work withTompkins to help prepare the next generation of Navy officers, through the SeaCadets, about the reality of extraterrestrial life and the Navy’s secret spaceprogram. Highly noteworthy, Tompkins’ relationship with both the Navy and theNordics continue to the present day.Tompkins describes the Nordics as especially helpful in developing lifeextension technologies for use in the space programs. The Nordics allegedly liveup to two thousand years and first helped scientists in Maria Orsic’s VrilSociety prior to and during the Nazi era, and later the US, in developing lifeextension technologies. Tompkins says that he was involved with classified lifeextension projects during their initial phases, while employed with TRW from1967 to 1971, and this has resulted in significant breakthroughs. This goes wellbeyond their use in the “20 and back” programs described in chapter nine.Tompkins says that pharmaceutical products have recently been developed that canrestore a person, no matter their current physical age, to their late 20’s formales, and early 20’s for females. In addition, brain capacity can be enhancedby a factor of 400%, as he described in this interview: There is a study that we did later on at TRW on advanced life systems – extendedlife. And that program is down now to, within less than two years, it's going tobe available to some people on this planet. The way it works – I'm very involvedwith it – essentially you take four aspirin [pills] over six months, pop them.Or you get four shots. You immediately change… What you do is you revert back to– the girl is 21 and the guy is 29. Now, it takes a while for you to do this.You then stay at that time [age] for essentially a couple of thousand years.Your brain then . . . which collectively we're only using 2.2% of our brain. Idon't care what they're telling us. We're only using 2.2%. You get a minimum of400% capability over what you normally had. Now, what this does is this allowsyou to contribute.[406] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn406] Human genetics, Tompkins attests, contain the potential for extended life spansand higher brain capacities similar to what the Nordics normally experience,because our genetics are essentially the same. He says humanity currently doesnot experience such long life spans due to a combination of factors, whichinclude harmful gasses being pumped into the atmosphere by Reptilians and theirallies in order to limit human capacities and capabilities. In the followinginterview, he explained: So this then touches with the numbers of times per month that the [Reptilian]extraterrestrials drop the five gases on the industrial areas of the planet.These tankers – there's several sizes of them, some of them are only about 150feet long. They are a very strange shape for a supersonic vehicle. Of course,they come from a mothership…. So they operate at a low altitude, not becausethey are afraid they're going to be seen, but because they want the gases to bedistributed close to the people.[407] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn407] Tompkins maintains that the Nordics have been covertly assisting companies suchas TRW (now part of Northrup Grumman) in developing a range of pharmaceuticalproducts, such as the life extension pills to counteract the biological effectsof the toxic gasses pumped into the atmosphere by Reptilians and their allies.If Tompkins is correct, this provides an explanation for the chemtrailsphenomenon, which many researchers have concluded is responsible for spreadingairborne diseases such as Morgellons.[408] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn408]According to Goode, the Nordics belong to a “Super Federation” of between 40-60human-looking extraterrestrial races that have been intervening on Earth forhundreds of thousands of years in 22 long-term genetic experiments. It’sfeasible to assume that these genetic experiments are designed to test howhumans respond to a range of environmental conditions, where alien interventionseither inhibit or assist human evolution. Therefore, it is quite plausible thatthe Nordics and other human-looking aliens have been countering the efforts byReptilians and their allies to pollute the atmosphere, water and food supply,and alter human genetics. The life extension and brain enhancement pillsdeveloped by TRW, with Nordic assistance, in this light appear to be yet anotherattempt to alter human DNA in order to help individuals overcome toxicpollutants and attain their fullest potential.It would be incorrect to infer that the Nordics themselves depend onpharmaceutical products to achieve the remarkable thousand year life spans theyare credited with by Tompkins, Goode and others. In his 1955 book, Inside theFlying Saucers, Adamski provides special insight into exactly how the Nordicsare able to achieve their extended life spans. He describes being inside one oftheir motherships when he saw a remarkable picture whose significance wasexplained by his Nordic host, “Kalna”: On the wall exactly opposite the door through which we had entered hung aportrait which I was certain must represent Deity. The emotion which the beautyof the two young [Nordic] women had aroused in me was momentarily forgotten asthe wonderful radiance emanating from the portrait enveloped me. It showed thehead and shoulder of a Being who could have been eighteen to twenty-five yearsof age, in whose face was embodied the perfect blended balance of male andfemale, and whose eyes held a wisdom and compassion beyond description. I do notknow how long I was enrapt by this beauty. There was no interruption, until Imyself returned to an awareness of my surroundings. I did not need to ask whothis Being was. Kalna broke the silence by saying: “That is the symbol ofAgeless Life. You will find it in every one of our ships as well as our homes.It is because we keep this symbol always before us that you will find no ageamongst our people.[409] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn409] What Adamski was told suggest that the Nordics, with their unrestricted braincapacity and unpolluted bodies, are able to hold the idea of youthful vitalityin their consciousness in a way that directly influences their genetics. Putsimply, aging is not experienced by them because their consciousness does notallow the idea of being old to enter. What is remarkable here is that thescience of epigenetics, which is based on a similar theory proposed bybiologists, such as Dr. Bruce Lipton, was developed more than seven decadesafter Adamski’s book![410] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn410]According to the Kardashev scale for categorizing advanced civilizations, theNordics (as well as Reptilian and Gray extraterrestrials) fall into thecategories of either Type I civilizations (able to work with planetaryenergies); or Type II civilizations (able to work with energies at a stellarlevel).[411] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn411] They need to be distinguishedfrom a more highly evolved group of extraterrestrials Goode describes as the“Sphere Being Alliance,” which are Type III extraterrestrials that work withgalactic scale energies.Goode says that the Sphere Being Alliance has created a basic technologicalparity, between different space programs and extraterrestrial alliances, interms of offensive and defensive weapon technologies. This is consistent withwhat was discussed in chapter 11 regarding the claims by Dr. Preston James thatRussia was being secretly assisted by “Nordic extraterrestrials” in developingdefensive weapons. This technological parity is essential to the differentfactions of humanity negotiating the peaceful transition of power, enabling themto move it from a small group of global elites (the Cabal), into the hands ofgenuinely representative organizations that will promote the interests of allpeople on the planet. This peaceful transition is critical for humanity so itmay adequately prepare for upcoming stellar events such as a possible “solarsneeze” involving immense coronal mass ejections that Tompkins and Goode’sinsider sources predict is highly probable.Lack of preparation for such an event can be catastrophic, exemplified by whatoccurred to the flash-frozen civilization discovered in Antarctica. IfPresidents Trump and Putin, or other world leaders do move forward, thepredicted announcement of the Antarctica discovery will carry with it theimplicit warning that such events have not only been regular occurrences inhuman history, as Charles Hapgood claimed, but may occur again in the very nearfuture.Goode has pointed out that the Sphere Being Alliance has strongly emphasizedspiritual development and consciousness-raising (the “hippy love and peacemessage”) as indispensable for humanity dealing with the challenges itfaces.[412] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn412] At an individual level, Goode hasadvised people to increase their “service-to-other” activities in order to helpcreate the optimal time-line of circumstances, and to also be prepared forimpending stellar events that he has been told are part of an upcoming“Ascension Event.”[413] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn413] While the concept of a“service-to-other” comes from the “Law of One” or “Ra” material, this was notthe only literature recommended to Goode by officials running the secret spaceprograms for understanding current cosmological events and the nature ofconsciousness. In August 2015, in his response to a question, Goode said: I knew that some groups were ordered to read the “RA” and “SETH” Data while inthe programs at the same time I knew many groups were working to discredit bothworks.[414] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn414]The Seth books (1963-1984) preceded the Law of One books (1981-1984) by almosttwo decades, and are widely regarded as among the finest and most influentialchanneled material ever to be released. While the Law of One focused onpresenting a comprehensive conceptual framework for understanding howconsciousness evolves, the Seth books in contrast focused on concrete steps anindividual could take to change their personal and collective reality byaltering their conscious belief systems. Goode has been told a service-to-other polarity, recommended in the Law of Onematerial, is essential for humanity at this point in our personal and collectiveevolution. Complimentary, the approach taken by the Seth material is to explainthe nature of consciousness and how it relates to the body, allowing movement inthis evolutionary direction. According to Seth: The body’s main purpose is not only to survive but to maintain a quality ofexistence at certain levels, and that quality itself promotes health andfulfillment.[415] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn415] In this regard, the ability to survive, let alone live a thousand years, becomesmeaningless if the “quality of life and experience” does not meet the minimumrequirements deemed by the species itself as acceptable.One of the vast problems, in terms of individual and mass perceptions, is asense of hopelessness or lack of personal power to change things for the better.In the Seth book, The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events, manyillustrations are given of those who saw themselves as “effective rather thanineffective,” thus rising up to do heroic deeds within otherwise mundane livesbecause they did not succumb to despair. Seth explains how a negative belief canbe undermining: Despair or apathy is a biological “enemy.” Social conditions, political states,economic policies, and even religious or philosophical frameworks that fostersuch mental states, bring about a biological retaliation. They act like fireapplied to a plant.[416] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn416] If, as Seth states, “the quality of life is important above all,” then how canindividuals fuel the belief in being “effective” to maintain and enhance thevery quality of life, which by nature will be interconnected with others.[417][part0000_split_046.html#_edn417] Here is Seth’s answer that may surprise some:When you are having fun, you are helping others. When you are not having fun,and telling yourself that you are helping others, you are not helping them oryourself. So when you think in terms of responsibility, and when you make adivision in your mind between responsibility and joyful fulfillment, then youare denying yourself and the world much pleasure, and hiding … from yourself andthe world the great joyful symphony that is yourself. When you are fulfilling the joyful nature of your being, you are helpingyourself and you are helping others. When you help others because you think youmust, but it goes against the grain, then they know it, and you inflict uponthem the obligation that you have no right to inflict.[418][part0000_split_046.html#_edn418]Seth provides clarity on how one can achieve this positive orientation, and feelconnected to the needs of others. It does not come from sacrificing one’s ownjoy or needs to make others happy, as a service-to-other polarity might suggestto some, but by following one’s own life path: When you follow your own nature, you automatically and naturally feel for theneeds of others … When you are joyful and free, and when you are having fun, youautomatically feel … your oneness with all other creatures of the universe, andyou know your place in All That Is. [419] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn419]Incredibly, this “joyful and free” attitude is what Tompkins says distinguishedthe Nordic extraterrestrials he worked with at various corporations during hisaerospace career. His book, Selected by Extraterrestrials, highlights howfun-loving the Nordics were, despite the many dangers they faced and thecomplexity of situations they often were dealing with.This meant that the Nordics, by example, were naturally showing how they hadmastered a sense of “oneness” that was evident in their fun-loving attitude,reflecting the pursuit of their “own nature,” inclusive of advancedtechnological development. Therefore, the Nordic extraterrestrials Tompkinsdescribes meeting had achieved a rare balance of spiritual understanding alongwith technological development. People do not have to spend months in meditationor follow rigorous spiritual exercises to raise their consciousness, but Sethstates that “consciousness requires new experience, challenge andaccomplishment.”[420] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn420] When people strive toconnect instead of disengage, believing that their innate inner wisdom isguiding them, fun and joy can freely enhance life’s quality, serving not onlyoneself, but others too. The advice of the famed mythologist Joseph Campbell to“follow your bliss,” therefore, becomes a critical step in raising one’sconsciousness.[421] [part0000_split_046.html#_edn421]Consequently, creating the optimal timeline for full disclosure and an“Ascension” event means having the courage to freely follow a true calling inlife coming from within, finding the fun and joy even in challenges, and thenrealizing satisfying accomplishments by overcoming them. This spiritual adviceis a key part of the assistance provided by the Nordics and otherextraterrestrials through their “contactees” such as Tompkins. In turn,authorities in the Secret Space Program Alliance emphasize the Seth material asGoode states, and recognize its value to influence personal reality. "},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSION Documentary evidence provided by Tompkins in this book clearly reveal that theUS Navy has been involved since the 1950’s in designing and developingkilometers-long space battle groups, which it views as critical for planetarydefense. The Navy’s interest in building space battle groups is an outgrowth ofits earlier experiments with flying aircraft carriers that date back to the1920’s, when the Navy commissioned the Goodyear and Zeppelin companies to buildthe USS Akron and USS Macon.Tompkins’ testimony, and the degree to which covert Navy officials haveencouraged him to come forward with his information, reveal that he is part of aNavy sanctioned “full disclosure” process. Consequently, there is good reason tobe optimistic that the foundations for full disclosure are currently being laidas the Trump administration appears to be coordinating with the Navy, FBI, andRussia in developing its policies. Some of these policies are focused onrevealing the existence of highly classified technology programs,extraterrestrial life and even archeological discoveries, such as the site inAntarctica.Among the many benefits of full disclosure is that it will bring an end to adecades-long separation between a technologically advanced “breakaway humansociety” and the rest of humanity. This technological form of apartheid isglobal in scope, devastating in the impact it has had on the quality of life ofcitizens around the world, and has spawned many criminal abuses. Furthermore,full disclosure would put a stop to any harmful practices involving toxicchemicals deliberately inserted into the atmosphere to severely limit our innatehuman potential. It is very doubtful that the “limited disclosure” initiativesupported by the USAF would bring an end to this technological division. Thesame applies to those doctoring the content of artifacts discovered inAntarctica to create another limited disclosure scenario, brought on byimpending announcements featuring leading scientists and archeologists to revealonly what is authorized.Limited disclosure would most likely usher in a more subtle form of “technologyapartheid,” which for decades has continued maintaining the global system bywhich our innate capacities continue to be inhibited through toxins covertlypumped into the air, water and food supply, keeping us as an easily exploitedspecies. Ending the artificially created global system of technology apartheidbetween different portions of humanity is essential for developing a globalleadership that genuinely represents the aspirations of all humanity. Mostimportantly, full disclosure will facilitate our evolution as a species, wherehuman life spans and mental capacities are restored. This is the innatepotential we possess through our genetic connection to the Nordics and otherhuman-looking extraterrestrial groups, thereby allowing us to join the rest ofthe Galactic community as full partners."},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHOR Dr. Michael Salla is an internationally recognized scholar in internationalpolitics, conflict resolution and U.S. foreign policy.
