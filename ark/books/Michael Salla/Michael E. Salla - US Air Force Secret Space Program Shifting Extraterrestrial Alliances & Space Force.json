The gradual emergence of SpaceForce offers an opportunity for the Air Force to publicly reveal the mostwell-guarded secrets in its arsenal of exotic spacecraft, unconventional weaponsand futuristic technologies, assembled over the more than seventy years sinceits official emergence as a military service back on September 18, 1947. What isdriving this profound change is the realization by Air Force leaders that theyhad been deceived by their major allies in the research and development ofadvanced aerospace technologies. Countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada orAustralia are not the culprits, but rather the corporations and “Deep State”affiliated groups behind the development and building of advanced spacetechnologies.In addition, extraterrestrial allies participated in the deception over spacetechnologies that were built and deployed. These groups encouraged USAF leadersto believe that their arsenal of space weapons and spacecraft under secretdevelopment would make the Air Force a space power with which to be reckoned.The discovery of this deception made USAF leaders realize that, rather thanbeing the “tip of the spear” of the military’s projection into deep space, theyhad essentially become something analogous to a space-based “coast guard” –lagging far behind their primary competitors and other military forces with deepspace capabilities.In this book, you will learn about the untold trials and triumphs, power-hungrymaneuvers and public frauds comprising the history of the Air Force’s secretspace program (SSP), which ultimately lead to its redemptive future andre-aligned national mission. Spanning from its humble roots in the US Army’sSignal Corps; to its unexpected and paradigm shifting recovery ofextraterrestrial craft in the 1940’s; to secret agreements made with a breakawayGerman colony in Antarctica (the Fourth Reich) and different extraterrestrialgroups in the 1950’s; to its complicity in the German infiltration of NASA andthe Military-Industrial Complex in the 1960’s; its development of stealth spacestations from the 1970’s; deployment of squadrons of saucer, triangular andrectangular-shaped craft beginning from the 1980’s to the 1990’s; and finally,its great awakening made possible by its 2016 discovery of the grand deceptionthat had been perpetrated upon it.The story that emerges is one of the development of a secret space program thatwas co-opted into serving the interests of the Deep State and their shadowyFourth Reich allies, rather than becoming a genuine space power serving USnational interests. After discovering they had been falsely and disgracefullybetrayed, Air Force leaders woke up and courageously made the momentous decisionto shift alliances. In the process, they began taking globally significant stepsto realign the Air Force’s covert space program with a more ethical group ofextraterrestrials who had previously helped its sister military service, the USNavy, to become a genuine power in deep space. This stalwart change led to theAir Force taking bold steps to reveal the existence of its arsenal of spacecraftto the US public, and to taking action to prevent a false flag operation by theDeep State/CIA designed to start World War III.In the three previous books of this Secret Space Program series, readers havebeen given detailed information about the evolution of space programs belongingto the US Navy (Solar Warden), an Antarctica-based German colony (Dark Fleet),and a transnational corporate entity (Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate).This was made possible by the groundbreaking testimonies of William Tompkins,Corey Goode, and other insiders who revealed their participation in, or directknowledge of, “20 and back” programs in which highly advanced technologies wereused on personnel serving in the SSPs for 20-year periods. At the end of theircovert space service, these personnel were allegedly “mind-wiped” and“age-regressed” before being returned to the time when they were initiallyrecruited, most often just after they had started their regular militaryservice. The role of the US Air Force was only briefly mentioned in previousvolumes since the practice of a “20 and back” was not used on personnel in itsclassified space operations, which were limited to near-Earth operations ratherthan deep space. In the book before you, the full historical details are laidout to show exactly how and why the Air Force developed a very different spaceprogram to that of the Navy, and why the Air Force made the decision early on tothrow in its lot with the German Antarctic colony and extraterrestrial groupsthat were allied with it. Dramatic events led the Air Force to break free ofthis cunning yoke that usurped its authority and clouded its visionary goals fordecades, with the colossal move of strategic separation finally taking placefrom 2016 to 2018.It’s no accident that in the midst of a profound strategic shift inextraterrestrial alliances by USAF leaders, the idea of a Space Force hasemerged and is being aggressively pushed by President Donald Trump and hisadministration. Aggregating US space assets into one unified military departmentwill make it easier for the USAF and the Trump administration to combat the DeepState and its Fourth Reich allies who were caught off guard by the Air Force’sstrategic realignment. Handing control over space assets in Earth-orbit to SpaceForce should not present a major problem for most of the military services. Thebig question, however, is when will the Navy hand over control of its “deepspace” assets, the battle groups belonging to Solar Warden, as Space Force isbrought to life through executive orders and Congressional legislation. OnFebruary 19, 2019, Space Policy Directive-4 was issued by President Trumpstating that Space Force would initially be located under the Department of theAir Force, and he privately affirmed that a Department of the Space Force wouldeventually be created. This indicates that Solar Warden, unknown to Air Forceleaders until 2016, will not be integrated into Space Force while it is underthe administrative control of the Department of the Air Force. Only after thecreation of a fully independent Department of the Space Force will the Navy handover control of its space battle groups that have been secretly deployed sincethe early 1980’s.Space Force will pave the way for the Air Force, and eventually the Navy, toenter into a more transparent and accountable era where their true spacecapabilities are gradually revealed to the general public, and funding providedby the US Congress is done in a manner consistent with the US Constitution. Thiswill do away with the corrupting influence of black budget funds provided by theDeep State/CIA through illicit activities that deeply compromise the ethos andvalues of all branches of the US military which have had to rely on these fundsto secretly build their respective space programs. It can be anticipated that asSpace Force emerges as a separate military branch first under the Department ofthe Air Force, and eventually becoming independent under the Department of theSpace Force, advanced spacecraft and aerospace technologies already deployed inEarth-orbit and deep space will gradually be revealed.The general public will be exposed for the first time to highly-advancedtechnologies that have been exclusively developed for secret space operations byselect military and corporate entities dating back to the 1940’s. This willtransform the civilian aviation and space industries; provide free energysources that liberate humanity from its dependence on fossil fuels; andrevolutionize the medical industry with the release of holographic andelectromagnetic healing technologies covertly used for decades within the secretspace programs. The release of such technologies will be vital in helpinghumanity satisfactorily deal with predicted catastrophic Earth changes arisingfrom a number of possible events including: a “solar flash” (aka “micronova”),magnetic and geophysical pole shifts, and the infusion of cosmic rays from thegalactic region into which our solar system is currently entering. Space Forcewill provide an opportunity for US authorities to disclose the truth aboutvisiting extraterrestrial life and kickstart diplomatic relations that will beurgently needed to help humanity deal with the many challenges that lie ahead,leading us to become a worthy member of a richly diverse galactic community.

O n December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Wilbur and Orville Wrightstarted the aviation revolution with the first successful flight of a controlledpower driven heavier-than-air “aeroplane”. Their “Wright Flyer”, piloted byWilbur, flew for a brief 12 seconds over a distance of 120 feet, yet it was amomentous flight, nonetheless. Longer flights were performed over the next twoyears while reporters and the scientific community largely ignored theirpioneering efforts of having conducted the world’s first ‘heavier-than-air’flights. Famously, Scientific American wrote two skeptical stories in 1904 and1905 about the alleged accomplishment. It was only on December 15, 1906, thatScientific American finally confirmed that the impossible had happened: “In allthe history of invention, there is probably no parallel to the unostentatiousmanner in which the Wright brothers of Dayton, Ohio ushered into the world theirepoch-making invention of the first successful aeroplane flying-machine.” [1][text00029.html#_edn1]At a time when the horse and buggy was still the dominant form of transportationfor most Americans, and Ford Model T automobiles would only start rolling offthe production line in 1908, the development of the first airplane wasremarkable. Like the 1969 Apollo moon landing, the Wright brothers’accomplishment at Kitty Hawk would become a defining moment in shaping humanconsciousness. Like Icarus, precocious young men soon began dreaming of the daythey could fly into the heavens – modern style – in the newly invented aeroplane(Greek for “air wanderer”). Included among those envisaging new opportunitiesmade possible by the innovative invention were officers of the US Army who,after Scientific American’s startling confirmation, came to watch what theWright brothers were doing.On June 28, 1909, the Wright brothers demonstrated their “Military Flyer” forthe Aeronautical Division of the US Army Signal Corps. Immediately recognizingthe military potential of the airplane, the Army offered a contract for atwo-seater model that could fly 40 mph (64 km/hour) for a distance of 125 miles(201 km). After passing rigorous testing, the Signal Corps accepted the MilitaryFlyer Model A on August 2, 1909, and paid the brothers $30,000 ($830,789.01 USDin 2018). [2] [text00029.html#_edn2]The brothers next established their Wright Company on November 22, 1909, withits first factory built in their home town of Dayton, Ohio. Soon after, the“Wright Flying School” was launched in 1910 at Huffman Prairie Flying Field, andit would train over a hundred pilots. Up to its merger with the Glenn L. MartinCompany in 1916, the Wright Company built approximately 120 airplanes usingpatents for different models designed for the nascent aviation industry, whichincluded the militaries of other nations that by 1914 had become belligerents inthe First World War.Among the leading military aviators trained by the brothers was Henry Harley“Hap” Arnold, who graduated as a pilot in 1911, and subsequently became one oftheir test pilots. Decades later, Arnold would rise to the apex of the US ArmyAir Force and become the only five-star general recognized by two militaryservices – the US Army and the US Air Force (newly created in September 1947).After World War II, Arnold became a key figure in launching a new militaryaviation revolution – aerospace operations through his sponsorship of ProjectRAND (an acronym for “research and development”). A picture containing outdoor, boat, sky, water Description automaticallygenerated [Image00001.jpg]Figure 1. Soldiers watching test of Military Flyer in 1909 The U.S. formally entered hostilities of WWI on April 6, 1917, and three majorArmy Signals Corps installations were quickly built in the vicinity of Dayton,Ohio. Since Wilbur Wright passed away in 1912, Orville Wright was widelyconsidered to be the undisputed leader in aviation science. The firstinstallation was Wilbur Wright Field, which was established on May 22, 1917,approximately five miles (8 kilometers) northeast of Dayton. Wilbur Wright Fieldincorporated the Huffman Prairie Flying Field used by the Wright brothers andassimilated their “Wright Flying School” with the main purpose of trainingmilitary pilots for the coming war effort. Next, McCook Field was established onDecember 4, 1917, for testing and experimentation purposes. Finally, FairfieldAviation General Supply Depot was formed in January 1918, and providedlogistical support to Wilbur Wright Field, McCook Field and other Army SignalsCorps installations in the Mid-West.During the interwar years, Dayton, Ohio, continued as the hub for militaryaviation research and development – largely due to Dayton civic leaders donating5,250 acres of land to the US Army in 1924 to continue advanced aviationresearch in the Dayton area. [3] [text00029.html#_edn3] The Army subsequentlyestablished “Wright Field” in 1927, dedicated to both Wilbur and Orville, andincorporating both the Wilbur Wright Field and McCook Field installations.Significantly, advanced research could fully integrate with testing andprocurement efforts once the newly created US Army Air Corps established in 1926set up its Materiel Division at Wright Field where leading aviation scientistscould then work side by side to solve complex aeronautical problems. Here, scientists continued to improve aircraft. The scientists also realizedthat they had to work together to create the best possible plane. Beforecreation of the Army Air Corps, researchers studied individual parts of theplane, like engines, armor, wings, and propellers. Now scientists continued tospecialize in individual components of planes, but they realized that changes ina plane's armor would affect all other parts of the plane. The same held truefor changes in engines, wings, and the other parts of a plane. Under the ArmyAir Corps, the researchers now kept a dialog open between the various experts.[4] [text00029.html#_edn4] On July 6, 1931, a portion of Wright Field was separated and renamed PattersonField in honor of Lieutenant Frank Stuart Patterson who had been killed as atest pilot at “Wilbur Wright Field” in June 1918; and Patterson’s family, whohad been instrumental in later persuading Dayton civic leaders to donate landfor the establishment of Wright Field in 1924.Up until their eventual merger in September 1947 to create Wright-Patterson AirForce Base, Wright Field, and Patterson Field conducted complementary aviationactivities. Here is how Thomas Carey and Don Schmidt, authors of Inside the RealArea 51 , explained the complementary nature of Wright Field and Patterson Fieldin the lead up to and during World War II: Even though Wright and Patterson were two separate installations, their projectsoften augmented and strategically complemented one another, each providing areasof technical support or facilities and technicians the other did not have….Whenever a more advanced foreign design was recovered for analysis and study,Patterson Field was the most likely destination….Is it then any wonder that during and after WWII both facilities saw a dramaticexpansion? … The Materiel Division at Wright handled the procurement of aircraftand their parts on production lines around the country, which resulted inincreased testing and development, whereas the Air Service Commission atPatterson maintained the hardware’s logistical assimilation into the war. [5][text00029.html#_edn5] Italian and American Crash-Retrievals It was during the war years that rumors initially began circulating of flyingsaucer sightings and crashes. Of particular concern to the US Army Corps werereports that fascist nations were secretly studying and developing flying saucertechnologies. In 1933, Italy was a major aviation power and became the firstnation to begin secretly studying flying saucer technologies. A flying saucerhad crashed near Modena, Italy and Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini had orderedthe creation of a top secret study group led by inventor and electricalengineer, Guglielmo Marconi, to investigate the phenomenon. In addition to thecrash, there were numerous flying saucer sightings, and the reports on them wentdirectly to Mussolini and his subordinates. It’s worth noting that prior to theentente signed between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany in 1939, both Britain andthe U.S. tried to recruit Italy as an ally against Hitler. Italy had fought withthe Allies in World War I and had major border disputes with Austria that madean alliance with Hitler difficult.Britain’s Winston Churchill (then a Conservative member in the House ofCommons), in particular, had kept a steady correspondence with Mussolini wherenumerous topics such as aviation were discussed, and where Churchill expressedhis admiration of Mussolini. [6] [text00029.html#_edn6] It’s very possible thateither Mussolini told Churchill about Italy’s remarkable discovery, or Marconi,who became increasingly disgruntled over Mussolini’s growing militarism,disclosed to Churchill or British Intelligence what Mussolini was secretlystudying. Marconi’s ties to British intelligence date back to 1897 when he hadestablished the Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company (aka Marconi Company) whichlaunched the age of wireless communication. While Italy holds the distinction ofbeing the place where the first documented crash of a flying saucer hadoccurred, thereby sparking a secret official study group, it was not the onlycountry where such crashes would arise and likewise stimulate official studygroups.Multiple sources report the first flying saucer crash in the United Statesoccurred in April 1941 in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Charlotte Mann, thegranddaughter of Reverend William Huffman, a Baptist minister, says that he toldhis family about his late night call taking him to a secluded area to providelast rites for three dead or dying extraterrestrial beings. He was later swornto secrecy by representatives of the US Government and never spoke about theincident again. Mann has recounted details from her grandmother who exposed in adeathbed confession what her husband, Reverend Huffman, said he had witnessedthat remarkable night: She said that grandfather was out in the spring of 1941 in the evening around9:00-9:30, that someone had been called out to a plane crash outside of town andwould he be willing to go to minister to people there – which he did. Uponarrival, it was a very different situation. It was not a conventional aircraft,as we know it. He described it as a saucer that was metallic in color, no seems,did not look like anything he had seen. It had been broken open in one portion,and so he could walk up and see that.In looking in, he saw a small metal chair, gauges and dials and things he hadnever seen. However, what impressed him most was around the inside there wereinscriptions and writings, which he said he did not recognize, but were similarto Egyptian hieroglyphics. There were three entities, or non-human people, lyingon the ground. Two were just outside the saucer, and a third one was furtherout. His understanding was that perhaps that third one was not dead on impact …and so grandfather did pray over them, giving them last rites. [7][text00029.html#_edn7] The Cape Girardeau case was extensively examined by Ryan Wood in his 2005 book,Majic Eyes: Earth’s Encounters with Extraterrestrial Technology . He found otherwitnesses and multiple documents supporting key elements of Reverend Huffman’sstory, which first appeared in Leonard Stringfield’s 1991 report, UFO CrashRetrievals: The Inner Sanctum . [8] [text00029.html#_edn8] Wood wrote: Other living, supporting witnesses included Charlette Mann’s sister, whoconfirmed her story in a notarized sworn affidavit; and the brother of the CapeGirardeau County sheriff in 1941, Clarence R. Schade…. Seven leaked documentsfrom three sources since 1994 provide both direct and indirect support for crashretrieval events in the possible timeframe recounted by Reverend Huffman. [9][text00029.html#_edn9] Importantly, the witnesses and documents point to the US Army being in charge ofthe retrieval of the crashed craft and its transportation to Wright Field forscientific evaluation. At Wright Field, Army Air Corps scientists and engineerswould closely study the retrieved craft and attempted to reverse engineer it.Evidence that the Cape Girardeau craft was studied by Wright Field scientists ispresented in one of the seven leaked documents mentioned by Wood – a two-pagememo that is part of The Majestic Document s collection being investigated byRyan Wood and his father Dr. Robert Wood. The memo describes an “S” aircraftcreated by the reverse engineering effort: The ‘S’ aircraft was designed from an aerodyne recovered in 1941 that crashed in… Missouri and one captured in 1942 in Louisiana. Re-construction commenced in1945 with the assistance of German scientists at Wright Field”. [10][text00029.html#_edn10] The memo’s author, Thomas Cantwheel (a pseudonym), claimed that he joined the USArmy’s Counter Intelligence Corps around 1940, and later became a commissionedofficer in 1942 after World War II began. Cantwheel says that until 1958 heparticipated in multiple crash retrieval operations with an elite unit (later tobe called the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit) set up by the Army. In the 1960’s,he was recruited into the CIA to continue crash retrieval operations around theworld. Up to 1980, he continued to serve in a variety of US Army Intelligencepositions prior to his retirement from active service as a Lieutenant Colonel.Figure 2 is Cantwheel’s illustration of the aerodyne vehicle retrieved andexamined at Wright Field in 1947.A picture containing animal, invertebrate Description automatically generated[Image00002.jpg]Figure 2. The Aerodyne Vehicle The only researcher to have personally met with Cantwheel is Timothy Cooper, whoserved with the US Navy and US Marine Corps during the Vietnam War, and laterbecame a private investigator. [11] [text00029.html#_edn11] Cooper wrote afour-page “preliminary report” about his investigation into Cantwheel and hisclaims, and reached the following conclusion: All this has led me to conclude, that Cantwheel (or whoever he is) was a bonafide military intelligence officer, a product of “spycraft” training andexperience. As to his motives? I can only speculate this late date, that he wasclose to dying [estimated to be about 90] and wanted to tell what he knows ofUFO secrecy…. I had the impression that he was not happy, nor agreed with the“policy” of ridicule and harassment of honest and sincere military men whoreported the truth regarding UFO sightings and encounters, or worse still,ruining the careers and integrity of those who wanted to talk. [12][text00029.html#_edn12] In addition to Cooper’s endorsement of Cantwheel and his information, his memohas undergone preliminary authentication analysis. The Woods have developed alist of “eight attributes of authenticity” which they apply to the hundreds ofleaked Majestic documents they have in their possession in order to determinewhether they are genuine or not. [13] [text00029.html#_edn13] In the case ofCantwheel’s memo, they gave it an authentication rating of 40-60%, whichsignifies that it contains positive signs of authentication but has beenunder-researched. [14] [text00029.html#_edn14] In turn, this means that whileCantwheel’s memo is not conclusive as a standalone document, it is neverthelesshelpful as supporting evidence in understanding the Cape Girardeau crash and thehistory of US Air Force studies of retrieved flying saucers, along withclassified reverse engineering efforts such as the alleged “S” aircraft.Yet another leaked Majestic document refers to the 1941 Cape Girardeau crash,and additionally reveals President Roosevelt’s strategic response to it giventhe looming entry of the U.S. into World War II. The “White Hot Report” is aSeptember 1947 document, and the Woods gave it a “High Level of Authenticity”rating, which “means that virtually all of the available investigative channelsand ideas have been pursued and, at each test, the document has been shown to beauthentic.” [15] [text00029.html#_edn15] The report provides an overview of howa unified effort by the US intelligence community to understand the flyingsaucer phenomenon would not emerge until well after the 1941 Cape Girardeaucase: In the early months of 1942, up until the present, intrusions of unidentifiedaircraft have occasionally been documented, but there has been no seriousinvestigations by the intelligence arm of the Government. Even the recovery caseof 1941 did not create a unified intelligence effort to exploit possibletechnological gains with the exception of the Manhattan Project. [16][text00029.html#_edn16] What the White Hot Report tells us is that President Roosevelt was content tolet the US Army take the lead in studying the retrieved saucer craft in an adhoc manner, and to develop its intelligence assessment for a later time when theUS Government would be ready to advance a comprehensive intelligence plan, oncethe difficulties posed by the United States’ entry into World War II were met.This position was taken to ensure that the US military would not divert valuableresources into studying an advanced technology problem that did not directlyhelp the war effort. Nevertheless, intrusions of unidentified craft continued,including one in early 1942 as the White Hot Report mentions. Undoubtedly, thiswas a reference to the Los Angeles UFO Air Raid incident in which the Army wastasked to study a crashed flying saucer and develop its intelligence strategy,while the Roosevelt administration was concentrating its full resources onfighting World War II."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2The Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Whereyou stumble, there lies your treasure. Joseph CampbellO n the night of February 24, 1942, and on into the early hours of the 25 th ,residents of Los Angeles, California, were awakened by a dramatic UFO event. Itbegan when an unknown number of unidentified flying objects flew across the skyin eerie silence over Long Beach and the surrounding areas. Feared to beJapanese aircraft about to launch another surprise Pearl Harbor-like attack, USArmy and US Navy ships in Long Beach Harbor sprang into action and unleashedanti-aircraft artillery barrages against the mysterious craft that maneuveredbeyond modern airplane capabilities. While sirens, projectiles, and explosionsheralded the chaos of war upon a US shore, hundreds of thousands of peoplewitnessed the hovering UFOs which were well lit up for several hours bysearchlights and the anti-aircraft artillery during a total blackout. However,the UFOs did not attack. The only damage inflicted on the stunned citizenry wasdone by the artillery shells which fell to the ground causing minor injuries andsignificant property loss. [Image00003.jpg]Figure 3. The Great Los Angeles Air Raid The events of that night were covered extensively in volume two of this SecretSpace Program series, The US Navy’s Secret Space Program & NordicExtraterrestrial Alliance , where you can read about coverage by majornewspapers and contradictory official responses by the Army and Navy. [17][text00029.html#_edn17] What I will concentrate on here is the compellingdocumentary and whistleblower evidence which shows how the Los Angeles incidentdirectly led to Army Intelligence’s development of an elite team within itsCounter Intelligence Corps. Its primary responsibility would be to coordinatewith the Army Air Force in the retrieval and study of extraterrestrial craft,both at Wright and Patterson Field facilities during and after World War II.Among the many thousands of witnesses to the Los Angeles event was WilliamTompkins, a precocious 17-year old at the time who had gained the attention ofthe Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) because of the astonishingly accuratemodel replicas of US Navy ships he had constructed from his memory of theshipyards he had toured. At the time of the event, Tompkins had been placed atthe Vultee Aircraft Corporation by the ONI to learn about aircraft design andpropulsion. He got to see the shocking event up close and wrote about it in his2015 autobiography, Selected by Extraterrestrials . [18] [text00029.html#_edn18]Tompkins, and many other reports, supported the official Army position thatthere were several unidentified aircraft involved in the Los Angeles Air Raidincident. The Los Angeles Herald Examiner reported that civilian witnesses hadestimated 50 objects that slowly traveled in a “V” formation. [19][text00029.html#_edn19]Some of the UFO craft stopped motionless over Long Beach, according to Tompkins,and displayed an advanced propulsion system unknown at the time. The helicopterindustry was still in its infancy with only a small number produced by the U.S.and Nazi Germany for observation purposes. Yet the array of craft hovering overLos Angeles was quite large and silent, according to Tompkins and other witnessreports, and was able to withstand a withering artillery barrage. These clearlywere not any kind of experimental helicopter, dirigible, or other conventionalaircraft.According to the Los Angeles Herald Examiner , civilians reported that threecraft had been shot down while over the ocean. [20] [text00029.html#_edn20] Tompkins says that he learned from his Navy sources that only two flyingsaucer-shaped craft were in fact shot down. [21] [text00029.html#_edn21] Thesaucers were recovered respectively by the Navy and the Army, when it wasdiscovered that the saucer-shaped ships were unmanned fully automated drones.[22] [text00029.html#_edn22] Tompkins and witness reports of crashed vehiclesare further corroborated in leaked official documents, which will be examinedshortly.Were the UFOs part of a reconnaissance mission by Japan, or perhaps other Axispowers, to ascertain the strength of anti-aircraft defenses for a possiblefuture attack, as Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary of War, publicly hypothesizedin a press release? [23] [text00029.html#_edn23] Or were the UFOsinterplanetary in origin, raising the possibility of revolutionary propulsionsystems that could radically transform the aviation industry and significantlyimpact the war effort? Answers to such questions can be found in a documentofficially released in 1974 through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). [24][text00029.html#_edn24]The FOIA document, dated February 26, 1942, is a memorandum from General GeorgeC. Marshall, Jr., Chief of Staff of the Army, to President Franklin D.Roosevelt. Issued one day after the Los Angeles Air Raid, it provides apreliminary report of what occurred and is consistent with what Tompkins andother witnesses saw. [25] [text00029.html#_edn25] It’s all but certain that thedocument would have been written with the assistance of General H. H. “Hap”Arnold, Chief of the Army Air Force. In the February 26 memorandum, Marshalltells Roosevelt: The following is the information we have from GHQ at this moment regarding theair alarm over Los Angeles of yesterday morning: From details available at this hour: 1. Unidentified airplanes, other than American Army or Navy planes, were probably over Los Angeles, and were fired on by elements of the 37 th CA Brigade (AA) between 3:12 and 4:15 am. These units expended 1430 rounds of ammunition. 2. As many as fifteen airplanes may have been involved, flying at various speeds what is officially reported as being “very slow” to as much as 200 mph and at elevations from 9000 to 18000 feet. 3. No bombs were dropped. 4. No casualties among our troops. 5. No planes were shot down. 6. No American Army or Navy planes were in action.Investigations continuing. It seems reasonable to conclude that if unidentifiedairplanes were involved they may have been from commercial sources, operated byenemy agents for purposes of spreading alarm, disclosing locations ofantiaircraft positions, and slowing production through blackout. Such conclusionis supported by varying speed of operation and the fact that no bombs weredropped. [26] [text00029.html#_edn26] This official memorandum points out that further US Army investigations werebeing conducted, indicating that Marshall would send updates on the incident tothe President as more was learned. Due to the magnitude of this situation,Arnold would have led the effort on Marshall’s behalf to gather more facts asquickly as possible. [Image00004.jpg] [Image00005.jpg] [Image00006.jpg]Significantly, the February 26 memorandum refers to the speed of some of theunidentified craft as ranging from “very slow” to 200 mph. This corroboratesTompkins’ account that some of the craft were indeed “hovering” over LosAngeles. Even further, it helps authenticate that the craft were non-terrestrialin origin since the only aircraft capable of hovering at the time (prototypehelicopters, balloons and dirigibles) would have easily been shot down by theanti-aircraft guns. This motionless capability would naturally have been ofgreat interest to Arnold and the Army Air Force, which was only beginning thetask of developing helicopters for surveillance purposes based on IgorSikorsky’s VS-300 prototype built in 1939. [27] [text00029.html#_edn27]According to FOIA records, there was no further official correspondence betweenMarshall and Roosevelt over the February 24/25 Los Angeles Air Raid. However,leaked Majestic documents show that the correspondence did indeed continuebetween them in two subsequent exchanges which contained important policy issuesabout how to deal with UFOs in the future. The Majestic document memorandumsbetween Marshall and Roosevelt are categorized by the Wood research team as“Medium-High Level of Authenticity”, which they define as follows: The medium-high level means that a considerable amount of investigation andtesting has been completed and there are strong signs of authenticity in the wayof content, forensics, typography, zingers etc. Although there may be someanachronisms identified they do not seem to be major. [28][text00029.html#_edn28] Importantly, the continued correspondence between Marshall and Roosevelt is alsoconsistent with the FOIA document, which confirms key aspects raised in theirsubsequent memo exchange, as I will shortly discuss. Furthermore, the leakedMajestic documents corroborate some of the information revealed in the testimonyof Bill Tompkins and others who had reported crashes of unidentified objectsfrom the artillery barrage, and their clandestine retrieval by special Army andNavy units. Consequently, I consider the leaked Majestic documents showingadditional written communications between Marshall and Roosevelt after February26, 1942, to be genuine.The leaked Majestic documents reveal that Roosevelt responded to Marshall’sFebruary 26 memorandum the next day. During the time between the initial reportand Roosevelt’s response, additional information had been gained. Namely, thattwo of the unidentified craft had been downed and retrieved. Briefed over thisnew development by the time of his response, the President directly referred tothe “celestial device” acquired by the Army Air Force, which he called a “newwonder”, and pointed out that his administration’s policy was to study thedevice with regard to learning any atomic secrets that might advance nuclearweapons research taking place through the Manhattan project. Thus, he instructedMarshall of the priorities and what to do next: I have considered the disposition of the material in possession of the Army thatmay be of great significance toward the development of a super weapon of war. Idisagree with the argument that such information should be shared with our allythe Soviet Union. Consultation with Dr. Bush and other scientists on the issueof finding practical uses for the atomic secrets learned from study of celestialdevices precludes any further discussion and I therefor authorize Dr. Bush toproceed with the project without further delay. This information is vital to thenation's superiority and must remain within the confines of state secrets. Anyfurther discussion on the matter will be restricted to General Donovan, Dr.Bush, the Secretary of War and yourself. The challenge our nation faces isdaunting and perilous in this undertaking and I have committed the resources ofthe government towards that end. You have my assurance that when circumstancesare favorable and we are victorious, the Army will have the fruits of researchin exploring further applications of this new wonder. [29][text00029.html#_edn29] [Image00007.gif]Figure 5. Re-typed Roosevelt memorandum to MarshallRoosevelt’s reply makes clear that despite his pro-Navy background (he was theformer Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1913 to 1920), he assigned theArmy/Army Air Force the primary responsibility for leading the investigation offlying saucer reports and dealing with any retrieved craft. [30][text00029.html#_edn30] This is largely due to the advice of his scienceadvisor, Dr. Vannevar Bush, and the Army’s role in leading the Manhattan Projectto develop atomic bombs, and the invaluable expertise it had acquired as aresult. [31] [text00029.html#_edn31]Significantly, Roosevelt took the effort to explain that the overall policywould be for the Army/Army Air Force and the Office of Strategic Services (ledby General William Donovan) to collect information about “celestial devices”wherever found around the world, without devoting significant resources intoresearch and development of their exotic propulsion systems. Roosevelt waseffectively telling Marshall’s subordinate, General Arnold, that the Army AirForce engineers would have to wait until the end of the war to study and reverseengineer their prizes, the “celestial devices”. The inclusion of Donovan in thisinner circle shows the importance of covert operations that the Roosevelt, andsubsequent Presidential administrations, would adopt in dealing with the flyingsaucer phenomenon.After sending his February 26 memorandum with an overview of the prior day’s LosAngeles event, and receiving Roosevelt’s February 27 reply, Marshall needed aweek before he could provide a more detailed assessment of the unidentifiedcraft that had been retrieved. On March 5, 1942, Marshall sent anothermemorandum to Roosevelt that explained the hypothesized origin of the twounidentified aircraft that had been shot down and retrieved by the Navy and theArmy: … regarding the air raid over Los Angeles it was learned by Army G2[Intelligence] that Rear Admiral Anderson ... Naval Intelligence, has informedthe War Department of a naval recovery of an unidentified airplane off the coastof California with no bearing on conventional explanation. Further it has beenrevealed that the Army Air Corps has also recovered a similar craft in the SanBernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles which cannot be identified asconventional aircraft. This Headquarters has come to the determination that themystery airplanes are in fact not earthly and according to secret intelligencesources they are in all probability of interplanetary origin. [32][text00029.html#_edn32] Marshall went on to explain to Roosevelt how the Army would deal with the UFOphenomenon: ... issued orders to Army G2 that a special intelligence unit be created tofurther investigate the phenomenon and report any significant connection betweenrecent incidents and those collected by the director the office of Coordinatorof Information. [33] [text00029.html#_edn33] This communique allegedly hallmarks the genesis of the Army’s legendary“Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit.”The Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit (IPU) became a highly-classified ArmyIntelligence unit that existed during the World War II era (see Figure 6). Afterinitially denying its existence, the US Air Force (as the direct successor tothe US Army Air Force in 1947) eventually found itself forced to acknowledgethat the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit did exist for a period of time. Throughdocuments released under the Freedom of Information Act, the existence of thishighly-secretive investigatory group was confirmed, despite the best efforts byAir Force officials to cast doubt on its existence.In May 1984, UFO researcher William Steinman sent a FOIA request to the ArmyDirectorate of Counterintelligence about the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit.Steinman received a reply from a Lieutenant Colonel Lance R. Cornine: As you note in your letter, the so-called Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit (IPU)was disestablished and, as far as we are aware, all records, if any, weretransferred to the Air Force in the late 1950's. The 'unit' was formed as anin-house project purely as an interest item for the Assistant Chief of Staff forIntelligence. It was never a 'unit' in the military sense, nor was it everformally organized or reportable, it had no investigative function, mission orauthority, and may not even have had any formal records at all. It is onlythrough institutional memory that any recollection exists of this unit. We aretherefore unable to answer your questions as to the exact purpose of the unit,exactly when it was disestablished, or who was in command. This last would notapply in any case, as no one was in 'command'. We have no records ordocumentation of any kind on this unit.\" [34] [text00029.html#_edn34] [Image00008.jpg] [Image00009.jpg] [Image00010.jpg]Cornine’s letter acknowledged that the IPU did exist up to the late 1950’s, butdownplayed its actuality as merely an “interest item” that was never anoperational army “unit” of any kind. However, a subsequent FOIA request to theUS Army Intelligence and Security Command led to a reply on April 9, 1990,written by Colonel William Guild. He stated, “all records pertaining to the unitwere surrendered to the US Air Force Office of Special Investigations inconjunction with Operation ‘Bluebook’.” [35] [text00029.html#_edn35] [ sic ] Soaccording to Army Intelligence records, the IPU was a formal unit related insome way to the study of UFOs, thereby contradicting what the Air Force had tosay about the IPU’s inactivity.Importantly, the FOIA documents confirm the creation of the IPU, and aredocumentary evidence which further corroborates the authenticity of the leakedMajestic document offering Marshal’s March 5, 1942 memorandum informing thePresident of the creation of a special investigative unit to study UFOs. In thememorandum, General Marshall ordered “Army G2” to create “a special intelligenceunit” to “investigate the phenomenon,” [36] [text00029.html#_edn36] so he almostcertainly was referring to the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit. This is theconclusion reached by Dr. Robert Wood and Ryan Wood in their respective effortsto authenticate the Marshall memorandum: The memo bears correct Office of Chief of Staff (OCS) file numbers and has\"Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit\" (IPU) typed on it at a later time by adifferent typewriter. It is logical to believe that this is the order that setsup the IPU. [37] [text00029.html#_edn37] Another important aspect of the FOIA IPU documents is that Colonel Guild’sresponse shows that the IPU was actively coordinating with the US Air Force’sProject Blue Book, which was based out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (asWright Field was renamed in 1947). The predecessors of Project Bluebook(1952-1969); Project Sign (1947-49) and Project Grudge (1949-51) were also basedout of Wright Field/Wright-Paterson. In 1948, the first formal study of UFOreports by Wright-Patterson technical and intelligence experts concluded thatUFOs were interplanetary in origin – the same conclusion reached in the March 5,1942, Marshall memo to Roosevelt about the retrieved Los Angeles craft. [38][text00029.html#_edn38] It’s very possible, and even likely, that some of thesame scientists at Wright Field that contributed to Marshall’s 1942“interplanetary origin” conclusion were involved five years later in the ProjectSign and/or Grudge findings.Furthermore, it’s worth noting that the IPU played a key role in investigatingthe various Project reports and providing sightings data that allowed the WrightField/Wright-Patterson technical experts to reach such a conclusion. However,according to General Hoyt Vandenberg, who was the US Air Force Chief of Staff in1947, disclosing the truth about extraterrestrial life “would cause a stampede,”[39] [text00029.html#_edn39] so he asked for the Wright Field experts to rewritetheir report and downplay the interplanetary (extraterrestrial) explanation!The collaboration between the IPU and Wright Field/Wright-Patterson aeronauticalexperts went far beyond the mere study and analysis of UFO reports; their workextended to the study of crashed/retrieved extraterrestrial craft. We get anidea of the true scope of IPU activities through the testimony of ThomasCantwheel (pseudonym), who was mentioned in Chapter 1 for his role in multiplecrash/retrieval operations. He says that the elite unit within the Army’sCounter Intelligence Corps (CIC) that he served with was, in fact, theInterplanetary Phenomenon Unit. Cantwheel states that the IPU was operationalright up to 1958, more than a decade after the Air Force had been created, whenhis service in the program ended. Timothy Cooper, while investigating Cantwheel,learned: Much of Cantwheel’s activities with CIC is unknown, only that he was assigned byCIC to a secret army investigative unit known as the IPU (InterplanetaryPhenomenon Unit). The IPU was an intelligence branch of the [Army Directorate ofCounter Intelligence] which passed on UFO reports to US Army G-2 (IntelligenceDirector)… Cantwheel claims to have been an CIC officer in the U.S. Army’sInterplanetary Phenomenon Unit from 1942 – 1958, with overseas TDY. His mainareas of interest was [ sic ] UFO sightings by military personnel. [40][text00029.html#_edn40] Cantwheel’s testimony corroborates a part of Steinman’s official FOIA response,which is the identification of the late 1950’s as the time when the IPU wasformally abolished as a functional Army intelligence unit, and most likelyabsorbed into a classified US Air Force intelligence program, presumably ProjectMoon Dust and Operation Blue Fly (to be discussed later). His testimony alsosupports what Colonel Guild confirmed in his FOIA response, where he stated thatthe IPU coordinated with the official US Air Force investigation of UFO reports– Project Blue Book.In addition to Cantwheel’s testimony, the leaked Marshall-Rooseveltcorrespondences show that the IPU was far more than merely an “interest item”that was never made operational, as claimed in the FOIA response by Cornine.Army Intelligence (G2) and the Army Air Force would coordinate in suchinvestigations and retrievals through the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit. It’snoteworthy that the US Navy, which had retrieved one of the craft found afterthe Los Angeles Air Raid event, also coordinated with the IPU and Army AirForce. This cooperation is demonstrated in a series of orders received by one ofthe Navy’s expert aviation engineers, Commander Rico Botta who headed the Bureauof Aeronautic’s Power Plant Design Branch. Botta had been identified by theNavy’s leading engineering division, the Bureau of Aeronautics, as theirrepresentative for investigating the power systems of retrieved antigravitycraft.On February 25, 1942, the very day that the two craft were retrieved followingthe Los Angeles incident, Botta was ordered to travel to Wright Field for anundisclosed assignment. Only a few months later, Botta traveled to advancedNavy, Army Air Force and corporate aviation facilities, and was finallytransferred in December 1942 to Naval Air Station, San Diego, to head up theNavy’s own intelligence gathering on the flying saucer phenomenon.

Order issued to Rico Botta to travel to Wright Field on the day of theLA Air Raid Botta recruited the young William Tompkins to participate in the top secretdebriefing of Navy spies embedded in Nazi Germany, which resulted in Tompkinscouriering the briefing documents based on the spies’ intelligence to theInterplanetary Phenomenon Unit, Army Air Force, aviation companies and to anyscientific institution capable of understanding flying saucer technologies.Tompkins says that he traveled all over the U.S. delivering his briefing packetswhich included leading Army Air Force facilities such as Wright Field. Botta andTompkins’ roles in the covert Naval espionage program of gathering intelligenceabout Nazi Germany’s research into flying saucer technologies can be read in thesecond book of my Secret Space Program series, The US Navy’s Secret SpaceProgram & Nordic Extraterrestrial Alliance .Respective efforts by the IPU, Army Air Force, Navy and major aviation companiesto gather intelligence and fully understand the flying saucer phenomenon werelargely constrained by the enormity of World War II. The extent of the colossalcommitment to the production of military aircraft for the war effort is welldescribed by Dana T. Parker, author of Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturingin the Los Angeles Area in World War II: In 1939, total aircraft production for the Army Air Corps and Navy combined wasonly 2,141 planes. By the end of the war, America produced an astounding 300,000planes ... The U.S. not only armed its own forces, but its allies as well…. Itaveraged 170 planes a day since 1942, more than the Soviet Union and GreatBritain combined.” [41] [text00029.html#_edn41] Douglas Aircraft Company and other aviation firms, many of which were based inthe Los Angeles area, maxed out their production facilities to meet themilitary’s ever-growing demand for bombers, fighters, and cargo aircraft. [42][text00029.html#_edn42] The number of airplanes built for the war effort was sostaggering that Donald Douglas declared: “Here’s proof that free men canout-produce slaves.” [43] [text00029.html#_edn43]Despite the enormous war production quotas met by Douglas and other majoraircraft companies, the Army Air Force still struggled to meet its own rapidexpansion needs. This was because General Arnold was ordered to assist Britain,the Soviet Union and other US allies in having operational military aircraftready to do battle against Nazi Germany. The challenge for the Army Air Force isdescribed in Arnold’s war diaries: For example, the United States accepted from the manufacturers in the years 1940through 1944 a total of almost 23,000 P-39 and P-40 aircraft. Yet at the peak oftheir inventory in 1944, the AAF had on hand only 4,600 of them. Even allowingfor attrition caused by training accidents and their limited U.S. use in combat,the figures reflect that the bulk of them went to Britain and the Soviet Union.[44] [text00029.html#_edn44] Given the immediate needs of the war, with aircraft companies struggling to meetambitious production goals, it was understandable why the Rooseveltadministration had decided that the vast undertaking of research and developmentfor the flying saucer phenomenon would have to wait until after the conflictended, as Roosevelt’s February 27, 1942 memorandum to General Marshall madeclear. [45] [text00029.html#_edn45]It was only after World War II came to an end that the Army Air Force and ArmyCounter Intelligence (through the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit) could begin inearnest the necessary research and development essential for a long-termstrategic response to the flying saucer phenomenon. Arnold was promoted to therank of five-star General of the Army on December 21, 1944, and soon after, asWorld War II came to an end, he decided to formally launch the necessaryresearch and development program that would combine military and corporateexpertise to master flying saucer technologies. Arnold decided to use left-overArmy Air Force war funds to launch Project RAND, and called upon his closefriend, the legendary aviation wizard Donald Douglas, to help. Under the publiccover of a conventional study focused upon a range of aerospace topics, themilitary began secretly to conduct with the Douglas Aircraft Company seriousresearch and development of crashed/retrieved flying saucer technologies."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 Project RAND & Non-Terrestrial Technologies “It isn't sufficient just to want – you've got to ask yourselfwhat you are going to do to get the things you want.”— Franklin D. Roosevelt I t is easy to imagine the US Army Air Force’s fervent desire to push ahead withreverse engineering its prize from the 1942 Los Angeles Air Raid. However, theretrieved antigravity vehicle would have to sit idly on the sidelines while thePresident, by necessity, instructed all military branches to use their fullresources toward building machines of war. Roosevelt did not believe the highlyadvanced science behind the “celestial devices” could be understood in time toassist in weapons development needs at the time. In turn, Americans would notfind out that in a woeful time of nation fighting nation, from out of the sky,something had come to usher in the promise of amazing technological advancesthat could lead humankind to the stars. Although the Army Air Force would haveto wait, behind-the-scenes the generals began to plan for the development ofthose highly desirable technologies.Two years after the retrieval, in a February 22, 1944, Roosevelt memorandum tohis science advisor, Dr. Vannevar Bush, the President reaffirmed his stance onthe policy of postponing the research and development of “non-terrestrial”technologies. This memorandum is another leaked Majestic document, which theWoods research team ranked as having a medium-high level of authenticity, andthus, concluded it credible in their professional estimation. The memo’s unusualclassification, “Double Top Secret”, contrary to initial skepticism, wasdiscovered by the Woods to be legitimate. [46] [text00029.html#_edn46] Withinthe document, expense was cited as the primary issue for not starting a researchand development program, since this would directly impact available resourcesfor producing conventional advanced aircraft and the atomic bomb. In the DoubleTop Secret memorandum addressed to “The Special Committee on Non-TerrestrialScience and Technology”, Roosevelt wrote: I agree with the OSRD [Office of Science Research and Development] proposal ofthe recommendation put forward by Dr. Bush and Professor Einstein that aseparate program be initiated at the earliest possible time. I also agree thatapplication of non-terrestrial know how in atomic energy must be used inperfecting super weapons of war to affect the complete defeat of Germany andJapan. In view of the cost already incurred in the atomic bomb program, itwould, at this time, be difficult to approve without further support of theTreasury Department and the military. I therefore have decided to forego such anenterprise. From the point of view of the informed members of the United States,our principle object is not to engage in exploratory research of this kind butto win the war as soon as possible.Various points have been raised about the difficulties such an endeavor wouldpose to the already hardened research for advanced weapons programs and supportgroups in our war effort and I agree that now is not the time. It is my personaljudgment that, when the war is won, and peace is once again restored, there willcome a time when surplus funds may be available to pursue a program devoted tounderstanding non-terrestrial science and its technology which is still greatlyundiscovered.I appreciate the effort and time spent in producing valuable insights into theproposal to find ways of advancing our technology and national progress and incoming to grips with the reality that our planet is not the only one harboringintelligent life in the universe. [47] [text00029.html#_edn47] [Image00012.jpg]Figure 8. “Double Top Secret” document signed by President Roosevelt The surplus funds mentioned by Roosevelt would indeed become available in 1945through a number of official channels, one of which was a five-star general ofthe Army, Henry “Hap” Arnold, who had successfully led the rapid expansion anddeployment of the Army Air Force throughout World War II. Arnold and the ArmyAir Force had effectively been ordered to sit on the retrieved flying saucersfrom the 1941 Cape Girardeau and the 1942 Los Angeles Air Raid incidents. Thesehad been secretly taken to Wright Field, the Army Air Force’s premier advancedaviation research facility, and would only be subjected to preliminaryscientific study until the war’s end.In the interim, the Army Air Force, the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, theOffice of Strategic Services (forerunner to the CIA) and the US Navy gathered asmuch intelligence as possible on what the Axis powers were doing in this arena,and covertly endeavored to retrieve any craft of non-terrestrial origin thatcame their way around the planet. In particular, the Navy, through its covertoperatives working undercover in Nazi-Occupied Europe, clandestinely gathereddata on what the Nazis were doing in their own research and development offlying saucer technologies. [48] [text00029.html#_edn48]After Japan’s surrender on August 15, 1945, Arnold was finally able to moveforward with funding research and development of the recovered alien craft usingsurplus war funds. In doing so, he closely collaborated with another aviationgiant, Donald W. Douglas, Sr., founder of Douglas Aircraft Company. Soon afterJapan’s formal surrender, Arnold flew to California to meet with Douglas andchart the way forward for a comprehensive R&D (research and development) planthat would lay the foundation for a yet another revolution in the aviationindustry, now using exotic propulsion systems such as antigravity. [49][text00029.html#_edn49]There are numerous reasons why Arnold chose to work with Douglas and his companyon the secret research and development of flying saucer technologies. First,Douglas Aircraft Company was among the leading manufacturers of aircraft forboth the Navy and Army Air Force during World War II, producing the mostadvanced military aircraft in the world. By 1945, Douglas Aircraft had producednearly 30,000 planes for the successful war effort, and its engineers andproduction facilities were world-renowned for their ability to incorporate thelatest aviation technologies into their products. In addition to having talentedengineers and advanced production facilities, there was another compellingreason why the Douglas company was an attractive partner for Arnold and the ArmyAir Force to lead R&D efforts over retrieved non-terrestrial technologies.The company’s owner, Donald Douglas, was also a pioneer and legend in theaviation industry. Like Arnold, Douglas had a direct personal connection withthe Wright brothers. In fact, when only 16 years old, Douglas witnessed the 1908test flight of the Wright brothers prototype military aircraft, the MilitaryFlyer, at Fort Myer, Virginia. In 1914, Douglas had graduated with a degree inaeronautical engineering, the first awarded from the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology (MIT). Douglas’ academic accomplishments and aeronautical abilitieswere recognized by the Army, which hired him in November 1916 as their chiefcivilian aeronautical engineer for the Aviation Section, Army Signal Corps.According to Dana Parker, the Army “waived the test for the position becausethere was no one in the country who knew more about aeronautical engineeringthan Donald Douglas.” [50] [text00029.html#_edn50] In 1941, Fortune Magazinewrote: “The development of the airplane in the days between the wars is thegreatest engineering story there ever was, and in the heart of it is DonaldDouglas.” [51] [text00029.html#_edn51]The next reason why Arnold chose Douglas was their close personal and workingrelationship dating back to their respective associations with the Wrightbrothers, and mutual interests in aeronautical developments. Seven months afterDouglas became the Army’s chief civilian aeronautical engineer, he was followedby Arnold who took up a number of executive positions within the AviationDivision in June 1917, two months after the U.S. entered World War I. Douglasand Arnold came to work together in modernizing US aircraft for the First WorldWar. Afterward, both eventually moved to the Los Angeles area where Douglasestablished his aircraft company in 1921, and Arnold, later in November 1931,took command of March Field. The Douglas and Arnold families became so closethat Douglas’ daughter, Barbara, eventually married Arnold’s second son, Bruce,upon his graduation from West Point Military Academy in 1943. [52][text00029.html#_edn52]The fourth reason is that Douglas personally witnessed the Los Angeles Air Raidevent, according to William Tompkins. Tompkins was very familiar with theoperations and history of Douglas Aircraft Company, due both to his employmentin its engineering division from 1950 to 1963, and also because of his visits toDouglas Aircraft when working under Rear Admiral Rico Botta out of the San DiegoNaval Air Station from 1942 to 1946. [53] [text00029.html#_edn53] In hisautobiography, Tompkins described the powerful influence the Los Angelesincident had on Douglas and other key corporate and military officials who hadexperienced the events of that chaotic night. [54] [text00029.html#_edn54] TheDouglas Aircraft Company was headquartered in Santa Monica, so it is natural toassume that other senior Douglas personnel also witnessed the paradigm-shiftingLos Angeles event and immediately began pondering and discussing itsrevolutionary implications for the aviation industry.Nevertheless, President Roosevelt’s February 27, 1942 memorandum made it veryclear that war resources would not be channeled into “exploratory research” ofthe retrieved craft. It is understandable that aviation pioneers such asDouglas, General Arnold, and others would have chafed at the bit to begin aserious study of the revolutionary propulsion and navigation technologies of theretrieved craft. So it is not surprising that according to Tompkins, Douglas,along with his chief engineer, Arthur Raymond, and Raymond’s assistant, FranklinCollbohm, came up with the idea of creating an informal working group to studythe available information. [55] [text00029.html#_edn55]Tompkins further claimed that the study group included two Army Air Forcegenerals and two Navy admirals. [56] [text00029.html#_edn56] If Tompkins werecorrect, then Douglas and General Arnold had convened an “informal” study groupdirectly after the incident despite President Roosevelt’s policy of not devotingfunding and resources to the “exploratory research” of the retrievednon-terrestrial spacecraft. Even though Roosevelt’s policy persisted, asoutlined in his February 22, 1944, Memorandum to the “Special Committee onNon-Terrestrial Science and Technology”, their work-around did not technicallydefy policy because of its non-official, or “informal” status. [57][text00029.html#_edn57]The study group’s primary goal was to investigate the scientific principles andresearch the implications of what had been witnessed. Additionally, the groupwas to analyze any information about the two retrieved craft taken to WrightField that the Army and Navy officers in attendance were authorized to share. IfGeneral Arnold was not an official member of the group, it is almost certainthat he would have appointed a subordinate to report to him on what the studygroup learned. At the very least, it can be assumed that members of theInterplanetary Phenomenon Unit would have known of, and even attended, meetingsof the informal Douglas study group. Consequently, at the end of World War IIwhen Arnold was finally allowed to move forward to fund research and developmentof the captured alien craft, Douglas Aircraft Company was the obvious choice toreceive the available funding.A final reason to consider entails the intelligence data gathered about theNazi’s research and development of flying saucer technologies which had beenaccumulated at Naval Air Station San Diego, and was made known to the DouglasAircraft Company. After beginning his covert assignment under Rear Admiral RicoBotta, Tompkins claimed that from the spring of 1943 onward he traveled at leastthree times to Douglas with briefing packets containing the latest informationabout the Nazi programs. [58] [text00029.html#_edn58]Tompkins identified both Arthur Raymond and Franklin Collbohm as being directlyinvolved in the study of the briefing packets delivered to Douglas AircraftCompany. In an interview, Tompkins recalled that one of the Douglas engineers hespoke to about the briefing packets might have been Collbohm, who later becamethe first President of the RAND Corporation founded in 1948 by the newly formedUnited States Air Force (USAF). [59] [text00029.html#_edn59] All of thisprovides yet another compelling reason for why General Arnold chose DouglasAircraft Company as the recipient for surplus Army Air Force funds that wouldestablish “Project RAND” – the forerunner to the RAND Corporation – which todaycontinues to perform a mission similar to the original intent behind itscreation.Project RAND Finally able to move forward using surplus war funds, General Hap Arnold hintedat what he planned to do in an official report to the Army Chief of Staff,General Marshall, stating: During this war the Army, Army Air Forces, and the Navy have made unprecedenteduse of scientific and industrial resources. The conclusion is inescapable thatwe have not yet established the balance necessary to insure the continuance ofteamwork among the military, other government agencies, industry, and theuniversities. Scientific planning must be years in advance of the actualresearch and development work. [60] [text00029.html#_edn60] Consequently, from surplus funds available to him after Japan’s surrender,Arnold was permitted to assign a significant proportion of these funds to thecreation of Project RAND as explained by an official US Air Force historian,Major General Huston: In the month of the final Japanese surrender, he [Arnold] flew to Californiawhere he and his decades-long friend, Donald Douglas, arranged for creation ofthe RAND Corporation. Arnold committed $10 million of AAF funds to the initialfunding of the new corporation. [61] [text00029.html#_edn61] General Huston described RAND’s early mission as: … a “technical consultant group charged with operations analysis and long-rangeplanning to examine future warfare and the best way the Air Force could performits missions. It was originally staffed with scientists and engineers fromDouglas Aircraft Corporation”. [62] [text00029.html#_edn62] A November 1965 article in The Progressive , by journalist Wesley Marx (archivedon the CIA’s Freedom of Information Act database) pointed out that Arnold wasable to use these Army surplus funds without any congressional approval: Without Congressional authorization and without taking bids, Air Force GeneralH.H. “Hap” Arnold managed to shift around enough funds to award a $10 millioncontract to Douglas Aircraft Company to set up Project RAND…. Project RAND wasto engage in a continuing program of scientific study and research on the broadsubject of recommending to the Air Force preferred methods, techniques, andinstrumentalities for this purpose. [63] [text00029.html#_edn63] Especially revealing is the next sentence in Marx’s article, where the elaboratesecurity mechanisms in place at the Douglas facilities are briefly described: Douglas furnished administrative services, security guards, and locked rooms inits Santa Monica, California, facility, and RAND became a subsidiary, butvirtually autonomous division of Douglas. [64] [text00029.html#_edn64] Ten million dollars in 1945 converts to approximately $855 million in 2018terms. [65] [text00029.html#_edn65] At the time, this was an enormous amount ofmoney to give to an aviation company to merely conduct scientific research andmake recommendations, and further, without taking bids from competitors.Arnold’s decision shows that he believed that the Douglas Aircraft Company wasat the time well ahead of its main rivals, Lockheed, Boeing and Northrup when itcame to starting research and development of advanced technologies found in theextraterrestrial spacecraft stored at Wright Field.The official website of the RAND Corporation curiously glosses over the enormousamount of money given to Douglas to set up Project RAND. [66][text00029.html#_edn66] The impression given is that Project RAND was a smallin-house Douglas operation, spending only “$640 in its first month of operation”to presumably pay for a group of senior scientists and engineers to meet anddiscuss advanced aerospace topics. This is certainly what official Air Forcehistorians, such as General Huston, claimed. [67] [text00029.html#_edn67]However, without a doubt, the $10 million allocated was being used for far morethan paying a small group of Douglas engineers and scientists to act as a“technical consultant group”, especially in a secure Douglas facility protectedby armed guards as Marx’s article stated. What were the armed guards protectingin the locked rooms at Douglas?William Tompkins and Project RAND’s Undisclosed Mission For an answer, we can turn to William Tompkins, who himself later worked at asecure research facility hidden within Douglas Aircraft’s engineering division.He was able to indicate the general purpose of Project RAND, as well as confirmits original establishment within Douglas: The Douglas/RAND scientists and concept conceivers were studying topics actuallyway above top secret. They were in a Think Tank deep inside the Douglas AircraftCompany’s Engineering Department A-250, that nobody knew existed at the SantaMonica, California Airport. [68] [text00029.html#_edn68] Tompkins further identified the real mission of Project RAND: It was created in … [October] 1945, as a special contract to Douglas AircraftCompany. At the Santa Monica Municipal Airport. Inside a highly classifiedwalled-off area in the Douglas Engineering Department, Project RAND studied theimplications of threatening alien agendas …. Then, on March 2 … [1946], a letterof contract was executed, which put Project RAND under the direction of Douglas’Assistant Chief Engineer, Frank Collbohm. The Douglas Think Tank was born.[emphasis added] [69] [text00029.html#_edn69] The exclusive role given to the Douglas campaign at the end of the war inestablishing the first US research center set up to focus on flying saucer craftand the possible threat posed by extraterrestrial visitors was emphasized byTompkins. [70] [text00029.html#_edn70] Furthermore, he explained how the ProjectRAND contract gave Douglas employees access to the technical informationpossessed by all other US research and development programs that were relevantto flying saucer technology and extraterrestrial life. [71][text00029.html#_edn71]A document that directly supports Tompkins’ claim that Project RAND wasprimarily set up to study the flying saucer phenomenon, while also collaboratingwith other leading US scientific organizations conducting advanced aerospaceresearch on this topic, is another leaked Majestic document. Known as the “WhiteHot Report”, it is dated September 19, 1947, and lists Project RAND among theresearch organizations studying artifacts recovered from the crash ofextraterrestrial vehicles dating back to the 1941 Missouri crash: Based on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currentlyunder study by AMC, AFSWP, NEPA, AEC, NACA, JRDB, RAND, USAAF, SAG and MIT, aredeemed extraterrestrial in nature. This conclusion was reached as a result ofcomparisons of artifacts [“from the Missouri”] discovery in 1941. The technologyis outside the scope of US science, even that of German rocket and aircraftdevelopments. [emphasis added] [72] [text00029.html#_edn72] [Image00013.jpg]Figure 9. Leaked “White Hot Report” dated September 19, 1947. Source: TheMajestic Documents Significantly, after an extensive investigation by veteran document researchers,Dr. Robert Wood and Ryan Wood, the “White Hot Report” received their highestlevel of authenticity. [73] [text00029.html#_edn73] Consequently, the “White HotReport” document is independent confirmation that the Douglas Aircraft Company,through Project RAND, was involved in the study of retrieved alien spacecraftjust as Tompkins claimed. This document also lends credibility to another coreelement of Tompkins’ testimony that he joined a secret Douglas engineeringdivision “Think Tank” in 1951, which did feasibility studies on differentantigravity spacecraft for the US Navy. Much more about Tompkins testimony anddocuments are furnished in my book, The US Navy’s Secret Space Program & NordicExtraterrestrial Alliance . [74] [text00029.html#_edn74]Secrecy surrounded Project RAND, according to Tompkins, who added, “They had thehighest, secret clearance even above the nuclear bomb.” [75][text00029.html#_edn75] This statement about the extraordinary level of securityclearance granted to the think tank further illuminates the article by Marx,which exposed the locked rooms and security guards provided for Project RAND.[76] [text00029.html#_edn76] More support for why the heightened security andclearance blanketing Project RAND was necessary while it was located at Douglasis found in a document written by a senior radio engineer with the CanadianDepartment of Transportation. Dated November 21, 1951, Wilbert Smith wrote tothe Controller of Telecommunications concerning flying saucer technologies beingsecretly studied in the U.S. at the time: “The matter is the most highlyclassified subject in the United States government, rating higher than theH-bomb.” [77] [text00029.html#_edn77] Thus, Project RAND’s secret study ofextraterrestrial technologies clearly merited the careful and delicate handlingit received. Struggle for US Air Force Supremacy in Space Publicly, Project RAND’s cover mission was to provide a “technical consultantgroup charged with operations analysis and long-range planning to examine futurewarfare and the best way the Air Force could perform its missions.” [78][text00029.html#_edn78] However, Project RAND’s highly classified real missionwas to help the US Army Air Force develop the necessary strategic scientificplanning that would be essential for the research and development of advancedaerospace technologies, especially those using antigravity and other exoticpropulsions systems. This was vitally important to the US Army Air Force’sadvancement of long term plans when it came to UFOs that were either ofinterplanetary origin or linked to Nazi advanced technology projects developedand deployed out of Antarctica. The dark web of Nazi exploits in Antarctica isdescribed in detail in book three of this Secret Space Program series,Antarctica’s Hidden History: Corporate Foundations of Secret Space Programs.Significantly, General Arnold, the man who provided the initial funding to setup Project RAND, was also a key figure in the creation of the InterplanetaryPhenomenon Unit that was established to deal with UFO crashes immediately afterthe Los Angeles incident. As the Commanding General of the Army Air Force, hewas able to provide personnel with the necessary technical expertise for thesecretive Army intelligence unit specially created to investigate reports ofaircraft crashes that were, in fact, interplanetary UFOs, or other forms ofadvanced aerial technologies.Arnold’s involvement establishes an important connection between the formationof Project RAND and the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit. This clear link supportsTompkins’ claim that Project RAND emerged out of an informal study group toexamine the Los Angeles UFO incident in 1942, and held from the beginning thesecret mission to help develop a long-term coordinated policy on the UFOphenomenon and extraterrestrial life.Through General Arnold, funding for Project RAND was provided by the US Army AirForce, and in October 1945 he further arranged for the RAND contract to comeunder the purview and responsibility of the newly created Army position of“Deputy Chief of Air Staff for Research and Development”. Major General CurtisE. LeMay was appointed to head up the new research position. In considering whowould get the position, the appointment board had recommended “an officer of thecaliber of Curtis LeMay.” [79] [text00029.html#_edn79]In September 1945, a month prior to Project RAND’s official opening, LeMay wasbriefly put in charge of the Army Air Force research facilities at Wright Fieldin Dayton, Ohio where he could familiarize himself with the retrieved saucercraft from the Los Angeles Air Raid, along with anything else recovered by theInterplanetary Phenomenon Unit. Over the several weeks of commanding WrightField’s advanced research laboratories, LeMay would come to fully appreciate theR&D challenges that lay ahead for the Army Air Force, not only withnon-terrestrial technologies but also with the advanced Nazi antigravity craftsecretly brought into the U.S. under Operation Paperclip.According to an army cryptologist, known as Agent “Kewper”, who had beenrecruited by the CIA in 1958 to work on the UFO topic, he personally saw fourNazi German flying saucers that had been brought into the U.S. under OperationPaperclip. Veteran UFO researcher Linda Moulton Howe first interviewed him in1998. She was convinced that Kewper who was also identified by the name Agent“Stein” (two pseudonyms that he used), was a credible eyewitness to the eventshe disclosed. [80] [text00029.html#_edn80] By 1958, the craft had been movedfrom Wright Field (later renamed Wright-Patterson AFB in September 1947) to theS-4 facility at Area 51 for storage and further study, which is where he sightedthem. In an interview with Howe, Kewper/Stein discussed the different types ofGerman craft he witnessed: At Area 51, the first two craft we saw looked almost identical. They weresmaller, not nearly as big as one in the back. Col. Jim [USAF; official “tourguide” at Area 51/S4] mentioned that those two were ‘Vril craft.’ We asked himwhat ‘Vril’ was. The Col. said it was a foreign saucer built in Germany in the1920s and 1930s. Then he pointed up ahead and said the next three craft werealien (extraterrestrial) craft retrieved from New Mexico. There were three morein the back and they were huge, all sitting on metal sawhorses or stands to keepthem off the ground. The disc on the very end was a huge one and Col. Jim saidthat was a German WWII craft built in 1938 and was jacked up higher on standsbecause it had a gun emplacement underneath, which he said the Germans called a‘death ray’. It was a different shape than the other craft, was dark in colorand had a larger top that stood up probably 10 or 12 feet above the saucer. Thatone had a diameter of about 50 or 60 feet. [81] [text00029.html#_edn81] Kewper/Stein went on to describe what he had been told about the locations wherethe four German flying saucer craft had been retrieved:The other four Col. Jim said were picked up in foreign areas. He said that theGerman Messerschmitt Haunebu 1 and 2 were picked up in Germany. The othersmaller two Vril craft I would think were picked up in Germany as well, but Col.Jim acted like he did not know where those two craft were retrieved. [82][text00029.html#_edn82]Over the years ahead, Wright Field/Wright-Patterson AFB would receive othercraft retrieved by the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, including the July 1947Roswell crash, and the less known but much more significant 1948 Aztec crash, asI will later explain.LeMay was reassigned to Washington DC in October 1945 where he took up theposition of deputy chief of Air Staff for Research and Development. With hisbrief exposure to the retrieved flying saucers at Wright Field, LeMay was readyto take charge of the Air Force’s secret effort of reverse-engineering exoticpropulsion systems. In his new leadership role, LeMay was put in charge ofOperation Paperclip under which German scientists had been brought into the U.S.to help the Air Force understand how advanced propulsion systems and flyingsaucer technologies worked. [83] [text00029.html#_edn83]Among the German scientists brought to Wright Field due to their involvement inflying saucer research was Professor Winfried Otto Schumann who had worked ondeveloping the prototype Vril flying saucer based on the highly respected Germanmedium Maria Orsic’s telepathic communications. [84] [text00029.html#_edn84]Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act confirm that Schumannwas on a list of German scientists, requested by the Army Air Force, whopossessed the skills relevant to its classified aerospace projects. [85][text00029.html#_edn85] It can be concluded that scientists such as Schumanhelped LeMay and the Army Air Force understand the principles and conceptsbehind the Nazi flying saucer projects. [Image00014.jpg]Figure 10. Document revealing Schumann was part of Operation Paperclip Barrett Tillman, author of the biography LeMay , wrote about how LeMay wouldrespond to the revolutionary potential of the advanced propulsion systems thatwere being studied at Wright Field and their relevance to the future of theaerospace industry: Though he had arisen to prominence on reciprocating [piston] engines, LeMayrecognized the immense potential of new propulsion systems. But apart from jetsand rockets, he was also receptive to other innovations such as satellites.LeMay’s scientific consultants convinced him that it was possible to place asatellite in earth orbit, but in 1946 the cost would have been astronomical.Amid the greatest downsizing in military history, millions for space explorationwere simply not a political reality. [86] [text00029.html#_edn86] While Tillman had no idea of the non-terrestrial technologies being studied atWright Field secretly, his comments show why LeMay was the perfect man toprovide Project RAND with the necessary information and access to the AirForce’s treasure chest of captured extraterrestrial and Nazi flying saucertechnologies. LeMay’s participation was critical to the success of ProjectRAND’s real mission: providing a long-term research and development program foracquired extraterrestrial technologies. For his leadership during the formativeperiod of Project RAND, from its October 1945 inception until his reassignmentto Europe in October 1947, LeMay has been publicly acknowledged, along withGeneral Arnold and Donald Douglas, as one of the co-founders of Project RAND.According to Alex Abella, author of Soldiers of Reason: The RAND Corporation andthe Rise of the American Empire , “If Arnold and his group were the foundingfathers of RAND, there is no doubt that LeMay was its Godfather”. [87][text00029.html#_edn87]The fact that only Army Air Force officials have been acknowledged by RANDhistorians in its establishment is a reflection of the fact that initial surplusfunds were provided by General Arnold. It is also due to the Navy’s downplayingof its interest in flying saucer and antigravity research both during and afterWorld War II. Yet the Navy, according to Tompkins, immediately began workingbehind the scenes with the Army Air Force and Douglas Aircraft engineers,through Douglas’ informal study group, on preliminary studies of theextraterrestrial phenomenon. At the same time, the Navy ran its covertintelligence program with operatives working within Nazi Germany’s flying saucerprograms.Quickly, the Navy realized that the Army Air Force planned to assert its primacywhen it came to the newly emerging field of space surveillance operations innear-earth orbit. The Army Air Force viewed future space operations as a domainit would dominate in the future. Through Project RAND, the secret scientific andmilitary study of the flying saucer phenomenon would serve to buttress Army AirForce efforts to exclude the Navy from playing a significant role in suchimpending space surveillance operations. A brief but staunchly heated policybattle arose between the Army Air Force and the Navy when it came to thedevelopment of the first system of space surveillance satellites. The Navywanted to cultivate an inter-service program, but the Army Air Force was notinterested. US Air Force historian Lt. Col. Mark Erickson wrote:[A] 1945 Navy investigation concluded that “in view of the recent progress inthe field of rocket missiles it may prove advantageous to review the possibilityof establishing a space ship in an orbit above the surface of the earth…. Thisorbit may prove more desirable for communications or for scientificobservations.” However, when in March 1946, the Navy requested the Army AirForces (AAF) join its satellite studies, the AAF concluded that a “joint programof evaluation, justification, and, if warranted, construction and operation ...was not agreeable,” and as a result the services “would conduct separateinvestigational programs.” [88] [text00029.html#_edn88] The RAND Corporation website provides a succinct explanation for what drove theAir Force to go it alone when it came to future space operations: “Major GeneralCurtis E. LeMay, then Deputy Chief of the Air Staff for Research and Development, considered space operations to be an extension of air operations.” [89][text00029.html#_edn89]LeMay commissioned a study by Project RAND that was published in May 1946 andtitled “Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship”. [90][text00029.html#_edn90] The RAND study was used to justify Army Air Forceprimacy when it came to overall military responsibility for space surveillanceoperations: The project arose out of the Air Force’s interest in developing intercontinentalballistic missiles. LeMay requested that RAND scientists prepare the studyquickly because the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics was already working with Wernhervon Braun and other captured Nazi scientists on a similar rocket project. LeMaywanted to outmaneuver his rivals and preserve the Air Force’s exclusive right tothe military uses of space. Within a month, RAND’s four employees, with the helpof consultants, wrote a farseeing report, breathtaking in its intellectualdaring and self-assured to the point of arrogance. “Preliminary Design of anExperimental World-Circling Spaceship” was the world’s first comprehensivesatellite feasibility assessment. [91] [text00029.html#_edn91] A picture containing black, sitting, text, photo Description automaticallygenerated [Image00015.jpg]Figure 11. RAND Preliminary Design Study The RAND study led to the Navy losing the policy struggle with the Army AirForce over jointly developing a space satellite reconnaissance system. As Abellaput it, “The oftentimes lyrical study served its purpose well and the Navyproject was shelved.” As Air Force chief of staff General Hoyt Vandenbergconsequently put it, the Air Force had “logical responsibility for satellites”.[92] [text00029.html#_edn92] Subsequently, as Erikson pointed out, “the Navydropped its satellite studies on 22 June 1948 after the US Air Force refused tojoin.” [93] [text00029.html#_edn93] Subsequent RAND publications focused on theArmy Air Force, and later the US Air Force (formed September 1947), conductingspace surveillance and in the development of the advanced propulsion systemsneeded for space flight.Undaunted, the Navy secretly continued its own research and development work onreverse engineering the recovered extraterrestrial craft from the Los AngelesAir Raid and the Nazi flying saucer prototypes acquired at the end of the war.These advanced craft were covertly brought into the US on Navy ships and takento classified facilities such as the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) inWashington DC. The Navy’s long term strategic interest was in developing spacebattle groups, and not the space surveillance systems for near-earth orbit whichthe Army Air Force was focused upon. [94] [text00029.html#_edn94] The principallocations the Navy chose for conducting its examination of flying saucerstechnologies were the Naval Research Laboratories and its flagship R&D locationon the West Coast, the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station. Tompkins said thatduring World War II, he flew multiple missions to China Lake with the briefingpackets he had prepared from the debriefings of Navy spies. [95][text00029.html#_edn95] This reflects the Navy’s sustained interest inunderstanding extraterrestrial technologies after the recovery of the aliencraft from the Los Angeles incident and its broader goals for future navaloperations in deep space.Due to Project RAND, all of the general public’s attention fell upon the ArmyAir Force when it came to future space operations and the UFO phenomenon. Thisescalated after the July 1947 Roswell incident when the Army Air Force announcedthat a flying saucer had crashed, only to retract the announcement hours later.[96] [text00029.html#_edn96] The effect of giving the public the impression thatthe Army Air Force was covering up the flying saucer phenomenon was laid. Inthis way, public attention was firmly directed away from what the Navy wassurreptitiously doing at its R&D facilities."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 The Roswell Crash and the Creation of MJ-12 Good leaders need a positive agenda, not just an agenda of dealing with crisis.–Michael Eugene Porter, American academic O nly two great military forces of land and sea existed in America to protectits vast shores and citizenry upon its entry into World War II. The oldestbranch, the Department of War, coordinated all Army operations while theDepartment of the Navy oversaw naval fleet activities. Both were using aircraftfor tactical troop or ship support. However, throughout this demanding time ofconflict, the aviation industry produced innovative planes capable of far more.Thus, during and immediately after World War II, the Army Air Force came tooperate as an independent military service under its Commanding General Henry H.Arnold who was fourth in the esteemed senior hierarchy of the Army’s five-stargenerals at the time. On January 29, 1946, Arnold and his successor, GeneralCarl Spaatz, reached an agreement with the Army Chief of Staff, Dwight D.Eisenhower, to formally separate the Air Force from the Army, therebyestablishing the Air Force and the Army as independent military services withinthe Department of War.The arrangement was analogous to the US Marine Corps and the US Navy beingindependent military services within the Department of the Navy, an arrangementthat continues to the present day. Soon after, however, the National SecurityAct of 1947 went a step further by formally separating the Air Force from theArmy with the creation of the Department of the Air Force. Post-war politicalposturing and heated military rivalries underscored this change, and events tookplace over the strong objections of the Navy. “As the President knows,” Secretary of the Navy Forrestal said, \"I am so opposedto the fundamental concept expressed in the message [from President Truman tocreate a Department of the Air Force] that I do not believe there is any veryhelpful observation that I could make.\" The Navy's leadership remainedunreconstructed, fearful that an independent Air Force would make a grab fornaval aviation and that the Army might even attempt to take over the MarineCorps. [97] [text00029.html#_edn97] Consequently, Forrestal had to be reassured that the Navy would remainautonomous before the Department of the Air Force was formally established onSeptember 18, 1947. The restructuring reflected peacetime agendas looking to thefuture, thus launching two mighty equals to the Department of the Navy throughthe Department of War’s successors. Soon after, the joint National MilitaryEstablishment consisting of the three departments would be renamed the UnitedStates Department of Defense in 1949.During this critical transition period resulting in the emergence of the US AirForce (USAF), the research and development of retrieved extraterrestrial craft(commonly called “flying saucers”) technologies secretly continued under theauthority of the Commanding General of the Army Air Force. On February 28,1946, Arnold left active duty (he would officially retire on June 30, 1946) andwas replaced by General Spaatz. Taking over his predecessor’s oversightresponsibilities, Spaatz took a keen interest in what Major General Curtis LeMaywas discovering as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff for Research and Development.It was LeMay who had arranged for top German scientists to be brought to WrightField to study the craft retrieved from the Cape Girardeau and Los Angelesincidents. These former Nazi German scientists helped the Air Force and DouglasAircraft scientists from Project RAND to understand the feasibility of exoticpropulsion systems based on antigravity and torsion field physics.Meanwhile, the “Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit”, which had been created withinthe Army’s Counter Intelligence Corps, would continue to investigate reports offlying saucers and endeavor to retrieve any craft that had crashed. ArmyIntelligence (G2) therefore had to cooperate with the Army Air Force in itssecret R&D efforts. The Navy, in turn, continued its research based on what hadbeen recovered in the Los Angeles incident, along with its intelligence gainedby Navy spies about the Nazi flying saucer programs. In July 1947, anotherflying saucer crash occurred, and this time, the world would learn the truth –albeit for a short time. The Truth & Cover-Up of the Roswell CrashOn a stormy July 3 night in 1947, ranchers reported hearing a loud explosionunlike the many thunderclaps taking place that evening. Among the locals was W.W. “Mac” Brazel, a foreman working on a ranch approximately 75 miles northwestof Roswell, in Lincoln County, New Mexico. The next day during Brazel’s roundson the property, he found the wreckage of what appeared to be a crashed aerialvehicle of unknown origin. On July 7, he decided to report the find to theSheriff's office, who in turn notified the nearby Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF)base which immediately sent two military intelligence officers to investigate.The result of the initial military investigation led to the famous press releaseon July 8 that a “flying saucer” had crashed. This generated instant mediainterest around the world. Escalating coverage pressured another press releaseto be issued, this time by more senior military authorities promptly claimingthe initial release was mistaken. Army Air Force brass offered the now markedlytarnished explanation; it was only a weather balloon! Backed at the time bypeople’s faith in the presiding powers, the sensation of a flying saucer fromanother world was crushed. Therefore, interest in the Roswell story collapsed,and it wasn't heard of again for another thirty years.Then in 1978, one of the two military officers that conducted the initialinvestigation, Major Jesse A. Marcel, (Ret.), formerly of the 509 th Bomb GroupIntelligence Office at the RAAF, contacted Stanton Friedman, a veteran UFOresearcher, and told him the truth about events at Roswell. According to Marcel,the crash debris contained material that was not recognizable to aviationexperts, “It was nothing we had ever seen before.” [98] [text00029.html#_edn98]It appeared indestructible, had strange hieroglyphic writing, and had otherunearthly properties. He stated for the public record: “It was not an aircraftof any kind, that I am sure of. We didn’t know what it was. It was nothing madeon this Earth.” [99] [text00029.html#_edn99]Marcel had taken some of the debris home on the way to the base to briefly showhis wife and son, Jesse Marcel Jr., who later in life authored a book about whathis father had shown him in the early morning hours of July 7. [100][text00029.html#_edn100] Marcel Jr. eventually attained the rank of colonel andbecame a medical doctor with the US Army. He agreed with his father, MajorMarcel, that the Roswell wreckage “was nothing made on this Earth”. A flyingsaucer had indeed crashed at Roswell, and Major Marcel had been ordered to takepart in an official cover-up.The subsequent publication of The Roswell Incident, by Charles Berlitz andWilliam Moore in 1980, revealed the testimony of Marcel and other first-handwitnesses, consequently bringing the Roswell story back to the public’sattention. [101] [text00029.html#_edn101] Ever since, the 1947 Roswell crash hasbeen on the center stage of public interest generating further investigations,official government and military reports, books and media notice. In 2007, animportant book was published containing a notarized affidavit by another keymilitary official involved in events at Roswell.Lieutenant Walter Haut became the Public Affairs Officer for Roswell Army AirField in 1947. He had been ordered to distribute the original July 8 pressrelease, claiming a flying saucer crash had taken place which led to globalheadlines. Haut's affidavit was written in December 2002 and authorized forrelease after his death. [102] [text00029.html#_edn102] In December of 2005, hedied, and two years later the affidavit was published as the final chapter inWitness to Roswell by Thomas Carey and Donald Schmitt. [103][text00029.html#_edn103]The affidavit exposed startling information about events occurring just beforeand after the Army’s initial press release of the flying saucer crash. The mostimportant is that a staff meeting occurred on the morning of July 8, whenRoswell Army Air Field officers discussed how to deal with the growing publicand press interest in the wreckage found at two crash sites. Haut stated: \"Themain topic of discussion ... was an extensive debris field in Lincoln Countyapprox. 75 miles NW of Roswell.\" [104] [text00029.html#_edn104] This was thecrash site on “Mac” Brazel’s ranch that Major Marcel, the Roswell base's chiefintelligence officer, traveled to investigate on July 6 and 7. Marcel gave hisreport at the meeting. The base commander, Colonel William Blanchard, also gavea brief report on wreckage found at the second site. This second site was 40miles north of Roswell, and any information on it was kept under wraps. Thus, itwas not generally known to researchers of the Roswell crash.The most surprising fact about the staff meeting is that General Roger Ramey,whose headquarters was Carswell Army Air Field, Fort Worth, Texas, was alsopresent. Haut revealed that Ramey devised a strategy for throwing the public andpress off track about the two crash sites, and stated: One of the main concerns discussed at the meeting was whether we should gopublic or not with the discovery. General Ramey proposed a plan, which Ibelieved originated from his bosses at the Pentagon [emphasis added]. Attentionneeded to be diverted from the more important site north of town byacknowledging the other location [“Mac” Brazel's ranch]. Too many civilians werealready involved and the press already was informed. [105][text00029.html#_edn105] Ramey approved a press release pointing to the more remote and less importantsite near Mac Brazel's ranch. Haut wrote in his affidavit:At approximately 9:30 am, Col Blanchard [Roswell AAF Base Commander] phoned myoffice and dictated the press release of having in our possession a flying disc,coming from a ranch northwest of Roswell, and Marcel flying the material tohigher headquarters. I was to deliver the news release to radio stations KGFLand KSWE, and newspapers, the Daily Record and the Morning Dispatch. [106][text00029.html#_edn106] Later that afternoon, General Ramey retracted the “flying disc” announcementwith the weather balloon story that appeared in news reports on the evening ofJuly 8 and the morning of July 9. This strategy succeeded in taking the flyingsaucer story off the news headlines, and confusing members of the public andpress that had witnessed or were investigating the events.General Ramey's role in the cover-up is significant. It was Ramey who orderedMajor Jesse Marcel to fly to Fort Worth to appear at a press conference. Marcelwas ordered to be photographed crouching quietly over what appeared to bematerial from a weather balloon. This was used to buttress Ramey's claim thatthe Roswell wreckage was really a misidentified common “Rawin” weather balloon. [Image00016.jpg] [Image00017.jpg]In his affidavit, Walter Haut claimed that he was taken later on July 8 to oneof the Roswell hangars by Colonel Blanchard where he saw part of the wreckagethat was relatively intact – it was about 15 feet long and 6 feet high. [107][text00029.html#_edn107] Under canvas tarpaulin, Haut also saw two bodies of thevictims with their heads sticking out, who appeared about the size of a 10-yearold child. He said that at \"a later date in Blanchard's office, he would extendhis arm about 4 feet above the floor to indicate the height.\" [108][text00029.html#_edn108]Haut's affidavit indicates that Ramey was operating under orders by thePentagon, which had been briefed about the two crash sites. It is clear thattheir staff meeting was focused on controlling the press and any public interestin the crash sites. It is highly significant that no discussion occurred oversecurity supervision at the two sites, or for the retrieval of crashed materialsfrom the second crash site. Indeed, the only information was that the secondcrash site had been witnessed by Col Blanchard, but was not known to otherRoswell Army Air Field officers before the Roswell AAF staff meeting on July 8.This is very revealing. Even given its proximity and resources, Roswell Army AirField would not play a prominent role in retrieval operations at the mysterioussecond site.Haut’s testimony divulges that security and retrieval operations at the moresecretive crash site were being supervised at a higher level, utilizingpersonnel other than the general staff at Roswell AAF. The most plausibleexplanation is that the Pentagon had deployed its own specialist teams tocontrol security and retrieval operations at the more sensitive site. However,Roswell AAF would find itself used to supply manpower and resources, primarilyto throw the public off the trail with contradictory press releases. All of thisis evidence that the investigatory team used at the second site was a highlyspecialized covert team – the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit – whose report ofthe incident was leaked over five decades later, and which I will shortlydiscuss.As to where the Roswell flying saucer debris and its occupants were taken, anumber of witnesses point to them being removed to Wright Field, now theheadquarters of the newly created Air Material Command (1946-1961). The crashsite material was subsequently transported by both air and land routes. DonSchmidt and Ken Carey interviewed multiple firsthand witnesses who were involvedwith the flight carrying debris to Wright Field: The July 8 flight was actually the second confirmed to transport debris out ofRoswell since the crash…. The second flight’s destination was Wright Field,after a brief stop at Fort Worth. Piloting the plane was Roswell’s deputy basecommander, Lt Col, Payne Jennings. [109] [text00029.html#_edn109] An eyewitness to the overland transport of the Roswell material is Lt ColonelPhilip Corso, a former US Army intelligence officer who was stationed at FortRiley, Kansas, at the time. He observed a military convoy do an overnightstopover on its way to Wright Field a few days after the crash: Whatever they’d crated this way, it was a coffin, but not like any coffin I’dseen before. The contents, enclosed in a thick glass container, were submergedin a thick light blue liquid … the object was floating, actually suspended, andnot sitting on the bottom with a fluid over top, and it was soft and shiny asthe underbelly of a fish. At first I thought it was a dead child they wereshipping somewhere. But this was no child. It was a four-foot human-shapedfigure with arms … thin legs and feet, and an oversized incandescent lightbulb-shaped head that looked like it was floating over a balloon gondola for achin….I looked through the crate encasing the container of liquid for any paperwork orshipping invoice or anything that would describe the nature or origin of thisthing. What I found was an intriguing Army Intelligence document describing thecreature as an inhabitant of a craft that had crash landed in Roswell, NewMexico, earlier that week and a routing manifest for this creature to the loginofficer at the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field … [110][text00029.html#_edn110] Corso’s military records show he was stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, from April21, 1947, to May 12, 1950, with the rank of Major. [111][text00029.html#_edn111] Events he described as the duty officer on the nightthe extraterrestrial body arrived at Fort Riley en route to Wright Patterson AFBare, therefore, corroborated by his military record. Further testimonysupporting Corso’s account comes from Leonard Stringfield. He was the first UFOcrash retrieval researcher to investigate this incident, and he was told thatthe extraterrestrial bodies found at Roswell were taken to Building 18F atWright Patterson and kept in a “holding tank” for a period of time. [112][text00029.html#_edn112]Another source confirming Corso’s description of events is the former US ArmySignals Corps officer, known by the two pseudonyms “Kewper” and “Stein”, who wasrecruited to work with a covert CIA unit from 1957 to 1960. As an agent with theCIA unit, he tracked reports of UFO crashes and sightings around the world, andstated in an interview: We were told that the original debris for a short period of time was at theRoswell Army Air Field. From there, it went to Fort Riley, Kansas, where it wasfor a week. The government was trying to figure out what to do with it and wherebest to work on such a classified object. It was wrapped up on a truck undercamouflage, so no one would know what it was.And then it went to Ohio to Wright Field outside of Dayton, Ohio (becameWright-Patterson AFB). It was there for about a year and some of the scientistsfrom the area the government brought in to look at. [113][text00029.html#_edn113] Due to the multiple first-hand witness accounts of events at Roswell, includingthe primary military officials involved in reporting and covering up key facts,it can be concluded that an extraterrestrial craft had indeed crashed, and theinitial newspaper report was correct. Interplanetary visitors had visited theEarth, and the Army Air Force had ordered a cover-up at the highest levels.One may wonder why an extraterrestrial intelligence would choose New Mexico inwhich to perform some type of clandestine surveillance or reconnaissance. Whywere they there? The simplest answer is that in 1947, Roswell Army Air Field wasthe home of the 509 th Bomb Group. The 509 th was the bomb group that releasedthe atom bombs on Japan in 1945. Roswell was the only atomic bomber base in theworld. New Mexico was also the location of White Sands Proving Grounds and theLos Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) where the atomic bomb was originallydeveloped and then tested at Trinity Site. We can get more answers to thesequestions and learn more details about what happened at Roswell, along with thesubsequent Army Air Force efforts to study the retrieved craft, from a number ofthe Majestic Documents.Majestic Documents on the Roswell CrashImmediately after the 1947 events at Roswell, the Commander of the Air MaterialCommand, Lt General Nathan F. Twining, received two virtually identical “TopSecret Eyes Only” directives. One was from the Army Chief of Staff Dwight D.Eisenhower and another from President Truman, consecutively on July 8 and 9,instructing Twining to travel to White Sands Proving Ground to oversee therecovery efforts of the Roswell crashes. [114] [text00029.html#_edn114] Truman’s“Directive to General Twining” states: You will proceed to the White Sands Proving Ground Command Center without delayfor the purpose of making an appraisal of the reported unidentified objectsbeing kept there. Part of your mission there will deal with the military,political and psychological situations current and projected. In the course ofyour survey you will maintain liaison with the military officials in the area….You will take with you such experts, technicians, scientists and assistants asyou deem necessary to the effectiveness of your mission. [115][text00029.html#_edn115] Upon completing his mission, General Twining wrote a report on July 16, 1947,titled: “Air Accident Report on ‘Flying Disc’ Aircraft Near the White SandsProving Ground, New Mexico” to the Commanding General of the Army Air Force CarlSpaatz which was classified Top Secret. In this report, Twining detailed therole of the scientific personnel he brought with him from Wright Field thatconducted the preliminary investigation of the material retrieved from the twoflying saucer crash sites: 1. As ordered by Presidential Directive, dated 9 July 1947, a preliminaryinvestigation of a recovered “Flying Disc” and remains of a possible seconddisc, was conducted by the senior staff of this command. The data furnished inthis report was provided by the engineering staff personnel of T-2 and AircraftLaboratory, Engineering Division T-3. Additional data was supplied by thescientific personnel of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, CIT [California Instituteof Technology] and the Army Air Forces Scientific Advisory Group, headed by Dr.Theodore von Karman. Further analysis was conducted by personnel from Researchand Development. [116] [text00029.html#_edn116] Next, the initial analysis given by his scientific team about the retrievedcraft confirms that it came from outside the United States: It is the collective view of this investigative body, that the aircraftrecovered by the Army and Air Force units near Victoria Peak and Socorro, NewMexico, are not of US manufacture… [117] [text00029.html#_edn117] The report goes on to explain the reasons why the craft is not of U.S., German,or Russian origin, and further describes its unique propulsion, navigation, andpiloting features. Significantly, Twining’s report states: The absence of canopy, observation windows/blisters, or any optical projection,lends support to the opinion that this craft is either guided by remote viewingor is remotely controlled. [118] [text00029.html#_edn118] Only three pages of the “Air Accident Report” were leaked, so it is unknown whatfinal conclusions were reached. One thing is clear though from the analysis: theretrieved craft was of a highly advanced design and would require years ofresearch and development efforts by specialists at the Air Material Command.Dr. Robert Wood and Ryan Wood have categorized the two Twining Directives as“Medium Level of Authenticity”. [119] [text00029.html#_edn119] They gave the AirAccident Report a higher ranking of “Medium to High Level of Authenticity”. Anofficially declassified Air Force document further supports the authenticity ofall three leaked documents concerning Nathan Twining and the Air MaterialCommand investigation. On September 23, 1947, General Twining wrote a memorandumto Brigadier General George Schulgen on the extraterrestrial craft which wasclassified Secret. Twining told Schulgen: a. The phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious. b. There are objects probably approximating the shape of a disc, of suchappreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made aircraft…d. The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb,maneuverability (particularly in roll), and motion which must be consideredevasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief tothe possibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually,automatically or remotely. [120] [text00029.html#_edn120] The reference to the recovered craft being “controlled either manually,automatically or remotely” is very similar to the conclusion reached in theleaked “Air Accident Report” where Twining referred to the craft as being“guided by remote viewing or is remotely controlled”. [121][text00029.html#_edn121] Consequently, the officially declassified September 23Memorandum to Schulgen leaves little doubt about the authenticity of the leakedSeptember 16 “Air Accident Report”, and substantiates the September 8 andSeptember 9 directives sent to Twining by General Eisenhower and PresidentTruman.While Twining’s September 23 “Schulgen Memo” did not specifically mention theRoswell crash, which was classified “Top Secret Eyes Only”, it shows that he wasmaking subordinates aware of the reality of UFOs and the need to study reportedsightings made by the general public in order to better understand their“non-domestic” origins. [122] [text00029.html#_edn122] So far, the contents ofthe documents presented focus upon the technical aspects of the craftthemselves, and do not refer to the recovery of extraterrestrial beings. Areport by the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, however, does refer to therecovery of extraterrestrial bodies at one of the sites associated with theRoswell crash.The report is titled “Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Summary” and is categorizedas “Medium-High Level of Authenticity” by the Woods. [123][text00029.html#_edn123] The IPU Report begins: 1. The extraordinary recovery of fallen airborne objects in the state of New Mexico, between 4 July – 6 July 1947: This Summary was prepared by Headquarters Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit. Scientific and Technical Branch, Counterintelligence Directorate, … at the expressed order of Chief of Staff. [124] [text00029.html#_edn124]It is worth noting that Eisenhower was the Army Chief of Staff at the time. Thereport goes on to describe materials in two location sites, which corroborateswhat Lieutenant Haut and other witnesses were told: 2… Two crash sites have been located close to the WSPG [White Sands ProvingGrounds] Site LZ-1 was located at a ranch near Corona, approx. 75 milesnorthwest of the town of Roswell [the crash site reported by Brazel]. Site LZ-2was located approx. 20 miles southwest of the town of Socorro, at Lat. 33-40-31,Long 106-28-29, with Oscura Peak being the geographic reference point.3. The AST personnel were mainly interested in LZ-2 as this site contained themajority of structural detail of the craft’s airframe, propulsion and navigationtechnology. The recovery of fives bodies in a damaged escape cylinder, precludedan investigation at LZ-1.4. On arrival at LZ-2, personnel assessed the finds as not belonging to anyaircraft, rocket, weapons, or balloon test that are normally conducted fromsurrounding bases. [125] [text00029.html#_edn125] This data is consistent with the conclusion in General Twining’s “Air AccidentReport” that the crashed craft was not of “U.S. manufacture”. [126][text00029.html#_edn126] The IPU report also describes how the debris and bodieswere taken to Wright Field, and other secure Air Force facilities for closerstudy: 7. … CIC [Counter Intelligence Corps] member of the team was able to learn thatseveral bodies were taken to the hospital at Roswell AAF and others to eitherLos Alamos, Wright Field, Patterson AAF, and Randolph Field for securityreasons…. Remains of the powerplant were taken to Alamogordo AAF and KirtlandAAF. Structural debris and assorted parts were taken to AMC [Air MaterialCommand] Wright Field. [127] [text00029.html#_edn127] Another significant Majestic document concerns a two-page, July 18, 1947,memorandum from Lt General Twining to Major General Curtis LeMay on the creationof a new laboratory at Wright Field, only two weeks after the Roswell crash. Thememorandum is categorized as “Medium-High Level of Authenticity” by the Woods.[128] [text00029.html#_edn128] Here is how they summarize its contents andsignificance: This two page memo from Lt General Nathan Twining to Curtis LeMay activates anew laboratory to conduct meteorological research and development and upper airresearch with the Electronics Subdivision of the Engineering Division of theAMC. It states in part, \"In view of the close relationship and interdependenceof research in meteorology and research in electromagnetic compressional wavepropagation, action is being taken to reorganize the present Applied PropagationLaboratory of Watson laboratories in the Atmospheric Laboratory, and expand itsfunctions to include research and development in meteorology and relatedgeophysical fields.\" Later the memo goes on to state that \"funds requested forF.Y. 1949 Project 680-11, Atmospheric Research and applied scientific researchof the upper atmosphere, a total sum of $6,000,000 has been specified…\" What ahuge sum of money in 1949 to study the \"upper atmosphere;\" a more logicalinterpretation is that we are analyzing flying saucers, their technology, whythey are here, and what are we going to do about it. [129][text00029.html#_edn129] The Twining-LeMay memorandum shows how the Army Air Force, two months before theofficial creation of the USAF, had set up a new laboratory at Wright Field tostudy artifacts from the Roswell crash. The memorandum is documentary evidenceidentifying that Twining and LeMay were directly involved in the secret researchand development of the advanced technologies found in the Roswell crash. It isimportant here to keep in mind that Twining was the commander of Air MaterialCommand headquartered at Wright Field, and LeMay was Deputy Chief of Air Stafffor Research and Development. Therefore, the memorandum confirms that the ArmyAir Force was moving into high gear in its secret study of the craft retrievedfrom Roswell.Roswell Event Leads to MAJICRoswell was the decisive catalyst for the US government to finally take steps tocoordinate military and intelligence efforts to get to the bottom of the UFOphenomenon. Previously, the Army’s Counter Intelligence Corps (through itsInterplanetary Phenomenon Unit), the Navy’s Office of Naval Intelligence(through its espionage program out of Naval Air Station San Diego), and the ArmyAir Force’s research and development efforts at Wright Field were all separatemilitary endeavors to understand the UFO phenomenon after its emergence with the1941 Cape Girardeau and 1942 Los Angeles events. However, by mid-1947, the Army,Navy, and Air Force were competing military services vying for control andfunding resources over the UFO phenomenon and the revolutionary potential itheld for future combat operations. Effectively, there was no comprehensivegovernment oversight or coordination for what the military services wereindividually doing.To recap, Lt General Nathen Twining was ordered by General Eisenhower (July 8)and President Truman (July 9) to lead an Army Air Force investigation of theRoswell incident. After writing the “Air Accident Report” describing thetechnical aspects of the retrieved craft (on July 16), Twining then orderedMajor General LeMay to set up a new laboratory at Wright Field (on July 18).Next, Twining would lead a comprehensive interdepartmental investigation intothe intelligence, technical, scientific, political, and national securityimplications of the recovered Roswell artifacts. On this front, the documenttrail continues with Twining’s “White Hot Report”, dated September 19, 1947, (aday after the official creation of the USAF), which has notably been given thehighest of authenticity ratings by the Wood team for a leaked Majestic document.Consequently, the Twining “White Hot Report” provides stunning insights into thethinking within the Truman White House and the newly created Department ofDefense on how to deal with the recovered crash artifacts, which were understoodby US authorities to be extraterrestrial in origin. Here’s how Twining’s team,comprised of sixteen leading scientists, national security experts, and seniormilitary officers, summarized the national security situation shortly after theRoswell incident: In the early months of 1942 [LA incident], up until the present, intrusions ofunidentified aircraft have occasionally been documented, but there has been noserious investigations by the intelligence arm of the Government. Even therecovery case of 1941 did not create a unified intelligence effort to exploitpossible technological gains with the exception of the Manhattan Project. We nowhave an opportunity to extend our technology beyond the threshold that we haveachieved, by directly working with the aliens on technology transfer [boldedsection was blacked out in original and has been reconstructed]. Aside fromtechnological gains, we face an even greater challenge, that of learning theintent of such a presence. There are questions that remain unanswered …. [130][text00029.html#_edn130] In this report, Twining’s team identifies the national security challengesinvolved in establishing a future working relationship with extraterrestrials inorder to achieve significant technological advances. The overwhelming scope ofthe challenges posed in researching and developing extraterrestrial technologiesled to Twining’s team recommending a comprehensive strategic plan: The members of the mission are prepared to submit a … dozen volumes to explainhow these problems should be met. Our only point, however, is that a combinedintelligence and research operation would be vast, intricate, covertly plannedmarshalling of resources, human and material, to solve a specific, clearlydefined problem.We have to find effective methods of persuasion with other government agencieswithout creating a sense of impending doom. The first task is to carefullyappraise the problem. The second is to evaluate the known resources and probablestrategy of the visitors. The third is to inventory our own ways and means,ascertain how many resources we can bring to bear, and how fast. The fourth isto devise our strategic plan. And last is to work out with infinite pains thetactical details and the myriad of secondary problems of funding and security.[131] [text00029.html#_edn131] The “White Hot Report” now makes it clear why the Army Air Force had initiallydecided to fund Project RAND and work with civilians in developing strategicplanning on advanced technology projects and extraterrestrial life. In contrastto the wartime Los Angeles incident, the Roswell Crash served as the necessarycatalyst to launch serious research and development efforts into UFOtechnologies.Twining’s team went on to recommend the establishment of a permanent committeeto deal with the myriad of anticipated national security problems that couldarise while researching and developing extraterrestrial technologies: It is the unanimous opinion of the members that Operation MAJESTIC TWELVE be afully funded and operation TOP SECRET Research and Development intelligencegathering agency. It is also recommended that a panel of experts be appointed tochair and oversee the functions and operations of said agency. [132][text00029.html#_edn132] The seriousness with which the recommendations made by Twining’sinterdepartmental team were taken is reflected in what happened five days afterthe report was issued. On September 24, 1947, President Truman issued aMemorandum to James Forrestal, the first Secretary of Defense, authorizing“Operation Majestic Twelve”: Dear Secretary ForrestalAs per our recent conversation on this matter, you are hereby authorized toproceed with all due speed and caution upon your undertaking. Hereafter thismatter shall be referred to only as Operation Majestic Twelve. [133][text00029.html#_edn133] It’s important to note that Twining’s “White Hot Report” was classified “MAJICEyes Only”. The Woods point out that “MAJIC” is an acronym for “MilitaryAssessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee”, the code word coined by theJoint Intelligence Committee which was making recommendations to the presidenton the extraterrestrial issue. [134] [text00029.html#_edn134] Consequently, whenJoint Intelligence Committee members recommended setting up “Operation MajesticTwelve”, they were both naming their successor committee “Majestic 12”, andformalizing the number of officials that would sit on the new committee.Meanwhile, the “MAJIC” code word would be used as a security classification forthe Majestic 12 committee running Operation Majestic Twelve. This brief historyhelps explain why the term “MAJIC” appears in a number of Majestic documents asboth a security code word and also as the name of the group running OperationMajestic Twelve.The twelve founding members of the Committee are described in the famous“Eisenhower Briefing Document”, which is another leaked Majestic document. It isthe alleged written briefing given to President Eisenhower on November 18, 1952,less than two weeks after his election. The “Eisenhower Briefing Document” namesthe principal military and scientific figures involved with theUFO/extraterrestrial issue, and identifies the Majestic 12 (MAJIC-12) Group asthe main organization set up to manage the issue. This group comprised some ofthe most powerful figures of the day in the US national security apparatus. Theyhad been reporting directly to the Office of the President as of September 24,1947, just as the Truman Memorandum, which was included as an attachment, hadstipulated: OPERATION MAJESTIC-12 is a TOP SECRET Research and Development/Intelligenceoperation responsible directly and only to the President of the United States.Operations of the project are carried out under the control of the Majestic-12(Majic-12) Group which was established by special classified executive order ofPresident Truman on 24 September, 1947, upon recommendation by Dr. Vannevar Bushand Secretary James Forrestal. (See Attachment \"A\".) Members of the Majestic-12Group were designated as follows:Adm. Roscoe H. HillenkoetterDr. Vannevar BushSecy. James V. ForrestalGen. Nathan F. TwiningGen. Hoyt S. VandenbergDr. Detlev BronkDr. Jerome HunsakerMr. Sidney W. SouersMr. Gordon GrayDr. Donald MenzelGen. Robert M. MontagueDr. Lloyd V. Berkner [Image00018.jpg]Figure 13. Eisenhower Briefing Document, p. 2. The Majestic Documents Veteran UFO researcher Stanton Friedman’s groundbreaking study of the EisenhowerBriefing Document uncovered a wealth of evidence that corroborated thedesignated list of names and the existence of the Majestic 12 (MJ-12) Group. Asfar as the names are concerned, Friedman found that the 12 figures involved wereeminently suited for being on the notable committee that would control theentire UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon. Coincidentally, the “Eisenhower BriefingDocument” was released only three months after the last surviving member of theoriginal group, Dr. Jerome C. Hunsaker, had died (September 10, 1984). This isnot an insignificant coincidence and hints at some prior agreement over thepublic release of such information.The MJ-12 Group was predictably divided up in its membership between thedifferent military services, the scientific community and members of theintelligence community. After conducting a detailed analysis of each of thosenamed, Friedman concluded: There were close links within this group of very important people. Consideringwhat was happening in America and around the world post-World War II, they werea natural group to be on a committee such as Majestic 12. Either by aptitude,position, or geographic location, their inclusion would be fairly obvious. [135][text00029.html#_edn135]"},{"pageContent":"[Image00019.jpg]Figure 14. Initial Members of Majestic 12 Group The best evidence supporting the existence of Operation Majestic Twelve is amemorandum retrieved from the National Archives by Friedman, who only found itafter receiving a tip-off. Issued on July 14, 1954, this Top Secret Memorandumsent by Robert Cutler, a Special Assistant to President Eisenhower, was issuedto General Nathan Twining (a member of MJ-12 at the time). The “Top SecretRestricted Security” Memorandum stated: The President has decided that the MJ-12 SSP briefing should take place duringthe already scheduled White House meeting of July 16, rather than following itas previously intended. [136] [text00029.html#_edn136] The subject line of the Memorandum reads “NSC/MJ-12 Special Studies Project”.Unlike other Majestic documents still under investigation, the Cutler-Twiningmemo is an official government document that had been declassified from TopSecret and housed at the National Archives. It was found among a group ofdeclassified Air Force documents and copied by the archivist Ed Reese as part ofofficial records belonging to the National Archives. [137][text00029.html#_edn137] The Cutler-Twining memo is among the most authoritativedocumentary sources so far for the existence of the MJ-12 Special StudiesProject. [138] [text00029.html#_edn138]Two of the original members of the Majestic 12 Group were Generals HoytVandenberg and Nathan Twining, who would respectively succeed General CarlSpaatz as the USAF Chief of Staff. Vandenberg and Twining’s inclusions mean thatthe USAF was closely involved in managing extraterrestrial and relatedtechnology issues from the very beginning. Twining, in particular, oversawresearch and development efforts which by necessity involved the Air MaterialCommand. Civilian organizations such as Project RAND provided the necessaryscientific and management skills not only for developing a long-term strategicplan for the Air Force to deal with the multiple problems identified by Twiningin his White Hot Report, but also the eventual building of fleets of antigravitycraft that would be reverse-engineered from the captured extraterrestrialtechnologies. This latter goal had immediate consequences for Project RAND andits relationship with the Douglas Aircraft Company.

This is how the RAND Corporationwebsite explains what happened:By late 1947, it seemed as though Project RAND — which was already operatingfairly autonomously — should consider separating from Douglas. In February 1948,the Chief of Staff [Carl A. Spaatz] of the newly created United States Air Forcewrote a letter to the president of the Douglas Aircraft Company that approvedthe evolution of Project RAND into a nonprofit corporation, independent ofDouglas. [139] [text00029.html#_edn139] The RAND Corporation was officially created on May 14, 1948, marking its formalparting from Douglas. Historians describe the separation as amicable due to theinherent challenges the USAF had encountered while funding an ‘impartial’ thinktank inside a major aviation company: Although nominally autonomous, Project RAND had come to be seen as an appendageof Douglas. After awhile, RAND found it difficult to obtain detailed informationfrom Air Force contractors to prepare analyses of defense problems sincecontractors were wary of supplying confidential proprietary information thatmight be leaked to a competitor. Moreover, many analysts were reluctant to beassociated with RAND, believing that RAND could not really be objective as longas it was under Douglas sponsorship.For its part, Douglas Aircraft saw RAND as a growth choking the life of theparent body. Since the Air Force was going out of its way to avoid even theimpression of favoritism, Douglas executives felt the company’s association withthe think tank was hurting Douglas’s chances of landing lucrative contracts.Even the Air Force was unhappy, frustrated that the millions of dollars it wasspending on Project RAND were not bearing the desired results because of theseconflicts. [140] [text00029.html#_edn140] According to William Tompkins, the separation was not as smooth a transition asthe RAND website and historians depicted, which overlooked the tensions andanimosities of employees forced to choose between the two entities. In aninterview, Tompkins said that roughly two-thirds of the approximately twohundred personnel working in Project RAND moved over to the Santa Monicafacility housing the newly created RAND Corporation. The other one thirdremained with Douglas at its own still highly classified engineering facility inSanta Monica. [141] [text00029.html#_edn141]This remnant of Project RAND that stayed with Douglas came to form the secretthink tank “Advanced Design”, which Tompkins began working for in early 1951after joining Douglas only months before in late 1950. Tompkins learnedfirsthand in 1951 that antigravity projects continued to be secretly studied byDouglas scientists and engineers in its classified think tank, through fundingnow secretly supplied by the US Navy. [142] [text00029.html#_edn142] At thesame time, the RAND Corporation was exclusively funded by the US Air Force tostudy advanced aerospace concepts. [143] [text00029.html#_edn143]Tompkins’ claims are supported by official Douglas Aircraft Company documentsshowing that antigravity and other exotic propulsion systems were indeed beingstudied. These documents show how Tompkins’ bosses within “Advanced Design” weredirectly involved. One document by Dr. Wolfgang B. Klemperer (Tompkins’immediate supervisor), dated March 1, 1955, to Elmer Wheaton, vice president ofDouglas Engineering, has as its subject line, “UNCONVENTIONAL PROPULSIONSCHEMES”, and states: Our studies of the possible merits or significance of occasionally appearingpublications concerning Unconventional Propulsion Schemes have been casuallycontinued since writing the first memorandum (MTM-622) about their progress tomid December 1954.Between that time and the end of February 1955, twenty more papers on pertinenttopics have been obtained and read. They are reviewed in the appendedAstronautical Literature Review …Several more occasions were had to talk personally to people about the subject.Two of such interviews are abstracted … We have also looked at a few typical“Flying Saucer” books but found none of them of technical significance thus far.Brief reviews of six of them are appended. [144] [text00029.html#_edn144] Further Douglas Aircraft Company documents supplied by Tompkins clearlydemonstrate that Dr. Klemperer was conducting a systematic study ofunconventional propulsion systems including antigravity. [145][text00029.html#_edn145] Prior to these Advance Design antigravity feasibilitystudies, Klemperer was one of the Douglas scientists that worked in ProjectRAND, and, in fact, authored three of the papers that were included in the 1946Project RAND study, “Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-CirclingSpaceship.” [146] [text00029.html#_edn146] [Image00021.jpg]Figure 16. Dr. Klemperer letter on ”Unconventional Propulsion” It’s important to analyze the role of Dr. Klemperer with Douglas during the timeof the aircraft company’s efforts to understand exotic propulsion systemsincluding antigravity, and how it adopted these for aerospace projects on behalfof the US Army, Air Force, and the Navy. Klemperer was an Austrian national whohad been raised in Dresden, Germany. [147] [text00029.html#_edn147] He graduatedfrom the Dresden University of Technology in 1920 and got his first job at theAachen Institute of Aerodynamics where he stayed for two years as an assistantto Professor Theodore von Kárman. Notably, von Kárman later emigrated to theU.S. in 1930 to work at the California Institute of Technology and became aprominent member of Army Air Force/USAF efforts to study captured German andextraterrestrial aerospace technologies. Von Kárman’s brilliance led to himco-founding the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1944, and to him becoming General“Hap” Arnold’s principal scientific advisor during World War II. According tothe “White Hot Report,” Professor von Kárman was later part of the scientificgroup that Twining sent to investigate the debris from the Roswell crash.Klemperer’s connection to von Kárman is worth remembering. Next, Klempererworked at Luftschiffbau Zeppelin from 1922 to 1924, where he headed research inthe design and construction of Zeppelin-designed dirigibles. After earning hisdoctorate in engineering from Aachen, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1924 to accepta position at the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation of Akron, Ohio. Klemperer wasimmediately involved in designing two large Zeppelins for the US Navy based onthe designs pioneered in Germany. The Navy contract was for 8 million dollars,which in 2018 terms is an impressive 1.78 billion dollars. [148][text00029.html#_edn148] The first of the two airships, the USS Akron , had aflight crew of 10 officers and 50 enlisted men, plus a heavier-than-air group offour officers and 15 airplane mechanics. It also housed an airplane complementof up to four Curtiss F9C-2 \"Sparrowhawk\" fighters, launched and recovered via amechanical trapeze extended below the airship's hangar compartment. [149][text00029.html#_edn149] [Image00022.jpg]Figure 17. U.S. Naval Historical Center drawing The building of the USS Akron began on October 31, 1929, and was completed onAugust 1931. Construction of its sister ship, the USS Macon , began in 1933 andwas completed in 1935. Both the USS Akron and the USS Macon were prototypeflying aircraft carriers that actually were put into service for the Navy. Theywere the largest helium-filled airships ever built and provided an unprecedentedprojection of Naval airpower. Unfortunately, the service life of both was cutshort due to them crashing during storms: the Akron in 1933 and the Macon in1935. As a result of this setback and a decision by the Navy not to buildfurther Zeppelins, Klemperer decided to move to Douglas Aircraft Company in1936.Klemperer’s pre-World War II work in designing and building flying aircraftcarriers, along with his documented interest in antigravity, substantiatesTompkins’ claims that the Douglas Aircraft Company was secretly involved in the1950’s and early 1960’s in designing space carriers for the US Navy. Therelationship between the Navy and Douglas over this pursuit is described ingreat detail in Tompkins’ autobiography, Selected by Extraterrestrials , and inbook two of this Secret Space Program series, The U.S. Navy’s Secret SpaceProgram & Nordic Extraterrestrial Alliance .Significantly, I found no evidence that the Navy’s incipient space program wasassociated with the Majestic 12 Group. While Navy admirals were involved withMajestic 12 from its inception, along with MJ-12 efforts to understand andmanage problems associated with extraterrestrial life and technology, this stilldid not translate into these admirals apprising other Majestic members of whatthe Navy was doing. On the surface, this may appear to have been a product ofresentment over the Navy being institutionally sidelined by both the Rooseveltand Truman administrations from leading the research and development effortsover captured extraterrestrial technologies. It’s a historical fact that theNavy was strongly opposed to the creation of the Department of the Air Force,and therefore, would not have been pleased with the primacy Truman had assignedto his newly created military department in managing the extraterrestrialphenomenon immediately after the Roswell crash.However, there is another more compelling explanation for why the Navy’s buddingspace program was researched, designed, and built entirely outside of thepurview of the Majestic 12 Group. during Operation Highjump in early 1947, theNavy had suffered a devastating defeat in Antarctica at the hands of the spaceprogram established there by “German Secret Societies”, which I discussed atlength in book three of this series, Antarctica’s Hidden History and CorporateFoundations of Secret Space Programs . The Navy best understood the long-termstrategic threat posed by the German breakaway colony in Antarctica, and itsstunning technological advances due to an alliance it had formed with anextraterrestrial race called the Draconians. During WWII, the Navy had learnedabout this world-altering alliance through one of its key espionage programs —the same one in which William Tompkins had participated. [150][text00029.html#_edn150]The technological benefits of establishing an alliance with extraterrestrialswere acknowledged as an important requirement in Twining’s September 19, 1947,“White Hot Report” of the Roswell crash. In this document, he referred to“directly working with the aliens on technology transfer”. [151][text00029.html#_edn151] This specific phrase was redacted (i.e., blackened out)in the leaked version of the report, however, Dr. Robert Wood and Ryan Wood wereable to reconstruct it forensically. The imperative for establishing futureagreements with extraterrestrials was highly restricted, as the redacted lineindicates, to only the most senior officials at the time. The responsibility forestablishing such an agreement with extraterrestrials would fall to thestrategic planning group called for in Twining’s report, which was thenestablished five days later with President Truman’s September 24, 1947,Memorandum – “the Majestic 12 Group”.Consequently, since the Navy knew that agreements would have to be reached withextraterrestrials and an accommodation eventually reached with the breakawayGerman Antarctic colony, it’s understandable why the Navy chose not to share itslong-term strategic plan to research and develop future space battle groups withthe Majestic 12 Group. After all, the Navy knew that MJ-12 had been set up tomanage extraterrestrial life and technology issues on behalf of the Trumanadministration. MJ-12 was tasked with the responsibility to find a solution tothe expanding German space program in Antarctica. The less Majestic 12 knewabout what the Navy was doing at its research facilities, the less likely theGermans and their extraterrestrial allies would learn about it and plan toinfiltrate and sabotage such efforts. Consequently, whether due to lingeringresentment, institutional jealousy or out of strategic necessity, the Navy wouldsecretly continue its separate research and development of capturedextraterrestrial technologies using the Douglas Aircraft Company and otherclassified research facilities.Perhaps not so ironically, while the US Navy continued to secretly work withDouglas’ Project RAND replacement, Advanced Design, in creating future fleets ofspace carriers, the US Air Force instead employed Douglas’ offshoot, the RANDCorporation. Since RAND was involved in the study of the retrievedextraterrestrial artifacts and bodies from the Roswell incident, as Twining’s“White Hot Report” outlined, the RAND Corporation’s principal task ahead was tocome up with a long-term strategic plan to solve the myriad of problems posed byextraterrestrial life and technologies. On this front, one of the immediateproblems faced by the US Air Force and the Majestic 12 Group was how to dealwith the increasing number of overflights of United States airspace by bothextraterrestrial and Antarctic German spacecraft."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6 The German Connection to UFO’s over the United States Never in history have lies been such vital instruments of diplomacy and policy.–Max Hastings, former war correspondent and military historianFlying Saucers from AntarcticaI n March 1947, Rear Admiral Richard Byrd gave an interview in Santiago, Chile,about his recently terminated “Operation Highjump” mission. At the time, he wastraveling back to the United States to debrief his superiors about what had justtaken place during that deployment in Antarctica. Byrd’s statements included asobering portent of an imminent danger looming for the United States. Thejournalist, Lee Van Atta, quoted Byrd extensively in an article that appeared inthe March 5, 1947, edition of El Mercurio with the title, “Admiral Richard E.Byrd refers to the strategic importance of the poles”. What follows aretranslated passages from the original Spanish release: Admiral Richard E Byrd warned today of the necessity for the United States toadopt protective measures against the possibility of an invasion of the countryby hostile aircraft proceeding from the polar regions. The admiral said: 'I donot want to scare anybody but the bitter reality is that in the event of a newwar, the United States will be attacked by aircraft flying in from over one orboth poles. '” [152] [text00029.html#_edn152] This specific passage is the source of the original theory that proposed theSouth and North poles were the locations where an unknown enemy existed, capableof initiating a “new war” against the United States. The reference to a “newwar” clearly indicates that the entity involved was both hostile and powerfulsince it could directly threaten mainland America with advanced aircraftlaunched from the South Pole. Van Atta continued: On the subject of the recently terminated expedition, Byrd said that 'the mostimportant of the observations and discoveries made [were] … of the presentpotential situation as it relates to the security of the United States ... I cando no more than warn my countrymen very forcibly that the time has passed whenwe could take refuge in complete isolation and rest in confidence in theguarantee of security which distance, the oceans and the poles provide.’' [153][text00029.html#_edn153] Here, Byrd is suggesting that the unknown enemy possessed advanced aerial craftwhose speed and range removed the protection previously enjoyed by the U.S. interms of the vast oceans separating it from Europe and Asia. [Image00023.jpg]Figure 18. Lee Van Atta article on Operation Highjump In my book, Antarctica’s Hidden History: Corporate Foundations of Secret SpacePrograms, I presented evidence that Byrd’s Operation Highjump had been dealt astunning blow by the breakaway German colony in Antarctica, which hadsuccessfully weaponized its advanced flying saucer craft. [154][text00029.html#_edn154] Operation Paperclip, which arranged for the entry ofNazi scientists and technologies into the U.S., had only succeeded in retrievingthe unsuccessful flying saucer prototypes that the Germans had abandoned intheir retreat to Antarctica. The Germans had given the Navy a bloody nose inAntarctica, and now it would be the Army Air Force’s turn as the Germans beganoverflights of US territory, which is the threat Byrd was alluding to in hisinterview.Only a few months after Admiral Byrd’s interview with the Chilean press, thefamous Kenneth Arnold UFO incident occurred. On June 24, 1947, Arnold witnessednine flying wing-shaped craft over the Cascade Mountains of Oregon andWashington State. In a letter to the Army Air Force, Arnold described what hehad witnessed: The sky and air was clear as crystal. I hadn't flown more than two or threeminutes on my course when a bright flash reflected on my airplane. It startledme as I thought I was too close to some other aircraft. I looked every place inthe sky and couldn't find where the reflection had come from until I looked tothe left and the north of Mt. Rainier where I observed a chain of nine peculiarlooking aircraft flying from north to south at approximately a 9,500 footelevation and going, seemingly, in a definite direction of about 170 degrees. They were approaching Mt. Rainier very rapidly, and I merely assumed theywere jet planes. Anyhow, I discovered that this was where the reflection hadcome from, as two or three of them every few seconds would dip or change theircourse slightly, just enough for the sun to strike them at an angle thatreflected brightly on my plane. These objects being quite far away, I was unable for a few seconds to makeout their shape or their formation. Very shortly they approached Mt. Rainier,and I observed their outline against the snow quite plainly. I thought it was very peculiar that I couldn't find their tails butassumed they were some type of jet plane. I was determined to clock their speed,as I had two definite points I could clock them by; the air was so clear that itwas very easy to see objects and determine their approximate shape and size atalmost fifty miles that day….These objects were holding an almost constant elevation; they did not seem to begoing up or coming down, such as would be the case of rockets or artilleryshells. I am convinced in my own mind that they were some type of airplane, eventhough they didn't conform with the many aspects of the conventional type ofplanes that I know….Some descriptions could not be very accurate taken from the ground unless thesesaucer-like disks were at a great height and there is a possibility that all ofthe people who observed peculiar objects could have seen the same thing I did …[155] [text00029.html#_edn155] Arnold’s observation of the nine craft flying in formation indicates that theywere not experimental jet aircraft being tested by the US military. Suchclassified tests of experimental aircraft involved one, or at most two,prototypes being simultaneously evaluated, not nine flying in formation. BenRich best explains the construction and testing of experimental aircraft in hisbook, Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed . [156][text00029.html#_edn156] Rich’s book makes it clear that what Arnold hadwitnessed was not experimental craft undergoing testing, but a squadronperforming a mission. The question that arises is to who did the flyingwing-shaped craft belong?Arnold’s description of the flying “saucer-like disks” bears a remarkablelikeness to a unique jet aircraft developed for Nazi Germany by two brothers,Reimar and Walter Horten – the Horten Ho 229. The revolutionary design of thisflying wing aircraft was used decades later in the construction of the B-2Spirit stealth bomber. [157] [text00029.html#_edn157] One of the Ho 229’sprototypes, a V3, had been relocated to the U.S. after World War II for study.Today it can be found in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum’srestoration facility. When the Air Force began its investigation of flyingsaucer reports, the similarities in the design and flight performance of the Ho229 with what witnesses had sighted, was officially acknowledged. [158][text00029.html#_edn158] The similarities between the Ho 229 and what Arnold hadseen leads to the following conclusion: while only two Ho 229 V3 prototypes wereknown to have been officially built, more successful prototypes were secretlydeveloped either by the Hortens or other German aviation engineers and moved toAntarctica. It was these more advanced German flying wing craft that wereoverflying U.S. territory in squadron formation by 1947. [Image00024.jpg]Figure 19. Comparison: UFO drawing by Kenneth /Photo of Horton Flying Wing Admiral Byrd’s warning had proved prescient insofar as the Antarctic-basedGermans now had developed the capability to overfly the U.S. with squadrons offlying saucers by June 1947. With the rapid rise of UFO sightings after theArnold incident, it can be concluded that some were directly connected to theGerman space program out of Antarctica. The precise connection between these UFOreports with known World War II German flying saucer projects was something theUS Air Force immediately began investigating.Air Force Investigation Encounters the German ConnectionOne of the best sources of information about what happened after the KennethArnold and other UFO sightings over the U.S. is Captain Edward Ruppelt, whoheaded the USAF’s “Project Bluebook” from early 1951 to September 1953. In thefirst edition of his 1955 book, The Report of Unidentified Flying Objects , hedescribed the widespread panic among Air Force leaders that arose from the firstofficial studies of UFO sightings that began in June 1947: The memos and correspondence that Project Blue Book inherited from the old UFOprojects told the story of the early flying saucer era. These memos and piecesof correspondence showed that the UFO situation was considered to be serious; infact, very serious. The paper work of that period also indicated the confusionthat surrounded the investigation; The brass wanted an answer, quickly, andpeople were taking off in all directions. Everyone's theory was as good as thenext and each person with any weight at ATIC [Air Technical Intelligence Center,Wright Patterson AFB] was plugging and investigating his own theory. The ideasas to the origin of the UFO's fell into two main categories, earthly and nonearthly. [159] [text00029.html#_edn159] It’s important to mention that Ruppelt and the “Project Bluebook” investigationwere stationed at Wright Patterson AFB, the same location where the Roswellcraft debris had been taken. The debris and bodies were being closely studied,very likely, in a newly created classified laboratory there that Lt GeneralNathan Twining had ordered Major General Curtis LeMay to build on July 18, 1947,just two weeks after the Roswell Crash. [160] [text00029.html#_edn160]Any doubt over the importance of Wright-Patterson AFB in the overall study offlying saucers, whether merely of reported sightings or crash retrievals, islaid to rest in a declassified 1952 CIA document with the subject header:“Flying Saucers”. Released in 2010, the CIA document was issued from theassistant director, Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI), and clearly statedthat Wright-Patterson was the only facility conducting flying saucer research: OSI has investigated the work currently being performed on “flying saucers” andfound that the Air Technical Intelligence Center [ATIC], DI, USAF,Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, is the only group devoting appreciable effortand study to this subject”. [161] [text00029.html#_edn161] [Image00025.jpg]Figure 20. CIA document showing role of Wright Patterson AFB as only USAFfacility investigating flying saucer phenomenon While the leaked Majestic documents show that Air Force investigators hadquickly realized that the Roswell craft was extraterrestrial in origin, this didnot mean that the wave of UFO sightings now sweeping the U.S. were all alien aswell. The question over which flying saucer sightings were extraterrestrial andwhich were connected to the German flying saucer program in Antarcticaimmediately preoccupied the Majestic-12 committee and senior Air Forceofficials. From “Project Blue Book”, Captain Ruppelt provided an eyewitnessaccount to them of the different arguments, memoranda, and files that tried todetermine the unknown craft’s origins. One explanation that quickly emerged wasthat the UFO’s were connected in some way to revolutionary German aerospaceprojects from World War II: When World War II ended, the Germans had several radical types of aircraft andguided missiles under development. The majority of these projects were in themost preliminary stages but they were the only known craft that could evenapproach the performance of the objects reported by UFO observers. Like theAllies, after World War II the Soviets had obtained complete sets of data on thelatest German developments. This, coupled with rumors that the Soviets werefrantically developing the German ideas, caused no small degree of alarm. Asmore UFO's were observed near the Air Force's Muroc Test Center, the Army'sWhite Sands Proving Ground, and atomic bomb plants, ATIC's efforts became moreconcentrated.Wires were sent to intelligence agents in Germany requesting that they find outexactly how much progress had been made on the various German projects. [162][text00029.html#_edn162] Ruppelt, like the vast majority of Air Force officers, didn’t know that a Germanbreakaway group had established a colony in Antarctica which possessedoperational flying saucers that had dealt the Navy’s Operation Highjump a blowin early 1947. Even though Ruppelt and other Project Blue Book Investigatorsheld “Top Secret” security clearances, this would not have been sufficient togrant them access to compartmentalized information about the German’s Antarcticacolony. Nevertheless, Ruppelt’s book shows that some Air Force investigators hadconcluded that the UFO sightings held an important German connection. However,they concluded that some UFO sightings involved Soviet adaptions of Germanflying saucer prototypes, a logical misunderstanding given the limitedinformation that was made available to them at the time.An October 13, 1952, CIA document shows the US national security establishmentwas seriously investigating the link between flying saucers and the Soviet Unionas well. When reading the CIA document text, if one replaces the acronym “USSR”with “Antarctic-based Germans”, this will offer a more accurate idea of the realnational security dilemma confronting US policymakers in the early 1950’s: Determination of the scientific capabilities of the USSR [Antarctic-basedGermans] to create and control Flying Saucers as a weapon against the UnitedStates is a primary concern of the CIA/OSI. Its review of existing informationdoes not lead to the conclusion that the saucers are USSR [Antarctic-basedGerman] created or controlled. It is the view of OSI that collection ofintelligence information on the capabilities of the USSR [Antarctic-basedGermans] to produce, launch, and control Flying Saucers and the analysis of suchdata as might be collected cannot be very effective until there is adequatefundamental scientific research launched to clarify the nature and causes ofFlying Saucers and to devise means whereby they might be instantly identified.[163] [text00029.html#_edn163] This document illustrates several concerns as to why the craft were notoriginating from some clandestine USSR (or Antarctic-based German) program.However, this led to another explanation that some Air Force officers favoredinstead of the foreign power connection: the flying saucers wereextraterrestrial in origin. [Image00026.jpg]Figure 21. CIA document on USSR connection to flying saucers The ‘Extraterrestrial Hypothesis’ (ETH) was officially proposed as the mostvalid explanation for UFO/Flying Saucer sightings by a 1948 classified studyinitiated by the Air Force. The secret study of approximately 300 cases producedan “Estimate of the Situation” in September 1948, and its conclusion supportedthe “ETH”. The study and its remarkable conclusion were moved up the Air Forcehierarchy to the desk of the newly appointed Chief of Staff, General HoytVandenberg. Vandenberg rejected it and made clear that acceptance of the “ETH”was not an acceptable conclusion for reasons related to national securityconcerns. [164] [text00029.html#_edn164]Word of the rejection of the initial “Estimate of the Situation” and thesubsequent destruction of the report found its way to private UFO investigatorssuch as Major Donald Keyhoe, who concluded that it was evidence of a cover-upperpetuated from the highest level within the US military and government. Keyhoewas confidentially told the following by Captain Edward Ruppelt about GeneralVandenberg’s decision to reject the original “Estimate of the Situation”: “The general said it would cause a stampede.... How could we convince the publicthe aliens weren’t hostile when we didn’t know ourselves? ... the generalordered the secret analysis burned. But one copy was held out – Major DeweyFournet and I saw it in 1952. [165] [text00029.html#_edn165] It has long been assumed that Vandenberg simply wanted to cover up theextraterrestrial hypothesis. However, another explanation is that he wished theanswer to be indeterminate since he and other Majestic-12 members couldn’t besure which UFO reports were German and which were extraterrestrial. Support forthis conclusion comes from Kewper/Stein, the former Army Signals Corpsserviceman recruited to work for the CIA from 1957-1961. He stated that part ofhis mission assignment was to distinguish between German and extraterrestrialspacecraft operating out of Antarctica and South America. In an interview withEmmy award winning UFO researcher Linda Moulton Howe, Kewper/Stein described hisunit’s assignment: [Howe] You did have a photograph that confirmed the Germans were still flyingsome of their Peenemunde craft in South America?[Kewper] Oh, yeah! The craft with a high center about 12-feet high – they alllook like Haunebu II’s. Although they could be alien craft as well. But welabeled those photos as being German craft from Argentina. However, on radar, weused to see some of the real alien craft come from outer space right down intothe Argentina region. We also saw craft come into the Antarctica region fromouter space via radar we shared with the British down in the Falkland Islands inthe South Atlantic Ocean east of Argentina…. In 1959 to 1960, our unit wasseparating alien craft from the known German craft by the appearance of thecraft. We always found the German craft to be much slower in speed than thealien craft. Some alien craft were tracked from outer space doing something like30,000 mph! [166] [text00029.html#_edn166] Due to the technological inferiority of the German craft when compared to theirextraterrestrial allies, it is understandable why the German saucers likelypreferred to fly accompanied in a squadron formation, as exemplified in theKenneth Arnold incident. Possible documentary evidence for this pattern is shownin a CIA report referring to numerous sightings of a formation of flying saucersover Deception Island, Antarctica in July 1965. The CIA document refers to thefollowing brief report from nearby British, Chilean and Argentinian bases: ANTARCTIC FLYING SAUCERS - a group of red, green, and yellow flying saucers hasbeen seen flying over Deception Island for two hours by Argentine, Chilean, andBritish bases in Antarctica. The flying saucers were also seen flying information over the South Orkney island in quick circles. [167][text00029.html#_edn167] The proximity of the flying saucers to Antarctica does suggest that thisformation was part of the breakaway German colony that Byrd’s Operation Highjumphad confronted in 1947. [Image00027.jpg]Figure 22. CIA document on saucer formations near Antarctica If the Antarctic-based Germans did fly in formation over U.S. soil, as the 1947Kenneth Arnold and 1965 Antarctic sightings indicate, then arguably the bestphotographic evidence of this tendency is the Lubbock lights case that tookplace from August 28 to September 5, 1951. On successive nights, a formation oflights appeared over Lubbock, Texas, and was witnessed by multiple crediblesources and even photographed. Three professors who witnessed the craftestimated that they were traveling up to 6000 miles per hour (970k/h). It becameone of the most analyzed UFO cases in history, and the photographs have neverbeen debunked or satisfactorily explained. [168] [text00029.html#_edn168] [Image00028.jpg]Figure 23. Lubbock Lights - Possible photograph of German Flying SaucerFormation from Antarctica In contrast to the Germans in Antarctica sending their flying saucers information from their polar base, the extraterrestrial craft undoubtedly due totheir superior technology, as Kewper/Stein reported, could more safely fly solowhen traveling over US territory or anywhere else around the planet.Accordingly, as a general rule of thumb, I would deem squadrons of flyingsaucers sighted between the mid-1940’s up to the 1970’s, more likely than not tohave been German in origin. By the 1970’s, this would no longer apply becausethe US military had begun secretly deploying its own saucer craft, which will bediscussed later in chapter 14.Kewper/Stein also confirmed that part of the reason for government secrecy onthe UFO issue was because it was never clear who was behind the UFO phenomenon.In response to a question about why secrecy was maintained, Kewper/Stein said: I think basically it’s because of the German UFO program that started way backin 1917 and they developed their first vehicle in 1927. Most people don’t knowanything about this. Then after WWII, we did not capture any of those craft.They were all sent to Argentina and to the Antarctic base the Nazis had theresince 1938 before the war even started. I think the whole thing is still beingkept secret because our government does not know if it’s Nazis flying around orextraterrestrial aliens! [169] [text00029.html#_edn169] Consequently, while it is highly likely that the Kenneth Arnold sightinginvolved a squadron of German saucers from Antarctica, other UFO sightings couldhave involved either the Germans or extraterrestrial visitors. Given what wasknown from US Navy intelligence files of agreements reached between Nazi Germanyand Draco Reptilian aliens, there is even the possibility that some flyingsaucer craft involved BOTH Germans and extraterrestrials. [170][text00029.html#_edn170] As we will later see, the Betty and Barney Hillabduction case showed that Germans in Nazi uniforms were sometimes seencommanding the short Gray aliens conducting the abductions. [171][text00029.html#_edn171]The uncertainty over the true origin of many UFO sightings would have added tothe confusion among US leaders over how best to respond to UFO incursions overUS territory. Indeed, it’s more than likely that the Antarctic-based Germancolony adroitly exploited this confusion to inflate their influence and powerfor any negotiations with US policymakers that lay ahead. In the meantime, theArmy Air Force/USAF would not allow the German/extraterrestrial forays on theirhome turf to go unchallenged."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7Hidden Losses:The Shoot Down Policy Against Alien & Antarctic German Spacecraft “I can assure you that, given they exist, these flying saucers are made by nopower on this Earth.”— President Harry S. TrumanApril 4, 1950, press conferenceUFO Interference with Rocket Program Leads to Deadly RetaliationO ne of the little-known facts about the dawn of the modern UFO era in 1947 isthat the US Army used surface-to-air missiles and other advanced weapons tobring down UFOs that were interfering with the testing of V2 rockets. These V2rockets were critical for launching a future ballistic missile system employingnuclear weapons. In addition, Army Air Force pilots were given intercept andshoot down orders against the flying saucers that were increasingly beingspotted over US territory, especially near sensitive military facilities.Multiple sources have described the efforts made by pilots attempting to shootthe unknown craft out of the sky, and the tragic results that often occurred.The origin of the intercept and shoot down orders can be traced to UFOinterference occurring while rebuilt and refurbished V2 (aka A4) rockets werebeing test launched out of White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico, in May 1947.Markedly, this took place only two months after Admiral Byrd gave his famouswarning about the U.S. being attacked in a new war from unknown hostile aircraftfrom the polar regions.It was a shocking awakening when the breakaway German colony in Antarctica dealtthe US Navy’s Operation Highjump a walloping defeat during their attempt to takeover or destroy the German colony, yet it’s important to emphasize that theGermans were not acting alone. They had received direct assistance from theirextraterrestrial allies in defending the Antarctic colony. [172][text00029.html#_edn172] It is logical to assume then that the Germans and theiralien allies would have taken a keen interest in the US Army’s missiledevelopment program, recognizing that it would one day be able to delivernuclear weapons into far distant regions, including Antarctica. Consequently,the Germans and/or their extraterrestrial allies began a program of interferingwith Army rocket launches to send a clear message to US policymakers.Here is how the Las Cruces Sun-News of New Mexico described the May 15, 1947,White Sands missile launch that was adversely affected by a ‘UFO’,euphemistically referred to by the base commander as a “peculiar phenomenon”:Lt. Col. Harold R. Turner, White Sands Proving Ground commanding officer, todayblamed “peculiar phenomena” for the erratic test flight of a German V-2 rocketwhich landed only six miles east of Alamogordo yesterday afternoon. [173][text00029.html#_edn173] [Image00029.jpg]Figure 24. News report of V-2 rocket affected by UFO Veteran UFO researcher Timothy Good was sent an unpublished book manuscript byAndrew Kissner, a former state representative for New Mexico who hadinvestigated the early history of UFOs within the United States. Kissner alsosupplied Good with additional details about the “peculiar phenomenon” thatColonel Turner had named as the reason for the failure of the V-2 rocket test: As the rocket climbed to an intermediate altitude of 40 miles, Kissner learnedthat radar technicians assigned to US Army Ordnance watched in amazement asanother target instantaneously appeared right next to the missile. The V-2veered off course and crashed to earth two minutes later. [174][text00029.html#_edn174] Kissner was able to interview an Army officer at White Sands about the V-2rocket incident and wrote about what he had been told: Whatever had mysteriously appeared and vanished after observing a V-2 in flightin close proximity to the rocket, it apparently affected the rocket’strajectory. That event became an immediate priority within a very small, closedcircle of highly ranked general staff officers and civilian scientists assignedto the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDB) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff(JCS) under whose authority weapons test ranges were established and operatedand chaired by Dr. Vannevar Bush. The ‘peculiar phenomenon’ object was definedas hostile in that it appeared to have affected the V-2 rocket’s trajectory. Itwas by every definition an advanced foreign weapons system. Effort would beexpended to guard against further intrusions, and high priority was assigned tocollect a specimen of the technology for further analysis, covertly if possible.[175] [text00029.html#_edn175] The Army officer had revealed why the Pentagon had classed the UFOs interferingwith the V-2 tests as “hostile”, which was very similar to the language used byByrd in describing the unknown threat from Antarctica in his Chilean interview.[176] [text00029.html#_edn176] Furthermore, the Pentagon had decided to begindefending against “further intrusions”, and was hell-bent “to collect a specimenof the technology”. The meaning stood clear. The Truman administration wasdetermined to shoot down any UFOs interfering with the US missile program, andafterward study the recovered craft for future reverse engineering efforts.According to Kissner, the next missile test on May 29, 1947, constituted thefirst US Army Air Force attack against an intruding UFO, which was sightedhovering near the launch site of a V-2 rocket that was about to take off fromWhite Sands. The launch was aborted, and the hovering UFO was targeted by atleast one Army surface-to-air missile. Kissner explained unfolding eventsfurther: At approximately 7:20 pm, at an altitude above 60,000 feet, the proximity fuseon the warhead detonated – ten miles north and slightly west of Mt. Franklin.This explosion, witnessed by General Homer and reported by Hanson Baldwin in theNew York Times the following day, occurred more than 10 minutes before a secondexplosion at least 30 miles further south. Gen. Homer dispatched troops to lookfor missile wreckage and investigated the first crash site 10-15 miles northwestof Ft. Bliss, towards WSPG [White Sands Proving Ground].The surface-to-air missile’s target, possibly crippled by the explosion,continued to fly in airspace north of Ft. Bliss, eventually impacting within onemile of the then-new Buena Vista airport south of downtown Juarez, Mexico, at7:52 pm … A ‘blinding flash of light’ followed by a tremendous pressure wave[and] by the appearance of a mushroom cloud excited local rumors that an atomicbomb had exploded… The ground shock generated by the explosion was felt 35 milesnorthwest of the impact crater.Whatever the object had been was not apparent…. It was totally vaporized by theexplosion…. Military police stationed at Fort Bliss and other US Army personnelfrom WSPG rushed across the border into Mexico in an attempt to secure thedowned object. They were met at the crater by Mexico troops and summarilyevicted. Mexico’s general in command of the Juarez garrison, Enrique DiasGonzales, placed Juarez off-limits to US Army personnel for several weeks afterthe incident…. An effective cover story was immediately provided to the Pressthat another V-2 launched from White Sands had gone astray, experienced a totalgyroscopic failure, flew 180 degrees off course and crashed into Mexico. [177][text00029.html#_edn177] Successful in its defense, the US Army had shot down a UFO that was monitoringand presumably about to interfere with a V-2 rocket launch in the same way as inthe May 15 test episode. While no UFO wreckage was apparently recovered from theMay 29 incident, this did not remain the case with subsequent attempts to shootdown and retrieve intruding UFOs for analysis to satisfy the Trumanadministration’s request.Here is how Kissner summarized the strategic situation after UFOs beganinterfering with the V2 missile launches, including events that occurred soonafter the two May incidents, such as Roswell: At 4:11 p.m., Mountain Standard Time, Thursday, May 15, 1947, above the TularosaBasin in south central New Mexico, the most highly classified episode inAmerican military history began ­a series of events, decisions and actions thatultimately resulted in the crash and recovery of at least two, probably threeand possibly four, extraterrestrial ‘flying discs.’ This was accomplished bydeliberate antiaircraft artillery fire and/or use of surface-to-air missiles byunits of the U. S. Army National Antiaircraft Artillery School at Ft. Bliss,Texas and/or U. S. Army Air Force fighters based at Alamogordo Army Air Field atAlamogordo, New Mexico. The well-publicized ‘Roswell’ (Corona), New Mexicoflying disc was one of these. [178] [text00029.html#_edn178] Kissner’s analysis, based on his interviews and research, is astounding. TheRoswell UFO crash was no accident. It was a flying saucer that had been shotdown in the vicinity of White Sands Proving Ground – Roswell is only 128 miles(205 km) due east of White Sands. When we consider that the 1942 Los Angeles AirRaid incident resulted in two craft being shot down from an artillery barrage,the conclusion is that despite the highly advanced interplanetary propulsionsystem of UFOs, they were still vulnerable to the different weapons systemspossessed by US military forces at the time.Kissner studied newspaper reports from the period UFOs first began beingtargeted by the US military and found a clear spike in aviation crashesimmediately following the May 29, 1947, incident. A diagram compiled by Kissnerin his book, Peculiar Phenomena , shows a spike that involved the death of 198people from air crashes in the 72 hours following the V-2 Juarez, Mexico,incident.[Image00030.jpg]Figure 25. In the 72 hour period following the V-2 Juarez incident, 29 airplanescrashed around the world killing 198 people. Graphic © 1994 by J. AndrewKissner. Linda Moulton Howe reviewed Kissner’s work and summarized his findings on theair accidents as follows: Andrew Kissner reports that within 72 hours of the “Juarez Incident,”twenty-nine airplanes crashed around the world killing 198 people. The worstdisaster was near La Guardia Airport in New York where a United Airlines planetook off, crashed and burned, killing all 38 people aboard. While governmentCivil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigators were returning from the La Guardiacrash, an Eastern Airlines DC-4 went nose down and crashed, killing everyoneaboard. [179] [text00029.html#_edn179] The conclusion drawn by Kissner was that the civilian and military airplanecrashes were a form of retaliation by those behind the UFO phenomenon: Historical research suggests, however, something even more controversial thanthe ‘shoot downs.’ The U. S. Army’s actions either caused, or were a responseto, offensive overt acts initiated by flying discs themselves. Even thoughunproved, it appears that flying discs might have been a contributing factor inthe deaths of over six hundred military personnel and civilians in 1947 ­ over atwo month period from May 9 to July 31. Whatever flying discs were, or are, theywere not, and are not, defenseless. Their ‘special weapons’ were, and even noware, unconventional. Flying discs were immediately defined by the U. S. militaryin 1947 as an ‘enemy weapons system’”. A T-Force assigned to secure flying disccrash sites and collect debris.” [180] [text00029.html#_edn180] Kissner’s stunning research ultimately leads to the conclusion that eitherextraterrestrials and/or the Antarctic-based Germans were striking back bytargeting both military and civilian aircraft in response to attacks againsttheir flying saucers which were monitoring or interfering with V-2 rocket tests.The Escalation of Flying Saucer Engagements The UFOs were not just openly observing the Army’s V-2 rocket tests, but alsovery active in flying near highly sensitive US military facilities to monitorthem, especially when it came to the storage or deployment of nuclear weapons.This included Roswell Army Air Field, which at the time of the Roswell flyingsaucer crash had the only operational wing of nuclear bombers in the world. Itwas the presence of UFOs near such facilities that led to the Army Air Forceissuing intercept and shoot down orders against the UFOs. These craft could haveeither been German flying saucers from Antarctica or extraterrestrial pilotedcraft, for at least one was known to have crashed near Roswell .In July 1947, only two months after the Roswell crash, Kissner found that theArmy Air Force had lost five aircraft in the state of New Mexico. In his 1994report, Kissner showed how the USAF itself linked these “aircraft losses” to theRoswell incident: In September 1994, in the official US Air Force Study related to the ‘RoswellIncident’, the Air Force reports no aircraft accident as having occurred in ornear the crash site at the same time…. In addition, the Air Force reportedlosing five aircraft in New Mexico during July 1947. With the exception of theP-80, which is mentioned to have crashed somewhere in New Mexico, the Air Forcereports four other aircraft losses during July that I wasn’t able to find in anypublished news sources from 1947. [181] [text00029.html#_edn181] Kissner believed that these aircraft were some of the earliest victims ofretaliation by the UFOs. Thus, a long series of military and civilian airplanecrashes began, often resulting from the hot pursuit of UFOs by Army Air Forcefighter jets.The military/CIA whistleblower Kewper/Stein told Linda Moulton Howe how UFOswere being targeted around the world by both the United States and USSR: The CIA was working to increase the different radars around the United States sothey could detect more of the alien craft coming in if they come from outerspace and would be able to scramble jets to check them out – or shoot them down.[182] [text00029.html#_edn182] …It could have been something that happened since the 1947 time period. I thinkthere was an event over the Soviet Union. I know the Soviets had a big craft goover that was like a ‘mothership.’ They tried to shoot it down and the thingshot all their aircraft pursuing it right out of the air in only a few secondsusing lasers or whatever the extraterrestrial craft’s weapons were. [183][text00029.html#_edn183] One of the most well-known cases of the military’s aggressive attempts tointercept and shoot down a UFO involved Captain Thomas Mantel, whose F-51 (akaP-51) Mustang crashed on January 7, 1948. Mantel was serving at the time withthe Kentucky Air National Guard when he and three other pilots were ordered tointercept a UFO. Project Bluebook’s Edward Ruppelt described the multiplesightings and reports from state police that led to the intercept orders: The towns people had described the object to the state police as being\"circular, about 250 to 300 feet in diameter,\" and moving westward at a \"prettygood clip.\" … About this time Colonel Hix, the base commander, arrived. Helooked and he was baffled. At two thirty, they reported, they were discussingwhat should be done when four F-51's came into view, approaching the base fromthe south.The tower called the flight leader, Captain Mantell, and asked him to take alook at the object and try to identify it. One F-51 in the flight was runninglow on fuel, so he asked permission to go on to his base. Mantell took his tworemaining wing men, made a turn, and started after the UFO. The people in GodmanTower were directing him as none of the pilots could see the object at thistime. They gave Mantell an initial heading toward the south and the flight waslast seen heading in the general direction of the UFO.By the time the F-51's had climbed to 10,000 feet, the two wing men laterreported, Mantell had pulled out ahead of them and they could just barely seehim. At two forty-five Mantell called the tower and said, \"I see something aboveand ahead of me and I'm still climbing.\" All the people in the tower heardMantell say this and they heard one of the wing men call back and ask, \"What thehell are we looking for?\" The tower immediately called Mantell and asked him fora description of what he saw. Odd as it may seem, no one can remember exactlywhat he answered. Saucer historians have credited him with saying, \"I've sightedthe thing. It looks metallic and it's tremendous in size.... Now it's startingto climb.\" Then in a few seconds he is supposed to have called and said, \"It'sabove me and I'm gaining on it. I'm going to 20,000 feet.\" Everyone in the toweragreed on this one last bit of the transmission, \"I'm going to 20,000 feet,\" butdidn't agree on the first part, about the UFO's being metallic and tremendous.[184] [text00029.html#_edn184] While Ruppelt downplayed Mantell’s description of the craft as “metallic and oftremendous size” since saucer historians were the source for the quote, a jointAir Force and Navy intelligence analysis confirmed that these were the verywords which Mantell had used. The intelligence analysis also provided moredetails from Mantell’s communication: “It appears to be metallic object … oftremendous size … directly ahead and slightly above … I am trying to close for abetter look.” [185] [text00029.html#_edn185]Furthermore, Mantell’s final radio transmission was consistent with what thetownspeople had witnessed; a circular craft about 300 feet in diameter movingquickly. Mantell took his F-51 into a steep climb while pursuing the UFO andsoon after crashed. The official explanation was that Mantell had blacked outdue to the lack of oxygen at the high elevation and had not recovered in time toprevent his plane from crashing. This led to a big unanswered question over whyan experienced Air Force pilot like Mantell had committed such a grave error.[186] [text00029.html#_edn186] Mantell had an oxygen mask after all. The answerto the mystery is quite simple: the Air Force was lying to cover up what reallyhappened.Leonard Stringfield, a former USAF intelligence officer learned the truth fromone of his more reliable sources: I have heard a number of exotic stories about the Mantell incident, but onestands out that comes from a reliable source [who] related that he had talkedwith Mantell’s wingman, who witnessed the incident. The pilot stated thatMantell pursued the UFO because he was the only pilot equipped with an adequateoxygen mask [and] also related that he saw a burst of what appeared to betracers fired from the UFO, which hit the P-51 [aka F-51] and caused it todisintegrate in the air. Since the Mantell case, all other military encountersending in disaster have been hidden from the public. [187][text00029.html#_edn187] Stringfield’s source revealed that fighters that got too close to the flyingsaucers would be fired upon. Major Donald Keyhoe, a former Marine Corps aviator,also had reliable sources within the military who told him about the Air Forcecovering up the truth that UFOs were shooting down pursuing aircraft up to theearly 1950’s: Back in the early 1950s, when I knew of the jet scrambles that sometimes led todisaster, I agreed with Major Keyhoe's writings that in these we may know theintent of the UFO. I also agreed that 'losing our aircraft to the UFO' may havebeen the reason for official secrecy, fearing that the public would panic ifthey knew the truth. [188] [text00029.html#_edn188] Frank Fechino, author of Shoot Them Down! The Flying Saucer Air Wars of 1952described the air battles that occurred in the summer of 1952 between flyingsaucers and fighter planes from the U.S. and other countries. Fechino’s booktitle was no exaggeration. While heading Project Bluebook, Edward Ruppelt readmany official reports of Air Force pilots actively targeting and shooting atUFOs. Ruppelt described being shown one classified report of an incident whichoccurred in 1952. The base commander had wanted Ruppelt to see it before havingto destroy it due to the Air Force hierarchy wanting to cover up such incidents.Ruppelt explained what he read in the F-86 pilot’s report about his hot pursuitof a UFO that he had shot at: Again the pilot pushed the nose of the F-86 down and started after the object.He closed fairly fast, until he came to within an estimated 1,000 yards. Now hecould get a good look at the object. Although it had looked like a balloon fromabove, a closer view showed that it was definitely round and flat saucer shaped.The pilot described it as being \"like a doughnut without a hole.\" …When the object traveled out about 1,000 yards, the pilot suddenly made up hismind – he did the only thing that he could do to stop the UFO. It was like aDavid about to do battle with a Goliath, but he had to take a chance. Quicklycharging his guns, he started shooting. A moment later the object pulled up intoa climb and in a few seconds it was gone. The pilot climbed to 10,000 feet,called the other F-86, and now was able to contact his buddy. They joined up andwent back to their base.As soon as he had landed and parked, the F-86 pilot went into operations to tellhis story to his squadron commander. The mere fact that he had fired his gunswas enough to require a detailed report, as a matter of routine. But thecircumstances under which the guns actually were fired created a majordisturbance at the fighter base that day. [189] [text00029.html#_edn189] The heavy loss of life and aircraft that occurred during this period came frommultiple sources reporting on the incidents. Ruppelt described the compiledresults: In just June and July of 1952, the U.S. lost NINETY-FOUR fighter jets worldwideand 51 men confirmed killed. Planes were falling to the ground two and three ata time in some cases. The entire month of September records are missing.According to the NY Times ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY-TWO aircraft vanished or weredestroyed between the years 1951 and 1956. [190] [text00029.html#_edn190] It is these summer of 1952 incidents which most challenged the assumption heldby the majority of researchers and historians; they believed that the UFOs beingintercepted and shot at, and which were retaliating against their pursuers andeven against innocent civilian aircraft, were extraterrestrial in origin.However, the Washington DC 1952 flyovers have provided the most compellingevidence that the flying saucers often observed in squadron formation were, infact, piloted by Antarctic-based Germans."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8Did Extraterrestrial or German Saucers Fly Over Washington DC? Uninvited guests seldom meet a welcome.–Aesop T he 1952 “Washington DC Flyover” is a key historical event which has been welldocumented by multiple sources. Over three successive weekends beginning on July12, 1952, fleets of UFOs (or flying saucers as they were known at the time) flewover the restricted airspace of Washington DC. The two most publicized flyoverevents were on the weekends of July 19-20 and July 26-27. [191][text00029.html#_edn191] They flew directly over the White House, the CapitolBuilding, and the Pentagon. Thousands witnessed the UFO which were tracked bymultiple radar installations, pursued by Air Force jets and photographed. MajorDonald Keyhoe and other leading UFO researchers of the era thought theWashington flap was the best evidence yet of extraterrestrials visiting Earth.[192] [text00029.html#_edn192]Major newspapers gave prominent coverage to the sightings, with headlinesannouncing to millions that US Air Force jets were in hot pursuit of thesaucer-shaped lights that had flown over the nation’s capital. The WashingtonPost ran with the headline, “‘Saucer’ Outran Jet, Pilot Remembers”. The New YorkDaily News blared on its front page, “Jets Chase D.C. Sky Ghosts”. The TimesHerald Sun declared “Jets Prepared For Fight With Saucers Here: Ready to DoAnything If They Return”, and the Washington Daily News led with the headline,“Aerial Whatzits Buzz D.C. Again!” [Image00031.gif]Figure 26. Summer of 1952 Newspaper Headlines On the 50 th year anniversary of the event, the Washington Post wrote: It was Saturday night, July 19, 1952 – 50 years ago – one of the most famousdates in the bizarre history of UFOs. Before the night was over, a pilotreported seeing unexplained objects, radar at two Air Force bases – Andrews andBolling – picked up the UFOs, and two Air Force F-94 jets streaked overWashington, searching for flying saucers.Then, a week a later, it happened again – more UFOs on the radar screen, morejets scrambled over Washington…. The UFOs appeared on radar at the flight control centers of National Airport,Andrews Air Force Base, and Bolling Air Force Base, as the Washington Post wenton to describe: The blips first appeared on radar screens at National at 11:40 that Saturdaynight: seven unidentified targets about 15 miles southeast of the city…. They’dcruise leisurely at 100 to 130 mph, then abruptly zoom off in an extraordinaryburst of speed…. Barnes, the head controller … called his counterparts atAndrews and Bollings to ask if they saw anything unusual on their radar screens.They were getting blips in the same places…. [193] [text00029.html#_edn193] Both radar trackers and pilots physically saw the UFOs which witnesses describedas saucers or glowing objects: At National, Cocklin looked out his window and saw what he recalls as a “whitishblue light” emanating from a solid object that was “round with no distinguishingmarks such as wings or a nose or a tail.” It looked, he says, “like a saucer”.Civilian planes flying into Washington reported seeing strange glowing objectsin places where the radar was getting blips … [194] [text00029.html#_edn194] The flying saucers could easily outrun the Air Force F-94 Starfire jets sentafter them: One pilot chased, but couldn’t catch, the streaking light. “I tried to makecontact with the bogies below 1,000 feet,” pilot William Patterson toldinvestigators. “I was at my maximum speed but… I ceased chasing them, because Isaw no chance of overtaking them. [195] [text00029.html#_edn195] The US Air Force held a press conference on July 29, 1952, and Major GeneralJohn Samford claimed that it was all due to a “temperature inversion”. [196][text00029.html#_edn196] Even President Truman became involved when his advisorcalled on Project Blue Book for a report and was given the official Air Forceexplanation. [197] [text00029.html#_edn197] Much of the media and the generalpublic were confused by the official Air Force declaration but dutifully ignoredthe issue out of national security concerns. For over sixty years, the secret ofwho really flew over Washington DC and other major US cities in 1952 has beenwithheld from the general public.UFOs were often seen in the Washington DC area according to Edward Ruppelt, whowrote at length about the multiple sightings in his Project Blue Book “Report onUnidentified Flying Objects”: The investigation brought out a few more points on the pro side too. We foundout that the UFO's frequently visited Washington. On May 23 fifty targets hadbeen tracked from 8:00 P.M. till midnight. They were back on the Wednesday nightbetween the two famous Saturday night sightings, the following Sunday night, andagain the night of the press conference; then during August they were seen eightmore times. On several occasions military and civilian pilots saw lights exactlywhere the radar showed the UFOs to be. [198] [text00029.html#_edn198] Who was behind the flying saucers over Washington DC – extraterrestrials,Germans from Antarctica, an alleged Inner Earth civilization, or a combinationof all three? For an answer, we need to begin with a mysterious prediction ofthe July flying saucer sightings, which Edward Ruppelt wrote about in his book: A few days prior to the incident a scientist, from an agency that I can't name,and I were talking about the build-up of reports along the east coast of theUnited States. We talked for about two hours, and I was ready to leave when hesaid that he had one last comment to make — a prediction. From his study of theUFO reports that he was getting from Air Force Headquarters, and fromdiscussions with his colleagues, he said that he thought that we were sittingright on top of a big keg full of loaded flying saucers. \"Within the next fewdays,\" he told me, and I remember that he punctuated his slow, deliberateremarks by hitting the desk with his fist, \"they're going to blow up and you'regoing to have the granddaddy of all UFO sightings. The sighting will occur inWashington or New York,\" he predicted, \"probably Washington.\" [199][text00029.html#_edn199] Importantly, this government scientist made his startling prediction of theWashington DC sightings taking place based on classified reports “from Air ForceHeadquarters, and from discussions with his colleagues”. So, who hadforeknowledge of the coming wave of UFO sightings at Air Force Headquarters andhow were scientists involved? For an answer, we can turn to contactee George VanTassell, who wrote a letter to the Air Force on behalf of human-lookingextraterrestrials from an interplanetary alliance.George Van Tassel’s Warning About UFO OverflightsVan Tassel is best known for having organized major conventions at Giant Rock,California, that began in 1954, which focused on individuals claiming to havebeen contacted by human-looking extraterrestrials, today called Nordics. Thebiggest of his conventions had 11,000 people attending in 1959, [200][text00029.html#_edn200] and very large crowds continued to come throughout the1960’s until the Vietnam War protests eclipsed public interest inextraterrestrial contact stories. It was Van Tassel’s interactions with a groupof Nordics that led to him being given forewarning about the 1952 Washington DCFlyover.Van Tassel was the first to describe a vast fleet of spaceships belonging to aquasi-military space order called the “Ashtar Command”. Its titular head was“Ashtar”, described in one of the messages received by Van Tassel asrepresenting the executive branch of a Galactic authority/legislature headed bythe “Council of the Twelve Lords and the Council of the Seven Lights.” [201][text00029.html#_edn201] The Ashtar Command was part of an interplanetaryalliance of worlds, widely referred to as the “Galactic Federation”, which wasmaking contact with governments and private citizens. Van Tassel’s relationshipwith the Nordics/Galactic Federation was directly communicated to the highestlevels of government and military in the United States.It was in January 1952 that Van Tassel first began receiving his messages.President Truman at the time was in his final year in office — Dwight Eisenhowerwas elected later that year on November 4. Van Tassel relayed information givento him by the Nordics/Galactic Federation to the US Air Force at WrightPatterson Air Force Base several months before the detonation of the very firstHydrogen bomb test on November 1, 1952. The Nordics said that it would conduct ashow of force to deter US authorities from moving forward with its nucleardevelopment program.In a small book giving the chronology of his communications with the GalacticFederation and messages he relayed to the Air Force, Van Tassel said he receivedthe following brief message on March 7, 1952: “Watch your skies in your monthsof May to August.” [202] [text00029.html#_edn202] On April 6, there was moreinformation conveyed about what was about to take place, and a warning to theAir Force: Your Pentagon will soon have much to muddle over. We are going to give thisglobe a buzz. I hope they do not intercept us from in front. [203][text00029.html#_edn203] Here is what Van Tassel had to say about this cryptic April 6, 1952communication which alluded to the danger of trying to intercept the GalacticFederation’s spacecraft: This message received in April was carried out three months later in the latterpart of July. The Pentagon, can only mean Washington, D.C. There is no doubtthey had \"much to muddle over.\" The \"buzz\" was accomplished by the saucerbeings. The statement that the saucers hoped the Air Force would not interceptthem in front, indicates that the saucers also knew in advance that there wouldbe an attempt to intercept them. Is it coincidence that a letter mailed by me toAir Forces Intelligence Command, at the request of the Saucer beings in the July18th message, was in their hands when the \"buzz\" occurred? I do not comprehendhow the letter's arrival, the \"buzz,\" the reference to the Pentagon, and theexpected interception, can all be coincidence. My belief is that the saucerbeings timed it that way, to let the Air Force know that this information wasauthentic. Their return receipt showed they received the letter July 22, 1952.The \"buzz\" was on July 26, 27 and 28th. [204] [text00029.html#_edn204] The “buzz” referred to the successive weekend flyovers above Washington DC inmid-to-late July 1952. This is very likely the source for the advance knowledgeof the flyover that Ruppelt wrote about, which Air Force Headquarters andgovernment scientists had been made aware of. Van Tassel received a message onJuly 18 from the Galactic Federation (a day before the July 19 flyover) which herelayed to the Air Force before the final flyovers on July 26-28. Hail to you beings of Shan [Earth]. I greet you in love and peace. My identityis Ashtar, commandant quadra sector, patrol station Schare, all projections, allwaves. Greetings. Through the Council of the Seven Lights you have been broughthere, inspired with the inner light to help your fellow man. You are mortals,and other mortals can only understand that which their fellow man canunderstand. The purpose of this organization is, in a sense, to save mankindfrom himself. Some years ago, your time, your nuclear physicists penetrated the\"Book of Knowledge.\" They discovered how to explode the atom. Disgusting as theresults have been, that this force should be used for destruction, it is notcompared to that which can be. We have not been concerned with their explosionof plutonium and U235, the Uranium mother element; this atom is an inertelement.We are concerned, however, with their attempt to explode the hydrogen element.This element is life giving along with five other elements in the air youbreathe, in the water you drink, in the composition of your physical self. Inmuch of your material planet is this life giving atomic substance, hydrogen.Their efforts in the field of science have been successful to the extent thatthey are not content to rest on the laurels of a power beyond their use; notcontent with the entire destruction of an entire city at a time. They must havesomething more destructive. They've got it….Our message to you is this: You shall advance to your government all informationwe have transmitted to you. You shall request that your government shallimmediately contact all other earth nations regardless of political feelings.Many of your physicists with an inner perception development have refused tohave anything to do with the explosion of the hydrogen atom. The explosion of anatom of inert substance and that of a living substance are two different things.We are not concerned with man's desire to continue war on this planet, Shan. Weare concerned with their deliberate determination to extinguish humanity andturn this planet into a cinder.… Our missions are peaceful, but this condition occurred before in this solarsystem and the planet Lucifer was torn to bits. We are determined that it shallnot happen again. The governments on the planet Shan have conceded that we areof a higher intelligence. They must concede also that we are of a higherauthority. We do not have to enter their buildings to know what they are doing.We have the formula they would like to use. It is not meant for destruction.Your purpose here has been to build a receptivity that we could communicate withyour planet, for by the attraction of light substance atoms, we patrol youruniverse.\"To your government and to your people and through them to all governments andall peoples on the planet of Shan, accept the warning as a blessing that mankindmay survive.\" [205] [text00029.html#_edn205] The message claimed that Ashtar and the Galactic Federation were acting on ahigher authority than human governments in their efforts to warn humanity aboutthe dangers of thermonuclear weapons (aka hydrogen bombs). The message’sreference to the opposition of some atomic scientists to thermonuclear weaponswas based on the determined protests by a group of scientists led by RobertOppenheimer, “father of the atomic bomb”, to the development of hydrogen bombs.[206] [text00029.html#_edn206] It’s worth emphasizing that hydrogen bombs aremore than a thousand times more powerful than atomic bombs. For example, theNovember 1, 1952, Ivy Mike test involved a thermonuclear device with adestructive force of just over 10 megatons, which was nearly 1000 times thedestructive force of the atomic bomb dropped at Hiroshima. [207][text00029.html#_edn207] Nearly a decade later, on October 30, 1961, the SovietUnion detonated its Tsar Bomba, which was a hydrogen bomb with an estimatedyield between 50-60 megatons.Even the Tsar Bomba, however, was dwarfed in comparison to the country-killerproposed by Dr. Edward Teller, who is widely acclaimed/reviled as the father ofthe hydrogen bomb, and who led an effort to discredit Oppenheimer. Rather thanmerely destroying a city, Teller’s proposed 10,000 megaton (10 gigaton) monsterwould destroy an entire country: A 10,000 megaton weapon, by my estimation, would be powerful enough to set allof New England on fire. Or most of California. Or all of the UK and Ireland. Orall of France. Or all of Germany. Or both North and South Korea. And so on.[208] [text00029.html#_edn208] The danger of thermonuclear weapons becoming so powerful that they could destroyan entire planet, as the Nordics warned, was very real if scientists such asTeller ever got the approval to build gigaton-scale hydrogen bombs.Apparently, this was not the first time such destructive gigaton-scale hydrogenbombs had been built in our solar system, according to the Galactic Federation’sreference to the planet “Lucifer” (aka Maldek or Tiamat) which was destroyed bynuclear weapons. Was the asteroid belt the remnants of another planet in oursolar system that was destroyed by thermonuclear weapons? US Naval Astronomer,Dr. Thomas Van Flandern, has presented compelling data that the asteroid belt isindeed the remnants of an exploded planet, and furthermore, claims that theplanet Mars was previously a moon of this destroyed planet. [209][text00029.html#_edn209]Dr. John Brandenberg has presented a cogent scientific argument that Mars onceexperienced a nuclear war in its ancient history which devastated the planet.[210] [text00029.html#_edn210] When combining Van Flandern and Brandenberg’sinformation, the conclusion reached is that our solar system has certainly beensubjected in its distant past to a thermonuclear war that destroyed one planetand devastated another using enormous gigaton-scale hydrogen bombs. InAntarctica’s Hidden History , I discuss how refugees from Mars and a former“Super-Earth” in the asteroid belt (aka Lucifer/Maldek/Tiamet) escaped to Earth,and not only were instrumental in introducing advanced technologies to humanitybut also for building ancient civilizations such as Atlantis. [211][text00029.html#_edn211]Given this disturbing history in our solar system and the danger ofthermonuclear war happening again, it is understandable why the GalacticFederation was intent on delivering such a stern warning to humanity, especiallythe Air Force. At the time, only the Air Force had the capability of droppingnuclear weapons through its strategic bomber fleets, which could travel to anylocation on Earth. In 1952, the USAF was headed by Generals Hoyt Vandenberg (AirForce Chief of Staff) and Nathan Twining (Air Force Vice Chief of Staff) whowere both big supporters of the strategic bombing doctrine that was creditedwith winning World War II. The research and development of thermonuclear weaponswas strongly backed by Vandenberg and Twining, who both were founding members ofthe Majestic 12 Group according to the “Eisenhower Briefing Document”. [212][text00029.html#_edn212]Van Tassell said that his message from the Galactic Federation was received andimmediately relayed to the Air Force on July 18, 1952, and officially receivedon July 22. Consequently, Air Force officers were aware of the GalacticFederation’s warning and their plans to stage a massive flyover of WashingtonDC. It’s certain that both Vandenberg and Twining received Van Tassel’s warning.What role did the Antarctic-based Germans and their extraterrestrial allies playin the Washington DC Flyover? Were they passive witnesses to the GalacticFederation buzzing the United States Capitol, or did they actively participatein some way to show off their own advanced technologies to set the stage forfuture negotiations with US authorities?Antarctic German Colony and the Washington DC FlyoverAfter the dismal failure of “Operation Highjump” Admiral Byrd warned of ahostile force that could fly over US territory from the polar regions, whichcertainly referred to the German spacecraft operating out of Antarctica.Importantly, this powerful German contingent was not acting alone but wasimmeasurably helped by their extraterrestrial and Inner Earth allies. InAntarctica’s Hidden History , I described at length how the Germans acquiredboth extraterrestrial and Inner Earth partnerships as a result of the originalVril Society channelings in the early 1920’s, which established communicationswith both Nordics from Aldebaran and an Inner Earth civilization associated withthe ancient Hyperboreans, the alleged racial progenitors of the Aryans. [213][text00029.html#_edn213] The Vril Society faction, headed by Maria Orsic, wenton to establish a presence in Antarctica and closely worked with the Inner Earthcivilization connected to the Hyperboreans – known as the “Arianni”.In the alleged posthumous diary of Admiral Byrd reference is made to the“Arianni”, an Inner Earth civilization he purportedly met during the 1947Operation Highjump expedition. While Byrd’s diary is very controversial, thereis a good reason to believe that key elements are based on fact. It is known,for example, that Byrd’s surveillance flight over Antarctica on February 19,1947, was shrouded in uncertainty when radio contact was broken, during whichtime his plane was thought lost, but then mysteriously reappeared. [214][text00029.html#_edn214] In addition, Corey Goode says that the Arianni werementioned in intelligence briefing documents which he had access to while he wasassigned to the Navy’s “Solar Warden” secret space program. Goode reported thatthe Arianni, along with the Draco Reptilians, helped the Germans establish theirAntarctic bases: There was help from the Draco Federation as well as a group that the Nazi’s wereled to believe were ET’s (referred to as “Arianni” or “Aryans”, sometimes called“Nordics”) but were actually an Ancient Earth Human Break Away Civilization thathad developed a Space Program (referred to as “The Silver Fleet”) and createdvast bases below the Himalayan Mountains (largest in Tibet and called the systemAgartha) and a few other regions. [215] [text00029.html#_edn215] If we accept Goode’s testimony and Byrd’s reference to the Arianni as factuallybased, then it’s worth also considering what Byrd was told by the Arianni duringhis brief 1947 encounter.Byrd’s diary details the Arianni’s vehement opposition to the development ofatomic weapons, which was explained to him by one of their elders (also calledMasters). You are in the domain of the Arianni, the Inner World of the Earth. We shall notlong delay your mission, and you will be safely escorted back to the surface andfor a distance beyond. But now, Admiral, I shall tell you why you have beensummoned here. Our interest rightly begins just after your race exploded thefirst atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. It was at that alarmingtime we sent our flying machines, the \"Flugelrads\", to your surface world toinvestigate what your race had done.…You see, we have never interfered before in your race's wars, and barbarity, butnow we must, for you have learned to tamper with a certain power that is not forman, namely, that of atomic energy. Our emissaries have already deliveredmessages to the powers of your world, and yet they do not heed. Now you havebeen chosen to be witness here that our world does exist. [216][text00029.html#_edn216]The Arianni told Byrd that if the U.S. abandoned its quest for increasinglydestructive nuclear weapons, assistance would be given to humanity to uncoverthe many wondrous secrets of the Earth’s distant past.We see at a great distance a new world stirring from the ruins of your race,seeking its lost and legendary treasures, and they will be here, my son, safe inour keeping. When that time arrives, we shall come forward again to help reviveyour culture and your race.Perhaps, by then, you will have learned the futility of war and its strife ...and after that time, certain of your culture and science will be returned foryour race to begin anew. You, my son, are to return to the Surface World withthis message....' [217] [text00029.html#_edn217] While the U.S. refused the offer, it appears that years earlier the Germans hadaccepted it. This helps explain why the Germans were given sanctuary inAntarctica and assistance from one of the advanced Inner Earth civilizations, asclaimed by Goode. The Germans gave up their atomic weapons program even thoughit was far more advanced than official historians have acknowledged. In fact,it’s very likely that the Germans handed over their atomic research to theUnited States at the end of World War II as a conditional term for allowing manyof its Nazi leaders to escape to safe havens in South America, as contended byresearchers such as Dr. Joseph Farrell. [218] [text00029.html#_edn218]In addition to working with an Inner Earth civilization, the Vril-Orsic factionof the German Antarctic colony also cooperated with the Galactic Federation inhelping to raise human consciousness, an effort that included warning peopleabout the dangers of nuclear weapons. A number of contact cases actuallyinvolved the Orsic faction masquerading as extraterrestrials. [219][text00029.html#_edn219] Even famous contactee cases offer examples, such asBilly Meier’s Pleiadians/Plejarans who were in fact members of the German colonyin Antarctica pretending to be extraterrestrials. In Antarctica’s Hidden History, I showed how the craft Meier photographed were very similar in design to theNazi SS “Haunebu” flying saucers. [220] [text00029.html#_edn220] Also, Goodesaid in a 2016 lecture that when a photo of Maria Orsic was shown to Meier, heidentified her as “Semjase”, his principal extraterrestrial contact: … when the military found out about Meier's case, they sent people over withsome photographs for him to try and identify the female being he saw. He quicklypointed out one photograph, saying, \"That's her! That's her!\" Apparently thephoto he pointed out was of Maria Orsic, the medium from the Vril Society, whowas making contact with inner-Earth groups, and who played an intimate role inthe pre and post World War II German secret space program. [221][text00029.html#_edn221] Compounding the already complex alliances involving the German Antarctic colonyand its space program were the agreements it had reached with the Draconians.Both William Tompkins and Corey Goode have referred to the role played by theDraconians in helping the Germans to establish their colony in Antarctica. [222][text00029.html#_edn222] Tompkins explained that this German-extraterrestrialalliance was well known to the US Navy due to the intelligence gained from itsembedded spies working within Nazi Germany between 1942 to 1946, who hadwitnessed firsthand the stunning technological advances made by the Nazi regimeas a direct result of the Draconians’ support. Though the Nazi flying saucerswere not weaponized in time to win World War II, the weaponization had beencompleted by early 1947 and allowed them to defeat Byrd’s Operation Highjumpcomprehensively.Therefore, to understand the German Antarctic space program, it is important toacknowledge that there were two main factions which had their own respectivealliances with extraterrestrial groups. While one faction cooperated with theDraconian extraterrestrials and built an interstellar fleet of spacecraft forimperial conquest, which Goode has called the “Dark Fleet”, the other Germanfaction cooperated with an Inner Earth civilization (Arianni) and the Nordicsfrom the Aldebaran star system. This meant that the Orsic faction of the Germancolony was linked to various positive activities being carried out by theGalactic Federation, such as raising human consciousness and eliminating nuclearweapons. Consequently, the communications that Van Tassell received from theAshtar Command/Galactic Federation were very likely linked to, or influenced by,the German Antarctic colony.To recap, the Kenneth Arnold incident was the first example of German Antarcticsquadrons flying over US territory, as evidenced by the similarity in designbetween the German-made “Horton 229 flying wing craft” and the “wing craft”Arnold witnessed over the Cascades. In addition, extraterrestrial spacecraftwere interfering with rocket tests and monitoring nuclear facilities, which ledto confrontations because of USAF pilots had been ordered to intercept or shootdown the flying saucer craft. Subsequent dog fights between USAF jets and theGerman saucers or those of their extraterrestrial allies led to casualties onboth sides. US military and civilian craft also began crashing in increasingnumbers after the Juarez V2 UFO incident in May 1947. Up to 1952, German andextraterrestrial spacecraft continued to fly over US territory pursuing multipleagendas, one of which was to deter US authorities from developing thermonuclearweapons. Consequently, the German saucers from Antarctica were very likelyinvolved in some capacity with the Washington DC Flyover. The extent of thisGerman involvement is revealed by multiple insider sources.William Tompkins stated in various interviews that the Antarctic-based Germansdid the DC flyover. In a private conversation, I specifically asked Tompkins ifAntarctic-based Nazi spacecraft flew over the U.S. in the summer of 1952. Hereplied: It’s of course a ‘Yes’. Some had the swastika on them and some had the Germancross, but they were all extraterrestrial type vehicles, okay, which the Germanshad re-engineered, reversed, whatever, and were putting in production. So, thosevehicles were not powered by extraterrestrials or extraterrestrial vehicles.These were German vehicles that had been given to Germany by the Reptilians, butthese were production vehicles out of the production facilities in Antarctica.[223] [text00029.html#_edn223] Similarly, Goode said in an interview: They had also received intelligence from their Paperclip spies that theAmericans had implemented an Executive Order making the existence of alien lifethe most classified subject on the planet. The reason being that the developmentand release of free energy would quickly destroy the oil trade, and soonthereafter the entire Babylonian Money Magic Slave System that all elites use tocontrol the masses. The Nazi’s used this to their advantage in some very publicsorties over Washington, DC and highly Secret Atomic Warfare Bases to mention afew. Eisenhower finally relented and signed a treaty with them (and a few othergroups, both ET and Ancient Civilizations pretending to be ET). [224][text00029.html#_edn224] [Image00032.jpg]Figure 27. Photo of 1952 Washington DC Flyover Tompkins and Goode’s controversial claims are corroborated by whistleblowerClark McClelland, who worked for 34 years with NASA and finished his career as aSpacecraft Operator. In the August 3, 2015, installment of his book, TheStargate Chronicles, McClelland wrote: The over flights of advance very swift crafts over Washington, DC were theseGerman advanced aircraft that totally out flew American advanced crafts. On July12, 1952, President Truman observed several of the UFOs and was completelyamazed by their capabilities of outmaneuvering the USAF ... advanced Jet fighter… [Lockheed F-94 Starfire]. USA jets sent up to bring one down. None could flythe speed of the German Saucers. [225] [text00029.html#_edn225] McClelland also described the role of Nazi scientists who had fled to Antarcticain relation to the 1952 Washington DC Flyover: Because I worked with the German Scientists that were brought to the USA by Dr.Werner von Braun in 1946/7. Several told me that WWII German Scientists by themany thousands escaped from Germany near the fall of Germany in WW II. Theyboarded advanced submarines in the Baltic Sea. They were all taken to the SouthPole base located underground, in Antarctica. Some called it Hitler’s ShangriLa. Those scientists created advanced anti-gravity craft that were flying in ourair space for many years. And still are. They were observed over Washington, DCin 1952 by President Harry S. Truman. Yes, we did not have any aircraft thatcould stop these German planes from flying over our national capital in 1952. SoGerman scientific expertise was again showing the USA who was boss. [226][text00029.html#_edn226] So, did extraterrestrial or German saucers fly over Washington DC? The answer isfound in the alliances that were made, and the common interest thesepartnerships all shared in pressuring the Truman administration to abandon itsthermonuclear weapons development plans. Both the Galactic Federation, which hadcome to include the German Vril-Orsic faction in Antarctica, and theGerman-Draconian alliance based in Antarctica were, therefore, directly involvedin the Washington DC Flyovers.Only three days before the November 4, 1952, election of President Eisenhower,Truman authorized the 10 megaton Ivy Mike nuclear test, the first-everdetonation of a thermonuclear device. Truman had been advised by his nationalsecurity team, which included Majestic 12 members and USAF Generals Vandenbergand Twining, to go ahead with the test despite the strong likelihood thatEisenhower’s election could lead to a radical overhaul of the nuclear weaponsprogram. Truman had been persuaded by Vandenberg and Twining to usher in the ageof hydrogen bombs, thereby ensuring US Air Force dominance over strategicnuclear bombing for decades to come through its long-range bombers and theimpending development of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (IBMs). This setthe stage for the Galactic Federation and the Antarctic German-DraconianAlliance to soon engage in face-to-face meetings with President Eisenhower.Negotiations to come would involve comprehensive agreements dealing with thecomplex issues of thermonuclear weapons, extraterrestrial contact, advancedtechnologies, and the public disclosure versus non-disclosure of the GermanAntarctic colony’s existence."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9President Eisenhower Meets with the Nordics:Nuclear Negotiations Go Awry “Great numbers of children will be born who understand electronics and atomicpower as well as other forms of energy. They will grow into scientists andengineers of a new age which has the power to destroy civilization unless welearn to live by spiritual laws.”― Edgar CayceAtoms for Peace – Eisenhower’s Overture to the Galactic FederationO n December 8, 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave his famous “Atoms forPeace” speech before the United Nations General Assembly, where he bravelyproposed dismantling America’s nuclear arsenal if the Soviet Union would onlyagree to do the same. He made a serious offer to place America’s nucleartechnology under the control of the United Nations to ensure that nuclear energywould be used in the future for peaceful purposes rather than weaponsdevelopment. Eisenhower’s proposal was daring and visionary. It was a bold steptowards world peace at a time of a rapidly expanding nuclear arms race with theSoviet Union, which had only four months previously (on August 12) detonated itsfirst thermonuclear device. [227] [text00029.html#_edn227] Given the eventsassociated with the 1952 Washington DC Flyover, there is a reason to believethat Eisenhower’s proposal was also intended as an overture to the GalacticFederation, which had made its position clear on the United States having toabandon its nuclear weapons development as a precursor to receivingtechnological assistance from human-looking extraterrestrial civilizations.Standing before the UN General Assembly, and witnessed by an audience that verylikely secretly included representatives of the Galactic Federation, Eisenhowersaid: The United States would seek more than a mere reduction or elimination of atomicmaterials for military purposes. It is not enough to take this weapon out of thehands of the soldiers. It must be put into the hands of those who will know howto strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace.The United States knows that if the fearful trend of atomic military build-upcan be reversed, this greatest of destructive forces can be developed into agreat boon, for the benefit of all mankind. The United States knows thatpeaceful power from atomic energy is no dream of the future. That capability,already proved, is here—now—today. Who can doubt, if the entire body of theworld’s scientists and engineers had adequate amounts of fissionable materialwith which to test and develop their ideas, that this capability would rapidlybe transformed into universal, efficient and economic usage?To hasten the day when fear of the atom will begin to disappear from the mindsof people and the governments of the East and West, there are certain steps thatcan be taken now. I therefore make the following proposal.The governments principally involved, to the extent permitted by elementaryprudence, begin now and continue to make joint contributions from theirstockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials to an internationalatomic energy agency.The United States is prepared to undertake these explorations in good faith. Anypartner of the United States acting in the same good faith will find the UnitedStates a not unreasonable or ungenerous associate. Undoubtedly, initial andearly contributions to this plan would be small in quantity. However, theproposal has the great virtue that it can be undertaken without the irritationsand mutual suspicions incident to any attempt to set up a completely acceptablesystem of world-wide inspection and control. [228] [text00029.html#_edn228] Given the tensions created by the Korean War (1950 - 1953) and the deepeningCold War divide, Eisenhower’s “Atoms for Peace” proposal was as much as could behoped for by any American President. Only someone like Eisenhower, a careermilitary five-star general, would prove confident and strong enough to ignorethe demands of powerful national security officials who were firmly intent onexpanding America’s nuclear arsenal no matter the financial cost and securityrisks involved. In particular, the Air Force Chief of Staff Nathan Twining andanalysts with the RAND Corporation were strongly in favor of creating astrategic nuclear bomber force equipped with thermonuclear weapons, which coulddevastate potential enemies in a first or second strike scenario anywhere onEarth. A senior RAND policy strategist, Bernard Brodie, wrote the first nuclearstrategy papers in 1953 which were widely adopted by the US national securityestablishment, a key part of the Deep State. [229] [text00029.html#_edn229]It is significant that the RAND Corporation was heavily involved in helping todevelop the nuclear strategy on behalf of the Air Force. As mentioned earlier,the RAND Corporation was initially set up to assist the former Army Air Force todevelop a comprehensive strategic response to extraterrestrial life and theGerman Antarctic presence. This meant that the development of thermonuclearweapons actually had less to do with any genuine national security threats posedby the Soviet Union, and had more to do with meeting potential future threats bythe Antarctic Germans or their extraterrestrial allies.Despite Eisenhower’s willingness to go against the advice of senior nationalsecurity officials with his Atoms for Peace proposal, the Soviet Unionsquandered the golden opportunity to set humanity on a path towards globalcooperation, peace, and open diplomatic relations with the Galactic Federation.General Secretary of the Communist Party Joseph Stalin had died on March 5,1953, and the Soviet Union had entered an uncertain period with no cleardesignated successor. Without a strong leader who could go against his militaryadvisers’ demands for nuclear weapons development, the Soviet Union was notprepared to seriously respond to Eisenhower’s “Atoms for Peace” proposal.Instead, the Soviet leadership chose to send mixed messages through its statemedia outlets before officially rejecting the proposal outright. [230][text00029.html#_edn230]There is little doubt that Eisenhower was genuinely opposed to nuclear weaponsproliferation and wanted to put the atomic genie back in the bottle. He wasespecially disturbed by the development of thermonuclear weapons which hispredecessor President Truman had approved for development and testing – thefirst of which occurred on November 1, 1952, only three days before Eisenhower’selection win: Eisenhower, the former general, understood the strategic necessity of a nucleararsenal but saw no need “for us to build enough destructive power to destroyeverything.” He didn’t fear the Soviets or their arsenal, but he worried that asatomic bombs became cheaper and more prevalent, they might be viewed as justanother conventional weapon waiting to be used. The deadlier hydrogen bomb onlyworried him more. [231] [text00029.html#_edn231] With his “Atoms for Peace” initiative spurned by the Soviets who would pressahead with their own thermonuclear weapons program, Eisenhower had little choicebut to back the USAF, the RAND Corporation, the Deep State, etc., and continuewith Truman’s policy for developing hydrogen bombs. The next upcoming milestoneon the United States’ nuclear weapons development calendar was the March 1,1954, scheduled test of a deliverable hydrogen bomb, a necessary step for theproof testing of a thermonuclear device. Called the “Castle Bravo” test, thisplanned detonation was to have a six megaton bomb yield, but it would turn outto be far more powerful with a 15 megaton yield. For the Galactic Federation,preventing this test represented one last opportunity to pull humanity back fromthe brink of a thermonuclear arms race that could result in global devastation.A face-to-face meeting between Nordics from the Galactic Federation and theEisenhower Administration was proposed and accepted.Eisenhower’s Secret Meeting with the Nordics In the late afternoon hours of February 20, 1954, while on a ‘vacation’ to PalmSprings, California, President Eisenhower went missing and did not reappearuntil the next morning. Whistleblowers allege that he was secretly brought toEdwards Air Force Base for a sensitive meeting which was never reported.Officially, when the President showed up the next morning at a church service inLos Angeles, reporters were told that he had simply been taken for an emergencydental treatment the previous evening. The disappearance fueled rumors thatEisenhower was using the fictitious dentist visit as a cover story for a highlyclassified event which took place at a nearby military facility. Thisclandestine engagement is possibly the most significant that any AmericanPresident could conduct – an alleged ‘First Contact’ meeting with human-lookingextraterrestrials at a US Air Force Base to negotiate over the country’s nuclearweapons program, technological assistance from the Galactic Federation andofficially disclosing the truth about the Nordic visitors.There is both circumstantial and testimonial evidence that Eisenhower did have ameeting in 1954 with extraterrestrials. What follows are some of thequestion-raising circumstances surrounding Eisenhower’s unscheduled wintervacation to Palm Springs, California, from February 17-24, 1954, which willlater be shown to corroborate what whistleblowers have revealed about a secretmeeting with Nordics that actually took place.First, in the latter part of the day on Saturday, February 20 PresidentEisenhower mysteriously vanished, fueling press speculation that he had takenill or even died. In a hastily convened press conference, Eisenhower’s presssecretary announced that the President had lost the cap from a tooth whileeating fried chicken and had been rushed to a local dentist. The local dentistwas introduced at an official function on Sunday, February 21 as \"the dentistwho had treated the President\". [232] [text00029.html#_edn232] Veteran UFOresearcher William Moore investigated the incident and concluded that thedentist’s visit was just a cover story for Eisenhower’s true whereabouts. [Image00033.jpg]Figure 28. Eisenhower’s Cover Story Second, it has been reported that President Eisenhower flew to nearby Norton AirForce Base where he disembarked and immediately boarded a C-45 airplane totravel to Edwards AFB (formerly Muroc Airfield) on the evening in question.According to Bill Kirklin, an Air Force medic stationed at the nearby GeorgiaAir Force Base, an ambulance was requested to stay on duty while personnel atNorton honored the visiting president. Kirklin claims that after Eisenhower’splane landed at Norton, he immediately got onto the C-45 to travel in thedirection of Palmdale, California, which is adjacent to Edwards AFB. [233][text00029.html#_edn233]Third, Edward’s AFB was closed for three days during the period of Eisenhower’sPalm Springs visit. Renowned UFO researcher Lt Col Wendelle Stevens wrote aboutthe base closure: Mead Lane, publisher of The \"Round Robin\" newsletter out of San Diego, had anarticle on the Eisenhower visit and the Muroc events of that time, in Februaryof 1954. He described a Los Angeles Times news reporter, getting wind of thestrange goings on at Muroc, who chartered a private airplane to take him toMuroc. That airplane was refused permission to land and was turned away becausethe base was closed to all air traffic. He then rented a car and drove to Muroc,to try to get in, but was turned away again at the base main gate because thatbase was closed. A number of researchers and former military personnel confirmedthat the base was closed to all servicemen who tried to enter or leave. Eventsof tremendous national security must have been occurring for Edwards to besuddenly closed without any prior warning to base personnel. [234][text00029.html#_edn234] Another whistleblower named Bill Holden revealed his own research into theclosure of Edwards Air Force Base during Eisenhower’s top secret 1954 visit: Now, history says that this is where he met the ETs and that an agreement wassigned between the U.S. and the ETs. And as far as that a mothership was seencoming in, there were a number of UFOs coming in, and that the base wasliterally shut down for 3 days. I have been able to find that the base was shutdown for 3 days. I've been able to find in civilian records, newspaper accounts,and everything else, as far as those facts were validated. [235][text00029.html#_edn235] Fourth, nine days after the alleged Edwards AFB meeting, the U.S. detonated itslargest ever hydrogen bomb test at the Bikini Atoll on March 1, 1954. CalledOperation Castle, this “Castle Bravo” test was the first in a series and at 15megatons, was 1000 times more powerful than the 15 kilotons atomic bombdetonation on Hiroshima. [236] [text00029.html#_edn236] Only the Soviet Unionhas ever exploded hydrogen bombs more powerful. This was the first hydrogen bombtest by the Eisenhower administration. Eisenhower’s decision to go ahead withthe Castle Bravo test was almost certainly linked to his trip to Californiaduring which he mysterious disappeared for the secret meeting at Edwards AFB onFebruary 20/21, 1954.According to the circumstantial evidence examined so far, we know that PresidentEisenhower was gone for an entire evening on February 20, and was reportedlytaken from Palm Springs to Edwards Air Force Base. The nature of the President’sunscheduled vacation, the incident of him vanishing, the dentist cover story,and his mysterious unrecorded flight to Palmdale only a week and a half beforethe first hydrogen bomb test all provide circumstantial evidence that the truepurpose of his Palm Springs visit was not to vacation, but to make history. Hewould participate in an event of unmatched importance, yet due to the sensitivecircumstances, it could not be disclosed to the general public.Whistleblowers and the Untold Story Fortunately, there are a number of sources discussing various details about theextraterrestrial meeting at Edwards Air Force Base which, taken together, helpto build a more complete picture of the actual events on February 20-21. Thesources about to be discussed are based upon the testimonies of whistleblowerswho witnessed events, read classified documents, saw undisclosed film footage orlearned from their ‘insider contacts’ of the meeting. Let’s begin with a formerrepresentative for the state of New Hampshire who provides important testimonythat Eisenhower received a briefing document that set the scene for a ‘FirstContact’ meeting. This whistleblower personally read the document, and thecontent he says it contained clearly indicates that Eisenhower was beingprepared by his national security advisors to meet with extraterrestrials todiscuss weighty topics.The former state representative, Henry W. McElroy, released a video statementrecorded on May 8, 2012, in Hampton, Virginia, revealing the content of a secretbrief he saw which had been prepared for President Eisenhower concerningextraterrestrial life. [237] [text00029.html#_edn237] McElroy, a Republican,served on various committees during his time in the New Hampshire statelegislature, and is best known for sponsoring a new “Gold Money” bill in 2004that aimed to restore the use of gold and silver coins in the Granite State.[238] [text00029.html#_edn238] He successfully ran for the Republican primaryfor State Representative in the 2008 elections but did not win re-election in2010. In his statement, McElroy claims that the brief revealed thatextraterrestrials were present in the United States, they were benevolent, and ameeting with them could be arranged for Eisenhower.McElroy explains in his statement that he saw the briefing document whileserving on New Hampshire’s “State Federal Relations and Veterans AffairsCommittee”. [239] [text00029.html#_edn239] In his official capacity at the time,McElroy says that he was regularly “updated on a large number of topics relatedto the affairs of our People, and our Nation.” [240] [text00029.html#_edn240] Hefurther identified the nature of the topics covered by the committee: As I understood it, some of those ongoing topics had been examined andcategorized as Federal, State, Local development, and security matters. Thesedocuments related to various topics some of which spanned decades of ournation’s history. [241] [text00029.html#_edn241] One of the topics being studied included an official one-page brief to PresidentEisenhower written by unknown national security specialists. McElroy states: I would like to submit to our nation my personal testimony of one documentrelated to one of these ongoing topics which I saw while in office, serving onthe State Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee. The document I sawwas an official brief to President Eisenhower. [242] [text00029.html#_edn242] McElroy’s account of the contents of the briefing document is startling: To the best of my memory, this brief was pervaded with a sense of hope, and itinformed President Eisenhower of the continued presence of extraterrestrialbeings here in the United States of America. The brief seemed to indicate that ameeting between the President and some of these visitors could be arranged asappropriate if desired. [243] [text00029.html#_edn243] According to the brief, the extraterrestrials were benevolent. The tone of the brief indicated to me that there was no need for concern, sincethese visitors were in no way, causing any harm, or had any intentions,whatsoever, of causing any disruption then, or in the future. [244][text00029.html#_edn244] As a retired state representative, McElroy’s testimony carries weight since heis a direct eyewitness to a document viewed during the course of his officialduties. His testimony supports the claims of other whistleblowers who havereported that President Eisenhower secretly traveled to Air Force facilities tohave meetings with representatives of one or more extraterrestrialcivilizations.Now I turn to the claims by whistleblowers who witnessed the alleged “FirstContact” meeting at Edwards. The son of a former Navy Commander attests that hisfather was present at the “First Contact” event on February 20-21, 1954.According to Charles L. Suggs, a retired sergeant from the US Marine Corps, hisfather Charles L. Suggs Sr. (1909-1987), a former Commander with the US Navy,attended the meeting at Edwards Air Force Base with Eisenhower. [245][text00029.html#_edn245] Sgt Suggs recounted his father’s experiences from themeeting in a 1991 interview with a prominent UFO researcher: Charlie's father, Navy Commander Charles Suggs accompanied Pres. Ike along withothers on Feb. 20th. They met and spoke with 2 white-haired Nordics that hadpale blue eyes and colorless lips. The spokesman stood a number of feet awayfrom Ike and would not let him approach any closer. A second Nordic stood on theextended ramp of a bi-convex saucer that stood on tripod landing gear on thelanding strip. According to Charlie, there were B-58 Hustlers on the field eventhough the first one did not fly officially till 1956. These visitors said theycame from another solar system. They posed detailed questions about our nucleartesting. [246] [text00029.html#_edn246] Suggs’ reference to human-looking Nordics is significant, as is the reference tonuclear testing. Again, it needs to be pointed out that the alleged Eisenhowerextraterrestrial meeting occurred nine days before the Castle Bravo test of a 15megaton hydrogen bomb. Suggs’ recollection suggests that due to the Nordicsalarm over the consequences of the US testing program, they initiated themeeting with Eisenhower.Another testimony concerning the Eisenhower-Extraterrestrial meeting comes froma former US Air Force test pilot and colonel who has chosen to remain anonymous,allegedly due to a secrecy oath. This pilot told the following details to LordClancarty, a member of the Irish aristocracy who has vouched for the source’sauthenticity: The pilot says he was one of six people at the meeting… Five alien craft landedat the base. Two were cigar-shaped and three were saucer-shaped. The alienslooked humanlike, but not exactly…. The aliens spoke English, and supposedlyinformed the President that they wanted to start an “educational program” forthe people of Earth… [247] [text00029.html#_edn247] Yet another anonymous military eyewitness, a US Air Force officer, revealed toformer Royal Air Force pilot Desmond Leslie that a flying saucer had landed atEdwards AFB. The witness told Leslie that President Eisenhower had been takenover to it: … a disc, estimated to be 100 feet in diameter, had landed on the runway on acertain day. Men returning from leave were suddenly not allowed back on thebase. The disc was allegedly housed under guard in Hangar 27, and Eisenhower wastaken to see it. [248] [text00029.html#_edn248] An important point to note is that the anonymous USAF officer referred to thebase being closed to returning personnel. This is circumstantial evidencesupporting previously presented testimony, and further confirms that highlyclassified activities were occurring at Edwards AFB over the period in question. [Image00034.jpg]Figure 29. 1982 British Newspaper story on Eisenhower–Extraterrestrial meeting. A similar account was given by an USAF air policeman stationed at Edwards AFB onthe night President Eisenhower visited. What follows is a summary of a phoneinterview with his widow that supports Leslie’s witness: Her deceased husband worked as an MP for the USAF in the 1950s and told her thathe was on guard duty at a secure hangar facility at Edwards Air Force baseduring the evening of February 20, 1954. He said that he saw PresidentEisenhower who was escorted inside the hangar. He was not aware of what occurredinside the hangar, and was under shoot-to-kill orders against any unauthorizedperson attempting to enter the facility. He stated that a flying saucer wasstored inside the hangar. [249] [text00029.html#_edn249] In his book, Need to Know , British UFO researcher Timothy Good refers toanother three eyewitness accounts of saucer-shaped craft seen near or landing atEdwards AFB on February 20, 1954. Good writes: Gabriel Green, an American researcher, spoke to a military officer who claims tohave witnessed the arrival of the craft at Muroc. At the time I was engaged infiring practice, under the command of a general, said the officer. “We wereshooting at a number of targets when suddenly five UFOs came flying overhead.The general ordered all the batteries to fire at the craft. We did so, but ourfire had no effect on them. We stopped firing and then we saw the UFOs land atone of the base’s big hangars.” Two other witnesses, Don Johnson and PaulUmbrello, also claim to have witnessed one of the disc-shaped craft near Murocon the evening of 20 February. [250] [text00029.html#_edn250] It is curious that Eisenhower would attend a meeting with extraterrestrialambassadors whose vehicles had been fired upon by base personnel earlier.Perhaps the general involved in artillery practice was following standing ordersto shoot at UFOs and was not aware of the scheduled meeting.More testimony comes from a Jesuit priest working within a Vatican intelligenceorganization, the Servizio Informazione del Vaticano (S.I.V.). Speakingconfidentially in 2001 to Cristoforo Barbato, an Italian UFO researcher, theJesuit confirmed that President Eisenhower met with extraterrestrials at MurocAir Base (renamed Edwards) in 1954. The Jesuit claims that a senior Catholicbishop, Francis MacIntyre, subsequently flew to Rome to brief Pope Pius XII andthat the S.I.V. was created as a consequence of Eisenhower’s meeting. Barbatowrites: According to this person the reason to establish [sic] the S.I.V. was themeeting with an Alien delegation at Muroc Air Field Base in February 1954 inpresence of president Dwight Eisenhower and James Francis McIntyre, bishop ofLos Angeles. After that incredible event McIntyre flew to Rome to refereverything to Pope Pius XII who decided to found the S.I.V with the aim to getevery possible information [sic] about Aliens and how they interacted with theAmerican Government. [251] [text00029.html#_edn251] Another Italian UFO researcher, Luca Scantamburlo, found circumstantial evidencesupporting the existence of the top secret Vatican organization “S.I.V.”, andthe “Omega” security classification the Jesuit claimed to possess. Heinterviewed Barbato and discovered more information about the alleged 1954meeting: The Jesuit member of the S.I.V. told Barbato that on occasion of the secretmeeting at Muroc Air Field Base, in 1954, military cameramen filmed theoutstanding event \"with three movie cameras (16 millimeters), detached indifferent places, loaded with color film and working by spring engines; thislast rather unconformable resolution, because it compelled every cameraman tochange reel every 3 minutes, it was necessary since in the presence of theAliens and of their spacecrafts, the electrical engines of the biggest moviecameras did not work. [252] [text00029.html#_edn252] Don Phillips is a former Air Force serviceman who was employed to work onclandestine aviation projects. He testified that he viewed a film and sawdocuments describing the 1954 meeting between President Eisenhower andextraterrestrials: We have records from 1954 that [there] were meetings between our own leaders ofthis country and ET’s here in California. And, as I understand it from thewritten documentation, we were asked if we would allow them to be here and doresearch. I have read that our reply was well, how can we stop you? You are soadvanced. And I will say by this camera and this sound, that it was PresidentEisenhower that had this meeting. [253] [text00029.html#_edn253] Philips’ reference to a film of the 1954 Eisenhower meeting is corroborated bythe testimony of the Jesuit priest who disclosed Vatican records concerning themeeting.Another version of Eisenhower’s meeting is described by William Cooper, whoserved in the Office of Naval Intelligence on a briefing team for the Commanderof the Pacific Fleet between 1970-1973. He had direct access to highlyclassified documents which he had to review to fulfill his briefing duties.Cooper’s military records confirm that he served in this sensitive position asclaimed. [254] [text00029.html#_edn254] This lends credence to the fact thatsome of his testimony is based on the US Navy’s secret knowledge of UFOs andextraterrestrial life. Two retired non-commissioned officers who becamewhistleblowers, Robert Dean and Daniel Salter, both claim Cooper had similaraccess to top secret UFO material as they themselves formerly had while workingrespectively within the intelligence divisions of the US Army and US Air Force.[255] [text00029.html#_edn255]Cooper describes the background and nature of the “First Contact” withextraterrestrials as follows: In 1953 Astronomers discovered large objects in space which were moving towardthe Earth. It was first believed that they were asteroids. Later evidence provedthat the objects could only be Spaceships. Project Sigma intercepted alien radiocommunications. When the objects reached the Earth they took up a very highorbit around the Equator. There were several huge ships, and their actual intentwas unknown. Project Sigma, and a new project, Plato, through radiocommunications using the computer binary language, was able to arrange a landingthat resulted in face to face contact with alien beings from another planet….Project Plato was tasked with establishing diplomatic relations with this raceof space aliens. [256] [text00029.html#_edn256] Part of Cooper’s testimony has been corroborated by Major Donald Keyhoe who alsowrote about giant spaceships tracked by the US Air Force in 1953, and theirefforts to cover this information up: Since 1953 it [the USAF] had known that giant spaceships were operating near ourplanet. At least nine times, huge alien spacecraft had been seen or tracked inorbit, or they descended nearer the Earth for brief periods. Each time it hadbeen an ordeal for the [US]AF censors, as they struggled to conceal the reportsor explain them away when attempts at secrecy failed. [257][text00029.html#_edn257] Further, Keyhoe discusses the US Air Force’s concern over its possible inabilityto debunk the public’s discovery of the giant spacecraft in the near future, andhow their debunking efforts would be further complicated by an official USAFarticle which had been circulated to members of the press. Although this articlehad not been printed by any newspaper due to Air Force restrictions denyingpress the ability to name the author or its official origin, there was the fearthat it could resurface if the spacecraft story broke. That article was entitled“Planet Earth – Host to Extraterrestrial Life”, and described the likelymotivations of the extraterrestrial visitors: If the “moonlet” cover up failed, the true spaceship answer might emerge as theonly alternative. If it did, this could revive a disturbing article on possiblealien migration to our world…. The article had been written by a high AFIntelligence officer – Col. W.C. Odell…. it had been cleared by AF Security andReview…. According to his theory, alien beings from a dying planet wereconsidering and surveying our world as a new home – a planet similar enough totheir own so that they could survive here and perpetuate their race. [258][text00029.html#_edn258] Keyhoe is pointing out that Colonel Odell was permitted by his superiors to makepublic classified information concerning what had been learned throughcommunications with the extraterrestrials or possibly theorized about them basedon their data. Keyhoe’s testimony strengthens Cooper’s claim that a highlyclassified radio communications program, “Project Plato”, had been used toestablish diplomatic relations.Cooper goes on to describe the efforts of a different extraterrestrial groupwarning about the motivations of the extraterrestrials in the giant spacecraftorbiting the Earth, who according to Odell’s article wanted to establishcolonies: In the meantime a race of human looking aliens contacted the U.S. Government.This alien group warned us against the aliens that were orbiting the Equator andoffered to help us with our spiritual development. They demanded that wedismantle and destroy our nuclear weapons as the major condition. They refusedto exchange technology citing that we were spiritually unable to handle thetechnology which we then possessed. They believed that we would use any newtechnology to destroy each other. This race stated that we were on a path ofself destruction and we must stop killing each other, stop polluting the Earth,stop raping the Earth's natural resources, and learn to live in harmony. Theseterms were met with extreme suspicion, especially the major condition of nucleardisarmament. It was believed that meeting that condition would leave us helplessin the face of an obvious alien threat. We also had nothing in history to helpwith the decision. Nuclear disarmament was not considered to be within the bestinterest of the United States. The overtures were rejected on the grounds thatit would be foolish to disarm in the face of such an uncertain future. [259][text00029.html#_edn259] The critical point about Cooper’s testimony here is that the human-looking“Nordics”, certainly belonging to the Galactic Federation, were not willing toenter into technology exchanges that might help weapons development and insteadfocused upon spiritual development as a precursor. [260][text00029.html#_edn260] Again, the emphasis on nuclear disarmament mentioned bythe extraterrestrials is significant, due to the Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb testscheduled nine days after Eisenhower’s alleged meeting. Most importantly, theovertures made by the Nordics were turned down, but not without a tremendouspolicy debate splitting the Eisenhower administration.The source who has revealed the most about this bitter policy debate is GeraldLight. In a letter dated April 16, 1954, to Meade Layne, then director ofBorderland Sciences Research Associates (now the Borderland Sciences ResearchFoundation), Light claimed he was part of a delegation of community leaders whotook part in a meeting between US government officials and extraterrestrials atEdwards Air Force Base. [261] [text00029.html#_edn261] The meeting involvedPresident Eisenhower and its timing corresponded to the President’s February 20disappearance from Palm Springs. The purported purpose of Light and others inthe delegation was to test public reaction to the presence of extraterrestrials.Light, according to Meade Layne, was a “gifted and highly educated writer andlecturer” who was skilled both in clairvoyance and the occult. [262][text00029.html#_edn262] Light described the circumstances of the meeting asfollows: My dear friends: I have just returned from Muroc [Edwards Air Force Base]. Thereport is true -- devastatingly true! I made the journey in company withFranklin Allen of the Hearst papers and Edwin Nourse of Brookings Institute(Truman's erstwhile financial advisor) and Bishop MacIntyre of L.A.(confidential names for the present, please). When we were allowed to enter therestricted section (after about six hours in which we were checked on everypossible item, event, incident and aspect of our personal and public lives), Ihad the distinct feeling that the world had come to an end with fantasticrealism. For I have never seen so many human beings in a state of completecollapse and confusion, as they realized that their own world had indeed endedwith such finality as to beggar description. The reality of the ‘other plane’aeroforms is now and forever removed from the realms of speculation and made arather painful part of the consciousness of every responsible scientific andpolitical group. During my two days' visit I saw five separate and distincttypes of aircraft being studied and handled by our Air Force officials -- withthe assistance and permission of the Etherians [Nordics]!I have no words to express my reactions. It has finally happened. It is now amatter of history. President Eisenhower, as you may already know, was spiritedover to Muroc one night during his visit to Palm Springs recently. And it is myconviction that he will ignore the terrific conflict between the various'authorities' and go directly to the people via radio and television – if theimpasse continues much longer. From what I could gather, an official statementto the country is being prepared for delivery about the middle of May. [263][text00029.html#_edn263] In his letter, Gerald Light pointed to a “terrific conflict between the various'authorities'”. What is being suggested here is that proponents of a continuednuclear policy involving thermonuclear weapons, led by USAF Chief of StaffNathan Twining, directly clashed with Eisenhower who had been willing tonegotiate away America’s nuclear dominance with his 1953 “Atoms for Peace”proposal. Putting America’s nuclear technology under the auspices of the UnitedNations was firmly opposed by the US Air Force, RAND policy strategists, and thenational security establishment. This is where Light’s reference to Eisenhowergoing directly “to the people via radio and television” becomes significant.Apparently, Eisenhower was ready to disclose the truth about theextraterrestrial visitors and their concerns over the nation’s nuclear weaponspolicy.Of course, no such formal announcement was made, and Light’s description of theEisenhower meeting with Nordics has either been the best-kept secret of thetwentieth century or the fabrication of an elderly mystic known for hisout-of-body experiences. The events Light described in his meeting regarding thepanic and confusion of many of those present, the emotional impact of thealleged landing, the tremendous difference of opinion on what to do in terms oftelling the public, and the disputed question of how to respond to theextraterrestrial visitors, are all plausible descriptions of what may haveoccurred. Indeed, the psychological and emotional impact Light describedsurrounding the senior national security leaders at the meeting is consistentwith what could be expected in the face of such a ‘life-changing event’involving a policy debate over nuclear weapons. [264] [text00029.html#_edn264]The main take away from the failed diplomatic negotiations between the Nordicsand the Eisenhower administration was the insurmountable precondition: in orderfor any technological assistance to be given, the United States had to abandonits nuclear weapons development program. While President Eisenhower himself wasprepared to take such a step, it was not acceptable to the USAF, the nationalsecurity establishment or the Deep State. These entities not only wanted topursue nuclear weapons development, they also wanted to receive technologicalassistance from the Nordics which could be used to develop improved weapondelivery systems. Presumably, the USAF justified their position based upon thelong-term threat posed by the Antarctic Germans and their Draconian allies.While the Air Force had strategic bomber fleets at its disposal and was in theprocess of developing Intercontinental Ballistic Missile systems (ICBMs), theirultimate goal was to develop their own fleets of spacecraft that could be usedfor multiple purposes. Included in this category was the ability to deliverthermonuclear weapons in any future confrontation with extraterrestrials,especially the German-Draco alliance. While the Nordics fully understood thethreats posed by the German-Draco alliance, they nevertheless were not preparedto hand over advanced technologies that would only fuel the USAF’s plans tobuild more powerful nuclear weapons and delivery systems. The Nordics did notwant to repeat those mistakes which had led to the destruction of the planetthat once occupied the asteroid belt (Maldek/Lucifer/Tiamat), and caused thedestruction of the civilization on Mars.As shown in General Twinings’ “White Hot Report”, the Truman administrationunderstood that an agreement had to be reached with extraterrestrials to reapthe benefits of the retrieved flying saucer technologies that the USAF wasstudying at its Wright Patterson facilities. If the Nordics weren’t willing toreach a technology exchange agreement, then the Eisenhower administration andthe USAF would have to go elsewhere. The Edwards AFB meeting was soon followedby others, including one at Holloman Air Force Base in February 1955. TheHolloman meeting laid the foundation for agreements to be reached finally, butwith the German-Draco alliance which, unlike the Nordics, did not demand thatthe Eisenhower administration abandon its thermonuclear weapons development.Instead, this German-Draco group offered technology exchange agreements whichwere deemed vital by US leaders for unlocking the secrets of their prizedretrieved craft, which would make possible a future USAF secret space program."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10Extraterrestrial & German Delegations at Holloman AFB Beware that you do not lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.– AesopO n February 10, 1955, President Dwight Eisenhower flew on Air Force One fromWashington DC to Thomasville, Georgia, for a “hunting vacation”. He wasaccompanied by a chartered plane filled with the press. Later that afternoonafter landing, Eisenhower disappeared from press view for the next 36 hours.James Hagerty, his press secretary, told reporters that ‘Ike’ and his valet were\"treating a case of the sniffles...” [265] [text00029.html#_edn265] In reality,according to several eyewitnesses, the president had secretly traveled toHolloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, on February 11 to meet with the occupantsof a landed flying saucer involved in the 1952 Washington DC flyover.The Holloman meeting occurred almost one year after the February 20, 1954,meeting at Edwards, during which human-looking Nordic extraterrestrialsattempted to dissuade the Eisenhower administration from developingthermonuclear weapons. The Nordics had also warned Eisenhower about anothergroup of extraterrestrials who would come seeking to make an agreement. [266][text00029.html#_edn266] This group could have been either the Grayextraterrestrials associated with the Roswell Crash or the Draco Reptilians whohad helped Nazi Germany establish a breakaway colony in Antarctica during WorldWar II.The Nordic outreach was rejected by the Eisenhower administration because of thevisitors’ precondition that thermonuclear weapons development needed to ceasebefore any technology exchange discussions could begin. Eisenhower was open tosuch an arrangement as he had proved with his “Atoms for Peace” proposal. Sadly,however, the Soviets had declined. The Nordic’s precondition was whollyunacceptable to Eisenhower’s senior national security officials who now hadgained the upper hand with the Soviet rejection. The Air Force was especiallyopposed because it had ambitious plans to expand its strategic nuclear bombingcapacity through new aerospace technologies made possible by rocket developmentsand captured extraterrestrial technologies. The USAF was intent on reaching anagreement with any group, extraterrestrial or not, that could help it unlock thesecrets of the retrieved flying saucers that were being studied at WrightPatterson AFB. This opened the door for agreements to be reached with both theGray aliens involved in the Roswell Crash and the Antarctic Germans allied withthe Draco Reptilians.There are compelling eyewitness and whistleblower testimonies affirming thatPresident Eisenhower did secretly travel to Holloman AFB to meet with theoccupants of a landed flying saucer, and that at least one previous meeting hadoccurred at Holloman with members of his administration and senior USAFofficers. According to information from different sources, the meetings atHolloman respectively involved “Tall Gray” extraterrestrials and Antarctic-basedGermans. The USAF and the Eisenhower administration were exploring possiblepartners for a technology assistance deal that could help develop viableantigravity spacecraft and other advanced technologies. In determining whoexactly Eisenhower met with, when, and what was agreed upon, it’s worthbeginning with eyewitness reports of the events that occurred at Holloman onFebruary 11, 1955.Eyewitness Accounts at Holloman UFO researcher Art Campbell has investigated the secret Eisenhower trip toHolloman and the meeting that occurred there in great detail. [267][text00029.html#_edn267] He was able to track down several eyewitnesses andinterviewed them or family members. One of the eyewitnesses was a former USAFmedic named Bill Kirklin, who from March 1, 1954, until August 5, 1955, wasstationed at the Holloman Air Force Base hospital. He wrote a paper describingwhat happened, which Campbell passed on to me in December 2005. [268][text00029.html#_edn268] After subsequently interviewing Kirklin, I receivedhis DD214 and military service records directly from the US National Archivesconfirming that he was stationed at Holloman just as he claimed. The documents(see Figure 30) prove that he was an eyewitness to the extraordinary eventssurrounding President Eisenhower’s secret visit there on February 11, 1955. Itis worth examining Kirklin’s testimony closely to see what actually occurredthere and what he heard from others at the base. [Image00035.jpg]Figure 30. Bill Kirklin's Service Record showing he was stationed at HollomanAFB from March 1, 1954 to August 5, 1955 Kirklin says he received prior notification of an impending visit by Eisenhowerin February 1955. He wrote in his paper: … we heard that the president was coming to Holloman. I knew there was going tobe an honor parade for him. Captain Reiner asked me if I wanted to participatein the parade. I said, \"No.\" He said, \"Fine. You will be on duty.\" The Paradewas scheduled for early in the morning. The day before it was to take place itwas called off. [269] [text00029.html#_edn269] At the end of the day of Eisenhower’s visit, Kirklin reports that he saw AirForce One leave the base and fly over a restricted area: After work I was in my barracks room when I was called out to see Air Force Onefly overhead. It flew over the residential area of the base. This is a NO FLYINGzone for all military aircraft. Only the President could get away with it. [270][text00029.html#_edn270] The above is compelling eyewitness testimony that Eisenhower was notrecuperating in Georgia as his press secretary falsely claimed to the press.Instead, Eisenhower was secretly over 2000 miles away at Holloman Air ForceBase. Various aspects of Eisenhower’s actual encounter with UFOs and theiroccupants are also revealed by Kirklin and other eyewitnesses.Kirklin claims that he heard several people commenting on the flying saucersthat had arrived at Holloman AFB during Eisenhower’s visit. He also says he hadan exchange about the craft with a colleague named Dorsey: “Kirklin, did you see the disc hovering over the flight line?\"“No.” I am thinking something small you hold in your hand like a discus as theonly craft I knew capable of hovering were the choppers and the Navy'shovercraft. There weren't that many helicopters around Holloman. \"What's it madeof?\" I am thinking of a wooden disc with a steel edge. \"Looks like polishedstainless steel or aluminum. You know just bright metallic and shiny.\"I asked, \"How big is it?\"\"Twenty to Thirty feet in diameter. Do you want to see it?\"\"Sure. But with my luck it wouldn't be there.\"Dorsey replied. “It was there when I took my wife to the Commissary and it wasthere when we got out thirty minutes later. Go out to the front of the hospitaland take a look.” [271] [text00029.html#_edn271] If Kirklin’s account of what his colleague saw is correct, then at least oneflying saucer was hovering over the flight line of the base for at least 30minutes during Eisenhower’s visit. Later Kirklin heard more when he went to the mess hall: On the way back I followed two pilots. The one on the left was in Khakis, theone on the right in winter Blues. I followed them and listened to theirconversation.Left: \"Why the Blues?\"Right: \"I'm the Officer of the Day, I was at Base Ops when Air Force 1 came in.Did you see it?\"L. \"Yes. It's a big bird isn't it?\"R \"Yes. They landed and turned around and stayed on the active runway. We turnedoff the RADAR and waited.\"L. \"Why did you turn off the RADAR?\"R. \"Because we were told to. I think the one at Roswell that came down was hitby Doppler Radar. It was one of the first installations to have it in the U.S.Anyway, they came in low over the mountains, across the Proving Grounds.Interrupted by L. \" I heard there were three and one landed at the Monument.\"R \"One might have stayed at the Monument. I didn't see it. I only saw two. Onehovered overhead like it was protecting the other one. The other one landed onthe active [runway] in front of his plane. He got out of his plane and wenttowards it. A door opened and he went inside for forty or forty-five minutes.\"L. \"Could you see? Were they Grays?\"R. \"I don't know. They might have been. I couldn't see them. I didn't havebinoculars.” …L. \"Do you think these were the same ones that were in Palmdale last year?\"R. \"They might have been.\" …R. \"It might have been. I just don't know.\"L. \"Did you see them when he came out?\"R. \"No. They stayed inside. He shook hands with them and went back to hisplane.\" Importantly, these two pilots reveal that Eisenhower disembarked from Air ForceOne and met with the occupants of the flying saucer that had landed at the endof the flight line for at least 45 minutes. It’s interesting that one of thepilots speculated about the occupants being Gray extraterrestrials but wasn’tsure. It’s also significant that the pilots referred to the Palmdale (EdwardsAFB) meeting in February 1954 as being connected, indicating that knowledge ofwhat had happened there was widespread in the Air Force officer ranks. Perhapsmost noteworthy is the handshakes at the end of the meeting. These indicate thatan understanding or an agreement had been reached with the saucer’s occupants.As I will reveal, this is indeed what happened on that day.The family of a base electrician who had worked at Holloman and witnessed aflying saucer approach the area where Air Force One was positioned latercontacted UFO researcher Art Campbell. He was given a letter by the family fromthe electrician explaining what had happened: So the day the President came we went out in the truck to a job where we werereplacing some wire down the flight line.... So we heard the President’s planein the morning lining up for an approach and watched it land on the far runway.So we waited for it to taxi over to the flight line so we could see him, but wedidn’t hear it anymore. It had shut down somewhere out there … one of the men …said he can see out there from that pole over there, so why don’t one of us goup the pole and see where the plane is? Well I had one of my climbers on and …started up with my back to the sun, a safety measure, which also put my back tothe runway where we thought his Connie was. Connie was a nickname for the bigConstellation the President flew…. A few minutes later ... I could not believewhat I saw. There was this pie tin like thing coming at me about 150 feet away.I thought it was remote controlled or something. 25 to 30 feet across and Istarted down the pole as fast as I could go…. While I was running towards thebig hangar I looked back and it had stopped and it was just sitting there. [272][text00029.html#_edn272] The electrician’s story is very revealing since it is additional eyewitnesstestimony that Eisenhower’s Air Force One plane had landed at the end of theflight line and was waiting to be met by the arriving flying saucer.A third eyewitness is an airman whose plane was delayed at Holloman AFB on themorning of Eisenhower’s arrival to the base. The airman, Staff Sergeant Wykoff,related what happened in an interview with Campbell: We had to haul a load of stuff down there. Parts that they needed, and therunway is like this. I [had] never seen anything like that before. And anyway aswe were there we saw Air Force One come in, and we didn’t know who it was. Andthen an officer comes around and said you can’t leave. The pilot said we have toleave. And he said well President Eisenhower is here and you can’t leave thefield until he’s gone. And I said, you can hear it over loud speakers, but itdidn’t do any good. I would have liked to have seen him... We didn’t have theclearance to go into the mess hall and one of the other officers, a higherranking officer came [over] to us and said would you like to go in and eat, andlisten to his speech. And most of us said yes, because I’d like to see him. Ididn’t get to shake his hand or anything, because I didn’t have the right badge,clearance to go in, but they did let us go in at the very end and we ate andlistened to his speech. [273] [text00029.html#_edn273] SSgt Wykoff is another eyewitness who actually observed Eisenhower’s secretarrival at Holloman for an undisclosed purpose. The classified nature ofEisenhower’s activities is revealed by Bill Kirklin who recalled base personnelbeing taken into a large hangar and debriefed in groups of 225. [274][text00029.html#_edn274] In addition to the three eyewitness accounts, thereare also whistleblower testimonies detailing what they learned and read inbriefing documents about the secret meetings at Holloman.Agreement with Gray Extraterrestrials William Cooper has supplied documents proving that he worked on the intelligencebriefing team of the commander of the US Pacific Fleet from 1970 to 1973. Duringthis period he claims he “saw and read” classified material marked “TopSecret/MAJIC”, which he subsequently discussed in papers, lectures and anunderground best-selling book, Behold a Pale Horse . [275][text00029.html#_edn275] Cooper says that he learned from the briefing documentsthat an agreement had been reached at Holloman after the failure of an earliermeeting. Cooper gave a date prior to Eisenhower’s February 1955 visit, therebysuggesting that there may have been two different groups meeting with PresidentEisenhower and/or officials from his administration to work out an agreement.[276] [text00029.html#_edn276]This makes sense since in addition to the Nordics and the German-Reptilianalliance in Antarctica there were other alien visitors. For example, theoccupants of the Roswell crash, the Grays, appeared to be an independent aliengroup with their own distinct agenda. Cooper, in fact, identified the Grays asthe group that Eisenhower met first after the failed Nordic negotiations: Later in 1954 the race of large nosed Gray Aliens which had been orbiting theEarth landed at Holloman Air Force Base. A basic agreement was reached. Thisrace identified themselves as originating from a Planet around a red star in theConstellation of Orion which we called Betelgeuse. They stated that their planetwas dying and that at some unknown future time they would no longer be able tosurvive there. [277] [text00029.html#_edn277] Cooper’s reference to a landing at Holloman in 1954 immediately raises thequestion of whether he had merely mistaken the year and was really referring tothe February 1955 encounter. However, Cooper doesn’t refer to Eisenhower beingpresent at the 1954 Holloman meeting; he only states that a “basic agreement”had been reached with Tall Gray aliens.It’s helpful to recall from Bill Kirklin’s account of the two USAF pilots’conversation that they weren’t sure who Eisenhower had met with during hisFebruary 1955 visit to Holloman, only that he went alone into the flying saucercraft and emerged after shaking hands with occupants inside the craft. It’s veryunlikely that Eisenhower would have entered alone if the meeting had involvedthe signing of a formal agreement. Eisenhower’s behavior was more suggestive ofa face-to-face diplomatic meeting to establish an understanding, which in turnwould lead to an agreement down the road once aides had worked out the details.The earlier 1954 meeting that Cooper had referred to may have involved the“large-nosed Gray Aliens” in a parallel set of negotiations during which a basicagreement had been reached.Cooper explained the terms of the agreement and subsequent treaty reached withthe Gray extraterrestrials at Holloman sometime later in 1954 as follows: The treaty stated that the aliens would not interfere in our affairs and wewould not interfere in theirs. We would keep their presence on earth a secret.They would furnish us with advanced technology and would help us in ourtechnological development. They would not make any treaty with any other Earthnation. They could abduct humans on a limited and periodic basis for the purposeof medical examination and monitoring of our development, with the stipulationthat the humans would not be harmed, would be returned to their point ofabduction, would have no memory of the event, and that the alien nation wouldfurnish Majesty [sic] Twelve with a list of all human contacts and abductees ona regularly scheduled basis. [278] [text00029.html#_edn278] Cooper’s account of the agreement’s content shows that it involved the highlysought technology transfer program at a price the administration was this timewilling to pay. in exchange for this technology, the Grays would be given accessto humans for biological experiments. Interestingly, the agreement made nodemand for the dismantling of the thermonuclear weapons program that theEisenhower administration was pursuing, which the Nordics had made aprecondition for preceding with the pursuit of a further agreement ontechnological assistance. If Cooper is correct, then the USAF got a commitmentfrom the Gray extraterrestrials for transfers of technology that could directlyhelp the research and development efforts underway at Wright Patterson AFBinvolving retrieved extraterrestrial craft.Another whistleblower source concerning an agreement having been made in themid-1950’s with ‘Tall Gray’ aliens is Phil Schneider, a former geologicalengineer who was employed by the US military and major corporations to buildunderground bases including one at Dulce, New Mexico. [279][text00029.html#_edn279] He worked extensively on highly classified constructionprojects, some of which involved extraterrestrials. Schneider revealed his ownknowledge of the extraterrestrial agreement as follows: [U]nder the Eisenhower administration, the federal government decided tocircumvent the Constitution of the United States and form a treaty with alienentities. It was called the … Greada Treaty, which basically made the agreementthat the aliens involved could take a few cows and test their implantingtechniques on a few human beings, but that they had to give details about thepeople involved. [280] [text00029.html#_edn280] Schneider’s knowledge of the alleged “Greada Treaty” would have come from hisfamiliarity with a range of compartmentalized black projects and hisinteractions with other personnel working with extraterrestrials. Like Cooper,Schneider said the treaty involved biological experiments on abducted humans whowould be returned unharmed, only this time the extraterrestrials would providedetails about the people they abducted to US authorities. Schneider went on todescribe the extraterrestrials as Tall Grays which he personally had encounteredin a firefight at the underground Dulce base in 1979.Yet another whistleblower source for an agreement being signed is Dr. MichaelWolf, who claims he worked for twenty-five years as a scientist as well asserving on various policy-making committees responsible for extraterrestrialaffairs. [281] [text00029.html#_edn281] Wolf’s testimony has been investigatedby a number of veteran UFO researchers who found him to be credible. [282][text00029.html#_edn282] He claims that the Eisenhower administration enteredinto a treaty with an extraterrestrial race from Zeta Reticulum, “the Grays”’,and that this treaty was never ratified as constitutionally required: In the 1950s-1960s, the U.S. administration entered into classified agreementdiscussions with the Zetas (so-called Greys) from the fourth planet of the starsystem Zeta Reticuli, and other star peoples, but these agreements were neverratified as Constitutionally required. The Zetas shared certain of theirtechnological advances with government scientists, apparently often whileprisoner \"guests\" within secure underground military installations in Nevada,New Mexico and elsewhere. [283] [text00029.html#_edn283] Wolf’s information points to a series of meetings and negotiations between Grayextraterrestrials and the Eisenhower and subsequent presidentialadministrations.Finally, there is the testimony of Lt Col Phillip Corso, who served on a keyintelligence committee that reported to President Eisenhower’s National SecurityCouncil. Corso was a liaison for then Major General Arthur Trudeau who had justbeen appointed as Chief of Army Intelligence (G-2) in 1954. Corso had previouslyserved in Army Intelligence under Trudeau and had impressed the general so muchthat Trudeau brought Corso with him to Washington DC in 1954 to fulfill animportant assignment. Corso’s service record (DA-66) confirms that he served asthe Army Intelligence staff officer for the Operations Coordinating Board fromFebruary 1954 to June 1956. The Operations Coordinating Board was aninter-services board that had been created in 1953 by an Executive Order fromPresident Eisenhower. [284] [text00029.html#_edn284]The Operations Coordinating Board dealt with covert operations from all USdepartments and agencies and was, therefore, a key committee used by theMajestic 12 Group to implement its policy decisions concerning extraterrestriallife and the Antarctic German space program. During his two years on theOperations Coordinating Board, Corso would have learned about the secretmeetings and agreements that occurred from 1954 to 1955 and reported on them toTrudeau and US Army Intelligence.A close up of text on a white background Description generated with highconfidence [Image00036.gif]Figure 31. Col Philip Corso's Service Record shows he served on the OperationsCoordinating Board With his direct access to classified information about extraterrestrialintrusions into US air space, the deliberations of the Majestic 12 Group, andthe operations of the Army’s Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, Corso was able tolearn the truth about the secret meetings and agreements. In his book, The DayAfter Roswell , Corso referred to a secret agreement reached in the 1950’s withthe Grays: These creatures weren’t benevolent alien beings who had come to enlighten humanbeings. They were genetically altered humanoid automatons, cloned biologicalentities actually, who were harvesting biological specimens on Earth for theirown experimentation. As long as we were incapable of defending ourselves, we hadto allow them to intrude as they wished. And that was part of what the workinggroup [MJ-12] had to deal with. We had negotiated a kind of surrender with themas long as we couldn’t fight them. They dictated the terms because they knewwhat we most feared was disclosure. [285] [text00029.html#_edn285] Corso’s acknowledgment that “we couldn’t fight them” suggests that the advancedtechnologies of the extraterrestrial vehicles were too much for the US military,particularly the USAF which had unsuccessfully implemented an intercept andshoot down policy with disastrous consequences ever since the May 1947 WhiteSands missile tests.Based on the whistleblower accounts of Cooper, Schneider, Wolf, and Corso,agreements had first been reached with Tall Gray extraterrestrials after thefailed meeting with the Nordics in February 1954. Holloman Air Force baseappears to have been adopted as the preferred site for these secret meetings, nodoubt due to its close proximity to White Sands Proving Ground where ballisticmissiles were being developed with the aid of German scientists from OperationPaperclip. But it was not just Gray aliens involved in secret negotiations withthe Eisenhower administration in the mid-1950’s. According to otherwhistleblower accounts, a meeting on February 11, 1955, at Holloman Air ForceBase involved Germans from Antarctica.Agreement Reached with the Antarctic Germans Former spacecraft operator, Clark McClelland extensively interacted with Germanscientists such as Dr. Werner von Braun, Dr. Kurt Debus, and many others whileworking at NASA facilities in Florida. McClelland describes what Dr. ErnstSteinhoff, another German scientist brought to the U.S. under OperationPaperclip, told him about the Holloman Air Force Base visit by Eisenhower. Atthe time of the secret meeting, Steinhoff was visiting Holloman because of hispending transfer there. Dr. Steinhoff … did say, [he] was there during what was called a surprise visitby USA President Eisenhower who flew in with no early notice of those I spokewith that worked there…. The base United States Air Force Officer that managedHolloman, Colonel Sharp, did have prior knowledge of his arrival but not all whoworked there…. It was a big surprise to all others who saw his large plane land…[286] [text00029.html#_edn286] This account is consistent with what Kirklin and others have said aboutEisenhower arriving at Holloman in a surprise visit.McClelland went on to say that Steinhoff told him that the meeting at Hollomaninvolved Germans from a secret space program which had been established in SouthAmerica and Antarctica: It was a German Flying Saucer that he [Steinhoff] and others saw at this base.President Eisenhower, being from German heritage realized that when he was metby a German officer as he boarded that Saucer. The President then realized whynone came forth to greet him as he entered that German advanced flying machine.[287] [text00029.html#_edn287] What McClelland learned here is a stunning admission – it was Antarctic Germanspace program personnel that had landed one of their vehicles at Holloman onFebruary 11, 1955, not Gray extraterrestrials as previously believed. [288][text00029.html#_edn288]McClelland also points out the connection between the German craft that landedat Holloman and those that overflew Washington DC in July 1952: I recall something I heard Dr. Kurt Debus say to Dr. Knoth, the Senior Scientistat KSC [Kennedy Space Center], as I entered his office one day. He was speakingof a V-7 craft and my entrance startled both of them. I apologized for walkingin on them. Dr. Debus said it was “OK, Clark” to me. Later, I discovered throughanother German Scientist that the V-7 was the code name for a German Saucershaped craft that was developed below the South Pole Ice Cap. The same type thatoverflew Washington, DC and startled President Truman and the Pentagon Chiefs in1952. [289] [text00029.html#_edn289] It’s worth emphasizing that the former Nazi scientists working at NASA hadknowledge of the German space program operating out of Antarctica and knew thatit was applying political pressure to US leaders through overflights of majorcities such as Washington DC. According to McClelland, this appeared to bewidespread information among German scientists, thereby raising the question ofthe political allegiance of the 1500 or more former Nazis who had been broughtto the U.S. under Operation Paperclip. [290] [text00029.html#_edn290] It’shighly likely that some, if not the majority of the German scientists, werefifth columnists for the Antarctica-based colony that was actively infiltratingthe US Military-Industrial Complex.William Tompkins has also confirmed that the Holloman meeting involved PresidentEisenhower conducting negotiations with the breakaway German Antarctica colony.In an April 30, 2017, interview, I asked Tompkins directly about the meeting: Salla: [#26] Did Antarctica-based Nazi spacecraft land at Holloman Air Forcebase in February 1955 to meet with President Eisenhower?Tompkins: And I have to say on #26 that’s a YES also. Essentially, Eisenhoweraccepted like a defeat in the war without it actually being that. There wasreally nothing he could do, like it’s really [a] one-sided situation.Salla: So, basically, it was a negotiated surrender.Tompkins: Yeah. Like he lost that war. He surrendered. [291][text00029.html#_edn291] Significantly, other whistleblowers claim that the agreement secretly reachedduring the Eisenhower administration was a negotiated surrender. This includesPhilip Corso who stated that we “had negotiated a kind of surrender with them aslong as we couldn’t fight them”. [292] [text00029.html#_edn292] While Corso’sbook focused on a cover-up of extraterrestrial life, making it logical to assumethat the negotiated surrender was with off-world visitors, Corso made clear thatthere was a connection between the visitors and the flying saucer program thathad been created by Nazi Germany. Consequently, when Corso spoke of a negotiatedsurrender with extraterrestrials, he was aware of a link connecting the Germansas well. Based on the similarities of the craft that crashed at Roswell incomparison with the prototypes developed in Nazi Germany, Corso wrote: Twining had suggested the crescent shaped craft look so uncomfortably like theGerman Horten wings our flyers had seen at the end of the war that he had tosuspect the Germans had bumped into something we didn’t know about. And hisconversation with Werner von Braun and Willy Ley at Alamogordo in the days afterthe crash confirmed this. They didn’t want to be thought of as verruckt [insane]but intimated that there was a deep story about what the Germans had engineered.No, the similarity between the Horten wing and the craft that had pulled out ofthe arroyo was no accident. We always wondered how the Germans were able toincorporate such advanced technology into their weapons develop[ed] in so shorta time during the Great Depression. Did they have help? Maybe we were now aslucky as the Germans and broke off a piece of their technology for ourselves.[293] [text00029.html#_edn293] Consequently, the negotiated surrender that Tompkins and Corso have referred toinvolved different extraterrestrial groups, along with the Antarctic Germans,imposing unfavorable terms on the Eisenhower administration in a series ofagreements reached at secret USAF locations such as Holloman beginning in1954/1955. Corey Goode also claims that an unfavorable agreement had beenreached with the German Antarctic colony in the mid-1950’s, enabling them toaccelerate their infiltration efforts of the US Military-Industrial Complexthrough Operation Paperclip. [294] [text00029.html#_edn294]The USAF was at the epicenter of the agreements reached with the Grayextraterrestrials and German-Draco alliance. The USAF was hoping to developadvanced aerospace technologies derived from the retrieved alien spacecraft fromthe Los Angeles Air Raid, Roswell, and other incidents. The ultimate goal forthe Air Force was to gain the necessary advanced technology assistance tounderstand and reverse engineer the captured extraterrestrial craft so thatmajor US aerospace corporations could build future fleets of antigravityspacecraft. As far as the Germans were concerned, their real goal in theagreements was to gain US resources, hobble the Air Force’s efforts to buildeffective antigravity craft, and to persuade Air Force leaders to channel theirresources into rocket propulsion technologies for a more conventional spaceprogram that would pose no threat to the Germans’ Antarctic operations.Operation Paperclip provided the critical means for such a deception since therewere many German scientists placed in key positions within the USMilitary-Industrial Complex who were part of a fifth column for the AntarcticGerman colony. In the next chapter, I will focus on the agreements reached withGray extraterrestrials, and how they assisted the USAF in its ambitious spaceprogram goals."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 11 USAF Begins Technology Assistance Programs with Gray Extraterrestrials \"Beware the bearers of FALSE gifts & their BROKEN PROMISES. Much PAIN but stilltime.\"– The Chilbolton “Arecibo Answer” Crop Circle Message, 2001 T he 1942 Los Angeles Air Raid led to the crash retrieval of two remotelycontrolled saucer-shaped drones according to William Tompkins. At the time,Tompkins was being groomed by the Office of Naval Intelligence for a covertespionage program designed to infiltrate the German flying saucer program andgather data on the extraterrestrial help the Germans were receiving indeveloping their own advanced aerospace technologies using antigravity and othertypes of exotic propulsion systems. Documents from the Los Angeles incidentconfirm that no bodies were recovered, which corroborates Tompkins’ claim thatthese were unmanned drones. [295] [text00029.html#_edn295] In contrast, the 1947Roswell Crash provided the Army Air Force/Air Force with the first opportunityto begin working directly with the remnants of a piloted spacecraft and to studythe bodies to fully understand how the pilots interacted with the spacecraft’sadvanced technologies.Several Majestic documents refer to the occupants of the retrieved Roswellflying saucer as all being dead at the site. One of these documents wasspecifically prepared for President-elect Eisenhower for a November 18, 1952,briefing on the topic. The “Eisenhower Briefing Document” was given a “HighLevel of Authenticity” rating by Dr. Robert Wood and Ryan Wood. [296][text00029.html#_edn296] It says: On 07 July 1947, a secret operation was begun to assure recovery of the wreckageof this object for scientific study. During the course of this operation, aerialreconnaissance discovered that four small human-like beings had apparentlyejected from the craft at some point before it exploded…. All four were dead andbadly decomposed due to action by predators and exposure to the elements duringthe approximately one week time period which had elapsed before their discovery.[297] [text00029.html#_edn297] A guide for crash retrieval operations, called the “Special Operations Manual”,was written in April 1954 and is also a leaked Majestic document that wasclassified Top Secret MAJIC. After extensively investigating the validity of thedocument, the Woods gave it a “High Level of Authenticity” rating. [298][text00029.html#_edn298] The “Special Operations Manual” was written for covertUFO retrieval teams such as the Army’s Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit and itsUSAF successors, Project Moon Dust and Operation Blue Fly.Project Moon Dust and Operation Blue Fly were associated with the 4602d AirIntelligence Service Squadron (AISS) which was created in 1953, and one yearlater, officially assigned under Air Force Regulation 200-2. The AISS had \"adirect interest in the facts pertaining to UFOBs [aka UFOs]\" and for conductingfield investigations \"to determine the identity of any UFOB.\" [299][text00029.html#_edn299] Regulation 200-2 further stated that the 4602d AISSwould have highly mobile units of \"specialists trained for field collection andinvestigation of matters of air intelligence interest.\" [300][text00029.html#_edn300] A Freedom of Information Act document called the “BetzMemo”, which was dated November 13, 1961, and released in 1979, described thepeacetime functions of the 4602d: [301] [text00029.html#_edn301] * UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO) - A program for investigation of reliably reported unidentified flying objects within the United States. * PROJECT MOONDUST [sic] - A specialized aspect of the U.S. Air Force's over-all material of the exploitation program to locate, recover, and deliver descended foreign space vehicles. * OPERATION BLUE FLY – [A unit] to facilitate expeditious delivery to the Foreign Technological Division (FTD) of Moon Dust and other items of great technical intelligence interest. [302] [text00029.html#_edn302] Put simply, while Project Moon Dust would find, secure and retrieveextraterrestrial artifacts found anywhere around the world, Operation Blue Flywould ensure the delivery of these artifacts to proper technical facilities atWright Patterson AFB. The “Special Operations Manual” was used by personnel inProject Moon Dust and Operation Blue Fly to conduct their operations from theirheadquarters at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. [303] [text00029.html#_edn303]The “Special Operations Manual” says that, at the time of its writing, no livealiens had been retrieved from any of the UFO crash sites that had beeninvestigated by covert UFO retrieval teams. Several dead entities have been recovered along with a substantial amount ofwreckage and devices from downed craft all of which are now under study atvarious locations. No attempt has been made by extraterrestrial entities, eitherto contact authorities or to recover their dead counterparts or the downedcraft, even though one of the crashes was the result of direct military action.[304] [text00029.html#_edn304] The recovery of alien bodies from the crash sites gave Air Force, Navy andgovernment scientists the opportunity to begin studying how the pilotsinteracted with the advanced craft which was controlled by a pilot’s minddirectly interfacing with the crafts advanced propulsion and navigation systems.It would take Air Force and Navy scientists many years to understand how theincredibly advanced mind-interface technology systems could be replicated forfuture reverse engineered spacecraft. According to Philip Corso, themind-interface technology was a problem that had earlier even stumped theGermans who were far ahead of the U.S. in understanding and reverse engineeringextraterrestrial technologies.Furthermore, the fiber optic cables discovered in the Gray spacecraft were acompletely new form of communications technology in 1947. It would take morethan a decade for scientists to understand and develop fiber optics forclassified USAF programs and eventually release them to the public. The term“fiber optics” came into widespread usage through a 1960 article published inScientific American which introduced the new topic of ‘fiber opticalcommunications’ to the world. [305] [text00029.html#_edn305] This corroboratesCorso’s claims that fiber optics were among the technologies from the Roswellcraft that were seeded to US corporations from 1961 to 1963 for development.[306] [text00029.html#_edn306] A screenshot of a cell phone screen with text Description automaticallygenerated [Image00037.jpg]Figure 32.“Special Operations Manual” Despite the Gray pilots not surviving the crashes, their bodies and the interiorcomponents of the craft provided valuable clues into the vehicle’s operationsand performance. Multiple sources refer to the “Extraterrestrial BiologicalEntities” (EBEs) from the Roswell crash as “Short Grays”, which appear to be acloned synthetic life form used by different extraterrestrial groups. The“Special Operations Manual” (SOM1-01) referred to the Grays as the second of twotypes of EBEs found at UFO crash sites up to 1954. Section 10 from the “SpecialOperations Manual” says: Examination of remains recovered from wreckage of UFOBs indicates thatExtraterrestrial Biological Entities may be classified into two distinctcategories as follows: a. EBE Type I . These entities are humanoid and might be mistaken for human beings of the Oriental race if seen from a distance. They are bi-pedal, 5-5 feet 4 [sic] inches in height and weigh 80-100 pounds. Proportionally they are similar to humans, although the cranium is somewhat larger and more rounded. The skin is a pale, chalk-yellow in color, thick, and slightly pebbled in appearance. The eyes are small, wide-set, almond-shaped, with brownish black irises with very large gray cast. The ears are small and set low on the skull…. b. EBE Type II . These entities are humanoid but differ from Type 1 in many respects. They are bi-pedal, 3 feet 5 inches – 4 feet 2 inches in height and weigh 25-50 pounds. Proportionally, the head is much larger than humans or Type 1 EBEs, the cranium being much larger and elongated. The eyes are very large, slanted, and nearly wrap around the side of the skull. They are black with no whites showing. There is no noticeable brow ridge, and the skull has a slight peak that runs over the crown. The nose consists of two small slits which sit high about the slit-like mouth. There are no external ears. The skin is a pale bluish-gray color, begins somewhat darker on the back of the creature, and is very smooth and fine-celled. There is no hair on either the face or the body, and these creatures do not appear to be mammalian. The arms are long in proportion to the legs, and the hands have three long, tapering fingers and a thumb which is nearly as long as the fingers. [307] [text00029.html#_edn307] Corso and others have described the Short Grays as a synthetic life form, orclones, developed and used by other extraterrestrial races for a variety ofpurposes, which included reconnaissance missions on dangerous planets such asEarth. One of the groups using the Short Grays were the “Tall Grays” whonegotiated agreements with the Eisenhower administration. According to Dr.Arthur Horn, author of Humanity’s Extraterrestrial Origins , ”Tall Grays” playan overseeing role vis-à-vis Short Grays that piloted the Roswell craft: The short greys are overseen within their own ranks by the taller seven to eightfoot tall greys. These greys are the ones that actually carry out \"diplomatic\"missions, such as secretly negotiating treaties with heads of human governments.As mentioned the greys in general, and the small three to five foot greys inparticular, have been likened to mercenaries. [308] [text00029.html#_edn308] The Tall Grays first became known to the Eisenhower administration in 1953 whentheir large motherships began appearing in Earth orbit, according to WilliamCooper.[Image00038.jpg]Figure 33. Alleged photo of Gray Alien. Credit: Robert Dean As previously discussed, Cooper stated that an agreement was reached at HollomanAFB in 1954 with “large nosed Grays” who were permitted to conduct biologicalexperiments on abducted humans in exchange for some technological assistance.Similarly, Phil Schneider said that a Treaty was signed with the Tall Graysapproving such biological experimentation in exchange for technologicalassistance. The 3-4 foot Short Grays have most commonly been sighted performingthe abductions permitted under these “treaties” and have been described bymultiple witnesses as being controlled by taller beings, often referred to asTall Grays.Dr. David Jacobs concluded from an exhaustive analysis of sixty case studies inAlien Encounters that the Tall Grays played an overseeing role in abductioncases. [309] [text00029.html#_edn309] The Tall Grays were found to be present inmany of the abductions that Jacobs examined through hypnotic regression ofabductees and were in command of the Short Grays who performed most of theabductions. According to Jacobs, the Tall Grays would assist in regainingcontrol in abduction situations where humans fought against the Short Grayswhile performing invasive procedures: If the abductee gets out of control, the Small Beings usually back off and letthe Taller Being deal with the situation, and the proper procedures forregaining control are instituted. Yet some abductees have learned the areaswhere defiance and self-assertion are possible. [310] [text00029.html#_edn310] Consequently, when technology assistance agreements were reached withextraterrestrials at Holloman AFB, these were negotiated with Tall Grayextraterrestrials who subsequently allowed the Short Gray clones to directlyassist the USAF in its research and development efforts dealing with crashedflying saucers. Short Grays and USAF TechnologyBill Uhouse served as a fighter pilot for the US Marine Corps during World WarII and the Korean War. He attained the rank of Captain before he was honorablydischarged after ten years of service. In 1954, he joined the USAF as a testpilot for experimental aircraft at Wright Patterson AFB. While serving here, hewas asked if he wanted to participate in a classified program involving a flyingsaucer simulator: While I was at Wright Patterson, I was approached by an individual who [wanted]to determine if I wanted to work in an area on new creative devices. Okay? And,that was a flying disc simulator. What they had done: they had selected severalof us, and they reassigned me to A-Link Aviation, which was a simulatormanufacturer. At the time they were building what they called the C-11B, andF-102 simulator, B-47 simulator, and so forth. They wanted us to get experiencedbefore we actually start work on the flying disc simulator, which I spent30-some years working on.I don’t think any flying disc simulator went into operation until the early1960s – around 1962 or 1963. The reason why I am saying this is because thesimulator wasn’t actually functional until around 1958. The simulator that theyused was for the extraterrestrial craft they had, which is a 30-meter one thatcrashed in Kingman Arizona, back in 1953 or 1952. That’s the first one that theytook out to test flight. [311] [text00029.html#_edn311] According to Ryan Wood’s book, MAJIC Eyes Only , the Kingman crash happened onMay 21, 1953, and involved a flying saucer that was largely intact. [312][text00029.html#_edn312] Wood analyzed a number of witness testimonies thatdescribed various aspects of the crash retrieval of the flying saucer and itsoccupant(s). Particularly noteworthy is the testimony of an Air Force servicemanwho served on the crash retrieval team, who described the craft as being“without any sign of structural damage.” [313] [text00029.html#_edn313]This makes Uhouse’s claim plausible that the craft recovered at Kingman in 1953was sufficiently undamaged to be test flown and used to develop a flightsimulator for future reverse engineered USAF flying saucers, and other USAF heldextraterrestrial vehicles. Uhouse described the workings of the flight simulatoras follows: The disc simulator didn’t have a reactor, [but] we had a space in it that lookedlike the reactor that wasn’t the device we operated the simulator with. Weoperated it with six large capacitors that were charged with a million voltseach, so there were six million volts in those capacitors. They were the largestcapacitors ever built. These particular capacitors, they’d last for 30 minutes,so you could get in these and actually work the controls and do what you had to– to get the simulator, the disc to operate.So, it wasn’t that simple, because we only had 30 minutes. Okay? But, in thesimulator you’ll notice that there are no seat belts. Right? It was the samething with the actual craft – no seat belts. You don’t need seat belts, becausewhen you fly one of these things upside down, there is no upside down like in aregular aircraft – you just don’t feel it. There’s a simple explanation forthat: you have your own gravitation field right inside the craft, so if you areflying upside down – to you – you are right side up….Because the disc has its own gravitational field, you would be sick ordisoriented for about two minutes after getting in, after it was cranked up. Ittakes a lot of time to become used to it. Because of the area and the smallnessof it, just to raise your hand becomes complicated. You have to be trained –trained with your mind, to accept what you are going to actually feel andexperience. [314] [text00029.html#_edn314] Uhouse explained the difficulty in conducting flight tests and adapting theretrieved flying saucer for human pilots since the interior of the craft hadbeen originally designed for the small 3-4 foot Short Gray aliens. He alsopointed out that the disks couldn’t be fitted with conventional weapons systems– a similar problem to the one Nazi Germany had contended with over twenty yearsearlier, but had solved by the time of Operation Highjump in 1947: Each engineer that had anything to do with the design was part of the startupcrew. We would have to verify all the equipment that we put in – to be sure it[worked] like it was supposed to, etc…. The whole problem with the disc is thatit is so exacting in its design and so forth. It can’t be used like we useaircraft today, with dropping bombs and having machine guns in the wings.The design is so exacting that you can’t add anything – it’s got to be justright. There’s a big problem in the design of where things are put. Say, wherethe center of the aircraft is, and that type of thing. Even the fact that weraised it [the entrance] three feet so the taller guys could get in…. [315][text00029.html#_edn315] Uhouse and others working on the disc simulation project were given theopportunity to talk with a Gray alien to get answers to engineering andtechnical questions about the flying saucers. Significantly, Uhouse mentionedthat Dr. Edward Teller had accompanied the Gray alien to such meetings and wasdirectly involved in the flying saucer simulation project: We had meetings and I ended up in a meeting with an alien. I called him J-Rod –of course, that's what they called him.... The alien used to come in with [Dr.Edward] Teller and some of the other guys, occasionally to handle questions thatmaybe we'd have. You know? But you have to understand that everything wasspecific to the group. If it wasn't specific to the group, you couldn't talkabout it. It was on need-to-know basis. And [the ET] he'd talk. He would talk,but he'd sound just like as if you spoke – he'd sound just like as if youspoke... The preparation we had before meeting this alien was, basically, goingthrough all of the different nationalities in the world.... So basically, thealien was only giving engineering advice and science advice... Sometimes you'dget into a spot where you [would] try and try and try, and it wouldn't work. Andthat's where he'd [the alien] come in. They would tell him to look at this andsee what we did wrong. [316] [text00029.html#_edn316] Nearly three decades later, in 1988, Teller would recruit Bob Lazar, whom he hadmet back in 1982 when Lazar was working for Los Alamos National Laboratory tounderstand better the propulsion system in one of the flying saucers used by theGray aliens. [317] [text00029.html#_edn317] The Lazar story illustrates howslowly the USAF progressed in its research and development of flying saucertechnologies, despite the help that the Gray aliens were providing as a resultof the agreements reached with the Tall Grays in 1954/1955. If the Short Graystechnological assistance was piecemeal and minimally offered, perhaps workingdirectly with the Tall Grays would provide the USAF with the kind oftechnological assistance they required to expedite achieving their dream offuture fleets of antigravity flying saucer craft.Charles Hall on Extraterrestrial Assistance for USAF Atomic Powered SpacecraftArguably, the most detailed account of the agreements reached with the TallGrays and how the USAF has operationalized these for the reverse engineering ofextraterrestrial spacecraft comes from Charles Hall. [318][text00029.html#_edn318] Hall was a duty weather observer for the Air Force from1963 to 1967 and was stationed at the Indian Springs facility of Nellis AirForce Base, Nevada. He claims that beginning in 1965 until he completed hismilitary service, he frequently interacted with extraterrestrials which hecalled the “Tall Whites” (aka Tall Grays), who regularly met with senior AirForce leaders at the remote location where he was stationed. Hall further claimsthat a secret underground base was built at Indian Springs to house theextraterrestrials and their advanced interstellar ships. Rumors of theextraterrestrials at Nellis AFB date back to the mid-1950’s amongst personnelserving there and were also acknowledged by Hall, creating a direct link to thealleged agreements reached during the Eisenhower administration at Holloman AFB.Confirmation has been found for some of Hall’s claims concerning anomalousevents he witnessed at Indian Springs by a former airlinepilot-turned-investigator, David Coote, who tracked down and interviewed threeAirmen who served with Hall. [319] [text00029.html#_edn319] A picture containing sky Description generated with high confidence[Image00039.jpg]Figure 34. Artists impression of the \"Tall Whites\". Credit: Teresa Barbatelli Insights have been provided by Hall into the agreements reached between the USAFand the Tall Whites in terms of the legalistic way in which theextraterrestrials interpreted their provisions. In an interview, Hall explainedhow he was chosen to liaise with the Tall Whites and why he was safeguarded inthis role: … the decision to send me, and no one else, out to the ranges, was made by acommittee of individuals that included the Tall Whites as well as high rankingUSAF Generals and other high ranking members of the U.S. Government. The TallWhites are very meticulous about keeping their agreements and expect the U.S.Government to be equally meticulous about keeping its agreements as well. If Iwere victimized or threatened by anyone, The Tall Whites would interpret that tomean that the U.S. Government could not be trusted to keep its agreements. Theconsequences would be enormous. [320] [text00029.html#_edn320] Hall has described how the Tall Whites strictly limited the advanced aerospacetechnologies they shared with the USAF so that the latter would be limited todeveloping vehicles capable of only short interplanetary flights. The moreadvanced technologies the extraterrestrials used for their own deep space orinterstellar flights were kept away from USAF officials, according to Hall. Mostsignificantly, in exchange for this limited technological assistance, CharlesHall revealed that the USAF supplied many resources including basing rights tothe Tall Whites.In a December 3, 2004 email interview with Hall, I asked him to clarify a claimthat he had made in his book series, Millennial Hospitality, that the Air Force“Generals were desperate for technology exchanges with Tall Whites” that couldbe used for space travel. [321] [text00029.html#_edn321] In response, Hallwrote: Tall Whites exchanged technologies such as radio and communications systems, butnot faster than light speed technology. Technology exchange was done on thebasis of only those technologies that would benefit Tall Whites, such as goodradios and communications that they could use as well if necessary….Tall Whites would help with a nuclear powered craft but not propulsion systemsfor deep space travel. Anti-gravity technologies were not shared with thegenerals which were deep space capable. American generals were sometimes in thescout craft of the Tall Whites so the technology for the scout ships was sharedto an extent since the scout ships were made on Earth using materials here withthe assistance of the US military. Tall Whites sometimes participated inclassified meetings and helped with technology development…. Basically, the TallWhites would participate in classified meetings by sitting in and helping withsome well-placed questions. As Hall explained from his direct interactions with the Tall Whites, highranking Air Force generals, as well as senior Pentagon officials, were hoping togain any technology they could from their agreement, but the technologiesacquired were not nearly as advanced as they had hoped. In a subsequentinterview on December 16, 2004, I asked Hall to explain how the Tall Whitesbuilt spacecraft at Nellis AFB using materials supplied by the USAF andcorporate contractors, yet were able to strictly limit access to them by AirForce personnel: [Key: M.S.–Michael Salla; C.H.–Charles Hall]M.S. You describe the tall whites as building scout crafts using materials foundon Earth. Can you elaborate on how you came to know this information?C.H. This information is based on my personal observations. In book two[Millennium Hospitality II] I describe the afternoon when The Teacher and RangeFour Harry [Two of the Tall Whites] were showing me the inside of one of thescout craft. Many of the items, such as the seats and the overhead compartmentsstill carried the mold markings placed on them by various American industriessuch as Boeing aircraft and Lockheed Corporation. The overhead compartments wereobviously “off-the-shelf” items from companies such as Airstream corporation.Many of the clothing items that the Tall Whites were wearing were obviouslypurchased straight out of the Sears and Montgomery Ward Catalogs….M.S. Did the U.S. play any role in the actual construction of the Tall White’sscout craft?C.H. I’m not sure. From what I saw, the Tall Whites performed all of theconstruction activities themselves. I’m certain that the Tall Whites performedall work on the propulsion systems and on the fiber optics windings themselves.M.S. Did the military have personnel observe the Tall Whites in the constructionprocess or observe their construction facilities?C.H. I’m certain that the Tall Whites did not allow any USAF personnel toobserve the construction process. In book two, in the chapter entitled “TwoGames on one Board” I describe the day that I was able to observe their repairactivities from a short distance. To the best of my knowledge, I am the onlyhuman that was allowed to view those activities from as close as I was.M.S. You described the hangar that was used as a base for the largerinterstellar spacecraft used by the Tall Whites. Was this built solely by theTall Whites or did the US military play a role in this?C.H. The hanger appeared to have been entirely constructed by the USAF for useby the Tall Whites. For example, the inside of the hanger looked just like anyother ordinary aircraft hanger. It included ordinary fire extinguishers, arrowsmarking exits, etc. In addition to writing and signs on the walls in English, italso included hieroglyphics and icons used by the aliens. The alien writing wasdone in pink paint against a white background.M.S. When in your view was the hangar supplied by the USAF for the Tall Whitesbuilt?C.H. I have no idea. However, I’m certain that the legends of Range Four Harrygo back at least as far as 1954. The hanger construction (i.e. its steelsupports, its other materials, it’s lighting designs, its concrete doors thatraised up in narrow sections by being lifted up from the top, etc.) wereconsistent with the construction techniques used in the late 1940’s and early1950’s….M.S. Are all the bases used by Tall Whites in the US supplied and constructed bythe USAF?C.H. I have no idea. My guess is that the answer is yes because I only saw USAFgenerals and personnel out on the Nellis Ranges.M.S. You contrast nuclear-powered propulsion as elementary for the Tall Whiteswhich they supplied to the US military. You contrast this with anti-gravitypropulsion which they did not supply. Are these the only two propulsion systemsthat the Tall Whites openly discussed or make known to the US authorities or toyou?C.H. Yes, as far as I know.M.S. You mention that the Tall Whites supplied the know-how for nuclear poweredscout craft. Did the Tall Whites actually fly nuclear powered scout craft whenon Earth or did they use anti-gravity propulsion in their scout craft?C.H. The Tall Whites always used the anti-gravity powered spacecraft and scoutcraft. The nuclear powered craft were only for use by the USAF.M.S. What kind of speed were the nuclear powered scout craft capable of, incontrast to the anti-gravity propelled scout craft?C.H. Vastly slower. The anti-gravity craft were capable of speeds in excess ofthe speed of light where as the nuclear powered were capable of just ordinaryrocket powered speeds. This exchange is highly significant since it indicates that in the mid-1960’s,the Air Force was limited by the Tall Whites in developing anything faster thanthe speeds that could be attained through nuclear powered propulsion systems. Inchapter 13, I will discuss how the USAF had to move forward with the slowernuclear powered rocket propulsion system when creating its network of Earthorbiting space stations to establish a permanent foothold in space.While the USAF hoped that technological assistance from the Grays would lead torapid breakthroughs in reverse engineering captured extraterrestrial spacecraft,they soon realized that in reality, the progress would be slow and difficult. Infact, it would take decades – a stark contrast to Nazi Germany where rapidprogress occurred in a relatively few short years after agreements had beenreached with the Draco Reptilians. In addition to receiving technologicalassistance from the Grays, the USAF also loftily hoped that the 1955 agreementswith the Antarctic Germans would lead to significant technological gains fromthem and their Draco Reptilian allies."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12 NASA Created as a FrontWhat a thing was this, too, which that mighty man wrought and endured in thecarven horse, wherein all we chiefs of the Argives were sitting, bearing to theTrojans death and fate! – Homer, The Odyssey A s a result of the agreements reached between the Eisenhower Administration andthe Antarctic German space program dating back to the first meeting at HollomanAFB in February 1955, both sides eagerly looked forward to the benefits thedeals would bring, but for very different reasons. The Antarctic Germans (akaFourth Reich) was to be given access to the enormous industrial resources andpopulation base possessed by the United States. America’s aerospace industrycould quickly mass produce the necessary components for the Antarctic Germans toexpand their polar operations rapidly, and also possessed a trained workforcethat could be contracted to fulfill vital production and logistic tasks.Critically, the Antarctic Germans could select from a pool of hundreds ofthousands of highly trained servicemen from the different branches of the USmilitary who would be given temporary assignments to perform key combat-relatedassignments in deep space and on planets such as Mars. [322][text00029.html#_edn322]For the Eisenhower administration and the USAF in particular, the AntarcticGermans had the necessary technical knowledge and experience to help themreverse engineer captured extraterrestrial technologies. The Antarctic Germanswere widely acknowledged to be as much as two decades ahead of the U.S. inunderstanding advanced aerospace technologies, such as rocket propulsion and jetengines. [323] [text00029.html#_edn323] The technological gap when it came toflying saucers was even more pronounced since the operation of such craftinvolved very different applied and theoretical physics principles, and USscientists had to be thoroughly retrained to understand and apply theseprinciples.In order to facilitate the sharing of resources and technology, and to hide thesecret agreements from the American public, the Eisenhower Administration andthe Antarctic Germans came up with a cunning solution. President Eisenhowercreated a civilian space agency which would act as a façade for the sharing ofresources and technology through multiple cover programs. USAF historiansgenerally accept that NASA was created as a smokescreen for military spaceactivities. According to Lt Col Mark Erikson: “Eisenhower’s space-for-peacepolicy was designed to overtly emphasize civilian scientific exploration anddivert attention away from covert reconnaissance satellites”. [324][text00029.html#_edn324] However, the deception went much further than Eriksonand other USAF historians suspected.Created on July 29, 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) had former Nazi Scientists filling its senior leadership positions.Placed in these key positions with responsibility over numerous NASA programsand vast resources, the former Nazi Scientists secretly sent the GermanAntarctic Space Program whatever was needed for its rapid expansion towardsbecoming a colonial space power. Furthermore, NASA had the responsibility ofhiding the truth about Antarctic German space operations by setting upscientific missions which could be used to explain away any Antarctic Germanactivities observed in deep space and on planets or moons. Finally, NASAprovided the necessary cover allowing US military servicemen to be recruitedinto covert service for the Antarctic German space program, which would developby the 1970’s into an expansionist colonial power in deep space and other solarsystems.The Antarctic German Space Program and NASAIn 1915, a naval appropriations bill funded the creation of the NationalAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) whose primary goal was to help developmilitary aviation in response to the outbreak of World War I. According to USAFhistorian Lt Col Mark Erickson, “the history of NACA and its R&D was closelytied to national security and the fortunes of the military services.” [325][text00029.html#_edn325] Erikson described in detail the extent to which NACAcontinued to be dependent on the US military for funding and resourcesthroughout its history. [326] [text00029.html#_edn326]According to conventional historians, the course and destiny of NACA wasdramatically changed by the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik 1 on October 4,1957, which allegedly sent shockwaves through the United States. Three monthslater, on January 14, 1958, Hugh Dryden, the director of NACA published a papertitled: “A National Research Program for Space Technology\" in which he stated: It is of great urgency and importance to our country both from consideration ofour prestige as a nation as well as military necessity that this challenge[Sputnik] be met by an energetic program of research and development for theconquest of space.... It is accordingly proposed that the scientific research bethe responsibility of a national civilian agency working in close cooperationwith the applied research and development groups required for weapon systemsdevelopment by the military. The pattern to be followed is that alreadydeveloped by the NACA and the military services.... The NACA is capable, byrapid extension and expansion of its effort, of providing leadership in spacetechnology. [327] [text00029.html#_edn327] Dryden’s reference to the challenge posed by Sputnik is most often given as thereason for the creation of NACA’s successor, NASA. According to PresidentEisenhower, NASA’s “whole program was based on psychological values…. The furorproduced by Sputnik was really the reason for the creation of NASA.” [328][text00029.html#_edn328]Given the military history of NASA’s predecessor, and the continuing militaryinterest in space affairs at a time when there was no commercial space industry,it is very strange that US policymakers felt the need to create a civilian-runspace agency to conduct, as Dryden put it, “an energetic program of research anddevelopment for the conquest of space.” Wouldn’t a military space agency havemade more sense if the goal was to maintain the national security interests ofthe U.S. in space through the “conquest of space”? Indeed, some NASA researchershave claimed that NASA has never really been a civilian agency at all, butinstead, a military-run institution from its inception. Richard Hoagland andMike Bara, co-authors of Dark Mission: The Secret History of NASA wrote:NASA ostensibly is a “ civilian agency exercising control over aeronautical andspace activities sponsored by the United States”.But contrary to common public and media perception that NASA is an open,strictly civilian scientific institution, is the legal fact that the SpaceAgency was quietly founded as a direct adjunct to the Department of Defense.”[329] [text00029.html#_edn329] To prove their point, they cite from the original NASA Charter passed byCongress in 1958, which states: The Administration shall be considered a defense agency of the United States forthe purpose of chapter 17 of title 35 of the United States Code. [330][text00029.html#_edn330] There is, however, another more compelling explanation for NASA’s true purposeother than it simply being a front for the Pentagon’s interests in spaceconquest. In reality, NASA was not created as a genuine response to the launchof Sputnik to get Americans into space in an effort to restore lost US pride –the “psychological values” as Eisenhower put it. National security officialsbriefed about visiting extraterrestrial life and the German Antarctic programviewed Sputnik in comparison to these dire national security threats as littlemore than a joke. NASA was created as a front organization, though not for thePentagon as its founding charter suggested, but for the Antarctic German spaceprogram. NASA was to be secretly run behind-the-scenes by a consortium of groupstied to the US military and the Antarctic Germans who saw NASA as the idealinstitutional façade for implementing their secret agreements.Hoagland and Bara, to their credit, got very close to the truth in Dark Missionwhere they recognized the Nazi element as one of three “fringe elements” reallyrunning NASA programs: These literal “fringe elements,” then, are divided into three main groups insidethe Agency, as best as we can tell at present. For the purposes of this volume,we shall them the “Magicians,” the “Masons” and the “Nazis” – and deal with eachgroup separately.Each “sect” is led by prominent individuals, and supported by lesser-knownplayers. Each has stamped their own agenda on our space program, in indeliblebut traceable ways. And each, remarkably, is dominated by a secret or “occult”doctrine, that is far more closely aligned with “ancient religion and mysticism”than it is with the rational science and cool empiricism these men promote tothe general public as NASA’s overriding mantra. [331] [text00029.html#_edn331] There are three good reasons for believing NASA is an institutional façade forimplementing the secret U.S.-German agreements. First is the timing of NASA’screation, which came relatively soon after the 1955 Holloman meeting that setthe stage for further negotiations and the subsequent agreements reached in themonths and years that followed. The agreements required that significantresources be transferred to the Antarctic Germans, while the Germans in returnwould provide the scientific know-how for helping America’s space program moveforward. In order to implement the agreements without the US Congress or theAmerican public being informed about the vast resource transfers that would betaking place, an institutional façade had to be created. NASA fit the bill sinceit could be presented as a civilian-run organization to gain widespread publicsupport for the “conquest of space” while really being run, behind the scenes,by the Pentagon, USAF and the Antarctic Germans.The second and most compelling reason to view NASA as an institutional facadefor secretly implementing agreements with the Antarctic Germans is the number ofOperation Paperclip scientists appointed to key leadership positions within theorganization. It is well known that Nazis who worked on the V-2 rocket programwere brought to the U.S. under Operation Paperclip to start up America’s rocketprogram. Rather than being rehabilitated Nazis who achieved public prominence inAmerica due to their scientific acumen, they were de facto representatives ofthe Antarctic Germans /Fourth Reich. Their real mission was to run the NASAprograms as effective covers for the space activities by the Fourth Reich out ofAntarctica, and to implement the secret agreements requiring vast resources andmanpower to pour into the Antarctic German space program without the Americanpublic or Congress learning the truth.The number of Operation Paperclip scientists that headed up key NASAinstallations and projects from their inception is astounding. The leadershippositions they attained at the apex of NASA space operations support theconclusion that they were de facto representatives of the Antarctic Germans.Indeed, the Apollo program (aka Project Apollo), which was originally conceivedin mid-1950 during the Eisenhower Administration, [332] [text00029.html#_edn332]and only later associated with President Kennedy’s May 25, 1961 pledge to getman to the Moon by the end of the decade, was the primary program for achievinga deeper purpose arising out of the secret agreements. [333][text00029.html#_edn333] The Apollo program would covertly provide the AntarcticGermans with all of the human and technical resources they needed to expandtheir operations on the Moon and Mars, and help the Germans extend theirpresence into deep space even to reach other solar systems. Put simply, whileApollo got Americans to the Moon, it got the Antarctic Germans to Mars, AlphaCentauri and beyond.This astounding conclusion is supported by the ‘who’s who’ of German scientistsin the leadership positions of the key installations and facilities associatedwith the Apollo, Gemini and Skylab missions. Soon after the creation of NASA,Dr. Wernher von Braun, the famed former “Nazi SS officer”, transferred hisentire German team of former V-2 rocket scientists who had been working with himat the Army Ballistic Missile Agency to the newly created George C. MarshalSpace Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama. It’s important to review alittle of von Braun’s wartime activities to get an idea of how closely he wasaligned with Nazi SS ideology, despite claims that he was merely a scientistfollowing orders to implement the V-2 rocket program. Richard Hoagland and MikeBara had the following to say about von Braun and his Nazi past: Von Braun during World War II was nothing less than a Major in the SS…. LindaHunt found survivors of the Nazi missile factories at Mittlework and Peenemundewho told her that Von Braun not only “witnessed executions and abuse ofprisoners at those facilities,” but on at least one occasion ordered executions. [334] [text00029.html#_edn334] A black and white photo of a group of people in uniform Description generatedwith very high confidence [Image00040.jpg]Figure 35. Heinrich Himmler, visits Peenemünde in April 1943. Wernher von Braunis standing behind Himmler and wearing a black Nazi SS uniform. Despite his dubious Nazi SS past, von Braun became Marshall Space FlightCenter’s first director from its inception on July 1, 1960, heading it untilFebruary 1970. NASA describes the resources transferred to the MSFC with itsnewly won autonomy: The Marshall Space Flight Center was activated on July 1, 1960, with thetransfer of buildings, land, space projects, property, and personnel from theDevelopment Operations Division of the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency. Itwas dedicated on September 8, 1960, by President Dwight David Eisenhower. TheCenter was named in honor of General George C. Marshall, the Army Chief of Staffduring World War II, Secretary of State, and Nobel Prize Winner for hisworld-renowned \"Marshall Plan.\"Shortly before activating its new field Center in 1960, NASA described theMarshall Center as \"the only self-contained organization in the nation which wascapable of conducting the development of a space vehicle from the conception ofthe idea, through production of hardware, testing and launching operations.\"[335] [text00029.html#_edn335] It’s worth highlighting the phrase \"the only self-contained organization in thenation” to understand that there was something strange about the autonomygranted to the MSFC and the vast Army resources that had been transferred to it.Once placed in charge of this key NASA facility, von Braun and his team offormer Nazi rocket scientists were responsible for all aspects of the Saturnprogram that provided the launch vehicles for Apollo space missions.Von Braun’s deputy at MSFC, Eberhard Friedrich Michael Rees, who on March 1,1970, was elevated to the position of director, had previously served under vonBraun on the Nazi SS V-2 program. As director of the MSFC, Rees oversaw thedevelopment and construction of the Skylab space station until his retirement onJanuary 19, 1973. [336] [text00029.html#_edn336] This meant that the MSFC,during the bulk of the Apollo program, was headed by two former Nazis occupyingboth the director and deputy director positions, along with other members of vonBraun’s team of German Paperclip scientists taking other senior positions. Thisglaring fact alone should immediately raise suspicions about what the GermanPaperclip scientists were really up to at Marshall. Why transfer resources andpersonnel from US Army control to a civilian installation, and incredulously,have it run by former Nazis with virtual independence and responsibility fordesigning and contracting out the building of the highly sensitive Saturn launchvehicles for NASA’s space program?William Tompkins has provided an important clue to what was really happening. Heclaims that when he arrived at the MSFC on July 1, 1962, with a model design hehad built of the launch facility for the Apollo program (the future John F.Kennedy Space Center), he witnessed a US flag with a translucent Swastika overit prominently displayed at the former US Army facility. Tompkins’ Nordicextraterrestrial secretary, Jessica, had given him instructions before hisdeparture detailing what he could expect to see when he arrived at the Marshallfacility. According to Tompkins, Jessica’s description was entirely accurate: “You will turn off the highway, onto the entrance road leading to the base entrygates. Do not slow down, because the gates will open and you will just driveright through, past four military guards carrying automatic rifles.“They will not challenge you to stop. You won’t even be challenged for carryinga large, unmarked gray crate that could be holding, an A-Bomb to blow up theentire base. After driving through very heavy base traffic, stopping andstarting at the stop signs, passing Army tank convoys security vehicles, andwith everyone looking at you, no-one will be pointing rifles at your head,demanding that you halt.“Getting into von Braun’s tower will not be trouble either. But finding it willbe something else; trees cover everything. You will not be able to see thetower. Don’t worry, you will be amused as you drive out into a clearing. vonBraun’s white tower will be right in front of you. Continue driving part wayaround the circular drive, around the American flag that has a translucentswastika in it. You pull right up and stop in front of the steps of the twelvestory building. That’s von Braun’s tower. [337] [text00029.html#_edn337] The flag was a brazen display of the Antarctic German/Fourth Reich’s triumph ofhaving established a major foothold within the US Military-Industrial Complex,skillfully achieved through its acquired control of the key NASA facilityresponsible for designing and organizing the construction of the rocketspowering the Apollo program.Furthermore, Tompkins said that as he proceeded into the MSFC, he was introducedto Dr. von Braun by his secretary, who said. “I am Connie and this is Dr. vonBraun, the conceiver and implementer of the world’s first penetration into thegalaxy.” [338] [text00029.html#_edn338] Now, this is a highly significant andrevealing statement. A trip to the Moon can hardly be considered “penetrationinto the galaxy”. However, if von Braun and the MSFC were involved infacilitating the construction of spacecraft that were taking German astronautsoutside of our solar system, her statement makes sense. This informationsupports the conclusion that von Braun and his team at Marshall had two distinctfunctions: coordinating, designing and planning for the construction ofspacecraft for the Apollo program, and also, doing the same for the spacecraftfor the Antarctic German space program.It is understandable why such an arrangement would have been acceptable to USnational security authorities and the USAF. They knew that the MSFC was secretlyfacilitating the construction of craft for the Antarctic Germans using leadingUS aerospace companies as contractors, but believed the expertise acquired byLockheed, Boeing, General Dynamics, etc., could in the future be applied tobuilding similar craft for the USAF. Indeed, the collaboration between U.S. andGerman companies in fulfilling contracts for NASA and the Antarctic Germans grewquickly – especially in deep underground Antarctic bases where slave labor couldbe used. [339] [text00029.html#_edn339]Tompkins has provided several documents supporting his claim that he did travelto Marshall Space Flight Center in 1962 to deliver his design model, where hewitnessed what was really happening at Marshall. [340] [text00029.html#_edn340]One of the documents proves that he was placed on a design team for the plannedlaunch operations facility for the Apollo program (see Figure 36). At Marshall,Tompkins met with von Braun and another former Nazi SS officer who had onlyrecently been appointed as the first director of the yet to be built LaunchOperations Center – Dr. Kurt Debus. A close up of a newspaper Description generated with high confidence[Image00041.jpg]Figure 36. Documentary evidence from W. M. Tompkins As director of the Launch Operations Center (renamed John F. Kennedy SpaceCenter in late 1963 after President Kennedy’s assassination), Debus was incharge of NASA’s only launch facility for the Apollo program, as well as theGemini and Skylab programs. Debus oversaw the facilities’ design andconstruction, making the choices required for launching the huge Saturn Vrockets that would be used for the Apollo and other space-related NASA programs.Debus also worked with von Braun in choosing the multiple aerospace companiesthat would build the different rocket stages and vehicle components that hadbeen designed by von Braun’s team at Marshall. Debus remained in charge of theKennedy Space Center until his retirement in November 1974. Consequently, withvon Braun and Rees running the Marshall Space Flight Center, and Debus runningthe Kennedy Space Center, former Nazi SS officers were effectively running theNASA programs with all their enormous resources right up to 1974/1975.This takes me to the third reason for supporting the view that NASA, from itsinception, was an institutional front for implementing the secret U.S.-Germanagreement. From 1964 to 1970, the Apollo program consumed between 54%-70% of theentire NASA budget of approximately four billion dollars annually. [341][text00029.html#_edn341] With former Nazis in charge of all aspects of thedesign, construction, and launches of the Apollo program space vehicles, andhaving complete autonomy at Marshall, there was clearly a means available forsiphoning off a significant portion of these funds and resources to theAntarctic German/Fourth Reich operations. However, siphoning off NASA fundsintended for Apollo would not have been sufficient for the Fourth Reich Germansin Antarctica to build their own fleets of ships for deep space and interstellaroperations.CIA Funds Antarctic German Space Program Through Apollo Program With the agreements in place, the stage was set for a major intelligence game tobegin. The Eisenhower administration had the weaker hand in this match and wouldallow significant resources and manpower to be given to the Antarctic Germanswith the hope of eventually learning enough to catch up in understanding theprecious alien technology they held. First, however, they would have to gettheir hands dirty. The US agency responsible for raising the necessary funds forthe Antarctic Germans would become the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) whichwas headed at the time by Allen Dulles, a key figure in the US-Fourth Reichnegotiations. [342] [text00029.html#_edn342] Indeed, Dulles was later discoveredto be the head (MJ-1) of the MJ-12 Committee that oversaw the negotiationsbetween the Eisenhower administration and the Germans from Antarctica. [343][text00029.html#_edn343]Soon after its formation in September 1947, the CIA was given the statutorypower to send or receive money without regard to statutory law as the followingclause in the 1949 CIA Act makes clear: … any other Government agency is authorized to transfer to or receive from theAgency such sums without regard to any provisions of law limiting or prohibitingtransfers between appropriations. Sums transferred to the Agency in accordancewith this paragraph may be expended for the purposes and under the authority ofsections 403a to 403s of this title without regard to limitations ofappropriations from which transferred. [emphasis added] [344][text00029.html#_edn344] Essentially, back in 1949, the CIA had been given a Congressional stamp ofapproval for the creation of a ‘black budget’, which was to be used for thefunding of covert programs without any Congressional oversight – an arrangementthat maintained plausible deniability. The most highly classified programs werethose authorized by the Majestic 12 Group that dealt with extraterrestrial lifeand the Antarctic German problem. After agreements had been reached with theEisenhower administration after the 1955 Holloman AFB meeting, a significantportion of the CIA’s black budget funds ended up being sent to the AntarcticGermans.The CIA’s “deep black budget” was estimated to be as high as $1.7 trillion peryear by the end of the Clinton administration in January 2001. [345][text00029.html#_edn345] To fully appreciate the significance of such a vastsum, consider that the proposed Pentagon budget was $686 billion for 2019. [346][text00029.html#_edn346] This means that the deep black budget, back in the year2000, was more than double the entire Pentagon budget today ! In 1966, theApollo Program received 66% of NASA’s $4.5 billion budget appropriation. [347][text00029.html#_edn347] The Pentagon budget in 1966 was $356 billion, dwarfingthe funds available to the Apollo Program. [348] [text00029.html#_edn348] If theCIA’s black budget at the time was, at the very least, comparable to thePentagon budget, that would mean that a significant portion of $356 billion orso that the CIA had raised through a variety of illicit fund raising operationscould have gone to the Fourth Reich German’s Antarctic operation.There’s no way of knowing exactly how much the CIA was channeling through theMSFC to the Antarctic Germans. However, given that funding for the Antarcticspace program would have been a high priority for the Fourth Reich, it can beguessed that they would have demanded and received a significant share of whatthe CIA was raising through covert operations. Speculating on what the Germanswould have demanded, something in the order of 30% or so of the agency’s blackbudget does not seem an unreasonable estimate. This figure would equalapproximately $100 billion, using the projected size of the CIA’s black budgetback in 1966.If the estimate of $100 billion is anywhere near what the Antarctic Germans weresecretly getting from the CIA on an annual basis, this would have dwarfed the $3billion received by the Apollo program in 1966. [349] [text00029.html#_edn349]The Apollo program officially ended in 1972, with the remaining Saturn rocketsbeing used for Skylab missions up to November 16, 1973, and a joint Soviet-U.S.mission on July 15, 1975. By 1975, US born scientists had replaced the formerNazi SS officers running the Marshall Space Flight Center and the Kennedy SpaceCenter. The end of Apollo and Saturn rocket production marked the end of an erathat was effective on two counts. NASA had successfully built the launchvehicles for manned spaceflights to the Moon and low Earth orbit, and secretly,it had supplied the resources, manpower and spacecraft components for theAntarctic German space program to travel to Mars, deep space and neighboringsolar systems.NASA’s role in helping establish the Antarctic Germans as a colonial space powerwas something that the USAF wished to leverage in its own effort to develop aspace program. The Gray/Tall White extraterrestrials were not as helpful as theAir Force had hoped in developing functional space travel technologies usingelectrogravitic, antimatter and other exotic propulsion systems. Similarly, theGermans were not as helpful as promised when it came to reverse engineeringcaptured alien spacecraft. However, when it came to rocket propulsiontechnologies, the German scientists at NASA had been eager to help and were, infact, enthusiastic about the potential of rocket propulsion for the Air Force’sambitious plans for space. Lt Col Erikson described the thinking among USAFofficers about projecting a presence into space: In a 28 January 1958 speech, Brig Gen Homer A. Boushey posited, “the moonprovides a retaliation base of unequaled advantage.... It has been said that ‘Hewho controls the moon, controls the earth.’ Our planners must carefully evaluatethis statement, for, if true (and I for one think it is), then the United Statesmust control the moon.” The Air Force’s deputy chief of staff for development,Lt Gen Donald L. Putt, supported a military base on the moon while testifying toCongress in March 1958 and declared this was “only a first step toward stationson planets far more distant from which control over the moon might be exercised.[350] [text00029.html#_edn350] Von Braun, in particular, was very optimistic that rocket propulsion could beused not only for manned lunar missions but also for establishing anEarth-orbiting space station [351] [text00029.html#_edn351] and manned missionsto Mars, as outlined in his 1952 book, The Mars Project . [352][text00029.html#_edn352] Was von Braun’s enthusiasm genuine or was he underorders from his Antarctic brethren who closely monitored NASA activities, andeven sent senior officials to NASA during the Apollo program? Former NASAspacecraft operator Clark McClelland reported seeing Nazi SS Lieutenant GeneralHans Kammler at NASA in the mid-1960’s. McClelland says that he met Kammler inthe director’s office at Kennedy Space Center while Kurt Debus was the director(1962-1974): I opened his office door and saw two people I had not seen at KSC. He introducedme to both men. He only gave me their first names during the introduction…. Onewas introduced to me as Siegfried and the other was introduced as Hans…. Bothhad the look of Nazi High Command Officers…. Today I am certain of who these twomen were. I eventually learned from other German scientists that one of them wasSiegfried Knemeyer. He was a very high ranking Nazi Oberst Officer in theLuftwaffe… The other man was difficult to recognize until I saw an older photoof him after he had later entered the USA. He was in my opinion Heinz (Hans)Kammler…. There were rumors after WWII that Kammler had made a deal with GeneralGeorge Patton to turn over German Top Secret technology for his support ingetting Kammler into the USA. That may have actually happened. I personallybelieve it did happen. [353] [text00029.html#_edn353] As a result of these informal visits from senior German officials from theAntarctica program, von Braun and other NASA-affiliated Germans steered the USAFtowards the use of conventional rockets as a known and reliable propulsionsystem for their future space program. [354] [text00029.html#_edn354] With themore exotic propulsion technologies still in development and years away fromdeployment, the USAF worked with the Antarctic Germans, through NASA, in movingforward with a rocket-powered secret space program during the Apollo era."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13 Manned Orbiting Laboratory and Secret Space Stations “Lunch with 5 top space scientists. It was fascinating. Space truly is the lastfrontier and some of the developments there in astronomy etc. are like sciencefiction, except they are real. I learned that our shuttle capacity is such thatwe could orbit 300 people .”– Ronald Reagan, Presidential Diaries, June 11, 1985A ir Force interest in developing a manned Earth-orbiting space station began in1960 with a proposal for a two-phase program: a “Military Test Space Station” tobe launched before 1965, followed by a more advanced version within five years.[355] [text00029.html#_edn355] The two-phase process was necessary first toevaluate what would be needed to construct a more complex model of the mannedstation which was intended to stay in Earth orbit for a prolonged period. Thepublicly stated goal of this endeavor was to create a stable space platform forreconnaissance missions, and possible use against enemy satellites. The hiddenpurpose, known only to those officials with “MAJIC” level security clearance,was to monitor space traffic from different visiting extraterrestrial groups andthe Antarctic Germans, all of whom continued to present a potential nationalsecurity threat despite the agreements that had been reached.Determination drove the USAF to develop and deploy a manned space station. Thisis reflected in a statement by General James Ferguson, deputy chief of staff forResearch and Development, who said on February 12, 1962, “We are convinced thata manned, military test space station should be undertaken as early aspossible”. [356] [text00029.html#_edn356] The “Military Test Space Station” wasgiven the more innocuous name of “Manned Orbiting Laboratory” (MOL), and onAugust 25, 1962, the Secretary of the Air Force approved the program. [357][text00029.html#_edn357]President Kennedy signed off on the proposal to begin feasibility studies, andlater President Johnson would approve its phase-one construction. It was decidedthat the USAF was to collaborate with NASA in building its military spacestation, which could operate in orbit from between 70 to 400 nautical miles(130-740 km). [358] [text00029.html#_edn358] On December 10, 1963, a pressrelease by the Office of the Secretary of Defense provided details about theproposed MOL: Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara today assigned to the Air Force a newprogram for the development of a near earth Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL).The MOL program, which will consist of an orbiting pressurized cylinderapproximately the size of a small house trailer, will increase the DefenseDepartment effort to determine military usefulness of man in space….MOL will be designed so that astronauts can move about freely in it without aspace suit and conduct observations and experiments in the laboratory over aperiod of up to a month. The first manned flight of the MOL is expected late in1967 or early in 1968… [359] [text00029.html#_edn359] The Pentagon press release went on to give more details about the launchvehicles to be used for the MOL program: The MOL will be attached to a modified GEMINI capsule and lifted into orbit by aTITAN III booster. The GEMINI capsule is being developed by NSA [NationalSecurity Agency] for use in the APOLLO moon shot program. The TITAN III is beingdeveloped as a standardized space booster by the Air Force.Astronauts will be seated in the modified GEMINI capsule during launch, and willmove to the laboratory after injection into orbit. After completion of theirtasks in space, the astronauts will return to the capsule, which will then bedetached from the laboratory to return to earth.The design of the MOL vehicle will permit rendezvous in space between theorbiting laboratory and a second GEMINI capsule, so that relieved crews couldreplace original crews in the laboratory. Such an operation would be undertakenif man’s utility in space environment were demonstrated and long operations inthe space laboratory were needed.The MOL program will make use of the existing NASA control facilities. Theseinclude the tracking facilities which have been set up for the GEMINI and otherspace flight programs of NASA and of the Department of Defense throughout theworld. [360] [text00029.html#_edn360] The MOL had a number of experimental and living areas together with a“transtage” (a re-startable engine} that could be used for maneuvering in space(see Figure 37). [361] [text00029.html#_edn361] The laboratory module wasessentially a third stage added to a modified Titan II rocket. The Titan II hadbeen successfully used both for the NASA Gemini program, which had performed 12launches from 1964 to 1966 (10 of which were manned), as well as anIntercontinental Ballistic Missile launch for USAF Strategic Air Command. [362][text00029.html#_edn362] [Image00042.jpg]Figure 37. Proposed design of “Manned Orbiting Laboratory” In order to launch both a Gemini capsule and the MOL, the Titan IIIC wasdeveloped by Martin Marietta (later incorporated into Lockheed Martin in 1995).The Titan IIIC would have two booster rockets attached to the first stage toprovide the necessary thrust to get the MOL into space.Nearly two years after the Secretary of Defense gave the go-ahead for MOLfeasibility studies to begin, President Johnson appeared at an August 25, 1965,press conference to publicly authorize the construction and testing of MOL. Itwas given a budget of $1.5 billion beginning in fiscal year 1965/66. DouglasAircraft Company was authorized to build the cylindrical laboratory and themodified Gemini capsule for re-entry, while General Electric would build theexperimental equipment. [363] [text00029.html#_edn363]What neither the 1963 Pentagon press release nor Johnson’s 1965 press statementrevealed is that USAF astronauts would be conducting surveillance operationsover designated targets, as a declassified top secret document to Major GeneralBen Frank, commander of the USAF Space Systems Division, dated March 10, 1964,confirmed. [364] [text00029.html#_edn364] Another declassified top secret USAFdocument dated May 25, 1965, declared: “The Initial objective is to develop anddemonstrate at the earliest time an operationally useful high resolution mannedoptical reconnaissance system”. [365] [text00029.html#_edn365] A PBS documentarypresented interviews with former astronaut participants – dubbed “astrospies” –who pointed out the likely primary targets to be in the former Soviet Union: The plan was to launch a two-man Gemini capsule atop a 56-foot-long laboratorymodule.… the astrospies could look through a view-port and observe andphotograph high priority targets in Russia and elsewhere. When the 30-daymission was completed, the astrospies would return to Earth in the Geminicapsule, leaving the laboratory module to de-orbit and burn up in theatmosphere. [366] [text00029.html#_edn366] Polar Orbit Missions Designed to Spy on Antarctic Germans, not RussiansDeclassified National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) documents give the falseimpression that the Soviet Union/Russia was the primary target of MOL. [367][text00029.html#_edn367] However, as stated in a previous chapter, former CIAagent Kewper/Stein revealed that the space activities of the Germans launchingout of Antarctica and visiting extraterrestrials were the real targets ofadvanced aerial surveillance technologies. Kewper/Stein explained that thePentagon was trying to distinguish between the extraterrestrial and Germancraft, which differed significantly in terms of their flight performance. [368][text00029.html#_edn368]Other declassified NRO documents reveal that satellites intended for polarorbits required their launch to take place from Vandenberg Air Force Base,California, since a take-off from Kennedy Space Center required a difficultdog-leg maneuver which consumed more fuel, thereby requiring heavier payloadsand a danger to the Florida coast population. [369] [text00029.html#_edn369]Secretary of the Air Force Harold Brown wrote the following letter explainingwhy a polar orbit was required for MOL missions: Because polar orbits are required, the TITAN IIIC MOL launches can be easilyperformed by flying south from Vandenberg Air Force Base. Flying due south fromCape Kennedy would result in the trajectory passing directly over southernFlorida, and this would be totally unacceptable from range safetyconsiderations. [370] [text00029.html#_edn370] However, if the primary goal of MOL was to spy on the Soviet Union, then polarorbits were a very inefficient way of doing this. A geosynchronous orbit overthe USSR would have provided the optimal surveillance options, as explained inscholarly research by Major A. Andronov titled “American Geosynchronous SIGINTSatellites”. [371] [text00029.html#_edn371] A major disadvantage of a satellitein geosynchronous orbit is that it has trouble monitoring activities near thepoles. In contrast, a polar orbiting satellite traveling at a near 90 degreesinclination would provide a clear view of the poles for monitoring the activityof the German colony and their extraterrestrial allies operating fromAntarctica. In addition, a declassified document titled “Application of MOL toAstronomical Observations” reveals MOL was intended to be used for planetaryobservation also, which is best achieved by a polar orbit which allowsobservation of virtually every part of the Earth. This supports the idea thatamong MOL’s real goals as a manned space station was to monitor space trafficentering and leaving the Earth – both from the Antarctic Germans andextraterrestrials. [372] [text00029.html#_edn372]MOL, NASA, and the Secret Astronaut CorpsOf particular significance is the arrangement reached between the Department ofDefense and NASA when it came to funding and running MOL. In May 1964, Secretaryof Defense Robert McNamara had reached an agreement with NASA AdministratorJames Webb on MOL, and on September 25 they came up with the followingmanagement plan: [373] [text00029.html#_edn373] 1. DOD and NASA will agree that the MOL is the flight forerunner to the definition of a scientific or military operational space craft. 2. NASA will accept the responsibility of manager of the scientific program to be carried out using the MOL. All such scientific experiments (except those that may be classified for security purposes) will be selected, developed, and analyzed by NASA. The funding for this work will be provided by NASA. Our planning indicates that substantial weight and volume can be made available in the MOL after accommodation of particular classified experiments. In addition, we would be prepared to consider variations in MOL configuration for specific scientific purposes on particular flights of the program. [374] [text00029.html#_edn374]NASA, through its Antarctic German de facto representatives, would effectivelybe monitoring what the USAF was planning to do with its MOL program and pass onwhatever intelligence data was gained to the Fourth Reich leaders in Antarctica.In January 1964, the USAF arranged for military pilots to start training for theMOL program, using the cover of NASA’s civilian astronaut program. Adeclassified “Proposed Release” revealed that “Astronaut candidates will bemilitary test pilots and graduates of the Aerospace Research Pilot School atEdwards AFB, California.” [375] [text00029.html#_edn375] A transcript from a PBSdocumentary described the strict secrecy surrounding the parallel militaryastronaut training program: NARRATOR: Run by Chuck Yeager, the first man to fly faster than the speed ofsound, ARPS [Aerospace Research Pilot School] was a school where some militarypilots, with the right stuff, were groomed to become astronauts in NASA'scivilian space program. This year it was different.RICHARD TRULY: As we went through our student year, and got toward the fall, werealized that something funny was going on. And the thing that was funny goingon was, they were actually conducting a secret, I guess you'd say crewselection.JAMES BAMFORD: Without them knowing it, they were actually competing with eachother for this program. They were being watched and being evaluated by thesepeople to see who would make the best astronauts. The program was so secret, itwas even kept from the potential astronauts themselves. [376][text00029.html#_edn376] The military pilots being secretly trained in 1964 for classified space missionsworked alongside colleagues who would later serve as NASA astronauts. The USAFbelieved that their pilots/MOL astronauts would learn what was necessary to beable to successfully work in space from the Operation Paperclip scientistsrunning NASA’s Apollo and Gemini programs. After all, USAF leaders were awarethat Antarctic German astronauts were flying into deep space and other solarsystems while the Air Force was still trying to establish a presence in nearEarth orbit. Whatever the Germans had learned from their space operations,assurances had been made that some of this would be passed on to Apollo andGemini program astronauts through von Braun, Debus, and other OperationPaperclip scientists in touch with their German brethren in Antarctica. In turn,the USAF hoped its pilots enrolled with NASA’s astronaut corps would learn whatit took to operate in space for extended periods. This kind of mutual sharing ofresources and knowledge was at the core of the secret agreements reached atHolloman AFB in 1955. MOL, as publicly announced, was only the preliminary phaseof something much more ambitious than the USAF was planning.Advanced Phase of MOL Links Multiple Modules Together The Manned Orbiting Laboratory was conceived as only the first phase of a moreambitious Air Force military space station plan. Phase II involved expanding themodular system to allow more diverse operations to be performed in space overlonger periods in orbit, as explained by Lt Col Mark Erikson: The system itself consisted of a permanently orbiting station module, anearth-based spacecraft comprised of a modified-Gemini capsule for ferrypurposes, and a new launch vehicle, probably the Titan III. The crew of fourcould remain in the 1,700-cubic-foot-station module for 30 days withoutresupply, while the station itself would remain in orbit for at least a year.The USAF fully expected MODS [Military Orbital Development System] to grow:“Ultimately, as MODS is expanded through modular extension, it will serve as abase from which experimental military space vehicles can be developed, testedand employed. [377] [text00029.html#_edn377] Correspondence on October 1963 between the Department of Defense (DOD) and NASAofficials, as part of a “DOD-NASA Coordination Agreement”, described in moredetail what Phase II would entail: Phase II (a) is aimed at the selection of major subsystems such as dockingsystem, artificial g system, data handling system, etc., and will incorporateresults of the modified Gemini and Apollo Ferry Studies … A broad look atsubsystem integration is planned utilizing inputs from such current studies asNuclear Isotope Power … and Integrated Life Support System… [378][text00029.html#_edn378] What this correspondence shows is that the completed space station would have anartificial gravity system and use nuclear power. The presence of an artificialgravity system divulges that Phase II would involve a design in which the spacestation would rotate around a central axis. This suggests a design similar towhat Werner von Braun had proposed back in 1946, which has been dubbed the “VonBraun Station”. It incorporated 20-cylindrical sections connected end-to-end: The 1946 version used 20 cylindrical sections, each about 3 m in diameter and 8m long, to make up the toroid. The whole station was about 50 m in diameter andguy wires connecting and positioning the toroid to the 8 m-diameter centralpower module. This was equipped with a sun-following solar collector dish toheat fluid in a ball-shaped device. The heated fluid would run an electricalgenerator. Presumably visiting spacecraft would dock or transfer crew at thebase of the power module. Two narrow transfer tubes allowed the crew to movebetween the living and work quarters in the toroid and the power module. [379][text00029.html#_edn379] In the completed Phase II space station, each section would be made up of MOLcylinders sent up separately on a Titan III rocket, and then assembled togetherin space. Given that each MOL cylinder was anticipated to be 56 feet (17 meters)in length (double what von Braun envisaged), the final diameter of the spacestation would be over 300 feet (91 meters) in diameter. [380][text00029.html#_edn380]A declassified document titled “MOL Program Advanced Planning”, issued on March17, 1967, shows that the funding and planning for Phase II were completelyseparated from the basic MOL program. [381] [text00029.html#_edn381] This madeit possible for the basic MOL program to be publicly canceled down the trackwhile the advanced portion (Phase II) involving more complex projects andobjectives (i.e., assembling a type of ‘Von Braun Station’ in space) couldcontinue uninterrupted as a covert program. A picture containing bicycle, floor, sitting, outdoor Description automaticallygenerated [Image00043.jpg]Figure 38. Von Braun Space StationHow the Public was Misled: Cancellation of MOLOn July 1, 2015, the National Reconnaissance Office approved thedeclassification and release of 825 official documents describing the officialhistory of MOL and its different phases. [382] [text00029.html#_edn382] What thedocuments reveal is that an “unmanned version” of MOL was covertly developedusing the same laboratory modules developed by Douglas Aircraft Company for themanned version. Cancelation of Phase I of the MOL program became the cover forimplementing the advanced Phase II of MOL; construction of a Von Braun Stationusing the modules designed and developed by Douglas but built by differentcontractors such as Martin Marietta.In a declassified April 17, 1969, top secret memorandum by the Secretary ofDefense to President Nixon, it was outlined out how the manned version of theMOL program could be canceled, but an unmanned version would secretly continue(out of Vandenberg AFB using Titan IIID rockets). [383] [text00029.html#_edn383] The manned MOL was officially canceled on June 9, 1969, in amemorandum by the Deputy Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of the Air Forcewhich gave instructions for the continuance of the unmanned version with a newcontractor competition: The Air Force is hereby directed to terminate the MOL Program except for thosecamera system elements useful for incorporation into an unmanned satellitesystem optimized to use the TITAN III D. Directions to MOL contractors should beissued on Tuesday morning, June 10, at which time we will also notify theCongress and make a public statement that MOL is canceled…All future work on the camera and an unmanned system will be part of the NRP[National Reconnaissance Project]. As a security measure, appropriate elementsof the MOL Project Offices and the camera system contracts should be transferredto the Air Force NRP Special Projects Offices at an early date. Overt MOLactivities should be phased out in conjunction with closeout of MOL Programactivities. [384] [text00029.html#_edn384] This meant that Air Force Systems Command, which had been initially in controlof building the manned version of MOL, had to transfer primary responsibilityover to the National Reconnaissance Office, through the rubric of the NationalReconnaissance Project (NRP). This arrangement would make it easier to hide USAFinvolvement in the advanced MOL program.Another declassified top secret memorandum, dated June 7, 1969, two days beforethe official public cancelation, made clear that the “unmanned MOL program”being covertly continued had been shown in studies to be significantly lessefficient than the manned version. Strikingly, it would use the entire “MOLMission module” originally intended for use in the more costly manned version: ALL CONCERNED RECOGNIZE THAT AN UNMANNED SYSTEM USING THE MOL CAMERA WILL HAVEPOORER AVERAGE RESOLUTION, BE LESS CAPABLE AND FLEXIBLE, BE LESS RELIABLE, ETC.,THAN THE MANNED MOL WOULD HAVE BEEN. …THE GE [General Electric] AND EK [Eastman Kodak] CONTRACTS ARE TO BE REDUCEDIMMEDIATELY TO ONLY THOSE CAMERA SYSTEM EFFORTS APPLICABLE TO A NOT-YET-DEFINEDUNMANNED SATELLITE SYSTEM THAT WILL USE THE COMPLETE MOL MISSION MODULE. [385][text00029.html#_edn385] This document is critical since it shows that despite the cancellation of themanned MOL program, the “complete mission module” that had been designed anddeveloped by Douglas Aircraft Company would continue to be used for the unmannedversion.It’s worth pointing out that the unmanned version of MOL was NOT the “Hexagon”unmanned camera satellite that was being simultaneously planned as part of theKeyHole 9 series of spy satellites that the USAF would launch in conjunctionwith the NRO out of Vandenberg AFB on Titan IIID rockets from 1971 to 1986.[386] [text00029.html#_edn386] While both the unmanned MOL and Hexagon would belaunched on Titan IIID rockets, they were entirely separate programs. In fact,the Keyhole satellites were a very effective cover program for the more highlyclassified advanced MOL program.The June 7, 1969, memorandum went on to describe that the different contractorsoriginally involved in the design and construction of the manned MOL would beallowed to compete for contracts related to future unmanned MOL missions: EARLY IN FY 1970, IT IS PLANNED TO HOLD A FUNDED COVERT SPACECRAFT COMPETITIONBETWEEN LMSC/GE/EK AND MAC-D /GE/EK. MAC-D WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO PROPOSE AREPACKAGING OF APPROPRIATE MOL COMPONENTS AND SUBSYSTEMS… [387][text00029.html#_edn387] It was later decided that the McDonnell Douglas Company (MAC-D), which wascreated out of a merger between Douglas Aircraft Company and MacDonnell Aircraftin 1967, would not be awarded the contract for building the modules to be usedin the advanced unmanned MOL program, thereby leading to mass layoffs for thecompany. It was a major McDonnell Douglas competitor, Lockheed Missiles andSpace Company (LMSC) that was given the covert contract.Lockheed had been granted the resupply contract for the original manned MOLprogram and was able to adapt their resupply efforts for the more complexadvanced unmanned MOL program prior to the cancellation of the basic MOLprogram. A declassified 1967 document, titled “Lockheed DORIAN Resupply Study”confirms that Lockheed was in charge of resupply missions using Titan IIIDrockets from Vandenberg. The study showed a modular design that could beinterlinked, as in a Van Braun Station. This study is evidence that Lockheed gotthe covert contract for the advanced phase of MOL. [388][text00029.html#_edn388]Another declassified NRO document, titled “Advanced MOL Planning: Missions andSystems” shows General Electric’s plan for reconfiguring MOL so it could hold aspace crew of either 12 or 40, depending on how many sections of modules werelinked together in the advanced MOL program. [389] [text00029.html#_edn389] Thedocument describes the command module characteristics of MOL and states that byusing “three mated cylinders” (each cylinder section is composed of modules), acrew of up to 40 could be accommodated. Interestingly, the proposed spacestation would have self-defense capabilities and be powered either by solararrays or another power supply which is blacked out in the document’s text butis presumably a nuclear generator (see Figure 39).[Image00044.gif]Figure 39. General Electric Proposal for Spaceborne Command Posts The “Advanced MOL Planning: Missions and Systems” document also illustrates boththe configuration of the advanced station and some of its various Earthsurveillance activities that General Electric envisaged for the program (seeFigure 40). Significantly, the proposed space station was designed to monitorthreats posed by Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launchedballistic missiles (SLBMs) and aircraft by relaying real-time surveillance ofthese to Strategic Air Command. It’s possible that the self-defense capabilityof the space station could eventually enable it to intercept and neutralize suchthreats.A close up of a map Description automatically generated [Image00045.jpg]Figure 40. General Electric's illustration of a three section station built withMOL modules that could accommodate 40 astronauts. The declassified “Advanced MOL Planning: Missions and Systems” proposal byGeneral Electric answers a perplexing question raised by the June 11, 1985,entry in the daily presidential diary of Ronald Reagan. In it, he wrote that hehad been briefed about the 300 astronauts the U.S. could simultaneously placeinto orbit. [390] [text00029.html#_edn390] Reagan was not writing about NASA’sspace shuttle fleet which could accommodate a crew of 10 on each of the fiveshuttles, making a maximum of 50 people put into space if all the shuttles tookoff simultaneously. However, if the USAF/NRO/NASA had created two or more secretspace stations using MOL modules assembled in space into a configuration similarto the Von Braun Station, then it is easy to fathom the truth behind what Reaganwas told in a briefing which he documented in the presidential diary. Thetraining of Air Force and Navy pilots for the advanced MOL program very likelyduplicated the same process used in the canceled basic MOL program, in whichpilots were covertly recruited for the classified space program although theywere led to believe they were being trained to be NASA astronauts. Von Braun and the Real Purpose Behind the USAF/NRO/NASA Space Station Of particular interest when examining the developments leading to the differentphases of the space station is the role of Fairchild Industries in the canceledmanned MOL program and its likely continuation in the same role for the advancedMOL program. Fairchild Industries’ role included life support functions for themilitary astronauts: NASA MAY REPEAT MAY PICK UP THE FAIRCHILD-HILLER EFFORT, PART OF THE IBM EFFORT(PRINTERS), THE MOLECULAR SIEVE, AND SOME OF THE LIFE SUPPORT ITEMS, BUT THOSEAPPEAR TO BE ABOUT THE ONLY ONES. [391] [text00029.html#_edn391] The involvement of Fairchild Industries (formerly Fairchild Hiller up until1971) in running the life support functions for the canceled basic manned MOLprogram, which in turn could be used in the advanced “unmanned program”, ishighly significant. After Wernher von Braun officially retired from NASA and theMarshall Space Flight Center in 1972, he immediately moved over to FairchildIndustries located in Germantown, Maryland, and became their vice president.[392] [text00029.html#_edn392] It’s worth emphasizing that von Braun had donethe most work in conceptualizing a viable space station that began with his 1946von Braun Station proposal which was to be built in a modular fashion.At Fairchild Industries, von Braun led the secret effort to link together inspace the MOL modules originally designed by McDonnell Douglas for the mannedmissions into the required modular sections, just as the Von Braun Stationconceptualization had proposed. Lockheed Martin, General Electric and FairchildIndustries were all deeply involved in building the stealth space station(s) forthe NRO/USAF/NASA. Fairchild Industries’ connection to the Antarctic Germanprogram was firmly established with von Braun’s tenure as vice president. Whileat Fairchild, von Braun met Carol Rosin, who was employed there as a corporatemanager from 1974 through 1977. She became von Braun’s spokesperson after he wasstricken with cancer, and in 2000 she publicly disclosed von Braun’s concernsover secret corporate plans for a false alien invasion in order to weaponizespace. [393] [text00029.html#_edn393] The ultimate agenda was to use such astaged attack to justify major countries such as the U.S. giving up theirnational sovereignty to a one-world government, which would be secretlycontrolled by the Antarctic Germans and their Draconian allies.Later, in 1996, Fairchild Industries took over Dornier which had assembled theHaunebu flying saucers for Nazi Germany from key components provided by otherGerman aviation companies during World War II. [394] [text00029.html#_edn394]Dornier scientists were among those that continued to secretly work with theAntarctic Germans in constructing new spacecraft out of their hidden bases usingthe latest technological advances by the U.S. and other nations. Rosin’stestimony suggests that the Antarctic Germans planned to use the space stationssecretly assembled under the advanced MOL program in their plan to stage a falsealien invasion.Advanced holographic technologies would be beamed to Earth from either themanned stations or Earth orbiting satellite networks connected with a NASAproject called “Blue Beam”. Project Blue Beam was first publicly exposed in 1994by the journalist Serge Monast, who mysteriously died of a heart attack in 1996even though he had no history of heart disease. [395] [text00029.html#_edn395]Monast wrote about Project Blue Beam as an elaborate multistage attempt to setup a one-world religion using the holographic projections of religious figures.He confirmed that Project Blue Beam also involved staging a false alieninvasion, as described by Rosin and others, to get public support for radicallyreforming political institutions to pave the way for a one-world government.There are many conclusions to be drawn from the space station programs. Thepublic had been deceived into believing that MOL had been canceled in 1969. Infact, only the basic MOL program was terminated, not the more ambitious andadvanced “unmanned” MOL program using complete MOL modules which were secretlylaunched into space from Vandenberg AFB. Throughout the 1970‘s and 1980‘s, theseunmanned MOL modules were initially assembled into the three-sectionconfiguration proposed by General Electric, and eventually, into largerconfigurations such as the 20-section Von Braun Station. It’s also important tokeep in mind that the modules offered life support systems and were fullycapable of supporting a crew.According to Corey Goode, he saw electronically archived classified documents ofthe assembled USAF/NRO space station during his “20 years and back” secret spaceprogram service from 1987 to 2007. Goode described the space station as havingnine modular cylindrical sections joined together into a circular arrangement –a nonagon – similar in overall shape to the Von Braun Station, but with lessthan half the sections. Using General Electric’s crew estimates for athree-section configuration capable of housing 40 crew, a nine-sectionconfiguration would hold approximately 120 crew. Goode said that there arecurrently two or three of these space stations in operation which have beenoutfitted with advanced stealth technologies. [396] [text00029.html#_edn396]Goode’s covert service began in 1987, so it’s possible that by then two or threenonagon stations had already been built, based on Reagan’s diary entry about hisbriefing where he identified 300 crew members orbiting in space.While Goode believes the stations were created using “space junk” from thedisused stages of the many rockets used to launch satellites, it makes moresense that these were in fact the MOL modules sent up on Titan IIID rockets fromVandenberg AFB. Goode provided a graphic illustration of the nonagon-shapedspace station he witnessed during his covert space service (see Figure 41). Thedeclassified NRO files corroborate Goode’s claim that theUSAF/Military-industrial Complex secret space program had assembled multiplenine-sided versions of the Von Braun station which are currently in operation.A close up of a device Description automatically generated [Image00046.jpg]Figure 41. Space Station comprised of nine cylindrical sections. Credit: SphereBeing Alliance It is certain that the USAF, NRO, and NASA had competing agendas for the mannedspace stations that had been covertly set up. For the USAF, the covert spacestations offered the high ground for dealing with future national securitythreats from Earth or in space using advanced weapons systems that would beadded over time, such as “Rods of God” (a kinetic energy projectile) technology.For the NRO, the space stations offered an unprecedented vantage point forglobal and space surveillance of both the Antarctic Germans and visitingextraterrestrial civilizations. For NASA, which had been deeply infiltrated bythe Antarctic Germans, the space stations offered a means of monitoring USAF/NROactivities, learning about the different extraterrestrial groups visiting Earth,and using such information to stage a Project Blue Beam global religious eventor alien invasion."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14USAF Antigravity “Alien Reproduction Vehicles” “I can tell you about a contract we recently received … The Skunk Works has beenassigned the task of getting E.T. back home.”– Ben Rich, Director of Lockheed’s Skunkworks [397] [text00029.html#_edn397] F rom the early 1970’s, Vandenberg Air Force Base was used to launch Titan IIIrockets carrying Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) modules and, when necessary,military astronauts in Gemini B capsules who could assemble together the modulesin space to create the different modular configurations before returning toEarth. One configuration revealed by declassified National Reconnaissance Office(NRO) documents was a station design proposed by General Electric using “threemated cylinders” (cylindrical sections) that could accommodate 40 astronauts.[398] [text00029.html#_edn398] As more modules were delivered into Earth orbitthroughout the 1970’s and into the early 1980’s, the three-section stationconfiguration could be expanded into completely different and largerconfigurations. This would make it possible to assemble the nine-sided nonagonthat Corey Goode had read about, whose design was based on von Braun’s original1946 idea of building a space station by assembling cylindrical modular sectionsin a circular formation.As mentioned in chapter 13, a declassified NRO document titled “Advanced MOLPlanning: Missions and Systems” showed in great detail General Electric’s planfor configuring MOL modules so they could hold a space crew of either 12 in a“one-cylinder station” or 40 in a “three-cylinder station”. [399][text00029.html#_edn399] A close up of the proposed space station “Command Post”shows modules for crew living quarters, general quarters and housekeeping, aresupply area and combat information center, along with docking ports and solararray energy panels (see Figure 42). [400] [text00029.html#_edn400] Anothersource, including nuclear generators could replace the large solar array panelsdesigned for supplying energy to the three-section station. A close up of a map Description automatically generated [Image00047.jpg]Figure 42. Declassified NRO document showing General Electric Proposal forassembling a “Command Post” Space Station from MOL modules The larger configurations undoubtedly existed by the time of President Reagan’s1985 diary entry referring to the U.S. having the capability of placing 300astronauts in orbit. If 40 astronauts could fit into General Electric’sthree-section configuration of MOL modules (with roughly 13 astronauts persection), then it would take approximately 22 sections comprising various MOLmodules to accommodate permanently 300 astronauts in Earth orbit. This estimateis close to the number of sections originally envisaged by von Braun for his1946 space station design. Alternatively, there could have been up to three ofthe nine-sided configurations that Goode learned of during his secret spaceprogram service.Assembling space stations using different configurations starting from the basicthree-section modular system, to nine (as Goode disclosed) or 20 (as von Braunconceived) would take multiple trips by the Saturn III rockets ferrying themodules, military astronauts and additional equipment up on particular missions.The “Advanced MOL Planning: Missions and Systems” document also contains a flowchart showing how manned operations would begin in 1972, and by 1979, thethree-section Command Post would have been completed.A close up of a map Description automatically generated [Image00048.jpg]Figure 43 Declassified NRO document showing General Electric Proposal forAssembling Space Station over 1970’s However, accommodating 300 astronauts in orbit required more than thethree-section design presented by General Electric. Many more sections made upof the MOL modules were needed, thereby requiring significantly more time. Justhow much more time is not clear from the declassified NRO documents, but we canget an idea from how long it took a consortium of nations comprising the U.S.(NASA), Japan (JAXA), Canada (CSA) and Russia (Roscosmos) to assemble thesmaller International Space Station (ISS) that also used a modular constructionprocess. It took the international consortium over 40 space missions and 13years (from 1998 to 2011) to build the ISS, which can accommodate a permanentcrew of up to “six astronauts” [401] [text00029.html#_edn401] –half of what onlyone section of the advanced MOL program could accommodate according to theGeneral Electric proposal. Consequently, it is highly likely that after the 1969cancellation of the basic MOL program and the start of the advanced program, theperiod spanning the 1970’s into the early 1980’s was spent assembling the largerUSAF/NASA/NRO space station(s).To have already placed 300 astronauts in space by 1985, the USAF/NASA/NRO wouldhave had to quietly develop a delivery system far more advanced than the TitanIII rockets with their Gemini B capsules that could carry only two astronauts ata time. A more sophisticated transportation system was indeed developed to ferryastronauts and supplies to the space stations. This ambitious feat was achievedby using antigravity technologies acquired through the successful reverseengineering of captured alien spacecraft.Reverse Engineering a Better Delivery SystemIn chapter 3, it was mentioned that the USAF had retrieved four saucer craftfrom Nazi Germany under Operation Paperclip. The craft had been taken first toWright Field/Wright Patterson AFB for study and reverse engineering purposes.Sometime before 1958, the four craft were then taken to Area 51’s S4 facilityfor further study and storage alongside three extraterrestrial craft that hadbeen retrieved from New Mexico. However, German scientists brought to the U.S.under Operation Paperclip provided little help to the USAF in understanding suchadvanced technologies. Aside from a few like Professor Otto Schumann, most ofthe Paperclip scientists’ area of expertise were rockets rather than exoticpropulsion systems using high voltage electrostatics and highly pressurizedplasma circuits.Only after agreements were reached between the Eisenhower Administration and theAntarctic Germans in the 1950’s did the USAF begin to receive reliable help intheir study and reverse engineering efforts of the captured German andextraterrestrial craft. German Paperclip scientists placed in senior NASApositions were in regular touch with their Antarctic brethren, as evidenced byHans Kammler being witnessed at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in the mid-1960’s.[402] [text00029.html#_edn402] Since the Apollo, Gemini and Skylab programswere a means for NASA to covertly move enormous resources and manpower into NASAprograms that directly helped the Antarctic Germans develop large space battlegroups capable of interstellar travel. The Germans in return assisted the USAFto reverse engineer the comparatively small antigravity flying saucers of bothGerman and extraterrestrial origin stored at Wright Patterson and Area 51. TheUSAF was helped in developing smaller surveillance craft using advancedantigravity technologies because they posed no strategic threat to the AntarcticGerman’s far larger space battle groups capable of interstellar travel.In addition to their precarious German partners, the USAF also worked tenuouslywith Gray aliens under the agreements reached in the mid-1950’s. Engineers suchas Bill Uhouse have revealed how the Gray aliens helped the USAF understandpropulsion and navigation systems on the flying saucers, yet progress remainedvery slow in modifying the Gray’s spacecraft for the significantly larger humanpilots. According to Charles Hall, by the 1960’s the USAF was also receivinghelp from the Tall Whites in developing prototype nuclear powered saucer-shapedcraft capable of reaching the Moon. Hall described how parsimonious the TallWhites were in allowing senior USAF officers or scientists to witness theirconstruction process, denying access to the more advanced aerospace technologiesneeded for interstellar travel. Whatever spacecraft the USAF developed with, orgained from, the Tall Whites was very limited in range and capacity.Nevertheless, such craft could be used to ferry military astronauts and suppliesinto low Earth orbit for constructing the USAF/NRO/NASA manned space stations.This means that in addition to the Titan III rockets fitted with Gemini Bcapsules holding only two member crews, the USAF could also ferry militaryastronauts and equipment into Earth orbit using the prototype flying saucersproduced from their various reverse engineering projects. We can get an idea ofthe size and holding capacity of these saucers from what whistleblowers haverevealed about these “Alien Reproduction Vehicles”.Three Kinds of Alien Reproduction VehiclesThe most detailed description of what these reverse engineered craft looked likecomes from an aviation patent illustrator, Brad Sorensen, who witnessed threeflying saucer craft at Edwards AFB on November 12, 1988. After attending a USAFairshow at Norton AFB in San Bernardino, California, Sorensen was then takenover to Kern County in Southern California to a restricted area within EdwardsAFB. There he saw the three flying saucer craft which were hovering with otheradjacent exhibits, along with a video demonstration of the flight performanceand specifications of the smallest of the saucer-shaped craft. Mark McCandlish,a professional aviation illustrator who was a friend and colleague of Sorenson,had declined an invitation to attend the Norton airshow but later explained whatSorensen had later told him: He said that the smallest was somewhat bell-shaped. They were all identical inshape and proportion, except that there were three different sizes. Thesmallest, at its widest part, was flat on the bottom, somewhat bell-shaped, andhad a dome or a half of a sphere on top…On the inside of the crew compartment was a big column that ran down through themiddle, and there were four ejection seats mounted back-to-back on the upperhalf of this column. Then, right in the middle of the column, was a largeflywheel of some kind.Well, this craft was what they called the Alien Reproduction Vehicle; it wasalso nicknamed the Flux Liner. This antigravity propulsion system – this flyingsaucer – was one of three that were in this hangar at Norton Air Force Base….[403] [text00029.html#_edn403]Sorensen sketched the smallest craft and gave it to McCandlish. From Sorensen’sdetailed sketch, McCandlish was able to render a more comprehensive illustrationof the “Alien Reproduction Vehicle” (ARV) which Sorenson later saw and confirmedas being highly accurate. [404] [text00029.html#_edn404] McCandlish’sillustration showed how the flying saucer was divided into a top cupola sectionseating a crew of four, and a bottom section filled with equipment designed forpower generation, electrical energy storage, propulsion, and navigation (seeFigure 44). Sorensen identified 48 large capacitor stacks capable of holdinglarge electrostatic charges which could be used to store electrical energy forpowering the craft. In an email, McCandlish gave more details about thecapacitor array: There are 48 capacitor stacks of eight plates each; (I call them \"stacks orsections in a capacitor array\") the total number of plates is 384 (48 X 8=384), with the plates alternating in polarity (positive and negative) as youmove downward through the stack. Four Positive and four negative. Theyterminate in two vertical bars offset from one-another, tying the four plates ofeach polarity together. So there is one positive connection and one negativeconnection for each eight-plate stack. The entire array is embedded in anocclusion and bubble-free block, of centrifugally-cast Boron glass doped withHerkimer Quartz-Diamond. [405] [text00029.html#_edn405] The 48 capacitors also had another very important purpose. They were designed togenerate antigravity propulsion using the Biefeld-Brown Effect, which occurswhen a large electrostatic charge is generated on the anode or positive plate ofa capacitor. [406] [text00029.html#_edn406] A picture containing map, text Description automatically generated[Image00049.jpg]Figure 44. Cutaway of ARV showing 48 large capacitor stacks of eight plates eachand oxygen cyclinders. Copyright (March, 1989): Mark McCandlish. All rightsreserved. [407] [text00029.html#_edn407] The Biefeld-Brown Effect dates back to 1923 when Thomas Townsend Brown firstlearned that high voltage electrostatic charges could provide a previouslyunknown thrust to a capacitor. He cooperated with a professor of physics atOhio’s Denison University, Dr. Alfred Biefeld, in improving his experiments andmeasurements. Brown filed for a British patent in August 1927, which was grantedto him in November 1928. [408] [text00029.html#_edn408] The title for hissuccessful patent was: “A Method of and an Apparatus or Machine for ProducingForce or Motion.” In the accompanying text of the patent, Brown described hisinvention:This invention relates to a method of controlling gravitation and for derivingpower therefrom, and to a method of producing linear force or motion. The methodis fundamentally electrical. The invention also relates to machines or apparatusrequiring electrical energy that control or influence the gravitational field orthe energy of gravitation; also to machines or apparatus requiring electricalenergy that exhibit a linear force or motion which is believed to be independentof all frames of reference save that which is at rest relative to the universetaken as a whole, and said linear force or motion is furthermore believed tohave no equal and opposite reaction that can be observed by any method commonlyknown and accepted by the physical science to date. [409][text00029.html#_edn409]The application of the Biefeld-Brown effect is succinctly presented inMcCandlish’s explanation of how navigation was achieved by manipulating theelectric charge in each capacitor/plate so that it would send the AlienReproduction Vehicle in one direction or another:Why so many different capacitor sections? If you just have one big disc … inthat case, you have levitation, but you don't get any control. You have thisthing floating around, and it's just sort of floating on whatever this field isthat it's producing, but you don't have any control.So, what happens? You break that disc up into 48 different sections, and thenyou can decide how much electricity you want to put on this side or over thereon that side, so you can control the amount of electricity and the amount ofthrust and vectoring that you get. You can make it go straight up, you can makeit bank and turn and pitch – whatever you want to, by virtue of the fact thatyou can control where the electricity goes in those 48 different sections. Ifyou ever take a circle and divide it up into 48 equal sections, you'll find thatthose are really thin little slices. So, you have these 48 individualcapacitors, and you have one big Tesla coil. You've got to have some kind of arotating spark gap, just like the distributor in your car, that sends theelectricity out to each of those sections. Then, you have to have some way ofcontrolling how much electricity goes to each one. [410][text00029.html#_edn410]Put simply, McCandlish has pointed out that the craft could be steered bysending a high voltage electrostatic charge to a specific capacitor plate amongthe 48, thereby generating thrust in the direction that the positive plate/anodewas pointing.As to the question of what powered the ARV, McCandlish said that it could tapinto the zero-point energy field of the vacuum. This would make the ARV capableof generating sufficient electrical power for all its energy needs: There is a scientist in Utah by the name of Moray B. King – he wrote a bookcalled Tapping the Zero Point Energy . What he maintains is that this energy isembedded in space-time all around us: it’s in everything we see. I think it wasJames Clerk Maxwell who speculated that there’s enough of this flux, thiselectrical charge, in the nothingness of space, that if you could capture allthe energy that was embedded in just a cubic yard of space, you’d have enoughenergy to boil the oceans of the entire world…. This Alien Reproduction Vehicle,this Flux Liner, has a way of doing this somehow electronically. Now, Brad haddescribed the fact that this central column has a kind of vacuum chamber in it.The vacuum chamber is one of the things that all of these scientists describe inthese over-unity or free-energy devices they build. They all have some kind ofvacuum tubes, vacuum technology. [411] [text00029.html#_edn411] McCandlish went on to describe the mass cancellation effect that would becreated as energy was drawn from the vacuum flux, thereby allowing the ARV todefy the laws of inertia. This would enable the ARV to accelerate to incrediblespeeds and travel great distances without its occupants experiencing unduestress due to changes in inertia.Sources Corroborating Sorensen’s 1988 ARV Sighting Mark McCandlish says that in 1992 at an Edwards AFB airshow, he spoke with KentSellen, a former Air Force non-commissioned officer (NCO) who had worked as acrew chief for an aircraft being test flown at Edwards in 1973. Sellen toldMcCandlish that in 1973, he saw a flying saucer hovering in a Quonset-stylehangar which was under heavy military security. McCandlish recounts Sellen’sstory: He [told me] one night [his] shift supervisor [had told him], \"Go out to NorthBase – they've got a ground power unit for an aircraft that's leaking or failedor something, so we need you to take a tow vehicle out there. Go out, pick itup, bring it back, drop it off at the repair depot; then you can go for thenight, because we've finished all our other work.\" Well, instead of going aroundthe big perimeter road that goes up to the main entrance of North Base, KentSellen drove straight across the dry lake bed at Edwards to the North Basefacility. He [came] up off the dry lake bed, [rolled] right up on the tarmac,and [was] going down these rows of hangars - they [were] all Quonset-stylehangars back then. He [stopped] in front of the first one with the doorscracked, expecting to find this defective ground power unit, and what [did] hesee? He [saw] this flying saucer sitting in the hangar, hovering off the ground.… I [asked], what happened? He [said], \"This thing was flat on the bottom,[with] sloping sides, little cameras in these little plastic domes all over,[and] there was a door on the side. I wasn't there for 15 seconds, [when] Iheard footsteps running up to me, and before I could even turn around and look,there was a machine gun barrel at my throat.\" A gruff voice [said], \"Close youreyes and get on the ground, or we're going to blow your head off.\"They put a hood over his head, blindfolded him, hauled him off, and they spent18 hours debriefing him. While they did, they told him things about this vehiclethat my buddy Brad [Sorensen] didn't even know. [412] [text00029.html#_edn412] The saucer Sellen accidentally saw in 1973 matched the one that Sorensen wouldview and sketch in 1988. In addition, McCandlish says that each of the ARVswitnessed by Sellen and Sorensen had a similar design to a craft that wasphotographed in Provo, Utah, back in 1966 – a photo which was discussed in theCondon Committee. Based on Sellen’s testimony and the 1966 Provo UFO photo,McCandlish felt that he had found independent corroboration for Sorensen’sstory. A person flying through the air on a cloudy day Description automaticallygenerated [Image00050.jpg]Figure 45. Provo, Utah, UFO – July 1966 Comparison of ARVs with Recovered Nazi Flying SaucersAs a former Air Force NCO and crew chief working on test aircraft, Sellen’scorroboration of Sorensen’s ARV is compelling and begs further explorationrelated to all three of the saucer-shaped craft the aviation illustratorwitnessed at Edwards, and how these compare to the Nazi flying saucers broughtinto the United States after World War II. One important observation which willbe shown is the remarkable similarity in the sizes of the Air Force ARVscompared to the Nazi flying saucers. First, here is what McCandlish said aboutthe different sizes of the vehicles that Sorensen viewed:Now, he [Sorensen] said there were three vehicles. The first one - the smallest,the one that was partially taken apart, the one that was shown in the video thatwas running in this hangar November 12, 1988 at Norton Air Force Base – wasabout 24 feet in diameter at its widest part, right at the base. The nextbiggest one was 60 feet in diameter at the base ... the largest of thesevehicles was about 130 feet in diameter. [413] [text00029.html#_edn413]According to McCandlish, the 24 ft vehicle could carry a crew of four in the topcupola section, but details were not provided for how many crew the larger ARVscould hold. However, a rough estimate can be made by a comparison with the Vriland Haunebu series of flying saucers built by Nazi Germany.In chapter 3, Information was given about four Nazi flying saucer craft whichhad been secretly brought to the U.S. under Operation Paperclip to be closelystudied at Wright Patterson AFB and then at the S4 facility at Area 51. [414][text00029.html#_edn414] Let’s examine what is known of the Vril and Haunebuflying saucer craft that had been successfully developed by Nazi Germany, themost advanced of which were taken to Antarctica before the end of World War II.Of these, at least four craft (two Vril and two Haunebu) were captured andbrought into the United States.In my book, Antarctica’s Hidden History , a detailed analysis is givenreviewing the Nazi SS documents that were released at the end of the Cold War bya former member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Vladimir Terziski. [415][text00029.html#_edn415] In 1991, Terziski claims he came into the possession ofa leaked documentary film from the Nazi SS archives that had been shared amongWarsaw Pact countries, which revealed different types of flying saucer craftbuilt in Nazi Germany. [416] [text00029.html#_edn416] The film displayeddocuments that date from late 1944 and early 1945, with detailed data on fourdifferent sized flying saucers that were being flight tested and developed bythe Nazi SS in different underground research facilities. The first three of thefour Nazi flying saucers are comparable in size to those Sorensen saw at EdwardsAFB. The similarities are such that it can be assumed the Air Force designs forthe ARVs were at least partially a result of them having successfully reverseengineered the Vril and Haunebu series saucers that had been brought into theU.S. after the war.The first Nazi SS document from the film details the production statistics offour flying saucer models in terms of how many had been built and the number oftimes each was test flown [see Figure 46]. The document shows that 17 Vril Icraft were built, and flight tested 84 times. This model used a “SchumanLevitator” propulsion system, based on the work of Professor Otto Schumann whowas among the German scientists brought into the U.S. under Operation Paperclip.The Schuman Levitator was an electrogravitic propulsion system that used highvoltage electrostatics to generate thrust similar to the Biefeld-Brown effect.Additional Nazi documents gave the crew size of the Vril I as two, with a flightduration of 5.5 hours and a top speed of 7,200 mph (12, 000 km/hr). [417][text00029.html#_edn417] [Image00051.jpg]Figure 46. Production statistics for Nazi SS Flying Saucers The 38 ft (11.5 meters) diameter Vril I is comparable to the 24 ft (7.3 meters )Air Force ARV witnessed by Sorensen. This is significant given that we know thattwo of the Vril I craft came into the U.S. for study and reverse engineering.The Vri-1 was propelled by a “Schumann SM-Levitator” which incorporated azero-point/free energy device that had been created by German inventor HansColer, with a propulsion system developed by Otto Schumann. [418][text00029.html#_edn418] The charged capacitors in the Vril I could only powerthe craft for 5.5 hours, suggesting that the zero-point energy device was stillquite limited in its power generation capacity. In addition to miniaturizationand developments in modern battery/capacitor technologies, we know fromMcCandlish’s analysis of Sorensen’s design sketch that the reverse engineeredUSAF craft could sufficiently extract energy from the vacuum field for its powerneeds. Consequently, the smaller ARV had a flight time that was significantlylonger than its Nazi forerunner.The Nazi SS production statistics document stated further that two Haunebu Icraft were built and flight tested 52 times. At least one of these two Haunebu Icraft was found and brought to the U.S. under Operation Paperclip. The Haunebu Iwas fitted with E-IV propulsion systems called a “Tachyonator-7 drive” whichwas: … a revolutionary electro-magnetic-gravitic engine which improved Hans Coler’sfree energy machine into an energy Konverter coupled to a Van De Graaf bandgenerator and Marconi vortex dynamo [a spherical tank of mercury] to createpowerful rotating electromagnetic fields that affected gravity and reduced mass.It was designated the Thule Triebwerk [Thrustwork, aka Tachyonator-7 drive].[419] [text00029.html#_edn419] Additional Nazi documents put the Haunebu I crew size at eight with a top speedof 10,200 mph (17,000 km/hr). [420] [text00029.html#_edn420]The 82 ft (25 meters) Hanuebu I is comparable in size to the 60 ft (18.3 meters)Air Force ARV. Given that the smaller 24 ft ARV held twice the number of crewthan the somewhat larger Vril I craft, it can be assumed that the 60 ft ARVcould hold more crew than its somewhat larger Haunebu I counterpart, perhaps asmuch as double the eight crew size of the latter, therefore as many as 16astronauts. Most importantly, the 60 ft ARV possessed an advanced engine capableof generating an independent power supply from the vacuum rather than relying onstored electrical energy. The Haunebu I had a flight endurance of 18 hours, soit can be assumed that the Air Force would have significantly improved thevacuum energy device that powered its ARVs. [421] [text00029.html#_edn421] Thismeant that the 60 ft ARV was capable of longer-term space missions than itsHaunebu I forerunner.Finally, the Nazi SS document showed that seven Haunebu II saucer craft werebuilt and flight tested 106 times. These were also fitted with E-IV propulsionsystems. Additional Nazi documents put its crew size at a maximum of 20 with atop speed of 12,620 mph (21,000 km/hr) and a flight endurance of 55 hours. [422][text00029.html#_edn422] At 105 ft (32 meters), the Haunebu II is comparable insize to the 130 ft (39 meters) Air Force ARV Sorensen witnessed. Again, this isnot accidental given that the Air Force had exhaustively studied the Haunebu IIcraft that had been taken to Wright Field after World War II before being takento Area 51 where it was eventually witnessed in 1958.The fact that the smaller 24 ft ARV held twice the number of crew than itsslightly larger Vril I craft counterpart allows us to estimate that the 130 ftdiameter ARV would have been able to accommodate roughly 40 astronauts. Thelargest of the Air Force’s ARVs would have possessed an advanced engine capableof generating power like the Haunebu II, yet with modern advancements it likelygreatly exceeded the 55 flight hour endurance of the Haunebu II. This also wouldhave made the 130 ft ARV capable of even longer-term deep space missions.While the speeds of the Vril and Haunebu craft cited by Terziski soundimpressive, even by today’s standards of publicly known aerospace vehicles, theyare far less than what Sorensen heard from a four-star Air Force general givinga lecture about the saucers on display at Edwards AFB in 1988. The General saidthat the three ARVs “were capable of doing light speed or better”. [423][text00029.html#_edn423] This suggests that by 1988, the Air Force hadsuccessfully developed zero-point energy devices for generating sufficient powerfor superluminal speeds.

Beginningon September 20, 1983, he would show a slide of a flying saucer and tell theaudience members that Lockheed Martin had gotten a new contract; they had “beenassigned the task of getting E.T. back home.” [424] [text00029.html#_edn424] Atthe time, most took this as the punchline of a joke. However, Rich was likelyalluding to a contract that had been awarded to Lockheed by the USAF to buildspacecraft capable of interstellar travel at superluminal speeds. Rich didn’tsay when the contract had been awarded, but it’s significant that five yearsafter his speech, the USAF was showing off three brand new saucer-shaped craftat Edwards AFB.On March 23, 1993, two years after his retirement and five years after theairshow at Norton AFB, Rich changed his punchline. At an engineering conferencein Los Angeles, he again displayed the flying saucer on screen, but insteadsaid: “We now have the technology to take E.T. home.” [425][text00029.html#_edn425] The audience laughed as before, but privately Richshared with colleagues what was really going on in the classified programs thatSkunkworks was involved in: We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies arelocked up in black projects and it would take an act of God to ever get them outto benefit humanity.... Anything you can imagine, we already know how to do.[426] [text00029.html#_edn426] Rich’s comment here is consistent with Lockheed being given the contract forbuilding the Air Force’s own flying saucers capable of superluminal travelsometime before 1983 and completing them by at least 1988. The saucers werethereafter deployed in the then newly formed USAF Space Command establishedSeptember 1, 1982. [Image00052.jpg] [Image00053.jpg] For further clues into the propulsion and navigation technologies used in theUSAF flying saucers that were capable of “getting E.T. back home”, two DefenseIntelligence Reference Documents written in 2009 discuss how superluminal travelcan be achieved through the development of “Warp Drives” and “TraversableWormholes”. The two documents are titled, “Traversable Wormholes, Stargates, andNegative Energy” and “Warp Drive, Dark Energy, and the Manipulation of ExtraDimensions”. [427] [text00029.html#_edn427] The introductions to the twodocuments state that they are part of “a series of advanced technology reportsproduced in Fiscal Year 2009 under the Defense Advanced Aerospace Weapon SystemApplications (AAWSA) Program.” Both documents were confirmed to be genuine byone of the authors, Dr. Eric Davis, who was surprised to see them publiclycirculated since they carried national security markings of “Unclassified: ForOfficial Use Only”. [428] [text00029.html#_edn428]Based on the evidence considered so far, the USAF and contractors such asLockheed’s Skunkworks had succeeded in greatly improving upon the flightperformance of the Vril and Haunebu models which had been secretly studied atWright Patterson and later at the S-4 facility. The craft were capable ofsuperluminal travel, thus placing USAF astronauts in space and getting them tonearby planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mars. What we now know of the USAFsaucer-shaped ARVs provides a clear answer to what President Reagan’s diaryentry on June 11, 1985, was referring to when he said, “our shuttle capacity issuch that we could orbit 300 people.” [429] [text00029.html#_edn429] Reagan wasalluding to one or more squadrons of the different sized ARVs witnessed atEdwards AFB, which could ferry astronauts into low Earth orbit to work on thesecret USAF/NRO/NASA space stations using MOL modules sent up on Titan IIIDrockets, at least one of which was completed by 1985. Lockheed Martin’sSkunkworks not only played a key role in building the Air Force’s ARVs but alsoin assembling the space station(s) in low Earth orbit.What Brad Sorensen saw in 1988 were operational flying saucers being displayedby their proud owners, the USAF. The Air Force and especially its Space Commandwas not content, however, to only have squadrons of flying saucers complimentsof Lockheed Martin and other aerospace contractors. The Air Force was alreadyworking on significantly larger vehicles than the 130 ft ARV witnessed bySorensen. Now came a radical new aviation concept – flying triangles!"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 15USAF Flying Triangles and the TR-3B I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like thatfelt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success.Nikola TeslaE dgar Fouche served with the US Air Force from 1967 to 1987 before spendinganother eight years with defense contractors working on a number of classifiedaviation programs at Area 51 in the Nellis Air Force Range, Nevada. He hassupplied documents corroborating his USAF military service and work with defensecontractors on various aviation projects. One document showed Fouche wasassigned to Nellis Air Force Base during the period from 1976 to 1979, which iswhen he says he was first assigned to Area 51. Fouche claims he met people thereworking on what were believed to be the Air Force’s most classified aerospaceprograms. [430] [text00029.html#_edn430] During his nearly 30 year career inmilitary aviation, Fouche spent a total of 12 years working at Area 51 invarious capacities for different employers, including the Defense AdvancedResearch Projects Agency (DARPA).When Fouche decided to write a ‘fiction based on fact’ book revealinginformation about the most advanced aerospace technologies currently underdevelopment, he consulted with five close friends who had also worked onclassified aviation projects. [431] [text00029.html#_edn431] In confidentialdiscussions, the group pooled their information about the classified projectsand technologies they had worked on at a number of military facilities acrossthe country. [432] [text00029.html#_edn432] Based on these firsthand accounts,Fouche later claimed that the replacement for the Blackbird SR-71 was a projectcalled “Aurora” involving a group of exotic aircraft. Fouche further claimedthat in addition to the development of hypersonic aircraft, Aurora included aneven more exotic type of craft using antigravity technology.Aviation industry discussion of the Aurora program began in March 1990, due to astory by Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine that revealed: Aurora was inadvertently released in the 1985 US budget, as an allocation of$455 Million for Black aircraft PRODUCTION in FY 1987. Note that this was forbuilding aircraft, not R&D. [433] [text00029.html#_edn433] Prominent Aviation writers Nick Cook, author of The Hunt for Zero Point , andBill Sweetman, subsequently discussed the Aurora program and its likelyexistence. [434] [text00029.html#_edn434] After interviewing Area 51 employees,Sweetman concluded in 2006: Does Aurora exist? Years of pursuit have led me to believe that, yes, Aurora ismost likely in active development, spurred on by recent advances that haveallowed technology to catch up with the ambition that launched the program ageneration ago. [435] [text00029.html#_edn435] Regarding the Aurora Project’s two hypersonic craft, Fouche said: \"The Auroracomprises the SR-75 capable of speeds above Mach 5, and acts as a mother shipfor the SR-74 that can travel at speeds of Mach 18 or more into space to deliversatellites.\" [436] [text00029.html#_edn436] According to Fouche, the SR-74 andSR-75 incorporated advanced stealth capabilities. Such capabilities raise thepossibility that these two craft also incorporated electrogravitics as part oftheir propulsion systems since stealth programs were known to be used as ‘coverprograms’ to hide more sensitive electrogravitic projects. [437][text00029.html#_edn437] This would help explain how the SR-75 could carry theSR-74 piggyback-style to an altitude of 100,000 feet and reach the minimumhypersonic speed of Mach 5.1 to launch the SR-74, as theoretically required forit to fly at even faster hypersonic speeds into low Earth orbit. Therefore, theSR-74 could act as a delivery vehicle for the USAF/NRO space stations, while itsrelatively small size would limit how much it could carry in cargo andpersonnel.A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically generated[Image00054.jpg]Figure 48. Document confirming Edgar Fouche worked at Nellis AFB adjacent toArea 51 According to Fouche, there is a third vehicle belonging to the Aurora Programcalled the “TR-3B” which was the most highly classified program he and otherworkers at the Groom Lake Area 51 facility were aware of: The TR-3B is Code named Astra. The tactical reconnaissance TR-3B firstoperational flight was in the early 90’s. The triangular shaped nuclear poweredaerospace platform was developed under the Top Secret, Aurora Program with SDIand black budget monies. At least three of the billion dollar plus TR-3Bs wereflying by 1994. The Aurora is the most classified aerospace development programin existence. The TR-3B is the most exotic vehicle created by the AuroraProgram. It is funded and operationally tasked by the National ReconnaissanceOffice, the NSA, and the CIA. The TR-3B flying triangle is not fiction and wasbuilt with technology available in the mid-80’s. [438] [text00029.html#_edn438] In addition to nuclear power, Fouche said the TR-3B incorporated three rocketengines using conventional fuel sources like hydrogen, oxygen or methane. [439][text00029.html#_edn439]What makes the TR-3B stand out from other Aurora craft, and the saucer-shapedAlien Reproduction Vehicles (ARV) built by Lockheed for the USAF, is that itused a different type of antigravity effect compared to the electrograviticssystems developed by Townsend Brown. Fouche referred to this antigravity systemas a “Magnetic Field Disrupter”, which rotates highly pressurized mercury-basedplasma around a circular accelerator ring: A circular, plasma filled accelerator ring called the Magnetic Field Disrupter,surrounds the rotatable crew compartment and is far ahead of any imaginabletechnology. Sandia and Livermore laboratories developed the reverse engineeredMFD technology. The government will go to any lengths to protect thistechnology. The plasma, mercury based, is pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres ata temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin and accelerated to 50,000 rpm to create asuper-conductive plasma with the resulting gravity disruption. [440][text00029.html#_edn440] Fouche explained that the Magnetic Field Disrupter (MFD) technology differs fromelectrogravitics insofar as while the latter provides a thrust, MFD technologyreduces weight by a staggering factor of 89%. The MFD generates a magnetic vortex field, which disrupts or neutralizes theeffects of gravity on mass within proximity, by 89 percent. Do notmisunderstand. This is not antigravity. Anti-gravity provides a repulsive forcethat can be used for propulsion. [441] [text00029.html#_edn441] [Image00055.jpg]Figure 49. Illustration of TR-3B. Adapted Edgar Fouche Original Version With the weight of the TR-3B reduced by the MFD technology, this means thatother propulsion systems like nuclear and conventional jet engines could providethe necessary thrust to make the TR-3B outperform conventional vehiclespossessed by the USAF: The MFD creates a disruption of the Earth's gravitational field upon the masswithin the circular accelerator. The mass of the circular accelerator and allmass within the accelerator, such as the crew capsule, avionics, MFD systems,fuels, crew environmental systems, and the nuclear reactor, are reduced by 89%.This causes the effect of making the vehicle extremely light and able tooutperform and outmaneuver any craft yet constructed – except, of course, thoseUFOs we did not build. The TR-3B is a high altitude, stealth, reconnaissanceplatform with an indefinite loiter time. Once you get it up there at speed, itdoesn’t take much propulsion to maintain altitude. [442][text00029.html#_edn442] Fouche claimed that the TR-3B was able to silently hover for at least 10 minutesand gave off “a corona of silver blue light” that glowed around it whilehovering. [443] [text00029.html#_edn443]Fouche described the locations where the operational 600 ft versions of theTR-3B were stored: The TR-3Bs were stored in a hanger built into aside of a mountain near DARC[Defense Advanced Research Center]. The Nellis Range covers more than 3.5million acres. One operational TR-3B is now stationed in Scotland, another inDiego Garcia, and the other TR-3B is at Papoose. To my knowledge, there are onlythree of the 600-feet operational models. I believe there were only 2 or 3200-foot prototypes built. [444] [text00029.html#_edn444] In a series of questions and answers, Fouche [EF] provided additional detailsabout the corporate contractors involved in building the TR-3B, numbers builtand when test flights began: 1. Who is the primary contractor for the TR-3B?[EF] Lockheed, Boeing, Northrup, Teledyne Ryan, managed by NRO, NSA and CIA.There were a number of major defense contractors involved to keep differentparts of the R&D compartmentalized2. What was the date of the first flight of the prototype for the TR-3B?[EF] They built a lot of DIFFERENT prototypes from the early 70’s on. I believethe first gravity warping vehicle, i.e., Triangle was flown in the early 70’s.3. How many different sizes of the TR-3B were built?[EF] Approx. 250 feet (prototype) and three were flying before 1994. Theoperational model was supposed to be 600 feet. Never saw a large productionmodel. Only saw them over Edwards AFB, AFFTC [Air Force Flight Test Center] andNevada. [445] [text00029.html#_edn445] As far as crew capacity is concerned, the 250 ft prototype could carry a crew offour, indicating that the larger 600 ft version could carry significantly more,and likely had a cargo storage area that could accommodate significant equipmentand supplies. Furthermore, Fouche identified Ben Rich of Lockheed’s “SkunkWorks” (pseudonym for “Advanced Development Programs”) as the senior projectdesigner in the development of the TR-3B. [446] [text00029.html#_edn446] Thissuggests that while Rich and Lockheed were developing the Alien ReproductionVehicle in the early 1970’s using the retrieved alien/Nazi flying saucer craft,this company was simultaneously developing a wholly U.S. designed antigravityvehicle: the TR-3B.Fouche’s reference to Scotland as one of the locations where an operationalTR-3B was based is significant given flying triangle sightings in both Scotlandand nearby Belgium from November 29, 1989, to April 1990. Hundreds of witnessesincluding police officers saw and photographed these large flying triangles. Thesightings were investigated by the Belgium Air Force which resulted in a verywell documented incident on March 30, 1990, involving F-16 fighters attemptingto intercept the mysterious triangular-shaped craft. [447][text00029.html#_edn447] Fouche said that based upon his examination of theBelgium photos of the flying triangle and the TR-3B design schematics he hadwitnessed, they were the one and same craft. [448] [text00029.html#_edn448]What is especially relevant is that the reported acceleration of the Belgiumflying triangle (TR-3B) was 46G according to F-16 fighter instruments. [449][text00029.html#_edn449] This is far above the 9G forces that most humans cantolerate for an extended period before blacking out. [450][text00029.html#_edn450] In the case of 16G, this acceleration becomes deadlywhen experienced for a minute or longer. [451] [text00029.html#_edn451] In shortduration G-force circumstances, such as when a fighter jet seat ejects, 32G isconsidered the safety limit . [452] [text00029.html#_edn452]The Belgium flying triangle/TR-3B sighting is powerful evidence that antigravitytechnology along the lines of Fouche’s ‘Magnetic Field Disruptor’ technology wasused to significantly reduce the weight and inertia of the craft and itsoccupants by a factor of 89%. This would explain how the occupants could surviveaccelerations generating G-forces as high as the 46G estimated by the BelgiumF-16’s instruments. Essentially, the 46G experienced in a conventionally poweredjet or rocket propelled vehicle would convert to approximately 5G being felt bythe occupants of a TR-3B when its MFD technology was activated.According to Fouche’s account, the TR-3B became operational in the early 1990’sand three were flying by 1994. This suggests that the 1989/1990 Belgiumsightings were the result of a TR-3B prototype test program or the largeroperational TR-3B was being flight tested before deployment. Corey Goode statedthat the TR-3B was a “hand me down” to the USAF’s military space program from aneven more highly classified space program controlled by the Antarctic Germansand US corporations: The TR-3B is considered extremely outdated technology and in many cases has beengifted as “hand me down” craft to “Elites” within the Secret Earth Governmentsand their Syndicates as something akin to “Company Jets”. [453][text00029.html#_edn453] Goode’s comments suggest that during the Apollo Program when U.S. and Germancorporations built a vast number of vehicles for the Antarctic space programthroughout the 1960’s and early 1970’s, the TR-3B was among the vehicles thatwere developed. This might explain how Lockheed was involved in the developmentof the TR-3B in the early 1970’s, but they were only released to the USAF in theearly 1990’s. Essentially, there was approximately a 20 year lag between thetime when US aerospace corporations had developed the TR-3B for the use by theAntarctic German space program and when they were allowed to be transferred tothe USAF.Goode also said the following about the flying triangle phenomenon: “There areso many newer technologies that are of the same general shape as the TR-3B (andmodels that came afterward) that it would blow people’s minds.” [454][text00029.html#_edn454] It is worth remembering this statement for chapternineteen when photographs of triangular-shaped craft flying over a major USAFbase are shown. The craft to be presented appear much smaller than either the600 ft TR-3B or its 250 ft prototype.Finally, it’s important to bear in mind that the period Fouche gave for theTR-3B becoming operational is well after Ronald Reagan’s 1985 presidential diaryentry about the U.S. having the capability of maintaining 300 astronauts inEarth orbit. This means that the space station(s) built by the USAF and NRO,under cover of the ‘unmanned’ MOL project, were initially serviced using TitanIIID rockets, Gemini B capsules atop Titan IIIC rockets, and the AlienReproduction Vehicles that were already operational."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 16 Stargate SG-1 and USAF Sanctioned Soft-Disclosure of Traversable Wormholes Wormholes were first introduced to the public over a century ago in a bookwritten by an Oxford mathematician. Perhaps realizing that adults might frown onthe idea of multiply connected spaces, he wrote the book under a pseudonym andwrote it for children. His name was Charles Dodgson, his pseudonym was LewisCarroll, and the book was Through the Looking Glass.– Professor Michio Kaku O n July 27, 1997, the television spin-off of the popular 1994 sci-fi movieStargate began to air which featured virtually instantaneous travel usingtraversable wormholes not only throughout the Milky Way Galaxy but also tonearby galaxies such as Pegasus a staggering three million light years away.What immediately distinguished Stargate SG-1 was the extraordinary level ofsupport it received from the US Air Force throughout the ten years it appearedon Showtime and the Sci-Fi Channel . The credits to the series openlyacknowledged the cooperation given by the USAF, US Space Command and theDepartment of Defense.The USAF granted the series producers access to its secretive undergroundCheyenne Mountain complex near Colorado Springs where stock film footage wastaken and used throughout the series. [455] [text00029.html#_edn455] At the timeof filming, the Cheyenne complex hosted elements from a number of sensitivemilitary commands, including Space Command. USAF jets which included F-15 andF-16’s were flown to Vancouver, Canada, for various episodes, and active AirForce personnel were used as extras in multiple episodes.What really stood out in the series were the cameo appearances made by twoserving Air Force Chiefs of Staff, illustrating the extraordinary level ofsupport the show was receiving from the top leadership ranks within theDepartment of the Air Force. General Michael E. Ryan appeared in the Season 4episode “Prodigy”, and General John P. Jumper appeared during Season 7 in “LostCity, Part 2”. The Air Force Office of Public Affairs read every Stargate SG1episode script and approved its airing after any “mistakes” were removed. Theseries producer, Richard Dean Anderson, was given special recognition for theshow’s positive depiction of the Air Force by the Air Force Association (AFA) atits 57 th annual dinner on September 14, 2004. If there was ever a televisionseries designed to show the virtues of a ‘USAF secret space program” with itsuse of exotic stargates to promote American values throughout the Milky Waygalaxy and beyond, Stargate SG-1 was that ideal depiction.https://i2.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Stargate-SG-1-Credits.jpg?ssl=1[Image00056.jpg]Figure 50. Credits showing USAF & US Space Command cooperation with StargateSG-1 production The appearances made by two serving Chiefs of Staff offered a very clear signthat the USAF was doing more than merely signaling its approval of a favorabledepiction of the USAF in a sci-fi show. These notable appearances were a sureway of signaling that Stargate SG-1 was a soft-disclosure initiative officiallysanctioned by the highest level within the Department to reveal some of itsclassified exotic technologies to the public to preempt any possible leaks, andin preparation for a future official disclosure event.The series featured repeated tongue-in-cheek references to its “StargateProgram” and lead mission team “SG-1” being a sanctioned form of soft-disclosurein several episodes using a show-within-a-show formula. For example, twoepisodes referred to a fictional sci-fi series within the actual series, called“Wormhole X-Treme”, which depicted a USAF run program using wormholes to travelthroughout the galaxy and the existence of alien ‘motherships’. In “WormholeX-Treme” (Season 5 Episode 12), which aired in September 2001 and commemoratedthe show’s 100 th episode, the characters playing USAF leaders in the actualStargate SG-1 series approved the fictional series going forward, despite itrevealing classified information. The goal was to insulate the truth about the“real” Stargate Program in the SG-1 series in case future unauthorized leaksoccurred. This episode presented an ironic, tongue-in-cheek reference to whatthe USAF was really doing through its Stargate SG-1 series, which was disclosingthe existence of an extensive galactic-wide system of traversable wormholes –but in a fictional sci-fi setting to insulate the real USAF Stargate Programfrom unauthorized leaks.Several whistleblowers have commented that the Stargate SG-1 series was indeedsoft-disclosure of a galactic-wide travel system using traversable wormholes.Among them is Corey Goode who, in a “Cosmic Disclosure” interview with New YorkTimes best-selling author David Wilcock that aired on September 15, 2015,included “traversable wormholes” or “portals” among the various kinds of exotictravel technologies used by ancient societies, extraterrestrial civilizationsand current day secret space programs. [456] [text00029.html#_edn456] Goodedescribed the difference between various “wormhole” or “portal” technologiesthat either occurred naturally or were built by a highly advanced ancientcivilization unknown even to the current extraterrestrial visitors of Earth. There are the natural portal systems that are a part of the known universe. Wecall it the Cosmic Web. And the ancient portal systems and the current eraportal systems use the, or exploit, these natural Cosmic Web portal system totravel from point to point.The ancient portal systems ... and there are several ancient portal systems thatare left behind by several ancient groups that have been found on Earth. Theyvary in their sophistication.Some of them do very short point-to-point jumps to reach ... Let's say you wantto reach a planet or solar system that is in ... They call them 'hops'.If there's like let's say 10 solar systems between where you want to go, thenyou may have to make three or four hops to get to that desired destination.[457] [text00029.html#_edn457]What Goode described is very similar to the scenario depicted in the StargateSG-1 series, where stargates were depicted as being built by a race of beingscalled “the Ancients”. There are significant differences, however. Goodedescribed travel to solar systems within our local stellar cluster as requiringa “series of hops”, rather than the “single journey” taken to travel virtuallyanywhere in our Galaxy as depicted in Stargate SG-1 .In his interview with Wilcock (DW), Goode (CG) referred to technologies depictedin Stargate SG-1 as similar in appearance to how ancient ring-shaped portals or“stargates” actually look:CG: The ancient systems . . . these are physical like ancient physical devices.And there's another ancient physical device just like in the show Stargate thatare spread out across many solar systems.DW: And when you say, “Just like Stargate ”, you mean it's shaped like a ring?CG: There have been some that look very similar – shaped like a ring …. [458][text00029.html#_edn458] Goode explained that another type of portal technology was associated with steppyramids found throughout Central America. Essentially, the four-sided geometryof these pyramids makes it possible for a portal to appear on the platform attheir apex which individuals can walk through similarly as with the ring-shapedportals.This is where the testimony of another secret space program insider, EmerySmith, becomes relevant. Smith claims he participated in several dozentraversable wormhole missions. He says that each mission required three to sixmonths of preparation by teams comprised of 6 or 7 highly trained personnel withmultiple specialties. These individuals trained simultaneously for multiplemissions and had an average of one mission per month. [459][text00029.html#_edn459] Like Goode, Smith also stated that there are bothnatural and artificial portals in existence. Smith described the portals heexperienced as looking very similar to the three sides of an upright door frame.In the Stargate SG-1 series, similar rectangle-shaped portals acted asthresholds bridging different dimensions.Goode has explained how the navigation system used in the Stargate SG-1 seriescan be likened to how the internet operates, where numerical sequences areassigned for individual computers, networks, ISPs, and countries. This is thebasis for the IP (Internet Protocol) numbers, which are the backbone fornavigating the ‘World Wide Web’. Goode claims that a series of numericalcoordinates based on hyper-dimensional mathematics designate different galaxies,solar systems, planets, etc., to become the address for a particular portal. Theseven-digit vector system used in the Stargate SG-1 series mirrors a highlyadvanced mathematical coordinate system based on sacred geometry used in thereal wormhole system that is part of the USAF secret space program.Goode is not alone in describing such a numerical address system being used tonavigate the many wormholes or portals. In the following exchange with Goode[CG] on a Cosmic Disclosure episode, David Wilcock [DW] mentioned anotherwhistleblower he had interviewed and vetted, referred to only as Daniel, whodescribed to Wilcock a similar system using coordinate points for portal andstargate travel:CG: … They've been buried here. Wars have been fought over them. Finding themand knowing how to use them is a totally different thing. They worked on a –just like in the TV show Stargate – they worked on an addressing system. It wasmuch like the Mac address or the IP address on computer systems.DW: That's exactly what my contact, Daniel, had said. In fact, he gave me thecomplete numerical address of the Earth as a ... There was a series of singledigits – three single digits – that could be anywhere between 1 and 9.Then there's a series of three digits that are between 1 and 99. And then thelast number can be between 1 and 999 depending on what you need it for… AndI've never leaked the whole sequence, but I have leaked that Earth's numberapparently was 606 and that Mars was 605. That's the last three digits of theaddress…Now, Daniel had told me that almost any number you dial in is going to take yousomewhere, because there's a great amount of ... Like all the addresses are usedand he had said that there's some kind of ancient race that comes along and putsone of these ancient gates on a planet and that the planet has one central gate.And that when you gate into that particular number address, it will route you tothat particular stargate on that planet. And it seems like these ... the beingsthat do this, will put a stargate on a planet once it starts to have intelligentlife so that they can eventually find it and be able to travel. Does that lineup with anything that you heard?CG: I heard that there were two gates and that, like I said, there were severaldifferent ages of these ancient gates going all the way back to the ancientbuilder race … And there were other gate systems that have been found on theEarth that have been much younger and look different, but pretty much werereverse engineered or use the same technology of addressing as the most ancientgate travel. “Daniel” is a pseudonym used by the whistleblower who disclosed information toWilcock, and Daniel has also presented more material in anonymous papersuploaded to the internet. [460] [text00029.html#_edn460]Among the first to publicly emerge claiming to have witnessed a traversablewormhole system is the whistleblower Dr. Daniel “Dan” Burisch, a microbiologistwho says he was employed at the S-4 facility at Area 51. While there isconsiderable controversy over Burisch’s claims since he went public in 2003,researchers have conducted extensive investigations into them. [461][text00029.html#_edn461] Among the investigators was William Hamilton, a formerUSAF security service NCO (1961-1965), who wrote a book about Burisch’sexperiences called Project Aquarius: The Story of an Aquarian Scientist .Hamilton’s research into the whistleblower’s background and claims brought himto the conclusion that Burisch was very credible. [462] [text00029.html#_edn462]Burisch claims that “artificial portals” are instruments that tap into naturalportals in order to operate. He believes there were approximately 50 artificialportals present on the planet coinciding with an undisclosed number of “naturalportals”. [463] [text00029.html#_edn463] He argued that information for thedevelopment of artificial portals came from “cylinder seals” extracted from Iraqduring both the first (1991) and second (2003) Gulf War military interventionsby the U.S. and its allies. The cylinder seals contained extraterrestrialinformation given to the ancient Sumerians who faithfully replicated thisinformation on cuneiform texts. Burisch stated that he was part of a covert teamthat went into Iraq to find its portal technologies and the cylinder sealsdiscussing the use of such technologies. [464] [text00029.html#_edn464]Corroboration for Burisch’s claims comes from another whistleblower, HenryDeacon (aka Arthur Neumann), who began publicly disclosing his informationregarding portals and stargates in a September 2006 interview. [465][text00029.html#_edn465] Deacon confirmed that a portal had been discovered inIraq and that Burisch was correct in his account of how portal technologiesoperated. [466] [text00029.html#_edn466] There is much circumstantial evidencesupporting Burisch and Deacon’s claims that the real reason behind the U.S. ledinvasion and takeover of Iraq was to find ancient portal technologies andinformation, as I also proposed and wrote about back in 2003. [467][text00029.html#_edn467]A key element of the cosmic portal grid is our Sun, which Corey Goode hasdescribed as a natural portal that is used by spacecraft to enter or exit oursolar system. [468] [text00029.html#_edn468] Elaborating further in an interviewwith David Wilcock, Goode explained that solar filaments form torsion fieldsthat create traversable wormholes for portal travel between suns in our galaxy: [CG] NASA recently released that our sun has basically a portal or a magneticfilament connection to every planet in our solar system, and anything that hasenough mass to cause a gravitational pull or a torsion in our space-time isgoing to create a magnetic and gravitational relationship with the host sun.And these filaments that they are just now releasing – these filaments are theportals … And they are strong electromagnetic filaments.DW: But if people don't include the torsion component, they're not going tounderstand how this works. (Right.) So it's an electromagnetic tube that alsohas a strong torsion field and would act like a traversable wormhole.CG: Right. And it's happening within the torsion field of each solar system. Thegalaxy is a giant torsion field. All of the stars are constantly moving aroundthe center of the galaxy and stars closer in are moving at a slightly differentspeed. And the magnetic relationships are always changing. These filamentrelationships are always changing between each star…It's just like electricity. Electricity takes the path of least resistance. Andif you want to travel to a star that's on the other side of the center of thegalaxy, you have to wait or calculate just the right time to travel, because ifyou don't, if you begin your travel and this star has just changed its positionand the electrical field, or the electrical connection, changes to another star– the path of least resistance – you're going to find yourself in a differentsolar system. [469] [text00029.html#_edn469] Goode, along with Smith, has asserted that the natural and ancient portalsystems form a “cosmic web” that spans the universe. By jumping from one portallocation to another, one can travel incredible distances between galaxies andacross the universe. Goode and Smith’s disclosure of a cosmic web of portals,which is backed by Daniel, Burisch and Deacon’s earlier claims, closelycorresponds to what was depicted in the Stargate SG-1 series.Goode says that traversable wormhole travel was first developed by theAntarctica-based Germans, who received assistance from Reptilianextraterrestrials in establishing bases on the Moon and Mars: DW: Okay. So did the Germans have a plan to try to use local materials to make asustainable base when they got there? Was that always the intention?CG: Yes. Just as on the Moon, they planned to take a certain amount of resourcesto Mars – lime and all the different things they need[ed] to mix with localresources to make concrete and whatever they needed to build structures thatthey could then pressurize and use as temporary shelters. They had to make quitea few trips to bring people and materials over in the beginning.This was in the beginning of when they were using stargate or portal travel….And in this early era, they were using the portals to transport materials andnot people or organics.DW: Did they have trouble with the organics having damage – like to their lifecycle?CG: Yes, as in killing them in a very gruesome way…. Until they figured out theproper way to do it with help from some of these allied extraterrestrial groups.DW: So what's the year that you know where portals started to be used totransport materials?CG: Materials have been … They've been using portals to transport materials …They've known how to do that since the '30s and the '40s.DW: Wow! So that's well before the Philadelphia Experiment.CG: Right. And you saw how badly that went with the people.DW: Absolutely.CG: It wasn't until the '50s that they were able to start transporting peopleconsistently without them suffering – I believe they called it temporaldementia. People that would teleport intact from here to Mars, but they wouldlook fine. But then after a number of days, they would suffer some sort ofdementia they would call temporal dementia.And the Germans did a lot of work in this field that helped us figure out how todo this properly – them working alongside their ET allies. [470][text00029.html#_edn470] Support for this early historical use of portal travel comes from Andrew J.Basiago, J.D., who says he was first exposed to it in 1968 as a 6-year old testsubject. Basiago’s participation began in a top secret project after thetechnology was first developed by the Ralph M. Parsons Engineering Company onbehalf of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (the forerunner to the DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA), and the CIA. [471][text00029.html#_edn471] The project was named “Pegasus” and involved manychildren participating in the assessment of its suitability. Later, from 1980 to1984, Basiago says portal technology was used to take him on trips to Mars,something that whistleblowers associated with the “Montauk Project” (involvingtime travel experiments) similarly have claimed. [472] [text00029.html#_edn472]Goode’s testimony, along with several other credible whistleblowers such asSmith, Burisch, Daniel, Deacon, and Basiago, all suggest that portal andwormhole travel has been secretly developed and used for decades by the USAF,DARPA and the CIA. Their collective testimonies raise the question: Is the ideaof traversable wormholes scientifically feasible or not?Carl Sagan and Scientific Validation for Traversable Wormholes via SingularityPointsA “natural stargate” is similar to an Einstein-Rosen bridge or “wormhole” whichhas been theorized to form when space-time is distorted by the intensegravitational fields generated by collapsing stars. Collapsing stars compress tothe extent that they form a point of singularity, wherein time slows down inproportion to proximity to the singularity when viewed by outside observers.Singularity points have been hypothesized to exist at the center of black holes,and it is possible that they exist in other locations where an intensegravitational field significantly distorts space-time. At a singularity point, time would effectively stop as it dilates down toinfinity, as predicted by Einstein's ‘General Theory of Relativity’. This wouldmake it possible for anyone surviving, even briefly, the intense gravitationalfields accompanying a singularity point to emerge at whatever future date theydesired. Physicists also consider it theoretically possible for anEinstein-Rosen bridge to form wherein one could travel backward in time. So asingularity point, at least in theory, offers a means to travel forward orbackward in time, and also through space. A singularity point, however, ishighly unstable and requires enormous quantities of energy to keep it open – fortravel through one to become viable.The first reference to a traversable wormhole in mainstream scientificliterature came through Carl Sagan, famed astronomer, cosmologist, andastrophysicist, who wrote the novel Contact , which became a famous moviedepicting the feasibility of traversable wormholes as a means of instantaneoustravel throughout our galaxy. Sagan asked leading astrophysicist Kip Thorne fromthe California Institute of Technology (Caltech) about the scientific validityof wormholes as a means of transportation, given what was known aboutsingularity points. In mid-1985, Sagan wrote: Sorry to bother you, Kip, but I’m just finishing a novel about the human race’sfirst contact with an extra-terrestrial civilization, and I’m worried. I wantthe science to be as accurate as possible, and I’m afraid I may have got some ofthe gravitational physics wrong. Would you look at it and give me advice?” [473][text00029.html#_edn473] Thorne began to think about how traversable wormhole travel would work, and thenresponded to Sagan’s request with the necessary scientific equations making itall feasible. In Contact , Sagan acknowledged Thorne’s contribution: “ProfessorThorne took the trouble to consider the galactic transportation system describedherein, generating fifty lines of equations in the relevant gravitationalphysics.” [474] [text00029.html#_edn474]Thorne told Sagan that as long as an exotic form of matter could be deployed tokeep the singularity point open, then a \"traversable wormhole\" was theoreticallypossible. Consequently, in theory at least, a singularity point that is keptopen offers a means for objects or life forms to move through time and space.Thorne’s work on traversable wormholes began with Sagan’s request. This led toThorne collaborating with a Ph.D. candidate at Caltech, Michael Morris (Thornewas Morris’ thesis advisor), in producing the first published scientific paperon wormholes titled: “Wormholes in spacetime and their use for interstellartravel”, which was published in the American Journal of Physics in 1988. [475][text00029.html#_edn475] Thorne went on to write about traversable wormholes inhis book, Black Holes and Time Warps (1995) and became the science consultantfor the movie, Interstellar (2014). [476] [text00029.html#_edn476] In the movieContact , a spherical-shaped stargate device was depicted, which was Thorne andSagan’s conception of the technological means for traversable wormhole travel.Sagan and Thorne’s correspondence stimulated other scientists to explore thefeasibility of traversable wormholes via singularity points generated by blackholes. Among them was Professor Paul Davies, a popular physicist, author, andprofessor at Arizona State University, who believed it would be possible tocreate a time machine if a singularity point could be found, and if technologywas developed to keep it open for the time traveler. Davies described a processwhereby advanced civilizations might control a traversable wormhole: \"wormholesmay have formed naturally in the big bang, so that an advanced space-faringcivilization might expect to discover one in the galaxy and commandeer it…\"[477] [text00029.html#_edn477]It’s well known that Sagan’s request to Thorne for advice sparked scientificspeculation about the viability of traversable wormhole travel. What’s not wellknown is that from 1976 until at least 1989, Sagan was a member of the “Majestic12” committee that had been set up as a policy making body running classifiedprograms involving extraterrestrial life and technologies. In 1976, Sagan hadreplaced the ailing Dr. Donald Menzel, who was identified in the EisenhowerBriefing Document as MJ-10, a member of the Majestic 12 Group. [478][text00029.html#_edn478] Veteran UFO researcher Stanton Friedman investigatedMenzel’s appearance on the list of MJ-12 members and found his inclusion verycredible based on Menzel’s security clearances and classified work with variousgovernment agencies. [479] [text00029.html#_edn479]In his capacity as “MJ-10”, Sagan was informed of the existence of traversablewormhole technology that was being utilized by extraterrestrials as a means ofbridging the vast distances between solar systems in our galaxy. Sagan’s bookand subsequent movie, Contact , can therefore be included among thesoft-disclosure initiatives backed by various government and military bodies.Thorne’s reply to Sagan on the feasibility of traversable wormholes focused onsingularity points connected with black holes. Remarkably, however, a differentway of understanding how a traversable wormhole would operate without the needfor black holes or singularity points appeared in a scientific paper authored byDr. Eric Davis that was published in 2010 by the Defense Intelligence Agency(DIA).Dr. Eric Davis and Traversable Wormholes via Exotic MatterOn December 17, 2017, SSP whistleblower Corey Goode uploaded two documents tohis website that dealt with advanced technologies such as traversable wormholesand warp drives, which had been given to him by a confidential source. [480][text00029.html#_edn480] The source believed that the documents corroboratedsome of Goode’s startling claims concerning advanced transportation programsused in secret space programs. The two documents were part of a collection of 38reports commissioned by the DIA and have since been validated as authentic. Thetwo documents are titled “Traversable Wormholes, Stargates, and Negative Energy”and “Warp Drive, Dark Energy, and the Manipulation of Extra Dimensions”. Thefirst was authored by Dr. Eric Davis, and the second co-authored by Dr. RichardObousy and Dr. Davis.Both documents stated that they were part of “a series of advanced technologyreports produced in Fiscal Year 2009 under the “Defense Advanced AerospaceWeapon System Applications (AAWSA) Program” and were marked “Unclassified // ForOfficial Use Only”.[Image00057.jpg]Figure 51. Intra-Universe Wormhole as a Hyperspace Shortcut through ConventionalSpace Veteran FOIA and UFO investigator John Greenewald confirmed that the twodocuments’ initial public release occurred through Goode. Greenewald wrote onJanuary 12, 2018: I saw these documents back in late December and early January, but dismissedthem as they are largely sourced/credited to Corey Goode, a very controversialfigure to begin with. If they are genuine (and they may be) these documents donot appear that they were released under any official channels. So the biggestquestion is, “How did Corey get them?” I have not found an ‘older’ source, butam open if anyone else has. Veteran investigator George Knapp, has been able tofind the names of all 38 DIA studies which are called “Defense IntelligenceReference Documents”, and where the above two documents first leaked by Goodecan be found. [481] [text00029.html#_edn481] On June 2, Australian UFO researcher Keith Basterfield similarly acknowledgedGoode’s role in the initial public release of the two documents through hiswebsite. [482] [text00029.html#_edn482] George Knapp discovered that the twodocuments released by Goode were part of a collection of 38 DIA studies, whichwere collectively titled “Defense Intelligence Reference Documents” (DIRDs).[483] [text00029.html#_edn483]When British UFO researcher Isaac Koi contacted Dr. Davis about the DIRDs, Davisexpressed his surprise that two of the documents he had authored had beenreleased to the public, thereby officially confirming their authenticity: “Idon’t know how you got two of my DIRD reports” – “Yes! All of my DIRD reportsare in the set of 38 total.” [484] [text00029.html#_edn484] Furthermore, in aJune 24 appearance on Coast to Coast radio, Davis said: … that 2 or 3 of these papers had been “leaked” onto the Internet, by “someoneon the beltway.” The beltway is a highway that encircles Washington. A referenceto “inside the beltway” means matters of importance to US government officials;lobbyists; and government contractors. [485] [text00029.html#_edn485] Davis, a leading world scientist, had effectively stated that “someone on thebeltway” was Goode’s source for the two documents. This is an astoundingadmission! For the first time since Goode’s public emergence in late 2014, anotable scientist went on the record confirming that Goode was working with aWashington insider to reveal significant details of advanced space technologiesbeing studied by the DIA. [486] [text00029.html#_edn486] More significantly, oneof the papers leaked by Goode presented startling corroboration for histestimony regarding traversable wormholes being used in different SSPs.In Davis’ report “Traversable Wormholes, Stargates, and Negative Energy”, thefeasibility of traversable wormhole travel was affirmed by laboratoryexperiments demonstrating that exotic matter, in the form of “negative energy”,could be created: Implementation of faster-than-light (FTL) interstellar travel via traversablewormholes generally requires the engineering of spacetime into very specializedlocal geometries. The analysis of these via Einstein’s General Theory ofRelativity, plus the resultant equations of state, demonstrates that suchgeometries require the use of “exotic” matter. It has been claimed that sincesuch matter violates the energy conditions, FTL spacetimes are not plausible.However, it has been shown that this is a spurious issue. The identification,magnitude, and production of exotic matter are seen to be a key technicalchallenge however. These issues are reviewed and summarized, and an assessmenton the present state of their resolution is provided. [487][text00029.html#_edn487] In his paper, Davis makes the critical point that a black hole’s singularitypoint is not required for the creation of a traversable wormhole, as originallyconceived by Thorne and relayed to Sagan. All that is required is sufficient“exotic matter” or “negative energy” for its creation anywhere, including on theEarth’s surface. This is something that would be impossible if a black hole wereto be used for wormhole travel. Stunningly, it makes traversable wormholetechnology something that could be developed as an alternative to conventionalspace travel.Davis describes the limitation of conventional propulsion systems that achieverelativistic speeds (near the speed of light) requiring years to travel tonearby star systems, as well as pointing out the significant time dilationeffect to be encountered where centuries or millennia would pass on Earth in themeantime. Instead, the use of traversable wormholes would make it virtuallyinstantaneous, allowing travel back and forth, as Davis explains: The solution to this problem is to dispense entirely with long interstellarvoyage times or the undesirable outcome of relativistic time dilation. Explorerscould deploy a wormhole-stargate near the Earth’ surface, in Earth’s orbit, oranywhere in the solar system they like and just pass through the “stargate” andcome out the other side in remote spacetime within seconds, moving through thethroat at low cruises speeds (30 mph!) and with no time dilation effects.Explorers could travel through the wormhole-stargates in small scout ships orsend probes unencumbered by either enormous propellants mass rations orextensive life support provision. Effective travel time through the CosmicNeighborhood via stargates would become irrelevant but could be estimated to bemany times or thousands of times the speed of light. [488][text00029.html#_edn488] Davis even suggests that a time travel element could be incorporated intowormhole travel allowing someone to arrive back slightly before their departure,which would be a very effective security provision to avoid unsuccessfulmissions: If explorers were to really push the envelope, they would design their stargateso they could return from their voyage in time to wave goodbye to themselves asthey see themselves depart on their journey. [489] [text00029.html#_edn489] Davis gave various design proposals for a stargate, one of which offered adistinct flat-face at the wormhole entrance similar to the ring-shaped versionGoode described, which also appeared in the Stargate SG-1 series: It is a straightforward exercise to design a real “stargate” from wormholephysics. A stargate is essentially a traversable wormhole with a flat-face shapefor the throat as opposed to the spherical-shaped throat of the Morris andThorne wormhole… [490] [text00029.html#_edn490] Davis went on to contrast the differences between the spherical-shaped wormholeentrance, or stargate, conceived by Thorne with that of a flat-facedhypersurface design. Their contrast is notable when peering through them intoother space-times or dimensions: The entrance to the spherically symmetric Morris & Thorne wormhole looks like asphere that contains the mirror image of a whole other universe or remote regionwithin our own universe, incredibly shrunken and distorted … A flat-facedwormhole, or stargate, which is also a hypersurface, would not distort themirror image of the remote space region or other universe seen through itbecause the negative surface energy density and negative surface tensions of theexotic matter threading its throat is zero as seen and felt by light and matterpassing through it. [491] [text00029.html#_edn491] Davis provided an illustration in his paper of a ring-shaped stargate with aflat-faced entrance depicted in New York City’s Times Square, with thedestination site on another planet seen through the hypersurface. In addition tothe stargate being a transportation device, it could also act as a“chronovisor”, or “looking glass”, where one could see into the past, future, oralternate realities. [492] [text00029.html#_edn492] This would make stargatetechnology and its derivatives a powerful intelligence-gathering tool as claimedby different whistleblowers and witnesses. [493] [text00029.html#_edn493] [Image00058.jpg]Figure 52. Artistic illustration of a Stargate in NYC displaying a destinationworld The conclusion to be drawn from Davis’ leaked report is that traversablewormholes, or stargates, are a form of space-time travel technology that isscientifically feasible, without requiring either singularity points orblackholes. Ostensibly, the advanced technologies required for generating exoticmatter are not yet known or made available to the general public, yetwhistleblower testimonies have revealed that exotic matter technology has indeedbeen developed in classified programs! The scientific validity of wormholes hasbeen evaluated by multiple mainstream scientists who have proposed variousdesigns for building stargates. The similarity between Davis’ ring-shapedstargate design incorporating a flat hypersurface and the one depicted in theStargate SG-1 series is noteworthy. When combined with the USAF’s sponsorshipand active participation in the series, along with several insider testimonies,the conclusion that emerges is that Stargate SG-1 was a form of soft-disclosureof one of the transportation modalities used by the USAF secret space program."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 17 The Shock of the Navy’s Parallel Secret Space Program They told us we were the tip of the spear, but we found out we’re just thef---ing Coast Guard!–Senior Air Force SSP officer “Sigmund”, according to Corey GoodeA s NASA’s Apollo missions successfully placed men on the Moon, followed bySkylab and other civilian space missions, the US Air Force was secretlydeveloping a parallel military space program. By the mid-1980’s, the USAF hadassembled several manned space stations using Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL)modules covertly sent into space with Titan III rockets, which were serviced bysquadrons of antigravity craft delivering astronauts and supplies. All of thiswas accomplished while most of NASA’s scientists, members of Congress and thegeneral public remained completely unaware of what the USAF was secretlyachieving in space. In turn, USAF leaders running their growing arsenal ofsecret space assets were confident that they had the most advanced space programon the planet – aside from the German program established in Antarctica. USAFleaders were convinced that the technological gap with the Antarctic Germanswould eventually be closed due to the vastly superior industrial infrastructurepossessed by the United States, and with the help they were receiving fromdifferent extraterrestrial groups.That confidence was severely shaken in late 2015 when USAF leaders began toseriously consider whistleblower claims that the US Navy had also secretlydeveloped a parallel space program, reportedly with massive kilometers-long“space carriers” accompanied by naval battle groups capable of deep spaceoperations. Such claims of a highly advanced Navy program had been dismissed asdisinformation, or misidentification of Antarctic German or extraterrestrialspacecraft. Witnesses such as Michael Relfe (2001) and Randy Cramer (2014), whoclaimed they had been involved in a Navy-run space program were simply ignored.[494] [text00029.html#_edn494] That dramatically changed after both Corey Goodeand William Tompkins’ emerged publicly in 2015.Goode’s first audio interviews appeared in late 2014 on the Project Avalonwebsite. I conducted a series of email interviews with him next which werepublished in April 2015. [495] [text00029.html#_edn495] However, it was Goode’sappearance on Gaia TV’s new series, Cosmic Disclosure, which began on July 21,2015, that attracted large audiences who were electrified by his startling newinformation about multiple secret space programs and various extraterrestrialalliances. Tompkins public emergence began with the publication of his book,Selected by Extraterrestrials , in December 2015. [496] [text00029.html#_edn496]Tompkins presented many documents substantiating his remarkable claims of a Navysecret space program (SSP), which corroborated much of Goode’s earlierinformation. When Tompkins read volume one of my own “Secret Space Programseries” which outlined Goode’s claims, he was shocked since he thought he wasthe first to come forward with information on what the Navy had secretly built.[497] [text00029.html#_edn497] In turn, when Goode learned about Tompkins’testimony, he realized that much of the information he had read on SSP smartglass pads from 1987 to 2007 was based on Tompkins’ briefing packets createdbetween 1942 to 1946.As Goode and Tompkins’ remarkable claims steadily reached larger audiences,their testimonies came to the attention of leaders within the highly classifiedAir Force SSP, which closely cooperated with other US military entities such asthe National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the National Security Agency (NSA),and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Goode calls this interagencycollaboration the “Military-Industrial Complex Secret Space Program” (MIC SSP),but I will continue to refer to it simply as the USAF SSP since much of itsmilitary infrastructure and leadership originate from the Air Force.Goode’s information, in particular, drew close scrutiny when he began talkingabout USAF space assets in sufficient detail to warrant an investigation to findout who was responsible for this potential security breach. Goode says that hefirst encountered a senior official from the USAF SSP, whom he dubbed “Sigmund”,during a series of military abductions. These began in January 2016 when atriangular-shaped antigravity spacecraft landed near his Texas home, and two AirForce personnel from the vehicle forcibly took him into the craft. [498][text00029.html#_edn498] Goode was medically interrogated during his abduction,a procedure in which chemicals were injected into him to force him to reveal thesource(s) of his information. Eventually, “Sigmund” revealed himself as theofficer in charge of the multiple interrogations Goode was being subjected to.During the initial 2016 abductions, Goode described how Sigmund and hissubordinates chemically forced him to expose several operatives working for the“SSP Alliance”, a group comprising elements from the Navy’s Solar Warden programand defectors from rival space programs: A tablet with a camera was held in front of my face and academy type militaryphotos were shown to me. The camera monitored my eyes and marked a photographwhen it was detected that I recognized the person. This incident caused theouting of 3 high ranking SSP Alliance individuals and caused a further riftbetween myself, Gonzales and the SSP Alliance. Because of the chemicalinterrogation and the attempted blank slating of my memories of the incidents, Ididn’t remember the full details until I was informed later of the securitybreach. [499] [text00029.html#_edn499] A person standing in a room Description automatically generated [Image00059.jpg]Figure 53. Courtesy: Cosmic Disclosure/Gaia TV The nature of Sigmund’s interrogations of Goode began to significantly changewhen Sigmund determined that Goode’s information was accurate, at least in part,and that he was not a part of a disinformation program belonging to some rogueelement secretively working within the USAF SSP. In a December 11, 2016 updateon his website, Goode described how laboratory tests conducted by USAFscientists had repeatedly confirmed some of his claims of being taken off-planetby the SSP Alliance and the highly advanced extraterrestrial group Goode wasworking with, known as the “Sphere Being Alliance”:The lab results once again confirmed that I had been in the approximateoff-planet locations I had claimed. The MIC [USAF] space program people do nothave any intelligence suggesting I had ever actually visited these locations. Iwas never a part of their program.This led to Sigmund concluding that he was being deliberately misled by hissuperiors about the existence of more advanced programs to his own. My testsproved, beyond any shadow of doubt, that there was much more to the secret spaceprogram than he knew. As a high-ranking superior officer, this naturally came asquite a shock to him. He was led to believe that he had access to all relevantcompartments of the UFO cover-up. [500] [text00029.html#_edn500]Subsequently, Sigmund began an “information exchange” with Goode. “Meetings”began to occur during the latter part of 2016, and Sigmund learned about the‘alleged’ Navy SSP and corroborated rumors of it cooperating with Nordic andother human-looking extraterrestrial groups. [501] [text00029.html#_edn501] Inturn, Goode was given information about Antarctica and the intense powerstruggle within the US national security system involving the 2016 Presidentialelection. Goode wrote a report about one of these information exchanges that waspublished on December 11, 2016. [502] [text00029.html#_edn502]On March 16, 2017, Goode gave me a detailed briefing about his ongoing meetingswith Sigmund. These meetings sometimes included two of Sigmund’s subordinatesfrom the USAF SSP and were occurring regularly at the time. [503][text00029.html#_edn503] The scope of the information revealed by Goode wasbreathtaking in its national security implications for the U.S. and the rest ofthe planet. The overall context driving these “information exchanges”, accordingto Goode, was Sigmund’s anger over the fact that his USAF SSP had been kept outof the loop concerning activities in deep space involving extraterrestrial lifeand technologies. The possible existence of a more powerful Navy programoperating in deep space, with technologies far more advanced than anythingpossessed by the USAF SSP, was of particular concern to Sigmund and hiscolleagues.Sigmund’s USAF SSP was largely confined to near-Earth orbital operations –utilizing at least two operational space stations capable of hosting severalhundred personnel, and several squadrons of TR-3Bs and reverse engineered flyingsaucers (aka Alien Reproduction Vehicles “ARVs”) that serviced the stations andwere capable of deep space operations. Goode also claims that the USAF SSPmaintained small bases on the Moon and Mars. However, these bases were secondaryin relation to the USAF SSP’s primary mission of near-Earth surveillance andoperations. Goode further describes how USAF space operations involving itsTR-3Bs and ARVs had strictly been limited to our solar system:They have black triangular craft that can travel around our solar system, aswell as other stealth-looking varieties. This technology makes them feel that ifanything else was going on in our solar system, they would be able to see it.When they see the crafts from other programs, or any of a number of ET races,they are simply told that these are ours. They are told that they are not on aneed-to-know basis about that particular program and not to speak about theirsighting with anyone….The MIC [USAF] SSP are told that we cannot travel outside our solar system… Thisis due to gravitational and energetic conditions at the boundary of ourheliosphere that [makes] any escape impossible with their current technology.[504] [text00029.html#_edn504]Goode’s testimony has revealed how USAF officials were duped about the AntarcticGerman, Navy, and corporate-run secret space programs, even when these otherprograms’ assets were encountered or monitored on USAF surveillance devices.Having been told that such craft were part of a highly classified programrequiring need-to-know access proved a very effective means for silencing USAFwitnesses and leaders. The assumption was that once the different corporationscompleted such classified projects, the USAF would then receive these aerospacetechnologies for eventual deployment. According to Goode, this was not going tohappen for decades, not until the technologies had become redundant as in thecase of the TR-3B. Sigmund and his peers were infuriated when they learned whatwas happening.Goode says that Sigmund and USAF SSP personnel were all told that they were “thetip of the spear” when it came to the deployment of advanced militarytechnologies in space, but now they had learned that they were just the “f---ingCoast Guard!” Sigmund’s fury over the lies told to him and other USAF SSPpersonnel led to angry confrontations with his superiors. This resulted inSigmund initiating a serious investigation into Goode’s claims, along with thoseprovided by Tompkins through publicly released interviews and his book Selectedby Extraterrestrials , which specifically detailed the US Navy’s SSP and itscooperation with Nordic extraterrestrials. [505] [text00029.html#_edn505]According to Goode, Sigmund began conducting a similar type of investigation tothe one I had already completed for my March 2017 book, The US Navy’s SecretSpace Program and Nordic Extraterrestrial Alliance . Sigmund’s investigationinvolved historical document searches, along with the interviewing of Navypersonnel that had potential knowledge of a Navy space program that had beencovertly constructed simultaneously with the creation of the USAF SSP. Aftereliminating a number of possible sources for Goode’s impressive body ofinformation, Sigmund concluded that there were two remaining explanations forGoode’s revelations. The first was that a visiting group of “Nordicextraterrestrials”, known to the USAF SSP, were manipulating Goode through mindcontrol and feeding him accurate information for an unknown agenda. The secondexplanation meant that Goode was genuinely associated with a Navy-run secretspace program, which in turn was part of a “Secret Space Program Alliance”; andGoode worked with a highly advanced visiting group of extraterrestrials calledthe “Sphere Being Alliance”. [506] [text00029.html#_edn506]Sigmund began his information exchanges with Goode, in part, to furtherinvestigate Goode’s claims, thus helping him to determine which of the twoexplanations was accurate. Sigmund was also concerned that USAF plans for a“limited disclosure” of its SSP would only reveal part of the truth about deepspace activities involving lesser classified compartments within the USmilitary. He felt that the truth needed to be determined and exposed in order tomaintain morale in each military branches’ SSP. Was the USAF SSP the “tip of thespear” as they had been told, or “the f---ing Coast Guard” as Sigmund nowfeared?Support for Tom DeLonge’s “Sekret Machines Initiative” PulledThe highly-charged discovery made by Sigmund and his peers that they might wellhave been misled about the existence of a more advanced Navy SSP, along withGerman and corporate-run SSPs, would later play a role in the USAF’s decision tocontinue or withdraw its covert support of Tom DeLonge’s multimedia “ SekretMachines disclosure initiative”. This initiative began in 2015, around the sametime that Goode appeared in the public arena. DeLonge, a former lead vocalistfor the rock band ‘Blink 182’, had enlisted top writers such as A.J. Hartley andPeter Levenda to co-author up to six books for his project. In interviews,DeLonge described how ten senior military and corporate officials backed hisinitiative. [507] [text00029.html#_edn507] By early 2016, as Goode’s abductionsby Sigmund and his team began, the first book in DeLonge’s “Sekret Machinesinitiative” was published detailing the help his advisory team had given him. I’ve had meetings in mysterious rooms far out in the desert. I’ve had meetingsat the highest levels of NASA. I have had conversations at research centers,think tanks, and even on the phone connected to secret facilities. I’ve beenintroduced to a man whom I call “the Scientist,” and another whom I call “theGeneral.” And there are many more of whom I cannot say much about, but some havebecome true friends, and all have become close counselors. Each of these men hasall held, or currently holds, the highest offices of the military and scientificelite. The point is, I have done it. I have assembled a team of men and women“in the know.” And they all believe I am doing something of value, somethingworth their time and yours. [508] [text00029.html#_edn508] On the back cover of Sekret Machines , an endorsement appeared, presumably fromone of the ten officials, Maj. General Michael Carey (USAF ret.), whose lastmilitary assignment was special assistant to the commander of Air Force SpaceCommand:Sekret Machines scratches at the surface of “who do” we trust with ourclassified technology – certainly our adversaries are aware of our undertakings,as they are doing the same, but what of our citizens, our politicians, even ourown military. Tom DeLonge and A.J. Hartley create a convincing narrativedescribing the “cat and mouse” game that is timeless between strategicadversaries. It has existed under the sea, on the surface of the earth and inits skies, why wouldn’t we believe it occurs in space? Our military leaders havebeen saying space is a contested environment for years now, perhaps we shouldbelieve them! – Maj. Gen. Michael J. Carey. [509] [text00029.html#_edn509]General Carey’s support for DeLonge’s initiative is particularly significantbecause his work as special assistant to Air Force Space Command would have madehim very knowledgeable of their secret space program. Carey was not the onlyUSAF general supporting DeLonge’s “Sekret Machine’s initiative”.In late 2016, Wikileaks released emails that confirmed DeLonge’s claims andouted two of the ten officials involved in his initiative. [510][text00029.html#_edn510] One of the hacked emails was addressed to John Podesta,chairman of the Hillary Clinton Presidential Campaign, and dated January 25,2016, with the subject header “General McCasland”. In it, DeLonge stated:He mentioned he’s a “skeptic”, he’s not. I’ve been working with him for fourmonths. I just got done giving him a four hour presentation on the entireproject a few weeks ago. Trust me, the advice is already been happening on howto do all this. He just has to say that out loud, but he is very, very aware –as he was in charge of all of the stuff. When Roswell crashed, they shipped itto the laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. General McCasland was incharge of that exact laboratory up to a couple years ago. He not only knows whatI’m trying to achieve, he helped assemble my advisory team. He’s a veryimportant man.Best, Tom DeLonge [511] [text00029.html#_edn511] Here is a brief biography of McCasland prior to his retirement: Maj. Gen. William N. McCasland is the Commander, Air Force Research Laboratory,Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. He is responsible for managing the AirForce’s $2.2 billion science and technology program as well as additionalcustomer funded research and development of $2.2 billion. He is also responsiblefor a global workforce of approximately 10,800 people in the laboratory’scomponent technology directorates, 711th Human Performance Wing and the AirForce Office of Scientific Research. [512] [text00029.html#_edn512] McCasland’s assignment at Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFBholds particular significance given what was presented in earlier chapters aboutthe historical role of this major USAF research facility in studying capturedGerman and extraterrestrial flying saucers. McCasland’s assignment clearlyestablishes that he had the necessary scientific and technical background to bevery familiar with the topic of ‘advanced aerospace technologies’ related tosecret space programs and the UFO phenomenon. Because of the leaked emails, itwas now confirmed that two senior USAF officers were supporting DeLonge’sinitiative.DeLonge and his advisory group believed that their disclosure of an AirForce-run space program comprised of antigravity TR-3B vehicles and reverseengineered flying saucers would usher in a new age of space exploration. TR-3Bsquadrons operated out of Area 51, classified spaceports on the island of DiegoGarcia, and a secret location in Antarctica which according to Sigmund was alsoa major R&D facility. Initially, there was widespread support among USAF leadersfor DeLonge’s effort. However, that was no longer the case by early 2017,according to Goode. After Sigmund and his team had thoroughly investigatedGoode’s claims, he and other USAF officials had re-assessed and now believedthat DeLonge’s efforts would indefinitely perpetuate an information gap betweenthe Air Force SSP and the Navy’s Solar Warden program, and in turn, the SSPAlliance.Notably, DeLonge’s initiative has changed quite rapidly from its initial focusupon disclosing the truth about what the Air Force and corporations had secretlydesigned, built and deployed – to concentrating on designing its own proto-typespacecraft through DeLonge’s start-up organization, “To The Stars Academy ofArts & Science”. [513] [text00029.html#_edn513] Today, there is controversy anda growing perception that DeLonge’s initiative has been co-opted by the DeepState (aka “the Cabal”) and is planning to disclose very little about what hassecretly been developed in corporate laboratories. Instead, “To The StarsAcademy” is pushing to merely reinvent the wheel with civilian funded projectsto design and build a new generation of antigravity craft, which predictablywould be far less advanced than anything built in the past by Lockheed, Boeing,and other aerospace corporations. Goode claims that Sigmund told him at ameeting in January 2018 that DeLonge’s initiative had been “compromised beyondany type of repair”. [514] [text00029.html#_edn514] Consequently, the oncestrong Air Force support for DeLonge’s disclosure initiative had evaporated,with DeLonge and other figures having to increasingly deal with accusations ofthem promoting disinformation and a “Deep State” agenda. [515][text00029.html#_edn515] Importantly, Air Force leaders wanted to get to thebottom of claims of Navy, German, and corporate-run SSPs before moving forwardwith officially disclosing their own SSP as the only secret space program knownto exist.USAF SSP Takes Steps Toward Full DisclosureGoode has claimed that Sigmund organized many meetings for him to providebriefings for select VIPs from the aerospace community in early 2017. Sigmund’sstaff arranged Goode’s travel when necessary and provided the security for thesemeetings. Leading engineers, scientists, industrialists, and others allegedlylistened to Goode’s information about the Navy’s Solar Warden program to see ifany of it seemed possible to them and if they could confirm key elements. Goodesaid that in the end, he gave a series of briefings to a total of 28 VIPs atsimilar confidential meetings consisting of one to eight participants.One specific meeting involved three notable people who were attending the “HumanSpaceflight and Exploration Forum” organized by a small aerospace company,Special Aerospace Services. [516] [text00029.html#_edn516] This forum took placeat a hotel where Goode was staying in late January 2017. Goode said that duringhis briefing presentation to the three VIPs, one of them got up and left indisbelief over the idea of a secret space program such as Solar Warden existing.The remaining two VIPs stayed until the end of the briefing but maintainedbemused expressions which Goode interpreted to mean they didn’t believe a wordof what he was saying. Goode reported that in all the briefings he gave, one ormore of the participants similarly walked out in disbelief, while the remainingVIPs largely maintained quizzical expressions. Consequently, Sigmund ended theVIP briefing sessions since they had not produced the desired effect ofinforming the VIPs about a possible Navy SSP, nor had they uncovered any furtherinformation that could help Sigmund in his investigation.During a conversation I had with Goode on March 16, 2017, I pointed out to himthe irony of his situation. Something very similar had happened to WilliamTompkins during World War II when he was tasked to deliver highly sensitivematerial in the form of briefing packets which contained information about aNazi flying saucer program that used antigravity technologies and that exposedhow the Nazi program was aided by a Reptilian extraterrestrial race. [517][text00029.html#_edn517] Tompkins said that on many occasions when he deliveredthose briefing packets from Naval Air Station San Diego to the differentaircraft companies’ experimental test facilities, think tanks, and universitydepartments, the lead scientists and engineers would dismiss the information asimpossible. According to Tompkins, he had to constantly battle the closed-mindedskepticism of those who had been trained to accept conventional scientific lawsas immutable.Soon after the VIP briefing sessions came to an end, Sigmund disappearedaccording to Goode. Sigmund had to go on the run from the Cabal/Deep Statebecause he had finally succeeded in confirming Goode’s claims of a far moretechnologically advanced Navy-run SSP. Eventually, Sigmund began working withthe SSP Alliance after members of it rescued him from pursuing agents of theCabal/Deep State. The events surrounding Sigmund’s alleged investigation anddisappearance illustrate how the Cabal/Deep State had expertly manipulatedsenior Air Force officials to keep them in the dark over the extent to whichextraterrestrial technologies had been reverse engineered.Put simply, the USAF had been tricked into believing its SSP was using the mostadvanced aerospace technologies available, which was believed to be a directresult of its decades-long cooperation with the Antarctic Germans, Grays, andReptilian extraterrestrials. When Sigmund and other USAF officials learned thetruth about the far superior Navy SSP, they realized that a major strategicrealignment was necessary to rectify and redeem their state of affairs. In amomentous turnabout, the USAF began cooperating with Nordic extraterrestrialswho had given such impressive technological assistance to the Navy’s SSP. It isnot coincidental that soon after Air Force officials confirmed the existence ofthe Navy’s SSP, a Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) document was leaked to thepublic. The release of this particular document provided startling evidence thatthe USAF and its NRO, DIA, and NSA partners had made a major strategicrealignment, and were now depicting Nordic extraterrestrials as reliable alliesand future friends of humanity."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 18The History of Human-Looking Extraterrestrials on EarthDo not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some haveentertained angels without knowing it.–Hebrews 13:2I n the December 2018 edition of the MUFON Journal , the first detailed analysisof a leaked 47-page Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) document was published.For everyone debating over the validity of the document, the analysis presenteda startling conclusion – the DIA document was authentic .

The US Air Force, in particular, benefited from this situationsince extraterrestrials “living among us” offered an opportunity for the USAF togain help in understanding the principles and technologies necessary for futurespace travel.The author of the MUFON Journal article, Dr. Robert Wood, is the world’sforemost authenticator when it comes to the controversial Majestic Documents.[520] [text00029.html#_edn520] These are leaked documents concerning theactivities of Operation Majestic 12 which was formally set up on September 24,1947, by an Executive Order issued by President Harry Truman to manage theUFO/extraterrestrial issue. [521] [text00029.html#_edn521] Dr. Wood, a formeraerospace engineer with McDonnell Douglas whose career spanned 43-years, beganhis investigation and authentication of the Majestic Documents in 1995 with hisson, Ryan, a fellow authenticator and respected author of Majic Eyes Only .Before discussing Dr. Wood and Ryan Wood’s authentication of the DIA document,it is worth briefly reviewing its contents.Majestic Document Reveals US Diplomatic Relations with Human-LookingExtraterrestrialsAccording to its cover page, the leaked document is a “preliminary briefing”created by the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Office of Counterintelligence onJanuary 8, 1989. The full title of the briefing package is “Assessment of theSituation/Statement of Position on Unidentified Flying Objects” , and it isaddressed to the Office of the President. The controlling office in charge ofpreparing the briefing is designated as “Operation Majestic/MJ-1″ which is areference to the principal officer in charge of Operation Majestic 12.https://i0.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MJ-Briefing-1989-p.2.jpg?resize=587%2C551&ssl=1[Image00060.jpg]Figure 54. Cover page of leaked “Assessment of the Situation/Statement ofPosition on Unidentified Flying Objects” document Another page of the leaked DIA document identifies MJ-1 as the officerpersonally in charge of the preliminary briefing. Based on historical precedent,MJ-1 denotes the sitting CIA Director. [522] [text00029.html#_edn522] At thetime, this was William Hedgcock Webster who is the only person to have held thepositions of both Director of the FBI (1978 – 1987) and Director of the CIA(1987-1991). He currently is the Chair of the Homeland Security Advisory Councilwhose primary function is “to provide the Secretary (of Homeland Security)real-time, real-world, sensing and independent advice to support decision-makingacross the spectrum of homeland security operations.” [523][text00029.html#_edn523]https://i2.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MJ-Briefing-1989-prelim-briefing-only.jpg?resize=650%2C261&ssl=1[Image00061.jpg]Figure 55. Page from DIA document identifies MJ-1 as officer in chargeThe briefing document refers to four groups of extraterrestrial visitors whichare listed in order of importance to our planet, and cites whether they arefriendly or not: There are four basic types of EBEs so-far confirmed. And they are listed here indescending order of their influences on our planet.A. Earth-like humanoids . There are several variations more-or-less likeourselves. The majority of these are friendly and are the bulk of our EBEcontacts. Most have a high degree of psychic ability and all use science andengineering of an advanced nature.B. Small humanoids or “Grays” . The Grays, so–called for the hue of theirskin possessed by most of this type, are a sort of drone. They are not unlikethe worker ants or bees…. They are mostly under the psychic control of theEarth-like humanoids who raise them like pets (or a kind of slave). Assuming theGreys are under benign control, they are harmless.C. Non-humanoid EBEs . These are in several classes and come from worldswhere dominant morphology took a different evolutionary course. Many of theseare dangerous not for organized hostile intentions, but because such creaturesdo not hold human life as sacred…. Thus far, contact has been minimal with onlya handful of unfortunate encounters.D. Transmorphic Entities . Of all the forms of EBE studied so far byOperation Majestic, these are the most difficult to understand or even to givea description of. Essentially, such entities are not “beings” or “creatures” …exist in some either dimension or plane which is to say not in our space ortime. They do not use devices or travel in space…. In essence these entities arecomposed of pure mind energies. … They are said (by other EBEs) to be capable oftaking on any physical form that they “channel” their energy … as matter. [524][text00029.html#_edn524] The assessment depicts most extraterrestrial interactions as friendly,particularly those involving the human-looking entities. This group has engagedin a number of non-hostile interactions with humanity that date back to NikolaTesla’s pioneering radio and energy broadcasts in the late 1800’s.The briefing document continues: In 1899, the Yugoslavic electrical scientist, Nikola Tesla, most noted for hisintroduction of alternating current to electrical power transmission and alaboratory device named after him (the Tesla coil) embarked on a number ofresearches that have made this the saucer century. Tesla had long proposed thatit was possible to directly broadcast pure electrical energies at a distancewithout loss of power and without wires. By 1899, and with … government andprivate scientific backing, Tesla had chosen a site near Colorado Springs,Colorado to conduct a massive and never repeated experiment…. Tesla’s purpose togather the Earth’s own magnetic field and to use the Earth as a huge transmitterto send signals to outer space in an attempt to contact whoever might be livingthere. Tesla had no idea that the specific type of power he had generated wascoursing through space and caused great havoc many light years away. [525][text00029.html#_edn525] Without realizing it, Tesla’s use of the Earth’s magnetic field to direct radiotransmissions into space had created a disruptive weapon – essentially theworld’s first “Directed Energy Weapon”, but at a planetary scale! The effect ofdoing this was analogous to the development of warp drive in the fictional StarTrek series, and humanity was now on the Galactic radar for the first time.The briefing document describes what happened as a result of Tesla’sexperiments: The extraterrestrial intelligence (EI’s) attempted to respond to histransmissions in a form of binary code that they routinely use for long rangecommunications (evidently these energies act instantly at a distance and are notlimited to the speed of light) and asked that he cease sending. Of course, Teslahad no way of understanding the message he received back from space.Fortunately, the anger of local residents at the side-effects of his researchforced him to shut down the Colorado Springs experiments in the same year hebegan them. [526] [text00029.html#_edn526] Significantly, the briefing document is acknowledging that the communicationswere instantaneous and that the speed of light is not an absolute limit, atleast for the kind of communications used by the aliens.Critically, it was Tesla’s experiments, according to the briefing document,which ushered in the “flying saucer age” due to the powerful effect of hisenergy transmissions which had used the Earth’s magnetic field as a booster: This, then, was the actual start of the so-called “flying saucer age” in ourtimes. As it became clear that our people were on the verge of an explosion oftechnical progress, the EI’s decided on a long term program of carefullycalculated and seemingly random contact with the eventual goal of raising ourawareness of our place in the galactic community. With the advent of the AtomicAge, this program was escalated to include eventual diplomatic contact with manyof Earth’s governments. The same approach of staging apparent “accidental”contact was chosen for its low psychological impact on the human race. This wasthe situation in the case of the United States of America (re: Roswell andAztec, New Mexico files, this briefing). [527] [text00029.html#_edn527] The briefing document refers to the famed 1947 Roswell UFO crash and thenational security mechanism that had been developed to investigate it, whichsubsequently cultivated a secrecy system. While the Roswell crash is well known,the next case described in the document is not.There was a “controlled landing” of a flying saucer on March 25, 1948, in Aztec,New Mexico, which the briefing document describes: The controlled landing occurred in a small desert canyon on the private grazingland of a local farmer and rancher… about 12.2 miles northeast of Aztec NewMexico. The ship was determined to be 99.983 feet in diameter. Inside the uppercabin... the team found the bodies of two (2) small humanoids about four feet inheight strapped into seats like those in a jet cockpit… The extraterrestrialswere dead. [528] [text00029.html#_edn528] The briefing document reports that the extraterrestrials had died because of anatmospheric leak caused by impact with a nearby cliff face. The report thendescribes the discovery of cryogenic tubes with human-looking bodies in thelower level, four of which were successfully resuscitated: A closer look at the sealed tubes which looked like the doors of clothes dryersat a laundromat revealed that they were a complex form of refrigeration system.Two were empty and twelve contained the bodies of what looked like human adultsand small children as well as infants, all frozen as if preserved forspecimens…. Eventually the medical team was able to resuscitate one adultEarth-like humanoid male and three (3) Earth-like humanoid infants, all aboutsix (6) months of age: two male and one female. The rest of the infants and onemore short, gray-skinned, large-headed EBE, perished. [529][text00029.html#_edn529] The adult survivor, according to the briefing document, looked human but wasclearly an extraterrestrial who, despite appearances, had physiologicaldifferences which included having two livers. The document describes howdiplomatic negotiations began with the surviving adult extraterrestrial: After a hasty tele-conference with President Truman, it was explained to thevisitor that if his intentions proved to be non-hostile and he cooperated in aninformation exchange, he would be granted diplomatic status and soon berepatriated to his own kind when the arrangement could be made. To this hereadily agreed, provided he was not asked to give away any scientific secretsthat could alter the course of our natural cultural development. [530][text00029.html#_edn530]What comes next in the brief details the year-long diplomatic exchanges betweenthe extraterrestrial visitor and the Truman administration, before he wasreturned to his people: Altogether, the Aztec EBE lived under our protective custody on the Los Alamoscomplex for nearly a full year, from late April 1948 – until March of 1949.After that, he was sequestered at a private safehouse set-up by ArmyIntelligence … during which time he met with the President and other topgovernment and military administrators, prior to his being returned to hispeople in August of 1949. He gave the scientists and military debriefers a greatdeal of mostly non-technical information about his civilization and its motivesfor being on our Earth; a total of six hundred and eighty-three (683) pages oftranscripts were made of recorded conversations. [531] [text00029.html#_edn531] The reference to Army Intelligence almost certainly would have involved theInterplanetary Phenomenon Unit (IPU) that was set up after the 1942 Los AngelesAir Raid Incident, and was eventually absorbed by the USAF as confirmed in thereplies from Freedom of Information Act requests. [532] [text00029.html#_edn532]The briefing document goes on to explain how technology given to US militaryauthorities would also be given to the Soviet Union by the extraterrestrials: The EBE saw little harm in allowing us to keep the remains of his spacecraft forstudy, since he felt our understanding of it would only gradually develop. Hedid suggest that his people would “probably have to drop one in similarcondition in the laps of the Soviet Union – just for the balance of things to besustained,” and “You are welcome to take this up with any higher authority youcan find willing to listen to you, if you do not approve of this ….” [533][text00029.html#_edn533] In 1948, the United States and the Soviet Union were the world’s only knownnuclear powers and leaders of the two most powerful political blocs, so it makessense why they were specifically helped in this way. This means that it was notonly the U.S. which had extraterrestrial craft in its possession, which it wasdesperately attempting to reverse engineer to deal with the Antarctic Germansand extraterrestrial visitors, but also the Soviet Union had them as well.More startling is what the extraterrestrials said about “human-like” infantsthat were to be dropped off and raised on our planet: The team of scientists were told that the human-like infants were destined forour world anyway, and we were welcome to keep them. On 21 August 1949, the AztecEBE was returned to his own kind at a meeting site southwest of Kirtland AirForce Base, … and arrangements were made for a future meeting at the samelocation, to open diplomatic relations. [534] [text00029.html#_edn534] In gifting three human-looking extraterrestrial infants to US authorities, theapparent intent was for these offspring to be raised in human society, and inthe future, they could help establish friendly relations between our two worlds.There was also the possibility that the infants innately possessed higherunderstanding and knowledge (much like Nicola Telsa exhibited) which could laterunlock scientific advances. Therefore, the extraterrestrials would be raised inor brought regularly to classified USAF facilities to study and work withscientists on understanding how alien technologies worked, and the scientificprincipals behind them. Presumably, the same thing happened in the USSR. By1989, when the briefing document was prepared, the extraterrestrial childrenwere 40+ year old adults.The briefing document refers to President Eisenhower traveling to Kirtland AirForce Base In 1954 where he established full diplomatic relations with thehuman-looking extraterrestrials: The preceding diplomatic treaty was drafted by the director of the Majestic-12operation and a joint committee of extra-terrestrial visitors andrepresentatives of the U.S. Diplomatic Corps, as a statement of intent. It wasratified and signed at Kirtland Air Force Base … on July the eighteenth, 1954 byPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower and an individual on the behalf of the EBEs.[535] [text00029.html#_edn535] If the content of this DIA document is correct, then Eisenhower held additionalmeetings with human-looking “Nordic” extraterrestrial visitors besides the onethat had already occurred at Edwards AFB on February 20, 1954, wherein a groupof Nordics attempted to persuade President Eisenhower not to move forward withthe US thermonuclear weapons program. [536] [text00029.html#_edn536] Theirattempt was not successful, and the Castle Bravo nuclear test occurred just overa week later on March 1 with a 15-megaton hydrogen bomb.In chapter ten, it was explained that the meeting between Eisenhower and theoccupants of a flying saucer that landed at Holloman Air Force Base on February9, 1955, involved the Antarctic Germans who were allied with Reptilianextraterrestrials. So the diplomatic meeting at Kirtland AFB very likelyinvolved a different group of human-looking extraterrestrials to those who hadlanded at Edwards AFB, and with whom a diplomatic agreement failed tomaterialize due to differences over the US thermonuclear weapons program. [537][text00029.html#_edn537] Apparently, the Nordic group that landed at KirtlandAFB was not deterred from cooperating with the U.S. in various technologicalareas despite the continuation of its thermonuclear weapons program. Theyreadily left behind their damaged spacecraft for the U.S. to study, but they didnot give technical guidance for understanding its workings at the time. Thismeans that, in addition to the cooperation with the Grays, Reptilians, and theAntarctic Germans, the USAF also began cooperating with a human-lookingextraterrestrial group in order to advance their study and reverse engineeringefforts on captured extraterrestrial craft and related technologies.This is not all that surprising given what William Tompkins revealed about aNordic group of extraterrestrials who had infiltrated the Douglas AircraftCompany and other leading aerospace companies to help the US Navy design andbuild future space carrier battle groups. Tompkins described at length how thesehuman-looking Nordics would assist him with design problems, but without everrevealing their true identity to him or the other scientists and engineersworking in Douglas’ “Advanced Design” think tank. [538] [text00029.html#_edn538]Tompkins is not the only insider/whistleblower who says he encountered Nordicextraterrestrials in classified facilities helping to bring military plans forfuture space programs to fruition.According to Emery Smith, a former USAF Surgical Assistant who was stationed atKirtland AFB from 1990 to 1995, he met different types of extraterrestrialsworking within highly classified facilities on the base. [539][text00029.html#_edn539] Smith claims that among the different extraterrestrialshe encountered were a human-looking group that was living amongst the Earth’spopulation. This is a powerful corroboration that Kirtland AFB was at theepicenter of meetings and cooperation between the USAF and human-lookingextraterrestrials, as clearly stated in the DIA briefing document.Smith asserts that in addition to Kirtland AFB, he worked at other highlyclassified facilities which included Sandia National Laboratory and Los AlamosNational Laboratory, where he met and worked with human-lookingextraterrestrials. In a series of interviews completed on the popular onlinestreaming show “Cosmic Disclosure,” Smith says that the human-lookingextraterrestrials were indistinguishable from modern humans. In the August 7,2018 episode, he responded as follows to a question about whetherextraterrestrials really live amongst us: Well, extraterrestrials also come to watch over us and look at things on theEarth. And they’re here to gather information to make sure we don’t blow up theEarth or kill each other. So they’re here just to get information and have itand to also experience the life of a human, which is quite preferably like avacation for them.So, it’s a very interesting scientific job for an extraterrestrial to have. It’skind of an honor to come here, live amongst us, and do things, just living likea normal human being, actually, and interacting with human beings... It’s like auniversal Peace Corps. [540] [text00029.html#_edn540] Smith says that in addition to encountering such extraterrestrials in classifiedprojects run by corporations within USAF facilities, he had also recently beenbriefed that up to 100,000 extraterrestrials are presently living all over theplanet. [541] [text00029.html#_edn541] Smith’s testimony is highly significantgiven the contents of the leaked 1989 DIA document which identifies the start ofhuman-looking extraterrestrials living among us in 1954.The contents and implications of the DIA document, and its release during thefirst year of the Trump administration is astounding. This is especially sogiven the role of William Webster, Chairman of Homeland Security AdvisoryCouncil in the Trump administration, and the possibility that Webster wasinvolved in leaking the DIA document. The question that now urgently needs to beaddressed is whether the document is authentic or not.Authentication of the DIA DocumentDr. Robert Wood found many reasons that point to the leaked 1989 DIA document’sauthenticity and why it is an error to simply dismiss it as many UFO researchershave done to date. [542] [text00029.html#_edn542] His detailed analysis of thetyping, spelling mistakes, signatures, patents referenced, individualsmentioned, etc., in the document, led to his conclusion that it was a briefingdictated by a member of the Majestic 12 Group (most likely William Webster) totwo typists. They typed up the 47 pages, a copy of which was preserved onmicrofilm by the DIA as Dr. Wood explained: If one contemplates why there were so many errors made in a document officiallyrecorded on a microfilm, and you pronounce the word or phrase on the left andlook at the correct one on the right, usually they sound essentially the same.This would be consistent with the document having been created as a result oftaking dictation and having two different typists implement the words on paper…[543] [text00029.html#_edn543] Essentially, MJ-1 dictated a one-time introductory level summary for therecipient (who was new to his post) since one apparently was not available fromprior written records at the time.Since the DIA document’s cover page refers to itself as a “preliminary briefing”and it was created on January 8, 1989, the natural assumption to make is thatthe briefing was intended for President-Elect George Bush, who at the time wasthe Vice President and winner of the 1988 Presidential election. Presumably, hewas to be briefed by the then sitting CIA Director, William H. Webster. However,by analyzing the only signature appearing on the DIA document, Dr. Woodconcluded that the briefing was actually intended for a distinguishedastrophysicist at MIT, Dr. Philip Morrison: This is the only signature on the document, and the first question might bewhether it was the entry level person being briefed or the briefer. It seemsmuch more reasonable that it was the person being briefed. [544][text00029.html#_edn544] Dr. Morrison began his career as a nuclear physicist working on the ManhattanProject, and then moved his area of expertise to astrophysics to express hisdisapproval of the nuclear arms race. He became famous for his popular books anddocumentaries dealing with astrophysics and would continue to be a professor atMIT. In 1987, Dr. Morrison was the host of a six-part miniseries for PBS called“The Ring of Truth”, which examined a number of astrophysics topics. [545][text00029.html#_edn545] There is important circumstantial evidence indicating that the DIA document wasa briefing dictated by the head of Majestic 12, presumably the sitting CIADirector William Webster, for Dr. Morrison. In his MUFON article, Dr. Woodmentions that Dr. Morrison was on friendly terms with Carl Sagan, whom somebelieve replaced Dr. Robert Menzel as a member of the Majestic 12 committee uponthe latter’s retirement and death shortly after that, in December 1976: Philip Morrison was a very distinguished professor, who was a protégé ofOppenheimer and very likely was “in the know” on security issues, although Ihave no evidence of this. There is evidence, however, that he was very collegialwith Carl Sagan during his career, helping to arrange a [UFO] symposium at theconclusion of the Colorado study in Boston. [546] [text00029.html#_edn546] Notably, Dr. Menzel was named as MJ-10 in the Eisenhower Briefing Document.[547] [text00029.html#_edn547] In his book, Top Secret/MAJIC, veteran UFOresearcher Stanton Friedman provided detailed evidence that Dr. Menzel wasindeed a member of the Majestic 12 committee, even though Menzel wrote severalbooks debunking the UFO phenomenon. [548] [text00029.html#_edn548] Dr. Menzel isbest known for his popular astronomy books such as Field Guide to the Stars andPlanets . [549] [text00029.html#_edn549] Either before or shortly after Dr.Menzel’s death, the Majestic 12 committee was looking for anastronomer/astrophysicist who could replace him. The replacement would haveneeded a firm scientific grounding in astronomy/astrophysics, broad publicoutreach, and Dr. Menzel’s recommendation of approval prior to his death.Dr. Carl Edward Sagan fit the bill with his scientific pedigree. While a Fellowat Berkeley University, his work on NASA missions to Venus and Mars receivedwidespread scientific recognition. Most importantly, his scientific work came tothe attention of Dr. Menzel who arranged for Sagan to be given an AssistantProfessor position at Harvard University (1963-1968). Sagan moved to CornellUniversity after he was denied tenure at Harvard, ironically due to the growingpopularity of his generalist approach to science. Nevertheless, Menzel remaineda firm supporter of Sagan.Sagan achieved celebrity status through his popular books and documentaries,including his award winning Cosmos that aired on PBS in 1980 which was seen by500 million people across 60 countries. [550] [text00029.html#_edn550] If aposition was reserved on the Majestic 12 committee for a leadingastronomer/astrophysicist with outreach to a global audience through popularbooks and television documentaries, and required the approval of the previousposition holder, then Sagan was the natural replacement for Menzel.Similarly, by January 1989 when the Majestic 12 Group was looking for areplacement or an alternate for Dr. Sagan due to his impending retirement (hehad been in the position since at least 1976) or some other reason (Sagan diedon December 20, 1996), Dr. Morrison was a solid choice given his scientificpedigree, broad public outreach, and prior friendly relationship with Sagan.This is important circumstantial evidence in support of the authenticity of theDIA briefing document.Also, the fact that the 1989 document was merely a preliminary briefing dictatedby the head of the Majestic 12 Group for a new member taking up Dr. Sagan’sposition meant that little in the way of resources would have gone intopreparing the briefing document. The ad hoc nature in which the document wasassembled helps to explain the notable security-marking inconsistencies,spelling errors, cutting-and-pasting of different documents together, etc., asmany critics have pointed out. [551] [text00029.html#_edn551]In his MUFON article, Dr. Wood favored the authenticity of the DIA document withseveral compelling reasons, despite its multiple errors not uncommon indocuments of this type. By identifying Dr. Morrison as the recipient of thebriefing, rather than Vice President (President-Elect) Bush, Dr. Wood hasprovided the means of corroborating the document’s authenticity. Was Dr.Morrison being briefed as Dr. Sagan’s replacement on the MJ-12 committee due tothe latter’s retirement after 13 years or more of service as MJ-10?If indeed genuine, this document’s content offers a wealth of information oninstrumental topics ranging from the 1948 Aztec UFO crash; diplomatic relationsbetween the Eisenhower administration and extraterrestrial life; the role ofNikola Tesla in starting the modern UFO era; the working relationship withhuman-like extraterrestrials at classified military facilities such as KirtlandAFB; and perhaps most important in shaping future public perceptions, the factthat human-looking extraterrestrials are friendly and have been secretly livingamongst humanity for decades.Behind the LeakWhat conclusions can be drawn from the leaking of the 1989 top secret DIAbriefing document? First, the DIA document provides a startling version ofsuppressed history: friendly human-looking extraterrestrials began interactingwith humanity in the early 1900’s and observing our technological progresswithout any outright interference in human affairs. One important objective inthe leaking of the DIA document was that it would help greatly in realigningpublic perception over “human-like” extraterrestrials, so that any futureofficial disclosure of such visitors would not come as a great shock to theAmerican public and the rest of the planet.Second, the DIA document shows how a group of “Nordics” decided to assist humanevolution by sending one of their spacecraft bearing extraterrestrial babies as“gifts” to the U.S. in order to gradually stimulate technological and socialdevelopment in certain positive directions. The USAF was the militaryinstitution identified in the DIA document as the main beneficiary of thisarrangement, which was later corroborated by whistleblower Emery Smith, who hadmany first-hand experiences while working at Kirtland AFB from 1990 to 1995 andother USAF facilities where classified projects involved human-lookingextraterrestrials assisting.Third, it is more than coincidental that the most likely briefer in the 1989document was CIA Director William Webster who at the time of its leaking in June2017 chaired the Homeland Security Advisory Council, which provides detailedadvice on homeland security issues to the Council’s Secretary. It’s veryplausible that issues discussed in the DIA document were deemed important forpublic dissemination for homeland security reasons, and approval was given forit being leaked by the Secretary of Homeland Security. At the time, this wasnone other than retired four-star US Marine Corps general, John F. Kelly, whobecame President Donald Trump’s Chief of Staff on July 31, 2017, just over amonth after the DIA document’s release. This raises the intriguing possibilitythat Trump may have been briefed on what had happened and what the plan was forfuture revelations.Finally, it is more than coincidental, given the USAF’s reassessment of theirdecades-long cooperation with the Reptilians, Grays, and Antarctic Germansbeginning with the 1955 Holloman AFB meeting, that the 1989 DIA briefing wasleaked. The leak happened in June 2017, only a few months after Sigmund beganhaving “information exchanges” with SSP whistleblower Corey Goode in late 2016.The USAF had learned for the first time about the Navy’s Solar Warden programand other secret space programs, and the high-level diplomatic meetingsoccurring between these programs and visiting extraterrestrial groups. Due towhat Sigmund and other USAF SSP leaders had learned from Goode, William Tompkinsand other sources, the USAF had decided it was going to align itself to a muchgreater degree with human-looking extraterrestrial visitors who had previouslybeen suppressed.While the Aztec flying saucer crash and the 1954 meeting at Kirtland AFB had ledto an agreement with one particular group of Nordic visitors, otherhuman-looking extraterrestrial visitors were severely limited or hampered inperforming any activities on Earth. Indeed, the degree to which mosthuman-looking extraterrestrial visitors were suppressed only became clear in aninterview that Goode and Smith gave on Cosmic Disclosure on August 14, 2018. Theprogram host, David Wilcock, began the episode by asking Goode to explain whathe knew about the secret “Intruder Intercept and Interrogate Program”, whichGoode had briefly participated in during one of his SSP assignments:It’s a program that is similar in part to the Men in Black. What this Interceptand Interrogate Program does is that if an intruder flies into our [solar]system, doesn’t give a friend or foe signal and is intercepted, they are takenfrom their ship. Or, what happens in most cases is that ETs have made it to theEarth and are here secretly blending in as one of us.This group will go in retrieve the people that are here, we call the ETs people,the people that are here without permission, bring them up to a certain station,and their interrogation would begin to find out what was going on.This group also acted as a police force for non-terrestrial groups that are herewith permission. They helped keep them apart, and when they (ETs) had issuesthey acted just like police. [552] [text00029.html#_edn552] After describing the extraterrestrials, who were seemingly identical to humansand could easily blend into our society, Smith described encountering some ofthem during autopsies he would conduct for classified programs at Kirtland AirForce Base and other facilities around the country. [553][text00029.html#_edn553] He emphasized that they showed obvious signs oftorture: Emery: … Some of the extraterrestrials that we were working on in the lab, doingdissections and what not, some of these full bodied human extraterrestrialswould come in and they would be very badly beaten, where subdural hematomas arebeing beaten in the back of the head. It looks like they were tortured –sometimes many broken bones.I didn’t find out until later on that these beings were coming from a prison ora withholding cell of some sort and were being interrogated…. After hearing your[Corey’s] testimony, this is what we were receiving. Because usually they are inpretty good shape unless they were shot down or something. These had obviouslybeen beaten to death.Corey: … A lot of the times the individuals that were being interrogated justdied of stress and trauma … from the process. It was very disturbing. They weretagged and sent for study afterwards.Emery: We had a few that they actually starved to death. I’m not sure whathappened….Corey: There are prisons that they have for them. Some of them, where they bringthem like a conventional prison. That’s where they need to further interrogatethem for a while to get more information, or have them to trade off, or to tipus off. [554] [text00029.html#_edn554]The USAF decision to break from this earlier drastic policy of intercepting,interrogating and even torturing many human-like extraterrestrial visitors wasmomentous. It’s important to keep in mind that USAF leaders who had participatedunder the long-standing harsh policy had done so based on the limitedinformation provided to them by their allies and superiors within the Deep Stateand the Antarctic German-Reptilian alliance. Sigmund’s discovery of the DeepState’s deception over the technological advances that were kept from the USAFSSP led to the profound policy shift. The June 2017 leaking of the 1989 DIAdocument was a clear sign that the USAF SSP and its DIA, NSA, and NRO partnerswere intent on officially disclosing the existence of human-likeextraterrestrials.The policy shift had immediate results. The USAF SSP began to allow photographsto be taken of their antigravity craft coming out of sensitive facilities suchas MacDill Air Force Base, home of Special Operations Command. This offeredanother signal that the USAF SSP was planning to disclose itself soon to theAmerican public. In addition, the USAF SSP began to cooperate with the Nordicsvisitors, and at the same time turned their space assets against the Deep Stateand their now defunct German/Reptilian/Gray allies. The most dramatic resultcame when the USAF SSP partnered with the Nordics in intercepting and destroyinga ballistic missile attack on Hawaii launched by the Deep State that wasintended to start World War III. In the next two chapters, I will discuss eachof these two major developments involving the USAF SSP, and what it portends forthe future."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 19 USAF SSP Photo Disclosure of MacDill’s Antigravity VehiclesIf you reveal your secrets to the wind, you should not blame the wind forrevealing them to the trees.–Khalil GibranO n March 3, 2017, I received the first in what would become a series ofphotographs taken over seven months of differently shaped UFO’s seen in thevicinity of MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. [555][text00029.html#_edn555] Making circumstances even more significant, thephotographer, publicly known only as “JP” (a pseudonym), was prompted on severaloccasions by different strangers in passing cars, vans, or via phone calls tolook up into the sky at exactly the right time to see the UFO’s while also oftenbeing encouraged to take the photos. An organization had singled out JP to takethese shots which would reveal some of the different antigravity craft operatingin the vicinity of, or out of, MacDill AFB. All of this happened around the sametime that Corey Goode’s former interrogator-turned-source, “Sigmund”, wasconducting information exchanges with Goode (from late 2016 to mid-2017) afterlearning about the Deep State’s deception of the USAF; as well as the leak ofthe DIA briefing document that had taken place in June 2017, both suggestingthat the USAF SSP wanted to prepare the public for future announcementsconcerning human-looking extraterrestrial visitors.Later in early 2018, JP moved to Orlando, Florida, where he continued to havesightings and take more photos, including those of a spacecraft allegedlybelonging to a “Nordic” extraterrestrial who was working with the USAF.According to JP, the Nordic sought him out and relayed the message that hispeople were helping the Air Force’s secret space program, which demonstrates howthe USAF was now implementing a major policy shift to work with this group ofextraterrestrials instead of their former Deep State allies. These eventssuggest that the photos were part of a plan by the Air Force to prepare thegeneral public for official disclosure of the USAF SSP and the reality ofhuman-like Nordic extraterrestrial visitors.In early September 2017, as JP continued to supply me with photos of thedifferent antigravity craft flying near MacDill AFB, Hurricane Irma approachedFlorida and headed directly towards Tampa and MacDill. The base had to be shutdown and personnel evacuated as the hurricane made landfall at several Floridalocations, including Tampa. As I presented the photographic and testimonialevidence for the events around MacDill in articles during the latter part of2017, it was hard to avoid making the striking conclusion that, because the USAFSSP was deliberately allowing their craft to be photographed by a member of thegeneral public, MacDill was being targeted by the Deep State in retaliationagainst the USAF’s new policies and disclosure initiatives.While JP’s claims are sensational, it’s important to emphasize that they arebacked up by his excellent photographs taken with the tacit approval of the USAFfor public release. These photos have provided hard evidence that a USAF SSPexists and has begun to actively work with Nordic extraterrestrials, while alsoindicating that Air Force leaders want this information released to the public.What follows is the chronology of the photos supplied to me, my analysis ofthem, and their policy implications.JP’s Photos of Craft Near MacDill Air Force Base In 2008, I first began communicating with the photographer “JP” after he phonedme claiming he had recently experienced contact with a group of Nordicextraterrestrials while visiting family in Brazil. JP said that he had beengiven many ideas for advanced technology through downloads placed into his mindas a result of his first contact experiences. He then began designing andbuilding some of them upon his return home to Tampa, Florida, where he residedat the time. Before his Brazil experiences, he was an aspiring musician with noprevious technical background. Married with two children, his wife is a popularBrazilian singer with a flourishing career which includes singing at manyChristian devotional events. She has had great difficulty in accepting JP’sexperiences as either genuine or positive given her strong Christian faith, butshe acknowledges their significance for her husband. I have spoken with herabout JP’s experiences and explained how these are not uncommon, certainly not acase of demonic possession, and that JP has likely been chosen by a group ofextraterrestrial visitors to play an important role in future events. Given hiswife’s successful musical career and her sensitivity to JP’s extraterrestrialcontacts, he has chosen to remain anonymous and to use the “JP” pseudonym.After contacting two university professors about some advanced technologyinventions he was building, JP claims operatives subsequently approached himfrom one or more military agencies who wanted to work with him in building thedevices. I gave JP advice on dealing with his sensitive situation – given thathis extraterrestrial contacts wanted him to build free energy and othertechnologies helpful to humanity – because it was unlikely that these covertmilitary operatives would allow this technology to be shared under currentgovernment secrecy policy. JP says that after a period of working with thecovert operatives in building several of the devices, he decided to stop. Hisextraterrestrial contact experiences nevertheless continued, and he next beganundergoing military abductions. This “re-abduction” experience is very commonwith individuals having extraterrestrial contact, and extensive research hasbeen conducted on the phenomenon. [556] [text00029.html#_edn556] An example thathas already been discussed is Corey Goode who was subjected to multiple militaryabductions after going public with his experiences concerning differentextraterrestrial groups and secret space programs.MacDill AFB is the home of US Central Command and US Special Operations Command,which are two of the ten combatant commands under the Department of Defense(DoD) that are responsible for coordinating and deploying of US military forcesdrawn from all four military services: Navy, Army, Marines, and Air Force. Oneof Special Operations Command’s constituent units is Air Force SpecialOperations (Special Ops), which officially trains Air Force personnel for covertair operations but also secretly trains qualified personnel for classifiedoperations in space. As will be shown, JP was being encouraged to take thephotos of the flying craft by personnel connected to Air Force Special Ops andto have these disseminated to the general public.After receiving JP’s photos on March 3, 2017, of triangular-shaped craft nearMacDill AFB on March 3, 2017, I took no action and archived these for furtherstudy. Then on August 31, 2017, I received a new set of photos of atriangular-shaped vehicle taken near MacDill. The photos were captured atapproximately 8 am that day by JP and show a UFO that is similar in shape to theTR-3B, but JP estimated it to be much smaller – about 60 feet (20 meters)across. As stated in a previous chapter, the TR-3B was built in two sizes: aprototype of 250 feet (83 meters) and a working model of 600 feet (200 meters).Given that the TR-3Bs were built in the 1980’s, it would not be surprising thatby 2017 there would be operational models of different sizes, as now indicatedby JP’s photos. Due to the clarity of the photos and the significance of wherethey were taken, I decided to publish them and publicly announce JP’s existence(with his consent) for the first time. [557] [text00029.html#_edn557] The TampaBay Times subsequently published a story discussing the August 31 photos, alongwith later photos taken by JP. [558] [text00029.html#_edn558]The six photos from August 31 show a triangular-shaped craft that “powers up”with a circular energy pulse. The powering up is consistent with what we knowfrom whistleblowers such as Edgar Fouche, who have described how the TR-3Boperates using highly pressurized mercury-based plasma at high temperaturesrotating around a circular ring at 60 thousand rotations per minute (60k RPM) ormore. Significantly, the six successive photos by JP show a triangular craft“powering up” as if on cue when he started taking the photos. How the craftmoved as the photos were taken and the energy pulse it created indicate it wasnot an airplane, but an antigravity craft similar to a TR-3B described byFouche. This is what JP wrote to me in his Skype communication on August 31,2017: An amazing experience today[.] I felt the urge of looking up and snapping acouple pictures of clouds, beautiful evidence, spectacular. I saw a Triangle UFOship flying left to right, I guess it noticed that I saw it, it stopped, itgenerated some sort of bright energy ring then it shot up to space into the blueSky, nice technology … if I did get picked up, I don’t remember… I’ve created two composites of the six photos he sent. The first composite showsthe first three photos of a triangular-shaped craft that could simply be anexotic plane of some kind. The third in the sequence shows the beginning of the“power up” described by JP. A picture containing sky, nature Description automatically generated[Image00062.jpg]Figure 56. First 3 photos in series show start of pulsing (zoom inserts added).Taken by JP on Aug 31, 2017 However, it is the next composite of the last three photos taken which show aspectacular circular ring of energy appearing around the craft that remarkablydemonstrates it is an antigravity vehicle of some kind, powered by a glowingplasma ring similar to the one a TR-3B generates for propulsion. JP describedthe craft’s movements as darting around, then becoming stationary, and finallyshooting up. These are distinct characteristics of the maneuverability ofantigravity craft, not conventional airplanes or military fighter jets. A sky view looking up at the camera Description automatically generated[Image00063.jpg]Figure 57. Last 3 photos in series show circular pulse emanating from craft(zoom inserts added). Taken by JP on Aug 31, 2017 On September 4, 2017, JP sent me three more impressive and clear photos of atriangular UFO taken near MacDill AFB. The photos were taken around 9:50 am,about 10 miles from the Air Force base. His estimate of the vehicle’s size wasbetween 50-70 feet (17-23 meters). JP says that he quickly snapped the photosover a three second period and observed the craft for about 9 seconds in total.During this time period, the craft hovered and slowly moved towards his right.JP says that the craft then disappeared in an odd way, like an invisibilityfield sweeping over it from right to left over it. This suggests that thetriangular craft either used “cloaking technology” that would quickly move fromone end of the vehicle to the other, or JP saw the craft enter into the cloakedfield of a larger vehicle. A picture containing tree, sky Description automatically generated[Image00064.jpg]Figure 58. Photos of flying triangle (zoom inserts added) taken by JP on Sept 4,2017 The three September 4 photos show a different type of triangular craft to thosephotographed by JP on August 31. The August 31 craft appeared to have a largeexaggerated tail fin of some kind that was very visible before it powered upwith a luminous circular field generated by its propulsion system, and shot awayinto the upper atmosphere. Conversely, the September 4 craft disappeared usingsome kind of cloaking technology, and JP claims it looked similar to ones thathad come to abduct him in the past.Flying Triangle Sightings Continue as Hurricane Irma Approaches On the morning of September 5, 2017, I was contacted by JP about the unusualcircumstances that led him to take more photos, again of yet another type oftriangular-shaped craft in the vicinity of MacDill AFB. JP said he was promptedto look in the direction of the UFO by a stranger who drove up to him in anunmarked black car and instructed for him to see what was happening in the sky,and to take photos. Here is what JP said in his Skype communication to me about30 minutes after the incident which had occurred at 3:45 pm EDT: 3:45 today a guy in a black car dress[ed] in white with a black hat, sunglasses.Put his tinted windows down, drove towards me and told me to look up. I saw ajet pass by, the guy in the black car was already … [at] the stop sign makingthe right to leave, after I saw the jet there was a ship, no noise, interestingpictures. I even think it has a little bit more details. Figure 4 is the clearest of the sequence of five photos JP took after theincident with the mysterious man in white driving the black car. The September 5incident suggests that a covert operative out of MacDill was sent to get JP tophotograph the flying triangle very likely associated with Special OperationsCommand.

Photo of triangular craft (zoom insert added) taken by JP on Sept 5,2017 The next day, on September 6, 2017, between 7:00 to 7:15 am (EDT), JP took aseries of nine photos which very clearly depict a triangular-shaped craft thatagain appears to be a smaller version of a TR-3B antigravity craft. Three photosfrom the series of nine are shown that most clearly present the triangularcraft, which JP reports was strangely weaving in and out of the clouds indifferent directions. Significantly, these flying triangle antigravity sightingsover successive days were happening at the same time as Hurricane Irma washeading directly for Florida. https://i2.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Sept-6-2017-Composite-1024x614.jpg?resize=700%2C420&ssl=1[Image00066.jpg]https://i0.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Sept-6-2017-Composite.jpg?ssl=1Figure 60. Three photos of triangular craft (zoom inserts added) taken by JP onSept 6, 2017 On September 7, 2017, JP sent me six more exceptional photos in a series showinga flying triangle sighted again near MacDill, which was being shadowed by amilitary helicopter in what appeared to be a sanctioned military exercise orescort. Notably, JP described that the triangular-shaped craft was at timesstationary. Photo analysis has shown that the triangular craft was not apropeller driven drone or kite of any kind.Here is what JP said in his Skype message that was sent the next day at 9:23 amEST on September 8: WOW. Almost a whole week of sightings, I know a lot more people are seeingthese, this sighting is amazing … At 8:00 am I saw a black helicopter circlingthe neighborhood where I was at. Then around 8:25 am, 4 miles away from MacDillAir Force Base I saw the TR-3B interacting with this helicopter, some sort ofexercize. You can clearly see the size comparisons confirming the size that manywhistleblowers have talked about. The ship was on its side, top, side, facingthe helicopter, like communicating with it. You could tell the helicopter [was]stationary. Then it zips to the top on its regular position that flew over head… The helicopter went towards MacDill Air Force Base … the last photo isspectacular just like the last one seeing the details … not sure if theyequipped it already with weapons. JP estimated that the triangle craft was 100 yards from the helicopter, 500yards away from him, and 300 yards in elevation. He again estimated the trianglecraft’s size as around 50-70 feet (17-23 meters). All this occurred about 4miles (6.5 km) away from MacDill. A picture containing sky, outdoor, grass, road Description automaticallygenerated [Image00067.jpg]Figure 61. Three of the photos by JP of flying triangle and helicopter (zoominserts added). Taken on Sept 8, 2017 In my discussion with JP, I pointed out that the TR-3B was approximately 600feet (200 meters) wide according to reports by Edgar Fouche. JP responded thatthe craft he saw was much smaller but very similar in size and shape to the onesthat had picked him up in military abductions related to his extraterrestrialcontact experiences. JP explained that the interior of the craft seated threepeople in capsules that were designed to stay upright no matter what positionthe ship was in, like a gyroscope. This would enable the pilots to see forwardin terms of where the craft was traveling or move to whatever direction theywanted to see, no matter the ship’s orientation to external objects. Whencarrying a passenger, one of the capsules would stay in a horizontal position.In addition, JP described the capsules as having “a mind of their own” becausethey would automatically adjust to a person’s body shape. The capsules had acontrol panel that one or more pilots could use to navigate the craft. The craftdid not have windows but instead used a technology which allowed the pilots tosee through the metal alloy.The day after JP took the flying triangle with military helicopter photo series,a mandatory evacuation order was issued for MacDill AFB, in response to theimminent impact of Hurricane Irma which was projected to make landfall insouthern Florida on Sunday morning, September 10. [559] [text00029.html#_edn559]The evacuation order went into effect at 12 pm EST on September 8.Significantly, the evacuation order was mandatory for all personnel except forthose involved in “mission essential” activities: Personnel who are not designated as members of a ride-out team but who aredeemed mission essential or required to remain past 1200L 8 Sep 2017 by theircommanders to perform mission related duties will be excused from thisevacuation order until they are cleared for release by their commander. [560][text00029.html#_edn560] https://i1.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evacuation-Orders-MacDill-1024x551.jpg?resize=700%2C377&ssl=1[Image00068.jpg]https://i1.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Evacuation-Orders-MacDill.jpg?ssl=1Figure 62. Evacuation Order for MacDill AFB issued September 8, 2017 MacDill’s US Special Operations Command possesses significant undergroundfacilities which allow covert operations to continue regardless of a hurricane’sapproach. Given the approach of Hurricane Irma, it appears that SpecialOperations Command was conducting surveillance and possible “mitigationoperations”. It’s highly likely that Special Operations Command was conductingcovert operations in relation to Irma, but for some unknown reason they chose toalert JP to photograph their craft in operation. Are they sending a publicmessage, and if so, what did Special Operations Command want people to know atthe time of the impending chaos to be caused by the hurricane?Landfall for Florida happened early on September 10, 2017. Here is what ABC Newshad to say about the hurricane situation just after midnight on September 11 at12:21 am (EST) in a story titled: “Irma approaching Tampa Bay area withhurricane-force winds”: Hurricane Irma is barreling up the Sunshine State, bringing heavy rainfall andpowerful winds. The deadly hurricane, which is now a Category 2 storm withsustained winds of 100 miles per hour, was moving east of the Tampa metro area….Tampa, which is now experiencing wind gusts of over 50 mph, is in the predictedpath of the storm, and the city's mayor Bob Buckhorn did not mince words when hewarned residents on Twitter earlier today.\"We are about to get punched in the face by this storm. We need to be prepared,\"he wrote. [561] [text00029.html#_edn561] Note the date of Hurricane Irma hitting Tampa – September 11, 2017 (the 16 thanniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack). Tampa’s proverbial “punch in theface” as stated by the Mayor raises the intriguing possibility that HurricaneIrma was linked in some way with the flying triangle UFO sightings, which appearto be sanctioned by US Special Operations Command as a means of disclosing theexistence of a USAF secret space program. As a result, the question becomeswhether MacDill AFB and Tampa had been deliberately targeted using weathermodification technology. Did Maser Satellites Steer Hurricane Irma in Weather War against U.S.?Weather modification technologies date back to the 1940’s, when it wasdiscovered that chemicals could be seeded into the atmosphere to influenceweather. A 1978 US Senate committee report details how the US Congress has beeninvolved in reviewing weather modification technologies as far back as 1947; andsince 1953, six acts of Congress have been passed dealing with the subjectmatter. [562] [text00029.html#_edn562] In the early 1970’s, it was discoveredthat high frequency radio waves would provide the next major technologicalevolution in weather modification, according to Nick Begich and Jeanne Manningin their 1995 book, Angels Don’t Play This Haarp . [563][text00029.html#_edn563] They traced the technological developments that led tothe High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) and its multifaceteduses in weather manipulation and mind control.While ostensibly designed as a communications system, powerful radar arrays likeAlaska’s “HAARP” Research Station near Gakona could be used to bombard theEarth’s ionosphere with extremely low frequency (ELF) radio waves that wouldcause the Earth’s surface to heat up tremendously. HAARP produces weathermodification by artificially inducing high pressure systems which can be createdto steer moisture laden air from one area to another. Dane Wigginton fromGeoEngineering Watch described how this has occurred to create drought in theWestern United States: When the ionosphere is bombarded with the massively powerful RF / microwavetransmissions from installations like HAARP, high pressure heat domes can becreated and maintained. In the case of the current record shattering highpressure heat dome over the US West, the clockwise spin of upper level aircurrents around the high pressure zone allow the weather makers to steer coolerair from the Pacific into the center of the country while completely bypassingthe West. [564] [text00029.html#_edn564] HAARP’s ability to create high pressure systems can be used to steer hurricanesin whatever direction the controllers of HAARP desire. Wigington claims multipleHAARP facilities have been used in the creation and directional path taken byhurricanes such as Harvey and Irma. [565] [text00029.html#_edn565]In the 1970’s, another step in the evolution of weather modificationtechnologies occurred with the Air Force/NRO deploying military satellites withdual purpose surveillance and electronic weapons functions. These were laterincorporated into Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars) as afuturistic space-based defense system against intercontinental ballistic missileattacks using electronic weapons such as “masers” (Microwave Amplification byStimulated Emission of Radiation). It was found that masers loaded intosatellites could then generate powerful microwave radiation with great accuracy.Maser satellites were allegedly tested in the creation of many crop circles thatfirst began appearing in the English countryside in the late 1970’s, with largenumbers appearing by the late 1980’s.According to many scientists who have investigated the crop circle phenomenon,there is extensive evidence showing that microwaves were used to generate someof the elaborate patterns. For example, Professor Richard Taylor, head of theMaterials Science Institute from the University of Oregon identifiedsatellite-based microwave technologies as the most likely explanation for cropcircles. [566] [text00029.html#_edn566] Professor Taylor and others concludethat many crop circles have been created as a means of testing and refiningspace-based maser satellites, which can direct microwaves anywhere on Earth withpinpoint accuracy. Here is how another crop circle researcher who mentionspatents on maser technologies summarized his analysis of crop circle evidence: At many crop circle locations, especially the more elaborate ones, it appearsthat microwaves have been used to create the designs . The evidence of stalksburnt from the inside out exists . Small animals have been discovered at theseplaces that look exactly how an animal would look like if you shoved one of themin a microwave oven and blasted them until dead. Burned from the inside out .This fact to me, along with my knowledge of what is currently on the patentbooks, seems to indicate the use of military microwave weapons being directedfrom orbiting satellites . The evil outgrowth of Ronald Reagan’s Star WarsProgram. Masers! … Crop circles are, in my educated opinion, test firings ofmilitary weapons . [567] [text00029.html#_edn567] This is where crop circle researchers make the critical link to a key ingredientfor weather modification: Perhaps they are testing newly launched satellites to see if they work properly.Perhaps they are aligning the beam or beams. One thing is for certain,microwaves produce some mean heat! Stick a bowl of water in a microwave oven .Hit the start button. Three minutes later, you’ve transformed a cool bowl ofwater into a hot bowl of bubbling, boiling excitement . [568][text00029.html#_edn568] The work of crop circle researchers in identifying maser technologies asresponsible for creating many crop circles through their ability to heat watermolecules rapidly provides the critical element for understanding how hurricanescan be generated or steered anywhere around the world. Maser satellites can beused with pinpoint accuracy to heat up bodies of water anywhere in the world toaugment a developing tropical storm into a hurricane, and then steer it in anydirection.Maser producing satellites are classified military technology. However, it islikely that the Raytheon Corporation is involved in their use through its JointPolar Satellite System and Common Ground System which uses a network ofsatellites to survey weather systems around the world. Raytheon’s websitestates: The Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Common Ground System supports the latestgeneration of U.S., European and Japanese polar-orbiting satellites designed tomonitor global environmental conditions and collect and disseminate data relatedto weather, atmosphere and oceans. [569] [text00029.html#_edn569] Raytheon provides the data needed for forecasting models used by the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Raytheon has long been suspectedas a major player in weather modification due to its ownership of key HAARPpatents. [570] [text00029.html#_edn570]Identifying the different kinds of weather modification technologies in terms oftheir historic development and use helps clarify some key questions associatedwith Hurricane Irma. First, why would the Strategic Defense Initiative militarycontrollers in charge of maser satellites direct a major hurricane like Irmadirectly into a specific area of Florida to directly impact a critical militaryinstallation like MacDill Air Force Base, which is home to two major UScommands: Central Command and Special Operations Command?Second, why would the managers of a covert aerospace program at MacDill, usingadvanced antigravity craft, allow these to be on full display in broad daylightfor the general public and to be photographed by a witness who was even promptedto take the photos? For answers, we can turn to Corey Goode who receivedbriefings about the satellite weapons used in steering Hurricane Irma.Q & A Session with Corey Goode on Hurricane Irma, Maser Weapons & FlyingTriangles Over September 9 and 10, 2017, I asked Corey Goode a series of questions aboutHurricane Irma and the “flying triangle” sightings near MacDill AFB that werephotographed by JP. [571] [text00029.html#_edn571] The following text is aportion of that exchange: MS – Michael Salla / CG – Corey Goode MS: I know Raytheon and Lockheed are part of the weather forecasting used byNOAA. I assume they are involved in or getting tipped off by the Cabal about thestrength and direction of these hurricanes. Are they involved in the Masersatellites being used, or is this more the ICC [Interplanetary CorporateConglomerate]?CG: It’s closer to MIC [Military-Industrial Complex] level with heavy corporateties of course, built by both Raytheon and Lockheed and a few others. Placed inorbit in the 90’s by Shuttle and booster rocket tech. There are lots ofclassified satellites up there that aren’t even on the books with fake names.There are a lot of weapons platforms orbiting the planet right now that are apart of the MIC program.Some of the satellites that use microwave lasers were put up under the strategicdefense initiative mostly put in orbit in the 90’s. Classified documents showedthat the satellites were for taking out missiles on Earth as well as defendingearth from [the] unknown.MS: Makes sense they would have classified satellites doing that. So, do youthink the Raytheon Joint Polar Satellite System might be used in some way withthis? CG: Yes, it’s all about “Environment” aka weather, in my opinion, based onbriefings and other available exotic weapons platforms in orbit that I wasbriefed on years ago. Also, some remote imaging satellites that penetratehundreds of miles into the Earth.MS: No wonder the Inner Earth groups were concerned about us surface dwellers.CG: Exactly, we have satellites that can not only cause EQ’s [earthquakes] andvolcano eruption but also cause deep, deep earth penetrating waves that causethe implosion or explosion of deep facilities. Most likely ‘Rods from God’ willbe used in conjunction with the Triangle Craft, in a first strike on N. Korea,thus disclosing part of their program to the public.These Air Force base sightings are exactly what I told people about around 6months ago when I said people would start seeing triangle craft in the skiesmore and more leading up to the imminent revealing of a TR3B-like craft. Mostlikely, these exotic weapons platforms will debut during a first strike on NKorea. Then they will disclose the MIC SSP in stages based off of that showingof tech. Similar to how the Stealth planes were introduced…. They said the MICSSP would start accidentally showing their triangle craft and that we would seewhite orbs that are the corona of these craft (at night and day)… Glad I’m onrecord reporting that.MS: Might there be a connection between the HAARP facilities and the MASERsatellite systems working in tandem with Hurricane generation and steering, oris HAARP the older more antiquated weather modification system?CG: I’m told they don’t need the HAARP facilities… They are used for severalpurposes (HAARP arrays) they can do all weather modification from orbit now.MS: So, the increased microwave activity in Antarctica may not be related toIrma at all in terms of a HAARP type radar system? Basically, does Antarcticajust provide the control and command system of the ICC/Cabal that is directingthese MASER satellite systems to manipulate the weather?CG: The Command and Control can be from anywhere. Just a simple tasking of asatellite. This is mostly on the MIC (AF/DIA) SSP end.MS: So, basically, one faction of the MIC (AF/DIA), which is still Cabalaligned, is directing IRMA to hit Florida, thereby taking out another group,Special Operations Command, MacDill, that has become a threat? MacDill has nowbeen evacuated.CG: I believe so. Major distraction for the Military and maybe a bit ofpunishment for states that supported Trump.MS: Makes sense. The flying triangle sightings are therefore likely to increaseas the Special Operations people hit back using information warfare toolsagainst the Cabal.CG: Some of these Air Force assets (MOST) are Cabal controlled.MS: The most recent hurricane forecast shows how the eye of Irma passes directlyover MacDill Air Force base, Tampa, in the early morning of September 11. Isthis coincidence or a veiled declaration of war from those steering HurricaneIrma, which is derived from the name of the Old Germanic War Goddess, Irmin?CG: Hard to tell with this group. They could be directing the storm and showingthe craft is a part of disclosure of MIC SSP. I am hearing that the Cabalcontrolled MIC SSP is directing this for several reasons.MS: Two main reasons you’ve mentioned so far is: 1. The hurricane is steered topreoccupy the US military to delay/forestall a military coup to take down thecabal. 2. A way of revealing the USAF/DIA SSP through the flying triangles thathave been photographed. What other reasons might there be for the MIC SSP doingthis?CG: 3. Punish the alliance for its victory and those who supported it inelecting Trump. For each one of those there are at least a few dozen “SubAgendas”. [572] [text00029.html#_edn572] Goode’s responses make clear the significant role space-based masers have playedin augmenting and steering Hurricane Irma and others after meteorologicalprocesses naturally form them. His statement that HAARP technologies are anoutdated technology for weather modification raises two key interconnectedquestions. First, do those controlling the maser satellites have conflictingagendas with those running HAARP facilities around the planet? And second, wasIrma a false flag weather attack on the U.S.?Concerning the first question, if Hurricane Irma was an example of a weather warattack against the U.S. using space-based masers, then one or more factionswithin the US military may have used some of the HAARP facilities to mitigatethis attack. Certainly, US Special Forces Command at MacDill would have done allin its power to diminish Hurricane Irma, which was predicted to make landfallnear its headquarters. Indeed, after forcing the mandatory evacuation of MacDillon September 8, there was much expectation of a devastating hit to Tampa Bay onSeptember 10/11, 2017. [573] [text00029.html#_edn573] However, Irma wasdowngraded to a Category 1 when it finally impacted Tampa at the start ofSeptember 11, and MacDill suffered only minor damage and was quickly reopenedlater that day. [574] [text00029.html#_edn574]The antigravity flying triangles photographed by JP near MacDill from August 31to September 7, 2017, might have been part of the mitigation effort directed atIrma. Additionally, any HAARP facilities cooperating with Special OperationsCommand could have been used in the effort. This raises the issue of HurricaneIrma being a false flag attack. Goode pointed out that the maser satellites areunder the control of what he calls the “Military-Industrial Complex Secret SpaceProgram” (MIC SSP) involving USAF Space Command, the Defense IntelligenceAgency, and the National Reconnaissance Office.In addition, there may also be secret HAARP facilities in Antarctica that arebeing used in a weather war against the United States. In an article onSeptember 11, 2017, former Forbes magazine writer Benjamin Fulford cited unnamedNavy sources saying that electromagnetic waves were detected coming fromAntarctica. [575] [text00029.html#_edn575] This coincided with mainstream newsreports about large subterranean caves being discovered in Antarctica that werethermally heated to 77°F (25°C) and could support abundant life. [576][text00029.html#_edn576] Both William Tompkins and Corey Goode have said thereare secret R&D facilities scattered under the kilometers deep Antarctic icesheets that are controlled by various US corporations, which have historicallycooperated with the German Antarctic-based secret space program that escapedWorld War II largely unscathed. [577] [text00029.html#_edn577]Corporations such as Raytheon and Lockheed have each, in turn, led thelogistical operations of the US Antarctic Program, currently provide the weathermodeling for NOAA, and have allegedly worked closely with the GermanAntarctic-based SSP. [578] [text00029.html#_edn578] It’s also important tonote that the MIC SSP, which controls US military satellites including thosewith maser weapons forming a space defense grid, also have historicallycooperated with the Antarctic-based Germans. This points to programs inAntarctica playing a significant role in weather war attacks against the U.S.,partnered in collusion with some factions of the US Military-Industrial Complexto manipulate hurricanes such as Irma.Cylindrical UFO near MacDill AFB Affirms USAF-Nordic Alliance Only three days after MacDill AFB reopened from a mandatory evacuation due toHurricane Irma, UFO’s were once again photographed near the base by JP. Thistime the vehicles were “cigar-shaped” and at least 325 feet (100 meters) in sizeaccording to JP’s estimates. On September 14, 2017, at around 3 pm EDT, JP tooka series of 11 photos and also shot video footage of the cigar-shaped UFO whichappeared approximately two miles from MacDill. Several orb-like objects werealso moving around the cigar-shaped ship, which first appeared coming out of theclouds according to JP’s eyewitness account. Further, he claims that during thesix minutes of filming and photographing the incident, all city noises ceasedaround him and it became very quiet and peaceful. The din of the city quicklyreturned after the cigar-shaped UFO disappeared back into the clouds.A composite of three images which most clearly show the cigar-shaped UFO isshown with added close-ups (see Figure 63). The first image displaysapproximately five small orb-like objects which are likely scoutcraft that canenter and exit the cigar-shaped craft. JP emphasized that he felt “very calm andpeaceful” during the sighting as everything around him turned quiet. This madehim suspect that the craft was extraterrestrial in origin since the quieting ofthe environment was very unusual and he had not encountered it whilephotographing the flying triangles between August 31 to September 7, 2017. https://i2.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jp-sept-14-2017-composite-1024x840.jpg?resize=700%2C575&ssl=1[Image00069.jpg]https://i0.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jp-sept-14-2017-composite.jpg?ssl=1Figure 63. 3 photos of cylinder-shaped craft (zoom inserts added) taken by JP onSept 14, 2017 At the start of this chapter, I mention that JP first got in touch with me in2008 to talk about the extraterrestrial contact experiences he had while inBrazil. Later, it became clear that a human-looking Nordic group ofextraterrestrials was in communication with him. During his earlier contactexperiences, JP told me that he had unusual feelings of “peace and calm”, andnow his encounter with the cigar-shaped craft had generated a similar emotionalimpact on him. This is why he believes this particular craft is extraterrestrialin origin rather than part of the USAF SSP.However, something threatening occurred after JP took the eleven photos andvideo. Once the cigar UFO departed, he says the ambient noise returned and hereceived a phone call. The person on the line was very abrupt and menacing. Themale voice told JP, “don’t put [out] no videos, delete [them]”, then he hung up.Immediately after receiving the call, JP said it began to rain and two lightningbolts struck the ground in succession about 20 feet from him. He felt veryintimidated by the events and decided to delete the video, but to keep theeleven photos which he quickly sent to me.So, who called JP? A clue comes from another incident JP related to me whichoccurred the day before on September 13, 2017. JP was scheduled to visit aprivate residence for his job, and at this location, he and the customer begantalking. During this conversation, JP received a veiled warning as he explains: I was at a customer’s house and we were talking. We were talking about weathermanipulation. I never actually talked to this customer before. He told mesomething really, really interesting. The house that is in front of his is thehouse of the commander of the CIA at MacDill Air Force Base… I got cold feet,cold hands, the customer said, “we’re watching you” … He went inside. What this exchange suggests is that CIA operatives are closely monitoring JP,likely because he has been chosen to photograph the antigravity craft fromMacDill overseen by Special Operations Command.Importantly, JP claims that he has also been abducted and brought aboard the“flying triangles” on various occasions, and then taken to unknown locationswhere he encountered human-looking extraterrestrials. Since a group ofextraterrestrials is also cooperating in allowing JP to photograph theirvehicles near MacDill, this indicates that Nordic extraterrestrials are activelyworking with Special Operations Command to disclose the existence of antigravityvehicles and the presence of human-looking extraterrestrial allies.Such a scenario is bolstered by the leaked 1989 Defense Intelligence Agencydocument discussed in the previous chapter, which reveals how human-like Nordicextraterrestrials are friendly and can be relied upon, as opposed to some of theother calculating and deceptive extraterrestrial groups encountered by themilitary. [579] [text00029.html#_edn579] The leaked DIA document marks the firsttime that any Majestic document has ever referred to a “human-looking”extraterrestrial group. The DIA document and JP’s experiences add further weightto the conclusion that the USAF is now actively working with a Nordic group.This Nordic/USAF/DIA alliance is staunchly opposed by other factions within theUS Military-Industrial Complex, which helps to explain why Hurricane Irma wassteered towards Tampa and directly aimed at MacDill AFB, home of SpecialOperations Command. Goode has confirmed that such a factional war exists withinthe Military-Industrial Complex, which provides the infrastructure and corporateresources for the USAF SSP. This Nordic/USAF/DIA alliance would also explain whyJP, who was chosen to take and pass along the photos of various craft in thevicinity of MacDill for public release, has also been experiencing intimidationby another CIA-linked group that wants to slow or prevent such disclosures.Covert Disclosure of Antigravity Craft near MacDill AFBOn October 19, 2017, I was sent another series of photos by JP. This time nineshots were showing two UFOs in the vicinity of MacDill. One craft looked like arectangular platform while the other exhibited the now familiar TR-3Btriangular-shaped design. Both appeared to use antigravity technology and wereinteracting with one another. Before the October 19 sighting, JP says hereceived a phone call instructing him exactly when and where the UFO’s wouldappear. This is what he wrote in a Skype message: 11 a.m. I got a call to look at the skies... like around 11:02 I see thisrectangle platform black ship... it came out from the clouds 6 seconds afterseeing the ship... TR-3B shows up, you can see the characteristics of it, thecircle in the middle still glowing a little bit, in a blink of an eye it wasthere interacting with the black triangle platform ship similar to when it wasinteracting with the helicopter... this was quite fast, 2 minutes after the calllasting a minute and 20 sec. [580] [text00029.html#_edn580] He added in a later Skype message: The call was really fast like 10 seconds, the guy said (I’m calling to informyou to look at the skies clock view (10:30) in between East and North have anice day. Click… Next, JP writes that he has never encountered a rectangular-shaped UFO before,which flew in from the direction of the Gulf of Mexico: I never seen those platform looking UFOs Rectangle. It was quite interesting. Iwas hearing something weird this time like a high pitch sound my ears were kindof like ringing after the event.8 miles from MacDill this time.MacDill was in the Direction behind me. The platform ship looks like it camefrom the Gulf of Mexico. And I’m thinking the tr3b came from MacDill. They metup. [581] [text00029.html#_edn581] Here is how JP describes the sequence of photos and the interaction between thetwo vehicles in another message: I saw the platform ship and out of nowhere the TR-3b showed up in a blink of aneye... then started interacting with the platform ship. I don’t know the exactsize but all I can tell you, it was the same height where the clouds were.Me knowing that there are three levels of clouds, I’m thinking this is the lowercloud... 6500 feet.Those are regular cumulus clouds.They’re at least 6,500 ft from sea level. A close-up of the first photo in the sequence shows the rectangular-shapedplatform UFO taken by JP directly after he received the phone call telling himto look up into the sky. (see Figure 64) https://i0.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/JP-1-close-up.jpg?resize=700%2C646&ssl=1[Image00070.jpg]https://i0.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/JP-1-close-up.jpg?ssl=1Figure 64. Photo of rectangular-shaped craft (zoom insert added) taken by JP onOct 19, 2017 A close-up of the third photo in the sequence displays the rectangular-shapedplatform and the TR-3B-like craft, both appearing to interact with one anotherwhile JP watches and hears high pitched sounds. (see Figure 65) https://i2.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/JP-3-close-up.jpg?resize=700%2C618&ssl=1[Image00071.jpg]https://i2.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/JP-3-close-up.jpg?ssl=1Figure 65. Photo of flying rectangle and flying triangle (zoom insert added)taken by JP on Oct 19, 2017 Based on JP’s account of how the photos were taken and their estimatedelevation, size, sounds, and maneuvers, they, like his previous photos, do notappear to be merely balloons, drone aircraft or aircraft using conventionalpropulsion systems as skeptics may automatically assume. The fact that JPreceived a phone call to alert him is very significant. It clearly suggests thatthe UFO’s presence was deliberately brought to his attention to displayclassified technologies for photographing. The phone call he received on October19, 2017, and the photos themselves are further evidence that JP is being usedto facilitate a covert disclosure of antigravity craft operating in the vicinityof MacDill AFB. Four days later, JP was to witness the flying rectangle platformagain, and this time he claims the encounter became much more personal.On the morning of October 23, 2017, JP claims he was once again instructed tolook up into the sky, this time by two men in a nearby van who pulled up next tohim. Immediately, he saw a rectangular-shaped platform UFO and used his cameraphone to take five photos. He then noticed that he had missing time and when hetried to recall what had happened, he had memory flashes of being inside theflying rectangle he had just photographed. Here is the Skype message I receivedfrom JP at 10:49 am EDT: 9:30 am 30 minutes lost time... it was 10:08 when I get back in the sameposition where I was doing the pictures today. a white mini work van with twoguys black baseball hats Black sunglasses… He pulled over in front of me andtold me to look up and they left really fast like you can really hear thetires... a platform ship really near, it swooped up fast when it knew it got myattention…I was getting flashes on and off of me being inside of this ship, and lookingdown on the area where I was... in these flashes of remember[ing] being coldreally cold inside... the guys told me to look up, I saw the ship really close,then I saw the guys leaving really fast and I saw the ship swoop up... when theytold me to look up it was like 9:30, I’m guessing when I was taking the picturesof the ship it was already 10:05 10:08 am I could still smell inside the ship... it smelled similar when you have a lotof coins in your hands the copper smell... copper, copper, copper. Beautifulship amazing maneuvering. Cradling, it went back into the clouds… [582][text00029.html#_edn582] JP estimated that the flying rectangle was about four school buses in length(approx. 40-50 yards), and one and a half school buses in width (approx. 15-20yards). He said the distinct copper smell was likely related to its antigravitydrive or some other aspect of its propulsion system. JP specifically recallsbeing inside of the flying rectangle and walking down a corridor with windows.Outside the windows it was completely black, and he got the impression that therectangle was flying in space. He has provided a rough sketch of the corridor ofthe craft with a bank of windows on one side. https://i1.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Corridor-Sketch-234x300.jpg?resize=234%2C300&ssl=1[Image00072.jpg]https://i0.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Corridor-Sketch.jpg?ssl=1Figure 66. JP’s sketch of corridor inside the Rectangular-shaped Platform UFO JP remembers being injected with something, presumably a mind control substanceso he would cooperate. He shared a photo with me of an inflamed reddish area onhis upper forearm where he says he was injected. He also reported feeling somedizziness afterwards. However, JP reported this effect quickly wore off as didthe reddish discoloration on his arm.According to JP, the interior of the flying rectangle craft looked and smelledlike a military vehicle. Most importantly, he recalled a military patch worn byhis abductors which he described as having a red dot and two wings. He firstsketched the patch he witnessed and passed on a copy to me. We discussed thisfurther and hours later he found the specific patch online. The patch heidentified belongs to Air Force Special Ops. The Air Force patch suggests thatthe occupants of the craft were part of a squadron of vehicles operating out ofMacDill, the headquarters of Special Operations Command which provides thecommand structure for Air Force Special Ops.https://i0.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AF-Special-Operations-Patch.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1[Image00073.jpg]https://i0.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AF-Special-Operations-Patch.jpg?ssl=1Figure 67. Patch used by Air Force Special Operations It is rare for an experiencer or abductee to take photos of the craft which hasabducted him/her. Often people are incapacitated due to the effects of sedativesor mind control used on them. In the case of JP, however, he was instructed tolook in the sky by two operatives while still under the influence of thesubstance injected into him. What this indicates is that the operatives werepart of an officially sanctioned covert program run by USAF Special Ops whichwas helping JP to photograph the rectangular-shaped craft, and further, torecall his abduction experience. JP strongly believes that the operatives camefrom MacDill AFB, which is very close to where he was living at the time he tookthe photos.According to SSP insider Corey Goode, the rectangular-platform craft are weaponsplatforms whose genesis he explained in a personal correspondence: I think similar platforms or UFOs have been reported in the 80s and 90s as theywere first building out of these platforms that have modular weapons andpersonnel delivery systems or configurations. They were built up on thatsuperstructure type frame a long time ago and they [have] been improved uponsince but these are pretty old technologies both the TR 3B and the squareplatform… It’s crazy all of this is happening not six months after I announcedon Cosmic Disclosure . Based on the circumstances surrounding JP’s abduction and him being prompted bycovert operatives to look to the sky at the right time, it can be concluded thatthe rectangular-shaped platforms photographed by JP are part of a USAF-runsecret space program, which is deployed out of MacDill. JP’s military abductionexperience aboard the craft he photographed clearly suggests that these “flyingrectangles” have been covertly deployed in squadrons which are fully operationaland deployed by Air Force Special Ops in space. The disclosure of these fullyoperational space-based weapons platforms appears to have been sanctioned bysenior officials from Air Force Special Ops through Special Operations Command.Contact with a Nordic Extraterrestrial Working with USAF SSP In late 2017, JP and his family moved to Orlando, Florida, where his sightingsand extraterrestrial contact experiences eventually resumed. After a hiatus ofseveral months, he again took photos of “flying triangles”. Incidents occurredon March 16 and March 23, 2018, which once again clearly displayed TR-3B-typecraft. [583] [text00029.html#_edn583] However, it is what occurred later on May24, 2018, that holds special significance for understanding the extent to whichthe USAF SSP had begun working with Nordic extraterrestrial visitors.On May 24, JP claims he encountered a human-looking “Nordic” extraterrestrialwearing a USAF uniform who invited him to go for a ride in a landedsaucer-shaped craft in a secluded wooded area of Orlando, Florida. JP declinedthe offer but took photos with his cell phone of the spacecraft as it wasdeparting (see Figure 68). His conversation with the Nordic revealed that thisgroup was directly cooperating with the USAF and abiding by the terms of anagreement concerning interactions with the general public.What follows is the Skype conversation I had with JP which began at 10:32 EDT (Ihave removed minor grammatical errors and added missing words in squarebrackets): JP: 9am. Nice contact today.MS: What happened?JP: I went Into the Woods. I was hearing a ringing in my ear. I’m thinking itwas like a calling. Like I got from the last Contact. I met up with this man.Wearing a United States Air Force suit. Dark blue. His face was different.Possibly a Nordic.Light blue eyes, blond hair, wearing a United States Air Force Jumpsuit. He wasreally kind. He said a lot of these craft are going to be seen all over. Heinvited me to go into the craft. I said no. Yes [he asked] me again if I wassure…. I told him that we’re gonna start needing video evidence. He told me [that]because [of] a deal they have with the United States and other countries, theycan’t. This is consistent with the information contained within the leaked 1989 DIAdocument, as well as the testimonies of William Tompkins, Corey Goode, and EmerySmith presented in earlier chapters concerning human-looking extraterrestrialsblending into human society and working in classified USAF and corporatefacilities. Additionally, early contactees such as George Adamski, HowardMenger, and others have said that they learned about, and even helped,human-looking extraterrestrials blend into local communities to evaderecognition by the general public, and when necessary, national authorities.[584] [text00029.html#_edn584]It’s worth noting that the current Russian Prime Minister, Dimitry Medvedev,revealed in December 2012 that when he became President, he was given a highlyclassified file about how Russian and global authorities register and trackextraterrestrials secretly living among the human population. [585][text00029.html#_edn585] This all suggests that secret agreements have indeedbeen reached between public authorities and Nordic extraterrestrials, where anyvideo recording of their existence is not allowed by those they contact, just asJP claims he was told.I return now to my Skype conversation with JP where I next queried him on hisdecision not to accept the Nordic’s offer to go into his craft: MS: Surprised you said no. Did you get a bad feeling at any point?JP: No, I actually felt happiness, but I was kind of mad because of not gettingvideo.MS: Hmmm, would you have been allowed to take photos?JP: He told me: This kind of ship gonna be seen all over. After he talked to me.He touched me. I had a Flash that I was inside the ship. Floating around. It wasa split second. Then he told me, you’re back. Here, JP is illustrating that the “Nordic” had arranged for him to view theinterior of the craft without physically going inside. Perhaps astral projectionor some other kind of non-physical encounter had been made possible for JPthrough the Nordic’s more highly developed psychic abilities or through somealtered state of advanced consciousness. As our Skype conversation continued, JPwent on to write about the Nordic’s cooperation with the Air Force: JP: I ask him what’s going on with you guys and the United States Air Force. Hetold me that they’re working on a big project together. A couple of projects inthe Gulf of Mexico Involving a couple of MacDill Air Force personnel.MS: Why was he wearing a US Air Force uniform?JP: All these sonic booms are part of the project that they’re doing.MS: Did it have the USAF Special Operations patch?JP: Another type of space insignia. In the earlier October 23, 2017, military abduction incident, JP described theoccupants on board a rectangular-shaped spacecraft wearing USAF uniforms bearingthe patch of Air Force Special Operations. However, the patch worn by the Nordicin the May 24, 2018, encounter according to JP was different and contained thesymbols of a star and crescent. Later, JP explained to me that the uniformitself featured the acronym “USAF” with these letters also spelled out in aforeign language he did not recognize. Only after some internet research did JPdiscover that the letters looked very similar to ancient Sumerian. This patchenabled the Nordic to walk undisturbed inside USAF bases: MS: What made you think it was a USAF uniform and not a Nordic uniform?JP: To camouflage [himself] in the [USAF] base when they’re walking. It [thepatch] had United States Air Force.MS: Did he tell you he walks around on USAF bases, MacDill?JP: … Yes, in other bases around the worldMS: That makes sense. Did he say how long his group has been working with theUSAF in joint projects? When did it start?JP: We never got far in that conversation. I’m thinking a long time Michael.When he left… I ran to my truck.MS: Was the conversation done in English or telepathically?JP: English. European type. Like people talk in England. The perfect English.Not American.MS: Were you able to take any photos?JP: Yes. JP was only able to take photos of the craft once it took off, but not while itwas on the ground because his cell phone did not work at the 25 meter distancehe stood from the craft. [586] [text00029.html#_edn586] He estimated the size ofthe vehicle to be about 20 meters in diameter and it had three windows which hecould see through into the craft. I next asked JP questions about the Nordic’scooperation with the USAF: MS: What kind of projects were the Nordics working on with the USAF?JP: Training how to maneuver the ships. Invasive [evasive] maneuvers all aroundUnited States, in Europe, in Middle East, Russia, Asia.MS: The Nordics were teaching the USAF invasive [evasive] maneuvers? Can youexplain more?JP How another craft chasing another craft. Is not the same as a jet chasing ajet.MS: Were the Nordics sharing technology with the USAF or just know how?JP: The United States Air Force has the technology but does not know how tocorrectly use it. Is [like] the comparison of dropping a smartphone to an Indianin the Amazon. The Indian would not know how to charge [the] phone, will notknow how to search through … So basically, they’re teaching the technology, thephysics. When to use the weapons because the weapons sometimes affect theability of the craft when it’s flying. The weapon that the craft has is apulsing weapon energy superheated [or superheated energy weapon]. Beams oflight, Radioactive, how to interact with thunderstorms to conserve and gainenergy. It’s worth pointing out here that based on the testimonies of Tompkins , Goodeand other whistleblowers, the US Military-Industrial Complex needed to work withGerman scientists after World War II to learn about the technology of crashedextraterrestrial spacecraft that had been recovered from Roswell and elsewhere.[587] [text00029.html#_edn587] [Image00074.jpg]Figure 68. Photo courtesy of \"JP\" (zoom insert added) Conclusion Based on JP’s testimony, the USAF still needs assistance to understand Nordictechnologies which are reportedly more advanced than those found aboard therecovered spacecraft belonging to the small Gray extraterrestrials who haveworked alongside USAF engineers and scientists at classified facilities fordecades, as presented in chapter 11. It’s worth emphasizing that in many of theincidents involving JP taking photographs of USAF aerospace vehicles, he wasprompted by covert operatives to look in the direction of the craft. Thisindicates that JP has been selected for some reason to be part of a sanctioneddisclosure initiative where he is being helped to reveal the existence of a USAFSSP and their growing alliance with Nordic extraterrestrials.JP’s testimony, backed by multiple photographs, is concrete evidence that theUSAF has made a dramatic decision to work with a previously shunned group ofNordic extraterrestrials, and to break away from its earlier alliance with theDeep State/Antarctic-based German/Reptilian faction. These former alliespromised much in the way of advanced technologies but only delivered thesetechnologies decades after they had become redundant. Once leaders and personnelwithin the USAF SSP discovered that an advanced Navy SSP existed, which wasbuilt with Nordic assistance, it became a determining factor in this dramaticturnaround. The Deep State retaliated against the USAF SSP by using its masersatellite system to direct a hurricane against MacDill AFB, home of a criticalelement of the USAF SSP – Air Force Special Operations. Thankfully, the DeepState did not succeed, and the hurricane threat was significantly mitigated bythe time it hit Tampa, Florida. Even more significantly, the USAF SSP has beenable to turn the tables on the Deep State by using its space-based weaponssystems, including some of the same type of maser satellite systems used by theCabal to neutralize a false flag operation involving a ballistic missile attackover Hawaii intended to start a Third World War."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 20USAF SSP Shoots Down Deep State “False Flag” Missile Attack on Hawaii When the will defies fear, when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate, whenhonor scorns to compromise with death – that is heroism.– Robert Green IngersollState of Hawaii Issues Ballistic Missile Alert on January 13, 2018 O n a typically warm and sunny morning in the state of Hawaii, as islandresidents and a multitude of vacationing tourists on holiday began theirSaturday activities, cell phones across Big Island to Kauai suddenly blared anemergency alert message.

Emergency Alert messages issued by the civil authority to residentsof the State of Hawaii Someone within the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA) had pressed thewrong button according to local State authorities. [589][text00029.html#_edn589] On January 30, the Governor of Hawaii David Ige gavea press conference about the results of an official investigation into theJanuary 13 ballistic missile alert that was allegedly mistakenly issued . [590][text00029.html#_edn590] Brigadier General Bruce E. Olivera (ret.) wrote thereport for the investigation which was issued to Major General Arthur J. Logan,Director of HI-EMA. The synopsis said: At approximately 8:06 am, the SWP (HI-EMA State Warning Point) mistakenly issueda BMA [Ballistic Missile Alert]. As the investigating officer and carefullyconsidering the facts, I find a preponderance of evidence exists thatinsufficient management controls, poor computer software design, and humanfactors contributed to the real-world BMA and the delayed false BMA correctionmessage that was issued over the WEA/EAS [Wireless Emergency Alert/EmergencyAlert System] on January 13, 2018. [591] [text00029.html#_edn591] According to the investigation, a drill was spontaneously scheduled by overnightSWP shift supervisors for the beginning of the morning shift (shortly after 8:00am) and proposed the following timeline for what happened: 0800 – In preparation for the BMA [Ballistic Missile Alert] response drill,Employee 4 and Employee 2 discussed their plan to conduct a BMA at the end oftheir shift. Employee 4 prepared a recording of PACOM BMA notification scriptfrom the BMA Checklist manual. Employee 4 discussed leaving the SWP area whileEmployee 2 told the dayshift about the previous shift change drill. It's important to emphasize here that the investigation directly implied that noactual warning came from Pacific Command (PACOM). Instead, the PACOMnotification was said to be merely a “notification script” written in-house byEmployee 4. This means that as far as PACOM was concerned, there was no directconnection between the HI-EMA drill and the security measures implemented atPearl Harbor and other PACOM facilities. The timeline continues: 0803 – The incoming day shift entered the SWP. Employee 4 met with Employee 5and discussed the BMA drill.0806 – Employee 4 initiated the BMA drill using a phone outside the SWP areacalling into the SWP STE [State Warning Point Secure Telephone Equipment].Employee 2 activated the STE speaker. At this time, it was announced loud andclear, “EXERCISE, EXERCISE, EXERCISE,” and then concluded with, “EXERCISE,EXERCISE, EXERCISE,” which is a normal procedure for all drills including thisBMA drill.…0806 – Employee 1 logged into the AlertSense system and waited for Employee 3’sannouncement of the simulated siren warning activation. Following the simulatedsiren announcement, Employee 1 erroneously activated the real-world Alert Code. * There is a drop-down menu that includes: * Test missile alert (this sends message internally to agency) * Missile Alert (this sends message to public) * Missile alert was selected. * The computer asks to confirm choice. * Employee 1 clicked yes.0807 – SWP began receiving WEA/EAS message on their personal smartphones The official timeline of events went on to state that US Pacific Commandnotified Hawaii State authorities that there was no missile launch at 8:10 am, 3minutes after the warning went out. Local authorities attempted to inform thepublic via a variety of means that the ballistic missile alert was a falsealarm. But it was only at 8:45 am, 38 minutes after the initial alert, that asecond emergency alert was sent over the Public Alert and Warning Systemannouncing the mistake. The official investigation concluded that the emergencyalert was a false alarm due to human error caused by a HI-EMA employee who hadconfused a hastily organized drill with a real-life ballistic missile attack.Indeed, the report emphasized that the responsible employee “has confused reallife events and drills on at least two separate occasions”. [592][text00029.html#_edn592] Additionally, the report attributed the 38 minute delaybetween the alert being issued and the cancellation notice going out due tofurther human error: HI-EMA mistakenly believed that it had to consult with FEMA [Federal EmergencyManagement System] to issue an event code which contributed to the 38 minutes toissue an official notification that the threat was false. HI-EMA has correctedthis concern and understands that it is the HI-EMA’s authority to issue anofficial notification. [593] [text00029.html#_edn593] There are a number of problems with the official Hawaii State narrative whichtells us it was merely a HI-EMA in-house drill without any link to an actualnotification received from PACOM about an inbound ballistic missile. First,there are eyewitness reports of Naval Station Pearl Harbor activating itsemergency sirens and evacuating personnel. For example, one eyewitness stayingnext to the Pearl Harbor naval base described in a video how the base’s sirensystem went off during the alert, and he watched personnel being evacuated.[594] [text00029.html#_edn594] This was later confirmed with the release of anemail from Admiral Harry Harris to a senior Air Force officer about the missilealert in which he described the siren (aka Big Voice) going off: “Just for my education and edification, when the Big Voice went off at PearlHarbor-Hickam this morning, there was no indication that this was a drill; infact just the opposite… So, what happens on the flight line, and what message,if any was passed to aircraft in the air?” [595] [text00029.html#_edn595] The siren going off at Pearl Harbor contradicts the Hawaii investigation’sreport that PACOM did not issue the alert and it came only from local Hawaiianauthorities. The conclusion emerging here is that PACOM had issued a missilealert to its facilities, the message was then immediately relayed to HI-EMAwhich put out its public alert message at 8:07 am. Afterward, PACOM issued the8:10 am cancellation that once again went to HI-EMA, which then began declaringa false alarm.Second, the information provided during the interrupted television broadcasts byCBS and NBC affiliates contained several more details about the threat receivedfrom PACOM, which the stations used in their public alert messages. Details suchas “a missile may impact on land or sea within minutes” was missing in theofficial Hawaii State alert message that only stated: “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREATINBOUND TO HAWAII”, and had no information about it making its impact “withinminutes”, as announced on the television broadcasts. This means that thetelevision networks acquired their information from sources other than HI-EMA.It also points to PACOM as the original source for putting out the alertinformation that was picked up by television and radio sources. The additionalinformation relayed in the television broadcasts suggests that PACOM wastracking an inbound missile and was informing military personnel and members ofthe media that impact was only minutes away. This incongruity between theadditional information transmitted by the television stations and the roleplayed by PACOM has been completely ignored in the Hawaii State report.A third problem with the Hawaii Report is that an anonymous Airman working as aFusion Analyst at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickham, who was on duty at the timeof the alert, posted his/her experiences on the 4chan forum . S/he pointed outthe great amount of confusion over the alert which was at first considered by USPacific Command personnel to be a drill, and then soon after, a genuine attack.This would explain why the television broadcasts had additional information:PACOM personnel had shared it immediately after they were themselves informed ofan “official attack”. Significantly, s/he points out that it was only after theWhite House replied “Negative” to a request for a military response to thepresumed attacker, North Korea, that local authorities in Hawaii were instructedby the Governor to say it was all a false alarm. This is what the Airman postedat 7:15 pm on the day of the alert: Hickam AFB Fusion Analyst here. The false alert was not a mistake. It wasordered. We were informed it was to be a drill, but then all information was putout that the threat was real. Immediate contact was to the White House andrequests were made for retaliation. I think there was a push to have the WhiteHouse approve an attack on foreign vessels off the coast. When the White Housereplied “Negative” and demanded further information, my superiors called Gov.David Ige where he ordered us to contact media outlets of there being a falsealarm. One of the Gov. Aids was present and speaking with who looked to be afederal investigator. I overheard them state this “Demonstrated weakness in theTrump admin and a refusal to protect the people.” [596] [text00029.html#_edn596] The Hickam airman’s information reveals that the alert was not merely anin-house drill hastily concocted by shift coordinators at the HI-EMA facility,as indicated in the official report. The drill was coordinated with PACOM allalong, and PACOM personnel were notified at some point that the drill hadmetamorphized into an actual ballistic missile attack that was only minutesaway. This would explain the television messages announcing a missile impact inonly a few minutes, whereas the HI-EMA alert at 8:07 am had only the originaldrill message warning of an inbound ballistic missile. Put simply, thetelevision broadcasts were reporting on further information provided by PACOMafter the HI-EMA alert had gone out.Furthermore, the confusion over whether the missile alert was only a drill or agenuine strike has all the tell-tale characteristics of a “false flag” attack.These are known to be implemented under exactly these same circumstances.Similar confusion arose amongst security personnel in past false flag eventstaking place on September 11, 2001, (New York) and July 7, 2005, (London), etc.In these alleged terrorist attacks, military and government authorities werefirst told a drill was taking place where security forces were instructed tostand down, and then everyone was informed that a real attack was occurring bywhich time it was too late to prevent the attack. Analysis of this patternobserved in past alleged false flag attacks has led to the conclusion that: “Theexercise or drill – at the same time, at the same place – has become the sinequa non or indispensable element of the recent false flag operation.” [597][text00029.html#_edn597]The final problem with the official Hawaii report is that eyewitnesses claimthey saw a meteorite, or something like it, exploding high in the sky over theHawaiian Islands around the time of the alert. Several witnesses also reportedwatching a television story about an exploding meteorite or object before thenews story was pulled. Such reports were ignored by the mainstream media whichexclusively focused on the Hawaii State authorities’ explanation for the problemoccurring due to one person pressing the wrong button. This is why alternativemedia reports of an intercepted nuclear missile attack need to be considered.Importantly, they raise another scenario that better fits the true sequence ofevents which took place on that Saturday morning: the USAF SSP had intervenedto neutralize a false flag attack orchestrated by the Deep State, and thisclassified information was covered up.Alternative Media Reports & Witnesses Point to Genuine Missile Attack A number of alternative media outlets citing anonymous sources reported thatthere was a real missile launched against Hawaii. Among the first was a newsreport appearing on the Operation Disclosure blogsite on January 13, 2018. Itwas titled RV/Intelligence Report and said: Missile launches were detected in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Hawaii. Thelaunches originated from the same anomaly detected yesterday, Jan. 12. Themissiles were immediately intercepted and destroyed. The anomaly was revealed tobe a nuclear stealth submarine. The nuclear stealth submarine was located anddestroyed shortly after the attempted attack. [598] [text00029.html#_edn598] On January 16, a still active US military officer known to former USMC and CIAintelligence analyst, Robert David Steele, came out under the pseudonym “DefDog”to state publicly that the Hawaii event was an intercepted nuclear missileattack. [599] [text00029.html#_edn599] After explaining how the emergency alertsystem is designed to prevent the kind of human error claimed by stateauthorities, DefDog wrote: There was a missile. Probably fired from a submarine under the control ofindividuals loyal to the Deep State ... The missile was not fired from NorthKorea or by North Korean forces. The missile was intercepted. Then the coverupbegan. [600] [text00029.html#_edn600] An additional alternative news media source corroborating key aspects of thethwarted missile attack against Hawaii is a veteran journalist and orthopedicsurgeon, Dr. Dave Janda. [601] [text00029.html#_edn601] He revealed in a radiointerview what a “Deep Level source” known to him for years had told him aboutthe Hawaii missile incident: “What this source told me was that, and again I’venever found this source to be wrong, was that there was actually a missilefired.” [602] [text00029.html#_edn602]There are also witness reports of something being destroyed high over theHawaiian Islands during the morning of the alert. In a video published onJanuary 14, 2018, Marfoogle Watutu (a pseudonym) says he was told by his sister,a Maui resident, about a tourist boat which carried multiple eyewitnesses to theexploding meteorite: My sister has lived in Maui for eight years and what she is finding out is thata group of boaters that actually run a tour company say now that they sawsomething get blown out of the sky . So, they said it looked like a meteor and then all of a sudden there was a bigboom and it lit up the entire sky . It was 8 o’clock in the morning... Maybe this was not a drill after all . Maybe our Boys in Blue and Boys in Greenshot it down. And I would think that the U.S. would not want to cause more panicif they did try to launch something at Hawaii. Then, of course, they would sayit was a mistake. They took responsibility very quickly that it was amistake... This could be bullshit but I just had to relay that... [603][text00029.html#_edn603] Some of the tourists were interviewed by a local news channel that purportedlyaired the story once before it was pulled.In the 500+ comments to Marfoogle’s video, various people claimed they were alsoan eyewitness to the exploding object in the sky or saw the television newsstory. What follows are three independent comments that cast light on whatreally happened during the missile alert. I was awakened by a Thundering sound, thought it was 7:00 AM but it was 8:00 AM.My clock is shaded from where I sleep. I live on the N.Shore of Kauai. We didnot receive a cell phone call, my Son called to inform us, he lives in town. Weshould have had a Civil Defense Siren sound but there was None! Definitelysomething was Not normal in the Civil Defense Warning System. Many People do nothave cell phones in rural area’s. These siren’s are tested every 1st businessday of Every Month, for as long as I have lived here in Hawaii, 32 year’s .﻿(Janie Langley) So I live on Island and our family has a lighthouse, we all saw a bright flashthat morning as well. There is much buzz about this ... Thank you for actuallyputting what islanders are all talking abou t﻿ . (Ashly P) My cousin lived there, she came back to the states because of this, and she toldme the same thing … that something was shot out of the sky that morning. (JaycenLeapline) [604] [text00029.html#_edn604] The next four comments focus on an alleged KHON2 news story about the incident,the first of which refers to a tourist boat and an exploding object that wascovered in the story. You are right. I did see a video of the tourists on [the] boat and there wassomething blown out of sky. But it was deleted right away. I stay [on] Molokai,Hawaii. Also there is more than one button to push. Seen that video also and nowit is gone… [Yoshi Copeland] I’m on Oahu, there was a news story and then it cut straight to commercial, I ama sceptic usually, but I did see this my self. [Themexican21491] I don’t know why people are doubting this, it WAS on the local news and then thefeed was cut … at least 10 fellow islanders have commented here agreeing withme… [Alex Woo] I saw something about it on the news, but it has since been taken down … nosurprise there [Kevin Brown] KHON2 had a snippet of this but its no longeravailable? A lot of people on Island are saying they saw lightning in themorning of the false alarm, very weird… the sky was blue as ever. [DarrenCultis] [605] [text00029.html#_edn605] Since I have resided in Hawaii since 2004, I investigated Marfoogle’s claimsusing my own local network. Local residents told me that witnesses were beingvisited and intimidated by police and other authorities who told them to remainquiet. In addition, I spoke to a Maui boat captain who believed that somethinghad been shot down because the week following the alert, she had never seen somany US Coast Guard vessels scouring the area. Such reports help to explain whythe only sources to emerge so far have been anonymous.Let’s come back to the anonymous Fusion Analyst airman at Hickham AFB who workedin a sensitive military intelligence position. The Airman described how theTrump White House requested further information rather than choosing toretaliate against the alleged source of the ballistic missile attack. It appearsthat cooler heads at the White House did not order military retaliation againstNorth Korea after the missile was shot down. President Trump and his nationalsecurity advisors likely suspected that a false flag attack had been attempted.Indeed, this is exactly what another anonymous military intelligence source wastelling the public via online postings, operating under the pseudonym “QAnon”. “Q” Exposes False Flag Attack Meant to Start WWIII “QAnon” (aka “Q”) is widely regarded to be a group of military intelligenceofficers working within the Trump White House who have been given theauthorization to leak classified information to expose the Deep State and thoseseeking to undermine the Trump administration. [606] [text00029.html#_edn606]QAnon’s posts first appeared on the 4chan forum on October 28, 2017, and thenmoved to the 8chan forum just over a month later when the original site wascompromised. [607] [text00029.html#_edn607] Q appears to have predicted anupcoming false flag missile attack in six posts on January 7, 2018, six daysbefore the Hawaii missile alert. One post referred to DEFCON 1 and five othersto DEFCON [1], which is a defense readiness condition used by the US Departmentof Defense. [608] [text00029.html#_edn608] DEFCON 1 signifies nuclear war isimminent and is the most serious state of defense readiness. In post 500, Qwrites: DEFCON 1…[non-nuclear][1] OWL [1]Q [609] [text00029.html#_edn609] Q is suggesting that a staged or false flag nuclear attack against the U.S. willbe thwarted because of the intelligence gained through the US militaryintelligence community’s eyes (the “OWL” reference likely refers to the NSA,NRO, etc.) about such an upcoming event.On the evening of January 13, after the false Hawaii missile alert, Q linked thealert to the previous DEFCON 1 or [1] posts that had been made on January 7.Here is the first part of Q’s post #520: BIG news week?Future proves past.What news was unlocked?Do you believe in coincidences?>U1What public disclosure occurred re: U1?>DEFCON 1 [non-nuke FALSE]COMMAND?WHY?NECESSARY?NO SUCH AGENCY.Where did POTUS stop [post] ASIA?IT WAS NECESSARY.FOR GOD & COUNTRY.IT WAS NECESSARY.NO OTHER VEHICLE TO REGAIN ENTRY.: [AGAIN] direct pre-knowledge.: [AGAIN] warning ALERT. [610] [text00029.html#_edn610] Q’s reference to a “Big News Week” and “Future proves past” is informing us thatissues raised in previous posts had just been proven true. One of these involvedthe “DEFCON 1 [non-nuke FALSE]” issue. Q was linking directly to the earlierJanuary 7 posts and saying that the event that occurred in Hawaii on January 13was related to the predicted “DEFCON 1 [non-nuke FALSE]” event. One way ofinterpreting Q’s usage of a double negative “non-nuke FALSE” is that the “falsemissile alert” was, in fact, a real nuclear missile attack on Hawaii. This isconsistent with the whistleblower and witness reports discussed earlier and isalso substantiated by later Q posts, which will soon be discussed. First,however, I need to analyze an alternative interpretation of Q’s posts on theHawaii missile alert to get a more comprehensive picture of what reallyhappened.An alternative explanation focuses on Q’s reference in post #520 to the NSA (“NoSuch Agency”) and Trump’s inability to get access to classified files being heldat the NSA’s Honolulu facility, which allegedly was controlled by the DeepState. According to several Q posts, Edward Snowden is really a CIA asset whosemission has been to penetrate the NSA, and to eventually leak files from itsHonolulu facility to the global media to undermine the NSA’s surveillance of theDeep State/CIA. [611] [text00029.html#_edn611] Apparently, Trump’s short visitto Honolulu, which occurred while en route to Asia for his November 2017 tour,was to specifically go to this secure NSA facility and use his Commander inChief authority to get access to all the files exposing Deep State malfeasance.[612] [text00029.html#_edn612] Q’s references to “Command?” and “BDT” (Bulk DataTransfer) in a January 7 post suggests that Trump had been denied access and aworkaround was put into place involving a security protocol involving “BDT”.[613] [text00029.html#_edn613]Consequently, one interpretation of the January 7 post is that the Hawaiimissile alert was an attempt by the Trump administration to implement the BDTsecurity protocol so that all the NSA files held at the Honolulu facility couldbe transferred back to NSA headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland. Thisinterpretation was first raised by Jordan Sather, who runs the popular“Destroying the Illusion” YouTube channel, where he was among the first toanalyze Q’s posts. Sather’s interpretation has been summarized as follows: Documents necessary for freeing America from the iron grip of the Deep Statewere being held hostage in Hawaii. It is there that the NSA maintains one oftheir most important facilities. Because of their hostility and the MAGNITUDE oftheir corruption, the documents requested were not being surrendered to theTrump Administration, and were most likely in danger of being destroyed.The only way to obtain these documents was to trigger a bulk data transfer(BDT). This could happen if the Emergency Missile System were activated. In thisscenario, a fail-safe measure comes into play: When the alert is activated, allof the data is transferred to the Pentagon, in the form of a BDT.Is it possible that the fake missile alert (that occurred in Hawaiion January 13th), was a necessary event, enacted to trigger the bulk datatransfer from the NSA in Hawaii, to the Pentagon…into the hands of the WhiteHats? [614] [text00029.html#_edn614] The big problem with this interpretation is that, if correct, the Deep Statewould have been more than happy to leak this information concerning what theTrump administration had done to major media. The Deep State’s control over themass media would have ensured round the clock coverage of the scandal, whichwould have surely led to Trump’s impeachment.While insufficient on its own, this interpretation raised by Sather helps tounderstand some important background to the Hawaii missile alert. When combinedwith all the evidence offered so far about a real ballistic missile being sentand shot down while en route to Hawaii, another motivation crystalizes tofurther expose the most likely actor behind the attack – the Deep State/CIA.The Deep State was well aware that Trump had failed in his first attempt to getaccess to the NSA facility in Honolulu and feared that he would succeed on hisnext try. Sather pointed out that the files had all the incriminating evidenceof what the Deep State/CIA had been doing through its multiple assets, includingSnowden. The Deep State’s solution was to destroy the evidence. A nuclear attackon Honolulu would not only destroy all the accumulated NSA evidence that theDeep State needed to keep out of the hands of Trump’s White House, but it wouldalso serve as a pretext to instigate a Third World War.“Q” Pulls the Curtain on the Puppet Masters Controlling the False Flag Attacks The day after the Hawaii missile alert, Q’s post #538 included a warning aboutan upcoming week of false flag attacks by the Deep State: “BEWARE of MAJOR FALSEFLAG attempts this week”. [615] [text00029.html#_edn615] This implied that theHawaii incident was part of a series of false flag attacks and not a mere falsealarm as concluded by the official Hawaii State investigation. This post isparticularly significant given that it appeared only two days before what in alllikelihood was an attempted false flag attack against Japan.On Tuesday, January 16, 2018, a New York Times report referred to another nervejarring false alarm taking place, this time in Japan where residents were warnedby a major TV broadcaster to take shelter from an incoming ballistic missile: Japan’s public broadcaster on Tuesday accidentally sent news alerts that NorthKorea had launched a missile and that citizens should take shelter — just daysafter the government of Hawaii had sent a similar warning to its citizens. [616][text00029.html#_edn616] The false missile alert incident in Japan has many parallels to the one threedays earlier in Hawaii which was thwarted. Q’s January 14 post #538 establisheda link between the Japan and Hawaii missile alerts as false flag eventsattempted by the Deep State.Further support for this linkage comes from Pentagon sources as reported on byformer Forbes magazine bureau head for Japan, Benjamin Fulford, who describedwhat the Deep State/Cabal was trying to do with their false flag attacks: Our here-now Pentagon sources admit that “the Secret Space Program may have beenused to down nuke missiles aimed at Hawaii and Japan and to stop the cabal fromleaving earth.” [617] [text00029.html#_edn617] QAnon next alluded to the Hawaii and Japan ballistic missile alerts on February11, 2018, in a long post (#725) referring to a recent false flag missile attackintended to start a war with North Korea. A section of this post appears below: Ask yourself, do we want a WAR?Ask yourself, who is trying to start a WAR?Ask yourself, if a missile was launched by rogue actors, what would be thepurpose?Ask yourself, what would/should immediately start a WAR? Ask yourself, would the PUBLIC understand the following statement: \"Rogue actors(Clowns/US former heads of State) initiated a missile launch in order to 'force'the US into a WAR/conflict against X?\"Be the autists we know you are.…Q [618] [text00029.html#_edn618] It is worth examining QAnon’s questions in light of what has been presentedabout the Hawaii and Japan missile alerts, and an Executive Order issued byPresident Trump on December 21, 2017. QAnon wrote: “Ask yourself, who is tryingto start a war?” The answer is individuals and groups tied to the Deep State whowere directly targeted by the extraordinary Executive Order issued by Trump onDecember 21 declaring a national emergency and a freeze on the financial assetsof anyone involved in human rights abuses and corruption anywhere around theworld. [619] [text00029.html#_edn619] Individuals and groups responsible forhuman rights abuses and corruption in the U.S. and globally had the most to loseif their financial assets were frozen. A nuclear war escalating into a world warwould have neutralized Trump’s Executive Order.QAnon then wrote: “Ask yourself, if a missile was launched by rogue actors, whatwould be the purpose?” The purpose was to create a false flag attack where theblame would be pinned on a credible state capable of launching a ballisticmissile that could hit Hawaii and Japan: North Korea. The “rogue actors” reallyresponsible for the attack had created a scenario where the US military would beforced to respond, thereby opening the door to rapid military escalation asother major nations intervened.QAnon next pointedly quizzes: “Ask yourself, what would/should immediately starta WAR?” We know from World War II history that the December 7, 1941, surpriseattack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, home of the US Pacific Fleet was the catalystfor America entering the war. The next day, the US Congress overwhelmingly votedto declare war on the Empire of Japan. QAnon is telling us here that asuccessful nuclear missile attack on Pearl Harbor would have triggered a similarwar declaration by Congress against the alleged perpetrator – North Korea.Were the “rogue actors” behind the attacks also hoping that even an unsuccessfulnuclear missile attack in the event the missile was shot down would trigger war?This possibility arises from what the anonymous Fusion Analyst serviceman atHickham Air Force Base said happened after the missile was shot down. Mostsignificantly, the analyst claims s/he overheard a Federal Investigator and aHawaii state official say Trump’s refusal to order a retaliation “Demonstratedweakness in the Trump administration and a refusal to protect the people”. [620][text00029.html#_edn620] Clearly, several actors involved in the Hawaiiballistic missile alert were trying to manipulate the Trump administration andUS Pacific Command.QAnon’s next question is very important for identifying who was behind themissile attacks against Hawaii and Japan: Ask yourself “would the PUBLIC understand the following statement: Rogue actors(Clowns/US former heads of State) initiated a missile launch in order to ‘force’the US into a WAR/conflict against X?” In QAnon posts, the CIA is referred to as “Clowns in Action”, and formerPresidents Bush (Snr), Clinton and Obama have been categorized as Deep State/CIAassets. Thus, in post #725, “Clowns” is QAnon’s codeword for the CIA. In aJanuary 20, 2018, article published online at exopolitics.org, I provideddocumentary evidence supporting insider claims that the CIA’s clandestineservices division had created a shadowy naval fleet with its own ballisticmissile carrying submarines, aircraft, and even an aircraft carrier battlegroup, which altogether comprise a secret “Dark Fleet”. [621][text00029.html#_edn621] Therefore, QAnon was suggesting that a CIA-controlledsubmarine was directly involved in staging a false flag attack against Hawaiiand Japan using nuclear missiles. This finally brings me to the role played bythe USAF SSP in shooting down the Deep State/CIA ballistic missile.USAF Space-Based Weapons PlatformInitial speculation concerning who was responsible for intercepting theballistic missile targeting Hawaii on January 13 focused on an anti-ballisticmissile defense system run by the US Navy. Only five months earlier, the Navyhad successfully intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile target in a testoff Hawaii that was launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on theisland of Kauai. [622] [text00029.html#_edn622] This test followed a similarfailed test that had been launched from the same facility in June 2017. Then, onJanuary 30, 2018, the Navy announced that it had conducted another exercise inHawaii to intercept a ballistic missile using its Aegis class anti-ballisticmissile defense technology, which once again failed. [623][text00029.html#_edn623] Since the exercise marked the second failure by theNavy to intercept a ballistic missile attack in the past year, the Navy’santiballistic missile defense was shown to be unreliable. Given that theexercise was conducted less than three weeks after the January 13 incident, itis clear that the Navy did not currently have the capacity for reliablyintercepting ballistic missiles. The announcement of the failed exercise so soonafter the Hawaii attack raises an intriguing question. Were Naval leaderssignaling they were not responsible for shooting down the January 13 missile? Ifso, then who did shoot down the rogue missile? [Image00076.jpg]Figure 70. Comparison of Aegis and other defense systems. Source: MissileDefense Agency On January 17, 2018, I published an article on the Hawaii missile attack focusedon the likelihood that an SSP run by the US Air Force had used space-basedweapons technologies to shoot down the ballistic missile. [624][text00029.html#_edn624] Photos taken on October 23, 2017, showed arectangular-shaped UFO in the vicinity of MacDill AFB in Tampa, Florida. Thephotographer JP claims he had been taken inside the rectangular-shaped UFO andinformed that it was a weapons platform. [625] [text00029.html#_edn625] Further,JP states that he witnessed uniformed military personnel wearing the insignia ofAir Force Special Ops who were aboard to operate the weapons platform.It is highly probable that the kind of weapons in use on the platform weredirectly linked to the technology of the MASER satellites used by the Deep Statein steering Hurricane Irma. Importantly, these microwave technologies arecapable of being used for both offensive and defensive military purposes. Theexistence of the large rectangular USAF SSP space-based advanced weaponsplatforms, likely including MASER technologies, has incredible implications. A“Directed Energy Weapon” system placed on a space-based weapons platform wouldhave the capacity to reliably shoot down any ballistic missile, and thwart DeepState efforts such as those intended to simulate an attack from North Korea.Unlike the “anti-missile” missiles used in the Navy’s Aegis defense system whichhave failed twice in tests against simulated ballistic missile attacks, aDirected Energy Weapon could send a pulse of laser energy at the speed of light.Therefore, a Directed Energy Weapon could easily intercept a ballistic missilein the terminal or re-entry stage of its flight trajectory when it travels athypersonic speeds (5x speed of sound).What gives further credence to the possibility that Maui residents and touristswitnessed a missile being shot down by a space-based Directed Energy Weapon isthe USAF surveillance installation on the summit of Haleakala, Maui. Thecapabilities of the Maui Space Surveillance Site (MSSS) is described byGlobalSecurity.org as follows: The Maui Space Surveillance Site (MSSS) includes the Air Force Maui OpticalStation (AMOS) is an asset of the US Air Force Materiel Command’s PhillipsLaboratory, the Maui Optical Tracking and Identification Facility (MOTIF), and aGround-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) site operated byUS Air Force Space Command….The site is the only one of its kind in the world, combining operationalsatellite tracking facilities (MOTIF and GEODSS) with a research and developmentfacility (AMOS). The MSSS operates primarily at night, but performs many of itsSOI missions 24 hours a day. [626] [text00029.html#_edn626] It is very likely that the Maui Space Surveillance Site was used in the trackingand shooting down of the ballistic missile launched against Hawaii. This wouldhelp explain why the television broadcasts included the information: “A missilemay impact on land or sea within minutes”. The incoming missile was beingtracked at the time by the MSSS. If indeed so, this would further confirm whymany Maui residents, in particular, saw the explosion. It was only during thefinal stage in the trajectory of the attacking missile that a Directed EnergyWeapon could have been used, and the Maui facility likely helped to triangulatethe missile’s position accurately.Did the USAF Receive Help from Nordic Extraterrestrials in Shooting Down theMissile? There are alternative scenarios to be considered because of what appearedonscreen during a live CNN broadcast covering the false alarm in Hawaii. Viewerstook photos of their screens during the coverage which displayed several UFOsover Hawaii thirty-one minutes after the second emergency alert had been issued.One photo and a close-up presented here shows five UFOs with at least oneexposing an advanced technology in the form of a circular pulse, or plasma ring,similar to the one made by a TR-3B antigravity craft (see Figure 71). This makesit possible that these craft belonged to the USAF SSP that had broken away fromDeep State control. Another explanation is the craft are extraterrestrial inorigin and are following a decades-long policy held by the Nordics – secretlyintervening in human affairs to forestall nuclear weapons incidents. This iswhat the person who provided the photos and their genesis, Solaris Modalis,contends.

Screenshot of UFO’s seen during live CNN broadcast from Hawaii.Courtesy of Solaris Modalis The evidence of UFOs, whether they are craft belonging to a USAF SSP orextraterrestrial in origin, is very significant given the newly formed alliancebetween the Nordics and the USAF SSP. It is very likely that the Nordicscoordinated with the USAF SSP in thwarting the intended false flag attacksagainst Hawaii, and soon after, Japan. Indeed, this UFO incident may offer thekey to how the incoming ballistic missile was shot down.It’s highly possible that the Deep State responded to the defection of the USAFby launching a nuclear weapons attack against Hawaii, which hosts the largestconcentration of US military assets anywhere in the world. After the failedattempt against Hawaii, another attempt may have occurred with Japan if Q andother sources are to be believed. In the end, the evidence presented suggests ahigh likelihood that the attacks were thwarted, and the culprits taken out byadvanced weapons and craft belonging to or affiliated with the USAF SSP, whichironically, the Deep State played a hand in creating.Conclusion In contrast to the official State of Hawaii report on the January 13, 2018incident, many other alternative conclusions can be drawn. * First, a ballistic missile likely carrying a nuclear warhead was destroyed during the final stage of its trajectory by the USAF SSP using a space-based “Directed Energy Weapon” deployed from a rectangular-shaped weapons platform, and/or satellite. * Second, the Maui Space Surveillance Site helped in the tracking and destruction of the ballistic missile as it neared the Hawaiian Islands to ensure it would not reach its most likely target – Pearl Harbor, Honolulu. * Third, the drill scheduled for the morning of January 13 was intended to create confusion so that the real ballistic missile “false flag” attack could succeed, and the missile’s trajectory would point to North Korea as the culprit. * Fourth, the party responsible for the false flag attack is a rogue Deep State/CIA group with its own ballistic submarines, which are part of a secret naval force called the “Dark Fleet”. * Finally, the US Navy’s January 31 anti-ballistic missile test was intended to let the general public know that its Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai did not yet have the capability to intercept ballistic missiles reliably, thus steering attention away to look for the real heroes in tracking and intercepting the nuclear attack on Hawaii – USAF Special Operations. Further information is needed to determine the accuracy of these conclusions.However, one thing is pretty clear at this point given the number of insidersources and witnesses that have come forward so far. The official State ofHawaii investigation is a cover-up for a ballistic missile attack, whichevidence suggests was a false flag attack using one or more nuclear weapons by amysterious naval force desiring to start a regional nuclear war. Thankfully,this did not occur. A classified space-based weapons system was most likelyemployed by USAF Special Operations, thereby giving US national securityplanners time to develop an appropriate response to those behind the false flagattack on Hawaii, and the one that followed only three days later in what mayhave been a similar attack on Japan. The possible involvement of a USAF SSP,acting alone or with extraterrestrial assistance in thwarting false flag attacksagainst Hawaii and Japan, provides confidence that future false flag attacksusing conventional military technologies are unlikely to succeed."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 21Space Force Opens the Door for USAF SSP Disclosure Good courage in a bad affair is half of the evil overcome.–Titus Maccius PlautusPresident Trump Proposes Space Force as New Branch of US MilitaryO n June 18, 2018, President Donald Trump gave a speech in which he recognizedspace as a “war-fighting domain” and called for the development of a UnitedStates Space Force (USSF) which will take over the current space functions ofthe US Air Force and other military services. The proposed Space Force is tobecome the sixth branch of the US military and will be placed under theadministrative control of the Department of the Air Force, which is said topossess approximately 80% of all the US military space assets. [628][text00029.html#_edn628] At the National Space Council meeting held at the WhiteHouse, Trump said : We must have American dominance in space… I’m hereby directing the Department ofDefense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish aSpace Force as the sixth branch of the armed forces…. We are going to have theAir Force, and we are going to have the Space Force. Separate, but equal. It isgoing to be something so important. [629] [text00029.html#_edn629] Trump then commanded General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff, to “carry that assignment out.” [630] [text00029.html#_edn630]Trump’s stance appeared to be at odds with previous statements made by the USAir Force Secretary, Air Force Chief of Staff, and Secretary of Defense JamesMattis, who all came out in opposition to a similar proposal by Republicanmembers of Congress in early 2017 to establish a Space Corps. [631][text00029.html#_edn631] On October 17, 2017, Mattis wrote in a letter to theSenate’s Defense Committee explaining his opposition: I oppose the creation of a new military service and additional organizationallayers at a time when we are focused on reducing overhead and integrating jointwarfighting efforts. [632] [text00029.html#_edn632] Even Trump’s White House was opposed to the creation of a “Space Corps”, sayingback in July 2017 that it was “premature at this time.” [633][text00029.html#_edn633] Yet by March 13, 2018, Trump had reversed himself andsaid in a speech at the USMC Air Station Miramar, San Diego: My new national strategy for space recognizes that space is a war-fightingdomain, just like the land, air, and sea. We may even have a Space Force. Wehave the Air Force. We’ll have the Space Force. We have the Army, the Navy.[634] [text00029.html#_edn634] Something had apparently changed in the time between the emergence of theCongressional initiative in early 2017 and President Trump’s surprising speechon March 13, 2018, during which he proclaimed with rallying confidence that thecreation of a “Space Force” was a good idea. In fact, in his speech, Trumpreferred to off-handedly suggesting the “Space Force idea” himself in adiscussion that took place at the White House, which then led to its seriousconsideration. This means the people in his circle of advisors concluded thatSpace Force would serve Trump’s administration and USAF interests.Clearly there is more to this story, and the dramatic change came about morelikely due to USAF SSP leaders realizing over this period the full extent of thedeception conducted by the Deep State. Not only did the Deep State hide thetruth of its own and other space programs, but it also concealed the role majoraerospace corporations had played in making all this possible through an almostimpenetrable compartmentalization process implemented for “Deep Black” aerospaceprojects. Also, Trump and USAF SSP leaders were well aware of the Deep State’suse of Maser satellites and other weather modification technologies used insteering Hurricane Irma towards MacDill AFB in September 2017; and the DeepState’s nefarious role in the Hawaii ballistic missile attack on January 13,2018.Critically, however, the full extent of the space assets belonging to the DeepState and its Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate (ICC) partners was notknown. Something had to be done to assert US military authority over these rogueelements to eliminate future threats by the Deep State and its AntarcticGerman/Draconian/Corporate allies. Consequently, the advantages of creating a“Space Force” escalated. Now seen with new eyes, it represented a means ofallowing the USAF to assert authority over all US military-related activities inspace by coordinating all of these under one authority. This alone could lead tothe elimination of the decentralized compartmentalized system that had evolvedover decades in the Military-Industrial Complex, which had greatly benefited theAntarctic Germans’ “Dark Fleet” and led to the creation of the ICC that remainedclosely tied to the Deep State.USAF officials and Secretary of Defense James Mattis quickly re-alignedthemselves with Trump’s June 18, 2018, order to actualize his Space Forcevision. [635] [text00029.html#_edn635] While Trump did not have the executiveauthority to create a new military service, since only the US Congress possessesthe power to do so, he did have the authority to order the Pentagon to develop acomprehensive plan for the creation of such a service. [636][text00029.html#_edn636] Thus, Mattis and the Pentagon launched into puttingtogether an all-encompassing plan for the creation of a Space Force, which nowimportantly carried the backing of the President and military leaders for itsupcoming submission to Congress. Department of Defense Report for the Creation of a Space Force On August 9, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) released a final report tothe Congressional Defense Committees outlining the steps to be taken inimplementing Trump’s proposal. The “Final Report on Organizational andManagement Structure for the National Security Space Components of theDepartment of Defense” identified two main phases for developing the Space Forcethrough its four constituent components: Establishing the Space Force will be multi-dimensional and phased. In this firstphase, using existing authorities, the Department of Defense will establishseveral of the component parts of the Space Force. The second phase requiresCongress to combine these components into the sixth branch of the Armed Forces.The Department of Defense is immediately pursuing four components: * Space Development Agency – capabilities development and fielding, * Space Operations Force – developing space leaders and joint space warfighters, * Services and Support – leadership and support structures, and * Space Command – developing Space Force warfighting operations to protect U.S. national interests. [637] [text00029.html#_edn637] The first component, a “Space Development Agency”, looms as a dramatic breakfrom past practices in which the Pentagon largely relied upon corporations forbuilding their new generations of aerospace vehicles and weapons. The FinalReport states that the proposed Agency will: * Identify opportunities to move from dependence on a few independent assets to a proliferated architecture enabled by lower-cost commercial space technology and access, * Shift from an acquisition organization and mindset to a development organization focused on experimentation, prototyping, and accelerated fielding, and * Change from a matrixed and overlapping structure to a concentrated and decoupled structure to generate speed. [638] [text00029.html#_edn638] In moving from “an acquisition organization and mindset” to a “developmentorganization”, Space Force will essentially assert its authority over corporatecontractors building advanced spacecraft components. The ground shaking resultwill be that corporations can no longer get away with secretly buildingcomponents for other space programs without informing the Air Force. The SpaceDevelopment Agency will enable the Air Force to assert its primacy through SpaceForce over the development of future space technologies with militaryapplications.According to the Final Report, the second component of Space Force, the “SpaceOperations Force”, will: * Include the space personnel from all Military Services, including Guard, Reserve, and civilians, * Create a clear career track for the space community containing all relevant space specialties including operations, intelligence, engineering, science, acquisition, cyber, etc., and * Be overseen by U.S. Space Command with civilian oversight from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, while personnel remain in the Services, until the establishment of the Space Force. [639] [text00029.html#_edn639] The establishment of a Space Operations Force will make it very difficult, ifnot impossible, for rival space programs led by the Antarctic Germans, DeepState and corporations to secretly recruit US military personnel and civilians.It will establish “space specialties” that allow for career advancement, therebyeliminating the need for practices such as the “20 and back” programs describedby whistleblowers such as Corey Goode, Michael Relfe, and Michael Gerloff. [640][text00029.html#_edn640] These and other insiders have described how mindcontrol and advanced technologies were used to wipe their minds of all memoriesof their covert space service. They explained how they were age-regressed andreturned back in time to when they began their service, without the skills andbenefits they had acquired, which subsequently led to them struggling withpost-traumatic stress due to the suppressed memories.The fourth component of Space Force involves the establishment of a “SpaceCommand”, which the Final Report also describes in detail: To further accelerate warfighting capability, the Department recommends creatinga new U.S. Space Command to become a unified combatant command. U.S. SpaceCommand will be responsible for preparing for and deterring conflict in spaceand leading U.S. forces in that fight if it should happen. U.S. Space Command will: * Lead U.S. warfighting activities in space and establish unity of command for operational space forces, * Integrate space planning and operations across military campaigns and contingency plans, * Simplify the command structure by aligning operational forces to the commander responsible for joint space warfighting, * Develop space doctrine, concepts of operation and space tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), * Establish enterprise space standards to be adopted by the Military Services, ensuring interoperability of the joint force, and * Utilize commercial practices and digitization to streamline the footprint and automate labor-intensive operations. [641] [text00029.html#_edn641] The key benefit in creating a Space Command is that this one institution willhave operational oversight for all US military space activities, includingcontrol over the corporations that have developed advanced space technologieswith military applications. This institution’s powers will make it verydifficult, if not impossible, for space asset technologies created within andfor the different military services to be secretly siphoned off into blackprojects run by the Deep State, corporations, and the Antarctic Germans, withoutthe knowledge of the USAF SSP.On December 18, 2018, this vital component of Trump’s future Space Force movedforward with a Presidential Memorandum authorizing the creation of a UnitedStates Space Command: Pursuant to my authority as the Commander in Chief and under section 161 oftitle 10, United States Code, and in consultation with the Secretary of Defenseand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I direct the establishment,consistent with United States law, of United States Space Command as afunctional Unified Combatant Command. I also direct the Secretary of Defense torecommend officers for my nomination and Senate confirmation as Commander andDeputy Commander of the new United States Space Command.I assign to United States Space Command: (1) all the general responsibilities ofa Unified Combatant Command; (2) the space‑related responsibilities previouslyassigned to the Commander, United States Strategic Command; and (3) theresponsibilities of Joint Force Provider and Joint Force Trainer for SpaceOperations Forces. The comprehensive list of authorities and responsibilitiesfor United States Space Command will be included in the next update to theUnified Command Plan. [642] [text00029.html#_edn642] As the forerunner to the creation of a Space Force, Space Command will allow thenecessary integration of, and command over, space assets from all five militaryservices to take place after its Congressional approval. Most importantly, SpaceCommand will incorporate the USAF Space Command, which until now has beensubordinate to the Commander of US Strategic Command. It will also include USAFSpecial Operations, which provides personnel for the squadrons of antigravityspacecraft deployed in Earth-orbit and deep space, as shown in chapter 19.Eventually, after undergoing all the stages of Congressional approval, SpaceForce will rise up as a new military branch placed under the Department of theAir Force. This relationship will replicate the one held by the Marine Corps,which is an independent military service under the Department of the Navy.Nostalgically, it echoes the historical evolution of the Air Force itself whichfirst gained autonomy from the Army Air Force under General Hap Arnold duringWorld War II; then became a de facto separate military service under theadministrative control of the Army immediately after World War II; and soonafter culminated in the creation of the Department of the Air Force afterpassage of the September 1947 National Security Act.On February 19, 2019, President Trump released Space Policy Directive-4affirming that the creation of Space Force will be a two-step process. It willbe “initially established within the Department of the Air Force”, which isvital to gaining Congressional and Air Force support for its legislativepassage. [643] [text00029.html#_edn643] His directive only implies the next stepwill involve the creation of a wholly independent Department of the Space Forcein order to bypass any initial resistance to the second phase. What has beenleft unsaid in Trump’s Directive is that the second step is critical because itis the only way in which the Navy will agree to hand over authority for its deepspace battle groups, which have been operating since the early 1980’s.Basically, Space Force first being under the Department of the Air Force willaggregate all military space assets deployed in near-Earth orbit. After thecreation of an independent Department of the Space Force, the Navy will berequired to relinquish control of its deep space assets and place these underthe authority of the new department.Space Force, Q Anon, and Secret Space Program Disclosure A major question that arises from President Trump’s Space Force initiative iswhether it will lead to the disclosure of not only the USAF SSP but theexistence of other space programs and extraterrestrial life in its many forms.It’s important to emphasize that the idea for a Space Force emerged in WhiteHouses discussions that took place in early March 2018, just before Trump’sMarch 13 speech at the USMC Miramar Air Station. A clue into what Trump’smilitary advisors have told him about disclosure comes from QAnon (‘Q”), thealleged group of military intelligence officials advising Trump on the beststrategy for overcoming the Deep State.On September 19, 2018, Q dropped two bombshell posts affirming the existence ofsecret space programs and extraterrestrial life, thus providing insights intowhat the Trump administration is planning to disclose in the future. In thefirst post (#2222), Q responded to two questions about whether extraterrestriallife exists and whether the Roswell UFO crash really happened: Q !!mG7VJxZNCI ID: 98088e No. 3094236[https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/3093640.html#3094236]Sep 19 2018 19:25:34 (EST) [https://qanon.pub/#t1537403134]Anonymous ID: 5948d8 No. 3093831[https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/3093640.html#3093831]Sep 19 2018 19:10:44 (EST) [https://qanon.pub/#t1537402244]QAre we alone ?Roswell ?>>3093831No.Highest classification.Consider the vastness of space.Q [644] [text00029.html#_edn644] Q’s response makes clear that we are not alone and that the truth about theRoswell flying saucer crash has the “highest classification”. This response issignificant since it affirms what a senior official with the CanadianGovernment’s Department of Communications, named Wilbert Smith, reported back in1950 after he had inquired about the Roswell crash among senior US governmentscientists. Smith’s official report was eventually released through the Freedomof Information Act: “The matter is the most highly classified subject in theUnited States government, rating higher even than the H-bomb .” [645][text00029.html#_edn645]In the second bombshell post (#2225) on the same day, Q responded to questionsabout the Moon and secret space programs: Q !!mG7VJxZNCI ID: 922952 No. 3095105[https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/3094196.html#3095105]Sep 19 2018 19:58:13 (EST) [https://qanon.pub/#t1537405093]Anonymous ID: a16b71 No. 3094804[https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/3094196.html#3094804]Sep 19 2018 19:45:34 (EST) [https://qanon.pub/#t1537404334]Q,Did NASA fake the moon landings? Have we been to the moon since then? Are theresecret space programs? Is this why the Space Force was created?>>3094804False, moon landings are real.Programs exist that are outside of public domain.Q [646] [text00029.html#_edn646] In stating that the “moon landings are real”, Q is refuting conspiracy theoriesthat the Moon landings were hoaxed. This removes an impediment for the generalpublic learning the truth about what has really been happening on the Moon afterthe Apollo Moon landings.In the next statement, Q affirms the existence of space programs that “areoutside of public domain”. This means that Q wants readers to understand thatthe information on these “non-public domain” space programs is highly classifiedand restricted to those with need-to-know access. While Q did not explicitlyrefer to Trump’s Space Force initiative, it is more than coincidental that theposts appeared only one month before the Pentagon released its “Final Report” tothe Congressional Defense Committee on establishing the Space Force. [647][text00029.html#_edn647] It can be inferred from Q’s reply that informationabout the existence of secret space programs has been shared with Trump. Evenmore importantly, the fact that Q chose to answer these questions from a longlist suggests that a disclosure agenda exists within the Trump White House. Disclosure of USAF Secret Space Program and Nordic Alliance Ever since the creation of the US Air Force in 1947, its senior leaders havegrappled with the question of how to deal with visiting extraterrestrial lifeand the existence of a German secret space program in Antarctica that is alliedwith the most aggressive of Earth’s space visitors, the Draconian Reptilians.After both the US Navy and US Air Force failed in their respective efforts (from1947 to 1952) to contain the threats posed by the Antarctic Germans throughdirect military confrontation, a strategy of negotiation and cooperation wastaken to unlock the secrets of interstellar space travel.Contrary to the approach taken by the US Navy, which closely cooperated with agroup of human-looking Nordic extraterrestrials, the USAF worked closely withthe Antarctic Germans and their Reptilian allies. [648] [text00029.html#_edn648]The USAF would also work with other extraterrestrials groups such as Grays, TallWhites, and another human-looking group in understanding the advanced spacecraftthey had in their possession. Progress was slow, but over succeeding decades,the USAF was able to assemble an impressive collection of space propulsiontechnologies that enabled it to travel into Earth-orbit and eventuallythroughout our solar system. At least three different sized saucer-shaped “AlienReproduction Vehicles”; at least three different sized TR-3B-like“triangular-shaped craft”; “rectangular-shaped weapons platforms”; and “stealthspace stations” make up the crown jewels of the USAF SSP. The USAF evenpossesses traversable wormhole technologies that enabled its airmen to exploredifferent solar systems. This technology was notably revealed in a softdisclosure initiative sanctioned by two Air Force Chiefs of Staff – the StargateSG-1 science fiction series.In its mission to confront any potential planetary threats, the USAF stoodproudly and confidently in its belief that it was the proverbial “tip of thespear”, that is until it learned differently in late 2016. It was the remarkabletestimonies of Corey Goode and other insiders which led USAF SSP leaders toseriously investigate the claims of the existence of other secret spaceprograms. Such information first became public back in 2000 with Michael Relfe’sgroundbreaking testimony of serving for twenty years on Mars. [649][text00029.html#_edn649] The investigation led to the stunning discovery thatthe USAF SSP was very far from being the tip of the spear when it came toadvanced space technologies for confronting potential planetary threats. TheUSAF found out it had been completely deceived by the Deep State, the AntarcticGermans and its extraterrestrial allies, who had only helped the Air Force todevelop and deploy redundant space technologies that were decades behind thosein use by other space programs at the time.The USAF’s institutional humiliation only increased when it was confirmed thatthe US Navy had developed interstellar-capable “space battle groups” thatpatrolled the entire solar system, and that the Navy also worked closely with agroup of Nordics that the USAF leaders had been deceived into believing were athreat. Indeed, the USAF had worked with the Antarctic Germans and Deep Stateoperatives to intercept, interrogate, and torture many human-lookingextraterrestrials that were found on Earth, perhaps even some that had helpedthe Navy develop its more advanced space program.After uncovering the full extent of the web of misinformation and falsehoodsthat had corrupted its mission and usurped its technological growth, the USAFmade the momentous decision to realign its fundamental extraterrestrialalliances. Like the Navy, the USAF would now also choose to work closely withhuman-looking extraterrestrials willing to assist in its development of advancedspace technologies that could enable it to join in the galaxy-wide confrontationalready taking place with the Draconian Reptilian extraterrestrials. The DefenseIntelligence Agency’s “preliminary briefing” leaked by the USAF in June 2017 wasa sign of this strategic change because it revealed for the first time a moreaccurate account of historical events than anything previously leaked by the AirForce through the Majestic Documents. Most importantly, the leaked DIA documentstated that human-looking extraterrestrials were the friendliest of all of thespace visitors and proved reliable partners for diplomatic agreements.The June 2017 leaking of the DIA document was followed by USAF SpecialOperations covertly assisting a civilian to take photos of some of itsantigravity spacecraft operating out of MacDill AFB in Florida. Chapter 19covered in-depth JP’s photos and how these have provided hard evidence for hisclaims regarding being taken inside differently shaped USAF antigravityspacecraft: both “flying triangles” and “flying rectangles”. He even took photosof a craft belonging to one of the Nordics who said his people were helping theUSAF to develop more advanced technologies and weapons for its secret spaceprogram.This strategic realignment of extraterrestrial allies had required someimportant policy changes taking place within the highest levels of the USAF SSP.Among the most important was helping U.S. and global society to break free ofthe corrupting influence of the Deep State, and its AntarcticGerman/Reptilian/corporate allies. It’s no accident that similar scenarios havetaken place on many other worlds where the Draconians have successfullyestablished a foothold, and where the Nordics have stepped in to help theseworlds break free of similar corrupting influences.The dramatic change in USAF policy by September 2017 led to the Deep State’squick retaliation. Using its Maser satellite systems, the Deep State targetedMacDill AFB by steering Hurricane Irma directly towards its Tampa home. It’s notcoincidental that Irma made landfall near MacDill on September 11, 2017, the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, or that the hurricane was named after aGermanic goddess of war. This event was a covert declaration of war by the DeepState against the USAF SSP, and it also held a dark warning for any otherfacility that would be used to promote a disclosure process.Four months later, when the Deep State attempted a false flag attack in Hawaiion January 13, 2018, in order to trigger a Third World War, the USAF and theirnew Nordic allies were ready. The ballistic missile launched from aCIA-controlled submarine positioned near North Korea was destroyed inmid-flight. This was followed three days later by a similar false flag eventhappening in Japan, suggesting that once again the USAF SSP had intervened. Itwould be ironic if one day it emerged that some of the same Maser satellitesused to steer Hurricane Irma were used to shoot down the ballistic missileslaunched against Hawaii and Japan. QAnon has raised such a possibility. Posts byQ have described the process by which the Deep State’s misuse of satellitetechnologies have provided the justification for these space assets to be takenover by the US military. [650] [text00029.html#_edn650] In the end, the DeepState has failed miserably. USAF leaders are now working closely with the Trumpadministration to eliminate the power of the Deep State through the creation ofSpace Force. Official Disclosure through Space Force By ordering the creation of Space Force, Trump is now soundly shaking thebureaucratic and corporate trees that hide multiple space programs that havebeen secretly built and supplied by US corporations, both for differentcustomers within the Military-Industrial Complex and the Antarctic Germans.Large aerospace companies such as Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Raytheon,General Dynamics, etc., have for decades supplied the technologies andcomponents for the Air Force SSP while hiding their involvement in similarlysupplying other space programs. For decades, the USAF had little to no awarenessof these other SSPs due to the compartmentalization process and cunning liestold to them about spacecraft belonging to the other space programs in deepspace. Consequently, the Deep State has played a major role in setting spacepolicy due to its longstanding ability to manipulate Air Force officials throughthe supply and acquisition process facilitating the multiple space programs.Trump’s proposed Space Force will finally enable the USAF to remedy suchproblems, thereby allowing the USAF to work with Navy SSP leaders incoordinating their respective space assets and move forward in a future officialdisclosure process.In earlier chapters, I’ve described the Air Force’s “limited disclosure” plan toreveal the existence of two or more orbiting space stations along withantigravity flying triangles (TR-3Bs) and other exotic spacecraft built bycomplicit aerospace companies. Tom DeLonge’s To the Stars Academy started as aUSAF-backed disclosure initiative, but it was abandoned after Air Force leaderslearned of the Deep State’s deception and recognized that the initiative hadbeen compromised. Also, once these same leaders had learned of the Navy’s morehighly classified and advanced SSP by confirming Corey Goode’s testimony andclaims by other SSP whistleblowers, a change of strategy became necessary.The USAF’s discovery that the Navy had its own SSP with advanced spacetechnologies which had been secretly built by various corporations, and thatother space programs existed with the Antarctic Germans (Dark Fleet) and theDeep State/Corporations (the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate), caused AirForce leaders to appreciate the need to eliminate their dispersed development,acquisition, and recruitment systems. These administrative systems had made allof this deception possible. Therefore, modifying them became a major factor inthe USAF and Pentagon officials’ decision to reassess and approve the SpaceForce initiative after strong initial resistance, based on decades ofdisinformation. The degree of cooperation required by Air Force and Navy leadersto make Space Force successful will be tremendous. This fact begs the questionof whether these two highly competitive military giants will publicly disclosethe advanced aerospace technologies employed in their respective secret spaceprograms, and cooperatively merge their programs under the new Space Forcemilitary service branch.It is very likely that the advanced space technologies possessed by the USAF SSPwill be the first to go public. These can be most easily disclosed since thereis already public awareness of their existence due to of multiplewhistleblowers, insiders, and witness reports on the existence of saucer-shapedcraft (ARVs), triangular-shaped vehicles (TR-3Bs), rectangular-shaped platformsand stealth space stations. The emergence of Space Force will enable thesurfacing of the myriad “deep black” technologies which have been funded by theDeep State and CIA through multiple corrupt practices. Exposure of the DeepState and CIA’s complicity in international corruption and human rights abuses –used to raises billions of dollars toward a black budget estimated to exceed onetrillion dollars annually – will forever end these illicit funding mechanisms.[651] [text00029.html#_edn651] Consequently, Space Force will have to be fundedthrough more conventional sources such as Congressional appropriations. And inturn, the public will have to be persuaded to accept the wisdom of a dramaticbudget increase for the Pentagon so it can match the funding levels attained bythe Deep State through its illicit activities.However, a much more dramatic disclosure event will be the revelation of therole of visiting Nordic extraterrestrials who have been helping the USAF advanceits secret space program. It is very likely that the USAF SSP will reveal itsrelationship with the Nordics as part of its disclosure process. The firstconcrete sign of this took place with the June 2017 leaking of the 1989 DefenseIntelligence Agency preliminary briefing document discussing human-lookingextraterrestrials. By now it should be clear to readers that the DIA, NRO, andNSA are important partners in the USAF SSP. The DIA document is already publiclyavailable and will only gain widespread attention as others authenticate keyelements in it, as Dr. Robert Wood did in December 2018. [652][text00029.html#_edn652]The revelation of a secret space program having been developed by the USAF isbig news by itself. However, adding that this was achieved with the assistanceof human-looking Nordic extraterrestrials will come as a great shock to many.There are some who might question whether or not the public is ready for suchdramatic announcements and if this would cause a societal collapse as warned inthe 1961 Brookings Report. [653] [text00029.html#_edn653] It is highly unlikelysuch a collapse will occur since the public has been thoroughly acclimated toaccept the existence of extraterrestrial life. Therefore, an announcement thatsuch visitors have proved themselves friendly and are helping our world todevelop advanced space technologies should be welcomed by many. Indeed, there isreason to believe that the growing QAnon movement may be destined to play aprominent role in such a disclosure process and that more Q posts can beexpected to discuss secret space programs and extraterrestrial life.When is official disclosure of a USAF SSP and the existence of Nordicextraterrestrials likely to occur? One date to keep in mind is the formal launchof the US Space Force sometime in 2020, or soon thereafter. In the interim, thenewly launched US Space Command is likely to figure prominently in any officialdisclosure process. The disclosure of the USAF SSP, its absorption into SpaceCommand and then Space Force, and disclosure of Nordic visitors willrevolutionize our planet in many ways. This will even escalate once the Navy’sSSP becomes part of the disclosure process and eventually merges its deep spaceassets within the proposed Space Force, which will only occur after the newlycreated military service moves from under the administrative control of theDepartment of the Air Force to become a fully independent Department of theSpace Force. There will be great technological, economic, political, andcultural changes that will occur in a short period. The elimination of the DeepState and its countless corrupting practices used in secretly funding multiplesecret space programs will be profound.In the decade ahead, humanity will increasingly need to confront destructiveplanet-wide events that are predicted to involve an impending solar flash (akamicronova), [654] [text00029.html#_edn654] a geophysical pole shift, andpotential asteroid impacts. [655] [text00029.html#_edn655] The need fordisclosing the existence of advanced technologies will not only result in makingspace travel available for widespread commercial use; but, more importantly, itwill help countless individuals and communities to avoid such impendingdestructive events. Similarly, the release of suppressed health technologieswill help humanity to overcome the time-old enemies of disease and the agingprocess, and to mitigate the effects of the coming planetary challengesconsiderably. Finally, when these technological revelations are combined withthe disclosure of human-looking extraterrestrials, to whom we are geneticallyrelated, humanity will collectively shift into a Star Trek -like future wherespace flight to distant star systems will become as commonplace asintercontinental air travel."},{"pageContent":"Acknowledgements I am grateful to a great number of insiders, whistleblowers, researchers, andexperiencers who made this book possible because of their pioneering efforts inunraveling the many layers comprising the US Air Force’s historic research anddevelopment of extraterrestrial technologies.
