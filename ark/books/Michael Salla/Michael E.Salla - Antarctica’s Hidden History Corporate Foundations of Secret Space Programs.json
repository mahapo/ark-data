My deep appreciation also goes to another insider, CoreyGoode, for the private briefings he gave me which expanded my understanding ofrecent developments in Antarctica. His personal experiences offered first-handaccounts of what lay buried deep under the ice sheets, making them invaluable.It was Bill and Corey’s respective testimonies that opened my eyes to thesignificance of Antarctica, and the importance of understanding the historicalevolution of secret space programs, along with the German and U.S. corporatecollaboration that made these developments possible.I also owe a debt of gratitude to David Wilcock for his Cosmic Disclosureinterviews with both Corey and Bill, providing invaluable details about ongoingevents in Antarctica. In addition, David’s interviews with Dr. Pete Petersonabout this man’s personal experiences in Antarctica were again very helpful inproviding further eyewitness corroboration for some of Corey and Bill’s claimsof what happened there.Thanks also to veteran UFO researcher, Linda Moulton Howe, for her interviewswith “Brian”, a former U.S. Navy flight engineer employed in Antarctic for 17years, who provided more valuable information about events there. I am verygrateful to Kathryn “Katie” Leishman, a veteran investigative reporter, for herassistance in tracking down and interviewing a number of individuals for thisbook who had previously worked in Antarctica, as well as members of aCongressional delegation who traveled there in 2002. Further, she found a formercolleague of “Brian” who confirmed that this whistleblower had indeed worked inAntarctica and was a very credible witness.My warm thanks go to Rene McCann for her generous gift of designing the book’scover which beautifully illustrates the secret agreements that underscore eventsin Antarctica. Additionally, I am grateful to Gaia TV (Gaia.com) for permissionto use graphics that first appeared in Cosmic Disclosure. My appreciation alsoextends to Thomas Keller for permission to use his excellent summary graphic ofCorey Goode's claims of multiple secret space programs.I am thankful to Rene Erik Olsen for permission to use several enhancedphotographs taken by George Adamski of his famed 1952 Desert Center encounterwith a scout craft and its occupant, Orthon. Thanks likewise to Michel Zirgerwhose research on the Adamski case first alerted me to Olsen’s enhancements.Much appreciation goes to A. Hughes for copy editing the final manuscript, andonce again assisting in this Secret Space Program book series.Finally, I am deeply grateful to my wonderful wife and soul mate, AngelikaWhitecliff, who once again enthusiastically took on the indispensable role ofchief editor for this book. I am truly blessed to have found a life partner whosupports my writing and truth telling endeavors in every possible way, andbrings her own global transformation projects into my life. Michael E. Salla, Ph.D.March 12, 2018"},{"pageContent":"PREFACE A spotlight was cast on many previously unknown historical events by therevelations of William Tompkins, a brilliant young naval recruit who became acareer aerospace engineer. Among his notable list of disclosures was that the USNavy had established a top secret espionage program from 1942 to 1946, withapproximately 30 spies embedded within Nazi Germany’s top aerospace facilitiesand companies. He also reported that Nazi Germany had secretly developed up to30 prototype spacecraft using antigravity and other exotic propulsion systems.Having sat in on the debriefings of the spies in his capacity as “Disseminatorof Naval Research and Information”, Tompkins attests that many of theseprototypes were extraterrestrial in origin, and the most technologicallyadvanced were secretly being developed within hidden bases in Antarctica.Furthermore, he claims that the Nazis were helped by two different groups ofextraterrestrials in achieving numerous stunning technological breakthroughs intheir nascent aerospace industry, which was relocated early on to Antarctica.A yet untold story emerges with this book’s investigation of the role of Germancompanies and their U.S. partners in the funding and development of antigravityspacecraft in Nazi Germany. This involves some of the biggest companies inGermany, as well as major U.S. corporations who provided critical financialservices and technological assistance. Some of the U.S. corporate officialsdirectly involved in the funding and technological development in Germany roseto very senior positions within the U.S. political system after World War II.They include Allan Dulles, who became CIA Director (1953 – 1961); John FosterDulles, who ascended to the role of Secretary of State (1953-1959); and PrescottBush, who came to be a U.S. Senator (1952 to 1963), and is widely remembered asthe father and grandfather of two future U.S. Presidents who wouldenthusiastically continue the legacy of Prescott’s policies. Finally, we havethe Rockefeller brothers who provided important corporate support to NaziGermany, and became a prominent part of the Eisenhower administration throughNelson who filled various senior positions.These men, along with other U.S. corporate/government officials, are directlyimplicated in aiding the success of specific German companies both prior to andafter World War II, and gaining them the financial and international corporatesupport necessary for the building of a secret space program in Antarctica.Perhaps most alarming is that these prominent officials made it possible for apost-World War II agreement to be reached between the Eisenhower Administrationand a German breakaway group in Antarctica which came to establish the vision ofa Fourth Reich; whose power and influence extends to present day.All the resources and manpower of the U.S. military-industrial complex werehence made available for a significant expansion of the German space program,whereby it could become an interplanetary colonial power capable of deployingsignificant military resources outside of our solar system in support of theirextraterrestrial allies. Furthermore, it made possible the development of atransnational corporate space program, whose power and influence exceeded themilitary space programs established by the Navy and Air Force respectivelywithin the U.S.In the following chapters, I will detail and expose how German secret societiesand companies collaborated in building their first prototype spacecrafts, andhow these led to the fully operational and weaponized spacecraft in Antarctica.Key elements of this story include the Nazi capital flight that funded thesesecret technological developments even after the collapse of Hitler’s ThirdReich, and how the spacecraft from Antarctica first defeated a U.S. Navalexpedition sent out to find and destroy the German Antarctica bases in1946/1947, and later, in a stunning display of power flew over Washington, DC inJuly 1952 to intimidate the Truman administration into beginning secretnegotiations. A pivotal moment in history resulted with the agreement betweenthe subsequent Eisenhower administration and the Germans in Antarctica, thusheralding the emergence of the Fourth Reich as a global superpower that wouldremain unknown to the majority of the world’s population.I next follow the telling trail of the extensive use of slave labor that wasfirst adopted by the political leaders and corporations building the spaceprogram in Germany during WWII, which ostensibly continued in Antarctica. Thisegregious practice was then adopted by U.S. companies that partnered with theGermans in Antarctica to develop more advanced spacecraft, which in turn wouldbe used for deep space operations and to even establish colonies within thesolar system.The intriguing connection between the 1950’s Space Brothers phenomenon and theGerman Space Programs out of Antarctic will be examined in chapter seven.Importantly, President John F. Kennedy was aware of the U.S. agreement with theGerman Antarctica space colony. His attempt to assert direct Presidentialauthority over these secret agreements and the technologies they involved becamea direct factor leading to his assassination, which will be divulged in detailin chapter eight.Of the many German companies that helped build Nazi Germany’s secret spaceprogram(s), Siemens stands out as the most significant, as will be discussed inchapter nine. It was by far the most successful German company across a widespectrum of research and development projects related to multiple components ofantigravity spacecraft, and prototype craft. These spacecraft prototypes wereeventually redeployed to Antarctica, along with technologies from Siemens’subsidiaries and other German companies that had successfully built keycomponents for space faring vehicles. Based on its overall success in achievingadvanced breakthroughs, strategic business partnering and acquiring amplefunding, Siemens was able to play a leading role in coordinating Germancorporate construction of multiple spacecraft in Antarctica.Siemens was also implicated in managing the slave labor component of the GermanAntarctica program, thereby continuing the corporate policy that it hadestablished in Nazi Germany under the encouragement of the Nazi regime. Thiscontinued decades after World War II ended, and led to Siemens secretlymanufacturing billions of RFID tracking chips in the 1980’s to allegedly trackthe slave laborers used in their German-U.S. Corporate Space Program that bythen had established large operations in Antarctica, and also on the Moon, Marsand elsewhere in the solar system. In addition, Siemens and other corporationsworking in the German-U.S. corporate space program (aka, InterplanetaryCorporate Conglomerate), are linked to the abduction of humans used in agalactic slave trade with extraterrestrial civilizations. Remote and withperilous conditions, Antarctica would become a key outpost for this burgeoningslave trade.Chapter 10 identifies how the original German Space Program and thetransnational corporate space program it spawned are kept safely secret andsecure under the depths of Antarctic ice. Few scientists and visitors toAntarctica ever witness anything that makes them suspect what is reallyhappening under the massive frozen expanse. Those who do witness anomalousevents, such as Brian, a retired Navy aircraft engineer, are debriefed to neverreveal what they saw. Those brave enough to ignore such warnings and stepforward as whistleblowers, which Brian did, are then later threatened bystrangers to keep silent.In addition to the Antarctica revelations of William Tompkins, we also have thetestimony of Corey Goode, who says he served in a “20 and back” tour of duty inthe US Navy’s secret space program, Solar Warden. His claims of serving in SolarWarden, and having extensive contact with multiple groups of extraterrestrials,were extensively examined in the first volume of this Secret Space ProgramsSeries.[1] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn1] In order to assist the reader inunderstanding the different space programs that have allegedly been developedaccording to Goode, I’ve included a reference diagram developed by aerospaceengineer and former NASA employee, Thomas L. Keller, summarizing the testimonyof Goode. In order to better follow the information in this book when differentspace programs are discussed, I recommend readers refer to this diagram. [../images/00002.jpeg]Figure 1. Illustration of different Space Programs according to Corey Goode Goode says he was taken twice to Antarctica between January 2016 and early 2017– by an Inner Earth group he identifies as the Anshar. He has provided extensivetestimony about what he saw in terms of large industrial facilities hidden deepunder the ice shelves, where powerful fleets of spacecraft are based andassembled. If Goode’s testimony is reliable, as multiple sources of evidencesuggest, then we have the first eyewitness account of the transnationalcorporate space program currently operating in Antarctica.In addition, Goode says that he witnessed the remnants of an ancientcivilization being secretly excavated under the Antarctic ice. His descriptionof the “Pre-Adamites” discovered there, along with their highly developedtechnological society, is stunning in its implications for understanding ourancient human history. Chapter 12 also examines scientific data that showsAntarctica’s volcanoes waking up, and the potential this has to melt the iceshelves, revealing what lays hidden beneath. The connection of the Pre-Adamitesto different historical epochs in our solar system, and the role of Antarcticaas a refuge for escaping Martians and the inhabitants of a former Super Earthfrom the asteroid belt is laid out and scrutinized in chapter 13.The connection between Antarctica and the Fallen Angels described in the Book ofEnoch ensues and is analyzed in chapter 14. It will be shown how this apocryphalbook points to Antarctica as the location of their imprisonment. Most incredibleis Goode’s claim that some of these Pre-Adamites are still alive in stasischambers and that their bloodline descendants want to not only awaken them, butalso restore them to their previous positions of authority. Indeed, manyalarming questions are raised if only a portion of Goode’s claims are accurate.Next, the penultimate chapter examines secret military research and developmentthat has occurred in Antarctica, which has gone forward despite the 1961Antarctic Treaty proscribing such activities. Consequently, while Antarctica isostensibly a region governed by the Antarctic Treaty establishing ademilitarized zone for scientific exploration to benefit all humanity, it is infact a heavily militarized territory conducting many illegal research anddevelopment programs involving captive humans.This book exposes how human slavery continues to flourish in Antarctica and onoff-planet colonies run by the Fourth Reich and their transnational corporatepartners. If left undisturbed, this nexus of domination and slavery will spreadlike a virus over the rest of the planet with predictable results. It’s up toall that cherish human freedom and creativity to rise up, end this vilepractice, and expose the global elite that secretly enable it. Only fulldisclosure of Antarctica’s suppressed history and its current events will ensurethat all humanity benefits from the advanced technologies that have beensecretly developed and deployed there.Disclosure will furthermore help prepare humanity for major geological eventsthat lie ahead as west Antarctica’s ice shelves continue to melt due toincreased volcanic activity. The possibility that this not only causes adramatic rise in sea levels, but also precipitates a geographical Pole Shift issomething well worth considering. A global transformation awaits us if we havethe courage to embrace the truth about what was, and is occurring now inAntarctica."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1THE ENIGMATIC THULE SOCIETY: ANTIGRAVITY, HITLER & THE GERMAN NAVY "},{"pageContent":"THULE SOCIETY SPONSORS ANTIGRAVITY SPACECRAFT R & D The historic roots of the first secret space program and its genesis can betraced back to the early years of the Weimar Republic. At the end of the FirstWorld War in 1919, a number of German secret societies began collaborating inthe development of flying saucer prototypes based on the designs receivedthrough the telepathic communications of an unusually beautiful and highlyskilled psychic medium, Maria Orsic. When in a full trance state, she claimed tobe in communication with a range of otherworldly beings. Among those were agroup of Aryan or Nordic-looking extraterrestrials from the Aldebaran starsystem who wanted to assist humanity to develop spacecraft capable ofinterstellar flight. Orsic reported their intention in such an endeavor wouldraise human consciousness and accelerate humanity’s evolution as a species inthe galactic community.Using automatic writing, Orsic wrote numerous pages of what appeared to betechnical information in two foreign languages, though she did not recognize onelanguage at all. Another prominent psychic, “Sigrun”, assisted in understandingthe content of the writing by getting clear mental images of a flying saucercraft. Orsic and Sigrun concluded that the information revealed how to build aspaceship. [../images/00003.jpeg]Figure 2. Automatic writing by Maria Orsic containing Sumerian and Templarlanguages. Soon after, Orsic and Sigrun met with members from the Thule Society (ThuleGessellshaft), which after the First World War had become Germany’s mostpowerful secret society, notably comprised of aristocrats and leading occultistsof the day.[2] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn2] They were able to identify thesecond unknown language in the automatic writing as ancient Sumerian. Expertswere brought in to translate Orsic’s automatic writing. The translationconfirmed Sigrun’s mental images – it was in fact technical instructions forbuilding a revolutionary type of engine that could power a spacecraft.[3][part0000_split_079.html#_edn3] Orsic and supportive Thule society membersarranged for various scientists to look at the translated information todetermine whether it was scientifically feasible.Orsic was enthusiastically supported by the Thule Society due to its member’sbelief in the existence of an advanced far northern (now subterranean)civilization described in Greek and Roman legends as Hyperborea, whose ancientcapital was “Ultima Thule”. In a preserved fragment by the Greek historian,Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), he writes about this ancient civilization: Now for our part, since we have seen fit to make mention of the regions of Asiawhich lie to the north, we feel that it will not be foreign to our purpose todiscuss the legendary accounts of the Hyperboreans. Of those who have writtenabout the ancient myths, Hecataeus and certain others say that in the regionsbeyond the land of the Celts there lies in the ocean an island no smaller thanSicily. This island, the account continues, is situated in the north and isinhabited by the Hyperboreans, who are called by that name because their home isbeyond the point whence the north wind (Boreas) blows; and the island is bothfertile and productive of every crop, and since it has an unusually temperateclimate it produces two harvests each year… And the kings of this city and thesupervisors of the sacred precinct are called Boreadae, since they aredescendants of Boreas, and the succession to these positions is always kept intheir family.[4] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn4] The Boreadae were purported to be giant kings, around 10 feet tall by classicalscholars.[5] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn5] Thule Society members believed thatthe Hyerboreans were the progenitors of the Aryan/Germanic race, and they existto this present day, hidden away in the Earth’s interior.James and Suzanne Pool, authors of Who Financed Hitler, describe the powerfularistocratic members who financed and belonged to the Thule Society: Outwardly, this mysterious group passed as a literary circle devoted to studyingancient German history and customs... The Munich branch had been financed duringthe war by a Baron Rudolf von Sebottednorff, a shadowy individual who enlistedover 250 members from the city and 1,500 throughout Bavaria. The significance ofthe membership, however, was not to be found in its quantity but its quality.Among the group’s members were lawyers, judges, university professors, policeofficials, aristocratic members of the royal entourage of the Wittelsbachs,leading industrialists, surgeons, physicians, scientists, as well as richbusinessmen like the proprietor of the elegant Four Seasons Hotel in Munichwhere the society had its headquarters.[6] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn6] It is claimed that as early as 1917, Orsic met with Sebottendorf and three otherThule Society members in Vienna to discuss occult matters associated with hertelepathic communications.[7] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn7] Based on theenthusiastic support she received, Orsic subsequently moved to Munich in 1919 towork with Sebottendorf and the Thule Society.Thule Society leaders believed Orsic, and others like her, would offer importantclues to understand a mysterious force called “Vril”, a force that could beharnessed by individuals with sufficiently developed mental and psychicabilities. Such beliefs were very common among occult groups and secretsocieties in other nations as well, as exemplified in Edward Bulwer Lytton’s1871 book, Vril: The Coming Race. The novel centers on a young, independently wealthy traveler (the narrator), whoaccidentally finds his way into a subterranean world occupied by beings who seemto resemble angels and call themselves Vril-ya. The hero soon discovers that theVril-ya are descendants of an antediluvian civilization who live in networks ofsubterranean caverns linked by tunnels. It is a technologically supportedUtopia, chief among their tools being the \"all-permeating fluid\" called \"Vril\",a latent source of energy that its spiritually elevated hosts are able to masterthrough training of their will, to a degree which depends upon their hereditaryconstitution, giving them access to an extraordinary force that can becontrolled at will. The powers of the will include the ability to heal, change,and destroy beings and things; the destructive powers in particular areawesomely powerful, allowing a few young Vril-ya children to wipe out entirecities if necessary. It is also suggested that the Vril-ya are fullytelepathic.[8] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn8] Significantly, Lytton also described the Vril-ya as possessing “air-boats” thatcould direct the Vril force as a destructive energy beam over a distance of 600miles. I should say, however, that this people have invented certain tubes by which thevril fluid can be conducted towards the object it is meant to destroy,throughout a distance almost indefinite; at least I put it modestly when I sayfrom 500 to 600 miles. And their mathematical science as applied to such purposeis so nicely accurate, that on the report of some observer in an air-boat, anymember of the vril department can estimate unerringly the nature of interveningobstacles, the height to which the projectile instrument should be raised, andthe extent to which it should be charged, so as to reduce to ashes within aspace of time too short for me to venture to specify it, a capital twice as vastas London.[9] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn9] What Bulwer Lyton is referring to here in modern terms appears to be an aircraftequipped with a Directed Energy Weapon whose destructive capability exceeds thecombined atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki!Ominously, Lyton’s book carried with it the warning that in the future, thesurplus population of the subterranean Vril-ya civilization were destined toemerge on the Earth’s surface. Through their advanced psychic powers andtechnologies, they would wipe out inferior or barbaric races in order to claimsuitable territories. Those races which could sufficiently evolve in developingtheir inherent psychic abilities and technologies would become suitable partnersfor the emerging Vril-ya who would inevitably establish global domination.While Lytton’s book was published as a work of fiction, many occultists widelyviewed it as factually based, and derived from ancient texts describing one ormore hidden antediluvian civilizations. Lytton’s status as a prominent member ofthe Rosicrucian Society, which has secretly studied ancient texts and encouragedmembers to develop higher consciousness and occult abilities, no doubtinfluenced widespread belief in the factual accuracy of Vril: The Coming Race.Those who had developed such inherent psychic abilities would not only possessgreat power and rise to leadership positions, but would also be able to find anduse incredibly advanced technologies hidden all over the planet. Some of thesehidden technologies involved detailed designs of craft capable of space travel,which Thule Society members believed had first been developed by the ancientHyberborean civilization. Importantly, these technologies were used by thehidden civilizations in the Earth’s interior who were destined to emerge one dayon the planet’s surface.In order to understand the role of the Thule Society in the creation of the NaziParty and its evolution, a vital book to reference is The Morning of theMagicians by French authors, Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier. They point outin the beginning that Thule Society members believed that: … not all the secrets of Thule had perished. Beings intermediate between manand other intelligent beings from Beyond would place at the disposal of theInitiates a reservoir of forces which could be drawn on to enable Germany todominate the world again and be the cradle of the race of Supermen which wouldresult from mutations of the human species. One day her legions would set out toannihilate everything that had stood in the way of the spiritual destiny of theEarth, and their leaders would be men who knew everything, deriving theirstrength from the very foundation-head of energy and guided by the Great Ones ofthe Ancient World.[10] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn10] Consequently, Thule Society members deemed it critical to establish an alliancewith the Inner Earth (Hyperborean) beings who were destined to emerge in forceupon the planet’s surface: Alliances could be formed with the Master of the World or the King of Fear whoreigns over a city hidden somewhere in the East. Those who conclude a pact willchange the surface of the Earth and endow the human adventure with a new meaningfor many thousands of years. . . The world will change: the Lords will emergefrom the center of the Earth. Unless we have made an alliance with them andbecome Lords ourselves, we shall find ourselves among the slaves, on thedungheap that will nourish the roots of the New Cities that will arise.[11][part0000_split_079.html#_edn11] This led to Pauwels and Bergier’s pivotal conclusion that the Thule Society“took on its true character as a society of Initiates in communion with theInvisible, and became the magic center of the Nazi movement.”[12][part0000_split_079.html#_edn12] In short, they considered the Thule Society tobe the “secret directing agent of the Third Reich.”[13][part0000_split_079.html#_edn13]The Thule Society enthusiastically supported Orsic and the group of young ladiesshe gathered around herself in Munich who were also psychically gifted. This isthe period when Orsic created the “Alldeutsche Gesellschaft für Metaphysik”(Pan-German Society for Metaphysics) that was later renamed the Vril Society(Society of Vrilerinnen Women).[14] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn14] Anothername change apparently occurred in 1941 when Hitler outlawed secret societies.Orsic registered the society as a business, named \"AntriebstechnischeWerkstätten\" (Vril Propulsion Workshops).[15] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn15]These psychically gifted women dedicated themselves to developing techniques forcommunicating with otherworldly beings, and learned how to harness the Vrilforce for psychic purposes and space flight. Orsic herself was deeply dedicatedto promoting greater awareness of humanity’s latent spiritual potential andcosmic connections.James and Suzanne Pool describe the importance of maintaining pure Germanicbloodlines for Thule Society members whose primary task was to rediscover theglories of the ancient Hyperborean civilization established by their distantancestors: Only those who could prove their racial purity for at least three generationswere admitted to this organization, whose motto was: Remember that you are aGerman! Keep your blood pure…. Like many other volkisch (racial, nationalistmovements in Germany), the ostensible objective of the Thule Society was theestablishment of a Pan-Germanic state of unsurpassed power and Grandeur.[16][part0000_split_079.html#_edn16] Other German secret societies like the “Die Herren vom schwarzen Stein” (“TheLords of the Black Stone”) shared similar esoteric beliefs, and therefore,backed Orsic’s exotic spacecraft development program. The necessary funding andscientific expertise were subsequently found to cultivate the first workingprototypes based on the designs received by Orsic.Professor Winfried Schumann, Director of the Electrophysical Laboratory from theTechnical University of Munich (1924-1961), was a member of the Thule Societyand was tasked to build Orsic’s first craft.[17][part0000_split_079.html#_edn17] Schumann was an expert in high energy plasmaand high voltage electrostatics, both of which were key elements in thedevelopment of exotic propulsion systems for the proposed spacecraft.It has been documented that Schumann investigated the free energy device of theGerman inventor, Hans Coler (aka Kohler). This device would eventually generatesufficient electric energy to power a submarine, and later a spacecraft. Duringthe 1920’s, the German Navy was actively researching new propulsion systems forits future generation of U-boats, which were being secretly assembled outside ofGermany. In 1925, the German Navy had arranged for Schumann to evaluate the“Coler Device”, despite the German patent office rejecting Coler’s patentapplication. A report by a British Intelligence Sub-Committee cites Schuman’senthusiastic support of the Coler Device as an effective means of generating a“new source of energy”: After the present examination, carried through as carefully as [possible], Imust surmise that we have to face the exploitation of a new source of energywhose further developments can be of an immense importance. The apparatus wasvisible and accessible in all its essential parts. The inventor agreed quitewillingly to each trial in so far as, according to his statement, no harm couldbe done to the working of the apparatus. I do not believe in a deception. I deemit expedient to put the apparatus to a further test, and I believe that afurther development of the apparatus and an assistance, given to the inventor,will prove justified and of great importance. [18][part0000_split_079.html#_edn18] It’s worth noting that three years after Schumann had tested the Coler device,U.S. inventor Thomas Townsend Brown was awarded a British patent for anelectrogravitic device that was purported to have developed a new form ofpropulsion.[19] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn19] In a subsequent 1929 paper,Brown described how Einstein’s efforts to develop a unified field theory hadinspired him to find a fundamental connection between matter, gravity andelectricity. There is a decided tendency in the physical sciences to unify the great basiclaws and to relate, by a single structure or mechanism, such individualphenomena as gravitation, electrodynamics and even matter itself. It is foundthat matter and electricity are very closely related in structure. In the finalanalysis matter loses its traditional individuality and becomes merely an\"electrical condition.\" In fact, it might be said that the concrete body of theuniverse is nothing more than an assemblage of energy which, in itself, is quiteintangible. Of course, it is self-evident that matter is connected withgravitation and it follows logically that electricity is likewise connected.These relations exist in the realm of pure energy and consequently are verybasic in nature. In all reality they constitute the true backbone of theuniverse. It is needless to say that the relations are not simple, and fullunderstanding of their concepts is complicated by the outstanding lack ofinformation and research on the real nature of gravitation.[20][part0000_split_079.html#_edn20] It is certain that Schumann would have been aware of Townsend-Brown’s device,and the radical new theories that underscored it. Combining the scientificbreakthroughs behind the Coler device and the Townsend Brown electrograviticsdevice, Schumann had the scientific means for building the energy and propulsionsystems for future German submarines, and more notably, spacecraft. [../images/00004.jpeg]Figure 3. Hans Coler Free Energy Device Documentary evidence further substantiating Schumann’s involvement in Germanresearch and development of exotic propulsion systems is found in a 1946 US ArmyAir Force document that includes Schumann on a list of German scientistsrequested to work at Wright Field under Operation Paperclip. [../images/00005.jpeg]Figure 4. Professor Schumann shown as part of Operation Paperclip "},{"pageContent":"THULE SOCIETY CHOOSES HITLER TO LEAD A PAN-GERMANIC WORKERS MOVEMENT The rise of Adolf Hitler was made possible by the Thule Society which secretlybacked him. Prominent Thule Society members had sponsored the creation of theGerman Workers Party espousing nationalist ideals in order to prevent theworking class from falling under the influence of the rapidly growing Communistmovement. Unlike most other conservative nationalists, the Thule Society was aware of thedangers presented by the widening gap between the officer class and the workers.It became one of the society’s primary objectives to bring the working man backinto the national camp…. Given the existing sentiments of class hostility theThule program would be automatically rejected by the masses if proposed bysomeone of a privileged class.[21] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn21] The creation of the German Worker’s Party took place on January 5, 1919, and theThule Society initially supported Anton Drexler to lead it as a figurehead whothey would use and secretly control in order to achieve the Society’span-Germanic, anti-Semitic and metaphysical agenda. [22][part0000_split_079.html#_edn22]Drexler, however, lacked the organizational, oratorical and charismatic skillsnecessary to build up membership for a large workers party espousing apan-Germanic agenda. Fatefully, the necessary leader was found when a youngGerman Army spy attended one of the German Workers Party’s meetings, as the lateJim Marrs writes in his book, Rise of the Fourth Reich: It was in this setting that Hitler, a twenty-nine-year- old veteran, came intocontact with members of the “Thule Gesellschaft\", or Thule Society, ostensiblyan innocent reading group dedicated to the study and promotion of older Germanliterature. But the society, composed mostly of wealthy conservatives, ardentnationalists, and anti-Semites, actually delved into radical politics, racemysticism, and the occult under its emblem—a swastika superimposed over a sword.The society also served as a front for the even more secretive Germanenorden, orGerman Order, a reincarnation of the old Teutonic Knights, which had branchesthroughout Germany patterned after Masonic lodges. It is believed that theselodges carried on the agenda of the outlawed Bavarian Illuminati, with itsfundamental maxim that “the end justifies the means.”[23][part0000_split_079.html#_edn23] Marrs’ view that the Thule Society was a new incarnation of the banned BavarianIlluminati is important to keep in mind given its behind-the-scenes role inHitler’s rise to power and the emergence of the Third Reich.James and Suzanne Pool assert that Hitler would have quickly learned that theGerman Workers Party was sponsored by the Thule Society, and had agreed to workwith prominent Thule members in achieving their commonly shared pan-Germanic,anti-Semitic and metaphysical beliefs: [W]as Hitler aware at the time he joined that the German Workers Party wasbacked by the Thule Society? ... Considering Hitler’s position as an Army agentand his interest in nationalistic anti-Semitic politics, it is likely that hewas aware of the society’s backing this new little movement called the GermanWorkers Party. If Hitler had such information it would explain why he chose thissmall party from the many other nationalist groups which were in existence atthe time. [24] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn24] Thus, the Thule Society began supporting the German Workers Party, which inearly 1920, at Hitler’s insistence, changed its name to the National SocialistGerman Workers Party or Nazi Party.[25] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn25] TheThule Society organized for its Munich based newspaper, the VolkischerBeobachter (National Observer), “the leading right-wing anti-Semitic paper inBavaria”, to promote the new Party’s agenda.[26][part0000_split_079.html#_edn26] The newspaper was soon handed over to the NaziParty, which had mysteriously raised the funds to purchase it, and it henceforthbecame the official mouthpiece of the Nazi Party. This was a critical step intransforming the fledgling Nazi Party into a mass movement, and for introducingHitler to a national audience. All of this was achieved through a newspaper thatwas first established and secretly controlled by prominent Thule Societymembers: When the Thule Society turned the Volkischer Beobachter over to the Nazi Party,it must have been specified in the deal that a Thule member (Amann) would remainin charge of the newspaper’s funds, and moreover, would be appointed ‘Partybusiness manager’ with control over all Party money…. With Amann as Partybusiness manager, Eckart as editor of the Party newspaper, and Rosenberg asassistant editor, the Thule Society’s involvement with the Nazis was strongerthan ever. But since the basic ideology of the Thule Society and the Nazi Partywere the same, these men could be loyal Nazis as well as members of thesociety.[27] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn27] It is not just vital organizational support from Thule Society members thatproved essential for Hitler’s rise to power. It was also the ideas and motifs ofthe Thule Society which Hitler used to appeal to a wide pan-Germanic base,according to the Pool’s: The symbol of the Thule Society was the swastika. Its letterheads and literaturedisplayed the emblem, and large swastika flags decorated its plush meeting roomsand offices. Many of the themes and slogans of the group were later repeated byHitler almost word for word.[28] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn28] [../images/00006.jpeg]Figure 5. Thule Society use of Swastika adapted by the Nazi Party The Swastika represented the coveted Vril force and thus was a vital aspect ofwhat the Thule Society believed all pure blooded Germans had to learn andmaster. Hitler’s adoption of many Thule Society ideas and motifs is evidencethat he was himself an occultist, and even a Thule member as claimed byhistorical researchers such as Trevor Ravenscroft, author of The Spear ofDestiny.[29] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn29]In addition, Thule Society members provided vital support to Hitler in the faceof police prosecution for his outspoken nationalist views. As the Pool’s write: The most significant assistance he would get from the Thule Society for the timebeing was protection from police prosecution thanks to Thule members in theBavarian government. [30] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn30] According to the Pool’s, Hitler’s fledgling Nazi party would eventually outgrowits Thule Society patron: [A]s the German Workers Party would begin to grow and develop under Hitler’sguidance, able and intelligent Thule sympathizers and members would join it andbe of the utmost value to Hitler. Eventually the child of the masses wouldoutgrow its secret society parent. [31] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn31] Historians largely agree that the Thule Society backed Hitler’s rise to power,but like the Pool’s, dismiss its long term significance given its apparentdissolution in 1925, the same year Hitler’s autobiography Mein Kampf (MyStruggle) was published, notably with Thule Society support. Similarly, NicholasGoodrick-Clark, author of The Occult Roots of Nazism writes: “The Thule Societywas dissolved around 1925 when support had dwindled.” [32][part0000_split_079.html#_edn32]This is where the Pool’s and Goodrick-Clark fail to take into account the ThuleSociety’s behind-the-scenes role as an occult group, not a political lobbygroup. Rather than disappearing from the national scene and having its membersabsorbed by the growing Nazi Party, the Thule Society succeeded in infiltratingHitler’s Nazi Party to place prominent members in key positions to achieve itslong term goals. As cited earlier, Pauwels and Bergier saw the Thule Society asthe “magic center of the Nazi movement“.[33] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn33]Many additional sources point to the Thule Society’s continued existence behindthe scenes as an underground, but highly powerful, organization that silentlyworked with and manipulated Hitler long after its apparent public dissolution in1925.[34] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn34]As a modern day incarnation of the banned Bavarian Illuminati, Thule Societymembers were very familiar with exerting influence from behind the scenes inorder not to generate alarm over their hidden influence. After all, the BavarianIlluminati had been outlawed once before due to the outcry by an alarmed public,resulting in the seizure of its property and wealth by the Bavarian government.Hitler shared the pan-Germanic, anti-Semitic and metaphysical goals of the ThuleSociety, so why jeopardize them by revealing the Thule Society’s truebehind-the-scenes role? Hitler was very eager to show his independence and notexpose himself as an occult practitioner or follower of an aristocratically ledgroup such as the Thule Society.According to Ian Kershaw, author of Hitler: 1889-1936, the Thule Society’s\"membership list... reads like a Who's Who of early Nazi sympathizers andleading figures in Munich\", which included Rudolf Hess, Alfred Rosenberg, HansFrank, Julius Lehmann, Gottfried Feder, Dietrich Eckart, and Karl Harrer.[35][part0000_split_079.html#_edn35] An even more expansive list was provided by theauthors Dietrich Bronder (Before Hitler Came) and E.R. Carmin (Guru Hitler), whoalso enumerated many Thule Society members, some of whom rose to become powerfulofficials in the Nazi Government: * Baron Rudolf von Sebottendorf, Grand Master of the Order * Guido von List, Master of the Order * Jorg Lanz von Liebenfels, Master of the Order * Adolf Hitler, “Fuhrer”, German Chancellor, SS Superior * Rudolf Hess, Vice Fuhrer, and SS Obergruppenfuhrer * Herman Goering, Reichsmarschall and SS Obergruppenfuhrer * Heinrich Himmler, Reichsfuhrer SS and Reichsminister * Alfred Rosenberg, Reichsminister and NS-Reichsleiter * Hans Franck, Dr. Dr. h.c., NS-Reichsleiter and Governor General of Poland * Julius Streicher, SA-Obergruppenfuhrer and Gauleiter of Franken * Karl Haushofer, Prof. Dr., Major General ret. * Gottfried Feder, Prof. Dr., Secretary of State ret. * Dietrich Eckart, Editor in Chief of the Volkischer Beobachter * Bernhard Stempfle, father confessor and confidant of Hitler * Theo Morell, personal physician of Hitler * Franz Gurtner, president of the police, Munich * Rudolf Steiner, founder of the anthroposophic teaching * W.O. Schumann, Prof. Dr. at the Technical University Munich * Trebisch-Lincoln, occultist and traveler to the Himalayas * Countess Westrap * AND MANY OTHERS...[36] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn36] Among Thule Society members, Dietrich Eckart was of particular importance toHitler early in his political career by providing access to powerful peoplewilling to fund the Nazi party. The Pool’s write: In light of his success, more important members of the Thule Society began tojoin the German Workers Party… One of them Dietric Eckart came to exert atremendously powerful personal influence on Hitler…. He gave Hitler his firstintroduction to better society and, what is more important, to people who werefinancial backers of the Thule Society.[37] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn37] It was Eckert who made it possible for the Nazi Party to raise the necessaryfunds to purchase the Volkischer Beobachter newspaper, and he became its chiefeditor up to his death in 1923.[38] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn38] Hitlerdedicated the second volume of Mein Kampf to Eckart, illustrating the powerfulinfluence this leading Thule Society member had upon him.Another strong influence on Hitler was the retired Army General and thenUniversity of Munich Professor, Karl Haushofer. His pioneering research in Japanand Asia led to many insights about ancient history, the role of the Aryan raceand understanding the mysterious Vril force. Haushofer was also a member of theThule Society and passed on his teachings to an enthusiastic student and Thulemember, Rudolf Hess, who became Hitler’s right hand man.It was Hess who helped Hitler in the writing of Mein Kampf, which contained manyof Haushofer’s seminal ideas.[39] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn39] In 1945,after the defeat of Nazi Germany, Haushofer explained to his US Armyinterrogators, “I was only able to influence [Hitler] through Hess.”[40][part0000_split_079.html#_edn40] This was a very telling admission. Hess inreality was Hitler’s handler on behalf of the Thule Society, a role he wouldcontinue to play right up to 1941, when he was captured during his failed peacemission to Scotland. Hess was part of an orchestrated effort to reach a peacedeal with a pro-German faction in the British aristocracy, which includedprominent members of the Royal Family – many of whom had strong ties to Thuleand other Secret Society members within the Nazi Government."},{"pageContent":" GERMAN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT OF THULE SOCIETY & HITLER The Thule Society had a critical institutional ally in promoting itspan-Germanic, anti-Semitic and metaphysical agenda during the years of theWeimar Republic – the German Navy (Reichsmarine, renamed Kriegsmarine duringWWII). From its inception, the Thule Society had been supported by the GermanNavy due to its staunch opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, advocacy ofGerman national unity, and its commitment to rapid rearmament. The German Navyand other German nationalist organizations recognized that the Versailles Treatyhad the effect of encouraging secessionist movements due to the hardships itimposed, and it conveyed the idea that breakaway states would be exempted fromits onerous provisions. A breakup of Germany would remove it as a potentialgeo-political rival to Britain and France for decades, and make economic revivalthat much harder.Towards the end of World War I, Bavaria had a powerful secessionist movement,which was supported by the Communist movement. From April 6 to May 3, 1919, aBavarian Soviet Republic was briefly in power, but after the execution of eightaristocratic members of the Thule Society, the Republic was violentlysuppressed. Bavarian secessionism was vehemently opposed by the Thule Societyand the German Navy. Thus, cooperation was natural and inevitable between theseorganizations, and quickly manifested once the Thule Society was formed in early1919. The first evidence for this reveals itself in the Navy providing space forThule meetings, as the Pool’s note: Before the Thule Society rented their own offices in the Four Seasons Hotel,they held their meetings in the rooms of the Naval Officers Club in the samehotel. The Thule Society supported and later sheltered many of the officers andmen of the Ehrardt Brigade, a naval unit, after the Kapp putsh failed. [41][part0000_split_079.html#_edn41] Yet another powerful reason for the German Navy’s support for the Thule Societycomes out of the Treaty of Versailles, which severely limited the number ofships the Navy could own, as well as abolishing entire fleet categories such assubmarines. Article 181 of the treaty stipulated: After the expiration of a period of two months from the coming into force of thepresent Treaty the German naval forces in commission must not exceed: 6battleships of the Deutschland or Lothringen type, 6 light cruisers, 12destroyers, 12 torpedo boats, or an equal number of ships constructed to replacethem as provided in Article l90.No submarines are to be included.All other warships, except where there is provision to the contrary in thepresent Treaty, must be placed in reserve or devoted to commercial purposes.[42] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn42] In order to circumvent the Treaty restrictions, Naval Intelligence had arrangedto work with major German companies to secretly build naval assets in foreignnations, until such time as the restrictions were lifted and rearmament couldopenly proceed. To this end, German Naval Intelligence used the Thule Society tofunnel financial support to Hitler, and was an important covert funder of theNazis in their rise to political power. Besides the aristocrats, businessmen, and White Russians, there remained oneother group from which Hitler received money: Naval Intelligence…. Involved inthis case was the man who was later to become known as a leader of the Germanresistance against Hitler (then Lieutenant Commander) Wilhelm Canaris. Sinceintelligence agencies are expert at covering up any traces of their activities,the evidence that remains is rather sketchy. However, it is enough to definitelylink Hitler, the Organization Consul (a right-wing terrorist unit of formernaval officers), and funds of Naval Intelligence.[43][part0000_split_079.html#_edn43] Wilhelm Canaris, who, if not an outright member, at least shared many ThuleSociety beliefs, not only helped to secretly fund Hitler with Naval Intelligencefunds, but also assisted in organizing the Nazi paramilitary units that wereinstrumental in street fighting against communists and other radical leftistgroups. [44] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn44] Canaris’ role in helping fund andorganize the Nazis was later rewarded by Hitler who had him appointed chief ofGerman military intelligence (Abwehr) from 1935 to 1944.Soon after the end of World War I hostilities, German Naval Intelligence beganworking with major steel companies such as Thyssen, Frick, Krupp, and the giantchemical conglomerate, I.G. Farben (formed in 1925), to secretly direct funds towhere they needed to be for the covert Naval rearmament program. Countries suchas Spain and Holland would become important intermediaries in building U-boats(submarines), which would eventually be reassembled in Germany. Ian Colvin,author of a biography on Canaris, wrote: The German Navy would be expanded, the U-boats that Canaris had hitherto helpedto lay down secretly in Spain and Holland would be assembled at Hamburg, Bremen,and the Baltic ports after being prefabricated at inland factories.[45][part0000_split_079.html#_edn45] Later, I will examine how the knowledge and connections Canaris acquired in thecovert building of submarine components and other military assets – in foreignlands using German companies, and their international partners and subsidiariesduring the Weimar Republic years (1919-1933) – would prove invaluable over adecade later when bases were slated to be built in Antarctica after the firstNazi expedition there in early 1939.After becoming head of Nazi Germany’s military intelligence in 1935, Canarissoon began orchestrating a covert armament program outside of Germany, onceagain using leading German companies and their foreign partners. However, thistime the futuristic project would involve building fleets of antigravityspacecraft; using advanced technologies discovered by Thule/Nazi scientistsaround the world, along with the paranormal communications, and later, actualcontact with different extraterrestrial races.Lastly, coming back to the period immediately following World War I, a criticalcomponent stands out in the covert rearmament program spearheaded by the GermanNavy; foreign banks. These savvy institutions could finance such militaryconstruction endeavors outside of Germany without any suspicion being raisedover the ultimate destination of the weapons related products being built.August Thyssen, who owned one of Germany’s largest steel firms, Thyssen AG(founded in 1891) had opened a number of banks to facilitate business interestsand contracts with the German military. Thyssen’s foreign banks would play a keyrole as the intermediary in paying international contractors for the GermanNavy’s covert rearmament program. Notably, it was U.S. banks and corporationsthat played a significant role in providing funds for August Thyssen’s banks andthe German Naval Intelligence slush fund they were associated with."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 ROLE OF U.S. CORPORATIONS IN NAZI GERMANY "},{"pageContent":"U.S. CORPORATIONS AID COVERT REARMAMENT OF GERMAN NAVY & NAZI PARTY As World War I drew to a tumultuous close in 1918, August Thyssen opened theBank Voor Handel en Scheepvaart, N.V. in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.[46][part0000_split_079.html#_edn46] It was a subsidiary of his Berlin based AugustThyssen Bank of Germany, and was created to be his own personal bankingoperation. The Dutch bank would provide a safeguard for Thyssen and his two sonsto cleverly move significant funds at a moment’s notice, depending on theoutcome of the First World War. This became particularly important as Germanylurched into a chaotic period during the final stages of the war, that led up tothe signing of an armistice ending hostilities on November 11, 1918. The Treatyof Versailles was signed by the defeated Germans over seven months later on June28, 1919, and many hardships laid ahead as German industry attempted recovery inthe midst of onerous reparation payments that led to little in the way ofgovernment contracts.By placing funds in its Dutch bank, the Thyssen’s company was able to protectits remaining assets, recover from the devastating war losses, rebuild its steelbusiness, support anti-communist nationalist movements, and finally play a keyrole in the covert rearmament of the Germany military, particularly the Navy.The Thyssen family wholeheartedly supported the Thule Society and the GermanNavy’s effort to promote a strong nationalist movement. Hitler’s burgeoning NaziParty was the most promising of all the nationalist parties, and the Thyssen’ssaw opportunity in financially supporting it.Now, August Thyssen’s two sons would play diametrically different politicalroles in order for the family to protect itself in the future from the kind oflosses experienced from the First World War. According to John Loftus, a formerU.S. Department of Justice Nazi War Crimes prosecutor: After World War I, August Thyssen had been badly burned by the loss of assetsunder the harsh terms of the Versailles treaty. He was determined that it wouldnever happen again. One of his sons would join the Nazis; the other would beneutral. No matter who won the next war, the Thyssen family would survive withtheir industrial empire intact. Fritz Thyssen joined the Nazis in 1923; hisyounger brother married into Hungarian nobility and changed his name to BaronThyssen-Bornemisza. The Baron later claimed Hungarian as well as Dutchcitizenship. In public, he pretended to detest his Nazi brother, but in privatethey met at secret board meetings in Germany to coordinate their operations. Ifone brother were threatened with loss of property, he would transfer hisholdings to the other.[47] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn47] Fritz Thyssen is “remembered as the man who gave more money to Hitler than anyother individual.”[48] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn48] His first donation of100,000 gold marks ($25,000) was given to the Nazi Party after he first heardHitler speak in 1923.[49] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn49] Thyssen described howhe was persuaded by World War I General Erich Ludendorff, former Quartermastergeneral (the second most powerful military official in all of Germany) to attendthe Hitler speech: \"There is but one hope,\" Ludendorff said to me, \"and this hope is embodied inthe national groups which desire our recovery.\" He recommended to me inparticular the Overland League and, above all, the National Socialist party ofAdolf Hitler. Ludendorff greatly admired Hitler. \"He is the only man,\" he said,\"who has any political sense. Go and listen to him one day.\" I followed hisadvice. I attended several public meetings organized by Hitler. It was then thatI realized his oratorical gifts and his ability to lead the masses. Whatimpressed me most, however, was the order that reigned in his meetings, thealmost military discipline of his followers.[50][part0000_split_079.html#_edn50] Ludendorff understood the important role nationalist movements could play inGermany’s covert rearmament program and overturning the Versailles Treaty.International investors were needed to raise funds for the Thyssen family’smultiple projects, which would come to include the covert funding of Hitler’sNazi Party. In 1922, when U.S. banker Averell Harriman travelled to Germany andmet with the Thyssen family, a bargain was struck that investment opportunitiescould be best facilitated by jointly creating a private bank in New York; theUnion Banking Corporation, which was established in 1924. Harriman’s partner,George Herbert Walker (grandfather of President George Herbert Walker Bush)became the President of the new bank. In 1926, he appointed his son-in-law,Prescott Bush, to be the Vice-President of the Union Banking Corporation. Thenewly established bank “made it easy for the Thyssens to move assets around,launder money, conceal profits and evade taxes.”[51][part0000_split_079.html#_edn51] In turn, the Union Banking Corporation helpedPrescott Bush amass a fortune which he used effectively in his campaign to getelected to the U.S. Senate, and this wealth enabled him to establish a politicaldynasty paving the way for a son (George H.W. Bush) and grandson (George W.Bush) to become future U.S. Presidents.Despite the Union Banking Corporation having American directors, its principalowners were the Thyssen family through its Dutch bank subsidiary, as an August16, 1941 investigation into the Union Banking Corporation confirmed: \"Union Banking Corporation, incorporated August 4 1924, is wholly owned by theBank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Myinvestigation has produced no evidence as to the ownership of the Dutch bank. MrCornelis [sic] Lievense, president of UBC, claims no knowledge as to theownership of the Bank voor Handel but believes it possible that Baron HeinrichThyssen, brother of Fritz Thyssen, may own a substantial interest.\"[52][part0000_split_079.html#_edn52] Investigators furthermore concluded that: “the Union Banking Corporation hassince its inception handled funds chiefly supplied to it through the Dutch bankby the Thyssen interests for American investment.”[53][part0000_split_079.html#_edn53] Webster Tarpley, author of George Bush: TheUnauthorized Biography, wrote: Thus by personal agreement between Averell Harriman and Fritz Thyssen in 1922,W.A. Harriman & Co. (alias Union Banking Corporation) would be transferringfunds back and forth between New York and the “Thyssen interests” in Germany. Byputting up about $400,000, the Harriman organization would be joint owner andmanager of Thyssen’s banking operations outside of Germany…[54][part0000_split_079.html#_edn54] In 1926, Fritz Thyssen took over his father’s steel company, and two years laterhe formed a corporate conglomerate, United Steelworks (Vereinigte StahlwerkeAG), which controlled more than 75% of Germany’s iron ore reserves. Thyssen’sconglomerate, which included the newly renamed company from his father, AugustThyssen-Hutte AG, became essential to steel production for Nazi Germany up toand throughout World War II, and for its covert naval rearmament program usingforeign banks and subsidiaries in the Netherlands, U.S. and elsewhere around theworld.Other German industrialists collaborated with the Thyssens in using foreignsubsidiaries and banks to move funds and participate in the covert rearmamentprogram spearheaded by the German Navy. Among them was Friederich Flick, whopartnered with Thyssen in setting up United Steelworks, and worked through theUnion Banking Company, as Webster Tarpley describes: Friedrich Flick was the major co-owner of the German Steel Trust with FritzThyssen, Thyssen’s long-time collaborator and occasional competitor…. TheFlick-Harriman partnership was directly supervised by Prescott Bush, PresidentBush’s father, and by George Walker, President Bush’s grandfather.[55][part0000_split_079.html#_edn55] In 1926, Allen Dulles (the future Director of the CIA) joined his brother, JohnFoster Dulles (future Secretary of State under President Eisenhower) at theprestigious law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, which John Foster was managing atthe time. James Srode, author of a biography of Allen Dulles, described thecompany’s influence at the time: It was upon Foster Dulles’ accession to the post of managing partner, thebiggest, most powerful, most respected law firm in the world. Its clients werenational governments, major corporations, even entire industries.[56][part0000_split_079.html#_edn56] Among the Dulles brother’s many clients was the same Dutch bank belonging to theThyssen family, Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V of Rotterdam. The Dullesbrothers also represented a number of other German companies, including thegiant I.G. Farben chemical conglomerate, which along with the Thyssens andFlicks’ United Steelworks, would play an essential role in the rearmament ofGermany and the development of its fledgling secret space programs, one of whichwould be set up in Antarctica. "},{"pageContent":"U.S. CORPORATIONS AND HITLER’S RISE TO POWER Hitler was chosen to be the charismatic figurehead for a pan-Germanicnationalist movement based on the ideas of territorial expansion and racialsupremacy as he most clearly enunciated in his 1925 book, Mein Kempf. Underlyingthese pan-Germanic views was the Thule Society belief that the German race wasdirectly descended from the Hyboborean’s and their great civilization, and thusthe most likely to succeed in finding and developing the latter’s hidden ancienttechnologies using the Vril force, symbolized by the Swastika.The Nazi Party was vehemently anti-communist, hostile to Jewish influence, andopposed to the growing power of the labor movement. Hitler’s Nazi Party, nowfully infiltrated by Thule Society members, aimed to work closely with Germanindustrialists led by the Thyssen family, who wanted to restore Germany’smanufacturing potential through favorable Government policies. In 1933, Thyssenled the way in organizing a letter by 39 German industrialists which includedfamous business names such as Krupp, Siemens and Bosch to call for the agingPresident Paul Von Hindenberg to appoint Hitler as Chancellor of Germany – aposition similar to Prime Minister in the Westminster system of Government.[57][part0000_split_079.html#_edn57] This led to a meeting on January 4, 1933 wherea deal was struck between Hindenberg and a group of German aristocrats,industrialists and army officers.[58] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn58] On January 30, Hitler became Chancellor, albeit with minority party support, inthe Reichstag (German Parliament). Hitler immediately called for new electionsto be held on March 5, 1933, aiming to increase the number of Nazi Partyrepresentatives in the Reichstag (only 196 out of a total 647), which wascritical to his plans to expand his power as Chancellor. Thyssen once again wasinstrumental in supporting Hitler and arranged for the Association of GermanIndustrialists to donate three million Reichmarks to the Nazi Party for theMarch election.Hitler was successful in increasing the number of Nazi Party representativesfrom 196 to 288. Together with the 52 seats of its coalition partner, the GermanNational People’s Party, the Nazis had achieved a staunch majority in theReichstag. This opened the pathway for Hitler’s power as Chancellor to swell. Inthanks, Hitler arranged for Thyssen to be elected a Nazi member of the Reichstagand appointed him to the Council of State of Prussia, both of which werehonorary positions. Thyssen’s influence and his role in bringing Hitler to powerwas immortalized in the August 1933 edition of the German magazine, AIZ, showingThyssen pulling Hitler’s strings on behalf of German industry. The Germancaption reads: “Tool in god’s hands. Toy in Thyssen’s hands.” [../images/00007.jpeg]Figure 6. German Magazine AIZ illustrates Fritz Thyssen’s influence over AdolfHitler in 1933. After having consolidated his power, Hitler quickly began cracking down onCommunists, the labor movement and the Jewish population. Policies were passedwhich enabled German Corporations to utilize Germany’s highly skilled populationat bargain basement rates. German manufacturing took off with abundantly cheaplabor where workers were prevented by the government from any attempt to improveworker conditions through industrial action against their corporate masters.Thyssen and other major German industrialists were amply rewarded for supportingHitler’s rise to power. Most significantly, Hitler’s government was veryfavorable to international corporations that wanted to partner with Germancompanies in building large factories that utilized Germany’s cheap labor force.Once again, Thyssen played a key role in this process.According to author and political writer, Eustace Mullens, both Allen and JohnFoster Dulles attended the January 4, 1933 meeting between Hindenberg and Germanindustrialists resulting in pledged support for Hitler since he had promised tobreak the power of the trade union movement if he became Chancellor.[59][part0000_split_079.html#_edn59] Most historians dispute the Dulles brothers’attendance at the meeting. What is known without dispute, however, is that bothDulles brothers did meet with Hitler in Berlin in the months of April and May1933, and that the German companies the brothers represented, through Sullivanand Cromwell, were part of the industrialist group that brought Hitler to power.James Srodes, one of Allen Dulles biographers, confirms that Dulles met withHitler in April 1933, only a month after the elections that cemented his powerwithin the Reichstag.[60] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn60] John Foster Dullesalso attended the meeting with Hitler, which was part of a series ofnegotiations that culminated in agreements reached in May 1933 between their lawfirm, Sullivan and Cromwell, and dozens of German companies and Nazi clients, asWebster Tarpley explains: In May 1933, just after the Hitler regime was consolidated, an agreement wasreached in Berlin for the coordination of all Nazi commerce with the U.S.A. TheHarriman International Co., led by Averell Harriman’s first cousin Oliver, wasto head a syndicate of 150 firms and individuals, to conduct all exports fromHitler Germany to the United States.This pact had been negotiated in Berlin between Hitler’s economics minister,Hjalmar Schacht, and John Foster Dulles, international attorney for dozens ofNazi enterprises, with the counsel of Max Warburg and Kurt von Schroeder.Throughout the 1930’s, John Foster Dulles arranged debt restructuring for Germanfirms under a series of decrees issued by Adolf Hitler. In these deals, Dullesstruck a balance between the interest owed to selected, larger investors, andthe needs of the growing Nazi war-making apparatus for producing tanks, poisongas, etc.[61] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn61] Whether or not the Dulles brothers attended the secret January 1933 meetingbetween President Hindenberg and German industrialists, it is certain they wouldhave been aware of it, and even encouraged it in order to promote the stabilityof the German economy. As Srodes, writes: [Allen Dulles] recognized that Sullivan & Cromwell had a vested interest inpreserving the stability of the German economy no matter who was in power; fullyone-third of all the foreign bonds that defaulted to their American investorsduring the Depression were on loans made to German government units andbusinesses, bonds which the firm, and he and Foster personally, had a large handin facilitating.[62] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn62] Since Hitler was good for German businesses, then Hitler was good for the Dullesbrothers and the investments of U.S. corporations such as Prescott Bush’s UnionBanking Corporation in Germany.Among the major U.S. corporations that invested heavily in Nazi Germany was theFord Motor Company. In fact, Henry Ford was cited by Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampfon the issue of how to deal with the Jewish question: … only a single great man, Ford, [who], to [the Jews'] fury, still maintainsfull independence ... [from] the controlling masters of the producers in anation of one hundred and twenty millions.[63] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn63] In 1920, Ford had arranged for his personal newspaper, the Dearborn Independent,to release 91 stories about the “Jewish menace” which were published anddistributed in a four volume set, called The International Jew.[64][part0000_split_079.html#_edn64] Famously, in a 1931 interview with a DetroitNews Reporter, “Hitler said he regarded Ford as his “inspiration,\" explaininghis reason for keeping Ford's life-size portrait next to his desk.”[65][part0000_split_079.html#_edn65] Jim Marrs explains how Hitler’s admiration forFord was fully reciprocated: Ford became an admirer of Hitler, provided funds for the Nazis, and, in 1938,became the First American to receive the highest honor possible for anon-German: the Grand Cross of the Supreme Order of the German Eagle.[66][part0000_split_079.html#_edn66] The Rockefeller family-led oil giant, Standard Oil, also invested heavily inGermany through its partnership with the I.G. Farben conglomerate: In 1934 Germany produced only 300,000 tons of natural petroleum products andsynthetic gasoline. In 1944, thanks to the transfer of hydrogenation technologyfrom Standard Oil of New Jersey to I. G. Farben, Germany produced 6,500,000 tonsof oil, 85 percent of which was synthetic.[67] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn67] Significantly, according to Paul Manning, a CBS news correspondent during WorldWar II, Hermann Schmitz, the President of I.G. Farben, once held as much stockin Standard Oil of New Jersey as did the Rockefellers.”[68][part0000_split_079.html#_edn68]Other leading U.S. corporations such as General Motors, IBM (InternationalBusiness Machines) and ITT (International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation)established subsidiaries in Nazi Germany. U.S. Banks such as J.P. Morgan’s FirstNational Bank of New York, the Rockefeller’s Chase National Bank and theNational City Bank of New York backed the U.S. corporate investments in Germany,playing a major role in the rapid growth in German manufacturing industries andthe military re-armament of Germany.[69] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn69]Charles Higham, author of Trading with the Enemy, describes how anotherprominent U.S. Bank that directly supported Nazi Germany involved the Dullesbrothers, and even had Allen Dulles on its Board of Directors: [I]n 1936, the J. Henry Schroeder Bank of New York had entered into apartnership with the Rockefellers. Named Schroeder, Rockefeller and Company,Investment Bankers, the firm became what Time magazine called the economicbooster of “the Rome-Berlin Axis.” “Avery Rockefeller owned 42 percent ofSchroeder,” Higham reported. “Their lawyers were John Foster Dulles and AllenDulles of Sullivan and Cromwell. Allen Dulles (later of the Office of StrategicServices) was on the board of Schroeder.”[70] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn70] In 1937, U.S. Ambassador to Germany William E. Dodd explained how closeAmerica’s corporate elite was to Nazi Germany: A clique of U.S. industrialists is hell-bent to bring a fascist state tosupplant our democratic government and is working closely with the fascistregime in Germany and Italy. I have had plenty of opportunity in my post inBerlin to witness how close some of our American ruling families are to the Naziregime.[71] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn71] Higham describes this transnational clique of industrialists and national elitesthat shared Fascist/Nazi ideals as “The Fraternity”.[72][part0000_split_079.html#_edn72] The Fraternity included secret societies thatshared belief systems which transcended national affiliations. Thule Societyideas about an ancient Hyperborean race from which the Aryan race descended, andthe importance of maintaining racial purity and mastering the Vril force wereshared by The Fraternity, which today is called by other appellations, such as;the Cabal, Illuminati, the 13 ruling blood-line Families, etc.Industrialists and elites formed a close alignment of interests acrossinternational borders, ignoring democratic ideals and laws passed byrepresentative democracies. Even during the time of war, The Fraternitymaintained their mutual trade despite legislation, making a mockery of nationalparliaments and rulings such as the Trading with the Enemy Act, which had beenpassed in the U.S. in 1917. Despite similar legislation in other countries, TheFraternity could move profits across borders to maximize earnings from bothsides, and protect their investments by national appropriation.[73][part0000_split_079.html#_edn73] U.S. companies were able to legally do thisthrough a little known general license, authorized by President Roosevelt, thatcould be granted through the U.S. Treasury to companies, thereby, allowing themto circumvent the Trading With the Enemy Act.Higham describes the extent to which U.S. corporations worked with their Germanpartners not only leading up to World War II, but also unconscionably throughoutit as well, due to the licenses granted to them: To this day the bulk of Americans do not suspect The Fraternity. The governmentsmothered everything, during and even (inexcusably) after the war. What wouldhave happened if millions of American and British people, struggling withcoupons and lines at the gas stations, had learned that in 1942 Standard Oil ofNew Jersey managers shipped the enemy’s fuel through neutral Switzerland andthat the enemy was shipping Allied fuel? Suppose the public had discovered thatthe Chase Bank in Nazi occupied Paris, after Pearl Harbor was doing millions ofdollars’ worth of business with the enemy with the full knowledge of the headoffice in Manhattan? Or that Ford trucks were being built for the Germanoccupation troops in France with authorization from Dearborn, Michigan? Or thatColonel Sosthenes Behn, the head of the international American telephoneconglomerate ITT, flew from New York to Madrid to Berne, during the war to helpimprove Hitler’s communications systems and improve the robot bombs thatdevastated London? Or that ITT built the Focke-Wulfs that dropped bombs onBritish and American troops? Or that crucial ball bearings were shipped to Naziassociated customers in Latin America with the collusion of the vice chairman ofthe U.S. War Production Board in partnership with Goring’s cousin inPhiladelphia when American forces were desperately short of them? Or that sucharrangements were known about in Washington and either sanctioned ordeliberately ignored?[74] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn74] Roosevelt had passed his presidential edict authorizing licenses to circumventthe Trading with the Enemy Act only six days after the December 7, 1941 PearlHarbor attack.[75] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn75] [../images/00008.jpeg]Figure 7. General Licenses could be granted to Companies trading with NaziGermany during WWII. Roosevelt’s edict, according to Higham, was done to benefit the interests of TheFraternity, and served no genuine national security purpose. However, there isanother plausible explanation to consider for why such licenses were granted.They would invaluably allow US Navy and Army spies to infiltrate keytransnational corporations in Nazi Germany to gather intelligence on theiradvanced technology programs, just as William Tompkins claims regarding theintelligence program he participated in at Naval Air Station, San Diego, from1942 to 1946. In a personal interview, Tompkins confirmed that U.S. companieswere indeed used as a means of infiltrating the Nazis aerospace industries. [76][part0000_split_079.html#_edn76]In the case of the International Telegraph and Telephone company (ITT), whichworked closely with U.S. military intelligence, it was among the U.S. companiesgranted licenses to continue working with Axis powers right up to 1945, asHigham writes: ITT was allowed to continue its relations with the Axis and Japan until 1945,even though this conglomerate was regarded as an official instrument of UnitedStates Intelligence… [I]n the case of ITT, perhaps the most flagrant of thecorporations in its outright dealings with the enemy, Hitler and his postmastergeneral, the venerable Wilhelm Ohnesorge, strove to impound the German end ofthe business. But even they were powerless in such a situation: the Gestapoleader of counterintelligence, Walter Schellenberg, was a prominent director andshareholder of ITT by arrangement with New York – an even Hitler dared not crossthe Gestapo.[77] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn77] The extent of ITT operations in Nazi Germany covered numerous sectors of theaviation industry, providing Navy spies ample opportunities to infiltrate Germanindustry as Tompkins attests happened: ITT, through its subsidiary C. Lorenz AG, owned 25% of Focke-Wulf, the Germanaircraft manufacturer, builder of some of the most successful Luftwaffe fighteraircraft. In the 1960’s, ITT Corporation won $27 million in compensation fordamage inflicted on its share of the Focke-Wulf plant by Allied bombing duringWorld War II. In addition, Sutton’s book uncovers that ITT owned shares ofSignalbau AG, Dr. Erich F. Huth (Signalbau Huth), which produced for the GermanWehrmacht radar equipment and transceivers in Berlin, Hanover (later Telefunkenfactory) and other places.[78] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn78] During World War II, Focke-Wulf, like many aviation companies, had to move itsmanufacturing plants underground to escape the Allied bombing campaigns. It wasduring this critical period that Focke-Wulf, an innovator in the aviationindustry, became one of many German companies that moved assets and personnel toAntarctica. Focke-Wulf developed the first helicopters for the War effort andthis made them one of the leading German companies for the construction offuture spacecraft using advanced propulsion technologies. Well after the end of WWII, Focke-Wulf rose as a prominent aviation company inEurope, and played a significant role in the formation of the European giant inAerospace; Airbus. During this entire period, Focke-Wulf worked closely withITT, which became an important U.S. collaborator in the development of a secretspace program in Antarctica. Indeed, as will be discussed in chapter 14, ITT wasamong the first, if not THE first U.S. defense contractor to work in Antarctica.This is not all that surprising since according to Tompkins, ITT was a“Reptilian company”, and Hitler had secretly reached agreements with theReptilians to move German resources to Antarctica, as will be discussed indetail in chapter four.[79] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn79] ITT was a keycompany in the worldwide Fraternity described by Higham, where loyaltiestranscended national allegiances to pursue a global elite agenda.[80][part0000_split_079.html#_edn80]In the lead up to World War II, while U.S. industries and bankers were floodinginto Nazi Germany to sign merger deals, establish subsidiaries and build massivenew factories, Hitler learned about the spacecraft prototypes that had beenfunded by the Thule and other German secret societies. The German Navy, throughits close collaboration with Thule Society officials, was aware of its researchand development of such promising spacecraft technologies bearing manysimilarities to submarine construction. The same slush fund, established byWilhelm Canaris for secret submarine construction, was also available for suchexotic research, which the German Navy was in the best position to secretly fundand develop. As mentioned in chapter 1, it was the German Navy that had arrangedfor scientists such as Professor Schumann to evaluate the free energy devicedeveloped by Hans Coler, and secretly develop working prototypes for submarineconstruction.The same secret societies funding Hitler’s rise to power now wanted him toprovide state support for their efforts to build a secret space program capableof reaching the stars. Hitler was only too willing, and secretly committed theresources of the Nazi State into the research and development of such exotictechnologies. His goals were quite simple. Technologies that could be developedto achieve flight to the stars could also be used to establish domination overplanet Earth.Leading German industrialists and Nazi ideologues agreed with the idea ofdeveloping the Vril spacecraft prototypes. The Nazi SS, led by Heinrich Himmler,would spearhead the effort to weaponize such advanced technologies for thecoming war effort. At the same time, Hitler would provide all the technical andscientific assistance that was necessary for the German secret societies tobuild their interplanetary and interstellar space fleets.[81][part0000_split_079.html#_edn81]What is critical for understanding the development of spacecraft developmentprograms in the Weimar Republic and in Hitler’s Nazi Germany, is the role ofleading German companies, the German Navy, and secret societies in theirrespective collaboration to fund and build these fleets. With the rise of theNazi government, the Thule and other German secret societies would now have theunfettered support of the state in gaining the best scientific expertise andlarge scale funding for these top secret projects, along with the support ofleading German companies. It is important to keep in mind that during thisentire period, the close relationship between German and U.S. companies meantthat “The Fraternity” was also very likely either a part of, or informed about,these events. And, it is very probable that U.S. companies, such as ITT, begancollaborating with The Fraternity in developing spacecraft as early as theWeimar Republic years!In early 1939, the German secret societies had decided that their space programwould relocate to Antarctica, whose remoteness and deep cavern system under twomiles of ice, accessible only by submarines, would provide all that wasnecessary to build such a program without possible disruption from the impendingwar. In the midst of these secret efforts, the role of U.S. companies must beconsidered as a significant factor in the development of two German spaceprograms – the weaponization program in Nazi Germany, and theinterplanetary/interstellar program in Antarctica. As already mentioned, theU.S. corporate involvement in Germany’s burgeoning aerospace programs enabled animportant back door for US Navy spies to penetrate these top secret operations,and report back to Naval Air Station, San Diego, about what was really happeningin Nazi Germany and Antarctica."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 GERMAN COMPANIES BEGIN OPERATIONS IN ANTARCTICA "},{"pageContent":"GERMAN BASES MADE POSSIBLE WITHIN THE INHOSPITABLE CONTINENT Extensive portions of the Antarctic were claimed by Captain Alfred Ritscher, onbehalf of the Nazi government in 1938/1939, during the first Nazi expedition toAntarctica. While on this mission, the aircraft carrier, Schwabenland, sentplanes to perform extensive aerial surveillance of the newly claimed region,which was named Neuschwabenland.[82] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn82] Among thegoals of the Schwabenland expedition were the establishment of several bases inAntarctica. William Tompkins says US Navy spies reported during theirdebriefings that the Nazis had been given extraterrestrial assistance guidingthem to a large Antarctic cavern system, and specifically to where bases couldbe built in a favorable environment: Large portions of equipment were sent down there. But right next to them werethree tremendous size caverns which the Reptilians had. Not Grays, butReptilians. Germany got two more, about a tenth the size of the big Reptilians[cavern]. They were able to … [go] down, usually by submarine. They built theseflat submarines, regular class, so they could ship all this stuff down.[83][part0000_split_079.html#_edn83] In a personal interview, Tompkins further adds: The Reptilians already knew where all of the caverns were and all of the tunnelswere. Okay? So this, again, is nothing new to the Reptilians, and givinginstructions to the Germans, and it sort of comes up a little later as to wherethe good holes are underneath the water that go into tunnels because it’sunderneath the ocean’s level. All of this was just handed over to them. Theydidn’t have to do research.[84] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn84] Corey Goode, who claims to have served in a “20 and back” US Navy secret spaceprogram, says he read a digital version of the briefing documents which Tompkinshad prepared from the Navy spies’ debriefings. Notably, this took place fourdecades later when Goode was searching the archives on an SSP smart glass pad.Goode remembers the documents specifically describing: “three known Antarctic(Cities/Bases) and several secret underground bases in Argentina” that had beenestablished by the Nazis.[85] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn85]Recently in 2017, Australian and New Zealand scientists officially discoveredthe existence of large natural caverns in Antarctica, thermally heated byadjacent volcanoes. It was found that the temperature in the caverns could bebalmy 77° Fahrenheit (25°C) and support a variety of life forms! Chris Pash, areporter with Business Insider Australia, wrote about the scientists’ findings: Around Mount Erebus, an active volcano on Ross Island in Antarctica, steam hashollowed out extensive cave systems. Dr. Ceridwen Fraser from the ANU[Australian National University] Fenner School of Environment and Society saysforensic analyses of soil samples from these caves have revealed intriguingtraces of DNA from algae, mosses and small animals. “It can be really warminside the caves, up to 25 degrees Celsius in some caves,” Fraser says.… “The results from this study give us a tantalizing glimpse of what might livebeneath the ice in Antarctica – there might even be new species of animals andplants,” she says.…Dr. Charles Lee, another co-researcher from the University of Waikato, saysthere are many other volcanoes in Antarctica, so subglacial cave systems couldbe common across the icy continent.“We don’t yet know just how many cave systems exist around Antarctica’svolcanoes, or how interconnected these subglacial environments might be. They’rereally difficult to identify, get to and explore,” Dr. Lee says.[86][part0000_split_079.html#_edn86] The existence of extensive networks of mysterious underground caverns heated bynearby volcanoes is further strengthened by other recent scientific findings. InAugust 2017, scientists released a study revealing the discovery of 91 newvolcanoes, in addition to the 41 previously found, thereby forming the world’smost active volcanic region, deep under Antarctica’s ice sheets. Robert McKie, areporter with the Guardian newspaper wrote: Scientists have uncovered the largest volcanic region on Earth – two kilometersbelow the surface of the vast ice sheet that covers west Antarctica.The project, by Edinburgh University researchers, has revealed almost 100volcanoes – with the highest as tall as the Eiger, which stands at almost 4,000meters in Switzerland….After the team had collated the results, it reported a staggering 91 previouslyunknown volcanoes, adding to the 47 others that had been discovered over theprevious century of exploring the region.These newly discovered volcanoes range in height from 100 to 3,850 meters. Allare covered in ice, which sometimes lies in layers that are more than 4km thickin the region. These active peaks are concentrated in a region known as the westAntarctic rift system, which stretches 3,500km from Antarctica’s Ross ice shelfto the Antarctic peninsula.Geologists say this huge region is likely to dwarf that of east Africa’svolcanic ridge, currently rated the densest concentration of volcanoes in theworld.[87] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn87] [../images/00009.jpeg]Figure 8. Newly discovered buried volcanoes in Antarctica These fresh scientific findings support Tompkins and Goode’s claims that theGermans had found or been led to a natural cavern system deep under theAntarctic ice that could provide a temperate environment to support a largebase(s).Goode also reports that he was taken on a secret tour of several of the naturalcaverns found under the Antarctic ice shelf in early 2016. He describes that onethermally heated cavern has been developed into a huge industrial area. Goodefurther provides an artistic depiction of what he saw [see Figure 9]. Moredetails of his alleged trip will be examined in chapter 11. Very significantly,the scientific findings just discussed were published after Goode made publichis report of large city-sized caverns naturally heated by volcanic activity.Therefore, these recent findings provide solid independent scientific supportfor Goode’s prior claims. All of the building and developments taking placeunder the ice is the direct result of the Germans being guided to one of morethese extensive underground cavern systems prior to the start of World War II. [../images/00010.jpeg]Figure 9. Illustration of Corey Goode’s description of secret space port underAntarctica. Courtesy of www.Gaia.com Back in the late 1930’s, the establishment of Nazi Antarctic bases became acause of real concern for President Roosevelt. He issued orders for theundertaking of a military expedition to challenge the Nazi’s growing presence inregions of Antarctica regarded as part of the Western Hemisphere. The New YorkTimes reported on July 7, 1939: President Roosevelt moved today to prevent possible extension of Germany’sclaims to Antarctic areas into the Western Hemisphere by directing Real AdmiralRichard E. Byrd to leave in October to territory within the sphere of influenceof the Monroe Doctrine … it [is] apparent that this government was prepared totake the position, if necessary, that any attempts by foreign powers toestablish bases west of the 180th meridian in the Antarctic would be consideredan unfriendly act …[88] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn88] During World War II, extensive submarine activity in the region of Antarcticaindicated that the Nazis were building more bases, in addition to the oneCaptain Ritscher’s expedition had established. US Navy spies reported that onceit became possible, major German companies involved in the Nazi’s militaryindustrial complex began moving equipment, resources and personnel down toAntarctica, using Nazi Germany’s vast fleet of submarines, according to WilliamTompkins. Companies such as I.G. Farben, Krupp, Siemens, Messershmitt, UnitedSteelworks, etc., were just some of many involved in the Antarctica operationswhich Tompkins specifically recalls from the Navy spies’ intel.[89][part0000_split_079.html#_edn89]Having had access to this very same information from 1987 to 2007, Corey Goodeis able to verify from memory reading similar things to points expressed inTompkins’ testimony. Goode confirms the German Secret Societies were in chargeof the Antarctica operations, not Hitler’s Nazi Government, with leadingcorporations involved in the construction activities taking place there – usingforced labor.[90] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn90]The vast Antarctica operations were orchestrated by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris,head of German Military Intelligence (1935-1944), who used his previousexperience in the covert rebuilding of Germany’s submarine fleets after WorldWar I to do something very similar in Antarctica. This time it would bespacecraft, and not just submarines, that Canaris would arrange to be builtusing an international network of German companies and banks, along with theirforeign partners. As mentioned earlier, Canaris worked closely with the ThuleSociety in achieving its long term goals, with debate only remaining as towhether or not he was a full member.Rudolf Hess, and other well-known Thule Society colleagues who had infiltratedthe Nazi Party, worked closely with Canaris in directing substantial resourcesdown to Antarctica. The German Navy was a key component at this time, since onlyit could provide the large cargo submarines Type X (XB) U-boats which were builtby a Krupp subsidiary in Kiel) to move all that was necessary down toAntarctica. More importantly, the inherent similarities between submarine andspacecraft construction, plus the congruent crew training for both types ofvehicle operations, made the German Navy the military service most suited tolead Antarctic operations.The goals of the Thule Society/Nazis/German Navy were threefold when it came toAntarctica. The first was to locate and convert vast caverns found deep underthe Antarctic ice into fully equipped bases that could host large numbers ofpersonnel and equipment. Secondly, to establish large manufacturing plants inAntarctica for building fleets of spacecraft capable of interplanetary and,eventually, interstellar flight. Finally, the last goal was to establishAntarctica as a safe haven from the vicissitudes of another European war.Hitler was carefully steered into believing that the impervious bastion beingbuilt in Antarctica would ensure his personal future welfare. Certainly, this iswhat Admiral Karl Donitz implied when he bragged about the remote (Antarctica)base on three separate occasions, and how it would provide a safe haven forHitler if he ever required it.In 1943, Donitz is reported to have made his first statement: “the Germansubmarine fleet is proud of having built for the Führer, in another part of theworld, a Shangri-La on land, an impregnable fortress.”[91][part0000_split_079.html#_edn91] The second occasion was in 1944, when herevealed how plans were in place to relocate Hitler so he could launch a neweffort for his thousand-year Reich: The German Navy will have to accomplish a great task in the future. The GermanNavy knows all hiding places in the oceans and therefore it will be very easy tobring the Führer to a safe place should the necessity arise and in which he willhave the opportunity to work out his final plans.[92][part0000_split_079.html#_edn92] Donitz’s reference to the German Navy’s knowledge of “all hiding places in theoceans” shows once again how central the Navy was to the entire Antarcticaoperation.Finally, Dönitz’s remarks at his Nuremberg war crime trial clearly identifiedAntarctica as the place where Germany’s most advanced technologies had beensecretly relocated by their Navy’s large submarine fleet. At the trial heboasted of “an invulnerable fortress, a paradise-like oasis in the middle ofeternal ice.” [93] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn93] A world famous Austrian cartographer and artist, Professor Heinrich C. Berann,provides exciting proof that Donitz’s statements are entirely plausible. Berannworked for the National Geographic Society beginning in 1966, and later ColombiaUniversity and the US Navy, creating ocean floor maps. In 1972, he rendered amap of Antarctic without its mantle of ice, notably displaying underwaterpassageways that ran throughout the continent.[94][part0000_split_079.html#_edn94] This distinguished map substantiates thenaturally existing routes in which submarines could travel under the ice forconsiderable distances, to Nazi Germany’s “invulnerable fortress”, via a naturalcavern system buried under nearly two miles of ice in places.A more recent detailed map of what lies under the ice sheets of Antarctica wasprovided by the U.S. National Science Foundation in 2013.[95][part0000_split_079.html#_edn95] Extensive river systems and lakes were foundunder the ice sheets, once again affirming a plausible means of navigating underAntarctica, just as Tompkins and Goode have described (see Figure 11). [../images/00011.jpeg]Figure 10. Illustration of Ice Free Antarctica by Heinrich Berann. [../images/00012.jpeg]Figure 11. Credit: U.S. National Science FoundationAdmiral Donitz’s claims are further supported by documents, provided by analleged German submarine crewman after the war, which give detailed instructionsfor U-Boat Captains to reach the Antarctica bases through the hiddenpassageways. Figure 12 displays an image of the document with the translatedinstructions. [96] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn96] [../images/00013.jpeg]Figure 12. Directions to Antarctic bases – translated from original in German In the supply and secret construction of the Antarctica bases through theKriegsmarine’s submarine fleet, Admiral Donitz worked closely with AdmiralCanaris. When Hitler relieved Canaris of his post as chief of the German’smilitary intelligence service (the Abwehr) and transferred its control toHimmler’s SS in March 1944, Donitz reassigned Canaris to exclusive service withthe navy.[97] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn97] Canaris would now concentrate onsupporting the wholescale movement of resources and personnel for the secretAntarctica facilities. On July 1, 1944, Canaris was appointed by Hitler to headthe “Special Staff for Anti-Shipping Warfare and Economic War Measures”, wherehe concentrated on Operation Eagle Flight; the transfer of industrial assets andNazi capital to neutral locations and Antarctica.[98][part0000_split_079.html#_edn98]According to Michael Mueller, author of an authoritative biography on Canaris,after the failed assassination attempt against Hitler on July 20, 1944, Canariswas implicated as the “spiritual founder of the resistance movement.”[99][part0000_split_079.html#_edn99] He was arrested three days later, and after hispersonal diaries were found in the beginning of April 1945, he was summarilytried and then executed at Flossenberg Concentration Camp on April 7.[100][part0000_split_079.html#_edn100]William Tompkins, however, contradicts this scenario and says the US Navy spiesreported this was all a sham – Canaris was secretly taken to Antarctica to playa leading role in directing future Antarctica operations. If Canaris’imprisonment, trial and execution were indeed staged, then it was a brilliantploy in misdirecting Allied attention away from his critical role in setting up,supplying, funding and later leading the Antarctica bases established by GermanSecret Societies. "},{"pageContent":"GERMAN COMPANIES BEGIN FLYING SAUCER PRODUCTION Simultaneous flying saucer programs had been developed by Nazi Germany: one inOccupied Europe and the other in Antarctica. These programs were coordinatedduring the development and construction process for the creation of the 30prototype antigravity spacecraft the Navy spies came to report about in theirdebriefings, as Tompkins explains:They built the prototypes in Germany. They built pre-protype, something which isready for production, in Antarctica. They put this stuff in production in thecountries all over Germany [Occupied Europe], and they continued to buildsimilar vehicles in Antarctica.[101] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn101] There have been a number of authors that have analyzed the flying saucer reportsfrom Nazi Germany, and the development of these craft in classified facilities.Henry Stevens’ book, Hitler’s Flying Saucers (2003), provides the mostcomprehensive overview of the numerous newspaper reports and official documentsthat have appeared or surfaced.[102] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn102] Stevensand other authors have also included key interviews with scientists such asGiuseppi Belluzo and Rudolph Schriever, who each almost simultaneously went onthe public record in March 1950 about their participation in German flyingsaucer programs.[103] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn103]In addition, Stevens has analyzed “smoking gun” FBI documents containinginterviews with credible witnesses of such craft, helping to prove that theGermans were indeed building and testing saucer craft.[104][part0000_split_079.html#_edn104] Among these smoking gun documents are severalinvolving a Polish immigrant living in Texas, who describes his wartimeexperience of seeing a German flying saucer in a secure enclosure in 1944, whilehe was being held as a POW in Germany. A November 7, 1957 FBI Teletype gave asummary of the interview: UPON INTERVIEW ADVISED THAT WHILE GERMAN POW DURING NINETEEN FORTYFOUR OBSERVEDA VEHICLE DESCRIBED AS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, SEVENTY FIVE TO ONE HUNDRED YARDS INDIAMETER, APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN FEET HIGH.

FBI Teletype discussing Polish witness of German Flying Saucer. Additionally, the CIA took a keen interest in foreign newspaper reports offlying saucer sightings or, more specifically, Nazi Germany’s development ofsuch craft. One CIA document, dated 12 January 1954, gives a summary of famedGerman engineer, George Klein’s overview of the different flying saucer projectshe worked on in Nazi Germany: A German newspaper [not further identified] recently published an interview withGeorge Klein, famous German engineer and aircraft expert, describing theexperimental construction of “flying saucers” carried out by him from 1941 to1945. Klein stated that he was present when, in 1945, the first piloted “flyingsaucer” took off and reached a speed of 1,300 miles per hour within 3 minutes.The experiments resulted in three designs: one, designed by Miethe, was adisk-shaped aircraft, 135 feet in diameter, which did not rotate, anotherdesigned by Habermohl and Schriever, consisted of a large rotating ring, in thecenter of which was a round, stationary cabin for the crew. [106][part0000_split_079.html#_edn106] [../images/00015.jpeg]Figure 14. CIA document referring to Klein interview. What these FBI documents and newspaper reports clearly demonstrate is that theGermans were developing multiple flying saucer craft as part of the war effort.These sources give much information about the development and testing ofprototypes, but little information about the successfulness of any program. Infact, the overall conclusion emerging from official documents and newspaperreports is that the Germans had failed in developing any flying saucerprototypes that could be successfully operated, let alone used for the wareffort.Information about the overall scope of German saucer programs, and the companiesinvolved in any successful production models, has proven elusive. This is due tointelligence agencies from both NATO and former Warsaw Pact nations keeping atight hold on official documentation that would show any success by the Germans.That situation changed dramatically with a sequence of events that led to theofficial end of the Warsaw Pact on February 25, 1991. Intelligence files wereleaked and sold to the highest bidder by former intelligence operatives nowscrambling to financially survive in the chaos emerging from the collapse of thecommunist system. One of the former Warsaw Pact member states was Bulgaria, andmembers of its Academy of Sciences would certainly have been among thoseapproached by intelligence operatives eager to dispose any science related filesin their possession.Vladimir Terziski, a trained engineer and physicist, was a former member of theBulgarian Academy of Sciences before emigrating to the U.S. in 1984.[107][part0000_split_079.html#_edn107] He says that in 1991, he came into thepossession of a leaked documentary film from the Nazi SS archives revealingdifferent types of flying saucer craft built in Germany.[108][part0000_split_079.html#_edn108] Based on Terziski’s film, which he showed atpublic seminars from 1992 onwards, a number of documents began circulatingdescribing the testing and manufacturing of Nazi Germany’s successful flyingsaucer prototypes.One document describes the number of different Haunebu and Vril craft built forthe war effort, the number of test flights, and the propulsion systems thenavailable (see Fig 15). All the craft were assembled at a remote German locationdesignated as “Hauneburg”, which was later shortened to Haunebu from which thesuccessful prototypes got their designations. According to Nazi UFO historicalresearcher Rob Arndt, the Huaneburg site was chosen in 1935 by the ThuleSociety, but by 1942 the location was abandoned due to the changing warsituation. [109] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn109] Since the “Vril 1” was thefirst flying saucer craft to be developed in Nazi Germany, it’s worth beginningthis overview of the 17 craft mentioned in the document, which were flighttested over 80 times. [../images/00016.jpeg]Figure 15. Production statistics for German Flying Saucers. In his lectures, Terziski discusses the testing and operational performance ofthe Vril 1 craft, according to details contained in one of the Nazi SSdocuments: The first purely Vril disc – the Vril 1 Jager (Hunter) was constructed in 1941and first flew in 1942. It was 11.5 meters in diameter, had a single pilot, andcould achieve 2,900 km/h – 12,000 km/hr. It flew with a metal dome at first butsubsequent test versions had a heavily reinforced glass dome and could seat twocrew. Flight endurance was 5.5 hrs. It was planned to arm this craft with twoMK-108 cannon plus 2 MG-17 machineguns. Seventeen of these craft wereconstructed and tested between 1942-44 with 84 test flights.[110][part0000_split_079.html#_edn110] [../images/00017.jpeg]Figure 16. Vril 1 Specifications Next, the Nazi SS document states that two “Haunebu I” flying saucer craft werebuilt and test flown 52 times. According to Terziski’s information, the HaunebuI began testing in 1939, which Rob Arndt explains further: The early Haunebu I craft of which two prototypes were constructed were 25meters in diameter, had a crew of eight and could achieve the incredible initialvelocity of 4,800 km/h, but at low altitude. Further enhancement enabled themachine to reach 17,000 km/hr. Flight endurance was 18 hours. To resist theincredible temperatures of these velocities a special armor called Victalen waspioneered by SS metallurgists specifically for both the Haunebu and Vril seriesof disc craft. The Haunebu I had a double hull of Victalen. The early modelsalso attempted to test out a rather large experimental gun installation – thetwin 60mm KraftStrahlKanone (KSK) [a cannon] which operated off the Triebwerk[engine] for power. It has been suggested that the ray from this weapon made ita laser, but it was not.[111] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn111] I have yet to find any information on a metal alloy called “Victalen”, whichonly appears in sources that can be traced back to Terziski. However, HenryStevens investigated claims about advanced metal alloys being produced inGermany’s advanced aviation projects. He found substantial evidence thatesoteric metal alloys such as “Impervium” and “Lubricium” were indeed beingproduced, and some of these were brought to the U.S. for further development inclassified facilities.[112] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn112] Stevens cites ametallurgist from the former aerospace company TRW (now part of NorthrupGrumann) who responded to a question about whether such “super metals” had beencreated by Nazi Germany: It’s true. The Germans developed all sorts of alloys during the war. After thewar we took them – some of them were great – we took one and gave it a TRWnumber, and still market it today – we didn’t want to give the Germans creditthough.[113] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn113] It’s also worth recalling that Tompkins, who worked at TRW from 1967 to 1971,says that the Germans were helped by Reptilian extraterrestrials in advancedaerospace projects, including metallurgy. Consequently, major German steelcompanies such as Thyssens AG and Krupp were very likely heavily involved indeveloping unique metal alloys for the flying saucer programs. If so, it remainsa trade secret or classified to the present day, as the TRW metallurgistexpressed. Importantly, in 1999 Thyssens and Krupp merged to form one of theworld’s largest steel producers. ThyssenKrupp AG almost certainly continues toplay a key production role in the secret space program started by the Germans inAntarctica.It’s worth contrasting the top speed of the successful Haunebu I craft (4,800 to17,000 km/hr) with the model George Klein witnessed being tested in 1945 (1,300mph/2,200 km/hr). Clearly, there is a vast performance difference between thesuccessful and unsuccessful flying saucer prototypes under research anddevelopment.According to Terziski’s Nazi SS saucer production document, seven Haunebu IIwere built and test flown 106 times. He provided additional details on itsperformance, as Arndt illustrates: In 1942, the enlarged Haunebu II of 26 meters diameter was ready for flighttesting. This disc had a crew of nine and could also achieve supersonic flightof between 6,000-21,000 km/h with a flight endurance of 55 hours. Both it andthe further developed 32 meter diameter Do-Stra [Dornier Stratosphärenflugzeug]had heat shielding of two hulls of Victalen. Seven of these craft wereconstructed and tested between 1943-44. The craft made 106 test flights. [114][part0000_split_079.html#_edn114] Significantly, Terziski has identified Dornier Flugzeugwerke (Aircraft Plants)as the German corporation responsible for the successful Haunebu II prototype. By 1944, the perfected war model, the Haunebu II Do-Stra [Dornier DornierStratosphärenflugzeug] was tested. Two prototypes were built. These massivemachines, several stories tall, were crewed by 20 men. They were also capable ofhypersonic speed beyond 21,000 km/h. The SS had intended to produce the machineswith tenders for both Junkers and Dornier but in late 1944/early 1945 Dornierwas chosen.[115] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn115] Dornier operated as a privately held company from 1914 to 1996, when it wasacquired by the Fairchild Aircraft company in 1996, and eventually absorbed intoAirbus.[116] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn116] Terziski’s document reveals thatDornier’s successful model was put into production. [../images/00018.jpeg]Figure 17. Original Nazi SS Document of Haunebu II specifications [../images/00019.jpeg]Figure 18. Translation of Hanuebu 11 Specifications Next, we have the Haunebu III which Terziski’s document asserts only oneprototype was built and tested 19 times. Again, Arndt summarizes Terziski’sinformation: Yet larger still was the 71 meter diameter Haunebu III. A lone prototype wasconstructed before the close of the war. It was crewed by 32 and could achievespeeds of between 7,000 - 40,000 km/hr. It had a triple Victalen hull. It issaid to have had a flight endurance of between 7-8 weeks! The craft made 19 testflights. This craft was to be used for evacuation work for Thule and Vril inMarch 1945. [117] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn117] It’s important to note that the Earth’s escape velocity is 40,270 km/hr (25,020mph), which means that the Haunebu III was capable of leaving Earth’s orbit. Itis therefore the world’s first spacecraft.Terziski explains that Vril and Haunebu models possessed an electro-graviticspropulsion system called Thule-Tachyonator drives. These were first developed in1939 by the Nazi SS E-IV development unit, which was part of the “Order of theBlack Sun” according to researcher Rob Arndt: This group developed by 1939 a revolutionary electro-magnetic-gravitic enginewhich improved Hans Coler’s free energy machine into an energy Konverter coupledto a Van De Graaf band generator and Marconi vortex dynamo [a spherical tank ofmercury] to create powerful rotating electromagnetic fields that affectedgravity and reduced mass. It was designated the Thule Triebwerk [Thrustwork,a.ka. Tachyonator-7 drive] and was to be installed into a Thule designeddisc.[118] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn118] Terziski contends that by 1943 the German companies Siemens and AEG had builtassembly lines for mass production of the Thule-Tachyonator drives that poweredthe Vril and Haunebu flying saucers, which were soon moved to Antarctica. [../images/00020.jpeg]Figure 19. Thule-Tachyonator Drive Siemens played a critical role in building the Hans Coler free energy devicethat powered not only the German Navy’s most advanced submarines, but its secretfleet of flying saucers. Henry Stevens, author of Hitler’s Suppressed andStill-Secret Weapons, Science and Technology, writes: The Magnestromapparat was fully developed and completed by 1933 with the help ofvon Unuh and Fraz Haid of Siemens-Schukert. This means that the Siemens firm, inspite of later denials (or memory losses) has known of free energy andspecifically the Hans Coler device since the early 1930s…. In 1943 Coler and hiswork, ended up at the O.K.M or the German Navy.[119][part0000_split_079.html#_edn119] Finally, when it comes to advanced weapons systems, energy production and spacemedicine, the industrial conglomerate I.G. Farben played the vital role inoverseeing these areas for the two German space programs. I.G. Farben has been apioneer in many advanced research topics, including being among the firstcompanies to develop laser weapons, which were supplied for the successfulflying saucer prototypes that were eventually sent down to Antarctica. HenryStevens uncovered documents showing that the Allied powers had learned aboutI.G. Farben scientists being involved in the development and testing of laserweapons that produced devastating effects: It is also interesting to note that the Allies were given a list of scientistswho participated in the laser experimentation at I.G. Farben ... Besides thedetail of the layout, it is most impressive to note that when the test targetsof the weapon, rats, were hit with the ray, their bodies glowed for a fractionof a second before they completely disintegrated. [120][part0000_split_079.html#_edn120] These laser weapons were used in their ruinous capacity (as will be shown in thenext chapter) against the 1946/1947 Operation Highjump mission launched by theUS Navy.In addition, I.G. Farben was internationally known for its pioneering medicalresearch, which was essential for enabling German astronauts to safely fly intospace.[121] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn121] Significantly, Tompkins claimsthat the Reptilians supplied the Germans with information on advanced medicalsubjects such as cloning and age regression, which the Nazis investedsignificant resources into developing for the war effort.[122][part0000_split_079.html#_edn122] I.G. Farben’s Nobel Prize winning scientistswould have been among those tasked to initiate the research and development ofthese and other esoteric medical subjects. Therefore, as the war effortfaltered, I.G. Farben was among the companies instructed to take resources outof Germany and its scientists were included with those secretly moved toAntarctica.It was the Thule Society, and their secret society brethren, who had thoroughlyinfiltrated the Nazi government and were actually running the Antarcticaoperations, while also maintaining control of the German companies that builtthe prototype antigravity spacecraft. The key Nazi official who oversaw theentire Antarctica operation from its inception in 1938/1939 was Admiral Canaris.His principal loyalty was never to Hitler, however, but to the nationalistagenda espoused by German Naval Intelligence and the Thule Society, whichincreasingly came into conflict with Hitler’s reckless militaristic policiesthat culminated in World War II.This is why leading industrialists such as Fritz Thyssen opposed Hitler’sdecision to invade Poland and start World War II, and why Canaris led effortsbehind the scenes to depose Hitler during the 1938 Czech crisis. While the ThuleSociety and German Naval Intelligence supported Hitler’s rise to power and couldinfluence his policies in a nationalist direction, they could not fully controlhim when it came to larger issues of war and peace. Their best option in thisdifficult situation was to independently develop the Antarctica operations, andexclude Hitler and his Nazi SS henchmen from controlling those operations.As the tide of World War II turned, Hitler became desperate and demanded thatthe “wonder weapons” which were being developed in Antarctica be used for theWar effort. According to Corey Goode, the German Secret Societies refused: I think that there were [some] technologies acquired and integrated into theirbreakaway secret space program that they were developing. But they weredeveloping this for their own [purposes] when it came down to it, they didn’tcare about [Germany winning] World War II, the motherland, [or] using thistechnology to defeat the United States and the enemies they were engaged in warwith.[123] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn123] When Hitler learned, through his Nazi SS subordinates, that the Antarcticaoperations had gone rogue and would not provide advanced weapons systems for thewar effort, he became furious. In February 1944, Canaris was removed from power,and the German Abwehr (military intelligence) was soon after absorbed intoHimmler’s SS.However, The Thule Society succeeded in establishing Antarctica as a powerfulfortified base, outside of Hitler’s control because of their able handlers, whoensured that he would not interfere with their plans there for buildingantigravity spacecraft capable of interplanetary and interstellar operations.The first handler of Hitler up to 1941, was his deputy Führer, Rudolf Hess.Hess’ career came to an end, as previously discussed, after he attempted to endthe war with the United Kingdom through secret negotiations with the Britisharistocracy, but was captured when the Churchill faction learned of the peacemission.[124] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn124]Hitler’s second handler was Hess’ replacement, Martin Bormann, who assumed allthe functions of Deputy Fuehrer, which placed him in the role of chief of thenewly created office of Party Chancellery. Bormann also worked closely with theThule Society and German industrialists who well understood how Hitler’sextremism was leading Germany to military and financial ruin. Bormann was thekey Nazi official who assisted German industrialists in an elaborate “capitalflight plan”, assuring that a Fourth Reich would emerge out of the ashes ofWorld War II. "},{"pageContent":"FINANCIAL FOUNDATIONS FOR A FOURTH REICH AND ANTARCTIC DEVELOPMENT After early military successes, the Nazis began experiencing major setbacks inthe war against the Soviet Union. Their defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943,during which the entire German 6th Army was destroyed, signified that the tidehad decisively turned and the Soviet Union was going to prevail in the war.German industrialists saw the writing on the wall and made preparations for themovement of large financial resources to safe locations in various neutralcountries, South America and Antarctica.Curt Reis, a well-known news correspondent during World War II, describes thefirst meeting held by industrialists who began to prepare for the likely defeat: In May 1943, in the wake of the defeat at Stalingrad, Reiss said Germanindustrialists met in Chateau Huegel near Essen, home of the Krupps, andreviewed the situation of their nation. The decision was to distance Germancommerce from the Nazi regime, Reiss wrote, adding: “All future changesdiscussed at the meeting centered around the idea of divorcing German industryas far as possible from Nazism as such. Krupp [von Bohlen und Halbach] and [I.G. Farben Director Georg von] Schnitzler declared that it would be much easierfor them to work after the war if the world were certain that German industrywas not owned and run by the Nazis. He said that Goering as well as otherinfluential party men saw eye to eye with him on this, and would consent to anyarrangement that did not involve the prestige of the party.”[125][part0000_split_079.html#_edn125] Admiral Canaris, with the help of Bormann, assisted the worried Germanindustrialists in their capital flight plans. Canaris was an old hand in movinglarge amounts of capital around the world, and Bormann quickly learned whatneeded to be done.After the Allied Powers successfully landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944, andestablished a long anticipated beachhead for the Western Front, Bormann andleading industrialists became desperate to quickly move capital and resourcesout of Germany to neutral international locations and Antarctica. On August 10,1944, Bormann secretly convened a meeting of leading German industrialists andinstructed his emissary, SS Obergruppenfuhrer (equivalent to Lieutenant General)Dr. Scheid, to tell them the war was lost.A US Army Intelligence File, called the “Red House Report”, provides importantdetails into the German companies that worked with Bormann in the Nazi capitalflight plan. This document, dated November 7, 1944, describes how Germanindustrialists were told to evacuate all available assets to neutral countriesusing hundreds of shell companies designed to hide the massive out-flow of Nazicapital and industrial resources.[126] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn126] [../images/00021.jpeg]Figure 20. Red House Report The ultimate source of secret orders approving the Nazi capital flight,according to Paul Manning, author of the book Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, wasBormann; whose influence over the Nazi Party increasingly grew as Hitler becamedespondent over an impending military defeat.[127][part0000_split_079.html#_edn127] This fact is exemplified in Scheid’sinvolvement as SS, which reveals that Himmler was also aware that Bormann hadthe reins of authority to launch such an initiative, and that the Nazi SS wouldsupport Bormann.Bormann was explicit in his instructions of how financial assets must be sentout of Germany, and this plan was relayed through Scheid: From now on also German industry must realize that the war cannot be won andthat it must take steps in preparation for a post-war commercial campaign. Eachindustrialist must make contacts and alliances with foreign firms, but this mustbe done individually and without attracting any suspicion. Moreover, the groundwould have to be laid on the financial level for borrowing considerable sumsfrom foreign countries after the war.[128] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn128] The greater goal of Bormann’s plan was to enable and ensure by covert economicmeans the emergence of a new German Empire, a Fourth Reich, as also described inthe report: [I]t was stated that the Nazi Party had informed the industrialists that the warwas practically lost but that it would continue until a guarantee of the unityof Germany could be obtained. German industrialists must, it was said, throughtheir exports increase the strength of Germany. They must also preparethemselves to finance the Nazi Party which would be forced to go underground asMaquis (in Gebirgaverteidigungastellen gehen). From now on the government wouldallocate large sums to industrialists so that each could establish a securepost-war foundation in foreign countries. Existing financial reserves in foreigncountries must be placed at the disposal of the Party so that a strong GermanEmpire can be created after the defeat. [129] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn129] Bormann arranged for the creation of 750 front companies for the Nazi capitalflight plan called Operation Eagle. Both Fritz Thyssen and the I.G. Farbenconglomerate were vital to this operation: As part of this plan, Bormann, aided by the black-clad SS, the central DeutscheBank, the steel empire of Fritz Thyssen, and the powerful I. G. Farben combine,created 750 foreign front corporations – 58 in Portugal, 112 in Spain, 233 inSweden, 214 in Switzerland, 35 in Turkey, and 98 in Argentina. [130][part0000_split_079.html#_edn130] The giant chemical conglomerate I.G. Farben, which in itself formed a statewithin a state, had extensive international partners that were used for thecapital flight plan: [U.S.] Treasury investigations discovered Farben documents that showed the firmmaintained an interest in more than 700 companies around the world. This numberdid not include Farben’s normal corporate structure, which covered ninety-threecountries, nor the 750 corporations created under Bormann’s flight capitalprogram. I. G. Farben also was at the hub of money transfers out of NaziGermany. Even before the end of the war, for example, “I. G. Latin Americanfirms all maintained, unrecorded, in their books, secret cash accounts in banksin the names of their top officials,” wrote Manning. These were used to receiveand to disburse confidential payments; firms dealing with Farben wanted thisbusiness but certainly did not wish it known to British and United Stateseconomic authorities.”[131] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn131] A US Army Report prepared for the prosecution of I.G. Farben executives at theNurenburg War Crimes describe how Farben had become adept at hiding its assetsinternationally, and exercising control through a variety of economic tools: The company cloaked its direct and indirect ownership and control of hundreds ofits foreign subsidiaries by utilizing every conceivable device known to thelegal and “extra legal” mind, including the use of nominees, option agreements,fictions or intervening transfers, dividend and loan agreements, poolagreements, endorsements in blank escrow deposits, pledges, collateral loans,rights of first refusal, management contracts, service contracts, patentagreements, cartels and withholding know-how. Geheimrat Hermann Schmitz, I.G’spresident, was known throughout the industrial world as “the master of financialcamouflage.”[132] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn132] It’s worth mentioning that the Dulles’ brothers, through their legal firm,Sullivan and Cromwell, helped I.G. Farben establish its shady internationalfinancial network prior to WWII.Fritz Thyssen, though under Nazi House Arrest due to his opposition to Hitler’swar policies, was heavily involved in Operation Eagle Flight (AktionAdlerflug).[133] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn133] His old U.S. partners andassociates were invaluable in helping Nazi capital reach safe locations: Bormann’s Operation Eagle Flight was substantially helped by the closeconnections with foreign banks and businesses begun long before the war.According to former U.S. Department of Justice Nazi War Crimes prosecutor JohnLoftus, much of the wealth was passed out of Germany by German banker FritzThyssen through his bank in Holland, which, in turn, owned the Union BankingCorporation (UBC) in New York City.[134] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn134] Thyssen used his Dutch bank to transfer Nazi capital, with help from his NewYork associates, which included Prescott Bush: Thyssen did not need any foreign bank accounts because his family secretly ownedan entire chain of banks. He did not have to transfer his Nazi assets at the endof World War II, all he had to do was transfer the ownership documents – stocks,bonds, deeds, and trusts – from his bank in Berlin through his bank in Hollandto his American friends in New York City: Prescott Bush and Herbert Walker.Thyssen’s partners in crime were the father and father-in-law of a futurepresident of the United States.”[135] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn135] The success of the Nazi capital flight program is revealed by Paul Manning’sdescription of its impact on the modern era: [T]he 750 new corporations established under the Bormann program, gavethemselves absolute control over a postwar economic network of viable,prosperous companies that stretched from the Ruhr to the “neutrals” of Europeand to the countries of South America; a control that continues today and iseasily maintained through the bearer bonds or shares issued by thesecorporations to cloak real ownership.[136] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn136] According to Manning, Allied governments turned a blind eye to Nazi capitalflight since there were significant financial benefits for major U.S. andBritish corporations: They had understandable reasons, if you overlook morality: the financialbenefits for cooperation (collaboration had become an old-hat term with the warwinding down) were very enticing, depending on one’s importance and ability tobe of service to the organization and the 750 corporations they were secretlymanipulating, to say nothing of the known multinationals such as I.G. Farben,Thyssen A.G., and Siemens.[137] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn137] Another key factor to keep in mind here is that Allen Dulles, who ran the Swissheadquarters of the Office of Strategic Services (forerunner to the CIA) wasorchestrating secret deals with Nazi authorities that would allow significantwar resources to fall into U.S., rather than Soviet, hands. Indeed, the captureof U-boat 234 carrying enriched uranium was likely part of a deal where the U.S.would be assisted in developing atomic bombs, in exchange for not interferingwith Operation Eagle Flight, and allowing prominent Nazis such as Hitler andBormann to escape.[138] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn138]Martin Bormann was able to escape to Argentina after the end of hostilities inEurope in May 1945, as documented by multiple researchers, including historianPaul Manning.[139] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn139] In addition to Bormann,Adolf Hitler also escaped to Argentina and lived out his exile years in therelative comfort of Bariloche, according to a number of official governmentdocuments and eyewitness testimonies assembled by historians such as HarryCooper.[140] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn140] In October 2017, newlydeclassified CIA files contained a new batch of Kennedy Assassination documents,which remarkably included reports of Hitler visiting Colombia and Argentina!In one document, a former Nazi SS Stormtrooper, Philip Citroen, reports havingmet with Hitler while visiting Columbia in 1955. He discusses a photograph takenof Hitler while in Columbia, who at the time was using a pseudonym. It is theonly known photo of Hitler taken after the end of World War II that shows heboth survived and was living in exile in South America. In the document, a CIAsource with the codename CIMELODY-3 reports on what she/he learned from atrusted friend: CIMELODY-3’s friend stated that during the latter part of September 1955, aPhillip CITROEN, former German SS trooper, stated to him confidentially thatAdolph HITLER is still alive. CITROEN claimed to have contacted HITLER aboutonce a month in Colombia on his trip from Maracaibo to that country as anemployee of the KNSM (Royal Dutch) Shipping Co. in Maracaibo. CITROEN indicatedto CIMELODY-3’s friend that he took a picture with HITLER not too long ago, butdid not show the photograph. He also stated that HITLER left Colombia forArgentina around January 1955. CITROEN commented that in as much as ten yearshave passed since the end of World War II, the Allies could no longer prosecuteHITLER as a criminal of war.[141] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn141] [../images/00022.jpeg]Figure 21. Report about sighting of Adolf Hitler in Colombia [../images/00023.jpeg]Figure 22. Alleged photo of Adolf Hitler in Colombia in 1955 It’s important to keep in mind that the CIA has withheld the files from publicrelease for over 50 years since President Kennedy’s assassination on nationalsecurity grounds. It is plausible that their release was considered dangerous asit raised a possible connection between a rumored 4th Reich and the KennedyAssassination, which will be explored further in chapter seven."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 THE NAZI RETREAT TO ANTARCTICA & SOUTH AMERICA "},{"pageContent":"THE ANTARCTIC EXODUS The ‘official’ defeat of Nazi Germany in May 1945 was in fact only a ‘tacticalvictory’ masking a major strategic defeat withstood by the ‘victorious Allies’.This potentially devastating secret was kept from the general public in thedecades to follow. The Allies would not admit that a significant proportion ofNazi Germany’s political elite, their most advanced technology and fullyoperational ‘flying saucers’ had escaped from their occupation forces.[142][part0000_split_079.html#_edn142] The US Navy spies discovered this Nazi exodus,according to William Tompkins, and reported on it in their debriefings at NavalAir Station, San Diego up to early 1946.In a private interview, I asked Tompkins whether the Nazis took everything overto Antarctica at a certain point before the war’s end. He replied: Yes. And that include everything medical. Okay? Everything in a hospital.Everything in research. Everything in drugs. All of that stuff went down thereinto Antarctica. And so, when the war stopped and we got Paperclip, that wasonly part of what had originally been operating a year before in Germany….Actually, operatives talked about specific different German people heading upprograms. Just they’ve flew these names off this ledger [sic]. You couldn’tbelieve it. On different programs, even on the medical research side. It went toRussia, and so like [on] a 20:1 or something ratio. We got good ones, but thebest ones went to Antarctica and to support programs.[143][part0000_split_079.html#_edn143] These events revealed by Tompkins are confirmed by Corey Goode based on his ownreading of documents in an SSP digital archive describing the German exodus toAntarctica. Goode now concludes that the documents he read during his “20 andback” service were based on Tompkins’ earlier briefing packets: I'm really beginning to believe that a lot of his briefings during the timeperiod – 1942 – were what made it into the database that I was reading on thesmart glass pad, you know, like 30 [40] years ago … we were viewing old typesetdocuments.[144] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn144] Support for Tompkins and Goode’s claims of Navy intelligence documents detailingwhat really occurred at the end of World War II come from a number of sources.Richard Wilson and Sylvia Burns state they saw classified documents whileresearching their book, “Secret Treaty: The United States Government andExtra-terrestrial Entities. This is what they say they discovered about NaziGermany: The Germans in the scientific community knew the war was lost as early as 1942.They decided to establish a plan for continuing the dream of the Third Reichdespite the war. They decided that the establishment of a separate societyfounded on Nazi principles of genetic purity was the answer. The development ofgravitational technology aided that plan. On February 23, 1945, the newestengines of the Kugelbitz were tested and then extracted from the craft. TheKugelbitz was blown up by SS personnel and the scientists, plans and engineswere shipped out of Germany to the South Polar regions, where the Germans hadmaintained underground construction activity since 1941. Two days later, onFebruary 25, 1943 the underground plant at Khala was closed and all the workerssent to Buchenwald and gassed. The Germans also sent their \"aryan elite\"children and other elements of their society to the underground base. GeneralHans Kammler, who disappeared in April 1945, was instrumental in the evacuationoperation, as was General Nebe. There, the Germans developed a eugenic societythat apparently is limited to a specific number of people. They're still there.Apparently they also maintain technical colonies in South America.[145][part0000_split_079.html#_edn145] Another compelling source reinforcing Tompkins and Goode’s claims is theanonymous CIA agent known as Kewper, who revealed that Nazi Germany’s mostadvanced flying saucer programs had been moved to South America and Antarcticaprior to the outbreak of the Second World War. The British had come up with photographs of the saucer craft in the 1930’s, andso we knew Germany had the saucer craft with ‘laser guns’ on them. Hitleractually sent out all the craft that they had to Argentina and Antarcticaapparently to make sure when he started WWII none of them would becaptured.[146] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn146] In an interview with Linda Moulton Howe, “Kewper” described some of the Nazicraft that had been relocated from Peenemunde to South America: [Howe] You did have a photograph that confirmed the Germans were still flyingsome of their Peenemunde craft in South America?[Kewper] Oh, yeah! The craft with a high center about 12-feet high – they alllook like Haunebu II’s. Although they could be alien craft as well. But welabeled those photos as being German craft from Argentina. However, on radar, weused to see some of the real alien craft come from outer space right down intothe Argentina region. We also saw craft come into the Antarctica region fromouter space via radar we shared with the British down in the Falkland Islands inthe South Atlantic Ocean east of Argentina…. In 1959 to 1960, our unit wasseparating alien craft from the known German craft by the appearance of thecraft. We always found the German craft to be much slower in speed than thealien craft. Some alien craft were tracked from outer space doing something like30,000 mph![147] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn147] What remained of Nazi Germany’s advanced weapons programs was disturbing enoughin terms of the overall technological advances achieved by the Nazis in manyfields of weapons production.[148] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn148] However,discovering that the Germans had removed their most advanced secrets, technologyand personnel during the run up to the final defeat of Nazi Germany would havebeen an outright shock to Allied leaders once they realized what hadoccurred.[149] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn149] Rather than the final months ofWorld War II being the last desperate gamble by a megalomaniac Nazi leadershipthat could not accept inevitable defeat, it was in fact a holding action for amethodically well planned extraction of the Nazi’s most valuable resources andpersonnel to well-prepared remote locations in the Antarctic and South America.Kammler’s successful negotiations with the Allied forces only involved thesecond tier of advanced technologies developed by the Nazi regime.The Nazis had sufficient time and resources to prepare for such an exodus giventheir extensive business links, front companies, and connections with SouthAmerican governments and companies. The Fraternity, as stated earlier, was atransnational group of industrialists and national elites who had extensivebusiness ties, for whom World War II was little more than a hiccup in theirlucrative business relationships. The well-equipped Nazi expeditions to theAntarctic in the pre-war period allowed the Germans to familiarize themselveswith the terrain, and lay the foundations for any post-war role to be played bythis territory.After Germany’s unconditional surrender on May 8, 1945, Nazi submarine activityin the Antarctic region continued as evidenced by the following report presentedby the Agence France Press on September 25, 1946: [T]he continuous rumors about German U-boat activity in the region of Tierra delFuego [‘Feuerland’ in German] between the southernmost tip of Latin America andthe continent of Antarctica are based on true happenings. [150][part0000_split_079.html#_edn150] What compounded this realization by the Allies over the Nazi elite exodus toAntarctica was evidence that the Vril Society had been successful in contactingextraterrestrial races, and an advanced civilization based in the Earth’sinterior. Nazi cooperation with extraterrestrial life and/or ancient interiorEarth civilizations would now be a surreal factor in the Allies pursuing anderadicating the remnants of Nazi Germany which had relocated to distant lands.The Vril Society’s saucer program had achieved operational success well beforethe Nazi defeat. Orsic had ensured that the Vril Society program was notdirectly associated with the war effort, so this made it possible for them tomove most of their technologies, infrastructure and personnel to safe locationsin Antarctica and South America. In a private interview, Tompkins described howOrsic’s flying saucer program was allowed to move to Antarctica, and why it waskept separate from the Nazi SS program: She [Orsic] had two other girls who she actually knew from when they were justkids. So, the three of them were sort of the principals of initiating all thiseffort in the 1,442, whatever, people involved in that first build [of thecivilian space program]. Those were like hundreds and hundreds of people thatwere brought into this thing later on and developing all this, but none of them,to my knowledge, went to Antarctica like the pretty girls did. So, it's amassive amount of information. Space transports, different programs. Herinvolvement with the SS, Michael [the author], she started it, okay, because theNordics gave her the information originally and this was like a year beforeanything was picked up with the SS. There were two separate programs going, hersand the SS. And then when the SS finds out about her and everything that she'sgetting and doing, they confiscated everything that she had, and all the peoplethat were working for her, with her.And then somebody got smart over there on the SS side and said, “Hey, this isthe second group of extraterrestrials, not just the Nordics, the Reptilians thatare helping us, but we got Nordics too.” So, they gave everything back to her.Okay? She was allowed, Michael, to – She didn’t want anything to be military.And of course, the only thing the SS wanted, The Third Reich, well, was allmilitary, but here were two separate areas found out about.[151][part0000_split_079.html#_edn151] It’s important to keep in mind Orsic’s disdain for the Nazi SS and its effortsto militarize space technologies that she had played a key role in initiallydeveloping. She was part of a far more pacific German mindset that emphasizedcosmic philosophy and peace, based on correct use of the Vril Force. Orsic’sskillful ability to maintain her own Vril space program in Antarctica wouldlater prove to be pivotal in the development of the Space Brotherssocial/philosophical movement that erupted in the 1950’s.The large scale movement of Himmler’s SS personnel and resources to Antarcticdid not happen until very late in the war. The SS advanced weapons projectsunder Kammler’s authority had failed in its last ditch effort to weaponizeflying saucers in time to turn the tide of the war. Kammler moved whateverinfrastructure and operational flying saucer craft he could before the advancingallied armies reached the top secret SS production centers in Pilsen,Czechoslovakia and elsewhere. This is how author and researcher W.A. Harbinsondescribes the Nazi SS retreat to Antarctica according to documents he witnessed: [I]n March 1945, just before the end of the war, two German provision U-boats,U-530 and U-977 were launched from a port on the Baltic Sea. Reportedly theytook with them members of the flying saucer research teams, the last of the mostvital flying saucer components, the notes and drawings for the saucer, and thedesigns for gigantic underground complexes and living accommodations based onthe remarkable underground factories of Nordhausen in the Harz Mountains. Thetwo U-boats duly reached Neuschwabenland, more correctly known as Queen MaudLand, where they unloaded.[152] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn152] In response to a question about the role of Orsic and the Vril Society inpost-war Nazi bases, Goode explains: She has obviously made it to the Antarctic Bases/Cities…. I do know that these“Societies” were very much the backbone of what survived the war and who were incontrol of the facilities along with the group they believed was ET, as well asthe [Reptilian] Draco Federation that they allied themselves with.[153][part0000_split_079.html#_edn153] This is a very revealing statement. The Vril Society and its allies in the Thuleand Black Sun societies, had not only successfully maintained their independencefrom Himmler’s SS, but now they were in a leadership position in the Antarcticfacilities. The Nazi defeat led to incorporating the remaining portion ofKammler’s weaponized flying saucer program into the operational secret spaceprogram developed by the Vril, Thule and Black Sun societies, which had goneundetected and undamaged through World War II.The German alliance’s involvement with Draconian extraterrestrials led to theReptilians helping the Nazis establish their Antarctica bases, according to whatTompkins says he heard during the Navy spies’ debriefings: The fact that the Germans were given this information from the Reptilians. Theyset up the program, they designed the program to support Germany, and they aregiving Germany the UFOs…. Now in addition to that, they [Nazis] had, if you wantto call them, “consultants”, who are Reptilian consultants assisting on all ofthese different things that it takes to design and build these spacecraftcarriers, and propulsion systems. So this is an extremely well developed programand documented like crazy. Getting copies of the documents was hard for them,hard for our spies. This was an open program in the upper level of the SS.[154][part0000_split_079.html#_edn154] The success of the Vril Society in maintaining its independence from the NaziSS, and even assuming a leadership position in the breakaway society, shows howpowerful Vril, Thule and Black Sun leaders had become in Hitler’s totalitariansociety. Within their Antarctic bases, along with those in Argentina, the nowmerged Nazi SS and German Secret Society space programs had fully operational‘saucer ships’ that could move around the planet and even fly to a secret moonbase. According to reports from a number of military officials aware of theadvanced nature of the Nazi’s technology, many of the UFOs witnessed in theimmediate post war era were fully operational German spacecraft.[155][part0000_split_079.html#_edn155] "},{"pageContent":"OPERATION HIGHJUMP ENCOUNTERS NAZIS & ET ALLIES A U.S. effort to locate, take-over and/or destroy the Nazi Antarctica basesoccurred with a Naval military expedition led by Rear Admiral Richard Byrd in1946/47. Byrd’s military expedition to Antarctica was named “OperationHighjump”, and comprised “4700 military personnel, six helicopters, six MartinPBM flying boats, two seaplane tenders, fifteen other aircraft, thirteen US Navysupport ships and one aircraft carrier; the USS Philippine Sea.”[156][part0000_split_079.html#_edn156] Byrd received both classified and unclassifiedorders, an occurrence which is not unusual for Navy commanders. Yet for thegeneral public, only the unclassified reason for this expedition was released,explaining its purpose as largely scientific in terms of exploring, mapping, andfinding locations for future U.S. bases.Among the unclassified commands issued to Admiral Byrd from the Commander of theUS Navy, Admiral Chester Nimitz, were: a) train personnel and test material in the frigid zonesb) consolidate and extend American sovereignty over the largest practicalarea of the Antarctic continentc) to determine the feasibility of establishing and maintaining bases inthe Antarctic and to investigate possible base sitesd) to develop techniques for establishing and maintaining air bases on theice, (with particular attention to the later applicability of such techniques toGreenland)e) amplify existing knowledge of hydrographic, geographic, geological,meteorological and electromagnetic conditions in the area.[157][part0000_split_079.html#_edn157] These unclassified scientific reasons for the expedition were a strategic coverfor its critical classified purpose. As its size clearly suggested, Byrd’s Navalarmada was not conducting a scientific mission, but instead a militaryexpedition against a publicly unrevealed secret enemy.A year earlier during the South Pole summer of 1945/46, according to Tompkins,Admiral Byrd led a secret mission to Antarctica to negotiate with the leaders ofthe German colony established there. Further, the mission was unsuccessful, andByrd returned empty handed. In a private interview, Tompkins elaborated aboutthis event: [Q]: You have previously spoken about Admiral Byrd being privately taken toAntarctica in 1945/1946 (the year before Operation Highjump) where he attemptedto negotiate with Nazis there. Can you elaborate on what happened and why thenegotiations failed?[Tompkins]: Okay. Basically, it’s kind of simple. He didn’t have anything tobargain with. Okay? When they went down there, when he attempted to negotiate,if you want to say that, you know, he’s got [Inaudible] with nothing in it. Hedidn’t have any power at all. And so, it’s nothing more than an attempt atsomething that you know was not going to work. He had no bargaining power.[158][part0000_split_079.html#_edn158] The testimony of Navy Commander Graham Bethune, who says he was the actual pilotof the plane that took Byrd to Antarctica, supports Tompkins’ claims. Bethunetold Lieutenant Colonel Donald Ware (USAF, ret.) about this secret mission,which was one among the many he flew involving classified UFO/antigravity craft.Ware reported details of their personal conversation as follows: Graham Bethune was a friend of mine … He was the pilot who flew Admiral Byrd toAntarctica in 1945. Byrd was sent down there to find out what was going on. Hewas sent home early. But I think Byrd was able to negotiate U.S. scientistsjoining the German scientists in their underground base working on advancedtechnology.[159] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn159] The information Bethune shared serves as a harbinger of the close cooperationsoon to be developed between U.S. and German scientists, and the U.S. aerospaceindustry with their German partners; all beginning after a fateful agreement wasreached by political leaders.Due to the harsh seasonal conditions after the failed 1945/1946 mission, thenext Antarctic summer presented the first feasible opportunity to mount such alarge military deployment to the frigid regions of Antarctica. Yet, coming sosoon after the end of the Second World War, it is puzzling that such a sizablearmada would travel to Antarctica at a time of increasing Cold War tensions, intandem with the decommissioning of Naval personnel and ships, unless theexpedition was sent to militarily deal with some unresolved issues from the waritself. Specifically, to deal with the remnants of the Nazi elite hidden in anunderground base or bases established in the pre-war era. Byrd’s classifiedmission was therefore critical in its goal to locate, take-over and/or destroythe Nazi Antarctica bases.Ironically, before Captain Ritscher’s Schwabenland expedition departed forAntarctica on December 17, 1938, Admiral Byrd was invited to Nazi Germany as aguest of honor for its opening ceremony. In 1939, before the German Expedition, the only aerial photography undertaken inthe Antarctic had been that by the most famous U.S. expeditioner, Richard E Byrdin 1933. Byrd had visited the German Expedition in Hamburg at the invitation ofthe German Society of Polar Research which had the task of assembling andtraining the crew of the Expedition. The Society invited Byrd to join theExpedition and he met the crew and was given a tour of the preparations. Byrd,however, declined the offer, returning to the U S and taking command of the U SAntarctic Service at the request of President Roosevelt until that position wasended in its first year due the approach of World War II.[160][part0000_split_079.html#_edn160] As mentioned earlier, on July 8, 1939, Admiral Byrd first received orders fromPresident Roosevelt to locate and challenge any Nazi Antarctic bases that fellunder the U.S. sphere of influence.[161] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn161] Theorders were not carried out then, or during the U.S. entry into the war. Finallyin 1947, Admiral Byrd led a U.S. Naval Expedition to effectively deal with thebases it found that had been created or ‘discovered’ during and/or after the1938 Schwabenland expedition. Arguably, the Nazi Antarctic bases had nineuninterrupted years to prepare for this looming confrontation with the US Navy.The Byrd mission was scheduled to last up to six months, but ended in a mereeight weeks because it had, according to initial Chilean Press reports; “runinto trouble\" and there had been \"many fatalities[162][part0000_split_079.html#_edn162]\". If the true goal of the mission was tolocate and eradicate Nazi bases, the press reports and early end to the missionindicate a dismal failure and a rude awakening for the US Navy.The most commonly cited source for learning the truth behind the early end ofOperation Highjump is an interview Admiral Byrd gave to journalist, Lee VanAtta, in Santiago, Chile while traveling back to the U.S. in early March 1947.Van Atta’s article has many significant direct quotes from Byrd suggesting hewas eager to reveal the truth, so it appears he was later muzzled when hereturned to Washington, DC.[163] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn163] Van Atta’sarticle deserves close scrutiny of its key passages citing Byrd because thesegive the most accurate and honest assessment of what really took place inAntarctica.Van Atta’s article first appeared in the March 5, 1947 edition of El Mercurio and was titled, “Admiral Richard E. Byrd refers to the strategic importance ofthe poles” (see Figure 20). What follows are translated passages from theoriginal Spanish release: Admiral Richard E Byrd warned today of the necessity for the United States toadopt protective measures against the possibility of an invasion of the countryby hostile aircraft proceeding from the polar regions. The admiral said: 'I donot want to scare anybody but the bitter reality is that in the event of a newwar, the United States will be attacked by aircraft flying in from over one orboth poles.'”[164] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn164] This specific passage is the source of the original theory proposing that theSouth and North poles were the locations where a new enemy existed capable ofinitiating a “new war” against the United States. The reference to a “new war”clearly indicates that the entity involved is both hostile and powerful since itcan directly threaten mainland America from the South Pole. Van Atta continues: “On the subject of the recently terminated expedition, Byrd said that 'the mostimportant of the observations and discoveries made [were] … of the presentpotential situation as it relates to the security of the United States ... I cando no more than warn my countrymen very forcibly that the time has passed whenwe could take refuge in complete isolation and rest in confidence in theguarantee of security which distance, the oceans and the poles provide.'[165][part0000_split_079.html#_edn165] Here, Byrd is suggesting that the new enemy possesses advanced aerial craftwhose speed and range negated the protection previously enjoyed by the U.S. interms of vast oceans separating its mainland from Europe and Asia. [../images/00024.jpeg]Figure 23. Lee Van Atta article on Operation Highjump After the Soviet collapse in 1991, the KGB released previously classified filesthat cast light on the mysterious Byrd-led Naval expedition to Antarctica. Thisrelease included a 2006 Russian documentary which made public for the first timea 1947 secret Soviet intelligence report commissioned by Joseph Stalin on TaskForce 68’s [official name for Operation Highjump] mission to Antarctica.[166][part0000_split_079.html#_edn166] The intelligence report, gathered from Sovietspies embedded in the U.S., revealed that the US Navy had sent the militaryexpedition to find and destroy one or more hidden Nazi bases. On the way, theyencountered a mysterious UFO force that attacked the military expedition,destroying several ships and a significant number of planes. Indeed, OperationHighjump had suffered “many casualties” as stated in the initial press reportsfrom Chile. While there is a possibility this report resulted from U.S.disinformation fed to a known Soviet mole, the more likely explanation is thatthe report exposes the first known historical incident involving a battlebetween U.S. naval forces and an unknown UFO force stationed in or nearAntarctica.In the Soviet intelligence report, never before released testimony by two USNavy servicemen assigned to Operation Highjump was revealed. An article in NewDawn by Frank Joseph gives a detailed analysis of the two eyewitness accounts(only the latter of which is mentioned in the 2006 Russian documentary). John P.Szehwach, a radioman stationed on the USS Brownson, gave testimony of how UFOsappeared dramatically out of the ocean depths. On January 17, 1947 at 0700hours, Szehwach says: I and my shipmates in the pilothouse port side observed for several minutes thebright lights that ascended about 45 degrees into the sky very quickly… Wecouldn’t i.d., the lights, because our radar was limited to 250 miles in astraight line.[167] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn167] Over the next several weeks, according to the Soviet report, the UFOs flew closeover the U.S. naval flotilla that fired on them, which they, in turn retaliatedwith deadly effects. According to the other eyewitness, Lieutenant JohnSayerson, a flying boat pilot: The thing shot vertically out of the water at tremendous velocity, as thoughpursued by the devil, and flew between the masts [of the ship] at such a highspeed that the radio antenna oscillated back and forth in its turbulence. Anaircraft [Martin flying-boat] from the Currituck that took off just a fewmoments later was struck with an unknown type of ray from the object, and almostinstantly crashed into the sea near our vessel…. About ten miles away, thetorpedo-boat Maddox burst into flames and began to sink… Having personallywitnessed this attack by the object that flew out of the sea, all I can say is,it was frightening.[168] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn168] There is a major problem with Sayerson’s quote however. There has been notorpedo boat named Maddox in the US Navy.[169] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn169]In the Russian documentary, the incident described by Sayerson (misspeltSireson) refers instead to the destroyer “Murdoch”. There was, however, nodestroyer named “Murdoch” active in the U.S. Fleet in 1947. Instead there was adestroyer named “Maddox” (DD-731), but it did not serve in Operation Highjump.In fact, the USS Maddox was the destroyer fired upon in the Gulf of Tonkinincident of 1964.[170] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn170]According to Frank Joseph, the USS Maddox was “either a torpedo boat, ortorpedo-carrying destroyer”. He also explains what may have happened to theMaddox mentioned in the Soviet report: A USS Maddox was indeed sunk by enemy action, but five years earlier by a Germandive-bomber during the Allied invasion of Sicily. Actually there were at leastthree American destroyers known by that name (DD-168, DD-622 and DD-731) all ofthem contemporaneous. The U.S. Navy has long been notorious for falsifying theidentity of its ships and re-writing their histories if they embarrass officialpolicy…. So too, the “Maddox” cited by Soviet espionage was similarly consignedto an official memory hole.[171] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn171] If Joseph is correct, then it is very possible that a USS Maddox was destroyedduring Operation Highjump, and the US Navy changed official records to hide thisfact. An alternative explanation is that the 1947 Soviet report contained U.S.orchestrated disinformation conveyed to Soviet authorities by a Soviet moleknown and cleverly used by the U.S. intelligence community. Though plausible,this explanation is highly unlikely, given that the U.S. and USSR were stillallies at the time of Operation Highjump, and had a common interest in findingand destroying any hidden Nazi base(s) in the South Atlantic.It is clear that the best the US Navy could muster was no match for the small,but well-armed German elite that survived the war in their remote Antarcticlocation. The possibility that the Germans were receiving assistance from atechnologically advanced ally in fending off the U.S. attack cannot bediscounted. The presence of Orsic and other Vril Society members suggest thatthe Nazis had an esoteric means of communicating with its allies, who wereextraterrestrial and/or an advanced subterranean civilization. [172][part0000_split_079.html#_edn172]This scenario is supported by the testimony given by Kewper who stated he sawdocuments and received briefings about the fate of Operation Highjump: In 1946-1947, the United States had a scientific mission to Antarctica underAdmiral Byrd and we had military interaction there with aliens and their saucercraft, like a mini-war. We lost all of our aircraft.[173][part0000_split_079.html#_edn173] Subsequent reports of extensive UFO activity in the Antarctic region areconfirmation that it was being used as a base of operations by a new enemythreat, the one that had unnerved Admiral Byrd and, according to his quote inthe Chilean press report; could fly from “pole to pole”.[174][part0000_split_079.html#_edn174]Corey Goode affirms the Nazis had help in establishing and protecting the threeAntarctic bases: There was help from the Draco Federation as well as a group that the Nazi’s wereled to believe were ET’s (referred to as “Arianni” or “Aryans”, sometimes called“Nordics”) but were actually an Ancient Earth Human Break Away Civilization thathad developed a Space Program (referred to as “The Silver Fleet”) and createdvast bases below the Himalayan Mountains (largest in Tibet and called the systemAgartha) and a few other regions.[175] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn175] Here, Goode is here referring to the same “Arianni” that Admiral Byrd wroteabout in his posthumously published diaries, whose authenticity is stilldisputed. These alleged diaries contain Byrd’s account of what he encounteredwhen his plane was lost for several hours during a mapping expedition over theSouth Pole region (an incident which is well documented). Byrd’s description ofa meeting with a person he calls a Master is worth quoting in full given Goode’sinformation: My thoughts are interrupted in a cordial manner by a warm rich voice ofmelodious quality,'I bid you welcome to our domain, Admiral.'I see a man with delicate features and with the etching of years upon his face.He is seated at a long table. He motions me to sit down in one of the chairs.After I am seated, he places his fingertips together and smiles. He speakssoftly again, and conveys the following:'We have let you enter here because you are of noble character and well-known onthe Surface World, Admiral.'Surface World, I half-gasp under my breath!'Yes,' the Master replies with a smile, 'you are in the domain of the Arianni,the Inner World of the Earth. We shall not long delay your mission, and you willbe safely escorted back to the surface and for a distance beyond. But now,Admiral, I shall tell you why you have been summoned here. Our interest rightlybegins just after your race exploded the first atomic bombs over Hiroshima andNagasaki, Japan. It was at that alarming time we sent our flying machines, the\"Flugelrads\", to your surface world to investigate what your race had done. Thatis, of course, past history now, my dear Admiral, but I must continue on.You see, we have never interfered before in your race's wars, and barbarity, butnow we must, for you have learned to tamper with a certain power that is not forman, namely, that of atomic energy. Our emissaries have already deliveredmessages to the powers of your world, and yet they do not heed. Now you havebeen chosen to be witness here that our world does exist.You see, our Culture and Science is many thousands of years beyond your race,Admiral.' I interrupted, 'But what does this have to do with me, Sir?' The Master's eyesseemed to penetrate deeply into my mind, and after studying me for a few momentshe replied,'Your race has now reached the point of no return, for there are those among youwho would destroy your very world rather than relinquish their power as theyknow it...'I nodded, and the Master continued,'In 1945 and afterward, we tried to contact your race, but our efforts were metwith hostility, our Flugelrads were fired upon. Yes, even pursued with maliceand animosity by your fighter planes. So, now, I say to you, my son, there is agreat storm gathering in your world, a black fury that will not spend itself formany years. There will be no answer in your arms, there will be no safety inyour science.It may rage on until every flower of your culture is trampled, and all humanthings are leveled in vast chaos. Your recent war was only a prelude of what isyet to come for your race. We here see it more clearly with each hour… do yousay I am mistaken?''No,' I answer, 'it happened once before, the dark ages came and they lasted formore than five hundred years.''Yes, my son,' replied the Master, 'the dark ages that will come now for yourrace will cover the Earth like a pall, but I believe that some of your race willlive through the storm, beyond that, I cannot say.We see at a great distance a new world stirring from the ruins of your race,seeking its lost and legendary treasures, and they will be here, my son, safe inour keeping. When that time arrives, we shall come forward again to help reviveyour culture and your race.Perhaps, by then, you will have learned the futility of war and its strife...andafter that time, certain of your culture and science will be returned for yourrace to begin anew. You, my son, are to return to the Surface World with thismessage....'[176] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn176] Based on the above dialogue allegedly written by Admiral Byrd, it would appearthat the German secret societies were allowed to use Antarctica as a refuge,perhaps because they were escaping the war in Europe, and were followers of theArianni – the remnants of the legendary Hyperborian civilization whichrepresented the core of Thule Society beliefs. Hence, it is plausible that theArianni helped the German flying saucer fleets defend themselves against the USNavy’s Operation Highjump, just as Goode claims. "},{"pageContent":"OPERATION PAPERCLIP FACILITATES SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH ANTARCTIC COLONY Operation Paperclip was a highly classified military program aimed at locatingthe most advanced technologies developed by the Nazis, along with the mosttalented German scientists, and then bring these resources to the U.S. in orderto kickstart its own advanced aerospace and rocket industries. Paperclip wasoverseen by the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA); a multiagencyorganization led primarily by the US Army and Navy. Earlier, Navy SecretaryJames Forrestal had requested President Roosevelt create the JIOA due to Navalintelligence about the existence of advanced Nazi technology programs. Thisinformation was gained through multiple sources, including Admiral Rico Botta’sspies working out of Naval Air Station, San Diego. Tompkins describesForrestal’s and the Navy’s goals for Operation Paperclip: At the end of World War II, Naval Intelligence operators (spies) penetratedvirtually every German secret weapons, advance system, rockets, aircraft, UFOsand heavy water [projects] in the country. They located the individuals in thesefacilities, and they were tagged. When the hostilities ceased, the NavalIntelligence and additional intelligence officers went straight into theselocations and removed not only the research scientists, but their documentation,and as much of the weapons system as they could. They were all brought to theUnited States in what was called Project Paperclip.[177][part0000_split_079.html#_edn177] In July/August 1945, Forrestal travelled to occupied Germany to see first-handhow Operation Paperclip was proceeding by visiting Navy and Army facilities toview some of the advanced Nazi technologies captured by the U.S. military.Forrestal would have known about Kammler’s successful negotiations with AllenDulles and the Office of Strategic Services over these Nazi technologies. Thus,Forrestal was likely helping the US Navy decide which of the captured Nazitechnologies would be worth exploiting for future use.The development of advanced Nazi submarines was of particular interest to the USNavy because these vessels shared some of the construction techniques used inbuilding flying saucers and the larger cigar-shaped craft capable of travellinginto Earth’s orbit and beyond. Years later, according to Tompkins, convertednuclear submarines became the first antigravity spacecraft developed by the USNavy, which were used for deep space missions.[178][part0000_split_079.html#_edn178] During his time at Douglas Aircraft Company’sthink tank, Advanced Design, Tompkins says he worked on this conversion: And at Douglas, in the secret think tank, we were looking at every type of spacevehicle we would need to go out into the galaxy, then our US Navy. So submarinescame up and we discussed this. We said, “That's the easiest thing, the quickestway, we can get out there. We'll just take a regular Navy submarine, pull outthe whole nuclear system, put in the anti-gravitational system, and we're goingto use these right away.”[179] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn179] After the failure of Operation Highjump, the role of German scientists recruitedas a part of Operation Paperclip took on an added dimension. Not only did theyassist U.S. scientists in understanding the advanced rocketry used by NaziGermany, but they were used as intermediaries for secret negotiations with theGerman Antarctica colony. The U.S. authorities wanted to know how successful theNazis were in their studies to understand the extraterrestrial technologies,since serious U.S. studies were only just beginning. On this subject, CoreyGoode writes: [A]fter the failed Operation High Jump Mission the Operation PaperclipScientists were asked to negotiate meetings. The Nazi Breakaway group knew thatthe Americans had recovered crashed craft from several different species of offworld visitors that were so far advanced that they were getting nowhere with thereverse engineering of their technology.[180] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn180] The extreme importance of tapping into the knowledge base of the AntarcticaGerman colony meant that Paperclip’s German scientists were needed for theirskills during secret negotiations that opened the door to these technologies.Therefore, many of them who were previously classified as ardent Nazis were nowbrazenly reclassified so they could both enter the U.S., and begin work insensitive U.S. facilities. Jim Marrs writes: [O]fficers of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) who managedProject Paperclip soon began receiving security reports … regarding the Germansrecruited into the program. All reports on these men had been altered from adetermination of “ardent Nazi” to read “not an ardent Nazi” … even Wernher vonBraun, who in 1947 had been described as “a potential security threat” by themilitary governor, was reassessed only months later in a report stating, “he maynot constitute a security threat to the U.S.” Likewise, von Braun’s brother,Magnus, who had been declared a “dangerous German Nazi” by counterintelligenceofficers, was brought to America and his pro-Nazi record expunged. “Seriousallegations of crimes not only were expunged from the records, but were nevereven investigated.”[181] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn181] Operation Paperclip scientists were granted security clearances more easily thantheir U.S. peers, which gave them a distinct advantage when it came to applyingfor jobs offered by leading aerospace companies, as Marrs explains: German scientists could obtain necessary security clearances more easily thancould American scientists. Defense contractors looking for new employees to workon classified projects found this aspect of National Interest to be particularlyadvantageous. By 1957, more than sixty companies were listed on JIOA’s rosters,including Lockheed, W. R. Grace and Company, CBS, Laboratories, and MartinMarietta. [182] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn182] William Tompkins witnessed the level of penetration achieved by the Germansentering the U.S. aerospace industry via Operation Paperclip. He says thatDouglas Aircraft Company was one of the few not taken over due to it having itsown top German scientist, Dr. Wolfgang Klemperer, who came aboard prior to thestart of WWII: Douglas was not really taken over like the three other aircraft companies werebecause Douglas had a German guy [Klemperer], a German scientist/engineer, whohad been working at Douglas since 1934, I guess.And so, he had come over and he was not part of the Nazi party or any of thatpolitical stuff at all, but he was a brilliant scientist. And so, he got thepackage [Tompkins briefing packages from Naval Air Station, San Diego], too, buthe wasn’t like this under-the-table type of thing that everybody else got.[183][part0000_split_079.html#_edn183] Notably, Operation Paperclip officially continued up to 1990, at times expandingits recruitment for the U.S. aerospace industry to acquire the most talentedGerman scientists who had ended up working in other countries: Another program, code-named simply Project 63, was designed specifically to getGerman scientists out of Europe and away from the Soviets. “Most went to workfor universities or defense contractors, not the U.S. government”…. Thus theAmerican taxpayer footed the bill for a project to help former Nazis obtain jobswith Lockheed, Martin Marietta, North American Aviation, and other defensecontractors during a time when many American engineers in the aircraft industrywere being laid off”…. Paperclip again began to grow. Specialists were importedfrom Germany, Austria, and other countries under Project 63 and NationalInterest and gained positions at many universities and defense contractors,including Duke University, RCA, Bell Laboratories, Douglas Aircraft, and MartinMarietta.[184] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn184] After Byrd’s stunning Antarctic defeat, the Germans used their hidden bases andadvanced flying saucer technologies to pressure both the Truman and Eisenhoweradministrations into accepting secret deals. This culminated in the 1952Washington Flyover, which had the effect of accelerating the negotiationsbetween Washington, DC and the Antarctica German colony. "},{"pageContent":"1952 WASHINGTON, DC FLYOVER Tompkins revealed in various interviews that the flyover was done by theAntarctica based Germans. In a private conversation, I asked Tompkins ifAntarctica based Nazi spacecraft flew over the U.S. in the summer of 1952. Hereplied: It’s of course a Yes. Some had the swastika on them and some had the Germancross, but they were all extraterrestrial type vehicles, okay, which the Germanshad re-engineered, reversed, whatever, and were putting it in production. So,those vehicles were not powered by extraterrestrials or extraterrestrialvehicles. These were German vehicles that had been given to Germany by theReptilians, but these were production vehicles out of the production facilitiesin Antarctica.[185] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn185] Similarly, Goode says in an interview: They had also received intelligence from their Paperclip spies that theAmericans had implemented an Executive Order making the existence of alien lifethe most classified subject on the planet. The reason being that the developmentand release of free energy would quickly destroy the oil trade, and soonthereafter the entire Babylonian Money Magic Slave System that all Elites use tocontrol the masses. The NAZI’s used this to their advantage in some very publicsorties over Washington, DC and highly Secret Atomic Warfare Bases to mention afew. Eisenhower finally relented and signed a treaty with them (and a few othergroups, both ET and Ancient Civilizations pretending to be ET).[186][part0000_split_079.html#_edn186] [../images/00025.jpeg]Figure 24. Photo of 1952 Washington, DC Flyover Tompkins and Goode’s controversial claims are corroborated by Clark McCelland,who worked for 34 years with NASA and finished his career as a SpacecraftOperator. In the August 3, 2015 installment of his book, The StargateChronicles, McClelland writes: The over flights of advance very swift crafts over Washington, DC were theseGerman advanced aircraft that totally out flew American advanced crafts. On July12, 1952, President Truman observed several of the UFOs and was completelyamazed by their capabilities of outmaneuvering the USAF ... advanced Jet fighter… [Lockheed F-94 Starfire]. USA jets sent up to bring one down. None could flythe speed of the German Saucers.[187] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn187] McClelland, also describes the role of Nazi scientists who had fled toAntarctica in relation to the 1952 Washington Flyover: Because I worked with the German Scientists that were brought to the USA by Dr.Werner von Braun in 1946/7. Several told me that WWII German Scientists by themany thousands escaped from Germany near the fall of Germany in WW II. Theyboarded advanced submarines in the Baltic Sea. They were all taken to the SouthPole base located underground, in Antarctica. Some called it Hitler’s ShangriLa. Those scientists created advanced anti-gravity craft that were flying in ourair space for many years. And still are. They were observed over Washington, DCin 1952 by President Harry S. Truman. Yes, we did not have any aircraft thatcould stop these German planes from flying over our national capital in 1952. SoGerman scientific expertise was again showing the USA who was boss.[188][part0000_split_079.html#_edn188] In addition to brute displays of technological superiority by the surviving Naziregime, Goode, Tompkins and McClelland claim that there was an extensiveinfiltration of the military industrial complex by Nazi sympathizers. Among thethousands of former Nazi scientists and technicians who were part of OperationPaperclip, there were assets from the Antarctic based German breakaway groupwhose job was to infiltrate the U.S. Space program and military industrialcomplex. The latter was well on track to establishing its own “breakawaycivilization”, which according to Goode was infiltrated and coopted by Naziassets who were promoted through the ranks: When both Truman and Eisenhower signed treaties with the NAZI Break AwayCivilization/Societies, it was then that the already well placed OperationPaperclip Operatives (in Military, Corporate Industry, Intelligence andestablished Secret and Public Space Programs) easily slid into more powerful andinfluential positions over the massive industrial complex of the USA that theycoveted to expand their operations in space….[189][part0000_split_079.html#_edn189] After the 1952 Washington Flyover, negotiations picked up and several gruelingyears later a deal was finally reached with the Antarctica German colony, whichhad expanded with the help of “The Fraternity”, with its industrialists andnational elites from around the world who assisted German companies operating inAntarctica. The pivotal benchmark deal was agreed upon at Holloman AFB inFebruary 1955."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5THE SECRET AGREEMENT: U.S. MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX COLLABORATION INANTARCTICA "},{"pageContent":"PRESIDENT EISENHOWER’S SECRET MEETING AT HOLLOMAN AFB On February 10, 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower flew on Air Force One fromWashington, DC to Thomasville, Georgia for a “hunting vacation”. He wasaccompanied by a chartered plane filled with the Press. Later that afternoonafter landing, Eisenhower disappeared from Press view for the next 36 hours.James Hagerty, his press secretary, told the press that Ike and his valet were\"treating a case of the sniffles...”[190] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn190] Inreality, circumstantial and testimonial evidence reveal that he secretlytraveled to Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, on February 11 to meetrepresentatives of the German-Reptilian alliance, who were behind the 1952Washington UFO flyover.The Holloman meeting occurred almost a year to the day after a February 20, 1954meeting at Edwards Base where human-looking “Nordic” extraterrestrials attemptedto dissuade the Eisenhower administration from developing thermonuclear weapons,and warned about the Reptilians and their German allies.[191][part0000_split_079.html#_edn191] The Nordic outreach was rejected, therebyopening the door for agreements to be reached with the Reptilians/Germans.Once again, there is both circumstantial and testimonial evidence thatEisenhower did secretly travel to Holloman AFB to finalize an agreement with theAntarctic based Germans who were working with a group of Reptilian/Grayextraterrestrials. The first testimony comes from UFO researcher Art Campbellfrom his 2007 interview with a security guard for Air Force One (aka ColumbineIII) who confirmed that it secretly left Spence Air Force Base, Georgia, onFebruary 11 at 4 am with Eisenhower on board. Campbell described hisconversation with the security guard: Then he said… \"I do recall one trip down to south Georgia (he wasn't on thisone) where there were a dozen or so going to this tiny little town.\" He went onto say that plane crew did not ask any questions, but they learned why thefollowing day. About 3:00 a.m. they had gotten word that the president would beleaving in an hour. \"We were always ready for this kind of thing, and sureenough, the plane left one hour later.\" He said about a half hour before theplane left, two Air Force cars pulled up and six agents came on board. They hadapparently been booked into a nearby motel somewhere for a day or so. The otheragents in the little town bustled around in their darkened vehicles, indicatingthat the president was there. No one noticed when the president returned late atnight a day or so later, and no one ever knew he had left.[192][part0000_split_079.html#_edn192] More testimonial evidence comes from former USAF medic, Bill Kirklin, who fromMarch 1, 1954 until August 5, 1955 was stationed at the Holloman Air Force basehospital. He claims he received prior notification of an impending visit byEisenhower in February 1955. Kirklin wrote: … we heard that the president was coming to Holloman. I knew there was going tobe an honor parade for him. Captain Reiner asked me if I wanted to participatein the parade. I said, \"No.\" He said, \"Fine. You will be on duty.\" The Paradewas scheduled for early in the morning. The day before it was to take place itwas called off.[193] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn193] At the end of the day of Eisenhower’s visit, Kirklin reports that he saw AirForce One leaving the base and fly over a restricted area: “After work I was in my barracks room when I was called out to see Air Force Onefly overhead. It flew over the residential area of the base. This is a NO FLYINGzone for all military aircraft. Only the President could get away with it.”[194][part0000_split_079.html#_edn194] The above is solid circumstantial evidence that Eisenhower was not recuperatingin Georgia as his press secretary claimed. Instead, Eisenhower was secretly over2000 miles away at Holloman Air Force Base. Various aspects of Eisenhower’sactual encounter with UFOs and their occupants are also revealed by severalfirst hand witnesses.Kirklin claims that he heard a number of people commenting on the flying saucersthat had arrived at Holloman AFB during Eisenhower’s visit. He says one was hiscolleague, Dorsey, who told him: “Kirklin, did you see the disc hovering over the flight line?\"“No.” I am thinking something small you hold in your hand like a discus as theonly craft I knew capable of hovering were the choppers and the Navy'shovercraft. There weren't that many helicopters around Holloman. \"What's it madeof?\" I am thinking of a wooden disc with a steel edge. \"Looks like polishedstainless steel or aluminum. You know just bright metallic and shiny.\"I asked, \"How big is it?\"\"Twenty to Thirty feet in diameter. Do you want to see it?\"\"Sure. But with my luck it wouldn't be there.\"Dorsey replied. “It was there when I took my wife to the Commissary and it wasthere when we got out thirty minutes later. Go out to the front of the hospitaland take a look.”[195] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn195] If Kirklin’s account of what his colleague saw is correct, then at least oneflying saucer was hovering over the flight line of the base for at least 30minutes during Eisenhower’s visit.Later Kirklin went to the mess hall, and says he overheard the followingconversation: On the way back I followed two pilots. The one on the left was in Khakis, theone on the right in winter Blues. I followed them and listened to theirconversation.Left: \" Why the Blues?\"Right: \"I'm the Officer of the Day, I was at Base Ops when Air Force 1 came in.Did you see it?\"L. \"Yes. It's a big bird isn't it?\"R \"Yes. They landed and turned around and stayed on the active runway. We turnedoff the RADAR and waited.\"L. \"Why did you turn off the RADAR?\"R. \"Because we were told to. I think the one at Roswell that came down was hitby Doppler Radar. It was one of the first installations to have it in the U.S.Anyway, they came in low over the mountains, across the Proving Grounds.Interrupted by L. \" I heard there were three and one landed at the Monument.\"R \"One might have stayed at the Monument. I didn't see it. I only saw two. Onehovered overhead like it was protecting the other one. The other one landed onthe active [runway] in front of his plane. He got out of his plane and wenttowards it. A door opened and he went inside for forty or forty-five minutes.\"L. \"Could you see? Were they Grays?\"R. \"1 don't know. They might have been. I couldn't see them. I didn't havebinoculars.” …L. \"Do you think these were the same ones that were in Palmdale last year?\"R. \"They might have been.\" …R. \"It might have been. I just don't know.\"L. \"Did you see them when he came out?\"R. \"No. They stayed inside. He shook hands with them and went back to hisplane.\" Importantly, these pilots reveal that Eisenhower disembarked from Air Force Oneand met with the occupants of the flying saucer that landed at the end of theflight line for at least 45 minutes. It’s also significant that the pilots referto the Palmdale (Edwards AFB) meeting in February 1954. Perhaps most noteworthyis the handshakes at the end of the meeting. This is evidence that anunderstanding or an agreement had been reached. As I will shortly show, indeedthis is what happened at Holloman on February 11, 1955.The family of a base electrician, who worked at Holloman and witnessed a flyingsaucer approach the area where Air Force One was positioned, later contacted ArtCampbell. He was given a letter from the electrician explaining what happened: So the day the President came we went out in the truck to a job where we werereplacing some wire down the flight line.... So we heard the President’s planein the morning lining up for an approach and watched it land on the far runway.So we waited for it to taxi over to the flight line so we could see him, but wedidn’t hear it anymore. It had shut down somewhere out there … one of the men …said he can see out there from that pole over there, so why don’t one of us goup the pole and see where the plane is? Well I had one of my climbers on and …started up with my back to the sun, a safety measure, which also put my back tothe runway where we thought his Connie was. Connie was a nickname for the bigConstellation the President flew…. A few minutes later ... I could not believewhat I saw. There was this pie tin like thing coming at me about 150 feet away.I thought it was remote controlled or something. 25 to 30 feet across and Istarted down the pole as fast as I could go…. While I was running towards thebig hangar I looked back and it had stopped and it was just sitting there.[196][part0000_split_079.html#_edn196] The electrician’s story is very revealing since it is rare first hand testimonythat Eisenhower’s Air Force One had landed at the end of the flight line, andwas waiting to meet up with a flying saucer.Another direct witness is an airman whose plane was delayed at Holloman AFB onthe morning of Eisenhower’s arrival at Holloman. The airman, Staff SergeantWykoff, reveals what happened in an interview: We had to haul a load of stuff down there. Parts that they needed, and therunway is like this. I [had] never seen anything like that before. And anyway aswe were there we saw Air Force One come in, and we didn’t know who it was. Andthen an officer comes around and said you can’t leave. The pilot said we have toleave. And he said well President Eisenhower is here and you can’t leave thefield until he’s gone. And I said, you can hear it over loud speakers, but itdidn’t do any good. I would have liked to have seen him... We didn’t have theclearance to go into the mess hall and one of the other officers, a higherranking officer came [over] to us and said would you like to go in and eat, andlisten to his speech. And most of us said yes, because I’d like to see him. Ididn’t get to shake his hand or anything, because I didn’t have the right badge,clearance to go in, but they did let us go in at the very end and we ate andlistened to his speech.[197] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn197] Once again, Wykoff is a rare first hand witness who actually observed thatEisenhower had secretly arrived at Holloman AFB base to perform some classifiedactivities. The classified nature of Eisenhower’s activities is revealed in thefollowing recollections by Bill Kirklin of a conversation he took part in at thebase hospital with a doctor displaying the rank of Captain and Lt. Colonel: After supper I saw the lights that were still on in the Flight Surgeon's Officeand went over to turn them off. I saw Dr Reiner talking to a Lt. Col... TheColonel was talking: \"He was at the supply hanger. I was there in the front withhim and some others. I was on the stage. There was standing room only with 225men in the hanger.\"Dr. R. \"I heard that he was at the base theater.\"Lt. Col. \"He might have been. He only spoke for a few minutes. Then the baseCommander spoke for about twenty minutes. He had plenty of time to go to thebase theater and get back.\"Dr. R. \"How many did he talk to?\"Lt. C. \"I was there for two sessions standing room only. 225 each time. Theremight have been another session but I wasn't there if he spoke then.\"I asked, \"Who spoke?\"Lt. Col. \"The Commander in Chief\"I said, \"The President … \"What did he talk about?\"Lt. Col. \"It's classified.\"\"Confidential?\"\"Higher.\"\"Secret?\"\"Higher.\"I said, \"Oh.\"Lt. Col. \"What do you mean by 'Oh?'''\"It is none of my business. I am only cleared to secret.\"Lt. Col. \"I would not say that if l were you.\" If Kirklin’s recollection is correct, then the activities that Eisenhowerperformed at Holloman AFB on February 11, 1955 were classified above Top Secret.Base personnel were taken into a large hangar and debriefed in groups of 225. Further proof comes from Clark McClelland who extensively interacted with Germanscientists such as Werner Von Braun, Kurt Debus and many others while he workedat NASA facilities in Florida. McClelland describes what Dr. Ernst Steinhoff,another German Paperclip scientist, told him about the Holloman incident. At thetime of the secret meeting, Steinhoff was visiting Holloman because of hispending transfer there. Dr. Steinhoff … did say, [he] was there during what was called a surprise visitby USA President Eisenhower who flew in with no early notice of those I spokewith that worked there…. The base United States Air Force Officer that managedHolloman, Colonel Sharp, did have prior knowledge of his arrival but not all whoworked there…. It was a big surprise to all others who saw his large plane land…[198] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn198] This is consistent with what Kirklin and others have said about the Holloman AFBlanding involving Eisenhower.McClelland went on to say that Steinhoff told him that the meeting involvedAntarctic based Germans: It was a German Flying Saucer that he [Steinhoff] and others saw at this base.President Eisenhower, being from German heritage realized that when he was metby a German officer as he boarded that Saucer. The President then realized whynone came forth to greet him as he entered that German advanced flyingmachine.[199] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn199] McClelland also points out the connection between the craft that landed atHolloman, and those that overflew Washington, DC in July 1952: I recall something I heard Dr. Kurt Debus say to Dr. Knoth, the Senior Scientistat KSC [Kennedy Space Center], as I entered his office one day. He was speakingof a V-7 craft and my entrance startled both of them. I apologized for walkingin on them. Dr. Debus said it was “OK, Clark” to me. Later, I discovered throughanother German Scientist that the V-7 was the code name for a German Saucershaped craft that was developed below the South Pole Ice Cap. The same type thatoverflew Washington, DC and startled President Truman and the Pentagon Chiefs in1952.[200] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn200] Finally, William Tompkins confirmed the Holloman AFB meeting involving PresidentEisenhower in his response to questions I asked in a private interview: Salla: [#26] Did Antarctica based Nazi spacecraft land at Holloman Air Forcebase in February 1955 to meet with President Eisenhower?Tompkins: And I have to say on #26 that’s a Yes also. Essentially, Eisenhoweraccepted like a defeat in the war without it actually being that. There wasreally nothing he could do, like it’s really one-sided situation.Salla: So, basically, it was a negotiated surrender.Tompkins: Yeah. Like he lost that war. He surrendered. [201][part0000_split_079.html#_edn201] "},{"pageContent":"SECRET AGREEMENT ALLOWS ANTARCTIC BASED GERMANS TO INFILTRATE U.S. MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX After agreements were reached in 1955, both the U.S. and Germans began a race tosee who could infiltrate the other more quickly, but the odds were stackedagainst the U.S. intelligence community. Corey Goode explains what happened: After the treaty was signed and the joint Secret Space Programs began inearnest, things quickly got out of hand and the Nazi Break Away group won therace to infiltrate and take over the other side. They soon controlled everyaspect of the U.S. from the Financial System, The Military Industrial Complex,and soon after, all three branches of the government itself.[202][part0000_split_079.html#_edn202] Goode describes the takeover as a silent coup by the breakaway German regimewhich had succeeded in establishing its Fourth Reich: During the 1950’s and thereafter, they had successfully infiltrated andsubverted the Military Industrial Complex and major Corporate heads, they hadeffectively won control of the direction of not only the Break Away CivilizationPrograms but also the mainstream government and financial system. It was a veryeffective and silent coup that gutted what was once the American Republic andturned it too into a Corporate Entity with each of us being “Assets” with ourvery own serial numbers. This plan was in action far before World War One byvarious secret societies who controlled the financial system and as many knowfinanced both sides of the wars.[203] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn203] Goode’s claims are supported by Tompkins’ recollections of how thousands of Naziscientists were secretly brought in under Paperclip to quietly subvert the U.S.aerospace industry: Some of the companies got one or two top German people into the company. Othersgot 20 into the company and virtually every organization in the company…. Notjust scientists. Weird! And there wasn’t like a 160 of these fellows that cameover. These are like thousands and thousands and thousands of them. Okay? Andnot necessarily the best, but rather were brilliant. So, virtually, everycompany that handles any kind of army, navy, aircraft kind of group and medicalgot loaded with Germans. And some of them could hardly speak English, but theycame in anyway and they physically turned over everything in the advance designareas. And so, yeah, it was takeover of your country’s aerospace.[204][part0000_split_079.html#_edn204] Further first hand evidence of a silent coup or take over having taken place bythe Fourth Reich is found in the recollections of Clark McClelland, who reportedseeing Hans Kammler at NASA in the mid-1960’s. McClelland says that he met withKammler at the office of the Director of the Kennedy Space Center, while KurtDebus was the Director [1962-1974]: I opened his office door and saw two people I had not seen at KSC. He introducedme to both men. He only gave me their first names during the introduction…. Onewas introduced to me as Sigfried and the other was introduced as Hans…. Both hadthe look of Nazi High Command Officers…. Today I am certain of who these two menwere. I eventually learned from other German scientists that one of them me wasSiegfried Knemeyer. He was a very high ranking Nazi Oberst Officer in theLuftwaffe… The other man was difficult to recognize until I saw an older photoof him after he had later entered the USA. He was in my opinion Heinz (Hans)Kammler…. There were rumors after WWII that Kammler had made a deal with GeneralGeorge Patton to turn over German Top Secret technology for his support ingetting Kammler into the USA. That may have actually happened. I personallybelieve it did happen.[205] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn205] Due to the secret deal reached between the Eisenhower administration and theFourth Reich, German scientists brought in under Operation Paperclip were notallowed to be under Army surveillance, thus making them ideal assets for theFourth Reich, as Jim Marrs explains: Imported Nazis had every opportunity to pass national security information outof the country…. [T]here was no further army surveillance over the NaziPaperclip specialists after just four months of their signing a contract withthe U.S. government.[206] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn206] There is abundant evidence that Paperclip scientists were spying for theAntarctic based German colony, but could not be stopped due to a secretagreement with the Fourth Reich according to Marrs: Incidents of information being passed out of Paperclip were presented toauthorities, yet nothing was done. A Fort Bliss businessman reported Paperclipengineer Hans Lindenmayr to the FBI, claiming the German had been using hisbusiness address as an illegal letter drop. According to Hunt, at least threeother Nazis maintained illegal mail drops in El Paso, “where they received moneyfrom foreign or unknown sources and coded messages from South America.” It wasalso learned that many Paperclip Nazis received cash from foreign sources.“Neither Army CIC nor FBI agents knew where that money came from, and by allappearances, no one cared to know how more than a third of the Paperclip groupsuddenly were able to buy expensive cars,” noted Hunt. [207][part0000_split_079.html#_edn207] Many Nazi Paperclip scientists were granted U.S. Citizenship in 1954/55, and putinto leadership positions within the U.S. space program due to the subversiveagreement reached with the Fourth Reich: “… the Germans dominated the rocket program to such an extent that they held thechief and deputy slots of every major division and laboratory. And theirpositions at Marshall and the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida,were similar to those they had held during the war,” wrote Hunt. The Peenemundeteam’s leader, Wernher von Braun, became the first director of the MarshallSpace Center; Mittlewerk’s head of production, Arthur Rudolph, was named projectdirector of the Saturn V rocket program; Peenemunde’s V-2 flight test director,Kurt Debus, was the first director of the Kennedy Space Center.”[208][part0000_split_079.html#_edn208] "},{"pageContent":"U.S. MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX WORKS WITH ANTARCTIC BASED FOURTH REICH The role of the Dulles brothers in the secret negotiations that culminated inthe emergence of the Fourth Reich during the Eisenhower administration cannot beunderestimated. As described earlier, both John Foster and Allen Dulles had muchexperience working with German industrialists whose companies they representedwhen they were employed at Sullivan and Cromwell. The Dulles brothers played animportant role in Hitler’s ascent to power by advocating the interests of Germanindustrialists who were united in their opposition to Communism and advocacy ofa strong nationalist leader.As the head of the Office of Strategic Services mission in Bern, Switzerlandduring World War II, Allen Dulles was the key U.S. official who negotiated withsenior Nazi leaders to reach the secret deals that laid the foundations forlater negotiations with the Antarctic based Germans. Since the Antarctic colonywas led by the Thule Society and other German Secret Societies that hadinfiltrated Hitler’s Third Reich, they were responsible for manipulating Hitlerinto providing the materials and personnel necessary for building the basesthere. The German companies that were owned or controlled by the aristocraticmembers of the Thule and other German Secret Societies were well known to theDulles brothers. Members included the Thyssens, Krupps, Flicks, Siemens, andothers who owned the German companies whose subsidiaries were buildingspacecraft for the Fourth Reich in Antarctica.As Secretary of State (1953-1959), John Foster Dulles was a key figure inhandling the diplomatic aspects of the secret negotiations, and reaching a finalagreement. His brother, Allen Dulles, as CIA Director (1953-1961), wasresponsible for handling all the covert aspects of the negotiations, especiallywhen it came to implementing key details of those agreements. This includedfacilitating Operation Paperclip and the movement of German scientists into theU.S. who would act as intermediaries between German and U.S. companies.During the secret negotiations, the Dulles brothers were ably supported in theU.S. Congress by Senator Prescott Bush (1952-1963), who as described in chaptertwo, also had extensive experience in working with German companies on behalf ofprominent U.S. banking interests prior to and during World War II. Bush was alsoamong those dealmakers who facilitated the movement of funds and resourcesbetween German and U.S. companies. Therefore, an extensive network of U.S.bankers and industrialists worked with their German peers in ways that made amockery of the 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act that had been passed byCongress.[209] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn209]The Dulles brothers, Bush and many other U.S. bankers, industrialists and publicofficials made it possible for a confluence of U.S. and German companies toreach agreements that would establish the Fourth Reich and the U.S.military-industrial complex as partners. Within a strictly compartmentalizedsecurity system, large U.S. companies worked with their smaller but more senior“German partners” in expanding out the industrial manufacturing facilities inAntarctica. However, the U.S. companies were often left in the dark about thefull details of how their products would be used. The final result of thissystem was that fleets of antigravity spacecraft were built in Antarctica underfull German control; not only for interplanetary colonization, but alsointerstellar conquest alongside their Reptilian/Draconian partners. BothTompkins and Goode have described the threat this “Dark Fleet” posed fordifferent human-looking extraterrestrial civilizations.[210][part0000_split_079.html#_edn210] The US Air Force and US Navy took very different approaches in playing catch upwith the Fourth Reich’s secret space program out of Antarctica. Hoping to learnhow to reverse engineer alien technologies, the US Air Force chose to workclosely with the Fourth Reich and their extraterrestrial allies. Whistleblowerssuch as Charles Hall, Bill Uhouse and David Adair have revealed differentaspects of the Air Force collaboration with extraterrestrials and/or GermanPaperclip scientists in their reverse engineering efforts.[211][part0000_split_079.html#_edn211]Operation Paperclip scientists worked closely with the Air Force in developingrocket technologies for a future secret space program that would specialize inglobal surveillance and protection. Today the US Air Force, according to CoreyGoode, maintains at least two stealth space stations located approximately 500miles above Earth.[212] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn212] The Air Force usesfleets of TR-3B antigravity vehicles operating out of Area 51 to service theirspace stations and to act as intercept vehicles for extraterrestrial intruders.In contrast, the US Navy decided to develop a close working relationship withhuman-looking or “Nordic” extraterrestrials, according to William Tompkins.These Nordics were the chief rivals of the Reptilian/Draconian extraterrestrialswho helped the Nazis and German secret societies develop their bases inAntarctica. Beginning in 1942, the Navy began to work intently with the DouglasAircraft Company in understanding the extraterrestrial spacecraft retrieved fromthe Los Angeles Air Raid.[213] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn213]After October 1948, an internal division took place within Douglas, separatingtheir in-house think tank for studying extraterrestrial technologies, calledAdvance Design, from another similarly tasked working group within theirfacility known as Project RAND. As a result, Project RAND moved to a newlocation to become the RAND Corporation. Corroboration that Project RAND (and bydirect association, Advance Design) studied retrieved extraterrestrial vehiclesis evidenced by a Majestic Document called the “White Hot Report”. This keydocument lists Project RAND among the research organizations studying artifactsrecovered from the 1947 Roswell crash of extraterrestrial vehicles: Based on all available evidence collected from recovered exhibits currentlyunder study by AMC, AFSWP, NEPA, ABC, NACA, JRDB, RAND, USAAF, SAG and MIT, aredeemed extraterrestrial in nature. [emphasis added][214][part0000_split_079.html#_edn214] [../images/00026.jpeg]Figure 25. White Hot Report Significantly, the leaked “White Hot Report” received the highest level ofauthenticity from the independent investigation of veteran document researchers,Dr. Robert Wood and Ryan Wood.[215] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn215]Consequently, the “White Hot Report” document is independent confirmation thatthe Douglas Aviation Company, through Project RAND, was involved in the study ofretrieved alien spacecraft, just as Tompkins claimed. After the 1948 division atDouglas, the Navy would continue to work with Advance Design, while the AirForce chose to contract with the newly created RAND Corporation. Furthermore,the Navy was aware that at least three Nordic extraterrestrials had infiltratedDouglas and were assisting Tompkins and other engineers in designing spacebattle groups. Both Tompkins and Goode state these battle groups were eventuallydeployed in the early 1980’s. "},{"pageContent":"ANTARCTICA OPENS UP The secret agreement reached at the Holloman AFB meeting led to full cooperationbetween the Eisenhower administration and the German breakaway group inAntarctica. As a direct result, the international community was allowed toestablish facilities in Antarctica, but this would be done under certainconditions designed to ensure that the German colony there would not bethreatened in any way. This international cooperation was launched under theauspices of planning for the upcoming International Geophysical Year of 1957-58.The Antarctic Sun describes how the international community met in 1955 todiscuss development within Antarctica, especially when it came to the geographicand geomagnetic South Poles which were coveted by the major geopolitical rivals,the U.S. and USSR: An international conference in 1955 near the summit of Montparnasse in Paris,France, set in motion a sequence of actions that determined the scientific andpolitical fate of an entire continent. The meeting assembled scientists from 11nations planning IGY research in Antarctica, and their job was to decide whereeach nation would place its research facilities.A dramatic event was selection of the nation to build and maintain a researchstation at the geographic South Pole. Vladimir Beloussov of the Soviet Unioncreated a sensation by saying his country would place a station near the Pole.Laurence M. Gould, the U.S. delegate, had made it known the United States had asimilar intention.Sensing an opportunity to retain the prestigious location for Westernresearchers, the French chair, Georges Laclavère, pointed out a vast cavity inIGY coverage in East Antarctica. Behind-the-scenes maneuvers are said to haveoccurred. When Beloussov next took the floor he said, “We do not insist on thegeographic pole.” The Soviet Union took responsibility for the geomagnetic polein East Antarctica; Vostok Station remains active there today. The United Statescommitted itself to the geographic South Pole.[216][part0000_split_079.html#_edn216] The Antarctic Sun went on to explain the dramatic change in terms of numbers ofpersonnel and stations that would be allowed in Antarctica: The work planned for Antarctica was unprecedented. Before the IGY less than halfof Antarctica had even been seen, and as late as 1955 only 179 people winteredat 20 small coastal stations operated by four nations. For the IGY, 912 peoplewould winter at 48 stations of 11 nations, and the summer population would reach5,000 – more than today. [217] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn217] Another article in The Antarctic Sun describing the history of Antarcticastated: In just two years the U.S. Navy built seven Antarctic stations for the IGY –five along the coast and two inland. While ten additional nations established 40Antarctic stations of their own in the same period, between 1957 and 1958.[218][part0000_split_079.html#_edn218] While countries pushing into Antarctica led to the global public believing theicy continent was being developed in order for permanent bases to conductscientific exploration and research, these programs were only a clever coverused to hide the truth. Far below the frozen ice sheets of Antarctica, therewere German-Extraterrestrial bases actively collaborating with the U.S.military-industrial complex in building advanced space fleets for globaldominance and interplanetary conquest. The most staggering aspect of thiscollaboration was that the German-Reptilian-U.S. alliance conducted horrificexperiments using slave laborers, just as the Nazis had during World War II."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 SLAVE LABOR IN ANTARCTICA "},{"pageContent":"HISTORIC USE OF SLAVE LABOR IN NAZI ADVANCED WEAPONS PROJECTS The policy of slave labor used by Nazi Germany during World War II was continuedby the German companies that established subsidiaries in Antarctica to build thesecret space program. Historically, throughout the war, major German companieswere required to use slave labor in the industrial manufacturing process.[219][part0000_split_079.html#_edn219] Slave labor usage was deemed absolutelyessential for major German armaments companies in order to meet their warproduction goals. This was because of the acute labor shortage caused bywidespread military conscription, by which all men of a war-fighting age had toserve on one of the multiple military fronts.Most importantly, unlike the allied powers, Hitler’s Nazi ideology required thatGerman women stay at home “to avoid moral corruption” and to raise largefamilies, which would also eventually provide fresh recruits for the ThirdReich’s armies. Hitler’s powerful Armaments Minister, Albert Speer, was criticalof this misplaced “romantic ideology” limiting German women’s roles and wrote: Typical of this intertwining with a romantic ideology was Hitler’s, Goering’sand Sauckel’s [Nazi Head of Labor Deployment] refusal to let German women workin the armaments industry during the war, something that came about as a matterof course in the Anglo-Saxon countries. The reason given was that factory workwould damage their morals and their child-bearing capacity. Such unsophisticatedfeelings were not consistent with Hitler’s plans to make Germany the mostpowerful nation on Earth.[220] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn220] In order to fill the growing national labor shortage due to the exclusion of warfighting German men and family bound women, foreign workers were at firstencouraged to move to Germany. However, as the war progressed, the laborshortage grew and Germany continued to suffer significant manpower losses: During the blitzkriegs of 1939/40 Germany had had no difficulties providing asufficient number of soldiers as well as workers for its domestic economy.However, with the beginning of the invasion of Russia in June 1941, this was nolonger possible. The wide fronts and the losses of the war led to the draft ofmore and more workers to the military. That way, 7.5 million vacancies wereavailable despite (predominantly still voluntary) recruitment of laborers fromother countries.[221] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn221] In March 1942, Fritz Sauckel became Nazi Germany’s General Plenipotentiary forLabor Deployment and immediately began “Sauckel campaigns” to bring in foreignworkers using whatever means deemed necessary: As early as 1942, approximately 2.7 million people were brought into the Reichby means of large-scale “Sauckel campaigns”. Here, due to a special order byHitler, international law was not to be considered, especially in Poland and theSoviet Union.[222] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn222] With the growth in both prisoners of war and concentration camps, people held inthese encampments were forced to work as slave laborers in German industries. After the definite turn of the war in the winter of 1942/43, however, Sauckelwas confronted with Speer’s constant demands for more laborers. The number offorced laborers, often abducted with brutal means mainly from Eastern Europe andpartly living under disastrous circumstances, rose up to five million.Eventually, around 20 percent of all jobs were filled by foreigners; includingprisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners they amounted to more than onethird. Although the demand could never be met, forced labor prevented an earlycollapse of the German war industry.[223] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn223] German companies increasingly used slave labor to fulfill production targets,which were essential for their survival in wartime Germany. Company executiveswho failed to fulfill designated war production quotas risked militaryconscription and dreaded reassignment to the Russian front. Major companies such as I.G. Farben, Siemens, Volkswagen, BMW all used slavelabor. Decades after World War II, these companies or their successors agreedupon a compensation fund for former slave laborers. The following is a summaryof the major companies involved in the compensation fund which was announced inFebruary 1999 by the German government: After the 1998 elections, the newly elected government … pledged to set upfoundations to handle financial compensation. Twelve German industrial giants(Allianz, BASF, Bayer, BMW, Daimler Chrysler, Degussa-Huels, Dresdner Bank, FredKrupp, Hoesch Krupp, Hoechst, Siemens, and Volkswagen) met with GermanChancellor Gerhard Schroeder in [Feb] 1999…. They later announced theestablishment of a fund to pay their victims. News reports speculate that itmight have amounted to about 3 billion German Marks, or 2.6 billion U.S.dollars. Chancellor Schroeder saw the fund as a win-win situation for bothsurviving Nazi victims and German industry. He said: \"for those [victims] in thefinal years of their lives, it will ... provide them with a little more meansthat they would otherwise have had.\" German industry will probably save moneybecause the companies would expect to be given immunity from future class-actionlawsuits. Paying into a multi-billion dollar fund is probably cheaper thanmeeting any future financial awards by the courts.[224][part0000_split_079.html#_edn224] German companies fulfilled orders not just for Speer’s Ministry of Armaments,but also for Himmler’s Nazi SS. After his release from Spandau Prison in 1966,Speer wrote a book about the parallel industrial empire that was developed byHimmler’s SS. In Infiltration: How Heinrich Himmler Schemed to Build an SSIndustrial Empire, Speer describes how he was ordered to support Himmler’s SS inbuilding its parallel industrial empire that used millions of slaves forbuilding super weapons in huge underground construction facilities: Some 14.6 million slaves working to carry out Hitler’s and Himmler’sconstruction plans: a human lifetime later, this seems like a sheer pipe dream.But we must not forget that between 1942 and 1945, Sauckel managed to deport7,652,000 people from the occupied territories to Germany in order to use themfor German industry.[225] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn225] When it came to top secret weapons such as the V-2 [aka A-4] rockets that wereinitially under the authority of Speer, his preference was to use Germanlaborers in order to ensure secrecy and prevent foreign espionage. He explainsin Infiltration: On July 25, 1943, Hitler signed an edict prepared by myself: “The greatestoutput of A-4 missiles is to be attained as swiftly as possible…. The Germanplants that manufacture the A-4 missile, as well as those supply the componentparts, must instantly be supplied with skilled German workers … The ReichMinister for Armaments and Munitions [Speer] is to direct the A-4 program.” Myauthority … was unrestrained. Only German workers – as Hitler had firstdetermined two months earlier – were to implement the project; and we were toavoid Sauckel’s program of forced laborers, which would simply promote theinfiltration of spies.[226] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn226] However, Speer’s authority over the V-2 rocket program lasted only four weeksdue to the destruction of the Peenemunde facility where the rockets were built.The following describes the August 17/18, 1943 bombing raid that destroyed muchof this top secret facility: The first Crossbow target hit was Peenemunde. The primary objective of the raidwas to kill as many personnel involved in the V-weapons programs as possible, sothe housing area was the main aim point. Two lesser objectives were to destroyas much of the V-weapons related work and documentation as possible, and torender Peenemunde useless as a research facility. On the evening of 17/18 August1943, with the backdrop of a full moon, Bomber Command launched 596 aircraft –324 Lancasters, 218 Halifaxes, 54 Stirlings – which dropped nearly 1,800 tons ofbombs on Peenemunde; 85 per cent of this tonnage was high-explosive.[227][part0000_split_079.html#_edn227] Speer’s secrecy system for the V-2 and advanced rocket program at Peenemunde hadclearly failed, and responsibility for the program was quickly reassigned to theNazi SS. Himmler had diametrically opposed ideas on the efficacy of using forcedlabor to ensure security for top secret research projects. Himmler’s ideasimpressed Hitler, as Speer notes: At some point Hitler brought up the manufacture of the A-4, and the necessity ofkeeping it top secret. In this respect, he said he had received a cogentsuggestion from Himmler: Our concern about any betrayal of this highly crucialarmaments project could be reduced to a fraction if the work were done byprisoners of concentration camps. Himmler, he said had told him that he couldguarantee all the necessary manpower for the project. Skilled workers and evenscientific specialist would be removed from the concentration camps and used inthe construction of the rockets. Furthermore, he had asked a young, energeticconstruction expert, who had already proved his outstanding ability, to takecharge of the enterprise.[228] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn228] Thus, the dye was now cast for future top secret projects run by the Nazi SS –forced labor was the desired choice since it was expendable. Forced laborerswere closely guarded in adjacent concentration camps, and at the end of aresearch project, they were either transferred to a new project or put to death. "},{"pageContent":"ADVANCED WEAPONS PROJECTS USING SLAVE LABOR GO UNDERGROUND The young “energetic construction expert” who took charge of the V-rocketprogram was Dr. Hans Kammler. Through talent and aggressive cunning, he rosequickly to become Speer’s nemesis, and Himmler’s desired replacement for Speeras Armaments Minister. Speer writes: Himmler succeeded with his decisive stroke against my previously unchallengedauthority by the circuitous route of developing and manufacturing the newrocket. Kammler, who made an extremely fresh, energetic, and ruthless impression… had begun by taking over relatively small tasks of the A-4 production withinthe overall armaments area. Then he had assumed responsibility for rocketlaunchings which was actually a military task. Finally, he obtained theproduction of all special weapons on the basis of rockets, and at the close ofthe war he had also received responsibility for manufacturing all jet airplanes.At the last minute, Hitler put Kammler in charge of all air armaments. Thus –just a few weeks before the end of the war – he had become commissioner generalfor all important weapons. Himmler’s goal was achieved. But there was no morearmaments industry.[229] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn229] Speer’s admission here is very significant since he verifies that he was takenout of the loop when it came to advanced weapons projects which were all placedunder the control of Kammler and the Nazi SS. In addition to V-Rockets, Kammlerand the SS built flying saucer prototypes for the war effort in highlyrestricted underground facilities. It was in the construction of these massiveunderground facilities that Kammler excelled, and thereby, was able to riseextremely rapidly in the Nazi hierarchy, where he eventually eclipsed Speer’sauthority as Armaments Minister. [../images/00027.jpeg]Figure 26. Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee Report (number 51), June 2,1945. Identifies Hans Kammler in charge of underground facilities. Speer emphasizes Kammler’s ruthless efficiency in building massive undergroundfacilities for the V-2 rocket and various advanced technology programs. The V-2Rocket program at the Nordhausen facility in the Harz Mountains is the mostwell-known of Kammler’s massive underground construction projects. Here, WernerVon Braun and other top Nazi scientists worked on advanced rocket technologies,which were used later to kick-start the U.S. missile program and the NASA spaceprogram. Slave labor was extensively used at Nordhaussen, in conditions thatcame to resemble Dante’s Inferno, as Speer vividly recounts: In the Central Works, the cave district in the Harz Mountains, where theproduction of the A-4 was being prepared, conditions were scandalous andactually interfered with production. In early December 1944, Dr. A. Poschmann,chief physician of the Todt Organization, told me that he had seen Dante’sInferno. A few days later … I went to inspect the production personally… Whatdid I see? Expressionless faces, dull eyes, in which not even hatred wasdiscernible, exhausted bodies in dirty blue-gray trousers…. The prisoners wereundernourished and overtired, the air in the cave was cool, damp, and stale andstank of excrement. The lack of oxygen made me dizzy; I felt numb.[230][part0000_split_079.html#_edn230] [../images/00028.jpeg]Figure 27. Slave Labor at Nordhaussen Despite the atrocious slave labor conditions, Speer was neverthelesstremendously impressed by Kammler’s ability to turn large cavern systems intoefficient production facilities, while overcoming the many inherent obstacles inutilizing the caves effectively for manufacturing purposes: Kammler, who was an engineer with a university degree, displayed abilities wherethe SS bureaucracy of the concentration camps had failed. His success wassensational in regard to A-4 manufactoring. “In an almost impossibly shortperiod of two months, he [transformed] the underground facilities [in the HarzMountains] from a raw state into a factory” I wrote him that this feat “does nothave an even remotely similar example anywhere in Europe and is unsurpassableeven by American standards”.[231] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn231] Soon after the decisive defeat at the battle of Stalingrad (August 23, 1942 toFebruary 2, 1943), the decision was made to build concrete bunkers for the Nazileadership, and to move heavy industry into underground facilities where bothwould be protected from allied bombing campaigns which were rapidly growing inintensity. Speer explains this decision and Himmler’s decisive role ininitiating the underground projects and making them a part of a grosslyambitious vision: Hitler had agreed with Himmler over a year before that [March 1943] about thenecessity of the concrete protection. Now he [Himmler] only repeated his olddemand when he told Dorsch: “The measures initiated” for the safety of thearmaments industry by means of caves and bunker construction “are not to becarried out as temporary measures under any circumstances…. They are the preludeto a far-reaching and definitive transfer of all German industrial factoriesunder the earth, since this is the only way to create long-term conditions forpreserving the manufacturing plants in case of war.[232][part0000_split_079.html#_edn232] Himmler ordered an extensive study of Germany’s cave system to determine thefeasibility of a vast underground network of industrial projects, many of whichwould be top secret advanced weapons projects under the direct control of theNazi SS. The cave research project was placed under the authority of the NaziAhnenerbe, which was filled by Thule Society members who had initially fundedthe Vril Society’s flying saucer projects: In August 1943, he [Himmler] turned to … the “Cave Demonstration Division in theMilitary Science Institute for Karst and Cave Research of the SS Karst DefenseUnit.” Himmler ordered this bureau to draw up a register of German caves. The11-page report was divided according to states. It listed 93 caves … A few weekslater the SS Ancestral Heritage Office [Ahnenerbe] was told to “confer with allthe existing experts on the homeland as well as other private scholars, of whomthere must be a considerable number,” and they were to work out a scientificcompilation of the existing caves.[233] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn233] Himmler ultimately placed authority for the construction of the undergroundfacilities for SS armaments and “super weapons”, which included flying saucerresearch, with Kammler. Even Speer, in grudging admiration of Kammler’sunderground construction accomplishments, entrusted him to build similarfacilities for the German armaments industry more generally: Kammler’s astonishing performance induced me to entrust him – as I informedHimmler on December 22, 1943 – “with special construction assignments…. In earlyMarch 1944, Goering too, still in charge of air armament, appointed Kammler hisrepresentative for the “Kammler special constructions”.[234][part0000_split_079.html#_edn234] What is instructive here is that the same skills used to build massiveunderground manufacturing facilities in Nazi Germany would be essential forcreating similar facilities in Antarctica. It is therefore not accidental thatKammler was among the Nazi SS officials who escaped from Nazi Germany as Hitlerand the Nazis moved all resources to South America and Antarctica. "},{"pageContent":"ANTARCTICA AND THE POST-WAR NAZI PLAN FOR A SLAVE ECONOMY Hitler authorized the Nazi SS to prepare plans for a post-World War II economywhich would continue to use slave labor in an era of peace between the tworemaining military powers; Nazi Germany and the United States. With ahypothesized Nazi victory over the Soviet Union, and an end of militaryhostilities in Europe, the Third Reich would begin to rebuild the Europeaneconomy while also preparing for a future conflict with the United States. Not only had the SS used millions of slaves for the war effort, but they plannedto continue to use slaves in peacetime to prepare for the inevitable militaryconfrontation with the U.S. Speer describes the Nazi SS vision of a post-warslave labor economy: This vision of a “peacetime Reich” was thus based on the existence of millionsof permanent slaves, who were neither political opponents nor so-called “racialenemies.” Because of economic necessity, they would be kept in camps all theirlives – with “women in brothels.” This empire of slaves, which was to stretchall the way to the Urals, would be the basic energy source of a Europe that hadto prepare to conquer the greatest enemy: the United States of America.[235][part0000_split_079.html#_edn235] In his book, Speer emphasizes the importance of slave labor as a key aspect ofHimmler’s planned future. Slave labor practices would continue even while NaziGermany sought to establish political and economic hegemony in a post-World WarII competition with the United States, which could likely last for decades.To date, Speer’s book has not been widely read or discussed since it onlyseemingly deals with a global political and economic situation which did notarise due to Germany’s apparent military defeat. However, Infiltration offers afirst hand account of events confirming how the Nazi economic resources weresecretly distributed around the world making the emergence of the Fourth Reichas a covert global military and economic power possible, while concurrentlyestablishing a secret space program in Antarctica. The Fourth Reich’s powerwould be exercised covertly, and in its secretly constructed bases of operation,slave labor would continue to be used.Crucially, Speer’s book accurately describes the political economy that was usedby the German Antarctic colony in the post-World War II era. As Germanoperations in Antarctica expanded into space, slave labor continued to beexploited in their quiet preparations for a looming future confrontation withthe U.S. It is very possible that Speer wrote Infiltration as a covert warningbecause he understood the coming grave world consequences of the plans for aFourth Reich based on super weapons developed by the German Antarctic program.William Tompkins, in a private interview, offered further details of how slavelabor was transported down to Antarctica: The Germans were already developing the capability to operate out in space. Gointo the moon. Go to Mars and with the plans to go out into the Galaxy. And so,what took place was that everybody that was on the program, whether it was inMaria’s [Orsic] side or whether it was the SS, the information eventually getsall to the German side, not hers, and gets into manufacturing. So, if you canvisualize a dozen different classes of naval-type spaceships being built inproduction facilities in ground, not underground, but in ground mountains allover Germany and then in the occupied countries, massive numbers of thesedifferent extraterrestrial vehicles reengineered and modified to our capabilityor their capabilities to building it, and then learning how to fly to join theReptilian navy’s mission out in the galaxy. So now, you’ve got thousands ofmachinists and thousands of production people building different parts of theseextraterrestrial vehicles.And these are inside of mountains, in deep production facilities like aerospacecompanies. And these people were all stopped from working. They were put on tolarge submarines, all of these workers which were slaves, and taken toAntarctica. And along with them, every drilling machine, every blade, every saw,every kind of manufacturing equipment necessary to build these things was pickedup in one stop and taken out of Germany or out of the other countries and takento Antarctica. So, 80 to 90 percent of this was gone a year before the warstopped.[236] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn236] German companies that had established subsidiaries in Antarctica began producingthe many components for the fleets of spacecraft essential for the ambitiousspace missions being conducted to the Moon, Mars, the asteroid belt and evenbeyond the solar system. Production of the various Haunebu, Vril and Andromedaseries of spacecraft increasingly accelerated,[237][part0000_split_079.html#_edn237] while German scientists continued to makemajor breakthroughs in propulsion, navigation and material sciences.[238][part0000_split_079.html#_edn238]Among the many thousands of UFO sightings seen around the world after thefailure of Operation Highjump in early 1947, many of these were in realityspacecraft secretly operating out of Antarctica. Indeed, Admiral Richard Byrd,the leader of that fateful operation had publicly warned of an enemy that couldfly from pole to pole in his 1947 interview with the Chilean press, before beingmuzzled from doing further media interviews by the Pentagon.[239][part0000_split_079.html#_edn239] In fact, Byrd was referring to the GermanAntarctic colony which had ably shown off its achievement in weaponizing flyingsaucer technologies during its military engagement with his US Navy fleet.Overflights by flying saucers upon U.S. territory and around the world haveinvolved human-built craft based on early Nazi designs according to most authorswho have researched the connection between Germany’s secret flying saucerprograms and the modern UFO phenomenon. These include the authors of seminalbooks on the topic, such as Rudolf Lusar’s German Secret Weapons of the SecondWorld War (1956) and Renato Vesco’s Intercept UFO (1968).[240][part0000_split_079.html#_edn240] More recently, Henry Stevens, author ofHitler's Flying Saucers (2003), and Joseph Farrell, author of Nazi International(2013), also came to the conclusion that most UFO sightings involve man-madecraft based on early Nazi designs.[241] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn241] Inthis regard, Stevens writes: The government has used “flying saucers” to cover its own testing of secretaircraft. It uses the UFO-extraterrestrial ploy superbly. When a UFO is seen bycivilians, a controlled procedure is enacted. This procedure plants orencourages witnesses who expound an extraterrestrial origin in a givensighting.[242] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn242] The above four authors collective view that many UFO sightings are in fact humanbuilt craft based on early Nazi flying saucer designs in secret projects is onlypartially accurate. Lusar, Vesco and Stevens have not considered the possibilitythat the Nazi’s had survived the war in remote locations, while Farrell believesthat this has indeed happened. His book, Nazi International, makes the case thatthe Nazis successfully relocated substantial material, wealth and manpower toSouth America. However, he found it a “very unlikely possibility” that a Germanbase in Antarctica had been built.[243] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn243]What the preceding four authors did not consider or accept, however, is that theGermans secretly built bases in Antarctica from which their flying saucerdevelopments continue to the present day. The major exception has been W.A.Harbinson, who wrote a fictionalized account of the Nazis surviving World War IIin an Antarctic fortress. In his introduction to the 1995 edition of RenatoVesco’s book, he wrote about the chief premise of his novel, GENESIS: Regarding the possibility of the Germans building self-sufficient undergroundresearch factories in the Antarctic, it has only to be pointed out that theunderground research centers of Nazi Germany were gigantic feats ofconstruction, containing wind tunnels, machine shops, assembly planets launchingpads, supply dumps and accommodation for all who worked there, includingadjoining camps for the slaves - and yet very few people knew that they existed.Given all this, it is in my estimation quite possible that the men and materialswere shipped to the Antarctic throughout the war, that throughout those sameyears the Germans were engaged in building enormous underground complexes inNeuschwabenland similar to those scattered around the last redoubt, and that theAmerican, Russian and British “cover-up” regarding saucer sightings could be dueto the reasons given in this novel.[244] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn244] All the preceding authors (Lusar, Vesco, Stevens, Farrell and Harbinson)emphasize the terrestrial nature of the German flying saucer programs, and thesubsequent UFO phenomenon beginning in the post-war era. Importantly, what theydid not consider was the extent to which the Germans had been helped bydifferent extraterrestrial races in the design and development of flying saucercraft.Many German scientific breakthroughs were due to the assistance they receivedfrom Reptilian extraterrestrials, according to William Tompkins. He says that USNavy spies reporting to Naval Air Station, San Diego described agreementsreached between Reptilian extraterrestrials and Hitler: The US Naval operatives in Germany found out about the Reptilianextraterrestrials advising Hitler and the SS in Germany as to how to buildmassive spacecraft carriers and space cruisers to operate with the DracoReptilian space navy. Now, what this turned out to be, after I got deeply intothis, was this is the first time anybody in the United States knew thatReptilian extraterrestrials were actually here on the planet, and were workingwith Hitler and the SS in Germany, and had signed legal agreements ofcooperation with them. [245] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn245] Chapter four discussed Tompkins’ claim that the Reptilians had assisted the Naziregime in locating suitable locations for future bases in Antarctica, where theybegan to build fleets of antigravity spacecraft. Here, he offers furtherelaboration on the extensive underground facilities built in Antarctica: By the end of the war, Germany had already built massive under-mountain researchfacilities, not underground, but under-mountain. The word 'underground'shouldn't be used to describe this. All over Germany, and in the occupiedcountries, Germany had been building mass production facilities for a dozendifferent types of extraterrestrial vehicles that were given to them by theDraco Reptilians… So these designs were going into mass production, not justprototypes. They were going into mass production using slave labor with manymassive in-mountain facilities. Eighty percent of these facilities had all beenremoved from Germany six months before the war ended. It had all been taken tocaverns in Antarctica, and the Germans were continuing the construction downthere.[246] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn246] Germans with verifiable Aryan ancestry were selected as the senior officers,crew, scientists and engineers for the spacecraft secretly developed and flownout of Antarctica. The key element of the Thule and Nazi ideology of a masterrace destined to rule humanity continued to be a cornerstone of belief for theAntarctic based Germans. This meant that those with inferior genetic stock wouldat best be assigned to provide support services in terms of junior positionssuch as crew or technicians, and at worst, as slave labor. This was madepossible due to the way in which Antarctica Germans rationalized the defeatsuffered by Hitler’s Third Reich in World War II.Hitler had led Germany into disaster due to his reckless militaristic policieswhich culminated in the beginning of World War II. This was well before Germanscientists and corporations had mastered the advanced technologies that werethen being developed, and deemed necessary for a successful military campaign.It is well known to historians that leading German figures such as FritzThyssen, head of Germany’s major steel conglomerate, and Admiral WilhelmCanaris, head of Germany’s military intelligence, were opposed to Hitler’smilitarism.[247] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn247]Thyssen, Canaris and other members of Germany’s secret societies, who hadelevated Hitler to his leadership position in 1933, believed Germany needed moretime to develop its industrial might through the advanced technologies beingresearched and developed by German companies. If Hitler had not pursued hisreckless militaristic policies, Germany’s Third Reich would have had more timeto develop its advanced technology programs, which could have possibly changedthe outcome of World War II.The chief lesson the German Antarctic colony gained, therefore, was that in anyfuture struggle with the United States, covert economic means needed to be usedto establish global hegemony. An open military struggle was likely to havesimilar outcomes mirroring the two world wars, since Germany simply lacked themanpower and industrial manufacturing resources to defeat other major nationsunited in a clear opposition. A covert struggle, where major powers were pickedoff one by one, would be an easier way to establish global dominance.A covert global struggle where German elites would collaborate with elites fromother nations to expand Germany’s secret Antarctic operations would have had avery different outcome. After all, it was shown in an earlier chapter howAmerican elites such as Henry Ford proposed some of the racial theories lateradopted by Hitler. Nationalism would be used by elites to manipulate the massesto eagerly fight in wars, but for the elite groups themselves, “the Fraternity”,what motivated them was not nationalism, but the racial supremacy views they allshared in their unending quest for personal power.It was not just German secret societies that believed in Edward Bulwer Lytton’stheories about the Vril force, futuristic societies in the Inner Earth, andadvanced technologies that would in future enable space travel and globaldominance. These views were shared by American, British, French and Russianelites, and similar groups from the Far East. All believed that power should beheld by those born and bred to wield it, not exercised through the ballot box aswidely accepted in democratic societies.This made it possible for the German Antarctic colony to find influential alliesin the military industrial complexes of major nations, which then led to theinfiltration of these nations. Both U.S. elites and the Antarctica Germansperceived many benefits from cooperation since each lacked something the otherside possessed. The Germans held incredibly advanced space technologies, eitherdeveloped by their secret societies or given to them by their Reptilian allies,but lacked manpower and the industrial resources to fully develop these on theirown. On the other hand, U.S. elites had vast manpower and industrial resources,but lacked the scientific understanding for studying and reverse engineering theextraterrestrial technologies that had come into their possession. It is important to keep in mind that there were many U.S. companies that hadestablished close relations with their German partners in the lead up to, andduring, World War II. Influential U.S. figures such as Henry Ford, theRockefeller family, and the Dulles brothers were the tip of the American icebergwhen it came to extensive economic cooperation with Nazi Germany. After WorldWar II, some of the more notable U.S. elites had advanced to prominent politicalpositions that would facilitate close cooperation between the U.S. and GermanAntarctica colonies. In early 1953, Nelson Rockefeller had become a senioradvisor to President Eisenhower and reorganized the U.S. bureaucracy. JohnFoster Dulles became Eisenhower’s Secretary of State, while Allen Dulles becamethe CIA Director. These three officials were at the center of what would becomea very close relationship between the U.S. and Antarctic based Germans.In this relationship, elite U.S. policy makers would turn a blind eye to theextensive use of slave labor in Antarctica. In fact, many accepted theadvantages a captive pool of humans could provide for corporations conductingresearch and development into bio-warfare, genetic engineering and space travel,all of which could take place without any kind of oversight. In chapters yet tocome, a deeper explanation will be provided to show how slave labor would beused for Research and Development programs in Antarctica, and subsequently takenoff planet in space colonies established by the Germans.It would be a mistake to consider the German Space Program in Antarctica asexclusively militaristic, exploitative of slave labor, and intent on galacticconquest. This is because of the Orsic/Vril Society faction that also operatedboth in Antarctica and in South America from smaller German bases. Orsic’santipathy towards militarism and the Nazi SS led to her far smaller spaceprogram which took a very different approach in interacting with the rest ofhumanity. She would attempt to disseminate a galactic philosophy of peace andunity, and help raise human consciousness. In this effort, she was helped bylike-minded human looking extraterrestrials; the Nordics. Together, Orsic andthe Nordics played a significant role in launching the Space Brothers movementin the 1950’s."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 GERMAN SECRET SPACE PROGRAM & THE SPACE BROTHERS Only a few months after Admiral Richard Byrd’s forewarning interview with theChilean press, the famous Kenneth Arnold UFO incident occurred. In June 1947,Arnold witnessed fleets of flying wing-shaped craft over the Cascade Mountainsof Oregon and Washington State. These flying wing craft were remarkably similarin design to a unique aerial model the Horton Brothers had developed for NaziGermany – one of which was relocated to the U.S. after World War II. It’sfeasible that successful prototypes were developed and moved to Antarctica, andwere able to overfly U.S. territory by 1947. [../images/00029.jpeg]Figure 28. Comparison: UFO drawing by Kenneth /Photo of Horton Flying Wing Admiral Byrd’s warning had proved prescient insofar as the Antarctic basedGermans now had the capability to overfly the U.S. with impunity by June 1947.Therefore, with the subsequent rise of the UFO sightings after the Arnoldincident, it can be concluded that some, if not many of these, were connected tothe German Space Program out of Antarctica.As already mentioned, the most memorable flyover within the U.S. occurred duringtwo successive weekends in July 1952, when waves of UFOs filled the air spaceover Washington, DC. Tens of thousands witnessed the flyovers which werephotographed, caught on radar, and sighted by military pilots. The sightingswere so dramatic that the US Air Force gave a Press Conference to dismiss it allas a “temperature inversion” weather anomaly. According to three present dayinsiders/whistleblowers who acquired knowledge of the mysterious crafts’origins, the UFOs were in fact German flying saucers. William Tompkins, ClarkMcClelland, and Corey Goode all said the same regarding the Washington Flyover.Each of them had either been briefed or had learned from colleagues that the UFOvehicles were German antigravity spacecraft. "},{"pageContent":"DID GERMAN ASTRONAUTS PRETEND TO BE EXTRATERRESTRIALS WHEN MEETING CONTACTEES? Only months after the highly dramatic 1952 Washington Flyover, the legendarycontactee George Adamski began witnessing and photographing flying saucers overCalifornia skies. On November 20, Adamski claimed he traveled to a remotelocation near Desert Center, California, where he made contact with the occupantof a landed saucer ship. Six people that accompanied Adamski saw two UFO shipson the day of Adamski’s encounter. The first was a large cigar-shaped craft thatflew overhead; the second was a smaller saucer-shaped scout craft that landed.An occupant emerged to meet with Adamski, and eventually conveyed that he camefrom the planet Venus and was called “Orthon”.The six witnesses of the landing and Adamski’s encounter with it’s vehicle’soccupant signed an affidavit supporting Adamski’s version of events, which weresubsequently published in his 1953 co-written book, The Flying Saucers HaveLanded. One of the witnesses, George Hunt Williamson, said during a lecture: I would like to reaffirm here that the experience, as George Adamski has relatedin Flying Saucers Have Landed, where my wife and I, along with friends of ours,were witnesses to the occurrence, happened exactly as Mr. Adamski mentions therein Flying Saucers Have Landed: the large craft was witnessed, and then throughbinoculars we did witness the other happenings about a mile away on the desert…We did see Mr. Adamski talking to someone … at a distance. We saw the largecraft. We saw flashes of light from it, from which we later learned the smallercraft had come out of the larger one. We did see a great opening in the biggercraft through which the smaller scout-ship must have originally left the largership…. We did see the small ship as it hovered in the saddle. [248][part0000_split_079.html#_edn248] Lending significant support to Adamski’s claims are the photos he took of boththe hovering saucer-shaped craft, and the pilot (Orthon) walking away from wherethe craft appeared to have landed. In 2017, the photos were digitally enhancedby Danish artist Rene Erik Olsen and first released in a book authored by FrenchUFO researcher Michel Zirger, entitled: We Are Here: Visitors without aPassport. A sequence of the original photos taken by Adamski of the “scoutcraft” and “Orthon”, together with the enhanced versions produced by Olsen, areshown here [see Figures 29 and 30]. [../images/00030.jpeg]Figure 29. Scout craft photographed by George Adamski. \"Original imagescopyright The Adamski Foundation and enhancements copyright Rene Erik Olsen.\" [../images/00031.jpeg]Figure 30. Two photo enhancements showing Orthonwalking from landed Scout Craftand Orthon close up. \"Original images copyright The Adamski Foundation andenhancements copyright Rene Erik Olsen.\" There are a number of aspects about George Adamski’s 1952 contactee case thatraise the possibility that Orthon was part of a German secret space program,and/or linked to an extraterrestrial alliance which had actively helped NaziGermany leading up to, and during, World War II.The flying saucers that Adamski photographed very closely resembled the Haunebuantigravity craft that had allegedly been developed in Nazi Germany. The exactspecifications of the Haunebu craft contained in Nazi SS files were firstreleased by Vladimir Terziski, an engineer and former member of the BulgarianAcademy of Sciences who was discussed in chapter three. The following image[Figure 31] is a comparison of a 1943 design of a Haunebu II flying saucer craftbeing developed by the Nazi SS for the war effort, and a scout craftphotographed by Adamski in December 1952. [../images/00032.jpeg]Figure 31. Haunebu II and Adamski Scout Craft Strikingly, the only major point of difference is that the Nazi craft wasequipped with an artillery device signifying an attempt to weaponize flyingsaucers for the war effort. Indeed, in 1950, articles appeared in majornewspapers around the world citing interviews with prominent Italian and Germanscientists who confirmed that the Axis powers had been cooperating in a secreteffort to weaponize flying saucer prototypes.[249][part0000_split_079.html#_edn249] The configuration of the 1943 Haunebu craftis so similar to those Adamski photographed in 1952 as to suggest that they arethe same type of vehicle, or whoever developed the latter was at a comparabletechnological level of development to the Germans in the mid-1940’s.This fact raises a big problem! If Orthon was from Venus, and part of anadvanced interplanetary association, as believed by Adamski, then how could thefirst generation of Nazi flying saucers have been almost identical to craft usedby a far more technologically evolved interplanetary society? One explanation isthat extraterrestrials handed over their own craft to Nazi Germany so that ThirdReich scientists could reverse engineer them. This is supported by informationprovided by William Tompkins, who says that US Navy spies had reported duringtheir debriefings from 1942 to 1946 that the Germans had been given over a dozenmodels of operational antigravity spacecraft.[250][part0000_split_079.html#_edn250] The Nazis were furiously attempting to reverseengineer these for the war effort, but were ultimately unsuccessful as far astheir European based programs were concerned. Tompkins’ information helps us tounderstand that the 1943 Haunebu II diagram was an attempt by the Nazis toweaponize an antigravity flying saucer, which had been given to Hitler’s ThirdReich by extraterrestrial allies as a result of a secret agreement. Yet, how canthe lack of weapons on the flying saucers sighted by Adamski in 1952 beaccounted for if they were associated in some way with the German Space Program?Since the Germans had not one, but two, space programs in Antarctica, the answeris clear. While one of these was a fusion of German Secret Societies (includingThule, Black Sun and Nazi SS) ruled by a male dominated hierarchy, the otherspace program was led by Maria Orsic and her Vril Society which, to thecontrary, was governed by women. Indeed, Orsic was adamantly opposed to the Naziwar effort and militarizing flying saucer technologies, as attempted by the NaziSS. Orsic’s lack of assistance towards the war effort was noted by Himmler, aspointed out in chapter one, but his protests were rebuffed by Hitler because herecognized her knowledge and extraterrestrial connections as highly valuable tothe emerging German space programs. Tompkins commented in an interview on thissubject: Germany found out about the blonde [Orsic], took her over, stopped everything,and then got to this point where there was some sort of pressurized program bythe SS to control that original group. Now, several times they did worktogether, but Hitler allowed them to operate independently of the whole SSprogram – the whole development. So we had two developments going on in Germany.The girls didn't want their vehicles to be used for anything else but travel.They were afraid that somebody would get a hold of it and they'd use it formilitary, which is, of course, what they got.[251][part0000_split_079.html#_edn251] Orsic was deeply dedicated to learning about extraterrestrial life in the galaxyand cosmic philosophy, as evidenced in her psychic channeling of beings from theAlderbaran star system. This strongly indicates that the craft photographed byAdamski belonged to the Orsic/Vril faction of the German secret space programoperating out of Antarctica.Certainly, the cosmic peace and unity message advocated by Adamski’s allegedVenusians had much in common with Orsic’s pacific approach to learning aboutextraterrestrial life. Indeed, if Orsic had succeeded in using advancedspace-time technologies to travel to Aldebaran and interact with advanced humancolonies there in the late 1940’s, then it’s very possible that the Orsic/Vrilfaction of the German Space Program became spiritually elevated due to theirinteractions. Thus, after acquiring unprecedented galactic knowledge andexperience, her faction returned to Earth to start promoting a cosmic peace andunity message. So, were the “Space Brothers” that dominated the 1950’s UFOliterature converted Germans who had spent decades learning cosmic secrets indeep space during their mission of advanced space-time travel?The first person to raise such a possibility was legendary UFO researcher, Lt.Col. Wendelle Stevens, who passed away in 2010. In our private conversationsduring a two week tour of Japan in 2007, Stevens told me that Hitler survivedWorld War II, had lived in Colombia, and that the Germans converted during theirspace encounters. He said that the Germans had come back to teach a message ofcosmic peace and unity to the rest of humanity. In a similar vein, Corey Goodesaid he learned that the Orsic group did travel into deep space and had returnedto Earth to preach a cosmic philosophy to contactees: Many in the Intel Community became quite convinced that Maria Orsic was one ofthe “Blondes” that would land in UFOs and talk to people in German pretending tobe an ET from another star system. When some of the witnesses were shown herphoto they identified her as the same person that they had met from the FlyingSaucer. She has obviously made it to the Antarctic Bases/Cities where she wastaking part in a program using the NAZI’s Flying Disk technologies to spreaddisinformation through some contactees.[252] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn252] However, the one condition imposed upon them in doing so was that they had topretend to be extraterrestrials and not reveal their true origin. Therefore, itis very possible that Orthon had also only feigned to be from Venus, in order tohide the existence of the German space program that had survived World War II.A fact that strengthens this conclusion is that Orthon only communicated withAdamski non-verbally using sign language during the 1952 Desert Centerencounter. Adamski explained in a lecture that Orthon “spoke mostly in a strangedialect wholly unintelligible to Adamski”.[253][part0000_split_079.html#_edn253] Was the “strange dialect” High German whichanother contactee, Reinhold Schmidt, identified as the language used by thespacecraft occupants during his 1957 contact experience?Michael Zirger, author of They are Here, summarizes Schmidt’s encounter: I would like to quote briefly a last case, that of Reinhold O. Schmidt, 60 atthe time, a Bakersfield (Calif.) grain buyer. On November 5, 1957, he claimed tohave spoken for about 30 minutes to the crew of a large silver cigar-shaped UFOthat had allegedly landed near Kearney on the Nebraska prairie to make repairs.In an available one-hour-and-a-half tape-recorded interview Schmidt stated thecrew was composed of “four men and two ladies.” They all spoke to him “inAmerican language with a German accent,” but at times he seemed to him that hecould hear them talking among themselves in “high German language, very goodhigh German.” [254] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn254] Schmidt had German parents and was also taught High German at school, butAdamski may not have been able to identify a German dialect since his backgroundwas Polish-American. Alternatively, Adamski may have known that Orthon spokeGerman, but was not allowed to publicly reveal this for national securityreasons.It has long been rumored that after each of his extraterrestrial contactexperiences, Adamski was secretly flown from California to the Pentagon by theUS Air Force where he was debriefed about his contacts. In May 2009, a rarevideo was released online containing interviews with various witnesses who knewabout Adamski and his secret debriefings at the Pentagon.[255][part0000_split_079.html#_edn255] The witnesses confirmed that Adamski possesseda military ordnance ID card which allowed him access into the Pentagon. Thismilitary ID was witnessed by several people who had worked in various positionsat the Department of Defense. Among the witnesses was William Sherwood, who hadpreviously worked for the US Army Ordnance Department and possessed his ownOrdnance pass. Sherwood saw Adamski’s Ordnance pass and confirmed itsauthenticity.[256] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn256] Sherwood’s, and others,supporting testimony gives credence to rumors that Adamski was indeed secretlybriefing the Pentagon about his extraterrestrial contacts.In 1952, the Pentagon was well aware that a German Space Program had survivedWorld War II and began maneuvers over U.S. territory. Senior Pentagon officialswanted this to be kept secret. Consequently, it is very possible that Adamskiwas told not to say anything about Orthon speaking German to prevent the publicfrom learning the truth. "},{"pageContent":"PENTAGON HID GERMAN SECRET SPACE PROGRAM LINK TO ALIEN CONTACT CASES The idea that some of the UFOs sighted over U.S. soil were part of a Germansecret space program is strengthened by two additional UFO landing incidentsduring the 1950’s, over the same period that Adamski said he was having contactexperiences with Venusians. On January 7, 1956, Willard Wannall, a MasterSergeant at the time with the US Army, says that he saw a flying saucer land ina secluded area of Kaimuki, near Honolulu, Hawaii. He was debriefed by US Armyand US Air Force Intelligence officers at Fort Shafter where he was stationed,and wrote a 32 page report of the incident to his commanding officer. WhileWannall’s brief description of the incident was mentioned in UFO sightingsreports at that time, his detailed report about it has never been publiclyreleased.[257] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn257]After retiring from the Army, he wrote a book in 1967 about the incident. In ithe described how he was still under national security orders not to divulge keydetails about the case: However, it may be stated without jeopardizing the safety of my family andfriends, or violating any security restrictions, that we witnessed the landingnear our home of a clearly defined unconventional flying object which remainedunder our surveillance all of forty-five minutes prior to its departure. Inaddition to myself, there were six other responsible, and highly respectedindividuals present, who viewed the details of this sighting alternately withand without the aid of high-powered binoculars.[258][part0000_split_079.html#_edn258] Decades later, a reporter with the Maui UFO Report interviewed Wannall beforehis 2000 passing, and the public was able to learn for the first time some ofthe key details of the UFO landing incident: This time the bell shaped, silver, domed, port holed craft landed in the denselywooded hills behind Honolulu. When Sergeant Wannall approached, a hatch opened.He noted the swastika and Nazi Iron Cross on both the UFO and the uniform of theoccupant. The saucer pilot spoke with a German accent, and had a Nazi uniform onhim! … Sgt. Wannall told us that escaped Nazis, who had flying saucers, had fledto South America and secret underground bases, below the Ice in Antarcticashortly before the Nazi war surrender.[259] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn259] Wannall’s description of the craft closely matches those photographed andwitnessed by Adamski in 1952, and the Haunbu II craft secretly developed by NaziGermany.It is now understandable why Wannall’s 32 page report about the 1956 incidentwas never publicly released under Project Blue Book. It would have revealed thata German Secret Space Program was actively overflying and landing all over theU.S., including the Hawaiian Islands. The fact that the UFO pilot spoke with aGerman accent, wore a Nazi uniform, and was able to land near a U.S. militarybase (Fort Shafter) shows that the occupants had no fear of being fired upon. Inturn, this clearly signifies that some kind of agreement had been reached withU.S. military authorities concerning German spacecraft flying over and landingon U.S. soil. Since such negotiations began under the Truman administration,with an agreement finally reached in 1955, in all likelihood, the Wannallincident involved the militarized faction of the German Space Program operatingout of Antarctica.This brings us back to the Reinhold Schmidt incident. Schmidt described meetingwith the occupants of a flying saucer that landed on November 5, 1957 nearKearney, Nebraska, who spoke in English with a noticeable German accent to him,and used High German when communicating amongst themselves. In his book, Edge ofTomorrow, Schmidt wrote that he initially believed the six occupants were Germanscientists: I thought that perhaps it might have come from Russia, and that it was manned bya crew of German scientists getting data on the first Russian Sputnik which hadbeen launched about a week before.[260] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn260] After being contacted later by one of the UFO occupants, Schmidt had furtherencounters and changed his mind about the craft’s origins. He would now refer tothe vehicles crew as extraterrestrials from Saturn. Schmidt wrote about hissubsequent meetings with the alleged extraterrestrials, describing how they tookhim on trips to learn about ancient Earth mysteries, and imparted their cosmicphilosophy of peace and unity. A telling example is illustrated in what Schmidtwas told about a naturally occurring metal that could be used to buildspacecraft: They showed me how a valuable metal could be extracted from the rocks of one ofthe quarries. This metal is similar to that which the Saturnians use in theconstruction of their Spaceships. When certain improvements in our social andeconomic systems have been made which will qualify us to associate with thosepeople who have already learned how to work and live together in peace andfriendship, then we of Earth will be able to use this metal in the constructionof Spaceships in which we also can visit other planets. [261][part0000_split_079.html#_edn261] Schmidt, like Adamski, may have also been intentionally misled by theinhabitants of the craft he encountered when they declared themselves ofextraterrestrial origin. Despite the obvious signs that they were part of aGerman Secret Space Program operating long after 1945, both contactees would nothave known this highly guarded information. Alternatively, again like Adamski,Schmidt may have been pressured by national security authorities to drop anypublic references to the spacecraft occupants being German astronauts. Thislatter explanation is supported by the puzzling treatment Schmidt received bylocal authorities after reporting his first 1957 contact. The initial interestand friendly support, which led to overnight national media exposure,dramatically shifted into outright hostility by local authorities after thearrival of two Air Force officials.After extensive debriefings with multiple local officials, and interviews withthe local and national media, the Air Force officials stepped in and suddenlySchmidt found himself pressured by the Chief of Police to recant his publictestimony. Schmidt was next mysteriously jailed for two days without charges,and then he was committed to a mental institution in Hastings, Nebraska. All ofthis was done without allowing him legal representation. Only after Schmidt’sfamily and employer strongly petitioned authorities was he eventually released.After the two USAF officials intervened, heavy pressure was placed on Schmidt tochange his story, which clearly suggests that key elements of it threatenednational security. In fact, his release from custody was likely a result that heagreed to change important details in his story to protect national interests.Schmidt’s testimony suggests, as does the Adamski and Wannall cases, that craftbelonging to a German Secret Space Program were actively overflying and landingwithin the U.S. Any reference to the German origin of such craft was thoroughlydownplayed, and instead references to extraterrestrials from Venus, Saturn orelsewhere were emphasized. "},{"pageContent":"WERE BILLY MEIER’S PLEJARANS PART OF A GERMAN SECRET SPACE PROGRAM? In 1975, Eduard Albert “Billy” Meier began taking photographs of flying saucersthat landed near his home in Switzerland. He met with the craft’s occupants whosaid they were from the Pleiades star system, and called themselves “Plejarans”.As in the Adamski case, there was a resemblance between Billy Meier’s scoutcraft and the Haunebu flying saucers developed by Nazi Germany. Also, as in theSchmidt case, the alleged extraterrestrials spoke in German to Meier, andpreached a cosmic philosophy to him, which he subsequently disseminated in amultivolume series comprised of his contact notes.[262][part0000_split_079.html#_edn262]Finally, we have the principal Plejaran emissary Meier says he met in 1975,Semjase, who he described as a beautiful young woman. Semjase taught Meier manythings about life in the galaxy, and her people’s cosmic philosophy. Corey Goodesaid in a 2016 lecture that when a photo of Maria Orsic was shown to Meier, heidentified her as “Semjase”: … when the military found out about Meier's case, they sent people over withsome photographs for him to try and identify the female being he saw. He quicklypointed out one photograph, saying, \"That's her! That's her!\" Apparently thephoto he pointed out was of Maria Orsic, the medium from the Vril Society, whowas making contact with inner-Earth groups, and who played an intimate role inthe pre and post World War II German secret space program.[263][part0000_split_079.html#_edn263] [../images/00033.jpeg]Figure 32. Maria Orsic When we combine the resemblance of Meier’s scout craft with the Haunebu seriesof flying saucers, the fact that his principal contact, Semjase, spoke fluentGerman, and that Meier identified Semjase and Orsic as the same person, then aclear conclusion emerges. Billy Meier’s contact case involved meetings with theOrsic/Vril faction of a German Secret Space Program that was promoting aphilosophy of cosmic peace and unity. "},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSION The material examined in this chapter suggests that the George Adamski contacteecase, as well as the Wannall and Schmidt cases, were very likely real encountersby U.S. citizens who interacted with members of a German Space Program operatingout of Antarctica. Both the occupants of the flying saucer craft, as well as theU.S. military, hid the German connection and encouraged belief in theextraterrestrial hypothesis to explain their origin. Additionally, the BillyMeier contact case almost certainly involved contact with the Orsic faction ofthe German Antarctic Program.This is not to say that all alleged extraterrestrial contact cases have actuallyinvolved interactions with members of the positive Orsic/Vril faction largelybehind the “Space Brothers” phenomenon. After all, the Germans had been helpedby different groups of extraterrestrials who had supplied them with the initialdesigns for space-time technologies and vehicles capable of traveling to distantsolar systems, and later, provided operational spacecraft for them to reverseengineer during World War II. Different factions of extraterrestrials helped theGermans establish their Antarctica bases, and protected them during a criticalperiod when the Allied powers threatened to overrun them.Despite the extraterrestrial’s involvement in the German Space Program, there isa need to review the 1950’s and 1960’s contactee cases to determine the trueorigins of the alleged “Space Brothers”, along with the Pentagon’s efforts tosuppress the truth. The U.S. national security establishment encouraged thedebunking of contactees such as Adamski, Schmidt, Wannall, Meier and manyothers, not because they feared the public learning about extraterrestrialvisitation, but because they feared the public learning the truth about theGerman breakaway colony in Antarctica, a faction of which was closely associatedwith the Space Brothers Phenomenon.The most powerful nation states of the era – the U.S., Britain, France and theSoviet Union – did not want their citizens to learn that a powerful remnant ofNazi Germany had survived the war, or that this group’s technologicalachievements in advanced aerospace technologies had become so dominant that theformer Allied powers had nothing comparable. Leaders erringly assumed thatsecret agreements, infiltration of the German’s Antarctic facilities and thedeceptions of courter intelligence would be the tools to bridge thetechnological gap. In the meantime, they deliberately chose to suppress thetruth about the German connection to the “Space Brothers” encounters thatAdamski, Schmidt, Wannall and other contactees began having throughout theEisenhower Administration in the 1950’s.On November 8, 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected as the next U.S. President, andinherited the weighty problem from Eisenhower of how a Presidentialadministration should deal with the menacing Fourth Reich operating out ofAntarctica, its connection to the “Space Brothers” phenomenon, and the FourthReich’s covert control over the U.S. military-industrial complex. Kennedy’scourageous attempt to assert direct Presidential authority over covert UFOrelated projects and to wind back Fourth Reich influence would lead to a tragicconfrontation."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8KENNEDY’S CONFRONTATION WITH THE FOURTH REICH Three days before President John F. Kennedy’s January 20, 1960 inauguration, thedeparting President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave his famous farewell speech: In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition ofunwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrialcomplex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists andwill persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger ourliberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only analert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the hugeindustrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods andgoals, so that security and liberty may prosper together. [264][part0000_split_079.html#_edn264] Eisenhower’s speech was a veiled warning about the sinister influence the FourthReich had achieved through its infiltration of the U.S. military-industrialcomplex, and the danger this posed to American liberties and the incomingKennedy administration.President Kennedy began his new administration with some important backgroundknowledge about what had transpired behind the scenes during World War II,including Nazi Germany’s development of flying saucer craft. In July/August1945, Kennedy accompanied James Forrestal, then Secretary of the US Navy, on histrip to Allied occupied Germany. Forrestal wanted to recruit the young Kennedyto his personal staff since Forrestal was both friends with his father, Joseph,and was genuinely impressed by the young Kennedy’s precocious intellect. Kennedywas at Forrestal’s side during his tour of captured advanced Nazi weapons, andduring meetings with senior Allied Generals such as General Eisenhower.Kennedy recorded his visit in a diary that was posthumously published as Preludeto Leadership.[265] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn265] His dairy makes it clearthat he was present during Forrestal’s review of advanced technologies ofinterest to the Navy, some of which would be repatriated under OperationPaperclip. While Kennedy’s diary doesn’t refer to flying saucers, it is clearthat he witnessed advanced Nazi technologies, and was briefed about what hecould write about and what had to be withheld to safeguard national security.Kennedy remained on close personnel terms with Forrestal, who became the firstSecretary of Defense in September 1947. Then, in a decision that shocked thegeneral public, President Truman sacked Forrestal less than 2 years later onMarch 28, 1949, and shortly after Forrestal died mysteriously in May 1949,allegedly from suicide. Kennedy suspected foul play against his mentor becauseof what Forrestal had told him about extraterrestrial technologies and themenacing activities of the German Antarctica colony that was steadilyinfiltrating the U.S. military-industrial complex.[266][part0000_split_079.html#_edn266] As President, Kennedy came into the necessary position to gain access toclassified UFO files and technologies, and their connection to Nazi Germany. Hechose to retain Allen Dulles as Director of the CIA in the new administrationdespite Eisenhower’s warning about the danger posed by the military industrialcomplex. Kennedy’s father Joseph, the former U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain,had been an early supporter of Nazi Germany. In fact, he had made largedonations directly to the Nazi Party. On May 3, 1941, J. Edgar Hoover sent amemorandum to President Roosevelt’s office, which read: Information has been received at this Bureau from a source that is sociallyprominent and known to be in touch with some of the people involved, but forwhom we cannot vouch, to the effect that Joseph P. Kennedy, the formerAmbassador to England, and Ben Smith the Wall Street operator, sometime in thepast had a meeting with Goring in Vichy, France, and that thereafter Kennedy andSmith had donated a considerable amount of money to the German cause. They areboth described as being very anti-British and pro-German.[267][part0000_split_079.html#_edn267] Joseph Kennedy’s sympathies for Nazi Germany, connections with prominent Nazissuch as Hermann Goring (leader of the Luftwaffe), and funding of the Nazimovement, together lead to a remarkable conclusion. Just as Joseph Kennedy hadmade a deal with the Italian Mafia to support his son’s 1960 election, he alsoreached a similar deal with the Fourth Reich![268][part0000_split_079.html#_edn268] This would help explain why President Kennedydecided to keep Dulles, knowing full well about his connections to the FourthReich, and that he was also the head of the Majestic 12 (MJ-12) Special StudiesGroup – the secret committee appointed to steer U.S. policy on extraterrestriallife and the German Antarctic presence.On June 28, 1961, President Kennedy wrote a Top Secret memorandum to Dullesinitiating the process of getting access to MJ-12 files: National Security MemorandumTo: The Director, Central Intelligence AgencySubject: Review of MJ-12 Intelligence Operations as they relate to Cold WarPsychological Warfare PlansI would like a brief summary from you at your earliest convenience[269][part0000_split_079.html#_edn269] [../images/00034.jpeg]Figure 33.

Up until his resignation as CIA Director on November 29,1961, Dulles was the pivotal figure in the power struggle with Kennedy overMJ-12 activities, including its control of classified UFO files and the rapidlygrowing influence of the Fourth Reich. This fight for power is reflected in aleaked draft of a memorandum, allegedly rescued from a fire burning theremainder of James Angleton’s files after his death on May 12, 1987. Angletonwas the CIA chief of counterintelligence (1954-1974), and was heavily involvedin providing security for the MJ-12 Group and Fourth Reich activities.In late 1974, Angleton was forced into retirement by the new CIA Director,William Colby. According to Cord Meyer, a former decorated US Marine andtop-level CIA operative, in his book, Facing Reality: December 17, Colby informs Angleton that he is relieving him of his twoprincipal duties, his function as Chief of the Counterintelligence Staff and hisresponsibility for liaison with Israeli intelligence. He gives Angleton theoption of remaining in the Agency in a consultant capacity or of retiring beforethe end of the year…. And Colby gives him two days to reconsider.[275][part0000_split_079.html#_edn275] On December 25, 1974, Angleton’s retirement was announced to the CIA, and thenews was quickly leaked to the press. Significantly, his successors soon began aprocess of burning Angleton’s vast file collection. In 1990, Mark Rieblingrevealed in his book, Wedge, that “Angleton’s successors had actually burned 99percent of his CIA files.”[276] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn276] Apparently,Angleton’s files were so sensitive that it was best to simply burn them. It isnot surprising that after his death, Angleton’s private collection would meetthe same fate as those left behind at the CIA after his retirement.One of Angleton’s counterintelligence colleagues, who claimed he was present atthe burning of Angleton’s files, saved some of the collection. He sent theserescued files to Timothy Cooper, a UFO researcher best known for his role inmaking public the leaked MJ-12 documents.[277] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn277]The partially burned pages of the memorandum were sent to Cooper on June 23,1999. In the cover letter, the agent states: I am a retired CIA counterintelligence officer who worked for Jim Angleton from… [text blacked out] secret files … [text blacked out] sensitive files thatwould connect MJ-12 to JFK’s murder. This document did not exist officially andhas never been disclosed within the agency. AWD [Allen Dulles] was very fearfulof disclosure to unauthorized channels and leaks in the White House. I literallysnatched the “Directives” from the fire and have kept them safe from review. Toallow a review would compromise future directors and put the agency in adifficult position.[278] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn278] According to Dr. Robert Wood and Ryan Wood, the burned document: … is an original carbon with an Eagle watermark characteristic of governmentwork, but so far forensic laboratories have been unable to trace it…. Althoughno date is given, its content directly suggests the month of September. The yearis estimated to be in the early 1960s and is still under investigation.[279][part0000_split_079.html#_edn279] The scorched pages date from the Kennedy era and have the characteristics of agovernment document.[280] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn280] If its contents areaccurate, it provides smoking gun evidence of the power struggle between Kennedyand MJ-12 over access to UFO information. [../images/00036.jpeg]Figure 35. Alleged Top Secret CIA Memo rescued from a fire. Source: MajesticDocuments The classified Top Secret document with MJ-12 code word access is a set ofdirectives from the Director of the CIA, who simultaneously headed the MJ-12Special Studies Project, to six other members of the Project. These areidentified on the cover page as MJ-2, MJ-3, MJ-4, MJ-5, MJ-6, and MJ-7. It sayson the cover page: As you must know Lancer [Kennedy’s Secret Service codename] has made someinquiries regarding our activities which we cannot allow. Please submit yourviews no later than October. Your action to this matter is critical to thecontinuance of the group.[281] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn281] The document clearly acknowledges that Kennedy’s efforts to gain access to UFOinformation soon after coming into office on January 20, 1961, actuallyimperiled the existence of the MJ-12 Special Studies Project/Group.While the partially burned document pages have no date of issue, the authorityof the writer and the political context indicates it was written shortly afterKennedy had issued his June 28, 1961 National Security Action Memorandumrequesting a “Review of MJ-12 Intelligence Operations as they related to ColdWar Psychological Warfare Plans.”[282] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn282] Theburned document acknowledged that it had “become necessary to review andevaluate duplication of field activities in light of the currentsituation.”[283] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn283] This appears to be areference to the June 28 National Security Action Memorandum review Dulles wasordered to undertake.The burned document also appears to be a draft for a series of MJ-12 directivesfrom Allen Dulles, who knew his time as CIA Director was limited due to theApril 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco. He needed an answer from the other MJ-12 membersby October, a month before he was to retire as Director. Within the burnt pages,the document contained a number of directives concerning how to control UFOinformation and ensure that it would not be shared with the “Chief Executive[President Kennedy), National Security Council Staff, department heads, theJoint Chiefs, and foreign representatives.” Dulles’ secret directives proscribedKennedy’s National Security team from gaining access to the most sensitive UFOfiles possessed by the CIA and MJ-12. These files would have contained muchincriminating information about the German space program out of Antarctica, andextensive collaboration at an official level with U.S. authorities.The most damning directive, drafted by Dulles and apparently approved by sixother MJ-12 members, is titled “Project Environment”. It is a crypticassassination directive. In full, it states: DRAFTDirective Regarding Project EnvironmentWhen conditions become non-conducive for growth in our environment andWashington cannot be influenced any further, the weather is lacking anyprecipitation … it should be wet.[284] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn284] [../images/00037.jpeg]Figure 36. Draft of Project Environment Directive. Source: Majestic Documents Dr. Robert Wood concluded that this specific page of the burned document is anassassination directive. In an interview discussing it, he pointed out that thecryptic phrase, “it should be wet” originates from Russia where the phrase “wetworks” or “wet affairs” denotes someone who had been killed and is drenched withblood.[285] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn285]The code word “wet” was later adopted by the Soviet KGB and other intelligenceagencies, according to Dr. Wood. The term “it should be wet”, therefore, is acoded command to kill someone. In drafting this cryptic directive, Allen Dulleswas seeking approval from six of his MJ-12 colleagues to justify theassassination of any elected or appointed official in Washington, DC whosepolicies were “non-conducive for growth”. The directive is a pre-authorizationto assassinate any U.S. President who could not “be influenced any further” tofollow MJ-12 policies. The obscure language of the directive insulated the MJ-12Group in the case of a leak. Its real intent, however, would be clear to anyseasoned covert operative. A CIA veteran like James Angleton would know its realmeaning and what he was being asked to do once it had been entrusted to him.While the response of other MJ-12 members to his draft is not found in leakeddocuments, Dulles’ November 5, 1961 letter to Kennedy indicates that his secretdraft of MJ-12 directives was approved. Dulles’ letter firmly suggests thatMJ-12 had decided not to cooperate with Kennedy. Thus, Kennedy’s efforts toincorporate MJ-12 psychological warfare activities under the direct control ofhis National Security Advisor had been dismissed.Kennedy’s failure to pressure the CIA and MJ-12 to yield substantive informationabout its operations carried an implicit warning. If Kennedy continued in hisefforts to demand access to classified UFO/extraterrestrial files and projects,the draft Assassination Directive pointed to the ominous consequences. "},{"pageContent":"KENNEDY’S ATTEMPT TO COOPERATE WITH THE USSR ON SPACE AND UFOS In his Inaugural Address on January 20, 1961, President Kennedy indirectlyreferred to President Eisenhower’s farewell speech warning about the growingpower of the military-industrial complex. Kennedy described the dangers posed bythe armaments industry using science to build ever more destructive weapons: Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer nota pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, beforethe dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity inplanned or accidental self-destruction.We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficientbeyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from ourpresent course -- both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, bothrightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing toalter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's finalwar….[286] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn286] Kennedy went on to make a bold appeal for cooperation with the Soviet Union inarms control, science and the exploration of space: Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals forthe inspection and control of arms, and bring the absolute power to destroyother nations under the absolute control of all nations. Let both sides seek toinvoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors.[287][part0000_split_079.html#_edn287] The most important clue of Kennedy’s intention to regain control of the UFOissue and desire to deal with the threat posed by the Fourth Reich is displayedin his appeal for joint cooperation in space with the Soviet Union. During hisadministration, Kennedy would repeatedly reach out to the Soviet Union tocooperate in space, along with a host of other areas of mutual concern: Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tapthe ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce … And, if a beachhead ofcooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join increating a new endeavor – not a new balance of power, but a new world of law –where the strong are just, and the weak secure, and the peace preserved. [288][part0000_split_079.html#_edn288] If cooperation with the Soviet Union were to be established in the internationalarena, then it would significantly reduce the power of the military-industrialcomplex. More importantly, cooperation with the Soviet Union would undercut thepower of MJ-12 and the Fourth Reich, which had gained exclusive control over theUFO issue, and were using extraterrestrial-related technologies for weaponsdevelopment. "},{"pageContent":"KENNEDY PROPOSES JOINT SPACE AND LUNAR MISSIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION In September 1963, President Kennedy launched a groundbreaking initiative to getthe USSR and USA to cooperate in joint space and lunar missions. In thebackground of this publicly announced initiative with powerful Cold Warimplications was a more secretive attempt by the Kennedy administration to gainaccess to classified UFO files, and thereby confront the influence of MJ-12 andthe Fourth Reich over the U.S. military-industrial complex. Leaked documentsreveal that Kennedy instructed the CIA to release classified UFO files to NASAas part of the cooperative space effort with the Soviet Union. If Kennedy hadsucceeded, there would have been joint space missions to the Moon, and greatersharing of classified UFO files between the CIA, NASA, and the Kennedyadministration. This effort would have ensured eventual public release ofclassified UFO files by both the U.S. and USSR.In a stunning speech before the United Nations General Assembly on September 20,1963, President Kennedy said: Finally, in a field where the United States and the Soviet Union have a specialcapacity – in the field of space – there is room for new cooperation, forfurther joint efforts in the regulation and exploration of space. I includeamong these possibilities a joint expedition to the moon.[289][part0000_split_079.html#_edn289] Kennedy was offering to put an end to the space race and start joint missionswith the Soviets. According to Nikita Khrushchev’s eldest son, Dr. SergeiKhrushchev, this was not the first time that Kennedy had proposed joint spaceand lunar missions with the USSR. Sergei Khrushchev revealed that at the June1961 Vienna Summit, less than ten days after Kennedy’s famous May 25 speechbefore a joint session of the U.S. Congress promising to land a man on the moonbefore the end of the decade,[290] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn290] Kennedysecretly proposed joint space and lunar missions to his father. Khrushchevdeclined, as Sergei Khrushchev later explained: “My father rejected this becausehe thought that through this the Americans could find out how weak we were, andmaybe it would push them to begin a war.”[291] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn291] [../images/00038.jpeg]Figure 37. President Kennedy addressing United Nations General Assembly (Sept25, 1961). Source: JFK Presidential Library In a series of interviews beginning in 1997, Dr. Sergei Khrushchev said afterhis father initially refused Kennedy’s September 20, 1963 offer of joint spaceand lunar missions, “in the weeks after the rejection, his father had secondthoughts.”[292] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn292] In one interview, SergeiKhrushchev stated: I walked with him, sometime in late October or November, and he told me aboutall these things. He told me that we have to think about this and maybe acceptthis idea. I asked why they would know everything, our secrets? He said it's notimportant. The Americans can design everything they want. It is a very welldeveloped country, but we will have to save money. It's very expensive…. Hethought also of the political achievement of all these things, that then theywould begin to trust each other much more. After the Cuban missile crisis, histrust with President Kennedy was raised very high. He thought that it's possibleto deal with this President, he didn't think that they could be friends, but hereally wanted to avoid the war, so through this co-operation they could sojourntheir thoughts on these achievements.[293] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn293] Sergei Khrushchev confirmed that his father finally accepted Kennedy’s offer inearly November 1963, just over a week before his assassination.[294][part0000_split_079.html#_edn294] According to Richard Hoagland and Mike Bara,authors of Dark Mission, the exact date can be traced to November 11, when a keySoviet Mars mission had failed: “A Mars-bound unmanned spacecraft code-named‘Cosmos 21’ failed in low Earth orbit exactly one day (November 11) beforeKennedy’s sudden “Soviet Cooperation Directive to James Webb.”[295][part0000_split_079.html#_edn295] Khrushchev’s abrupt turnaround, after twoyears of secret and public overtures by Kennedy, led to a series of immediatePresidential executive actions by Kennedy on the following day.President Kennedy issued National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) No. 271 onNovember 12, 1963. The subject header was \"Cooperation with the USSR on OuterSpace Matters,” and the key passage was: I would like you to assume personally the initiative and central responsibilitywithin the Government for the development of a program of substantivecooperation with the Soviet Union in the field of outer space, including thedevelopment of specific technical proposals.[296][part0000_split_079.html#_edn296] The Memorandum furthermore went on to say that the cooperation was a directoutcome of Kennedy’s September 20th proposal “for broader cooperation betweenthe United States and the USSR in outer space, including cooperation in lunarlanding programs.” The Memorandum was classified “Confidential” and addressed toJames Webb (NASA Administrator). It was declassified on October 13, 1981. [../images/00039.jpeg]Figure 38. NSAM 271. Source: Majestic Documents Significantly, Kennedy added: “I assume that you will work closely with theDepartment of State and other agencies as appropriate.” Kennedy identified theSecretary of State as a key person in implementing the process by which dialogueover the cooperation would take place: I expect you [Webb] will assist the Secretary of State in exploring problems ofprocedure and timing connected with holding discussions with the Soviet Unionand in proposing for my consideration the channels which would be most desirablefrom our point of view.[297] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn297] This would ensure that the State Department and other U.S. government agencieswould have access to the information to be shared with the Soviets under thecooperative space initiative.In addition to the Confidential National Security Action Memorandum, Kennedyissued a more highly classified “Top Secret” Memorandum to the Director of theCIA, John McCone. Dated the same day of November 12, 1963, the subject header ofthe file was: “Classification review of all UFO intelligence files affectingNational Security”. According to a draft of the Top Secret Memorandum that wasleaked, Kennedy went on to say: [I] have instructed James Webb to develop a program with the Soviet Union inJoint space and lunar explorations. It would be very helpful if you would havethe high threat [UFO] cases reviewed with the purpose of identification of bonafides as opposed to classified CIA and USAF sources…. When this data has beensorted out, I would like you to arrange a program of data sharing with NASAwhere Unknowns [UFOs] are a factor. This will help NASA mission directors intheir defensive responsibilities. I would like an interim report on the datareview no later than February 1, 1964.[298] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn298] [../images/00040.jpeg]Figure 39. Kennedy Draft Memorandum to CIA Director McCone. Source: MajesticDocuments Kennedy’s reference to classified CIA and USAF sources of UFO reports show thathe was aware that they were systematically separated into classified andunclassified files. The USAF and the other military services were secretlyrequired to direct their most important UFO files, reported through the CIRVIS(Communications Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings) systemcreated for reporting vital intelligence data by Joint Army Air NavalPublication 146, to the CIA.[299] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn299] This issupported by a memorandum by Brigadier General C.H. Bolender on October 1969. Hewrote: “reports of unidentified flying objects which could affect nationalsecurity are made in accordance with JANAP 146 or Air Force Manual 55-11, andare not part of the Blue Book system.”[300] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn300]Put simply, there were two sets of UFO files being collected by the USAF duringthe Kennedy and later presidential administrations. Those with the leastnational security significance were made available to the public through ProjectBlue Book – the “official” public investigation of UFOs by the USAF, whichformally ended in 1970.[301] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn301] The moreimportant “classified UFO files” which revealed both extraterrestrial activityand the space operations of the Fourth Reich out of Antarctica, were directedinto another project that was under the control of the CIA. In particular, theCIA’s counterintelligence department controlled access and reported directly tothe MJ-12 Group. Requesting the CIA to share UFO files with NASA would in turnlead to its sharing this information with the State Department and otheragencies, as stipulated in NSAM 271. Kennedy was, therefore, directlyconfronting the CIA over its ultimate control of classified UFO files, andattempting to expose the existence of the Fourth Reich’s Antarctic spaceoperations.It is important to note that the Memorandum to the CIA Director refers to theNational Security Action Memorandum issued to Webb on the same day. Even thoughthe leaked Top Secret Memorandum to the CIA has not been officially acknowledged(its authenticity has been ranked medium-to-high level) [302][part0000_split_079.html#_edn302], there is no question about the legitimacy ofthe National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 271.[303][part0000_split_079.html#_edn303] NSAM 271 clearly showed that Kennedy haddecided to cooperate with the USSR on “Outer Space Matters”. If Kennedy had beenwarned about the dangers of future conflict with the Soviet Union and/or withextraterrestrial life, then sharing classified UFO files was an obvious way toimplement NSAM 271.NSAM 271, and the associated Top Secret Memorandum to the CIA Director issued onNovember 12, 1963, are evidence that Kennedy firmly linked cooperation with theUSSR on “outer space matters” with the release of classified UFO files. Kennedywas aware that the CIA was the lead agency for ensuring the release ofclassified UFO files, not the US Air Force. Project Blue Book, as many UFOresearchers have rightly concluded, was merely a public relations exercise.[304][part0000_split_079.html#_edn304] "},{"pageContent":"PRESIDENT KENNEDY’S UFO INITIATIVES LEAD TO IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSASSINATIONDIRECTIVE On November 12, 1963, President Kennedy had reached a broad agreement withSoviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev on joint space missions and sharing classifiedUFO files. This agreement required both leaders to instruct their respective UFOworking groups to share information. Kennedy did this through a November 12thTop Secret memorandum to the Director of the CIA to share UFO files with NASAand the USSR. His memorandum was relayed to James Jesus Angleton, who controlledaccess to the most highly classified UFO files in the U.S. and was in directcommunications with MJ-12, which in turn closely liaised with the Fourth Reich.Due to Kennedy’s request, Angleton followed a Top Secret/MJ-12 set ofdirectives. One of the secret directives, revealed in the leaked and partiallyburned Top Secret/MJ-12 document (forensically dated to 1961), was the crypticassassination directive. In case any senior U.S. official did not cooperate withMJ-12, the directive sanctioned political assassination. The leaked document issmoking gun evidence that former CIA Director Allen Dulles was involved indrafting and approving, along with six other MJ-12 members, a treasonous“assassination directive”. It is important to emphasize that the MJ-12“assassination directive” was later implemented by Angleton in direct responseto President Kennedy’s November 12, 1963 request to the CIA to releaseclassified UFO files.Kennedy’s 1963 efforts to end the Cold War, cooperate with the USSR on jointspace missions, and share classified UFO files with the Soviets, created a finalshowdown with MJ-12. The trigger was Kennedy’s fateful agreement with Khrushchevon November 12, 1963 on space cooperation that led to Kennedy’s Top Secret memoinstructing the new Director of the CIA, John McCone, to share all UFOinformation with NASA.[305] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn305] Due to NSAM 271,issued the same day, this would ensure that classified UFO files would be sharednot only with the USSR, but with the State Department and other U.S.agencies.[306] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn306] In short, the two memorandaKennedy issued on November 12th ensured access to classified UFO files thatwould extend to more government agencies, ultimately resulting in directPresidential access. This direct access had been denied to him by McCone’spredecessor, Allen Dulles. Dulles had engineered a means by which he could stilldeny Kennedy access to UFO information, even though he was out of office.Kennedy’s explosive Top Secret November 12, 1963 memo to the CIA Director wasrelayed by William Colby, then (Deputy) Chief of the CIA's Far East Division, toJames Angleton in CIA counterintelligence. It was Angleton who had been giventhe authority to implement “Project Environment” by the MJ-12 Group if thelatter’s operations were threatened. The threat that implemented the Directivewas the demand by the Kennedy administration for the CIA to release itsclassified UFO files.On the bottom of Kennedy’s Memorandum to the CIA, next to the signature space,appears the following handwriting: \"Response from Colby: Angleton has MJdirective 11/20/63.\" Colby is acknowledging that Angleton, two days beforeKennedy’s assassination, had the MJ directive – the burned document – and woulduse it to respond to Kennedy’s Memorandum. This handwriting directly implicatesthe MJ-12 Group and Angleton in the Kennedy assassination due to the crypticMJ-12 assassination directive. [../images/00041.jpeg]Figure 40. Handwriting at bottom of Nov 12, 1963 Kennedy Memorandum to CIADirector McCone: “Response from Colby – Angleton has MJ directive. 11/20/63”Source: Majestic Documents Therefore, the assassination of President Kennedy was the direct result of hisefforts to gain access to the CIA’s control of classified UFO files. Unknown toKennedy, a set of secret MJ-12 directives issued by his former CIA Director,Allen Dulles, ruled out any cooperation with Kennedy and his National Securitystaff on the UFO issue. It was Dulles and another six MJ-12 Group members whosanctioned the directives found in the burned document, including a vaguepolitical assassination directive against non-cooperative officials in theKennedy administration. This could be applied to Kennedy himself if the officialentrusted to carry out the MJ-12 Assassination Directive concluded that thePresident threatened MJ-12 operations.While Dulles and his six associates pre-authorized the assassination of anypolitical figure who threatened MJ-12 Group operations in late 1961, it wouldnot be implemented until later in the Kennedy Administration. The AssassinationDirective had been passed on to Dulles’ close ally James Jesus Angleton, the CIAcounterintelligence chief, for safekeeping and possible execution. Even thoughhe would no longer be CIA Director, Dulles had engineered a means whereby hewould still be able to deny Kennedy access to the CIA’s classified UFO files –and even deprive Kennedy of his life – if he demanded access to them.It was Kennedy’s joint space cooperation initiative with the USSR and the demandthat the CIA share all UFO information with NASA, the State Department and theSoviets that triggered the execution of the assassination plan. Kennedy’sNovember 12, 1963 Memorandum to CIA Director McCone for the CIA to share UFOinformation was judged to be a direct threat to MJ-12 Group operations andrisked exposing the Fourth Reich’s secret space program out of Antarctica.Colby’s handwritten reference to Angleton having the directive is verysignificant. It reveals how Angleton, in his official capacity as head of theCIA’s counterintelligence division and safe-keeper of the classified UFO files,was authorized to respond to any UFO ultimatum by the Kennedy administration.Angleton consequently made the decision to go ahead with the implementation ofthe Assassination Directive according to the classified instructions he receivedwhen the Directive was entrusted to him by Dulles in late 1961. The Directivethen was approved by the MJ-Group to whom Angleton ultimately answered. TheAssassination Directive had been cryptically written, thereby insulating theMJ-12 Group from possible blowback in the case of a leak. A seasoned covertoperative like Angleton knew its real meaning. It was Angleton who gave theorders for assembling a CIA hit team to assassinate President Kennedy in accordwith a set of cryptic instructions he had received in late 1961 by the MJ-12Group, which liaised closely with the Fourth Reich in setting policies designedto maintain secrecy over extraterrestrial life and secret space programs.Direct support for the CIA involvement in the Kennedy assassination due to hisefforts to share classified UFO files with the Soviet Union comes from formerCIA operative E. Howard Hunt. Hunt is best known for his role in the Watergateburglary of the Democratic National Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel. Hunt’strial and conviction captivated Washington, DC, and became known as the infamousWatergate Scandal.In one of the Nixon tapes, the disgraced former President discussed Hunt’simportance insofar as he had information that could blow open what reallyhappened in the Kennedy Assassination. Nixon told his Chief of Staff, H.R.Haldeman: [V]ery bad, to have this fellow Hunt, ah, you know, ah, it's, he, he knows toodamn much and he was involved, we happen to know that. And that it gets out thatthe whole, this is all involved in the Cuban thing, that it's a fiasco, and it'sgoing to make the FBI, ah CIA look bad, it's going to make Hunt look bad, andit's likely to blow the whole, uh, Bay of Pigs thing which we think would bevery unfortunate for CIA and for the country at this time, and for Americanforeign policy, and he just better tough it and lay it on them.[307][part0000_split_079.html#_edn307] In his memoirs, Haldeman later revealed that the “Bay of Pigs” was used by Nixonas a code word for the Kennedy assassination: “It seems that in all thosereferences to the Bay of Pigs, he was actually referring to the Kennedyassassination.”[308] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn308] Haldeman’s admissionclearly suggests that in Nixon’s view, Hunt was directly involved in the Kennedyassassination. [../images/00042.jpeg]Figure 41. E. Howard Hunt Military & CIA Service Record In his famous “last confession” to his son, Saint John, in 2007, Hunt confirmedhis involvement as a “bench warmer” for a CIA hit team planning theassassination.[309] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn309] Saint John Hunt discussedthe taped confession in the April 5, 2007 edition of Rolling StoneMagazine.[310] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn310] What is even more momentous,however, is what Howard Hunt told his Watergate legal advisor and friend,Douglas Caddy, about the reason for the JFK assassination.In a November 2017 interview with veteran UFO researcher, Linda Moulton Howe,Caddy for the first time publicly revealed what Hunt had confidentially confidedto him. And I said, “Howard, you told me about going into these Cuban government reportsat the Democratic National Committee and the Kennedy assassination. What was inthe reports? Why was Kennedy killed? Why were those reports so important?”Howard Hunt said, “Kennedy was killed because he was about to give our mostvital secret to the Soviet Union.”And I repeated, “Our most vital secret? What would that have been?”Howard leaned forward and looked in my eyes and he said, “The alien presence.”And he shook my hand and walked away.[311] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn311] Caddy’s disclosure of what Hunt had confided is extraordinary since it providespowerful corroboration that Kennedy’s plan to cooperate with the Soviets ingaining access to the CIA’s classified UFO files was the trigger for hisassassination.In assessing the assassination of President Kennedy in light of his attempt togain access to classified UFO files that would expose the existence of theFourth Reich’s Antarctica based space program, it would be fair to conclude thathis death was a combination of well-known domestic U.S. factors and a previouslyunknown international factor. Joseph Kennedy had made deals with both theItalian Mafia and the Fourth Reich to get his son elected. However, PresidentKennedy along with his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, pursuedpolicies that antagonized both the Mafia and the Fourth Reich. Kennedythreatened to expose not only the German Antarctica space program, but itsinfiltration of the U.S. military-industrial complex.The MJ-12 Group which had the responsibility for maintaining the secrecy system,laid the foundation for Kennedy’s removal through the eight directives it gaveto the CIA’s counter-intelligence chief, James Angleton, in 1961. Angleton wastherefore the intermediary for the confluence of powerful domestic and foreignelements that felt Kennedy had betrayed them, was a threat to future operations,and thus wanted him dead. The Kennedy Assassination marked both the death knellof the American Republic and the sinister influence of the Fourth Reich over allaspects of U.S. life, which extends to our current era."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 SIEMENS IMPLICATED IN TRACKING FORCED LABOR & SLAVES IN SPACE "},{"pageContent":"SIEMENS’ HISTORY OF SLAVE LABOR Europe’s largest engineering company today, Siemens AG, was the major corporatecontractor for the construction of key components and prototypes for spacecraftdeveloped secretly during World War II in Nazi Germany and Antarctica.Throughout that turbulent period, Siemens already loomed as the logical choicefor secretly supporting the industrial infrastructure for the German Antarcticaspace program due to its ingenuity, leadership and industrial prowess.During WWII, and immediately after, Siemens was headed by Herman von Siemens, aPh.D. in physical chemistry who was the Chairman of Siemens & Halske AG (founded1847), and its sister company, Siemens-Schuckertwerke AG (founded 1903). Thesetwo, and a third Siemens’ offshoot, Siemens-Reiniger-Werke (founded 1932), werecombined in 1966 to form the present day Siemens AG. It currently employs over350,000 people worldwide, and in fiscal year 2016 generated over US$80 billionin revenue.[312] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn312]After Nazi Germany’s defeat, Herman von Siemens was detained on December 5, 1945for questioning over the Siemens companies use of slave labor. According to thepublic record: He was brought to the Nuremberg trials as a prisoner to deal with war crimecharges, but finally no prosecution was filed, as there were no personalmisdeeds traceable. The charges were dropped, so he could return as head ofcompany in 1948.[313] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn313] It is certain that von Siemens would have been heavily interrogated over hisknowledge of the Siemens companies’ participation in the building of spacecraftfor the Nazi and Antarctica programs. As noted earlier, it is all but certainthat Siemens companies had established subsidiaries in Antarctica, and moved alot of equipment and resources down there. It is very plausible that hiscooperation was a factor in his release without trial to resume leadership ofthe Siemens companies.Despite von Siemens release without charges being filed, it is undisputed thatthe Siemens companies he headed extensively used slave labor in their manyfactories hidden all over Nazi Germany. It took decades, but on September 24,1998, Siemens AG decided to begin compensating victims of its former slave laborpractices as the following Associated Press Report described: Siemens announced plans Wednesday for a $12-million fund to compensate formerslave laborers forced to work for the firm by the Nazis during World War II….Almost a year ago, at its 150th anniversary celebrations, the company hadinsisted that it could do no more for its former slave laborers than express“deepest regrets.” The Munich-based Siemens said its fund is in addition to the$4.3 million it paid to the Jewish Claims Conference in 1961 and to providinghumanitarian help for victims. Siemens estimates that between 10,000 and 20,000slave laborers worked in its wartime factories.[314][part0000_split_079.html#_edn314] Siemens’ role in acknowledging its wartime use of slave labor and efforts tocompensate victims was a step in the right direction, but the size of thecompensation fund, when compared to the up to 20,000 people abused, isshamefully astounding. Their acknowledgement, coming forty years after theevents in question, leads to troubling questions over whether the company wassincere or simply wishing to avoid class action lawsuits then underway in theUnited States, which promised to award far more to the former slave laborers: The threat of lawsuits has raised the pressure on German firms to pay directclaims to the thousands of concentration camp inmates, mostly Jews, forced towork in their factories. Lawyers representing former slave laborers criticizedSiemens, as they did Volkswagen, for setting up a fund to avoid larger paymentsa lawsuit might demand. Siemens is seeking “the cheapest alternative,” saidMunich attorney Michael Witti, who with a colleague filed the U.S. lawsuit.[315] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn315] Readers might be forgiven for believing that the compensation of former slavelaborers is an issue long past and only associated with a terrible chapter inour recent history. However, there is credible whistleblower testimony that suchpractices continue and Siemens is still involved. "},{"pageContent":"SIEMENS COVERTLY BUILDS BILLIONS OF RFID CHIPS THAT CAN TRACK SLAVE LABOR William Pawelec was a computer operations and programming expert with the US AirForce, who started his own electronics security company, and worked for highprofile U.S. defense contractors such as SAIC and EG&G. He received high-levelsecurity clearances and had access to many classified projects. Prior to 2001,Pawelec decided to reveal what he knew about deep black projects that werehiding advanced technologies from the U.S. public. He gave an interview to Dr.Steven Greer with the strict instruction that it would only be published afterhis death. He died on May 22, 2007 and the video was published posthumously onDecember 14, 2010.[316] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn316]Among his many revelations was information concerning the development of thefirst electronic RFID tracking chips that were developed as early as 1979.Pawelec explained the history of their development, and the role hisDenver-based company played in setting up meetings with government agencies,which were interested in using the chips for security purposes. In his videointerview with Dr. Greer, Pawelec said: At the time in the security industry, a lot of us had a lot of concerns abouttracking and locating people that had been kidnapped. Particularly what wasgoing on in Europe at the time where we were having NATO officers, even thePrime Minister of Italy, kidnapped … These people were drained [of information]or they were brutalized or both … One of the goals of the industry was todevelop technology that would allow us to track these people or locate themquickly. Hopefully to save their lives but on a secondary basis to keep frombeing drained of sensitive information.[317] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn317] He further explained that the tracking chips, which were very small and shapedlike a pill, had multiple functions: Now this particular pill shaped device, very minute, had a lot of flexibility inits capabilities. It was basically almost a transponder. You could send afrequency to it and it would respond back with its unique number which could notbe changed once the chip was made. Yet there were a lot of capabilities thatcould be added to this chip such as monitoring temperature, blood pressure,pulse, and even wave forms out of the brain.[318][part0000_split_079.html#_edn318] [../images/00043.jpeg]Figure 42. RFID Chip compared to grain of rice. Source: Wikipedia Soon after demonstrating an even more sophisticated lithium niobate chip in1984, which could be tracked from a distance of 120 kilometers in space, Pawelecsaid he discovered a small Silicon Valley company had been set up to manufacturebillions of them. He learned that “after they had made billions and billions ofthese little chips” the factory was shut down a year later, and all informationabout the chips disappeared.[319] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn319]The small company responsible for making the billions of tiny chips, accordingto Pawelec: [W]as a division of a rather major European electronics firm that had the plant.Siemens. What concerned me was that they had built these chips and who knowswhat happened to them, and they built them in the billions in volume, becausethey are so small that you could take a six-inch wafer and make hundreds ofthousands of them on a wafer, and they've disappeared somewhere.[320][part0000_split_079.html#_edn320] Pawelec’s statement here is very significant since it shows how a giantconglomerate like Siemens can easily set up U.S. subsidiaries to build productsuseful to the German secret space program in Antarctica, and then dissolve thesubsidiary in a way that is very difficult to track and investigate.Pawelec went on to describe how his colleague, “Bob”, the former head ofsecurity for the U.S. State Department, was assassinated in Nairobi, Kenya,because he was getting too close to learning about the people who had gainedcontrol over the tracking chip technology and had built billions of them for anunknown purpose. According to Pawelec, the people behind Bob’s assassination hadinfiltrated the U.S. military-industrial complex at its highest level, and couldintimidate and silence anyone: Bob was killed and it was a hit, and it's always concern me today that he hadgotten a little too close to who had been involved with this implantable chiptechnology we've been trying to, for couple years then, quietly trying to findout who had been doing it without our government realizing it was going on.Whoever it is has got total ability to penetrate anytime anywhere our governmentand locate what is going on instantly. Research since the early eighties on myown and with some friends indicates that we have at least four power groups inthe world. They have wealth beyond all imagination, they have advancedtechnologies, they have taken over various programs, particularly blackprograms, within our government and probably even the Russian government, andthe Chinese. Politics to them, as we know it, is not the same; and they haveagendas totally unlike what ... we perceive our government's agenda is reallyare and that they are able to track unbelievably what's going on around at aminute level.[321] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn321] Here, Pawelec alludes to the Fourth Reich, which had begun infiltrating theupper echelons of military and corporate power in the U.S. since the Eisenhoweradministration.Pawelec’s testimony suggests that the Siemens corporation had acquired therights and control over the tracking chip technology, built billions of them inless than a year using a U.S. subsidiary, and then arranged for the localmanufacturing plant to close with all information vanishing about the trackingchips. Importantly, the Siemens corporation was associated with a powerful forceembedded within the U.S. military-industrial complex, which was intent on hidingthe true purpose of the RFID chips. This hidden force possessed the power toremove anyone who got too close to learning the truth, even the head of securityat a U.S. Embassy.It is worth repeating that the main function of the tiny chips, according toPawelec, was to track people and even monitor their key physiological processesover large distances. This leads to the question; why would the Siemenscorporation need billions of chips to monitor people over large distances? Theanswer that emerges from what has already been discussed is that the RFIDtracking chips were needed for the slave laborers used in Antarctica and in thespace colonies established by the German breakaway civilization.The Antarctic German colony had an extensive number of bases that used slavelabor, and likely exported captured humans as slaves for off-planet use as well.The unique individual identifiers within the RFID chips would provide a means,for whoever had purchased or acquired the slave labor, to be able to monitortheir human assets using advanced satellite surveillance systems. Support forsuch a disturbing conclusion comes from William Tompkins and Corey Goode, whose‘insider testimonies’ have revealed many details of the German secret spaceprogram operating out of Antarctica.In a nutshell, both Goode and Tompkins claim that the Antarctica based Germansinfiltrated the U.S. military-industrial complex using Operation Paperclipscientists. As discussed earlier in this book, thousands of German scientistsand engineers were fast tracked into senior positions in the U.S.military-industrial complex. Major U.S. corporations had been infiltrated alongwith many leading aerospace and engineering companies in Europe, Japan andelsewhere.[322] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn322]The Siemens company, with its long history of being a major armaments supplierfor the German military, was a natural conduit for further penetration of theU.S. military-industrial complex. Pawelec had learned about the strangeinfluence exercised over the U.S. military-industrial complex by German eliteswhen he traveled to the Tonopah Test Range for a classified project. AfterPawelec’s death, his wife, Mary Joyce Annie DeRiso, shared more of theinformation that Pawelec had told her about the Tonopah incident, and who wasreally in control of the U.S. military.DeRiso shared her information in an interview she gave about Pawelec’s testimonywhich was presented in Greer’s Disclosure Project video: His disenchantment began when he was called to give what he thought was going tobe a regular project status report at Tonapah. The meeting was held in a heavilycontrolled room that was built like a Faraday cage making it impossible forcommunications to come in or out of the sealed room. Briefcases, papers, pagersand any form of identification were not allowed at that meeting … Only thegenerals could be recognized by their uniforms. The tension was really high andBill was surprised at how nervous the high-ranking generals were. He knewsomething BIG was up. Bill saw a private jet escorted by two of our militaryjets land on the tarmac. Surprisingly, this private jet rolled all the way tothe building where the meeting was scheduled as the escort jets departed. A veryimposing man stepped out of the jet and entered the room. He was relativelytall, and wore a very expensive European suit. His shoes and briefcase wereequally luxurious and there was an aide or bodyguard by his side. His demeanorwas very aristocratic and he spoke with a High German accent. The room waselectrified with nervous tension as each person gave his status report andanswered questions.When everyone had spoken, the German man thanked them for their good work andsimply left. He was never introduced nor identified in anyway. It is believed hewas Baron Jesco von Puttkamer, one of the Germans who came to the United Stateswith Werner von Braun. Whatever happened that day convinced Bill that the UnitedStates, and probably the whole world, was being controlled by Europeans … butexactly who ‘they’ were was the big question.It drove Bill and his friends on a quest to find out what was really going on.After that, he frequently quoted his friend Jim Marrs who often says, ‘The Nazismay have lost the battles but they won the war.’[323][part0000_split_079.html#_edn323] Based on deRiso’s interview, Pawelec believed that remnants of the Nazi regimehad survived WWII, and that German elites were now in control of Western Europeand the United States.The testimony of Pawelec’s widow is markedly significant since it reveals herhusband’s final conclusion over who really controls the U.S. military-industrialcomplex. Notably, this conclusion matches what Corey Goode and Bill Tompkinslater revealed. Many talented German scientists had been brought into the U.S.under Operation Paperclip, and fast tracked into senior leadership positions inNASA, U.S. corporations, and the military industrial complex more generally.This finally takes us to the question of what purpose the Siemens company hadfor building billions of chips for tracking humans from 120 kilometers in space? "},{"pageContent":"SIEMENS AND THE GALACTIC SLAVE TRADE In a Cosmic Disclosure interview, William Tompkins explained how the Nazis hadused slave labor during WWII, transferred them to Antarctica and today still useslaves: Germany had massive underground facilities that were all [using] slaves and evento the extent that when the decision was made before the war ended that theywere going to continue all of their extraterrestrial developments on UFOs and onevery weapon system that they were building, they took the production facilitiesto Antarctica, but they also brought the slaves with them. So now there areslaves underneath the ground and they still are today in Antarctica.[324][part0000_split_079.html#_edn324] Tompkins went on to describe a galactic slave trade: But the slave business out there is a big business, and this is happening today.It's not something that happened 100 years ago. This has been going on a longtime and that needs to be fixed. There's many different classes of people thatare abducted for slavery, sexual slavery. They want the top and the smartest,because they are worth more.They have, I think, four or five different levels of people that they abduct.They abduct top medical research people. They abduct the corporate levels, andthey abduct the most brilliant levels, and then they go down through the threelevels and that says where they get sectioned off.Everybody gets to two planets and then it's decided where they're going to besent to. But it's a massive business. It's been going on for years, and we can'tidentify where these people have gone. Just like 'normal' abductions, we don'tknow where they went, because most of them don't come back. We're only hearingfrom the few that came back.[325] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn325] In an email interview, Goode outlined the development of a galactic slave tradethat involved extraterrestrials and national elites secretly in control of Earthgovernments and militaries. He said this was achieved through a network ofcorporations, called the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate (ICC): The Secret Earth Governments and their Syndicates discovered that a large amountof humans were being taken off the planet by various ET’s anyway, so theydecided to find a way to profit from it and have control over which people werebeing taken. In prior arrangements they were made promises of receivingtechnologies and biological specimens for allowing groups to abduct humans, butthe ET’s rarely delivered on their promises. Once they had developed theadvanced infrastructure (ICC) in our Sol System, along with advancedtechnologies (that some of the thousands of ET groups traveling through oursystem were now interested in obtaining) and now had the ability to deter mostunwelcome guests from entering Earths airspace, the Cabal/ICC then decided touse human trafficking as one of their resources in interstellar bartering.[326][part0000_split_079.html#_edn326] Tompkins and Goode’s revelations provide an answer to why the Siemens companychose to build billions of trackable chips with unique identifiers. It is highlylikely these chips were used to monitor the galactic slave trade, as well asforced labor in Antarctica, and in secret colonies on Mars and elsewhere withinour solar system. Satellites or spacecraft could track RFID embedded humans,thereby providing the German space program intelligence on where and how slavelabor was being used.It has already been established that in 1998, Siemens AG acknowledged itsinvolvement in the Nazi practice of using slave labor and agreed to compensatethose forced to work in its companies. Siemens publically announced theestimated number to be between 10,000 to 20,000 victims.[327][part0000_split_079.html#_edn327] If the testimonies of Pawelec, Tompkins andGoode are accurate, then the number of victims of a continuing practice ofsecret forced labor and slave trade in space have become incredibly larger. Bytracking of victims in an illicit galactic slave trade, through tiny RFID chips,the Siemens corporation is complicit. Eventually, Siemens and any othercorporations involved in exploiting forced labor in secret space colonies or agalactic slave trade will eventually have to confess to their involvement, facejustice, and compensate victims of these vast undisclosed crimes againsthumanity. This will only occur after the truth emerges about events inAntarctica, and when the secrecy system implemented there is overcome."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10THE ANTARCTIC TREATY & KEEPING THE GERMAN SPACE PROGRAM SECRET "},{"pageContent":"KEY ELEMENTS OF THE ANTARCTIC TREATY On June 23, 1961, the Antarctic Treaty went into force after being ratified byits 12 original signatory nations: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France,Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdomand the United States. Currently, there are 50 nations party to the Treaty,including those with major aerospace programs such as Brazil, China, Germany,India and Italy.The Treaty stipulates that Antarctica is to be used for peaceful purposes toadvance human knowledge. The stationing of military forces and all forms ofweapons development and testing are outlawed under article 1 of the Treaty: 1. Antarctica shall be used for peaceful purposes only. There shall beprohibited, inter alia, any measures of a military nature, such as theestablishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of militarymaneuvers, as well as the testing of any type of weapons.[328][part0000_split_079.html#_edn328] In addition to the permanent demilitarization of Antarctica, articles 2 and 3outline the extent to which Treaty signatories will cooperate in scientificexploration: Article IIFreedom of scientific investigation in Antarctica and cooperation toward thatend, as applied during the International Geophysical Year, shall continue,subject to the provisions of the present treaty. Article III1. In order to promote international cooperation in scientific investigation inAntarctica, as provided for in Article II of the present treaty, the ContractingParties agree that, to the greatest extent feasible and practicable:(a) information regarding plans for scientific programs in Antarctica shall beexchanged to permit maximum economy and efficiency of operations;(b) scientific personnel shall be exchanged in Antarctica between expeditionsand stations;(c) scientific observations and results from Antarctica shall be exchanged andmade freely available.[329] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn329] Verification is critical for any successful international treaty, since nationshave to be sure that their strategic rivals are not taking advantage ofcooperative nations behind closed doors. Article VII describes how contractingnations can send observers to any base in Antarctica to ensure full complianceof the Treaty provisions: Article VII1. In order to promote the objectives and ensure the observance of theprovisions of the present treaty, each Contracting Party whose representativesare entitled to participate in the meetings referred to in Article IX of thetreaty shall have the right to designate observers to carry out any inspectionprovided for by the present Article. Observers shall be nationals of theContracting Parties which designate them. The names of observers shall becommunicated to every other Contracting Party having the right to designateobservers, and like notice shall be given of the termination of theirappointment.[330] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn330] Article IX outlines how future meetings of Treaty signatories could act in waysto further the Treaty’s key goals: (a) use of Antarctica for peaceful purposes only;(b) facilitation of scientific research in Antarctica;(c) facilitation of international scientific cooperation in Antarctica;(d) facilitation of the exercise of the rights of inspection provided for inArticle VII of the treaty;(e) questions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction in Antarctica;(f) preservation and conservation of living resources in Antarctica. [331][part0000_split_079.html#_edn331] The Secretariat for the Antarctic Treaty was established in Buenos Aires,Argentina. The U.S. Antarctic Guide explains the functions of the Treaty’sSecretariat: The Antarctic Treaty consultative parties established a secretariat in BuenosAires, Argentina, for support of Antarctic Treaty activities. Besides assistingwith preparation for annual meetings, the Secretariat also is responsible forinformation related to the Treaty System and the Protocol.[332][part0000_split_079.html#_edn332] The Treaty was heralded as a major step forward for turning Antarctica into avast nature preserve to be studied in a peaceful way for the benefit of allhumanity. Here is how the U.S. Antarctic Guide explained this allegedachievement: The treaty is a remarkable achievement whose primary success has been to reservethe area south of 60 degrees South latitude as a zone of peace: it prohibitsmeasures of a military nature, including fortifications, and it prohibitsnuclear explosions and the disposal of radioactive waste. It gives treatyparties the right to inspect all areas of Antarctica, including stations,installations, equipment, ships and airplanes of other member states, to ensurecontinuing adherence to the treaty.[333] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn333] Similarly, a 1969 New York Times editorial stated: [T]he Antarctic Treaty helped to create foundations of mutual confidence onwhich great diplomatic landmarks were based, notably the test ban treaty of1963, the space compact of 1967, and the nuclear nonproliferation pact of 1968.Later thinkers saw Antarctic Treaty influence on the 1979 Moon treaty and the1982 Law of the Sea convention.[334] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn334] However, at the core of the Antarctica Treaty a major lie was hidden, known onlyto a few of its major signatories. While the signatory nations pledged tomaintain Antarctica as a demilitarized zone dedicated to peaceful developmentand scientific exploration, already present deep inside the continent’s interiorresided a flourishing German space program that stood in violation of all thekey elements of the Antarctic Treaty. Major military installations were built inAntarctica by the German space program during World War II, and advanced weaponsresearch has continued at a vigorous pace since the war’s end, deep below theice shelf unknown to the world public.What had fatally undermined the Treaty was that the Fourth Reich, which hadsuccessfully established safe havens in Antarctica and South America after WWII,was neither acknowledged nor recognized by the international diplomatic systemas a state. This meant that German bases in Antarctica were under no clearinternational legal authority since Germany had been divided in two after theNazi defeat. On February 5, 1979, its western half, the Federal Republic ofGermany, gave their consent to be bound by the Antarctic Treaty.[335][part0000_split_079.html#_edn335] However, neither German state was in anyposition to assert authority over the Fourth Reich bases in Antarctica. As faras the Antarctic Treaty signatories were concerned, the hidden German bases wereignored, and an international pretense that they simply didn’t exist wasmaintained.Furthermore, Buenos Aires, where the Secretariat for the Antarctic Treaty wasestablished, was a well-known center for Nazi exiles, including MartinBormann.[336] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn336] As previously presented, the USArmy Intelligence file titled the “Red House Report” exposed how Bormann hadstarted preparations for a post-War Nazi economic revival from locations such asArgentina. Adolf Hitler had joined with Bormann in Argentina as a number ofofficial government documents and eyewitness testimonies have indicated.[337][part0000_split_079.html#_edn337] Argentina, through the high-level Nazis whoescaped there, was the unofficial capital of the Fourth Reich. This meant thatthe Fourth Reich, through its covert presence in Argentina, would effectively beable to monitor and manipulate the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat to achieve itsgoals.The way in which the Antarctic Treaty undermined U.S. dominance and militaryoperations in Antarctica was noted by some U.S. Senators who strongly denouncedratification, as explained in an article in the Antarctica Sun: “I rise in opposition to the ratification of this treaty” echoed in thechambers. The U.S.S.R. had signed it and couldn’t be trusted, the United Stateshad failed to take possession of territory despite “solid claims to some 80percent of the Antarctic,” we would forfeit future economic potential, andnuclear explosions were banned. “We are trading what I would call a horse for arabbit,” one Senator said, “to get the concessions the treaty would grant in theway of international amity and accord.”[338] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn338] Compounding the situation further were the U.S. corporations that began workingas military contractors for the German Antarctica space program as a result ofthe Eisenhower administration agreement. Operation Paperclip scientists, who hadthoroughly penetrated the U.S. military-industrial complex and NASA, couldidentify any new promising technologies or products and then have them secretlybuilt for the German space program. These would either be secretly shipped toAntarctica, or assembled there. What Siemens AG did through a U.S. shelf companyin building billions of RFID chips was a pattern that would repeat itself aroundthe world.Essentially, while signatory nations would build bases on the surface ofAntarctica and commit themselves to the Antarctic Treaty articles, the Germanrun space program would not be restrained by any of the Treaty’s provisions. Asa non-signatory entity in Antarctica, which was ignored by Treaty signatories,the Fourth Reich was free to conduct advanced military-related research anddevelopment without troublesome observer inspections. This made the FourthReich’s underground Antarctica facilities an attractive partner for major U.S.and European armaments companies interested in advanced weapons research anddevelopment.U.S. and European corporate contractors that conducted operations at the GermanAntarctic facilities were able to pursue advanced military research in ways thatwere unfettered by Antarctic Treaty provisions. Any kind of military researchthat gave a qualitative edge to the German run space program could be expectedto flourish, with major support by U.S. and European corporations. The slavelabor policy that was adopted for the German Antarctica facilities, for example,provided abundant human subjects for advanced genetic experiments andbio-weapons research. In an upcoming chapter, I will discuss alarming claimsthat hundreds of thousands of slaves have been sacrificed in large scalebiological experiments. "},{"pageContent":"FORMATION OF THE INTERPLANETARY CORPORATE CONGLOMERATE After the 1955 agreement was reached with the Eisenhower administration, thereslowly emerged an international consortium of corporations building all the keycomponents for craft to be used in the German Antarctica space program. By the1980’s, this international consortium had its own fleets of spacecraft making upa powerful corporate run space program, which operated alongside the German-runprogram based deep beneath the Antarctica ice shelf.Corey Goode has described the original German Antarctica space program as the“Dark Fleet”, since its operations were largely unknown to the space programbeing run by the US Navy – Solar Warden.[339] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn339]The corporate run program that emerged was called the Interplanetary CorporateConglomerate (ICC), and it quickly rose as a powerful rival to the Navy’s SolarWarden program, which became operational in the early 1980’s according to bothWilliam Tompkins and Goode.[340] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn340]The ICC was a fusion of the key German companies that had first establishedoperations in Antarctica during WWII, along with the U.S., European and othercorporations that began collaborating with the Antarctic based Germans. Overtime, this led to large industrial bases being built in Antarctica where the ICCcould conduct its weapons research, build advanced craft for the Dark Fleet(which primarily operated outside of our solar system), and its own separatespace fleet that was used by the ICC for its operations on Mars and elsewhere inthe solar system. About the ICC, Goode wrote: The ICC has an entire industrial infrastructure that includes bases, stations,outposts, mining operations and facilities on Mars, various moons and spreadthroughout the main asteroid belt (where a “Super Earth Planet” once existed).They have facilities to take raw materials and turn them into usable materialsto produce both complex metals and composite materials that our materialsciences have not dreamt of yet. They have separate groups of facilities thatproduce various types of technologies as well as each facility or plant thatproduces a specific component of a technology so that those working in thefacilities and living in the support colonies/bases do not know exactly whatthey are producing. Much of the time the components are multiuse and are used incross over projects. There are facilities on Earth [e.g. Antarctica] thatoperate in much the same manner that contribute to the SSP on severallevels.[341] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn341] The key to ensuring activities deep below the Antarctic ice shelf would remainpublicly hidden was to keep the world media and general public out ofAntarctica, and strictly monitor all scientific research by Antarctic Treatysignatories so the scientific community, conducting legitimate environmentalresearch, did not learn the truth. A final step was to keep any discoveries ofancient artifacts secret to guarantee that no one learned about Antarctica’sextensive ancient cavern system and the artifacts retrieved from ancientcivilizations.These became high priority policies for the Dark Fleet and the ICC. In this way,their Antarctic operations remained hidden for decades within a frozen continentthat would persist as an enigma for the world public. The secrecy policy haddramatic effects for any nations or intrepid explorers who wanted to openAntarctica up to the rest of the world. One of the Antarctica Treaty’s originalsignatory nations, New Zealand, found out how high the cost to be paid was bycountries wanting to open up the continent for international tourism. "},{"pageContent":"AIR NEW ZEALAND FLIGHT TE 901 ANTARCTICA CRASH Beginning in February 1977, Air New Zealand began offering tourist flights fromAuckland, with a stopover in Christchurch, to Antarctica’s Ross Ice Shelf. Theroute took tourists over various island groups, a flyby of the massive volcano,Mt. Erebus, and a loop around McMurdo base. The flights proved quite popular andby 1979, four flights were offered. Then on November 28, 1979, disaster struck. [../images/00044.jpeg]Figure 43. Route of Air New Zealand Antarctic flights Air New Zealand flight TE 901 crashed into Antarctica’s Mt. Erebus, killing all257 passengers and crew. The New Zealand Airline Pilots Association gave detailsof how Flight TE901 mysteriously flew off course and directly into the mountain: On the night before the flight, flight planners made what they thought was asmall correction to an earlier mistake made some months previously, when theflight plans were computerized. In their mind, they were only shifting the finalAntarctic waypoint about two miles, which was about the expected error usuallyfound in flights of a similar duration. Now, according to the airline witnesses,the navigation staff always knew the track ran more or less directly over Mt.Erebus, and the shifting of the waypoint some two miles would still run thetrack more or less over the volcano. But in fact, what they had done was toshift the route from McMurdo Sound, to over Mt. Erebus, a change of nearly 30nautical miles.[342] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn342] The initial investigation concluded that pilot error was responsible, but apublic outcry over the findings led to a Royal Commission being convened. It wasconducted by the highly respected justice, Peter Mahon, QC. A summary of Mahon’sfindings included: … the coordinates in the navigation computer had been changed without tellingthe crew or the flight followers at Mac Center. At the time of the crash, TE901was flying in local whiteout conditions (in clear air under cloud cover, butwith no surface definition), but most of the flight had been in clear air…. Asit was, the flight crew was confident of their position and flight path untilthe collision alarms sounded just before the crash.[343][part0000_split_079.html#_edn343] Mahon concluded that Air New Zealand executives had conducted \"an orchestratedlitany of lies\" to evade the airline’s responsibility for the disastrous coursecorrection made to the flight, and instead steered blame towards the pilot forthe crash.[344] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn344] Mahon’s findings proved verycontroversial and led to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Robert Muldoon,challenging him to name the “conspirators and liars”. [345][part0000_split_079.html#_edn345] Mahon’s report led to a successful appeal byAir New Zealand, and his damaging findings were overturned. Controversycontinues to this day over ultimate responsibility for the crash, and Mahon’sfindings.[346] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn346]Mahon’s conclusion that there had been a conspiracy, “an orchestrated litany oflies” by the airline to hide the truth behind the crash, strongly alludes to thereal culprits responsible for the tragedy. The course correction, made withoutinforming the flight crew, was not merely incompetence, but in reality a case ofsabotage by forces not wanting tourist activities occurring in Antarctica. TheICC, with its vast global corporate resources, including embedded assets inmajor airlines such as Air New Zealand, is the most likely candidate for themysterious chain of events that led to the TE 901 crash into Mt. Erebus.Up to 1994, when Australia’s Qantas Airlines began tourist flights once againover Antarctica, tourist flights did not occur, thereby minimizing damagingsightings of Antarctica’s many anomalies.[347] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn347]Throughout the entire recent history of Antarctica, however, there have beenregular military flights occurring, and sometimes a brave crew member takes therisk and comes forward to reveal some of the sighted anomalies.

He wrote a letter to veteran UFOresearcher Linda Moulton Howe and used only his first name “Brian” to tell hisstory, since he currently works with a major corporate contractor. He suppliedvarious documents to Howe including his military discharge papers (DD214), andconsented to several public interviews with her where he appeared as a highlycredible source giving details about ongoing events in Antarctica.[348][part0000_split_079.html#_edn348] In 2016, I briefly met Brian, and later,together with freelance journalist, Kathryn Leishman, tracked down a formerAntarctic worker who importantly recalled Brian from a 1984 flight squadronyearbook, and thereby confirmed that he was genuine as a whistleblower. Plane [../images/00045.jpeg]Figure 44. A Lockheed LC-130F Hercules ski-equipped VXE-6 at the Amundsen–ScottSouth Pole Station. Image courtesy of Brian. In his letter to Howe, Brian described three anomalous events, each of whichcasts further light on several topics already raised in earlier chapters. Hesupplied a map of Antarctica with red crosses marking the locations of each ofthe incidents he described in his letter (see Figure 46).In one incident that occurred in the 1985/86 polar season, “Brian” was orderedto transport a sick scientist from Australia’s Davis Base to McMurdo base inAntarctica. In flying from McMurdo, Brian and his crew flew directly over arestricted air space of the South Polar base, Amundson Scott. While doing this,he witnessed a large hole going directly into the ice and extending deep intothe interior: Another unique issue with South Pole station is that our aircraft was notallowed to fly over a certain area designated 5 miles from the [Amundsen-Scott]station. The reason stated because of an air sampling camp in that area. This did not make any sense to any of us on the crew because on 2 differentoccasions we had to fly over this area. One time due to a medical evacuation ofthe Australian camp called Davis Camp. It was on the opposite side of the continent and we had to refuel at South Poleand a direct course to this Davis Camp was right over the air sampling station. The only thing we saw going over this camp was a very large hole going into theice. You could fly one of our LC130 into this thing.It was after this medevac mission where we [were] briefed by some spooks(Intelligence Agents I presumed) from Washington, DC and told not to speak ofthe area we overflew.[349] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn349] Brian described that the hole looked as though it was naturally formed, and notartificially made with equipment.[350] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn350] This isvery significant since recently scientists have confirmed the effect ofheightened volcanic activity under the ice caps, which is causing the surfaceice to move up and down by melting the ice under the surface.[351][part0000_split_079.html#_edn351] This raises the possibility that volcanicactivity is causing the holes on the surface as escaping heat rises all the wayup through miles of ice. More about this phenomenon will be explored later in achapter presenting the testimony of Corey Goode concerning secret excavations ofan ancient pre-flood civilization under the Antarctic ice sheets.In a November 2017 radio interview, Brian added that the opening of the SouthPole hole appeared to be descending like a ramp into the interior, rather than asteep vertical drop.[352] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn352] He and other crewmembers saw snow mobile marks going into the hole from the Amundson-Scottstation about five miles away. This implies that an operation was underway,whereby equipment and personnel were being moved back and forth from the stationinto a location somewhere inside the hole.Brian also responded to a question by Howe about the chatter he was picking upabout a joint human-extraterrestrial (EBE) base located in the area near theSouth Pole and the large hole: We are told not to talk among ourselves officially. But the guys after a flight,you have a few beers and it's like, 'I heard these scientists talking about thatthere's some guys there at Pole that were working with these strange-looking'men.' They weren't saying, you know, 'alien' or 'extraterrestrial,' orwhatever. And that the air sampling station was actually a joint base with thescientists and the E.T.’s.[353] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn353] Brian emphasized that he, himself, never directly heard what scientists weresaying about the joint base, and that it comes second-hand from his flightcrew.[354] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn354] While these are only second-handreports, they do help corroborate that agreements had been reached in the1950’s, whereby the U.S. government started to work with a German-Reptilianalliance in Antarctica. [../images/00046.jpeg]Figure 45. Locations of Antarctic anomalies described by Brian. In the next incident, Brian described repeatedly seeing during the 1995/96season, silver disc-shaped craft flying over the Transantarctic mountain range: Between these two stations [McMurdo and Davis] is a mountain range called theTrans Antarctic’s. With what we called Severe Clear weather from McMurdo toSouth Pole the Trans Antarctic’s are visible from the altitudes which theaircraft flew approximately 25,000 to 35,000 feet.On several flights to and from South Pole our crew viewed air vehicles dartingaround the tops of Trans Antarctic’s almost exactly in the same spot every timewe would fly by and view them. This is very unusual for air traffic down there due to the fact that the onlyaircraft flying on the continent were our squadron aircraft. Every aircraft knewwhere the other aircraft were due to flight schedules being followed.[355][part0000_split_079.html#_edn355] The significance of this incident is that it reveals that Antarctica is host toat least one secret base possessing saucer-shaped craft similar to the Vril andHaunebu vehicles developed by Nazi Germany, which were reported in the 1947attack against Admiral Byrd’s Operation Highjump.The final incident involved a group of around 15 scientists that went missingwhile doing 3 weeks of field work in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica during the1994/95 season as Brian best recalls. The scientists were out of radiocommunications for a two week period when Brian’s team was sent out toinvestigate and found them missing from their base, as he explained in hisletter: One outlying camp (near Marie Byrd Land) we dropped scientists and theirequipment it was out of communication with McMurdo for 2 weeks. Our crew flewback to the camp to find out if the scientists were ok. We found no one thereand no sign of any foul play. The Radio was working fine as we called McMurdo to verify it working properly.We left the camp and flew back to McMurdo as ordered by our CO. A week later theScientist showed back up to their camp and called McMurdo for someone to comepick them up. Our crew got the flight back there to pick them since we put them into that campand we knew the terrain and location. None of the scientists would talk to anyof the crew on the plane and to me they looked scared.As soon as we landed back at McMurdo they (Scientists) where put on another ofour squadron aircraft and flown to Christchurch New Zealand. We never heardabout them again. Their equipment that we brought back from the camp was put in quarantine andshipped back to the United States escorted by the same spooks that debriefed usabout our flying over of the air sample camp/ large hole in the ice.[356][part0000_split_079.html#_edn356] Brian’s statement that the scientists were not at their camp when he was firstsent to investigate, suggests that they had discovered or were taken into theinterior of Antarctica. It’s worth noting that their location was in thevicinity of one of the buried volcanoes that is linked to large caverns formedout of thermal activities. Brian emphasized that the scientists were scared andwouldn’t talk.In his November 2017 interview, Brian said the scientists appeared to besuffering from PTSD, and that after he and his flight crew had returned thescientists’ equipment back to Christchurch, New Zealand, they were againdebriefed to remain silent about what they saw at McMurdo.[357][part0000_split_079.html#_edn357] Brian says that he later heard from anotheraircrew that after his aircrew’s return of the scientists’ equipment to McMurdo,it was sent to a base in Ohio. He agreed with Howe that the equipment was mostlikely taken to Wright Patterson Air Force Base for evaluation.Conspicuously, in 2016, after Brian met with researcher Linda Moulton Howe todiscuss the missing scientists and other anomalies, he received a threateningphone call. He detailed this conversation to Howe: “And the voice on the other end of the line said, ‘Is this Brian?’I said, ‘Yes, who is this?’ because I didn’t recognize the number. ‘I want totell you that what you have been talking about you need to stop talking about.’And I said, ‘Well, what stuff was that?’And he says, ‘We know that you were with Linda Howe on last Thursday night andwe know that you went to dinner at a Mexican restaurant in Joshua Tree and wewere aware of what you were talking about with her and other people and thatyour experience that you had when you were on the ice when you were in theservice, we don’t want you talking about that. Specifically, we don’t want youtalking about the scientists that you picked up after being missing for a coupleof weeks.’And I said, ‘How would you know about that? I’ve only talked to certain people.’And the voice in the phone said, ‘Well, we know pretty much everything.’ And hesaid, ‘Just don’t be putting that out there anymore! Certain people would preferthat you not talk about that.’And I said, ‘Well, I’ll consider that.’And then the phone went dead. There was a click. Whoever was on the other endhung up. It was like, ‘Wow, this is out of the blue!’”[358][part0000_split_079.html#_edn358] When he investigated the phone number of the caller, he discovered it was thegeneral number of the National Security Agency out of Fort Meade, Maryland.The missing Antarctic scientists had apparently discovered something important,but it scared them in some way. They were forbidden from sharing what they sawwith the plane’s crew, and whatever they brought back with them, including theirequipment, that was taken to the U.S. What did the scientists see that alarmedthem, and why was Brian warned off by the NSA from discussing them? And whatprecisely is the human-extraterrestrial connection in Antarctica?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 LAKE VOSTOK MYSTERY & ANCIENT RUINS IN ANTARCTICA "},{"pageContent":"LAKE VOSTOK MAGNETIC ANOMALY In 1957, the Soviet Union built a base in eastern Antarctica in a region theynamed “Vostok” (Russian for East). Arguably, the Russians chose their base sitevery carefully, since it later turned out to be at the tip of a remarkablesubterranean lake. The existence of the lake had been hypothesized as early as1959 by Russian geographer Andrey Kaptisa, but was not scientifically confirmeduntil 1993 using orbital laser altimetry.[359] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn359]The Russians named the vast body of water Lake Vostok, after their base.Here is how the Antarctic Sun, which is published out of McMurdo base for theUnited States Antarctic Program, described events leading up to Lake Vostok’sdiscovery: When the Russians opened Vostok Station near the geomagnetic pole in 1957, theyhad no idea that it was situated over an ancient body of water more than 1,640feet (500 m) deep and 243 miles (230 km) long. And when they started drillingthe world’s deepest ice core in an attempt to understand recent global warmingin relation to the climactic cycles of the last 500,000 years, they would nothave predicted that they would be stopped at 11,886 feet (3,623 m) by a group ofscientists concerned with contamination of the lake’s pure water…. Althoughearly seismic surveys in the 1960’s and 70’s indicated that water might existunder the ice cap, it wasn’t until drilling was well under way in the early1990s that satellite, seismic, and airborne radar data were put together to mapthe buried lake. “It was a ‘Eureka!’ moment,” said Martin Seigert, a Universityof Bristol glaciologist.[360] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn360] Lake Vostok measures 250 km (160 mi) by 50 km (30 mi) at its widest point, andby volume is one of the largest lakes in the world.Various scientific missions have been conducted to unravel some of the mysteriesbehind Lake Vostok. In 1998, the Russians drilled to a depth of just over 100meters above the lake and took ice core samples, which showed the existence ofextremophile microbes leading scientists to conclude that the lake containedlife. This in turn led to NASA considering Lake Vostok an ideal place to developsterile drilling and robotic probe technologies that could be used on futuremissions to Jupiter’s moon, Europa.The Antarctic Sun wrote about the ensuing plans to those already underway byNASA, which did not appear to present any insuperable technological challenge: The next phase could involve NASA tests of the robots. The cryobot would meltits way down to the lake where it would eject the hydrobot to explore the depthsand send back pictures and data to the surface via a cable. The final stagewould involve deep coring to retrieve sediment and water samples. The details ofprobing the lake without introducing contaminants are still being worked out. Itis a complex and ambitious effort that with the help of NASA technology willpotentially answer some fundamental questions about the evolution of life hereon Earth. And by giving scientists a testing ground for the cryobot and thehydrobot, something may someday be discovered about the evolution of life onother planets.[361] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn361] NASA’s plans were also covered by Britain’s Telegraph newspaper on September 21,1999: Lake Vostok is likely to be the oldest of all the \"sub-glacial\" ice lakesbecause of its size. If it has been isolated for 40 million years, there wouldhave been enough time for unique creatures to evolve, as opposed to creaturesthat have adapted to a new environment.The Antarctic studies may be a prelude to similar missions elsewhere in oursolar system, notably to Jupiter's moon Europa. NASA regards the Vostok missionas a test-bed for the search for alien life on the oceans thought to exist onEuropa.The Vostok exploration would take place in the next five years. The explorationof Europa would be in a series of missions beginning in 2003 and lasting for 15years.… The first entry of a probe into Lake Vostok will require extraordinaryprecautions to ensure that the vehicle and its instruments are clean, so as notto contaminate the pristine lake.One suggestion is to use a Cryobot, a 10ft 6in pencil-shaped device with aheated tip that unspools a cable carrying power and a fiber-optic video and datacable.The Cryobot splits into two under the ice and the top half stays at theice-water interface to hunt for life. The lower part (the point of the pencil)continues down a smaller cable until it hits the sediment at the bottom, whereit will also search for life and release a Hydrobot, a tiny submarine equippedwith sonar and a camera. The Hydrobot rises like a soap bubble, reporting whatit sees above and below it.[362] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn362] Grants were awarded to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory by the National ScienceFoundation to send a probe into Lake Vostok by 2002, using its new steriledrilling technologies in order not to contaminate the pristine environment.[363][part0000_split_079.html#_edn363] [../images/00047.jpeg]Figure 46. Artist’s cross-section of Lake Vostok drilling. National ScienceFoundation In the Antarctic summer of 2000/2001, the Support Office for AerogeophysicalResearch sent 36 flights over Lake Vostok and used ground-penetrating equipmentto map the Lake. Here is how Kristan Hutchinson Sabbatini, writing in theFebruary 4, 2001 edition of the Antarctic Sun, described the mapping process: Every second the equipment recorded the gravitational attraction, six radarreadings and 10 measures on the magnetometer. The altimeter gave the altitude ofthe ice to within 10 to 20 centimeters. Radar showed the terrain below the flatice changed from rolling plains on one side of the lake to mountains on theother. The lake itself appeared to be in a basin, below two miles (three to fourkm.) of ice.[364] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn364] Detailed maps were created for the first time showing the sub-glacial LakeVostok by a Columbia University team led by Dr Micheal Studinger.[365][part0000_split_079.html#_edn365] The 2001 mapping survey displayed somethingelse that attracted scientific attention and sparked great public interest – alarge magnetic anomaly. Sabbatini wrote: The evidence is a huge magnetic anomaly on the east coast of the lake’sshoreline. As the first SOAR flight crossed over to the lake’s east side, themagnetometer dial swung suddenly. The readings changed almost 1,000 nanoteslafrom the normal 60,000 nanoteslas around Vostok. A tesla is the standard measureof magnetism. Studinger typically finds anomalies of 500-to-600 nanotesla inplaces where volcanic material has poured out of the ground. \"When we first sawthis huge magneticanomaly, that was very exciting,\" Studinger said.Usually magnetic anomalies are much smaller and it takes some effort todistinguish the anomaly from normal daily changes in the magnetic field. In thiscase there was no confusion.\"This anomaly is so big that it can’t be caused by a daily change in themagnetic field,\" Studinger said.The anomaly was big in another way, encompassing the entire Southeast corner ofthe lake, about (65 by 46 miles) 105 km by 75 km. The size and extremity of themagnetic anomaly indicated the geological structure changes beneath the lake,and Studinger guessed it might be a region where the earth’s crust is thinner.[366] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn366] [../images/00048.jpeg]Figure 47. Magnetic Anomaly location at Lake Vostok After the February 2001 discovery of the giant magnetic anomaly, plans veryquickly changed for NASA, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and otherorganizations over sending robotic probes down into Lake Vostok. By the end of2001, the NSF was talking about a decade-long delay out of environmentalconcerns, as the November 18 edition of The Antarctic Sun reported: The NSF has scrapped a timeline sketched out at an NSF workshop in 1998, whichwould have had access holes drilled into the lake next year and samples removedin 2003.That schedule has been delayed as much as 10 years, said Julie Palais,glaciology program manager for the Office of Polar Programs.\"Anyone who thinks about this realistically will realize it's going to take along time to develop the technology,\" Palais said. \"To me it's one of the mostchallenging projects I've ever been involved in as far as the how-tos.\"[367][part0000_split_079.html#_edn367] Was it merely environmental concerns that led to the cancellation of plans tosend robotic probes into Lake Vostok, or was there another reason for the abruptchange in plans? "},{"pageContent":"WAS AN ANCIENT CITY DISCOVERED AT LAKE VOSTOK? Two veteran researchers of NASA programs, Richard Hoagland and Mike Bara, saidthere was far more to the magnetic anomaly than just a long term geologicalprocess related to the Earth’s crust being thinner in this section ofAntarctica, thereby leading to the magnetic anomaly. They wrote in a May 2001article about an alternative explanation to the one originally portrayed by Dr.Studinger: Others, like Enterprise consulting geologist Ron Nicks, have serious difficultywith this theory. Nicks explains that such a thinning would heat the underlyingrock and thus diminish (rather than increase – as observed) the crust's abilityto locally amplify the Earth's magnetic field.There is, as always, an equally viable alternative explanation. An anomaly likethis could also be caused by an accumulation of metals – the kind you would getif you found the ruins of an ancient, buried city!An \"ancient city under the ice?\" Such a discovery would be absolutely dazzling,sending shockwaves through our world as profound as the discovery of \"artifactson Mars\" or \"ruins on the Moon.\" And the notion is not as improbable as you maythink.[368] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn368] The discovery of an ancient city or some other large artificial object buriedunder two miles of ice would certainly have been earth shattering news. Such adiscovery would explain why NASA/JPL and the National Science Foundationsuddenly abandoned the idea of sending robotic probes into Lake Vostok withcameras, which would have publicly televised what lay hidden there.Hoagland and Bara further described how JPL’s stated reason for pulling back onits robotic probe plans suddenly became an internet controversy involving theNational Security Agency: Almost immediately after the discovery of the Columbia \"Vostok magneticanomaly,\" word began to leak out that JPL was inexplicably \"pulling back fromits Vostok exploration program.\" The reason given was the previously stated\"environmental concerns.\" This was all well and good, until unconfirmed reportsbegan to surface that a JPL spokesperson had admitted at a February pressconference that the National Security Agency (NSA) had literally taken over theJPL polar research program at Lake Vostok. It was this report which createdsomething of a firestorm on the Internet.[369] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn369] The NSA’s surprising involvement in the Lake Vostok anomaly gained the attentionof other researchers such as Henry Stevens, who wrote: The reason for the NSA’s involvement had nothing to do with biology andeverything to do with physics…. [T]he fact remains that the best and mostprobable answer as to the origin of this vast magnetic disturbance is thepresence of a massive amount of metal. Metal as in a buried city…. Is this metalthe remains of Atlantis? Is it the underground city said by some to have beenbuilt by the Germans, Neu-Berlin? Is this an extraterrestrial base? With the NSAinvolved, the only thing for certain is that we won’t be told the answer to thismystery anytime soon… [370] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn370] Hoagland and Bara described a series of unprecedented medical evacuations fromAntarctica in mid-2001, and the important fact that some of them were RaytheonCorporation employees, indicating that a “black project” had been initiated toexplore the Lake Vostok anomaly: [S]ome \"Special Project\" has, against all scientific and environmental prudence,indeed drilled through the ice into the Lake Vostok eco-system (clandestinely,of course). And, the participants have suddenly found themselves exposed to\"something\" for which their bodies literally have no immunity – something notextant in the rest of Earth's biosphere for between 13,000 and several millionyears! After the initial reports of \"four emergency extractions,\" the numberchanged to five ... and now twelve McMurdo personnel are supposedly in need of adangerous, \"emergency medical evacuation\" well into the Antarctic winter season.At one level, this has all the earmarks of \"something\" virulently spreadingamong the limited winter population at the Base, something that even the fairlycomplete medical facilities at McMurdo can no longer cope with. Complicating thepicture is the fact that the \"extractees\" are not research scientists orlong-term support personnel, but are all employees of Raytheon Corporation – ahigh-tech firm that is deeply involved in a variety of black-ops programs forthe U.S. government all around the world.[371] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn371] "},{"pageContent":"ALLEGED MISSING @TLANTIS TV CREW On April 13, 2002, a press release appeared on the Atlantis Mapping Projectwebsite claiming that a videographer crew from “@lantis TV” had gone missingafter filming a massive archeological discovery. The press release boldlyemphasized the “Spectacular Ruins” captured on video, and the efforts by @lantisTV to recover the confiscated video footage. [../images/00049.jpeg]Figure 48. News Release about alleged Antarctic Video However, an investigation of the “Antarctic Mapping Project” and @lantisTVrevealed that both were merely a marketing gimmick for a then upcoming book byThomas Greanias titled Raising Atlantis, which was first published in July 2005.Indeed at the bottom of the Press releases by the “Antarctic Mapping Project”,the following disclaimer appeared. [../images/00050.jpeg]Figure 49. Disclaimer Statement The disclaimer clearly states that all of their press releases were purelyfictional and for entertainment only, thus there was no film footage ofspectacular ancient ruins found in Antarctica or a missing television crew. Wasthe mysterious press release merely a clever marketing gimmick, or was theirsome truth to the mysterious excavations and missing crew? To this day, various major media outlets and blogsites mistakenly refer to the2002 press release, and subsequent Antarctic Mapping Project blogsite referencesto it, as genuine. For example, on December 12, 2016, Jennifer Hale fromBritain’s Sun newspaper wrote: Conspiracy theorists went wild earlier this year when a video claiming to befrom the lost city emerged. It appeared to show extensive ancient ruins hiddenin the ice, and was a video supposedly ‘left behind’ by a California TV crew whohave been missing since 2002.Archaeologist Jonathan Gray claimed that the US government is trying to blockthe video from being seen because it reveals there is a “massive archaeologicaldig under way two miles beneath the ice”.[372] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn372] Why has a fictitious press release about an alleged 2002 ancient Antarctic ruinsdiscovery proved so resilient over the years? An explanation worth considerationis that it is a “psychological operation” to hide the truth in plain sight.Typically, such intelligence psy-ops reveal the truth, but in such a way that iseasily discredited.Let’s revisit the earlier incident recounted by the Navy flight engineer Brian,who told about the missing Antarctic scientists, and was warned off by the NSAabout discussing them further with Linda Moulton Howe. Was the NSA and the U.S.intelligence community trying to misdirect the general public from genuinediscoveries made of ancient ruins by planting false stories in the public sphereabout missing videographers who allegedly filmed an ancient city?Curiously, on February 3, 2012, Russian scientists drilling deep into the LakeVostok region of Antarctica reportedly went missing according to a Fox TV newsstory: The world holds its breath, hoping for the best after six days of radio silencefrom Antarctica – where a team of Russian scientists is racing the clock and theoncoming winter to dig to an alien lake far beneath the ice.The team from Russia's Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) have beendrilling for weeks in an effort to reach isolated Lake Vostok, a vast, dark bodyof water hidden 13,000 ft. below the surface of the icy continent. Lake Vostokhasn't been exposed to air in more than 20 million years.The team’s last contact with colleagues in the unfrozen world was six long daysago, and scientists from around the globe are unsure of the fate of the mission– and the scientists themselves – as Antarctica’s killing winter drawsnear.[373] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn373] The missing scientists’ story was quickly dismissed as a mere misunderstanding,and it was announced five days later that the Russians had finally succeeded inreaching Lake Vostok on February 8, 2012.[374] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn374]Was an ancient lake the only thing discovered by the Russians? The falsifiedrumors of missing scientists may well have been part of yet anotherpsychological operation to create confusion about what was really discovered atLake Vostok and/or elsewhere under the Antarctic ice sheets. "},{"pageContent":"DISCOVERY AND EXCAVATIONS OF ANCIENT RUINS IN ANTARCTICA Corey Goode states that he first heard about an advanced civilization inAntarctica that had been flash frozen from a senior officer, who he dubbed“Sigmund”. This officer was part of a USAF/DIA/NSA/NRO secret space programinvestigation into Goode’s claims surrounding a highly advanced program, SolarWarden, run by the Navy. Sigmund led a covert mission that involved multipleabductions and debriefings of Goode who was being tested for the fidelity of hisinformation.[375] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn375] After Sigmund was satisfiedabout the accuracy of Goode’s information and sources, he unexpectedly sharedsome of his knowledge about the Antarctica excavations. Goode says moreinformation was forthcoming during a military abduction that took place onOctober 26, 2016, when Sigmund revealed information about his own activities,including time spent in Antarctica: Furthermore he told me that he had been stationed at several militaryinstallations in Antarctica and had spent time in the very area where the Ansharhad taken me on a reconnaissance flight.[376] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn376] Sigmund went on to describe recent discoveries in Antarctica, which explainedthe growing scientific, political and religious interest over the frozencontinent: He [Sigmund] stated that an extremely ancient series of cities had beendiscovered flash frozen deep under the ice-shelf. He confirmed that there werealso many animals and “Pre-Adamites” preserved in the ice…. They were allflattened/ crushed or knocked over by the event that flash froze the area. Theyhave tons of trees/ plants and wildlife frozen in place, like they were put onpause. [377] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn377] If true, this would not only confirm rumors about a major discovery at LakeVostok, but would also be startling confirmation of the research on the Earth’scrustal displacement conducted by Sir Charles Hapgood. His studies producedevidence of pole shifts in the past that have led to the Earth’s axis ofrotation shifting dramatically over a short period, where even sub-tropicalareas might suddenly find themselves at the poles. Hapgood’s 1958 book, Earth’sShifting Crust, featured a foreword by Albert Einstein endorsing the rigor ofHapgood’s research.[378] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn378] Einstein summarizedhis colleague’s theory as follows: Polar wandering is based on the idea that the outer shell of the earth shiftsabout from time to time, moving some continents toward and other continents awayfrom the poles. Continental drift is based on the idea that the continents moveindividually … A few writers have suggested that perhaps continental driftcauses polar wandering. This book advances the notion that polar wandering isprimary and causes the displacement of continents…. This book will presentevidence that the last shift of the earth’s crust (the lithosphere) took placein recent time, at the close of the last ice age, and that it was the cause ofthe improvement in climate.” [379] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn379] Hapgood’s thesis that the last pole shift happened at the end of the last iceage, approximately 11,000 BC, could now be remarkably verified by the discoveryof a flash frozen Antarctica civilization. Furthermore, this discovery wouldalso confirm that the Oronteus Fineus map, which shows an ice-free Antarctica,is based on ancient historical records which divulge Antarctica in fact oncepossessed a thriving civilization before a devastating Pole Shift event.[380][part0000_split_079.html#_edn380] [../images/00051.jpeg]Figure 50. Oronteus Fineus map shows Antarctica ice free Goode has offered some information about activities surrounding the Antarcticadiscovery: The first discoveries occurred sometime back, not sure. They had an idea of whatwas below the ice after doing very high-tech scans from space. They had beenexcavating one site and discovered many, many others spread out across what usedto be dry ground. This happened over time. They have been studying what they are finding, and moving some of it out beforebringing in various bigwigs from various secret societies. Then they do tourslike the “Cabal Disneyland” they have in the stasis chamber in Ohio. They arecontinuing to excavate, but know what is around in the areas where they havecleared away the ice.They are worried that all of the steam excavation could cause the surface of theice shelf to collapse down on the sites they have uncovered. I think they wouldhave to go public in some sort of a way to go bigger on this excavation andwiden it. [381] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn381] Goode has also provided an artistic sketch of the ancient archeologicaldiscovery (see figure 51), which shows the ruins being accessed through a vasthole into the ice, where snowmobiles and tractor-trailers are able to descenddown one side. This is significant since it corresponds to what Brian reportedseeing during his overflight of the South Pole hole in 1985/86, where vehicletracks were visible going from the nearby Scott-Amundson base into the hole viaa ramp down into the interior. southpoleexcavationfinal[../images/00052.jpeg]https://i0.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SouthPoleExcavationFinal-1.jpgFigure 51. Drawing of excavation with ramp descending into the site. Courtesyof www.Gaia.com A discovery of this magnitude is clearly Earth-shattering news for thearcheological community, and helps to explain why prominent world figures suchas U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Astronaut Buzz Aldrin and Sir PeterCosgrove, Australia’s Governor General, traveled to Antarctica in 2016 – to seethe discoveries first hand.[382] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn382] The visit byRussian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill is perhaps the most significant becauseit suggests that a discovery was made near a major Russian Antarctic station,Lake Vostok. Regarding this stream of recent VIP visitors to Antarctica, Goodeasserts: “The finds in Antarctica are a major reason the WorldPolitical/Religious leaders have been brought down there to tour what has beenfound in the last year.” [383] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn383]Goode also offers a description of the inhabitants of this ancient Antarcticcivilization, as relayed to him by the high-ranking officer, Sigmund: He described the “pre-Adamites” as beings with elongated skulls, with strangelyproportioned bodies that were obviously not designed for Earth’s gravity andatmosphere pressure. This group had apparently arrived here from another planetin our solar system that was no longer hospitable.They arrived here approximately 55,000 to 65,000 years ago and began to createhybrids of their species and the developing human population. [384][part0000_split_079.html#_edn384] Once again, if true, this information is ground-shaking across diverse fields ofscientific study since it confirms that the elongated skulls found in placeslike Paracas, Peru belong to another species of humans, rather than beingartificially created deformities.[385] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn385] paracas_skulls[../images/00053.jpeg]https://i1.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/paracas_skulls.jpegFigure 52. Skulls found near Paracas, Peru What is critical to understand, according to Goode, is that many of the globalelite view themselves as direct descendants of these pre-Adamite peoples, andconsequently, view the Antarctica discovery as an event that corroborates theiruniqueness, and fitness to rule.[386] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn386] Heclaims that the descendants of these Pre-Adamites occupy very senior positionsin the Vatican hierarchy, where their identities are hidden by the elongatedhats worn by Bishops and Cardinals. If Goode is correct, this would help explainthe extraordinary influence the Vatican has held over a large segment ofhumanity for nearly two millennia.It’s important here to bring in the Thule Society and their belief that Aryanswere descendants of the ancient Hyperboreans, who were giants with superiorintellectual and psychic skills. It becomes easy to understand why such beliefswere shared by elites from many nations, thereby facilitating the eventualagreements that led to secret cooperation with the breakaway colony establishedin Antarctica by the Thule and other German secret societies.In late 2016, Goode said that he has been told by a number of other sourcesindependent of Sigmund that recent discoveries have indeed occurred inAntarctica: I have now had well over a dozen confirmations that indeed a HUGE F-INGdiscovery was made down in Antarctica. Indeed there are many, many types ofruins and artifacts strewn out across the continent/ group of islands andunderground.… Many square miles of ruins have been detected w/only a small %that has actually been excavated. [387] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn387] At that time, all Goode knew about the Antarctic discovery and excavations wasthrough second-hand sources, but they were nevertheless consistent with otherclaims of a major discovery having occurred at Lake Vostok, and with theanomalies Brian claims he witnessed in Antarctica. Furthermore, the visit ofVIP’s to Antarctica in 2016 is powerful circumstantial evidence in support ofthe discovery of a buried civilization, part or much of which is located nearLake Vostok.In early 2016, however, something truly extraordinary happened to Goode. He sayshe was taken down to Antarctica by an Inner Earth group, who gave him directaccess to the buried Pre-Adamite civilization where he saw for himself thesecret excavations that were occurring there."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 COREY GOODE’S COVERT RECONNAISSANCE MISSIONS TO ANTARCTICA "},{"pageContent":"USE OF COVER PROGRAMS TO HIDE CLASSIFIED PROGRAMS Gathering reliable intelligence about current activities in Antarctica is verydifficult due to the “need to know” aspect of the covert projects occurring deepunder the ice shelves. Most public officials who travel to Antarctica are onlygiven a highly sanitized version of projects occurring at the stations found onthe surface. If visiting officials don’t have a need to know what is happeningdeep inside the interior, they are only given routine tours of the surfacefacilities. Then they are shown open source science projects, which areeffectively cover programs for the highly classified subterranean Antarcticprojects.In 2015, Edward Snowden leaked National Security Agency documents that showedhow all classified programs have cover programs, along with contrived coverstories to maintain secrecy. The most highly classified programs are covered byless classified programs. This was illustrated by one of the documents releasedby Snowden showing how highly classified programs will be obscured behind lessclassified counterparts. [../images/00054.jpeg]Figure 53. Leaked NSA document Classified activities in Antarctica will similarly have to be covered up by avariety of cover programs. Public officials without a need to know are given atour of the cover programs in Antarctica, which appear to be legitimate scienceprojects covering topics such as weather monitoring, penguin research,environmental changes, atmospheric physics, etc. In this way, secrecy can beeffectively maintained despite the presence of thousands of scientists andpersonnel in Antarctica witnessing anomalous events, while participating in anumber of open source or unclassified projects.Several public officials interviewed for this book said they did not seeanything pertaining to a lost civilization or ancient artifacts during theirvisits to Antarctica. Both Congressman Nicholas Lampson (H.R. Texas, 1997-2005,2007-2009) and Dr. Rita Coleman (head of the National Science Foundation)responded to a series of questions they were asked for this book, and said theydid not witness or hear about such topics during a 1992 U.S. Congressional visitto Antarctica.[388] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn388] They each claimed they hadonly witnessed science projects, which are well known in open source literaturesuch as the Antarctic Sun. Neither admitted to being briefed about classifiedprojects.Clearly, if there are highly classified U.S. projects happening deep under theice shelf, or a German space program operating in unknown bases there,eyewitness confirmation has proved elusive thus far. The closest we have come isthe testimony of a navy flight engineer, “Brian”, who revealed that there is alarge airplane-sized hole at the South Pole, which appears to be part of ahighly classified program. The suppression of eyewitness testimony is evidencedby the debriefing Brian and his colleagues experienced after they flew over thehole during a rescue mission. They were instructed not to divulge what they hadseen, and warned of dire consequences if they disclosed anything. To the presentday, Brian refuses to divulge the other members of his team out of concern forthe repercussions to them as well as himself.[389][part0000_split_079.html#_edn389]Congressman Lampson and Dr. Coleman visited Amundson-Scott South Pole stationduring their 1992 tour. When asked whether a large hole existed near the SouthPole, each one answered that he/she had no knowledge of it. Yet, Brian’sbackground and credentials lend authenticity to the accuracy of his report ofwhat he personally witnessed back in the 1990’s. Furthermore, Brian’sobservation of flying saucers over the Transantarctic Mountains on severaloccasions during flight missions suggests that a secret space program does existin Antarctica. Significantly, this is a program that is not part of theoversight mechanism in place for the U.S. Antarctic Program, run by the NationalScience Foundation. The flying saucers Brian witnessed are evidence that anadvanced aerospace program, possibly part of a German-led program, does operatein the Transantarctic mountain range. Finally, Brian’s recollection of anincident involving missing scientists in Marie Byrd Land indicates that covertprojects are occurring in Antarctica, and any scientists involved are debriefedwith clear directives to maintain secrecy.Based on Brian’s testimony, we only have a sketchy understanding so far ofcovert programs in Antarctica and the continuing German presence there. The sameis the case for a magnetic anomaly discovered near Lake Vostok, and CoreyGoode’s claims via information told to him by his USAF contact “Sigmund”, andother insider sources, about a flash frozen buried civilization discovered underthe ice mass.However, it is Goode’s recent remarkable eyewitness testimony that tells us themost about what is occurring in highly classified projects in Antarctica. Todate, he claims he has been taken to Antarctica on two separate occasions wherehe witnessed advanced bases and excavation activities related to an ancientalien civilization that possessed advanced spacecraft. It is essential,therefore, to review and analyze these claims beginning with his 2016 trip whereGoode contends he witnessed large industrialized bases connected to the GermanAntarctic space program (Dark Fleet), which extensively cooperates with atransnational corporate group; the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate (ICC). "},{"pageContent":"2016 TRIP TO SECRET ANTARCTIC BASES On May 14, 2016, Goode released an online “report” about Antarctica relatedevents in bullet point form, comprised of information he recently acquired fromhis insider sources.[390] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn390] This report includedmention of the Anshar, one of the seven Inner Earth civilizations that Goodesays he has met with since 2015. In earlier online reports, he disclosed beingtaken to the main underground city belonging to the Anshar, where he witnessedtheir advanced technologies. Goode also previously described multiple encounterswith Ka Aree, a High Priestess of the Anshar, who has acted as his guide andfriend on many trips into the Earth’s interior and deep space.A month later, Goode gave me an informal “briefing” about recent events inAntarctica, including details about his first trip to the icebound continentonboard a spacecraft belonging to the Anshar to witness industrial facilitiesunderground.[391] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn391] Goode’s Antarcticreconnaissance tour took place between April 27–30, 2016. The facilities hewitnessed were largely unknown to the Secret Space Program Alliance, formed inpart largely by the US Navy’s Solar Warden program, and therefore Goode acquiredhighly critical intelligence that he was asked to release as quickly aspossible; so Goode briefed me to get the information out immediately. The nextday, on June 16, 2017, I released a lengthy article entitled, “Secret SpacePrograms Battle over Antarctic Skies during Global Elite Exodus” onExopolitics.org to summarize the data Goode shared with me.The next month, in an interview on camera with Cosmic Disclosure, which wasreleased on July 12, 2016, Goode described his initial visit to Antarctica indetail.[392] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn392] He began by describing beingtaken on an Anshar spacecraft possessing advanced viewing technology, for areconnaissance mission that would give him relevant information for the SecretSpace Program Alliance, which was beginning to question his value as an asset tothem. Goode also mentioned that he was once again accompanied by Ka Aree: And she starts telling me, she said, “The technology of this craft is incrediblyintuitive.” She said, “Do not get lost in the data.”... But she said this justbefore we started heading right towards a giant wall of ice, like an ice shelf.And we were heading directly towards it at speed….And we passed right through what had to be some sort of hologram. And soon as wepunched through, we saw an area carved out to where the largest ship that wehave [an aircraft carrier] could go through and still have two or three timesthe height of the ship to the ceiling of this archway.But there was all of this, I guess, steam. It was real foggy.At the entrance, this like fog was coming out. And we headed directly into thisbasically ice tube. And we were flying all around, and there'd be areas … allyou'd see was ice, but then you would see, like, some little bit of rockoutcroppings. And this was several miles that we went that way until everythingstarted to then spread out and open up.[393] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn393] What Goode has described appears to illustrate thermally heated ice caverns thatare formed by steam coming from active volcanoes deep under the ice sheets. Thisis notable because later, Australian and New Zealand scientists confirmed inSeptember 2017 that there are indeed networks of ice caverns deep under the iceshelf that are formed by thermal heat from active volcanoes.[394][part0000_split_079.html#_edn394] The scientists pointed out that these could beheated to approximately 25 degrees Celsius (77 °F) and were very capable ofhosting life.Continuing, Goode explained how the Anshar craft overflew one of the hiddenwaterways deep under the Antarctic ice sheets. These waterways go through someof the large thermally heated ice caverns all the way out to the open sea: And then we were flying over water. We're flying under … over water, under theice. And then we came up upon this little island area that had a little outpost– looked like an industrial city, but not a city. It was small.And we're still going at a good clip. And all of a sudden, we're … there's landbelow us. And you can't see it real well because it's very dark. And then we getto an area and you start seeing light, a lot of light, up ahead.And the light was penetrating and refracting and reflecting out of this giantice dome above the ice….And there were these pools of water that had steam coming out of them. And itwas obviously very warm. I could … There were trees that looked about this big[Corey shows a distance of approximately 4 inches with his fingers.] that looked… that had pine needles on them. But it was so dark, I couldn't make them outreal well.And we curve around this mountain … and there were these mountain peaks thatcame up out of the ground and disappeared into the ice, the ceiling of the ice.It was bizarre. And this was obviously … this ice pocket, or little igloo underthe ice, was obviously created by the thermal activity. And this was in thenorthwest area of Antarctica. [395] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn395] This is an accurate description of how the peaks or upper portions of mountainsin Antarctic are covered over by the ice sheet, but surface levels may beexposed due to thermally created ice caverns at the base of the mountains.Scientists announced in August 2017 that the Northwest area of Antarctica isfilled by active volcanoes (see Figure 61), thereby corroborating what Goodeclaims he saw during his April 2016 trip.[396] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn396]Next, Goode described coming across the first major industrialized city hewitnessed during his Antarctic reconnaissance mission: We then came upon the first really big industrial city that I saw under there.And you could … It looked like it was … At one time, it was about this size,[Corey shows a distance of about 10 inches between his hands.] and then they hadbuilt it out [Corey spreads his hands as wide as he can.] over time….Another thing, we saw all of these large triangle craft just … I couldn't tellif they were hovering above the ground or parked on the ground because of thelighting conditions.And it was pretty well lit from all of the industrial lights reflecting off theice in the general area of where this complex was. [397][part0000_split_079.html#_edn397] Goode said he then saw large submarines that were able to access thisunderground city through hidden waterways from the coastline spanning wellunderneath the Antarctic ice sheets: And as we flew over, we see two conventional-looking submarines and a few ofthose very large black subs. And they had these cranes on kind of like a traintrack that were positioned and unloading part of the almost egg-shaped black subthat the top kind of like slid back like that and exposed the inside. And theywere unloading….[398] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn398] In Goode’s May 14, 2016 online report, he first mentioned what he had been toldby ‘Gonzales’ about these huge submarines used to transport people and cargo toAntarctica: Gonzales later confirmed that these people and supplies were in many cases beingtransported to Antarctica via “Black Submarines” that were “EM Driven” and the“size of container ships”. The water filled subterranean rift systems are soincredibly enormous that they have no trouble on their journey. Furthermore, thereports stated that the rift caverns had been modified into massive archedtunnels in ancient times.[399] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn399] William Tompkins also said that the cavern system under the Antarctic ice wasnavigable by submarines, and the Germans had built enormous submarines for thispurpose: They had access to these [Antarctic] caverns with their submarines. The Germansbuilt massive truck submarines, which were enormous submarines, to transport allthis stuff down to Antarctica. The submarines, still submerged, entered theseAntarctica caverns through the underwater tunnels. The submarines went backthrough the tunnels, and they entered a lake where there were all thesefacilities, the cities, the naval bases, towns, and thousands of people.[400][part0000_split_079.html#_edn400] After describing the giant cargo ship sized submarines at the Antarcticindustrial city, Goode offered more details about the craft carrying him and theInner Earth crew: And it was at this point that I started wondering how many of these outposts arethere? Is there anything under the ground? What … You know, I started thinkingall this stuff. And all of a sudden, all of these displays … I mean, likeholographic displays started popping up all around.And what I didn't mention is when we first entered this under ice area, theceiling and the floors turned transparent on this craft. [401][part0000_split_079.html#_edn401] On the holographic maps displayed on the wall panels of the Anshar vehicle,Goode was able to see the locations of the industrial areas in Antarctica asthey appeared: So all these displays started popping up, and I started looking at it and I waslike, “Wait, I need to see, you know, see what I'm supposed to.” …. And I reallywasn't understanding all I was seeing – everything that was popping up. I sawsort of the map of the area we were in, and I saw two large areas and then foursmaller outpost areas on the map. [402] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn402] A map has been provided by Goode with the six industrial areas he viewed circledto show their approximate size and location. [../images/00055.jpeg]Figure 54. Map of Antarctica with circles designating locations and relativesizes of industrial complexes. Courtesy of Sphere Being Alliance. Significantly, the locations are all near subterranean waterways and in a regionof Antarctica where large numbers of active volcanoes exist. Therefore, Goode’saccount of submarine accessibility along with thermal activity taking place atthe underground facilities is consistent with scientific data about thesespecific underground regions of Antarctica. The six Antarctica bases belonged toone of the secret space programs, according to Goode: the InterplanetaryCorporate Conglomerate.Goode went on to describe the next unusual site they came upon: We pass over that industrial city. It gets darker again. And then all of asudden, we're over like a bay area. And across the end of the bay area, we couldsee what looked … which was another city that showed up on the map that poppedup for me.And I thought we were heading right towards it, but we stopped over the water.And I look up, and I see this huge ... The ice was 200 - 300 feet above thesurface of the ground in most of the area, but in this bay area, it was 600 feetor 500 feet. It was much higher.And there was this large hole, you know, 70 - 90 meters wide, that went up andthen went off at an angle above us. It was a huge … and it's apparently whereall of the thermal heat is escaping … So we stopped underneath it. And I thinkwe're about to shoot up through it. But instead, “phst”, we go into the water,like flat, and like a belly flop almost, but just “phew” into the water. Andwe're underwater. And it's dark. It's pitch black. [403][part0000_split_079.html#_edn403] What’s of special interest here is that the hole Goode reported seeing issimilar to the one Navy engineer “Brian” claims he witnessed near the SouthPole. Goode stated the hole going up was 70-90 meters wide, which is comparableto Brian’s estimate that a C-130 cargo plane could easily fly into the hole hesaw. Since Brian was a flight engineer during his Navy service with theAntarctic Development Squadron Six, his estimate can be deemed accurate.This indicates that the South Pole hole was created by thermal energiesemanating from the interior, which formed a cavern in the ice that grew upward,over a distance of one to two miles all the way to the surface. It’s verypossible that there are many thermally created holes stretching vast distancesup through the layers of ice to the Antarctic surface.Goode then detailed how the Anshar vehicle traveled through a subterraneanriver, which was accessible to submarines traveling the expanse from thecoastline: And you know, we're, you know, traveling under the water. And then all of asudden, we enter into this cavern type area where obviously these subs arecoming and going from … I don't know how far, we head back a ways. And I see twoor three of those subs coming with a long line of tiny little bubbles behind itand a light out the front. And this was obviously a rift.And the rift started to curve around, and we traveled around curving, and thenwe saw this huge arch that was, I mean, I don't … It was so big. And it … whatit had done is, a rift was curving around this way, and this was an arch thatconnected two rift or tunnel areas. And it was ancient. [404][part0000_split_079.html#_edn404] Goode has provided an artistic illustration of the tunnel system and archthrough which submarines can travel into and from Antarctica. What’s importanthere is that Goode is referring to a tunnel system that extends all the way fromAntarctica to South America, where another tunnel system stretches all the wayup the continent, even into North America. [../images/00056.jpeg]Figure 55. Illustration of underwater tunnels described by Goode running intoSouth America. Courtesy of www.Gaia.com William Tompkins spoke of the existence of a similar tunnel system reachingacross the African continent, and connecting into Europe and beyond. DuringWWII, according to Tompkins, Nazi Germany began moving equipment and personnelthrough this tunnel system across Europe into Africa, and then all the way toAntarctica. He said that as much as half of the personnel and resources whichfound their way to Antarctica came through this ancient tunnel system linkingEurope, Africa and Antarctica. Tompkins also mentioned the tunnel system in aninterview and told how submarines could use these for access to the undergroundAntarctic bases.[405] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn405]It is known with certainty that Nazi Germany commissioned a thorough study ofnatural caverns systems in Germany and Occupied Europe for the construction ofunderground manufacturing centers. Therefore, it’s quite possible that duringthe development of these natural caverns in Europe, the Germans stumbled ontothe continent’s natural cavern system extending all the way down to Antarctica.Certainly, the Nazi’s Reptilian allies would have helped them find and use thiscavern system, in order to escape the collapse of the Third Reich. Goode’sobservation of another tunnel system extending through the Americas also makesTompkins’ claims more plausible.What Goode witnessed during his April 2016 Antarctic visit was time sensitiveinformation, since it offered new intelligence for the SSP Alliance to aid theirongoing efforts to counter or neutralize some of the activities led by the DarkFleet and Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate. Goode confirmed the SSPAlliance found the information very useful for their ongoing operations againstthe Cabal, some of which involved direct military confrontations. During thisperiod, Goode was also releasing information given to him by the SSP Alliance.Before discussing Goode’s second trip to Antarctica, it’s first worth examiningthe briefings he says he received about an aerial confrontation that took placeover Antarctica in early 2016. "},{"pageContent":"BATTLE OVER ANTARCTICA According to Goode, briefings he received about what was happening there aroundthe time of his April 2016 visit came from two different sources. One source,“Gonzales” (a pseudonym), was his primary liaison with the SSP Alliance.Gonzales, an alleged US Navy Lieutenant Commander, had also acted as Goode’sinitial contact with the SSP Alliance, which is comprised of the Navy’s SolarWarden Program and defectors from other secret space programs.Goode’s second briefing source was ‘Sigmund’, an alleged senior officer with aUS Air Force run secret space program, which is comprised of USAF Space Command,the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), National Security Agency (NSA) and theDefense Intelligence Agency (DIA). As mentioned earlier, Sigmund was involved inabducting and interrogating Goode during much of 2016 because the accuracy ofhis disclosures had startled leaders within the USAF run SSP and raised manyquestions. Goode refers to the USAF program as a “lower level SSP” since theadvanced aerospace technologies it uses are hand-me-downs from other moreadvanced space programs run by the Navy (Solar Warden) and the InterplanetaryCorporate Conglomerate.[406] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn406]Goode’s most important briefings during this time concerned an alleged air warover Antarctica that occurred in early 2016. Goode first wrote about eventsleading up to this confrontation in his May 14, 2016 online “report”, in whichhe described what ‘Gonzales’ and ‘Sigmund’ had told him of an exodus occurring,involving elite groups fleeing to South America and Antarctica. Reports came in for approximately 6 months that high level syndicate groups weremoving huge amounts of personal items and supplies to South American undergroundbases most noted in Brazil. More recent reports stated actual family members andhigh-ranking syndicate members were pouring into these underground bases likeants before a storm. [407] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn407] Goode elaborated on these events when he gave me the “briefing” in June, andexplained that syndicate groups (global elites/Cabal/Illuminati) feared hugesolar storms predicted to hit the Earth.[408] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn408]A so-called “solar kill-shot” had long been predicted by the remote viewer, EdDames, who stated in an interview on March 21, 2016 that it was now“imminent”.[409] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn409]Goode also clarified that syndicate groups could not easily leave the Earth forrefuge on off-planet locations due to a recent airspace lockdown both “on andaround” the Earth by “the lower level SSP’s”.[410][part0000_split_079.html#_edn410] The latter had deployed technologyestablishing an “Earth Defense Grid” coordinated from an “air (and space)traffic control” established on the Moon, called Lunar Operations Command(LOC).[411] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn411] Lunar Operations Command,currently controlled by the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate, wascoordinating with the lower level SSP’s. With the Earth Defense Grid able tostop spaceship exists and entries, the cabal/syndicate groups chose to fleeinstead to Antarctica/South America where underground locations provided somesafety. Goode stated that during this time, the lower level SSP’s were alsoinstructed not to clear SSP Alliance flights into Earth’s airspace, which was atemporary mandate.Coincidently, President Obama visited Bariloche, Argentina on March 24, 2016,which had become the notorious unofficial headquarters of the “Fourth Reich”once Adolf Hitler fled there after World War II.In February 1960, President Eisenhower traveled to Bariloche where he negotiatedthe “Joint Declaration of Bariloche” with the Argentinian President concerningPeace and Freedom in the Americas.[412] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn412]However, the real topic of negotiations most likely concerned the deals thatwere first reached in 1955, which would be altered to further place the U.S.military-industrial complex firmly under the control of the Fourth Reich. Here,it’s worth remembering the CIA document shown at the end of chapter 3, which isevidence that Hitler moved from Colombia back to Argentina in February 1955.Given the additional documentary research confirming that Hitler had settled inBariloche, it’s almost certain that during Eisenhower’s visit, he met with AdolfHitler who likely held an honorific position with the Fourth Reich.[413][part0000_split_079.html#_edn413] Furthermore, it’s very possible that Barilochehas easy access to the underground cavern system that extends to Antarctica,which submarines can use as Goode witnessed during his 2016 visit. If so, thenthe large lake near Bariloche may well offer a means for submarines to travelback and forth to Antarctica.The alliance between the Germans in Antarctica and the U.S. military-industrialcomplex not only led to the emergence of the Interplanetary CorporateConglomerate[http://exopolitics.org/secret-space-programs-more-complex-than-previously-revealed/](ICC), but also to placing in charge of the German bases in Antarctica.Therefore, it is highly likely that President Obama’s visit to Bariloche was tofinalize new deals with the ICC/Germans to facilitate their desire to move alarge number of people and cargo to safe locations in South America andAntarctica for their exodus.In his May 14, 2016 online report, Goode described a battle that had taken placeover Antarctica as a consequence of the personnel and resources covertlytransferred to the secret industrial facilities hidden there: One of the most interesting things that came out of this briefing [by Gonzalesnow safely located at a secret Kuiper Belt base] was that there had recentlybeen reports of 6 large cruisers (teardrop shaped) were in the process ofleaving the atmosphere after breaking the surface of the ocean near the coast ofAntarctica. Dozens of “Unknown Chevron Craft” swarmed these cruisers andattacked the leading two craft causing massive and shocking damage. The cruisersbroke off their attempts to leave orbit returning to below the surface of theocean where they came from.[414] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn414] Goode has provided an illustration of the battle that took place. He said thatthe teardrop-shaped cruisers belonged to syndicate groups aligned with the “DarkFleet” (a space program first established in Antarctica by Nazi Germany/GermanSecret Societies), which later allied itself with the U.S. military-industrialcomplex. Chevron battle final low res [../images/00057.jpeg]Figure 56. Battle over Antarctica. Courtesy of www.Gaia.com Goode added that the SSP Alliance was not sure who the chevron-shaped spacecraftbelonged to, but speculation linked them to the “Earth Alliance”, a consortiumof “White Hats” from various national militaries working closely with the BRICSnations (see Figure 1 for different SSP alliances).[415][part0000_split_079.html#_edn415]According to Goode[http://spherebeingalliance.com/blog/latest-intel-and-update.html], theAntarctic battle was not an isolated incident: There has been a major uptick in conflicts just outside and within ouratmosphere between craft of various groups that have involved the shoot down ofa number of craft … Gonzales reported dozens of underground/ocean conflicts thathave involved the use of exotic weapons as well as an uptick in the use ofweather modification weapons by both the various syndicates and elements of theEarth Alliance.[416] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn416] Events in Antarctica were being monitored closely by different nations and/orspace programs, and according to Goode, huge spherical craft over Antarcticaappeared to also be conducting surveillance operations: Reports came in for approximately 6 weeks detailing “huge spherical craft” ingeostationary orbit above the continent of Antarctica. These reports came from 5different sources and described the spheres as being huge, metallic, shiny withone row of portholes going around the sphere. One speculated that these craftwere of Russian origin. [417] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn417] Goode then explained that the craft were operating over large areas of theSouthern Hemisphere, including Australia.It’s possible that the craft are related to the “Cosmospheres”[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_firesky_01.htm]allegedlydeveloped by the Soviet Union, which are described at length in the Peter Beteraudio files.[418] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn418] Notably, Beter held theposition of General Counsel for the Export-Import Bank of the United States(1961-67), and had high-level sources who he claims confided what was happeningto him behind the scenes in space up to the early 1980’s. The Cosmospheres, ifSoviet, established their weapons dominance in near Earth orbit, where they hadmilitary skirmishes with craft belonging to the USAF Space Command and NRO.According to Goode, these operate about 400 miles above the Earth, andoccasionally send their most advanced craft to the Moon.

Courtesyof www.Gaia.com It is, therefore, very likely that the large spherical objects observing theAntarctic space battles were indeed Cosmospheres now under the control ofPresident Putin and the Russian Federation. It is feasible that they providedintelligence used by the chevron-shaped spacecraft that intercepted and turnedback the larger teardrop-shaped craft, leaving with their global elitepassengers. "},{"pageContent":"COREY GOODE’S SECOND TRIP TO ANTARCTICA In early January 2017, Goode said he was again taken by the Anshar to Antarcticaon another reconnaissance mission. This time he witnessed the first scientificexcavations of ruins from an ancient “flash frozen” civilization buried undertwo miles of ice. While the discovery dates back to the first Nazi Germanexpedition in 1939 according to Goode, it is only since 2002 that excavations byarcheologists and other scientists have been allowed.[419][part0000_split_079.html#_edn419] The archeologists have allegedly prepareddocumentary films and academic papers on the ruins, and their eventual releasewill astound the scientific community.Coincidently, this corresponds with the initial unconfirmed reports,investigated by Richard Hoagland and Mike Bara, that an ancient city wasdiscovered near Lake Vostok around 2002. Goode’s January date also coincideswith the contrived news release concerning an @tlantis TV crew that went missingafter filming an underground ancient city. Goode’s extraordinary informationcasts light on these puzzling 2002 developments, which carry the hallmark of aneffort by the intelligence community to hide the truth in plain sight. Thismeans that the core story is real, but many of the details surrounding thediscovery and secret filming, in this case, are contrived to throw seriousinvestigators like Hoagland and Bara off the trail.Goode was told that three oval-shaped craft were discovered at the site,revealing that the Pre-Adamites were extraterrestrial in origin, and had arrivedon Earth about 55,000 years ago: “there were three [buried spacecraft] that wereextremely large. They were motherships.”[420] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn420]He further clarified “that there was one miles-long craft that was up to threemiles and oval-shaped, and then there were two smaller, I guess, support-typecraft.”[421] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn421]The largest of the three spacecraft had been excavated and found to have manysmaller craft inside. These smaller craft were test flown, according to Goode,inside the larger mothership by government operatives. Most surprising, themothership was found to also contain Pre-Adamites: And in the largest craft, there have indeed been located a bunch of beings instasis, and they are the original beings from, I guess, Mars, that had come here– the original Pre-Adamites. [422] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn422] The Pre-Adamite civilization, at least that portion of it based in Antarctica,had been flash frozen in a cataclysmic event that had occurred roughly 12,000years ago.Corroboration for Goode’s claim of three extraterrestrial craft having beendiscovered under the Antarctic ice comes from Dr. Pete Peterson who claims heworked on multiple classified government projects. Peterson first became knownto the public when he appeared in three interviews on Project Camelot in 2009where he discussed his involvement in various classified projects.[423][part0000_split_079.html#_edn423] In his most recent set of interviews on GaiaTV’s Cosmic Disclosure, Peterson discussed his first-hand knowledge of threeextraterrestrial ships that were buried deep under the Antarctic ice sheets. Hestated: [T]here are three layers of these things … Three crashes. And strangely one'sdown about a mile, and one is about two miles, and one's about three miles….There were things that were similar, which told me that there was probablycommercial traffic/communication between those societies…. And wholly differentcontrols. Those people had three fingers, so you had a place that your handwould fit into an indentation in a control surface. And it was … You had twothumbs, opposing thumbs, one on either side, and a main finger.[424][part0000_split_079.html#_edn424] While Peterson described crashed spacecraft found in three different layersseparated by a mile of ice, Goode had been told the three craft were in closeproximity to one another. Nevertheless, it is significant that both Goode andPeterson were told about the discovery of three large extraterrestrialmotherships buried under Antarctica, which were used to develop one or morecivilizations.Goode has also been told by his contacts that the most advanced technologies,and the remains of Pre-Adamites themselves, have been removed from onearcheological site that will be made public. Teams of archeologists have beenworking with what remains, and have been told to maintain secrecy over otherthings they have witnessed.[425] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn425] In addition,select ancient artifacts from other locations will reportedly be brought in fromvast top secret warehouses and seeded into the archeological site slated forpublic release. In the impending announcement about the Antarctica excavations,emphasis will be placed on the terrestrial elements of the flash frozencivilization in order not to overly shock the general population.Up until early January 2017, everything Goode knew about the Antarcticaexcavations had come second-hand from his insider sources. That changed whenGoode was taken to Antarctica to witness first-hand the ruins and theexcavations underway. I met with Goode on January 24, 2017 in Boulder, Colorado,where he gave me a personal “briefing” about his second Antarctic trip.[426][part0000_split_079.html#_edn426] The next day, I released an articlesummarizing important details of his mission entitled, “Visit to AntarcticaConfirms Discovery of Flash Frozen Alien Civilization” on Exopolitics.org. KaAree led the reconnaissance mission aboard the Anshar spacecraft, which Goodelearned was being conducted for his benefit. Another key figure on the missionwas “Gonzales”. Goode had exposed Gonzales during his involuntary abductions andinterrogations by “Sigmund” in 2016, and Gonzales subsequently became a liaisonbetween a Mayan Secret Space Program and the SSP Alliance, an assignment whichno longer required his presence on Earth (see Figure 1 for Mayan and otherSSP’s).Two other Inner Earth civilization representatives also were present for thereconnaissance mission. Goode and the others were taken by the Anshar spacecraftto an unexcavated portion of the ruins. This was an area that the nearbyscientific teams had not yet reached, so it was still pristine and showed thefull extent of a civilization that had been devastatingly flash frozen. Goodedescribed seeing bodies twisted and contorted in various frozen statesindicating the catastrophe had clearly been unanticipated. The scene was similarto ancient Pompei which was buried under tons of volcanic ash and lava, but herethe Pre-Adamite civilization was buried under tons of snow and ice. https://i1.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pompei-bodies.jpg?resize=650%2C434[../images/00059.jpeg]https://i1.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pompei-bodies.jpgFigure 58. Bodies found during excavation of Ancient Pompeii Goode noted that the Pre-Adamites were very thin. Examination of their bodiesmade it evident that they had evolved on a planet with a much lowergravitational environment. In addition to the Pre-Adamites, Goode also saw manydifferent types of normal-sized humans, some of whom had short tails, whileothers displayed elongated skulls similar to the Pre-Adamites. The conclusionGoode drew was that the Pre-Adamites had conducted biological experiments on theindigenous humans of the planet. https://i2.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pre_adamite_copy.jpeg?resize=650%2C866[../images/00060.jpeg]https://i2.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pre_adamite_copy.jpegFigure 59. Artistic depiction of Pre-Adamite next to a normal sized human withcone shaped head. Courtesy of www.Gaia.com Gonzales had an instrument for taking biological samples which he jabbed intovarious frozen bodies. He also carried a camera and took many photos. Thebiological material and photos would be given to SSP Alliance scientists forstudy. Additionally, there were scrolls made of a metallic alloy, which wererolled up and displayed some kind of writing on them. The Anshar and the otherInner Earth representatives collected as many of these scrolls as was possible.In earlier reports Goode released publicly, he described the Anshar Library asbeing remarkably extensive and possessing many ancient artifacts from multiplecivilizations.[427] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn427] The Anshar were apparentlyadding the historical records of this flash frozen civilization to theirlibrary. During the team’s time at the pristine site, Goode noted that his partywas not seen by the scientists and archeologists working on excavations inanother part of the vast ruins. The Anshar ship had traveled directly throughthe ice to get to the ruins, and Goode recalled how the ship could easily movethrough walls using advanced technologies.The importance of Goode’s January 2017 trip to Antarctica is that it confirmshis earlier intelligence from various sources, including the accuracy of it bythe USAF officer, Sigmund.[428] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn428] The Antarcticaexcavations proved to be quite real and Goode was now an eyewitness to it.Goode’s visit and his verification of the Antarctica discovery is highlyvaluable. It is also brings a disturbing confirmation of Charles Hapgood’stheory that pole shifts have been a regular occurrence in Earth’s history.[429][part0000_split_079.html#_edn429] The flash frozen Pre-Adamite civilization isnot the only case of this type of catastrophe impacting an ancient civilization.Could it happen again today? "},{"pageContent":"WILL A POLE SHIFT HAPPEN IF ANTARCTICA’S VOLCANOES BECOME ACTIVE? Scientists studying Antarctica’s newly discovered volcanoes have observed aworrying global pattern that may repeat itself in Antarctica. The most volcanism that is going in the world at present is in regions that haveonly recently lost their glacier covering – after the end of the last ice age.These places include Iceland and Alaska.Theory suggests that this is occurring because, without ice sheets on top ofthem, there is a release of pressure on the regions’ volcanoes and they becomemore active.And this could happen in west Antarctica, where significant warming in theregion caused by climate change has begun to affect its ice sheets. If they arereduced significantly, this could release pressure on the volcanoes that liebelow and lead to eruptions that could further destabilize the ice sheets andenhance sea level rises that are already affecting our oceans.[430][part0000_split_079.html#_edn430] Scientific data indicates that this heating process has been underway inAntarctica for decades. A fifty year study from 1956 to 2006 showed that thewest Antarctic region is heating up faster than east Antarctica. A map showingthe temperature difference per decade was released in 2009 by NASA (see Figure61).[431] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn431] It vividly shows how an unknowngeological process is heating up west Antarctica more rapidly than eastAntarctica.As to what geological process is responsible for the heating up of westAntarctica, we can find an answer in recent scientific studies. Maps oftemperature increase in west Antarctica correspond closely to the regionoccupied by the newly discovered volcanoes. A comparison of the scientific datadisplayed in the two maps respectively show temperature increase and newlydiscovered volcanoes, which points to a momentous conclusion – west Antarctica’sice sheets are being melted due to steadily increasing volcanic activity underthe ice. [../images/00061.jpeg]Figure 60. Top image shows temperature increase of Antarctica from 1956-2006(Credit: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio);bottom image shows 2017 discovery of 90 new volcanoes in Antarctica. The melting of the West Antarctica ice sheets supports Goode’s claims thatfrozen artifacts buried there for millennia are now being exposed by thisprocess, and governments are scrambling to secretly send excavation teams tostudy these newly exposed finds. Indeed, if the melting continues, then it isvery possible that Antarctica’s volcanoes will be the colossal engine forcing adisclosure of ancient civilizations, advanced technologies and/orextraterrestrial life.This possibility was first mentioned by whistleblower Emery Smith, who workedfor the U.S. Air Force as a medical technician before being recruited intocovert operations. In a January 2018 interview on Cosmic Disclosure, Smithdescribed what he had learned about Antarctica’s artifacts being exposed bymelting ice: You know, it won't be the people. It won't be us exposing this. It's going to beEarth that exposes it because of the warmth. They can't fight the heat rightnow. And since they can't fight the heat, it's going to be really hard toexplain when some of the snow melts in the next year, and this giant thingstarts being exposed and different metals…. So Gaia will be Disclosure. Earthwill be the one who discloses it, which is beautiful.[432][part0000_split_079.html#_edn432] While the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets can force the disclosure of manyfrozen secrets long buried across the inhospitable continent, there are alsomajor global problems the melting will create. The most well studied is therapid rise in sea levels as the ice sheets melt, which can result in thedisappearance of many coastal regions around the planet.[433][part0000_split_079.html#_edn433] There is, however, an even more disturbinggeological event that may lie ahead. As the west Antarctic ice sheets melt, theweight distribution around the geographic South Pole will dramatically alter.This may even trigger the cataclysmic geological event that Hapgood warned theworld about – a Pole Shift!How a Pole Shift could occur was summarized by Albert Einstein in his forewordto Hapgood’s 1958 book, The Earth’s Shifting Crust. Einstein described how theweight distribution of ice in the polar regions directly impacted thecentrifugal momentum of the Earth responsible for the axis of rotation. Heexplained how changes in weight caused by a build-up of ice, which would alsoinclude the converse phenomenon of a melt-off, could result in a Pole Shift: In a polar region there is continual deposition of ice, which is notsymmetrically distributed about the pole. The earth's rotation acts on theseunsymmetrically deposited masses, and produces centrifugal momentum that istransmitted to the rigid crust of the earth. The constantly increasingcentrifugal momentum produced in this way will, when it has reached a certainpoint, produce a movement of the earth's crust over the rest of the earth'sbody, and this will displace the polar regions toward the equator.[434][part0000_split_079.html#_edn434] Put simply, as west Antarctica melts, the new weight distribution at the SouthPole could change the Earth’s axis of rotation. "},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSION Goode’s two visits to Antarctic in 2016 and 2017, along with Peterson’sassignments there, provide the only eyewitness accounts of the extensive covertprojects occurring deep under the Antarctic ice sheets. Their testimonies arecorroborated by scientific discoveries in 2017 concerning an extensive networkof thermally heated ice caverns created by Antarctica’s submerged or under icevolcanoes.[435] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn435]Goode’s witnessing of the large industrial bases owned by the InterplanetaryCorporate Conglomerate and the Dark Fleet helps corroborate evidence presentedin this book; German secret society members and Nazis did indeed escape toAntarctica and built large bases in caverns hidden under a mile or more of ice.Goode’s revelations also support the existence of a vast network of subterraneanrivers under Antarctica’s ice sheets which are fully navigable by submarines,and link up with a subterranean tunnel network extending deep into SouthAmerica, and as claimed by Bill Tompkins, possibly into Africa/Europe. Finally,Goode’s testimony concerning the discovery of the Pre-Adamites in suspensionchambers found in spacecraft buried deep under Antarctica’s glacial surfaceraises many intriguing questions about the relationship between the global elite(cabal) and the Pre-Adamites, with a possible connection between thePre-Adamites and the Fallen Angels described in the apocryphal “Book of Enoch”."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 ANTARCTICA’S SECRET HISTORY AS AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL REFUGEE COLONY "},{"pageContent":"GALACTIC HISTORY: THE MARS - ANTARCTICA CONNECTION Soon after his second Antarctic visit, Corey Goode revealed more startlinginformation about Antarctica’s ancient past as an extraterrestrial refugeecolony, established roughly 60,000 years ago. In a Cosmic Disclosure TV episodeaired on February 21, 2017, Goode described what he witnessed first-hand duringthat second excursion. He also relayed details about the extraterrestrial’shistory, which he had read about during his alleged service in a “20 and back”program with Solar Warden.[436] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn436] He said thatthe “Pre-Adamites” were originally from Mars and a Super Earth (several timesEarth’s diameter), whose remains now form the asteroid belt. During the Pre-Adamite’s long history, when Mars was still a moon of the SuperEarth, Goode explained, the inhabitants of both Mars and the Super Earth foughta series of hi-tech wars. Approximately 500,000 years ago, these wars came to aclimactic end with the Super Earth’s obliteration. At the time, Mars hadabundant water and an oxygen-rich atmosphere to host a large population on itssurface. Intriguingly, back in July 2013, scientists confirmed the existence ofabundant water and oxygen on Mars in its distant past.[437][part0000_split_079.html#_edn437]According to the records Goode accessed, the events that led to the SuperEarth’s destruction also wiped out much of the surface population on Mars, andremoved the bulk of its atmosphere: It was postulated that Mars was most likely a moon of that Super Earth, and thatit was damaged heavily on one side by massive impacts. And that most likely alsostripped away its main atmosphere at the time, and it never recovered.[438][part0000_split_079.html#_edn438] The force of the Super Earth’s destruction propelled Mars into its presentplanetary orbit. So, was there really a Super Earth destroyed in a titanicbattle, which resulted in one of its moons being thrust into its present orbit,as the planet Mars?The first major scientist to seriously research the possibility that theasteroid belt is from the remains of a former planet was Dr. Thomas VanFlandern, the chief astronomer at the U.S. Naval Observatory. He wrote severalacademic papers on what he described as the “Exploded Planet Hypothesis”, whichexamined how our solar system’s main asteroid belt arose from the destruction ofa large planet that Mars once orbited: Putting all this evidence together, we have strong hints for two originalplanets near what is now the main asteroid belt: hypothetical “Planet V” and“Planet K”. These were probably gas giant planets with moons of significantsize, such as Mars, before they exploded … The above summarizes evidence thatMars was not an original planet, but rather a moon of a now-exploded planetoccupying that approximate orbit. Many of these points are the expectedconsequences of having a massive planet blow up nearby, thereby blasting thefacing hemisphere and leaving the shielded hemisphere relatively unscathed.Especially significant in this regard is the fact that half of Mars is saturatedwith craters, and half is only sparsely cratered.[439][part0000_split_079.html#_edn439] Van Flandern’s “Exploded Planet Hypothesis” lends scientific support to Goode’sclaims about Mars being a former moon of a giant planet (Super Earth) that wasdestroyed long ago.An enormous amount of debris from the Super Earth, as pointed out by VanFlandern, hit Mars with incredible force. This meant that the latter’s surfacecities on one side of the planet were totally destroyed, and most of itsatmosphere was lost. This made life on Mars’ surface very precarious at best,and according to Goode, led to planetary evacuation by the Martian survivors.What lends further plausibility to this scenario is a declassified CentralIntelligence Agency (CIA) document, which was released on August 8, 2000.[440][part0000_split_079.html#_edn440]The declassified document reveals that in 1984, the CIA employed a psychic“remote viewer” to look at a region of Mars as it was approximately one millionyears ago. The remote viewer, who was not aware that the coordinates given tohim were on the planet Mars, described seeing pyramids, futuristic technologiesand a very tall human-looking species facing impending environmental calamity.What makes the CIA document remarkable is that the coordinates provided to theremote viewer were of the Cydonia region. This specific area had beenphotographed by the Viking Orbiter in 1976, heralding the first detailed imagesof Mars. Cydonia became famous after a succession of researchers claimed thatthe images of this region displayed a face, ruins of a city, and pyramids. [../images/00062.jpeg]Figure 61. Viking image of Cydonia with Google Maps coordinates for Mars The first reference to artificial structures found in Cydonia dates to anOctober 25, 1977 National Enquirer article titled, “Did NASA Photograph Ruins ofan Ancient City on Mars?” [441] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn441] It’s worthpointing out that the National Enquirer was a tabloid run by Gene Pope, a CIAasset who was trained in “psychological warfare”.[442][part0000_split_079.html#_edn442] Overseen by Pope, the National Enquirer’schief purpose was to hide the truth in plain sight by releasing it insensationalized news stories with questionable sources that would be widelyridiculed by the general public. Subsequently, any academics or scientistsprepared to investigate such sensational claims faced derision from their peersand ruining their professional careers.Nevertheless, competent researchers did turn their attention to the nowcontroversial Viking Orbiter images and found that they indeed did appear toshow an artificially created “Face on Mars”, nearby ruins dubbed “Inca City”,and even pyramids. The first objective analysis of the Viking data was publishedin 1982 in Omni Magazine by researchers Vincent DiPietro, an electricalengineer, and Gregory Molenaar, a computer engineer. Their 1982 Omni article wasan extract from their 77-page book, Unusual Martian Surface Features, alsoreleased that year. They were soon followed by other independent researchersincluding Richard Hoagland, who in 1987 authored, The Monuments of Mars: A Cityon the Edge of Forever.[443] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn443]What this short review of the history of the Viking images of Cydonia tells usis that while researchers such as DiPietro, Molenaar and Hoagland were widelyridiculed by their scientific peers for their analyses and conclusions, the CIAwas paying very close attention. Declassified CIA documents confirm that remoteviewing was taken very seriously by the Agency and other intelligence services.Significant funding went into studying the usefulness of remote viewing as an“intelligence gathering tool”.The conclusion was that remote viewing had sufficient accuracy to be utilizedfor fieldwork as the following declassified CIA document, dated May 9, 1984,clearly affirms: 1. Remote Viewing (RV) is real, it is accurate, is replicable, is being pursued by at least the CIA, Navy, Army and Pentagon in general. That it is being pursued for intelligence and military applications. 2. The government’s interest in RV is clearly “applications” oriented. 3. Stanford Research Institute International (SRI-I) is the key institute involved with the government in RV research and Development. The specific individual is Dr. Hal Puthoff (see Figure 63). https://i1.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1-RV-is-real.jpg?resize=650%2C721[../images/00063.jpeg]https://i1.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1-RV-is-real.jpgFigure 62. Declassified CIA Document supporting Remote Viewing Among the most accurate of remote viewers described in the CIA documents was thefamed psychic, Ingo Swann. In his 1998 book, Penetration, Swann described howthe CIA utilized his remote viewing skills at length.[444][part0000_split_079.html#_edn444] One assignment in 1975 was to spy on secretbases on the Moon. In chapter five of his book, Swann opens by describing hisremote viewing of the Moon for a CIA officer Axelrod/Axel: Back at work, Axel gave me Moon coordinates, each set representing specificlocations on the Moon’s surface. At some of the locations there seemed to benothing to see except Moonscapes. But at other locations? – well there wereconfusions, and I perceived a lot that I could not understand at all. I made alot of sketches, identifying them as this or that, or looking like somethingelse. Without comments, Axelrod quickly took possession of each sketch, and Iwas never to see them again.I found towers, machinery, lights of different colors, strange-looking“buildings.” I found bridges whose function I couldn’t figure out. One of themjust arched out – and never landed anywhere. There were a lot of domes ofvarious sizes, round things, things like small saucers with windows. These werestored next to crater sides, sometimes in caves, sometimes in what looked likeairfield hangers. I had problems estimating sizes. But some of the things werevery large.[445] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn445] Given the off-planet locations assigned to top remote viewers like Swann, it isnot surprising that the CIA was later interested in what a remote viewer couldreveal about the origins of the pyramids and other artificial Mars structures inthe Cydonia region.The protocol used for the session is described on page 2 of the 1984 CIAdocument: The sealed envelope was given to the subject immediately prior to the interview.The envelope was not opened until after the interview. In the envelope was a 3 x5 card with the following information:The planet Mars.Time of interest approximately I million years B.C. Selected geographic coordinates, provided by the parties requesting theinformation, were verbally given to the subject during the interview. [446][part0000_split_079.html#_edn446] The rest of the CIA document (pp. 3-9) is a transcript of the remote viewerresponding to questions about different locations and time periods given to him(In 1984, all known remote reviewers were men). The remote viewer is referred toas “SUB”, while the questioner is “MON”. This is what the remote viewer reportedafter being given his first question: MON: (Plus 10 minutes, ready to start.)* All right now, using the information inthe envelope I’ve provided, exclusively focusing your attention now, using theinformation in the envelope, focus on:40.89 degrees north9.55 degrees westSUB: … I want to say it looks like ah … I don’t know, it sort of looks … I kindof got an oblique view of a ah … pyramid or pyramid form. It’s very high, it’skind of sitting in a … large depressed area. [447][part0000_split_079.html#_edn447] The coordinates were for the Cydonia region, and immediately the remote viewerdescribed some kind of pyramid sitting in a valley. This is remarkablecorroboration for multiple researchers who have identified pyramids in theViking images of this exact region of Mars. https://i1.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Viking-Overlay-on-Google-Earth-1024x444.jpg?resize=750%2C325[../images/00064.jpeg]Figure 63. Close up of Cydonia region, Mars Next, the remote viewer responded to a series of questions concerning thepopulation living in the region shortly before planet-wide geologicaldisturbances occurred, up to a million years ago. He began describing thepopulation’s attempt to create a refuge from the disturbances, which includedvery violent storm activity, by using some kind of stasis or cryogenictechnology: MON: All right. Go inside one of these and find some activity to tell me about …SUB: Different chambers … but they’re almost stripped of any kind of …furnishings or anything, it’s like ah … strictly functional place for sleepingor that’s not a good word, hibernations, some form, I can’t, I get real rawinputs, storms, savage storm, and sleeping through storms.[448][part0000_split_079.html#_edn448] What the remote viewer has identified are the pyramid structures on Mars whichwere used as a refuge where the population planned to sleep through theplanetary disturbance in a stasis chamber(s) of some kind.The remote viewer next described the population as very tall and thin, and gavedetails about their style of dress: MON: Tell me about the ones who sleep through the storms.SUB: … very … tall again, very large … people, but they’re thin, they look thinbecause of their height and they dress like in, oh hell, it’s like a real lightsilk, but it’s not flowing type of clothing, it’s like cut to fit.[449][part0000_split_079.html#_edn449] The height and physiology of the Martians suggests that the comparatively lowgravity on Mars facilitated gigantism among the human population. The remoteviewer next related that the Martian civilization was dying and the populationknew this fact: MON: Move close to one of them and ask them to tell you about themselves.SUB: They’re ancient people. They’re ah … they’re dying, it’s past their time orage.MON: Tell me about this.SUB: They’re very philosophic about it. They’re looking for ah … a way tosurvive and they just can’t.[450] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn450] The Martians were waiting to travel somewhere else, yet unknown, to survive.However, a faction was able to escape, presumably off-planet, as the followingquote suggests: MON: What is it they’re waiting for?SUB: They’re … evidently was a … group or a party of them that went to find …new place to live. It’s like I’m getting all kinds of overwhelming input of the… corruption of their environment. It’s failing very rapidly and this group wentsomewhere, like a long way to find another place to live.[451][part0000_split_079.html#_edn451] Next, the remote viewer described what clearly seems to be a spacecraft takingsurvivors to another planet: MON: Okay, when the others left, these people are waiting, when the othersleft, how did they go?SUB: … Get an impression of … Don’t know what the hell it is. It looks like theinside of a larger boat. Very rounded walls and shiny metal.MON: Go along with them on their journey and find out where it is they go.SUB: … Impression of a really crazy place with volcanoes and gas pockets andstrange plants, very volatile place, it’s very much like going from the fryingpan into the fire. Difference is there seems to be a lot of vegetation where theother placed did not have it. And different kind of storm. [452][part0000_split_079.html#_edn452] The above description is very suggestive of what Earth may have looked like backat that time. So did escaping Martians travel to Earth up to a million years agoleaving behind pyramids and other remnants of their civilization in the Cydoniaregion, which in modern times have been observed by the Viking Orbiter in 1976and the CIA’s remote viewer in 1984?In 2004, Joseph McMoneagle, a retired US Army Chief Warrant Officer gave alecture describing his participation in remote viewing experiments conducted byUS Army Intelligence and the Stanford Research Institute.[453][part0000_split_079.html#_edn453] He described the above Mars incident and evenprovided additional details confirming that he was the remote viewer cited inthe 1984 CIA document. In his lecture, McMoneagle said that the Martians hadindeed fled to Earth, and estimated them to be twice the height of a normalhuman, about 10-12 feet.In addition, Holmes “Skip” Atwater, who was McMoneagle’s training officer at thetime, has also discussed the 1984 remote viewing of Mars.[454][part0000_split_079.html#_edn454] In a video presentation, Atwater clarifiedthat the Mars coordinates and instructions were supplied by Hal Puthoff, head ofthe Stanford Research Institute’s remote viewing program, and that the remoteviewing session was done under contract to one of the intelligenceagencies.[455] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn455] With regard to the time perioddesignated in the session, Atwater said that even though the instructionsspecified remote viewing a million years into the past, McMoneagle was asked tomove through the timeline during the session, which meant that the actualcatastrophe and exodus on Mars may have occurred tens or hundreds of thousandsof years ago, rather than a million. It’s important to remember that the fleeingMartians almost certainly carried the stasis chamber technology that theirbrethren had used on the planet’s surface in an attempt to survive thecatastrophe.Another highly significant detail in the CIA document is McMoneagle’s referenceto a very volcanic environment, where the Martians escaped to using theirmetallic “boats”, or “space arks”. As already pointed out, scientists haverecently discovered that Antarctica has the highest concentration of volcanoesanywhere on Earth.[456] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn456] Volcanic activitytoday is suppressed by the weight of the kilometers-thick ice sheets, but thiswas not always the geological situation due to the Earth’s shifting poles, asexplained by Charles Hapgood in Path of the Pole.[457][part0000_split_079.html#_edn457] In the book’s Foreword, Albert Einsteinexpressed his early impression of Hapgood’s theory: I frequently receive communications from people who wish to consult meconcerning their unpublished ideas. It goes without saying that these ides arevery seldom possessed of scientific validity. The very first communication,however, that I received from Mr. Hapgood electrified me. His idea is original,of great simplicity, and – if it continues to prove itself – of great importanceto everything that is related to the history of the earth’s surface.[458][part0000_split_079.html#_edn458] Einstein went on in the Foreword to explain Hapgood’s theory in relation to howthe massive ice shelves in the polar region play a critical role in the shiftingof the Earth’s crust.[459] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn459] Hapgood’s theorymakes it clear that prior to Antarctica being located at the South Pole, it waspositioned in a more temperate climatic region, whereby its volcanoes were notsuppressed because of vast ice sheets covering them. Consequently, Antarctica’svolcanoes were very active during various periods across Earth’s geologicalhistory. There is good reason, therefore, to speculate that the location whichthe Martians chose to escape to when fleeing their dying planet was Earth, asMcMoneagle himself concluded, and Antarctica in particular as Goode states.What lends further credence to the arrival of ancient extraterrestrial refugeesin spacecraft to a once temperate Antarctica is the testimony of Dr. PetePeterson. He said he explored the remains of a crashed spacecraft found inAntarctica, and offered details about what he saw in a 2017 interview: Well, there was a crash there about 200,000 years ago. And at that time, it wastropical. There were palm trees there. Where the crash was, there were palmtrees. That's about three miles under the ice now. That's being excavated.They're putting a huge tunnel down into that one.…So the early stuff, the low stuff, that's down underneath two or three otherlayers of civilization, is very ancient, seemingly very ancient civilization,probably where they would have used these gear-driven navigation instruments.But the navigation instruments, the gears, the gear ratios, were all set up forthis galaxy….You're going to find several layers, separate layers, of occupation. You'regoing to find several separate layers of what the exterior was like at the timethat civilization was there. Only the last layer was it really Antarctica. Priorto that, it was a tropical island. And part of that, it was part of a very muchlarger island. Probably good pieces of it were pieces of Atlantis that actuallypicked up and moved down there.[460] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn460] Peterson’s testimony answers the question of where the Martian refugees,described in McMoneagle’s remote viewing session, relocated after theirplanetary catastrophe. As to when the incident occurred, Skip Atwater placed therange from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years ago. Peterson’sestimate of 200,000 years is also consistent with McMoneagle’s description.Therefore, they all appear to be identifying the same event in Antarctica’shistory when the continent was located in a tropical zone of the planet.Peterson indicates that there were several landings or crashes ofextraterrestrial vehicles, with each corresponding to a different civilizationbeing established, including that of Atlantis.All of these similarities support Goode’s claim that the Pre-Adamitecivilization he witnessed, buried deep under the Antarctic ice sheets, indeedbelonged to ancient Martian refugees. However, while Peterson and the CIA remoteviewing document suggest that the Martians arrived approximately 200,000 yearsago, Goode contends they arrived approximately 55,000 years ago via the Moon. "},{"pageContent":"EARTH’S MOON BECOMES A REFUGEE SHIP According to Goode’s information, billions of refugees from both Mars and theSuper Earth (aka Maldek) found refuge on Earth’s Moon, which was anothersatellite of the Super Earth, before it was destroyed and became the asteroidbelt.[461] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn461] Goode said the Moon wasartificially altered to create vast living areas inside its interior, built outof an ancient cavern system. Support for Goode’s extraordinary claim come from a2017 Japanese scientific study of the moon, which has identified a naturalcavern system within it. Here is how Laura Geggel, Senior Writer for LiveScience, described the findings of the Japanese scientists: A city-size lava tube has been discovered on the moon, and researchers say itcould serve as a shelter for lunar astronauts. This lava tube could protectlunar-living astronauts from hazardous conditions on the moon's surface, theresearchers said. Such a tube could even harbor a lunar colony, they added….Earth also has lava tubes, but they're not nearly as large as the one discoveredon the moon. If the scientists' gravity analyses are correct, the lava tube nearMarius Hills could easily house a large U.S. city such as Philadelphia, theysaid.[462] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn462] The size of the Moon’s caverns are large enough to fit a large metropolitancity, as illustrated in the following diagram (Figure 65) showing howPhiladelphia could easily fit inside one of them. [../images/00065.jpeg]Figure 64. The city of Philadelphia could easily fit inside a theoretical lunarlava tube. Credit: David Blair/Purdue University Goode read in the SSP data archive that the Pre-Adamites inhabited the Moon forapproximately 440,000 years, and at some point during this period the Moon wasmoved into its present orbit around the Earth. Compelling verification for thisview that the Moon only came to orbit Earth about 60 thousand years ago comesfrom a number of historical texts. The researcher, Immanuel Velikovsky, foundnumerous ancient references to pre-lunar cultures on Earth, some of which hedescribed as follows: The period when the Earth was Moonless is probably the most remote recollectionof mankind. Democritus and Anaxagoras taught that there was a time when theEarth was without the Moon. Aristotle wrote that Arcadia in Greece, before beinginhabited by the Hellenes, had a population of Pelasgians, and that theseaborigines occupied the land already before there was a moon in the sky abovethe Earth; for this reason they were called Proselenes.Apollonius of Rhodes mentioned the time “when not all the orbs were yet in theheavens, before the Danai and Deukalion races came into existence, and only theArcadians lived, of whom it is said that they dwelt on mountains and fed onacorns, before there was a moon.” Plutarch wrote in The Roman Questions: “Therewere Arcadians of Evander’s following, the so-called pre-Lunar people.”[463][part0000_split_079.html#_edn463] These historical accounts, along with the recent scientific discovery of hugelunar caverns, make Goode’s remarkable claim about the Moon being a refugee shipfrom a destroyed Super Earth very plausible. "},{"pageContent":"PRE-ADAMITES ESCAPE THE MOON AND ARRIVE IN ANTARCTICA The Pre-Adamites (Martians) found refuge on the Moon, but eventually anotherconflict came and they had to quickly move to the nearby Earth. According toGoode, they chose Antarctica to rebuild their civilization, due in part to thepresence here of “Ancient Builder Race” technologies which were stillfunctioning: Then they [Pre-Adamites] end up on the Moon for a period of time. And thensomehow they ended up getting chased off the Moon. There were some attacks thatoccurred, and after that they fled, but their craft were too damaged to leaveour solar system or make it to another planetary sphere. So since they had tocrash-land on Earth, they decided that they would go to this one continent thatstill had working Ancient Builder Race technology that was … 1.8 billion yearsold.[464] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn464] After a crash landing in Antarctica, the Pre-Adamites only had their threemotherships to use to establish a new colony on Earth. It was the technology inthese motherships that gave the Pre-Adamites hope that they could rebuild theircivilization: Well, they only had the technology that they had on these three craft with them.That’s all the technology they had. So they had to cannibalize and repurposethat technology from the spacecraft once they had crash-landed.[465][part0000_split_079.html#_edn465] David Wilcock interviewed Goode on Cosmic Disclosure about these ancient events,and had some corroborating information to share from Dr. Pete Peterson regardingthe size and location of one of the discovered motherships: David: And I want to point out, that this was one of the absolutely stunningdetails in which I start to ask Pete [Peterson] on the phone, “Do you knowanything about Antarctica?”And he independently says, “They’re going to announce that they found amothership.” He only knew about one – a mothership that was 30 miles wide,mostly circular in shape – that’s been found under the ice. [466][part0000_split_079.html#_edn466] In contrast to Peterson, Goode says that the largest of the motherships wasthree miles in length.During that interview, Goode described the Pre-Adamites who settled in theAntarctic: “They range 12-14 foot tall. They have elongated skulls. They werevery spindly, thin.”[467] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn467] Significantly, thisdescription is very similar to how the inhabitants on Mars were described in theMay 1984 CIA remote viewing document.[468] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn468]After spending over four hundred thousand years on the Moon with its even lowergravity field, the Pre-Adamites may have increased in body height even furtherto finally result in their spindly 12-14 foot stature.On Earth, because of stronger gravity, the Pre-Adamites would now findthemselves at a clear disadvantage compared to native inhabitants, in terms ofphysical strength, speed and stamina. In turn, in terms of geopolitical power,this meant the Pre-Adamites would have to rely on their advanced technologies,along with those more advanced ‘Builder Race’ technologies located inAntarctica. Consequently, references to Atlantis and other technologicallyadvanced cultures found around the planet may be signs of a dominant globalcivilization established by the Pre-Adamites, whose hub was Antarctica. Indeed,the Pre-Adamites may well have been the fabled “Fallen Angels” described in theBook of Enoch, whose advanced technologies led to a major conflict in thepre-diluvial world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 ANTARCTICA, DEMIGODS & THE BOOK OF ENOCH "},{"pageContent":"EXTRATERRESTRIAL COLONY CREATED ELITE BLOODLINE RULERS After arriving in Antarctica from the Moon approximately 55,000 years ago, thePre-Adamites found a rich fertile planet with a large native population lesstechnologically advanced than themselves. Soon after, the Pre-Adamites decidedto create hybrid beings using their advanced genetic technology, who would actas intermediaries for them with the rest of the Earth’s population, as CoreyGoode explained: They had created hybrids because they could not operate in our environment verywell. And they created hybrids of them and the humans that were here on Earth …all of the main Pre-Adamites that were pure blood were down in Antarctica …There was a group of these Pre-Adamites, of this Pre-Adamite bloodline, that wasin the Central America, South America region, and there was another completelydifferent bloodline group – both royals – in Asia and Europe.[469][part0000_split_079.html#_edn469] Essentially, while the pure-blooded Pre-Adamites remained in Antarctica close tothe advanced technologies in their large motherships, the hybrid Pre-Adamiteswere to be used to rule over humanity in the different colonies establishedaround the planet.Goode’s historical information parallels that of the Ancient Egyptian historian,Manetho, who wrote about pre-dynastic times – when the “Gods” directly ruledover Egypt. These Gods then placed their genetic offspring, hybrids or demi-godsinto leadership positions. Manetho’s writings are preserved in varioushistorical fragments retold by ancient writers such as Eusebius, who wrote: From the Egyptian History of Manetho, who composed his account in three books.These deal with the Gods, the Demigods, the Spirits of the Dead, and the mortalkings who ruled Egypt down to Darius, king of the Persians … After the Gods,Demigods reigned for 1255 years, and again another line of kings held sway for1817 years: then came thirty more kings of Memphis, reigning for 1790 years; andthen again ten kings of This, reigning for 350 years…. [470][part0000_split_079.html#_edn470] It should be noted that ancient depictions of Egyptian rulers such as theEmperor Akhenaton and Queen Nefertiti show them possessing elongated skulls.Goode described the Pre-Adamites in Antarctica as possessing elongated skulls,which held larger sized brains. Scientists today point out brain size capacityis a direct marker of intelligence, and consequently, of leadership abilities.In 1913, elongated skulls were discovered in the town of Boskop, South Africawhich showed that a race of beings once inhabited that area who had a 30% largerbrain capacity than modern Homo sapiens. The Boskop remains, and similardiscoveries of elongated skulls at sites around the world have led scientists topostulate how much smarter this group would have been compared to normal Homosapiens. Two distinguished neurosurgeons published a book about the Boskop skulldiscovery, which casts light on the relationship between brain size andintelligence.[471] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn471] In an extract published inDiscover Magazine, they wrote: Even if brain size accounts for just 10 to 20 percent of an IQ test score, it ispossible to conjecture what kind of average scores would be made by a group ofpeople with 30 percent larger brains. We can readily calculate that a populationwith a mean brain size of 1,750 cc would be expected to have an average IQ of149.This is a score that would be labeled at the genius level. And if there wasnormal variability among Boskops, as among the rest of us, then perhaps 15 to 20percent of them would be expected to score over 180. In a classroom with 35big-headed, baby-faced Boskop kids, you would likely encounter five or six withIQ scores at the upper range of what has ever been recorded in humanhistory.[472] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn472] It is fair to conclude, based on scientific studies, that humans possessingelongated skulls with larger brain capacity were the natural leaders of theancient world. As members of the ruling human Egyptian dynasties, Akhenaton andNefertiti therefore possessed a genetic trait that could be traced to theoriginal gods, the Pre-Adamites, who were distinguished by their notable heightand cranial elongation. This genetic or “bloodline” connection to theGods/Pre-Adamites, as claimed by Goode, is where the ancient idea of the divineright of kings was derived. [../images/00066.jpeg]Figure 65. A detail from a wall-painting picturing the daughters of PharaohAkhenaten and Queen Nefertiti, 18th Dynasty, c.13-45-1335 BC. A similar scenario is described in the Sumerian King’s List, which chroniclesthe reigns of kings both prior to, and after, the Great Flood, an event alsodepicted in the Old Testament and in Sumerian texts, such as the Epic ofGilgamesh.[473] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn473] The account of the first listof kings begins: After the kingship descended from heaven, the Kingship was in Eridug. In Eridug,Alulim became king; he ruled for 28800 years. Alaljar ruled for 36000 years. 2kings; they ruled for 64800 years. Then Eridug fell and the kingship was takento Bad-tibira. In Bad-tibira, En-men-lu-ana ruled for 43200 years.En-men-gal-ana ruled for 28800 years. Dumuzid, the shepherd, ruled for 36000years. 3 kings; they ruled for 108000 years. …”[474][part0000_split_079.html#_edn474] Here the King’s List is clearly suggesting that the kings who came before theGreat Flood were connected to heavenly beings, and their fantastically longperiods of rule also indicate these kings were considered as Gods or Angels,whom we would likely call today, extraterrestrial visitors.In the case of the postdiluvian rulers, the King’s List continues: “After the flood had swept over, and the kingship had descended from heaven, thekingship was in Kic. In Kic, Jucur became king; he ruled for 1200 years.Kullassina-bel ruled for 960 (ms. P2+L2 has instead: 900) years. Nanjiclicmaruled for (ms. P2+L2 has:) 670 (?) years. En-tarah-ana ruled for (ms. P2+L2has:) 420 years”[475] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn475] This passage lays the foundation once again for the divine right of kingsresting in some connection to heavenly beings. This time, however, the rulersare described as reigning for much shorter periods than the original kings, yetmuch longer than human kings. This passage suggests these kings were demigods,as described by Manetho, or human-extraterrestrial hybrids as described byGoode, who could live up to a thousand years or so.As the Kings List progresses, the reigns of rulers becomes shorter and shorter,as typified by Sargon of Agade who ruled between 2340-2284 BC: In Agade, Sargon, whose father was a gardener, the cupbearer of Ur-Zababa,became king, the king of Agade, who built Agade (ms. L1+N1 has instead: underwhom Agade was built); he ruled for 56 (ms. L1+N1 has instead: 55) (ms. TL hasinstead: 54) years. Rimuc, the son of Sargon, ruled for 9 (ms. IB has instead:7) (ms. L1+N1 has instead: 15) years. Man-icticcu, the older brother of Rimuc,the son of Sargon, ruled for 15 (ms. L1+N1 has instead: 7) years. Naram-Suen,the son of Man-icticcu, ruled for (mss. L1+N1, P3+BT14 have:) 56 years.Car-kali-carri, the son of Naram-Suen, ruled for (ms. L1+N1, Su+Su4 have:) 25(ms. P3+BT14 has instead: 24) years. [476] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn476] By Sargon’s time, human kings are clearly being identified with similar lifespans as modern humans. But what occurred that led to this remarkabletransition, from God-kings (extraterrestrials) ruling thousands of years,demigods (human-extraterrestrial hybrids) ruling centuries, and then human kings(with genetic connections to their predecessors) ruling mere decades?Both Manetho’s History and the Kings List indicate that there was a steadydecrease in the genetic purity, and hence, longevity of the rulers of ancientcivilizations, dating back hundreds of thousands of years. Certainly, theChristian Old Testament reports a similar phenomenon; insofar as pre-diluvialfigures such as Adam, Jared, Methuselah and Noah who all lived to be over 900years of age.[477] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn477]In the immediate period after the great flood, the Old Testament refers topatriarchal figures living steadily shorter lives. For example, Shem, one of thesons of Noah lived to 600 years, his son Arpachshad lived to be 438 years ofage, and his grandson Shelah lived to be 403 years old.[478][part0000_split_079.html#_edn478] By the time of Amram, father of Moses (c. 1400BC), lives were much shorter: Amram lived to 137 and Moses lived to 120.Conventional scholars dismiss these extensive periods of time chronicled inancient sources as myths. Goode’s information suggests otherwise. One or moregroups of extraterrestrial visitors settled on Earth in various historicalepochs, first ruling over, and then interbreeding with, humanity to create thesuccessive dynasties of kings, emperors and biblical patriarchs. It’s quiteprobable that the first kings of Egypt, Sumer, etc., either derived theirauthority and power from the Martians/Pre-Adamites who had settled inAntarctica, or were Martians/Pre-Adamites themselves.The Great Flood that occurred approximately 10,000 B.C.E. appears to have been avery significant event in the transition from the age of God-kings, to thesuccessive ages of Demigod kings, and finally, human kings and patriarchs. Asthe Kings List makes clear, the Great Flood is the historical marker for thetransition from an age of direct rule by the Gods (who individually ruledthousands of years), to Demigods (who ruled for centuries). This is mirroredvery closely in the Old Testament in terms of ancient patriarchs both prior toand after the Great Flood.Apparently, the Great Flood depicted in the Sumerian, Biblical and other worldtraditions was a catalyst for this very significant transition in human history.Graham Hancock, in his book Magicians of the Gods, describes various possibleexplanations for the last great flood, such as successive asteroid impacts.[479][part0000_split_079.html#_edn479] The scientific data Hancock provides is veryimpressive in detailing how the Great Flood depicted in historical texts mayhave been caused by multiple asteroid impacts spanning the Younger Dryas periodfrom c. 12,900 to 11,700 calendar years ago.Charles Hapgood’s theory of a pole shift, however, offers a more compellingexplanation for the last Great Flood. Not only does a Pole Shift explain how thelast Great Flood may have occurred, but it also provides a very important way ofunderstanding the transition in ages from the direct rule by Gods, to that ofDemigods and humans, as depicted in the Sumerian Kings List and Manetho’shistory of Egypt.If the Pre-Adamites did crash-land in Antarctica 55,000 years ago and establishtheir technological hub there as Goode claims, then we have an understanding ofwhy the last Great Flood/Pole Shift marked a decisive turning point in humancivilization. Antarctica, being repositioned to the polar region, now lay underice, which in years quickly thickened to grow into massive ice sheets. ThePre-Adamites/Martians could do little more than ride this cataclysmic event outusing the stasis chamber technology brought over from Mars aboard theirmotherships, as illustrated in McMoneagle’s May 1984 Mars remote viewing sessiondiscussed in chapter 13. It’s also likely that these stasis chambers enabled thePre-Adamites/Martians to live the tens of thousands of years described in theKings List.Not only did the Great Flood bury the mother colony of the Pre-Adamitescivilization under ice, but it cut off their hybrid vassals from the advancedtechnologies used to maintain control over their colonies around the Earth. Thisled to the Pre-Adamites’ major extraterrestrial rival, who vied for directinfluence over human affairs, to now step forward to fill the vacuum.The Pre-Adamites were not the only extraterrestrial race active on Earth 55,000years ago according to Goode’s sources. He says that among the races was anon-human species, the Reptilians, who quickly emerged as the Pre-Adamites’primary rival in dominating planetary affairs. Goode details the conflictbetween the Pre-Adamites and the Reptilians; and how the Pre-Adamites in thebeginning had the upper hand, due to their advanced technologies. However, theReptilians slowly gained ascendance after a series of “smaller catastrophes”took place as a precursor to the even more destructive geological event, theGreat Flood, which came later: Apparently these Pre-Adamites have been in conflicts with the Reptilians for awhile. These Pre-Adamites they stated were not good guys at all, but were insome sort of a conflict with the Reptilians, and had actually kept theReptilians in check here on the Earth during that time that they hadcrash-landed here.There had been a couple other smaller catastrophes that happened where they hadlost their power and the Reptilians always find an opportunity to come back in amoment of weakness.[480] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn480] During the great catastrophe (approximately 12,000 years ago), the Antarcticcontinent was flash frozen during the Earth’s sudden pole shift, which cut offthe Pre-Adamites’ outposts around the world from their main base of power. https://i0.wp.com/162.144.207.78/%7Eexopoli3/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/12_Anshar_egg_shaped_craft_in_Antarctica-1024x572.jpg?resize=750%2C419[../images/00067.jpeg]Figure 66. Graphic depiction of Corey Goode visiting Antarctica excavationswith Pre-Adamite/hybrid bodies. Courtesy of www.Gaia.com Now, the Reptilians would become dominant in planetary affairs: … But after these cataclysms that occurred on Earth, the Pre-Adamites and theReptilians sort of had a truce or a treaty. And after that point, the Reptilianspretty much controlled all of Antarctica and the Pre-Adamites had zero abilityto get access to their ancient technology, their libraries. Everything was downthere.Hybrids of the Pre-Adamites were able to escape the catastrophe in their globaloutposts, but those of the pure bloodline were stuck in Antarctica in theirgiant motherships.This [Pre-Adamite] civilization controlled the entire planet. What littleresources they had, they were able to control the planet. After this lastcataclysm occurred, none of the survivors, Pre-Adamite survivors, had access totheir technology.So we mentioned the group that was in Asia, Pre-Adamite group, and there wasanother one in South America, Central America, they could no longer visit orcommunicate with each other. They were separated.[481][part0000_split_079.html#_edn481] The elongated skulls found in South and Central America trace back to thePre-Adamite hybrids who ruled over their colonies in these areas: In South and Central America is where they had set up most of their enclaves.And they had been set up around other Pre-Adamite structures that were nowdestroyed because of the cataclysm. There were huge earthquakes that basicallyliquified the ground and a lot of the buildings, massive buildings, they hadjust fell apart and fell and sunk into the ground. They were running thehemisphere. They were mixing their genetics with some of the indigenous peopleof South and Central America. That’s why we have elongated skulls beings thathave a different colored skin but different genetic mix.[482][part0000_split_079.html#_edn482] The two major Pre-Adamite colonies, one spanning Asia and Europe, and the otherencompassing South and Central America, vied with each other in a competitionbetween their two bloodlines, which continues today through two major factionsof the Illuminati: And they had always had some sort of a competition between these two bloodlinegroups even before the cataclysm. This whole bloodline of these Cabal orIlluminati-type people, they trace their bloodlines through these Pre-Adamites.[483] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn483] The rivalry between the Pre-Adamite bloodline factions and their conflict withthe Reptilians provides an answer to the question of what happened to thehybrids with elongated skulls that formed humanity’s ruling elite.In their book, Big Brain, Gary Lynch and Richard Granger attempt to answer thequestion of what happened to the Boskop humans, whose elongated skulls heldlarger brains, giving them intelligence significantly higher than modern humans.At some point, they formed the leadership class, as Egyptian artwork clearlydepicts, yet by the modern era they had disappeared. Lynch and Granger ask thequestion, why did this childlike large-skulled human disappear?: The Boskops coexisted with our Homo sapiens forebears. Just as we see theancient Homo erectus as a savage primitive, Boskop may have viewed us insomewhat the same way. They died and we lived, and we can’t answer the questionwhy. Why didn’t they outthink the smaller-brained hominids like ourselves andspread across the planet? [484] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn484] Given what Goode has revealed about the Reptilian/Pre-Adamite conflict, we canspeculate that post-diluvian Homo sapiens were inspired by the Reptilians torevolt against the Pre-Adamite hybrids. This is echoed in the Old Testament, inthe story in which Adam and Eve are tempted by the serpent to eat of the tree ofknowledge, and are expelled out of Eden. After the Great Flood, surviving Homosapiens subsequently conducted ancient pogroms to kill most of the Pre-Adamiteshybrids (Boskops) and drive the survivors underground.If we accept that Reptilians are another extraterrestrial group who exercisedgreat influence from behind the scenes through their own hybrids, then we cansee that the Earth’s hidden rulers are divided into distinct factions, with along history of conflict through the use of human proxies. This is perhapsnowhere better exemplified than in the “Book of Enoch”, which describesdifferent groups of “angels” at war with one another. In a Cosmic Disclosureinterview, Goode and Wilcock exchanged the following on this subject: David: So in the Book of Enoch, they’re describing this group as the fallenangels.Corey: Uh-huh.David: So you’re saying these Pre-Adamites with the elongated skulls, that thatis the fallen angel storyline.Corey: It is the fallen angel storyline, yes. Many of the original refugeePre-Adamites are currently in stasis in their motherships buried under theAntarctica ice … Well, they had a number of beings that were in stasis. Theinformation I received was that the surviving Pre-Adamites, the bloodline thatoriginally came from another planet, had put themselves in stasis before thiscataclysm occurred about 12,800 years ago. They have not awoken them yet.They’re trying to decide what they’re going to do.[485][part0000_split_079.html#_edn485] What Goode has been told and personally witnessed in Antarctica tells us a lotabout Antarctica’s secret history, and the role of different extraterrestrialgroups who established control over this vast icy continent almost double thesize of the lower 48 U.S. states. Goode also leaves us with a profound questionto contemplate: “What happens when the Pre-Adamites are awakened in their stasischambers and discover that our current global civilization is very different towhat they may desire?”"},{"pageContent":"ANTARCTICA AND IMPRISONED FALLEN ANGELS FROM THE BOOK OF ENOCH On March 14, 2017, Israeli News Live published a provocative story titled, “TheFallen Angels Imprisoned in Antarctica and are still Alive.”[486][part0000_split_079.html#_edn486] The commentator, Steven Ben-Nun, a PoliticalJournalist and Biblical Scholar, analyzed the apocryphal Book of Enoch, whichdescribes the experiences of Enoch, a pre-deluvian biblical figure who was takeninto the heavens to witness and play a key role in a major celestial conflict.Since Goode asserts that the Fallen Angels information in the Book of Enoch isrelevant to the Pre-Adamite discovery in Antarctica, it’s worth exploring thissubject further. According to the ancient text, Enoch became the principal intermediary betweentwo sides in a conflict between “Fallen Angels”, and “Righteous Angels” servingan all-knowing deity, referred to as “the Lord”. Multiple issues incited theconflict, including the Fallen Angels’ practice of interbreeding and/orperforming genetic experiments upon humanity, and their passing on of forbiddenknowledge and technologies to the still developing human civilization.The Book of Enoch begins with the arrival of 200 Fallen Angels in the area ofMount Hermon, which borders modern-day Lebanon and Syria. The Fallen Angelsbegan interbreeding and/or genetically modifying the local inhabitants. 6.1 And it came to pass, when the sons of men had increased, that in those daysthere were born to them fair and beautiful daughters.6.2 And the Angels, the sons of Heaven, saw them and desired them. And they saidto one another: “Come, let us choose for ourselves wives, from the children ofmen, and let us beget, for ourselves, children.” …6.6 And they were, in all, two hundred and they came down on Ardis, which is thesummit of Mount Hermon. And they called the mountain Hermon because on it theyswore and bound one another with curses.[487] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn487] While the Fallen Angels had established an outpost on Mt. Hermon, it wasAntarctica where they would ultimately be confined after losing the heavenlybattle with the Righteous Angels, according to Ben-Nun’s analysis of the Book ofEnoch.Ben-Nun cites passages from the Book of Enoch which are very suggestive ofAntarctica being the very location where Enoch was taken to witness celestialevents: 18.5 And I saw the winds on the Earth which support the clouds and I saw thepaths of the Angels. I saw at the end of the Earth; the firmament of Heavenabove.18.6 And I went towards the south, and it was burning day and night, where therewere seven mountains of precious stones, three towards the east and threetowards the south.18.7 And those towards the east were of coloured stone, and one was of pearl,and one of healing stone; and those towards the south, of red stone.18.8 And the middle one reached to Heaven, like the throne of the Lord, ofstibium, and the top of the throne was of sapphire.[488][part0000_split_079.html#_edn488] What’s interesting in the above passage is that Enoch refers to a location that“was burning day and night”. Ben-Nun believes this fits the conditions ofAntarctica during the Southern Hemisphere summer season when there is 24 hoursunlight.Regarding the seven mountains mentioned in the book’s passages, the one that“reached to Heaven” appears to refer to Mount Vinson in the Sentinel Range ofAntarctica, according to Ben-Nun. He also refers to six nearby mountains in thatrange which might qualify as the other mountains described in the ancient text.Mount Vinson is the highest mountain in Antarctica, and is located towards themiddle of the Sentinel Range. It would have stood out with its massive height ofover 16,000 ft. (4892 m) just as spectacularly in ancient times as it doestoday.Ben-Nun speculates the southern and eastern alignment of the six adjacentmountains to the central mountain, described in the Book of Enoch, compares toMount Vernon and it’s six highest adjacent mountains’ alignment prior to thecatastrophic flood event (which coincided with a shifting of the Earth’s axis ofrotation). https://i2.wp.com/exopolitics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Mt-Vinson-and-six-adjoining-mountains.jpg?resize=700%2C439[../images/00068.jpeg]Figure 67. Mount Vinson and adjoining mountains This in turn directly relates to the research conducted by Sir Charles Hapgood,whose proposed pole shift happened at the end of the last ice age, about 11,000BC.[489] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn489] Ben-Nun’s conjecture is interesting,but as one can see from the map showing the Sentinel Range where Mount Vinson issituated (see Figure 67), there are far more than seven mountains in the range.Thus, Ben-Nun’s theory is not conclusive, as he himself points out.Nevertheless, he gives us the possible location of the imprisoned Fallen Angels;Mount Vinson, and/or six other mountains in the Sentinel Range.Ben-Nun goes on to discuss the Book of Enoch’s reference to imprisoned FallenAngels, and concludes they were removed from Mount Hermon and relocated toAntarctica (Mount Vinson/Sentinel Range): 8.14 And like a spirit questioning me, the Angel said: “This is the place of theend of Heaven and Earth; this is the prison for the Stars of Heaven and the Hostof Heaven.18.15 And the stars which roll over the fire, these are the ones whichtransgressed the command of the Lord, from the beginning of their rising,because they did not come out at their proper times.18.16 And He was angry with them, and bound them until the time of theconsummation of their sin, in the Year of Mystery.”[490][part0000_split_079.html#_edn490] Ben-Nun’s reference to the Fallen Angels still being alive in their Antarcticaprison raises an intriguing possibility. Is the foretold liberation of theFallen Angels in the “Year of Mystery” an event we will shortly witness?For an answer, some intriguing parallels between Ben-Nun’s study of the Book ofEnoch, and the recent disclosures by Corey Goode concerning Antarctica need tobe analyzed. Like the pre-diluvial biblical figure Enoch, Goode also says he wastaken to witness celestial events by a recently arrived group of highly evolvedextraterrestrials – called the “Sphere Being Alliance”. Again, like Enoch, Goodewas purportedly asked to act as an intermediary between two sides in a“heavenly” or solar system-wide conflict.Goode claims this all began in March 2015, when he accepted the role of delegatefor the Sphere Being Alliance in on-going negotiations between differentfactions and groups from both Earth and off-world civilizations.[491][part0000_split_079.html#_edn491] Events developed over the next two years thatled to Goode being taken to Antarctica twice to witness events. Goode says themost recent in January 2017 involved a clandestine trip enabling him to view theremains of a Pre-Adamite civilization that had flourished until a major globalcatastrophe, corresponding with the great flood, had destroyed coastal citiesand low-lying lands all around the world approximately 12,000-13,000 yearsago.[492] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn492]Goode explains that the Pre-Adamites survived by entering stasis chambers in thelargest of three motherships that had crash landed on Earth around 60,000 yearsago, after the Pre-Adamites were expelled from the Moon due to a conflict withthe dominant extraterrestrial factions there. The Pre-Adamites set up theirmajor base of operations in Antarctica, and established outposts in Asia, Europeand the Americas.[493] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn493] Goode further contendsthat a conflict soon emerged between the Pre-Adamites and other human-lookingextraterrestrial groups, who had been conducting 22 specific genetic experimentsinvolving surface humanity for nearly 500,000 years.Goode first discussed the 22 long-term genetic experiments at length in a May17, 2015 Facebook post: In the last Human-Like Federation Conference … after a short presentation I wasasked to deliver there was then a follow up of each of the over 60 BeingsPresent (Usually Never More Than 40 Beings Present). Among these were thoseinvolved in the 22 Scientifically Documented Presentations delivered decadesprior claiming to have created/engineered Earth Humans genetically. Each of thebeings present gave a short presentation of what they considered their\"Contributions To Humanity\" over the thousands of years they had been managinghuman affairs. This was the exact same setting that I had attended in anIntuitive Empath Support Role when I was younger and did not understand what wasgoing on. Being an actual \"Delegate\" this time I understood everything going onand said. It was interesting that each group seemed to make a case that they hadbeen a positive influence on the creation and management of humanity. Of coursethis was their point of view and the \"IE's\" present in support of us detected nodanger or deception.[494] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn494] Alex Collier, who claims he had interactions with a group of extraterrestrialsfrom the Andromeda constellation, says they told him about 22 geneticexperiments run by different human-looking alien groups stretching back intohuman antiquity: In a nutshell, we are a composite of a lot of different races, 22 to be exact.It is a physiological fact that there are 22 different body types on the planet.And that is the result of the extraterrestrial races.[495][part0000_split_079.html#_edn495] Goode and Collier’s historical accounts suggest that these human-lookingextraterrestrial groups eventually came into conflict with the Pre-Adamitesoperating out of Antarctica.Here, Goode’s explanation of historical events resonates with Ben-Nun’s ownanalysis of events found in the Book of Enoch. Goode’s Pre-Adamites appear to bethe same “Fallen Angels” described in the age-old book in terms of theirinterbreeding and/or genetic experiments using the local human population. Also,the ancient text’s landing of 200 Fallen Angels at Mount Hermon and the accountof their subsequent actions is consistent with Goode’s claim that thePre-Adamites established colonies all over the Earth, genetically altered thelocal humans, and installed hybrids into leadership positions.[496][part0000_split_079.html#_edn496]Regarding the Righteous Angels described in the Book of Enoch, these appear tobe the extraterrestrial groups who were conducting the 22 long-term geneticexperiments, which were later interfered with by the Pre-Adamites. Recently, theSphere Being Alliance has leveled the playing field for constructivenegotiations between different space programs and extraterrestrial factions, themodern-day Fallen and Righteous Angels, and in these terms, appears to play asimilar role to the all-knowing “Lord” mentioned in the Book of Enoch. Ben-Nun’sanalytical conclusion that the Fallen Angels were imprisoned in Antarctica, andare still alive, corresponds with Goode’s claim that the Pre-Adamites are instasis-chambers on one of their three spacecraft buried deep below the AntarcticIce Shelf. Finally, Goode has revealed that excavations in Antarctica areunderway, and that the stasis chambers containing the Pre-Adamites have beenfound.[497] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn497] He says that the decision aboutwhether to awaken them or not is still to be made.[498][part0000_split_079.html#_edn498]The hybrid descendants of the Pre-Adamites, who are among the elite bloodlinefamilies that secretly have ruled humanity, are eager to gain access to thestasis chambers and to reawaken their ancient ancestors. This may explain whythere was a succession of VIP visitors to Antarctica in 2016/2017, includingformer Secretary of State John Kerry, former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, RussianPatriarch Kirill, Australia’s Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove, and others.The goal of reawakening the Pre-Adamites appears to be to have them re-assumetheir former dominance in planetary affairs, thereby allowing their hybridoff-spring to step out of the shadows and directly rule over humanity. Thissuggests that the “Year of Mystery” mentioned in the Book of Enoch, when the“Fallen Angels” are liberated, may be very close.All this leads to an intriguing question. Is Goode himself a modern-day Enochbeing given the key role to witness and mediate between different human andextraterrestrial factions as the delegate of the Sphere Being Alliance, whichappears to be functioning identically to the all-knowing deity described in theBook of Enoch? If so, this would suggest that Enoch himself was anextraterrestrial contactee of the Sphere Being Alliance or a similar group,13,000 years ago. If the Pre-Adamites/Fallen Angels are awakened/liberated, thenthere will certainly be a need to deal with them and their hybrid offspringregarding the roles they are to play as humankind awakens to the truth of itshistory, including its manipulation by multiple extraterrestrial groups andelite bloodline families. "},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSION According to the history shared by Goode and Tompkins, there are three primaryfactions of extraterrestrials who have interacted with humanity over themillennia and intersected in Antarctica’s ancient past. The first are thehuman-looking or “Nordic” extraterrestrials. They have been responsible for 22long-term genetic experiments going back 500,000 years, where human geneticshave been altered in accord with global contingencies. Apparently, according toGoode, some of these alterations are connected to the use of ancient “BuilderRace” technologies, and to Inner Earth beings who claim they are our futuredescendants sent back in time 18 million years or so to protect the timelines.Antarctica is a vast repository for some of this ancient builder racetechnology, which is highly sought after or protected by the Nordics and InnerEarth groups. Both of these groups appear to support human freedom andcreativity as necessary ingredients for human evolution, which appears to occurin planet wide experiments that last millennia before being reset through somemajor global cataclysmic event. This corresponds to historical references by theAncient Greeks, Mayans, Vedic Indians, Native Americans, etc., about thedifferent planetary ages when great advances in human civilization occurred.This rather benign view of human evolution does not appear to be shared by theother two major extraterrestrial factions, who ruthlessly use humanity asproxies for expanding their power and influence.The second faction are the Pre-Adamites who crash-landed in Antarcticaapproximately 55,000 years ago per Goode’s testimony, and established coloniesaround the planet where their hybrids were put in positions of power. The humancolonies, controlled by the Pre-Adamites, appear to have been slave societies,wherein a strict hierarchical power system was put in place and a person’sposition depended on their bloodline. This is the origin of today’s elitebloodline families who manipulate humanity from behind the scenes.The Book of Enoch describes the conflict between the Pre-Adamites and the“Nordics”, which led to the former’s banishment/imprisonment in Antarctica. Thissuggests that the Pole Shift which flash froze Antarctica was a result ofgeo-engineering by the Nordics or higher dimensional beings that wanted to freehumanity from Pre-Adamite domination, for a new planet-wide experiment.The third extraterrestrial faction are the Reptilians, whose history on Earthalso goes back many millennia. It’s quite possible that the end of the Dinosaurage 65 million years ago was another geo-engineered event that drove thesurviving Reptilians underground. Once again, this may have been a result of theNordics and/or higher dimensional beings using geo-engineering in order to resetthe surface conditions for a new set of global genetic experiments, this timeallowing the evolution of humans on the planet’s surface.The Reptilian presence in Antarctica was made possible by the cataclysmic eventsthat occurred approximately 12,000 years ago, which removed their major globalrival from the scene and drove them underground – the Pre-Adamites. With theeclipse of the Pre-Adamites, the Reptilians were able to augment their power,and asserted their influence around the planet through endless wars of conquestusing human proxies. This is certainly the scenario depicted in books such asJim Marrs’ Rule by Secrecy and William Bramley’s Gods of Eden.Earlier in this book, it was shown how a faction of Reptilian extraterrestrialscalled “Draconians” had established a presence in Antarctica within many largecaverns, and later shared the location of several of them with the German secretsocieties during WWII. This founded a German-Draconian Reptilian alliance thathas steadily grown, through secret agreements with U.S. and European leaders,into a global power – the Fourth Reich. Currently, Antarctica is a power basefor the Fourth Reich through the presence of two inter-linked space programs.The first program, the Dark Fleet, is the direct offshoot of Hitler’s and GermanSecret Societies’ flying saucer projects, which later allied with DraconianReptilians based in Antarctica. The second is the Interplanetary CorporateConglomerate, which grew out of the secret agreements between the Fourth Reichand the Eisenhower administration. These agreements allowed for the rapidexpansion of the German Antarctic bases into vast industrial areas, six of whichGoode purportedly saw first-hand during his two trips to Antarctica in 2016 and2017.Today, Antarctica is largely controlled by the Fourth Reich/Dark Fleet and theirpartners, the Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate – both of whom are alignedwith the Draconian Reptilians. This raises the question: What will happen if theReptilians former enemy, the Pre-Adamites, are awakened from their stasischambers by their Cabal/Illuminati descendants? Will this lead to outrightconflict causing planetary devastation, or even an “alliance of convenience”between the Reptilians and Pre-Adamites to subjugate the rest of humanity?Information from both Goode and Tompkins suggests that the Fourth Reich’spractice of slave labor, which is extensively applied in Antarctica, is likelyto be embraced by the Pre-Adamites. Such shared ideologies could catalyze analliance of convenience to enslave the rest of humanity, who would become meresubjects for their own long-term genetic experiments. In the next chapter, Iwill reveal the extent of human experimentation taking place in Antarctica, andhow this needs to be exposed in order to prevent such abhorrent practices frombeing introduced across the rest of the planet by stealth."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 ILLEGAL R&D IN ANTARCTICA "},{"pageContent":"UNACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAMS AND THE ANTARCTIC TREATY When it comes to any classified projects in Antarctica that violate the 1961Antarctic Treaty, there are two types of “unacknowledged” research anddevelopment systems that need to be considered. The first involvesunacknowledged programs that are related to different national militaries andintelligence agencies, which are allocated at various levels of securityclassification for the conduct of such programs. Within the U.S. Department ofDefense and the U.S. Intelligence Community, such classified programs are knownas Special Access Programs (SAP). Some of these classified programs are“unacknowledged” in so far as their existence is not publicly admitted.According to a 1995 Department of Defense manual titled, “National IndustrialSecurity Program Operating Manual”: There are two types of SAPs, acknowledged and unacknowledged. An acknowledgedSAP is a program which may be openly recognized or known; however, specifics areclassified within that SAP. The existence of an unacknowledged SAP or anunacknowledged portion of an acknowledged program, will not be made known to anyperson not authorized for this information.[499][part0000_split_079.html#_edn499] The Department of Defense manual goes on to clarify the measures taken to keepthe existence of unacknowledged programs secret: Unacknowledged SAPs require a significantly greater degree of protection thanacknowledged SAPs ... A SAP with protective controls that ensures the existenceof the Program is not acknowledged, affirmed, or made known to any person notauthorized for such information. All aspects (e.g., technical, operational,logistical, etc.) are handled in an unacknowledged manner. [500][part0000_split_079.html#_edn500] Stringent security requirements pertain to an Unacknowledged SAP (USAP),however, it may even be further classified, making it a “Waived” USAP. Accordingto a 1997 Senate investigation: Among black programs, further distinction is made for “waived” programs,considered to be so sensitive that they are exempt from standard reportingrequirements to the Congress. The chairperson, ranking member, and, on occasion,other members and staff of relevant Congressional committees are notified onlyorally of the existence of these programs.[501][part0000_split_079.html#_edn501] A strictly oral briefing is given for this type of program that is so classifiedthat U.S. Congressional members and others learning about it cannot admit to itsexistence or consult others for expert advice, which means that USAPs have noeffective congressional oversight placed upon them. Congress has to accept theword of the sponsoring military service or intelligence agency that the programis being run responsibly and in accord with U.S. laws and the Antarctic Treaty.Further, any Congressional member is required to deny the existence of such aprogram, and instead refer to a “cover story”. In this regard, a 1992 supplementto an earlier version of the Department of Defense manual states: Program Cover stories. (UNACKNOWLEDGED Program). Cover stories may beestablished for unacknowledged programs in order to protect the integrity of theprogram from individuals who do not have a need to know. Cover stories must bebelievable and cannot reveal any information regarding the true nature of thecontract. Cover stories for Special Access Programs must have the approval ofPSO [Program Security Officer] prior to dissemination.[502][part0000_split_079.html#_edn502] The second type of program dealing with unacknowledged activities involvesprivate corporations. Corporate run USAPs invoke similar security procedures tothose used by the U.S. military or intelligence agencies as a condition forworking on highly classified contracts. These industry standard securityprocedures by the Department of Defense are outlined in the “National IndustrialSecurity Program Operating Manual”. Here is how the 1997 U.S. Senate Reportsummarizes the current situation: Industrial contractors performing classified contracts are governed by theNational Industrial Security Program (NISP), created in 1993 by Executive Order12829 to “serve as a single, integrated, cohesive industrial security program toprotect classified information.” A Supplement to the NISP operating manual(NISPOM) was issued in February 1995 with a “menu of options” from whichgovernment program managers can select when establishing standards forcontractors involved with special access programs.[503][part0000_split_079.html#_edn503] It is common for national militaries and intelligence agencies to awardcontracts to private corporations for running aspects of unacknowledgedprograms, including those related to activities in Antarctica and Outer Space.For example, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Science Applications InternationalCorporation (SAIC), and General Dynamics are a few of the many U.S. companiesthat are awarded military/intelligence contracts for research and development onhighly classified programs, which include operations in Antarctica.Other Antarctic Treaty signatory states have their own equivalents to USAPs,involving unacknowledged activities conducted by national militaries andintelligence organizations, along with the assistance of private corporatecontractors. The scope and budgets of these officially sanctioned unacknowledgedprograms are not well known, and traditionally, are part of the nebulous worldof “black programs” that are funded in opaque ways, as explained by Tim Cook inBlank Check: The Pentagon’s Black Budget.[504] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn504]The Pentagon’s “deep black budget” was estimated to be as high as $1.7 trillionper year by the end of the Clinton administration in January 2001.[505][part0000_split_079.html#_edn505] To fully appreciate the significance of such avast sum, consider that the proposed Pentagon budget for 2018 was only $639billion.[506] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn506] This means that the deep blackbudget used to fund USAPs was, back in the year 2000, almost triple the entirePentagon budget today! To this startling statistic, we need to add a disquietingrecent Pentagon acknowledgement that 44,000 military personnel “can’t betracked”.[507] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn507] So where can the missing fundsand soldiers be found? The most likely answer is in USAPs taking place withinAntarctica and elsewhere.Consequently, while the U.S. and other nations conduct many open source scienceprojects in Antarctica, any of these could be covers for USAPs, but without themainstream scientists involved having any knowledge of this situation. This iscertainly the conclusion that can be drawn from the whistleblower testimony ofthe former US Navy engineer, Brian, who was warned off by the National SecurityAgency from revealing anything about the events he witnessed in Antarctica,which firmly points to highly classified projects being conducted there.According to information revealed so far in this book, there are a great numberof mysterious events occurring across the ice bound continent, at least some ofwhich are part of highly classified projects. Most disturbing is the possibilitythat a number of these classified projects may be illegal under the AntarcticTreaty, as well as violating other international and domestic laws. This iscertainly what William Tompkins and Corey Goode claim is occurring, with forcedlabor being used in hidden Antarctic bases long ago established by Nazi Germany.Therefore, ascertaining what companies are conducting activities in Antarcticawill aid greatly in determining if USAPs are taking place there, and whetherthese programs are violating the Antarctic Treaty. "},{"pageContent":"MAJOR U.S. CORPORATE CONTRACTORS BEGIN OPERATIONS IN ANTARCTICA Soon after Operation Deep Freeze established the first permanent bases in early1956, the US Navy took on the role of providing logistical support for theentire U.S. Antarctic program. Two years later, the National Science Foundation(NSF) started to award contracts to private companies in support of science andnon-military projects at Antarctica’s new U.S. stations. In 1958, the NSF beganrunning the U.S. Antarctic program, which was the umbrella for all scientificand exploratory research on the continent. ITT was among the first companiesfunded by the NSF and it established a subsidiary in 1958, ITT AntarcticServices. Based out of Colorado Springs, it was ideally located to work onUnacknowledged Special Access Programs that were part of the US Air Force’sevolving space program.[508] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn508] In chapter 2, itwas pointed out that ITT was one of the U.S. companies that worked closely withNazi Germany, and had established telecommunication and manufacturingsubsidiaries and partnerships prior to and during WWII. Given the earlyestablishment of ITT Antarctic Services, there is good reason to believe that asa result of the 1955 agreement between the Fourth Reich and the EisenhowerAdministration, ITT quickly resumed work with its former German corporatesubsidiaries and partners that were secretly operating in Antarctica.It is important to understand how the Germans handed over the lion’s share ofresponsibility for researching the ancient artifacts discovered in Antarctica tothe U.S. military-industrial complex. This occurred after agreements had finallybeen reached with the Eisenhower administration. Regarding this history ofevents, Goode writes: So after the Germans had discovered this, they started to, not really excavatefor archaeological reasons, they started to clear out areas and begin to usethem that they found. They found in cave areas ancient civilization artifacts,and they just moved them out and moved their military groups in and createdbases. So they weren't real interested in the archaeology in the beginning,which sounds not very much like the Nazis since they had archaeologists combing,you know … combing Asia looking for certain … It seemed mission was to hurry upand build this [Antarctic] base. That was the primary job … So they had beenlooking into it, doing some digs here and there, over the decades leading up towhere they ended up working with the Americans, the industrial complex,military-industrial complex. They were doing excavations all throughout thedecades going all the way back, you know, from the '50s and '60s.[509][part0000_split_079.html#_edn509] Similarly, Dr. Pete Peterson says that the U.S. discovery and excavations of thethree spacecraft found in Antarctica date to the 1950’s, however, the Germansmade the discovery first. [510] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn510]Given ITT’s historically close relationship with German corporations, thefounding of its Antarctic subsidiary in 1958, ITT’s expertise in advancedcommunications technologies, and finally, its close relationship with Reptiliansaccording to Bill Tompkins, it’s almost certain that ITT was heavily involved inthe excavations of the extraterrestrial civilization then underway inAntarctica.[511] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn511]The role of private contractors steadily increased throughout the 1960’s and1970’s as projects grew and corporate support became increasinglynecessary.[512] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn512] In 1972, the Antarctic SupportContract was established by the National Science Foundation and awarded to asole major contractor to administer all of the science and non-military projectsrun out of U.S. Antarctic stations. Defense contractors that were awarded theAntarctic Support Contract could bring in additional expertise and personnel toassist in the secret excavations that were occurring under the lead companies,such as ITT.In 1972, Holmes & Narver became the first corporate contractor for the NSFAntarctic Support Contract, which covered support services at all threepermanent, year-round, U.S. bases – McMurdo Station, Amundsen-Scott South PoleStation and Palmer Station.[513] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn513] Notably,Holmes and Narver was one of the defense contractors that worked on theManhattan Project.[514] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn514]Over the successive decades, Holmes & Narver partnered with major aerospace andengineering companies such as Raytheon and EG&G in bidding for the AntarcticSupport Contract.[515] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn515] In 2000, Holmes andNarver was absorbed by the Engineering Industrial giant, AECOM.[516][part0000_split_079.html#_edn516] Given Holmes & Narver’s involvement with the1940’s Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb, it’s fair to conclude thatthis corporation was very familiar with the security procedures governingUnacknowledged Special Access Programs. This would have encompassed the need tokeep secret the presence of an active German space program deep below theAntarctic ice, which the U.S. military-industrial complex was cooperating within a secret agreement.In 1980, ITT was awarded the next Antarctic Support Contract through itssubsidiary, ITT Antarctic Services.[517] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn517] Areport describing ITT’s support activities in the 1980-81 seasons says that ithelped 77 science projects during the summer period, and five projects duringthe winter.[518] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn518] Holding the 1980 AntarcticSupport Contract, ITT was perfectly positioned to step up its covert activitiesby awarding sub-contracts to any companies that could help in the secretexcavations. Furthermore, ITT could ensure that U.S. Antarctic scientificoperations would not negatively impact on the operational secrecy of the GermanAntarctic operations that worked closely with major U.S. defense contractors.In 1990, Holmes and Narver partnered with EG&G to form Antarctic SupportAssociates to win the NSF’s Antarctic Support Contract. [519][part0000_split_079.html#_edn519] Formed in 1947, EG&G was a major defensecontractor and worked on a range of highly classified nuclear related projects.Its “Special Projects” division was the operator of the infamous JANET Terminalat Las Vegas, which transported employees to Area 51, Nevada, where numerousUSAPs were conducted in strict secrecy.[520] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn520]Indeed, EG&G was the company that hired Bob Lazar to work at the notoriousPapoose Lake facility at Area 51 where he witnessed nine types of flying saucercraft.[521] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn521] Well versed in managing USAPs,EG&G was a logical partner to oversee similar programs in Antarctica, usingscientific projects as cover programs, as required by law. [522][part0000_split_079.html#_edn522]In 1999, Raytheon was awarded the Antarctic Support Contract by the NationalScience Foundation. Raytheon had long worked closely with the US Air Force,which had now gained control over Antarctic support operations from the US Navy.Raytheon’s Polar Services website described its main function as: Raytheon Polar Services exists specifically to meet the needs of the NationalScience Foundation (NSF) Office of Polar Programs. The main function of RPSC isto provide support to the United States Antarctic Program … which is dedicatedto sustaining the Antarctic environment and funding scientists who conductresearch in Antarctica.[523] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn523] Raytheon was first established in 1922, and has grown into a giant in theaerospace industry. In 2015, it became the 3rd largest defense contractor in theU.S., and was fifth largest in the world.[524] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn524]Here is how Raytheon describes itself on its website: Raytheon Company is a technology and innovation leader specializing in defense,civil government and cybersecurity solutions. Founded in 1922, Raytheon providesstate-of-the-art electronics, mission systems integration, capabilities in C5I(command, control, communications, computing, cyber and intelligence), sensing,effects and mission support services. Raytheon is headquartered in Waltham,Massachusetts.[525] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn525] Raytheon’s website further adds that in 2017, it employed 63,000 people andgrossed over $24 billion in sales. Raytheon regularly advertises jobs requiringemployees to have security clearances for Special Access Programs.[526][part0000_split_079.html#_edn526]Audits of Raytheon Polar Services over the calendar years of 2000 to 2004indicated that it was indeed conducting covert operations in Antarctica, asclaimed by Richard Hoagland and Mike Bara. [527][part0000_split_079.html#_edn527] The funding of covert operations was achievedthrough a black budget that Raytheon had set up, which is evidenced byirregularities found through the audits: In our opinion, the indirect cost and other direct cost system and relatedinternal controls of Raytheon Polar Services Company are inadequate. Ourexamination identified certain significant deficiencies in the design oroperation of the internal control structure. In our opinion, these deficienciescould adversely affect the organization’s ability to record, process, summarize,and report indirect and ODC costs in a manner that is consistent with applicablegovernment contract laws and regulations.[528] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn528] Despite auditing irregularities being reported as early as 2004, Raytheoncontinued to be awarded contracts to continue its support services inAntarctica, as exemplified in its April 5, 2010 Press Release announcing a oneyear extension of operations: Raytheon Polar Services has earned excellent performance ratings since 2000 asthe prime contractor to the U.S. Antarctic Program for NSF. The extension willtake the contract to March 31, 2011.\"We appreciate the opportunity to continue support for the valuable scientificresearch underway at the bottom of the world. This is a keystone program forus,\" said Sam Feola, Raytheon Polar Services program director.Raytheon Polar Services employs about 350 full-time staff and hiresapproximately 1,400 contract employees from its offices in Centennial,Colo...[529] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn529] On September 20, 2010, it was announced that Raytheon was given another one yearextension by the National Science Foundation despite auditing irregularities andcontroversy surrounding its policies.[530] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn530]Raytheon’s contract ended on March 30, 2012, after its 10 year contract wasgiven two unprecedented one year extensions.On Dec 28, 2011, it was announced that Lockheed Martin had been awarded theNational Science Foundation’s $2 billion Antarctic Support Contract. [531][part0000_split_079.html#_edn531] Lockheed Martin took over Antarctic supportoperations on April 1, 2012, for an initial contract period of 4.5 years, whichcould be extended to 8.5 years. Lockheed Martin is the world’s largest defensecontractor with 97,000 employees worldwide, and over $45 billion in governmentcontracts awarded in 2009.[532] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn532]One of the two predecessors of Lockheed Martin, the Lockheed Corporation, wasamong the U.S. companies that William Tompkins says he delivered briefingpackets to, containing information about German flying saucer developmentsduring World War II. Tompkins took the packages to Lockheed’s AdvancedDevelopment Projects (aka Skunkworks), which was created on June 1943 by thelegendary Clarence “Kelly” Johnson.[533] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn533] FromDecember 1942 to January 1946, Tompkins says that he visited Lockheed’s advancedresearch and development facilities several times.[534][part0000_split_079.html#_edn534] Significantly, Tompkins states that thebriefing packages contained information about the secret Antarctic operationsbeing conducted by the Germans. [535][part0000_split_079.html#_edn535]Furthermore, in response to a question aboutwhich U.S. corporations cooperated most closely with the Antarctica basedGermans, Tompkins’ reply included the Lockheed Corporation.[536][part0000_split_079.html#_edn536]Lockheed’s Skunkworks has long been associated the US Air Force and the CentralIntelligence Agency in building advanced aircraft at Area 51 that were highlyclassified Unacknowledged Special Access Programs.[537][part0000_split_079.html#_edn537] Indeed, declassified records show that KellyJohnson was part of the original team that picked Area 51 as a suitable locationfor conducting USAPs such as the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird.[538][part0000_split_079.html#_edn538] In his autobiography, Ben Rich describes howLockheed’s Skunk Works worked predominately on highly classified US Air Forcecontracts, and how difficult it was to work with the Navy.[539][part0000_split_079.html#_edn539]Subsequently, like its predecessors, Raytheon and EG&G (now URS), LockheedMartin had a long history in conducting USAPs. It was more than capable ofmanaging highly classified Antarctic operations, through cover programs, whichwould be funded through the Antarctic Support Contract.On August 22, 2016, the National Science Foundation announced the transfer ofthe Lockheed Martin contract to the newly reconstituted company, Leidos, as aresult of a corporate merger: Leidos Holdings, Inc. will hold the National Science Foundation’s contract forsupport of the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP). The change follows the mergerbetween Leidos and Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutionsbusiness segment as of Aug. 16. Lockheed Martin has held the contract since NSFmade the award in December 2011.[540] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn540] Leidos Holdings was formed on September 27, 2013 as a spin off from ScienceApplications International Corporation (SAIC), which had divided itself in two.SAIC had been established in 1969 by a former US Navy officer and leadingnuclear physicist, Dr. J. Robert Beyster.[541] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn541]He worked closely with the National Security Agency and the militaryintelligence community in gaining contracts for his new company, which builtsignificantly on his expertise in the nuclear energy industry.After SAIC’s 2013 corporate split, Leidos continued to specialize in SAIC’sformer work in national security and defense contracts, while the rump SAICwould retain the parent company name, and focus on information technology.[542][part0000_split_079.html#_edn542] In a $5 billion business deal, Leidospurchased Lockheed’s Information Systems & Global Solutions division, and wasnow in charge of the Antarctic Support Contract, which runs up to 2025.[543][part0000_split_079.html#_edn543] In its former incarnation as SAIC, Leidos hadacquired much experience in running Unacknowledged Special Access Programs. SAICwas involved in the development of antigravity craft for the US Air Forceaccording to the late whistleblower, Colonel Steve Wilson.[544][part0000_split_079.html#_edn544] Furthermore, SAIC had on its Board ofDirectors Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who, according to William Tompkins, was a keyfigure in developing designs for future antigravity fleets of Navy spacecraft. "},{"pageContent":"ADMIRAL BOBBY RAY INMAN & THE NSA SAIC/LEIDOS CONNECTION TO ANTARCTICA Tompkins, who worked at Douglas Aircraft Company’s Advanced Design think tankfrom 1950 to 1963, described how Inman would transmit unsolicited spacecraftdesign proposals developed at Douglas to a very high level Navy intelligencegroup of officers. In his book, Selected by Extraterrestrials, Tompkinsreferred on several occasions to Admiral Inman as a key figure in thedevelopment of unsolicited bids for the Navy to develop antigravityspacecraft.[545] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn545] In the following passage,Tompkins recalled what he was told about Inman’s role by his boss at DouglasAircraft Company, Elmer Wheaton: Now, Bill, I want you to understand that every time – since your first topsecret disseminator assignment in Naval Intelligence – you were requested tovisit or work in a classified military facility and you were never ever deniedaccess. Even admirals commanding Battle Groups in combat were denied access thatyou can just walk right into. The boy with the photographic memory was a lotmore knowledgeable about Naval space combat than them.You have been tracked by both extraterrestrials and an elite Navalintelligence-gathering operation since Commander Perry reviewed your Naval shipmodel collection documentation in 1940. You were never informed of yourassociation with the alien alliance. Nor your highest security classificationsas a contactee monitored by a small core of senior Naval officers probablychaired by Bobby Ray Inman.[546] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn546] The editor of Selected by Extraterrestrials, Dr. Robert Wood, who also worked atDouglas during Tompkins’ employment there, inserted the following note whichelaborated on Inman’s role in what occurred at the secret Douglas Think Tank: (Note from Editor Wood. My interpretation of these remarks and their chronologyis this: Elmer Wheaton had contact with the UFO-cleared group in the Navy, whichhe referred to as “Forrestal’s people” as the ones who knew about the UFOissues. One of the new young Navy officers who was cleared for the UFO topicappears to have been Bobby Ray Inman, and his inside knowledge of the UFOproblem may well have been the special link to his subsequent highly successfulcareer. Apparently Bobby Ray was the main person interacting with the Wheatonthink tank at the time of this conversation. Since Bill Tompkins’ time in thisvault spans several years, it is not really clear that this conversationoccurred in 1952 or perhaps a year or so later.)[547][part0000_split_079.html#_edn547] I spoke by phone with Admiral Inman on December 1, 2016, and he denied havingany involvement during the 1950’s and 1960’s with anything occurring at DouglasAircraft Company.[548] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn548] However, he did pointout the chronology of his Naval career, including his later involvement with theNSA and SAIC, which is significant given Tompkins’ claims. Based on hishistorical role with the intelligence community and subsequent work onUnacknowledged Special Access Programs (USAPs) with multiple corporations,Tompkins’ claims appear very plausible. This is despite Inman’s denial of havingany association with Douglas, which he was legally required to do as part of thestandard security procedures in place for USAPs.Inman said that after attending a postgraduate program in Naval Intelligence inWashington, DC in 1958, he stayed on at the Pentagon as an intelligence brieferuntil 1960, and next served on a destroyer in the Atlantic. In October 1961, heworked in a Naval office housed within the NSA until 1965. He then transferredto Hawaii (Pacific Command) where he headed Naval Intelligence until July 1967.After his Hawaii assignment, he became the Intelligence officer for the 7thFleet, from May 1969 to August 1971.In January 1974, Inman received his first star (Rear Admiral lower class) andbecame both Director of Naval Intelligence and headed the National UnderwaterReconnaissance Office, leaving these positions in July 1976. He then moved overto the Defense Intelligence Agency where he was Vice Director up to 1977, andmoved again to become Director of the National Security Agency up to 1981. Hefinally became Deputy Director of the CIA, from February 1981 to June 1982.Admiral Inman acknowledged in our phone conversation that during his navalcareer, many companies had worked for him on various contracts awarded to themby the Navy. Regarding the bidding process for naval contracts, he said that hewas involved in setting forth the requirements for a corporate bid, and thenreviewing the work done by the corporations in completing a bid.Among the companies that had bid successfully for Navy contracts was ScienceApplications International Corporation, whose Board of Directors Inman joinedafter his official retirement from government and military service in 1982.[549][part0000_split_079.html#_edn549] Inman would go on to serve for 21 years onSAIC’s Board of Directors, until retiring from it on October 1, 2003.[550][part0000_split_079.html#_edn550] This is where it is helpful to understand theclose relationship between the NSA and SAIC, which had become a revolving doorwhere senior NSA officials would become SAIC executives, and then be moved backinto more senior positions within the NSA. In his book, The Shadow Factory,James Bamford described how the revolving door between the NSA and SAICoperated: After first installing the former NSA director Bob Inman on its board, SAIC thenhired top agency official William B. Black Jr. as a vice president following hisretirement in 1997. Then Mike Hayden hired him back to be the agency’s deputydirector in 2000. Two years later SAIC won the $280 million Trailblazer contractto help develop the agency’s next generation eavesdropping architecture, whichBlack managed. Another official spinning back and forth between the company andthe agency was Samuel S. Visner. From 1997 to 2001 he was SAIC’s vice presidentfor corporate development. He then moved to Fort Meade as the NSA’s chief ofsignals intelligence programs and two years later returned as a senior vicepresident and director of SAIC’s strategic planning and business developmentwith the company’s intelligence group.[551] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn551] SAIC has long been considered to be one of the most “spook infested” companiesinvolved in highly classified programs run by the U.S. military intelligencecommunity.[552] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn552] Given what we know of theNSA’s role in silencing the Navy whistleblower Brian from speaking further abouthis Antarctic experience in 2016, it’s significant that Leidos (formerly SAIC)was awarded the Antarctic Support Contract around the same time Brian was beingintimidated into silence. This is a reflection of the historically closerelationship between Leidos, the NSA and the US Navy.When Inman was on the SAIC Board of Directors (1983-84), the corporation wasgiven a contract to conduct a meteorite study in Antarctica to better understandconditions for future Mars operations. Here is how The Antarctic Sun describedthe SAIC project: Like Antarctica, Mars is a polar desert. Without water eroding the surface, anyweathering is from wind or sun, just like the Dry Valleys, said Dean Eppler, aNASA consultant with Science Applications International Corp., who studied theweather patterns in the Valleys in 1983 and 1984 in order to better understandMars. The Dry Valleys look almost identical to photos the Viking lander sentback from Mars “right down to the rocks that are there,” Eppler said.[553][part0000_split_079.html#_edn553] It’s almost certain that the SAIC study was a cover program for a moreclassified project it was conducting, under the auspices of NASA and ITTAntarctic Services which held the Antarctic Support Contract at the time.[554][part0000_split_079.html#_edn554]At this point, it is important to recall what Joseph McMoneagle reported duringhis remote viewing session; he witnessed a Martian exodus to a volcanic area onanother world, presumably Antarctica.[555] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn555] Thesession was conducted in May 1984, the same period when SAIC was involved inMars and Antarctica research. In a 2004 lecture, McMoneagle said he was in hisfinal year of Project Stargate when his trainer, F. Holmes “Skip” Atwater,brought in the Mars coordinates. Atwater, discussing the 1984 remote viewingsession, said that the coordinates had been provided by Dr. Hal Puthoff, theDirector of the Stanford Research Institute’s remote viewing program, ProjectStargate, which formally began in 1972 with CIA funding as Project Scanate(“scan by coordinate”).[556] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn556]U.S. military intelligence involvement in Project Stargate began in 1977 as theGondola Wish program, which was undertaken by Army Intelligence and the DefenseIntelligence Agency (DIA) at Fort Meade, Maryland.[557][part0000_split_079.html#_edn557] It’s worth noting that Inman was Vice Directorof the DIA from 1976 to 1977, so it’s possible that he was aware of the efficacyof remote viewing and the formal partnership discussions then underway withSAIC.It has been documented that SAIC was one of the organizations actively studyingand using remote viewing as an intelligence gathering tool.[558][part0000_split_079.html#_edn558] Either during his time at the DIA and/or asDirector of the NSA (1977-81), and/or Deputy Director of the CIA (1981-82),Inman was certainly briefed on remote viewing and its purported accuracy. Afterjoining the SAIC Board of Directors upon his 1982 retirement, Inman thereforelikely recommended the use of remote viewing in SAIC’s classified work.Given this situation, it’s highly probable that SAIC was involved at some levelwith McMoneagle’s remote viewing session, or at the very least, learned of itsresults in order to better understand what was being excavated in Antarctica.It’s reasonable to conclude the SAIC Mars meteorite study was a cover programfor SAIC’s participation in the classified study of the remnants of the Martiancivilization buried deep under the Antarctic ice. Inman’s involvement, throughhis position on the Board of Directors, suggests that SAIC was doing far morethan merely searching for Martian meteorites on Antarctica’s icy surface.Understanding the history of SAIC in Antarctica, along with Inman’sparticipation, is important background information for understanding the 2013decision to split the company in two. By divesting itself of its non-nationalsecurity components through the 2013 corporate separation, Leidos became bettersuited to conducting its more traditional national security programs under therequired operational security protocols. Consequently, there is reason tobelieve that Leidos was encouraged or allowed to take over the Antarctic SupportContract, so it could become more involved in managing the UnacknowledgedSpecial Access Programs occurring there.Perhaps even more significant is Liedos’ historical affiliation with US Navyinterests, as opposed to Lockheed Martin’s closer historical relationship withthe US Air Force. Therefore, the shift of the Antarctic Support Contract fromLockheed Martin to Leidos may be a direct result of the US Navy’s desire toreassert its earlier authority over highly classified programs in Antarctica ascurrent events reach a critical level there. "},{"pageContent":"USE OF SLAVE LABOR IN R & D ANTARCTIC PROJECT BY TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS On July 31, 2017, Corey Goode forwarded the following Skype message to mediscussing a briefing he had just received from “Gonzales”, the alleged US NavyLt. Commander who has been Goode’s primary contact with a “Secret Space ProgramAlliance” since late 2014: Spoke to Gonzales more in depth that I have before. He told me he was onceassigned to a few of the facilities that were built during the 60's inAntarctica. He wanted me to know why the Cabal was reacting so harshly to usdisclosing the info Sigmund gave us about the R&D Facilities under the ice. Itis MUCH worse than I was first led to believe. There are literally thousands ofabducted humans down there that are being used in experiments.[559][part0000_split_079.html#_edn559] In his Skype communication, Goode also elaborated on the subject of the captivehumans used in these secret Research and Development (R&D) facilities hiddendeep below the Antarctic ice sheets: Gonzales said this was one of the parts of his service that was the hardest tocome to terms with. He said that the people working there would dehumanize thesubjects to be able to do the work. People that were not psychopaths wouldbehave like one to be able to make it through doing the work … Lots of medicaland genetic research. They test these people to death in many horrible ways ...I was told that the number went from as low as 10K to as many as 40K peoplebeing used until they are dead in these facilities that honeycomb one large areaalone … Mostly from the human slave trade.[560][part0000_split_079.html#_edn560] In his response to a question I asked about what kind of human rights violationsand experiments were occurring at secret Antarctic bases, Goode replied: “TheseR&D Bases do Nuclear, Biological and Radiation Experiments on Humans. There area number of human cloning operations going on in these and other bases.”[561][part0000_split_079.html#_edn561]This testimony by Goode may come as no surprise given what was discussed earlierin chapter 6 regarding the slave labor practices underway in Antarctica; firstimplemented by the Germans and later adopted by the U.S. military-industrialcomplex. Next, Goode went on to explain the prominent role of defensecontractors in the human rights abuses happening in Antarctica: Super sick stuff and just about all of the research being done down there bydefense contractors is beyond illegal/unethical. Scarrry shit! He [Gonzales] didsay if we stopped talking about the MIC Space Port and the R&D Facilities thatour lives would return to normal. He said it just depends on what type ofdisclosures we are willing to make.[562] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn562] Importantly, Goode is referring here to the defense contractors working onhighly classified projects in Antarctica conducting the illegal experiments andabuses. It’s worth pointing out that such systematic abuses could occur inUnacknowledged Special Access Programs (USAPs), because they prevent thenecessary independent oversight and scrutiny that would typically lead to thirdparties preventing such abuses from occurring. In the case of a waived USAP, theheads of a Congressional committee are only given a verbal briefing and have topublicly deny the existence of such programs. The U.S. Congress, therefore,fails dismally in fulfilling any kind of effective oversight role when it comesto USAPs.It is critical to emphasize here that all of the companies that have beenawarded the Antarctic Support Contract have been defense contractors with vastamounts of experience in managing USAPs. Holmes and Narver (now AECOM), ITT (nowExelis),[563] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn563] Raytheon, EG&G (now URS),Lockheed Martin, and most recently Leidos (formerly SAIC), are all thereforeimplicated in the claims that systematic human rights abuses have been occurringfor decades deep under the Antarctic ice sheets by U.S. defense contractors. In addition, according to Tompkins, companies such as Northrup Grumman andBoeing are also implicated due to their supply and delivery of personnel andresources to the Antarctic German colony for building new generations ofspacecraft. In an April 2016 interview, I asked Tompkins whether NorthrupGrumman and Boeing were building spacecraft carriers for the US Navy or for theGermans in Antarctica? He responded: That has to be both, Michael, because we send a whole bunch of people down there[Antarctica] from commercial companies here. And we have programs that we’resupposed to engineer and design. And then we have our own people back here whotry to figure out “Okay, how can we take advantage of what we learned down thereto help us make money here?” And so, then you’ll ask the question, “Okay, we canmake money here from what we learned down there and then also there may besomething that we could do commercially out there.”[564][part0000_split_079.html#_edn564] It’s important to note that none of the previously mentioned U.S. companies canbe accused of starting the abhorrent slave labor practices in Antarctica; theywere first established by the German breakaway group. This took place becausethe German companies had acquired a history of using slave labor as a result ofNazi state policy, and became very proficient in using it under Hans Kammler intheir advanced weapons projects to maintain secrecy. Kammler demonstrated duringWorld War II that secrecy was best maintained using slave labor, rather thanindigenous German workers. Therefore, in the joint Antarctic projects the use ofslave labor, rather than American workers, was very likely a “policyrequirement” imposed upon U.S. defense contractors.By virtue of the secret agreement reached under Eisenhower, U.S. companies wereinfiltrated to varying degrees, and coopted into taking the existing GermanAntarctic program to a higher level of industrial production. Regarding theextent of the infiltration of the U.S. military-industrial complex, BillTompkins stated: “The agreement that Eisenhower reached basically was that theseOperation Paperclip scientists would be allowed to get to the top of the U.S.military-industrial complex.”[565] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn565]From the mid 1950’s onward, the German Space Program’s research and developmentbecame a joint venture with the U.S. military-industrial complex. Acceptance ofthe Germans’ previously established practice of slave labor and humanexperimentation was the price to be paid for full collaboration in projects thatwere deemed essential to the development of future U.S. space programs. "},{"pageContent":"CHALLENGES IN INVESTIGATING CLAIMS OF SLAVE LABOR IN ANTARCTICA When attempting to confirm the validity of Goode and Tompkins’ testimony aboutdefense contractors being involved in advanced technology programs where slavelabor and other abuses have occurred, a number of factors arise as challenges.First, the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552) only partiallyapplies to private entities such as defense contractors. Only documentssubmitted by contractors to the U.S. military or government are subject toFreedom of Information requests. Furthermore, public requests for this categoryof documents are subject to an exemption designed to protect trade secrets: Exemption 4 protects two categories of information: (1) trade secrets and (2)commercial or financial information obtained from a person that is privileged orconfidential. Exemption 4 is unique in that it is designed to ensure theavailability and reliability of information submitted to the government byassuring submitters that their information will remain safeguarded to preventcompetitive disadvantage.[566] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn566] It’s highly doubtful that U.S. defense contractors involved in the use of slavelabor would directly report on such practices in documentary correspondence withthe contracting agency from the Department of Defense, let alone the NationalScience Foundation. It’s more likely that such abhorrent practices would becloaked behind the opaque operating procedures used in a USAP.The second challenge involves whistleblowers. There is effectively no way for acorporate employee to potentially blow the whistle on such abuses taking placewithout disclosing key details of the relevant USAP, which is illegal andcarries severe penalties. All military and corporate personnel involved in aUSAP sign a binding Non-Disclosure Agreement which stipulates the penalties forunauthorized disclosure and possession of any evidence related to the USAPsexistence. Therefore, physically possessing evidence or giving testimony of suchabuses in a USAP would constitute a violation of the Non-Disclosure Agreementsigned by the would be whistleblower, and could lead to his/her arrest andincarceration without the public ever learning the truth about the allegedabuses.Furthermore, the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act only provideswhistleblower protection to contractors or subcontractors who report fraud,waste or abuse occurring in the Department of Defense contract. Neither theNational Defense Authorization Act, nor the Whistleblower Protection EnhancementAct of 2012, provide whistleblower protection to intelligence communitycontractors. [567] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn567] This means that contractsawarded by intelligence agencies such as the National Security Agency do notprovide whistleblower protection for those wanting to report abuse if internalchannels prove non-responsive.Cases, like the one involving Brian, the Navy flight engineer, are rare. He didnot sign a non-disclosure agreement, but was debriefed after certain incidentstook place not to reveal what he had seen. Nevertheless, he courageously blewthe whistle on what he had witnessed during his 14 year career in Antarctica(1983-97). Even though Brian did not possess any evidence confirming what he hadactually seen, when he attempted to tell more details about the mysteriousevents he had seen, he was threatened into silence by the NSA. Such threattactics are consistent with how USAP’s generally maintain operational security,thus suggesting in this case that such programs were indeed occurring inAntarctica as Tompkins and Goode have claimed.When Congressman Nicholas Lehman and Dr. Rita Colwell, members of a 2002Congressional Delegation to Antarctica, [568] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn568]were questioned about the large hole at the South Pole that Brian had witnessed,neither admitted to any knowledge of it. [569] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn569]In response to further questions about classified programs in Antarctica,neither acknowledged being told anything about the existence of such programs.Third, the annual reports submitted by defense contractors that have held theAntarctic Support Contract reveal few details about the classified programs thecorporations are actually involved in. The reports primarily allude to thebusiness risk of running such programs in terms of profit margins, rather thanpossible ethical risks. For example, in its 2016 Annual Report, Leidosacknowledged its reliance on classified programs for its revenue, and also therisk this poses for investors who cannot find out what is occurring: We derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the U.S. Government thatare subject to security restrictions (classified programs), which preclude thedissemination of information that is classified for national security purposes.We are limited in our ability to provide information about these classifiedprograms, their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As aresult, investors have less insight into our classified programs than our otherbusinesses and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to ourclassified business.[570] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn570] Similarly, in its 2017 Annual Report, Exelis/Harris said: Although classified programs generally are not discussed in this Report, theoperating results relating to classified programs are included in ourConsolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the business risks associatedwith our classified programs do not differ materially from the business risksassociated with our other U.S. Government programs.[571][part0000_split_079.html#_edn571] Fourth, these primary defense contractors award sub-contracts to other companiesthat provide various support functions to both the open science program and thehighly classified programs (USAPs) occurring in Antarctica. Thus, the primarycontractor can hand over full control to a subcontractor for a particular USAP,which is then funded off the books by black budget funds funneled through theCIA to the contractor or subcontractor.[572] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn572]Finally, there are the respective roles played by NSA, the CIA and NASA in theUSAPs underway in Antarctica, which have been awarded to different defensecontractors. The NSA, as mentioned earlier in the case of Brian, was involved inmaintaining operational security for USAPs in Antarctica. Similarly, accordingto Hoagland and Bara, the NSA was involved in the classified programs set up toexplore the Lake Vostok magnetic anomaly. Consequently, the NSA has beeninstitutionally involved in maintaining secrecy over Antarctica’s USAPs, and theillegal research and development occurring there.The CIA, under the leadership of Allen Dulles, played a critical role in thenegotiations that led to the Eisenhower administration’s agreement with theGerman Antarctic Space Program. Furthermore, the CIA’s role as the U.S. entityresponsible for funneling black budget funds through different U.S. agencies,would give it significant authority in USAP operations and how these aremanaged.[573] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn573]In the case of NASA, according to Tompkins, McClelland and Goode, it wasthoroughly penetrated by German scientists who had joined the public spaceprogram, but were fifth columnists for the German Antarctic Space Program. NASAis involved in a number of open source science programs in Antarctica, such asthe meteorite collection program, which can be used to cover its involvement inUSAPs deep under the ice sheets.[574] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn574]Despite the challenges in investigating illegal research and development inAntarctica and the alleged use of slave labor there, the evidence available sofar indicates this is occurring and cannot be ignored. Thus, strategy fordealing with such illegality needs to be explored, as well as how to facilitatefull disclosure of the corporate-run space programs and Antarctica’s hiddenhistory."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 ANTARCTICA’S SUPPRESSED HISTORY & FULL DISCLOSURE Historic material examined in this book shows that immediately after the end ofWorld War I, a powerful German secret society (Thule Gesellshaft) was covertlysupported by German Navy Intelligence officials who sought to promote a numberof nationalist projects. These projects were aimed at preserving Germany’s unityand restoring its place amongst the world’s leading nations as quickly aspossible, despite the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. Amidthese nationalist projects in the early 1920’s came the support for a femalemystic, Maria Orsic, who prominent Thule Society members believed waspsychically communicating with beings from Alderbaran and/or the Inner Earth.Orsic’s psychic information appeared genuine after providing the secrets ofadvanced technologies that would make space travel possible, and also offered totransform German society by giving citizens first-hand knowledge of a mysteriousuniversal force, called Vril.The collaboration between Orsic and the Thule Society established the foundationfor the evolution of two distinct space programs in the subsequent decades. Onewas led by Orsic out of secret bases in Antarctica and South America, and taughta cosmic philosophy of peace and cooperation, which gave rise to the SpaceBrothers phenomenon in the 1950’s. The other German space program had a muchdarker vision based on unrestrained weapons development, the exploitation ofslave labor, and imperial conquest – all policies explicitly sanctioned byanother Thule protégé, Adolf Hitler.What historical records clearly show is that the Thule Society, Germanindustrialists and German Navy officials all supported Hitler’s rise to powerdue to his unfettered nationalist fervor and desire to restore Germany’smilitary power. These records indisputably show that a substantial portion ofthe funds and resources necessary for rebuilding Germany and its military camefrom U.S. companies. Prominent U.S. corporate and political figures such asHenry Ford, John Foster and Allen Dulles, John D. Rockefeller, Prescott Bush andmany others aided and abetted Hitler’s rise to power, and the subsequentrearming of Germany through international banking and investments that pouredinto Nazi Germany.This continued well into World War II, during which time President Rooseveltgranted exemptions to major U.S. companies, enabling continued trade with NaziGermany despite the “Trading with the Enemy Act”. This was also done whileturning a blind eye to the glaring fact that Nazi Germany was systematicallyusing slave labor in its industrial production facilities, some of which hadbeen built with U.S. financial resources. As the end of the war approached,deals were secretly reached which allowed the Nazis to transfer substantialfinancial resources out of the country to later be used in a secret plandeveloped by Martin Bormann to fund the rise of a Fourth Reich. Thisunconscionable process once again promised significant profits for cooperatingU.S. corporations.After the war, many of these same U.S. corporate and political figures led thesecret negotiations that brought in the remnants of Nazi Germany’s most advancedweapons projects, under Operation Paperclip, into the U.S. All of this is wellknown and established historical fact. Not so well known is the extent to whichthe Fourth Reich infiltrated and compromised the U.S. military-industrialcomplex. This took place because many U.S. and German industrialists belonged toa worldwide fraternity of societal elites, whose allegiance to one anothertranscended national affiliations. This made the establishment of multiplesecret space programs possible in the remote regions of South America andAntarctica.The first of these was the Vril Society program run by Orsic, which maintainedits benign “spiritual” vision and operations, as evidenced by the 1950’s and1960’s Space Brothers phenomenon. Orsic and other German astronauts pretended tobe extraterrestrials while meeting with many ordinary civilians in the U.S. andother countries. Orsic’s Vril Space Program hoped to seed ideas of cosmic unityand higher consciousness to help start a global revolution. They were helped byhuman-looking “Nordic” extraterrestrials and Inner Earth beings who shared thesebenevolent “service-to-other” goals.At the same time, other German Secret Society members cooperated with Reptilianextraterrestrials in setting up an aggressive imperialistic space program. Theinitial goal was world conquest, whereby the Earth’s industrial resources wouldbe devoted to building a mercenary space force that would fight alongside theReptilian’s fleets in deep space. After the failure of Hitler’s militarycampaigns, a more covert plan was initiated using the advanced flying saucertechnologies developed in Antarctica by the Fourth Reich. After the defeat ofAdmiral Byrd’s 1947 “Operation Highjump” military expedition, the Fourth Reich’sspacecraft proceeded to boldly fly over U.S. territories regularly, culminatingin the highly dramatic 1952 Washington Flyover. This critical event forced theTruman, and later Eisenhower, administrations to embark on secret peacenegotiations which effectively amounted to a negotiated surrender by 1955. Thesecret agreements with the Fourth Reich were kept a closely guarded “nationalsecurity” secret from the American and world public, while the U.S. militaryprecariously hoped to bridge the technological gap.The subsequent flow of American industrial resources into Antarctica led to asignificant expansion of the Fourth Reich’s imperial space program. It alsoenabled the establishment of yet another space program; founded in a partnershipbetween the Fourth Reich and the U.S. military-industrial complex. Thisultimately led to the creation of a transnational corporate space program calledthe Interplanetary Corporate Conglomerate. According to Corey Goode, thiscorporate space program became operational in the late 1980’s, after the launchof the US Navy’s “Solar Warden” Space Program.[575][part0000_split_079.html#_edn575] This transnational collaboration further ledto several major U.S. corporations cooperating in projects that exploited slavelabor and used human subjects in large industrial scale operations hidden deepbelow the Antarctic ice sheets. [../images/00069.jpeg]Figure 68. Evolution of Secret Space Programs Chart The establishment of parallel German space programs in Antarctica during the1940’s and 1950’s, by secret societies and leading industrialists, comprised ofa highly spiritual ethical faction (Orsic’s “Space Brothers” Program) and anaggressive imperialistic faction (Fourth Reich) who ultimately established apartnership with the U.S. military-industrial complex, are relatively recentchapters in Antarctica’s suppressed history. The presence of an ancient Martiancolony, perfectly preserved deep under the Antarctic ice since the Great Flood,and its secret excavation since 2002, represent a far older chapter ofAntarctica’s suppressed history which needs to be revealed in a genuine “fulldisclosure” initiative.Most significant is the likelihood that humanity will eventually learn of theexistence of “Pre-Adamites” or “Ancient Martians”, who may still be alive instasis chambers located in one or more extraterrestrial motherships. Thepossibility that these beings are the imprisoned “fallen angels” described inthe Book of Enoch will have enormous implications for religious scholars andhumanity in general. Predictably, this will lead to great debate over the wisdomof awakening, and/or cooperating with, such beings in the future.The first issue that arises, however, is whether the general public will beinformed in any way about the extraterrestrial element within the Antarcticaexcavations. Corey Goode describes a “limited disclosure” plan, which involvessanitizing the Antarctica archeological sites of any remains having to do withextraterrestrial life: Now, another interesting note, we do have these archaeologists and employees ofvarious universities that are down there excavating and documenting all of this,but what they have done, they being the Cabal, I guess you’ll say, they haveused these large electromagnetic submarines that I discussed earlier to take alot of archaeological items that they had found in other digs that they werekeeping suppressed from humanity, they had them in huge warehouses. [576][part0000_split_079.html#_edn576]They were taking some of these artifacts down to Antarctica and seeding them.And this one large dig that these archaeologists are going to make public. Theyare also removing any body that does not look human. [577][part0000_split_079.html#_edn577] The next step in this limited disclosure plan, according to Goode, is to slowlyreveal in a many decades long process, the existence of secret space programs: So they’re planning on giving us a sanitized disclosure, and then over time theywill disclose the Military-Industrial Complex Secret Space Program.And after they do that, they’ll say, “Oh, by the way, yeah, we’ve got thisfairly advanced Secret Space Program, and while we’ve been out to other planets,we’ve found very similar ruins as we’ve found in Antarctica.So they’re going to try to trickle the information down over decades, and notimmediately tell us about the ships they found and the high technology andnon-humans. [578] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn578] Clearly, such “limited disclosure” is unacceptable to all familiar with the truehistory of Antarctica as discussed in this book. What will prove a criticalissue for “full disclosure” to take place is uncovering the precise nature ofthe relationship between these giant Pre-Adamites and the world’s ruling elite.Are the latter the direct bloodline descendants of ancient hybrid Pre-Adamiterulers; described in the Sumerian Kings List and Manetho’s fragments of Egyptianhistory as “demigods”? Also, what is their relationship with the long-livedpre-diluvial patriarchs described in the Old Testament? The policy implicationsare enormous as we learn that many powerful secret societies, long suspected tobe the hidden rulers of the planet, may in fact be covert worshippers of “fallenangels” destined to awaken from the frozen depths of the Antarctic continent.It’s no coincidence that the Thule Society, the hidden force behind the rise ofHitler’s Third Reich, believed Aryans to be the descendants of a pre-diluvialHyperborean super race that once ruled over the Northern Hemisphere. Similarbeliefs have been shared by other secret societies within the U.S., UnitedKingdom and other nations. Their shared beliefs facilitated a close cooperationbetween secret societies and industrial elites leading up to, during, and wellafter the end of World War II. This connection is especially significant when itcomes to the evolution of the secret space program, the “InterplanetaryCorporate Conglomerate”, run by transnational corporations out of the German’sformer Antarctic bases.Furthermore, we need to consider the policy implications concerning theagreements that German secret societies entered into with Reptilianextraterrestrial’s established in Antarctica, which led to a space program thatGoode has termed the “Dark Fleet”. This German/Reptilian collaboration isalleged to involve interstellar conquest and a galactic slave trade, whichWilliam Tompkins and Goode believe is a major imperative to end. Just prior toTompkins’ surprising, if not suspicious, passing on August 21, 2017, he aptlysummarized part of the challenge that lies ahead in learning the truth aboutevents in Antarctica: Germany in World War 2 had massive underground facilities with workers that wereall slaves, and even to the extent that when the decision was made before thewar ended that the Germans were going to continue all of their extraterrestrialdevelopments on UFOs, and on every weapon system that they were building, theGermans took these production facilities to Antarctica, and they also broughttheir war slaves with them to continue their work.So now there are slaves working underneath the ground, and they still areworking underground today in Antarctica. But the slave business out there in theMilky Way is a big business, and this is happening today. It's not somethingthat happened one hundred years ago. This slavery has been going on a longtime, and needs to be stopped.[579] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn579] Goode has stated that the Dark Fleet and the Interplanetary CorporateConglomerate have become close allies and collaborated in a galactic slave tradeout of Antarctica. Major German corporations such as Siemans has been directlyinvolved in building key components for the Antarctic secret space program, andhas also been implicated in this human trafficking problem. Not only areindividuals being forcefully taken to work as slave labor in illegal researchand development programs in Antarctica, but they are also being taken off planetinto a galactic slave trade enterprise. Therefore, Antarctica has become a majorspaceport for this galactic slave trade.It’s worth pointing out that this is no accident. Albert Speer exposed that apost-World War II “peace-time” global slave economy was actually planned by theThird Reich.[580] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn580] The evidence presented inthis book lays out the trail of how the Fourth Reich covertly continued thisegregious plan not only upon this planet, but in its deep space operations aswell. The extent to which U.S. defense contractors participate in a galacticslave trade, in addition to the use of slave labor in Unacknowledged SpecialAccess Programs, is not clear. It’s likely, however, to be substantial.Even if the scenario described by Tompkins and Goode about the use of forcelabor and a galactic slave trade is only partly accurate, then they haveprovided an answer to what has happened to millions of people, the majority ofwhom are children, who mysteriously disappear every year around the world.[581][part0000_split_079.html#_edn581] The prospect of Antarctica currently beingexploited for a number of highly classified projects, run by transnationalcorporations that use slave labor, involve human experimentation, and even theestablishment of a spaceport for a galactic slave trade, is deeply disturbing.Exposing such abusive practices, and the companies and government agenciesimplicated in them, is an important first step to address a great historicinjustice. In this book, a number of German and U.S. companies that have beeninvolved in Antarctica’s secret space programs have been identified to varyingdegrees. Each company deserves serious scrutiny by stockholders, the generalpublic and appropriate investigative bodies, to find out the full extent of eachcompany’s involvement in such alleged abuses.The next logical step is to free the victims of such illegal practices andimplement a form of restorative justice, where they, their families orcommunities are aided or compensated for what the victims have endured overextended periods. “Restorative Justice” is a far older model of justice, whichseeks to address the injuries suffered by the victims of crime by theperpetrator directly negotiating with the victims, their families or communityto mutually agree upon an outcome. Restorative Justice differs from the morecommon “Retributive Justice” model used in the developed world which viewscrimes more as a violation of state sanctioned laws, thereby requiring thepunishment of perpetrators, rather than addressing the needs of victims andtheir families or communities. The difference between these two justice modelsis aptly summarized as follows by Wikipedia: Restorative justice is an approach to justice that personalizes the crime byhaving the victims and the offenders mediate a restitution agreement to thesatisfaction of each, as well as involving the community. This contrasts to morepunitive approaches where the main aim is retributive justice or to satisfyabstract legal principles.[582] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn582] The final step in addressing such a great historic injustice caused by the useof forced labor, and the creation of an off-world slave trade out of Antarctica,is to put major global reforms in place to make it impossible for transnationalcorporations to ever again perform such practices under the cloak of tradesecrets and national security. In the U.S., the security protocols in place forUnacknowledged Special Access Programs make it extremely difficult, if notimpossible, for independent parties to find out what happens in such programs,especially when they are contracted out to transnational corporations. Thereneeds to be an independent global authority with the resources and means toinvestigate what happens in corporate laboratories. Just as there currentlyexists an international regulatory body to investigate nation states suspectedof trafficking in illegal nuclear weapons or biological research, there needs toa similar global authority for investigating transnational corporations for anykind of illegal research and development.The preceding steps, along with others, will greatly aid in promoting freedomand sanctity at every level of human society, especially as our world istransformed due to incredible technological advances, along with our suppressedhistory emerging as the truth about Antarctica is revealed. Most importantly,these steps will help bring the integrity back into the global national securitysystem that has been out of balance far too long. The necessity for doing so isnot merely a moral argument, but an important national security requirement.One lesson that history clearly teaches is that a political system orcivilization, no matter how powerful it may appear at the time, will crumble ifit is out of integrity with its citizenry. Power that is exercised withoutabiding by the archetypes of “Truth and Justice” will always be perceived as aform of tyranny by its citizens, thereby weakening the political system fromwithin. History is filled with stories of failed civilizations and kingdoms thatcrumbled when the political elite did not abide by the imperatives of Truth andJustice. Most often, this occurred by the incursion of external forces, where aninvading force would step in to establish a new political system under a newflag or ideology that was welcomed by a substantial portion of the nativepopulation. More rarely, the change took place through a revolution, where theruling elite was overthrown by political dissidents intent on promoting newideas based on Truth and Justice.In the modern era, we are witnessing the gradual emergence of a global politicalsystem dominated by the world’s major nation states, who are all permanentmembers of the United Nations Security Council: U.S., Russia, China, Britain,and France. All five of these countries, along with other space faring nations,have been complicit in a global system of secrecy where they, along with majorcorporations, hide the truth about the ancient history of Antarctica, the spaceprograms first established there by Nazi Germany, and the gross injusticescurrently occurring there in highly classified programs.In the early 1990’s, Alex Collier said that he had been contacted byextraterrestrials from the Andromeda constellation who said they had arrived topreempt a galactic tyranny that would emerge 350 years in our future. TheAndromedans allegedly traced the source of this future galactic tyranny back toEarth in our present time. Collier immediately began publicly discussing theinvolvement of Draconian Reptilian extraterrestrials in human affairs, theinjustices being committed against the human populace, and the secret agreementswith national elites that made this all possible: Now, in our galaxy there are many councils. I don't know everything about allthose councils, but I do know about the Andromedan council, which is a group ofbeings from 139 different star systems that come together and discuss what isgoing on in the galaxy. It is not a political body. What they have been recentlydiscussing is the tyranny in our future, 357 years from now, because thataffects everybody. Apparently what they have done, through time travel, is thatthey have been able to figure out where the significant shift in energy occurredthat causes the tyranny 357 years in our future. They have traced it back to oursolar system, and they have been able to further track it down to Earth, Earth’smoon and Mars. Those three places. [583] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn583] If Collier’s information is accurate, it’s significant that the Earth, Moon andMars are all identified as sources of a future galactic tryanny. Mars and theMoon in particular are locations where the Fourth Reich’s Secret Space Program,along with the transnational “Interplanetary Corporate Program”, haveestablished a powerful presence. In particular, Martian industrial coloniesallegedly produce advanced technologies for up to 900 different extraterrestrialcivilizations.[584] [part0000_split_079.html#_edn584] Antarctica’s hiddenspaceports are the primary location connecting Earth, the Moon and Mars insecret space programs that might constitute a future global/galactic threat.Based on the information presented in the preceding chapters, I firmly believethat events in Antarctica constitute a form of cancerous growth that can quicklyevolve into a global tyranny, which could conceivably evolve further into thegalactic tyranny that Collier warned about. Hidden Antarctica bases using slavelabor can easily morph into a global phenomenon if left unchecked. Such tyrannywould eventually weaken the integrity of the planet’s political systems, therebyinviting either an external invasion by extraterrestrials posing as globalliberators, or a popular revolution where “full disclosure” becomes the sloganfor a new global system based on greater Truth and Justice for all. Therefore,as a matter of national and global security, it is vitally important that thetruth about Antarctica be exposed in order to prevent the growth of the unjustpractices occurring there, which could potentially morph into a cancerous growthdevastating the entire global body politic.It is also possible that the truth about Antarctica will be revealed as aninevitable byproduct from natural geological processes. As described in chapter12, Antarctica’s buried and submerged volcanoes are heating up west Antarctica,leading to dramatic melting of the ice shelves. Not only will such heating leadto Antarctica’s hidden history and corporate run space program being eventuallyexposed for all the world to see; but may, more disturbingly, lead to a PoleShift. It would be truly ironic if the exposure of these long-buried secretsproves to be the precise information needed for humanity to escape thecataclysmic effects of a Pole Shift.Antarctica is a land of enormous size, mystery and challenges. Once the truthabout what has transpired there in the remote past and more recently becomesopenly known, Antarctica will have the potential to awaken humanity from a deep,deep slumber, caused by the willful suppression of our true history. Fulldisclosure of Antarctica’s history, and current events involving multiple spaceprograms and transnational corporations, will help tremendously in transformingour planet in ways that both startles the imagination and opens up the door forhumanity to become a fully liberated member of our greater galactic community."},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHOR Dr. Michael Salla is an internationally recognized scholar in global politics,conflict resolution and U.S. foreign policy.
