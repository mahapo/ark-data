Purgatorio presents some challengesdifferent from those encountered in Inferno, but we have again attempted to giveas accurate a sense of the poetry and meaning of the Italian text as Englishallows. The language and style of this part of the poem is, in many respects,different from that to which we have become accustomed in the previous cantica.The “harsh and rasping” verse (Inf. XXXII.1) used to describe in particular thebottom reaches of hell is mainly lacking here, for the most part replaced by amore harmonious tone and diction. And the themes we encounter now are by andlarge quite different, as, entering the realm of the saved, we might expect. Weneed but think of the opening images of sunlight (unseen in Inferno), of thesense of divine grace operating before our eyes, of the fraternal love thatreplaces the hatred found in hell, of the light of the stars, of the singing sooften heard and the smiling so often seen in this place, and, in general, of thetheological virtue of hope (and its color, green), missing in even the best partof hell, Limbo (where, in Virgil’s words, “without hope we live in longing”[Inf. IV.42]).At the same time, things are not entirely different. The pain undergone by thepenitents, it is true, is suffered to a joyous purpose, as Forese Donati makesplain: “I speak of pain but should say solace” (Purg. XXIII.72). Nonetheless, inform it is much as that suffered by the damned; all of these souls, too, havetheir contrapasso (Inf. XXVIII.142), the punishment that fits their crime, andit functions just as it did in hell, either by mirroring the sin it punishes (asin the choking smoke of wrath) or by being its opposite (as in upward-surgingpride being crushed beneath a heavy burden). Also similar to those we found inInferno are the narratives told by former sinners. The attitudes of thesespeakers and the resolutions of their lives are vastly different (we mightcompare Francesca [Inf. V] and Pia de’ Tolomei [Purg. V], as many in fact do);however, the way in which their stories are presented is essentially the same,brief narratives, perhaps best considered Ovidian in origin, of the definingmoment in a person’s life. Perhaps no other feature of the Comedy is asreflective of the poetic essence of Dantean art as this one, as Robert Browningrealized when he wrote his series of Dantesque monologues.While surely we must acknowledge that Inferno and Purgatorio are very differentpoetic places, they nonetheless maintain some arrestingly similar elements. Fromthe vantage point of Paradiso the second canticle looks much more like itspredecessor than like its successor. But that is another story.We are grateful to two friends born in Italy and born to Dante for theirwillingness to sample our translations and my comments with a knowing eye.Margherita Frankel, formerly a professor of Italian at New York University, washer usual careful and exacting self as she examined our materials.

Thus the current American slang use of the term to indicate anexperience of harsh punishment—as though it were hell—is not a useful indicatorof what the reader will find in the second part of Dante’s Comedy. In thatworld, to come to purgatory is to arrive at the threshold of heaven, and toarrive there in a state of grace.The idea of purgation has a far longer history as a concept than as a name for aplace. Le Goff1 [part0008.html#note1a] finds the first use of the nounPurgatorium in a sermon of Petrus Comestor written between 1170 and 1180.Several biblical texts, however, combine to make two notions central: IIMaccabees 12:39–45 suggests the efficacy of prayer for the dead, while Matthew(5:25–26, as well as 12:31–32) and Paul (I Corinthians 3:10–17) present at leasta general sense of expiation postmortem.2 [part0008.html#note2a] In Paul’s words(3:13), “Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it,because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work ofwhat sort it is.” Thus the purgatorial refining fire lay ready for laterChristian thinkers as a way of conceptualizing the salvation of souls after thedeath of the body. This process bridges the time between death and the LastJudgment, a period that essentially remains a lacuna in the Bible itself. ByDante’s time, theologians who attempted to deal with the lack of definition ofthe precise nature of “particular judgment,” that is God’s judgment of theindividual soul upon the death of the body, realized that they needed toestablish the nature of the divine decision that separated sinners from thesaved immediately after death, since the Bible only posits the final judgment asdescribed in the Book of Revelation. And once posthumous expiation and theprayers of the living became the crucial facts that clarify, for believers, boththeir own hopes and their responsibility with regard to their loved ones, it wasalmost inevitable that someone should invent a physical place in which thisexpiation of the souls of the dead might occur.Adding to the store of images for the development of a place to be known as“purgatory” are a series of visions of the otherworld, studied by such scholarsas Rajna,3 [part0008.html#note3a] Le Goff, and Morgan.4 [part0008.html#note4a]Le Goff demonstrates the lateness of the development of purgatory as a distinctplace, beginning perhaps with Petrus Comestor and St. Bernard ca. 1170–80,5[part0008.html#note5a] and underlines the major role of Dante in establishingthe later sense of the place and of its function.6 [part0008.html#note6a]Cherchi7 [part0008.html#note7a] has shown that, among these writers, Gervase ofTillbury in particular presented a separate world of purgation that had a numberof salient points in common with Dante’s and which may have in fact suggestedthemselves to the poet, either because Dante knew his work (Otia imperialia, ca.1210) or was acquainted with its tradition through other sources.It is fair to say that by the thirteenth century Christian thinkers were readyto accept the idea that heaven and hell were not the only otherworldly kingdoms.Le Goff reminds us that, in a sermon in the early thirteenth century, no less apersonage of the Church than Pope Innocent III referred to the realm ofpurgatory and that the Council of Lyons in 1274 called on Christians to believein its existence. Such understandings surely lie behind Dante’s: “Now I shallsing the second kingdom, / there where the soul of man is cleansed, / madeworthy to ascend to heaven” (Purg. I.4–6). Dante’s “second realm” thus accordedwith the emerging general sense of exactly how the soul may increase itsworthiness between death and the Last Judgment. (While Catholic doctrine allowsthat those who never actively sinned will bypass purgatory for direct access toparadise, Dante does not deal directly with this question; nonetheless, it seemslikely that he shared this view.) We should recognize Dante’s originality insetting the mount of purgatory at the antipodes of Jerusalem, the uniquelandmass in the southern hemisphere and the site of the birth of humankind. Weshould also be aware of his involvement in a search common to all Christians foran understanding of the nature of the soul’s life between death and Judgment.Whether or not he may have been prompted, as D’Ovidio believed, by a passage inthe Aeneid (VI.567–569), in which Rhadamanthus exacts confession of crimes fromanyone who has delayed atonement until the final hours of life,8[part0008.html#note8a] it seems clear that Dante is essentially responding toChristian formulations of the soul’s pre-eternal afterlife. What is perhaps mostsurprising is that this lone poet’s imagination of what this place must looklike and how it functions simply became the standard source of information aboutpurgation for many who thought of it after. Purgatory has many creators; itsdefinitive shape, as most ordinary Christians eventually came to think of it, isessentially Dantean.(2) Ante-purgatory.Dante’s second cantica (we will learn that name for each of the three parts ofthe work only at Purg. XXXIII.140, a few lines before the second canticle’sconclusion) is divided into three large pieces: ante-purgatory (Cantos I–IX),purgatory proper (Cantos X–XXVII), and the earthly paradise (CantosXXVIII–XXXIII). If the second of these has a tradition that predates Dante, thefirst is essentially his own creation.In Dante’s hands, the process of purgation presupposes the notion that somesouls may have come farther along on the road to final penance than others, aswe learn almost immediately from a comparison of the first two souls we meet whoare involved in active purgation, Omberto Aldobrandesco and Oderisi d’Agobbio.It may seem surprising that Oderisi is less afflicted by Pride than Omberto,9[part0008.html#note9a] even though he had died some forty years after him andthus had not been purging his pride as long as his companion. However,ante-purgatory itself is based upon a similar conception, one that may have beenunique to Dante. While all the saved are, in some real sense, equally exalted(none of them wants more of heavenly bliss than he or she experiences, as we aretold by Piccarda Donati),10 [part0008.html#note10a] their souls are in highlyvaried states of purification as they enter the afterworld. Indeed, some of themare not yet ready even to begin the process of repentance. And thus Dante has,as far as we can tell, invented this place of “prepurgation.” His decision to doso reflects the notion that some saved sinners were less fully worthy thanothers and had to spend time on the lower slope of the mountain in order to makeup for either of two conditions that impeded their freeing themselves from sin.The first of these groups gathers together the excommunicate, who must spendthirtyfold the amount of time that they were excommunicated in punishment forthe insubordination that brought about their severance from the Church. Dante,however, gives back with the other hand what he has taken away with the first.We cannot imagine that many prelates would have acceded to the idea that anyonewho had died under the ban of excommunication could possibly be saved. And thatthe first saved soul we meet after Cato of Utica (whose salvation remains ashock to readers even to this day) is that of the excommunicated, lecherous,murderous Manfred reminds us that Dante is not one readily to be swayed byecclesiastical (or any other) authority. And Manfred is not here alone, but asthe leader of a flock of other excommunicated souls, and the Christian image ofa flock of sheep (Purg. III.79–87) that presents Manfred and his fellows itselfstands as a reproof of the certainty of certain churchmen—including popes—in thejustness of their judgments. Further, we learn from Manfred himself (at Purg.III.140–145) a crucial law of all of purgatory, that prayer from those stillalive and in God’s grace may reduce a soul’s time in purgatory. The efficacy ofprayer is thus another potential gift bestowed upon reformed sinners.The second group in ante-purgatory includes all those who were saved despite thebelatedness of their repentance. Their period of purgation is thirty times lessonerous than that of the excommunicate, a single unit of time for each that theywere behindhand on earth, moment for moment, year for year. These souls arethemselves divided into three categories: those who were sluggish in theirdevotion to God; those who died unabsolved; and those who—and the largest grouphere involves negligent rulers—loved the world too much. Once again Dante isessentially relying on his own authority in the creation of this zone for hispoem. And, as though the creation of ante-purgatory were not invention enough,Dante has added another area to purgatory, one even less potentially licensed bythe Church, a sort of pre-ante-purgatory alluded to in the second canto. FromCasella we learn (Purg. II.94–105) that there is a “staging area” somewhere nearOstia, the seaport of Rome, where saved souls gather before they are selected,with some having to wait their turn longer than others, for their journeythrough the Gates of Hercules across the seas to the huge mountain-island thatstands, the highest point on earth, at the antipodes of Jerusalem.(3) Purgatory.The mountain’s seven terraces reflect the tradition of the seven capital vices,also referred to as “mortal sins,” or “deadly sins.”11 [part0008.html#note11a]Pride, Envy, Wrath, Sloth, Avarice (and, in at least one case, Prodigality),Gluttony, Lust: these supply the seven terraces with their crowds. All terracesinclude the following features, mainly in the same order, as though part of aliturgical ritual for this churchlike place: (1) description of the physicalaspect of the terrace, (2) exemplars of the virtue that counters the sinrepented here, (3) description of the penitents, (4) recitation of their sins byparticular penitents, (5) exemplars of the vice, (6) appearance to Dante of theangel representing the countering virtue. However, not only are there somesubtle shifts and changes in the ordering of these elements, but there seems tobe an individuated program of involvement for the protagonist. On four of theterraces he is untouched by the physical elements of penitence: he observes theenvious, the slothful, the avaricious, and the gluttons without feeling theirpain directly. However, among the prideful he himself bends down alongside them,thereby experiencing some of their condition; the smoke of Wrath stings hiseyes, not only those of the penitents; and the flames of Lust burn him. Are weto understand that these sins are significantly his? Perhaps so. He is explicitabout his pridefulness while claiming the merest touch of envious behavior(Purg. XIII.133–138), but those two other details—the blinding smoke and theafflicting flames—may associate him with Wrath and Lust, as what we know of hislife and personality would lead us to believe.Dante uses exemplary figures to represent both the virtue that directly opposesthe vice repented and, ultimately, as exempla of the vice itself, the second atechnique we are familiar with from Inferno. Thus the penitents are at firstencouraged to love virtue and finally forced to confront the shame of theirformer vice. As Wenzel12 [part0008.html#note12a] and Delcorno13[part0008.html#note13a] have established, Dante is heavily indebted to thewritings of Peraldus on exemplary figures drawn from biblical texts.14[part0008.html#note14a] This middle part of the canticle is the locus of thepoem most dedicated to the use of exemplification, a technique of representationassociated with ecclesiastical instruction and broadened by Dante to includeclassical literature and art.The experience of purgation centers on a ritual performance of the final act ofthe sacrament of confession,15 [part0008.html#note15a] the giving ofsatisfaction on the part of the penitent sinner, the satisfactio operis(satisfaction by works) that alone may lead to absolution. It is of course truethat each sinner who is saved has already, in one way or another, made amends toGod for his former sinfulness. Salvation is certainly to be understood asimpossible without that. Yet it would seem that Dante considered some amendmentas having been tentative (thus accounting for such things as delays at Ostia andstays in ante-purgatory). In any case, the only souls who would seem to beexempt from atonement now are those who were utterly untouched by a given sinand thus do not need to purge themselves on that particular terrace. Anindividual’s presence in penitence on any terrace indicates that person’s needto proceed in an act of self-reproach, reflecting the contrition and confessionthat marked his or her freedom from sin on earth, as well as the words spoken toGod’s priest in promise of good works to come. And it seems to be only this lastelement that requires urgent attention here on the seven-storied mountain.Perhaps one way to think of this is that the offer of satisfaction, at least forsome sinners, was more of a promise than an accomplishment, and that, for suchas them, purgatory offers the opportunity for the fulfillment of that promise.Unlike the denizens of Inferno and Paradiso, those in Purgatorio exist in real,present time. Inhabitants of the other two cantiche are in their eternalcondition with one major exception: in both realms souls will receive theirbodies to wear for eternity only at the Last Judgment. They are aware of time,but do not act in it (and those in hell are denied knowledge of the present—seeInf. X.97–108). All in ante-purgatory or purgatory are timebound16[part0008.html#note16a] until such time as their penance is completed. Thisaccounts for the leisurely sense—they are passing the time—we find in thecharacters in ante-purgatory, awaiting their turn for expiation, as well as forthe intense and concentrated effort we observe in all those who are in activepurgation higher up the mountain, pressing against the limits of time in theirurgency.At the core of this theological epic lies insistence on the free will’sdirecting itself to the proper form of love. That will be the subject of thespeeches of Marco the Lombard and of Virgil in the sixteenth and seventeenthcantos of this cantica. Our natural goodness, mirrored in our loving natures, iseasily diverted from praiseworthy objects of affection. It is here in purgatorythat the free will rediscovers its better affections.(4) The Earthly Paradise.Once Dante’s will “is free, upright, and sound” (Purg. XXVII.140), he is allowedto enter the sacred space “chosen for mankind as its nest” (Purg. XXVIII.78).The long process that accounts for the correction (initiated in the openingcantos of Inferno) and perfection of his will (announced by Virgil in theclosing lines of the previous canto) is finally complete. The rest of the poemwill have, at its dramatic center, the correction and perfection of hisintellect,17 [part0008.html#note17a] overseen by Beatrice and finally by St.Bernard. How much his intellect is in need of correction is immediately madeclear by his failure to understand the kind of affection offered by Matelda,who, as a modern Leah, represents the active life of virtue, but is misconstruedby the protagonist, who frames her offer of brotherly love in inappropriatelycarnal terms.The climax of Purgatorio and, for many readers, of the entire poem occurs in thethirtieth canto when Beatrice, whose presence has been anticipated from thesecond canto of Inferno onward, finally appears. This scene seems to have beenprepared as a kind of prothalamium, the preparation for a ceremony of marriage.But instead of preceding a wedding, it heralds a dressing down of the harshestkind. And now it is the living Dante’s turn to do some urgent ritual purging ofhis sins, involving the rite of confession, contrition, and satisfaction. It isonly then, having owned up to his sins against Beatrice (the nature of theseremains less than clear to most readers, but they seem to have involved bothsexual and intellectual transgressions), that he is allowed to proceed, underthe guidance of the mysterious Matelda, toward his ritual absolution, which isaccomplished in the final lines of the final canto of the poem called Purgatory.In this place where “the root of humankind was innocent” (Purg. XXVIII.142),Dante has regained his own lost innocence and is only now prepared to ascend tothe stars.(5) Measurement of Time in Purgatorio.The opening of this three-part poem shows us its protagonist, lost in sin,coming back to his senses on a Thursday night in late March or early April ofthe year 1300. He began his descent, led by Virgil, twenty-four hours later, onFriday evening. The journey to the depths of Inferno takes exactly twenty-fourhours, while the ascent back to the surface of the earth requires still anotherfull day. The travelers thus arrive at the shore of purgatory at 6 PM on Sunday,Jerusalem time, or at 6 AM as time is reckoned at the antipodes. Telling thetime in the heavenly regions of Paradiso is a less certain enterprise. The poetand his new guide, Beatrice, depart from the earthly paradise at noon of thefollowing Wednesday and seem to spend, as we reckon time on earth, some thirtyhours traversing the heavens, with the implicit return to this world occurringroughly one week after the scene in the dark wood with which this theologicalepic began. Time in purgatory, on the other hand, is frequently measured withelaborate precision.In the fourteenth century the day was divided into readily remembered largeperiods, which may seem arbitrary to modern readers equipped with chronometersthat are precise to the second. Dawn arrives at 6 AM; “tierce” is the third hourof the day, or 9 AM; the “sixth hour” is noon; “nones,” the ninth hour, falls at3 PM; the hour of Vespers arrives with the declining sun, between 3 PM and 6 PM(depending on the season); and evening arrives at 6 PM. Most of Dante’s timeindications are based on these convenient units.The opening scene is played against the backdrop of the rising sun of EasterSunday. In Canto III the early hours of morning brighten the landscape as thepoets begin to climb. The meeting with Manfred is over by about 9 AM (Purg.III.15–16) and that with Belacqua at noon (IV.137–139). Virgil’s conversationwith Sordello concludes as the sun is moving downward, i.e., after 3 PM(VII.43). It is sunset in the Valley of the Princes (VIII.1–3) and 8:30 PM whenDante falls asleep. His dream occurs just before the dawn of Monday (IX.13) andhe awakens just after 8 AM (IX.44). He and Virgil set out upon the first terracea little after 9 AM (X.14–15) and reach the stairway to the second at noon(XII.81). They reach the third terrace at 3 PM (XV.1–6) and leave it just afternightfall (XVII.70–72). Their stay on the fourth terrace (Sloth) includes timefor Virgil’s lengthy discourse on love, which concludes at midnight(XVIII.76–78). Dante’s second night’s sleep and his second dream also occur onthis terrace, the latter just before Tuesday’s dawn (XIX.1–6). The dream isended in the light of the sun, in which the two poets make their way toward thefifth terrace (XIX.38–39), where they stay, witnesses to Statius’s completion ofhis purgation, until after ten o’clock (XXII.115–120). Since they reach thestairway to the seventh terrace at 2 PM (XXV.1–3), we realize that they havespent four hours among the penitents of Gluttony. Their stay on the seventh andfinal terrace (Lust) lasts approximately four hours as well, since the sun issetting (XXVII.61–68) as they leave it. They spend their final night inpurgatory on the steps between the final terrace and the garden of Eden. It ison these steps that Dante has his third dream, again just before dawn, onWednesday morning; he awakens with the dawn (XXVII.109). It is noon(XXXIII.103–105) as the description of the events observed in the garden of Edencomes to a close.Robert Hollander Tortola, 2 February 2002--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.

We drew closer until we reached a place where what at first had seemed a gap,75 [part0017.html#c09-s25-i]75 [part0017.html#c09-s25-i] a breach that rends a wall, I now saw was a gate, with three steps leading up to it, each one of a different color.78 [part0017.html#c09-s26-i]78 [part0017.html#c09-s26-i] The keeper of that gate as yet said not aword.

The first step →[part0024.html#c09-n023] → [part0024.html#c09-n024] was of clear white marble, so polished96 [part0017.html#c09-s32-i]96 [part0017.html#c09-s32-i] that my image was reflected in truelikeness.

The third, resting its heavy mass above, →[part0024.html#c09-n026] seemed to me porphyry, as flaming red102 [part0017.html#c09-s34-i]102 [part0017.html#c09-s34-i] as blood that spurts out from a vein.

Up the three steps my leader drew me and I was glad for that. Then he said:108 [part0017.html#c09-s36-i]108 [part0017.html#c09-s36-i] ‘Humbly petition him to slide the bolt.’ Devoutly I cast myself down at his holy feet. →[part0024.html#c09-n028] I begged him for mercy and to let me enter,111 [part0017.html#c09-s37-i]111 [part0017.html#c09-s37-i] but first, three times, I smote mybreast. → [part0024.html#c09-n029] With the point of his sword he traced seven P’s →[part0024.html#c09-n030] upon my forehead, then said: ‘Once you are inside,114 [part0017.html#c09-s38-i]114 [part0017.html#c09-s38-i] see that you wash away these wounds.’ →[part0024.html#c09-n031] Ashes or earth, when it is dug up dry, →[part0024.html#c09-n032] would be the very color of his vestments.117 [part0017.html#c09-s39-i]117 [part0017.html#c09-s39-i] Out from under them he drew two keys, →[part0024.html#c09-n033] one of gold, the other one of silver. He touched the door, first with the white,120 [part0017.html#c09-s40-i]120 [part0017.html#c09-s40-i] then the yellow, and thus my wish wassatisfied. ‘Any time one of these keys should fail so that it does not turn inside the lock,’123 [part0017.html#c09-s41-i]123 [part0017.html#c09-s41-i] he said to us, ‘this portal does not open. ‘One is more precious, but the other one requires much skill and understanding before it will unlock,126 [part0017.html#c09-s42-i]126 [part0017.html#c09-s42-i] for it is this one that unties the knot. ‘From Peter do I hold them, and his instruction was to err in opening rather than in keeping locked,129 [part0017.html#c09-s43-i]129 [part0017.html#c09-s43-i] if but the soul fall prostrate at myfeet.’ Then he pushed one door of the sacred portal open, saying: ‘Enter, but I warn you → [part0024.html#c09-n034]132 [part0017.html#c09-s44-i]132 [part0017.html#c09-s44-i] he who looks back must then returnoutside.’ And when the hinges of that sacred door, →[part0024.html#c09-n035] which are of heavy and resounding metal, →[part0024.html#c09-n036]135 [part0017.html#c09-s45-i]135 [part0017.html#c09-s45-i] were turning in their linchpins, the Tarpeian rock roared not so loud nor proved so strident when good Metellus138 [part0017.html#c09-s46-i]138 [part0017.html#c09-s46-i] was drawn away and it was then left bare.

One would have sworn he was saying: ‘Ave,’ for she as well was pictured there42 [part0017.html#c10-s14-i]42 [part0017.html#c10-s14-i] who turned the key to love on high. And in her attitude imprinted were the words: ‘Ecce ancilla Dei’45 [part0017.html#c10-s15-i]45 [part0017.html#c10-s15-i] as clearly as a figure stamped in wax. ‘Do not fix your mind on one part only,’ →[part0024.html#c10-n008] said the kind master, who had me48 [part0017.html#c10-s16-i]48 [part0017.html#c10-s16-i] on that side of him where we have ourhearts. At that I turned my face and, looking beyond Mary, saw,51 [part0017.html#c10-s17-i]51 [part0017.html#c10-s17-i] on the same side as he that prompted me, another story set into the rock. I went past Virgil and drew near54 [part0017.html#c10-s18-i]54 [part0017.html#c10-s18-i] so that my eyes might better take it in. There, carved into the marble, were the cart →[part0024.html#c10-n009] and oxen, drawing the sacred ark that makes men fear →[part0024.html#c10-n010]57 [part0017.html#c10-s19-i]57 [part0017.html#c10-s19-i] to assume an office not entrusted tothem.

I moved some steps from where I stood to look more closely at another story72 [part0017.html#c10-s24-i]72 [part0017.html#c10-s24-i] that I saw gleaming white beyond Michal.

[part0009.html#c01-s1-e] The opening metaphor of the new cantica relieson a topos familiar from classical poetry and medieval reformulations (seeCurt.1948.1, pp. 128–30) that tie the ingenium (genius) of the poet, treatinghis material, to the voyage of a ship over difficult waters. Dante’s ship, fornow, is a small one (but cf. Par. II.1–3, where it is implicitly a much largervessel), raising its sails over better (“smoother”) “water” than it traversed inhell. While this metaphor will be important in Paradiso (II.1–18; XXXIII.94–96),framing that cantica and representing the voyage as a whole, it was onlyimplicit in Inferno (as at Inf. I.22–24). Once again we see Dante addingelements retroactively as the poem advances; we are now asked to understand thatit has been, in metaphor, a ship all along, that hell is to be understood as a“sea” in retrospect.

There is no longer a possibility, among the spirits whom we shall meet,of damnation. Thus two-thirds of the Commedia, its final two cantiche, arededicated to the saved, first in potentia, then in re.The words that reflect the presence of the poet derive generically fromclassical poetry and perhaps specifically from the opening line of the Aeneid,“Arma virumque cano” (Arms and the man I sing). Dante presents himself as asinger of a kingdom, as other classical and medieval poets identified themselvesby the realms that they celebrated, the “matter of Troy,” or the “matter ofFrance,” etc. But his “kingdom” is not of this world, and no one has, at leastin Dante’s view, ever “sung” this kingdom before. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s2-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c01-s2-i]]7–12. [part0009.html#c01-s3-e] The third invocation of the poem now adds theattribute “holy” to the Muses (who were unadorned “Muses” at Inf. II.7 and“those ladies” at Inf. XXXII.10), implying that the art of this part of theComedy must keep a more religious sense to its poeticizing, since its subjectfrom here on is salvation. Most commentators identify Calliope as the ninth andgreatest (as representative of epic poetry) of the Muses. Dante surely was awareof her being summoned both by Virgil (Aen. IX.525) and by Ovid (Metam.V.338–340), the last as a part of the lengthy tale of the gods’ revenge on thenine daughters of Pierus, who, in their presumption, imagined themselves bettersingers than the Muses themselves and challenged them to a vocal contest.Unwisely, they chose to sing of the rebellion of the giants (see Inf.XXXI.91–96); the Muses sang of the goodness of goddesses (Ceres and Proserpina).In Ovid’s world of divine assertion and vengeance, it is not difficult toimagine who won. The nine girls were turned into raucous-sounding magpies.Identifying himself with the pious Calliope, Dante, fully aware of his potentialpresumption in singing the world of God’s justice, makes a gesture of humility.That precarious balance that a poet of divine revelation must manage is neverfar from his (or our) concern. It will return as an even more evident andcentral concern at Purg. XI.91–108. (For discussion of Dante’s invocations seenote to Inf. II.7–9.)Calliope is asked to rise up somewhat more than her eight sisters, perhapsindicating her slight superiority to them or the relative higher poetic level ofPurgatorio to that of Inferno (yet not as high as that of the cantica still tocome).The words morta poesì in verse 7 continue to cause occasional puzzlement. Dothey mean “dead poetry” (i.e., poetry that had died with the ancients and now ismaking a return under the pen of Dante)? Or does it mean “poetry of the dead”(i.e., poetry concerned with the souls of the damned)? The commentary traditionis enlightening. All the earliest commentators supported the secondinterpretation. It was only among “prehumanist” commentators and those who wrotein the Renaissance (e.g., Pietro di Dante, Benvenuto da Imola, Vellutello) thata “humanist” reading is found, one that selects the first alternative. From theeighteenth century on nearly every commentator prefers the reading found in ourtranslation: Dante’s poetry will rise from the subject of damned souls to singthose of the saved. But for recent support of the “humanist” reading seeBalducci (Bald.1999.3), p. 13. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s3-e] /Italian [part0016.html#c01-s3-i]]13. [part0009.html#c01-s5-e] The exordium and invocation combined, what wewould call the introduction to this cantica, occupy a mere twelve lines, wherein Paradiso they require thirty-six. The narrative begins with two noun phrases(dolce color and orïental zaffiro [sweet color, oriental sapphire]) that wewould not expect to find in a description of anything seen in hell. This part ofGod’s kingdom, for all the pain of penance put forward in it, is a brighter,happier place. Cioffi (Ciof.1985.1) argues for a biblical source of Dante’sgemstone (Exodus 24:10): the paved sapphire beneath the feet of God when Mosesand the seventy elders look upon Him.For the sapphire in medieval gemology, see Levavasseur (Leva.1954.1), pp. 57–59,indicating the stone’s usual association with the Virgin.

[part0009.html#c01-s5-e] The word mezzo here has caused some problems.It would seem to mean the air between the lunar sphere and earth, that is, the“middle zone” between the first (lunar) celestial sphere and the surface of theearth. For Dante’s own words to this effect see Convivio III.ix.12. [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c01-s5-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c01-s5-i]]19–21. [part0009.html#c01-s7-e] The planet is Venus, whose astral influence“emboldens love.” The rest of the tercet makes clear what sort of love: herbrightness is veiling, as the dawn nears, the constellation Pisces (the fish wasone of early Christianity’s most frequent symbols for Christ, who asked hisdisciples to become “fishers of men” [Matthew 4:19]). Further, she is making theeast seem to smile by her beauty, the east in which the sun is about to appear,a second reference to one of the constant images for Christ, the rising sun.This tercet has caused consternation in some readers ever since scholarsunderstood that in the spring of 1300 Venus was not the morning star, inconjunction with Pisces, but the evening star, in conjunction with Taurus. Forone way to resolve this difficulty see Hollander (Holl.2001.1), p. 196:“Emmanuel Poulle’s article ‘Profacio’ (ED IV, p. 693) sketches out, withbibliographical indications, the central position of his study of the problem:Dante took his star charts from the Almanach of Prophacius Judaeus (ca.1236–1304). The astronomical data found in the poem correspond only to thestars’ positions during the dates 25 March–2 April 1301. If Poulle is right,Dante has privileged those dates in the calendar. As for 1301, it isinconceivable that the reader is supposed to believe that the date within thepoem is other than 1300. However, if Dante was using Profacius’s work, the starcharts for 1300 fail to include data for the Sun and for Venus; Dante foundMarch dates for them only in the charts for 1301. Since it took 700 years forsomeone to catch him out, we might surmise that, rather than calculate themissing data himself, he simply appropriated the charts for 1301 to his use.”For the countering view that we are to understand that the actual date of thevoyage is 1301 see Ceri (Ceri.2000.1), restating and refining his variousprevious insistences on this redating.Moore’s discussion of the problem (Moor.1917.1), pp. 276–79, is based on thepossibility that Dante misread the data in the Almanach and actually believedthat Venus had been in Pisces in 1300. Moore’s argument is somewhat weakened byhis view that the action of the poem began on 8 April rather than 25 March (seenote to Inf. I.1). Nonetheless, his conclusion, that the internal date of thevision is 1300, remains difficult to disprove (see Moor.1903.1, pp. 144–77).[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s7-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c01-s7-i]]22–24. [part0009.html#c01-s8-e] Turning to face the south, even though he isat the antipodes, whence every direction is up, Dante looks at the heavens overthe southern hemisphere and sees four stars not seen before except by Adam andEve. Various other explanations of the prima gente (those first on earth) havebeen offered, the main one being that they were the inhabitants of the classicalGolden Age. However, if one has to be in this spot to see these four stars, theonly people ever to see them were, in consequence, the first two human souls,for once they fell from grace, they (mysteriously—and Dante never confronts theissue) ended up somewhere around Mesopotamia, and there began populating theearth with humankind. Singleton (Sing.1958.1), pp. 146–55, argues well for thisview, basing his sense of the passage in what he considers Dante’s understandingof the older Latin version of Genesis 3:24, in which Adam (as well as Eve) wassent “opposite Eden” right after he fell, i.e., into the antipodal hemisphere.And thus only Adam and Eve knew these stars.That the four stars may represent the Southern Cross has long been considered apossibility. But how could Dante have known of them? Portirelli (in a lengthy,original, and fascinating passage in his commentary, ca. 1805, to vv. 22–30)speculates that Marco Polo, returned to Venice from his quarter century’ssojourn in the Far East in 1295, was Dante’s source. One can surely believe thatDante at least heard from others some of what the voyager reported. Nonetheless,neither Marco nor his book is ever mentioned by Dante. See Giuliano Bertuccioli,“Polo, Marco,” ED IV (1973), p. 589.Whatever the literal significance of these stars, their symbolic valence seemsplain, and has so from the time of the earliest commentators: they represent thefour moral (or cardinal) virtues: prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.What is important to understand (and for a fine exposition of the point in oneof the most helpful essays on Dante’s Cato ever written see Proto [Prot.1912.1])is that these virtues were infused and not earned—which again points to Adam andEve, the only humans born before Christ who had the virtues infused in theirvery making. In his commentary (1544), Vellutello both insists on Adam and Eveas the “first people” and nearly gives expression to the fact that, in them,these virtues were infused.

[part0009.html#c01-s9-e] Our northern hemisphere is “widowed,” deprived ofthe sight of these stars, because, as Chiavacci Leonardi suggests in hercommentary (Chia.1994.1), it is like the “widowed” Jerusalem of Jeremiah (Ier.1:1), separated permanently from its original condition of unalloyed goodness(the condition, we may sometimes forget, that preceded that of original sin).Those who argue that our “widowhood” signifies that we know no goodness aredefeated by the fact that some humans are indeed virtuous. What we have lost ismore primitive and total than acquired virtue: absolute innocence. [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c01-s9-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c01-s9-i]]29–30. [part0009.html#c01-s10-e] Dante looks north now, where the Big Dipper(“the Wain”) is not seeable, given the fact that it is above the equator.[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s10-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c01-s10-i]]31. [part0009.html#c01-s11-e] The solitary figure of Cato is never named inthe two cantos in which he appears (he was, however, referred to by name in Inf.XIV.15). Emerging details make his identity unmistakable. It would seem thatDante was fully aware of the puzzlement and outrage his salvation of Cato wouldcause; he thus apparently chose to leave the detective work to us, forcing us toacknowledge, from the details that he presents, that this is indeed the soul ofCato of Utica (95–46 b.c.), saved despite his suicide and his opposition toJulius Caesar, a sin in the last canto that damned Brutus and Cassius to thelowest zone of hell. (On this problem see Pasquazi [Pasq.1965.1], pp. 529–33.)“Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis, great-grandson of Cato the Censor, born b.c. 95;brought up as a devoted adherent of the Stoic school, he became conspicuous forhis rigid morality. On the outbreak of the civil war in 49 he sided with Pompey;after the battle of Pharsalia he joined Metellus Scipio in Africa; when thelatter was defeated at Thapsus, and all of Africa, with the exception of Utica,submitted to Caesar, he resolved to die rather than fall into Caesar’s hands; hetherefore put to an end his own life, after spending the greater part of thenight in reading Plato’s Phaedo on the immortality of the soul, B.C. 46” (T).It is vital to understand that no one other than Dante was of the opinion thatCato was saved. And that he is so to be construed escapes most early (and manylater) commentators, who balk at this simple but offending notion and thusattempt to deal with Cato as an abstract quality rather than as a historicalfigure. Pietro di Dante’s gloss (1340) to vv. 85–90 is one of the few places inwhich one may find a clear statement of the better view: Christ harrowed Catofrom hell along with the faithful Hebrews; the Holy Spirit inspired Cato tobelieve in Christ to come and to seek absolution for his sins—or so Dante wouldlike us to believe. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s11-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c01-s11-i]]32–33. [part0009.html#c01-s11-e] Such strongly worded phrases of praiseindicate the strength (and striking strangeness) of Dante’s personal sense ofidentity with Cato. For some of his previous and later enthusiastic encomia ofCato the Younger see Conv. IV.xxviii.13–19 and Mon. II.v.15–17. And for thepossibility that Dante saw in Virgil’s line describing Cato, which appears inthe description of the shield of Aeneas at Aen. VIII.670, his own name coupledwith Cato’s, see Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 128–29: “his dantem iura Catonem”([italics added] and Cato giving them the laws). [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s11-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c01-s11-i]]34–36. [part0009.html#c01-s12-e] According to Lucan (Phars. II.372–376), Cato,sickened with sadness by the Caesar-inspired civil war in Rome, let his hair andbeard grow untrimmed as a sign of grief. While he was only in his forties whenhe fought for the republican cause, Dante chooses to emphasize his age. However,and as Singleton says in his comment to verse 31, “it should be remembered thatfor Dante la senettute (old age) begins at forty-six (Conv. IV.xxiv.4).”For the resemblances to Moses in Dante’s portrait of Cato see Hollander(Holl.1969.1), pp. 124–26, and Carol Kaske (Kask.1971.1), pp. 2–3, 12–15.[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s12-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c01-s12-i]]37–39. [part0009.html#c01-s13-e] The general sense is clear: Cato’s face isshining with light. Is this true because the four stars irradiate his face asthough they were a sun shining upon him (the more usual interpretation), or isDante saying that it was as though, in the brightness of Cato’s face, the sunwere shining before him? In our translation we have allowed the majority view,aware that the truncated grammatical logic of the line invites completion with“Cato” rather than “myself.” However, we remain tempted by the minority view(restated by Giannantonio [Gian.1989.1], pp. 14–15), encouraged by, among otherthings, the fact that Dante had described the face of Lady Philosophy in thesecond ode of Convivio (vv. 59–62) as overcoming our understanding as the sunovercomes weak sight. Since the next canto will introduce the text of the secondode from Convivio for our consideration, it may be worth considering theappropriateness of that image to this scene. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s13-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c01-s13-i]]40–45. [part0009.html#c01-s14-e] Cato’s initial rigid and probing moralattitude may seem to indicate that he does not immediately understand the verygrace that has brought him here. He reasons that Dante and Virgil, not arrivingat his shores in the “normal” way (disembarking from the angel’s ship that weshall see in the next canto), may have snuck into this holy land. He intuitsthat they have come up from the stream (the eventual course of Lethe?) thatdescends into hell (see Inf. XXXIV.129–132) and is eager to know how they couldhave done so without a very special grace indeed. Nonetheless, in a mannertotally unlike that encountered in the demons of Inferno, he at once allows forthe possibility of grace. His second tercet immediately reveals what a differentplace we have now reached, one in which doubt and possibility exist even in theminds of its sternest keepers. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s14-e] /Italian [part0016.html#c01-s14-i]]46–48. [part0009.html#c01-s16-e] His second set of questions maintains asimilar balance: “Are you here because some newfangled ordinance of hell permitsit, or has Heaven decreed a new law, permitting such unusual travel, that hasbeen superimposed upon the New Law made by Christ?” That he refers to the cliffsof purgatory as his own shows that he is the keeper of the whole mountain, notjust of its shore, a matter that used to cause debate. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s16-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c01-s16-i]]49–51. [part0009.html#c01-s17-e] Cato’s queries finally bring Virgil into theconversation. It is probably significant that the opening splendors of thisChristian realm have been presented for Dante’s sake alone. Only now does Virgilresume his role as guide.The “signs” (cenni) with which he encourages his charge are probably facialgestures. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s17-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c01-s17-i]]52–54. [part0009.html#c01-s18-e] Virgil’s response echoes Dante’s toCavalcante de’ Cavalcanti (Inf. X.61): “Da me stesso non vegno” (I come not onmy own). There Dante reveals his debt to Virgil; here Virgil owns hissubservience to Beatrice. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s18-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c01-s18-i]]58–60. [part0009.html#c01-s20-e] Virgil’s insistence on Dante’s near-deathcondition at the outset of the poem may remind us of the possible connectionbetween that condition and suicide (see note to Inferno XIII.24). Thereflections of Inferno I and XIII in this canto, presided over by the “good”suicide, Cato, may produce an overtone of this concern.Virgil’s ascription of Dante’s proximity to death to his follia may also remindthe reader of Ulysses’ folle volo (Inf. XXVI.125—the last text in which we haveseen the word in its adjectival or nominal form). The younger Dante may haveattempted to exercise options that he now regards as self-destructive. Cantos I,XIII, XXVI, and XXXIV of Inferno are perhaps those most present from thatcantica in the verses of this opening canto of Purgatorio. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s20-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c01-s20-i]]66. [part0009.html#c01-s22-e] That all the souls on the mountain are seen asbeing in Cato’s charge makes it close to impossible to assign him a partialrole, as do even some commentators who treat him as historical and not anallegory, one in which he has authority only over the entrance at the shore orover that and the “vestibule” (ante-purgatory). He seems rather to be theguardian, appointed by God, of the entire mountain. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s22-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c01-s22-i]]68. [part0009.html#c01-s23-e] The “power” that leads Virgil from above wasapparent to him when he first saw Beatrice in Limbo and she was “donna di virtù”(Inf. II.76). [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s23-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c01-s23-i]]71–74. [part0009.html#c01-s24-e] Virgil’s phrasing, which makes freedom(libertà) the key word connecting Dante and Cato, may also remind the reader ofChrist, who gave His life for our freedom. For perhaps the first substantialunderstanding that there are significant figural relations between Christ andCato see Raimondi (Raim.1962.1), pp. 78–83; for the compelling further notionthat Dante would have seen confirmation of exactly such a reading in the text ofLucan itself, see Raimondi (Raim.1962.1, p. 80, and Raim.1967.2, p. 21)highlighting Cato’s words (Phars. II.312): “Hic redimat sanguis populos” (andlet my blood ransom the people). Barberi Squarotti eventually summarized thisview as follows: “Cato, finally, comes to take on the function of a lay figuraof Christ” (Barb.1984.1), p. 33. See also, in this vein, Wetherbee(Weth.1984.1), p. 135. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s24-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c01-s24-i]]75. [part0009.html#c01-s25-e] This line is so clear in its prediction ofCato’s eventual salvation, when he will receive his glorified body in thegeneral resurrection of the just that will follow the Last Judgment, that onehas difficulty accepting Pasquazi’s claim that the issue of Cato’s salvation isleft unresolved (Pasq.1965.1, p. 534). Pasquazi is closer to the mark thanAndreoli, who, in his commentary (1856) to this verse, simply denies thepossibility that Cato could be saved, arguing that Dante provides no grounds bywhich we might accept such a view. This is but another example of how the forceof Dante’s daring treatment of Cato has escaped his readers. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s25-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c01-s25-i]]77. [part0009.html#c01-s26-e] Virgil’s self-serving reference to the fact thathe was not an active sinner temporarily hides the further fact that he isdamned. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s26-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c01-s26-i]]78–84. [part0009.html#c01-s26-e] Virgil’s attempt at captatio benevolentiae(the winning of an audience’s goodwill) probably sounds reasonable enough tomost readers. Since he dwells in Limbo with Marcia, Cato’s wife, he seeks tosway him with reference to her. Virgil has learned, we might reflect, howcaptatio functions in a Christian context from Beatrice, who practiced it uponhim (Inf. II.58–60, II.73–74). If such rhetoric worked on him, he would seem tohave surmised, perhaps it will now be effective with Cato. However, and as DiBenedetto (DiBe.1985.1), p. 175, has noted, “the mention of Marcia was somethingof a gaffe.” [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s26-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c01-s26-i]]85–93. [part0009.html#c01-s29-e] Cato’s rebuke of Virgil is gentle but firm:(1) Marcia pleased me well enough when I was mortal, but after I was harrowedfrom Limbo by Christ (the maker of the “New Law”), pity for the damned was nolonger possible for me; (2) Beatrice’s having interceded for you is all that isrequired—there is no need for flattery. Cato, unlike Orpheus, will not look backfor his dead wife. He would seem rather to have Christ’s words in mind: “For inthe resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as theangels of God in heaven” (Matthew 22:30), a passage Dante cites later in thiscantica (Purg. XIX.137).Cato’s characterization of Virgil’s words as lusinghe (flatteries) is harsh, butjustified by Virgil’s error. The name that would have worked (and still does) isBeatrice’s, not Marcia’s. Virgil has relied upon the power of the spirituallydead when he should have appealed to that of the saved. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s29-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c01-s29-i]]94–99. [part0009.html#c01-s32-e] Turning from his admonition (which would haveseemed gratuitous had the author not wanted to call Virgil’s sense of thesituation into question), Cato now orders the Roman poet to gird Dante’s loinswith a symbol of humility. Pietro di Dante (commentary to vv. 134–136) refers tothe sixth chapter of Matthew (he means Micah 6:14): “humiliatio tua in mediotui” (your casting down shall be in your midst), what Singleton’s comment toverse 95 calls the cingulum humilitatis (cincture of humility). Dante’sconfirmation in humility must be joined with his purification (the cleansing ofhis face) so that he be pure in sight when he stands before the “admittingangel” at the gate of purgatory in Canto IX.The giunco schietto (verse 95), the rush with which Virgil is ordered to bindhis pupil, is, as Tommaseo (1837) was perhaps the first to suggest (in hiscommentary to vv. 94–96), meant to echo positively the horrible vegetation ofthe forest of the suicides (Inf. XIII.5), described as having branches that arenot straight (“non rami schietti”), but contorted. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s32-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c01-s32-i]]100–105. [part0009.html#c01-s34-e] Cato points Virgil (and Dante) toward adescent to the very shore of the island, its lowest point, truly a descent intohumility, where the only vegetation is this most modest of plants, characterizedby its plainness and its pliancy, and by its ability to grow in a landscapeinhospitable to any other form of life.

[part0009.html#c01-s39-e] The beginning of this dawn, Easter Sunday1300, resonates, as Tommaseo (1837) was perhaps the first to notice, with asimilar phrasing from Virgil, “splendet tremulo sub lumine pontus” (the seagleams beneath her flickering light—Aen. VII.9). The scene is the departure ofAeneas as he resumes his voyage toward Latium, but the source of that light isthe moon, not the sun. In both works the passage marks a boundary of importance,the beginning of the “Iliadic” second half of the Aeneid and the preparation forDante’s journey upward toward God’s kingdom.

[part0009.html#c01-s40-e] The comparison equates the protagonist andhis guide alike with a person who finds the necessary (and hitherto obscured)path; yet we surely reflect that it applies far more forcefully to Dante, who isreported as having lost the true way at the poem’s beginning (“ché la dirittavia era smarrita”—Inf. I.3), and who now, and only now, is back on the pathtoward salvation. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s40-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c01-s40-i]]121–123.

[part0009.html#c01-s42-e] Virgil’s cleansing of Dante’s face removedthe dark stain of the sins of hell from his visage and restored his white, orinnocent (and faithful?), countenance. That we should think of the rite ofbaptism here may have been suggested by Benvenuto da Imola, whose gloss to vv.121–125 refers to the rugiada (dew) as the “dew of divine grace, abundant whenmen humble their hearts before God and are cleansed of their habitualsinfulness.”Pietro di Dante (1340) was the first (and remains one of the relative few) ofthe poem’s commentators to insist on the redoing here of Aeneas’s self-cleansingwhen he enters the Elysian fields (Aen. VI.635–636), a natural association forDante to have had in mind. He too is entering a better precinct, having turnedhis attention away from “Tartarus,” the place of the wicked.

[part0009.html#c01-s44-e] The reminiscence of Ulysses here has had arecent surge of appreciation, but notice of it is as ancient as the commentaryof Benvenuto da Imola (followed, as he often was, by John of Serravalle). CitingSt. Augustine’s opinion (in De civitate Dei, Benvenuto [1380] says) that no onehad ever lived at the antipodes who ever returned from there, Benvenuto goes onto suggest that this passage reflects the failed voyage of Ulysses. Some recentwriters have also pointed out that the rhyme words in the passage (diserto,esperto; acque, piacque, rinacque) are also found in the Ulysses passage (Inf.XXVI.98f., XXVI.137f.). [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s44-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c01-s44-i]]133–136. [part0009.html#c01-s45-e] The triumphant wonder of the little miracleof the Christlike humble reed that renews itself concludes the canto with aproper Christian note. For Pasquazi (Pasq.1965.1), p. 537, the reed “expressesthe beginning of an inner renewal, through which the poet, holding to the way ofhumility, opens himself to a new life.” This canto is thus a canto of two“suicides,” Cato and Jesus, each of whom voluntarily gave his life so thatothers might be free. For the way in which this scene counters the images ofsuicide found in Inferno XIII.31–32 see Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 129–31. Inthe earlier scene, Dante, under Virgil’s orders, breaks off a twig from thethornbush that is the damned soul of Pier della Vigna. Bits broken from some ofthe suicides do not grow back (see XIII.141–142), but strew the forest floor.Here the humble plant does indeed regrow. Wetherbee (Weth.1984.1), pp. 37–38,makes a similar observation. Pasquini (Pasq.1996.1), pp. 421–22, studies stillother connections between Cato and Pier.However, the major reference here is, as the early commentators were quick torealize, to the golden bough in the Aeneid (VI.143–144): “Primo avulso nondeficit alter / aureus” (when the first is plucked, a second, golden too, doesnot fail to take its place). That scene offers a fitting parallel to this one,but with a major and governing difference: the classical object is artificialand precious, while the Christian one is natural and of little worth. Thus doesthe humility that inspires the Christian sublime help it outdo its classicalforebear. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s45-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c01-s45-i]]PURGATORIO II1–9. [part0009.html#c02-s1-e] This elaborate way of telling time by theposition of the sun and other stars in the heavens, inopportune in hell, wherethe sight of the sky is denied the travelers, will be a frequent feature ofPurgatorio. The four main points of reference are, here (and on otheroccasions), Jerusalem, site of the Crucifixion and thus the most significantpoint on earth; the Ganges, 90 degrees to the east; the antipodes, 180 degreesto the south; and Cádiz, in Spain, 270 degrees around the circle of themeridian, a great-circle arc over Jerusalem. This makes a right angle in itsintersection with the plane made by the equator, which extends into a similargreat-circle arc known as the horizon. Each of the four equidistant pointscovered by the meridian is six hours from the other. Thus we are told that itwas 6 PM in Jerusalem, midnight over India, and dawn here at the antipodes. Thelocation of noon is left unexpressed, but we can understand that it is in factover Cádiz, and may choose to understand that the omission forces us to supplythis last indication and perhaps consider that this is the place associated withUlysses’ departure on his “mad flight” (Inf. XXVI.106–111), especially since theconcluding verses of the last canto had so clearly reminded the reader ofUlysses’ voyage (see note to Purg. I.130–132 and Holl.1990.1, pp. 32–33).The phrase at vv. 4–6 is complicated, but eventually comprehensible. In thenorthern hemisphere, when the nights grow longer than the day after the autumnsolstice, the sun appears in Libra, as a result no longer a nighttimeconstellation, and thus the Scales “fall from her [night’s] hand.” However, inthe northern hemisphere it is now just after the spring solstice and the nightis found in Libra, while the sun is in Aries. [return to English[part0009.html#c02-s1-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c02-s1-i]]10–12. [part0009.html#c02-s4-e] The mood of the travelers, compared by many,perhaps beginning with Benvenuto da Imola (1380), to pilgrims on their way toearn indulgence for their sins, is not particularly eager. Rather, they seem tohesitate. Vittorio Russo (Russ.1969.1), p. 243, cites Hebrews 11:13–16, with itsinsistence on the nature of life as a pilgrimage, as relevant to this tercet.That passage is contained in one of the most significant texts in the NewTestament giving credence to the idea that those who were born before Christwere nonetheless responsible for and capable of believing in Christ to come (allof Hebrews 11 insists on the faith found in the great figures of the OldTestament). But our pilgrims seem more at home with “Egypt” than they are eagerfor the New Jerusalem, as were the Hebrews themselves in the desert (see Exodus14:11–12; 16:2–3; 17:3) because they lacked a full measure of zeal for theirjourney. For a discussion of the hesitance that suffuses this canto see Gorni(Gorn.1982.1). As Poletto (1894) was perhaps the first to note, the phrasinghere reflects that of Vita nuova XII.6, where, in a simile, Dante is unsureabout the path he should pursue. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s4-e] /Italian [part0016.html#c02-s4-i]]13–18. [part0009.html#c02-s5-e] This is, perhaps surprisingly, the firstsimile of Purgatorio (there was a brief comparison at Purg. I.119–120; anotherat verse 11, just above). While the first canto (vv. 19–21) involved a specialrelationship to Venus, this canto turns instead to Mars, treated here, as wasVenus there, as morning star. In his Convivio, where Dante associates the firstseven heavens with the liberal arts, he says (II.xiii.20–24) that Mars may becompared to Music. He concludes (24): “Moreover, Music attracts to itself thehuman spirits, which are, as it were, principally vapors of the heart, so thatthey almost completely cease their activity; this happens likewise to the entiresoul when it hears music, and the virtue of all of them, as it were, runs to thespirit of sense, which receives the sound” (tr. Lansing). We shall see thatthese notions will come into play when Casella sings Dante’s ode to the newpilgrims at the mountain’s shore later in the canto. Bernardino Daniello wasperhaps the first commentator (1568) to bring that passage in Convivio to bearon this text. But the valence of the passage as it is reflected here puts thealluring red light of Mars (and, later, listening to music, which is what Marssignifies in the earlier text) into a negative correspondence with the alacrityand whiteness of the swiftly approaching angel. Looking west toward Mars impliesturning one’s back on the sunrise to the east. Porena’s commentary (1946)observes that Dante, as a Tuscan, was acquainted with this view of the sea, onefound on the western—and not the eastern—shore of the Italian peninsula. [returnto English [part0009.html#c02-s5-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c02-s5-i]]19–30. [part0009.html#c02-s7-e] The gradual revelation of the approachingpresence (more light, greater size, two elements of white that then resolve tothree [two wings and the angel’s “body”]) culminates in Virgil’s recognition ofthe angelic nature of the steersman. For a brief account of the nature of anddoctrinal problems inherent in Dante’s angelology see Alison Cornish(Corn.2000.1).The term galeotto (helmsman, steersman) has been used for Phlegyas, who carriedDante and Virgil across the Styx in his skiff (Inf. VIII.17—galeoto). It hadpreviously been used by Francesca (Inf. V.137), as a proper noun, to cast blameupon the character Gallehault in the Arthurian romance that led, according toher, to her undoing. The present galeotto is surely to be understood as abetter-intentioned guide. Dante has been cleansed by Virgil to be in thepurified condition fitting for his presence before exactly such a being, “ilprimo ministro … di paradiso” (Purg. I.98–99). Hell had its guardian demons;purgatory has guardian angels. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s7-e] /Italian [part0016.html#c02-s7-i]]31–36. [part0009.html#c02-s11-e] Virgil’s two balanced exclamations insist onthe supernatural abilities of the angel. The first has the effect of remindingus of Ulysses. Where Ulysses made wings of oars (Inf. XXVI.135), this travelerover the same seas before the mount of purgatory requires neither oar nor sail.The word for “oar” was last heard in Ulysses’ speech (as was the phrase “suolmarino” [ocean floor] of verse 15 at Inf. XXVI.129). The word for poop deck,poppa, introduced to the poem to describe Ulysses’ position as captain of hisship (XXVI.124, repeated at XXVI.140) now recurs to set this celestial steersmanagainst his less worthy counterpart (verse 43). For this argument see Hollander(Holl.1990.1), pp. 34–35.The second tercet, describing the heaven-directed wings of the angel, may remindus of Satan’s (Inf. XXXIV.46–52) huge wings, if only by antithesis. [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c02-s11-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c02-s11-i]]38. [part0009.html#c02-s13-e] Lombardi (1791) pointed out that the “ucceldivino” (heavenly bird) stands in opposition to the demon Farfarello, a“malvagio uccello” (filthy bird) at Inferno XXII.96.

See also Inferno VIII.25–27, when Dante’s weight makesPhlegyas’s skiff sink in the muddy water of the Styx. And see the note toInferno III.136.

The vast majority ofcodices and commentators prefer the variant not chosen by Petrocchi: “tal cheparea beato per iscripto” (in such manner as to seem blessed by inscription).Petrocchi chooses the variant “tal che faria beato pur descripto” (in such a wayas to render blessed anyone who reads or hears him described). While we stronglyside with the majority view, we have followed Petrocchi here as always. Were weto depart from him, our translation would run as follows: “whose look made himseem inscribed in blessedness.” See this writer’s earlier opinion (Holl.1990.1,p. 42): “My own view is that the verse should be read in the spirit of Landino’sgloss, which holds that he seemed ‘inscribed, that is, confirmed in bliss,’ inthe sense (also tentatively lent support by Portirelli) that he is written inthe Book of Life” (see Apoc. 20:12 and discussion in Holl.1982.1).

[part0009.html#c02-s15-e] Dante’s “more than a hundred” is a poet’sallowable indefinite number, but one based on a very good number indeed, onehundred, number of God (1+0+0 = 1) and of the number of cantos in this poem.[return to English [part0009.html#c02-s15-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c02-s15-i]]46–48. [part0009.html#c02-s16-e] The arriving pilgrims, seated in the shipthat carries them to purgation and eventual salvation, sing the Psalm of theExodus, 114–115 in the modern Bible, 113 in the Vulgate. The text states clearlythat they sing all of it in their shared exhilaration. For the informing patternof the Exodus in this canto (and in the poem as a whole) see, among others,Singleton (Sing.1960.1), Tucker (Tuck.1960.1), Freccero (Frec.1986.1), pp.14–15, 55–69, and Armour (Armo.1981.1).For the program of Psalms and hymns utilized by Dante in the Purgatorio seeMastrobuono (Mast.1979.1), pp. 181–89, La Favia (LaFa.1984.1), and Ardissono(Ardi.1990.1).

[part0009.html#c02-s18-e] The second scene of the canto begins with themutual pleasure and confusion of the two groups that play the major roles in it,the crowd of pilgrims and the two travelers, both less (in Virgil’s case) andmore than saved souls, since Dante is destined to return and will then be auniquely experienced penitent.

[part0009.html#c02-s21-e] Virgil’s reply to the saved souls identifieshimself and Dante as being “pilgrims,” in the generic sense that they aretravelers in a foreign land. In a more limited and Christian sense, only Danteand the new arrivals are truly on a pilgrimage. This is the first of nine usesof the noun or adjective peregrino that are distributed through the final twocantiche. For the view that the controlling idea of the Commedia is that of apilgrimage see, among others, Demaray (Dema.1987.1), pp. 1–60; Basile(Basi.1990.1); Holloway (Holl.1992.3), esp. pp. 57–84; and Picone (Pico.1997.1).[return to English [part0009.html#c02-s21-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c02-s21-i]]65. [part0009.html#c02-s22-e] Virgil’s recollection of the difficult journeyup through hell is made to reflect the poet’s own formulation in Inferno I.5exactly: aspra e forte (dense and harsh), the adjectives there referring to the“dark wood” of the world in which Dante found himself at the outset. [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c02-s22-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c02-s22-i]]66. [part0009.html#c02-s22-e] These are Virgil’s last words in the canto. Infact he nearly disappears from the scene once Dante and Casella take over centerstage. He will be mentioned as forming part of the group of those who are raptby Casella’s song (verse 115) and as departing in haste with Dante in thecanto’s final verse (133). In both cases he is behaving less like a guide thanlike a lost soul. In a sense, this is the protagonist’s first solo flight in theCommedia, a moment in which he is potentially in command of the situation. Hissuccess is hardly dazzling.

[part0009.html#c02-s23-e] Satan, with his three heads, had seemed amaraviglia to the protagonist in Inferno XXXIV.37. In the last canto it was themiraculous “resurrection” of the Christlike humble plant (verse 134) that hadseemed a “wonder” to him. Now it is he who causes wonder in the onlookers, sincehe is present in the flesh. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s23-e] /Italian [part0016.html#c02-s23-i]]70–74. [part0009.html#c02-s24-e] This second simile of the canto comparesDante’s living visage to the olive branch carried by a messenger of peace. Inother words, his very presence in this precinct is an additional assurance tothe new souls that God’s justice and promise of a kingdom of peace as the finalhaven for a Christian life was truly offered and truly kept. They have arrived,even if the way before them is uncertain and difficult, since they still have toperform their ritual cleansing of even the memory of sin. Commentators point totwo possible Virgilian sources: Aeneid VIII.115–116 and XI.100–101. In thesecond, messengers from the camp of Turnus, holding up olive branches, seekpermission of Aeneas to gather the bodies of the dead for burial; in the firstit is Aeneas himself, standing upon the puppis (quarterdeck) of his ship, whoholds forth the branch of peace to Pallas, son of Evander. Pallas is amazed(obstipuit—verse 121) by Aeneas’s cordial gesture and accedes to it. The entirecontext there seems to fit the details of Dante’s scene better, Dante as Aeneas“invading” the homeland of those with whom he will be allied.

[part0009.html#c02-s26-e] This as yet unidentified soul (we will learnhis name, Casella, at verse 91) has recognized Dante and advances to embracehim; Dante, filled with a proper Christian affection, responds to his embracer’semotion without any personalization, returning love for love without earthlydistinctions. It is a very good beginning for a pilgrim in purgatory. [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c02-s26-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c02-s26-i]]79–81. [part0009.html#c02-s27-e] This much-admired scene is modeled onanother, but which one? Aeneid II.792–794 and VI.700–702 contain three identicallines of verse describing a failed embrace. The first commentators opt for thelatter, Aeneas’s attempt to hold fast Anchises’ paternal ghost. But John ofSerravalle (1416) thinks, in a departure from that opinion, of Aeneas’sidentical effort to embrace the dead form of his wife, Creusa, in the secondbook. He was followed by Vellutello (1544). Modern commentators almostuniversally return to the more familiar scene in Book VI, and it has been rarein the last century of glossing to find anyone even contemplating the earlierscene involving Creusa. One would expect, perhaps, that commentators would atleast discuss their options. But such is not the case. For reasons to prefer theless favored text, see Hollander (Holl.1990.1, p. 38), pointing out that (1) thepoet will later and unmistakably refer to Aeneas’s attempted embrace of Anchises(Par. XV.25–27) and arguing that it would be less than likely for him to do sohere as well, since he had two such moments to choose from; (2) the context, inwhich Casella will shortly be singing a song of love to Dante, would argue forthe greater appropriateness of Creusa than Anchises.For the apostrophe of the “empty shades, except in seeming” see, as Tommaseosuggested in 1837, Inferno VI.36, the phrase “lor vanità che par persona” (theiremptiness, which seems real bodies). The shades of the gluttons there and of allposthumous souls have this in common, but we must wait for Statius’s longdisquisition in Canto XXV to learn how the “aerial body” of the dead isproduced.

[part0009.html#c02-s28-e] Casella’s smile is the first one we have seensince Limbo, when Virgil smiled to see the poets of antiquity welcome Dante asthey prepared to include him in their noble company (Inf. IV.99). Smiles,understandably absent from the visages of those in hell, will be more frequentin purgatory, some dozen of them, and still more so in paradise (two dozen).[return to English [part0009.html#c02-s28-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c02-s28-i]]85–87.

[part0009.html#c02-s31-e] Casella, finally named, was obviously, from thecontext of the scene, a musician. That is really all we know with any certaintyabout him. Nonetheless, it is clear that he is someone whom Dante actually knew.Whether he was from Florence or Pistoia (or even Siena—the commentators arepuzzled and offer these possibilities, most of them plumping for Florence) we donot know. Whether he actually set one or more of Dante’s poems to music, we donot know. For some sense of his possible identity and activity see Peirone,“Casella,” ED I (1970), Bisogni (Biso.1971.1), and Elsheikh (Elsh.1971.1).[return to English [part0009.html#c02-s31-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c02-s31-i]]93. [part0009.html#c02-s31-e] Casella has evidently been dead some time (forat least slightly more than three months, as verse 98 will make plain) and Dantewonders why he has been so long between death and his first step towardsalvation, arrival in purgatory. Beginning with Poletto (1894) and Moore(Moor.1896.1), p. 168, commentators have seen a connection here with Charon’sunwillingness to take certain of the waiting shades across Acheron (they all areeager to be taken) and in fact picking and choosing among the waiting throng(Aen. VI.315–316). We might continue the thought: In Dante’s poem Charon takesall bound for hell at once; only those bound for purgatory need to be winnowedby the transporting angel, with some having to stay longer in the world, nearOstia, thus mirroring a sort of prepurgation that the poet has invented,offstage, as it were. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s31-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c02-s31-i]]94–105. [part0009.html#c02-s32-e] Casella’s startling narrative at timesescapes the sort of attention it requires. This is what we learn: Before theJubilee Year’s plenary indulgence announced by Pope Boniface in February 1300(retroactive to Christmas of 1299), all those who came to the region aroundOstia, where the souls of the saved are gathered, had to await the pleasure ofthe angel to be taken aboard the ship that we have just seen Casella and theothers disembark from. Before 25 December 1299, Casella was denied many times aseat in the ship. We are forced to understand that he was not gifted with aparticularly energetic desire for God; i.e., he was a perfect “brother” to theDante we meet at the beginning of this canto, a man like those “who think aboutthe way and in their hearts go on—while still their bodies linger” (vv. 11–12).Purgatory thus has three places: the mountain of purgation itself,ante-purgatory, and “pre-ante-purgatory,” located somewhere never described butat or near Ostia. And the laws of this place themselves underwent a change inlate 1299, for after that date anyone who wanted to depart for the “holy land”would be accommodated by the angel. (Dante has apparently, on no authority buthis own, decided that the plenary indulgence for sinners extended to the soulsof the justified dead as well.)This requires that we understand that during the past three months Casella didnot want to travel south toward heaven. Given his behavior once he arrives atthe shore, however, this is not totally surprising. Finally, precisely threemonths after the merciful decree was made, he decided that he wanted to leave.The date: 25 March 1300, the Florentine New Year. Is it coincidence that this,the most likely date for the beginning of Dante’s journey (see notes to Inf.I.1; I.11; Purg. I.19–21), is also that on which Casella probably set out?Whether or not it is, we have the delightful spectacle of these two miraculousvoyagers, each starting somewhere in Italy, one gliding over the seas, the othermoving under the earth, arriving at the antipodes within minutes of one another,reunited in friendship and peace. (Poletto’s discussion [1894] of some of theseproblems is one of the few in which these complex matters are closely andsuggestively examined.) [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s32-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c02-s32-i]]106–108. [part0009.html#c02-s36-e] The protagonist’s language is laced withdiametrically opposed terms: “new law” and “songs of love.” Merely hearing them,one intuits that there is an oppositional relationship between them. Daniello’scommentary (1568) asserts that there is indeed a “new law” in purgatory, where“one does not sing vain and lascivious things, but hymns and psalms in praise ofGod, and prays to Him.” In this first confrontation, looking ahead to the songnot yet sung, the 113th Psalm is that of the “New Law,” and is juxtaposedagainst the love song that Dante wrote for a woman in the last century. It isthis kind that, earthbound as he now again is, the protagonist longs for.Petrocchi’s text for verse 108 reads “doglie” (sorrows) and not “voglie”(longings). Hardly any Dantist currently admires this choice, and the vastmajority urge a return to the 1921 reading, including the translators.

[part0009.html#c02-s37-e] Dante’s soul, wearied by his bodily weight,remembers his condition at the beginning of Inferno (I.22): in simile, his mind,in stress, is like the breath of a man escaping from death by drowning,affannata (laboring). If he seems better off now than he was then, he is stillin considerable difficulty. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s37-e] /Italian [part0016.html#c02-s37-i]]112. [part0009.html#c02-s38-e] Casella’s song is Dante’s song, the secondcanzone found in Convivio. It was composed in celebration of Lady Philosophy.That sounds innocent or even positive. On the other hand, she is, early on inConvivio, specifically designated as having replaced Beatrice in Dante’saffections. Within the confines of Convivio this is not problematic. In theCommedia, in which Beatrice is the moving force for so much, it is.For discussions of the possibility that Casella actually set this canzone ofDante see Marti (Mart.1962.1), pp. 81–88, and Bisogni (Biso.1971.1).

One can see why most readers of this scene take these wordsas confirming the poet’s approval of a positive feeling. But see InfernoXXVI.19–24, where the poet “grieves again” as he “grieved then” for the lostUlysses. Both Ulysses and his own Convivial ode are marked as temptations thestrength of which are both still vividly felt by him, even though he now knowsbetter than to accede to them.

[part0009.html#c02-s40-e] Cato’s return was not in the program, as isclear from verse 106 in the previous canto. He evidently believed that thisspecially privileged Christian visitor to purgatory would know how to behavebetter than he does. But now he has not only backslid himself, but is involvingthe whole new contingent of the saved into behaving similarly. Cato soundsexactly like St. Paul, urging them all to “put off the old man and put on thenew” (Ephesians 4:22; Colossians 3:9). For the closeness of Dante’s thought hereto Colossians 2 and 3 see Holl.1975.1, p. 357. See also Hollander (Holl.1990.1),pp. 40–41: “And Cato’s identity here is not only Pauline, for the scene isclearly reminiscent of Moses’s discovery of the falsely worshipping Hebrewsbefore that golden calf (Exodus 32:18–19—see Kaske [Kask.1971.1]) which the textof Psalm 113 had already set before the minds of all who listened to what theirown lips were singing only moments before. Echoing God’s command and Moses’scompliance (‘neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount’—Exodus34:3), Cato sends the music-lovers flying.” For the Pauline references see alsoRigo (Rigo.1994.1), pp. 93–94.

[part0009.html#c02-s41-e] Those who argue that Cato is being overzealousshould pay closer attention to this strong charge he makes against the negligentspirits. Whatever the “slough” (scoglio) signifies, their adherence to itprevents their seeing God. In the world of the Commedia that can never be aslight problem.

[part0009.html#c02-s42-e] This third and final simile of the cantolikens the new pilgrims to doves (for the three programmatic references to thesebirds in the Commedia, here and in Inf. V.82 and Par. XXV.19, see Shoaf[Shoa.1975.1]). See Hollander (Holl.1990.1), p. 41: “Their saved souls hunger onhigh, but their appetitive natures are not yet wrung dry of earthly longing.Thus they are careless in their ingestion (see Matthew 13:36–43 for the parableof the wheat and the tares alluded to in their failure to make a decisionbetween ‘biado o loglio’). If music be the food of love, there is also aheavenly music. We and the pilgrims know that this is true. They have sung itthemselves in this very place.” [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s42-e] /Italian [part0016.html#c02-s42-i]]133. [part0009.html#c02-s44-e] The final verse, in its understated brevity,conveys a feeling for the two travelers’ guilty acceptance of Cato’s command andtheir hasty departure in shame.“The second canto of the Purgatorio dramatizes the need for interpretation bypresenting two songs to its audience, the arriving pilgrims. It is clear that wecomprise a still more crucial audience. Most of us have chosen to follow thelead of the one whom we take to be our leader, Dante himself. (His severalintellectually or morally flawed responses as he moved through Inferno have not,apparently, been cogent enough sign of his frequent inadequacy as guide to ourreactions.) He, lost in the beauty of his own old song, either fails tounderstand or else forgets the message of the new song which he has heard first,and which should have served as a rein on his enthusiasm. It is as old as Exodusand as new as the dawn which brings it, this Easter Sunday morning on the shoreof the mountain” (Holl.1990.1, p. 41).

[part0009.html#c03-s1-e] The two “companions” are running, but not asquickly as the souls who precede them, while Virgil considers his previousinappropriate behavior and Dante his own (as we shall learn in vv. 7–9, 12–13).The poet, as though apologizing for what he is putting Virgil through in thesescenes, reminds the reader of his enduring debt to the pagan poet, without whomthis journey through the afterworld would have been impossible.The word “ragione” in verse 3 does not mean “reason” but “justice,” as isattested by Dante’s earlier usage in Convivio (where it nine times refers tolaw, especially Justinian’s codification of Roman statutes—see Vasoli’sanalytical index to Convivio [Vaso.1988.1], pp. 1011–12), and the entirecommentary tradition (even if a small subset of commentators believes the wordhere means “conscience”). See also Marta Cristiani, “ragione,” ED IV (1973), pp.831–41, esp. 841. In this context it nearly certainly refers to divine justice.[return to English [part0009.html#c03-s1-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s1-i]]7–9. [part0009.html#c03-s3-e] Virgil’s remorse is self-caused. As Venturi(1732) remarked, Virgil rebukes himself even though he could not have been atarget of Cato’s anger, since he was not a soul on the way to purgation. Andthus the little fault applies to him alone, not to Dante and the others (for allof whom it is considerably more serious).

[part0009.html#c03-s4-e] Virgil, here momentarily lacking onestade(dignity), is bracketed by the figures of Cato and the group containing Manfred;both of these are referred to as onesto (Purg.

[part0009.html#c03-s5-e] The verb dislagarsi (literally meaning “to unlakeitself”) is a Dantean coinage, a phenomenon that will grow as the poemprogresses and flower in profusion in Paradiso.

[part0009.html#c03-s6-e] Dante’s presence here in the body is adouble-edged proposition, as it both emphasizes his extraordinary state of gracein being here in the flesh and his debilitated status, resulting from hisfleshly view of things. For a study of this phenomenon and its developmentthrough the cantica see Berk (Berk.1979.1), who points out that, while we mayfeel that Dante in Purgatorio all too frequently presents himself as casting ashadow, he in fact does so only six times: here; later in this canto (vv.88–90); then in Purgatorio V.4–6 and 25–27; XXVI.4–8; XXVII.64–69. Berk alsomakes the point that Dante’s corporeal shadow finds a correspondence, later inthe canto, in Manfred’s wounds (vv. 108, 111), the signs of that soul’s formermortality.

[part0009.html#c03-s7-e] Having noted his own shadow, the protagonistnow is struck by the absence of Virgil’s, and momentarily thinks he has beenabandoned by his guide. While, as soon as the travelers reached the shore of themount of purgatory and reentered the sunlight, the protagonist might have notedthat none of the immortal denizens of this new place casts a shadow—not Cato,none of the pilgrims, not his guide—the poet reserves that recognition for thiscanto, so filled with reminiscence of the death of Virgil.

[part0009.html#c03-s8-e] Benvenuto da Imola’s paraphrase of Virgil’srebuke begins with the words “modicae fidei”: (“you of little faith, why haveyou so easily lost the faith and the hope that you ought and may have in me, whonever left you behind in the city of the demons?”). Benvenuto is clearlythinking of the words of Christ in the Gospels (in the Latin Bible the phrase“modicae fidei” is found four times and only in Matthew [6:30; 8:26; 14:31;16:8]). If Benvenuto has correctly heard that echo, its effect is noteworthy,for then the faithless Virgil is reproving his pupil, modeling his speech on thewords of Christ, for his lack of faith, evident on occasion from the first cantoof the Inferno until Virgil leaves the poem in Purgatorio XXX. Whether Virgil isciting Scripture or having Scripture placed in his mouth by his Christian authoris a problem the reader has already encountered (see Inf. VIII.45 and note toVIII.40–45).

[part0009.html#c03-s9-e] Since it is shortly after dawn here inpurgatory, it is shortly after sunset at the antipodes, Jerusalem. And sinceItaly, in Dante’s geography, lies midway between Jerusalem and Gibraltar, it issometime after 3 PM there, as evening (vespero) begins with the sun’s lastquarter, between 3 PM and 6 PM. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s9-e] /Italian [part0016.html#c03-s9-i]]27. [part0009.html#c03-s9-e] Virgil died on 21 September 19 B.C. at Brindisi,a city in Apulia that still serves as a port for maritime travelers to and fromGreece. Augustus was responsible for the transfer of his body from Brindisi toNaples, or actually, Pozzuoli, some ten miles distant, where it was interred ina grotto in the vast tunnel, built by the ancient Romans, connecting Pozzuoliand the road to Naples. John of Serravalle (1416) records his having visited thesite on 30 August 1413 and having held bones of Virgil in his hands. Thispassage begins what has been called “an antepurgatorial preoccupation with thebody and its place of burial” (Heil.1972.1, p. 44).Pietro di Dante was perhaps the first to cite Virgil’s versified epitaph, asfound in the Vitae of Virgil by Suetonius and Donatus:Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nuncParthenope: cecini pascua, rura, duces.[Mantua gave me birth, Calabria took me off; now Naples holds me; I sang ofpastures, fields, and kings.]Virgil “sang” his Eclogues, Georgics, and Aeneid. For the possible reference tothe three Virgilian subjects in the final hundred verses of the canto, seeHollander (Holl.1984.4), p. 114:46–78: The barren landscape of this scene (rura)79–102: the contumacious as sheep (pascua)103–145: Manfred and empire (duces)In this experimental formulation Dante would, in exactly one hundred lines, havedeployed the three “spokes” of the stylistic rota Vergilii (the wheel ofVirgil).Carroll (1904) cites Plumptre for the opinion that this scene reflects the(unverified) tradition that St. Paul visited Virgil’s grave at Naples and weptfor the great poet, whom, had he but known him, he might have led to salvation.[return to English [part0009.html#c03-s9-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s9-i]]28–30. [part0009.html#c03-s10-e] Dante’s heavens include the nine celestialspheres containing the Moon and, as they move higher, eventually no stellarbodies of any kind (the primum mobile). In Paradiso we will learn that, whilethey are material, they are also translucent. Something similar is also the casewith respect to the shades here.

[part0009.html#c03-s11-e] Virgil here touches on the nature of the“aerial bodies” of the dead in Inferno and Purgatorio. The Roman poet Statiuswill elaborate on the “physical” nature of shades in Purgatorio XXV.34–108.[return to English [part0009.html#c03-s11-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c03-s11-i]]34–36. [part0009.html#c03-s12-e] The “posthumous Christian” ruefullyacknowledges, by pointing to reason as his means for attempting to know theessence of things, his failure to have had faith. The reference to reason doesnot indicate, as some commentators insist, that Virgil embodies or personifiesReason, especially since, in this context, Reason would then be commenting onthe shortcomings of reason. Reason is a property (or, in Scholastic terms, an“accident”) of the Roman poet, not his essence. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s12-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s12-i]]37. [part0009.html#c03-s13-e] The quia is a term deriving from Scholasticdiscourse. Benvenuto da Imola’s paraphrase nicely conveys both that style andprecisely what is meant here: “sufficiat vobis credere quia sic est, et nonquaerere propter quid est” (let it suffice you to believe that something is so,without seeking to know why it is so), i.e., to accept things as they are,without attempting to understand their causes. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s13-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s13-i]]38–39. [part0009.html#c03-s13-e] Some commentators (e.g., Benvenuto) are ofthe opinion that these lines indicate that had humankind been able to know thefinal mysteries, Adam and Eve would not have fallen and Christ would not havebeen needed to save us. It seems far more likely that Dante’s thought is morelogically connected than such an analysis would indicate: had we known all,there would have been no need for Christ to come to bring us the final truth ofthings. The focus here is not moral so much as it is intellectual. [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c03-s13-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s13-i]]40–45. [part0009.html#c03-s15-e] Perhaps there is no passage in the poem thatmore clearly delineates the tragedy of Virgil, now studied by its protagonisthimself. His own fourth Eclogue, which spoke of a virgin who would give birth toa son, but did not mean Mary and did not mean Jesus, is symptomatic of how nearhe came and thus how great was his failure, a result here addressed in anunspoken gesture—his lowering his head while holding back his tears. In the lastcanto, the newly arrived pilgrims looked up with hope (“la nova gente alzò lafronte” [the new people raised their faces]). The words describing Virgil’ssilence echo key words from that passage in a contrastive spirit (as noted byHoll.1990.1, p. 36): “e qui chinò la fronte, / e più non disse, e rimaseturbato” (and here he lowered his brow, said nothing more, and seemeddisturbed). As Benvenuto would have it, it is as though Virgil were saying: “Andwoe is me, I was among their number.”The words in rhyme position in these two tercets underline their message:[../images/00009.jpeg]One way leads up through faith to Christian truth, mediated by the mortal womanwho gave birth to God in the flesh, the other down from this potentialhappiness, through rational attempts to know the rationally unknowable, toeverlasting unhappiness. Mary and Plato are here the very emblems of the choicesthat we humans face. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s15-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c03-s15-i]]46–48. [part0009.html#c03-s16-e] There is a sharp dividing line between theelegiac passage devoted to Virgil’s consideration of his failure (vv. 22–45) andthe scene that begins here, with the description of the sheer wall of themountain and the first attempt at an ascent. For an appreciation of thenonetheless unitary nature of this canto as a whole, see Binni (Binn.1955.1), p.9. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s16-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c03-s16-i]]49–51. [part0009.html#c03-s17-e] Lerici and Turbia are settlements at eitherend of the Ligurian coast, to either side of Genoa, a region marked by ruggedmountains sloping to the sea and, in Dante’s roadless day, difficult of access.[return to English [part0009.html#c03-s17-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c03-s17-i]]52–57. [part0009.html#c03-s18-e] Virgil’s question and attitude reveal a guidewho has not taken this trip previously, as he had in Inferno. Further, while hefalls back on the resource of his reason, the futility of which in certainsituations has just been explored by the guide himself, his pupil, like thearriving penitents in the last canto (see note to vv. 40–45, above), does theintuitive and hopeful thing: he looks up. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s18-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s18-i]]58–60. [part0009.html#c03-s20-e] Having begun their attempt to ascend, Virgiland Dante begin moving leftward out of habit, we must assume. (They will onlylearn what direction they should be moving in at verse 101.) Our first glimpseof the souls of ante-purgatory marks them as unexcited and slow-moving,attributes that will gain in meaning when we learn more about them.For helpful references to classical discussions of the morally charged nature ofthe directions of human movement (right, up, and ahead are all “good”; left,down, and behind are all “bad”) see Stabile (Stab.1983.1), pp. 145–49.

[part0009.html#c03-s21-e] Underlining the difference between theguide’s and the protagonist’s ways of proceeding, Dante’s remark, urging Virgilto look up, intrinsically reveals a reversal of roles, as was noted byMargherita Frankel (Fran.1989.1), pp. 120–21. It is not the master who is givinginstructions but the pupil; throughout the little scene that follows, one cansense Virgil’s effort to regain his attenuated authority.

[part0009.html#c03-s24-e] The souls are puzzled by what they see, twofigures moving in the wrong direction (to the left) on this holy mountain, asBenvenuto da Imola was perhaps first to suggest. Not only are they going in thewrong direction, they are also moving quickly, not at the reverential andthoughtful pace of penitence. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s24-e] /Italian [part0016.html#c03-s24-i]]73–78. [part0009.html#c03-s25-e] Virgil’s captatio benevolentiae (the attemptto capture the goodwill of one’s auditors) here, like the one he addressed toCato in the first canto (Purg. I.70–84), reveals, as Frankel has been perhapsalone in arguing (Fran.1989.1, pp. 122–24), another example of his notunderstanding his own limitations. His epigrammatic concluding utterance, thoughtaken in bono by commentator after commentator (and perhaps most pleasingly byBenvenuto, who goes on to claim that Dante himself was most prudent in using histime, so that he managed to get his Commedia finished before he died), shows himonce again getting things a bit garbled. The self-assured turn of phrase, “Themore we know, the more we hate time’s waste,” indicates that he is still withoutunderstanding of the positive aspects of not knowing, of not hurrying—twoaspects of the saved souls whom he addresses that, as the following simile willmake unmistakably clear, are praiseworthy in the Christian context of thisscene. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s25-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c03-s25-i]]79–87. [part0009.html#c03-s27-e] The sole extended comparison of the cantocenters attention on the need for faith untroubled by reason. These sheep,following and imitating their bellwether, are presented positively for theirhumility and faithfulness. See Lansing (Lans.1977.1), pp. 47–53, for adiscussion of this simile, contrasting the humility exemplified here in Manfred(whom we shall soon come to understand is the “bellwether” in the simile), whoselife was marked by the opposite vice, presumption, in his opposition to theChurch. In one of his typical outbursts against his intellectual enemies inConvivio, Dante calls them stupid and compares them to sheep (I.xi.9–10), thosesheep that follow their leader in jumping into a ravine a mile deep (is thatphrasing, “mille passi,” remembered in the same phrase at verse 68, above?Frankel [Fran.1989.1], p. 124, is of that opinion). Citation of this passage inConvivio was perhaps first brought into play by Daniello (1568), but it is onlyrecently that readers have begun to understand that the ovine images in thissimile work against the assertion found in the Convivial outburst. Its prideful,even presumptuous, tone is here countermanded by the poet’s better understandingof the virtues of sheep, as the arrogance of prideful philosophizing gives wayto Christian piety.In his commentary to this passage, Singleton notes the appropriateness of the77th Psalm (Psalm 77 [78]:52), recapitulating the Exodus with these words: “But[God] made his own people go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wildernesslike a flock.” It seems clear that such traditional Judeo-Christian images ofthe flock of the just govern this simile.

[part0009.html#c03-s31-e] If we had not sensed the importance of humbleacts committed by those “not knowing why” in verse 84, the fact that the souls,now described directly, repeat what had been done within the simile reinforcesthe importance of the point.

[part0009.html#c03-s34-e] The saved souls now express their concern:Dante and Virgil are heading in the wrong direction (see Fran.1989.1, pp.121–22). They are thus aesthetically and morally disturbing as newcomers topurgatory.The gesture that they make is puzzling to American readers, who give the signfor “Stop!” or “Go back!” by extending their palms outward. As Lombardi (1791)calmly points out, “The gesture referred to here by the poet is exactly the onewith which we signal to others that they should turn and retrace their steps.”Experience on Tuscan streets and paths even today will verify this. [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c03-s34-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s34-i]]103–105. [part0009.html#c03-s35-e] Manfred died (February 1266) some eight ornine months after Dante was born. His question is thus groundless,notwithstanding the exertions of commentators like Tommaseo (1837), Andreoli(1856), and Poletto (1894), who argue that Dante, as a deeply thoughtful man,looked old for his age. The utterly human perception that lies behind the poet’slending Manfred this question is that the great and famous are used to beingrecognized, and often assume that everybody has seen them, even if theythemselves tend to have small recollection of the many whom they haveencountered. On the other hand, his question may also be a hopeful one, i.e., ifthis living soul happens to recognize him, Manfred hopes that he will causeothers to pray for him—see Purgatorio V.49–50, where other late-repentant soulsmake similar requests. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s35-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c03-s35-i]]107–108. [part0009.html#c03-s36-e] The “realism” of the detail of this scarredeyebrow has drawn much admiration. Singleton’s comment (1973) cites Augustine,De civ. Dei XXII.xix.3: “For, in the martyrs, such wounds will not be adeformity; they will have a dignity and loveliness all their own; and, thoughthis radiance will be spiritual and not physical, it will, in some way, beamfrom their bodies.” He goes on to suggest that Manfred, though excommunicated bythe Church, nonetheless is treated here as a sort of martyr, “persecuted” bythat very Church.While a number of antecedents for Manfred’s physical appearance have beenproposed (e.g., David, Roland, Virgil’s Marcellus), one seems most likely tohave been on Dante’s mind: the tragic figure of Deiphobus (Aen. VI.495–499), whoattempts to hide his wounds from Aeneas, his mangled ears and his nose (“truncasinhonesto volnere naris” [his nostrils laid bare by a shameful wound—VI.498]).Deiphobus, desiring not to be recognized by his wounds, is, in thisunderstanding, a foil to Manfred, eager to display the wound in his chest.Perhaps the first commentator to note this correspondence was Mattalia (1960);and see Hollander (Holl.1984.4), p. 119. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s36-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s36-i]]111. [part0009.html#c03-s37-e] Manfred’s second wound (the poet will insist onthe importance of the fact that he has two visible wounds in verse 119), perhapsreminiscent of the wound in Christ’s side (John 19:34; 20:25), causes the readerto consider the possible significances of these two marks on his body. Perhapswe are to understand that the first wound, in his brow, traditionally and inDante the locus of pride (see Inf. X.45 and XXXIV.35 and notes), is the sign ofhis pride brought low, his mark of Cain, as it were, now made good in hisgesture of revealing his other wound, his mark of Christ, the seal of hishumility. Torraca (1905) is nearly alone in seeing the resemblance, antitheticthough it be, between the gestures of self-revelation in displaying wounds foundin Manfred here and in Mohammed (Inf. XXVIII.29–31). [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s37-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s37-i]]112. [part0009.html#c03-s38-e] Manfred’s smile is part of a “program” ofsmiling found in the two final cantiche (see note to Purg. II.83). His way ofnaming himself seems to be part of a program limited to the ante-purgatory, theonly part of the poem in which characters name themselves using this formula(“io son” followed by their own name). Manfred’s smiling self-identificationstands out from the evasive behavior in this regard exhibited by most of thesinners in hell. For the others who employ this formula see Purgatorio V.88(Buonconte da Montefeltro), VI.34 (Sordello), VII.7 (Virgil). In the lesspersonal exchanges in Paradiso only St. Bonaventure uses a version of it: “Ioson la vita di Bonaventura.…” There the great Franciscan identifies himself as aliving heavenly soul.Born ca. 1231, Manfred was the illegitimate son of the emperor Frederick II andBianca Lancia, and thus the natural grandson of Emperor Henry VI and Constanceof Sicily. He was also the father, by his wife Beatrice of Savoy, of Constance,who married King Peter III of Aragon (see vv. 115–116). When Frederick died in1250, Manfred was appointed regent of Sicily in the absence of his brother,Conrad IV, involved elsewhere. When Conrad died, in 1254, leaving the realm tohis three-year-old son, Conradin, Manfred again became regent. At the rumors ofthe child’s death, in 1258 (he would in fact survive another ten years), Manfredwas crowned king in Palermo. This did not sit well with the pope, and AlexanderIV excommunicated him in 1258, as did Urban IV in 1261. Urban offered thevacated forfeited crown to Louis IX of France who, refusing it, opened the pathto an invitation of Charles of Anjou, who accepted. Once Charles was crowned inRome in January 1266, he set out to destroy Manfred, an aim that he accomplishedthe next month at the battle of Benevento. A lover of the “good life” at court,a fervent Ghibelline, a man charged (whether correctly or not) with a number ofmurders of his cofamiliars, supposedly undertaken to advance his politicalhopes, Manfred was not, at least not in Guelph eyes, a selection for salvationthat could have been calculated to win sympathy to the work that contained suchnews. It is at least reasonable to believe that the first damned soul we see inhell is Celestine V (see note to Inf. III.58–60), a pope of saintly habits; herethe first soul we find saved on the mountain is the excommunicated Manfred.Whatever else Dante enjoyed doing as he wrote this poem, he clearly delighted inshocking his readers—as though the salvation of Cato, with which the canticabegins, were not incredible enough for us.On the problems raised for commentators by the salvation of the excommunicatedManfred see La Favia (LaFa.1973.1), who points out that a letter of PopeInnocent III dating from 1199 fully supports the notion that an excommunicatecan eventually be saved, a position, as he demonstrates, that was not nearly asshocking to Dante’s earliest readers as it would later become. La Favia producesthe key portion of that Latin text (pp. 87–88). [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s38-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s38-i]]113. [part0009.html#c03-s38-e] Manfred does not identify himself as hisfather’s son (Frederick II is, after all, condemned to hell for heresy: Inf.X.119) but by reference to his paternal grandmother, Constance (1154–98). AsBenvenuto uniquely (among the early commentators) points out, Dante has borrowedthis tactic from Polynices who, questioned about his lineage by the king ofArgos, Adrastus, in Statius’s Thebaid, prefers to omit the name of Oedipus infavor of that of his mother, Jocasta (I.676–681). [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s38-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s38-i]]117. [part0009.html#c03-s39-e] The poet’s self-awareness is unmistakable here.Hardly anyone in his time would have consented to the notion that Manfred hadbeen saved. He places this reference to the imagined dubiety of those who mighthear such news (i.e., by reading Dante’s poem) in the mouth of his character andit is our turn to smile. Yet we can imagine how many Guelphs and churchmen wouldhave fumed at this passage, adamant in their vehement and unflagging belief thatManfred had been damned. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s39-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c03-s39-i]]121–123. [part0009.html#c03-s41-e] The sinners in hell, we must assume, failedexactly to do, even at the last moment of their lives, what Manfred did. Whilehe is held back from purgation for the insubordination that resulted in hisexcommunication, he, too, is a late-repentant saved soul. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s41-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s41-i]]124–129. [part0009.html#c03-s42-e] The archbishop of Cosenza, in Calabria,enlisted by Pope Clement IV in his battles against Manfred’s Ghibellines, wasresponsible, at the end, for disinterring his corpse, buried under the cairn ofstones piled upon his body by Guelph troops after the battle of Benevento.There is some dispute as to the precise meaning of the word faccia here. Does itmean “face” or “page”? For the former, see Freccero (Frec.1986.1), p. 206. For“faccia” as page, see Frankel (Fran.1984.1), p. 107. The page in God’s writingindicated here is perhaps found at Apocalypse 20:12, the reference to the Bookof Life, in which are recorded the names of the saved, including, we mustreflect, that of Manfred. However, three particulars lend support to those whoargue for “page,” faccia as an apocopation of facciata: (1) While most of theearly commentators are vague in their readings of this verse, those who wrote inthe Renaissance and after tend to find this interpretation more natural; (2)although modern commentators mainly prefer “face,” they do so without the sortof convincing argument that might conclude the debate; (3) the archbishop ofCosenza, we might reflect, obviously had no direct experience of God’s presence(at least not in Dante’s mind), but he surely did have some kind of access tothe Scripture, although he evidently—at least in Dante’s eyes—understood itpoorly.

[part0009.html#c03-s44-e] After Tommaseo (1837) many modern commentatorssuggest that there is a reference here to Virgil’s Palinurus (Aen. VI.362):“Nunc me fluctus habet versantque in litore venti” (Now the waves have me andthe winds hurl me onto the beach). See notes to Purgatorio V.91–93 and VI.28–33.[return to English [part0009.html#c03-s44-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c03-s44-i]]131–135. [part0009.html#c03-s44-e] Adding insult to the injury ofdisinterment, the archbishop ordered Manfred’s remains to be cast back into theworld. They had first at least been allowed burial in unconsecrated ground withthe ceremony prescribed for the excommunicate (“with torches quenched”). And sothe corpse is put out of the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily onto a bank of theriver Verde, today the Liri.The name of the river, Verde (green), however, stands intrinsically opposed tosuch purpose, since it both traditionally represents the virtue of hope andhappens to have been the color that Manfred himself favored. And thus theidentical rhyme “Verde/verde” underlines the hopeful sign that Manfred’s faithbelieved would come and his love longed for. The Church’s human agents may notunderstand God’s hidden disposition.The final phrase here, “ha fior del verde,” has caused much difficulty. Lombardi(1791) paraphrases the passage as follows: “so long as death does not entirelydry up hope, but leaves a single thread of it green.” [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s44-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c03-s44-i]]139. [part0009.html#c03-s47-e] For a possible precursor for this period ofdelay see Aeneid VI.325–30, the one hundred years of wandering exacted of thesouls of the unburied dead before they are permitted to cross Acheron, aconnection perhaps first suggested by Daniello (1568). But this does not explainDante’s choice of the number thirty. It is not until the twentieth century thatone finds a commentator wondering about the possible reasons for this choice:Grandgent (1909): “Why thirty? See E. G. Gardner in the Modern Language Review,IX, 63. In Deut. xxxiv, 8, we read: ‘the children of Israel wept for Moses inthe plains of Moab thirty days.’ Hence the early Christian practice of sayingprayers for the dead for thirty days after decease. Out of this grew the‘Trental of St. Gregory,’ or thirty masses on thirty feast days through theyear.” Trucchi (1936) resuscitates a previously unnoted observation of Francescoda Buti, recalling the tale told by Gregory the Great in his Dialogues: theghost of a monk named Justus who, buried excommunicate for having fatheredchildren, was redeemed when thirty masses said by Gregory set things right.Another analogue, offered by a Princeton student, Gerald Dal Pan ’82, in anexamination paper in 1980, is worthy of discussion: the thirty years of Jesus’slife before he was baptized and entered by the Holy Spirit, when He took on hismission in the world (Luke 3:25).Torraca (1905) suggests that Manfred lived nine years under the ban ofexcommunication and thus had a sentence of 270 years in ante-purgatory when hedied in 1266, thus leaving him 236 years to wait before commencing hispurgation. However, since Dante’s poem surely brought a storm of prayers toHeaven, he may have finished his penitential waiting much earlier than that.[return to English [part0009.html#c03-s47-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c03-s47-i]]143. [part0009.html#c03-s48-e] The third cantos of both Purgatorio andParadiso are centrally involved with two women known as “Constance,” here thegrandmother and daughter of Manfred, there Piccarda Donati, whose name as a nunwas Constance, and the other Constance, also a nun, who accompanies her when thetwo of them appear to Dante in the sphere of the Moon.For a bibliography of discussions of this canto see Scorrano (Scor.2000.1), pp.69–71. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s48-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c03-s48-i]]PURGATORIO IV1–15. [part0009.html#c04-s1-e] This complex opening passage has its roots inclassical and Scholastic discussions of the nature of the human soul.Commentators indicate passages known to Dante in Plato (Timaeus, putting forth abelief that there are three independent souls in man, a belief found also, inslightly different form, in the Manichees, and then repeated in Averroës), inAristotle (De anima, arguing against Plato for a single soul, not a plurality ofthem), Albertus Magnus (De spiritu et respiratione), and Aquinas (Summatheologica, Summa contra Gentiles, and commentary on De anima) as these arereflected in Dante’s Vita nuova (II.4–5—see DeRo.1980.1, pp. 31–32), De vulgarieloquentia (II.ii.6) and Convivio (III.ii.11–16). For some of these texts seeSingleton’s commentary (1973).Following Aristotle and Aquinas, Dante believed that there was but a single soulin man, divided first into three faculties or powers (with this meaning, Danteuses, synonymously, the words virtù or potenze—he uses both of them in thispassage): the vegetative (governing physical growth), the sensitive (governingthe feelings), and the rational or intellective (governing thought). These arepresented by Dante (Conv. III.ii.11) as “vivere, sentire e ragionare” (the forceof life, of the senses, of the reason). Considering what happened within himselfso that, absorbed by the words of Manfred for over three hours (50 degrees ofthe sun’s ascent), he could so lose track of time, Dante uses the evidence ofhis senses to argue, as Aquinas had done before him, that the very fact thatparts of the soul cease their function when one of them is fully enjoined provesthat we have not a plurality of souls, for these would simply continue tofunction independently at all times. That is, had Dante’s rational soulfunctioned unimpaired, he would have noted the passage of time even as helistened to Manfred.The three faculties are all further divided into subsets, the sensitive soulinto two, one of these including the five senses, and it is to this set (thesenses of hearing and of sight) that Dante adverts here. See the commentary ofDaniello (1568) to this passage and the discussion of virtù by Philippe Delhayeand Giorgio Stabile in ED, V (1976), pp. 1050–59, esp. pp. 1053–55.Singleton suggests that the apparently forced diction, regarding an ability tohear the passage of time, in fact refers to the sound of bells, the primarymeans of telling time in the Middle Ages.

[part0009.html#c04-s6-e] This “flock of sheep” was made aware ofDante’s desire to move upward in the last canto (verse 99).

[part0009.html#c04-s7-e] A pseudosimile only because its formalgrammatical relations (e.g., “just as … so”) are not expressed, these versesreturn to the countryside and the “humble style” that Dante has deployed in manyof his similes in Inferno and that typified the sole simile found in thepreceding canto (vv. 79–87). The farmer fixes his hedge, by filling holes in itwith thorns, when the grapes come ripe so as to protect his vineyard fromthieves. Steiner (1921) was perhaps the first commentator to note the referenceto Matthew 7:14: “Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadsto life, and there are few that find it.” [return to English[part0009.html#c04-s7-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c04-s7-i]]26–28.

[part0009.html#c04-s14-e] Beginning with Benvenuto da Imola there hasbeen a small battle over the reference here. Is it to geometry, the line drawnfrom the apex of the triangle formed by bisecting the right angle of a quadrantof a circle? Or is it (as Benvenuto strongly believed) to the astronomicalinstrument, the quadrant, which is so called because it replicates precisely aquadrant of a circle? In either case the angle of ascent is even greater than 45degrees. [return to English [part0009.html#c04-s14-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c04-s14-i]]50. [part0009.html#c04-s17-e] It is no wonder, given the steepness of theslope, that Dante completes this part of the ascent by crawling on his hands andknees (carpando).

[part0009.html#c04-s18-e] This brief respite may, at leastintrinsically, bring to mind the antithetic figure of Ulysses. Where he left theeast behind him (Inf. XXVI.124) and always ventured forward, Dante now looksback to the east, whence the sun had risen. The eastern sky, locus of thesunrise, has a long tradition in Christianity of representing Jesus, the “lightof the world” (John 8:12; 9:5). [return to English [part0009.html#c04-s18-e] /Italian [part0016.html#c04-s18-i]]55–57. [part0009.html#c04-s19-e] Pietro di Dante (1340) was the first to cite,as a source for this detail, a passage in Lucan (Phars. III.247–248), whereArabs, coming south of the equator, marveled at the fact that the shadows oftrees fell to their right, not to their left. Trucchi (1936) reminds the readerthat, here in purgatory, levante, the place where the sun rises, is not east butwest—from our perspective in the northern hemisphere.Dante offers a more extended and entirely similar discussion of these matters inConvivio III.v.13–17. [return to English [part0009.html#c04-s19-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c04-s19-i]]58–60. [part0009.html#c04-s20-e] Aquilone (line 60 in the Italian) is thenorth wind. The tercet repeats the protagonist’s amazement upon seeing themorning sun to his left. The reader needs to understand that the poet imaginesan “ideal” left and right in this and other particulars. That is, two peoplefacing one another, in either hemisphere, would each claim that the sun is tothe other hand. In the astronomical givens of the poem, above the Tropic ofCancer the sun is to the south of the imagined observer, to his or her right;“below” the Tropic of Capricorn (this is a northernizer’s view, it should benoted) it is to the north, or left. Substituting “north” for “left” and “south”for “right,” the reader may find this passage more readily understandable.[return to English [part0009.html#c04-s20-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c04-s20-i]]61–66. [part0009.html#c04-s21-e] Virgil’s explanation of the position of thesun in the morning sky may be paraphrased as follows: If the sun (the mirror),which moves from one side of the equator to the other, were in the constellationGemini (Castor and Pollux, the celestial twins) and not Aries (where it isnow—see Inf. I.37–40), Dante would see the sun’s path (the red part of thezodiac) as close to the Bears (Ursa Major and Ursa Minor) and thus as far northas it ever gets (at the summer solstice, 21 June). It would do this, Virgiladds, in an apparently gratuitous detail (but see the next passage), unless itwere to veer from its ordained path (which of course it will not in any normalexpectation).“Zodiac, a belt of the heavens eighteen degrees in breadth, extending ninedegrees on either side of the Ecliptic, within which, according to the Ptolemaicsystem, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn performtheir annual revolutions. It is divided into twelve equal parts of thirtydegrees, called signs, which are named from the constellations lying withinthem” (T). [return to English [part0009.html#c04-s21-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c04-s21-i]]67–75. [part0009.html#c04-s23-e] Having made this much clear, Virgil goes onto offer Dante a “thought experiment” that in fact exactly replicates what was,in Dante’s time, considered geographical actuality. For Dante, Jerusalem, uponthe hill Zion, and the mount of purgatory are precisely antipodal and share acommon horizon (the equator). From this “experiment” it quickly becomes clearthat the path of the sun (the “highway” that Phaeton flew off when he lostcontrol of the chariot of the sun—see note to Inf. XVII.106–108) must passbeneath (south) of Jerusalem and (in once more northcentric thinking), above(north) of the mount of purgatory. And thus we understand why Dante wassurprised at the sun’s leftness and why he should not have been.The reference to Phaeton, now making clear the reason for the inclusion ofreference to the possibility of the sun’s not keeping its ordained path, is partof a “Phaeton program” in the poem (see Brow.1984.1). As Brownlee points out,Phaeton’s presumptuous and failed heavenly voyage is set against Dante’sordained and successful voyage to the otherworld.

[part0009.html#c04-s26-e] The protagonist’s rephrasing of what he haslearned from Virgil is, one must admit, easier to grasp quickly than themaster’s presentation of it.

[part0009.html#c04-s29-e] It is interesting that, in a canto in whichthe primary new character is the extremely lazy Belacqua, the protagonist is sostrongly presented as wanting to rest—perhaps more so than in any other part ofthe poem (but see Inf. XXIV.43–45). [return to English [part0009.html#c04-s29-e]/ Italian [part0016.html#c04-s29-i]]98–99. [part0009.html#c04-s33-e] The voice that breaks into what has by nowbecome, for most readers, a rather labored and even fussily academic discussionwill turn out to be that of Belacqua. Named only at verse 123, he was a“Florentine, contemporary of Dante, said by the old commentators to have been amusical instrument-maker; modern research has suggested his identification withone Duccio di Bonavia” (T). According to Debenedetti (Debe.1906.1), Belacqua wasdead before March 1302 but still alive in 1299. In other words, like Casella, hewould seem to have been, in Dante’s mind, a recent arrival.His ironic and witty response to the conversation he has overheard immediatelywins the reader’s affection. (But, for a denial that this speech of Belacqua’sis in fact ironic, see Petrocchi [Petr.1969.1], pp. 270–71.) For a moment wefeel drawn out of the moralizing concerns and serious tones of the two poets.Manica (Mani.2000.1), p. 35, calls attention to the great importance of Dante’sBelacqua to Samuel Beckett’s fiction. According to him, Belacqua becomes acontemporary myth of irony rather than a depiction of the loss of will; however,he may not sense how much of the Beckettian view of Belacqua is already presentin Dante. Much of Beckett’s work is a kind of rewriting of the Dantean universefrom the point of view of Belacqua alone, a universe of waiting, boredom,question, and frustration, as in the early short story “Belacqua and theLobster” and certainly including the rock-snuggled hoboes of Waiting for Godot.For at least a moment in this extraordinary exchange, Dante’s Belacqua seems tocontrol the situation. Of course he will have to be swept aside in the name ofprogress toward a Christian goal. But it is astounding (and heartwarming) to seehow greatly Dante empathized with this character we like to imagine as being soantipathetic to him.His first word, “perhaps,” immediately reveals his character as beingindecisive, at least where goals or noble purposes are concerned; what followsshows his wit, deftly puncturing the balloon of Dantean eagerness (for he is aman who longs to do some serious sitting—see verse 52, where he accomplishesthat goal). As we shall see, Dante will fight back, and we will then have ascene that is reminiscent of the back-and-forth between Farinata and Dante inInferno X. [return to English [part0009.html#c04-s33-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c04-s33-i]]105–111. [part0009.html#c04-s35-e] The word negghienza (indolence) begins asteady run of words expressing a desire not to do: lasso (weary—106), sedeva(was sitting—107), negligente (indolent—110), pigrizia (sloth—111). The wordsexpress the point of view of the protagonist, undoubtedly buoyed by his ownrecent enthusiasm for spiritual mountaineering, if perhaps convenientlyforgetting his recent fatigue—of which Belacqua will enjoy reminding him. Dantehas now returned Belacqua’s delicate barb with a rather hefty blow.The tenzone-like tone (see note to Inf. VIII.31–39) of jesting rivalry thatmarks the rest of this scene may have been previously set in real life. A talehas come down to us, first found in Benvenuto’s commentary (1380), yet almostalways cited by later commentators only from the Anonimo Fiorentino’s morepleasing account (1400). According to him, Dante frequently reproached Belacquafor his sloth. One day Belacqua quoted Aristotle (the seventh chapter of thePhysics, a passage also found in Monarchia I.iv.2): “The soul becomes wise whenone is seated and quiet.” To this Dante supposedly replied: “If sitting can makea man wise, no one is wiser than you.” [return to English[part0009.html#c04-s35-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c04-s35-i]]115–117. [part0009.html#c04-s39-e] Rather than what we might expect, acounterthrust from Dante, we receive the information that he now, with brotherlyaffection, recognizes this saved soul and approaches him, despite the physicaldistress he still feels from that energetic climb of his.

[part0009.html#c04-s41-e] The poet’s summarizing phrase puts histechnique of presentation of Belacqua into relief: lazy movements and curtspeech. In fact, Belacqua’s three laconic speeches spread over only five lines(98–99, 114, 119–120), and not even the full extent of these. They make him out,as Dante almost certainly knew him, a familiar figure: a person of littlephysical energy and of incisive, biting wit.

In what seems surprising length for solaconic a speaker (first three speeches, five lines; final speech, nine lines),Belacqua now reveals his other side, not that of a keen listener waiting for his“opponent” to fall into the net of his sharp wit, but of a lazy loser who can’tquite get himself organized. It is, the more we reflect upon it, something of amiracle that God chose him to join the elect in Heaven (as the protagonisthimself thought—see vv. 123–124).

XXVI.112),establishes the bond of genuine community among the saved, and we shall hear itused to address one’s fellow twelve more times in Purgatorio and five inParadiso.For an observation regarding the antithetic relationship between Belacqua andUlysses see Frankel (Fran.1989.1), pp. 125–26.Does it seem that Belacqua does not realize that Dante is still in the flesh,merely assuming that he and Virgil are headed up the mountain to purgethemselves? It is possible to ask this question because, in this exchange, thereis no reference to Dante’s condition or to the identity or role of Virgil,subjects that have and will come up in other colloquies on the mountain.

[part0009.html#c04-s44-e] Where Manfred and his flock were eager tomove on to their punishment and probably have far longer to wait, Belacquaexhibits a slothful hesitance even to consider shortening his time here. As thefirst of the late-repentant, he here establishes the rule that applies to allwhom we meet in the remainder of ante-purgatory, that is, all between Cantos IVand VIII: there is a prescribed time of waiting for these former sinners, anequal amount to that which they spent unrepentant for their sins.

[part0009.html#c04-s44-e] Even his way of describing his last prayer,which in his view saved his soul, invokes a sense of laziness: it is composed,not of words, but of sighs, a lazy man’s prayer if ever there was one.

[part0009.html#c04-s45-e] Acknowledging that other “law” ofante-purgatory, of which we have heard from Manfred in the last canto (vv.138–141), Belacqua refers to the possibility that the sentences of thelate-repentant, like those of the excommunicate, may be shortened by the prayersof the living. His way of phrasing the possibility makes us tend to agree withhim that he will do the full term of his sentence, since it seems to himunlikely that any of his friends would seem to be possessed of “a heart thatlives in grace.” His speech trails off in dubiety; we reflect that his lastnegative words do not contain an appeal to Dante for help with the prayers ofthe living. It is no wonder that Beckett admired him so. He is the sole“Beckettian” character occupying a place in the purposeful and harmonious worldof purgation and salvation.

[part0009.html#c04-s46-e] Virgil has had enough of this, perhapsrevealing, in his stern tone, his own sense of the injustice of the salvation ofthe apparently undeserving Belacqua. His urgent summons to recommence thejourney upward, abruptly terminating Dante’s conversation with Belacqua beforeits formal conclusion (as Carroll [1904] observed), ends the canto with a noteof timeliness that the episode has disrupted. Belacqua, saved, has all the timein the world; Virgil, damned, does not. Life, or grace, does not always seemfair.It is now noon in purgatory and 6 PM in Morocco, across from Spain at Gibraltar.Since Purgatorio II.1–9, when it was dawn, the action on the mountain hasconsumed six hours (we learned that it was just after 9 AM at Purg. IV.15–16),just over two and a half of them spent in the difficult ascent and the meetingwith Belacqua. [return to English [part0009.html#c04-s46-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c04-s46-i]]PURGATORIO V1–3. [part0009.html#c05-s1-e] The canto begins with the protagonist’s forwardand upward propulsion but quickly reverses its sense of moral direction whenDante glances back, hearing the voice of one of the negligent behind him.[return to English [part0009.html#c05-s1-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c05-s1-i]]4–6. [part0009.html#c05-s2-e] Singleton (1973) argues that, because when Danteapproached these late-repentant souls in the previous canto the sun was beforehim (IV.101), his shadow now fell behind him and, for this reason (or because,as Grabher [1934] noted, in the shade of the boulder he was out of the sun), wasnot observed by the onlookers until now when, moving away from them, he cast ashadow at an oblique angle. The sun was to Dante’s left when he turned backtoward the east (IV.52–57); now as he heads west it is to his right, casting hisshadow to his left. (For the various moments in this cantica in which Dante’sshadow is remarked upon, see note to Purg. III.16–18.) [return to English[part0009.html#c05-s2-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c05-s2-i]]7–8. [part0009.html#c05-s3-e] Dante does not stop, but he does slow his paceas he looks back, as Virgil’s words will make clear (verse 11). [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c05-s3-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c05-s3-i]]9. [part0009.html#c05-s3-e] How is the reader meant to take the poet’sremembrance of his feelings at being recognized as a living soul? Was he guiltyof the sin of pride? Some unknown early readers believed so, as we know becauseBenvenuto tacitly but strongly rebukes them. In his view Dante’s excitement isnot that of self-congratulation, but rather of joy in his having been chosen byGod for this experience, exactly that feeling expressed by Paul when he said“thanks be to God I am what I am” (I Corinthians 15:10). Benvenuto’s disciple,John of Serravalle (1416), however, does indeed see the taint of vainglory inDante’s memory of the intense gaze of the penitent souls. [return to English[part0009.html#c05-s3-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c05-s3-i]]10–18. [part0009.html#c05-s4-e] Discussing this passage, Frankel(Fran.1989.1), pp. 127–30, points out that Virgil’s urgency in trying to getDante to resume his forward movement is not found in Virgil himself when heencounters Sordello in Purgatorio VII and much enjoys his fellow Mantuan’sinterest and praise. And while, beginning perhaps with Tommaseo (1837), therehave been other commentators who find Virgil’s scolding excessive, the factremains that the protagonist takes it most seriously (see vv. 19–21). Further,all that Virgil rebukes in Dante is his allowing his attention to wander,distracted by his admirers, from the prime purpose of the journey, i.e., he isacting to some degree like these negligent souls who were active Christians onlynear the end of their lives. [return to English [part0009.html#c05-s4-e] /Italian [part0016.html#c05-s4-i]]19–21. [part0009.html#c05-s7-e] Dante’s blush of shame clearly justifiesVirgil’s indignation: the protagonist has been thinking of himself too much. Andwith this detail, indeed, the poem resumes its forward thrust, begun at vv. 1–2,but interrupted for seventeen lines. [return to English [part0009.html#c05-s7-e]/ Italian [part0016.html#c05-s7-i]]23–24. [part0009.html#c05-s8-e] The new penitents enter singing the Psalm(50:1) that furnished the protagonist’s own first word in the poem (Inf. I.65),Miserere, the first word of David’s song of penance. Unlike the last group oflate-repentant souls, lounging in the shade of their rock, these are moving inthe same rightward direction that Virgil has urged Dante to follow. [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c05-s8-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c05-s8-i]]25–27. [part0009.html#c05-s9-e] It is noteworthy that these penitents behaveprecisely as did the negligent, showing their astonishment and curiosity atDante’s embodied presence in the sacred precinct of the saved. It is alsostriking that this time Virgil will offer no rebuke to Dante for his interest inthem, which will slow his forward movement. If one reflects that this encounteris part of the protagonist’s “education” on the mountainside, the apparentcontradiction begins to resolve itself. Dante’s previous interest was in thenegligent souls’ reaction to him, not in what he could learn from them. [returnto English [part0009.html#c05-s9-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c05-s9-i]]28–30.

[part0009.html#c05-s11-e] For all the asperity of Virgil’s response tothe “messengers,” it is clear that he is aware of and in favor of Dante’sability to help speed the progress toward purgation of these and other souls inante-purgatory (verse 36).

[part0009.html#c05-s18-e] As Chiavacci Leonardi (Chia.1994.1), pp. 143–44,points out, the phrase “sinners to the final hour” is probably meant to recallMatthew 20:1–16, the parable of the laborers in the vineyard, where even thosewho are summoned to work at the eleventh hour were paid the same as those wholabored all the day: “So the last shall be first, and the first last: for manyare called, but few are chosen” (20:16).

[part0009.html#c05-s20-e] Dante’s acquiescence in being willing tobring news of their salvations pointedly includes those whom he does not know,encouraging them to make a request that might, to them, have seemed too bold.The words he uses for these souls, “spiriti ben nati” (spirits born for bliss)contrast sharply with the formulation for those who were described as “mal nati”in Inferno (V.7; XVIII.76; XXX.48).

[part0009.html#c05-s22-e] The speaker, never identified by name, either inhis own speech of twenty-one lines (vv. 64–84) or by the narrator, is Jacopo delCassero, born ca. 1260. “He was among the Guelf leaders who joined theFlorentines in their expedition against Arezzo in 1288. He incurred the enmityof Azzo VIII of Este by his opposition to the designs of the latter uponBologna, of which city Jacopo was Podestà in 1296. In revenge Azzo had himassassinated at Oriaco, between Venice and Padua, while he was on his way (in1298) to assume the office of Podestà at Milan at the invitation of MaffeoVisconti. He appears to have gone by sea from Fano to Venice, and thence to haveproceeded towards Milan by way of Padua; but while he was still among thelagoons, only about eight miles from Venice, he was waylaid and stabbed” (T).Clearly Dante knew that he could count on Jacopo’s renown and on his readers’fairly wide acquaintance with the details of his life and death. [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c05-s22-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c05-s22-i]]69. [part0009.html#c05-s23-e] Jacopo refers to the Marches, the area betweenRomagna, to the north, and the kingdom of Naples, governed by Charles of Anjouin 1300, to the south.

[part0009.html#c05-s24-e] Should Dante ever find himself in Fano, in theMarch of Ancona, where Jacopo’s relatives and friends survive, his news ofJacopo’s salvation may, by causing them to pray for him, serve to shorten histime in ante-purgatory.

[part0009.html#c05-s25-e] Jacopo’s blood, of which we shall hear more inhis final lines, the seat of the soul (see Purg. XXV.37–45), left his bodythrough the wounds caused by the murderous Paduans who waylaid him in 1298.Padua was founded by Antenor, according to Virgil (Aen. I.242–249). Servius’scomment on these verses added the detail that Antenor, before he escaped fromTroy, had given the Greeks the Palladium, thus connecting him with betrayal ofone’s country (and suggesting to Dante a name, Antenora, for the second regionof the ninth Circle of hell, Inf. XXXII.88). [return to English[part0009.html#c05-s25-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c05-s25-i]]77–78. [part0009.html#c05-s26-e] Azzo VIII d’Este became marquis of Este in1293. Jacopo here would seem to be suggesting that the Paduans who killed himwere in cahoots with Azzo, the ringleader of the plot. Dante’s own formeropinion of Azzo was negative (see Dve I.xii.5, II.vi.4). Here Jacopo admits acertain culpability in having aroused Azzo’s wrath, reminding us that he has hadto forgive his slayer in order to have been saved. The commentator Jacopo dellaLana, in his gloss to vv. 70–72, gives some of the reasons for Azzo’s hatred ofJacopo. When Azzo wanted to make himself ruler of Bologna, the Bolognesi calledon Jacopo to be podestà of their city. In opposing Azzo he, according to thefourteenth-century commentator, was unceasing in his vilifications of his enemy,claiming, for instance, that he had slept with his stepmother and was in factthe son of a washerwoman.For the sin of wrath, in its hardened form, as a sin of will and not ofincontinence, see notes to Inferno VII.109–114 and XII.16–21 (last paragraph).Because Azzo was alive in 1308, Dante could not place him in hell; it seemslikely that he would have considered setting him down among the murderers in thecompany of his father, Obizzo, whom Azzo indeed, according to many commentators,strangled in 1293. See Inferno XII.111–112. [return to English[part0009.html#c05-s26-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c05-s26-i]]79–80. [part0009.html#c05-s27-e] Jacopo, reconsidering his actions, realizesthat he might have made good his escape had he proceeded west in the directionof Milano and headed for the town of La Mira, rather than stopping, off the mainroad, between Venice and Padua at Oriago. Benvenuto believes that he was onhorseback (as seems reasonable) and thus could have made his escape along thegood road to La Mira, while the swampy overgrowth made him easy prey for hisattackers, stalking him on foot, when he turned back to hide himself but wasseen and attacked.

[part0009.html#c05-s28-e] Fallen (from his horse?) and apparentlyhacked to death by those who pursued him on foot, Jacopo watches his blood (andthus his soul) pass from his body. [return to English [part0009.html#c05-s28-e]/ Italian [part0016.html#c05-s28-i]]88. [part0009.html#c05-s30-e] Buonconte da Montefeltro (ca. 1250–89) was theson of the great Ghibelline leader, Guido da Montefeltro (Inf. XXVII.19–132; andsee note to Inf. XXVII.4–6). “In June 1287 Buonconte helped the Ghibellines toexpel the Guelfs from Arezzo, an event which was the beginning of the warbetween Florence and Arezzo; in 1288 he was in command of the Aretines when theydefeated the Sienese at Pieve del Toppo; and in 1289 he was appointed captain ofthe Aretines and led them against the Guelfs of Florence, by whom they weretotally defeated (June 11) at Campaldino, among the slain being Buoncontehimself, whose body, however, was never discovered on the field of battle” (T).It is important to remember that Dante himself was present at this battle as acavalryman (see note to Inf. XII.75) in what was, for him and his fellowFlorentine Guelphs, a great victory. Once again we sense his ability to identifywith the loser (see note to Inf. XXI.95). There is not a trace of triumphalismin his exchange with the fallen leader of his enemies. [return to English[part0009.html#c05-s30-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c05-s30-i]]89–90. [part0009.html#c05-s30-e] Unlike Jacopo del Cassero, who hopes that hisrelatives and friends will pray for him (verse 71), Buonconte realizes that hiswife, Giovanna, and other family members have no concern for him. Unlike Jacopoand others of his band, he has been devoid of the hope that has urged the restto petition Dante for his aid. Now he finds hope in this visitor from the worldof the living. This poem, which summarizes its purpose as being to make theliving pray better (Par. I.35–36), nowhere better indicates this purpose than inante-purgatory in such scenes as these. It is undoubtedly the case that anynumber of people who read or heard the poem in the fourteenth century actuallyprayed for the souls of those whom Dante reports as needing such prayer. [returnto English [part0009.html#c05-s30-e] / Italian [part0016.html#c05-s30-i]]91–93. [part0009.html#c05-s31-e] Dante’s desire for knowledge of what happenedto Buonconte’s body reflects the concern of others present at the battle ofCampaldino. How could the body of so important a personage simply disappear?Several students of this passage have suggested that the poet here has in mindVirgil’s portrait of Palinurus, so deeply troubled by his unburied state, andconsider the protagonist’s question a recasting of Aeneas’s question toPalinurus: “Which of the gods, Palinurus, tore you from us and submerged you inthe open sea?” (Aen. VI.341–342). While the linguistic fit is not a perfect one,both the circumstance and the fact that Dante seems to have the Palinuruspassage in mind at Purgatorio III.130—and surely does so at VI.28–30—makes thereference at least plausible. Chiavacci Leonardi (Chia.1983.1), p. 88n., notedit, as now have Cioffi (Ciof.1992.1) and Stefanini (Stef.1995.1). And for theview that Palinurus operates as a foil to Buonconte, see Picone (Pico.1999.2),pp. 78–80. [return to English [part0009.html#c05-s31-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c05-s31-i]]94–99. [part0009.html#c05-s32-e] The Casentino lies in the upper valley of theArno. The torrent Archiano derives from sources above the valley near themonastery of Camaldoli, situated high in the mountains above the region. Thebattle of Campaldino took place on a plain below this higher valley and it isthe place to which Dante imagines the wounded Buonconte to have made his way,just where the Archiano joins the Arno, several miles above the site of thebattle. [return to English [part0009.html#c05-s32-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c05-s32-i]]104–108. [part0009.html#c05-s35-e] As commentators notice, the struggle of thegood and wicked angel over the soul of Buonconte mirrors the similar scene thatoccurs at the death of his father, Guido da Montefeltro (Inf. XXVII.112–117),when St. Francis and a fallen Cherub struggle for the soul of Guido. Not evenFrancis can prevail against God’s judgment—if we can accept Guido’s narrative atface value.A possible source for this scene is found in the Epistle of Jude (Iudae 9) in apassage that refers to the archangel Michael’s struggle with the devil for thebody of Moses. The relevance of this text to Dante’s was perhaps first noted byScartazzini in the 1870s. For discussion, see Pietropaolo (Piet.1984.1), whopoints out (p. 125) that, like Buonconte’s, the whereabouts of Moses’ actualburial place was not known (Deuteronomy 34:6).Buonconte’s tear (verse 107) reminds us of the similarly plangent Manfred (Purg.III.120).

For the complicated, necessarilyhypothetical, and eventually unknowable status of Pia’s identity and story andthe possible knowledge that Dante had of them, see Armour (Armo.1993.1), pp.120–22.

[part0009.html#c05-s45-e] Pia uses the “polite imperative,” i.e., theimpersonal subjunctive, to express her desire (i.e., “may it be remembered byyou”): she hopes to be remembered by Dante once he is back on earth so that hecan pray for her, as Vellutello (1544) suggests, or recall her to the minds ofothers for their prayers.

[part0009.html#c05-s45-e] This line, celebrated for its brevity andpower, has the lapidary quality of a headstone, perhaps because it representsone: the beginning of Virgil’s epitaph, “Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere.…”(Mantua gave me birth, Calabria took me off), as Gmelin (Gmel.1955.1) wasperhaps the first to suggest. See notes to Purgatorio III.27; VI.72. And seeHollander (Holl.1984.4), p. 119, n. 7.Armour (Armo.1993.1), p. 116, suggests that, if she was defenestrated by herhusband (or one of his agents), as many early commentators claim, then the hardearth of the Maremma actually did “undo” her, smashing her body when she hit it.[return to English [part0009.html#c05-s45-e] / Italian[part0016.html#c05-s45-i]]135–136. [part0009.html#c05-s45-e] These final verses of the canto have drawnnumerous attempts at a clear understanding. However, without knowing the precisenature of the facts to which Dante has decided to allude, we cannot be certain.Among the more interesting suggestions for a source is Hermann Gmelin’s(Gmel.1955.1): the verses reflect Dido’s remark about her dead husband,Sichaeus, at Aeneid IV.28–29: “ille meos, primus qui me sibi iunxit, amores /abstulit; ille habeat secum servetque sepulchro” (He, who first joined me tohim, has sealed up my love; may he have it with him and keep it in his grave).The italicized phrase seems close enough to Dante’s “colui che ’nnanellata pria/ disposando” to merit further thought, even if the contexts are not the same, asuffering wife and murderous husband replacing a loyal husband and a would-beloyal wife. Did Pia’s husband himself give her a ring of betrothal before theymarried or, as Varanini suggests, did the man who eventually killed her, therepresentative of her husband (one Magliata di Pionpino), present the ring forhim?

The three “autobiographies” that make up the last and largest part ofthis canto are strikingly similar in their construction (for a somewhatdifferent analysis of the structure of this “triptych” see Picone [Pico.1999.2],pp. 75–77), as the following table reveals. The central figure, Buonconte daMontefeltro, allows Dante the occasion to expand the model he had set forhimself in the case of Jacopo del Cassero, and then Pia de’ Tolomei offers anoccasion to restrict that model, refining it to the very nub of possiblecomposition in the form of a gesture that may remind contemporary readers of theminimalism found in the later works of Samuel Beckett.

[part0010.html#c06-s1-e] Frankel (Fran.1989.1), pp. 113–16, discussingthis opening simile, deploys the argument that the figure of the loser withinthe simile equates with that of Virgil in the narrative. That so reasonable aninterpretation took six and a half centuries to be developed is a mark of thecontinuing obstinately rosy view of Virgil and of his role in the poem among itsinterpreters. It was only in 1968 that any commentator tried to find acounterpart for the “loser”; Giacalone thinks he may correspond to Dante,because of the poet’s many troubles at the hands of his enemies. Yet it is hardto see how Dante can be both winner (to whom he is explicitly compared) andloser. Singleton (1973 [at verse 2]) offers the following pronouncement: “Thisfigure of the loser, though serving to make the whole scene more graphic, findsno correspondence in the second term of the simile.” He is in part correct: bothDante and the crowd of petitioners do correspond to figures within the simile(winner and the crowd of spectators, respectively); that the reference to Virgilis suppressed, inviting the reader to supply it, makes it all the more telling.For support for Frankel’s analysis see Hollander (Holl.1990.1), p. 31. Reviewingthe commentators, we are able to witness centuries of avoidance behavior (e.g.,Momigliano [1946]: the simile is produced “as a piece unto itself, with butslight regard for the context”).For information on the game of zara (from Arabic zahr, a die, through Frenchhazard and Provençal azar) see Singleton’s lengthy gloss in his commentary tothe opening verse of the canto. Similar to the modern game of craps, zarainvolved betting on the numbers, from 3 to 18, resulting from the cast of threedice. The numbers 3, 4, 17, and 18 were, like 2 and 12 in the modern game,“craps,” or zara, i.e., an undesirable result—unless the player called them outbefore he threw his dice. The game was apparently played by two players, as isreflected by Dante’s reference to only a single winner and loser in thispassage.At verse 8 the reference is to the reward the winner traditionally bestowed uponthe onlookers—a bit of his winnings (a practice found today in those at gamingtables who tip the croupier when they conclude their gambling happily).

They also,as Chiavacci Leonardi (Chia.1994.1), p. 173, points out, remind us, in theirviolent deaths, of the unsettled political condition of Italy (even though thelast of them, Pierre de la Brosse, is French), a subject that will dominate thefinal section of this canto.

[part0010.html#c06-s5-e] The Aretine is Benincasa da Laterina, “(in theupper Val d’Arno), a judge of Arezzo; according to the old commentators, whileacting as assessor for the Podestà of Siena, he sentenced to death a brother (oruncle) of Ghino di Tacco, a famous robber and highwayman of Siena; in revengeGhino stabbed him while he was sitting in the papal audit office at Rome,whither he had got himself transferred from Siena, at the expiry of his termthere, in order to be out of Ghino’s reach” (T). Jacopo della Lana says (comm.to vv. 13–14) that Ghino cut off Benincasa’s head in full view of the assembledpapal court of Boniface VIII (ca. 1297) and somehow managed to make good hisescape. Ghino di Tacco was of a Sienese noble family; exiled from his city, hebecame a famous highwayman. According to Boccaccio (Decameron X.ii), hisnobility of character eventually resulted in his reconciliation with PopeBoniface before both of them died (in 1303). In Dante’s reference to him herethere is no such positive treatment; Benincasa, not Ghino, is presented as beingsaved.

[part0010.html#c06-s5-e] This brief and unadorned reference is taken bynearly all the early commentators to refer to Guccio de’ Tarlati di Pietramala,a Ghibelline of Arezzo, who was in an attacking party against the Bostoli,Aretine Guelphs in exile at the fortified castle of Rondine. Some assert that,when the forces of the Bostoli counterattacked, Guccio galloped, on a runawayhorse, into the Arno, where he drowned. Others say that his death occurred whilehe was in pursuit of the enemy at that encounter. (The text would allow eitherinterpretation.) Still others claim that his death occurred during the rout ofCampaldino, shortly before the presence of the war party at Rondine, in 1289;but see the next note.

[part0010.html#c06-s6-e] Federico Novello, son of Guido Novello of theConti Guidi of Romena, in the Casentino (see note to Inf. XXX.58–61), died whenhe came to the aid of the Tarlati, besieging the Bostoli (see preceding note),ca. 1291. It would seem likely that Dante thought of both men as dying in thesame effort.The Pisan whom Dante observes is consistently identified as the son of Marzuccodegli Scornigiani, a widely known and respected judge of Pisa until the time ofUgolino’s joint rulership (with Archbishop Ruggieri—see note to Inf. XXXIII.1–3)in 1287. That Ugolino himself was involved in the political murder of Marzucco’sson is attested by various early commentators. Whether the execution (bydecapitation) was carried out under Ugolino’s direct orders or not, it occurredin 1287 when Ugolino had returned to Pisa as its coruler, and necessarily wouldhave, at the very least, suggested, in Dante’s view, Ugolino’s complicity.Evidence for Marzucco’s fortitude is ascribed to one of two anecdotes by theearly commentators: either he astounded Ugolino by his calm demeanor when he, nolonger a judge but a Franciscan novice, asked that the corpse of his son betaken up from the public square and buried (to which request the much impressedUgolino assented) or he exemplified Christian forgiveness in his decision not toseek revenge for the judicial murder of his son. Both anecdotes may, however, bepertinent. In 1286, before these events, Marzucco had ended his long anddistinguished career in Pisa as jurist (ca. 1249–86) to become a Franciscan andindeed eventually resided in the Franciscan house at Santa Croce in Florencefrom 1291 until his death in 1300 or 1301. It is possible that Dante knew himand heard of the events in Pisa and of Ugolino’s involvement in them directlyfrom “lo buon Marzucco” himself.

Like father, like cousin.The only non-Italian in the group, and the first of them to die (in 1278), isthe Frenchman, Pierre de la Brosse, “favorite and chamberlain of Philip III ofFrance. On the sudden death in 1276 of the heir to the throne, Louis, Philip’sson by his first wife, Isabella of Aragon, an accusation was brought against theQueen, Mary of Brabant, of having poisoned Louis in order to secure thesuccession of her own son, among her accusers being Pierre de la Brosse. Notlong afterwards Pierre was suddenly arrested and imprisoned by order of theKing. After being tried at Paris before an assembly of the nobles, he was hangedby the common hangman, June 30, 1278. The suddenness and ignominy of hisexecution appear to have caused great wonder and consternation, especially asthe charge on which he was condemned was not made known. According to thepopular account he had been accused by the Queen of an attempt upon herchastity. The truth seems to be that he was hanged upon a charge of treasonablecorrespondence with Alphonso X, King of Castile, with whom Philip was at war,the intercepted letters on which the charge was based having, it is alleged,been forged at the instance of the Queen” (T). Dante seems to have believed thecommon version of the story, which would put Mary of Brabant (in our day aprovince of Belgium) not in purgatory, where her victim has his victory, but inhell (probably in the last of the Malebolge along with Potiphar’s wife [Inf.XXX.97]) if she failed to repent her evildoing. Since she lived almost as longas Dante would (she died on 12 January 1321), one wonders if she became aware ofthis warning.

In Aeneid VI.376 the Sibyl answers Palinurus’s request of Aeneas that hehave his unburied corpse laid to rest by denying him such a hope: “desine fatadeum flecti sperare precando” (cease hoping that decrees of the gods may beturned aside by prayer). Does this answer compel us to believe that thepenitents are deluded in their hope for the efficacy of prayer? Dante’s questionis a necessarily tricky one for Virgil to have to deal with. See Hollander(Holl.1983.1), pp. 113–15. [return to English [part0010.html#c06-s10-e] /Italian [part0017.html#c06-s10-i]]34–42. [part0010.html#c06-s12-e] Virgil’s response seems casuistic, at leastin part. In order not to deny Christians’ belief in the efficacy of prayer, hefirst of all examines the notion that God’s will has been bent by the desires ofothers if such prayer be acted upon. If God’s will is won over in an instant bythe loving prayer of others, that is as He wills, and there is only an apparentinconsistency. He has merely accepted in immediate payment the “sum” offered onbehalf of the guilty party rather than insisting on an extended time of solitarypenance. It is a bit difficult to reconcile this formulation, however, with theactual words in the Aeneid, which seem far less accommodating than thisexplanation of them. When Virgil goes on to explain that, in any case, Palinuruswas not praying to the true God in the passage referred to in Book VI, ourcredulity is still more gravely tested. The statement of the Sibyl istotalizing, while Virgil now reconstructs it to have a meaning that it nevercould have had, i.e., some prayer is effective, some not. We witness anothercase in which the pagan author is forced to pay for his error in rather ungainlyways. Here Virgil confidently attacks inadequate Christian readings of theAeneid as though they were the source of the poem’s theological failure. “Plainis my writing” indeed!

[part0010.html#c06-s21-e] This figure will shortly (at verse 74) revealhimself to be Sordello, the thirteenth-century Italian poet, who wrote inProvençal. “Sordello was born (c. 1200) at Goito, village on the Mincio, about10 miles NW of Mantua; shortly after 1220 he was resident at the court of CountRicciardo di San Bonifazio of Verona, who had married (c. 1222) Cunizza,daughter of Ezzelino II da Romano (Par. IX.32). In or about 1226, Sordello, withthe connivance of her brother, Ezzelino III (Inf. XII.109–110), abductedCunizza, and took her to Ezzelino’s court. Later he formed a liaison with her,and, to escape her brother’s resentment, was forced to take refuge in Provence,where he made a lengthy stay at the court of Count Raymond Berenger IV (Par.IV.134). There he became acquainted with the Count’s seneschal, Romieu deVilleneuve (Par. VI.128). While in Provence (c. 1240) Sordello wrote one of hismost important poems, the lament for Blacatz, one of Count Raymond’s Provençalbarons, from which Dante is supposed to have taken the idea of assigning toSordello the function of pointing out the various princes in Ante-purgatory(Purg. VII.49–136). After Count Raymond’s death (1245) Sordello remained forsome years at the court of his son-in-law, Charles of Anjou (Purg. VII.113).When the latter in the spring of 1265 set out on his expedition to Italy to takepossession of the kingdom of Sicily, Sordello followed him.… Sordello was amongthose who shared in the distribution of Apulian fiefs made by Charles to hisProvençal barons after his victories over the Hohenstaufen at Benevento andTagliacozzo, to Sordello and his heirs being assigned several castles in theAbruzzi, under deeds dated March and June, 1269. No further record of Sordellohas been preserved, and the date and place of his death are unknown.… OfSordello’s poems some forty have been preserved, besides the lament for Blacatzalready mentioned, is a lengthy didactic poem, the Ensenhamen, or DocumentumHonoris” (T).Beginning perhaps with Torraca (1905), commentators have seen elements ofVirgil’s Elysian fields and the guide therein, the poet Musaeus (Aen.VI.666–678), in Dante’s presentation of Sordello. See Hollander (Holl.1993.1),p. 302.For Sordello’s “scandalous love life” see Bara´nski (Bara.1993.2), pp. 20–23 andnotes (for bibliography).

[part0010.html#c06-s22-e] The intensity of the first four sets ofencounters on the mountain has varied: the intense personalness of Manfred wascountered by the quizzical distance of Belacqua, which in turn was balanced bythe three intense self-narratives of Jacopo, Buonconte, and Pia. Sordello beginswith a Belacqua-like reserve, only to be roused to a pitch of excitement byVirgil’s revelation of his Mantuan homeland.

[part0010.html#c06-s24-e] The word “Mantua” may have been intended,according to Benvenuto da Imola (followed by John of Serravalle), as the firstword of Virgil’s own Latin epitaph, “Mantua me genuit.…” See notes to PurgatorioIII.27 and V.134.

[part0010.html#c06-s25-e] The civic patriotism of Sordello is awakenedwhen Virgil mentions their common homeland.

[part0010.html#c06-s26-e] This passage begins what Benvenuto considersthe third part of this canto, “a digression against Italy and the principalauthors of her desolation.” Dante himself at verse 128 refers to his“digression” here; but no one can possibly imagine that this “digression” is notcentral to his purpose. (On the subject of Dante’s propensity to digress seeCorsi [Cors.1987.1].) The poet will directly address Italy herself, the Church,the uncrowned Habsburg emperor Albert, God, and, finally, Florence.As has long been noted, the sixth canto of each cantica is devoted to thetreatment of political issues, those of Florence (Inf.), of Italy (Purg.), ofthe empire (Par.)—though these subjects are intertwined.

[part0010.html#c06-s26-e] Bernardino Daniello (1568) was apparently thefirst to notice the now often-cited biblical source for Dante’s phrase “donna diprovincie” (princeps provinciarum) in the Lamentations of Jeremiah 1:1: “Howdoes the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as awidow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces,how is she become tributary!” Jeremiah’s lament for Jerusalem had been a centralreference point for the death of Beatrice, recorded in Vita nuova XXVIII.1.[return to English [part0010.html#c06-s26-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c06-s26-i]]83. [part0010.html#c06-s28-e] The evident recollection of the central image ofUgolino’s punishment (Inf.

[part0010.html#c06-s30-e] The language here clearly derives fromDante’s earlier expression of these sentiments, as Andreoli (1856) was perhapsthe first to observe, in Convivio IV.ix.10: “Thus we might say of the Emperor,if we were to describe his office with an image, that he is the one who rides inthe saddle of the human will. How this horse pricks across the plain without arider is more than evident, especially in wretched Italy, which has been leftwith no means whatsoever to govern herself” (tr. Lansing).“Justinian, surnamed the Great, Emperor of Constantinople, A.D. 527–565. Duringhis reign the great general Belisarius overthrew the Vandal kingdom in Africaand the Gothic kingdom in Italy. Justinian, who is best known not by hisconquests but by his legislation, appointed a commission of jurists to draw up acomplete body of law, which resulted in the compilation of two great works; one,called Digesta or Pandectae, in fifty books, contained all that was valuable inthe works of preceding jurists; the other, called Justinianeus Codex, consistedof a collection of the Imperial constitutions. To these two works wassubsequently added an elementary treatise in four books, under the titleInstitutiones; and at a later period Justinian published various newconstitutions, to which he gave the name of Novellae Constitutiones. These fourworks, under the general name of Corpus Juris Civilis, form the Roman law asreceived in Europe” (T).The empty chariot of the empire is reflected in the similarly empty chariot ofthe Church in the procession of the Church Militant, beset by all its externaland internal enemies, in Purgatorio XXXII.

[part0010.html#c06-s31-e] The leaders of the Church are accused ofhaving interfered in the civil governance of Italy, trying to guide its affairsby manipulating its “bridle” without having allowed the horse’s rider to seathimself in the saddle. The passage may reflect Dante’s unhappiness either withthe intrigues of Pope Boniface VIII, maneuvering to bring about the accession ofAlbert in 1298, or with those of Pope Clement V, who managed to control theelection of the next emperor, Henry VII, after the death of “German Albert” in1308—or with both pontiffs’ involvements in imperial politics. The language herereflects the biblical text that had greatest currency in the antipapal politicalarguments of the time, apparently claiming an indisputable right to govern forthe monarch, Matthew 22:21: “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s,and to God the things that are God’s.” [return to English[part0010.html#c06-s31-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c06-s31-i]]97–102. [part0010.html#c06-s33-e] “German Albert, i.e. Albert I of Austria,son of Rudolf of Hapsburg, Emperor (but never crowned), 1298–1308; he waselected after having slain his predecessor, Adolf of Nassau, in a battle nearWorms, his treason against Adolf having been condoned by Boniface VIII inconsideration of the advantages of his alliance against the Pope’s mortal enemy,Philip the Fair of France. Dante … foretells his violent death (which took placeon May 1, 1308, when he was assassinated at Königstein, close to the castle ofHapsburg, by his nephew John)” (T). It is also possible that Dante had in mind,as punishment of Albert’s “blood,” the death of his firstborn son, Rudolph, in1307.The image of Italy as uncontrolled animal, which has been operative since verse89, now culminates in Sordello-like invective (see Perugi [Peru.1983.1]) againstthe Habsburg ruler.Dante’s post-eventum prophecy is clearly written after May 1308, but how muchlater? The really difficult problem facing anyone who wants to resolve thisquestion involves the identity of Albert’s “successor.” Is the reference simplyto any successor who will feel compelled by pressure to act in Italophile ways?Or does Dante have Henry VII of Luxembourg, elected in 1308, in mind? Variouscommentators (e.g., Tozer, Trucchi, Momigliano) argue for a date of compositionbetween 1308 and July 1310, when Henry finally announced his intention of comingto Italy, the “garden of the empire.” If such was the case, Henry had not yetbegun his descent into Italy (autumn of 1310) and the rather cool tone ofDante’s appeal for imperial action would make sense. For after the emperor’sadvent, Dante’s words about him are, at least at first (Epistle V, composed inthe last quarter of 1310) enormously warm and hopeful. We would then have threestages in Dante’s responses to Henry: (1) initial dubiety (1308–10), (2) greatexcitement as the campaign to put Italy under the governance of a true Romanemperor begins (1310–11), (3) eventual wary enthusiasm (see the two politicalletters written in the spring of 1311 [Epistles VI and VII]), given theprecariousness of Henry’s military and political situation (1311–13).

[part0010.html#c06-s40-e] The name “Jove” occurs variously in thepoem, nine times in all, but here alone does it refer only to the Christian God(God is referred to as Jupiter in Inf. XXXI.45 in a similar usage). Although thepoet realizes that his questioning of divine justice is out of bounds, hepersists in it.God’s plan for Italy, in any case, arises from his divine counsel, which isbeyond our knowing: see Psalm 35:7 [36:6]: “Iudicia tua abyssus multa” (Yourjudgments like the great deep), a citation first offered by Benvenuto da Imola.[return to English [part0010.html#c06-s40-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c06-s40-i]]124–126. [part0010.html#c06-s42-e] Lacking an emperor, Italy is governed bylocal tyrants, while every yokel who joins a political party fancies himself the“new Marcellus.” But which Marcellus? The debate continues. As Singleton pointsout, there were three contemporaneous Roman consuls named Marcellus and, amongthese, the most likely to be referred to here is Marcus Claudius Marcellus,consul in 51 B.C., and renowned for his hatred of Julius Caesar. It is possiblyhe to whom Lucan refers in De bello civili (I.313): “Marcellusque loquax et,nomina vana, Catones” (Marcellus, that man of words, and Cato, that empty name).This identification, which is supported by the majority of commentators (andgiven a magisterial first exposition by Benvenuto da Imola) and which apparentlymakes excellent sense in a context that certainly seems to inveigh againsthostility to the emperor, is at least problematic: Lucan’s words are part ofJulius Caesar’s infamous first speech to his troops, when he counsels theirmarch on Rome (see note to Inf. XXVI.112–113), and they also ridicule Cato theYounger, surely Dante’s greatest classical hero. In fact, the Lucanian Caesarunites Marcellus, Cato, and Pompey as three of his great enemies. Dante probablywould have felt that anyone claimed as an enemy by Julius, about to destroy theRoman republic, was his friend. It would be strange for Dante to lend himself toJulius’s view of these men, even if he defends the Caesarean inviolability ofthe eventual emperor and condemns Brutus and Cassius for murdering him. In anycase, it is perhaps wise to consider other alternatives. An early tradition heldthat the text read “Metellus” (see Purg. IX.138) and not “Marcellus,” but thispossibility is no longer seriously considered. One other Marcus ClaudiusMarcellus, however, is worthy of consideration. He was consul in 222 B.C.,successful in skirmishes against the great Hannibal, conqueror of Syracuse,welcomed back to Rome and referred to as “the Sword of Rome,” the best known ofall Romans of that name, and indeed mentioned in the Aeneid (VI.855) as one ofRome’s greatest warriors, presented in the parade of heroes described byAnchises as preceding that latter-day Marcellus, the Emperor Augustus’s adoptedand very mortal son. Vellutello (1544) and Tommaseo (1837) both think of theearlier Marcus Claudius as the Marcellus most likely to be mentioned here. Onepotential advantage of this solution is that it broadens the base of Dante’spolitical scorn: if the Marcellus is Lucan’s, then only Guelph bumpkins, hatingthe emperor, are indicated; if Virgil’s, then all enthusiastic amateurs, ofwhatever party, who think of themselves as great men.

[part0010.html#c06-s43-e] The fifth and final apostrophe is,naturally, of Florence herself, and is, naturally, dripping with sarcasm,reminiscent of the earlier apostrophe that opens Inferno XXVI, in which the cityis asked to rejoice in her renown for having produced so many thieves who nowdisport themselves in hell. For the supposedly “digressive” nature of Dante’sremarks, see note to vv. 73–75. [return to English [part0010.html#c06-s43-e] /Italian [part0017.html#c06-s43-i]]135. [part0010.html#c06-s45-e] The Florentine who shouts “I’ll take it on myshoulders” is not expressing his respect for civic virtue so much as masking hisintention to promote himself to “where the action is” under the guise of humbleservice.

[part0010.html#c06-s47-e] Dante’s sardonic streak is rarely moreevident than in this passage, in which the founding Western civic entities inGreece are seen by contemporary Florentines as pale and vapid precursors oftheir great city’s version of political excellence. The Florentines are so goodat governance, it seems, that they eschew any form of stability for rapidchange, whether in their laws, coins, civic offices, political customs, and evencitizenship, this last probably a reference to the sort of political act thatbanished the White Guelphs (including Dante) in 1302.

[part0010.html#c06-s49-e] The obvious sarcasm of the preceding seventercets in “praise” of Florence now yields to a devastating image of the city aswealthy invalid wife, which is possibly derived from Augustine’s Confessions(VI.16), as was perhaps first noted by Grandgent (1909). As Augustine nearsconversion, at the very end of the sixth book, his soul still struggles toescape from God, to be free for “better” things; he describes its inner state asfollows: “Whichever way it turned, on front or back or sides, it lay on a bedthat was hard, for in you alone the soul can rest.” [return to English[part0010.html#c06-s49-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c06-s49-i]]PURGATORIO VII1–3. [part0010.html#c07-s1-e] The “digression” that fills almost exactly halfof the last canto now yields to the continuance of the narrative that hadrelated the embrace between the two Mantuan poets at Purgatorio VI.75. Theformulation “a third time and a fourth” is, as has often been noted, Virgilian;since Scartazzini (1900) the reference is noted as being potentially triple:Aeneid I.94; IV.589; Georgics I.410. And Virgil, having been buffeted sounkindly in these early cantos of Purgatorio, is about to have his innings.Sordello asks about the provenance of both these travelers; once Virgilidentifies himself, the contemporary Mantuan poet completely loses track ofDante. But the ancient Mantuan poet does so as well. In all his discussion withSordello (VI.67–VIII.45) he never once refers to Dante as the reason for his ownjourney—as we have become accustomed to his doing (see Purg. I.52–69; III.94–99;V.31–33). It will only be in the next canto (VIII.62) that Sordello willunderstand that Dante is a living man. [return to English[part0010.html#c07-s1-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s1-i]]4–6. [part0010.html#c07-s2-e] The reference to the redemption of sinnerswrought by the Crucifixion seals Virgil’s sense of his own doom, his bonesburied (19 B.C.) during the rule of Augustus (63 B.C.–A.D. 14), whose reigncoincided with the birth of Jesus. [return to English [part0010.html#c07-s2-e] /Italian [part0017.html#c07-s2-i]]7. [part0010.html#c07-s3-e] This is the sole occasion on which Virgil nameshimself in the Commedia (his name occurs thirty-one other times), thus answeringin part Sordello’s questions at Purgatorio VI.70, concerning the homeland andidentity of these two travelers, one of which Virgil had already answered(“Mantua” at VI.72). [return to English [part0010.html#c07-s3-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c07-s3-i]]8. [part0010.html#c07-s3-e] To be without faith is to lack what is absolutelynecessary in order to “win” salvation. The Anonimo Fiorentino cites St. Paul:“without faith it is impossible to be pleasing to God” (Hebrews 11:6), a passageexplaining that Enoch was taken up alive into heaven because of his faith—aswill be Dante soon, and as Virgil was not. [return to English[part0010.html#c07-s3-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s3-i]]9–13. [part0010.html#c07-s3-e] The simile, another instance of what Tozercalls “similes drawn from mental experience” (see note to Inf. XXX.136–141),investigates the enormous pleasure of Sordello at meeting Virgil, a scene thatwill be reformulated for the meeting of Statius and Virgil in PurgatorioXXI.124–136. Sordello’s humility in lowering his brows (“e poi chinò le ciglia”)is verbally reminiscent, if antithetically, of Farinata’s pride (Inf. X.35:“s’ergea col petto e con la fronte” [was rising, lifting chest and brow]) andSatan’s effrontery (Inf. XXXIV.35: “contra ’l suo fattore alzò le ciglia”[raised his brows against his Creator]). But it may also remind us of Virgil’sown lowered brows when he is so filled with shame at his failure to believe inChrist to come (Purg. III.44: “e qui chinò la fronte”). [return to English[part0010.html#c07-s3-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s3-i]]15. [part0010.html#c07-s5-e] A small squall of disagreement disturbs the seaof commentary on this verse: does Sordello embrace Virgil just beneath hisarmpits? at the level of his thighs? at his knees? while lying prostrate at hisfeet? All four of these solutions continue to be put forward into the latetwentieth century, while many commentators have been content to suggest that itis impossible to know exactly where this embrace is aimed. Vandelli (1929)supports the most popular hypothesis: Sordello bends his knees slightly so as toembrace Virgil under his arms, where the figure of lesser authority embraces hissuperior. [return to English [part0010.html#c07-s5-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c07-s5-i]]16–18. [part0010.html#c07-s6-e] Virgil, apostrophized by Sordello both asforemost among all Latin poets and as his greatest townsman, is here cast as thefounder of all Romance poetry. The precise meaning of lingua nostra (ourlanguage) has been debated (see Mazzoni’s summary of the debate [Mazz.1977.2],p. 164), and includes a wide range of possibilities: all human vernacular; Latinalone; all poetry, vernacular and Latin; and vernacular that is specificallydeveloped from Latin. This last seems the most acceptable reading, making Latinthe “mother tongue” of the Romance vernacular poets, as would also seem to bethe case at Purgatorio XXI.94–99.

[part0010.html#c07-s7-e] Since Virgil has already (verse 8) confessed thathe has “lost heaven,” Sordello must assume that he is in hell. For a readingthat sees the implicit rebuke to Virgil in Sordello’s reference to his hellishsituation see Picone (Pico.1998.1), pp. 65–66. [return to English[part0010.html#c07-s7-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s7-i]]22–24. [part0010.html#c07-s8-e] Virgil’s rejoinder rather surprisingly makesno reference to any reason for his being chosen for this journey; it is thus notsurprising that Sordello believes his task is to guide Virgil, selected by God,to see these sacred precincts. Dante has become, temporarily, supernumerary.[return to English [part0010.html#c07-s8-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s8-i]]25–27. [part0010.html#c07-s9-e] In Purgatorio XXI.18, Virgil will make clearto Statius that he must return to hell. Here it is also clear that he considersLimbo his final resting place, but he says as much in ways that invitespeculation as to his possible salvation, since he claims now to know God and tohave been aided by Him in coming this far. The absence of reference to Virgil’sguidance of Dante allows Sordello to believe better of his townsman than thefacts warrant. [return to English [part0010.html#c07-s9-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c07-s9-i]]28–36. [part0010.html#c07-s10-e] The Roman poet puts the best possible faceupon his presence in Limbo, attempting to establish a sort of “innocence byassociation,” as it were, with the unbaptized infants and the other virtuouspagans. [return to English [part0010.html#c07-s10-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c07-s10-i]]40. [part0010.html#c07-s14-e] At least since 1340 and Pietro di Dante’scommentary it has been usual to cite Aeneid VI.673, “nulli certa domus” (no onehas a preordained home), as a gloss on this verse. These are the words spoken byMusaeus to the Sibyl, who has asked where Anchises dwells, only to be told thathe and the other virtuous souls live, free to roam, in the Elysian fields.Musaeus, like Sordello, offers to guide his charges up to see the assembledsouls. This entire scene is closely modeled on that one. [return to English[part0010.html#c07-s14-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s14-i]]44. [part0010.html#c07-s15-e] Sordello seems to indicate that there is a lawin ante-purgatory that prevents nocturnal movement upward. But see his furtherexplantion, vv. 53–60.

[part0010.html#c07-s16-e] Once again Sordello addresses only Virgil(and not Dante), and indeed, we can imagine, Virgil will enjoy seeing theseChristian souls who are so reminiscent of his virtuous denizens of the Elysianfields.

[part0010.html#c07-s17-e] Virgil, slow to understand the differencebetween external laws and inner will on this mountain, believes either thathellish demons would hinder a nocturnal climber or that such a climber would,with nightfall, lose his ability to ambulate upward.

[part0010.html#c07-s18-e] Sordello’s answer sets things straight: Thereare no external impediments and the inner will of the penitents makes them wantto stay where they are, lest they wander to a lower station on the mountain,which would not be fitting. It seems that there would be no actual penalty forsuch behavior, but that no one would ever want to descend in any case. The“rule” of the mountain is more aesthetic than moral, since no harm can befallany of these saved souls. In this “club,” no one would want to behave in sochurlish a fashion.

[part0010.html#c07-s22-e] Sordello will lead them among the soulsgathered in the place that has come to be known as the Valley of the Princes,not among the early commentators, but at least by the time of Andreoli (1856)and his commentary to Purgatorio IX.54. It furnishes a certain foretaste of thegarden of Eden, the pilgrim’s eventual purgatorial destination. [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c07-s22-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s22-i]]73–78. [part0010.html#c07-s25-e] Much has been written about these verses.Beginning with Sapegno (1955), commentators have suggested a source in a plazer(a lyric poem describing the beauties of a place, person, or object) by GuidoCavalcanti, “Biltà di donna,” verse 8: “Oro e argento, azzurro ’n ornamenti.”(For Dante’s earlier citation of this poem see note to Inf. XIV.30.) Dante isthus here understood to be joining the tradition of the plazer (cf. his ownearly poem, addressed to Cavalcanti, “Guido, i’ vorrei”) in describing thisparticular locus amoenus, the idealized “pleasant place” since the Greek idyllicpoems of Theocritus in classical antiquity. On a closely related theme seeGiamatti (Giam.1966.1). For consideration of the deep resonance of “Biltà didonna” in this passage see Pico.1998.1, pp. 70–72. Picone notes the way in whichDante’s description “outdoes” Guido’s by merit of its supernatural Christiancontent.For the emerald’s association with hope (and its presence in the rest of thepoem) see Levavasseur (Leva.1957.1), pp. 59–66. For the medieval lapidaries thatDante might have known see Cioffari (Ciof.1991.1). [return to English[part0010.html#c07-s25-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s25-i]]79–81. [part0010.html#c07-s27-e] The supernatural nature of this placeproduces colors and odors that transcend, in their intensity and ability to givesensuous pleasure, their counterparts in the most exotic “normal” natural loci.[return to English [part0010.html#c07-s27-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c07-s27-i]]82–84. [part0010.html#c07-s28-e] The souls of the princes of the world invokethe merciful Queen of Heaven, underscoring their present humility. The text ofthis Marian evening hymn includes the fitting verses “to you we send up oursighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.” Poletto (1894) noted theecho here of another part of the scene presided over by Musaeus in AeneidVI.656–658: the souls seated in the Elysian fields who sing songs of praise inthat fragrant place.For the association of the “Salve, Regina” with Compline see Heilbronn(Heil.1972.1), p. 50.

[part0010.html#c07-s29-e] The poet’s diction reminds us of the fact thatVirgil, the Mantuan, has temporarily been “demoted” in favor of Sordello.[return to English [part0010.html#c07-s29-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c07-s29-i]]87–90. [part0010.html#c07-s29-e] Here, too, the Aeneid (VI.754–755) makes itspresence felt, as Vellutello (1544) noted: Anchises stations himself on a highervantage point (with Aeneas and the Sibyl) so as to be able to discern the facesof those moving toward him in the pageant of Rome. [return to English[part0010.html#c07-s29-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s29-i]]91–94 [part0010.html#c07-s31-e]. For the structural and moral force ofSordello’s planh, or poem of lament, for the death of Blacatz reflected inDante’s composition of the rest of this canto see Picone (Pico.1998.1), pp.73–77.There are nine princes in the following “list,” all of them ticketed forparadise, as there were nine who were saved at the last moment in Cantos V andVI. Both these groups of late-repentant sinners, the first of whom have incommon death by violence, are seen as active (as opposed to the lethargic inCanto IV) in their attachment to the world. Rudolph of Austria, the only emperor(1273–91) in this group, father of the Albert so vilified in PurgatorioVI.97–102, is, however, censured most for his neglect of his Italian subjects.Rudolph “was born in 1218, and was the eldest son of Albert IV, Count ofHapsburg, and the founder of the imperial house of Austria. He first servedunder Ottocar, King of Bohemia, in his German wars, but in 1272, as he wasencamped before the walls of Basle, he received the news that he had beenelected Emperor, in preference to Ottocar and to Alphonso of Castile. Ottocarrefused to acknowledge him as Emperor, but Rudolf, supported by powerful allies,made war upon him and compelled him to sue for peace.… A few years later Ottocaragain rebelled, and was finally defeated and slain near Vienna, Aug. 1278.Rudolf allowed Ottocar’s son, Wenceslaus, to succeed to the throne of Bohemia,but Austria, Styria, and Carniola he granted to his own sons, Albert and Rudolf”(T).Given the recorded behaviors of Rudolph (and of others in this group) it issurprising that Dante was willing to publish their salvations—or the fact thathe even thought that they were saved. [return to English[part0010.html#c07-s31-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s31-i]]95–96. [part0010.html#c07-s32-e] Rudolph, had he served as he ought, mighthave spared Italy the divisions that occurred before 1291, culminating in thebattle of Campaldino (1289), when Guelph supremacy solidified papal influence inItalian politics for a long time to come. The “wounds that have brought Italy todeath” are most probably the ensuing disasters wrought by Boniface’s (and thenClement’s) political activities. Is Italy no longer capable of resuscitation?Will another leader’s efforts be too late or might they come in the nick oftime? The text is again problematic (see note to Purg. VI.100–102), first as towhether or not Henry VII is referred to, second as to the precise meaning oftardi, which can mean, in this context, either “at the last moment” or “too lateto succeed.” If, as many believe, this passage (1) was written in 1308–9 (alongwith Purg. VI.97–102), (2) refers to Henry VII, (3) uses tardi to mean “at thelast moment,” everything falls into place: Dante, not yet convinced that Henrywill be the vigorous Italophile that he becomes in 1310, only dubiously putsforward the notion that Henry’s election will have positive results. Oneproposing such an interpretation must admit that Dante, with only minor touches,could have revised both these passages in order to accommodate his post-1310view of Henry. On the other hand, both at least allow the possibility of a morepositive reading, and thus did not absolutely require such revision. And Dante’senthusiasm would only last for a short while, in any case. By September 1313, inthe wake of the death of Henry, the disheartened reading, found in Benvenuto’scommentary to these passages in Purgatorio VI and VII and in ParadisoXXX.133–138, would have become appropriate. [return to English[part0010.html#c07-s32-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s32-i]]97–102. [part0010.html#c07-s33-e] The following five figures were all kingsrather than emperors, beginning with Ottokar of Bohemia (1253–78), who was infact killed by Rudolph in 1278. Just as Rudolph, for all his faults, ispresented as saved, while his son Albert seems clearly not to be, so is Ottokarexalted while his son, Wenceslaus, is apparently headed for the second circle ofhell (or lower).Singleton points out that in the Elysian fields former enemies are also reunitedin peace (Aen. VI.824–827). [return to English [part0010.html#c07-s33-e] /Italian [part0017.html#c07-s33-i]]103–111. [part0010.html#c07-s35-e] Philip III (the Bold) of France (1270–85)is seen in colloquy with Henry I of Navarre (1270–74), to whom he was related bymarriage (his son, Philip IV [the Fair], “the plague of France,” was married toHenry’s daughter Juana). While Philip IV is also clearly referred to severalother times in the poem, generally with bitter sarcasm (e.g., Inf. XIX.87; Purg.XX.91; Purg. XXXII.152–160 and XXXIII.45; Par. XIX.120), he is never named.[return to English [part0010.html#c07-s35-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c07-s35-i]]112–114. [part0010.html#c07-s38-e] Large-limbed (membruto) like Cassius (Inf.XXXIV.67), Pedro III, king of Aragon (1276–85), sings along with large-nosedCharles I of Anjou and Provence, king of Naples and Sicily (1266–85). Pedro hadmarried Constance, daughter of Manfred (see Purg. III.115–116), in 1262, arelationship that gave him a claim to the crown of Sicily, which he assumedafter the Sicilian Vespers (1282) and held until his death, despite the effortsof Charles, whom he had deposed and who died before Pedro, and thus withoutregaining his crown, in 1285. Once again we see enemies united in friendship.[return to English [part0010.html#c07-s38-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c07-s38-i]]115–117. [part0010.html#c07-s39-e] Dante refers, among Pedro’s four sons,either to the firstborn, Alfonso III of Aragon, who reigned for six years (butnot with happy result, according to the chroniclers) after his father’s death(1285–91) and died at twenty-seven, or the last, Pedro, who did indeed die inhis boyhood and was never put on. However, the text would seem clearly toindicate a son who did not succeed his father on the throne. Torraca (1905)makes a strong case for the unlikelihood of Dante’s celebrating Alfonso, thuspromoting the candidacy of Pedro (the “Marcellus” of Aragon, as it were). He hasbeen followed by most commentators. [return to English [part0010.html#c07-s39-e]/ Italian [part0017.html#c07-s39-i]]118–120. [part0010.html#c07-s40-e] Unlike their worthy brother (Pedro?), theother two sons of Pedro III, James and Frederick, do not possess their father’sgoodness, but only his territories. In fact, they went to war with one anotherover their claims to power in Sicily, with Frederick eventually winning out,leaving James to content himself with Aragon. [return to English[part0010.html#c07-s40-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s40-i]]121–123. [part0010.html#c07-s41-e] Dante’s sententious moralizing, issuingfrom the mouth of Sordello, has a precursor in his earlier words on the samesubject in Convivio (IV.xx.5 and 7), as Poletto (1894) was perhaps first topoint out. There Dante testified both that nobility does not descend into anentire family, but into individuals, and that it comes only and directly fromGod. [return to English [part0010.html#c07-s41-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c07-s41-i]]124–129. [part0010.html#c07-s42-e] Charles and Pedro, themselves noble ofspirit, share the disgrace of degenerate offspring, the former’s son, CharlesII, king of Naples and count of Provence (1289–1309), singled out as beingparticularly vile. See Grandgent’s (1909) explanation of these lines: “CharlesII is as much inferior to Charles I as Charles I is to Peter [i.e., Pedro] III.Beatrice of Provence and Margaret of Burgundy were the successive wives ofCharles I, Constance (daughter of Manfred) was the wife of Peter; and Charles Iwas not a devoted husband. ‘The plant (the son) is inferior to the seed (thefather) to the same extent that Constance boasts of her husband (Peter) morethan Beatrice and Margaret boast of theirs (Charles).’ ” Dante, who has somewhatsurprisingly treated Charles of Anjou with a certain dignity (see the harshcharacterizations of him at Purg. XX.67–69 and Par. XIX.127), now takes some ofthat away, as Pedro and Charles are no longer treated with equal respect. Porena(1946) explains that Dante’s gesture here is meant to show his objectivity;having saved Manfred (Purg. III), he now also saves Manfred’s persecutor,Charles, despite his own political (and moral) disapproval. [return to English[part0010.html#c07-s42-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c07-s42-i]]130–132. [part0010.html#c07-s44-e] Henry III of England (1216–72), disparagedby Sordello in his lament for Blacatz (as noted by Poletto [1894]), is here seenpositively and, reversing the trend found in the last three “couples” ofmonarchs, his son (Edward I), known as “the English Justinian” for hiscompilation of English law, is seen as even more noble than he.

Marquis of Monferrato (1254–92),Guglielmo first welcomed Charles of Anjou when he descended into Italy, but thenturned against him when he moved against Lombardy. Guglielmo’s physical positionis lowest in order to match his rank, as Rudolph, the only emperor in the group,was seated highest. His successful career as Ghibelline military leader inLombardy and in Piedmont came to a dramatic halt when he was captured inAlessandria in 1290 and exhibited in a cage for a year and a half until he died.When his son, Giovanni, set out on a war of revenge, the result was disastrousfor Monferrato and Canavese, the two regions that constituted the holdings ofthe marquisate.

[part0010.html#c08-s1-e] This pseudosimile (it has the effect but not thegrammatical form of a simile) sets the protagonist apart from more usual mortaltravelers. Using the two great metaphors for this journey and this poem, thevoyage across a sea and the pilgrimage, the poet presents his earthboundcounterparts as filled with all-too-human backward-looking sentiment. Theprotagonist pays attention to the event taking place before him, avoidingnostalgia, the sort of distraction we found him so attracted by in the secondcanto of Purgatorio when he encountered Casella and experienced associatedmemories of his former life.Grabher’s gloss (1934) to verse 5 runs as follows: “This is the bell forCompline, the last of the canonical hours of the day, when indeed the hymn Telucis ante terminum [‘Before the Ending of the Light’] is sung in order toinvoke divine assistance against the temptations of the night.” This hymnimmediately follows the lesson in the service occurring after Vespers (the timebetween 3 PM and 6 PM), ideally accompanying the setting sun.Tommaseo (1837) was perhaps the first to note the closeness to Dante’sdescription of the pilgrims whom he observed in Florence, perhaps rapt inthoughts of the friends they had left behind at home (Vita nuova XL.2).Byron’s close translation of these much-admired verses in Don Juan III.108 isnoted by Carroll (1904). [return to English [part0010.html#c08-s1-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c08-s1-i]]7–9. [part0010.html#c08-s3-e] The opening passage is so beautiful and itsreaders so moved by it that most of them assume that the protagonist is beingassociated by the poet with the travelers it refers to. Yet it is clear that,unlike those travelers, he does not yield to the temptation of yearning for apast that is out of reach, even though this is his first evening in a distant,foreign place. Indeed, he may be drawing some of his attention from the hymn“Salve, Regina” in order to pay heed to the soul who calls for attention. Whothis soul may be is a matter for which there are no grounds for discovery; wecannot even say whether it is male or female, although the entirely male cast ofthose identified in the Valley of the Princes makes the former possibility amore likely one. Commentators, including Scartazzini (1900), have been remindedof Acts 13:16: “Paul arose, motioning with his hand for silence” (Paul isaddressing the Jews in the synagogue at Antioch; his main message is theResurrection of Jesus). [return to English [part0010.html#c08-s3-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c08-s3-i]]10–12. [part0010.html#c08-s4-e] The praying figure is facing east, not becausethe sun is there (it is setting in the west), but because the east istraditionally associated with Christ as “rising sun.” For the Virgilianprovenance of his gesture see Tommaseo (1837): Dante’s “levò ambo le palme” isindeed close to Aeneid X.844–845: “et ambas / ad caelum tendit palmas.” However,Heilbronn (Heil.1972.1), pp. 56–57, points out that his action “imitates thewords of Psalm 133:3: ‘In noctibus extollite manus vestras in sancta, etbenedicite dominum’ [134:1–2: by night … lift up your hands in the sanctuary andbless the Lord]. At Compline, this psalm immediately precedes the hymn, Telucis, as the gesture does in Purg. VIII.” [return to English[part0010.html#c08-s4-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c08-s4-i]]13. [part0010.html#c08-s5-e] “Te lucis ante,” an evening hymn, is sung in itsentirety. As opposed to “Salve, Regina,” which looks back upon the sadness ofsin and exile, hoping for Marian intercession, “Te lucis ante” looks ahead andrequests the Father’s and the Son’s protection from the dangers of the Satanicforces of the night. Thus, while surely there is nothing “wrong” with singing“Salve, Regina,” in this context it is time to turn to the future, and this iswhat the protagonist does. [return to English [part0010.html#c08-s5-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c08-s5-i]]14–18. [part0010.html#c08-s5-e] Dante’s reaction to this singing isreminiscent of his rapt response to the singing performed on his account byCasella in Purgatorio II (Poletto [1894] also notes this). The religious tone ofthis hymn and the “proper” behavior of this crowd gives us a very differentperspective on this scene. There is no need of a Cato to come to reprimand thesesingers, whose eyes are fixed on heavenly things. [return to English[part0010.html#c08-s5-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c08-s5-i]]19–21. [part0010.html#c08-s7-e] This is the first of seven addresses to thereader in Purgatorio (see note to Inf. VIII.94–96). Most reminiscent, in its useof the language of allegory, of “veiled” truth, found in the second address inInferno (IX.61–63), this passage also involves treating an action performed inthe poem as though it were not “historical” but metaphoric (see note to Inf.IX.58–63). [return to English [part0010.html#c08-s7-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c08-s7-i]]25–30. [part0010.html#c08-s9-e] Most of the early commentators, followingtheir natural inclination, allegorize the meaning of the two swords (often asGod’s justice and mercy), but Pietro di Dante (1340) turns to the Bible fortheir source, and presents a more interesting analysis. Yet it will only be withLombardi (1791) that a later commentator turns to this most likely source.Genesis 3:24 records God’s placing (two?) Cherubim at the east of the garden ofEden along with a flaming sword to keep sinful humans from the tree of life.Dante’s redoing of the scene is careful and meaningful. The swords have nopoints because they do not need to do any harm, since the enemy has beendefeated by Christ and need no longer be feared by those having faith in Christ;they are aflame with God’s love for humanity, which has reversed theexclusionary rule of law in Genesis and reopened the garden with its tree ofeternal life; the angels are green of wing and vestment because they giveexpression to the hope for salvation brought by Christ. Güntert (Gunt.2001.1),p. 109, notes the pivotal reversals of the scene in Genesis here. [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c08-s9-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c08-s9-i]]37–39. [part0010.html#c08-s13-e] Genesis 3:14–15 is another text visiblebehind the scenes of this drama (as Christopher McElroy, Princeton ’72,suggested in a classroom many years ago), God’s curse upon the serpent and theconjoined prophecy of the woman’s seed who will bruise the serpent’s head andhave his heel bruised as a result, taken by Christian exegetes—and surely byDante among them—to refer to the Crucifixion. Both these Cherubs come from thebosom of Mary, that “anti-Eve,” to guard the valley, now safe from harm, as weshall see, against the serpent. This garden, foreshadowing the garden of Edenthat lies above, has been reopened to humanity, as has been that higher place.For the palindromatic opposition Ave/Eva see Pietro di Dante (1340) to ParadisoXXXII.4–6 (the locus of most commentators’ discussion of this topos): “And theholy men say that, just as sickness was born from that most prideful one, thatis, Eve, just so its cure springs from that most humble one, that is, Mary.” Andthus, Pietro continues, the “Ave” of the “Hail, Mary” counters the effect ofEve, whose name it spells backward. [return to English [part0010.html#c08-s13-e]/ Italian [part0017.html#c08-s13-i]]40–42. [part0010.html#c08-s14-e] On the basis of Sordello’s description, theserpent sounds both real and threatening enough for Dante to be afraid,especially since he has not yet read the signs as well as he will eventually.There is only one other occasion in the poem in which Dante has been gelato(chilled): when he looks upon Satan (Inf. XXXIV.22). This serpent is indeedSatan in his “serpent suit” in the garden (Genesis 3:1 and passim). [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c08-s14-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c08-s14-i]]43–45. [part0010.html#c08-s15-e] Sordello’s maneuver puts the appointment withthe serpent on hold and occupies Dante’s mind with other things. Now the Mantuanpoet has Dante descend among the inhabitants of the valley—what he and Virgilspecifically did not do in their first view of them (Purg. VII.88–90). The restof the Edenic drama must wait until vv. 94–108. [return to English[part0010.html#c08-s15-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c08-s15-i]]46. [part0010.html#c08-s16-e] These three steps, unlike those at PurgatorioXXVIII.70, are taken by almost all commentators at face value. But even they,understood by most as indicating that it was but a short distance down into thevalley (see Purg. VII.72), have made allegorists stir with interpretiveexcitement (e.g., Vellutello, Scartazzini). Poletto (1894) waxes hot againstsuch attempts.

[part0010.html#c08-s18-e] “Nino Visconti of Pisa, judge of the district ofGallura in Sardinia; he was grandson of Count Ugolino della Gherardesca, and in1288 was chief of the Guelf party in Pisa; in that year he and the Guelfs weretreacherously expelled from Pisa by Count Ugolino, whereupon he retired toLucca, and in alliance with Genoa and the Lucchese and Florentine Guelfs madewar upon Pisa, which he carried on at intervals for the next five years. In1293, on the conclusion of peace between the Pisans and the Tuscan Guelfs, Ninobetook himself to Genoa, and shortly after departed to his judgeship ofGallura.… Nino died in Sardinia in 1296” (T). Nino fought at the battle ofCampaldino and probably spent some time in Florence in the time between hisexile from Pisa and his removal to Sardinia; it is possible that Dante came toknow him then, as the conversation is clearly meant to be taken as one betweenold friends.

[part0010.html#c08-s19-e] The meeting between Dante and Nino contrastswith that between Virgil and Sordello, this one untinged by tragic notes. Ninoassumes, almost correctly, that Dante is one of the saved; Sordello, guided byVirgil’s admission that he has lost heaven, asks about Virgil’s location in hell(Purg. VII.21).Chiavacci Leonardi (Chia.1994.1), p. 241, cites Francesco D’Ovidio for the viewthat the phrase in verse 57, “over far waters,” reflects, once again, a scene inthe Elysian fields, when Anchises welcomes Aeneas (Aen.

[part0010.html#c08-s20-e] Dante finally is able to answer Sordello’squestion (Purg. VI.70) with regard to his own condition. These are the firstwords he has spoken since VI.51, a fact that underlines the way in whichSordello and Virgil have taken over the stage in these scenes.

[part0010.html#c08-s21-e] Sordello and Nino are both surprised to learnthat Dante is here in the flesh, is not yet dead, the one turning to his newcompanion, Virgil the Mantuan, the other, Nino, to his friend in God’s grace,Currado, perhaps known to him from his recent travels in Tuscany. It is likelythat Dante considered both Virgil and Sordello, champions of empire, sympatheticto the Ghibelline cause, while Nino was a Guelph and Currado, though aGhibelline, was a cousin of Moroello Malaspina, with whom Dante had goodrelations and who was a Guelph. In the next world such divisive distinctionsbegin to break down.Currado Malaspina was the grandson of Currado “l’antico” and son of Federigo ofVillafranca. He died ca. 1294. His first cousin, Franceschino, was probablyDante’s host in Lunigiana in 1306 (see vv. 133–139). [return to English[part0010.html#c08-s21-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c08-s21-i]]67–69.

[part0010.html#c08-s24-e] Nino hopes that Dante, returning to theworld, will see his daughter, Giovanna, in Pisa and cause her, by recountingthis meeting, to pray for his soul.

[part0010.html#c08-s25-e] Nino’s unnamed wife was Beatrice d’Este.Sometime after his death in 1296 she stopped wearing widow’s vestments, whichfeatured white bands drawn around the head (her “wimple”), and eventuallymarried, after a previous betrothal, a second husband, Galeazzo Visconti ofMilan, in June 1300. The misery that awaits her is to share the exile of her newhusband because of the expulsion of the powerful Visconti family from Milan in1302.

Here the innocent Giovanna is a foil to theunnamed but vicious Beatrice d’Este, her own mother.

[part0010.html#c08-s28-e] The poet underlines the fact, lest we fail toobserve it, that Nino takes no pleasure in his former wife’s comingtribulations, but merely notes God’s justice in them.

[part0010.html#c08-s29-e] These three tercets distance the reader fromthe intense family drama narrated by Nino, as though to put that drama into acosmic context. The protagonist gazes at the pole in the southern sky where, ason a wheel, that which is closest to the axle moves more slowly than pointsfarther from it. The four stars, representing the four cardinal virtues (asalmost all agree), seen by the travelers in Purgatorio I.23 near the pole, arenow setting on the other side of the mount of purgatory and are thus shieldedfrom view. They are replaced in their former position by these three. Nearlyall, primarily because of their allegorical reading of the four, also insistthat these represent the three theological virtues—faith, hope, and charity.However, some commentators, following Portirelli (1804), argue for a strictlyliteral and astronomical reference here, the three stars being among thebrightest of two southern constellations, Dorado and Achernar in Eridanus;Canopus in Carina. (For Portirelli’s notion that Dante knew about the southernheavens from Marco Polo, see note to Purgatorio I.22–24.) Beginning withAndreoli (1856), for half a century most commentators argue for a literal sensethat indicates phenomena in the southern sky and an allegorical sense. But afterPoletto (1894) most indicate only the allegorical meaning. [return to English[part0010.html#c08-s29-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c08-s29-i]]94–96. [part0010.html#c08-s32-e] Sordello interrupts Virgil’s heavenlydiscourse to call his (and, once again, not Dante’s) attention to the dramaunfolding in the garden.

[part0010.html#c08-s33-e] We have seen this “snake” before, in InfernoXXXIV, imprisoned for his arrogant assault on God. Now we see him replaying hisrole in the Fall, licking himself in prideful self-absorption as he plansanother assault, now that he has lost his first battle, upon humankind. BothSordello’s urgency in interrupting Virgil’s notice of the heavens’ beauties andthe fact that no opposition has as yet deployed its forces have the effect ofcreating uncertainty (and fear) in the naïve onlooker and in the reader. Thisserpent seems dangerous indeed, as he was when he tempted Eve in Eden, but infact is not, as we presently discover. [return to English[part0010.html#c08-s33-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c08-s33-i]]103–108. [part0010.html#c08-s35-e] Dante’s attention to the snake kept therapid defensive action of the angels from his view until they suddenly enter hisfield of vision, immediately thwarting the plans of the snake. We now see whytheir swords are blunted: they have no need of them because this serpent ispowerless to offend. This drama is precisely that, a play, by which theonlookers, now safe in their potentially (but definitively) saved state, may bereminded of their sinful lives—their vulnerability to the serpent—and the gracethat has rewarded their goodness with salvation. Mark Musa (Musa.1974.1)examines this scene as a representation of Christ’s recurring second advent, asset forth by St. Bernard in his First Sermon on the Advents. Between His first(when He came to earth to save humankind) and final coming (at the end of time,to judge and rule the world), Christ is understood as coming into the heart ofeach successive believer. For Heilbronn (Heil.1972.1), who accepts Musa’s view,the intervention of the angels represents “an allegorical enactment of theintermediate Advent—that is, the coming of Christ into the hearts of thefaithful in this world” (p. 46).

The play reflects the past, Dante’s physical presence in purgatoryin the present, and the future—Dante’s among Currado’s family in Lunigiana andCurrado’s hopes for prayer from them, never expressed, but clear from all thesimilar requests we have already heard from others.

[part0010.html#c08-s41-e] Dante’s words in praise of the valor andgenerosity of the house of Malaspina in 1300 are in fact words of thanks for thehospitality of Franceschino Malaspina in Lunigiana in 1306 (and, according toBoccaccio, in his Vita di Dante [Bocc.1974.1], p. 483, of Moroello Malaspina aswell [see Dante’s letter to Moroello, his fourth Epistle, ca. 1307]).

[part0010.html#c08-s44-e] This verse has been variously interpreted.If we agree that capo is the subject (and not the object) of the sentence, asalmost all do, then we may choose among the following solutions: the wickedchief who corrupts the world may be Satan, the pope (and then surely BonifaceVIII), Rome (with its corrupt papacy and no emperor in her saddle), or badgovernance in general. Whichever solution Dante may himself have had in mind, itis clear that any and all of these solutions “work,” and are, in fact,interrelated. If Satan is the “prince of darkness” who leads most humans astray,his minions on earth (corrupt popes, pusillanimous emperors), or even corruptleadership generally understood, all point to a common failing and a commoncause: weak humans falling under the influence of those who govern poorly. Fromthis failing only the Malaspina family is currently exempt. [return to English[part0010.html#c08-s44-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c08-s44-i]]133–139. [part0010.html#c08-s45-e] “Va” (or, literally, “Go”) seems here tohave the same sense that it sometimes has in Shakespeare, i.e., “Go to,” meaning“Enough of such words.” Currado, embarrassed by Dante’s praise of his family,goes on to promise his interlocutor that he indeed will have cause to praise itmore in 1306 (i.e., before the sun returns to the constellation Aries sevenyears from now).

[part0010.html#c09-s1-e] Like Inferno IX, this ninth canto is bothliminal, marking the boundary between two large areas, and filled with classicalreference. And it is the first entire canto devoted to the transition from onepoetic zone to another since Inferno XXXI. This sort of self-conscious poeticbehavior puts us on notice, from the very outset, that we need to pay particularattention here.Its reference to Aurora, surprisingly enough, has made this passage among themost hotly debated of the poem. In the “orthodox” version of the classical myth,Aurora, goddess of the dawn, arose from her couch, where she slept with her agedhusband, Tithonus, to rise in the sky on her chariot, announcing the coming ofday. A brief and incomplete summary of the debate yields the following (for asummary of the essential arguments over the passage and an attempt to restoreBenvenuto da Imola’s central and daring reading of it see Hollander[Holl.2001.2]): Moore (Moor.1903.1), pp. 74–85, essentially solved this problemalmost a century ago, but in fact the early commentators (to whom Moore payslittle attention) had already done so. Nearly all of them are quite sure thatDante has invented a second myth, one in which Tithonus is married to Aurora 1(of the sun) but has a “relationship” with Aurora 2 (of the moon). The poeticfacts are simple, according to Moore. The time is between 8:30 and 9 PM, thecold animal is the constellation Scorpio (and certainly not that belated othercandidate, Pisces, arguments for which identification Moore competentlydismantles), and thus the aurora we deal with is that of the moon.For a review of these tormented verses and their tormentors (up to 1975) seeVazzana (Vazz.1981.1), pp. 180–85.

[part0010.html#c09-s3-e] Much has been made of the phrase “where we were”by the “solar aurorans” in the hopes of counterposing the northern hemisphere(site of the solar Aurora at this hour in Italy) and the southern (where Danteand his companions are becoming sleepy). However, Dante is probably notcontrasting the two hemispheres but the glow in the night sky of purgatory thatspreads above them and the darkness of their surroundings as night advances. Fora similar situation, consider Purgatorio II.8, the phrase “là dov’ i’ era”(there where I was) by which Dante refers to his situation in the southernhemisphere looking at the stars from there.His figure of speech involves mixing metaphors, as the night is given feet, bywhich she measures her hours, and wings that do the same thing.

[part0010.html#c09-s4-e] Dante’s Adamic sleepiness, that is, theheaviness brought on by his physical being, is adumbrated by a later passage(Purg. XI.43–44), in which Virgil comments upon the difficulties experienced bythis living soul as he climbs the mountain in his flesh (“la carne d’Adamo”).But the theme is introduced in the first canto of Inferno (I.10–12) whereDante’s “sleepiness” is associated with Adam’s, according to Hollander(Holl.1969.1), p. 81n., suggesting a figural relationship between the fallenAdam, sent forth into his exile from the garden, and the sinful Dante.

[part0010.html#c09-s5-e] Dante’s dream, occurring some nine hours afterhe fell asleep, takes place in the pre-dawn moments in which the swallow singssadly perhaps (if we credit the mythographers, most certainly Ovid, Metam.VI.412–674) in memory of the rape of Philomel by her sister Procne’s husbandTereus and her subsequent metamorphosis into a swallow (in Dante’s version,where most others prefer the nightingale—see note to Purg. XVII.19–20, a passagethat makes the swallow here necessarily Philomel). Tereus, like Tithonus, hashad sexual concourse with each of two sisters—if we accept the notion that theopening passage of the poem posits a lunar aurora (see note to vv. 1–9, above).[return to English [part0010.html#c09-s5-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c09-s5-i]]16–18.

[part0010.html#c09-s7-e] The reality corresponding to the eagle outsidethe dream is, naturally, St. Lucy (identified by Virgil in verse 55), who isbearing Dante higher up the mountain while he sleeps in her arms. But does thiseagle have a symbolic valence? Some early commentators (the Ottimo the earliest)read the text strictly literally: the eagle is the bird of Jove (or, perhaps,Jove in the shape of an eagle). However, beginning with Pietro di Dante theeagle is allegorized as divine grace, and then, by various commentators up toand including Giacalone (1968), as one form of grace or another (e.g.,prevenient, illuminating, etc.). In the twentieth century there was a vogue fora quite different allegorical reading, the eagle as symbol of empire. (To besure, this is often, even usually, true in this highly political poem; in thiscontext, however, it seems a forced reading.) It would seem most likely that aliteral reading is the best procedure here, following the Ottimo (1333), andsimply noting that this eagle is the one who flew off with Ganymede, as thecontext allows and encourages, i.e., Dante dreams that he was carried off byJove. [return to English [part0010.html#c09-s7-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c09-s7-i]]22–24. [part0010.html#c09-s8-e] John of Serravalle (1416), followingBenvenuto, allegorizes the eagle as divine grace and then equates Dante andGanymede, thus making Dante “one who lived with the gods.” Casini/Barbi suggestthat Dante had in mind Virgil’s phrase in Georgics I.24–25, “deorum / concilia”(company of the gods) when he wrote “al sommo consistoro”; whether he did ornot, his meaning seems clear. Within the dream there is a certain aura ofviolence and fear (implicit reference to the forcible rape of Ganymede by Joveas eagle—see Aen. V.252–257) masking the happier nature of the event: Dantebeing carried aloft gently by Lucy, and indeed, in a still happierunderstanding, on the way to the Empyrean, where he will, for a while, share thecompany of the immortal blessed. [return to English [part0010.html#c09-s8-e] /Italian [part0017.html#c09-s8-i]]25–27. [part0010.html#c09-s9-e] The protagonist’s thought within his dream isstriking. Since, within the dream, Dante is “thinking like Ganymede,” histhought refers to a place elevated from the normal, e.g., on this mountain nearTroy. (Some commentators want to keep the usual imperial valence of the eagle byassociating this Mt. Ida with Troy and thus empire; however, the point wouldrather seem to be that the place is elevated, not that it is Trojan.) And thusDante would be thinking that only such extraordinary, i.e., “higher,” mortalslike Ganymede and Dante Alighieri are chosen by the gods for their delight. Andthis thought, perfectly in accord with what we will find out on the firstterrace of purgatory proper, associates Dante with the sin of pride. Once again,however, the “reality” tells a different story: the true God is not interestedin Dante’s curly locks, but in his Christian soul; and He will pluck Dante upfrom the mount of purgatory for reasons better than those that motivated Jove.The issue of Jove’s homosexual desire for Ganymede is mainly avoided in thecommentaries. It is, nonetheless, noteworthy that, of the many myths availableto Dante that might express the love of the gods for a particular mortal, he haschosen this one. For the question of Dante’s attitudes toward homosexuality seeHollander (Holl.1996.1). Durling (Durl.1996.1), pp. 559–60, on the basis of noknown evidence, is of the opinion that Dante was of homosexual predispositionbut had never acted on his desires. While that is probably more than can beshown to be true, the question of Dante’s rather “unmedieval” view ofhomosexuality (see concluding note to Inf. XVI) has not been dealt with asopenly as it ought to be. [return to English [part0010.html#c09-s9-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c09-s9-i]]28–30. [part0010.html#c09-s10-e] The eagle’s descent may have still anotherVirgilian provenance: Aeneid XII.247–250, as Tommaseo (1837) was perhaps thefirst to suggest; he has been followed by a number of others. In that scene aneagle, described as “Jove’s golden bird,” offers an omen (arranged by Turnus’ssister, the nymph Juturna) when it dives from the sky to snatch a swan out ofthe water and carries it off as its prey. (This much of the drama bodes ill forthe Trojans, but they are heartened, unfortunately for them, in the finalresult, when the rest of the waterfowl attack the eagle and it drops the swan.)The language is pertinent: Jove’s golden bird is attacking the “litoreas … avisturbamque sonantem / agminis aligeri” (the fowl along the shore, the clamorouscrowd in their wingèd band). From among this agmen aliger the eagle picks one.For the pun available to Dante on his family name (Alighieri/aliger) see thenote to Inferno XXVI.1–3. It seems possible that here Dante is conflating thetwo Virgilian passages in which a Jovian eagle seizes its prey and enjoying thecoincidence that, in the last of them, that prey is associated with his ownname, since he, too, while dreaming, is being lifted skyward in the talons ofJove.The fire alluded to here is the ring of fire that was believed to surround thecloser-to-earth sphere of air, just before one might reach the moon. That thisis the “tanto … del cielo acceso” (so much of the sky set afire) of ParadisoI.79 was possibly first suggested by Lombardi (1791). Thereafter it became acommonplace in the commentaries. [return to English [part0010.html#c09-s10-e] /Italian [part0017.html#c09-s10-i]]31–33. [part0010.html#c09-s11-e] Once again the negative version of events putforth in the dream has a better meaning. It seemed that the eagle and Dante wereconsumed in the ring of fire high above the earth, while actually Dante andLucia have risen to the gate of purgatory, as we shall shortly find out, andDante is being awakened, not by the pain of death, but by the late-morning sunon his eyelids (verse 44). If there is a further significance to this detail, itwould seem to refer to Dante’s eventual arrival at the true “sphere of fire,”the Empyrean. [return to English [part0010.html#c09-s11-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c09-s11-i]]34–42. [part0010.html#c09-s12-e] The poet describes the narrator’s awakeningin terms that recall Statius’s text (Ach. I.247–250), describing the stratagememployed by Thetis, Achilles’ mother, in order to keep him from being “drafted”into the Trojan War. Taking him from the care of his tutor, the centaur Chiron(see Inf. XII.71), Thetis carries him in her arms, sleeping, to the island ofScyros. Again Dante adverts to a mythic narrative that has a tragic result;Thetis’s benevolent caution will not prevent the coming of Ulysses and Diomedesto Scyros and the eventual death of Achilles in the war. Dante’s “comic” realitycounters the Statian tragedy: Achilles is carried down from his mountainhomeland to an island from which he will go off to his death; Dante is carriedup a mountain situated on an island toward his eventual homeland and eternallife. Rarely in the Commedia is the contrast between classical and Christianviews, between tragedy and comedy, more present than in these classicizingpassages that open this canto. It is also true that the protagonist, as heexperiences these new things, behaves very much as the “old” man that he stillis, and assumes that terror is a valid response to these miraculous events that,the reader can see, speak only of God’s love and protection for even such asinner as Dante.

[part0010.html#c09-s18-e] As though to remind the reader that all thematerial relating to Dante’s dream did have a counterpart in reality, Virgil’sexplanation “glosses” the dream as it explains the coming of Lucy, while Danteslept, at the solar aurora, nine hours after he had seen the lunar aurora.Sometime after dawn she began her ascent with Dante in her arms, leaving theircompanions in ante-purgatory.

Exactly who is she and why is she so important tohim? Most commentators take her to be the early-fourth-century martyr fromSyracuse, killed while Diocletian was emperor ca. A.D. 304. She is usuallyassociated with the well-being of the eyes, and this may have had some resonancefor Dante who, in Convivio III.ix.15, reports a severe bout of eye trouble inthe same year that he was composing his ode “Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona.”For whatever reason (and we shall probably never know it), Dante was obviouslyparticularly devoted to the cult of this saint. She has a presence in threemajor scenes in the work, the “prologue in heaven” (Inf. II.97–108), thetransport of Dante while he sleeps in this canto, and the prospect of theinhabitants of the “stadium-rose” (Par. XXXII.137).Moore (Moor.1917.1), pp. 235–55, addresses the problem of an allegoricalunderstanding of Lucy. Does she represent “illuminating grace”? “cooperatinggrace”? Gradually Moore undermines both these allegorical formulations and movestoward the notion of Lucy as Dante’s “patron saint” (p. 241), offering inevidence the phrase “il tuo fedele” (Inf. II.98) that reappears variously (Danteas Beatrice’s “fedele” in Purg. XXXI.134; Bernard as Mary’s “faithful one” inPar. XXXI.102) to suggest that the expression “implies the relation of oneperson to another person as such, and not as a symbol or type” (p. 243).

[part0010.html#c09-s22-e] A final simile prepares us for the entranceto purgatory proper, comparing Dante to one who moves from dubiety toconfidence, a movement that required that he reinterpret the dream and hisassociations in a positive light. [return to English [part0010.html#c09-s22-e] /Italian [part0017.html#c09-s22-i]]70–72. [part0010.html#c09-s24-e] At almost the precise midpoint of the cantoDante situates his second address to the reader of this cantica (see Purg.VIII.19–21 for the first). It has caused two major interpretive problems, twicedividing its readers into two basic groups. First, there are those who believethat it speaks of an increase of quality in the artistry employed by the poet,while others contend that it speaks rather of an increase of quantity. Thisdispute is most readily understood by referring to translations of the poem;those in the first group have Dante say that he will employ better art; those inthe second, more of it.A second question remains: does this heightening reflect just the scene thatfollows (as in the opinion of a minority) or all of the Purgatorio that is tocome? For the latter opinion see Francesco da Buti (1385), who argues that,since the subject is now penitence, that is the higher matter that requires moreart; in one form or another, this is the position taken by most commentators. Inthe opinion of this writer, the address to the reader refers to the descriptionof the gate, its warder, and the three steps in the rite of confession, all ofwhich need to be understood in the tradition of the allegory of the poets, as weshall see. It regards, in other words, matter both local and temporary. In asimilar vein see Vazzana (Vazz.1981.1), pp. 177–80, arguing that what is atstake is the allegorical nature of what immediately follows.

[part0010.html#c09-s27-e] The angel is seated not upon (as some translate)the highest step but above it, as will become clear from verse 104, where welearn that he is seated on the threshold of the gate with his feet upon thethird step.

[part0010.html#c09-s29-e] The warder’s words of challenge, “Dite costinci”(Say it from there) repeat, as many note, the challenge of one of the centaursto the approach of Virgil and Dante (Inf. XII.63) and, like that one, probablyreflect Charon’s similar words (fare age … iam istinc [tell me … right where youare]) to the invading Aeneas in Aeneid VI.389, as Daniello (1568) was perhapsthe first to note.

[part0010.html#c09-s29-e] This scene represents an epitomizing replayof Virgil’s and Dante’s encounter with the guardian of all purgatory, Cato(Purg. I.40–93): challenge by the guarding presence, who wants to know if somehigher authority permits this visit; Virgil’s response indicating a female whohad sent these “pilgrims” on their journey (this time with no attempt to flatterthe warder); the warder’s courteous acceptance of the aspirants’ desire to entera sacred precinct.

Considering this problem, Carroll(1904) cites Milton, describing the gate of heaven (Paradise Lost, III.516):“Each stair mysteriously was meant.” But what exactly does each of Dante’s steps“mean”? Catholic doctrine, as variously expressed, presents the path toabsolution from sin as running, in the Sacrament of Penance, from contrition(the recognition and heartfelt rejection of a sin) to confession (of the sin,voiced to a priest), to satisfaction (in the promise to perform an act ofpenance as ordered by that priest, thus showing the genuineness of theconfession). This is the psychologically correct order as well as the one givenby “Scholastic and other Church writers uniformly” (Moore [Moor.1899.1], p. 47),i.e., one is contrite, confesses, and then performs acts that will lead toabsolution, in the culmination of the sacrament. Dante’s first commentators are,however, more or less evenly divided as to whether the three steps found hererepresent, in sequence, (1) contrition, (2) confession, (3) satisfaction (thisgroup is saving Dante from himself, as it were, i.e., they record what he shouldhave said) or (1) confession, (2) contrition, (3) satisfaction. However, it isfairly clear from the text that Dante has reinvented the order to suit his ownpurpose, beginning with confession and only then proceeding to contrition. Thatthis is almost certainly true is confirmed by a later text. PurgatorioXXXI.31–90 offers a carefully orchestrated presentation of Dante’s own penancebefore Beatrice, with the steps of that paralleling the steps found here,namely, confession, contrition, satisfaction, in that order. Moore also pointsout that Dante’s presentation of the third stage, satisfaction, is unorthodox,since he represents it as the love that came from Christ’s self-sacrifice. Thus,in Dante’s scheme, the sinner first confesses his sin, then feels truecontrition for it, and then moves beyond it in his imitation of and love forChrist. Why he should have wanted to repackage the elements of what was astandard body of doctrine and belief is not a subject that has received adequateattention. But we should not be surprised to find that this poet remakes anytext or any doctrine to his own liking and for his own reasons. The one elementthat does run through Dante’s version of this sacrament is that its priestlyelement is curtailed in favor of inward recognition and performance on the partof the sinner, i.e., confession in Dante seems more a private form ofself-recognition than is generally the case, contrition contains mainly internalelements (if it must eventually be given voice), and satisfaction seems moreattitudinal than performative. It also seems that Dante has moved elements ofsatisfaction into the second stage of the process, contrition. [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c09-s32-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c09-s32-i]]94–96.

[part0010.html#c09-s35-e] Only recently have commentators (Mattalia[1960], Fallani [1965], Bosco [1979]) turned, for the source of Dante’sdiamante, to Ezechiel’s adamantem, when God gives his prophet a stony foreheadto wear against his enemies (Ezechiel 3:9). And since the priestly angel, seatedupon the adamant threshold, is iconographically related to St. Peter, a numberof commentators think of Matthew 16:18, “You are Peter and upon this rock will Ibuild my church.” [return to English [part0010.html#c09-s35-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c09-s35-i]]109. [part0010.html#c09-s37-e] Either in December 1310 at Vercelli or inJanuary 1311 at Milano, Dante was apparently presented to the new emperor, HenryVII (see Frugoni’s notes in his edition of Dante’s Epistles, p. 564). Dantehimself reports that he embraced the emperor’s feet (Epist. VII.9). It is atleast conceivable that this verse remembers that experience, especially since,if it was written after the event, it was probably written soon after it. Onceagain we are unable to be certain, because of the uncertainties that attenddating the stages of the poem’s composition.

[part0010.html#c09-s37-e] Dante’s threefold beating of his chest has beenglossed, since the time of the Ottimo (1333), as signifying “mea culpa, meaculpa, mea maxima culpa.” Andrea Lancia (the probable author of that commentary)proceeds, followed in this, as well, by many later commentators, to say thatthese three in turn signify three kinds of sin: sins of thought, of the tongue,and in deed.

[part0010.html#c09-s38-e] The seven P’s, generally understood as derivingfrom the first letter of peccata (sins), evidently stand for the seven mortalsins (or capital vices), but here, since the protagonist has learned to hatesin, they stand for what remains of the predisposition to these seven vices thatis inherited by every mortal through Adam’s (and Eve’s) original sin. For theP’s as deriving from the letter tau see Sarolli (Saro.1957.1), arguing for asource in Ezekiel 9:2–6, where God commands a scribe to write that letter—as apositive sign in that case—on the foreheads of all the inhabitants of Jerusalemwho repent the abominations done in the city. In the following slaughter of therest of the inhabitants, only Jeremiah and the other just Jerusalemites arepreserved. See also Apocalypse 7:3, for the true believers who bear the sign ofGod on their foreheads, and Apocalypse 13:16 and 20:4, where those who worshipthe Beast have his sign on their foreheads.For some time now a debate among the commentators has involved the question ofwhether or not others on the mountain possess these P’s (i.e., whether or notthe P’s on Dante’s forehead are unique). Two differing reasons help us to befairly certain that they are in fact unique to him, the first one positive:Dante is the sole visitor to purgatory who climbs there in the flesh; hisuniqueness thus has this further sign. Second, and arguing from negativeevidence, one may say that, since no other character is ever observed bearingthese stigmata, one may reasonably conclude that none has them.

[part0010.html#c09-s39-e] Sensible allegorical expositions of the twokeys are found variously, but of particular use is Poletto’s gloss to vv.115–117. The golden key denotes the authority to absolve granted by Christdirectly; the silver, the judgment necessary in the priest to be sure thepenitent is truly deserving of absolution. Poletto cites passages in St. Thomasto show Dante’s closeness to them in this part of his description of the processof entering purgatory (ST III, Suppl., qq. 17–20). Once the priest has judgedthe penitent ready for absolution (using his silver key), he then uses thegolden one to complete the opening of the door. The priest, of course, may errin wanting to allow an unfit soul to enter; in that case the golden key will notturn in the lock—but even so, God is disposed to err on the side of mercy andwill overrule a prelate who is niggardly in pardoning.The fact that a priest may err in his judgment makes it disturbing that thisfigure is presented as being literally an angel (who thus should be free of suchweak discernment). It would seem more logical if we dealt here with anallegorical figure, Priestliness, the Petrine warder of the gate, a compositefigure representing a class, not a particular historical being. And, indeed, theangel does not behave in any other way. [return to English[part0010.html#c09-s39-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c09-s39-i]]131–132. [part0010.html#c09-s44-e] See Christ’s words to his disciples (Luke9:62): “Nemo mittens manum suam ad aratrum, et respiciens retro, aptus est regnoDei” (No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit forthe kingdom of God). This apt passage has been cited in this connection sincethe time of Pietro di Dante (1340). While Lot’s wife (Genesis 19:17, 19:26) mayalso be remembered here, the passage from Luke’s gospel is more closely related.The same may be said for the resonance of Orpheus’s backward glance at Eurydice.[return to English [part0010.html#c09-s44-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c09-s44-i]]133–138. [part0010.html#c09-s45-e] This is the first part of one of the mostdifficult canto endings in the Divine Comedy. These lines remember a terriblemoment of Roman history, while the second part (vv. 139–145) reflects themusical practice of Dante’s day.For hundreds of years Rome had kept a part of its treasure secure from any use,locked behind a portal that was never opened, until Caesar, in order to fund hispursuit of Pompey and Cato in 49 B.C., broke into the treasury and looted it,overcoming the resistance of a single brave republican, Metellus, loyal toPompey. Dante’s source here is the violently republican Lucan (Phars.III.108–168). It is worth reading the entire passage, which most commentatorsapparently do not do, for it drips with sarcasm about Julius Caesar, from itsinception, in which Caesar, having marched on Rome and conquered by arms, hasbecome everything and the senate has become a mouthpiece for this “private man,”to its conclusion, in which the city is portrayed as being poorer than the oneman who rules her as a result of his plundering the temple of Saturn, hertreasury. There is nothing good here about Caesar, despite Dante’s respect forhim as the person he considered the first emperor of Rome (see Stull andHollander [Stul.1991.1], pp. 33–43, for Dante’s mainly negative, if mixed, viewsof Julius in the poem). And thus the sound that sounds so shrilly at Dante’sentrance into purgatory is reminiscent of what, for Lucan and for Dante, isperhaps the nadir of Roman history, the accession of Caesar and the destructionof the republic. (For Dante’s fervent belief in the republican virtues and formof government see Hollander and Rossi [Holl.1986.1].) Along with the passage inLucan, undoubtedly Dante’s main source here, Tommaseo (1837) brings into playAeneid VI.573–574: “tum demum horrisono stridentes cardine sacrae / pandunturportae” (then at last, grating on their hinges, the impious gates swing open).Virgil is describing the gates of Tartarus, swinging open (the Sibyl and Aeneasdo not enter, but she does tell him of the horrors of the punishments therein).Here, too, we can see how Dante has juxtaposed two similar objects, the gates ofTartarus, the pagans’ hell, and those of purgatory, and make the reader aware ofthe crucial similarity that marks their utter difference.What is the effect of such negative reminiscences as the protagonist begins toattain the Promised Land? One must conclude that we are dealing here withantithesis: as brutally shrill as was the sound of the squealing doors of thetemple of Saturn, of the gates of Tartarus, exactly so terribly loud is the rarevictory of a penitent being allowed to enter the kingdom of Heaven—or itsvestibule. What was tragic in its consequence for Rome is marked by a soundexactly as loud and grating as this one that announces the victory of a new (andbetter) Caesar who enters not against the will of the warder, but in accord withit. Only the sounds are similar; all else is changed. And, as we have seen occurseveral times in the first half of this canto, tragic classical myth or historygives way to comic Christian narrative. In the words of Jesus (Luke 12:34),“There where your treasure is, there your heart is also.” Caesar’s treasure isfar different from the treasure in Heaven sought and found by only relativelyfew Christians, their low numbers suggested by the infrequent screechings ofthis gate.As for the positive resolution for the unpleasant sound of the opening gate,Heilbronn (Heil.1984.1) points out that medieval concepts of musical “sweetness”had more to do with harmony than with the sounds themselves. She (p. 4) givesthe examples of the hurdy-gurdy and drum, both of which would hardly seem to be“sweet” to modern ears, but did to those of the time who recorded theirresponses. This point is a pivotal one for those who cannot bring themselves tosee how the grating screech of a gate can be in harmony with another sound. Yetwhen we reflect, along with Heilbronn, that what the gate’s sound announces isvery sweet indeed, we may begin to understand Dante’s strategy here. [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c09-s45-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c09-s45-i]]134. [part0010.html#c09-s45-e] The noun regge represents a relatively rareterm (one never used elsewhere by Dante) for the main portal of a church.Heilbronn (Heil.1984.1), p. 5, suggests that “like a cathedral door, the gate ofPurgatory is the mystical image of the gate of heaven.” [return to English[part0010.html#c09-s45-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c09-s45-i]]139–145. [part0010.html#c09-s47-e] This passage, too, has caused a great dealof difficulty. Heilbronn (Heil.1984.1), a Dante scholar with a musicalbackground, has dealt with a number of the issues that have puzzled readers andoffers a helpful review of the extensive discussion. Some of the essentialmatters in dispute involve the words tuono, voce, suono, and organo.According to her, tuono (understood as “a note” and not as “thunder”) should beseen as positive, since it is the sound that accompanies a soul’s entrance intopurgatory; voce and suono are, respectively, technical terms for the human voiceand an inanimate, instrumental sound (pp. 6–7), while organo refers either topolyphonic singing or singing accompanied by an organ. Heilbronn is illuminatingabout the use of impressively large organs in churches in the tenth and eleventhcenturies (pp. 8–10). Giacalone (1968) points out that Dante himself haddescribed an organist as accompanying a song (Dve II.viii.5–6) and Bosco/Reggio,influenced by the paper given by Damilano in 1974, remind us that one of Dante’scommentators, Cristoforo Landino (1481), grandnephew of the famous organistFrancesco Landino, is of the opinion that the practice was to alternate passagesof singing and organ-playing in church services and that this is referred to byDante here.Dante believes he hears the words of a hymn being sung (and we must imaginethat, if there was actual singing to greet his coming [Dante only says that heseemed to hear voices], it was done by angels, since the penitents we eventuallysee in the next canto, the prideful, are bent under their weights and far fromlyrical; however, this harmonious sound may issue from the gate itself). “TeDeum laudamus” has an interesting history in the commentaries. (For the text ofthe hymn in Latin and English see Singleton’s gloss to verse 140.) Benvenutoclaims that St. Ambrose wrote this hymn after he had served as St. Augustine’sspiritual doctor and cured him of his terrible errors (in Milan shortly beforeAugustine’s conversion); it is thus, Benvenuto continues, a most fittingaccompaniment to Dante’s—another great intellect’s—turning to penance. Otherearly commentators also associate the hymn with Augustine’s conversion, whetherit was sung while he was being baptized or spoken by Ambrose in his sermon onthat occasion or, indeed, according to Francesco da Buti, spontaneously spokenresponsively by these two great men on that day. While in our time it is notbelieved to have been composed by Ambrose, in Dante’s it was. That Dante shouldhave chosen to present himself, entering purgatory, as a new (and better) JuliusCaesar and as the new Augustine is both altogether extraordinary and completelyDantean. (For the opinion that Dante presents himself as being like Augustine inthe sins he must conquer, lust and bad philosophizing, see Hollander[Holl.1969.1], p. 165n.) [return to English [part0010.html#c09-s47-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c09-s47-i]]PURGATORIO X1–6. [part0010.html#c10-s1-e] The opening verses of the canto tell us thatDante is obeying the angel’s warning (IX.132) not to look back (in thispotentially resembling one of the disciples of Jesus even more than Lot’s wifeor Orpheus—see note to Purg. IX.131–132) and that the gate of purgatory makessuch noise because it is so infrequently opened, since most human beings preferto pretend that their crooked way is straight and spend eternity in hell as aresult. This last image will be reinforced immediately by the undulating paththrough the rock that the travelers must follow, reminiscent of the sinful lifethey have left behind, and eventually, as Singleton points out, by themisconception that what is in fact crooked is straight in Dante’s dream of theSiren (Purg. XIX.7–15).Poletto’s commentary (1894) to this passage reminds the reader of the totalcontrast between the solitary state of Dante and his guide, both when theyapproached the angelic warder and now, having proceeded farther up the mountain(see verse 21), and the vast crowds of damned sinners found both inside the gateof hell and before Minos in Inferno III.119–120 and V.12. [return to English[part0010.html#c10-s1-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c10-s1-i]]7–16. [part0010.html#c10-s3-e] As opposed to the wide and easy entrance tohell (Inf. V.20), that to purgatory is narrow and difficult. For the referenceto the “needle’s eye” [verse 16]), see Christ’s words to the disciples (Matthew19:24): “And further I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through theeye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.”Virgil insists on the need for arte, or skill in navigating a tight spot,apparently so as not to allow Dante to be wounded by the sharp edges of therock’s outcroppings, and thus in not following the shortest path along thislabyrinthine passageway, but the one that moves back and forth from the fartherwall in order to avoid the protuberances on the nearer.His reference to the waning moon (see Inf. XX.127, where we learn the moon wasfull on Thursday night) portrays the dark crescent in that body as leading ittoward the horizon as it sets. It is now Monday morning; the moon was full 3.5days ago and set in the western sky exactly at sunrise. With four days ofretardation, fifty minutes per day, it is now setting approximately three hoursand twenty minutes after sunrise. Since Dante awoke before the gate just after 8AM (Purg. IX.44), it is perhaps slightly more than an hour later. In that timehe has been admitted by the warder and made his way with Virgil through the “eyeof the needle.” [return to English [part0010.html#c10-s3-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c10-s3-i]]19. [part0010.html#c10-s7-e] This verse distances Virgil from Dante byinsisting on his freedom from the body’s weight and yet equates the twotravelers as being equally uninformed as to their impending choices. We haveknown that Virgil is not proficient in the ways of purgatory from the outset(Purg. II.61–63); now that we are in true purgatory the point is underlined.[return to English [part0010.html#c10-s7-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c10-s7-i]]22–23. [part0010.html#c10-s8-e] See Toscano (Tosc.1989.1), pp. 207–8, on twodebates among the commentators: Does this wall make a right or an obtuse anglewith the smooth pavement? Do the penitents observe what is sculpted on the wallor not? Toscano strongly supports the notion that the wall is set at an obtuseangle so that the penitents are able to see what is depicted on it. If this werenot the case, he continues, God’s art would be wasted on them, unable to movetheir heads high enough to see the instructive decoration, which would, withouttheir observation, be mere ornament. If the terraces are cut into the side ofthe mountain and if this verse, as many commentators believe, indicates that theinner bank of every terrace is part of the tapered shape of the mountain as awhole, then Toscano is correct. However, should we ever be forced to decidethat, as Pietrobono (1946), Mattalia (1960), and Vazzana (Vazz.1970.1, pp.65–67) believe, this terrace (and every other one?) has a perpendicular wall asits inner border, we would also probably deduce that, in God’s realm, evenstiff-necked penitents will somehow be able to see all of the sculpting that isput there for their instruction. (Dante’s illustrators are not much help in thisrespect; if one examines the two illustrations of the purgatorial mount found inthe Dante Encyclopedia [Lans.2000.1], pp. 725 and 729, one finds that one showsthe first condition, the other, the second.) Since Dante never clarified thispoint and since the manuscript tradition of the line (verse 30) crucial to itsinterpretation itself has caused much uncertainty, we really cannot say what themeaning is. Bosco/Reggio (1979) contrive a compromise: the lower part of thewall is slanted, but the rest of it is perpendicular. This might solve certainproblems, but cannot be supported by the text. [return to English[part0010.html#c10-s8-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c10-s8-i]]30. [part0010.html#c10-s10-e] For some of the problems associated with thisverse see note to vv. 22–23. [return to English [part0010.html#c10-s10-e] /Italian [part0017.html#c10-s10-i]]31–33. [part0010.html#c10-s11-e] Art is clearly a major theme of this canto.We hear now of the aesthetic superiority of God’s intaglios over the work of thesculptor Polycletus or the creative genius of nature herself. At verse 97 welearn, not of Dante’s instruction, but of his delight in the intaglios. Near thecanto’s close we are told in a simile of the genuine distress that can be causedby our looking at a sculpted figure of a crunched human shape in a corbel(131–134). All these aesthetic moments have at their root the experience of artas moving its audience by its mimetic capacity. The morality of the art found onthis terrace is not to be doubted, but in this canto (as opposed to the next) weat first find art treasured for purely aesthetic reasons (but see note to vv.97–99).The words that make their way through the three descriptions of intaglios in vv.31–81 insist on the artistic nature of what the protagonist sees: forms ofintaglio: 32, 38, 55; of imagine: 39, 41, 62; of storia: 52, 71, 73. This art ofGod, which some commentators have looked upon as uncannily predicting theeventual sculpture of Michelangelo, may be more advanced than that of meremortals, and even of nature, but it somehow does not seem very far removed fromthat of Dante himself.Polycletus, Athenian sculptor of the fifth century B.C., for Dante representedthe height of classical Greek art. Torraca (1905) points out that previousthirteenth-century Italian writers cited him in a similar way. Sources ofinformation about him were found in Cicero, Quintilian, and Pliny. AndAristotle, mentioning him in the Nichomachean Ethics, brought him to theattention of St. Thomas. And so, even if Italian vernacular writers of thisperiod had never seen his work, they could refer to it as Dante does here.[return to English [part0010.html#c10-s11-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c10-s11-i]]34–45. [part0010.html#c10-s12-e] The first example of each virtue (hereHumility), opposed to the capital vice purged on each of the seven terraces, isalways Mary. These four tercets are spare and central in their presentation ofthe Annunciation: only Gabriel and Mary are seen, minus the “background”expected by any medieval reader, familiar with the iconography of this moment:dove, ray of light, garden, etc. As the Ottimo (1333) has it, the “long-standingban” had been in effect since the time recorded in Genesis 3 (the Fall) and wasonly rescinded when Christ harrowed hell.The sculpted forms are so vivid that they actually seem to speak. Thus doesDante recast the key spoken moments of Luke 1:26–38, Gabriel’s charge and Mary’shumble acceptance of it. [return to English [part0010.html#c10-s12-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c10-s12-i]]46–54. [part0010.html#c10-s16-e] Bosco/Reggio make explicit what is almostsaid by many of those commentators who deal with the phrase in verse 53, “varcaiVirgilio” (I went past Virgil): it is a fine, realistic detail with no furthersignificance. Yet this entire passage, in which Virgil gets Dante to stopenjoying so deeply the representation of Gabriel and Mary and to make himselfavailable to more of God’s art, has certain overtones that might cast adifferent light on the relationship between the two poets here. The Annunciationwas nearly, we might reflect, the subject of Virgil’s fourth Eclogue, the childto be born to a virgin that, had he only known which child and which virgin,might have saved him. It is this scene from which Virgil, in all innocence,pulls Dante away. And, while what follows merely describes Dante’s moving pastVirgil, who had been standing between him and the first intaglio, from left toright, so as better to inspect the next work, it also describes physically whathas a moral status, that is, Dante surpasses Virgil as an artist because he ismore available to the meaning of God’s art. (In this vein see Barolini[Baro.1984.1], p. 278.) [return to English [part0010.html#c10-s16-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c10-s16-i]]55–69. [part0010.html#c10-s19-e] As Inferno has readied us to observe, Dantewill now couple his subordinate exemplary figures as scriptural and classical,more specifically Old Testament and Roman. This passage consolidates keyelements of the narrative concerning David’s bringing the Ark of the Covenantinto Jerusalem: his dancing before it, his wife Michal’s scorn, and herresultant barrenness (II Samuel 6:1–23). [return to English[part0010.html#c10-s19-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c10-s19-i]]56–57. [part0010.html#c10-s19-e] Uzzah’s presumption in attempting to assistHim who requires no help of any kind is related in II Samuel 6:6–7: he tried tosteady the Ark when the movement of the oxen seemed about to topple it; for thisGod strikes him down immediately, killing him for his prideful insistence on amission not enjoined. For Dante’s complex and amusing acknowledgment, both hereand, more specifically, in his eleventh Epistle that he is, in some ways, the“new Uzzah,” see Barolini (Baro.1992.1), p. 132, and Hollander (Holl.1999.2).[return to English [part0010.html#c10-s19-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c10-s19-i]]60–63. [part0010.html#c10-s20-e] The protagonist’s ears assure him that theseven choirs in this panel are not singing, yet his eyes insist that they are.Just so his nose smells no perfume of incense, while his eyes can see that thesmoke indeed has an aroma.

[part0010.html#c10-s22-e] Perhaps no passage in a poem that refers toDavid more than to any other personage from the Old Testament (see Holl.1973.1)is more compelling in establishing the “figural relationship” between the twopoets. Dante, too, is the “humble psalmist,” David’s modern counterpart. Itseems just to say that no one has developed this observation as well as hasBarolini (see especially Baro.1984.1, pp. 275–78). Tommaseo long ago (1837)dealt with this scene as a metaphor for great Dante’s low vernacular poetryperformed beneath the scornful gaze of pedantry: “But Dante is more than poet incertain respects, because he does not fear to appear less than poet and danceswith his robe hitched up; but princess Michal—I might call her ‘pedantry’—sniffsfrom the window.” [return to English [part0010.html#c10-s22-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c10-s22-i]]67–69. [part0010.html#c10-s23-e] Where David, down among the common people anddancing without kingly dignity, reflects the low comedic world, Michal, highabove the crowd and separate from it, scornful, seems to represent the lofty,“tragic,” or noble view. David here serves as a forerunner for Jesus, who willidentify himself with humility, while Michal seems to be associated with allthose who resist humility in the name of pride. [return to English[part0010.html#c10-s23-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c10-s23-i]]73–93. [part0010.html#c10-s25-e] The longest of these three scenes concernsTrajan, emperor of Rome in the years 98–117. Of those whom Dante depicts asbeing saved, to whom all or most Christians would deny, or at least question,that status (Cato [Purg. I.75], Statius [Purg. XXII.73], Trajan [Par. XX.44],and Ripheus [Par. XX.68]), only for Trajan does there exist a tradition thatconsidered him saved. This result of St. Gregory’s prayers is even allowed aspossible by St. Thomas, in what seems an unusually latitudinarian gesture,recorded in the Summa theologica (as was perhaps first noted by Lombardi[1791]): ST III, Suppl., quaest. 71, art. 5, obj. 5 [for the text in English seeSingleton’s note to verse 75]). That what seems to modern ears an unbelievablestory should have had the support of so rigorous a thinker as Thomas stillastounds readers. Yet, if one looks closely, one sees that Thomas does hedge hisbet: Trajan’s salvation by Gregory’s intervention is “probable” (potestprobabiliter aestimari); further, according to Thomas, “as others say” (secundumquosdam), Trajan may have only had his punishment put back until Judgment Day.Dante betrays no such hesitation: the salvation of Trajan is Gregory’s “greatvictory” (verse 75). Dante is in an enviable position, both possessing Thomas’ssupport and being able to outdo him in enthusiasm.For some of the many medieval texts that support the miraculous salvation ofTrajan and for an array of possible sources for the dialogue between Trajan andthe widow, including Trajan’s column in Rome, see Vickers (Vick.1983.1), pp.70–72, 75–79.

His lengthy commentary on the Book of Job (the Moralia),one of the most influential writings of the earlier Middle Ages, offers adifferent and happier understanding of Job’s story than is prevalent today,insisting that it has a truly “comic” resolution, rebinding Job to God andrestoring his family. Dante mentions Gregory twice, here and in ParadisoXX.106–117, in connection with the salvation of Trajan, and he is referred to inthe last sphere of the heavens as one of the saved (Par. XXVIII.133), despitethe fact that he had made small errors in listing the orders of the angelichierarchy (as had Dante himself in Conv. II.v.6) in the Moralia.For information about which popes are saved and which are damned according tothe Commedia see note to Inferno VII.46–48.

[part0010.html#c10-s26-e] Having been told of Gregory’s “great victory,”we are now told in what it consisted: the pope has saved a (dead) pagan emperor.The way the text is handled reminds us of Dante’s continuing hostility to theChurch’s insistence on the hierocrat position, in which the emperor is seen astotally dependent upon the Church for his authority. Gregory’s intervention fora great Roman emperor has, in Dante’s eyes, a different style and sets a betterstandard.

[part0010.html#c10-s26-e] The rapid strokes that fill in the details ofthis intaglio show that Dante is fully capable of producing the scene inpictures. But in the following dozen verses, pushing the limits of the art heattributes to God, but which he has invented, he reports only the “visiblespeech” wrought by what he saw, that is, the words induced by the carving ratherthan the carving itself.

[part0010.html#c10-s33-e] These images of humility reflect the patternthat we will find on each terrace: first exempla of the virtue that directlyopposes the vice repented (here humility and pride), ultimately exempla of thevice itself (see Purg. XII.25–63). Thus the penitents are at first encouragedand finally warned lest they backslide. [return to English[part0010.html#c10-s33-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c10-s33-i]]100–102. [part0010.html#c10-s34-e] Dante’s delectation has delayed thetravelers long enough so that even this slow-moving band of penitents, comingalong behind them, can become visible to Virgil (but not to the art-absorbedDante), even though the path was totally bare when the two poets arrived on it(vv. 25–26). It is a curious fact of this art-filled canto that, of the twopoets, Virgil has clearly the shorter attention span to give to art. He feels hehas to urge Dante to take his eyes off Gabriel and Mary (verse 46) in order toexamine David, and now interrupts Dante’s delectation in the images of Trajanand the widow in order to get him to look at real souls. (He is obviouslyhimself not nearly so absorbed by God’s art.) It is a bit difficult to know whatto make of these moments. Virgil resembles the less art-responsive member of acouple in a museum, waiting for his friend, totally absorbed, to finish lookingso that their tour may continue. Further, the word used to describe Virgil’sdistracting locution is mormorava (murmured). Dante uses it seven other times inthe poem, and it usually denotes some form of less-than-clear speech, uttered inthis way because the speaker is in pain or distracted (in the only precedingoccurrence, Inf. XXVI.86, it is the riven, speaking flame of Ulysses thatmurmurs). For Dante to put together the very word that for him most stands foreloquence, poeta, with “murmured” is striking. No one has, with the exception ofVickers, paid attention to the curious and disturbing notion that Virgil, of allpeople, should murmur. Here is her formulation, in partial response to thatword: “The placing of Virgil face to face with divine assurance of the salvationof Trajan, a man of no more faith than he, cannot but emphasize the enigma ofVirgil’s situation” (Vick.1983.1, p. 72). She goes on to speculate that thesalvation of Trajan by intervention of Gregory inevitably brings to mind anothergreat medieval legend, that of St. Paul praying for the soul of Virgil at histomb near Naples, a potential intervention on behalf of damned Virgil that, asfar as everyone who has dealt with it is concerned, was obviously notsuccessful.

[part0010.html#c10-s36-e] Dante’s third address to us, his readers,is an appeal that we accept the necessity of treatment for our ills before weare eventually free of them. Since the “punishments” of the saved do not seem,at first blush, all that much more pleasant than the pains of the damned, thepoet wishes to emphasize the great gulf that separates them: those in hell areeternal; these here are time-bound and will cease at least by the Day ofJudgment.

[part0010.html#c10-s38-e] This passage has caused much discussion butis in fact not as difficult as it has been made to seem. The purpose of theentire passage is to get Dante to understand that what he is looking at is humanand not merely a procession of mobile rocks. Virgil says he, too, had troublemaking this fact out at first, but eventually could see that there were beingsmoving beneath the rocks. A single gesture makes this clear: they beat theirbreasts. And it is a gesture that accords with the penitential feelings of thepenitent prideful, as Moore (Moor.1896.1), p. 49, clearly pointed out, citingLuke 18:13, where the publican beats his breast in humility.

[part0010.html#c10-s41-e] The poet’s second apostrophe of the canto(see vv. 106–111 for the first) is not, strictly speaking, an address to thereader but rather a castigation of all those Christians (and thus, one wouldexpect, not all his readers) who have turned away from God.One of the most celebrated metaphors of the poem, the “angelic butterfly” thateach of us has as a potential destiny, is what most of us will not become.[return to English [part0010.html#c10-s41-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c10-s41-i]]128. [part0010.html#c10-s43-e] While God wills that we, caterpillars that weare, become butterflies, Heaven-bound souls, we choose to be even less thanthose worms that are capable of that transformation, and have bent our wills tobe such. As commentators have shown, antomata is Dante’s version of Aristotle’screatures born, not of other creatures, but of the putrefaction of vegetablematter, as when the sun beats down on the mud—see De generatione animaliumIII.1, as cited by Benvenuto. See also Aristotle’s Historia animalium V.19, ascited by Pasquini/Quaglio (1982), where Aristotle distinguishes, as Dante doeshere, between worms that can turn into butterflies and those, defective, whichcannot. The meaning clearly seems to be that we are born worms, but turnourselves into still lesser beings, formally imperfect worms, as though we hadnot been bred by creatures with rational souls. Benvenuto concludes by quotingJob (but actually the Psalms: 21:7 [22:6]): “Vermis sum ego et non homo” (I am aworm, not a man—Benvenuto may have conflated that passage with Job 25:6).[return to English [part0010.html#c10-s43-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c10-s43-i]]130–135. [part0010.html#c10-s44-e] In a canto so concerned with art, andhighly mimetic art in particular, it seems only natural that the poet would havewanted to conclude with a simile, one of this artisan’s specialties. We may besurprised to realize that this is the first one in this canto, that we have notseen one since well back in the last canto (Purg. IX.34–42). A corbel is asculpted human figure, often crudely realistic, and thus part of the low-mimetictradition, used to decorate the element that joins a weight-bearing column tothe roof- or floor-beam that it supports.The notion that an artifact can be so “realistic” that, although it is not real,but a fiction, as it were, it can cause an observer real distress, continues themimetic concern so evident in this canto and also stands as a sort of emblem ofthe poem as a whole, with its insistence on its literal truth dizzyinglycountered by its less evident but clear admission that it is in fact invented bya poet, if one who will only write fictions that seem (and claim) to be utterlytrue. For discussion of this passage in this light see Barolini (Baro.1992.1),pp. 125–26. [return to English [part0010.html#c10-s44-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c10-s44-i]]136–137. [part0010.html#c10-s46-e] We learn that, just as in hell there weresinners punished in differing degrees for the same sin, so in purging themselvespenitents also reflect the degree of their former sinfulness.

[part0010.html#c10-s46-e] A small but continuing dispute in thecommentaries debates whether pazïenza should be interpreted as “suffering” or“patience.” Philologically there is probably no advantage to either solution.However, poetic logic points to a simple explanation (one shared by the vastmajority of the commentators): what we face here is a relation of paradox ratherthan similarity. Even the most stoical of the sinners seemed to be expressingthe thought (another case of “speech made visible”) “I can no more.” Of coursethe one who suffered most would be saying such a thing; that would not be worthmentioning. The point is that even the penitent least crushed by the weight ofhis former pride is suffering as much as one can possibly suffer.Gerard Manley Hopkins offered, whether he wished to or not, a perfectly Danteangloss to this verse. In his “terrible sonnet” named “Carrion Comfort” by RobertBridges, Hopkins, more likely citing Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra(IV.xv.59) than Dante, has his speaking voice cry out, “Not, I’ll not … cry Ican no more. I can.” While Antony says “I can no more” and dies, Hopkins’spersona does not give in to despair and continues to strive toward God. Here,the penitents all seem to insist that they are at the end of their strength, yetall continue on the road toward making restitution to God by giving satisfactionfor their sins and thus obtain their final absolution.

[part0011.html#c11-s1-e] As Singleton points out in his gloss to thispassage, this is the only complete prayer recited in the entire poem. And, asBosco/Reggio point out, the three forms of expiation that are found on everyterrace are prayer, suffering, and meditation (on examples of the vice’sopposing virtue and on the vice itself). In this way the penitents attempt toaccomplish their “satisfaction” (see note to vv. 70–72) before God for eachparticular offense into which they have fallen. (It will eventually become clear[e.g., Purg. XXIII.90] that not every sinner must purge every sin, although itis certainly possible that any given sinner would have sinned not onlyintrinsically but in fact in all seven categories.)Dante’s version of the Lord’s Prayer (Matthew 6:9–13; Luke 11:2–4) is, asexamination of the Vulgate reveals, an amalgam of the two passages, adapted soas to be particularly fit for the souls of those who are in essence saved butneedful of purgation (as is made clear by vv. 22–24). It is clear that Dante issiding with those who have been involved in the vernacularization of the Bible,an activity fraught with danger in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance.(The questions of the text of the Bible known to Dante and of his access to thattext remain vital—and unanswered [see Angelo Penna, “Bibbia,” ED 1 (1970), pp.626–27].)

[part0011.html#c11-s2-e] Giacalone (1968) was perhaps the first Italiancommentator to point out that Dante’s phrasing here (“laudato sia” [let yourname be praised]…“da ogne creatura” [by every creature]) is not a translationfrom the Gospels but rather reflects the refrain of Francis of Assisi’s Laudescreaturarum. For possible earlier citations by Dante of Francis’s poem see noteto Inferno I.26–27.There is debate as to whether or not the Father is addressed as the Trinity oras Himself. Those who take the former position have apparent support in the wordvapore (breath), which is often the sign of the Holy Spirit. Here, as somecommentators, beginning with Lombardi (1791), believe, Dante is thinking alongthe lines found in Wisdom 7:25, where wisdom is described as “vapor … virtutisDei” (aura of the power of God). Since the prayer is, indeed, the Paternoster,it is only natural that it be addressed to the Father, with whatever(inevitable) trinitarian overtones.

Here the penitents of pride express a similar desire.[return to English [part0011.html#c11-s5-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c11-s5-i]]19–24.

[part0011.html#c11-s9-e] It is fair to say that no one is certain what theroot of the word ramogna (translated here as “safe haven”) is or what it reallymeans (see Porena [Pore.1947.1] and the entry for the word in ED IV [1973], pp.848–49). The early commentators mainly believed it meant a good journey, but onwhat authority one does not know. A plurality of modern commentators believe itmeans “good wishes,” but it seems strange to argue that the souls are prayingfor good wishes, for that would come close to being a mere tautology.

It is as though Virgil, remembering the “visiblespeech” from the representation of Trajan’s humility, had assumed these wordsworked wonders on Christian hearts, and now puts giustizia and pietà (found inthe same verse only in these two scenes) to work on his and Dante’s behalf.[return to English [part0011.html#c11-s13-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c11-s13-i]]46–48. [part0011.html#c11-s16-e] The source of the words heard by thetravelers is necessarily obscure, since the faces of all these souls areobscured by the rocks that they bear upon their backs. At the same time it ismorally appropriate that a penitent in pride must speak without identification,since pride is an insistence on the self, while this anonymity erases it.However, to argue that all are speaking together, as some do, is to miss thepatent fact that only one soul is speaking (v. 52).

[part0011.html#c11-s18-e] Stiff-necked pride was a frequent complaintabout the Hebrew people in the Old Testament, particularly in Exodus (32:9,33:3, 33:5, 34:9) and Deuteronomy (9:6, 9:13, 10:16, 31:27).

[part0011.html#c11-s20-e] The speaker is Omberto Aldobrandesco, secondson of Guglielmo Aldobrandesco (dead by 1256), count of Santafiora (see Purg.VI.111) and head of this powerful Ghibelline family. Omberto was murdered bySienese Guelphs outside his fortified castle in 1259. He lays the fault for hisdeath and the need for his current penance on his family’s pride in its name,which made the Aldobrandeschi consider themselves better than others merely byfact of being Aldobrandeschi.The reference to every fante in Campagnatico, Omberto’s feudal holding with itscastle, where he died in battle, is variously interpreted. The word in Dante’sItalian may mean (1) infantryman, (2) any man at all, especially one of thelower class, (3) a very young child. Most commentators support the third view(and we have followed them), but all three are potentially valid. [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c11-s20-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c11-s20-i]]70–72. [part0011.html#c11-s24-e] Omberto is the first penitent in purgatoryproper who speaks to the travelers (we have only heard penitential prayer untilnow) and his last words clearly identify the purpose of purgation in the processof absolution (for Dante, necessarily preceded by confession, contrition, andsatisfaction—see note to Purg. IX.94–102). What seems to be the case is that allthose who have penance to perform on any particular terrace need precisely togive satisfaction (see the verb sodisfaccia in verse 71 [as Tozer (1901) dulynoted]) before God for their transgressions on earth. This implies that others,those who do not need to do penance on a particular terrace, either were withoutthat sin or else had given satisfaction while they were still alive. This is theview taken by Nicola Fosca in his unpublished commentary, portions of which hehas kindly made available to this writer.Porena (1946), in his commentary to Purgatorio IX.112–114, also says that thepenitence observed on the mountain is the form that satisfactio operis takes inthese eventually redeemed souls.

[part0011.html#c11-s25-e] Dante’s bending down his face is a naturalaction taken in order to see his interlocutor’s face, yet it, too, reveals amoral significance (see note to vv. 46–48), as the protagonist’s own words willlater confirm (Purg. XIII.136–138), when he will admit that, once he returns tothe mountain in the next life, his head will be lowered under the same load henow is able to observe upon the backs of others.

[part0011.html#c11-s25-e] The next penitent is apparently less heavilyweighted (and thus less burdened by pride) than Omberto, since he is able tomove a little under his rock and thus twist his neck enough to get a glance atthe features of Dante, now conveniently lowered by his desire to make outOmberto. As a result, Dante recognizes him.Where the first penitent was still deeply involved in the feelings of the familypride that had afflicted him so greatly on earth, the next will represent allthose who are prideful in their accomplishments (in this case, artistic ones);and we will see that he is more advanced in his penitence than Omberto. [returnto English [part0011.html#c11-s25-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c11-s25-i]]79–81. [part0011.html#c11-s27-e] Oderisi d’Agobbio is praised by Dante as thegreat Italian master of the art of illuminating manuscripts, an art particularlyassociated with the French and with Paris. “Oderisi, who was the son of Guidod’Agobbio (Gubbio [a hill town in the Apennines, not far from Perugia]), was inresidence at Bologna in 1268, 1269, and 1271; he is said to have gone to Rome in1295, and to have died there in 1299. Vasari, who possessed some of hisdrawings, states that he was a friend of Giotto, and that he and Franco ofBologna were employed by Boniface VIII to illuminate MSS. in the Papal libraryat Rome. It appears from the text that Dante and Oderisi were acquainted, or atleast knew each other by sight” (T). [return to English[part0011.html#c11-s27-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c11-s27-i]]82–87. [part0011.html#c11-s28-e] Oderisi deflects Dante’s compliment, thusshowing that his pride is at least greatly abated (if not utterly vanquished—seeverse 84). What is at stake here is artistic merit, not the cry of the vulgar, asubject that will be before us within ten lines. What Oderisi can now admit isthat, as good as he was at illuminating, in his own opinion Franco of Bolognawas superior to him in his craftmanship—a truth that he knew but never wouldhave permitted himself to admit during his emulous life on earth. It isinteresting that Benvenuto da Imola says that, from the examples he has seen,Franco really was a better illuminator. By being willing to share the honor withFranco (this is exactly the burden of Purg. XIV.86–87, the words of Guido delDuca: “O race of men, why do you set your hearts / on things that of necessitycannot be shared?”), Oderisi shows himself now different from the man bent onhis own excelling to the cost of all others.Little is known of Franco, who apparently lived until about 1310. His work wasthe subject of an exhibition in Bologna in 2000. [return to English[part0011.html#c11-s28-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c11-s28-i]]88–90. [part0011.html#c11-s30-e] If Oderisi was known by Dante to have died in1299, he certainly had made his way up the mountain quickly, apparently spendingvery little time in ante-purgatory. Compare the case of Forese (Purg.XXIII.76–90), the most detailed information we are given in this cantica aboutpassing over certain terraces on the way toward the summit. And see the note tovv. 127–132.Oderisi, nonetheless, must have reformed his ways very early, since thelate-repentant spend equal time in ante-purgatory as they did while they wereunrepentant on earth. Or perhaps Dante thought or knew that he had died earlierthan we think. [return to English [part0011.html#c11-s30-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c11-s30-i]]91–93. [part0011.html#c11-s31-e] Oderisi’s outburst subtly changes the topicof his discourse from human talent and ability to its reception among otherhuman beings. Where before he had spoken of Franco’s honor, he now bewails theemptiness of these same talents as recipients of the praise conferred by fame.The phrase “com’ poco verde in su la cima dura” (literally: how briefly laststhe green upon the top) has never been adequately explained. What object doesthe poet have in mind for the noun cima? Hollander (Holl.1994.1) hasargued—citing its next use in the poem, Purgatorio XV.13, where it refers toDante’s forehead, the space above his eyebrows—that it refers to exactly thatpart of our physiognomy here and that the green is the green of the laurel. Thelanguage of the passage, which addresses the question of the brief limits offame unless a “dark age” allows fame to continue for longer than it usually does(by not producing other “winners” quickly), seems clearly to reflect exactlysuch a concern—one that was not far, as we know from Paradiso XXV.1–9, from thispoet’s mind. [return to English [part0011.html#c11-s31-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c11-s31-i]]94–96. [part0011.html#c11-s32-e] Giovanni Cimabue (ca. 1240–1308) was a highlypraised Florentine painter. His pupil, Giotto di Bondone (ca. 1267–1337), isgiven credit by art historians for changing the nature of Italian painting,moving from the “flat” tradition to “roundness,” representations that seemedmore realistic than anything seen before him. (In this vein see Boccaccio’streatment of him in Decameron VI.v.5.)The notion that Dante is in this passage putting Giotto’s art ahead of Cimabue’sis baseless, though widespread. Dante may himself have admired Giotto’s paintingmore than Cimabue’s, but that is not the point here. All that Oderisi is sayingis that, in accord with what he has just said about fame being brief unless adark age assures the last “laureate” his continuing green reward, Cimabue hadthe public’s cry but now Giotto has it. There is no evaluation of the relativeworth of the work of these two masters stated or implied. [return to English[part0011.html#c11-s32-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c11-s32-i]]97–98. [part0011.html#c11-s33-e] Moving his attention from painting to poetry,Oderisi says the same thing about Guido Guinizzelli (ca. 1225–1276) and GuidoCavalcanti (ca. 1250–1300): one held the highest place in the public’s esteemuntil the other displaced him. A problem here arises from Dante’s use of thenoun gloria, which can mean “reputation, fame” in the vulgar sense, or “justrenown for great deeds,” or “heavenly glory” (as in the experience of paradise).The word occurs some twenty-two times in the poem and has this first meaningless frequently than it has either of the other two, e.g., in Inferno III.42,where it is explained that the neutral angels are not in hell lest they beplaced lower than the rebel angels, who might then have “boasting rights” overthem. But the word has just been used in its most negative form seven linesearlier: the “vana gloria” that prompts our desire for fame. In this reading,the more recent Guido (Cavalcanti) has taken the public’s laurel fromGuinizzelli. [return to English [part0011.html#c11-s33-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c11-s33-i]]99. [part0011.html#c11-s33-e] While there is still some dispute about thereference, most now agree that Dante is clearly pointing to himself as the onewho will in turn replace Cavalcanti in the “nest” of the public’s admiration.Stierle (Stie.2001.1), p. 163, thinks Oderisi predicts Dante’s “triumph” hereand believes that Dante meant us to take from his words the understanding thathe believes pride a necessary and positive aspect of his own ingegno and notentirely to be dispraised. To medieval readers this would surely have seemed aninappropriate reading. On the other hand, recent modern readers, with whose workStierle seems not to be acquainted, have tried to make essentially the samecase: Barolini (Baro.1992.1), pp. 133–37, and Marks (Mark.1992.1).

[part0011.html#c11-s34-e] Oderisi’s moralizing is pungent and clear:earthly fame is not worth even a moment’s affection. It is difficult to justifyany positive role for earthly fame in light of these forceful words. [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c11-s34-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c11-s34-i]]105.

[part0011.html#c11-s37-e] Without as yet naming him, Oderisi tellsthe cautionary tale of Provenzan Salvani, “Ghibelline of Siena, where he was atthe head of affairs at the time of the great victory over the Florentine Guelfsat Montaperti, Sept. 4, 1260; it was he who at the Council of Empoli after thebattle advocated the destruction of the city of Florence, which was averted bythe firmness and patriotism of Farinata (Inf. X.91); he was Podestà ofMontepulciano in 1261; he met his death in an engagement with the Florentines atColle, in Valdelsa, June 11, 1269, when he was taken prisoner and beheaded” (T).It is curious that, of these two great Ghibelline leaders, Dante has condemnedFarinata (who saved the city) to hell and saved Provenzan (who wanted to destroyit).

[part0011.html#c11-s43-e] If Provenzan died in 1269 and was (as isobvious) more than thirty-one years old when he died, the protagonist wants toknow how, if the sentence in ante-purgatory is a year for each year spent infailure to repent and if Provenzan apparently, from Oderisi’s narrative, died inhis presumption, he can have come up here so quickly. We should remember thatDante was not surprised (see note to vv. 88–90) at Oderisi’s quick advent(perhaps less than a year separating his death and his arrival), somehowunderstanding that Oderisi had purged his pride quite early in his life andchosen to live for God. Why Dante might have thought so is not known. [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c11-s43-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c11-s43-i]]133–138.

[part0011.html#c11-s45-e] The phrasing here has its roots in—is indeed atranslation of—a passage in Bonaventure’s life of St. Francis, the Legenda maior(II.7), “omni deposita verecundia,” where Francis, setting aside all shame,becomes a mendicant. The attribution, which seems undeniable, has made its wayinto the commentary tradition over the last one hundred years, often unassigned.Bosco/Reggio and Marks (Mark.1992.1), p. 177 (n. 55), give credit to Passeriniin 1898.

[part0011.html#c12-s1-e] Dante and Oderisi are continuing their movementforward in humility, purging their pride in their differing ways until such timeas Virgil will insist on Dante’s pursuing other instruction. Strictly speaking,in ancient Greece a “pedagogue” was a slave whose task it was to guide childrento school and supervise their conduct generally (but not to teach them); inancient Rome the slave was frequently a Greek and had similar responsibilities,but also introduced the children to the beginning study of Greek. Dante’s word,pedagogo, here in one of its first appearances in the Italian vernacular,according to the Grande Dizionario (Batt.1961.1), has a brief but important role(occurring twice) in a single biblical passage, Paul’s Epistle to the Galatians3:24–25 (Longfellow [1867] seems to have been the first to note the possibleconnection). In that passage Paul imagines us as having once been, under the OldTestament, guided by the paedagogus (the Law) but as now being taught by Christ,and thus as no longer requiring such guidance. This Dantean hapax (a wordoccurring only once in a given universe of words) may reflect that biblicalnear-hapax.For the yoke that binds these two “oxen” see the commentary of Fallani (1965)and Scott’s lectura (Scot.2001.1), p. 174: “For my yoke is easy and my burdenlight” (Matthew 11:29–30)—the words of Christ preaching to potential followers.[return to English [part0011.html#c12-s1-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c12-s1-i]]4–6. [part0011.html#c12-s2-e] Virgil’s metaphor is probably developed, asBosco/Reggio (1978) insist, on Aeneid III.520: “velorum pandimus alas” (wespread the wings of our sails), a passage cited by many commentators at InfernoXXVI.125, “de’ remi facemmo ali” (we turned our oars to wings).Petrocchi, in his reading of the line, overturns the previously favored opinionthat Dante’s text read vele (sails), but has the disadvantage of forcing thepoet into a very mixed metaphor, “wings and oars.” We would have followed theolder reading, “sails and oars.” [return to English [part0011.html#c12-s2-e] /Italian [part0018.html#c12-s2-i]]7–9. [part0011.html#c12-s3-e] The protagonist walks erect, as Ovid describeshumans doing so as to be distinguished from brutes (Metam. I.84–86). Benvenutocites Ovid’s words and mentions the additional authority of Cicero, Sallust, andJuvenal on this matter in his comment to this passage.The word scemi, which we have translated as “shrunken,” has caused somediscomfort. What exactly does it mean? Aurigemma (Auri.1970.1), pp. 109–10,claims that Oderisi’s dour prophecy of Dante’s future ills (XI.140–141) leavesthe protagonist feeling monco (incomplete) until such time as that disaster willfinally confront him. He is following the nearly unanimous view found in theearliest commentators. However, since the time of Landino (1481) the more usualinterpretation relates Dante’s interior moral posture rather to his responses toPride, whether in pity for the souls he now sees or in recognition of his own(former) pridefulness—the most usual version of that position today, expressedin the form that currently rules by Torraca (1905), who notes the “heavyswelling” (Purg. XI.119) of pride that Dante is getting under control. As aresult, his thoughts are scemi in that they are lacking in pride. In otherwords, even if he has finally straightened up and begun walking as a confidenthuman being, his thoughts remain bowed under the burden of the recognition ofhis pridefulness. [return to English [part0011.html#c12-s3-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c12-s3-i]]12. [part0011.html#c12-s4-e] Dante’s new incredible lightness of being matchesVirgil’s usual state as soul unencumbered by body; getting his pride undercontrol, the protagonist experiences the greatest and quickest spiritual growthwe will observe in him during his ascent of the mountain. [return to English[part0011.html#c12-s4-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c12-s4-i]]13–15. [part0011.html#c12-s5-e] Now that Dante has experienced and embracedthe positive exemplars of Humility, Virgil wants to confirm his new state bymaking him experience the negative exemplars of Pride in order to seal his“conversion” to humility. For exemplarity in the Middle Ages and in Dante seeDelcorno (Delc.1989.1), esp. Chapter VI, “Dante e Peraldo,” pp. 195–227. And forhis discussion of the exemplars in this canto as deriving in part from WilliamPeraldus’s Summa vitiorum, see pp. 210–14; Delcorno shows that Dante’s list ofsix biblical exemplars of Pride is related to Peraldus’s first seven in his listof twelve biblical exemplars. Dante shares five of his six with Peraldus,substituting (for Adam) Nimrod (a choice, one might add, that underlines thepoet’s understandable concern with language—see note to Inf. XXXI.67). Then, intypical Dantean fashion, he adds six pagan exemplars to his shortened andrevised version of Peraldus’s list. For perhaps the first modern recognition ofthe importance of Peraldus’s listing and description of the vices for Dante, seeWenzel (Wenz.1965.1), pointing out that Pietro di Dante’s commentary toPurgatorio XVII (1340) relies strictly and extensively upon Peraldus’s phrasing(wherever he found his version of Peraldus’s text) for his description of theseven mortal sins.

[part0011.html#c12-s9-e] Reading down the left-hand margin of theverses, we find a series of repeated letters beginning a series of tercets. Theyspell out a word. Lia Baldelli, “acrostico” (ED I [1970], p. 44), points outthat perception of Dante’s deployment of this technique escaped the attention ofthe early commentators; it was only in 1898 that Antonio Medin noticed thepresence of the acrostic in these lines, the word VOM [or UOM, uomo, or “man”],while the presence of a similar acrostic, found at Paradiso XIX.115–141,yielding LVE [or LUE, “plague”], was only noted by Francesco Flamini in 1903.Most now accept the fact, despite a perhaps understandable modern distaste forsuch contrivance, that these two acrostics were deliberately constructed by theauthor (see, for more on Dante’s acrostic proclivities, Scott [Scot.2001.1], p.176 and n.). For a discussion of negative critical reactions to the acrostic onaesthetic grounds, as well as of its function in its context here, see Aurigemma(Auri.1970.1), pp. 113–19.

XXXI.28–33 for his association withthose other emblems of Pride, the giants who stormed Olympus). He isintrinsically opposed to the first exemplar of humility, the Virgin Mary, as isevident. When Dante drew near to the end of his poem (Par. XXXIII.2), heunderlined this with a verse in description of Mary, “umile e alta più checreatura” (humble and exalted more than any creature), reflecting hisdescription of (the unnamed) Lucifer here, who was more noble when he wascreated than any other creature. Trucchi (1936) observes Dante’s borrowing fromthe Bible, his “folgoreggiando scender” (fall like lightning from the sky)echoing the similar phrase in Luke 10:18: “Satanam, sicut fulgur de coelocadentem” ([I beheld] Satan as lightning fall from heaven).

[part0011.html#c12-s10-e] We finally catch a glimpse of Briareus, soimportant an absence in the amusing business that occupies Dante and Virgil inInferno XXXI.97–105 (and see the corresponding note), when Virgil denies Dantethe sight of this giant, whom he has described, in his Aeneid, as having fiftyheads and one hundred arms. Dante makes him, from what we can see, an “ordinary”giant, a pagan version of Lucifer for his presumption in challenging Jove.Briareus is mentioned in the three major martial epics that Dante knew and used,Aeneid X.565, Thebaid II.596, Pharsalia IV.596.

[part0011.html#c12-s11-e] Uniquely among the twelve sets of exemplars,the nonexemplary figures are the ones named (Apollo by his epithet Thymbraeus,Minerva by her second name [Pallas], and Mars), those who witnessed the defeatof the unnamed, exemplary giants (including Briareus), undone by thethunderbolts of Jove, their father. These exemplars are, in a wonderfullyappropriate “punishment,” present only as disiecta membra, the scattered remainsof the outsized human creatures they once were.

When she boasted that shewas a better mother than Latona, who had but two offspring (even though thesewere Apollo and Diana), in the Ovidian world it is clear what will happen next:the two arrow-shooting siblings wipe out the children of Niobe who, turned tostone, nonetheless bewails their loss with eternal tears that flow perpetuallyas mountain streams (Metam.

Mortally wounded and fearful of beingcaptured by the enemy, he fell upon his sword (I Samuel 31:1–4). David’ssubsequent curse on the surrounding mountains, the witnesses of this scene (IISamuel 1:21), asks that neither rain nor dew reach this place in Samaria.This exemplar of a prideful suicide throws into sharp relief the far differentsuicide of Cato the Younger, with reference to which Purgatorio opens.

[part0011.html#c12-s17-e] In Statius’s Thebaid (IV.187–213), Alcmaeon,son of Amphiaraus, the seer (who is, in a certain sense, a stand-in for Statiushimself [see note to Inf. XX.31–39]), is left with the task of avenging hisfather’s death. This came about after his wife, the mother of Alcmaeon,Eriphyle, betrayed his whereabouts to Polynices for the price of a necklace,with the result that Amphiaraus (see Inf. XX.31–36), who had foreseen thedreadful end of the civil war in Thebes and had hidden himself in order toescape his own death in it, ended up fighting and dying in the war. He pledgedhis son to avenge him, which indeed he did do by slaying his own mother. Thatthe necklace, made by no less an artisan than Vulcan, had belonged to thegoddess Harmonia marked Eriphyle’s pride in thinking herself worthy of wearingit. As was the case for Lucifer, the first exemplary figure in this listing,Eriphyle is not named. [return to English [part0011.html#c12-s17-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c12-s17-i]]52–54.

[part0011.html#c12-s19-e] In Paulus Orosius’s Historiae adversuspaganos (II.vii.6), Dante could have read of Cyrus the Elder, founder and kingof the Persian Empire ca. 560 B.C. He died in battle against the Massagetae, inScythia (529 B.C.), when he was ambushed by the queen of his enemies, Tomyris,who not only killed him, but had his decapitated head put into a vesselcontaining human blood and, according to Orosius, uttered words that closelyresemble what Dante reports she said.

[part0011.html#c12-s20-e] The Assyrian general, Holofernes, was thevictim of decapitation by the hand of Judith (see Iudith 13:1–13). “The leavingsof that slaughter” are evidently the members of his decapitated body.This last pair of classical/biblical parallels is painfully exact, withvainglorious military males opposed by skillful women who cut their heads off.[return to English [part0011.html#c12-s20-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c12-s20-i]]61–63. [part0011.html#c12-s21-e] The final example serves as a sort of summaryfor the entire acrostic. For the medieval tradition that Troy was indeedprideful see Scott (Scot.2001.1), pp. 182–83. Dante’s phrasing probably reflectsAeneid III.2–3, “superbum / Ilium,” with the phrase to be read in a moralizing(“proud Troy”) rather than an architectural (“lofty-towered Troy”) manner.

[part0011.html#c12-s24-e] In Purgatorio X.121–129, in the wake ofekphrastic poetry, Dante addresses the prideful sinners among his readers; henow does a similar turn here, using the rhetorical trope of antiphrasis, i.e.,expressing the opposite of what one says by means of a sarcastic tone of voice.[return to English [part0011.html#c12-s24-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c12-s24-i]]77.

[part0011.html#c12-s27-e] Singleton suggests that, since this is theonly angel actually to move toward Dante, his gesture is meant to suggesthumility. However, as Simone Marchesi has pointed out, responding to a draft ofthese notes, the Angel of Mercy even more certainly seems to approach Dante(Purg. XV.27–30).

[part0011.html#c12-s27-e] The last signal of the time of day occurred atPurgatorio X.13–16, where we learned that it was sometime after 9 AM. Here, inmetaphoric language that presents the hours of the morning as the handmaids ofthe day, serving her highness one at a time and in succession, we learn that itis noon.

The debate has been active for years. Aurigemma (Auri.1970.1), pp.123–25, after reviewing various arguments, opts for the notion that it is Dantewho speaks. The closeness of the sentiment expressed here to that found atX.121–129 (with its “angelic butterfly” at verse 125), which issues from thepoet’s mouth, would seem to support the idea that it is the poet who speaks hereas well. Nonetheless, we have followed Petrocchi’s punctuation, and it does notallow for the attribution of these lines to the poet. The main arguments fordoing so are that for Dante to allude so clearly to his own special election is,even for him, a bit bold; further, the lack of indication of a second and newspeaker and the abruptness that would result from such a shift both argue forPetrocchi’s view; still further, only the angel could state as a fact that sofew are chosen to rise this far. On the other hand, no other angel makescomments about humankind that are as harsh as these, since the seven angels ofpurgatory are celebrating the continuing ascent of this special visitor to themountain. Perhaps the fullest, fairest, and most helpful gloss to the passage isPoletto’s (1894) and he, after careful debate, comes down on the side of theattribution of these words to the angel.

[part0011.html#c12-s33-e] The angel’s wing-clap has had a result that willonly become known at vv. 121–126: one of the P’s on Dante’s brow has beenremoved. This is perhaps another reason to believe that Dante has not spoken thelast words, which might seem more self-congratulatory than humble.

The site of the church of San Miniato al Monte, whichis set above and across the Arno from the city, afforded then (as it does now)one of the surpassingly beautiful views of Florence. The Rubaconte Bridge (nowknown as the Ponte alle Grazie) was named for its builder in 1237, the podestàRubaconte da Mandello da Milano, according to Giovanni Villani’s Cronica(VI.26).The phrase “the justly governed city” is obviously ironic. For Dante’s only useof this word see the last (and incomplete) sentence in De vulgari eloquentia(II.xiv.2) where poets are seen as either writing in praise or in blame of theirsubjects, i.e. (among other categories), either gratulanter or yronice.The poet remembers the “good old days” when “registers and measures could betrusted,” i.e., before the civil authorities became corrupt, when they keptproper records and gave proper amounts of salt (without withholding some fortheir own profit). Documentation of these illicit activities may be found inample detail in Singleton’s commentary to vv. 104–105. [return to English[part0011.html#c12-s34-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c12-s34-i]]110. [part0011.html#c12-s37-e] The ritual occurring here, involving anadaptation of a Beatitude spoken by Jesus, will recur on the next six terracesas well. The Sermon on the Mount seems to include eight beatitudes (Matthew5:3–10). For discussion of Dante’s use of them, see Federigo Tollemache,“beatitudini evangeliche,” ED I (1970). Tollemache points out that St. Thomas,whose discussion of the Beatitudes (ST I.ii.69.3 ad 5) seems to govern Dante’streatment of them, says there are seven, with “Blessed are the meek” (Matthew5:5 [5:4 in the Vulgate]) omitted, while those that “hunger and thirst afterrighteousness” are remembered on separate terraces. Thomas considers “those whoare persecuted for righteousness’ sake” to refer to all of the first sevencategories. Here the reference is to the first: “Blessed are the poor in spirit,for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” For a discussion of the program of theBeatitudes in Purgatorio see Chiavacci Leonardi (Chia.1984.2).

[part0011.html#c12-s43-e] Anyone who has played the version of pokerknown as “hatband” will immediately understand this concluding simile, thelighthearted tone of which culminates only logically in Virgil’s smile. Havingsubdued his pride (and he knows how afflicted he is by this sin—see Purg.XIII.133–138), the protagonist feels lighter, better, as though his trip throughpurgation were half finished already. And thus this canto ends with a lighterand happier feeling than any that precedes it, offering a sort of foretaste ofEdenic innocence.

[part0011.html#c13-s1-e] The whole mountain, by virtue of the way inwhich it is seven times sliced away, resembles a huge circular stairway cut instone. The travelers’ arrival at the second of these terraces coincides with acanto beginning. This is the only time that such a coincidence occurs in thiscantica. It is as though Dante wanted to acknowledge the reader’s expectationthat the arrival at each terrace might coincide with the beginning of a canto,thus forcing that reader to speculate upon the aesthetic reasons for the poet’snot being overly “neat.”The verb dismalare is almost certainly a Dantean coinage; we have tried toreflect its unusual character in our translation with an English coinage:“unsins.” [return to English [part0011.html#c13-s1-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c13-s1-i]]7. [part0011.html#c13-s3-e] The verse “Ombra non lì è né segno che si paia”(There are no shades nor any carvings) has drawn some more complicateddiscussions than our translation would call for. As does Musumarra(Musu.1967.1), p. 442, we believe that the word ombra here means a “shade,” andis to be distinguished from segno, which here means “designs,” i.e., such as theintaglios that were found on the preceding terrace. In other words, thetravelers see neither penitents nor carvings as they first examine this newspace. Some others are of the opinion that both words refer to the shapes anddesigns on the wall of the terrace of Pride and not even the first of them tothe penitents themselves. However, once the latter become manifest to Dante andVirgil, they are referred to as ombre; in fact this word is used as often inthis canto as in any other of the poem. It appears here and then at vv. 47, 68,83, 100; it is clear that all four of these later uses also refer to “shades.”[return to English [part0011.html#c13-s3-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c13-s3-i]]8–9. [part0011.html#c13-s3-e] The barren “landscape” of the terrace of Envycontrasts with the highly wrought carvings that greet the travelers on that ofPride (Purg. X.28–33), as does the livid color of this place contrast with thegleaming whiteness found below. For all its vanity, Pride is a sin that has itsvitality and brightness. Here all is the livid, or gray-blue (as in a bruise)color of stone. The sin of envy, as Dante has already acknowledged (Inf. I.111;and see accompanying note), was the cause of death’s entering the world becauseof the envy Satan felt for God. This sin, much less present in the modernimagination than it was in the minds of medieval thinkers, was seen asparticularly pernicious and widespread. Most of us tend to think of envy as aform of jealousy, motivated by the desire to possess a good that someone elseholds. In Dante’s time it represented, instead, the negative wish that thisperson lose his or her goods, his or her apparent advantage. It is thus not aform of avarice, but the expression of resentment against the perceivedhappiness of others. For a compelling modern example, see Prince Myshkin’s wordsto the agonized and resentful Ippolit in Dostoevsky’s The Idiot: “Forgive us ourhappiness.” In the next canto, Guido del Duca will give it a similar expression(see Purg. XIV.82–84).Fernando Salsano presents the salient features of this sin in Dante; see hisentry “invidia,” ED III (1971); for a discussion of the sin in English seeCassell, “Envy,” in the Dante Encyclopedia (Lans.2000.1).

III.52–56),seeing no one present who may give directions, assumes that the situation isworse than it actually is. [return to English [part0011.html#c13-s4-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c13-s4-i]]13–21. [part0011.html#c13-s5-e] Virgil’s prayer to the sun (his only prayer inthe poem) has drawn conflicting interpretations over the centuries. Is it, asmost early commentators believed, a prayer to the Christian God (possibly forhis grace), expressed in a metaphor (and surely the sun is a frequent metaphorfor God in medieval culture and in this poem)? Is it directed to disembodied“speculative reason” as some other early commentators, followed by many moderns,believed? Or is it a prayer to the sun itself, unallegorized, for the light thatwill reveal the path that must be chosen? This is the position of a number ofmoderns, Porena (1946) perhaps the most convincing of these, citing PurgatorioI.107–108, where Cato tells the travelers that the sun’s light will show themtheir way. Bosco/Reggio (1978), in a similar anti-allegorical vein, point outthat the next lines (vv. 19–21) speak only of the physical properties of thesun’s light, as was true in the verses spoken by Cato in the first canto of thiscantica. It seems prudent to allow a literal meaning that makes sense to standalone, without further interpretive scaffolding. Indeed, if, as Virgil says, thesun’s light should serve as guide unless a better source be found, he cannot bespeaking of any final authority, whether God or rational certainty, neither ofwhich may be superseded by secondary causes.

[part0011.html#c13-s9-e] Virgil’s prayer to the sun is not answered;instead, supernatural voices are heard flying overhead, bearing the identitiesof the positive exemplary figures of the virtue opposed to envy, charity. This“banquet” of affection recalls the controlling metaphor of Dante’s unfinishedtreatise, Convivio. [return to English [part0011.html#c13-s9-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c13-s9-i]]28–30. [part0011.html#c13-s10-e] Mary’s voice is—we are not surprised todiscover, given our experience of the positive exemplars in PurgatorioX.40–45—the first whose words are represented by a flying voice. Dante nevermakes clear how these sounds are made or by whom, but we may be sure that theirsources are not present on this terrace, as we know that Mary is in paradise(while one of the negative exemplars, Cain, in Purg. XIV.133, is probably inhell, since one of its final zones is named for him [see Inf. V.107 andXXXII.58]).The biblical scene invoked is that of the marriage feast at Cana of Galilee whenMary tells Jesus there is no wine left for the guests (“Vinum non habent”) andJesus shortly thereafter turns water to wine (John 2:1–7). [return to English[part0011.html#c13-s10-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c13-s10-i]]31–33. [part0011.html#c13-s11-e] Orestes is known to Dante in two basiccontexts, first as the avenger of his family honor as the killer of hisadulterous mother, Clytemnestra; second, as the friend of Pylades. When, afterthese two friends have also killed the adulterous Aegisthus and Orestes issought for capital punishment, Pylades cries out “Ego sum Orestes” (I amOrestes), while Orestes, not to be outdone, shouts “Immo enimvero ego sum,inquam, Orestes” (But I truly am, I say to you, Orestes—Cicero, De finibusV.xxii.63 [and see De amicitia VII.24]). According to the commentators, thissecond voice is either that of Orestes, of Pylades, or somehow relates to bothof these. We believe the speaker is Pylades.

[part0011.html#c13-s12-e] The third exemplar is Jesus Christ, callingon his disciples to return love for hatred (see Matthew 5:44, where the wordsare a bit more expansive than they are here: “Diligite inimicos vestros,benefacite his qui oderunt vos [love your enemies, do good to those who hateyou]). The first two voices are identical with their sources, the first, Latinword for Latin word; the second, a perfect Italian translation of the Latinoriginal. The last, however, is a looser Italian version of the Vulgate’s Latin.[return to English [part0011.html#c13-s12-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c13-s12-i]]37–42. [part0011.html#c13-s13-e] This is the first precise verbal formulationof the mode of purgatorial instruction by examples: first one is spurred toimitate the good, then dissuaded from following the bad, the goad and the bitthat we have already encountered and will continue to come to know on eachterrace. Having understood how these functions were experienced on the firstterrace, Virgil now correctly surmises that, if the travelers have now heard thegoad, they will hear the bit before they confront the angel with his blessingand leave this terrace.

[part0011.html#c13-s15-e] The coloration of the garments worn by thepenitents in Envy is so close to that of the rocks themselves that it has takenVirgil a long while to make them out; he only now calls them to Dante’sattention—and the protagonist has had no sense of their presence at all.Envy, which is so clearly aware of difference, is cloaked in a uniform thatmakes distinction of difference nearly impossible. As Dante interacts with thesepenitents, it is clear that he has a hard time making out the features of anyone of them. [return to English [part0011.html#c13-s15-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c13-s15-i]]49–51. [part0011.html#c13-s17-e] The voices we hear now emanate from thepenitents on the terrace, not from unknown sources overhead. As Bosco/Reggiosuggest, they cry out only the invocations of litanies because the rest of theirtexts would not be appropriate here, since these passages regard earthly illsand temptations, no longer of potential harm to these souls.

[part0011.html#c13-s18-e] Perhaps no passage indicates more clearly thedisparity of attitude required of an onlooker in hell and purgatory. There thegrowth in the protagonist was measured, in part, by his ability not to respondpityingly; here compassion is an essential part of his ceremonial purgation.

[part0011.html#c13-s20-e] The envious in life were not involved insupporting others; the contrary was their care.

[part0011.html#c13-s21-e] Those who looked upon their fellows inunseeing ways (the sin invidia was etymologized in the Middle Ages as in +videre, i.e., more usually as “not seeing,” but sometimes also understood as“seeing against,” another being [see Bigongiari (Bigo.1964.1), pp. 90–91]) nowhope for the opposite, to be looked upon with pity. Like Satan, the avatar ofEnvy, the envious soul is proud as well. And the proud cannot bear pity. Thesepenitents show compassionate affection for one another as part of theirpurgation of Envy. The language of the simile reminds the reader of specialoccasions on which the Church offered indulgences to its flock on a given feastday or similar occasion; such “pardons” provided targets of opportunity tomendicants outside churches or other holy places. Dante’s language also allowsus to see the theatricality implicit in the act of begging; we are now, however,asked to believe in the wholehearted sincerity of these posthumous penitents.[return to English [part0011.html#c13-s21-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c13-s21-i]]67–72. [part0011.html#c13-s23-e] The aesthetic abnegation of this terrace iseased somewhat by these two back-to-back similes. Fastening our attention on theclosed eyes of the envious, Dante compares them to the sewn-up eyes of sparrowhawks, captured in their maturity and temporarily blinded in this manner so thatthey remain docile in the presence of their handlers. The penitents’ eyes aresewn, not with the thread used on hawks and falcons, but with iron wire. [returnto English [part0011.html#c13-s23-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c13-s23-i]]73–78. [part0011.html#c13-s25-e] Dante, feeling sheepish about his position ofprivileged and unnoticed onlooker, is “read” by Virgil as he and Dante have beenreading the feelings of the equally mute penitents. Virgil gives Dantepermission to address them—and indeed withdraws from colloquy himself for therest of this and nearly all the next canto (his next words will be heard only atPurg. XIV.143).

[part0011.html#c13-s29-e] The protagonist’s labored and heavilyrhetoricized captatio (including periphrastic references to the twin rivers ofpurgatory, Lethe and Eunoe) is perhaps meant to contrast with Sapia’s far moreimmediate and direct response (vv. 94–96). He wants to find an Italian for hiscast of characters and promises, in return, a prayer to speed the process ofpurgation. How ironically we are meant to take this speech is not clear, butBosco/Reggio are derisive about Dante’s “overblown rhetoric” here.

[part0011.html#c13-s32-e] The response by the shade who, we will soondiscover, is Sapia, is a polite but incisive correction of the question sheanswers. (1) Dante had set the penitent souls apart from others, even fromhimself; Sapia joins them all in fellowship with a single word, frate. (2) Dantehad spoken of earthly territories; Sapia makes all those beloved of God citizensof His city alone. (3) Dante had spoken of Italianness as a present condition;Sapia insists that geographical/political identities on earth were only fleetingand are now irrelevant.

[part0011.html#c13-s35-e] The protagonist’s question receives itsfirst answer, as nearly anonymous as it can be, with the exception of theidentification of the speaker’s homeland, and thus responding to only one partof the protagonist’s request (“make yourself known by your city or your name”).Knowing only this much, our memories return to the last shade and, indeed, thelast Sienese we encountered, Provenzan Salvani, his story recounted by Oderisiin Purg. XI.120–138. There we heard about his triumph in humility; here we willbecome aware, between the lines, of the horror of his death.The word rimendo (verse 107), meaning “mending,” “stitching back together,” isPetrocchi’s replacement for the former reading, rimondo, “cleansing,”“purifying.” There are those who continue to take issue with Petrocchi’semendation, e.g., Stephany (Step.1991.1), pp. 76–77. [return to English[part0011.html#c13-s35-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c13-s35-i]]109–111. [part0011.html#c13-s37-e] Punning on her name, she now identifiesherself as Sapia if not savia (sapient) and speaks of her envious nature (seenote to vv. 8–9).For the history of the gradually more certain identification of Sapia, seeGiorgio Varanini, “Sapia” (ED IV [1976], p. 26). Most now accept the work ofnineteenth-century students of the problem, which demonstrated that she, bornca. 1210, was a noblewoman of Siena, an aunt of Provenzan Salvani (Purg.XI.121–142), and wife of one Ghinibaldo Saracini. After the battle of Colle Vald’Elsa in 1269 and before her death (sometime between 1275 and 1289) she gavemuch of her wealth to a hospital (S. Maria dei Pellegrini) that she and herhusband (who had died before the great battle) had founded in 1265 in Siena.[return to English [part0011.html#c13-s37-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c13-s37-i]]112–123. [part0011.html#c13-s38-e] Sapia’s narrative falls into two parts,this first containing the evidence of her former sinfulness, exemplified mostsavagely in her admission of her joy in witnessing the death of her own people,most probably Provenzan Salvani, her nephew.As for Provenzan (a rough Sienese equivalent of the Florentine Farinata [Inf.X]), the man who led the Sienese Ghibellines in their triumph over the Guelphsof Florence at Montaperti in 1260 and the leading Ghibelline soldier of hiscity, he was captured in the battle of Colle Val d’Elsa, some ten milesnorthwest of Siena, and decapitated. According to Giovanni Villani (CronicaVII.31), his head, at the end of a pike, was then marched around the battlefieldby his triumphant French and Florentine Guelph enemies. Since Sapia was also aGhibelline it is difficult or impossible to know why she was so pleased by hisdeath (most assume that Provenzan is among the “townsmen” whose death broughther so much pleasure). Since her sin was envy, it seems clear that Dante wantsus to understand that she resented his and/or other townsmen’s position andfame, that her involvement was personal, not political. [return to English[part0011.html#c13-s38-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c13-s38-i]]124–129. [part0011.html#c13-s42-e] Before her death, Sapia’s change of heartbrought her back to the love of God and her neighbor. As for Pier Pettinaio,whose second name is not a family name but an epithet denoting his profession,i.e., he sold combs to ladies (pettine means “comb”), it was his prayerfulintervention after her death that reduced her time in ante-purgatory. Since shehas been dead between twenty-five and eleven years, and since we would assumeshe would have spent at least a little time on the terrace of Pride, she hassurely moved quickly up the mountain, sped by Pier’s prayers. A “native of Campiin the Chianti district NE. of Siena, he was a hermit of the Franciscan Order,and dwelt in Siena, where he was renowned for his piety and miracles. Ubertinoda Casale (Par. XII.124) in the prologue to his Arbor Vitae Crucifixae Jesumentions that he had received spiritual instruction from him. Pier died on Dec.5, 1289, and was buried at Siena, where he was long venerated as a saint, in ahandsome tomb erected at the public expense” (T). [return to English[part0011.html#c13-s42-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c13-s42-i]]130–132. [part0011.html#c13-s44-e] Sapia now, having satisfied Dante’squestion in both its points, asks after his identity. Having heard him breathe,she divines that he is present in the flesh (but has no sense of Virgil’spresence as his guide, thus motivating the exchange that follows at vv.139–142).

[part0011.html#c13-s45-e] Dante’s admission of his culpability inPride is a brilliant stroke, taking that stick out of his reader’s hand andalso, in some strange way, convincing us that this prideful poet has become,under the burden of this poem, humble—or something like that. It also serves tofree him from the curse of every artist (as Oderisi knew): the emulousconsideration of his or her competitors, from which he pronounces himselftotally free. [return to English [part0011.html#c13-s45-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c13-s45-i]]143–144. [part0011.html#c13-s48-e] The protagonist fulfills the terms of thecondition he had offered at verse 93: if an Italian will come forward, he willpray for that soul.

[part0011.html#c13-s49-e] Sapia’s acceptance of Dante’s offer ofprayer, making him her second Pier Pettinaio, is accepted with a grace that isalso morally telling: she may have envied Provenzan his prowess and his fame,but not Dante, who has won the greatest victory of anyone, coming to theafterworld in the flesh. She responds to his charity for her with charity.[return to English [part0011.html#c13-s49-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c13-s49-i]]151–154. [part0011.html#c13-s51-e] These four lines produce perhaps the mostdebated passage in this canto. Before approaching that controversy, it may behelpful to understand some of the rather recondite references in play here. In1303, Siena purchased the seaport called Talamone, on the Mediterranean coastabout fifteen miles away, in order to have better access to shipping routes; theproblem was that the dredging necessary to keep the waters between Siena and thesea negotiable was an overwhelming problem. Consequently, the project had to beabandoned soon after the funds had been appropriated to support it. Similarly,another civic works project involved a search for an underground river (namedDiana because the statue of the goddess had stood in the market square of thecity); it too was a failure. The final frecciata, or gibe, of Sapia is tosuggest that the biggest losers in the scheme to acquire a harbor on the seawill be the admirals. This word has been greatly debated: does Sapia refer toactual admirals? to investors in the scheme? to those who sold participation inthe enterprise? It seems clear that Dante is making Sapia joke for him (Sienajokes being for Florentines what Harvard jokes are for Yalies). This writer’sview is that the playfully nasty phrase is precisely similar to one still in usetoday: “the Swiss navy.” The phrase requires that we recognize that the Swisscannot have a navy because they do not have an ocean to put a navy on—exactlythe same condition in which we find the Sienese. For a similar appreciation seePorena’s lengthy discussion (1946) of these verses.Sapia, as we have seen, is a moving figure, convincingly grappling with herformer sin and seemingly in control of it. It seems clear that every verse shespeaks in this canto is stamped by that change in her character, including hershrewd understanding of exactly what she was like within herself, precisely whatshe sounded like to others. It is a remarkable exercise in self-awareness. Onthe other hand, some argue that these final lines show that she is still verymuch in the grip of her old failing. Here, for example, is Singleton’s analysis:“Thus, by this jibe at her fellow-townsmen, it is clear that Sapia can still bemalicious and still has time to serve on this terrace, purging away suchfeelings.” This is a fairly typical reaction. It should be observed that, ifthese last remarks present a soul still sinful, her sin is not Envy. She may beinsensitive, perhaps, but not envious. First of all, she is speaking only of afew Sienese here, the would-be big shots in whose company Dante may find herdecent relatives. Second, her remarks are not intended to affect these thievesand fools, but only (perhaps) to aid her relatives in fending off their wiles—ifthey are intended to have any practical worldly effect at all. Both Cassell(Cass.1984.1) and Stephany (Step.1991.1), pp. 83–86, support the view ofMusumarra (Musu.1967.1), pp. 461–67, that Sapia’s words are not to be read asevidence of her slipping back into the sin of Envy but rather as reflecting herdesire to help her familiars and fellow citizens escape from the devastationsthat will befall them because of their misguided civic pride. In such readings,Sapia’s last moment in the poem (and she has been given more of its space,forty-nine verses [106–154], than anyone encountered on the mountain except forOderisi [XI.79–142—much of whose speech is devoted to the discussion of others]after the extended meeting with Sordello [Purg. VI–VIII]) is not offered up as akind of recantation. Rather, this sharp-tongued, witty, and self-understandingwoman ends her words with charity for all who have chosen the true way, alongwith acerbic wit for those who are governed by foolishness and pride. If thatsounds like a description of the poet who created her, so be it. [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c13-s51-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c13-s51-i]]PURGATORIO XIV1–3. [part0011.html#c14-s1-e] These words do not, as we might assume, issuefrom Sapia, but from a new speaker, the dominant presence in this canto. He isGuido del Duca, as we will discover at verse 81 (see note to that verse). Hisrather salty way of responding to the news (broadcast at Purg. XIII.142, whenGuido overheard Dante speaking to Sapia) that Dante is here in the flesh, is aman “who can open his eyes at will and shut them,” will turn out to be typicalof his bluntness, which finds its foil in the indirect and extremely polite waysof his interlocutor, Rinieri da Calboli. Guido cannot see that Dante can see him(we recall that Dante was sensitive about his favored status in this respect atPurg. XIII.73–74) but surmises that, as a living soul, Dante has the ocularpower that is taken from all those who are purging their envy on this terrace.This does not make him a source of envy for these souls, but of wonder (see vv.13–14).

[part0011.html#c14-s2-e] The second speaker, Rinieri da Calboli (see noteto vv. 88–90), a sort of precursor of one of Marcel Proust’s famously overpolitegreat-aunts, addresses Dante only through his companion, Guido. Thecharacterization of the two respondents to Dante’s presence is reminiscent, inits handling of such dramatically differing personalities, of the representationof character in the colloquy among Dante, Farinata, and Cavalcante in Inferno X.[return to English [part0011.html#c14-s2-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c14-s2-i]]7. [part0011.html#c14-s3-e] We here learn that these are speakers we have notheard before. For a moment it is as though we were as “blind” as the penitentsand dependent on what we hear said by the narrator to understand who is involvedin this colloquy. [return to English [part0011.html#c14-s3-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c14-s3-i]]10–13. [part0011.html#c14-s4-e] Sapia (Purg. XIII.130) had wanted to knowDante’s identity; his response was to identify himself only as a person who had(at least until now) been prideful in his life. Now Guido (the speaker is notidentified, but we safely assume, both from the rotation of speakers and fromthe forthright quality of his question, that it is he) asks to know both hishomeland and his name; Dante will modestly offer only the first piece ofinformation. He has learned, we surmise, something about Pride in his few hourson that terrace. [return to English [part0011.html#c14-s4-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c14-s4-i]]14–15. [part0011.html#c14-s5-e] Guido’s amazement at Dante’s condition doestwo things quickly and neatly; it shows that he (and Rinieri) are not envious ofhis condition and it allows Dante not to have to insist pridefully on hisuniqueness, something that Guido has done for him. Once we find out who thesetwo are, we realize that these now fraternal souls were, on earth, a Ghibelline(Guido) and a Guelph (Rinieri). These details may remind us of the far lessfraternal interaction between Farinata (a Ghibelline) and Cavalcante (a Guelph)in Inferno X.

Its source is in the Apennines at Mt.Falterona and it then makes its way, as we shall hear, through the Casentino,then the cities of Arezzo, Florence, and Pisa, before it reaches the sea.Giovanna Ioli (Ioli.1989.1), p. 210, points out that the verb saziare (slake)introduces the theme of hunger to this description of the Arno. The river seems,in order to satisfy its own appetites, not to extend far enough, despite all theharm its approximately 150 miles (and not Dante’s 100) produces.

This is perhaps less the result of modesty than the poet’sreflection on his wandering condition in his exile, much of which was to bespent in Tuscany, though not in Florence.

[part0011.html#c14-s7-e] Dante’s modesty here is gainsaid by hisprevious inclusion among the great poets of all time in Inferno IV.100–102.There are those who claim that in 1300 he had not indeed become particularlyfamous and that this is the reason for his modesty here. It would rather seem tobe that he is keeping in mind the lessons in humility he has just learned on thelast terrace. Further, he clearly expects that fame will one day find him.However, the only time his name is used in the Commedia it is spoken, not forpraise, but in denunciation of his disloyalty by Beatrice (Purg. XXX.55).[return to English [part0011.html#c14-s7-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c14-s7-i]]22–24. [part0011.html#c14-s8-e] The rhyme word accarno, a hapax, derives, ascommentators point out, from the word used to describe an animal that has caughtanother and is biting into its flesh (carne). Guido’s third speech unravels thefairly simple riddle that conceals the river’s name. [return to English[part0011.html#c14-s8-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c14-s8-i]]25–27. [part0011.html#c14-s9-e] Rinieri once again addresses Guido in order topose a question for Dante to answer. We can now see that this is the centraltrait of his personality as explored in this canto. (He only speaks twice, atotal of six lines, and yet we feel we know him. We will see his sad expressionin vv. 70–72 but he will not speak again.) Guido’s peremptory, forward manner insome ways matches, in bono, the Tuscan (western) side of the Apennines,presented as being ferocious; Rinieri’s diffident attitude is perhaps meant toreflect his connection with the good folk (now long gone) from the eastern sideof those mountains, in the Romagna.

[part0011.html#c14-s10-e] Guido’s opening verbal gesture of disdainsets the stage for his serial denunciation of the mountain hamlets and cities ofthe plain along the Arno. For the resonance of Job 18:17: “Memoria illius pereatde terra” (and may memory of him vanish from the earth) see Tommaseo (1837) onthis tercet.

[part0011.html#c14-s11-e] Guido first indicates the length of theentire river, from the mountain range (the Apennines) “from which Pelorus wasbroken off” to the sea on the other side of Pisa, where the river deposits itswaters to replace that moisture drawn by the sun from the sea and subsequentlydropped into the mountains where the Arno has its source. The natural cycle ofrenewal that typifies the river is not replicated by the inhabitants along it;these go from bad to worse as the river descends. (Compare the descent of therivers that eventually make up the Po, falling from Lake Garda to the AdriaticSea in Inf. XX.61–81.)Pelorus, the promontory at the northeast end of Sicily, was believed to havebeen cut off by the sea (the Strait of Messina) from the southwest end of theApennine range.

[part0011.html#c14-s13-e] The word for “snake,” biscia, deployed athird and final time (see also Purg. VIII.98 for its use to indicate the serpentin the garden) in the poem, recalls Inferno IX.77: the angelic messengercompared to a snake from which frogs flee.The cause for the immoderate behavior of the valley’s inhabitants, expressed asuncertain (“whether some curse / is on the place or evil habits goad them on”),is eventually explicitly identified as the result of the misapplied freedom ofthe will (i.e., the second cause alluded to here) by Marco Lombardo (Purg.XVI.67–83), as was pointed out, uniquely among the early commentators, byBenvenuto da Imola. All of the Arno-dwellers seem to have been turned to brutesby the sorceress Circe, most particularly those described in the next tercet.[return to English [part0011.html#c14-s13-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c14-s13-i]]43–45.

Non-Tuscanreaders may be surprised at commentators’ certainty about the identities of allthe unnamed towns or cities referred to in this part of the diatribe, but Dantecounts on a reader familiar with the major points of habitation along the river.[return to English [part0011.html#c14-s15-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c14-s15-i]]46–48.

[part0011.html#c14-s18-e] If Florence is associated with avarice, Pisais presented as being full of fraud. Foxes are referred to in two other passagesin the poem (Inf. XXVII.75: Guido da Montefeltro refers to his former “vulpine”strategies; Purg. XXXII.119: a fox, generally understood as heresy, invades thecart of the chariot of the Church).Pietro di Dante (1340) and Daniello (1568) both think of a passage in Boethiusas Dante’s source for the animals in Guido’s outburst. See De consolationephilosophiae IV.iii (pr).57–60: “You will say that the man who is driven byavarice to seize what belongs to others is like a wolf; the restless, angry manwho spends his life in quarrels you will compare to a dog. The treacherousconspirator who steals by fraud may be likened to a fox;…the man who is sunk infoul lust is trapped in the pleasures of a filthy sow” (trans. Richard Green).(The accompanying poem in Boethius begins with Circe, who turned the companionsof Ulysses into animals by means of her poisoned potions.)

[part0011.html#c14-s19-e] This passage offers the occasion for adispute among the commentators: does altri refer to Rinieri or to Dante?(According to most early commentators, the former; to most later ones, thelatter.) The major problem with the older hypothesis is that one has a hard timeseeing what good it can do Rinieri to hear this news (and Guido’s locutionpoints to a potential benefit to his auditor), since he cannot intervene inworldly events, while Guido’s unseen mortal interlocutor still has a life tolive back on the earth—indeed in Tuscany—and may profit from this propheticwarning.

[part0011.html#c14-s20-e] Guido’s prophecy concerns the grandson ofRinieri, Fulcieri da Calboli, “member of the illustrious Guelf family of thatname at Forlì; he was Podestà of Florence in 1302/3, after the return of theNeri [the Black Guelphs] through the influence of Charles of Valois, and provedhimself a bitter foe of the Bianchi” (T). His enmity was shown not only to WhiteGuelphs but to Ghibellines, as he had leaders of both these parties arrested andtortured and killed.Fulcieri bargained with his employers (the Black Guelphs) over the fates of hisprisoners, thus currying the favor of the Black leaders while shoring up hisposition as podestà; he eventually handed many of the captives over to be put todeath by their enemies, selling them like cattle.The metaphoric reference to Florence as a trista selva (wretched wood) in verse64 may draw our attention back to the second verse of the poem, in which theprotagonist discovers himself in a selva oscura (dark wood). The language ofthis tercet also identifies the better days of Florence as Edenic and suggeststhat the good old days are now gone for a very long time.

[part0011.html#c14-s27-e] “Guido del Duca, gentleman of Bertinoro, nearForlì, in Romagna, son of Giovanni del Duca of the Onesti family of Ravenna. Theearliest mention of Guido occurs in a document dated May 4, 1199, in which he isdescribed as holding the office of judge to the Podestà of Rimini. In 1202, andagain in 1204, he is mentioned as playing an important part in the affairs ofRomagna, both times in connexion with Pier Traversaro (Purg. XIV.98), whoseadherent he appears to have been. In 1218, Pier Traversaro, with the help of hisGhibelline friends, and especially of the Mainardi of Bertinoro, made himselfmaster of Ravenna, and expelled the Guelfs from the city. The latter, inrevenge, seized Bertinoro, destroyed the houses belonging to the Mainardi, anddrove out all Piero’s adherents; among them was Guido del Duca, who at this timeapparently, together with his family, betook himself to Ravenna, his father’snative place, and resided there under the protection of Pier Traversaro.

[part0011.html#c14-s28-e] Guido’s wry self-knowledge, similar to thatof Sapia (Purg. XIII.110–111), practically defines the sin of envy as Danteunderstood it. Pietro di Dante (1340) cites Horace (Epistles I.ii.57): “Theenvious man grows lean when his neighbor prospers.” The citation is apt, even ifDante’s knowledge of the Epistles is not assured. A more certain source is foundin Aquinas, as is variously noted, first by Poletto (1894): tristitia de alienisbonis (sadness at another’s possessions). But see Jacopo della Lana (1324), whoattributes the phrase to John of Damascus (eighth century): “tristitia de bonisalienis.”For the gray-blue color of envy see the note to Purgatorio XIII.8–9.

[part0011.html#c14-s29-e] The phrasing (sowing and reaping) is obviouslybiblical, as Lombardi (1791) was perhaps the first to note, citing St. Paul(Galatians 6:8): “Quae enim seminaverit homo, haec et metet” (For what a mansows, that shall he reap). Tommaseo (1837) cites another five biblical passagesthat also rely on this metaphor, but the passage in Paul is favored by thecommentators once it enters the tradition.

[part0011.html#c14-s29-e] Guido’s denunciation, in the form of anapostrophe of the human race, places the blame for our envious lot in our notbeing able to seek goods that are shared.

In1276 he made war upon Forlì, but was compelled to retire to his stronghold ofCalboli, in the upper valley of the Montone, where he was besieged by Guido daMontefeltro (Inf.

Lizio isa character in one of the novelle (V.iv) of the Decameron. Arrigo Mainardi, aGhibelline from Bertinoro, associated with Guido del Duca, was still living in1228.

While no commentator seems to know enough about him to present hispolitical party, the fact that he seems to have been involved in the defense ofFaenza against the emperor (Frederick II) in 1240 would ordinarily suggest thathe was a Guelph; on the other hand he apparently was in the emperor’s favor in1248 and 1249 when he was made podestà of Pisa and then of Siena—positions thatwould suggest his alignment with the Ghibellines. However, Isidoro Del Lungo(1926), the only commentator to deal with the issue, simply states that he was aGuelph. [return to English [part0011.html#c14-s34-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c14-s34-i]]104.

He was theson of Azzo degli Ubaldini and thus related to both the cardinal Ottaviano degliUbaldini (Inf. X.120) and the archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini (Inf.XXXIII.14).

Benvenuto says he was a rich nobleman of Rimini and that he had heardtell that Federigo had a great shock of yellow hair, so that his sobriquet,Tignoso, which is the adjective from the noun tigna (or “mange”), was a playfulmisnomer. Federigo’s companions were, apparently, those who took part in hishospitable way of life. Those who attempt to date his life set it in the firsthalf of the thirteenth century.

Of the Traversari of Ravenna we have heardtell in the person of Piero (see note to verse 98); now we hear of another greatGhibelline family of that city, the Anastagi. When we consider that the lastyears of Dante’s life were spent at Ravenna as a result of the hospitality ofGuido Novello da Polenta it is striking that the Polentani, perhaps the greatestof all the families of Ravenna (along with the Traversari), are not mentionedhere. Writing after 1317, Dante would surely have included them, since theirGuelph allegiance would apparently have been no bar to being included in thecast assembled here, containing roughly as many Guelphs as Ghibellines.Both these families have by 1300 nearly died out—a fate that is not theunmitigated disaster it might seem, as we shall soon see.

They were Ghibelline lords of Faenza. Rather thanpraise their good early stock, Dante fixes on their “Devil,” Maghinardo Paganoda Susinana, a truly impressive warrior and statesman. A Ghibelline, he alsofavored the Florentine Guelphs because of their decent treatment of him when hewas a child and in their protection. On one side of the Apennines he fought onthe side of Guelphs; on the other, of Ghibellines. What undoubtedly took anypossibility of a dispassionate view of this extraordinary man from Dante was thefact that he entered the city in November 1301 at the side of Charles of Valois,the French conqueror of Florence (in collaboration with Corso Donati).Maghinardo is the only name mentioned in this passage of a person alive at theimagined date of the vision (he died in 1302). Everyone else is ofthirteenth-century provenance, and of the persons and events datable in thiswelter of historical material, nothing before 1200 or after 1293 is alluded to,thus reinforcing the notion that Dante is talking, through the mouth of Guidodel Duca, of the “good old days” in Romagna. A similar and longer discourse inhistorical romanticism will be put forth by Cacciaguida in Paradiso XVI, anentire canto given over to the moral supremacy of a Florence that is now longgone.

A Guelph from Cerfugnano, near Faenza, he wasseveral times podestà of Faenza. Dead in 1278, he was survived by his two sons,both of whom died well before 1300, so that this Ugolino’s name may be preservedfrom being sullied by any additional Fantolinian progeny.

And see note toInferno XXXIII.9.His final words of lament, after the extraordinary vivacity and range of hisstyles (noble, earthy, ironic, cynical, but always sharply honed), are the lastword on Romagna, which was once so fair and now is foul, a transformation thatleaves only grief in its wake.

XIII.25–27) return, again moving against thedirection of their movement, but now presenting negative exemplars. Cain’s wordsare translated from the Vulgate (Genesis 4:14): “Everyone who finds me shallslay me,” spoken before God marked his forehead after the murder of his brother,Abel, so that he would not, indeed, be slain. For Cain’s association with Envy,according to some fathers of the Church, see Cassell (Cass.1984.2), p. 17.[return to English [part0011.html#c14-s45-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c14-s45-i]]139. [part0011.html#c14-s47-e] See Ovid, Metamorphoses II.797–819, whereMercury turns Aglauros to stone because she wants him for herself and stationsherself outside her sister Herse’s door in order to prevent his entry to Herse’sbedchamber. Mercury then opens the door with a touch of his caduceus. That scenehas already been (tacitly) present in Inferno IX.89–90, where the Mercury-likeangel opens the gates of Dis to Virgil and Dante. See the note to that passage.Cain and Aglauros share the condition of envy of a sibling, Cain of Abel,Aglauros of Herse. The second exemplar of Charity, Pylades, was in a brotherlyrelationship with Orestes, even though they were not related by blood (Purg.XIII.32).

[part0011.html#c14-s47-e] It is noteworthy that the voices presentingthe exemplars of Charity are courteous and inviting (Purg. XIII.25–27), whilethese, presenting exemplars of Envy, are like lightning and thunder and causethe protagonist to be fearful.

[part0011.html#c14-s49-e] God’s “lure” (richiamo), a technical termfrom falconry, is part of this magnificent final image, which turns our humanexpectations upside down. God is seen as a falconer in the Empyrean spinning hislures, the stars that end each cantica, over his head, as it were, while we arefalcons that are not drawn to this amazing bait, but look down to the earth forour temptations. Compare that other disobedient falcon, the monster Geryon, atInferno XVII.127–132. The language of this passage is Boethian. See Deconsolatione philosophiae III.m8: “[Humans] dig the earth in search of the good,which soars above the star-filled heavens” (trans. R. Green).

Benvenuto, commenting on its six verses, remarks that all Dantemeans to say is that it is the hour of Vespers, and that he does so by means ofcircumlocution (“per unam circuitionem verborum”). However, Arnaldo Bonaventura(Bona.1902.1), pp. 9–10, chides Venturi (1732) for labeling the construction a“miserabile similitudine” (perfectly dreadful simile) and remarks that suchlighthearted moments are also to be found in the Psalms of David and in theepics of Homer and of Virgil. Cachey (Cach.1993.1), pp. 212–14, following, as hesays, Longfellow, and who speaks of Dante’s poetry as being playful, has learnedto enjoy the poetic playfulness of vv. 1–40, so long softly ridiculed and evencharacterized as a result of the poet’s letting us see his worst (pedantic)side. Longfellow, bringing a fellow poet’s perspective to the passage, hadrealized that Dante is not a stuffed owl and perceived that his fellow poet ishaving a little fun with himself and with us: “Dante states this simple factwith curious circumlocution, as if he would imitate the celestial sphere in thisscherzoso movement. The beginning of the day is sunrise; consequently the end ofthe third hour, three hours after sunrise, is represented by an arc of thecelestial sphere measuring forty-five degrees. The sun had still an equal spaceto pass over before his setting. This would make it afternoon in Purgatory, andmidnight in Tuscany, where Dante was writing the poem.” For a similartime-telling passage see Purgatorio III.25–26 and note. Here, however, Danteunderlines his ludic propensity in his first rhyme: terza-scherza, as though toimply that this very tercet is itself playful.It is to Cachey’s credit that he builds his treatment of the entire canto on hissense of this initial burst of “childish” enthusiasm. Exuberance is the strandthat ties together many elements of the canto, from its beginning to its end,juxtaposing youthful, innocent play against older “high seriousness.” Themorning sun is not currently shining on the mount of purgatory but is summonedin order to begin the canto, and is then followed by a series of benignpresences: Dante (both as poet and as protagonist); the Angel of Mercy; Virgil’srepresentation of the loving souls in paradise, including Beatrice; thetwelve-year-old Jesus and his mildly chastising mother; the youth who kissed thedaughter of Pisistratus and this nonjudgmental father; the youthful martyrStephen; the “drunken” protagonist. The exuberant love of God and ecstaticawareness of His presence eventually fills the canto. [return to English[part0011.html#c15-s1-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s1-i]]7–12. [part0011.html#c15-s3-e] The travelers, proceeding to their right asthey climbed the mountain, have now moved some 90 degrees along the circle ofwhich it is the center. The sun, at 3 PM, is thus to the northwest as it headswest ahead of them. Where it was behind them before (Purg. III.16–18), it nowstands directly before them, brighter than it has been, to Dante’s sight, at anypoint yet in the poem. This excess of light will carry forward into thebrightness of the ecstatic light that is soon to flood the inner eye of theprotagonist.

[part0011.html#c15-s5-e] Poletto (1894) calls attention to the passagein Convivio (III.ix.10) in which Dante says that Aristotle had confuted Plato’snotion that our eyesight went out from us to take cognizance of external things,arguing (correctly, adds Dante) that things that we perceive through the eyes(lo visibile—the noun that Dante uses here) strike upon our senses, not thesenses on them. See Inferno X.69. [return to English [part0011.html#c15-s5-e] /Italian [part0018.html#c15-s5-i]]16–24. [part0011.html#c15-s6-e] This simile introduces a “second sun” toDante’s dazzled glance, now the reflected radiance of the angel, as seems clearfrom the context and despite some early commentators who believe this is thedirect beam of the light of God or of the sun itself. It seems to be neither,nor indeed the direct beam of brightness from the angel of this second terrace.As the elaborate simile and the sequential description of the light make plainenough, the light bounces down, and then up, under Dante’s protective hand, sothat the angle of incidence is the same as the angle of reflection (\\|/),notions established, for Dante, by such authorities as Euclid and AlbertusMagnus. For Dante’s knowledge of the phenomenon see Convivio II.iii.vi (where herefers to the science of perspective, or optics) and Paradiso I.49–50. [returnto English [part0011.html#c15-s6-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s6-i]]28–33. [part0011.html#c15-s10-e] Virgil’s promise that eventually Dante’seyes, as his soul becomes more fit for the task, will be able to look uponangelic radiance without turning away is fulfilled at least in Purgatorio XXX.10and XXX.18, where this word for “angel,” messo (or messaggiero)—“messenger,” isnext (and for the last time) employed (it was introduced to the poem in Inf.IX.85). [return to English [part0011.html#c15-s10-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c15-s10-i]]36. [part0011.html#c15-s12-e] The “stairway” to the third terrace will be lesssteep than those to Pride and Envy. The slowly disappearing P’s on Dante’s brow,the increasing lightness of his being, the increasing ease of the ascent, allthese elements underline the general improvement of the penitent’s moralcondition, comparable to that of a patient who has survived a crisis and nowgrows rapidly stronger. [return to English [part0011.html#c15-s12-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c15-s12-i]]38–39. [part0011.html#c15-s13-e] A portion of the fifth Beatitude in Matthew(5:7), “Blessèd are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy,” is hereaccompanied by an Italian phrase. In one later moment (on the terrace ofGluttony, Purg. XXIV.151–154) Dante will set the angel’s recasting of one of theBeatitudes in Italian. Here he offers biblical Latin conjoined with a subsequentItalian expression. Various issues have puzzled various commentators of thissomewhat surprising conjunction. (1) What biblical text do these wordsparaphrase? (2) Who speaks, the angel or the penitents that Dante leaves behind?(3) Are the words directed to Dante or are they some sort of general expression?(4) Why does the speaker (whoever it is who speaks) resort to Italian?(1) Most commentators after Daniello (1568) are drawn to the subsequent text inthis chapter in Matthew’s gospel (5:12), Jesus’s conclusion of his sermon, inwhich he tells those who are true to Him to “rejoice (gaudete) and be exceedingglad, for great is your reward in heaven.”In order to answer the last three questions, it is probably necessary toconsider the entire program of the angelic utterances to Dante during hispenitential ascent of the mountain. These moments occur as follows: PurgatorioXII.110–111; XV.38–39; XVII.68–69; XIX.49–50; XXII.5–6; XXIV.151–154; XXVII.8–9.In all the last five of these the text clearly and specifically attributes thewords to the angel. Only the first and second are, when we first read them,opaque. Nonetheless, it is at the very least probable that the angel speaks onthese first two occasions as well. We should also take note of the facts that onthe sixth terrace the angel paraphrases a Beatitude in Italian rather thanreciting a phrase from it in Latin (Purg. XXIV.151–154) and that, on theseventh, his practice is exactly as we find it here: Latin for the citation ofthe Beatitude, Italian for his concluding advice to Dante (Purg. XXVII.8–9;10–12). And there is one further common element in the second and seventhscenes: in all the others there is specific reference to the angel’s wing orfeathers erasing a “P” from Dante’s forehead; in these two scenes there is nosuch description, thus leading us to speculate that the angel’s Italianutterance is probably meant to coincide with the erasure. It seems likely thathere the angel speaks, addressing Dante in Italian. [return to English[part0011.html#c15-s13-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s13-i]]40–45. [part0011.html#c15-s14-e] The protagonist, now freed, as we perhaps aremeant to understand, from the P of Envy, is rapidly improving. It is he, and notVirgil, who insists on using the traveling time for self-improvement; he wouldlike, in a sort of postlude to the terrace of Envy, to understand the remark ofGuido del Duca (Purg. XIV.86–87): “O race of men, why do you set your hearts onthings that of necessity cannot be shared?” The moral consequence of suchaffection is to envy the possessor of what one longs for but cannot have; weremember that Satan, barely created (see Par. XXIX.55–57), immediately wasprideful against his Maker (because of his envy of His power). [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c15-s14-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s14-i]]46–57. [part0011.html#c15-s16-e] Virgil’s gloss on Guido’s words in the lastcanto distinguishes earthly desires for individual possessions from heavenlyenjoyment of the common good. Commentators, beginning with Pietro di Dante(1340), cite the following passage from Augustine’s City of God (XV.v): “nullo[enim modo] fit minor, accedente seu permanente consorte, possessio bonitatis,quam tanto latius quanto concordius individua sociorum possidet charitas”([goodness] is in no way lessened when it is shared, whether fleetingly orpermanently, but grows the more the love of it spreads in others—Latin quotedfrom the version found in Pietro’s commentary).

[part0011.html#c15-s20-e] If Dante’s will to learn is good, hiscapacities still flag, held back by his earthly view of riches and of the verynature of possession, which he can only conceive as selfish. In Convivio(III.xv.10), Dante had understood very well what his fictive self here stilldoes not comprehend: “li santi non hanno tra loro invidia” (the saints have noenvious feelings about one another). Scartazzini (1900) was perhaps the firstcommentator to produce this citation in this context. [return to English[part0011.html#c15-s20-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s20-i]]67–75. [part0011.html#c15-s23-e] Virgil’s final resolution of Dante’s probleminsists on the centrality of love as antidote to envy. Indeed, words for love(amore, carità, amare, ama) occur four times within seven lines. Barolini(Baro.1992.1), note 39, p. 330, also notes the insistence on più (more) in vv.55–62 (an astounding eight occurrences in eight lines, the densest presence of asingle word in any passage of the poem, one might add) and here (vv. 73–74),perhaps underlining the need for the incremental conceptual refinement necessaryfor the redefinition of human affection toward a better end.

[part0011.html#c15-s24-e] The word ardore is, for Wlassics (Wlas.1989.1),p. 166, the key word of this canto, uniting the notions of flame and ofaffection in its main significations.

In her first nominal appearance (after Inf. II.70 and II.103,where she is first named by Virgil and then herself), she first seems to beassociated with hope (VI.32; 35); in her third, with faith (XVIII.48). Is shehere associated with charity? If she is, what is the consequence for thetraditional identification of Beatrice as “Revelation” or “Theology” (and ofVirgil as “Reason”)? (Beatrice is named sixty-three times in all in the poem;Virgil, 31.) See note to Purgatorio XVIII.46–48. [return to English[part0011.html#c15-s26-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s26-i]]79–81. [part0011.html#c15-s27-e] The clear reference here to the erasure ofthe second P earlier on calls attention to the problem that Dante has set forus, to determine exactly when this happened. See note to vv. 38–39. [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c15-s27-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s27-i]]82–84. [part0011.html#c15-s28-e] Dante’s failure to respond to Virgil hereperhaps prepares us for his more dramatic inability to communicate with hisguide at the sudden appearance of Beatrice (Purg. XXX.43–51). It also has theeffect of underlining the totally present and commanding nature of what heexperiences in his raptus: there is nothing else that can hold his attention.We now probably expect, on the basis of the experience we have had of the firsttwo terraces, a description of the terrace upon which the travelers have justset foot (Purg. X.20–33, XIII.1–9). Its suppression here is obviously deliberate(we will find it, postponed as it is, only at the end of the canto at vv.139–145 and then continuing into the next canto). In this way the poetunderlines the heightened importance of the visionary experience granted to theprotagonist on this terrace. [return to English [part0011.html#c15-s28-e] /Italian [part0018.html#c15-s28-i]]85–114. [part0011.html#c15-s29-e] The three visions that follow are set offfrom the narrative by a precise vocabulary of vision, one that Dante hadestablished as early as in his Vita nuova (see Hollander [Holl.1974.1], pp.3–7). This begins at once with the verse “Ivi mi parve in una visione …” (Thereit seemed to me … in a … vision…). The next line adds two crucial terms, theadjective estatica (ecstatic) and the verb esser tratto (to be drawn up). Thesetechnical terms, the first of which occurs only once in the poem’s universe,establish the radical difference between this visionary experience and thatobtained in conventional dreams, for here what is at stake is the sort of sightthat was given to such as Paul and John in the New Testament (and, as we shallsee in a few lines, to St. Stephen as well).In Dante the verb parere can have two quite different meanings: “seem” (thusexpressing a potentially limited or even nonexistent truthfulness) or “appeared”(to indicate something perceived that is actually present). The verbs parere andapparire are used throughout this passage (vv. 85, 93, 94, 102) to indicatepresences that are experienced as being in fact present to the beholder in hisecstatic seeing; this is true as well of the verb vedere (vv. 87, 106, 109),used each time to indicate what has truly been made manifest to the beholder.[return to English [part0011.html#c15-s29-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c15-s29-i]]85–86. [part0011.html#c15-s29-e] Pietro di Dante (1340) offers the followingbit of medieval etymologizing for the word “ecstasy” (extasis): “ab ex, quod estextra, et stasis, quod est status, quasi extra suum statum” (from ex, that is,outside, and stasis, that is, state: as though outside oneself). The wordvisïone modified by estatica denotes a very special kind of seeing, one that thepoem will return to only with its final vision in the Empyrean. Thus the mode ofpresentation of the exemplars of meekness is, within the fiction, a preparationof the protagonist for his eventual opportunity to see God “face to face.”Outside the fiction, it is a test of the reader’s capacity to understand thenature of Dantean poetics, reliant upon claims that are, to say the very least,unusual for a poet to make for his poem, one that will finally offer usprecisely una visïone estatica. Here the text offers us a foretaste of thatfinal visionary moment. [return to English [part0011.html#c15-s29-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c15-s29-i]]87–93. [part0011.html#c15-s29-e] The first exemplar is, as we have learned toexpect, Mary. The narrative that clearly lies behind Dante’s condensation of itis found in Luke’s gospel (Luke 2:40–48). Mary, Joseph, and the twelve-year-oldJesus travel to Jerusalem at Passover and then the parents leave the city. In aremarkable moment, reflected in contemporary accounts of children left behind incars or on school buses, they assume the boy is among their traveling companionsand finally, discovering that he is not, return to Jerusalem to seek him out.Three days later they find him in the temple, explaining a thing or two to therabbis.Jesus as young genius is so palpably present that we need to remind ourselvesthat he is not the exemplary figure here; that is, indeed, his mother, whoscolds him as gently as a scold may scold—as any former child will testify,remembering similar encounters with sterner mothers. [return to English[part0011.html#c15-s29-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s29-i]]94–105. [part0011.html#c15-s32-e] The second exemplar, once again a parent, isthe sixth-century B.C. Athenian tyrant Pisistratus, known to Dante in thisparticular, according to many commentators (perhaps beginning with Pietro diDante [1340]), from Valerius Maximus, author of that first-century compendium ofclassical history and lore, Facta et dicta memorabilia, who tells the talealmost precisely as Dante retells it here.Like the first of these three examplary scenes, this one also begins with theportrait of a mother. Where the parents of Jesus are united in benevolence,those of the daughter of Pisistratus are divided; this mother, reminiscent ofthe haughty Michal (see Purg. X.65 and note), leaves the performance of a lovingforgiveness to her husband. [return to English [part0011.html#c15-s32-e] /Italian [part0018.html#c15-s32-i]]97–99. [part0011.html#c15-s33-e] The wife of Pisistratus refers to the myth ofthe naming of Athens which Pietro di Dante (1340) says derives from Augustine’sretelling of the myth, found earlier in Varro, in De civitate Dei XVIII.9.During the kingship of Cecrops, when Athena (Minerva) and Poseidon (Neptune)both wanted to name the city, the other gods chose Athena because her gift wasthe olive tree, seen as more useful to humans than Poseidon’s gift of a spring.Pietro also refers to the version of the tale found in Ovid (Metam. VI.70–102).[return to English [part0011.html#c15-s33-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c15-s33-i]]106–114. [part0011.html#c15-s36-e] The artistry of Dante’s treatment of thethird and final exemplar, St. Stephen, the first martyr (Acts 7:54–59), isgreatly admired. Among the three narratives exemplifying meekness, this is theonly one in which that meekness is found in the youthful protagonist of theexemplary tale rather than in a parent. Arnaldo Bonaventura (Bona.1902.1), p.29, sees that the progression of figures that benefit from the forgiveness whichruns counter to wrath has a purposeful order: from a beloved son, to a relativestranger, to one’s enemies. Anyone would forgive the twelve-year-old Jesus his“night out” in the temple; anyone, upon reflection, should perhaps forgive theyouthful flamboyance of the amorous pursuer of a king’s daughter; hardly anyonewould choose to forgive his murderers. [return to English[part0011.html#c15-s36-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s36-i]]107. [part0011.html#c15-s36-e] The youthfulness of Dante’s portrayal ofStephen (as giovinetto) has caused controversy, beginning with Scartazzini’s(1900) objection that here Dante had fallen into a small error, since the Bookof Acts portrayed Stephen as a mature man (homo, vir: e.g., Acts 6:5, 6:13). InScartazzini’s view, in a lapse of memory Dante had conflated the descriptions ofStephen and St. Paul, present as the youthful (adulescentis) Saul as a witnessto the martyrdom (Acts 7:57). To this argument Poletto (1894) objects,demonstrating that in Dante adolescence lasted until one is 25, while youthincluded the period between 25 and 45 (Conv. IV.xxiv.1–3), and also pointing outthat Scipio and Pompey (Par. VI.52) are described as “youths” (giovanetti), 33and 25 years old, respectively, at the time of those great victories to whichDante refers. Sarolli, “Stefano” (ED V [1976]), is also in this camp. [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c15-s36-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s36-i]]108. [part0011.html#c15-s36-e] In Acts the words of the maddened crowdsupplied here by Dante are not given. Wlassics (Wlas.1989.1), p. 170, arguesthat Stephen’s persecutors shout to themselves, not to one another, as almostall commentators (and translators) insist. Before him Casini/Barbi (1921) doallow for this possibility, but only Mattalia (1960) had previously chosen thisoption. This interpretation is supported by at least one pressing consideration:in the source text (Acts 7:56) the stoners of Stephen are specifically describedas, having stopped up their ears, crying out with a loud voice and rushing upontheir victim. They are shouting rather to screw up their courage than to exhortone another—they are shouting as do those who charge in battle, wrestling withtheir fear. Our translation preserves this understanding of the verse. [returnto English [part0011.html#c15-s36-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s36-i]]111. [part0011.html#c15-s37-e] What is seen by “the eyes that are open toHeaven” is described in the source text in Stephen’s own words (it is notablethat Dante suppresses the words spoken by the protomartyr and adds those spokenby his persecutors). Here is what he says he sees (Acts 7:56): “Behold, I seethe heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.” It isprecisely these words, reporting his vision, that cause his murderers to stop uptheir ears and attack him in their offended rage. In this moment in the poem, wemay reflect, Dante’s eyes (referred to, just before the visions begin, as lucivaghe [eager eyes] at verse 84) are as open to Stephen’s martyrdom as Stephen’sare to his heavenly vision. [return to English [part0011.html#c15-s37-e] /Italian [part0018.html#c15-s37-i]]112–114. [part0011.html#c15-s38-e] The final action of these exemplaryprotagonists of mercy is obviously the most dramatic in the program: Stephenforgiving his murderers even as they murder him. His “look” would “unlockcompassion” in anyone who beheld it—perhaps even his persecutors, but surely inany decent Christian soul witnessing his martyrdom, including, just now, theprotagonist. [return to English [part0011.html#c15-s38-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c15-s38-i]]115–138. [part0011.html#c15-s39-e] On each terrace there is poetic spacereserved for some sort of reaction on the part of the poet or protagonist (and,at times, his guide) to the experience of exemplarity. Of the thirteen otherpassages devoted to these transitional moments none is even nearly as lengthy asthis one, twenty-four verses; in fact only once is such a passage as long asthree tercets, while this one extends over eight. It is clear that the poetwanted to direct our attention to the importance of this exchange between guideand protagonist.Virgil’s reactions give rise to a number of questions. Does or does not Virgilsee the visions vouchsafed Dante? Is his response (vv. 120–123) evidence that hedoes not understand the nature of Dante’s experience (as Dante seems to believeat vv. 125–126)? If a reader believes that to be the case, how does that readerrespond to Virgil’s insistence that he indeed knows Dante’s innermost thoughts(vv. 127–138)?The structure of the fifteenth canto is formed by three moments of Virgilianinterpretation of phenomena:10–39 [part0011.html#c15-s4-e]: Dante cannot behold the angel: Virgil explainsthe nature of the problem;40–81 [part0011.html#c15-s14-e]: Dante did not understand Guido del Duca’swords in the last canto: Virgil gives the necessary commentary, acknowledgingBeatrice’s higher authority;115–138 [part0011.html#c15-s39-e]: Dante has a series of ecstatic visions:Virgil insists on explaining that he knows very well what they involved and saysthat he only calls attention to Dante’s condition in order to spur him on.In the first two scenes Virgil is clearly correct and thoroughly in control ofthe situation; in this last sequence he does not exactly issue triumphant.[return to English [part0011.html#c15-s39-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c15-s39-i]]115–117. [part0011.html#c15-s39-e] The literal sense is not difficult: Dantewas not seeing that which was present before his fleshly eyes; from that pointof view (the merely physical one) he is delusional, is seeing what does notexist, seeing erroneous phantasms instead of what his physical eyes wouldreport. But such “errors” as these are the very heart of truth, or, in anextreme case of litotes (deliberate understatement), are, at the very least,“not false.” See the discussion in Barolini (Baro.1992.1), pp. 151–53. [returnto English [part0011.html#c15-s39-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s39-i]]118–123. [part0011.html#c15-s40-e] Virgil’s first response to Dante’s“awakening” back in the world of lesser truth is a bit brutal in its colloquialinsistence on a less than noble cause for his condition. For Dante’s apparentdrunkenness see Glending Olson (Olso.1999.1), pp. 25–26. Olson addresses therelationship between these and the seemingly “drunken” words of Boniface VIII,as described by Guido da Montefeltro in Inferno XXVII.99. The context of Acts2:13 is clearly present here as well: witnessing the Apostles speaking intongues after the descent of the Holy Spirit upon them, the cynical pronouncethem to be “drunk with new wine.” It is interesting to see that Virgil isassociated, in his response to Dante, similarly filled with the Spirit, withthose who denied the action of the Holy Spirit in the Apostles (see Seem[Seem.1991.1], p. 74). Here, Seem points out that Dante’s “drunken” condition,shortly after he has heard Beatrice’s name (XV.77), mirrors his being “comeinebriato” (as though drunk) when he first saw Beatrice, as recorded in Vitanuova III. [return to English [part0011.html#c15-s40-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c15-s40-i]]124–126. [part0011.html#c15-s42-e] Dante’s response to Virgil intrinsicallyexplains his physical condition as the result of his being in a state whichgranted him the ability to see that which, apparently, Virgil did not and couldnot see. If Virgil did not know this before he asked his question, he does knowthis much now—not what Dante saw, but the nature of his seeing: ecstatic vision.Dante here shares the iconography of another closed-eyed visionary, John theDivine; see Purgatorio XXIX.143–144, where John, represented as the last book ofthe New Testament, Revelation, is seen, like Dante here, walking in a visionarystate with his eyes closed, “dormendo.” [return to English[part0011.html#c15-s42-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s42-i]]127–129. [part0011.html#c15-s43-e] Virgil’s claim for knowledge of even theleast particular of Dante’s mental awareness must be taken with skepticism (seediscussion of Musa’s arguments in the note to vv. 134–135). [return to English[part0011.html#c15-s43-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c15-s43-i]]130–132. [part0011.html#c15-s44-e] What does Virgil know? We have someinformation with which to answer this question. On the terrace of Pride, Virgiland Dante found the two sets of opposing exemplars displayed in marble carvings.Having seen the first set of these, once they had seen the second they couldinfer something about the structure of purgation and about its symboliclandscape. As a result, once Virgil hears the voices flying overhead,representing Charity, the virtue contrasted with Envy, he immediatelyunderstands that there will be a second set of sounds before the travelers leavethe terrace (see note to Purg. XIII.37–42). His situation here is moredifficult, for he has seen nothing to indicate this terrace’s mode of exemplaryinstruction. According to him, he reads Dante’s mind. Perhaps we should view hisclaim with a certain dubiety. Dante speaks, announcing that he is seeing thingsthat are not visible; as soon as Virgil connects that information with thephysical signs that his “drunken” charge is exhibiting, he understands: theexempla on this terrace are delivered through ecstatic vision, an experiencereserved for only the elect. He knows that these visions must present positivefigures of the opposing virtue, precisely “to open your heart to the waters ofpeace,” as he tells Dante. No matter who may have been present in Dante’svisions to represent meekness (and even Virgil may have by now divined that Marywill be the first of these), the meaning of the exemplars here will always bethe same: to pour the water of peace upon the fires of wrath in the heart.[return to English [part0011.html#c15-s44-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c15-s44-i]]133–135. [part0011.html#c15-s45-e] Bosco/Reggio (1979) are undoubtedly correctin suggesting that the debate in the commentaries over the literal sense ofthese verses is less than convincing and go on to plead that in these versesDante uses “an imprecise expression.” Salsano (Sals.1967.1), pp. 568–70,reflects upon the debate as it came into his time. Cachey (Cach.1993.1), pp.222–23, offers a more up-to-date review of various interpretations. The onlyinterpretation, however, that seems to offer a clear understanding of thedifficult passage is one based on a comprehension of the tensions that existhere between the protagonist and his guide. Such a reading has been put forwardby Lauren Seem (Seem.1991.1), who argues that what is at stake is Virgil’sattempt to show that he has indeed known the nature of Dante’s vision, that hedid not think Dante was merely “drunk.” And thus we can understand what he saysas follows: “I did not ask what was wrong with you because you were having avision—of course, I understood that—but only because it was now time to get youback on the track.” As Musa has pointed out (see notes to Inf. XVI.115 andXXIII.25), there is no evidence in the poem, despite Virgil’s claim in InfernoXXIII (repeated here), that he actually can read the protagonist’s mind—acapacity reserved for Beatrice and the other saved souls who interview Dante inthe heavens. Our reading of the entire passage eventually depends on whether weaccept Virgil’s protestations here or question them. For a step-by-step analysisof the difficult details that have so afflicted the commentators, see Seem(Seem.1991.1), pp. 75–80.

[part0011.html#c15-s47-e] The description of this terrace, postponedfrom its expected space (see note to vv. 82–84), begins now, as we firstperceive the black smoke of anger that will cover the travelers and thepenitents for the entirety of the following canto, the darkest part ofPurgatorio.

[part0012.html#c16-s1-e] This fiftieth canto of the Divina Commedia isliterally its darkest; light finally glimmers only two lines from its conclusion(in verse 143) and its action is played completely in the smoke of Wrath.Technically, the numerical midpoint of the poem occurs between Cantos XVI andXVII, the latter of which also happens to be the middle canto of Purgatorio.Thus, as the poet prepares the entire poem and the cantica to reach theircenters, it seems fitting that he first indicates the Comedy’s origin in hell:Buio d’inferno (Gloom of hell).The sky is “barren” (literally “poor,” or “impoverished”) in that it is“deprived of its precious jewels,” its stars (according to Benvenuto da Imola,mainly found in the eighth sphere but with one “planet” found in each of thefirst seven), are hidden behind layers of clouds.The envious are made to repent by being denied their sight; the wrathful arebeing denied objects of sight because they were blinded by their anger for theirenemies.

[part0012.html#c16-s3-e] It seems that here Virgil has the power ofsight, while the protagonist, like the penitents soon to be present, iseffectively blind in the smoke. Is this a deliberate recasting of the situationin Purgatorio XV.115–138, where Dante can behold the ecstatic visions apparentlydenied to Virgil? Once again, Virgil’s state would be marked off as differentfrom that of saved souls.The smoke that expresses the sin of Wrath on this terrace is referred to fivetimes (XV.142; XVI.5, 25, 35, 142) and marks the last time in the poem that thenoun fummo is used to describe a place. It clearly seems to be related to thesmoke that marked the Circle of Anger in Inferno, where it is used three times,once (Inf. IX.75) with an adjective, acerbo (harsh), that seems to join it tothe smoke we enter here. For the relationship between infernal anger and thepurgation of Wrath see the note to Purgatorio XVII.19–39.

[part0012.html#c16-s4-e] The simile presents an image of Dante walkingbehind Virgil with his hand upon the shoulder of his guide, otherwise present tohim only as a voice. The image prepares us for what will happen once MarcoLombardo is his interlocutor: all he (and we) will be aware of is a voice, closeto an ideal situation for a poet to contrive in order to gain undeflectedattention on behalf of a presentation of moral philosophy.

[part0012.html#c16-s7-e] We are presumably meant to understand that allthe penitents pray on each of the previous terraces (see Purg. XI.1–24; Purg.XIII.49–51) and on this one as well. The pattern of communal liturgical prayerwill be broken, for good reason, only by the slothful: Purgatorio XVIII.103–105.Fallani (1965) discusses the prayer, instituted as part of the Mass by PopeSergius I in the seventh century, comprised, once it became a part of theliturgy, of a single line that is then twice repeated: “Agnus Dei, qui tollispeccata mundi, miserere nobis” (Lamb of God who carry off the sins of the world,have mercy on us); in the third iteration the last phrase (“miserere nobis”)gives place to the words “dona nobis pacem” (grant us peace), a particularly aptphrase for these penitents of Wrath, beseeching the serenity to which Virgilreferred in Purgatorio XV.131, “the waters of peace.” [return to English[part0012.html#c16-s7-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c16-s7-i]]25–27. [part0012.html#c16-s9-e] The speaker can sense that the visitor ismoving the smoke that he walks through and thus must be present in the flesh;for this reason, as he correctly assumes, the new arrival is still timebound.The souls on the mountain have their own temporality, but one in which all oftime is but a necessary prolegomenon to eternity, when real life begins forthem. Thus for them the months of the calendar are real but meaningless. [returnto English [part0012.html#c16-s9-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c16-s9-i]]31–36. [part0012.html#c16-s11-e] Dante’s captatio, his attempt to gain hislistener’s goodwill (see note to Inf. II.58), celebrates the as yet unknownspeaker’s freedom from the flesh; his (rational) soul will soon be as it waswhen God breathed it into him (see Purg. XXV.70–75). The protagonist goes on tooffer, in good rhetorical fashion, a reward for his auditor’s collaboration. Hisinsistence that this spirit follow him is predicated upon necessity: Dante’seyes are closed because his mortal flesh cannot bear the harshness of the smoke,with the result that he cannot see his interlocutor. The spirit, unlike Virgil,evidently cannot see in the darkness and therefore is only able to followDante’s voice.

[part0012.html#c16-s13-e] The image of the flesh as swaddling clothes,the protective cloth in which infants are wrapped, places emphasis on the soulas being the precious part of us, our bodies merely the wrapping that shouldkeep it until it is ready for its better life.

[part0012.html#c16-s14-e] This is the rather coy way that Dante refersto St. Paul’s ascent to Heaven (II Corinthians 12:4) as being the last beforehis own. For Dante, that somewhat strange word (“modern”) is not a positive one.(The Grande Dizionario [Batt.1961.1] indicates this as the first recorded use ofthe word in Italian.) For Dante, in the battle between ancients and moderns, atleast when it is waged on moral grounds, ancients are better. For the threesubsequent uses of the word see Purgatorio XXVI.113, Paradiso XVI.33, ParadisoXXI.131. [return to English [part0012.html#c16-s14-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c16-s14-i]]46. [part0012.html#c16-s16-e] Marco the Lombard: to the many previous attemptsto identify Marco (see Singleton’s commentary) we must now add that of GiorgioCracco (Crac.1984.1), who points out that a Venetian living in Lombardy wrote,ca. 1292, a (still unpublished) chronicle of the provinces of Venice. He nameshimself simply as “Marco” and his text contains a number of concerns and phrasesthat coincide with Dante’s. That Dante allows him as limited identification ashe does may indicate that he felt Marco’s fame was great enough that hisChristian name alone was sufficient to identify him.

[part0012.html#c16-s16-e] Marco’s words make him seem a perfectcourtier: worldly, but a lover of the good, and a user of soldier’s language(that of bowmanship). Poletto (1894) also points out that his qualities wouldseem to mirror those of Ulysses—or at least those that Ulysses lends himself,his “fervor … to gain experience of the world and learn about man’s vices, andhis worth” (Inf. XXVI.97–99). [return to English [part0012.html#c16-s16-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c16-s16-i]]51. [part0012.html#c16-s17-e] Strangely enough, some commentators have takenthe adverbial preposition sù (“above”) to refer to the world at the antipodes(e.g., John of Serravalle [1416]) and one (Tommaseo [1837]), to the earthlyparadise. However, it seems unmistakably clear that Marco, having learned ofDante’s destination (verse 41), is the first spirit to ask him to pray for himonce he is in Heaven. This request might seem to imply either that he is of aparticularly holy disposition or that he believes that no one on earth whomDante might meet loves anything that transcends the earthly (verse 48). But seeGuido Guinizzelli’s similar request (Purg. XXVI.127–130). [return to English[part0012.html#c16-s17-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c16-s17-i]]53–63. [part0012.html#c16-s18-e] Dante is bursting with a doubt, now madedouble by Marco’s words: if the world is so thoroughly evil, wherein lies thecause? Dante wants to be informed so that he may pass the knowledge on toothers, some of whom believe the cause is found on earth, while others think itis situated in the heavens. Is his doubt now “double” because he has heard fromGuido del Duca (XIV.37–42) that all in the valley of the Arno flee virtue? Thatis Benvenuto’s (1380) reasonable hypothesis, one that has many followers.Wanting to know the “cause” of evil (and his word, malizia [malice], is the wordused in Inf. XI.22 to define the sins of the hardened will [see note to Inf.XI.22–27], those punished within the City of Dis), the protagonist triggers theheaviest use of this noun (cagione) in the poem; it occurs four times inforty-four lines, at vv. 61, 67, 83, and 104, thus underlining the centrality ofthis concern, to understand the root of human sinfulness, essential to theunderstanding of the concept of free will, as the next passage (Marco’srejoinder) and the next canto, when Virgil discourses on the nature of love,will both make plain. [return to English [part0012.html#c16-s18-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c16-s18-i]]64–66. [part0012.html#c16-s22-e] Marco’s earlier view of human depravity isobviously now deepened by the knowledge that most humans are not very bright,either, if even this specially selected mortal can ask such a stupid question.[return to English [part0012.html#c16-s22-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c16-s22-i]]67–129. [part0012.html#c16-s23-e] Marco’s speech, the only object of possibleattention in the darkness, twenty-one terzine of moral philosophy, may beparaphrased as follows: If the heavens moved all things, there would be no freewill; even if they did, you would still have the power to resist and conquer(67–78); to a greater power and better nature than the celestial heavens you,free, are subject, and that creates the mind [the rational soul] in you, whichhas nothing to do with those revolving spheres (79–83); let me expand: Godlovingly created the (rational) soul in each of you; at its birth, since it wasmade by Him, even if it is a tabula rasa, it loves; and it loves anything at allif it is not guided or restrained; therefore, a leader and laws are necessary(84–96); laws exist, but who administers them? no one, because the pope isinvolved in temporal affairs and thus gives the wrong example that is muchimitated (97–102); thus you can see that bad guidance and not corrupt humannature accounts for the wickedness of the world; Rome, which once made the worldgood, used then to have two suns which lit each path, secular and sacred(103–108); now, since the regal and pastoral functions have been conjoined, illensues—by their fruits shall you know them (109–114); in northern Italy, whichonce was the home of courtesy and valor before the Church opposed Frederick II,there are now but three good men, all of them old (115–126); thus you must makeit known that the Church of Rome is befouled and befouling, arrogating untoitself both governments (127–129). [return to English [part0012.html#c16-s23-e]/ Italian [part0019.html#c16-s23-i]]67–78. [part0012.html#c16-s23-e] Marco’s immediate and angry response (but hisanger is meant to be taken as virtuous, as the righteous indignation of thejust) lays the issue bare. “The fault is in the stars” was an earlier day’s wayof claiming “the dog [or computer] ate my homework” or “the devil made me doit.” The celestial spheres, forming our tendencies, do incline us to varioussensuous and sensual activities, but we are not forced to follow our appetites,since we have our will to direct our appetites. The concept of free will doesnot receive its full exposition until Beatrice’s discourse upon it in ParadisoV.19–84, a moment marked by heavy seriousness because this concept lies at thevery core of any Christian moral assertion. In Platonic (and Aristotelian)terms, our sensitive soul, which responds to such stimuli, is (or should be)governed by our rational soul. [return to English [part0012.html#c16-s23-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c16-s23-i]]79–81. [part0012.html#c16-s27-e] The great Christian paradox of our freesubmission to God’s will stands before the reader here. Singleton (1973)suggests the relevance of Jesus’ reference to himself as a yoke to be borne byhis followers (Matthew 11:29) and Dante’s own paradoxical formulation, “iugumlibertatis” (the yoke of liberty) in his epistle (Epist. VI.5) to theFlorentines who were in opposition to the emperor (Henry VII) in the autumn of1310. God, the greater force and better nature, creates the third (rational)soul in us; it is not bound by celestial influences. [return to English[part0012.html#c16-s27-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c16-s27-i]]82–84. [part0012.html#c16-s28-e] Concluding the grand design of his argument,Marco triumphantly puts forward his ergo: any fault that we find when we examinehuman activity lies in us, not in our stars. And now he will expatiate on thisparadigmatic equation. [return to English [part0012.html#c16-s28-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c16-s28-i]]85–90. [part0012.html#c16-s29-e] The image of the female child (its gendermatching that of the word anima [soul]) heedless in her playfulness picks up thetrain of such images of youthful ebullience from the last canto, where the sunwas disporting himself like a little boy (see note to Purg. XV.1–6). Therational soul, as yet unknowing, turns to anything that delights it withoutmeasuring the worth of that delight. [return to English[part0012.html#c16-s29-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c16-s29-i]]91–93. [part0012.html#c16-s31-e] This “ladder” of physically attractiveobjects, beginning with trifling goods, was earlier described by Dante inConvivio IV.xii.14–18, as was apparently first noted by Scartazzini (1900), whenwe begin, as children, longing for an apple, a little bird, pretty garments,then a horse, a mistress, riches, then greater riches, and finally enormouswealth. So does the corrupt human soul move from childhood to its“maturity”—unless such appetites are controlled. [return to English[part0012.html#c16-s31-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c16-s31-i]]94–96. [part0012.html#c16-s32-e] The “ruler” that Marco (not to mention Dante)seems to have in mind would not appear to be anything but secular. Somecommentators recognize how radical an idea this is, while several of them (e.g.,Benvenuto, Lombardi) simply assume that Dante must here be speaking of areligious leader. But the language is clear: the poet here is speaking of anemperor who, guiding our race as its leader (the guida [guide] of verse 93) andupholding the laws (the fren [rein] of that verse), will allow us to see atleast the tower of the “true city.” The question of whether this is meant to beunderstood as the City of God on earth or in Heaven, or indeed of an idealsecular city, draws some dispute. Whatever the solution of that part of theriddle, the forceful and (at least potentially) disturbing fact is that Dante,in search of moral leadership for mankind (rather than for individual humans),here looks to the state rather than to the Church. [return to English[part0012.html#c16-s32-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c16-s32-i]]97–99. [part0012.html#c16-s33-e] This tercet explains the vigorous and unusualGhibelline turn in the preceding verses. The laws, left us by Justinian, existbut are not enforced. And this blame is laid upon the Church for keeping theemperor from power, since the pope may indeed ruminate, but does not distinguishbetween ecclesiastical and secular power. Tozer (1901) explains the reference asfollows: “The terms here used refer to the tests by which beasts were determinedto be clean under the Mosaic law, i.e., that they should chew the cud and dividethe hoof (Leviticus 11:3). As applied to the Heads of the Church, theallegorical meaning of ‘chewing the cud’ seems to be the acquisition of wisdomby pondering on sources of knowledge; but in respect of ‘dividing the hoof’ thesymbolism is twofold.… First, it signifies the practice of good morals,…and itis applied in this sense in vv. 100–105, where it is explained that it was theunprincipled conduct of the Roman Court which had demoralized the world.Secondly, the dividing of the hoof represents the separation of the temporal andspiritual powers, which principle the popes had ignored. This interpretation isfound in vv. 127–129, where the Church of Rome is spoken of as a beast ofburden, which falls in the mud in consequence of its not distinguishing betweenthese two spheres of government, the reference obviously being to the supportgiven to such animals in slippery ground by the divided hoof. The twoallegorical applications are not wholly unconnected with one another, because itwas greed of worldly gains which led to the appropriation of the temporal powerby the Papacy.” [return to English [part0012.html#c16-s33-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c16-s33-i]]100–102. [part0012.html#c16-s34-e] The reason that Dante here hopes only fortemporal moral leadership is now completely clear: the current papacy leadsmankind only in the example of unbridled appetite. Thus the Church, which is notto interfere with the City of Man on Earth (Augustine’s negative phrase turnedto a Dantean positive), cannot show the way to the City of God, either, and thattask is turned over, in Dante’s asseverations here, to the emperor. It isperhaps impossible to believe that he would have written such lines withouthaving Henry VII in mind as the one who must accomplish these tasks ofleadership. If Dante is writing between 1310 and 1313, it is more than likelythat he did. [return to English [part0012.html#c16-s34-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c16-s34-i]]106–108. [part0012.html#c16-s36-e] The culminating image in Marco’s discoursereturns to the “good old days” when the early Church and the empire eachperformed their functions separately.Dante is here, within the confines of a single tercet, entering polemically intoone of the great political/theological debates of his time, the relativeauthority of emperor and pope. Against the hierocrats, who warmly supportedpapal claims to supremacy, Dante argues, on the basis of a revision in thehierocrats’ central and polemical metaphor (pope as “sun,” emperor assubordinate “moon”), that the two authorities are both supreme and have theirauthority independent of one another, both being established by the direct willof God. Singleton (1973) remembers, in this context, Dante’s earlier and laterprecisions (Conv. IV.v.3–8; Mon. I.xvi.1–2) that when Christ was born under therule of Augustus the world experienced a moment of perfection, what St. Paulcalls plenitudinem temporis (“the fullness of time”—Galatians 4:4). Dante willlater develop the metaphor of the “two suns” in a key chapter of Monarchia(III.iv). (For the date of Monarchia see the brief summary of the debate inHollander [Holl.2001.1], pp. 150–51. Most currently interested in the problembelieve that the work was composed ca. 1317, i.e., after the death of Henry VII,and after Dante had composed the early cantos of his Paradiso, since inMonarchia I.xii.6 he says “sicut in Paradiso Comoedie iam dixi” [as I have saidin the Paradiso of my Comedy], referring to Paradiso V.19–24.)On the entire subject of the authority of the emperor see the still essentialwork of Ernst Kantorowicz (Kant.1957.1).

[part0012.html#c16-s37-e] Dante laments the fact that now theChurch’s pastoral crook has taken into itself the imperial sword; his image,though of inanimate things, makes the resultant object seem a horrific animatehybrid, as does the reference to Matthew 7:16 or 7:20: “by their fruits youshall know them” (words spoken by Jesus to impugn false teachers).

[part0012.html#c16-s39-e] Dante’s geographical reference is to thenortheastern sector of Italy, not the territories associated with the presenceof the emperor Frederick, but Marco’s home ground. For Dante, Frederick was thelast emperor to take his role as emperor of all Europe seriously (see Conv.IV.iii.6, as Pietrobono [1946] suggests, where he is described as “the lastemperor of the Romans”). It may seem strange that Dante should here support thekingship of Frederick II, seen among the heretics in hell (Inf. X.119). Theissue, however, is not Frederick’s personal worth, but his rights and privilegesas emperor. These were grounds for contention between Frederick and the Churchthroughout his reign (1212–50).

[part0012.html#c16-s41-e] Marco’s three vecchi, all still alive in1300, offer a Lombard counterpart to Cacciaguida’s forty or so Florentinefamilies from the “good old days” in that city that are listed in Paradiso XVI:Currado da Palazzo, from Brescia; Gherardo da Camino, from Padua; and Guido daCastello, from Reggio Emilia. All three of them had Guelph affiliations. Dantepraises the last two in Convivio when he is discussing true nobility (Conv.IV.xiv.12; IV.xvi.6).

[part0012.html#c16-s44-e] Dante shows his agreement with Marco’sanalysis of the church/state problem in contemporary Christendom in ancientHebrew terms: the family of Levi, because they were, like the sons of Aaron, ina priestly function for Israel, were denied any right to inherit land because oftheir priestly privileges. See Numbers 18:20–32. [return to English[part0012.html#c16-s44-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c16-s44-i]]133–140. [part0012.html#c16-s45-e] The protagonist’s ignorance of Gherardo’svirtues offers Marco (and the poet) a chance to replay the theme of the moment,that things are not what they used to be. The early commentators are uncertainwhether or not the mention of Gaia is meant to be to her praise or blame. Jacopodella Lana (1324) and Benvenuto say she was well known as a loose woman.However, Benvenuto’s self-proclaimed student, John of Serravalle (1416), whogenerally supports his maestro’s opinions, has only good to speak of her (andeven claims that she wrote vernacular poetry). Most modern commentators arguethat, since the argument at hand is that the old times bore at least somenotable virtue while the present day is lacking in that respect, it would onlymake sense for Gaia’s name to represent a descent from virtue. As severalcommentators suggest, until such time as some clearer evidence for Dante’sopinion of Gaia is unearthed, it is impossible to be sure of the tone of thereference, wholehearted or ironic. The only two other uses of the word gaio(joyful) in the poem are, however, totally positive: see Paradiso XV.60 andXXVI.102.

[part0012.html#c16-s47-e] Having walked through the smoke, they havenow reached its “edge,” and so may soon regain the light of the sun. Thus welearn that Marco and his colleagues, in repenting Wrath, all must measure theirpace so as not to walk either too slowly or too quickly in the smoke, which ismoving clockwise along the terrace. The smoke does not come upon them, as it didDante and Virgil; they inhabit it. Marco now retreats from the light, havingwalked too quickly in order to keep pace with his new companions.

[part0012.html#c17-s1-e] This marks the first time that an address to thereader begins a canto, here just at the midpoint of the poem. (Two later cantoswill, however, begin with such apostrophe: Paradiso II and XIII.) These openinglines are similetic in nature if not precisely so in form.Dante is apparently countering certain contemporary views, which held that moleswere completely sightless (see Brunetto Latini, Tresor I.197, cited byScartazzini [1900]). Tozer (1901) cites Virgil, Georgics I.183: “oculiscapti … talpae” (sightless moles). Benvenuto (1380), who says that he thought ofthis passage once, when he was caught in mountain mists between Florence andBologna, understood that Dante meant that moles could see, if only weakly(debiliter), through the skin that covers their eyes.This entire section of the canto is dominated by words that often in Dante referto a higher form of sight, in contrast with the darkness in which the scenebegins. In the first forty-three verses we encounter words for seeing asfollows: forms of imagine (imagine, imaginativa, imaginar) at vv. 7, 13, 21, 31,43; of vedere (vedessi, veder, vista, visïone) at vv. 2, 8, 27, 34; the wordfantasia at verse 25. [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s1-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c17-s1-i]]10–12. [part0012.html#c17-s4-e] The poet returns briefly to the narrative modein order to set the scene for what is about to follow: it is just after sunsetat the shore of the mountain, with the sun’s rays still striking the higherreaches of its slopes. [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s4-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c17-s4-i]]13–18. [part0012.html#c17-s5-e] This passage gave birth, in the earlycommentators, to the repetition of a charming story. Dante, having found a bookhe had never seen before in Siena, read it just where he found it, in a streetstall, so that he might fix it in his mind, and did so for more than three hoursone afternoon. When someone later asked him whether he had been disturbed by thewedding festivities that had occurred during his reading, he expressed noawareness that any such things had occurred. This “incident” derives fromBoccaccio’s Trattatello and is also reported by Benvenuto (1380).On these equivalent powers of the soul, the phantasia or imaginatio, see St.Thomas (ST I.lxxviii.4): “the phantasy or imagination is like a treasure houseof images received by the senses” (cited by Mussetter, “Fantasy,” inLans.2000.1). Thus both “imagination” and “phantasy” have a far differentmeaning in the works of Dante than in anything written after the Romantic era,where the imagination, given its “esemplastic power” in the unforgettable phraseof Coleridge, rather than merely receiving them, produces images. Fordiscussions of the imaginative faculty see Bundy (Bund.1927.1), Wolfson(Wolf.1935.1), and Baldelli (Bald.1985.1). See also Dumol, “Imagination,” inLans.2000.1.As the Anonimo Fiorentino (1400) explains, what is experienced by the fivesenses is registered in the senso comune and then conserved, without itsphysical elements, in the imagination, which, in contrast to the senso comune,the recipient of sense impressions only so long as they are present, is able topreserve these impressions. To paraphrase Dante’s ruminative question, he turnsto the imaginative faculty within himself to ask, “How do you so remove ourattention from outer reality that we do not even notice the most intrusiveevents? And what informs you if not a sense impression? A light that takes formin Heaven either naturally (i.e., through the natural influence of the stars) orthrough the will of God.” It seems clear that the visions that follow, likethose experienced by the protagonist two cantos earlier (see note to Purg.XV.85–86), are sent to him (and to the penitents on this terrace—but not toVirgil [see note to Purg. XV.130–132]) directly by God. [return to English[part0012.html#c17-s5-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c17-s5-i]]19–39. [part0012.html#c17-s7-e] Is the division of the sin of violence inInferno remembered here, with each of the three exemplary figures guilty of oneof the sins of violence portrayed in Inferno: against others (Procne), againstoneself (Amata), and against God (Haman)? For this possibility see notes toInferno VII.109–114 and XII.16–21 (last paragraph), as well as Hollander(Holl.1969.1), pp. 310–11. Wrath is defined, later on in this canto (vv.121–123), as involving the hardened will in a desire for revenge (vendetta). Itis clear that the sort of anger repented on this terrace is not the same sinthat we encountered in Inferno VII–VIII, where we saw those who had beenovercome by intemperate anger. Here we observe the results of wrathful behaviorformed with deliberation.It seems clear both that Dante has once again been favored by God-sent ecstaticvisions and that Virgil now knows better than to attempt to inject himself intothe proceedings: he is utterly silent throughout the scene, although we mayimagine that Dante is once again manifesting “drunken” behavior to anyone whoobserves him (see Purg. XV.121–123). [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s7-e]/ Italian [part0019.html#c17-s7-i]]19–21. [part0012.html#c17-s7-e] For Dante’s earlier advertence to Ovid’s storyof Philomel and Procne, see Purgatorio IX.13–15 and note. There Philomel isdealt with as a sympathetic figure; here Procne, her sister, is made exemplaryof the sin of Wrath for murdering her own son, Itys, in order to take vengeanceupon Tereus for raping her sister. It may seem odd to today’s readers, but Dantethinks of Procne as the nightingale, Philomel as the swallow (see note to Purg.IX.13–15). [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s7-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c17-s7-i]]25. [part0012.html#c17-s9-e] There can be little doubt: the notion of thesevisions as having “rained down” into the image-receiving faculty of his soulcements the claim made for them. Here is part of Singleton’s comment on thisverse: “The phantasy, or imaginativa, is ‘lofty’ because of the experience of avision coming from such a source. For this adjectival usage, cf. ‘la mortapoesì,’ Purg. I.7; ‘la scritta morta,’ Inf. VIII.127; ‘alto ingegno,’ Inf. II.7;and again ‘alta fantasia’ in Par. XXXIII.142.”That the poet here uses the very phrase “alta fantasia,” which will mark hisfinal vision of the Trinity three lines from the end of the poem, underlines theimportance of this “trial run” for his capacity as visionary protagonist (andeventually God-inspired poet). [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s9-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c17-s9-i]]26–30. [part0012.html#c17-s9-e] Once again one must know the story in order tounderstand the meaning of the vision, which is presented elliptically, atechnique Dante employs in all three examples in these lines (19–39). In none ofthese is the exemplary figure named. This passage is perhaps the most strikingin this respect, since the three “supporting players” are all named, while wemust supply the name of Haman. Like Procne, Haman is enraged against another(Mordecai, for not bowing down to him, when he had been promoted to beingAhasuerus’s prime minister: see Esther 3:5, where Haman is described as being“full of wrath” [iratus est valde]); like Procne, he tries to take revenge bykilling others, deciding to put to death all the Jews in the kingdom ofAhasuerus. At Esther’s urging Ahasuerus rescinds the decree Haman had wrung fromhim, thus saving God’s people, the Jews in their Persian exile, and has Hamanput to death on the gallows (crux in the Vulgate at Esther 5:14, thus accountingfor Dante’s crucifisso at verse 26). [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s9-e]/ Italian [part0019.html#c17-s9-i]]31–33. [part0012.html#c17-s11-e] The “bubble” in Dante’s vision breaks as abubble does when it rises above the water that contained it, only to give placeto another, the final vision of this terrace. [return to English[part0012.html#c17-s11-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c17-s11-i]]34–39. [part0012.html#c17-s12-e] Lavinia, anonymous at first but soon to nameherself (verse 37), addresses her unnamed mother, Amata, the consort of Latinus,king of Latium, and reproaches her for her suicide. As Bosco/Reggio (1979) pointout, Dante, in the spring of 1311, deals with this scene (Aen. XII.595–603) inhis second epistle to Henry VII and refers correctly to the context of Amata’ssuicide (Epist. VII.24), i.e., she kills herself because she believes that heropposition to her daughter’s marriage to Aeneas has resulted in a failed war andthe death of Turnus (whom she wrongly assumes to have been killed when she seesthe soldiers of Aeneas approaching the city without opposition). Followingexpressions of puzzlement with Dante’s treatment of this Virgilian text byPorena (1946), Bosco and Reggio too are puzzled that Dante here develops thesituation differently, and suggest that perhaps Dante wants here to make Amata amore sympathetic character. But perhaps he had simpler plans.In Aeneid VII.286–405, Virgil presents the results of Juno’s anger at Latinus’spromise of Lavinia in marriage to Aeneas (and not to Turnus, the suitorpreferred by Amata, described in verse 345 as a woman on fire, stirred by angers[irae]). Juno’s wrath in turn stirs the Fury Alecto, who comes to earth and putsa venomous snake in Amata’s breast. Poisoned by its venom, Amata goes mad withangry grief and, in the guise of a Bacchante, takes Lavinia to the countrysidein the attempt to stop the marriage. All of this insubordination will, ofcourse, eventually fail. It is not clear that Dante is reading the text ofVirgil’s twelfth book any differently now than he was when he wrote his secondletter to Henry (whether that was written before or after this passage). At whommust Amata be angry, from the point of view of Lavinia? Aeneas, because he willnow have Lavinia in marriage. In the epistle, Florence, rejecting her rightfulruler, Henry, is compared to suicidal Amata. There is no reason for such not tobe Dante’s understanding here. It is perhaps coincidental that the descriptionof Amata’s suicide is preceded in Virgil by a simile comparing the losingLatians to bees whose hive has been penetrated by the farmer’s emetic smoke;nonetheless, our scene is also preceded by the smoke of anger. Amata, in thisrespect similar to the two previous exemplary figures, kills someone else inorder to harm the person whom she truly hates, Aeneas. That someone else isherself. Hers is the secret of the terrorist, dying to let her enemy know thedepths of her envious hatred.The “death of yet another” with which the passage ends refers to Turnus in sucha way as to indicate that Lavinia understood that her mother had incorrectlyassumed that Turnus was already dead, just as she does in Virgil’s poem. [returnto English [part0012.html#c17-s12-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c17-s12-i]]40–45. [part0012.html#c17-s14-e] The simile is not difficult or surprising.Just as a dreaming sleeper, awakened by a sunbeam, loses his hold on his dreamin bits and pieces before it utterly disappears, so was Dante jarred from hisvisionary sleep by the sudden brightness of the Angel of Mercy. This angeliclight outshines even that of the sun, explains Benvenuto (1380), “because anangel gives off light more splendid than any light found in the world.”This simile should be remembered in the reading of the final simile of awakeningin the poem (Par. XXXIII.58–63). Dante’s fascination with the state betweendream and waking is a notable part of his program of investigating the mentalstate of humans (see note to Inf. XXX.136–141). [return to English[part0012.html#c17-s14-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c17-s14-i]]55–60. [part0012.html#c17-s19-e] Perhaps a paraphrase of Virgil’s remarks willbe helpful: “This divine spirit does what we wish without our asking, hidingitself in its own radiance (and thus allowing us to see); and it deals with usas we deal with ourselves, for he who sees a need, and yet waits to be asked,unkindly predisposes himself toward denying the request.” As Daniello (1568)noted, this is a restatement of a Senecan motto (De beneficiis II.i.3),concerning the grace of giving before one is asked, that Dante had already madehis own in Convivio I.viii.16. [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s19-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c17-s19-i]]62–63. [part0012.html#c17-s21-e] For the “rule” (apparently more consented tothan insisted on) that governs nocturnal stasis on the mountain see Sordello’sexplanation (Purg. VII.53–60).

[part0012.html#c17-s23-e] The Angel of Mercy draws upon the Beatitudefound in Matthew 5:9, “Blessed are the peacemakers,” yet does so in such a wayas to indicate tacitly the distinction between “good” anger (righteousindignation) and the “bad” form of wrath (ira mala) that is fueled by desire forpersonal revenge. [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s23-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c17-s23-i]]70–72. [part0012.html#c17-s24-e] The sun having set, its rays touch only thehigher reaches of the mountain.

[part0012.html#c17-s25-e] The protagonist’s inner apostrophe of hisflagging power of locomotion shows his awareness of the special kind ofnocturnal debility afflicting souls on this mountain. As we will see, hisphysical condition matches that of a man who is slothful. [return to English[part0012.html#c17-s25-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c17-s25-i]]79–80. [part0012.html#c17-s27-e] Since, on the terrace of Wrath, Dante’slearning experiences occurred in darkness, and since it is dark as he enters thefourth terrace, he assumes that he may be instructed in virtue by what he willhear. [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s27-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c17-s27-i]]82–87. [part0012.html#c17-s28-e] Just as the poem is now entering its secondhalf and this cantica is arriving at its midpoint, so the experience of therepentance of the seven capital vices has come to its central moment with Sloth.From Dante’s question and Virgil’s answer we also understand that there is agulf separating the vices below, all of which begin in the love of what iswrongful, from the rest, all of which result from insufficient or improperdesire to attain the good. The sin purged here is called acedia in Latin andaccidia in Italian. (For a lengthy consideration see Wenzel’s book[Wenz.1967.1.]; see also Andrea Ciotti’s entry, which sometimes takes issue withWenzel, “accidia e accidiosi” in ED I [1970]; for a wider view of acedia seeKuhn [Kuhn.1976.1], with special reference to Dante on pp. 56–59.) In the poem,the word will appear in the next canto, used retrospectively to indicate the sinrepented here (Purg. XVIII.132); however, in adjectival form it was presentearlier (Inf. VII.123—see note to Inf. VII.118–126). Scartazzini (1900) bringsSt. Thomas (ST I.lxiii.2) into play as the one who affords a clear understandingof this sin, a kind of spiritual torpor accompanied by (or even causing)physical weariness.

[part0012.html#c17-s30-e] This second extended “diagram” is excused, aswas the first (Inferno XI), by the need to linger awhile before continuing thejourney. Compare verse 84 and Inferno XI.10–15.

[part0012.html#c17-s31-e] The rest of the canto is given over, withoutinterruption, to Virgil’s discourse on the nature of love. It misses only by alittle being the longest speech we have heard spoken in the poem since Ugolino’sin Inferno XXXIII.4–75, beaten out by Sordello’s recounting of the currentdenizens of the Valley of the Princes (Purg. VII.87–136) and of course by Marcothe Lombard’s discourse on the related failures of Church and empire (Purg.XVI.65–129). [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s31-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c17-s31-i]]91–92. [part0012.html#c17-s31-e] The given of Virgil’s whole speech is theuniversality of love. It proceeds from God in all His creation, and from allthings that He has created. In the rational beings (angels and humans), itreturns to Him; in the lower animals, to one another and to their habitat; ininsentient bodies, to their habitat (e.g., water lilies on ponds) or place oforigin (e.g., fire always wanting to reach the sky beneath the moon). SeeConvivio III.iii.2–5, cited by Singleton (1973). [return to English[part0012.html#c17-s31-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c17-s31-i]]93–96. [part0012.html#c17-s31-e] Love is of two kinds, natural or “mental.”Natural love always desires the utmost good, and for rational beings that isGod. Thus all humans naturally desire the good. If that were the only love thatmotivated us, there would be no sin in the world. However, there is another kindof love, one reached by a mental effort, and thus found only in angels andhumans. (Since angels have all made their will known, to love God eternally,only humans will be the subjects of Virgil’s discourse.) Human beings, usingtheir free wills, may fall into three kinds of sin: choosing the wrong objectfor their loves (sins repented on the first three terraces); loving the gooddeficiently (as do the slothful, whom we are about to encounter); loving thegood excessively (the sins repented on the three highest terraces, Avarice,Gluttony, Lust). For discussion of the way in which Dante, unlike AndreasCapellanus and Guido Cavalcanti, is interested in affirming only spiritual love,see Pasquazi (Pasq.1970.1), pp. 227–31. [return to English[part0012.html#c17-s31-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c17-s31-i]]97–102. [part0012.html#c17-s33-e] The lines essentially repeat what has beenestablished in vv. 91–96, as though Dante sensed the difficulty most readerswould be likely to have with this conceptual poetry. [return to English[part0012.html#c17-s33-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c17-s33-i]]103–105. [part0012.html#c17-s35-e] The argument pauses for its firstaffirmation: whether we sin or use our (free) wills well, the results observedcome from our ways of loving—and our merit or demerit accords with the nature ofour loves.

[part0012.html#c17-s36-e] The first consequence of this doctrine isto remove two possible motivations from consideration: hatred of self or hatredof God, both of which are declared to be impossible. Singleton points out thatsinners like Capaneus (Inf. XIV) and Vanni Fucci (Inf. XXV) indeed dodemonstrate a hatred for God, a feeling possible only in hell, but not in thislife on earth. The sins of suicide and blasphemy, however, surely seem tocontradict this theoretical notion. [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s36-e]/ Italian [part0019.html#c17-s36-i]]112–124. [part0012.html#c17-s38-e] Hatred of self or of God having beendiscarded as motivations for immoral human conduct, hatred of our neighborremains, expressed in (1) prideful desire that his success be reversed so thatwe may be his superior, (2) in envious desire that his success be thwarted, (3)in wrathful desire to take revenge for the harm he has inflicted on us.

[part0012.html#c17-s42-e] These two verses refer to all of the otherfour sins as a group united in at least seeking the good (as was not the casefor the first three), but imperfectly.

[part0012.html#c17-s43-e] Virgil now defines Sloth, the first ofthese two better kinds of sin, as “laggard love.” Thus, by failing to respond toGod’s offered love more energetically, the slothful are more rebellious to Himthan are the avaricious, gluttonous, and lustful, who are pursuing a secondarygood rather than avoiding the primary one. In Dante’s day, Sloth was a sinparticularly identified with the clergy, with reference not so much to theirphysical laziness as to their spiritually laggard lives. See Kuhn (Kuhn.1976.1),pp. 39–64.

[part0012.html#c18-s1-e] This canto continues the flow of the last with nodemarcation in the text itself of a terminus or of a new beginning. As Boscopoints out in his introductory remarks to the two cantos, they form a unitdeveloped on a chiastic pattern:[../images/00010.jpeg]Further, these two cantos form a larger unit with Purgatorio XVI, which issimilarly divided into two large blocks of material: 1–63 (narrative) and 64–145(Marco’s instruction). In this way the numerical center of the Commedia, cantos49–51, is made more noticeable. (For the midpoint with respect to the number oflines in the poem see the note to Purg. XVII.118–119.)Ricci (Ricc.1970.1), p. 252, suggests that Dante spreads Virgil’s full canto’sworth (145 verses) of speechifying over two cantos so as not to strain thereader’s patience.

[part0012.html#c18-s1-e] Virgil’s “Scholastic” credentials seem strong.See Tarozzi’s appreciation (Taro.1901.1), p. 7: Virgil “here represents theidealized figure of the medieval docent.” A close analysis of his discourse inthe preceding canto, such as may be found, in English, in Singleton’scommentary, reveals a line of argument that is closely based on Thomistic texts.In keeping with such discourse and for the first time since Inferno XVI.48,Virgil is saluted by his pupil as “professor” (dottore). For the other termsused to describe Virgil’s role as guide in the poem, see note to Inferno II.140.In fact, Virgil has rarely been referred to or addressed by Dante with suchfervent admiration as here and shortly later in this canto, when he will be“padre verace” (true father—7), “Maestro” (Master—10), and then “father” again(13). See note to vv. 17–18. [return to English [part0012.html#c18-s1-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c18-s1-i]]4. [part0012.html#c18-s2-e] In this and the next canto the protagonist’sforward movement in understanding is underlined by the adjective nuovo (new):used here for his new “thirst,” at verse 141 for his “new thought” in reactionto the departure of the penitents in Sloth, and at XIX.56, in his reference tothe new dream he has just had on this terrace. [return to English[part0012.html#c18-s2-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c18-s2-i]]8. [part0012.html#c18-s3-e] Dante’s “timid wish” should probably be consideredrelated to intellectual sloth (see Purg. XVII.130, lento amore [laggard love]).How could Dante have considered himself “timid” in seeking the truth? Had heinvolved himself in a less than urgent affection for the good, the charge wouldseem appropriate. Since it is the author who makes the charge, it might seemthat he himself believed that he did not always display the zeal necessary forloving well. [return to English [part0012.html#c18-s3-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c18-s3-i]]13–15. [part0012.html#c18-s5-e] Why, one might ask, after Virgil’s long speechin the last canto, should Dante want Virgil to “expound” love when he seems justnow to have finished (with suitable fanfare) doing precisely that? What theprotagonist means is “expatiate upon,” “explain more precisely,” the argumentjust now presented. The word dimostrare is here, in fact, a verb based on theLatin noun demonstratio, as used to refer to the development of proofs by meansof syllogistic demonstration. See Paradiso XXIV.96. [return to English[part0012.html#c18-s5-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c18-s5-i]]17–18. [part0012.html#c18-s6-e] Virgil’s words reflect Matthew 15:14, whereJesus says that the Pharisees are blind guides of the blind who follow them,adding that guide and flock shall all end up falling into a ditch.In Convivio I.xi.4 Dante cites this passage, directing its barb against “thosewicked Italians who praise the vernacular of others while disparaging their own”(Conv. I.xi.1) and who are therefore likewise headed toward disaster. AsFrancesco Mazzoni argues (“Latini, Brunetto,” ED III [1971], p. 580b]), in thisconnection it is difficult not to think of Dante’s fellow Florentine BrunettoLatini, who wrote his encyclopedic Tresor in French rather than in his nativevernacular (see Pézard [Peza.1950.1] for extensive development of this idea).Also to be considered are the words, written shortly before or shortly afterthis passage (on the problems of dating Dve and Conv. see Hollander[Holl.2001.1], pp. 54–55), in De vulgari eloquentia I.xiii.1, when Dante“exiles” Brunetto from the illustrious and courtly vernacular that he ischampioning, relegating him to the ash heap of the municipal vernacular, the“street talk” that is to be avoided by serious poets. In what seems to have beena change of heart, Brunetto, in the fifteenth canto of Inferno, will be treatedgenerously as Dante’s vernacular “teacher” (Inf. XV.85), just as Virgil was hisfirst Latin guide. It seems clear that these two are joined only by GuidoGuinizzelli as explicitly paternal figures of writerly authority for the Tuscanpoet.Dante refers to, whether as protagonist or as poet, various “fathers” in thecourse of the poem (this is to exclude “fathers” addressed by other characters).The parenthetic reference is to the first appearance of each “father.”(1) Virgil (Inf. VIII.110)(2) Brunetto Latini (Inf. XV.83)(3) Cato of Utica (Purg. I.33)(4) Guido Guinizzelli (Purg. XXVI.97)(5) God (addressed as “good Apollo,” Par. I.28)(6) St. Francis (Par.

[part0012.html#c18-s7-e] Virgil, responding to Dante’s request, carrieshis analysis of the loving human mind to the next level, the role of therational soul in determining human choice and, therefore, action. This tercetestablishes the subject of Virgil’s difficult clarification (vv. 22–39): howmind (the rational soul, created directly by God and instilled in the embryolast [see Purg. XXV.67–75]) reacts appetitively to external things. [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c18-s7-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c18-s7-i]]22–27. [part0012.html#c18-s8-e] The apprensiva (power of perception), alreadyimplicitly referred to in Dante’s apostrophe of the imaginativa (faculty ofimagination) in Purgatorio XVII.13–15, is the faculty of perception that reactsto the capturing of an image (referred to here as an intenzione) of externalreality in the imaginazione or fantasia (see note to XVII.13–18). The mind, asopposed to the “natural desire” of the senses (see Purg. XVII.93 for thisdistinction), which is always errorless, is responsible for its choices and mayerr. If its perception inclines toward what it contemplates, that is what wecall love. [return to English [part0012.html#c18-s8-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c18-s8-i]]28–33. [part0012.html#c18-s10-e] Desire, love in action, now continues byextending toward its goal and remaining in this state as long as it takespleasure in its appetites. (For fire as an example of “natural desire,” see noteto Purg. XVII.91–92.) Thus here Dante is comparing intellectual desire tonatural desire, but also insisting on the distance between them. Natural desirecan never be culpable (e.g., fire always “desires” to rise—that is its naturalinclination). There is perhaps no moment in the poem of greater danger to itsessential philosophical position. Is human desire—for money, food, or sexualpleasure—not as “natural” as this? Does anyone not desire these things? Dante’sattempt to persuade us, as he may well have realized, reflects that of anotherdottore and maestro, Jesus. He, as the Gospels amply testify, also spokefrequently, in his parables, in terms of human desires that all couldunderstand, e.g., of money, agriculture, marriage. In all cases the listener isencouraged, even impelled, to understand that such pleasures, as great as theymay be, will seem as nothing compared to the joys of Heaven.Arriving at this point in the argument, a reader would have to be pardoned forbelieving that whatever good the spirit of love pursues is ipso facto good, justas the protagonist himself will shortly seem to believe (vv. 43–45). But what isthe nature of the “moto spiritale” (movement of the spirit) of the “captivemind”? That question is reflected in the crucial and concluding portion ofVirgil’s discourse. [return to English [part0012.html#c18-s10-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c18-s10-i]]34–39. [part0012.html#c18-s12-e] The main candidates for this unenviabledenomination, the errant folk who believe that all love is good (a proposition,as we have seen, that we might have considered unassailable a moment ago), havebeen Epicureans. In the modern period this view is first offered by Scartazzini(1900) but then is held by many twentieth-century commentators. Grabher (1934)is of the opinion that this is the position of all love poets, including theyounger Dante. His view, sometimes combined with that of Scartazzini, has grownincreasingly attractive to recent commentators. Clearly, anyone who believesthat love is in itself and always praiseworthy is among this group.The “imprint” on the “wax” of our love becomes the crucial symbolic expressionof the concept developed here. The “wax” clearly refers to the innate humanpotential to love, which is “stamped” by the image that the mind has extractedfrom reality; that “stamp” may either be worthy or unworthy, while the “wax” isalways worthy. [return to English [part0012.html#c18-s12-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c18-s12-i]]40–45. [part0012.html#c18-s14-e] It is, despite Virgil’s last insistence onthe (implicit) need for the proper exercise of the free will in choosing theobjects of one’s desire, understandable that Dante, up to this point,understands that the mind is completely responsive to internalized (by theapprensiva) external stimuli (the intenzione—see verse 23), and thusirreprehensible in whatever choice it makes. [return to English[part0012.html#c18-s14-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c18-s14-i]]46–48. [part0012.html#c18-s16-e] This passage offers perhaps the onlyapparently material evidence in the poem that would tie both Virgil and Beatriceto an allegorical status, his role being that of Reason, hers, Faith. But seeHollander (Holl.1990.1), p. 42, n. 2: “It is from Virgil’s lips that we firsthear the name Beatrice … in Purgatorio: VI.46; XV.77; XVIII.48. In her firstthree nominal presences in this cantica…she is associated first with hope(VI.32), then with love (XV.68; XV.71; XV,74), then with faith.” Thus associatedwith the three theological virtues, Beatrice can be seen as possessing all ofthem; she probably should not be seen as representing any one of them, or ashaving an “allegorical” status in this poem. [return to English[part0012.html#c18-s16-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c18-s16-i]]49–75. [part0012.html#c18-s17-e] The three cantos at the center of Purgatoriodevote what may seem immoderate space to what Benedetto Croce disliked in Dante,his “non-poesia,” his “structure,” his mere allotria (the “extraneous matter” ofphilosophy or theology that Croce deprecated in Dante; opposing such views,Salsano [Sals.1967.1], p. 542, speaks of the Comedy as “un poema e non un librodi poesie”). Marco’s long speech in XVI (65–129), Virgil’s in XVII (91–139), andVirgil’s concluding two in this canto (16–39; 49–75) should be looked upon, asshould the related discursive portions of Cantos XXIV and XXV, as part of acontinuing development of a complex statement about the nature and function oflove, presented from different vantage points. In Canto XXIV, Dante’spresentation of the Holy Spirit’s creative role in helping to make the writingsof a handful of poets acceptable to God prepares for the following treatment inCanto XXV of the way the Holy Spirit is breathed into all of us, thus explaininghow eventually a very few of us may become acceptable to God as His saints inParadise. In these three cantos Marco the Lombard explains the need for propercivil governance because our free will may elsewise lead us astray, while Virgiltakes up a related topic, the need for us individually to use our free willcorrectly in choosing and responding to the objects of our attention andaffection. [return to English [part0012.html#c18-s17-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c18-s17-i]]49–60. [part0012.html#c18-s17-e] The only “substantial form” to be bothdistinct from matter and joined to it is the human soul, which is formed by puredivine intellect (as are the angels) and by emotional and vegetative powers (asare the beasts). Its specifica vertute (defining disposition), as we learn atvv. 55–57, is composed of primal intellect and primal will, and is onlyperceptible in the action of the soul, not in itself. Now, leaving intellectionout of consideration, Virgil continues: We have no recollection or currentunderstanding of our original inclination (to love God), yet we do demonstrateits presence in us, as the eagerness of bees for making honey reveals their“defining disposition.” This kind of (natural) will exists beyond and beforemoral assent. [return to English [part0012.html#c18-s17-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c18-s17-i]]61–66. [part0012.html#c18-s21-e] This innate will (see Purg. XXI.105, la virtùche vuole [the power that wills]) must accord with la virtù che consiglia (thefaculty that counsels), the higher intellect that should govern all our choices;our ability to choose good and to discard evil affections is the ground for themeasurement of our moral condition. [return to English [part0012.html#c18-s21-e]/ Italian [part0019.html#c18-s21-i]]67–69. [part0012.html#c18-s23-e] Aristotle’s Ethics is probably Dante’s mainsource for his views on morality (a view supported by Benvenuto da Imola).However, to account for the plurality of the reference, Poletto (1894) sensiblyrefers to Dante’s own earlier phrasing (found in the words of Virgil), “I speakof Aristotle and of Plato / and of many others” (Purg. III.43–44). [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c18-s23-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c18-s23-i]]70–75. [part0012.html#c18-s24-e] Virgil’s lengthy discourse concludes with hisfinal insistence on the pivotal role of free will in individual moralresponsibility and looks forward (as Benvenuto was perhaps the first to realize)to Beatrice’s remarks on the subject in Paradiso V.19–24, asseverating that thefreedom of the will is the greatest of God’s gifts to humankind. Many of theearly commentators find this a convenient place for them to reassert the“allegorical” valence of Beatrice, here interpreted as “Theology.” In the past150 years many commentators are content to leave the allegorical equation inabeyance, merely referring to Beatrice as herself. [return to English[part0012.html#c18-s24-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c18-s24-i]]76–81. [part0012.html#c18-s26-e] Returning to narrative, the poet returns totelling the time. The moon, as the slowest “planet” in Dante’s astronomy, isfittingly the celestial body referred to on the terrace of Sloth. Its appearanceis compared by Benvenuto to the semicircular fire in a lighthouse, glowingthroughout the night.The moon, Dante would seem to be saying, was roughly on the same path taken bythe sun when it sets in the southwest (when seen from Rome) in late November,between Sardinia and Corsica.

[part0012.html#c18-s28-e] The protagonist’s gratitude to Virgil isexpressed with a salute to his birthplace, Pietola (“Andes” in Roman times).Some early commentators read the phrase “più che villa mantoana” to mean “morethan the city Mantua,” while the meaning is nearly certainly “more than anyMantuan town,” i.e., any other town in the vicinity of the city, not Mantuaitself, as Padoan (Pado.1967.1), p. 688n., agrees. [return to English[part0012.html#c18-s28-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c18-s28-i]]87–88. [part0012.html#c18-s29-e] Again a detail—Dante’s somnolence—establishesa connection with Sloth.

[part0012.html#c18-s30-e] These penitents, as opposed to the wrathful,move in the same counterclockwise direction that is followed by Dante andVirgil. It would seem that, while the movement of Dante to the right is morallydetermined, that of the penitents is not, is rather the result of aestheticconsiderations. Review of the various groups that are in motion suggests thatsuch is the case. Below the gate, we see that the excommunicate are movingrightwards (Purg. III.59), while the late-repentant seem to be heading to theleft (V.23). On the terraces, the prideful seem to be moving right (X.100),while the wrathful are headed left (XV.142). Here in Sloth the penitents comefrom behind Virgil and Dante but are moving in the same direction (XVIII.90).Farther up the mountain the penitent gluttons are also moving counterclockwise(XXIII.19–20), while the two distinct bands of the lustful proceed in twodifferent directions (XXVI.29). [return to English [part0012.html#c18-s30-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c18-s30-i]]91–96. [part0012.html#c18-s31-e] This is a fairly rare occurrence inPurgatorio, a simile based explicitly on classical materials (but see Purg.IX.34–42, for the similetic reference to Statius’s Achilles). And there will notbe another (now based on a passage in Lucan) until Purgatorio XXIV.64–69.Ismenus and Asopus are names of rivers, the first flowing through the city ofThebes, the second near it. Beginning with Jacopo della Lana (1324),commentators have offered the opinion, from time to time, that Dante’s sourcehere is Statius (Thebaid IX). Ismenos is named at IX.404, his “brother” Asoposat IX.449. The passage includes two references to the orgiastic Bacchic rites(IX.434–436; 478–480) to which Dante here refers. [return to English[part0012.html#c18-s31-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c18-s31-i]]97–98. [part0012.html#c18-s33-e] Running in a group to counteract the painfulmemory of their solitary slothful behaviors on earth, all these gatheredpenitents may put contemporary readers in mind of the massed crowds of runnersin metropolitan marathons. [return to English [part0012.html#c18-s33-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c18-s33-i]]99–138. [part0012.html#c18-s33-e] With the exception of the concludinginteraction with the angel in the following canto, separated by Dante’s sleepand dream from the action on the fourth terrace, all the usual “events” of anyterrace are here condensed—in the compressed style appropriate to thedescription of the newly zealous—into these forty verses. All terraces includethe following features in the same order: (1) description of the physical aspectof the terrace, (2) exemplars of the countering virtue, (3) description of thepenitents, (4) recitation of their sins by particular penitents, (5) exemplarsof the vice, (6) appearance to Dante of the angel representing the opposingvirtue.We might want to reflect on the extraordinary artisanship of the presentation ofthe exemplary material on the earlier terraces, things not matched by what wefind in earlier medieval poems: the “speaking” (and odoriferous) intaglios ofPride, the voices streaking overhead in Envy, the ecstatic visions of Wrath. Itis as though Dante had used up all the brilliant new techniques of presentationof which he could think and now, for the rest of the ascent, subsides to theperfectly acceptable artistic level of utterance, leaving us to marvel at whathe had done before. On three of the last four terraces the names (sometimesaccompanied by reference to significant deeds) of all exemplary figures aresimply called out by the penitents, while on the terrace of Gluttony, in avariant, the two trees do the talking. [return to English[part0012.html#c18-s33-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c18-s33-i]]99–102. [part0012.html#c18-s33-e] Some of the earliest commentators believethat the reference is to the precipitous escape from Herod’s decree and theflight of the holy family into Egypt (a misinterpretation that surfaced again inthe Renaissance in the commentaries of Landino and Vellutello). However,beginning with Pietro di Dante (1340) the obvious citation of Luke 1:39 has beenrecognized as governing this example. Mary, having been told by Gabriel duringthe Annunciation of Elizabeth’s miraculous pregnancy in her old age (which willresult in the birth of John the Baptist), “abiit in montana cumfestinatione … et salutavit Elisabeth” (went with good speed into the hillcountry … and offered her salutation to Elizabeth). [return to English[part0012.html#c18-s33-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c18-s33-i]]101–102. [part0012.html#c18-s34-e] The Roman example paired with Mary is noneother than Julius Caesar. It is notable that in Lucan (Phars. III.453), Caesar’srushing off to do battle in Spain is not the result of military strategy but ofhis being bored (inpatiens) with the prolonged efforts to lay siege toMarseilles. Further, his eventual victory at Lerida is described by Lucan asbeing the result of fortunate changes in the weather (Phars. IV.48–49). ThusDante’s praise of him here is clearly at odds with Lucan’s (always) witheringscorn for the Great Man whom he so desperately despises. For the entire questionof Dante’s divided view of Julius Caesar, in one view the first, God-sentemperor of Rome, in another the destroyer of the Republic and of Roman virtue,see Stull and Hollander (Stul.1991.1), pp. 33–43. This is one of Julius’s fewpositive moments in Dante’s poem; and Dante needed to disregard Lucan’s views inorder to present him favorably. For Dante’s previous and next far less favorablereferences to Julius, see the notes to Purgatorio IX.133–138 and XXVI.76–78.[return to English [part0012.html#c18-s34-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c18-s34-i]]103. [part0012.html#c18-s35-e] On every other terrace the penitents have aprayer that they speak in common when they are not interrupted by other forms ofobservance or by conversation with Dante and Virgil (see Purg. XI.1–24;XIII.50–51; XVI.19; XIX.73; XXIII.11; XXV.121). The terrace of Sloth offers theonly exception, as though the previous acedia of these penitents took from themthe privilege of Christian prayer. The gloss of Carroll (1904) is interesting:“The idea seems … to be the danger of contemplation of good deeds, without aneager and immediate effort to imitate them. Mere ‘study’ of them may end in the‘little love’ which produces sloth. It is only when ‘study’ is accompanied byaction that it ‘makes grace bud again.’ ” For Dante, a man devoted to thepursuit of the morally engaged active life, certain occasions for prayer perhapsappeared to offer a potential escape from one’s civil and religious duty in theworld. Men and women of such disposition are thus, here in their penitence,denied the comfort of prayer until such time as prayer will be totally zealous,not the occasion for a moment of repose from worldly responsibility or, for thatmatter, from proper monastic exertion. Acedia was frequently associated withimproper monastic otium, a withdrawal from the world but from one’s duty to Godas well, surely a great temptation in the relative ease allowed by monasticlife.

[part0012.html#c18-s35-e] The phrase “per poco amor” (for lack oflove) and the word “studio” (the Italian equivalent of the Latin word for“zeal”) combine to underline the defining vice and virtue of this terrace.[return to English [part0012.html#c18-s35-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c18-s35-i]]107. [part0012.html#c18-s36-e] Virgil’s “perhaps” is a gentle act of politesseon his part: these penitents were guilty of precisely what he describes.

[part0012.html#c18-s40-e] San Zeno, just outside the city of Verona(and, by common consent, one of the most beautiful churches in Italy), was alsothe site of a monastery. Its nameless abbot, who speaks here, is generallyidentified as “Gherardo II, who was abbot, in the time of the Emperor FrederickI, from 1163 till his death in 1187” (T). Frederick Barbarossa, emperor from1152 until his death in 1190 as Frederick I, was a grandfather of Frederick II(emperor 1215–50). Dante’s overall opinion of him is difficult to measure, sincehe so rarely refers to him, but in the two passages that do invoke him, here andin Epistle VI.20, his destruction of Milan in 1162 for its anti-imperialactivities is clearly applauded. On the question of Dante’s views of Barbarossasee Nardi (Nard.1966.1).For the less than likely possibility that the adjective “buon” (good) thatprecedes his name is here to be taken ironically, see Tommaseo (1837) on thispassage. One may add that the thirty occasions in the Commedia on which a readerfinds the epithet combined with a name or title (e.g., “buon Marzucco,” “buonmaestro”) do not reveal a single one in which an ironic reading seems warranted.[return to English [part0012.html#c18-s40-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c18-s40-i]]121–126. [part0012.html#c18-s41-e] Dante, welcomed by the Scaligeri family toVerona in 1303–4, there enjoyed the first happy time of his exile. His memoriesof those rulers of the city give rise to a post-eventum prophecy. Alberto dellaScala was lord of Verona until his death in 1301, by which time he had appointedhis lame, illegitimate son, Giuseppe (1263–1313), to serve as abbot of themonastery (in 1292), for the rest of his days. Alberto was succeeded by hiseldest legitimate son, Bartolommeo, nearly certainly Dante’s first host inVerona. Upon Bartolommeo’s death, in 1304, Alberto’s second son, Alboino, becamelord (many believe that Dante and Alboino did not get along, thus explainingDante’s departure from Verona around 1304), a position he held until his deathin 1311, when he was succeeded by Cangrande della Scala, the third legitimateson and Dante’s patron and host when the poet returned to Verona ca. 1314.[return to English [part0012.html#c18-s41-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c18-s41-i]]127–129. [part0012.html#c18-s43-e] The nameless abbot is moving so quicklythat Dante cannot tell whether he has finished speaking or has simply moved toofar ahead to be heard while continuing to speak—a nice final touch to convey thezeal with which he pursued his penitence.

The matrons set fire to theships and Aeneas, having saved all but four of them from destruction, allows allwho wish to stay behind to do so (Aen. V.604–761). Padoan (Pado.1967.1), p. 686,argues that Dante’s treatment of Aeneid V here differs from that found inConvivio IV.xxvi.11, but the difference can be explained by the fact that in theearlier passage Dante focuses on the willingness of Aeneas to allow thediscouraged to stay behind found in Virgil’s text itself, while here he judgesthe malingerers from a different vantage point, the divinely sanctionedimperative to found new Troy in Latium.

Is it one triggered by what he has seenand heard? Or is he anticipating the matters he will rehearse in his dream inthe next canto? Or is the poet merely describing, generically, the way in whichthe mind works as it flits from subject to subject on the way to sleep (a viewthat is much present in the commentaries)? In the next canto, a similar phrasewill refer to a mental image already experienced (the novella visïon of XIX.56)in his previous dream. Thus here it is at least possible that the “new thought”is a response to what he has seen or heard. Could he have wondered whether hewas himself more like the backsliding Hebrews and Trojans than he is like Joshuaor Aeneas? This would seem possible, but not demonstrable. In any case, thisunreported thought leads to still others, and these are clearly—because the texttells us so—the matter of his dream.

[part0012.html#c18-s48-e] The verb Dante uses to describe his floatingstate of consciousness, vaneggiai (rambled), picks up an earlier phrasing, whenhe compares himself to one who sonnolento vana (rambles in his drowsy mind—verse87) after Virgil has finished his explanation of love and free will. There he isfalling into a fatigue that mirrors the sin purged on this terrace. Here hefinally gives in to that weight of somnolence.

[part0012.html#c18-s48-e] Dante’s purgatorial dreams are described incantos IX, XIX, and XXVII, but the second occurs here, in a single line, “e ’lpensamento in sogno trasmutai” (and I transformed my musings into dream). Sincein Vita nuova he presents his age as having been nine, eighteen, andtwenty-seven for his three main “encounters” with Beatrice, the poet perhapswanted to retain those three nine-based and nine-spaced numbers for his threedreams that lead back to her now. For this calculation see Hollander(Holl.1969.1), p. 145. [return to English [part0012.html#c18-s48-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c18-s48-i]]PURGATORIO XIX1–3. [part0012.html#c19-s1-e] Dante apparently believed that the rays of themoon, in his time considered a “cold planet” (e.g., by Jacopo della Lana[1324]), enhanced the natural nocturnal cooling of the earth, its temperaturefurther decreased whenever another “cold” planet, Saturn, was visible above thehorizon. The hour is just before dawn on Tuesday, the beginning of Dante’s thirdday at the antipodes. For an earlier Dantean reference to the coldness of Saturnsee Convivio II.xiii.25. [return to English [part0012.html#c19-s1-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c19-s1-i]]4–6. [part0012.html#c19-s2-e] The early commentators who deal with theproblems encountered here are in fairly close accord. Beginning with Benvenutoda Imola they indicate the following: geomancers are diviners who create chartsbased on random points on the earth’s surface and drawn in the sand (and latercopied onto paper or in sand on a tabletop) that can be linked in such a way, byjoining various of these points with lines, to create a number of figures(Daniello [1568], following Landino, names sixteen of these). The facts behindthe passage seem to be pretty much as Grandgent (1909) said: “ ‘Geomancers’foretold the future by means of figures constructed on points that weredistributed by chance. Their specialty was the selection of favorable spots forburial. They were the first in Europe to use the compass. One of their figures,called fortuna major, or ‘greater fortune,’ resembled a combination of the laststars of Aquarius and the first of Pisces. As these constellations immediatelyprecede Aries, in which the sun is from March 21 to April 21, the figure inquestion can be seen in the east shortly before sunrise at that season.” Thename geomancer reflects the fact that such an adept draws his figures in thesand (or earth—Greek ge) and that he is a diviner (Greek mantis). Theconfiguration known as Fortuna maior is illustrated by Benvenuto and others asshown here:[../images/00011.jpeg]Whatever the precise nature of the practices of geomancers, it seems clear thatDante has not taken six lines to indicate that the time was shortly before dawnwithout purpose. Surely the unpleasant and unsavory connotations of coldness andof divination (we remember the treatment of diviners in Inferno XX) color ourreception of the dream that shortly follows. We should also remember that thisdream occurs on the terrace of Sloth, thus suggesting that it may reflectDante’s own former tardiness in seeking the good. Insofar as that afflictionalso encouraged his involvement in cupidity, the dream may also look back tosome sort of misdirected love. [return to English [part0012.html#c19-s2-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c19-s2-i]]7–9. [part0012.html#c19-s3-e] This second purgatorial dream is at least asdifficult to interpret as the first (see note to Purg. IX.19). For a brief andcogent review of classical, scriptural, patristic, and scholastic views of thenature of dreams see Armour (Armo.1990.1), pp. 13–16.Small seas of ink have been poured out in the quest for the source and meaningof this unpleasant woman. The far from convincing results previously obtainedprobably should warn anyone against advancing an opinion. On the other hand, itseems to some that the problem is easier to understand than are the attempts tosolve it. The poem itself, in the words of Virgil, tells us precisely who thestammering woman is: she represents the conjoined sins of excessive love,avarice, gluttony, lust—the sins of the flesh or, in the language of Dante’sfirst cantica, the sins of incontinence. (See Virgil’s words at vv. 58–59: “Yousaw … that ancient witch / who alone is purged with tears above us here.”)Dante’s dream, nonetheless, must surely also have specific meaning for him. Ifthe woman is the object of his affection, she must have particular reference tolust, since the poem nowhere offers any indication that Dante considered himselfever to have been avaricious (or prodigal, for that matter) or gluttonous. The“good that fails to make men happy” (Purg. XVII.133), in Dante’s case, must thennearly certainly be understood as involving wrongful sexual desire.Consideration of the femmina balba (stammering woman) has caused readers to seekout some fairly recondite sources. For a general analysis of this passage seeCervigni (Cerv.1986.1), pp. 123–35.What has rarely been noted in modern commentaries (but see Mattalia [1960] and,citing him, Giacalone [1968]) is the fact that balbus is the contrary of planus,the word that describes Beatrice’s speech in Inferno II.56 (see the note to Inf.II.56–57). Cf. the entry balbus in Lewis and Short’s Latin Dictionary, wherethis view is confirmed. [return to English [part0012.html#c19-s3-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c19-s3-i]]10–15. [part0012.html#c19-s4-e] The woman, we learn from the preceding tercet,stammers, is crooked in her glance as well as in her extremities, and sickly inher complexion. That is her natural condition. Dante, in the logic of the dream,redresses each of these sets of flaws, making her speech fluent, straighteningher limbs, and making her facial complexion the color that love desires to findin a woman (commentators debate whether this is red or white, but only since thetime of Tommaseo [the early commentators do not treat the question]); Tommaseo(1837) opts for the darker hue (purple, red); Bianchi, citing Vita nuovaXXXVI.1, where the “color of love” is the pallor Dante finds in the donnagentile, the woman who replaces dead Beatrice in his affections, chooses thelighter: white. While the commentators remain divided, opting for a shade ofred, a whiteness, or a combination of the two (all of which may be found in thelengthy tradition of the “colors of love,” at least from Ovid onward), thecontext of Vita nuova, which sponsors pallor as the “color of love,” supportsonly the second possibility. [return to English [part0012.html#c19-s4-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c19-s4-i]]16–18. [part0012.html#c19-s6-e] That Dante’s glance has transformed her mayfurther suggest that the song she sings is, in some sense, of his compositionalso, as was the tempting song sung by Casella (Purg. II.112), the secondcanzone included in Dante’s Convivio, addressed to the donna gentile (and not toBeatrice).For the view that the femmina balba reflects not only the potentially variousflesh-and-blood ladies of Dante’s sexual transgressions but also the donnagentile of Convivio, see Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 136–44, 162–63. It seemsmore likely that Dante here means to refer to the first and carnal lady for whomhe betrayed Beatrice, the lady of the last section of Vita nuova, the lady who,he later claimed, was only an allegory for the unchallengeably virtuous LadyPhilosophy. Thus the main thrust of his self-correction is aimed at the strayingrecorded in the earlier work; but, naturally enough, it would also hold incontempt that later allegorized lady as well, also presented as an “enemy” ofBeatrice in the first three treatises of Convivio. Both move the lover fromaffection for his true beloved in service of one far less worthy. [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c19-s6-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c19-s6-i]]20–21. [part0012.html#c19-s7-e] The phrasing that expresses the Siren’s powerover men may put us in mind of the condition of Dante in the opening verses ofthe poem, when he, nel mezzo del cammin, was off his course and resembled asailor who had nearly drowned. Does he now see himself as having been seduced bya “siren”? Insofar as the she-wolf represents the sins of Incontinence, andthus, for Dante, lust (see note to Inf. I.32–54), the essential reason for hishaving lost the true way would now seem to be predominantly related to hissexual affections. [return to English [part0012.html#c19-s7-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c19-s7-i]]22–24. [part0012.html#c19-s8-e] A tormented tercet: what does vago mean? towhom or what does it refer? who is the serena who claims so to have heldUlysses’ attention? As Barbi (Barb.1934.1), p. 228, maintained, in this poem theadjective vago always (it is used thirteen other times) means bramoso (desirousof) and is, as here, used with the genitive (cf. Purg. XXVIII.1). Thus, whilethe commentators are divided roughly evenly, with more early ones opting forvago as modifying cammin (and meaning “wandering, indirect”), and more modernones, beginning with Torraca (1905), believing that it modifies Ulysses (andmeans “eager”), one is more likely to be convinced, as was Mezzadroli(Mezz.1990.1), p. 29, that the context and Dante’s general practice allow us toresolve the first two questions as did Barbi (this woman drew Ulysses from thejourney he was so eager to pursue). But what of this “Siren” who so beguiledUlysses? Commentators have at times forgotten that Dante did not know Homer’saccount (Odyssey XII.39–200) of Ulysses’ escape from the Sirens’ seductivewiles. We should probably understand, following Moore (Moor.1896.1) that, fromCicero’s De finibus V.xviii.48–49, Dante decided that Ulysses had indeed beentempted by the Sirens. In any case, that is how he has the Siren portrayUlysses, and he offers no textual support for any other view. For that matter,in Beatrice’s later opinion, Dante himself is seen in exactly the same light, asyielding to the temptation of the Sirens when he withdrew his attention from herin order to fall under the spell of another lady or ladies (Purg. XXXI.43–48).[return to English [part0012.html#c19-s8-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c19-s8-i]]26–27. [part0012.html#c19-s9-e] Attempting to identify this lady, FedeleRomani (Roma.1902.1), pp. 15–18, one hundred years ago opted for Beatrice, buthas had few followers.Among more recent proponents of Beatrice’s candidacy see Poletto (1894), whoclearly prefers her as best fitting what happens in the poem, while ultimatelynot being quite certain, and Giacalone (1968), who offers the fullest and bestdefense of Beatrice as being the lady in question. [return to English[part0012.html#c19-s9-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c19-s9-i]]28–30. [part0012.html#c19-s10-e] If this is Beatrice, then it is hardlysurprising that she would recognize Virgil, in the dreamer’s estimation, sincehe knows from what he was told in Inferno II.53 that Beatrice came to Virgil inLimbo. And as for the identity of the lady here, characterized as being “onesta”(virtuous), it is probably worth remembering that Beatrice is later compared toa “donna onesta” (chaste lady) in Paradiso XXVII.31. [return to English[part0012.html#c19-s10-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c19-s10-i]]31–33. [part0012.html#c19-s11-e] What is the subject of the verb prendea(seized)? Some have argued that it is the holy lady. A sense of grammaticalstructure indicates, instead, that it is Virgil, subject of the previous verb(venìa [came forward]) that is in parallel with it. Further, if the lady indeedrepresents Beatrice, it would be highly unlikely that she would do the dirtywork herself. Just as she, in Inferno II, called on Virgil to make Dante awareof the foulness of the sins punished in hell, so now she stands to one sidewhile Virgil reveals the noxious nature of her rival, the femmina balba.The stench that arises from the naked belly of the femmina has, according toHollander (Holl.1983.3), pp. 84–86, a familiar source, not one that must besought in out-of-the-way medieval treatises, but in Virgil’s description of theHarpies in Aeneid III.216–218: “virginei volucrum vultus, foedissima ventris /proluvies, uncaeque manus, et pallida semper / ora fame” (maidenly ofcountenance, yet winged; most foul the discharge of their bellies; their handstaloned; their faces always pale with hunger). The particular similarity of thestinking bellies of Dante’s Siren and Virgil’s Harpies is surely striking. Afurther similarity lies in the purpose both creatures have in the works thatcontain them, which is to draw the hero away from his task, whether fromproceeding to Italy or from pursuing Beatrice to a destination in Christ. Inthis sense both are counselors of despair. In Dante’s case, it is his duty toconfess that he himself had created, out of what should have been repulsive,what he came to worship; out of a Harpy he had formed a Siren. Unlike Ulysses’Siren, Dante’s femme fatale is not even beautiful to begin with. It is no wonderthat she will be brought back into play in his worst moment of guilt in theentire poem when he is censured by Beatrice in Purgatorio XXXI.43–48, warninghim not to be lured by the “Sirens” ever again. [return to English[part0012.html#c19-s11-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c19-s11-i]]34–35. [part0012.html#c19-s12-e] In Dante’s “Surgi e vieni” (Arise and come),Mattalia (1960) seems to have been the first commentator (and few havesubsequently joined him) to hear what is clearly a biblical echo, even if hishearing is a little dull. He cites Matthew 9:5–6, where Jesus urges theparalyzed man to walk; perhaps more applicable is Matthew 26:36–46, where Jesusthree times leaves his disciples in Gethsemane in order to pray in a place apartand three times comes back to find them sleeping, finally arousing them with“Surgite, eamus” (Rise, let us be going), for His betrayal (by Judas) is athand. The rhythm of those three disheartening visits to those who should havebeen awake is preserved in Dante’s “Three times at least I’ve called you,” aswas suggested in 1969 by two undergraduate students at Princeton, John Adams andChristopher McElroy. Lost in his dream, Dante is like the disciples who sleepwhile their Lord suffers alone. [return to English [part0012.html#c19-s12-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c19-s12-i]]37–42. [part0012.html#c19-s13-e] Dante has slept late, unsurprisingly, givenhis late-night activities on the terrace of Sloth (Purg. XVIII.76–78), and nowfinds the sun, at his back, risen above the horizon.

[part0012.html#c19-s15-e] The Angel of Zeal’s words (“Come, here is thepassage”) may not be like any heard here on earth, but they do resemble thosespoken by Beatrice when she was described by Virgil as being “soave e piana”(gentle and clear) in her speech (Inf. II.56), as Poletto (1894) suggested.[return to English [part0012.html#c19-s15-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c19-s15-i]]49–51. [part0012.html#c19-s17-e] The nine verses devoted to the presence ofthe angel here represent the briefest scene yet devoted to the interplay betweenangel and mortal (but see note to Purg. XXII.1–6). The Beatitude referred to,Matthew 5:4 (5:5 in the Vulgate), “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shallbe comforted,” has caused some to wonder what specific relevance these wordshave to those formerly guilty of Sloth. Federigo Tollemache, “beatitudinievangeliche,” ED I (1970), p. 540b, explains that, given Thomas Aquinas’sdefinition (ST II.ii.35.2) of accidia as tristitia de spirituali bono (dejectionover one’s spiritual health), the phrase “qui lugent” (those who mourn) isrelevant. For the program of the Beatitudes in this cantica see the note toPurgatorio XII.110. [return to English [part0012.html#c19-s17-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c19-s17-i]]52–60. [part0012.html#c19-s18-e] The exchange clearly reflects that betweenVirgil and Dante in Purgatorio XV.120–126. Once again Virgil begins by askingDante “che hai?” (what’s wrong?), not at first understanding his charge’sremoval from present reality. Once again Dante insists on his other-mindedness.In the first instance Virgil quickly understood that Dante was having avisionary experience; now he becomes aware that Dante has been having a dream ofwhat his guide’s words had prepared him for, coming to grips with the “good thatfails to make men happy” (Purg. XVII.133).Virgil’s formulation causes a problem for those who would argue that the holylady is Beatrice, since it generalizes the nature of the lady who opposes thefemmina balba and makes Dante’s dream applicable to all sinners, no others ofwhom, we may assume, are lovers of Beatrice. For this reason Parenti’sunderstanding (Pare.1996.1), pp. 62–63 (resuscitating Torraca’s opinion [1905]),that the holy lady equates with Charity, seems the most adequate solution, goodlove that operates against the forces of “the good that fails to make men happy”(Purg. XVII.133). Charity may well be the general meaning of the lady in thedream; for Dante, however, that theological virtue is the core of the meaning ofBeatrice.

[part0012.html#c19-s21-e] Virgil’s metaphoric expression and the poet’sfollowing simile return to falconry (see note to Inf. XVII.127–136), now in ascentral an image of the basic movement of the entire poem as may be found.Mortals look down, consumed by their own concerns, while God, the falconer,wheels his lure (the celestial heavens) around his “head,” thus drawing us backto Him. Dante had been looking at the earth (verse 52) and Virgil urges him topush off against it in order to move on (verse 61); in the simile the falcon,too, looks down, perhaps to see if he is still bound to the falconer’s wrist nowthat his hood has been removed (or merely in his habitual attitude, his headinclined downward, resting on his breast). Both bird and Dante, urged on, lookup and travel upward, in Dante’s case by climbing through the passageway in therock so that he may resume his circling of the mountain on his approach to God.The image of the star-filled heavens as God’s lures for us, his falcons, iscentral to the progress of the poem that concludes each of its cantiche with theword stelle (stars).

[part0012.html#c19-s24-e] Dante’s arrival on the fifth terrace, that ofAvarice and Prodigality, is immediately greeted by the sight of those who arepurging themselves there, prostrate on the earth. This terrace is unique in thatit is a stage for three increasingly lengthy conversations, first with a pope(Adrian V) in this canto, with a kingly figure (Hugh Capet) in the next, andfinally with a poet (Statius) in XXI and XXII, a sample of callings thatreflects Dante’s most pressing concerns: Church, empire, and letters.

[part0012.html#c19-s25-e] The penitents’ cries, muffled because theylie facedown on the floor of the terrace and are uttering them through painfulsighs, are “my soul cleaves to the earth” (Psalm 118 [119]:25). The Ottimo(1333) connects this confessional outpouring with Virgil’s earlier remark toDante (“Press your heels / into the ground” [verse 61]), thus suggesting thatthe avaricious repent their longing for the things of the earth, exactly whatVirgil is urging Dante to do.

[part0012.html#c19-s26-e] The terms in which Virgil puts his requestmay remind us that his own condition in Limbo lacks precisely what thesepenitents enjoy: hope in the justice of God for eventual salvation. Virgil andthe other inhabitants of Limbo long for that justice, but without any possiblehope of achieving it (Inf. IV.42).

[part0012.html#c19-s27-e] As Singleton (1973) observes, this is the firsttime we learn that some penitents do not have to spend penitential time on everyterrace, since the nameless speaker (we will learn that he was a pope at verse99) assumes, from Virgil’s request for help, that both of these newcomers aresaved souls exempt from the sin of avarice (or of prodigality) who are ascendingto a destination higher up the mountain without having to stay here.

[part0012.html#c19-s31-e] Dante’s circumlocution, “that without whichthere is no return to God,” refers to the satisfaction each penitent must offerto God, showing that he or she is finally pure of the traces of the defiling sinpurged on each terrace.

[part0012.html#c19-s32-e] Dante’s three questions will be the basis forthis penitent’s speech, which will fill most of the rest of the canto, vv.97–126 and 142–145. He wants to know the identity of his interlocutor, thenature of the sin reflected in his prone posture, and, as is customary, whatservice he (as living soul) can perform back on earth for him.

[part0012.html#c19-s33-e] The speaker, in good papal Latin (“Know that Iwas a successor of Peter”), informs Dante that he was once a pope, notboastfully, but humbly and ashamedly, as though to say “I, of all people, whoshould have known better.” Benvenuto (1380) makes a similar point; it is asthough he said he was a successor of Peter “sed non pauper ut Petrus” (but not apoor man, as was Peter).

[part0012.html#c19-s34-e] Geographical indications (two towns on theLigurian coast and the stream taken by members of the Fieschi family for theirtitle: they are “counts of Lavagna”) leave no doubt as to the identity of thepope who speaks: “Adrian V (Ottobuono de’ Fieschi of Genoa), elected Pope atRome, in succession to Innocent V, July 11, 1276; died at Viterbo on Aug. 16following, before he had been crowned” (T); thus Dante’s “a month and littlemore” to indicate Adrian’s term of office. Longfellow (1867) reports thefollowing papal remark: “When his kindred came to congratulate him on hiselection, he said, ‘Would that ye came to a Cardinal in good health, and not toa dying Pope.’ ” [return to English [part0012.html#c19-s34-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c19-s34-i]]104.

At least here we understand what the papacy might be if thepope were an Adrian V. It is perhaps by design that the first saved pope whom wemeet in the poem (there will be more [see note to Inf. VII.38–39]) should bedistinguished by having died shortly after his election and thus without havingserved “officially” at all.

[part0012.html#c19-s36-e] Adrian’s remarks have caused a certainpuzzlement, since historical records give no sense of his involvement inavaricious behavior (nor, consequently, of his turning from that sin only oncehe was elected pope); as Scartazzini (1900) observed, such notice derives onlyfrom this passage in Dante’s poem and from his perhaps too gulliblecommentators. Bosco (Bosc.1942.1), pp. 136–43, followed by Sapegno (1955),argues that Dante thought that what he had read in John of Salisbury’sPolicraticus (VIII.xxiii.814) or, more likely, since Petrarch later also madethe same mistake, in some (unknown) later source that created this error, aboutthe twelfth-century pope Adrian IV, concerned instead his thirteenth-centurynamesake.

[part0012.html#c19-s43-e] Dante’s reverent kneeling before Adrian isapparent from his voice, which sounds louder because his face is now closer tothe recumbent pope’s body. The interruption in Adrian’s answers allows thislittle exchange that offers a lesson in fellowship that trumps Dante’s gestureof respect.

X.49–51). In the first cantica onlyFarinata, Cavalcante, and Brunetto have this honor bestowed upon them. Adrian,the fourth of seven to share the honor, will be joined only by Guinizzelli(Purg. XXVI.112) and Beatrice (first at Purg. XXXI.36) in this cantica, and thenby Cacciaguida (first at Par. XVI.10) in the next.

[part0012.html#c19-s45-e] Adrian’s response is so urgent that he onlygets to his fraternal salute, nearly always found, elsewhere in the poem, at thebeginning of direct address and never at its end, last. His “frate,” rhymingwith “dignitate,” is the answer to the hierarchy underlined by that second termand by Dante’s kneeling. In God’s kingdom there is no specialness, onlybrotherhood of the equally special. [return to English [part0012.html#c19-s45-e]/ Italian [part0019.html#c19-s45-i]]134–135. [part0012.html#c19-s45-e] From the time of Benvenuto (1380) it hasbeen understood that this scene clearly replays a similar scene in the Bible:Apocalypse 19:9–10, where the angel addresses John, commanding him to write ofthe blessedness of those who share the marriage supper of the Lamb. When Johnfalls before the feet of the angel to worship him, the angel says: “You must notdo that; I am your fellow-servant (conservus).” Dante’s hapax, conservo, surelycements the relationship between the two texts.

[part0012.html#c19-s46-e] The next biblical reference is to Matthew22:23–30, “neque nubent” (nor do they marry), a passage in which Christ dealswith the sardonic and hairsplitting Sadducees, who do not believe inresurrection and who wish, cynically, to know which of six brothers, who had inturn married an eldest brother’s widow, would be her resurrected husband. Jesusanswers them by saying that after the Resurrection there will be no marrying inHeaven, where all will share, one might add, in the marriage supper of the Lambas equals, where all are married to all and to none. Adrian’s insistence on thelack of hierarchical distinction is his version of Jesus’ saying. [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c19-s46-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c19-s46-i]]141.

[part0012.html#c19-s48-e] Answering the third element in Dante’squestion, regarding what Dante might do for him, Adrian can supply only the nameof a niece, Alagia, who might pray for him, thus suggesting that his avariciousformer life had much in the way of familial bad company among all the rest ofhis relatives.Alagia was married to Moroello Malaspina, with whom Dante was on friendly terms,and thus his good words about her probably reflect a positive impression gainedfrom personal knowledge and may also serve to express gratitude for theMalaspina family’s hospitality in Lunigiana in the early years of Dante’s exile.[return to English [part0012.html#c19-s48-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c19-s48-i]]PURGATORIO XX1–3. [part0012.html#c20-s1-e] The metaphoric sponge (his knowledge of thispope’s experience) will not be as thoroughly saturated as the protagonist wouldhave liked because he wishes no longer to distract Adrian, acceding instead tohis clear desire to return to his penance.

[part0012.html#c20-s2-e] Virgil and Dante move along close to the wall ofthe mountain, away from the shades of the penitents, so thickly strewn upon thisterrace but mainly near the outer edge. That avarice has affected an enormousnumber of souls was also clear from Inferno VII.25. And while Pride is oftenaccounted the “root sin,” another tradition gives Avarice that role. See Trucchi(1936) and Giacalone (1968), the latter citing the passage in I Timothy 6:10(“Radix omnium malorum est cupiditas” [avarice is the root of all evil]) thathelped form that tradition.

[part0012.html#c20-s4-e] Virgil addresses Plutus, standing over theavaricious in the fourth Circle of hell, as “maladetto lupo” (accursèd wolf—Inf.VII.8); the she-wolf (lupa) who blocks Dante’s upward path in Inferno I.49–54 iswidely understood to represent the sin of Avarice. Here there can be no doubt:the poet apostrophizes that sin as being the most widespread among mortals.[return to English [part0012.html#c20-s4-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c20-s4-i]]13–14. [part0012.html#c20-s5-e] The poet’s second apostrophe seeks aid fromabove in the hope of defeating the scourge of avarice. Mattalia (1960) seesthese astral influences as executors of the will of God. Woody (Wood.1977.1), p.122, puts a finer point upon this view, arguing that Dante is here referring tothe conjunction of the planets Saturn and Jupiter every twenty years. One suchhad occurred in Dante’s birth year, 1265, in the constellation of Gemini (andthus in the period of Dante’s birth); the next was scheduled for 1325, also inGemini.

[part0012.html#c20-s5-e] Even from the very beginning of the exegeticaltradition, commentators, e.g., the Anonymous Lombard (1322) and Jacopo dellaLana (1324), believe that this opaque question refers to the veltro (hound) inVirgil’s prophecy at Inferno I.101, thus from this vantage point lending thatpassage a decidedly imperial caste. It is striking to find so much unanimityhere, and so little there. However, if there the political figure was (as somebelieve) Cangrande della Scala, here it would seem to be an actual emperor,Henry VII, not merely a supporter of the Ghibelline position. Dante would havefelt that Henry’s advent was still in the offing, as it was until the autumn of1310, when the emperor announced his decision to come to Italy; or else, if thepassage was written in the spring of 1311, the poet, as in the view of Trucchi(1936), was urging Henry to do what he had up to now failed to do, despite hispresence in Italy: capture the city of Florence. In his seventh Epistle, Dante’sinitial enthusiasm for the imperial enterprise has been reduced to overexcitedand dubious hope. See notes to Purgatorio VI.97–102 and VII.95–96.These two apostrophes in the mouth of the poet (vv. 10–12 and 13–15) aresuggestively coupled; the first deprecates avarice while the second calls fordivine intervention in the form of an imperial presence. We have just met apope, who conquered the avarice that threatened to ruin him, but who, despitehis best intentions, left the papacy vulnerable to the depredations of the lupaof avarice; we are about to meet a just king (in Dante’s mind not in fact aking, but the father of a line of kings), whose France, in his wake, will doeverything it can to collaborate with the corrupt papacy in its struggle againstthe forces of imperial righteousness.

XVIII.99–138): here, a(temporarily) anonymous voice crying out the name and a single action of thosewho were noteworthy for their generosity of spirit. As usual, the first is Mary,here remembered for giving birth to the Son of God in a stable (Luke 2:7).[return to English [part0012.html#c20-s7-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c20-s7-i]]25–30.

During the invasion of Italy by Pyrrhus, King ofEpirus, he was sent to the latter to negotiate an exchange of prisoners. Pyrrhusused every effort to gain him over, but Fabricius refused all his offers. On alater occasion he sent back to Pyrrhus the traitor who had offered to poisonhim, after which he succeeded in arranging terms for the evacuation of Italy bythe former. He and his contemporary Curius Dentatus are lauded by Roman writersfor their frugality, and probity in refusing the bribes of the enemy” (T). Theprotagonist’s special pleasure in hearing of him reflects some of the poet’snearly constant enthusiasm for models of Roman republican virtue. (For theextraordinary importance of Roman republicanism to Dante see Davis[Davi.1984.1], pp. 224–89; and see Hollander and Rossi [Holl.1986.1], p. 75, forFabricius’s presence in four of the five collections of republican heroesoffered by Dante in Convivio, Commedia, and Monarchia.)

[part0012.html#c20-s11-e] Nicholas, whose gift-giving eventually madehim the patron of Christmas, was a bishop in Asia Minor in the reign ofConstantine in the fourth century. His renown for generosity is based upon hiskindness in offering dowries of gold for the three daughters of an impoverishednoble friend, who had been planning to sell them into prostitution in order tomaintain them and himself. In the first two examples, poverty was itself seen asa sort of nobility, preferred both by Mary and by Fabricius to worldly wealth.Here things are a bit different, as Nicholas allows his friend to escape frompoverty by arranging for his daughters’ dowries.

Why doyou alone cry out?”) are accompanied by a promise to repay the favor of repliesby procuring prayers for this penitent on earth. These three elements willstructure the rest of the canto, given over almost entirely to the words of thisas yet unnamed speaker.The protagonist’s last phrase, concerning the brevity of human life, ismemorably echoed near the conclusion of this cantica (Purg.

As a gentleman, he will respond to Dante only out of the goodness of hisheart because he can see that Dante lives in grace; at the same time, like thepope who spoke before him (Purg. XIX.142–145), this father of a line of kingsrealizes there are few or none below who honor his memory. As he converses withDante, we can observe that half of him lives in this new world of grace whilehalf of him remembers the world he left behind.

[part0012.html#c20-s15-e] As the ancestor of a line of kings of France,Hugh had a crucial role in ruling the land that now casts its desiccating shadowover the “garden of the empire” (Purg. VI.105). We can imagine that to Dante,exiled as a result of French intervention in the affairs of Florence incollaboration with Boniface VIII in 1302, these words have a particularly bitterring.

While the French did manage to hold on to some of the territory ofFlanders, their military defeat at Courtrai in July 1302 must have seemed toDante in some respects a punishment for what was done to Florence in the sameyear. Hugh’s words ring out as a prophetic hope to see his descendants justlypunished, but have a particular resonance for an Italian auditor. See Santelli(Sant.2001.1), pp. 21–23, for the political atmosphere of the Italy in whichDante was composing this very political canto.

[part0012.html#c20-s17-e] The speaker at last fully identifies himself asHugh Capet, who was in fact king of France (987–96), even if Dante did not knowhim as such. “The statements put by Dante into the mouth of Hugh Capet as to theorigin of the Capetian dynasty are in several respects at variance with thehistorical facts, and can only be explained on the supposition that Dante hasconfused Hugh Capet with his father, Hugh the Great,…The facts are as follows:Hugh the Great died in 956; Louis V, the last of the Carlovingians, died in 987,in which year Hugh Capet became king; on his death in 996, he was succeeded byhis son Robert, who had previously been crowned in 988 [to assure a Capetiancontinuity upon Hugh’s eventual death]. Dante makes Hugh Capet say: firstly,that he was the son of a butcher of Paris (verse 52), whereas common traditionassigned this origin not to Hugh Capet, but to his father, Hugh the Great;second, that when the Carlovingians came to an end he was so powerful that hewas able to make his son king (vv. 53–60), whereas on the failure of theCarlovingian line Hugh Capet himself became king (987); and third, that with hisson the Capetian line began (vv. 59–60), whereas in fact it began with himself”(T). Hugh’s control of the power over kingship is the alpha of which the rule ofPhilip the Fair, the French king as Dante was writing, is the omega.

[part0012.html#c20-s17-e] Bosco/Reggio (1979) offer a list of the tenkings who followed Hugh to the throne between 996 and 1314. Four of these indeedbore the name “Philip” and four, “Louis,” but it is the last in each of thesegroups who may be of greatest interest. Louis IX (1226–70) is one of the majorfigures of the Middle Ages, a great crusader, king, and saint. Of him Danteis—perhaps not surprisingly, given his hatred of France—resolutely silent; ofPhilip IV (the Fair—1285–1314), he is loquacity itself, vituperating him severaltimes in this canto, but also in a number of other passages (Inf. XIX.85–87;Purg. VII.109–110; XXXII.155–156; Par. XIX.118–120). [return to English[part0012.html#c20-s17-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c20-s17-i]]52.

[part0012.html#c20-s18-e] Again Dante is misled, perhaps confusingevents in the eighth century surrounding the last days of the Merovingian line,when Pippin the Short did put away his last possible political rival in amonastery. What Hugh had done was to have the last of the Carolingians, the Dukeof Lorraine, imprisoned in 991. He remained in prison until his death a yearlater. See Bosco/Reggio’s comment on verse 54.

[part0012.html#c20-s19-e] Hugh’s account of himself as kingmaker is,once again, not in accord with history (see Toynbee, above in the note to verse49): it was immediately after he himself was made king that he had his son,Robert, anointed as his successor. Thus his account of himself as father of thefirst of the line is an unwitting act of modesty, since he himself was the firstin it.

[part0012.html#c20-s21-e] Hugh offers a brief and allusiverecapitulation of four centuries of French expansionism, beginning with thecontinuing efforts to annex Provence, which avoided this fate until 1246, when amarriage between the brother of Louis IX, Charles of Anjou, was arranged withBeatrice, daughter of Raymond Berenger IV of Provence. And then, to make amendsfor this perfidy (per ammenda will be repeated, with increasing sarcasm, tocreate a triple identical rhyme, twice in the following tercet), Franceconsolidated its territories by annexing three other territories that had beenindependent.

[part0012.html#c20-s23-e] And now the really dreadful deeds begin: adescent into the Italian peninsula where a series of members of the French royalhouse named Charles are given employment by being sent into Italy: Charles ofAnjou, who is blamed for killing Conradin (the last hope of ItalianGhibellinism) at Tagliacozzo in 1268 (see Inf. XXVIII.17–18) and for poisoningThomas Aquinas in 1274 (a rumor that appears to have been made out of wholecloth as part of Italian anti-French propaganda, but which Dante seems only toowilling to propagate). Then Charles de Valois will take (we are once again inthe realm of post-factum prophecy) Florence in 1301 on behalf of an allianceamong the French, the papacy of Boniface, and the Black Guelphs of Corso Donati;it is not difficult to imagine Dante’s outrage at the intervention of thissecond Charles. Finally, the third of these wretched Frenchmen, Charles II, sonof Charles of Anjou and king of Naples, is brought onstage to suffer Dante’staunts, delivered by this French version of Dante’s ancestor Cacciaguida (seePar. XV–XVII), a benevolent ancestor of (in this case) an undeservingdescendant. This Charles is portrayed as—after having lost a calamitous navalbattle during the Sicilian Vespers in 1284 and, as a result, being held prisoneron his own ship—selling his daughter (there having been no intervention from St.Nicholas on his behalf, we may assume) into matrimony with Azzo VIII of Este in1305.

[part0012.html#c20-s29-e] And now the worst of all the French arrivesfor his excoriation, King Philip IV (see note to Purg. VII.103–111 and to vv.50–51, above). This king, who had been excommunicated by Boniface as a result oftheir dispute over the French king’s desire to tax the clergy, had his revenge.In September 1303, the king’s representative, William of Nogaret, accompanied byan Italian ally, Sciarra Colonna, a member of the family that Boniface, aided bythe advice of Guido da Montefeltro, had harmed (see Inf. XXVII.102), arrived inAnagni with a force of soldiers and, after physically assaulting the elderlypope, imprisoned him in his own palace, which they sacked. Boniface waseventually freed in a popular uprising against these intruders and made his wayto Rome. But the insult to his person, both physical and spiritual, wasapparently so great that he died on 12 October 1303. For a description inEnglish of the outrage done to Boniface see Carroll’s commentary (1904).Dante was no admirer of Boniface. The French attack upon the person of the pope,however, was an attack upon the holy office itself, and thus upon the MysticalBody of Christ, the Church. And thus Boniface is compared to Christ betrayed byPontius Pilate and crucified, while the agents of Philip become the two thievespresent at that event, but now represented as part of the torture administeredto their victim.For the possible dependence of Dante’s verses here on a poetic prayer to theVirgin composed by Boniface see Moore (Moor.1889.1), pp. 396–97; for the text ofthis poem see Artinian (Arti.1967.1). [return to English[part0012.html#c20-s29-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c20-s29-i]]91–93. [part0012.html#c20-s31-e] The “new Pilate” now directs his rage againstthe Templars. (For a more balanced view than Dante’s of Philip’s motives seeScott [Scot.1996.1), pp. 174–77.) “The Knights Templars were one of the threegreat military orders founded in Cent. xii for the defence of the Latin Kingdomof Jerusalem. After having existed as a powerful and wealthy order for nearlytwo centuries they were in 1307 accused by Philip the Fair of heresy, sacrilege,and other hideous offences, in consequence of which he ordered their arrest, andby means of diabolical tortures wrung from them confessions (for the most partundoubtedly false) of their alleged enormities. Five years later, at Philip’sinstigation, they were condemned by Clement V, and the order was suppressed bydecree of the Council of Vienne (May, 1312); in the following year the GrandMaster, Du Molay, was burned alive at Paris in the presence of the king. TheFrench king’s motive in aiming at the destruction of the Templars was, it canhardly be doubted, a desire to get possession of the immense wealth of theorder, as is implied by Dante, and stated in so many words by Villani (viii.92)”(T). When did Dante write this passage? Clearly sometime after 1307; and,perhaps nearly as clearly, before 1312. It is notable that none of the detailsof the denouement of this ugly scheme reached Dante’s page: sanza decreto(unsanctioned) the king sets out without the papal support necessary to justifysuch an action (it would come from that other detested Frenchman, Pope ClementV, only in 1312). [return to English [part0012.html#c20-s31-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c20-s31-i]]94–96. [part0012.html#c20-s32-e] Hugh’s second apostrophe parallels Dante’s(vv. 13–15) in hoping for divine vengeance to descend from above and smite theguilty, in this case most particularly Philip the Fair.There are questions as to whether the poet meant the reader to think of the“vengeance” as reflecting his defeats in Flanders in 1302 (see Singleton[1973]), or Philip’s death while hunting, when his horse was overturned by acharging boar, in 1314 (the opinion of John of Serravalle [1416]), or neither ofthese events. As Trucchi (1936) points out, Dante clearly refers with joy toPhilip’s death in November 1314 at Paradiso XIX.118–120. The notion that God’svengeance for the events at Anagni in 1303 occurred in Flanders in 1302 hardlyseems acceptable. Further, as Bosco/Reggio (1979) argue, since Dante does referto Philip’s death in the next cantica, it only makes sense to believe that hedid not yet know of it when he wrote this passage, for it would have been muchtoo tempting a piece of information not to include. In any case, the result isas Dante probably would have wanted anyway; here he predicts only that suchoutrageous behavior will receive God’s eventual vengeance—it is but a matter oftime. This seems the best understanding. The gleeful passage in Paradiso banksthe promissory note that Dante writes us here.At verse 35, Dante had inquired as to the speaker’s identity; it has taken Hughsixty-two lines to answer him by including the history of France’s decline as anarrative of a family’s woe, from his virtue to Philip’s savagery, in just overthree hundred years. Needless to say, for Dante, Hugh’s tale is still moreimportant as the record of what went wrong for Italy, drawing her from herRoman-imperial destiny toward her near death (see Purg. VII.94–96), because ofFrance’s malfeasance. [return to English [part0012.html#c20-s32-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c20-s32-i]]97–102. [part0012.html#c20-s33-e] To answer Dante’s second question, caused byhis sense that only one penitent seemed to be crying out the names of thegenerous, Hugh is equally contorted and long-winded, only clearing up Dante’smiscomprehension at vv. 118–123. When he uttered the name of Mary (verse 19) hedid what he and his companions do during the day, i.e., name the exemplars ofgenerous lives; at night they turn from names that serve as “goads” to thosethat serve as “bridles,” those of the avaricious.For Mary as “bride of the Holy Spirit,” Singleton (1973) cites Matthew 1:20:“For that which is begotten of her is of the Holy Spirit.” [return to English[part0012.html#c20-s33-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c20-s33-i]]103–117. [part0012.html#c20-s35-e] This is Dante’s most “crowded” group ofexemplary figures in Purgatorio, eight of them presented in fifteen lines. Onceagain he divides his cast into biblical and pagan personages, here not inparallel pairings (as in Purg. XII.25–60) but chiastically:[../images/00012.jpeg][return to English [part0012.html#c20-s35-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c20-s35-i]]103–105. [part0012.html#c20-s35-e] Virgil’s tale of Pygmalion’s avarice (Aen.I.340–364) is narrated by Venus to Aeneas. Pygmalion was king of Tyre andbrother of Dido, married to wealthy Sychaeus. Pygmalion secretly murderedSychaeus, whose shade then appeared to reveal everything in a dream to Dido, whoconsequently made off, with Sychaeus’s hidden stores of wealth, to her new lifein Carthage, thus depriving Pygmalion of the gold he sought.

In thefirst Bacchus allows Midas his famous “touch,” turning all to gold withdisastrous results once he realizes he can no longer eat nor drink, and has toask to have his gift withdrawn; in the second, Apollo metamorphoses Midas’s earsinto the enormous ears of an ass because Midas, alone among the listeners,insisted on his opinion that Pan’s piping was more beautiful than Apollo’splaying of his lyre. Dante refers to this scene in his second Eclogue (Egl.II.50–53). It is not clear whether Midas is laughable only for his foolishavarice or for his ass’s ears as well.

He had asuccessful political career, becoming triumvir with Caesar and Pompey in 60 B.C.(all three were reconfirmed in 56). In 55 he became proconsul in Syria. Trappedin an ambush by the warring Parthians, he was killed, and his severed head andone hand were sent back to the Parthian king, Orodes, who then had his mouthfilled with molten gold.

[part0012.html#c20-s43-e] The sudden shift in focus to Dante’sfearful condition in response to this earthquake opens an entirely new chapterin the narrative, a unique one. As Philip B. Miller observed in conversationmany years ago, Statius’s completion of penance is the only genuine event thatoccurs involving a damned or a saved soul in the entire Commedia. (Discussion ofStatius awaits the next canto.) All else in the poem that passes for narrativeaction pertains to demons or angels interacting with Dante, Virgil, or the soulswhom they help to punish or serve, to Dante’s own difficulties or successes inmoving on, or else represents some form of ritual performance by the souls inthe afterworld for the benefit of onlooking Dante. Dante, still a stranger onthis magic mountain, responds by feeling like a man in fear of death. We shortlylearn that he is witness to a moment of completion, of resurrection. It takes awhile for this to become clear. [return to English [part0012.html#c20-s43-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c20-s43-i]]130–132. [part0012.html#c20-s44-e] Benvenuto (1380) understands the simile ashaving the following meaning: “Just as that most renowned island, Delos, oncesent forth the two most famous luminaries into the sky [Apollo and Diana, thesun and the moon], so now this most renowned mount of Purgatory was sending intothe heavens two very famous poets, one ancient, i.e., Statius, and one modern,i.e., Dante. I speak not of Virgil, for he did not go to heaven.” The commentarytradition is, nonetheless, a seedbed of confusion for interpreters of theseverses. The following things are among those variously said: (1) Delos was madestable by Jove so that Latona, pursued by jealous Juno, could give birth inpeace; (2) before Latona gave birth, Delos suffered no such quaking; (3) theisland became stable only when Latona arrived to give birth on it; (4) Apollolater made the wandering island stable out of pietas (the version sponsored byAeneid III.73–77). Either the third or this last, partly because of itsVirgilian authority, seems the best to follow. The mountain’s wild quakingreminds the poet of the agitated condition of the floating island, whichwelcomed Latona for her parturition, before it was made fast, either by herarrival or, later, by Apollo.For passages in the Old Testament anticipating Dante’s supernatural earthquakesee Boyde (Boyd.1981.1), pp. 93–95.

[part0012.html#c20-s46-e] The passage in Luke 2:13–14 presentingangelic praise of God at the birth of Jesus (“Glory to God in the highest, andon earth peace among men of good will”) is cited first by Pietro di Dante(1340). By comparing himself and Virgil to the shepherds that first heard theangelic Gloria (Luke 3:15), Dante has underlined the connection between Jesusand Statius, which will be evident in the next canto as well. The birth of Jesusstands as a sign for the rebirth of this soul, who has finished his purgationand is prepared to ascend to the Father. All on the mountain apparently ceasetheir own penitential activity to celebrate the event in this song, and do sountil the quaking stops; we are led to imagine that this is true each time asoul arrives at this joyful moment of freedom from even the memory of sin, acondition that is formally completed with the passage through the waters ofLethe in the earthly paradise.

[part0013.html#c21-s1-e] From at least the time of Tommaseo (1837),commentators dealing with this opening verse have cited the opening (and otherpassages) of Dante’s Convivio (I.i.1): “As the Philosopher [Aristotle] says inthe beginning of the First Philosophy [Metaphysics I.i], all of humankindnaturally desires to know.” Bosco/Reggio (1979), however, make an importantdistinction. Since here the protagonist is presented with a miracle, the momentin which a soul is finally prepared to rise to God, the following reference (vv.2–3) to the waters of eternal life in the episode in John’s gospel “confirms thenotion that the natural desire for knowledge cannot be satisfied except byRevelation, thus going beyond the affirmations found in Convivio (I.i.1; I.i.9;III.xv.4) normally cited by the commentators, which are limited to philosophicalknowledge.” [return to English [part0013.html#c21-s1-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c21-s1-i]]2–3. [part0013.html#c21-s1-e] The obvious reference to the passage in John’sgospel (John 4:5–15) has not escaped many readers. The Samaritan woman who findsJesus, unprepared for the task of drawing water, at her well, ends up beingeager to taste the “water” that he offers as replacement for that which seems sonecessary at noon of a warm day in the desert, for it “fiet in eo fons aquaesalientis in vitam aeternam” ([italics added] shall become in him a fountain ofwater springing up into life everlasting). In the Vulgate the present participlesalientis may refer to the water or indeed to the drinker, rising up intoeternal life. It is worth keeping this potential grammatical ambiguity in mind,for that second reading applies precisely to the condition of Statius, who hasjust now come to that moment in his posthumous existence: he is ready to take onthe life of a soul in paradise; he himself is ready to salire (rise up). In mostinterpretations, the water that the Samaritan woman asks for is that of eternallife, which comes alone from the grace of God.As some commentators have pointed out, John’s word for the Samaritan is mulier(woman), while Dante has used a diminutive (femminetta). Giacalone (1968) thinksof the form more as a “commiserative” than as a “diminutive,” i.e., we are tothink of this woman’s absolute ordinariness as an encouragement to our own needfor exactly such satisfaction of our “thirst.” [return to English[part0013.html#c21-s1-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c21-s1-i]]4–6. [part0013.html#c21-s2-e] Dante has rarely portrayed his protagonist asbeing beset by so many distractions. He desperately wants to understand themeaning both of the earthquake and of the song accompanying it; he and Virgilare trying to move ahead as quickly as possible, picking their way among theclutter of the penitents; he continues to feel a sense of grief at theirpunishment, despite its obvious rightness.

[part0013.html#c21-s3-e] Announced with its solemn biblical stylisticflourish (Ed ecco [And lo]), the reminiscence of Luke 24:13–16 (a passage thatbegins “Et ecce”) reminds the reader of two of Christ’s disciples (Dante’s firstcommentators at times incorrectly identify them as James and John; it is clearthat one of the two is named Cleopas [24:18], while the other is perhaps hiswife [24:29], in which case she may well have been known as Mary [John 19:25]),walking on the road to Emmaus when Christ joined them and walked with them,unrecognized.

[part0013.html#c21-s4-e] Statius’s unmistakable resemblance to Christrisen, his figural relation to Jesus, makes him, technically, not a “figure” ofChrist but a “fulfillment” of Him, which is theologically awkward. Hollander(Holl.1969.1), pp. 67–70, argues for the technical reference of the word ombra(shade) here, grounded in the language of the Christian interpretation ofScripture, discovered, indeed, in this very chapter of Luke’s gospel (24:27),when Jesus teaches his disciples the figural method of understanding the OldTestament. (See the section on allegory in the introduction to Inferno. And seeHeilbronn [Heil.1977.1], p. 58, for a completely similar view.)Statius’s first words join him to the tradition of fraternal purgatorialgreeting on the part of the penitents we have so far heard addressing Dante:Belacqua (Purg. IV.127); Oderisi (Purg. XI.82); Sapia (Purg. XIII.94); Marco(Purg. XVI.65); Adrian (Purg. XIX.133). See notes to Purg. IV.127 and Purg.XIX.133.For the source of Statius’s greeting, see the words of Christ to his apostles,the second scene of his resurrected life on earth in Luke’s gospel (Luke 24:36):“Pax vobis: ego sum, nolite timere” (Peace unto you: I am, have no fear). In thenext verse of Luke the apostles indeed do show fear; and we may remember howfearful Dante was when the earth shook beneath him at the end of the last canto(vv. 128–129; 135).

[part0013.html#c21-s5-e] The nature of the cenno (sign) made inresponse by Virgil has long puzzled the commentators. We can say one thing withsomething like certainty: Virgil’s gesture is not a spoken one, since he makessome sort of gesture and then begins to speak (verse 16). Many early and somelater commentators have liked the idea that in response Virgil said “et cumspiritu tuo” (and with your spirit as well), a liturgical reply. Yet it surelyseems impossible that Dante would have first presented Virgil as speaking andthen immediately afterwards as beginning to speak. And so it is clearlypreferable to understand that Virgil made some sort of physical gesture. (Forclear examples of facial gestures as cenni in this very canto, see verse 104,Virgil’s look that calls for silence, and verse 109, Dante’s smile that is ahint.) [return to English [part0013.html#c21-s5-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c21-s5-i]]16–18. [part0013.html#c21-s6-e] Virgil’s wish for Statius is touching, in partbecause it has been accomplished, since Statius is already substantially one ofthe blessed, only awaiting a change in his accidental state, which will beaccomplished in less than a day. While the poem does not show him there, itsgivens make it plain that, had Dante chosen to do so, Statius could have beenobserved seated in the rose in Paradiso XXXII; he is there by the time Danteascends into the heavens at the beginning of the next cantica, or so we mayassume.Virgil’s insistence on his own eternal home is a moving reminder of his tragicsituation in this comic poem. Statius’s salvation comes closer than anyoneelse’s in showing how near Virgil himself came to eternal blessedness, as thenext canto will make clear. And, once we learn (Purg. XXII.67–73) that it wasVirgil who was responsible, by means of his fourth Eclogue, for the conversionof Statius, we consider these lines with a still more troubled heart.

The physical reason for it is that,because the travelers are out of the sun’s rays on the far side of the mountain,Dante’s body casts no revealing shadow, and Statius takes Virgil’s confession ofhis own plight to apply to both of these “shades.” [return to English[part0013.html#c21-s7-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c21-s7-i]]22–24. [part0013.html#c21-s8-e] Virgil’s remarks suggest to Statius that the(remaining three) P’s on Dante’s forehead indicate a special status, namely thathe is bound for Glory—just as is Statius. But did Statius have these marksincised on his forehead? Had he, they would now all be erased but for this last,which would probably disappear, along with Dante’s, before the beginning of thenext canto (see Purg. XXII.3, where we learn the angel has wiped Dante’s fifth Pfrom his brow). He would have spent, we will be able to compute from informationgleaned from verse 68 and from Purgatorio XXII.92–93, as many as 300 years inante-purgatory and/or on some or all of the first three terraces, since it is1,204 years since his death in the year 96 and he has had to remain over 400years on the fourth terrace and over 500 on this one. Thus, had he borne signson his forehead, these would originally have been as many as five and as few astwo. However, there is no reason to believe that he, or any other penitent nothere in the flesh, has had his brow incised with P’s. (See the note to Purg.IX.112.) For other reasons to believe that only Dante is incised, see Hollander(Holl.2002.1); for an opposing view see Fosca (Fosc.2002.2).

[part0013.html#c21-s9-e] The circumlocution describes Lachesis, thesecond of the three Fates of classical mythology. “At the birth of every mortal,Clotho, the spinning fate, was supposed to wind upon the distaff of Lachesis,the alotting fate, a certain amount of yarn; the duration of the life of theindividual being the length of time occupied in spinning the thread, which, whencomplete, was severed by Atropos, the inevitable fate” (T). For Atropos, seeInferno XXXIII.126. This is Virgil’s long-winded way of saying that Dante wasstill in the body when he was summoned to guide him through the afterworld. ForDante’s likely dependence upon Statius for the names of the three Fates seeEttore Paratore, “Stazio,” ED V (1976), pp. 422b–423a.

[part0013.html#c21-s11-e] What exactly Virgil means by his scola (teachingof Dante) has been a matter of some debate, featuring predictableallegorizations, e.g., Virgil as reason, Statius as moral philosophy, Beatriceas theology. None of these has the merit of being immediately (or eventually?)convincing. The last time we have heard the word was at Inferno IV.94, where thepoet referred to the group of poets (la bella scola) headed by Homer, andperhaps, “reading Dante by Dante,” we should keep this simplest explanation inclear view. Virgil, informed by all that a pagan poet can know, will guide Danteas best he can. Once we reach the question of the nature of the human soul, inCanto XXV, he will give way to Statius, who, as a Christian, understands thingsabout the nature of the human soul’s relationship to divinity of which Virgil issimply ignorant. There is no reason to believe, one might add, that Beatricecould not have instructed Dante about this question, or that Statius could nothave told him anything that Beatrice will reveal in Paradiso. All savedChristians, in this poem, are capable of knowing all things in God. The rewardsof Heaven are not only affective, but intellectual.We should also be aware of Beatrice’s use of the same word, scola, in PurgatorioXXXIII.85 to denigrate Dante’s own nearly disastrous adventures in what sheseems to consider his overbold philosophizing.

[part0013.html#c21-s14-e] Statius first establishes the meteorology ofthe mountain. There is no “weather” encountered above the upper limit ofante-purgatory, but below that limit there is. Up here the only celestial forcehaving any effect is the direct influence of the heavens.Thaumas’s daughter is Iris, for classical poets the personification of therainbow, appearing variously above the earth and not in one fixed place.The wind hidden inside the earth (verse 56, first referred to as “dry vapor” inverse 52) refers to what Dante, in keeping with one medieval view (see Inf.III.130–136), believed to be the cause of earthquakes. Statius’s point is thatthere are no natural earthquakes on the upper reaches of the mountain, but thatthere are “supernatural” ones. This one, accompanying the completion ofStatius’s penance and marking his liberation from sin, may remind us of theearthquake that greeted Dante’s “supernatural” descent into the underworld atthe conclusion of Inferno III, itself perhaps also meant to remind the reader ofthe earthquake at the Crucifixion (referred to at some length by Virgil in Inf.XII.31–45). These three earthquakes, all caused by Christ-centered spiritualevents, would clearly seem to be related. [return to English[part0013.html#c21-s14-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c21-s14-i]]61–66. [part0013.html#c21-s21-e] The self-judging quality of the penitents ishere made plain. We saw the same phenomenon among the damned in the confessionsthat they offered to Minos (see note to Inf. V.8).Words for “will” and “willing” occur five times in nine lines (61–69), thedensest block of volere and volontà found in the poem. In Paradiso III theexamples of Piccarda and Costanza will afford the opportunity to study thedivergence between the absolute will, always striving toward the good, and theconditional (i.e., “conditioned”) will, which, when guided by desires for lessergoods, chooses unwisely. Here Dante plays the changes on that basicunderstanding of the will’s role. In purgatory the conditional will does notelect the lesser good, but instead desires to repent its former movement in thatdirection. This is a “rule” of purgatory that has no precedent in Christianlore, since Dante’s purgatory is so much his own invention; nonetheless, itmakes intuitive sense. It is thus that the poet suggests that his readerunderstand why a penitent, while naturally desiring to cease the act of penance,simultaneously feels a still stronger and countering desire to complete it, asis made clear here.For a soul to “change its convent,” in this context, means for it to move frompurgatory to paradise.

[part0013.html#c21-s23-e] His use of the first person here is the firstinstance of an autobiographical bent on the speaker’s part, but hisself-identification still awaits. He only now formally concludes his response toDante’s insistent and paired questions, first alluded to in the last canto(XX.145–151); in a gesture typical of purgatorial brotherhood, his next thoughtis for his fellow penitents (cf. Virgil’s similar wish at vv. 16–18). (ForStatius’s various sins and the time spent purging them on the mountain, seenotes to vv. 22–24 and to Purg. XXII.92–93.)

[part0013.html#c21-s25-e] After telling us three times how eagerly hewanted to know more about these strange signs on the mountain (see note to vv.34–39), the poet now once again underlines their importance. The singularimportance of the salvation of Statius is insisted on in such a way as to let usunderstand that what matters is not only the importance of the finishing ofpurgation for any soul, but Statius’s astounding role in Dante’s poem, whichwill gradually become more clear as the two cantos devoted to him continue tounfold their mysteries.

[part0013.html#c21-s26-e] Tommaseo (1837) rightly suggests that congaudere(rejoice) is a biblical word; further precision was offered by Campi (1888),citing I Corinthians 12:26: “sive gloriatur unum membrum, congaudent omniamembra” (if a single member glories, then all members rejoice along with it).St. Paul is developing the analogy between parts of the human body and theindividual members of the Mystical Body of Christ, the Church.

[part0013.html#c21-s28-e] Publius Papinius Statius (45–96) was born inNaples and not in Toulouse, birthplace of a different Statius, a rhetorician;Dante’s error was a common one (perhaps deriving from the glosses by Lactantius[ca. 300] to the poems of Statius) and he helped propagate it, since he isprobably responsible for the mistaken birthplace found both in Boccaccio and inChaucer. Statius’s Thebaid, an epic in twelve books, composed in the yearsbetween between 80 and 92, was the source of a good deal of Dante’s sense ofwhat for us is the “Oedipus story,” in Statius seen as the civil war between theforces loyal to one or the other of Oedipus’s royal sons.Dante’s reference to Statius’s laureation is problematic. Since it seems clear,despite an occasional argument to the contrary, that Dante did not knowStatius’s collection of his “fugitive” poems, the Silvae (see the note to verse90), he could not have read (in Silvae III.v.28–31) that, while the emperor(Domitian) had crowned Statius with gold at an “arts festival” at Alba, he hadnot done so at Rome, i.e., Statius did not get the laurel for his epic. And thusit remains possible but seems unlikely that he ever received the laurel;however, his dedication of the Thebaid to Domitian, coupled with the openinglines of the Achilleid (I.9–11), where he asks Apollo for laureation andintimates that he had been previously coronated, might have made Dante think hehad been. This second epic, which he did not finish, getting only as far as intothe second book, was the source of most of what Dante, Homerless, knew aboutAchilles.

[part0013.html#c21-s28-e] Born around A.D. 45, Statius was thus abouttwenty-five when Titus, son of the emperor Vespasian, destroyed in A.D. 70 theSecond Temple in Jerusalem as part of his attack upon the Jews, an event towhich Dante will advert in Paradiso VI.92 (for Dante’s sense of the “justretribution” involved in this event, see the note to that passage). Titussucceeded Vespasian as emperor (79–81). [return to English[part0013.html#c21-s28-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c21-s28-i]]85–87. [part0013.html#c21-s29-e] The “name” to which the speaker refers isthat of poet. The surprising, even shocking, culmination of his statement of hisdebt to Virgil in the next canto (verse 73: “through you I was a poet, throughyou a Christian”) is adumbrated here, where Statius owns himself (at the age atwhich Dante suffered the loss of Beatrice, twenty-five) to have achieved fame asa poet but not yet faith in Christ.

[part0013.html#c21-s30-e] Dante had already referred to Statius as “lodolce poeta” (the sweet poet) at Convivio IV.xxv.6, as Tommaseo (1837) pointedout. Pietro di Dante (1340) was the first to suggest that the source for thephrase lay in Juvenal’s Satires (VII.82–87). For strong support of this notion,see Ronconi (Ronc.1965.1), pp. 568–69; see also Tandoi (Tand.1969.1). EttoreParatore, “Giovenale,” ED III (1971), pp. 197–202, offers probably the mostbalanced and useful introduction to the problem of Dante’s knowledge of Juvenal.[return to English [part0013.html#c21-s30-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c21-s30-i]]90. [part0013.html#c21-s30-e] There has been much confusion over the meaningof Statius’s reference to being crowned with myrtle leaves. The myrtle tree wassacred to Venus (see, e.g., Aen. V.72). And, indeed, Statius himself, in hisSilvae (IV.vii.10–11), asks to be crowned as a lyric poet (and not as a writerof epic) with myrtle leaves. However, as nearly all admit, or even insist, Dantecould not have been acquainted with the Silvae. Then what does Dante mean us tounderstand by Statius’s insistence that he was crowned with myrtle? As Daniello(1568) notes, Virgil speaks of both laurel and myrtle (Egl. II.54): “You, too, olaurels (lauri), I will pluck, and you, neighboring myrtle (myrte)”; Daniellobelieves that Statius is associated with myrtle because he was a poet of love.Disagreeing with him, Tommaseo (1837) thinks that the phrase, for Dante, meantthat the myrtle wreath was secondary to the laurel, an opinion followed byPorena (1946) and developed by Mattalia (1960), who argues that, while Dantehimself makes Statius one of the poete regolati (i.e., the classical Latin poetsworthy of emulation [Dve II.vi.7]), it is Statius who speaks now, and he wantsto show his awareness of his dependence upon Virgil, of his role as secondarypoet following in the wake of a master. See verses two lines from the ending ofthe Thebaid (XII.816–817), which explicitly make a highly similar claim: “do notattempt to rival the divine Aeneid, but follow at a distance, always worshipingits footsteps.” Moore (Moor.1896.1), p. 243, was perhaps the first to suggestthat this passage was being cited here in vv. 94–97. For its possible earlierrelevance, see the note to Inferno XXIII.145–148. [return to English[part0013.html#c21-s30-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c21-s30-i]]93.

[part0013.html#c21-s32-e] For the relationship of Statius’s text tothese lines, see the concluding remarks in the note to verse 90. The image ofthe Aeneid as being the divine torch that has set aflame many another poem,including this one, similarly “divine,” if surely in different ways, will beexplored as this scene unfolds.

[part0013.html#c21-s33-e] The appearance of the word mamma here isstunning, for we find it, a spectacular instantiation of the low vernacular (seethe last item in the note to Inf. XXXII.1–9, the passage in which it has had itsonly previous appearance), used in the same verse with the word that may haverepresented for Dante the height of classical eloquence, Eneïda, the title ofthe greatest classical poem, here in its only use in the Comedy.The passage applies to Statius, but increasingly students of this passage havebeen convinced that Statius’s fictive biography serves as a sort of stand-in forDante’s genuine one, that is, in Statius’s words here about his dependence onVirgil we are also reading Dante’s confession of his own debt to the Roman poet.For this view see, among others, Paratore (Para.1968.1), pp. 72–73; Padoan(Pado.1970.1), p. 354; Hollander (Holl.1980.2), pp. 123–24, 205n.; Stephany(Step.1983.1), p. 151; Picone (Pico.1993.2), p. 330.

[part0013.html#c21-s34-e] While some have understood that Statius’sgesture offers a single day of lingering (first, the Anonimus Lombardus [1322])and others a solar cycle of twenty-eight years (first, Jacopo della Lana[1324]), most, after the Ottimo (1333), believe that he means one more year.[return to English [part0013.html#c21-s34-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c21-s34-i]]103–114. [part0013.html#c21-s35-e] The first of these two adjacent andcharming passages to return to earlier moments in the canto adverts to thediscussion of the absolute and conditional wills in vv. 61–69. Here we see thatDante’s absolute will is conquered by his emotions. In the second, Dante’s smileis probably to be understood as exactly such a sign as Virgil gave to arrivingStatius at vv. 14–15.One does not want to read in too moralizing a light this extraordinary littlescene. There is no serious consequence if Dante gives away Virgil’s littlesecret, or if Statius becomes overenthusiastic once it is known. The three poetsshare a moment of common freedom from the constraints of their missions. It istypical of this great and securely serious theological poet that he can indulgehimself and his readers in moments of such moving happiness. This is perhaps asclose to experiencing Christian fellowship as Virgil ever comes. [return toEnglish [part0013.html#c21-s35-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c21-s35-i]]125–126. [part0013.html#c21-s42-e] The protagonist’s understanding ofStatius’s debt to Virgil is obviously not yet fully developed. In hisformulation it was from the greater poet that Statius learned “to sing of menand of the gods,” an adequate description of the work of a pagan writer of epic.We will learn in the next canto that, behind the façade of pagan trappings,Statius was in fact a secret Christian. See note to Purgatorio XXII.67–73.[return to English [part0013.html#c21-s42-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c21-s42-i]]130–136. [part0013.html#c21-s44-e] With regard to the supposed “failedembrace” between Statius and Virgil, Hollander has argued (Holl.1975.1), p.359,that Dante’s failed attempt to embrace Casella (Purg. II.76–81), pointing to aphysical impossibility, is countered in the successful exchange of embracesbetween Sordello and Virgil, both shades (Purg. VII.2, 15). In both of thosescenes there is a desire to embrace that is either frustrated or accomplished.Here Statius desires to embrace Virgil but, once advised against doing so by theauthor of the Aeneid, wills not to. Since we know from Sordello’s and Virgil’sshared embraces that in fact shades are capable of embracing, we may notproperly say, as most who deal with the scene do, that Virgil and Statius,“being shades, cannot embrace,” or that they “are not capable of embracing”(Cecchetti [Cecc.1990.2], p. 107). They are perfectly capable of embracing;Virgil convinces Statius that it is not a fitting gesture in this higher realm.For another view of the supposedly problematic program of embraces see Iliescu(Ilie.1971.1). And see the note to Purgatorio XIX.134–135 for the probablebiblical source of a similar scene: Pope Adrian’s refusal to accept Dante’sobeisance. In the end Statius won’t embrace Virgil because up here souls do notbehave “that way,” just as Virgil did not want to have his identity revealed fora similar reason.

[part0013.html#c22-s1-e] The scene with the angel, which we expect,having experienced such a scene at the end of the description of each terrace,is here done retrospectively and as briefly as possible. The giving ofdirections to the next terrace and the removal of Dante’s (fifth) P are referredto simply as having occurred. The remembered angelic recital of a Beatitude(here the fourth, Matthew 5:6, “Blessèd are they who hunger and thirst afterrighteousness [justice, iustitiam, in the Vulgate], for they shall be filled”)is given in truncated form. Responding to this economy, Benvenuto (1380) refersto Dante’s “novum modum scribendi” (new way of writing). What exactly wasomitted from the Beatitude has been a subject of discussion, but it clearlyseems to be “hunger and” (saved to be deployed, words more appropriate toGluttony, at Purg. XXIV.154) and perhaps the ending as well (“for they shall befilled”), possibly omitted in both utterances.It is as though the poet were clearing every inch of available space for thesecond scene with Statius, and indeed the arrival at the Terrace of Gluttonywill be postponed for over a hundred lines (until verse 115), the longest suchintermezzo we find among the seven terraces.From verse 3 it seems inferentially clear that Statius does not have what wouldhave been his final P removed. Dante describes his own letter being removed fromhis brow by the angel (“avendomi dal viso un colpo raso” [having erased anotherswordstroke from my brow]). Had he wanted to include Statius as having the sameexperience, he would only have to have written “avendoci” (from our brows).Thus, like all “regular” penitents, it seems most likely that Statius did nothave his brow adorned by the writing of the warder at the gate of purgatory.

[part0013.html#c22-s4-e] Dante’s charming fiction has it that Juvenal(for the reason behind the choice of him as praiser of Statius see the note toPurg. XXI.88), arriving in Limbo ca. A.D. 140, told Virgil of Statius’s greataffection, which then caused a similar affection in Virgil for the unknownStatius. Benvenuto (1380) offers a sweet-tempered gloss to this passage: “Oftenwe love a virtuous man, even if we have never met him—and in just this way do Ilove dead Dante.” [return to English [part0013.html#c22-s4-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c22-s4-i]]19–24. [part0013.html#c22-s7-e] Virgil wraps his delicate yet intrusivequestion in pledges of friendship, and then asks Statius how such as he couldhave been stained by the sin of avarice. The phrase “tra cotanto senno” (amidstsuch wisdom) recalls the identical words found at Inferno IV.102, and thusreminds us of the five classical poets encountered there by Dante. It may alsoremind us that Limbo is precisely where anybody else would have assumed Statiuswould spend eternity. [return to English [part0013.html#c22-s7-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c22-s7-i]]25–26. [part0013.html#c22-s9-e] As Benvenuto says, “Statius now smiles atVirgil’s mistake just as Dante had smiled, earlier [Purg. XXI.109], at Statius’smistake.” Statius is also obviously allowed to be pleased to have been guilty ofprodigality rather than avarice, no matter how seriously Dante took the lattersin.

[part0013.html#c22-s10-e] A paraphrase may help make clear the generalsense of these lines: “As my situation among the avaricious made you take me forone of them—and a better understanding shows the opposite sin to pertain, justso did your text seem to be condemning avarice—until my personal understandingrevealed that it condemned my own prodigality.” On the problem of thebelatedness of prodigality’s appearance as a subject on this terrace, of whichit is supposedly the cotitular occupant, see Barnes (Barn.1993.1), pp. 288–90.[return to English [part0013.html#c22-s10-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c22-s10-i]]36. [part0013.html#c22-s12-e] Statius has already said (Purg. XXI.68) that hehad to spend five hundred years and more on this terrace, thus more than sixthousand months. [return to English [part0013.html#c22-s12-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c22-s12-i]]38. [part0013.html#c22-s13-e] The verb used by Statius to indicate hiscomprehension of Virgil’s text will turn out to be pivotal, in that he does notsay “when I read” but “when I understood,” i.e., allowing us to comprehend hislatent meaning: “when I construed your text so that it matched my need.” [returnto English [part0013.html#c22-s13-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c22-s13-i]]40–41. [part0013.html#c22-s14-e] The meaning of these lines, clearly atranslation of a text of Virgil (Aen. III.56–57), is the subject of much debateinvolving questions about the exact nature of what Dante wrote (“Per che” or“perché”?) and what he took Virgil to mean (or decided to make Virgil say).Here, as always, we have followed Petrocchi’s text in our translation, eventhough in this case we are in particularly strenuous disagreement with him. Hereare the texts, Virgil’s first:Quid non mortalia pectora cogis,auri sacra fames?(to what do you not drive human hearts, impious hunger for gold?)As for Dante’s text, it may be either of the following:Per che non reggi tu, o sacra famede l’oro, l’appetito de’ mortali?(to what end, O cursèd hunger for gold, do you not govern [drive] the appetiteof mortals?)orPerché non reggi tu, o sacra famede l’oro, l’appetito de’ mortali?(why do you not govern mortal appetites, O holy [i.e., temperate] hunger forgold?)It is true that the Latin adjective sacer can mean either “holy, sacred” or“unholy, impious.” However, the meaning of Aeneas’s outcry, recounting thehorrific deed committed by Polymnestor against Polydorus (see note to Inf.XIII.31–39) is clear to all; he means “impious.” But what of Dante’s text? The“traditional” reading has him maintaining the negative valence of Virgil’s sacer(which would then be the only occurrence among twelve in which sacro does notmean “holy” in his poem). Perhaps no early reader, among those who understoodStatius as deliberately misreading Virgil, was as “modern” and “revisionist” asFrancesco da Buti (1385), who simply argued that Dante was deliberately givingVirgil’s text another meaning than it held because it suited his purpose to doso. Bianchi (1868) is the first to appreciate the absurdity of the notion thatDante had used the verb reggere (to govern) in a pejorative sense. The debatecontinues into our own day, mainly propelled by the notion that Dante could notpossibly have misunderstood Virgil’s words and therefore did not grosslymisrepresent them. This, however, is to overlook the fact that it is thecharacter Statius who is understanding them as they took on significance forhim, guilty of prodigality, not of avarice. And just as he will later reveal his“misinterpretation” of Virgil’s fourth Eclogue at vv. 70–72, a “misreading” thatsaved his soul, so now he shows how his moral rehabilitation was begun when he“misread” a passage in the Aeneid. The debate is finally in such condition thatthis view, present in some of the earliest commentators but energeticallyattacked over the centuries, now may seem only sensible. See, among others,Ronconi (Ronc.1958.1), pp. 85–86; Groppi (Grop.1962.1), pp. 163–68; Paratore(Para.1968.1), pp. 73–75; Hollander (Holl.1980.1), pp. 212–13, and(Holl.1983.1), pp. 86–89, completely in accord with Shoaf’s earlier and nearlyidentical reading (Shoa.1978.1). They are joined by Barolini (Baro.1984.1), p.260, and, at length, by Martinez (Mart.1989.2). A similar, if less developedargument, is found in Mazzotta (Mazz.1979.1), p. 222. And, for wholeheartedacceptance of Shoaf’s argument, see Picone (Pico.1993.2), pp. 325–26. Neglected,by all but Barolini and Shoaf, is Austin (Aust.1933.1). Mainly forgotten as wellis the then daring support of Francesco da Buti by Alfredo Galletti(Gall.1909.1), pp. 17–18. Among Italian students of the problem who accept thisbasic view of its resolution see Chiamenti (Chia.1995.1), pp. 131–37, who offersmost of the essential bibliography for the problem but is, however, surprisinglyunaware of the support for his position available in his American precursors’analyses of what he considers “the most beautiful example of free translation inDante” (p. 134). For the general question of Dante’s Statius see Brugnoli(Brug.1969.1) and Rossi (Ross.1993.1); for more recent bibliography see Glenn(Glen.1999.1), p. 114, and Marchesi (Marc.2002.1), an extended discussion of thepossible Augustinian sources of the “aggressive” reading of Virgilian textattributed to Statius by Dante.

One should be aware that the notion that itrefers to all of purgatory (rather than to this terrace alone) is of recentvintage and is intelligently opposed by Bosco/Reggio (1979). Further, if oneexamines all eighteen uses of the adverb by penitents who have speaking roles onthe mountain, it is plain that only twice does it not refer to the particularterrace on which the speaker is found. In short, there is every reason tobelieve that the reference is only to this particular terrace, the only one onwhich a particular sin and its opposite are purged.

[part0013.html#c22-s18-e] We can begin to understand that Dante hasconstructed this terrace in a way that is much different from that in which hestructured the Circle of Avarice and Prodigality in Inferno. There the two sinsare treated, at least approximately, as equals, each of them sharing literallyhalf the realm. Here it would seem (one cannot be certain) that there is no setplace for the penitent prodigal nor any exemplary figures that refer directly totheir sin. In fact, this is the terrace of Avarice on which prodigals seem to begathered, too. Since the only one we know of—and he refers to no others in hiscondition—is Statius, we have no way of knowing or guessing how many othersthere are like him, or even whether there are any others at all, although, fromvv. 49–51, there seem to be.

[part0013.html#c22-s19-e] Virgil is referred to as the author of theEclogues, the fourth of which will shortly come into prominent play in Statius’snarrative of his conversion (vv. 70–73). His question reveals that Dante treatshim as having read—and with some care—Statius’s Thebaid, a work written roughlyone hundred and ten years after his death. (We have observed a similar bit ofbusiness in Inf. XXXI.115–124, where Virgil borrows from the texts of Lucan ashe attempts to flatter Antaeus [see Hollander (Holl.2000.2)].) Do we imagine, asmore than one discussant has, that Virgil had read Lucan (or Statius) in Limbo?Or do we realize that Dante is a poet and takes liberties when he wishes to?[return to English [part0013.html#c22-s19-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c22-s19-i]]55–56. [part0013.html#c22-s19-e] The sons of Jocasta (by her son Oedipus) areEteocles and Polynices.

Virgil’s question suggests that the textof the epic, while historically valid, does not seem to him to yield any hint ofStatius’s Christian faith. But see the note to vv. 64–73.Lombardi (1791) was perhaps the first commentator to suggest the (debated butviable) idea that tastare here means “pluck the strings of the lyre” inaccompaniment of the poet’s song.

[part0013.html#c22-s21-e] Virgil would like to know what sun (God?) orwhat candles (human sources of enlightenment?) enlightened Statius, removing himfrom the darkness of paganism in Domitian’s Rome so that he could “set sail,”following the Church’s instruction. St. Peter, the rock on which Jesus builtthat church, is portrayed as a “fisher of souls” in Mark 1:17.The Castalian spring, source of poetic inspiration in classical myth, had itsown source among the caves of Mt. Parnassus. [return to English[part0013.html#c22-s21-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c22-s21-i]]64–73. [part0013.html#c22-s22-e] Statius’s response surprises Virgil andcontinues to surprise nearly everyone. It was Virgil whose example made him wantto be a poet and Virgil who brought him to love the true God. The culminatingverse of his answer begins by restating the first part of the equation, to whichno one can object, and then the second (“per te cristiano”). There is noexternal authority, competent or otherwise, who would have brought Dante tobelieve such a thing.However, if Dante believed, or had decided to believe, that Statius was aChristian, when did he think he first converted? Virgil’s own remark about hisnot finding any evidence in the text of the Thebaid that supports a Statianconversion to Christianity is perhaps a clue to what we should do in examiningthat text. That is, the “dating” of such a conversion might have seemedascertainable from Statius’s texts themselves. Mariotti (Mari.1975.1) discussedPoliziano’s view that a passage in the Thebaid (IV.514–518, naming themysterious “high lord of the triple world” [Demogorgon?]) seemed to authorizeunderstanding of a Christian intent on the part of its author. Mariotti’sargument did not convince Hollander (Holl.1980.2), pp. 206–7, who argued insteadthat a passage early on in the work (Thebaid II.358–362) revealed, unmistakably,a reference to the key prophetic text in Virgil’s fourth Eclogue. (He might haveargued that there is an even more precise reference at V.461, the phrase “iamnova progenies” [and now a new race] that matches exactly Virgil’s key phrase inthe Eclogue [IV.7].) Thus, if for Dante the phrase in Virgil that convertedStatius is that one, it only makes sense that, finding it in the text ofStatius’s epic, he could argue that, by the time he was writing its second book,Statius was already a closet Christian. For a discussion see also Chiamenti(Chia.1995.1), pp. 205–8.On the continuing complexity of the problem of Statius’s supposed Christianitysee, among many others, Brugnoli (Brug.1988.1), Scrivano (Scri.1992.1), and Heil(Heil.2001.1), pp. 52–101. For the narrower discussion of the dependence ofDante’s view on putative existing medieval sources for such a belief, see Padoan(Pado.1959.1), Ronconi’s rejoinder (Ronc.1965.1), and Padoan’s continuinginsistence (Pado.1970.1). It seems clear that Ronconi’s view, that theconversion of Statius is entirely Dante’s invention, is the only likely solutionto an intriguing problem.

[part0013.html#c22-s24-e] Dante’s translation of the crucial lines ofthe fourth Eclogue (5–7) deforms them just enough to show how a Christian mighthave found a better meaning in them than did Virgil himself:magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo. iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturniaregna; iam nova progenies caelo demittetur alto.(The great line of the centuries begins anew; now the Virgin returns, the reignof Saturn returns; now new progeny descends from heaven on high.)From Monarchia I.xi.1 we know that Dante believed that Virgil’s Virgo was not awoman named Mary but Astraea, or Justice. Still, primal justice was thecondition of humankind in the prelapsarian Eden, that “first age of man” (primotempo umano), which is open to a wider interpretation than Virgil’s “Saturniaregna.” Statius’s version of Virgil had to rearrange very little (and that seemsto be Dante’s hard-edged intention) to make the prophecy a Christian one.Dante’s identical rhymes (ri-nova, ciel nova) add a repeated word that has adeeply Christian ring to it, “new,” thus pointing to the concept that almostemerges from Virgil’s text. He came very close, but he failed. [return toEnglish [part0013.html#c22-s24-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c22-s24-i]]74–75 [part0013.html#c22-s25-e]. The phrasing is self-conscious in the extreme.Dante, having invented a Christian Statius, now hints that it is a fabricationof his own by putting the language of portraiture (and not of history) into themouth of his creation. See Hollander (Holl.1980.2), p. 206. [return to English[part0013.html#c22-s25-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c22-s25-i]]76–81. [part0013.html#c22-s26-e] Soon Virgil’s words seemed so to confirm themessage of the preachers who followed Christ’s apostles that Statius began tofrequent these Christians.

Thus Dante, believing that Domitian persecuted Christians and thatStatius was a Christian, had to resolve that problem by imagining a conversionthat only bloomed after he had begun writing the Thebaid. “Domitian (TitusFlavius Domitianus Augustus), Roman Emperor, younger son of Vespasian andsuccessor of his brother, Titus; he was born at Rome A.D. 51, became Emperor in81, and was murdered in 96. Among the many crimes traditionally imputed to himwas a relentless persecution of the Christians, which is mentioned by Orosius(Hist. VII.x.1), who was doubtless Dante’s authority” (T). Orosius, however,puts this persecution late in Domitian’s reign, while Dante would seem to havebelieved that it occurred earlier, i.e., at the very least before Statius hadreached the seventh book of his epic. While later historians question either theseverity or the very existence of Domitian’s persecution of Christians (and Jews[see the Ottimo (1333)]), Dante’s early commentators, who may reflect traditionsknown also to him, insist that Domitian was only the second emperor (after Nero)to persecute Christians. The Anonimo Fiorentino (1400) states that Domitian’spersecutions began in the fourth year of his reign (81–96) and that in 89, whenthey reached their height, they had made martyrs of such notable Christians asSt. Clement. If Dante was aware of the traditional timetable for the compositionof the Thebaid, 80–92, his life of Statius, supplied in these verses, wouldmatch well with those particulars.

IV.35), was precisely what Virgil and hisfellow pagans in Limbo lacked. Statius indicates that by the time he was writingthe seventh book of his epic, when the exiled Theban forces, returning, preparedtheir assault on the city, he had been baptized.

[part0013.html#c22-s30-e] Dante’s secret-Christian topos has its roots inJohn’s gospel (John 19:38–39) in the figures of Joseph of Arimathea (Singleton[1973]) and Nicodemus (Benvenuto [1380]), both of whom come only secretly toChrist’s tomb.

[part0013.html#c22-s31-e] Statius’s four hundred years and more on theterrace of Sloth are the fitting result of his tardiness in making an opendeclaration of the faith to which he had, mirabile dictu, been led by Virgil’sEclogue. For slothful behavior as being slowness to love correctly seePurgatorio XVII.130 and XVIII.8, and see Carroll’s remarks, quoted in the noteto Purgatorio XVIII.103.

[part0013.html#c22-s32-e] Statius’s remark inevitably reminds Virgilthat, even though he is surely the greater poet, he has lost the most importantcontest in life. Modesto (Mode.1995.1), p.11, compares his role to that ofBrunetto in Inferno XV.123–124, who seems to be a winner but who has, in fact,lost everything.

[part0013.html#c22-s33-e] Virgil now adds nine classical poets to thenamed population of Limbo (five poets and thirty-five others). Added to the“school” of Homer (“that Greek / the Muses suckled more than any other”) arefive Latins: Terence, Caecilius Statius (of whom no texts survive), and Plautus(all wrote in the second century B.C.); Dante’s knowledge of their works wasmainly nonexistent, with the barely possible exception of Terence (see notes toInf. IV.88–90 and XVIII.133–135); Varro is either Publius Terentius Varro orLucius Varius Rufus, both Roman poets of the first century B.C. Dante’s sourcefor these names is debated, with Horace (Ars poetica 54–55) the leadingcandidate. On the three Latin comic poets see Bara´nski (Bara.1993.1), who alsosuggests (p. 233) that Varro is associated with tragedy and Persius with satire,thus rounding out the three major Latin styles.The names of the four Greeks whom Virgil goes on to mention, derived from thewritings of Aristotle, St. Thomas, and perhaps still others, were nearly allthat Dante knew of them, three tragedians of the fifth century B.C., Euripides,Antiphon, and Agathon, and one lyric poet, Simonides.Their conversation, Virgil reports, is of Mt. Parnassus, home of the Muses, themountain that Statius (verse 65) says Virgil first led him toward in making himdesire to be a poet. They and Virgil learn too late about this better Christianmountain. [return to English [part0013.html#c22-s33-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c22-s33-i]]109–114. [part0013.html#c22-s37-e] Virgil adds eight more souls to Limbo, nownot those of poets, but of virtuous women. All of them are to be found inStatius’s two epics (the last two in the Achilleid) and all are also to beunderstood, as they were by Giovanni Boccaccio, as exemplifying filial piety(see Hollander [Holl.1983.1], pp. 208–12). “She that revealed Langia” isHypsipyle (see Inf. XVIII.92 and Purg. XXVI.95). “La figlia di Tiresia” is,almost all now agree, Manto, thus causing a terrible problem for Dante’sinterpreters, the sole “bilocation” in his poem (for her first appearance seeInf. XX.52–102). Did he, like Homer, “nod”? Are we faced with an error oftranscription? Or did he intentionally refer here to Statius’s Manto, whileVirgil’s identical character is put in hell? For the second view, see the workof Kay and Hollander referred to in the note to Inferno XX.52–56. [return toEnglish [part0013.html#c22-s37-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c22-s37-i]]118–120.

[part0013.html#c22-s41-e] Virgil’s remark reveals how much he (andwe) are taken by the story of Statius, so much so that the continued penitentialcircling seems almost an afterthought.

[part0013.html#c22-s43-e] The two poets (poeti, vv. 115, 139) arespeaking of making poetry (poetar) while Dante listens; it is a scenereminiscent of that in Inferno IV.103–105, on which occasion Dante does morethan only listen to the discussion.

[part0013.html#c22-s44-e] Many early commentators believed that thistree is upside down, with its roots in the air and its tip in or on the ground.It seems better to understand that its “branches” bend downward (rather thanreaching upward, as do those of earthly trees) and are longer the higher theyare found on the trunk, so as to prevent anyone from climbing. However thatmatter may be resolved (and the text would seem to support this second view, asScartazzini [1900] argues), it seems clear that this tree is portrayed as beinga shoot from the Tree of Life (Genesis 2:9). While a good deal of debatesurrounds this point, strong arguments for this identification are found inScartazzini (1900).

[part0013.html#c22-s46-e] This tree is nourished from above, throughits leaves, not from below, through its root system. Since it is an evergreen,and indeed a mystical representation of a supernatural tree, it does not requirenourishment at all. The water that moistens its branches may thus be symbolic ofthe water of Life that came to fulfill the function of the Tree of Life inJesus, who restored to humankind the immortality lost in Eden.

[part0013.html#c22-s47-e] Like the tree, the voice from within it ismysterious as well; it would rather seem to be the “voice” of the tree itselfthan anything else. What the voice says at first may seem to be a version ofGod’s prohibition of the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil toAdam (Genesis 2:17, a passage Mattalia [1960] believes is repeated at Purg.XXIV.115—but see the note to that passage). However, it seems far more likelythat this voice speaks of the result of Original Sin, humankind’s loss ofeternal life, symbolized here in the unavailability of the fruit (described inverse 132) of this tree, the Tree of Life.

[part0013.html#c22-s48-e] Mary is presented as wanting to be sureothers are fed properly at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee (the samebiblical scene [John 2:1–7] that furnished, in Purg.

[part0013.html#c22-s49-e] Roman matrons of the old days, probably inDante’s mind those associated with republican Rome, before the excesses thatcharacterized the reign of the Caesars, are paired with Daniel who, in Daniel1:8, is presented as being uninterested in the food of the king’s table or inwine. This is the first time that Dante uses a group as exemplary, a choice thathe will make again in the next pairing.

Once again a classical group is paired with aHebrew individual, John the Baptist, similarly temperate. Shoaf (Shoa.1978.1),p. 197, refers to “the hunger of Temperance” in another context, but the phraseis apt here.It is possible that Daniello (1568) was the first to cite, in support of John’s“greatness,” the apt passage in Matthew 11:11 (some others will later also citethe nearly identical one in Luke 7:28): “Among those who are born of women thereis not a greater prophet than John the Baptist.” It is striking that nocommentator gathered in the DDP who cites this passage ever goes on to cite itsconcluding sentence, which fits the context here so very well, where Virgil hasserved as prophet of Christ for Statius but not for himself (for Virgil’s rolein the poem as reflecting that of John the Baptist, see the note to Inf. I.122):“But he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” [return toEnglish [part0013.html#c22-s50-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c22-s50-i]]PURGATORIO XXIII3.

[part0013.html#c23-s2-e] The phrase that would make Virgil “more thanfather” to Dante, according to the early commentators, praises his instructionof Dante in virtue, here redirecting his attention to the immediate task (andback from mere curiosity, in Carroll’s view [1904]). It may also reflect theRoman poet’s extraordinary ability to bring a pagan—and perhaps even thisbacksliding Christian—to Christ, as Statius’s narrative has established (and seePurg. XXX.51, Dante’s ultimate gesture of farewell to his “father”: “Virgil, towhom I gave myself for my salvation”). [return to English[part0013.html#c23-s2-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c23-s2-i]]5–6. [part0013.html#c23-s2-e] Virgil has broken off his conversation withStatius in order to address Dante (with an Italian version of the Latin vocativecase: “figliuole,” verse 4). As Singleton (1973) points out, all three of thesimilar warnings on the part of the protagonist’s guide that the journey must becompleted within a definite period occur in the “next-to-last circle of each ofthe three realms” (see also Inf.

[part0013.html#c23-s3-e] Dante does not find that having to resume hisdifficult task is unpleasant for a single reason: because the subject underdiscussion is poetry (see Purg. XXII. 127–129).

[part0013.html#c23-s4-e] “O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shallproclaim your praise.” The song of the penitents in Gluttony derives from thedefining moment of David’s repentance, not for gluttonous behavior, but for lust(Psalm 50:17). For the admixture of delight and grief typical of expressions ofpenitence on this terrace, see Trone (Tron. 1995. 1).Beginning with Jacopo della Lana (1324), commentators have noted that this verseof the Psalm corrects the former sins of those who were gluttons because of itsinsistence on this better use of mouths—in songs of praise—than on the pleasuresof the table. See the clear formulation of this idea in the presentation of Maryas exemplar of Temperance in the previous canto (Purg. XXII. 142–144).

On the previous terrace theyhad become accustomed to looking upon stationary souls, prostrate on the groundbefore them. Here, as on the terraces of Pride, Wrath, and Sloth (and Lust,still ahead of them), the penitents are in motion. (Only in Envy and Avarice arethey not.)

[part0013.html#c23-s9-e] The first reference is to Ovid’s narrativeconcerning Erysichthon, who, having cut down trees in a sacred grove, was drivenby its offended deity, Ceres, into boundless appetite that only ended when heengorged his own flesh (Metam. VIII. 738–878). The second, as was noted byseveral of the early commentators, is to an incident recorded in the sixth bookof Josephus’s De bello judaico (Concerning the Jewish War) in which a youngwoman named Mary, during the general starvation brought about by Titus’s siegeof Jerusalem in A.D. 70, killed, cooked, and ate her infant son. It isnoteworthy that the poet explicitly adds exemplars to those “found” on the seventerraces. [return to English [part0013.html#c23-s9-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c23-s9-i]]32–33. [part0013.html#c23-s11-e] In the faces of the penitents, hollow-eyed,pale, skeletal, an observer might read only the “m,” formed by the combinationof cheekbones, eyebrows, and nose, but not the “o”s of the eyes, shrunken fromview. Longfellow (1867), Scartazzini (1900), and others present a passage fromone Berthold, a Franciscan of Regensburg (Germany), which describes the“letters” found in human faces, first the “omo” (latin homo) that is man’s nameand then the “dei” (Latin genitive of deus, “of God”); our faces announce thateach of us is a “man of God.” For the text of his remarks in English see thecommentary of Longfellow or of Singleton to this passage.

[part0013.html#c23-s12-e] For the fruit of the tree and the waterflowing over its leaves that cause such appetite, see Purgatorio XXII.137–138;and see the later reference in this canto (vv. 62–63). That this desire is goodbut not yet realizable would seem again to point to the notion that this tree isdescended from the Tree of Life. See note to Purgatorio XXII.130–135.

[part0013.html#c23-s14-e] The penitent’s quick and gentle recognitionof Dante, whose visage is in its normal human condition, plays off the gradualrecognition on the part of the protagonist of his interlocutor. This is his oldfriend, Forese Donati. He was the brother of two other personages referred to inhis remarks: Piccarda (encountered by Dante in the heaven of the Moon in Par.III), praised generously (Purg. XXIV.13–15), and Corso, denounced savagely(Purg. XXIV.82–87). The interplay between these fellow Florentines develops asone of the most tender scenes in the entire poem.It is perhaps worth noting that the words that Forese and the others have beensinging (verse 11) happen to come from the very fiftieth Psalm that opens withwhat serves as the protagonist’s first spoken word in the Comedy, Miserere (Inf.I.65). The stories of Forese and of Dante are certainly meant to show God’sgreat mercy. [return to English [part0013.html#c23-s14-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c23-s14-i]]61–71. [part0013.html#c23-s21-e] Forese begins by glossing for us the meaningof the tree and water encountered on the previous terrace. Both of these areinformed by divine power with the promise of eternal life—object of the truehunger of these penitents. As the expiation of their former gluttony leads tothis better hunger, they have their pangs renewed at another tree as well. Manycommentators have believed that the text here invites us to believe that thereis a multitude of trees stationed along the rest of the terrace, an idea thatprobably must be discarded because we will in fact find only one more (in thenext canto). Since the two that we do discover in the text are so dramaticallyemblematic of the two trees of Genesis, and since no other tree along thisterrace is alluded to, it is almost certainly wise to reject that theory, asD’Ovidio (Dovi.1926.1), p. 206, insisted. [return to English[part0013.html#c23-s21-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c23-s21-i]]72–75. [part0013.html#c23-s24-e] The text used by most of the earlycommentators apparently offered a form of albore, “tree” in the singular.Petrocchi’s note, however, shows a preponderance of plural forms and all moderneditors agree. We have seen the offshoot of the Tree of Life (and if the earlycommentators should happen to be correct in believing that the reference here isto a single tree, it would be to that one [see note to Purg. XXII.130–135]). Inthe next canto (vv. 113–117) we shall come upon a second, clearly descended fromthe Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The most direct explanation of vv.73–74, “the same desire leads us to the trees / that led Christ to utter Elìwith such bliss,” is that the first sin of Adam and Eve, eating of the fruit ofthat tree, deprived them of the fruit of the other, eternal life. Thus Christ’ssacrifice is doubly restorative, redeeming the sin and restoring the reward.See Matthew 27:46 for “Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani?” (My God, My God, why haveyou forsaken me?), Christ’s last words on the cross, uttered in Aramaic. (Seealso Mark 15:34, with the variant “Eloi.”) Many of the early commentatorsdiscuss the passage in light of Jesus’ request that the “cup” (of crucifixion)pass from him, but then accepting it joyfully in favor of the resultantredemption of humankind. The human in Him momentarily despairs, but then the Godin Him rejoices.For the notion that the penitents, like Jesus on the cross, simultaneously wishand do not wish to suffer in order to achieve redemption, see Trone(Tron.1995.1).

[part0013.html#c23-s26-e] The entire context of this intimaterecollection invites us to believe that Forese (to leave to one side thequestion of Dante’s own behavior), in his life on earth, had behaved in waysthat suggested to his friend that his salvation was not exactly to be expected.Dante’s question is amusing. Since Forese, dead for less than four years (hedied in July 1296), had lived most of his life a sinner (and thus was late inhis repentance), why did Dante not find him down on the lower slopes of themountain in ante-purgatory? (This is possibly a sort of compromise, a far morepolite question than “Why did I not find you in hell?”) [return to English[part0013.html#c23-s26-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c23-s26-i]]85–93. [part0013.html#c23-s29-e] The prayerful tears of Forese’s wife, Nella,demonstrate emphatically that the efficacy of prayer is not limited to thebenefit of the souls found in ante-purgatory, but extends to those involved inactive purgation as well.In a famous exchange of sonnets in a tenzone, a sort of poetic contest in theform of a series of exchanged insults, Dante and Forese heaped calumnies uponone another for sexual and other inadequacies. While there is continuing disputeconcerning the authenticity of these poems (see note to vv. 115–117), in which,among other things, poor Nella is presented as being cold at night because ofthe lack of sexual interest on the part of her impotent husband, this exchangebetween the two men would seem to be based on some personal reminiscence of asimilar nature.Nella continues Dante’s “legends of good women” here in purgatory, tales ofwomen who lived thoroughly virtuous lives. Such as these begin with Pia de’Tolomei (Purg. V.130–136), continue with Gaia (if one reads her characterpositively) in Purgatorio XVI.140, and Alagia in Purgatorio XIX.142–145, includein the briefest of mentions virtuous pagan women (Purg.

XXIV.37), and conclude withPiccarda, Costanza, and St. Clare in the third canto of Paradiso. None of theother three prominent women who are seen in these realms of salvation, Sapia(Purg. XIII) and then both Cunizza and Rahab (Par. IX), quite fill the bill,since at least portions of their lives on earth were spectacularly sinful. Asfor Lucy (Purg. IX), Matelda (Purg. XXVIII), Beatrice, the Hebrew matriarchsseen seated in the heavenly Rose (Par. XXXII), and the Virgin Mary, they are allcreatures of a still higher order of saintly virtue.

[part0013.html#c23-s39-e] What activities do Dante’s words indicate?The first commentators believed that he refers to, in the phrase of Benvenuto,their mutual pursuit of delectabilia non honesta (improper pleasures). Nocommentator before the Anonimo Fiorentino had apparently read or heard of theirtenzone (one of the main reasons that those who deny its authenticity do so).And it was only in the late nineteenth century that some offered the opinionthat this passage referred to the tenzone. Nearly all of the more recentdiscussants are firmly of the opinion, agreeing with the first commentators,that Dante is referring to the actual relationship he had with Forese and thesort of delectabilia non honesta that they shared in their companionship. It isnot clear exactly what activities the poet has in mind, but it is clear that hisown are seen as afflicting him when Virgil rescued him from sin and led him intothe afterworld. This is the first time we have any indication that Dante’s sinson earth might be characterized as having involved moral turpitude.There has been a continuing effort to deny the authenticity of the tenzone. Thisbegan with Domenico Guerri’s debate with Michele Barbi in the early 1930s, whichGuerri’s student, Antonio Lanza, reopened in the early 1970s. His opposition toauthenticity is currently supported by his student, Mauro Cursietti(Curs.1995.1). (Their position is supported by Stefanini [Stef.1996.1].) For arecent overview of the current debate, with necessary bibliography and polemicalinsistence on inauthenticity, see Lanza (Lanz.1997.1); see also Cursietti(Curs.1997.1 and Curs.2000.1). But see Fabian Alfie’s (Alfi.1998.1) argumentsfor retention of the tenzone in the Dantean canon on the basis of the evidenceof the manuscripts. The debate is probably far from over.

XXI.125]), allowedto hear the name of Virgil from Dante’s lips. That Dante does not here refer toStatius by name might seem to indicate (at least hypothetically) that, while thetwo men spoke of Virgil in their earthly conversations, they had not discussedStatius.

We have not heard Virgil’s voice since the fifteenth verse of thelast canto. We will not hear it again until the next canto (XXV.17). This is hislongest silence since he entered the poem in its first canto (see note to Inf.XXX.37–41). He would seem to have been moved aside in response to Dante’sinterest in the encounter with Forese and concern with exploring the nature ofhis own most particular poetic practice, the subject at the core of this canto.[return to English [part0013.html#c24-s1-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c24-s1-i]]4. [part0013.html#c24-s2-e] For the phrase “things dead twice over” see theEpistle of Jude. The context is worth noting. Jude is declaiming against thosewho have infiltrated the ranks of the true believers, those “ungodly men”(homines … impii—Iudae 4) who are compared to, in succession, the unbelievingIsraelites, the fallen angels, the sinners of Sodom and Gomorrah, as well asthose great sinners Cain, Balaam (Numbers 22–25 and 31:16), and Korah (Numbers16). The presence of these ungodly ones is then portrayed (Iudae 12) as ablemish upon the feasts of Christians gathered in charity. Interlopers, they aredescribed as “feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water,carried about by the winds; trees whose fruit withers, without fruit, twice dead(bis mortuae), plucked out by the roots.” Several commentators refer to thispassage, but only Poletto (1894) does so with some attention to the context,also graciously giving credit to the commentary of Antonio Cesari (Cesa.1824.1)for the earliest citation. The contrapasso here is thus more related to gluttonythan at first may seem apparent, calling attention to an arid feasting that hasno regard for the condition of the soul. These penitents thus purge themselvesas though in memory of Jude’s gluttonous “ungodly men.” [return to English[part0013.html#c24-s2-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c24-s2-i]]8–9.

[part0013.html#c24-s4-e] Dante asks after Forese’s sister, Piccarda, whomwe shall meet as the first presence of Paradiso (see note to Par. III.46–49).The Donati family, like others in the poem, is variously dispersed in theafterworld. Later in this canto (verse 84) we will hear of Forese’s brother,Corso, who is destined for hell. In ante-purgatory we met a member of anothersimilarly dispersed family, Buonconte da Montefeltro (Purg. V.88), son of thedamned Guido (Inf. XXVII.67).

[part0013.html#c24-s5-e] Forese’s touching words of praise for hissister, already joyous in the presence of God in the Empyrean (the Christianversion of Mt. Olympus, home of the gods in classical mythology), brought thefollowing misogynist comment from Benvenuto (1380): “And that is great praise,for it is a rare thing to find in the same woman harmony between comely form andchaste behavior.”Piccarda, who was dragged from her life as a nun into matrimony against herwill, eventually puts us in mind of Pia de’ Tolomei (Purg. V.133–136), who alsowas forced into a marriage she did not welcome. And both of them may send ourthoughts back to Francesca da Rimini, similarly mistreated (Inf. V.100–107).

[part0013.html#c24-s6-e] “Here” surely refers to this terrace (see noteto Purg. XXII.49–51). Since there is no prohibition against naming names on anyother terrace, commentators worry about Forese’s motive in speaking this way.Most currently agree that he is using exaggerated understatement (the tropelitotes) to make his point: i.e., on this terrace one must use names to identifythe penitents because they are unrecognizable (as was Forese to Dante at Purg.XXIII.43–48) as a result of their emaciation.

[part0013.html#c24-s7-e] Bonagiunta Orbicciani degli Overardi da Lucca(1220?–1297?), notary and writer of lyric poems, composed mainly in imitation ofthe Provençal poets. He was involved in polemic against the poetry of GuidoGuinizzelli and was attacked by Dante in his treatise on vernacular eloquence(Dve I.xiii.1) for writing in a dialectical rather than the lofty (“curial”)vernacular. Some three dozen of his poems survive and a group of these has beenre-edited and re-presented by Gianfranco Contini (Cont.1960.1), vol. I, pp.257–82.

He was not born in Tours, but had servedas treasurer of the cathedral of St. Martin in Tours. He briefly served aschancellor of France before becoming a cardinal in 1261. And his Frenchconnection was further apparent when Charles of Anjou was instrumental insecuring the papacy for him. His gluttonous affection for eels from Lake Bolsenacaused him, according to Jacopo della Lana (1324), to have them, still alive,drowned in white wine from Liguria (the town of Vernazza) and then roasted. Thecommentator also reports that, as pope, coming from meetings dealing with Churchbusiness, he would cry out, “O Lord God, how many ills must we bear for Yourholy Church! Let us have a drink!” and head for table to console himself.Not only did this gluttonous pope support French political designs in Italy, hewas the man who promoted Benedetto Caetani to the rank of cardinal, thus greatlyfacilitating his eventual elevation as Pope Boniface VIII (a promotion thatDante could not have regarded with equanimity, given his personal sufferings atthe hands of this pope [see note to Inf. XIX.52–53]). In the light of suchthings, why did Dante decide that Martin was among the saved? Trucchi (1936)suggests that, as the successor to the nepotistic and venal Nicholas III (seeInf. XIX. 69–72), Martin put an end, for a time, to the practice of simony inthe papacy. It is for that reason, in his opinion, that Dante overlooked hisother flagrant sins to save him.

[part0013.html#c24-s9-e] The act of naming being particularly necessaryon this terrace (see note to vv. 16–18), it brings pleasure (Dante again employslitotes: it does not cause scowls) to those who are named and thus may hope forrelieving prayer from the world, once Dante returns to it. It hardly needs to bepointed out that many of the sinners in hell were less pleased at beingrecognized. [return to English [part0013.html#c24-s9-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c24-s9-i]]29.

The flockhe is envisioned as leading would seem to be less the faithful of Ravenna thanhis guests to dinner. [return to English [part0013.html#c24-s10-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c24-s10-i]]31–33. [part0013.html#c24-s11-e] “Marchese (or Marchesino) degli Orgogliosi ofForlì…was Podestà of Faenza in 1296” (T). Embellishing an incident he probablyfirst heard from his teacher, Benvenuto da Imola, John of Serravalle (1416)recounts it this way: “One day [Marchese] asked of his servant, ‘What do thepeople say of me? What is my reputation among them?’ And the servant answered,‘O my lord, they say that you are noble and wise,’ etc. And so he spoke again tohis servant, saying, ‘Now tell me the truth, what do they really say?’ In replythe servant said, ‘Since you wish it, I will tell you the truth; people say youare a great drinker of wine.’ At which [Marchese] responded, ‘These people speaktruthfully; but they really ought to add that I am always thirsty—and that is afact, for I thirst continually.’ ” Bonagiunta was also a lover of the grape,according to Benvenuto (1380), who characterized him as “a deft contriver ofrhymes and a ready imbiber of wines.” [return to English[part0013.html#c24-s11-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c24-s11-i]]34–36. [part0013.html#c24-s12-e] Dante’s attention was drawn to Bonagiunta daLucca because, he says, Bonagiunta seemed to know him. We may reflect that Dantethe poet’s interest in Bonagiunta centered on his desire to stage, clued by theutterance of this lesser poet, his own ars poetica, as we shall shortlyunderstand. Including Dante, the interaction among those speaking or beingnoticed in this canto involves two poets, two religious figures, and twopoliticians. And then there are the two classical poets who are not evenmentioned once in this very “modern” canto (it is notable that Pope Martin, deadonly fifteen years, is the senior ghost among the five gluttons in this group).[return to English [part0013.html#c24-s12-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c24-s12-i]]37–39. [part0013.html#c24-s13-e] For Dante’s use of the verb mormorare(murmur), see the note to Purgatorio X.100–102. This passage has long beenproblematic. Does Bonagiunta refer to his fellow Lucchesi in an unfavorable way,calling them gentucca or gentuccia (a deprecating way of referring to hispeople, or gente)? Or is he mentioning a kindly woman of that name who will bewelcoming to Dante when, in his exile, he will come to Lucca? In this case hewould be referring to the femmina referred to in vv. 43–45. Beginning withFrancesco da Buti (1385), who states that Gentucca was the name of a woman fromRossimpelo, most commentators believe that the reference is to someone who wasbenevolent to Dante in Lucca during a stay there. We have, however, noconfirming evidence for this sojourn in Lucca (see Michele Messina, “Lucca,” EDIII [1971]), which, if it took place, probably did so in 1308–9, and certainlyno hard facts establishing her identity. Nonetheless, this remains the besthypothesis. Still others have attempted to make a case for Gentucca as a womanwith whom Dante had some sort of sexual liaison, an interpretation that seemsventuresome at best. On the entire question see Giorgio Varanini, “Gentucca,” EDIII (1971). [return to English [part0013.html#c24-s13-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c24-s13-i]]40–42. [part0013.html#c24-s14-e] Dante encourages Bonagiunta, for whom speechis made difficult by the pain he feels in his mouth, the orifice by which heoffended in gluttony, to speak more plainly.

[part0013.html#c24-s15-e] If this woman is, as some contemporarystudents of the question suggest, Gentucca di Ciucchino Morla, she was the wifeof Buonaccorso Fondora. In that case she wore the black wimple, worn by wives,not the white, reserved for widows. Nino Visconti’s widow, Giovanna, accordingto him, made the mistake of remarrying badly, putting off the white wimple(Purg. VIII.74). However, we cannot be sure whether Bonagiunta is referring toan as yet unmarried woman, or to a married one whose husband, soon to die, isstill alive. In any case, this woman will make Lucca seem pleasant to Dante, nomatter how others may blame it (as Dante himself had done in Inf. XXI.40–42).[return to English [part0013.html#c24-s15-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c24-s15-i]]49–51. [part0013.html#c24-s17-e] Having recognized Dante earlier (vv. 35–36),Bonagiunta now presses him about the nature of his poetry. Is he the poet whodrew forth from within himself the new poems that began with the canzone “Ladiesthat have intelligence of love”? This is the first long poem of the three thathelp give structure to the Vita nuova, announcing the beginning of its secondstage, in which Dante chooses to give over the style of “complaint,” borrowedfrom Cavalcanti, in order to turn to the style of praise, with its debt toGuinizzelli. Dante composed this poem around 1289. From this remark, we learn atleast one important thing. Whatever the determining features of Dante’s newpoetry, it was different—at least according to him, using Bonagiunta as hismouthpiece—from all poetry written before it, including Dante’s own. Thisprecision evades many who discuss the problem, who continue to allow poems byDante and other poets written before Donne ch’avete to share its status. Itseems clear that Dante’s absolute and precise purpose is to rewrite the historyof Italian lyric, including that of his own poems, so that it fits his currentprogram.

[part0013.html#c24-s18-e] There is perhaps no more debated tercet inthis poem than this one, and perhaps none that has more far-reachingimplications for our general understanding of Dante’s stance as a poet. Does herefer to Amore as the god of Love? or as the name of the true God in His ThirdPerson, the Holy Spirit? Dantists are deeply (and fiercely) divided by thisissue. The bibliography of work devoted to it is immense. Readers who knowItalian will want to refer to three papers composed for the Third InternationalDante Seminar (Florence, 2000) by members of the panel concerning the currentlyvexed question of Dante’s attitude toward Cavalcanti and its relationship to hisview of his own poetic as this is given voice here (see Anto.2001.1,Durl.2001.1, and Leon.2001.1). For the views of this writer, which are at somevariance especially from those of the first and third of these, see Holl.1992.2and Holl.1999.1. In the most recent of these two studies, the case is made forour understanding that Dante indeed presents himself as writing under theinspiration of the Holy Spirit, a view that causes understandable distress, butwhich is fundamental, in one line of thought, to a better comprehension of hispurposes. [return to English [part0013.html#c24-s18-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c24-s18-i]]55–63. [part0013.html#c24-s19-e] Bonagiunta’s response may be paraphrased asfollows: “Now I understand the nature of the knot that held back the Notary[Giacomo da Lentini], Guittone [d’Arezzo], and me from the sweet new style thatat this very moment I am hearing! Now I clearly understand how your pens[plural] followed strictly after the words of the ‘dictator,’ something thatours did not; and in that lies the entire difference between your [Dante’s] ‘newstyle’ and ours.” He falls silent, as though, it seems, satisfied with hisutterance.What exactly does Dante mean by the phrase “sweet new style”? This is surely oneof the key questions presented in the poem, and not one of the easiest. Further,who else wrote in that “style”? And what is the significance of the fact thatBonagiunta says that he hears it now (in listening to Dante here in purgatory?in current Tuscan poems composed on earth? [but how would he hear these?])? Whatfollows is a series of hypotheses that sketch out this writer’s views of themajor aspects of a difficult question.(1) The passage, probably written ca. 1311–12, marks the first time that thebeguiling phrase “dolce stil novo” had ever been used in the vernacular that wecall “Italian.” That it was meant to refer to or to identify an actual “school”of poets that existed before the date of its inscription in Dante’s text may notbe assumed (see Bigi [Bigi.1955.1] and Favati [Fava.1975.1]), although itfrequently is.(2) On the other hand, the author’s (or Bonagiunta’s) plural “vostre” should beseen as including not only himself, but also Cino da Pistoia (the one fellowpoet who, Dante believed, had understood the theological significance of hisBeatrice), if perhaps no one else (see Hollander [Holl.1992.2] and Brugnolo[Brug.1993.2]).(3) The significance of the poetic stance struck in the phrase should beunderstood in theological terms. Dante is not presenting himself as a usual lovepoet, but as one who serves as God’s scribe in recording the result of God’slove for him through the agency of Beatrice. Dante and others had previouslywritten in a “sweet” style; but only he, now, in his Comedy, writes in this“sweet new style” that creates a theologized poetry that is like almost no oneelse’s (see Mazzotta [Mazz.1979.1], pp. 197–210; Bara´nski [Bara.2001.2], pp.392–94).(4) The word “style” here has a broader connotation than it usually does indiscourse about poetry, indicating not only a way of writing, but a subject forwriting, as was apparent when his new style of praise in Vita nuova waspresented as requiring new “matter” (see Holl.1999.1, pp. 271–72; Aversano[Aver.2001.1], p. 131: the poem is “sweet artistically because it is newpoetically”). The “new style” not only sounds different, it is different (butsee the differing view of Leonardi [Leon.2001.1], p. 334). The very phrasing ofthe element that sets, in Bonagiunta’s understanding (vv. 58–59), this “style”apart from all others—copying out exactly what was spoken by the“dictator”—points not at all to style, but rather to content.(5) We should probably also understand that the phrase “dolce stil novo” refersto some of Dante’s earlier poetry (only the canzone “Donne ch’avete intellettod’amore” for certain), some of Cino’s poems (at least and perhaps only thecanzone upon the death of Beatrice, “Avegna ched el m’aggia più per tempo”), andto Dante’s Comedy, thus presenting the author’s claims for a theologicalgrounding of his poem’s inspiration as being joined to certain of his earlierpoems that he felt either had, or could be construed as having, the samecharacter. This is the crux of a continuing disagreement with those who arguethat the Comedy is a poem that goes beyond the stil novo (e.g., Pertile[Pert.1993. 1]), rather than being a continuation of it. In short, while Danteand others (Guido Cavalcanti perhaps the most capable among them) had previouslywritten in a “sweet” style, Dante alone developed, on the model of Guinizzelli’slyrics, poems of praise of a theologized lady, Beatrice.

[part0013.html#c24-s19-e] In a single line Bonagiunta crosses off the listof illustrious precursors two of the great poetic figures that preceded Dante,Giacomo da Lentini (died ca. 1250) and Guittone d’Arezzo (ca. 1230–94). Giacomowas the first major Italian practitioner of lyric, and is looked upon as theinventor of the sonnet and as the founder of the so-called Sicilian School, thefirst group of writers of lyric in Italian, taking their models from the writersof lyric in Provençal. Dante is later still harder on Guittone (see Purg. XXVI.124–126 and note), who, as Dante came to poetry in the 1280s, was perhaps thepreeminent Tuscan poet.

[part0013.html#c24-s22-e] The two similes, piled one upon the other,return to a technique not observed in some time: a comparison based on anantique source coupled with a completely “vernacular” and “ordinary” one. SeeInferno XXIV. 1–15, where ancient and contemporary elements are combined in asingle simile, and Inferno XXVI. 25–39, where local Tuscan agriculture andElijah’s ascent to heaven are the contrasting elements in two neighboringsimiles.The first of this pair derives, fairly obviously to today’s reader, instructedby the notes in the text, from Lucan (Phars. V.711–716), a description of cranesfleeing winter’s cold to winter on the Nile. Nonetheless, for all the certaintyin recent commentators that this is a reminiscence of Lucan, it was only withTorraca (1905) that it seems first to have been observed.

[part0013.html#c24-s28-e] Corso Donati, brother of Forese, was, inDante’s eyes, the Black Guelph who bore “the greatest blame” for Florence’sproblems (and for his own) because of his alliance with Pope Boniface VIII, the“beast” who will drag him to hell—as Dante will see before much time passes. Infact, through the magic of post-event prophecy (Corso was killed on 6 October1308), Forese is able to promise the protagonist this happy vengeance.Corso had supervised the murderous taking of the city by the Black Guelphs afterCharles of Valois had led his French troops into Florence in November 1301. In apolitical reversal that is not totally unlike Dante’s own, he was condemned todeath by the priors for trying to take power into his own hands in a supposedarrangement involving the Tuscan Ghibelline leader Uguccione della Faggiuola, towhose daughter he was married.While the “beast” in Forese’s account is clearly metaphorical, Corso apparentlydid die while trying to escape, either in a fall from his horse or by beinglanced by one of his captors once he had fallen—or even as he was hanging from astirrup, dragged along the ground.

[part0013.html#c24-s32-e] The military simile fits the tone of thedeath scene of Corso that has just been narrated by his brother. Here, by way ofreturning to the rigors of his penance, Forese is allowed to assume the role ofthe cavalryman who goes out to make the first contact of battle. Virgil andStatius, described by a word perhaps never seen before in Italian, “marshals,”are left behind, but are calmly directing the battle, as it were. As for Dante,that retired cavalryman (see note to Inf. XXI.95), it is not clear what role heplays, but he is a subordinate to these two marshals, those great poets who ledother humans into knowledge and virtue through their works. [return to English[part0013.html#c24-s32-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c24-s32-i]]100–102. [part0013.html#c24-s34-e] Forese has rounded the terrace and is nowbeyond the reach of Dante’s sight, just as his prophecy, obscure now in 1300before the event of Corso’s death, has escaped Dante’s understanding. [return toEnglish [part0013.html#c24-s34-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c24-s34-i]]103–105. [part0013.html#c24-s35-e] Moving along the terrace with his eyesfixed on Forese, Dante does not at first see the tree that his own movementforward has brought him to. The second tree of this terrace has caused lesspuzzlement than the first one (Purg. XXII.131–135); the succeeding verses(116–117) answer most questions that one might have (see note to vv. 115–117):this tree is an offshoot of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.Jenni (Jenn.1972.1), pp. 12–13, argues that the sight of the water from abovecausing the leaves to shine makes the penitent gluttons even hungrier. As wasthe case with the first tree, this one is also apparently watered from above(see Purg. XXII. 137–138). [return to English [part0013.html#c24-s35-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c24-s35-i]]106–111. [part0013.html#c24-s36-e] This simile possibly reflects a passagefrom Convivio (Conv. IV.xii.16) in which Dante speaks of the natural love ofhuman souls for God, their maker, which is easily drawn off course: “Thus we seelittle children setting their desire first of all on a fruit, and then, growingolder, desiring to possess a little bird, and then still later desiring topossess fine clothes, then a horse, and then a woman, and then modest wealth,then greater riches, and then still more” (tr. Lansing). The central elements ofthis image (a man catching the hungry attention of a child by holding up afruit) are deployed again in Purgatorio XXVII. 45. [return to English[part0013.html#c24-s36-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c24-s36-i]]112–114. [part0013.html#c24-s38-e] The penitents (as will be the poets) areurged to turn aside, apparently by the same voice from within the tree that willwarn off the poets (and since the names of exemplary figures are recited by thisvoice, we probably correctly assume it speaks to all, triggered by its sensethat someone is approaching, that is, not only in response to these specialvisitors). They are “enlightened” (in the sense that their first opinion, thatthe fruit of this tree is desirable, is changed) when they realize that thistree is a branch from that beneath which humankind first fell into sin, and thuswillingly move away. [return to English [part0013.html#c24-s38-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c24-s38-i]]115–117. [part0013.html#c24-s39-e] Once again an unseen and unidentifieddivinely authorized voice speaks from within the foliage of a tree (see Purg.XXII.140–154). This is an offshoot of the tree of which Eve (and then Adam, whohad also been warned not to [see note to Purg. XXII.140–141]) ate the fruit.Porena (1946) is one of those who unaccountably believe that there must be stillother trees upon this terrace. If, indeed, Dante is referring to the two mostsignificant trees in the original garden, the Tree of Life and the Tree of theKnowledge of Good and Evil (Genesis 2:8), it would seem unlikely that he wouldhave wanted us to imagine there might be others scattered along the terrace.Porena denies that the first speaking tree (Purg. XXII.141) is an offshoot ofthe Tree of Life, but believes that it, too, is derived from the Tree ofKnowledge, an opinion that may seem difficult to justify.Bosco/Reggio raise a question in their commentary: Why was the first tree (Purg.XXII.139) approachable, while this one is not? Would it not seem reasonable thatthe fruit of the Tree of Life should be precisely what purgation is preparingpenitents to receive? At the same time, it would also seem reasonable that theyshould prepare for their reward by ceremonially avoiding the site of humanity’soriginal sin. [return to English [part0013.html#c24-s39-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c24-s39-i]]121–126. [part0013.html#c24-s41-e] The voice reminds the travelers (and thepenitents, we assume) first of the “Centaurs, mythical race, half horses andhalf men, said to have been offspring of Ixion, King of the Lapithae, and acloud in the shape of Hera [Juno]” (T). The Centaurs fought against the Lapithsand Theseus at the wedding feast for Pirithoüs (the friend of Theseus and theirhalf brother) and his bride Hippodamia. The Centaurs attempt to rape the brideand bridesmaids but are prevented by Theseus and others. The final three hundredlines of the scene, which served as Dante’s source, in Ovid (Metam. XII.210–535)represent a kind of tumultuous and comic redoing of the battle scenes in theIliad (and in the Aeneid), with plenty of body parts and blood.For the double nature of the Centaurs (beast and man at once), see InfernoXII.84.The Hebrews selected by Gideon to make war upon the Midianites were those wholifted water to their mouths in their cupped hands, as opposed to those who castthemselves down to a stream to drink directly with their mouths (see Judges7:2–8). The ones remembered here are not the 300 whom he chose to fight, but the9,700 who were sent back to their tents. These were “slack” in that they gave intotally to their desire to drink, while the 300 displayed a more controlleddemeanor, more fitting to those who would require composure even in the heat ofbattle. [return to English [part0013.html#c24-s41-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c24-s41-i]]133–134. [part0013.html#c24-s45-e] This voice, we shortly come to understand,comes from the Angel of Temperance. [return to English [part0013.html#c24-s45-e]/ Italian [part0020.html#c24-s45-i]]137–138. [part0013.html#c24-s46-e] Singleton (1973) points out that thedescription of this angel is indebted to John’s Revelation (Apocalypse 1:9–20).The passage, prologue to John’s vision, tells how the apostle was ordered towrite it by Jesus, a scene described in terms that at times closely resemblethese. [return to English [part0013.html#c24-s46-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c24-s46-i]]145–150. [part0013.html#c24-s49-e] The last of the similes in a canto richwith them compares the waft of air from the angel’s wing felt by Dante on hisbrow to the sweet-smelling breeze of May. Tommaseo (1837) suggested a source inVirgil’s fourth Georgic (IV.415): “Haec ait et liquidum ambrosiae diffunditodorem” (She spoke, giving off the flowing fragrance of ambrosia). Cyrene isencouraging her despondent son, Aristaeus, to learn his fate from Proteus.[return to English [part0013.html#c24-s49-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c24-s49-i]]151–154. [part0013.html#c24-s51-e] Dante now “finishes” the Beatitude (Matthew5:6) begun in Purgatorio XXII. 4–6, “Beati qui esuriunt et sitiunt iustitiam,quoniam ipsi saturabuntur” (Blessed are those who hunger and thirst afterrighteousness, for they shall be satisfied). In the first context, applying tothose who “thirst” for riches, only sitiunt was heard, while here we have theecho only of the word for hunger, esuriunt.

The sun at the antipodes has now moved roughly two hours, fromshining down from in front of the constellation Capricorn, then Sagittarius, andnow Taurus, or from noon to two o’clock (as, half the world away, in Jerusalemit is two in the morning). Since the travelers had entered this terrace atroughly ten in the morning (Purg. XXII.115–120), it results that they have spentroughly four hours among the penitents of Gluttony and will spend approximatelythe same amount of time from now until they leave the penitents of Lust (seePurg. XXVII.65–66), the first two hours traversing the distance between the twoterraces (see Purg. XXVI.4–6). [return to English [part0013.html#c25-s1-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c25-s1-i]]4–9. [part0013.html#c25-s2-e] The simile stresses the renewed urgency of theclimb, with the three poets, led by Virgil, mounting in single file. Statius is,as will eventually be made plain, in the middle position (see Purg. XXVII.48),from which he will shortly respond at length to Dante’s question about theaerial body. [return to English [part0013.html#c25-s2-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c25-s2-i]]17–18. [part0013.html#c25-s6-e] Virgil’s metaphor has Dante drawing thebowstring of his question so hard and far that the iron tip of his arrow istouching the shaft of his bow. These are the first words spoken by Virgil sincePurgatorio XXIII.15 (see the note to Purg. XXIV.1–3). [return to English[part0013.html#c25-s6-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c25-s6-i]]20–21. [part0013.html#c25-s7-e] Dante’s question, which has been in the backof his mind since Purgatorio XXIII.37–39, addresses the apparent incongruity ofthe fact that the souls of the penitents of Gluttony seem to grow thin from notingesting food. Such a phenomenon, he has wrongly assumed, should be associatedonly with the experience of starvation in a mortal body. [return to English[part0013.html#c25-s7-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c25-s7-i]]22–24. [part0013.html#c25-s8-e] The reference is to Ovid’s near-epic narrativeof the hunt for the Calydonian boar with its unhappy outcome for Meleager(Metam. VIII.260–546). He, son of the king of Calydon and of Althaea, killedthis rampaging animal and gave its skin to Atalanta, with whom he was in love.Althaea’s two brothers, Plexippus and Toxeus, take the remains of the beast backfrom her. Enraged at the insult to his honor, Meleager kills them. Seeing thecorpses of her brothers brought into the temple where she was giving thanks forher son’s victory, and learning who had killed them, Althaea is moved to takevengeance, even upon her own son. When he was born, the three Fates haddetermined that he would live only so long as a firebrand remained unconsumed ina fire into which it had been cast. Hearing this, Althaea snatched the burninglog-end from the fire and doused it in water. Now she took up again this pieceof wood, which she had preserved, and cast it into a fire, thus causing thedeath of her own son. Virgil’s point is that if Dante had understood thisprinciple, that there is a vital relationship between what seem unrelatedphenomena (e.g., the burning of a log-end and the death of a man), he would havealready understood the relationship between body and soul here in purgatory.[return to English [part0013.html#c25-s8-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c25-s8-i]]25–27. [part0013.html#c25-s9-e] As a second instance of this principle, Virgiloffers the example of a person’s movements being reflected in a mirror; onceagain, to an ignorant observer, the two phenomena might seem to have independentand unrelated causes if the observer did not understand the principle ofreflection (e.g., two Marx brothers in sleeping garments facing each other in anopen doorway and moving in harmony). [return to English [part0013.html#c25-s9-e]/ Italian [part0020.html#c25-s9-i]]28–30. [part0013.html#c25-s10-e] It is as though Virgil himself understandsthat his explanations, relying on physical laws, do not explain the deeperprinciples involved in the fact that these souls respond with physical symptomsto a moral sensation. Dealing with this passage, Pietro di Dante (1340)allegorizes Virgil as “rational philosophy” and Statius, “a Christian poet,” as“moral philosophy.” It might seem more to the point to realize that Statius, asa saved Christian, simply knows by revelation some mysterious things that arenot known by others, e.g., all ordinary mortals and all souls who are not saved.[return to English [part0013.html#c25-s10-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c25-s10-i]]31–33. [part0013.html#c25-s11-e] Statius excuses himself for revealing anessential Christian mystery in the presence of a pagan because of his love forthis particular pagan. John of Serravalle (1415) speaks of Virgil’s belief(learned from Plato’s Timaeus, according to Benvenuto’s commentary on Inf. I.10–12) that the souls of humans come from the stars and return to them. While wecannot be certain that Dante shared the first part of this view (and see Par.IV.22–24 for his denial of the second), the “eternal plan” is at significantvariance from Plato, as Statius’s lecture will make plain. [return to English[part0013.html#c25-s11-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c25-s11-i]]34–108. [part0013.html#c25-s12-e] For a summary of the main points ofStatius’s lecture on embryology, see the Outline of this canto, above. Forextremely useful notes on Dante’s sources in these verses (37–88), Aristotle,Avicenna, Averroës, Albertus Magnus, Aquinas, along with reference to BrunoNardi’s important contribution to our awareness of Dante’s schooling in suchmatters, see Singleton’s commentary to them. This “lecture” is put to the taskof justifying Dante’s presentation of spiritual beings as still possessing, forthe purposes of purgation, their bodily senses even though they have no bodies.Souls in Heaven, we will discover, have no such “aerial bodies,” but are presentas pure spirit. [return to English [part0013.html#c25-s12-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c25-s12-i]]37–42. [part0013.html#c25-s13-e] The “perfect blood” is the end result of aseries of four “digestions” within the body: in the stomach, the liver, theheart, the members. Sperm is what remains after the “fourth digestion” of theblood, which informs the various members of the body (e.g., heart, brain).[return to English [part0013.html#c25-s13-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c25-s13-i]]48 [part0013.html#c25-s16-e]. “The perfect place from which it springs” is theheart, from which it flows to become sperm.

[part0013.html#c25-s18-e] The vegetative soul is the first one formed.Unlike the vegetative soul of things that have no higher nature, ours is onlythe beginning—our soul has not yet “come to shore,” its “voyage” has only begun.The vegetative soul enables the growth of the physical body. This capacity weshare with animate matter (things that grow, e.g., plants, as opposed toinanimate matter, e.g., rocks) and the animals. [return to English[part0013.html#c25-s18-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c25-s18-i]]56–57. [part0013.html#c25-s19-e] Now, at first resembling the lowest form ofanimate life, the sea-sponge, the animal soul begins to take life. This secondsoul is known as the “sensitive soul,” and is the seat of human emotion, acapacity we share with the animals. [return to English [part0013.html#c25-s19-e]/ Italian [part0020.html#c25-s19-i]]61. [part0013.html#c25-s21-e] What Dante has not yet heard (and thus cannotunderstand) is how this “animal” embryo can and does become a human being, i.e.,how it receives its rational soul. The word “fante,” here translated “human,”strictly speaking means “one who speaks.” Thus an “infant” (in-fans) is a humanwho cannot yet speak. Here Dante, through Statius, is speaking precisely, butnot technically. He means to indicate that the rational soul, once it is joinedto the embryo, only then makes this new creature potentially fully human. Andthis third capacity of the soul we share with no other mortal beings (angels arenothing but rational soul, having no bodily form). For these three faculties asfound in each single human soul, see the note to Purgatorio IV.1–15. [return toEnglish [part0013.html#c25-s21-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c25-s21-i]]62–66. [part0013.html#c25-s21-e] The question of the “possible intellect” wasof considerable interest in Dante’s day and was variously addressed, even among“orthodox” Christian thinkers (Albertus Magnus and his pupil Thomas Aquinas hadmajor disagreements about it), partly because its most visible champion wasAverroës (see Inf. IV.144), the twelfth-century Islamic philosopher who haddecided that the possible intellect, which is the potential capacity to perceiveuniversal ideas, existed apart from any particular human agent. An eventualresult of such a view was to question or deny the immortality of the individualhuman soul. Dante’s solution was to make the possible intellect coterminous withthe rational soul, breathed into the embryo directly by God. It is notsurprising that Dante, whose ways are often extremely freewheeling, simplyappropriated the term to his own purpose and, in these few lines, makes thepossible intellect “orthodox.” See Cesare Vasoli, “intelletto possibile,” ED III(1971). [return to English [part0013.html#c25-s21-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c25-s21-i]]67–75. [part0013.html#c25-s23-e] These three tercets mark the climax of theargument and nearly shimmer with affection as they describe God’s love for hishuman creatures, consummated in the breathing in of the rational soul, whichimmediately fuses with the vegetative and sensitive souls to form a single andimmortal entity, capable of intellection and of will. [return to English[part0013.html#c25-s23-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c25-s23-i]]76–78. [part0013.html#c25-s26-e] God’s love for us creates a new entity, animmortal soul, out of the raw material of nature just as the sun creates a newentity, wine, out of the moisture drawn up from the earth by the grapevine(Jacopo della Lana [1324]). The emphasis is on the new entity’s relation to itsformative cause: a human being is the residue of God’s spirit interacting withflesh; wine is a distillation of sunlight and matter. [return to English[part0013.html#c25-s26-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c25-s26-i]]79–84. [part0013.html#c25-s27-e] At the moment of death (for the role ofLachesis and her two sister Fates, see note to Purg. XXI.25–30) the lowerfaculties of the soul are once again in potential (rather than active) state.The higher faculties of the rational soul, on the other hand, are immediatelysaid to be in atto (in action, i.e., fully existing), and more vigorously sothan when they were inhibited by the lower souls.There are three constitutive parts of the intellectual (or rational) soulaccording to St. Augustine, De Trinitate X.18, cited by Daniello (1568): “Thememory, the intellect, and the will are the components of a single mind.” Theseseem to be the sources of Dante’s formulation here.

[part0013.html#c25-s29-e] The “afterlife” of a shade is compared to itstaking the form of a rainbow when the soul “imprints” itself upon thesurrounding air to make itself reassemble the memory of its former body out ofthin air. It is as inseparable from the higher soul as a flame is from its fire.[return to English [part0013.html#c25-s29-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c25-s29-i]]100–108. [part0013.html#c25-s34-e] The conclusion of Statius’s demonstrationof the nature of a shade’s aerial body relies, as readers since Pietro di Dante(1340) have realized, on Virgil’s description of the condition of the souls inhis afterworld, Aeneid VI.730–751. Among the details found there are the smilesand tears of which Dante speaks here (see Aen. VI.733 and vv. 103–104).

[part0013.html#c25-s37-e] The word tortura (translated as “circling”)here perhaps has two meanings: “turning” and “torture,” thus describing both thespatial and the punitive aspects of the terrace: one makes a tighter circlethere as one burns. An interpreter is free to choose either alternative; atranslator is forced to decide on one. [return to English[part0013.html#c25-s37-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c25-s37-i]]112–117. [part0013.html#c25-s38-e] Some readers have difficulty visualizingwhat Dante here describes. Flames shoot out from the wall of the cliff, at firsthorizontally, but then driven back and up by a wind moving sharply upward frombelow at the edge of the terrace, thus making the flames move up and past theface of the wall and freeing a narrow path that is flame-free at the outer edgeof the terrace.

[part0013.html#c25-s41-e] The hymn sung by the penitents of Lust hascaused some confusion in the modern age because the hymn “Summae Deusclementiae” (“God of supreme clemency”) does not seem appropriate to therecriminations of the lustful, while the hymn “Summae Parens clementiae” does.However, the early commentators knew this hymn by the same first line as wetoday know the former. Its text, in a form that is probably close to oridentical with that known by Dante, is found in the commentary of Jacopo dellaLana (1324). The third stanza hopes for God’s annealing fire to combat thepassion of lust. [return to English [part0013.html#c25-s41-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c25-s41-i]]128.

II.401–530), the tale of the wood nymph Helice(Callisto), who paid for Jupiter’s seduction and impregnation of her when, atthe request of outraged Juno, Diana banished her from her woodlands. She wasturned into a bear by Juno, and then, by the now more kind Jupiter, into theconstellation Ursa Major. [return to English [part0013.html#c25-s44-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c25-s44-i]]133–135. [part0013.html#c25-s45-e] See Pertile (Pert.2001.1), p. 62, fordiscomfort with Dante’s unique use of anonymous exemplars here. Porena (1946)was perhaps the first commentator to give voice to a similar disquiet(Bosco/Reggio [1979] do also), suggesting that we expect a third example drawnfrom the Judeo-Christian tradition but receive instead exemplars that he rightlycharacterizes as being “indeterminate” and “impersonal.” John S. Carroll (1904),while not dealing with this anomaly directly, may have found a reason forDante’s decision in a desire to champion the importance of marriage and theacceptability, indeed the desirability, of sexual concourse between husbands andwives. In this formulation Dante resorts to anonymity for his married couples inorder to justify sexual pleasure for all who are married, in covert polemicagainst such overly zealous clerics as those who called for even maritalabstinence.

[part0013.html#c25-s46-e] The word piaga (wound) is used here, as itwas used at Purgatorio XXIV.38 for Bonagiunta and his companions, to refer tothe “wound” of sin. Does it also refer to the letter P incised on them? Thosewho believe that all the penitents on the mountain bear this sign wouldnaturally believe so (see notes to Purg. IX.112, XXI.22–24, and XXII.1–6). Onthe other hand, if only Dante bears this letter on his forehead, the referencewould be to the inner wound of sin, as would seem more natural, and asPortirelli (1804) believed, arguing that the cura (treatment) represented theexternal application of fire and pasti (diet), the internal process ofreflection upon the exemplars of the chaste life.

[part0014.html#c26-s2-e] Dante, according to the calculations of Trucchi(1936), having begun his climb of the mountain at due east at the antipodes, hasnow reached a point some 25 degrees short of due west. As for the time, it hasapparently taken a bit more than two hours to climb between the two terraces(see note to Purg. XXV.1–3). [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s2-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c26-s2-i]]7–9. [part0014.html#c26-s3-e] A shadow cast upon flames does indeed make themglow a darker color. (See Abrams [Abra.1985.1] for a consideration of this imageas emblematic of the themes of this canto.) Once again Dante’s presence in thebody serves as a provocation to a group of penitents. [return to English[part0014.html#c26-s3-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c26-s3-i]]12. [part0014.html#c26-s4-e] At Inferno VI.36 the poet speaks of the shades ofthe gluttons as “lor vanità che par persona” (their emptiness, which seems realbodies). Here the penitents remark at Dante’s condition; his body does not seemto be, like theirs, “fictitious,” airy (about which state we have just heardStatius’s lengthy disquisition). [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s4-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c26-s4-i]]15. [part0014.html#c26-s5-e] Their impulse, reversing Dante’s, is not to leavethe searing flames. Again we sense the eagerness of penitents to undergo theirpurgation. See the remark of Forese Donati, “I speak of pain but should saysolace” (Purg. XXIII.72). [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s5-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s5-i]]16–20. [part0014.html#c26-s6-e] The speaker is Guido Guinizzelli (see note toverse 92), the previous Italian poet to whom, we will learn, Dante now feels thegreatest allegiance. While Guido may or may not be correct in thinking Dante isfollowing the two other souls out of reverence rather than from lack of zeal (orfear of the flames that he must enter), what he cannot know (and neverdiscovers) is that these are the great shades of Virgil and Statius. We,however, do know and realize that this scene is the last in a series that beganin the cantos devoted to Statius (XX–XXII), a program devoted to an explorationof the nature of Dante’s poetics in relation to those of other poets: Statius,Bonagiunta (who throws in Giacomo da Lentini and Guittone d’Arezzo for goodmeasure), and, in this canto, Guinizzelli (adding Giraud de Borneil and poorGuittone again) and Arnaut Daniel. No other part of the poem is as extensivelyor as richly concerned with the purposes of poetry.There is some debate among the commentators about the metaphoric or literalnature of the thirst to which Guido refers: “answer me, since I burn with thirstand fire” (verse 18). While hunger and thirst were the natural penaltiesundergone by the penitent gluttons, there is no such contrapasso here. Further,Guido’s description of his cosufferers’ “thirst” (vv. 20–21) is surelymetaphoric, thus suggesting that this first mention of thirst is also. For thisview, among others, see Pertile (Pert.1993.3), p. 381. On the other hand, thefire of which he speaks is literal enough, as Dante will find out in the nextcanto (Purg. XXVII.49–51), and his aerial body surely allows him to feel suchsensations. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s6-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s6-i]]31–36. [part0014.html#c26-s11-e] This remarkable simile, a rare medievalmanifestation of a moment of fraternal affection between heterosexuals andhomosexuals, is striking. The passage probably reflects Paul’s admonition inRomans 16:16: “Greet one another with a holy kiss,” as was suggested byScartazzini (1900). For the ants, see Virgil’s memorable simile in AeneidIV.402–407. Aeneas’s men, preparing their ships for departure from Carthage, aredescribed as follows: “Just so do ants, when winter’s on their mind, pillagegreat stores of grain and fill their houses to the beams. Over the fields movesa black column, carrying their spoil through the grass along their narrow path;some heave the huge seeds upon their shoulders, some shape up the columns,rebuking their delay. All the path fairly shines with labor.” [return to English[part0014.html#c26-s11-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c26-s11-i]]40. [part0014.html#c26-s14-e] Those who have argued that the sin punished inInferno XV and XVI is not homosexuality (see the endnote to Inf. XVI) are hardpressed to account for the obvious reference of the word “Sodom” repeated here,found first in Inferno XI.50 to refer to the sinners on the barren sands ofhomosexuality. The early commentators have no doubt whatsoever about all this.See, for example, John of Serravalle (1416): “And from this city, Sodom, the sinagainst nature took its name, just as simony did from Simon [Magus].” Each groupcries out the appropriate exemplar(s) of its sin, the first the homosexuals,calling out the names of these two “cities of the plain” (see Genesis 19:1–28),the locus classicus for homosexual lust, where the men of Sodom ask Lot to givethem for their sexual pleasure the two angels who have come to Lot and whom theytake for men (Genesis 19:4–11).What has long been problematic is the fact that, in Inferno, we find theheterosexual lustful punished in the realm of Incontinence, while those guiltyof homoerotic behavior are in that of Violence (against nature, in their case).That these two groups are now purging themselves on the same terrace may be theresult of the changed ground rules for the sins of the two cantiche more than ofany supposed change of heart on Dante’s part, that is, Dante no longer has theoption of fitting these two different bands onto an Aristotelian/Ciceroniangrid, but must associate them with one of the seven capital vices, which leaveshim little choice. Nonetheless, no matter what his intentions, the effect is tomake the reader feel that the poet has now softened his views. The notion ofPertile (Pert.1993.3), p. 388, that the impulse to love is the same in hetero-and homosexuals and that, since in purgatory only the impulse (orpredisposition) toward sin is purged, there is no longer any need to distinguishbetween them, is interesting but difficult to accept. In Inferno homosexualityis treated as a sin of hardened will, and one would be hard pressed to show thatthis does not make the “impulse” that drives it different from that behind thesins of Incontinence. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s14-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s14-i]]41–42. [part0014.html#c26-s14-e] The heterosexuals call out the name ofPasiphaë (see Inf. XII.12–13 and note), the wife of Minos, king of Crete, whohad Daedalus build for her a wooden frame covered with a cowhide so that shecould be mounted by a bull. The child of this union was the Minotaur. Pasiphaëhere is clearly meant to represent the animalistic nature of unrestrained lust,not some sort of sodomy. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s14-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s14-i]]43–48. [part0014.html#c26-s15-e] The hypothetical nature of this simile isunderlined by Dante’s use of the subjunctive mood for its main verb (volasser).Cranes do not and would not migrate simultaneously in two different directions,north to the Riphean mountains and also south to the sands of the (Libyan?)desert. Dante has developed the passage on the model, perhaps, of some ofLucan’s similes concerning cranes (see note to Purg. XXIV.64–74), but theresemblance does not seem more than casual, if the closest would seem to be thatfound at Pharsalia VII.832–834.The “former song” of the penitents is the hymn “Summae Deus clementiae”punctuated by the words of Mary at the Annunciation and those regarding Diana’schaste anger at Callisto (Purg. XXV.121–132). Each subgroup also then sends up“the cry that most befits” it, that is, either “Sodom and Gomorrah” or“Pasiphaë.” [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s15-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s15-i]]55–66. [part0014.html#c26-s19-e] Dante at last responds to the request of thepenitents, if only to some degree, since he does not fully identify himself, inkeeping with his avoidance of doing so on other terraces. He defines himself interms of his intermediate age (neither youthful and unripe nor ancient andripe), tells them what they suspected (he is here in the flesh, not in theaerial body), and that Beatrice (not named, and decidedly not the sort of womanpenitents here “do time” for) draws him heavenward. Thus he admits to hismiraculous presence among them, but gives no information that might genuinelysatisfy their curiosity. In return for relatively little he asks to know theidentity of those with whom he speaks and the condition of the group that hasmoved away from them.His evasive behavior here allows him to avoid naming himself uselessly to thosewho do not know him (see his similar avoidance with Sapia [Purg. XIII.133–138],Guido del Duca [Purg. XIV.20–21], and Marco the Lombard [Purg. XVI.37–42]).Those who recognize Dante in purgatory are as follows: Casella (Purg. II.76–78);Belacqua (recognized by Dante at Purg. IV.109–123; it would seem that he knowsDante but does not, in his laconic, sardonic way, reveal that he does); NinoVisconti (Purg. VIII.46–57); Oderisi (Purg. XI.76); Forese (Purg. XXIII.40–42);and Bonagiunta (Purg. XXIV.35–36). [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s19-e]/ Italian [part0021.html#c26-s19-i]]64–65. [part0014.html#c26-s22-e] See Benvenuto’s (1380) paraphrase: “as thoughto say, so that I may write of you souls and give your true reputation, in casethere should remain in the world infamous word of your lust.” Dante’s way ofpromising to record the penitents’ presence on the road to salvation (we mustremember that his charitable offer is made without knowing the identity of anyof the souls whom he here addresses) so that it may draw prayers from the livingand thus hasten their passage to bliss will be enlarged in Guido’s final requestof Dante (vv. 130–132), where he hopes for prayers of intercession on his behalfin Heaven itself.The language here reflects the mode of preparing a manuscript for inscription,the penciling in of guidelines that can be erased once ink is set to vellum orpaper. Dante imagines, from the vantage point of his progress through the secondkingdom of the afterworld, the preparation, by his own hand, of the manuscriptof the Comedy once he is back in the world. Here the preparation of the pageequates with its completion, the inscription of Guido Guinizzelli in the Book ofLife. See Inferno XXIX.54–57 and note; see also the less generous, but similar,offer made to Bocca degli Abati at Inferno XXXII.93. Bocca is also recorded, butin the Book of the Dead. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s22-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s22-i]]75. [part0014.html#c26-s25-e] Guido uses a nautical metaphor to praise Dante’son-loading of this precious cargo of knowledge, paraphrased by Benvenuto (1380)as follows: Dante is one who “gathers and assembles in the bark of his wit” themountain’s source of knowledge that will allow him a better chance forsalvation. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s25-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s25-i]]76. [part0014.html#c26-s26-e] Guido now addresses Dante’s question (vv.65–66), brought on by the sight of the second group of penitents that had caughthis attention (vv. 25–27). [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s26-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c26-s26-i]]77–78. [part0014.html#c26-s26-e] As part of his rather cruel treatment ofJulius Caesar, who has already been put forward as a positive exemplary figureof zeal (see Purg. XVIII.101–102 and note), Dante now makes him an “informalexemplar” (this practice is observable elsewhere only once on the mountain: seenote to Purg. XXIII.25–30) of homosexual lust (that is, he is not a part of the“official” program of those who are presented to all penitents, but is mentionedonly to Dante by Guido). This makes him perhaps the only exemplary figure inPurgatorio to have both positive and negative valences. Again we can see howcomplex, troubling, and unremitting Dante’s response to Julius was.Benvenuto (1380) dutifully and ashamedly reports Caesar’s one known homosexualexperience but surrounds it, in his perplexity and discomfort, with a list ofJulius’s (at times outrageous) sexual encounters with women. In a similar mode,John of Serravalle (1416) insists that Julius was a mere fourteen years old atthe time of this misadventure. Dante’s source for poor Julius’s escapade inBithynia may eventually be found in Suetonius’s Life of the Caesars (chapter49), as Daniello reports (1568), citing the lines that were supposedly cried outagainst him when he returned from Gaul in triumph: “See how Caesar triumphs,having conquered Gaul; Nicomedes triumphs not, but he made Caesar fall.” Whathad happened? Apparently, when Julius was young and serving in Bithynia, theking, who admired him, got him drunk and had sexual relations with him. Othertales make Caesar a more willing accomplice to the king’s desire, e.g.,Suetonius, attributing the story to Cicero, cites the report that he was dressedin purple as the queen of the realm at a wild party that ended in his“deflowering,” etc. Later Dante commentators (e.g., Oelsner [1899]) suggest thatDante’s source was a much condensed version of the events in Bithynia found inUguccione of Pisa’s entry for “triumph” in his Magnae derivationes, whichadverts to Bithynia and to Caesar’s being called both “king” and “queen” duringone of his triumphs. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s26-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s26-i]]82. [part0014.html#c26-s28-e] The word “hermaphrodite” here doubtless means(and only means) “heterosexual” (from Ovid’s tale of Salmacis and the son ofHermes [Mercury] and Aphrodite [Venus], Hermaphroditus [Metam. IV.285–388], inwhich their two genders are eventually included in a single double-sexed humanbeing). If “hermaphrodite” here means other than that, the only souls saved fromthe sin of Lust would have been homosexual and bisexual, that is, there would beno heterosexual penitents on the mountain. The commentary tradition yields somehilarious missteps on this subject. Francesco da Buti (1385), selecting“hermaphrodite” (in the sense of bisexual) as the second category of thepenitent lustful on the mountain, tells the tale of a person he had seen, whilehe was a youth, who dressed as a man but who sat at the distaff and spun wool,using the name “Mistress Piera.” It is only with Gabriele (1525) and Daniello(1568) that commentators get the problem cleared up: these are the penitentheterosexual lovers. There was still so much confusion three centuries laterthat even Scartazzini (1900) felt that he had to do a full review of thequestion. It should be said that it was provocative for Dante to have used themyth as he chose to. Ovid’s original tale is quite startling in its sexual rolereversals: Salmacis behaving like a traditional slavering male whileHermaphroditus behaves like a traditional inviting female (even performing anunintended striptease before the excited Salmacis, peeping from her hiding placein the woods). The tale seems fully intended to serve as the foundation myth ofhermaphroditism. That was not enough, however, to protect it from Dante’s by nowunsurprisingly elastic and eclectic reading of classical material. His meaningfor the word is clear: “heterosexual”; to arrive at that unriddling, he probablyforesaw, would cause his readers some exertion. [return to English[part0014.html#c26-s28-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c26-s28-i]]83–87. [part0014.html#c26-s28-e] These lines themselves possess the capacityto settle a problem that some readers prefer to keep open. How can the name ofPasiphaë, who was involved not in heterosexual lust between humans, but insodomy (sexual contact between human and beast), be used here to indicate theformer? He and his companions, Guido makes plain, did not commit “unnatural”sexual acts, but broke the laws that govern human sexual concourse, specificallythose of marriage, and did so with an untamed energy that is more fit for beaststhan humans, and is thus symbolized by a woman who conspired to be entered by abull. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s28-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s28-i]]90. [part0014.html#c26-s30-e] The large number of those who repine theirformer lust seems to be commensurate with those who are condemned forever torelive it; see Inferno V.67–69, where Virgil points out to Dante a vast numberof identifiable sinners—and this after we have already seen huge flocks ofessentially anonymous lovers (Inf. V.40–42). And these sinners here, like thoseamong whom we find Francesca and Paolo, are also compared to cranes (vv. 43–45;Inf. V.46–49). [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s30-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s30-i]]92. [part0014.html#c26-s31-e] The speaker finally reveals himself as GuidoGuinizzelli. “The most illustrious of the Italian poets prior to Dante, hebelonged to the family of the Principi of Bologna, in which city he was born ca.1230. In 1270 he was Podestà of Castelfranco; in 1274, when the GhibellineLambertazzi were expelled from Bologna, Guido with the rest of the Principi, whobelonged to the same party, was forced to leave his native city; he is said tohave died in exile at Verona in 1276” (T). His most famous poem is the canzone“Al cor gentil rempaira sempre amore” (“Love always finds shelter in the nobleheart”). It sets out the doctrine, embraced by Dante in the fourth treatise ofConvivio, that true nobility is not determined by birth but by inner virtue.[return to English [part0014.html#c26-s31-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s31-i]]93. [part0014.html#c26-s31-e] Since Guido had died ca. 1276, he has made hisway from Ostia in very good time indeed, passing through ante-purgatory and thefirst six terraces in less than a quarter century. Such speedy passage throughpurgation is a feature common to all the major figures whom Dante meets on themountain, one forced on him by his predilection for the recently dead (Statiusbeing the only ancient of note upon the slopes of the mountain allowed aspeaking part, while Hugh Capet is the oldest “modern”). However, we have noidea how long any of the souls whom we see will be at their penance (if Statiusis a model, a good long time, since he spent more than twelve hundred yearspurging himself [see note to Purg. XXI.22–24]). We simply have no idea how longGuido must stay in the fire for his lust. Time is not over for any of thesesympathetic figures, and the mysteries of penance and redemption leave suchconcerns unresolved. For all we know, Manfred or Belacqua may finish purgationbefore Guido does. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s31-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s31-i]]94–96. [part0014.html#c26-s32-e] In a striking example of abbreviatio, Danteboils down a lengthy scene in Statius’s Thebaid (V.499–730) to two lines. Thestory to which he refers runs roughly as follows. Hypsipyle was daughter of theking of Lemnos, whom she saved from death when the women of the islanddetermined to kill all the males on it. She was subsequently seduced andabandoned by Jason (Inf. XVIII.88–95), by whom she had twin sons, Thoas andEuneus. When the Lemnian women discover that their king is still alive,Hypsipyle flees, and after a misadventure with pirates ends up in the service ofthe king of Nemea, Lycurgus. While caring for Archemorus, the king’s son, shewas approached by the seven exiled warriors marching against Thebes in civilwar. Since they were thirsty, she agreed to show them to water (the fountain ofLangia—see Purg. XXII.112), but left the baby behind long enough for him to bekilled by a snake. Lycurgus would have killed her but for the chance arrival ofher twin sons. Once they have quelled the attempt on their mother’s life, theyembrace her eagerly, more eagerly than Dante will move to embrace Guido, becausehe fears the flames. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s32-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s32-i]]97–99. [part0014.html#c26-s33-e] Benvenuto (1380) remembers the reference toGuido’s having been “driven from the nest” at Purgatorio XI.97–99, and that hehad been cast forth precisely by Dante. But who are these other poets who wrote(the verb is in the past tense) better poems than Dante? While most commentatorssimply avoid this problem, those who deal with it tend to favor Guido Cavalcantiand Cino da Pistoia. For the later reappearance of the adjective “sweet,” seeverse 112 and note. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s33-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s33-i]]107. [part0014.html#c26-s36-e] Guido, like Bonagiunta, refers to hearingDante’s voice with the relative clause “ch’i’ odo” (that I hear). See PurgatorioXXIV.57. Both clauses draw attention to the importance that each of thesepredecessor poets places on listening to the living voice of this extraordinaryvisitor to their realm. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s36-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s36-i]]109–111. [part0014.html#c26-s37-e] Beginning in these lines, words for truthand for speaking or for writing poetry wend their way through twenty-two lines:ver in vv. 109, 121, 126; dir or its derivative detto (poem) in vv. 111, 112,119, 130. The conjunction reminds the reader of the importance of the issue ofthe possibility of poetic truth, given the traditional view that poets areliars. It may be helpful to know that in Dante’s day a poet in the vernacularwas known as a dicitore per rima, a “speaker in rhyme.” [return to English[part0014.html#c26-s37-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c26-s37-i]]112. [part0014.html#c26-s38-e] For the rarity of Dante’s use of the honorificvoi, here given to Guido, see the note at Purgatorio XIX.131.If Guido’s poems are dolci (sweet), in what way are they different from those ofDante that are written in the “sweet new style” (Purg. XXIV.57)? This is aquestion that has had a variety of answers. Some make Guido the firstpractitioner of the “sweet new style” (which is impossible, in Dante’s view,given his precisions at Purg. XXIV.49–51 that make his own canzone “Donnech’avete,” written at least ten years after Guido’s death, the first of the“new” poems that constitute the dolce stil novo). The better understanding isthat Guido Guinizzelli, Guido Cavalcanti, others among the Tuscans, and surelyDante himself, all wrote in the “sweet style” (the most effective demonstrationof this is found in Leonardi [Leon.2001.1]). But what both Guidos, the earlyDante, and just about everybody else failed to do was to find the “new style”that Dante developed from his understanding of Guinizzelli’s sweet style ofpraise, a mode that he took one step further when he developed his owntheologized poetics of Beatrice.In that he was the first, and had perhaps no more than one companion (Cino daPistoia, who also wrote “theologically” of Beatrice after her death). This iswhat the evidence of the texts seems to suggest. In short, Dante honorsGuinizzelli for being what he was, as far as the younger poet was concerned, the“father” of the dolce stil novo, but not one of its practitioners. Thus we mayunderstand that a number of poets wrote in the “sweet style,” but hardly any ofthem achieved the new “sweet style” that is the hallmark of Dante’s praise ofBeatrice. In all aspects of this debate, it is essential to remember that we aretrying (or should, at any rate, be trying) to negotiate an answer from whatDante said happened, not from what actually happened (or what we imagineactually happened). [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s38-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s38-i]]113–114. [part0014.html#c26-s38-e] Dante’s affectionate remark bestows lessthan it may seem to do, for all his unquestionable admiration of Guido. InPurgatorio XI.97–108 we are told both that this Guido had been eclipsed by GuidoCavalcanti in the public’s esteem and that fame for artistic excellence does notlast very long, in any case. In short, “modern custom” is not enduring. As longas such poems (i.e., those in the Italian vernacular) are written, Guido’s willbe read; he will have an honored place amongst the vernacular poets. Dante,partly because of his own endeavors on Guido’s behalf, got it right. His praise,however, is not of the order of his praise of Virgil; according to Beatrice hisfame will last as long as the world lasts (Inf. II.59–60), a life that evenDante probably thought would be longer than that enjoyed by the Italianvernacular (see Par. XXVI.133–138). For Dante’s relationship to Guido seediscussions in Marti (Mart.1966.1), Folena (Fole.1977.1), Moleta (Mole.1980.1),and Barolini (Baro.1984.1), esp. pp. 125–36. [return to English[part0014.html#c26-s38-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c26-s38-i]]115–116. [part0014.html#c26-s39-e] Guido now, in a moment of evidentlyheartfelt humility, insists on Arnaut Daniel’s superiority in the vernacular,but in the vernacular of Provence, an area in the southeast of what is nowFrance; it only came under the official rule of the French kings in 1245.“Arnaut Daniel, famous Provençal poet (fl. 1180–1200); but little is known ofhis life beyond that he belonged to a noble family of Ribeyrac in Périgord, thathe spent much of his time at the court of Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and that hevisited Paris, where he attended the coronation of Philip Augustus, as well asSpain, and perhaps Italy. His works, such as they have been preserved, consistof eighteen lyrical poems, one satirical, the rest amatory” (T).Arnaut’s poems are brilliantly difficult, written in the so-called trobar clus(a modern translation could be “hermetic verse”), typified by its harsh tonesand challenging phrasing; in other words, he avoids the trobar leu (a more openstyle, easier and more mellifluous). On Dante’s knowledge and use of Arnaut’spoems see Perugi (Peru.1978.1). For a brief overview in English of Dante’srelations with Provençal poets and poetry see Bergin (Berg.1965.1). And for asubstantial study of Dante’s response to previous modern poets, Provençal andItalian, see Barolini (Baro.1984.1), pp. 85–187. [return to English[part0014.html#c26-s39-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c26-s39-i]]117–118. [part0014.html#c26-s39-e] What does it mean to say that Arnaut was “abetter craftsman of the mother tongue”? Not, it would appear, that he wrotepoems that were better in substance than those of others, but better in style,better made. It is possible that Guinizzelli’s language reflects the claim thatlay latent (but clear enough) in some poems of Cavalcanti, who liked to use theimage of the file (limo), an instrument used to refine one’s handiwork, tosuggest the careful nature of his own poeticizing. Dante here would seem to be,through the testimony of Guinizzelli, taking some of that distinction away fromthe other Guido and, in a sense, replacing him with Arnaut, a craftsman not onlybetter than he, but better than Cavalcanti, too.The “mother tongue” here not only refers to Arnaut’s langue d’oc, his nativeProvençal, but to any Latin-derived vernacular (see Sordello’s similar remark,addressed to Virgil, at Purg. VII.16–17, which also makes Provençal the child ofLatin: “O glory of the Latins … through whom our language showed what it coulddo”).

[part0014.html#c26-s40-e] “Giraut de Borneil, one of the most famoustroubadours of his century, born at Essidueil, near Limoges, ca. 1175, died ca.1220” (T). Dante refers to him a number of times in De vulgari eloquentia andonce in Convivio, never slightingly—quite the opposite is true. Hence Dante’sabout-face here is dramatic. In De vulgari (II.ii.9) he had made Giraud his ownProvençal counterpart: Dante presented himself as the leading poetic celebrantof virtue in Italian, while Giraut was presented in exactly the same role forhis language group. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s40-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s40-i]]124–126. [part0014.html#c26-s42-e] “Guittone del Viva, more commonly known asFra Guittone d’Arezzo, one of the earliest Italian poets, was born ca. 1240 atSanta Firmina, about two miles from Arezzo. But little is known of the detailsof his life, a great part of which was spent in Florence, where Dante may haveknown him. About the year 1266 Guittone, who was married and had a family,entered the Order of the Frati Gaudenti [Jovial Friars, see Inf. XXIII.103]. In1293 he helped to found the monastery of Sta. Maria degli Angeli at Florence, inwhich city he appears to have died in the following year” (T). Dante, surelyunfairly, is getting even, less perhaps with Guittone than with his admirers,who were many (and continue to exist today). It was not enough for him to haveBonagiunta (Purg. XXIV.56) include him, along with himself, among those whofailed to come up to Dante’s measure. Now Dante uses the great Guinizzelli (whohad indeed come to dislike Guittone’s poetry in reality) to skewer Guittone asecond time, and much more harshly. As early as De vulgari eloquentia (e.g.,I.xiii.1; II.vi.8), Dante had been deprecating Guittone. One may sense a certain“anxiety of influence” at work here, especially since Guittone did so many ofthe things that Dante himself took on as his own tasks: love lyrics, moralcanzoni, and eventually religious poems.On Dante’s rejection of Guittone see Contini (Cont.1976.1), pp. 60–61, thecontributions of Gorni, Antonelli, and Mazzoni in the volume devoted to studiesof Guittone edited by Picone (Pico.1995.1), and Barolini (Baro.1997.1).

[part0014.html#c26-s43-e] Guido’s request speaks now of a better kindof poetry, the Lord’s Prayer, that this other poet can offer in his name inHeaven. He concludes by suggesting an “edit” in the text, namely of that partwhich speaks of leading not into temptation and delivering from evil (Matthew6:13; Luke 11:4). Similarly, in Purgatorio XI.19–24 the penitents do sing thispart of the text, but only on behalf of their earthly brethren, since it nolonger pertains to them.

[part0014.html#c26-s45-e] Guido’s departure reminds the reader thatthose who speak with Dante need to come to the edge of the flame, withoutleaving it, in order to be visible (see vv. 13–15). His disappearance back intothe flames like a fish from the surface of a pond recombines images of fire andwater, as did his opening sally to Dante, in which he speaks of his thirst,while he burns in flame, to know of a living man’s reason for being here.[return to English [part0014.html#c26-s45-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c26-s45-i]]140–147. [part0014.html#c26-s47-e] That Arnaut’s speech forms a littleProvençal poem eight lines in length may reflect, according to Nathaniel Smith(Smit.1980.1), pp. 101–2, the fact that this was generally a favored stanzalength for Provençal poets and indeed of six of the eleven Provençal poems citedby Dante in De vulgari eloquentia. Smith also demonstrates that Dante’s pasticheof Provençal lyric is wider than an imitation of Arnaut, and reflects numerousother poems and poets in the lingua d’oc. He also comments on the deliberate“dumbing down” of Dante’s version of Arnaut’s language (recognized by itsdifficult and elliptical style) in which almost every word of this invented poemhas an obvious Italian (or Latin) cognate (pp. 106–7).Arnaut, like Guido, is now more interested in salvation than in dazzling theworld with verse. These are penitential moments, not ones that encouragethoughts of emulous poetic striving. Giacalone (1968) says it this way: “Thepoet of the trobar clus, who was ever at the ready to make his poems‘concealing,’ now at the end conceals himself, but in the penitential fire.”There seems no question but that Dante was staggered by Arnaut’s virtuosity; andsurely we were staggered, in turn, by Dante’s perhaps most virtuosicversification, heavily indebted to Arnaut, found in the last cantos of Inferno.But now there is no dwelling on the excellence of poetic technique, but ratheron prayer and hopes for the joys of Heaven. Guido’s last words (vv. 92–93),which seem to imply that, unlike Dante, he came to God not in his poetry buteven in spite of it, and Arnaut’s Provençal stanza, which also speaks to liferather than to art, are matched by Dante’s own “sweet new style” here, singingof salvation, the subject it took this poet some time to find again after hisfirst attempt in the concluding chapter of his Vita nuova. In this sense Guido’swords about prayer as poem and Arnaut’s poem, which is a request for prayer,posthumously join these two poets to Dante’s new style, a poetry in tune withGod.

[part0014.html#c27-s1-e] Dante’s simile here, perfect in form, masks itsformal vacuity: “as is the sun in a certain position, so was it then” (e.g., “asa commentator scratches his head in complaint, so did he complain”). Danteenjoys using this sort of comparison. See the note to Inferno XXX.136–141, inwhich reference is made to the study of this phenomenon (sometimes referred toas “false simile” or as “pseudo-simile”) by Eric Mallin (Mall.1984.1).Using his usual four coordinates, each 90 degrees apart from the next(Jerusalem, Spain, India, the antipodes), Dante, like clocks on the wall in anair terminal, tells us the global condition of the time. It is 6 PM now on themountain. At the start of the cantica a similar passage described dawn (Purg.II.1–9), with the sun’s position, with regard to all these coordinates, 180degrees distant from where it is now.

[part0014.html#c27-s2-e] The Angel of Chastity, standing outside theflames along the far edge of the terrace, intones part of the sixth Beatitude(Matthew 5:8), “Blessèd are the clean of heart [for they shall see God].”[return to English [part0014.html#c27-s2-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c27-s2-i]]10–12. [part0014.html#c27-s4-e] This angel has a unique function, since he,like the warder at the gate below, supervises a border beyond which purgation isnot performed; however, unlike the warder, he functions within the territory ofhis terrace and his task is not replicated by an angel on any other terrace. Hesupervises what seems to be a form of final expiation and acceptance thatmirrors Christ’s baptism by fire (Matthew 3:11), as promised by John theBaptist: the Lord whom he serves will baptize “with the Holy Ghost and withfire.” Absent as far as one can tell from the commentary tradition, thiscitation was suggested by an undergraduate at Princeton (Joseph Taylor ’70) manyyears ago. The angel seems to be addressing “blessèd souls” whether in re(Statius) or in potentia (Dante); Virgil, of course, is excluded fromblessedness.Trucchi (1936) observes that this angel seems to be working in collaborationwith a second one (the voice that sings from beyond the fire to draw the finallyfully penitent souls to their new lives in grace), so that we find on thisterrace, uniquely, two angels. See note to vv. 55–57. [return to English[part0014.html#c27-s4-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c27-s4-i]]13–15. [part0014.html#c27-s5-e] Most recent commentators believe that Dantehere refers to a corpse being laid in a grave (e.g., “I became so terrified thatI looked like a dead man”: Benvenuto’s reading). Others, beginning with Lombardi(1791), argue that this fossa (pit, grave [it can mean either; in its lastappearance at Purg. XVIII.121 it meant “grave”]) refers to the deeper andnarrower pit that is used to bury a criminal alive and to which Dante hasearlier referred (Inf. XIX.46–47). However, this form of punishment,propagginazione, involves suffocating a criminal by covering him with earthafter he has been placed upside down in a pit, a posture that does not seemgermane to this passage. Perhaps for this reason most (but not all) recentdiscussants read the line as we do. [return to English [part0014.html#c27-s5-e]/ Italian [part0021.html#c27-s5-i]]16. [part0014.html#c27-s6-e] Exactly what Dante’s physical posture here is hasbeen variously understood. Bosco/Reggio (1979) review a number of thesediscussions and make the sensible suggestion that Dante is holding his handstoward the fire, feeling its heat on them and attempting to keep the rest of hisbody as far as possible from the flame behind those extended hands, while hebends his head toward it, peering into it. Those who argue that Dante has joinedhis hands do not deal with the fact that the other three times in the Comedywhen he uses a form of this past participle of commettere (to commit) it nevermeans “join together,” as most take it to mean here. See Inferno VII.62 andXIX.47, as well as Purgatorio X.57. In other words, he has “committed” his handsto the fire, i.e., stretched them out toward it. [return to English[part0014.html#c27-s6-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c27-s6-i]]17–18. [part0014.html#c27-s6-e] The currently most favored reading of theselines is already found in Tozer (1901): “Burning was a mode of punishment atFlorence at this period, and Dante himself had been condemned to be burnt aliveat the time of his banishment.” In short, Dante, having seen human beings burnedalive in the public square, and having been promised exactly such treatmentshould he ever attempt to return to Florence from his exile, is understandablyfrozen by fear. For him, a man in the flesh, the danger of the fire seems,naturally enough, far greater than it must have to those who were there inspirit only. They, to be sure, suffer mental anguish as they purge their sin oflust in the flames; Dante understandably imagines that the fire will work quitedifferently upon him.

[part0014.html#c27-s7-e] Although it is Virgil who speaks, the narratoragain reminds us of Statius’s continuing presence, even though he has not spokensince Canto XXV.108, when he finished his lecture on the aerial body. He will,in fact, not speak again, though his actions and presence will be recorded untila few lines from the end of the cantica (Purg. XXXIII.135).

[part0014.html#c27-s7-e] Virgil is at pains to remind Dante that herein purgatory the dangers are not those encountered in Inferno. He will notperish in these flames, while he might have been destroyed by Geryon’s envenomedtail or by falling from his back (Inf. XVII.83–84; 95–96; 121). And so, Virgilasks, if Dante could trust him then, how much more can he trust him now? [returnto English [part0014.html#c27-s7-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c27-s7-i]]25–27. [part0014.html#c27-s9-e] See Luke 21:18: “Yet not a hair on your headshall perish.” Jesus is speaking of the terrible time of tribulation that awaitshis followers, which they shall nonetheless survive. Scartazzini (1900) alsocites Paul’s words to his followers, terrified in a storm at sea (Acts 27:34):“For not a hair shall fall from the head of any of you.” [return to English[part0014.html#c27-s9-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c27-s9-i]]28–30. [part0014.html#c27-s10-e] Virgil, having failed to convince Dante evena little, now resorts to scientific experiment, asking him to test a hem of hisclothing in this spiritual fire. As Torraca (1905) pointed out, far credenza(perform a test), was a phrase (found in the second book of Boccaccio’sFilocolo) used for the practice of having a prince’s (or other importantperson’s) food sampled by animals or by servants, expressly charged with thistask, to be sure it had not been poisoned.

[part0014.html#c27-s11-e] In a wonderfully wrought sequence, Virgil hasgiven, rapid-fire, a series of convincing proposals and arguments, along with aconcluding volley of encouragement (vv. 20–32). The poet’s description of theprotagonist, in a single line, Dante’s version of “the soul indeed is willingbut the flesh is weak” (Matthew 26:41), shows that he is now as reluctant as hehas ever been: “against my will, I stood stock still.” [return to English[part0014.html#c27-s11-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c27-s11-i]]37–42. [part0014.html#c27-s13-e] In Ovid’s story (Metam. IV.55–166), the myththat accounts for why the fruit of the mulberry tree is red, Pyramus and Thisbeare neighbors in the Babylon of Queen Semiramis (see Inf. V.58). They are inlove. Since their parents forbid them to marry, they speak to one anotherlovingly through a little gap in the common wall of their houses. They conspireto meet one night at the tomb of Ninus, the dead king, former husband ofSemiramis. Thisbe arrives first but, as luck would have it, a lioness, freshfrom the kill and covered in the blood of the cattle she had slain, seeking afountain to slake her thirst, frightened Thisbe away. The beast, returning fromher drink and finding the cloak that fleeing Thisbe had dropped on the ground,soils that garment with her bloody maw. Pyramus, arriving late for hisassignation, finds the bloodied cloth and assumes the worst. Blaming himself forThisbe’s putative death, he kills himself with his sword. His spurting bloodcolors the white fruit of the mulberry red. Returning, Thisbe finds the body ofher beloved. In anguish she calls out his name and her own, and he opens hiseyes and recognizes her just before he dies. In turn, she uses the sword ofPyramus to take her life.The simile that Dante contrives from this material gives the name of Beatricethe same role as that of Thisbe. Virgil speaks her name just as Thisbe hadspoken her own. In Dante’s case it revives the will to continue toward salvationin a lover who has felt he was at the verge of death, while in the case ofPyramus there is no larger sense of redemption, only a moment of tragicrecognition. Why does Dante construct this similetic moment out of suchantithetic material? His love for Beatrice leads to life, Pyramus’s love forThisbe, to death. When we hear Dante’s name on the lips of Beatrice (Purg.XXX.55), we are in a better position to see the complex relations between thesetwo acts of naming and two kinds of love.On the relations between the mulberry and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good andEvil from which Eve and then Adam ate, as well as the cross on which Christ diedand hung like bloodied fruit, see Moevs (Moev.2000.1), pp. 218–19.

IV.xii.16),relevant here also as an indication of Virgil’s pleasure in regaining his roleas Dante’s teacher and guide, see the note to Purg. XXIV.106–111.

XXVI.16–18) and now we learn thatStatius has been nearest him, with Virgil in the lead. As Bosco/Reggio point out(1979), Virgil’s tactic here is reminiscent of his staying behind Dante toprotect him from Geryon’s sting (Inf. XVII.83–84). Here, however, one might add,Virgil is not worried about protecting Dante, but by the possibility that hewould try to flee back through the flames. And thus Statius is deployed as arearguard, not against any enemy, but against the questionable will of theprotagonist. Further, Virgil, by making Dante come closer, arranges things sothat it is easier to control him. [return to English [part0014.html#c27-s16-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c27-s16-i]]54. [part0014.html#c27-s18-e] Virgil will probably not see those eyes, sincehe will be dismissed from the poem just as Beatrice appears (see Purg. XXX.49),even though he had been subjected to the heat of the fire when he guided Dantethrough it. [return to English [part0014.html#c27-s18-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c27-s18-i]]55–57. [part0014.html#c27-s19-e] The scene we expect, as the protagonistcompletes his ritual purging on a terrace, is the removal of one (in this casethe seventh and last) P from his forehead. Apparently the poet decided to avoidrepresenting this climactic moment, allowing it either to be intrinsic, or elseperhaps allowing us to believe that the fire itself cleansed the protagonist ofhis predisposition toward lust. But this is the moment (not before the entranceto the fire, as some believe) at which the ritual act should be performed, justbefore the upward movement to the next area of the mountain, as it has been onthe other terraces (see an associated discussion of the angels’ recitations ofthe Beatitudes in the note to Purg. XV.38–39).Trucchi (1936) counts the angels who serve God’s ends in Purgatorio and comes upwith ten (the “perfect number,” as he remarks): the Christian Mercury who bringsthe living dead to the mountain (Purg. II.43), the angelic warder at the gate(Purg. IX.104), the seven who are associated with the virtues opposed to thevices repented at the end of the experience of each terrace, and now this one.This final angel of purgatory (in paradise we see Gabriel circling the Virgin[Par. XXIII.103] and then the angelic hierarchy in Paradiso XXVIII) acts as asort of positive Siren, drawing souls away from lust and setting them free.[return to English [part0014.html#c27-s19-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c27-s19-i]]58. [part0014.html#c27-s20-e] As, among the early commentators, only he whospeaks from the pages of the Codice Cassinese pointed out, the passage reflectsthe words that Christ will speak to the just at the Day of Judgment: “Then shallthe King say unto them on his right hand, ‘Come, blessèd of my Father, takepossession of the kingdom prepared for you from the [time of the] foundation ofthe world’ ” (Matthew 25:34). In the twentieth century, notice began again to bepaid to this absolutely relevant text. As Singleton reports (1973), Wilkins(Wilk. 1927.1), p. 5, pointed out that a mosaic in the Florentine Baptisteryshowed a gate guarded by an angel who welcomes a newly arrived soul, while asecond angel leads a group of the saved and carries a banner that is inscribed“Come, blessèd of my Father, possess what has been prepared.” Dante’s second andsinging angel would certainly seem to be modeled on that second angel and hiswords. And that there are two angels on this terrace may reflect his memory ofthe mosaic. [return to English [part0014.html#c27-s20-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c27-s20-i]]61–63. [part0014.html#c27-s21-e] The angel’s words, as many now note, are asort of paraphrase of John 12:35: “Walk while you have the light, that darknessmay not overtake you.” Poletto (1894) seems to have been the first commentatorto notice the correlation. That it should have waited so long to be observed iscomprehensible, since it is not a literal citation so much as a recasting ofJohn’s thought. This second angel, exactly like the first on this terrace, firstspeaks in Latin and then in the vernacular. See, again, the note to PurgatorioXV.38–39.

[part0014.html#c27-s22-e] Bosco/Reggio (1979) point out that, sincethis stair runs from due west to due east and since at the outset of the ascent(Purg. III.16–18) Dante had his back to the east, he has now gone exactlyhalfway around the mountain’s circumference, or 180 degrees. Naturally theactual circumference keeps decreasing as the mountain goes higher, like that ofa snail’s shell. [return to English [part0014.html#c27-s22-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c27-s22-i]]67. [part0014.html#c27-s23-e] Dante’s phrase levare i saggi (tried) suggests aliteral sense of taking a sample of rock, as in geological studies.

[part0014.html#c27-s26-e] Dante’s playfulness is for some reasonparticularly evident in his similes, which often and deliberately have“something wrong” in them, incomplete grammatical relations, mixtures of styles,and other apparent “defects.” Here, on the other hand, we have a perfectlydeveloped and complex “classical” simile: “Just as … and just as … so.” Anyoneexamining the passage closely is likely to perceive that there are things“wrong” here as well. Let us consider the components of the simile: Dante (singular) Virgil and Statius (plural) 76–81 goats (plural) shepherd(singular) 82–84 flock (plural) herdsman (singular) 85–87 goat (singular)shepherds (plural)Several things are worth remarking. This simile is mainly unadulteratedvernacular pastoral with a few Latinate words (and perhaps a phrase from Virgilat line 77 from Georgics IV.10, according to Daniello [1568] and many of thosewho followed him). But why does Dante not get his singulars and plurals straightin the first two elements, only to correct them in the third? Why does heinclude the second element at all, since he excludes it from his summarizing andconcluding third element? And why, as Torraca (1905) wondered, is the shepherdstanding up (if leaning on his stick) while Virgil and Statius are lying down?Is that why, Torraca continued to wonder, Dante included the second element, inwhich the herdsman is at least closer to lying down? The purpose of thesequestions is to focus attention on how much Dante expects of his reader. Theselittle touches, reminding us of his artistic freedom, make us aware of that.[return to English [part0014.html#c27-s26-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c27-s26-i]]77. [part0014.html#c27-s26-e] The phrase rapide e proterve in verse 77 (whichwe have translated as “quick and reckless”), according to some commentators,beginning with Benvenuto (1380), means “rapaces et temerariae” (rapacious andbold). Others have objected to the first of these terms, more fitting todescribe the appetite of a wolf, as being inapplicable to goats. On the otherhand, if we understood the word to mean “voracious,” there would be no suchproblem. We, however, believe that Dante is referring to the way a free-roaminggoat moves, rather than to the way it eats, but have no quarrel with those whofollow Benvenuto.

[part0014.html#c27-s30-e] The stars look bigger and brighter becauseDante is higher up and closer to them than he has ever been in his life. Theremay be a moral atmosphere at work here as well, in that he has lost theobscuring mantle of sin that is our normal lot (see Purg. XXX.3), and that alsowould make them seem brighter.

[part0014.html#c27-s32-e] It is now before dawn on Wednesday morning,the last day on the mountain, from which Dante will depart at noon.“Cytherea” is a proper noun formed from the epithet used of the “maritime”Venus, the lustful goddess born of the spume of the sea near the island Cythera.Dante here presents her as the morning star, as she was seen at the opening ofthe cantica. However, and as has been pointed out in recent years withincreasing insistence, in 1300, Venus was the evening star at this period of theyear, and the morning star only in 1301. See the discussion in Vescovini[Vesc.2002.1], pp. 292, 300n., who resists the temptation to “redate” the poemto 1301, believing that Dante is merely taking advantage of poetic license. Andsee the note to Purgatorio I.19–21.For the formulaic nature of Dante’s preparation of his three dream narratives inPurgatorio see Hollander (Holl.1969.1), p. 149. All the dreams are preceded by“an astronomical reference to the hour of the morning at which the dream occurs”and then by the distinct vocabulary of dream vision, as in the second of thesetercets: “in sogno mi parea / donna vedere” (in a dream I seemed to see a lady).[return to English [part0014.html#c27-s32-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c27-s32-i]]100–108. [part0014.html#c27-s34-e] The dream of Leah and Rachel is the mosttransparent of the three dreams in Purgatorio (see Purg. IX.13–33 and XIX.1–33).Leah and Rachel, the daughters of Laban in Genesis, were understood by Christianinterpreters to represent, respectively, the active life and the contemplativelife (and thus Rachel’s staring into the mirror is not to be taken asnarcissistic self-admiration but contemplation in a positive sense). It is clearthat Dante is making use of that tradition here. However, he is also making useof biblical typology in his treatment of Leah, who is related to Eve in her asyet unfallen condition in that she is doing what Adam and Eve were told to do,“ut operaretur et custodiret illum” (to dress [the garden] and keep it—Genesis2:15). Dante’s verb in the last line of Leah’s speech, which concludes thedream, remembers the biblical verb in his ovrare, the working in this gardenthat points back to the tasks of that one before the Fall (see Holl.1969.1, p.153). For the balanced relationships between the pair Leah and Rachel and asecond pair, Matelda and Beatrice, the two central female presences in theearthly paradise, see Pacchioni (Pacc.2001.1).It is probably also fair to say that the text intrinsically presents Dante as anew Jacob: “As Jacob toiled for seven years in order to gain the hand of Rachel,only to be given that of Leah (Genesis 29:10f.), so Dante has toiled up seventerraces of purgation with the promise of Beatrice, only to find Matelda”(Holl.1969.1, pp. 151–52). Pascoli (Pasc.1902.1), p. 462, had much earliersuggested that Dante, “the new Aeneas,” was also the “new Jacob.” [return toEnglish [part0014.html#c27-s34-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c27-s34-i]]110–111. [part0014.html#c27-s37-e] Awakening, the protagonist (and Statius,but Virgil only problematically so) is associated with travelers who are gettingnearer home. It is quite clear that “home” now is at the very least the gardenof Eden, and perhaps the true paradise that lies above. There are no thoughts ofFlorence here. In these lines the true pilgrimage becomes a journey from God,into the world, and back to God. It is interesting to compare the beautiful andsad opening of the eighth canto of this cantica, with its traveler whosethoughts are on friends left behind in the world.

[part0014.html#c27-s42-e] Since the garden of Eden seems to be justslightly below the level to which the travelers have now climbed (see Purg.XXVIII.4), this topmost step of the stair is the highest point on earth attainedby Dante, and by Virgil as well, but he has no further rising to do.

[part0014.html#c27-s47-e] The precise meaning and reference of thisconcluding verse has been the subject of much discussion. The metaliterary sensethat he has of the canto as a whole leads Picone (Pico.1987.2), pp. 400–401, toallegorize the crown and miter that Virgil awards Dante as (1) the triumphantlaurel of the modern poet and (2) the Christian truth that he can add toVirgil’s store of pagan wisdom and poetic technique. As Fasani (Fasa.2001.1), p.432, points out, although the modern discussion has tended to treat the terms assynonyms, as long ago as in the commentaries of the Ottimo (1333) and ofFrancesco da Buti (1385) they were understood as separate entities. To theOttimo they signified “rector and shepherd”; to Francesco, laurel crown(“corono; di laurea, come poeta”) and bishop’s miter (“come vescovo e guidatoredell’anima tua a l’eterna salute” [as bishop and guide over your own soul, boundfor eternal salvation]), two very different sorts of adornment for Dante’s head.Fasani opts for the crown as a sign of Dante’s active life, his temporal (anddecidedly imperial) political mission, and sees the miter as an image of hiscontemplative life, the poet’s spiritual mission.Virgil can make Dante neither an emperor nor a bishop (and surely not a pope).He is metaphorically crowning Dante for now having, in his will, the ability torule himself morally, as the world, were it only better governed, would be ruledby two powers, emperor and pope. Dante is now said by Virgil to be in completecommand of the powers of his will, a microcosmic image of the world made just(improbable as Dante would have thought such a happy state) under its two primeauthorities.

[part0014.html#c28-s1-e] We enter the third and final part of the cantica.These divisions, antipurgatorium (the first naming of “ante-purgatory” in thecommentaries), purgatorium, and postpurgatorium, are found in Benvenuto da Imola(1380).Dante’s first word, vago (eager) ties him to Ulysses, eager for adventure (forthe word vago see note to Purg. XIX.22–24). Virgil had told him, in his finalinstruction (Purg. XXVII.138), that in the garden he will be free either to sit(thus imitating Rachel, the contemplative life) or to move about (thus imitatingLeah, the active life). We should not be surprised that Dante makes the latterchoice. Since, as we shall see, his contemplative faculties are at this pointfaulty at best, his choice will be reflected in his intellectual difficultieswith understanding the nature of the love represented by the beautiful woman hewill shortly meet (and who is eventually identified as Matelda).Matelda will only be named at Purgatorio XXXIII.119. It may be helpful to thereader to deal with her identity and her role in the poem before then. However,the reader should not forget that Dante has presented this woman as nameless,perhaps, among other reasons, to make us pay attention to what she means ratherthan concentrating on who she is. For the question of her identity, see the noteto vv. 40–42. [return to English [part0014.html#c28-s1-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c28-s1-i]]2. [part0014.html#c28-s1-e] This forest is sacred, in the words of Andreoli(1856), “because it was planted by the very hands of God.” Many discussants ofthe opening of this canto realize that the poet is drawing a line across thepage between the last canto and this one. Dante has finished the first half ofthe journey and now he finds himself in a very different sort of forest from thedark wood in which he came to his senses at the opening of Inferno. That woodwas “aspra e forte” (dense and harsh [Inf. I.5]) while this forest is “spessa eviva” (thick and verdant).It is instructive and amusing to consider the opening remarks of Benvenuto daImola (1380) as he addresses this canto: “Before I come to its literal meaning,I would like you first to note that this entire chapter is figurative andallegorical, for otherwise it would in large measure be fatuous and untrue.”Benvenuto is essentially denying the claim made by the poet that this is theactual garden of Eden. He goes on to assert that the garden signifies “the happystate of man in the perfection of his virtue, as much as is possible in thismiserable life of ours.” Benvenuto’s commentary, which remains one of the mostintelligent and helpful ever written, has a blind eye for many of Dante’stheological strategies.

[part0014.html#c28-s2-e] In this forest Dante the sightseer can move lentolento (very slowly), enjoying his surroundings. Here he will not be subject tothe fear that afflicted him in the selva oscura. [return to English[part0014.html#c28-s2-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c28-s2-i]]7–9. [part0014.html#c28-s3-e] The gentle breeze, as we shall learn (vv.85–87), surprises Dante, who had expected to find no meteorological disturbanceof any kind in the garden. It strikes upon his brow, perhaps reminding us thatthat was where the seven P’s were inscribed on him by the warder of thepurgatorial gate (Purg. IX.112). He is, as was Adam when he found himself inthis place 6,499 years ago (see Par. XXVI.119–123), innocent. Unlike Adam, Dantewill not fall in it.

[part0014.html#c28-s4-e] From the westward movement of the boughs ofthe trees we learn that the wind in the garden blows from the east, a propitioussource, since it is associated with the rising sun and thus with Christ, oftenrepresented as the sun climbing the sky, resurrected from the darkness of death.[return to English [part0014.html#c28-s4-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c28-s4-i]]13–18. [part0014.html#c28-s5-e] The morning breeze does not disturb the birdsplying their crafts (singing and nesting, according to John of Serravalle[1416], but surely flying as well). Lest the reader believe these birds areactually birds, Benvenuto (1380) reveals what they “really” represent: “wise andvirtuous men, who rise to the heights of virtue and joyfully sing their praiseof God.” An allegorical temper can steal the joy from any poem.The harmony of birdsong and forest murmur, treble and bass, respectively, revealthe favorable conjunction of art (the birdsong) and nature (the wind in thetrees) in Eden.

[part0014.html#c28-s7-e] The sound of the forest is compared to thatmade by the trees in the great pine forest near Ravenna when it is stirred bythe strong wind from Africa, released, at least in myth, from Aeolus’s bag ofthe winds.The image of wind making melody on a natural instrument, the Aeolian harp,became a staple of Romantic literature.

[part0014.html#c28-s8-e] Insisting again on the slowness, and thus thecalm, of his progress (see verse 5), Dante implicitly contrasts his entranceinto the world of sin in the first canto of the poem with his arrival in thegarden. Here, just as there, he takes stock by looking back through a woodtoward his point of entrance: “How I came there I cannot really tell, / I was sofull of sleep / when I forsook the one true way” (Inf. I.10–12), but thedifferences between the two places overwhelm their similarities. [return toEnglish [part0014.html#c28-s8-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c28-s8-i]]25–27. [part0014.html#c28-s9-e] This stream is Lethe, the river of oblivion inclassical literature, in which Christians in Dante’s Eden leave the memory oftheir sins behind them for eternity, as Matelda will explain (vv. 127–128).[return to English [part0014.html#c28-s9-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c28-s9-i]]32–33. [part0014.html#c28-s11-e] Beginning with Tommaseo (1837), commentatorshave suggested a source in Ovid (Metam. V.388–391) for the shaded garden here,the Sicilian scene of Proserpina’s rape (see vv. 49–51), where the forests abovethe pools in the hills of Enna keep them protected from Apollo’s rays. [returnto English [part0014.html#c28-s11-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c28-s11-i]]40–42. [part0014.html#c28-s14-e] The fascination of the character introducedanonymously here (we will not find out her name until Purgatorio XXXIII.119) hasproven so great that in Dante studies there is practically a separate industrydevoted to problems associated with her identity and her significance. Theposition taken in what follows is based on the following given: Matelda (that isthe name that we eventually hear, and it is spelled with an “e” [and not an “i”]in all the manuscripts consulted by Petrocchi) is not “allegorical” buthistorical. Almost all the early commentators believe that she is Matilda ofTuscany (1046–1115). Their cases pleaded from ca. 1860 on, the two principalother historical claimants to the role are thirteenth-century German nuns,Mechthild of Magdeburg and Mechthild of Hackeborn, but they have both beenmainly abandoned in recent and current discussions. Starting in the nineteenthcentury there was a reaction against all such historical figures and, led byScartazzini, once he came over to this view, an attempt to establish heridentity as one of the other women in Dante’s Vita nuova, a position givensupport in our own era by so eminent a student of the Commedia as Contini(Cont.1976.1), pp. 173–74. A calmer and more sensible survey than Scartazzini’sis found in Moore (Moor.1903.1), pp. 210–16; he ends up cautiously maintainingthe claim of Matilda of Tuscany. As opposed to the nuns, who are contemplatives,Matelda’s service to the Church is clearly related to the active life, basedprecisely on the Church’s own favorite mode of the laity’s involvement:financial support. None of the young women in the Vita nuova are easilyunderstood in any such role.Matilda of Tuscany, by mere virtue of having so much support in the earlycommentaries (the first real opposition to her occurs only in Venturi [1732]),is probably the most intelligent choice. For an attempt to restore her identitysee Villa (Vill.1987.1). However, she is nonetheless problematic for at leastthree reasons. (1) She was fiercely supportive of the political claims of theChurch against the emperor; (2) she is presented here as a beautiful youngwoman, which little accords with her descriptions in the chronicles, which makeher seem little less than a virago, a female soldier, and surely less “romantic”than would accord with such a portrait as Dante’s; (3) since the function sheperforms in the garden seems to be universal (but there is debate about this,with some believing that she is only here for Dante’s visit [see note to Purg.XXXIII.128–135]), the fact that she could not have begun her task until 1115 isa bar to her candidacy. This, however, is true for all candidates, as it wasnot, for instance, for that other genius loci, Cato (presiding over purgatory asMatelda presides over Eden), who died before Christ harrowed hell, before therewere any souls in purgatory, and who thus was able to take up his function onlywhen there were those who required it.Someone (it may have been Charles Singleton) once made the remark that if we didnot know Matelda’s name we would know much more readily who she is. In her rolein the garden of Eden she is, there can hardly be a doubt, a representation ofunfallen Eve.As the “new” (or “original old” or “perpetually new”) Eve, she makes sense. Sherepresents the active life that Leah led us to expect in her (as Rachelassociates Beatrice with the contemplative life) and she can have been here fromthe beginning of purgation. And it is also true that, in Genesis, unfallen Eveis never named; she is only named after the fall, when Adam calls his wife “Eve”(Genesis 3:20). Matelda, too, is named belatedly. [return to English[part0014.html#c28-s14-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c28-s14-i]]43–51. [part0014.html#c28-s15-e] Here the reader should probably be aware of adistinction between what the poet knows of Matelda’s significance and what thecharacter makes of her. A strategic awareness of the evident difference inperspective between narrator and character as a general aspect of the poem is,surprisingly enough, a fairly recent development. See Spitzer (Spit.1946.1), pp.414–22; Singleton (Sing.1949.1), p. 25; Contini (Cont.1976.1 [1958]), pp. 33–62;Montano (Mont.1962.1), pp. 367–76. [return to English [part0014.html#c28-s15-e]/ Italian [part0021.html#c28-s15-i]]43–48. [part0014.html#c28-s15-e] Dante sees that Matelda is “in love” andwants to understand what she is singing. The response of Venturi (1732)indicates that the current debate was already in progress nearly three hundredyears ago. He takes Matelda to be singing “of divine love and not, as someignorant fools understand, of the bestial kind.” However, many commentators,aroused by the sensual tone of the protagonist’s responses, disagree.The first major use of Guido Cavalcanti’s poem, “In un boschetto trova’pasturella” (In a little wood I came upon a shepherd girl), to amplify themeaning of this scene was made by Charles Singleton (Sing.1958.1), pp. 214–16,even if he was not the first to call attention to its importance here (seeScartazzini [1900]). This ballata is in a genre worked previously by dozens ofFrench and Provençal poets, a genre in which poets who more usually wrote songsabout unattainable ladies had their “revenge,” as it were. The pastourelle orpastorella (the genre is named for the willing and socially unimportantshepherdess it celebrates) generally, as in Cavalcanti’s lyric, has a highbornprotagonist ride into a clearing in a wood where he finds a lovely and willingyoung woman who gives him sexual pleasure at his merest request (indeed, inCavalcanti’s poem, it is she who proposes the amorous encounter to him). Anystudy of this ballata makes it immediately clear that Dante had it on his mindas he composed this canto.Once we see Guido’s poem behind Dante’s we can also discern an authorialstrategy behind its presence. Matelda does not come as a shepherdess, but as theunfallen Eve, virginal, upright, completely uninterested in sex. It is theprotagonist, his head full of Cavalcantian sexuality, who imagines she is inlove with him, just like a pretty pastorella. It will take him some time todiscover the wrongness of his view of her, and some of his readers still havenot made that discovery. [return to English [part0014.html#c28-s15-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c28-s15-i]]49–51. [part0014.html#c28-s17-e] The protagonist first associates Matelda withOvid’s Proserpina (Metam. v.391–401), seen, grasped, and carried off by Pluto.Dante, who has begun this scene believing that Matelda is in love with him, nowlets his erotic misinterpretation show; he thinks he is in the role of Pluto toher Proserpina because he thinks she is a pastorella.

[part0014.html#c28-s18-e] Playing off Dante’s carnal appreciation ofher meaning, Matelda comes closer so that he can hear the words of her song,thus acceding to his request. She is portrayed, in simile, as being as chaste asvirginity itself. [return to English [part0014.html#c28-s18-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c28-s18-i]]59–60. [part0014.html#c28-s20-e] Dante’s wish, expressed at verse 48, to makeout the words of Matelda’s song is here granted. Few texts in the poem have beenas poorly treated by the commentators as this one. The protagonist’s wish madeus want to know what Matelda was singing; and here we learn that Dante now canmake out her words. However, the poet does not tell us what she sang. It is atleast possible that he expected us to puzzle out the identity of her song. Noone has. Perhaps it is the Psalm to which she refers at verse 80, perhaps it isanother song altogether. Our teachers, with only one exception, are silent,merely saying the obvious, that Dante understood what she was singing, and, withonly the exceptions of Isidoro Del Lungo (1926) and Charles Singleton (1973),not even bothering to point out that the poet refuses to share this informationwith us. About all that can safely be said is that she probably sings a songthat is kindred in spirit to the Psalm to which she later refers (see note tovv. 80–81).

[part0014.html#c28-s22-e] Matelda’s gaze, the poet remembers, was likethe amorous gaze of Venus, wounded by mistake by the arrow of her son, Cupid,and consequently madly in love with Adonis, in a second Ovidian reminiscence(Metam. X.525–532). [return to English [part0014.html#c28-s22-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c28-s22-i]]67–69. [part0014.html#c28-s23-e] Matelda, resuming her role as a latter-dayLeah (and Eve as well), picks the self-seeding plants the nature of which shewill disclose to Dante at vv. 109–120. [return to English[part0014.html#c28-s23-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c28-s23-i]]70–75. [part0014.html#c28-s24-e] The first reference is to the Persian kingXerxes, who found a way to cross the wide Hellespont in 480 B.C. by having hisvast army build a bridge out of ships lashed together; defeated by the Greekswhom he was attacking, he had to sail home in ignominy in a small boat.The sight of this lady moved the protagonist, the poet informs us, to lustfulthoughts like those of Leander, unable to cross the rough seas of theDardanelles from Abydos to make love to his girlfriend Hero at Sestos, the thirdOvidian reference, this time to the Heroides (XVIII). Leander finally drowned inhis attempt to swim to Hero.These three classical allusions to destructive sexual passions, aligningMatelda, in the protagonist’s eyes, with Proserpina, Venus, and Hero, andhimself with Pluto, Adonis, and Leander, function, as Hollander suggested(Holl.1969.1), pp. 154–58, much as did the associations with the dream inPurgatorio IX, in which three classical references, involving rape or otherdestructive behavior, were balanced and corrected by the Christian benevolenceof St. Lucy. Here the protagonist’s sexualized vision of Matelda yields to abetter understanding once she reveals the nature of her love: Christian charity.Once she does so, the protagonist, whose will came through his self-producedtemptation well enough (he does not attempt to cross the narrow stream to bewith her), finally has his understanding corrected and no longer thinks ofMatelda in sexual terms for the rest of his six cantos in the garden.

[part0014.html#c28-s24-e] Some readers have found the three paces thatmust not yet be crossed allegories of the three “steps” of confession,contrition, and satisfaction that await Dante later when he must deal withBeatrice’s accusation in Cantos XXX and XXXI.

[part0014.html#c28-s26-e] Matelda, who has appeared at verse 40,finally speaks. Addressing all three poets (we have surely forgotten about thepresence of Statius and of Virgil—as has Dante), she says things that at leastStatius and Dante are able to understand. They are “new” (in the sense that theyhave never been here before but also in that they are “new men,” remade,sinless) and perhaps expect to hear a lament for the Fall, for the loss of thisplace by the human race because of original sin. Her message, however, is notthe tragic message of the Fall but the comic one of recovery, of paradiseregained. [return to English [part0014.html#c28-s26-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c28-s26-i]]76. [part0014.html#c28-s26-e] With regard to the word rido: Matelda isprobably not laughing, as some hold, but smiling; see König (Koni.2001.1), p.441, citing Convivio III.viii.8 for a smile as the shining forth of delight inthe soul.

[part0014.html#c28-s27-e] Psalm 91 (92), “A Psalm or Song for thesabbath day,” begins as follows: “It is a good thing to give thanks unto theLord, and to sing praises unto your name, O most High.” The verse that Mateldarefers to, 91:5 in the Vulgate, runs as follows in the English Bible: “For you,Lord, have made me glad (delectasti me) through your work: I will triumph in thework of your hands” (92:4). Matelda is expressing her Leah-like devotion to theactive life, her delight in “dressing and keeping the garden” as Eve wasenjoined to do (but did not, eating the forbidden fruit instead). She is onceagain joined in our understanding to the unfallen Eve, her constant typologicalreferent in Dante’s garden of Eden. If we ever had any doubt about the nature ofthe love she feels, we do so no longer. She is “in love” with God, not withDante except as she loves him in God, as we shall see all the saved loving oneanother (and Dante) in Paradiso.In his Monarchia (Mon. III.xv.7), Dante says that the earthly paradise signifiesthe beatitudo huius vitae (the blessedness of the earthly life).

[part0014.html#c28-s30-e] Once again Matelda refers to Dante’s mentalprocesses as “beclouded” or “befogged”; first he did not understand the natureof her love (verse 81) and now he does not understand the nature of the garden.[return to English [part0014.html#c28-s30-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c28-s30-i]]91–102. [part0014.html#c28-s31-e] Matelda essentially repeats what Statius hadsaid below (see note to vv. 85–87): God limits the natural meteorology of themountain to the ante-purgatory. The first humans, Adam and Eve, were placed inthis spot free of any such disturbance; but they themselves, in theirdisobedience, disturbed the laws of eternal nature in the garden (vv. 94–96).[return to English [part0014.html#c28-s31-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c28-s31-i]]103–120. [part0014.html#c28-s35-e] The “weather” here is thus not the sign ofsome kind of disturbance, but was, from the Beginning, the sign of theharmonious essence of the created universe. The breeze in the garden, limited tothis upper reach of the mountain, was (and is) caused by the movement of thehighest sphere in the heavens, the primum mobile, the first moving (which, wewill learn eventually, in Paradiso, moves toward God in desire and by so doingcreates the movement of all the heavens below it). That breeze scatters theseeds of most (but not all) of the plants of Eden down onto the earth below. Andthis is why, she explains, that mortals at times cannot find the source of aplant new to their experience; it has been carried by the wind from Eden andthen somehow across the seas of the southern hemisphere and deposited in thelandmass half a world away. And this is why Dante will also see some plants herethat have no counterpart on earth. [return to English [part0014.html#c28-s35-e]/ Italian [part0021.html#c28-s35-i]]121–126. [part0014.html#c28-s41-e] Having explained the source and result ofthe constant breeze in the garden, Matelda turns to the equally constant water,which also does not suffer the changes of water in our world, condensing andthen being released from the clouds (consider the transformations of the Arno’swaters in Purg. XIV.34–36). What the rivers here “lose” as they run out of Edenis not restored from the clouds, but from an eternal fountain in the garden, putinto operation by God Himself. [return to English [part0014.html#c28-s41-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c28-s41-i]]127–132. [part0014.html#c28-s43-e] Having answered both of Dante’s questions(vv. 85–87) Matelda now turns her attention to the twofold river in this garden.The Bible says there are four rivers in Eden: the Phison (Ganges), Gehon (Nile),Tigris, and Euphrates (Genesis 2:10–14). Dante says there are two, Lethe andEunoe. The first of these is looked forward to by Virgil (Inf. XIV.136–138) inresponse to Dante’s wrongful assumption that it is a river in hell. The second,Eunoe, appears to be no less than a Dantean invention. Thus Dante has first ofall reduced the number of the garden’s rivers from four to two.Lethe is the classical river of oblivion, present in the poets best known toDante: Virgil (Aen. VI.713–715, where drinking from it deprives the soul of itsentire remembered experience and thus prepares it for another life), Ovid(Metam. XI.602–604), Statius (Theb. I.296–298), Lucan (Phars. V.221–222). As forthe word Eunoe, a Dantean Greek-derived coinage, Tommaseo (1837, in his commentto Purg. XXXIII.127–129) was perhaps the first commentator to consider Dante ashaving cited himself (Convivio II.iii.11), when he says that the Empyrean heavenwas formed by the divine mind alone, or Protonoe (protos = first; nous = mind).Here Dante reformulates that Greek term, itself derived by Uguccione da Pisafrom Martianus Capella (see Vasoli [Vaso.1988.1], p. 138n.), into eu (good) andnous (mind—or here perhaps “memory”). [return to English[part0014.html#c28-s43-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c28-s43-i]]133. [part0014.html#c28-s45-e] There is some disagreement among thecommentators as to whether the rivers’ water taken as a whole (i.e., that ofboth Lethe and Eunoe) is sweeter than any other taste, or whether Eunoe’s wateris even sweeter than Lethe’s, as our translation indicates that we believe.[return to English [part0014.html#c28-s45-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c28-s45-i]]136. [part0014.html#c28-s46-e] Chiamenti (Chia.1999.2), pp. 214–15, citingLewis and Short’s Latin Dictionary, argues for the classical Latin meaning forthe word “corollary” here, a present or gratuity (e.g., a gift of money offeredin exchange for a garland of flowers), as filtered through Old French poemsdescribing ladies in gardens. While we have left the term intact in ourtranslation, we agree with Chiamenti’s inclination to read it in the floraltradition of Romance poems, since the whole passage is so redolent of suchscenes. [return to English [part0014.html#c28-s46-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c28-s46-i]]139–141. [part0014.html#c28-s47-e] When they were inspired on their holymountain, Parnassus (that is, when they were most inspired by their muses), theclassical poets sang of the age of gold (e.g., Ovid in the beginning of theMetamorphoses, Virgil in his fourth Eclogue). In doing so, they perhaps had someintimation of this place, scene of the true “golden age,” where mankind wascreated in innocence and joy. [return to English [part0014.html#c28-s47-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c28-s47-i]]142–144. [part0014.html#c28-s48-e] Ovid’s description of the classical “Eden”(Metam. I.89–112) is remembered closely in this tercet. One of its particularsis arresting. Where Dante makes his springtime eternal, in Ovid (Metam. I.107)it became ephemeral and now leaves us every year: “ver erat aeternum” (thespring was everlasting). The drama of the Fall and Resurrection is reflected inthis tercet. In this garden humankind was created innocent and fell;nonetheless, the garden awaits our redemption in its eternal unfallen condition,filled with the nectar and ambrosia of the classical Golden Age in its Edenicform: fruit and water (see Purg. XXII.148–150).Singleton (Sing.1958.1), pp. 192–99, points out that the virgin Astraea, orJustice, is a significant presence in both Ovid’s and Virgil’s presentations ofthe Golden Age, the last goddess to leave the earth in Ovid’s myth, only toreturn in Virgil’s prophecy. And just so, for Singleton, does Matelda serve inthe role of Astraea here in Dante’s garden, representing original justice (aswell as our memory of the unfallen Eve). [return to English[part0014.html#c28-s48-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c28-s48-i]]146–147. [part0014.html#c28-s49-e] The protagonist’s series of smiles(beginning at Purg. XXI.109), caused by his pleasure in the prospect of the joythat Statius will experience once he discovers that he is in the company ofVirgil, is now matched by the two smiling countenances of those two poets asthey understand, through Matelda’s “corollary,” that they have finally found thetrue Golden Age. [return to English [part0014.html#c28-s49-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c28-s49-i]]PURGATORIO XXIX1–3. [part0014.html#c29-s1-e] Echoing Guido Cavalcanti (see the note to Purg.XXVIII.43–48), the poet begins this canto by returning to the situation that wefound early in the last one: Dante thinking that a beautiful young woman was inlove with him. Now the poet himself seems to confirm this. We, nonetheless,probably realize that the song Matelda sings is once again utterly differentfrom the sexually charged pastorella and is indeed once again a Psalm (31:1[32:1]): “Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins arecovered.” As Singleton (1973) points out, St. Paul (Romans 4:3–8) interpretsthis Psalm as indicating God’s reward for just humans. However, this is not, inshort, to “fuse” the “theme of profane love” with that of “charity, love of ahigher order” (Singleton [1973]), but simultaneously to include and supersedeit. Matelda is a very different sort of “shepherd girl” from the one we found inCavalcanti; that seems to be Dante’s main point. She does indeed love theprotagonist, but she is not in love with him, as he at first believed. The wordthat describes her affective state, innamorata (touched by love), here appearsfor the first time in the poem. It seems to collocate itself in the Cavalcantianworld of sexual love. However, as a graduate student at Princeton, SheilaColwell, pointed out in the spring of 1984, the verb innamorare, in an inflectedform or as a past participle, will be used eight more times in Paradiso, alwaysto indicate, as we may realize either now or retrospectively, heavenlyaffection. [return to English [part0014.html#c29-s1-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c29-s1-i]]4–6. [part0014.html#c29-s2-e] Why are these two groups of nymphs made part ofthe simile, when Dante and Matelda are moving near one another and in the samedirection? Benvenuto (1380) glosses the tercet simply. In the old days somenymphs wanted to leave the shade for the sun, while others desired to leave thesun for the shade. Beginning with Tommaseo (1837), some commentators havesuggested a relationship with Virgil’s two bands of nymphs (Georgics IV.383),one hundred guarding the woods, another one hundred guarding the streams(“centum quae silvas, centum quae flumina servant”). Neither the gloss nor thecitation, however, answers the question, above, that has bothered manycommentators, none more than Porena (1946), who posits a lost classical sourceto explain our puzzlement but has not convinced others of this hypothesis. Itwould seem that Dante wishes to express only the thought that, just as in thedistant (classical) past nymphs would move purposefully from one place toanother in the forest, so did he and Matelda move from where they had beenstanding to go somewhere else. However, the brightness that they shall soon findwould seem intrinsically to associate them with those nymphs who move from shadeto sunshine. [return to English [part0014.html#c29-s2-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c29-s2-i]]7–12. [part0014.html#c29-s3-e] Since the stream normally flows east to westbut now makes a 90-degree veer to the north, Matelda, followed by Dante, headssouth for fifty paces until it makes a second 90-degree bend, and they are onceagain heading due east. Why the poet wanted to have this bend in the river,which accomplishes the removal of Dante and Matelda to a point some fifty feetsouth of where they had been and from which they resume movement in an easterlydirection, has not been clear to the commentators. [return to English[part0014.html#c29-s3-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c29-s3-i]]15. [part0014.html#c29-s5-e] Matelda’s addressing Dante as “frate” (brother)reminds him (and the reader) of his earlier misunderstanding of the nature ofher affection for him (see Purg. XXVIII.43–45). [return to English[part0014.html#c29-s5-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c29-s5-i]]16–21. [part0014.html#c29-s6-e] The lustrous presence is so bright that theprotagonist, forgetting his recent and abundant instruction by Matelda on theabsence of “real” weather here (Purg. XXVIII.85–126), at first takes thisshining for lightning, until its duration makes it clear that it is somethingaltogether other. In this way the poet builds suspense for the pageant yet tocome.It is probably not without purpose that, near the beginning of each of thesecantos (XXVIII and XXIX), in which his will is finally integral and good (seePurg. XXVII.140 and note to XXVII.139–141), Dante reveals that his problems nowcenter in his weak understanding. Thus this second part of the poem anchorsitself in the program of the correction of his intellect, which will last untilParadiso XXX. (See the note to Purg. XXVII.139–141.) [return to English[part0014.html#c29-s6-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c29-s6-i]]22–30. [part0014.html#c29-s8-e] The protagonist hears a melody (we will beallowed to know its lyric component at verse 51) so beautiful that righteousindignation causes him to condemn Eve for depriving him of immortal life in thisbeautiful garden.The veil that she would not accept is variously glossed, from the firstcommentators onward, either as being negative (ignorance) or positive(obedience), and some (e.g., Grabher [1934]) have believed that it has bothvalences. [return to English [part0014.html#c29-s8-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c29-s8-i]]31–33. [part0014.html#c29-s11-e] The primizie (first fruits) are the firstfruits of God’s eternal love as these are found here in Eden, “this foretaste ofeternal bliss,” promising the joys of eternity. [return to English[part0014.html#c29-s11-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c29-s11-i]]36. [part0014.html#c29-s12-e] This second reference to the growing intensityof this son et lumière again whets the reader’s appetite to know what lies justahead (see verse 21). [return to English [part0014.html#c29-s12-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c29-s12-i]]37–42. [part0014.html#c29-s13-e] This is the fourth of the Commedia’s nineinvocations (see the note to Inf. II.7–9).Fallani (1965) rightly explains that “the marvelous vision is entirely containedin the poet’s memory” and that Dante now requires aid only in finding thecorrect words to express it. (See the note to Inferno XXXII.10–12 in response toa similar second invocation in the first cantica.) In other words, he nowrequires aid from holy Muses to express in poetry the deeper truth of what hehas seen in the pageant representing the Church Triumphant. For the increasingimportance of the notion of a prior “conception” of God’s truth to Dante’sevolving self-presentation as poet, see the note to Inferno XXXII.1–9 andHollander (Holl.2001.1), p. 59.Two authors stand behind this passage, as has been variously understood in thecommentary tradition. The first is St. Paul (II Corinthians 11:27): “in laborand hardships, in many a vigil, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in coldand nakedness.” Paul tells us of his trials and tribulations that prepared himfor his visionary rapture, when he was taken up into the third heaven (IICorinthians 12:2). The first commentator to make this connection, which nowseems fairly obvious, was apparently Torraca (1905). The context fits: we areabout to witness a Pauline vision (one which happens, however, to be moreJohannine in nature, as we shall see). However, there is another source, a muchless apparently appropriate one, given the religious context of the entirescene: Virgil’s invocation in his seventh book (Aeneid VII.641): “now,goddesses, cast Helicon forth and move your song”: “Helicon, celebrated range ofmountains in Boeotia, sacred to Apollo and the Muses, in which rose the famousfountains of the Muses, Aganippe and Hippocrene. Dante (perhaps through amisunderstanding of Aen. VII.641; X.163) speaks of Helicon itself as a fountain”(T). (He may, on the other hand, be indicating all the sources of poeticexpression by their common site.) This invocation in Virgil’s poem marks thetransition to the “Iliadic” military second half of the epic. That might notseem particularly promising as a parallel here. On the other hand, just asVirgil, some 600 lines into the second half of his martial epic places anotherinvocation, so does Dante, some 185 lines into the second half of histheological epic, insert one of his. For the first notice of the Virgilianreference see Tommaseo (1837). For the meaning of the word mercé (translated as“reward”), we follow the reasoning of Bosco/Reggio (1979), who argue that themore common understanding (“aid” or “help”) is countered by the rhetoric of thetercet, in which Dante presents himself as having suffered for the Muses and asnow claiming what is due him.As for Urania, here the highest of the Muses and their leader (where Calliope,muse of epic, had held that role in Purg. I.9–12), as the muse of astronomy, of“high things,” she is needed to give the poet fit words to convey the conceptualtruth of the pageant to come. Dante has seen it, but now, coming to write of it,he requires an understanding of its theological meaning in order to give itproper expression. [return to English [part0014.html#c29-s13-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c29-s13-i]]42. [part0014.html#c29-s14-e] The thoughts behind the verses are “hard”because of their exalted and difficult subject—allegories of the Bible—accordingto De Fazio (DeFa.1993.1), p. 435. [return to English [part0014.html#c29-s14-e]/ Italian [part0021.html#c29-s14-i]]43–45. [part0014.html#c29-s15-e] Like Matelda, who also seemed other than whatshe finally comes to mean to the protagonist, the seven candlesticks (verse 50)are perceived first and erroneously by him as seven trees. Carroll (1904)comments upon them as follows: “They represent the seven ‘gifts of the Spirit,’as named in the Vulgate of Isaiah 11:2–3, namely, Wisdom, Intellect, Counsel,Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, and Fear of the Lord.” Dante discusses them inConvivio IV.xxi.11–12. [return to English [part0014.html#c29-s15-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c29-s15-i]]47–51. [part0014.html#c29-s16-e] The “common object” is a technical termderived from Scholastic discussions of sense perception. Strictly speaking, itrefers to things that can be perceived simultaneously by more than one of thefive senses (e.g., taste and touch and perhaps smell for something in one’smouth; or sight, smell, and hearing [an animal in a field]) and are thus morelikely to be misperceived. For instance, one might have a pebble in one’s mouthand smell a clove and think the pebble is a candy; or one might be looking at ahorse in the distance in a cow pasture and smell manure, thus taking horse forcow. Dante discusses the term as the sensibile comune (that which is perceivableby several senses) in Convivio III.ix.6.Dante here has two senses in play, sight and hearing. He was thus at firstunable to make out what is being uttered (see verse 36) nor what is present atthe uttering. By now he realizes that the “trees” are candlesticks and the song“Hosanna.” Dante is, strictly speaking, “cheating,” in that it is not thecombination of confused senses that caused his problem, but merely distance, ineach case.The word Osanna, an untranslatable expression of joyous praise, is Dante’s mostfrequent Hebraism in the Comedy (see the note to Purg. XI.11). It derives fromthe salute to Jesus offered as he enters Jerusalem (Matthew 21:19 [“Hosanna inaltissimis”]; Mark 11:10 [“Hosanna in excelsis”]).

[part0014.html#c29-s18-e] The candlesticks, now seen as a single shape,are all flaming at their tips, brighter than the full moon at its apex in thesky on a clear night. This image, and many that are to follow, reflect passagesin the Book of Revelation, here Apocalypse 4:5, the seven lamps burning beforethe great throne of Judgment, “which are the seven spirits of God,” as was firstnoted by Pietro di Dante (1340).

[part0014.html#c29-s19-e] For a useful discussion of the meaning ofstupore (amazement) see De Fazio (DeFa.1993.1), pp. 436–45. She considers thispassage alongside its precursor, with which it has evident similarities (Purg.XXVIII.139–148), in which Statius and Virgil smile at the revelation that thisplace, the earthly paradise, was what they understood as Parnassus. Now Danteseeks only to see the reaction of Virgil to the pageant of Revelation and findsthat his guide is amazed as are those who cannot understand, for all theirwonder and reverence, what they are gazing at. Thus, for her, Dante’sammirazione and Virgil’s stupore have different valences. For this to beVirgil’s final observed behavior in the poem shows Dante’s desire to control hisadmiration for his auctor.

[part0014.html#c29-s20-e] The reference to the modest gait of newly weddedbrides as they leave the church to go to their husband’s house introduces thetheme of the wedding ceremony to the procession and to the poem, where it willreappear in a number of guises, including parody, throughout the rest of thescenes in the earthly paradise.

[part0014.html#c29-s21-e] Matelda calls Dante’s and our attention towhat will be, at that moment, the theological high point in the poem, thepageant of the Church Triumphant. For useful studies of the entirety of thescene that follows, see Moore (Moor.1903.1), pp. 178–220, “The ApocalypticVision”; Cristaldi (Cris.1988.1); Pertile (Pert.1998.2), pp. 23–42 (for theparticular relevance of the Song of Songs).

For the iconography and meaning of the symbolic elements init, see Friedman (Frie.1987.1).

[part0014.html#c29-s22-e] Those dressed in the white of faith in Christto come (we will soon find out that they represent the Hebrew Scriptures) arepresented as followers of the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit or of the sevenspirits of God (Apocalypse 4:4), not as the leaders they surely were on theirown terms.

[part0014.html#c29-s23-e] Dante, facing east, has the stream to hisleft, as he has all along, and sees the pageant approach him on the far side ofthe narrow water.That the poet emphasizes his left side so strongly may indicate his sense of hismortal unworthiness to look upon such wonders.

The ten paces that separate the two outer ones aresometimes allegorized by commentators. On the other hand, they may simply implythe triumphal perfection of the procession, since ten is known as the number ofGod’s perfection (as is 100, 1,000, etc.), since 1+0=1.

[part0014.html#c29-s28-e] The twelve ranks, two abreast, dressed inwhite (see vv. 64–66) and crowned with white lilies, are the twenty-four booksof the Old Testament. In the Book of Revelation (Apocalypse 4:4) there aretwenty-four elders, clothed in white, seated around the throne of Judgment. Theyare sometimes interpreted as representing the twelve tribes of Israel and thetwelve apostles. Here they clearly represent the books of the Old Testamentaccording to St. Jerome’s accountancy in his Prologue to his Latin translationof the Bible. (Pietro di Dante [1340] cites Jerome’s discussion of the books ofthe Old Testament in his Prologue to the Book of Daniel.) It is clear also thatDante is in this part of the procession referring to books and not authors, forthese would be fewer (e.g., Moses was “author” of five of them). He will changetactics when he comes to the New Testament. See vv. 133–144, below. [return toEnglish [part0014.html#c29-s28-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c29-s28-i]]85–87.

[part0014.html#c29-s32-e] The six wings are found in the Apocalypse(4:8) but not in Ezechiel (1:6), where they are four (see verse 105). Thereference is to the hundred eyes of Ovid’s Argus (see Metam. I.568–723). Jovechose Io as a victim of his desire. When jealous Juno came near them, he changedIo into a heifer, but Juno remained suspicious and sent Argus, with his hundredeyes, to watch over Io. Jove dispatched Mercury to slay him, which he did aftertelling a long tale that closed his eyes in sleep. Juno put those hundred eyesinto the feathers of the peacock.Dante’s reference intrinsically distinguishes between the eyes of dead Argus andthese living visionary eyes that have loftier purpose than guarding prettyheifers.

[part0014.html#c29-s34-e] Dante refers us to the lengthy passage inEzechiel (see the note to vv. 94–96) for the details of the appearance of thefour Gospel beasts.Lombardi (1791) is perhaps unique in his understanding of why Dante preferredJohn’s six to Ezechiel’s four. Bishop Primasius, he says, the student of St.Augustine, commenting on Revelation 4, said that the beasts have six wingsbecause six is the number of the sixth and final age, after which we will cometo the fullness of time (plenitudo temporum). There is nothing like consensus ona solution for this problem, but Lombardi’s thesis is, if nothing else,original. [return to English [part0014.html#c29-s34-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c29-s34-i]]105. [part0014.html#c29-s35-e] Dante’s claim here mirrors the pretext of theentire poem; his experience of the otherworld is to be treated as actual and notas imagined. As a result, his authority as teller of the tale is absolute, andeven biblical testimony is secondary to his own. [return to English[part0014.html#c29-s35-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c29-s35-i]]106–107. [part0014.html#c29-s36-e] The chariot, as will become evident,represents the Church, an opinion for which there is essential consensus. Itstwo wheels, however, are variously interpreted. Do they represent the twoTestaments (but these are fully represented in the pageant, as Bosco/Reggio[1979] rightly object)? Wisdom and Love? The active and the contemplative life?We probably need to understand literally that Dante wanted his chariot to looksomething like, not a four-wheeled oxcart, but a two-wheeled Roman triumphalchariot. It may be better to leave allegory to one side. Scartazzini (1900)offers a scathing review of the attempts mentioned above and still others.[return to English [part0014.html#c29-s36-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c29-s36-i]]108. [part0014.html#c29-s36-e] The griffin has only recently become a causefor controversy, even though for six hundred years it was assumed to signifyChrist (e.g., Pietro di Dante [1340], to whom “Gryphon … figurat Christum” [thegriffin figures Christ]). Beginning with Scartazzini (1900), commentators pointto Isidore of Seville’s description (Etym. XII.xxii.17) of the griffin as beinghalf lion and half eagle, and then going on to say that Christ is like both lionand eagle. For a review of the question and close to definitive restatement ofthe traditional view (the griffin symbolizes Christ), see Cristaldi(Cris.1988.2), answering Armour’s main objections to this understanding (e.g.,Dante would not have used a hybrid creature to symbolize Christ) even beforeArmour (Armo.1989.1) made them. And now see Pertile (Pert.1998.2), pp. 143–62,whose arguments in favor of the griffin as symbolizing Christ seem difficult tocounter.

[part0014.html#c29-s37-e] The griffin’s enormous wings go up, one oneither side of the central pennon made by the fourth of the seven candlesticks’flaming paintbrush, so as not to disturb the canopy in any way. [return toEnglish [part0014.html#c29-s37-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c29-s37-i]]113–114. [part0014.html#c29-s38-e] His mixture of immortal gold in the part ofhim that was eagle and the more “human” red-and-white parts of the lion wouldsurely seem further to identify him with Christ. [return to English[part0014.html#c29-s38-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c29-s38-i]]115–120. [part0014.html#c29-s39-e] This chariot is not only more splendid thanthose awarded either to Scipio Africanus (185–129 B.C.), conqueror of Hannibaland destroyer of Carthage, or to the great Augustus himself (63 B.C.–A.D. 14),the emperor at the “fullness of time,” when Christ was born in a world at peaceunder the rule of Augustus. Dante goes still further: this chariot makes thesun, become a chariot for Phaeton’s wild misadventure (Ovid, Metam. II.47–324),seem a poor thing by comparison. It is striking that this third chariot involvesa tragic event—Phaeton’s death—while the first two are used to glorious purpose.We are reminded of God’s mercy and of his justice.That the most significant element in the procession is a triumphal chariot makesit difficult not to see that this pageant represents the Church Triumphant,i.e., the Church as it shall be in eternity. It is only in Purgatorio XXXII thatwe shall observe a representation of the Church Militant. There is a resemblancein this rhythm to that which we have experienced on all the seven terraces,namely exempla of the opposed virtue preceding those of the vice to be purged.Here the perfected Church precedes its temporally prior and persecuted self inall its tribulations. For this observation, see Lansing (Lans.1994.1), pp.106–8. [return to English [part0014.html#c29-s39-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c29-s39-i]]121–129. [part0014.html#c29-s41-e] This part of the allegory escapes no one:the three ladies represent the three theological virtues, charity (red), hope(green), and faith (white). They stand at the right wheel of the cart, itsbetter side. Faith, necessary to a proper form of love, first leads their dance;then it is the turn of Charity, necessary to a proper form of Hope.

[part0014.html#c29-s44-e] At the left wheel we find the four cardinalvirtues, associated with Roman virtue by their purple robes: temperance,justice, fortitude, and prudence (represented by the three-eyed lady, since sheis knowledgeable about past, present, and future). [return to English[part0014.html#c29-s44-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c29-s44-i]]133–141. [part0014.html#c29-s45-e] We now come to the second Christian sectionof the pageant, those who came after Christ. We recognize Luke as the doctor hewas, author of the Acts of the Apostles; Paul as the sword-bearer (see Ephesians6:17, where Paul speaks of the sword of the spirit, that is, the word of God).And, as Singleton points out (1973), the sword also represents Paul’s martyrdom.Here Dante uses the authors of New Testament texts to represent their works, andnot vice versa, as he had done for the Old Testament. See the note to vv. 83–84.[return to English [part0014.html#c29-s45-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c29-s45-i]]142–144 [part0014.html#c29-s48-e].

[part0015.html#c30-s1-e] This first simile in a canto that is heavilysimiletic seems deliberately difficult. Puzzled out, it compares the sevenfoldspirit of the Church Triumphant, toward which all in the procession now turn forguidance as they do above in the Empyrean, to the Little Dipper, which locatesthe North Star for earthly navigators. The sevenfold Spirit of God [see the noteto Purg. XXIX.64–66]) seems clearly to be identified with the Holy Spirit, oneaspect of the triune God in the Empyrean. Porena (1946) points out that thestars of the constellation Ursa (whether Major or Minor) were construed as sevenplowing oxen, septem triones, as is reflected in Dante’s word “settentrïon”(which may reflect Virgil’s “septem … trioni” at Georgics III.381). This highersevenfold spirit, unlike Ursa Minor, never rises or sets but is constantlyglowing with charity; it is also never hidden by a clouded sky, even though itis not visible to us because we exist in a “cloud” of our own sinfulness.[return to English [part0015.html#c30-s1-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s1-i]]8–9. [part0015.html#c30-s3-e] The twenty-four elders, representing the OldTestament, turn toward the chariot as to the awaited messiah who, in His firstcoming, crowned their time of militance with peace and who now will come inJudgment. See Ephesians 2:14, “Ipse enim est pax nostra” [For He is our peace],a text cited by Singleton (1973). Since the procession in the garden representsthe Church Triumphant, the Mystical Body of Christ after its progress throughhistory, it seems advisable to realize that we deal here with a scene that ismeant to reflect the final advent of Christ for the Day of Judgment. SeeSingleton (Sing.1958.1), pp. 72–85, citing St. Bernard on the three advents ofChrist (Patrologia Latina 183, col. 35ff.). See also Thomas Merton(Mert.1953.1), Mark Musa (Musa.1974.1), and the note to Purgatorio VIII.103–108.[return to English [part0015.html#c30-s3-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s3-i]]10–12. [part0015.html#c30-s4-e] The elder who sings alone is clearly the Songof Songs, whether the book itself or its “author,” Solomon, his words repeatingthe phrasing “Veni…, veni…, veni” of the Canticle of Canticles 4:8 (“Come fromLebanon, my bride, come from Lebanon, come”). We would be forgiven if webelieved we were about to witness a wedding ceremony of some kind, featuringBeatrice in the role of bride. A strange “wedding” it will turn out to be,characterized by tears more than by smiles. In fact, no canto in the poemdisplays more words for weeping than this one (Inferno XXXIII has exactly asmany): lagrime (vv. 91, 145), lagrimando (54), piangere (56, 57, 107, 141).Chiarini (Chia.1967.2), p. 1112, points out that these verses constitute thelongest sentence (twelve lines) in the poem. [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s4-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s4-i]]13–15. [part0015.html#c30-s5-e] The reference is to the trumpet blast thatwill summon the souls of the dead to judgment (I Corinthians 15:52).The word “hallelujah” seems so familiar that it may be surprising to discoverthat it occurs (and occurs four times) only in a single biblical text, thenineteenth chapter of John’s Book of Revelation, where the saints (Apocalypse19:1, 19:3), the elders and the four Gospel beasts (Apocalypse 19:4), and agreat multitude (Apocalypse 19:6, reasonably understood as the souls of theblessed, to whom, in fact, Dante refers here) all cry out this word in welcomeof the coming reign of the true God and of his Judgment. [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s5-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s5-i]]16–18. [part0015.html#c30-s6-e] As will arise all those who will be saved atthe Last Judgment, a hundred angels (“ministers and messengers of life eternal”)rise up upon the chariot itself to welcome Beatrice, who, in a moment, will cometo it. Where do these angels come from? We are not told whether they suddenlymanifest themselves upon the chariot now just as Beatrice comes, or descendedfrom the Empyrean with her, or with the chariot when it came to show itself toDante in Eden. See the notes to Purgatorio XXXI.77–78 and XXXII.89–90.These Beatricean angels have a prehistory. In Vita nuova XXIII.7, Dante imaginesBeatrice’s death and sees a band of angels who return with her to heaven,mounting after a little white cloud, and singing “Osanna in altissimis.” CharlesSingleton (Sing.1954.1), p. 57, was perhaps the first to make the necessaryconnections between that scene and this one. This procession began with voicessinging “Hosanna” (Purg. XXIX.51); Beatrice returns with her host of angels andagain she is obscured by a cloud.These verses draw Dante’s imagining of Beatrice’s departure from this life inVita nuova into obvious relation to his presentation of her return to earth herein the garden of Eden. In both cases the word “Hosanna” associates her withChrist’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem: in the Vita nuova, the New Jerusalemthat is life eternal in the Empyrean; here, a triumphant descent to earthmodeled on Christ’s return in judgment. [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s6-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s6-i]]16. [part0015.html#c30-s6-e] The rare word basterna has caused difficulty.Benvenuto (1380) says that it is a vehicle made of soft skins, used to transportnoblewomen; he suggests that it fits the context here because it is drawn by twoanimals (this chariot, he notes, is pulled by a two-natured beast) and becauseBeatrice is the most noble of women. According to Servius’s gloss of AeneidVIII.666 (cited first by Lombardi [1791] and then by Trucchi [1936]), thebasterna was a cart, festooned with veils, found in Gaul, where it was used totransport chaste matrons to sacred festivals. [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s6-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s6-i]]17. [part0015.html#c30-s6-e] The Latin phrase ad vocem tanti senis (at thewords of so great an elder) is Dante’s own, opening a series of three rhymingLatin endings of lines, the next two from Mark and Virgil respectively. Theeffect is to make three Latin “authors,” Dante, Mark, and Virgil, eachcontribute part of a Latin verse for the advent of Beatrice. [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s6-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s6-i]]19. [part0015.html#c30-s7-e] Beatrice’s hundred angels cite the first of thetwo master texts for this poem found in this tercet, the Bible and the Aeneid.The clause “Blessèd are you who come” (with the adjective given a startlingmasculine ending, not the feminine that would seem a more fitting accompanimentto Beatrice) is derived from the account of Christ’s entry into Jerusalem foundin Mark 11:9–10: “And they that went before, and they that followed, cried,saying, ‘Hosanna; Blessèd is he that comes (Benedictus qui venit) in the name ofthe Lord. Blessèd be the kingdom of our father David, that comes in the name ofthe Lord: Hosanna in the highest’ (Hosanna in excelsis).” While Matthew (31:9)and John (12:13) also report the “Hosanna” and the blessedness of him who comesin fulfillment of the prophecy in Zechariah 9:9, only Mark has the words almostexactly as Dante has them in this passage and in Vita nuova XXIII.7 (see thenote to vv. 16–18 and Hollander [Holl.1973.1], p. 146).Dante could just as easily have said “benedicta” as “benedictus”; neither rhymenor meter forced his hand. We must therefore understand that the scandalousregendering of Beatrice caused by the correct citation of Mark’s Gospel isdeliberate. It seems clear that the poet wants his reader to realize that hermeaning, her eventual identity, is totally involved in Christ. And thus shecomes as Christ, not as herself. [return to English [part0015.html#c30-s7-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c30-s7-i]]20. [part0015.html#c30-s7-e] The angelic strewing has reminded commentators,at least since the time of Daniello (1568), of the strewing of palm fronds inthe path of Jesus on what became known as Palm Sunday. [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s7-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s7-i]]21. [part0015.html#c30-s7-e] The Latin is Virgilian (Aen. VI.883): “Givelilies with full hands.” This is the climax of Anchises’ tearful and propheticspeech about the future of Rome and the dreadful loss of Marcellus, the adoptiveson of Augustus who was to rule Rome after the emperor’s death, but who beat his“father” to the grave. In Virgil’s text the lilies are flowers of mourning; inDante’s they seem rather to be associated with (according to Pietro di Dante[1340]) the Song of Songs (2:1), when the bride describes herself as the liliumconvallium, “lily of the valley,” a wildflower, not a cultivated plant. Dantewill later associate lilies with the apostles (Par. XXIII.74). Traditionally, aflowering bough in the form of a lily was borne by the angel Gabriel indepictions of the Annunciation, denoting the chastity of Mary (see Fallani’scomment [1965] to Par. XXXII.112]). It seems clear that here the lilies arerelocated symbolically, losing their tragic tone for a “comic” and celebratoryone; they have a positive and redemptive valence, not the funerary significancethat they have in Virgil’s line. At the same time, for those of us who arethinking of Virgil as well as of Beatrice, they do underline our (and soonDante’s) sadness at this “death” of Virgil in the poem. In that respect theverse functions in both a “Beatricean” and a “Virgilian” mode.This is the closest Dante comes to giving a piece of Virgil’s Latin text anuninterrupted verbatim presence in his poem. His Italian “oh,” however, doesinterrupt the flow of the Virgilian line. It seems more than possible that theexclamation is spoken, since it is uttered by her angels, to mark the moment ofBeatrice’s appearance on the chariot. [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s7-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s7-i]]31–33. [part0015.html#c30-s11-e] Beatrice, described first by her apparel, iscrowned with the olive branch, traditionally symbolic of peace but alsoassociated with wisdom, since the olive was sacred to the goddess of wisdom,Minerva. The three colors that she wears associate her with faith (white), hope(green), and charity (red), the three theological virtues we have already seenin the procession (Purg. XXIX. 121–126). [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s11-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s11-i]]34–36. [part0015.html#c30-s12-e] Beatrice died in June 1290; it is now eitherthe end of March or early April 1300 (see note to Inf. I.1) and thus about twomonths fewer than ten years since she died.Virgil had been overcome by stupore (amazement) a short while ago (see note toPurg. XXIX.55–57); now it is Dante’s turn. Not even the man who wrote ofBeatrice can encompass the fact of her miraculous nature now that he finallyexperiences it directly and completely. It will take him another canticaadequately to understand what she means. [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s12-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s12-i]]39. [part0015.html#c30-s13-e] The line is clearly reminiscent (if thereminiscence was apparently only first noted by Torraca [1905]) of the openingof Dante’s lyric (Rime XCI), “Io sento sì d’Amor la gran possanza” (So much do Ifeel Love’s mighty power). Just as was the case with Matelda (see the note toPurg. XXVIII.43–48), Dante’s concupiscent memories and thoughts are at odds withthe nature of Beatrice. Yes, she looks exactly like the woman with whom he fellin love in Florence; but now it is clear (as it should have been then) that sheloves him only in Christ. This distinction will be insisted on at PurgatorioXXXII.7–9. [return to English [part0015.html#c30-s13-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c30-s13-i]]40–42. [part0015.html#c30-s14-e] For Dante’s earlier references to his firstbeing smitten by Beatrice while he was still in his childhood, in fact in hisninth year (i.e., while he was still eight), see Vita nuova II.2 (Andreoli[1856]); Vita nuova XII.7 (Poletto [1894]); and Rime CXI.1–2 (Singleton [1973]).[return to English [part0015.html#c30-s14-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c30-s14-i]]43–48. [part0015.html#c30-s15-e] Again Virgil is thought of as a mamma, thatstrikingly “vernacular” word we have heard applied to him before (in companywith the same rhyme words) in the salutation addressed to him by Statius (seePurg. XXI.95–99 and the note to Purg. XXI.97–99). See also Inferno XXXII.9 andthe note to XXXII.1–9.Virgil, it may seem, is strangely feminized in Dante’s gesture toward him.However, if we consider his nurturing role in the eyes of the protagonist, theterm is less disturbing. And once we observe Dante’s attempt to deal withBeatrice’s asperity and her “masculine” demeanor, we can see that the dynamic ofthis scene is built upon the reversal of gender roles, Virgil now seeming gentleand mothering, while Beatrice, coming as Christ in judgment (see the note to vv.16–18), like an admiral (see verse 58 and note), seems more like an unforgivingfather. [return to English [part0015.html#c30-s15-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c30-s15-i]]48. [part0015.html#c30-s16-e] This verse is a translation of Dido’s climacticutterance admitting that she has fallen in love with Aeneas, thus breaking hervows of chastity to her dead husband, Sichaeus (Aen. IV.23): “Agnosco veterisvestigia flammae” (I recognize the traces of the ancient flame). [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c30-s16-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s16-i]]49–51. [part0015.html#c30-s17-e] Near the conclusion of Virgil’s tragic fourthGeorgic (vv. 525–527), Orpheus’s severed head cries out to his lost Eurydice. Itis a moment that could define the tragic spirit, a decapitated voice giving ventto Orpheus’s misery at the loss of his wife:…Eurydicen vox ipsa et frigida lingua,a miseram Eurydicen! anima fugiente vocabat,Eurydicen toto referebant flumine ripae.…“Eurydice” that very voice and frozen tongue,“Oh wretched Eurydice!” it called as the soul escaped,“Eurydice” the banks gave back along the stream.It seems more than clear that Dante’s three-verse farewell to Virgil is modeledon Orpheus’s three-verse farewell to Eurydice. While surprisingly fewtwentieth-century commentators have heard that echo in these lines, even theyseem unaware that it had been heard a few centuries earlier by BernardinoDaniello (1568), as was pointed out by Hollander (Holl.1983.1), pp. 132–34. Nowthat we have a published text of the commentary of Trifon Gabriele (1525), wecan see that he was the first to notice this clear citation.Freccero (Frec.1986.1), pp. 207–8, has noted a program of “effacement” inDante’s three citations of Virgil here. In verse 21 a Latin quotation; in verse48 a literal Italian translation; in these lines, what he characterizes as “themerest allusion.” This last may seem a bit too “effacing.” See Hollander(Holl.1993.1), pp. 249, 317–18, who believes it is a full-fledged citation.[return to English [part0015.html#c30-s17-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c30-s17-i]]52. [part0015.html#c30-s18-e] The sense of this verse is that all that Evelost and Dante has now regained could not ease his pain at the loss of Virgil.[return to English [part0015.html#c30-s18-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c30-s18-i]]54. [part0015.html#c30-s18-e] Dante’s tears have reminded a number of readers,beginning with Tommaseo (1837), of the tears of Boethius that were wiped away byLady Philosophy in the Consolation of Philosophy I.ii(pr).

And once Dante is named, his new mission beginsto take form, first as Beatrice has him cleanse himself of his past crimes andmisdemeanors. (His “vacation” in the garden of Eden is over.) For the uniquenessof this self-nomination, see the note to v. 63, below.It is in response to this verse that Dante’s son Pietro offered his celebrated“etymology” of his father’s Christian name (1340): “… nominatus erat auctorDantes, ita dabat, sive dedit se ad diversa; scilicet primo ad theologiam,secundo ad poetica” (the author was named Dante, as in “he was giving” or “hegave” himself to diverse things, first of all to theology and then to poetry).[return to English [part0015.html#c30-s19-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c30-s19-i]]56–57. [part0015.html#c30-s19-e] The thrice-repeated verb piangere (weep)offered by Beatrice in reproof to Dante echoes and rebukes the thrice-repeatedplangent calling of Virgil’s name by Dante in vv. 49–51.

[part0015.html#c30-s20-e] This striking and unsettling simileticpresentation of Beatrice as admiral has drawn a mixed press. It is all very wellto argue, as Hollander has done (Holl.1969.1), pp. 122–23, 159, 190, that Dantehas prepared for this moment by staging a significant series of voyages withinthe poem in which he calls attention to a commanding officer standing on a poopdeck. (The word poppa appears at some highly charged moments: Inf. XXVI.124,when Ulysses turns his poop deck away from the east, and XXVI.140, when the poopof his sinking vessel rises from the swallowing sea before its final plunge;Purg. II.43, the afterdeck upon which the “heavenly pilot” stands as the savedsouls come to shore; and now, in its penultimate appearance in the poem, theplace where Beatrice seems to stand as she joins the pageant. The word willappear only once more, at Par. XXVII.146, in the last world-prophecy in thepoem, when an eventually benevolent storm at sea will set our erring “fleet”right, turning our poops to where our prows had been in our misdirected quests.)“Admiral Beatrice” seems, nonetheless, a bit overdone to most of Dante’sreaders, including Scott (Scot.1972.1), who, like Hollander, sees the necessarytheological trappings of her role, but is not altogether happy with theresultant poetic image.No other segment of the Commedia is as filled with similes as the firstninety-nine verses of this canto; there are seven in all. And they take up morethan half of the text, fully fifty-five lines of it. This one (and we will notbe confronted by another in this canto) is clearly meant to be read asclimactic. If we are troubled by Dante’s “Admiral Beatrice,” we must alsorealize that the poet has chosen to disturb us in this way.

[part0015.html#c30-s21-e] Dante’s insistence that he names himself onlyfrom necessity echoes a passage in Convivio (I.ii.12–14), in which Dante saysthat there are two reasons that excuse an author’s speaking of himself: first,and as in the case of Boethius’s Consolatio, in order to defend oneself fromharm or against infamy; second, as in the case of Augustine’s Confessions, inorder to bring greatly useful instruction to others. Freccero (Frec.1986.1), inhis article “Dante’s Prologue Scene” (1966), deals with the Augustinianconfessional mode as modeling and justifying Dante’s own (pp. 1–3).There was a tradition honored by many classical and medieval writers that oneshould only name oneself at the incipit and/or explicit of one’s work (i.e.,“Here begins [or concludes] the such-and-such of so-and-so”). Years ago thepresent writer (Holl.1983.1, p. 133, n. 24) thought that he had discovered anotable fact. It is widely appreciated that Dante only named himself once in thebody of any of his extended works, here in verse 55. What had not been noted wasthat his self-nomination echoed the only self-nomination found in the extendedworks of Virgil, indeed in the very Georgic (IV.563, “Vergilium”) that Dante hadcited a few lines earlier (vv. 525–527 at Purg. XXX.49–51). With the publicationof Trifon Gabriele’s commentary (Gabr.1993.1), it became apparent that at leastone earlier commentator had made the same discovery in his comment to thisverse, where he says that, in naming himself, Dante wished to imitate Virgil’sself-nomination (“volendo imitar Virgilio…illo Vergilium me tempore”).For the resonance here of an earlier claim, that his book is a true record ofevents, recording only what had actually occurred, see the note to InfernoXXIX.54–57.

[part0015.html#c30-s22-e] The veil (velo) worn by Beatrice is insisted onfully three times (at vv. 31 and 67 as well), and the canto has also begun withthis word (verse 3). (No other canto contains so many occurrences of the word.)The climax of this scene with Beatrice will occur when she, bridelike, unveilsherself at the end of the next canto (Purg. XXXI.136–145).

[part0015.html#c30-s23-e] The second (and now overt) reference to Minervain association with Beatrice (see the note to vv. 31–33) probably, inconjunction with other references that are still more direct, associates herwith Christ, or Sapience, the Word made flesh, the second person of the Trinity.[return to English [part0015.html#c30-s23-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c30-s23-i]]73–75. [part0015.html#c30-s25-e] Verse 73 is problematic, as Singleton (1973)explains clearly: “Guardaci: Commentators differ in their interpretation of cihere. It could be the pronoun, in which case Beatrice, in her regal manner,would be using the plural of majesty, speaking as a monarch would, in the firstperson plural. This reading is often accompanied by “ben sem, ben sem” in therest of the verse, continuing such a plural (sem = siamo). Or ci might beconstrued as the adverb qui, in which case the rest of the verse is usuallygiven in the reading here adopted.”That Beatrice speaks the word ben (here meaning “really,” but also carrying itsroot sense, “good” or “well”) three times in order to echo the triple iterationof “Virgil” (vv. 49–51) and of “weep” (vv. 56–57) was first noted by Tommaseo(1837).Beatrice’s anger at wayward Dante, saved by mercies in Heaven that seem hardlyto have been predictable, given his behavior, is not difficult to fathom. But hehas survived. Now, face to face with the beatified woman who has interceded forhim, he weeps for Virgil, compounding his failing past behavior by now missinghis pagan guide instead of rejoicing in the presence of Beatrice.

[part0015.html#c30-s28-e] For the commentators’ failure to recognizethe problematic nature of this tercet, see Hollander (Holl.1973.1), p. 149, n.2. As for the pointed reference to pedes meos (my feet), among the few who havebelieved that there is a “solution” to Dante’s riddle, there are two schools.What does it mean to say the angels “did not sing past ‘pedes meos’ ”? Freccero(Frec.1961.2) and Pézard (Peza.1965.1), p. 1335, both believe that the referenceis limited to the end of the ninth verse (“You [God] have not given me over tomy enemies, but have set my feet in a spacious place”) of Psalm 30 (31:8), thewords pedes meos understood as reflecting Dante’s newly gained freedom of thewill to move about the garden as he chooses. Mineo (Mine.1968.1) and Hollander,partly because Dante’s very way of expressing himself asks us to (if someonetells us he has not gone farther than nine we realize he is telling us that hedid not reach ten), argue for the relevance of the next verse in Psalm 30, whichis a citation of the opening verse of Psalm 50, “Have mercy on me, O Lord,” theMiserere of David’s penitential song that serves as source for Dante’s firstspoken words in the Commedia (Inf. I.65). In this understanding, the angels,intervening on Dante’s behalf with stern Beatrice, deliberately stop short ofthe Miserere out of sympathy for poor Dante, so heavily chastised by Beatrice.(See the note to vv. 103–108, below.)

[part0015.html#c30-s29-e] For a history of the exegesis examiningDante’s tears, mainly given over to attack and counterattack over the issue ofthe contorted and artificial nature of the simile, see Mazzoni (Mazz.1988.1),pp. 180–89. Mazzoni goes on (pp. 189–90) to bring three sources to bear: firsttwo similes in Ovid: the melting of Ovid’s Narcissus in his self-love (Metam.III.486–490, a passage discussed in this context in the nineteenth century byLuigi Venturi and Cesari, according to Trucchi [1936]; and see Brownlee[Brow.1978.1] and Shoaf [Shoa.1989.1]) and the liquefaction of Biblis when herbrother, Caunus, rejects her incestuous love (Metam. IX.659–665, also previouslynoted by Trucchi [1936]). Mazzoni’s major interpretive novelty (pp. 207–12) liesin his seeing Dante’s tears as reflecting the liquefaction in Psalm 147:16–18 ascommented on by St. Augustine (in Ps. CXLVII Enarratio [Patrologia Latina,XXXVIII, col. 1931]): “He gives snow like wool; he scatters the hoarfrost likeashes. / He casts forth his ice like morsels; who can stand before his cold? /He sends out his word, and melts [liquefacit] them; he causes his wind to blow,and the waters flow.” Augustine’s gloss has it that a sinner, “frozen” in hissinfulness, may yet “liquefy” and be saved.

[part0015.html#c30-s29-e] The phrase “living beams” is Dante’s way ofreferring to trees as the eventual source of wooden beams that may be hewn fromthem.

[part0015.html#c30-s35-e] The point of Beatrice’s gentle rebuke ofthe angels is that they, aware of Dante’s past sins and of his eventualsalvation, are now seeing him primarily as a saved soul rather than as aformerly sinful one, as Beatrice now (and vehemently) does. In her view, theyare celebrating his salvation prematurely because they are seeing it sub specieeternitatis, beyond the time that still holds him bound.

[part0015.html#c30-s37-e] Pietrobono (1946) points out that inConvivio IV.xxi. 7–8, Dante had already revealed his theory of the relationshipamong the elements of the individual human soul: the fathering sower, theembryo, and the astral influences of the constellations of the zodiac that shapeits human talents. In this passage we hear about God, who breathes in last thevital element, the intellectual, or rational, soul. The passage at PurgatorioXXV.68–75 explains that the generation of the rational soul is performeddirectly by God; here we learn that not even the saved in the Empyrean nor theangels can understand the love that moves God in the creation of that soul ineach of his human creatures.

[part0015.html#c30-s39-e] It seems obvious to most readers today thatthe phrase vita nova refers, if in its Latin form, to Dante’s first prosimetrum,the thirty-one poems collected with prose commentary known as The New Life. Andit seemed so to at least one very early commentator, the Ottimo (1333). However,here is the commentary of Benvenuto da Imola to this passage (1380): “This man,i.e., Dante, was such in his new life, i.e., in his boyhood; others, however,refer to his treatise De vita nova, which he composed in his youth. But it issurely ridiculous to do so, seeing that the author was ashamed of it in hismaturity.” Benvenuto’s enthusiastic prehumanist reading of the Comedy will onlyaccept an allegorical, theologized Beatrice who bears no resemblance to themortal girl of the early work.One finds, even among recent commentators, a certain desire to avoid committingoneself to what seems completely obvious: the phrase vita nova cannot help butcall to mind, in this context, the work that records Beatrice’s lasting impacton Dante, first in his “new life” (when they were both children, a time to whichDante refers in verse 42: “before I had outgrown my childhood”) and then lateron, as recorded in the book called “The New Life.” [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s39-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s39-i]]118–138. [part0015.html#c30-s40-e] Moore’s essay, “The Reproaches of Beatrice”(Moor.1903.1), pp. 221–52, remains one of the most valuable attempts to dealwith this convoluted expression of the single most important explanation Danteoffers with regard to what he now conceives to have been his chief errors beforehe wrote the Commedia.

[part0015.html#c30-s40-e] Beatrice offers an epitome of the mainnarrative of the Vita nuova, according to which for some sixteen years(1274–1290) she attempted to lead Dante to God, despite his natural sinfuldisposition. Unfortunately, even while she lived, the “rich soil” of his soulgrew weeds. [return to English [part0015.html#c30-s40-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c30-s40-i]]124–126. [part0015.html#c30-s42-e] Upon Beatrice’s death, and according toDante’s own report in the Vita nuova (chapters XXXV–XXXIX), he did indeed givehimself to at least one other (altrui can be either singular or plural inDante). His probably most egregious dalliance was with the donna gentile (noblelady) who sympathized with his distress.The lady is later allegorized, in Dante’s Convivio, as the Lady Philosophy. (Fordiscussion, see the note to Purg. XXXIII.85–90.) [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s42-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c30-s42-i]]134. [part0015.html#c30-s45-e] The sort of dream Beatrice prayed God to sendDante is probably well represented by the dream of the Siren in Purgatorio XIX.7–32. That accounts for the first part of Beatrice’s formulation, i.e., Dantewas given negative dreams about his disastrous love for the wrong lady. Whatabout the second? What God-sent “inspirations” was she granted in order to callhim back to loving her even after her death? Scartazzini (1900) offers a simpleand compelling hypothesis (apparently silently acceded to by any number of latercommentators, who make the same point without even a mention of his name). InVita nuova XXXIX.1, Dante receives the image of the girlish Beatrice in hisphantasy, the image-receiving part of his mind (one may compare the ecstaticvisions vouchsafed him for the exemplary figures on the terrace of Wrath [andsee the note to Purg. XV.85–114]). As he recounts (VN XXXIX.2–6), this vision ofBeatrice had the necessary effect, and he resolved to love her yet again,turning away his affection from the donna gentile. And then, Scartazzinicontinues, he was allowed the final vision of Beatrice seated in the Empyrean(VN XLII.1). Thus, as seems clear, while Dante slept, God sent him dreams ofwhat was unworthy in his love for the donna gentile; while he was awake,positive images of Beatrice. If this program is correctly perceived, it matchesprecisely the mode employed to teach penitents on the mountain, positive andnegative examples teaching what to follow and what to flee. Unfortunately, evenafter such encouragement, Dante would fall again. See the note to PurgatorioXXXIII.85–90. [return to English [part0015.html#c30-s45-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c30-s45-i]]139–141. [part0015.html#c30-s47-e] Poor Virgil! He has done the Christianssixty-four cantos’ worth of service, guiding their great poet to his redemptionand vision, and now the very lady who sought his help does not even mention hisname; he is but “colui” (the one who). Where is Virgil now? On his way back toLimbo, we must assume. And thus, we may also assume, to another sad welcome fromhis fellow poets once he is again (less than a week after he had alreadyreturned once [see note to Inf. IV.80–81]) among them in his etterno essilio(eternal exile—Purg. XXI.18). We shall only hear his name twice more (Par.XVII.19 and XXVI.118) and never again from Beatrice, who uses it only once, inher first words, coupling it with Dante’s (verse 55), and then to shame Dantefor his affection for Virgil when there are more important feelings he shouldfeel.

[part0015.html#c30-s48-e] As Beatrice wept in Virgil’s presence inhell for Dante’s sake (verse 141), so now it is Dante’s turn to weep for thesins that made her intervention necessary.

[part0015.html#c31-s1-e] Beatrice’s words, perhaps reminiscent of Virgil’sto the cowering, hiding Dante in Inferno XXI.88–90, call his (and our) attentionto the fact that he has not yet crossed Lethe, i.e., he still has his sins inmind, as will be hammered home by vv. 11–12.

[part0015.html#c31-s1-e] The metaphor of Beatrice’s speech as a “sword”picks up her earlier promise that Dante will weep for “another sword” besidethat of Virgil’s departure (Purg. XXX.57). The lengthy speech that she haddirected to the angels (Purg. XXX.103–145) was in fact aimed squarely at him,using the angels as her apparent primary auditors in such a way as to publicizehis sins and thus shame the protagonist. In this sense, then, the point of her“sword” had seemed aimed at them, while she was wounding Dante (if painfullyenough, as we have seen) with only the edge of the blade. Now he finds her swordpointing straight at his heart. [return to English [part0015.html#c31-s1-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c31-s1-i]]5–6.

[part0015.html#c31-s9-e] Beatrice, given Dante’s muteness, rehashes thecharges we had heard in the last canto (Purg. XXX.124–132), now substituting afresh set of metaphors for those we found there (see the note to Purg.XXX.118–138). There we heard that after Beatrice’s death (1) he gave himself toanother (or “to others”; the Italian altrui is ambiguous and may be singular orplural); (2) he chose a wrong path, “pursuing false images of good.” Now he ispresented first as warrior and then as lover. In the first tercet he is like asoldier (or an army) cut off from his pursuit of his goal by the defensiveditches or chains deployed by an enemy; in the second he is like a courtingswain who parades before the house of the woman with whom he is infatuated. Inthe first case, once he loses his Beatrice he no longer advances toward God; inthe second, he moves toward another and improper destination. He was turned byhis love for the donna gentile, who, we may remember (VN XXXV.2), was seated ather window and looked pityingly at Dante, who then “parades” before her a pairof sonnets (VN XXXV.15–18; XXXVI.14–15). If, in the Vita nuova, he finallyreturns to his love for Beatrice and is rewarded with a vision of her in theEmpyrean, in Convivio he is writing about the donna gentile again, now as havingfinally displaced Beatrice in his affections. He had looked for consolation fromthis lady, he says, but he had instead found gold (Conv. II.xii.5).For this writer’s view of this complex matter see Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp.159–69. And see, more recently, Picone (Pico.1992.1), pp. 205–12. [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c31-s9-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c31-s9-i]]31–33.

Mazzoni(Mazz.1965.2), p. 62, rightly observes (as, for instance, Singleton [1973] doesnot) that the confession will be followed by his contrition and then by hisgiving satisfaction. These three elements in the rite of confession, in thatperhaps puzzling order, occupy the first 102 verses of this canto, with firstconfession and then contrition, occupying vv. 31–90 (for the traditional order,see the note to Purg. IX.94–102). [return to English [part0015.html#c31-s11-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c31-s11-i]]34–36. [part0015.html#c31-s12-e] Finally Dante confesses, summarizing histransgressions as delight in false things set before him after Beatrice wasdead. Exactly what these pleasures were is a question that greatly exercisesDante scholars. It does seem clear that they are presented in so vague andencompassing a way as to allow two primary interpretations, that is, both carnaland intellectual divagations from the love he owed God, awakened in him byBeatrice.

[part0015.html#c31-s15-e] The reference to the Sirens draws us back toPurgatorio XIX.19–33, the dream of the Siren and (as at least a few interpretersagree) Beatrice’s intervention in Dante’s dream to have Virgil show him theugliness of the object of his infatuation. See the note to Purgatorio XIX.31–33.The Ottimo (1333) is one of the very few commentators to think of Boethius’sdismissal of the Sirens (who have so harmed him) in favor of the Muses of LadyPhilosophy (Cons.

[part0015.html#c31-s16-e] Tommaseo (1837) was apparently the first toexplain the strange phrase “to sow tears” by referring to the Bible, Psalm 125:5(126:5), “those that sow in tears shall reap in joy.” Even so, Dante has madethe Psalmist more difficult than he had in fact been: “sowing tears” is notquite the same thing as “sowing in tears” (i.e., planting seed while weeping).[return to English [part0015.html#c31-s16-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c31-s16-i]]47–54. [part0015.html#c31-s16-e] Beatrice’s phrasing offers a good example ofthe cause of the difficulty many have in interpreting her role in this poem. Shetells Dante that her buried flesh should have led him elsewhere from where heelected to go (in this context, clearly to other women [cosa mortale, “mortalthing”]). This is not because she was more beautiful in her fleshly being thanthey, but because she offered him what they did and could not, “il sommo piacer”(the highest beauty). The verbal noun piacer is used only once in the first halfof the poem (it describes Paolo’s physical attractiveness at Inf. V.104). Whenit is found again (at Purg. XVIII.21), it then occurs thirty-four times in thesecond half, twenty-one of these in Paradiso. It is often used to denote thehighest beauty of all, that of God. The word is used three times in this canto(vv. 35, 50, 52), its densest presence in the Comedy. The false beauty ofBeatrice’s rivals (verse 35) should have been countered by the highest beautythat he had found in her. The phrase “sommo piacer” was traditionallyinterpreted as referring to Beatrice as the most beautiful of all mortals. I.e.,Dante’s failure was in chasing after women who were not as beautiful as she was.This disastrous interpretation, undermined by the very antithesis present inBeatrice’s formulations, sommo piacer / cosa mortale, which polarizes divine andhuman beauty, was intelligently dismissed in Mazzoni’s gloss (Mazz.1965.2), pp.67–72. Mazzoni demonstrates that Dante is relying upon the Victorine traditionthat discussed the beauty of God, even as it was manifest in individual humanbeings, the summa pulchritudo (highest beauty) in the phrase of Hugh of St.Victor (p. 68). (For a study of Dante’s ideas about beauty see John Took[Took.1984.1].) [return to English [part0015.html#c31-s16-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c31-s16-i]]55–57. [part0015.html#c31-s19-e] Beatrice’s next installment drives the pointhome, again separating the spiritual from the physical—if readers tend to failto notice what she has done. The “deceitful” things of this world aredistinguished from those of the next in that Beatrice tells Dante that, once shewas no longer associated with this world, his affection should have followed herupward.

[part0015.html#c31-s20-e] We are given yet another (now the third)version of Dante’s sins after Beatrice’s death (see the note to vv. 25–30).Instead of flying up after dead Beatrice’s spirit, the wings of his affectiondrooped down to earth in search of a pargoletta (young girl)—the sexual note isstruck again—or “other novelty of such brief use,” a phrasing that would againallow the understanding that Dante’s divagation also involved some sort ofintellectual experiment that now seems without eventual value.

(The citation was first observed by Pietro Alighieri[1340].) Dante, as grown up “bird,” should have been able to avoid capture byhis huntress(es).

[part0015.html#c31-s22-e] Understandably, Dante is now compared, insimile, not to a mature man, who should have known better, but to a naughty boy.[return to English [part0015.html#c31-s22-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c31-s22-i]]68. [part0015.html#c31-s23-e] Continuing the motif introduced in the precedingsimile, this verse has had the effect of convincing some readers that the usualportraits and busts of Dante are all incorrect in showing him as clean-shaven.However, all that is probably meant is that he was old enough to know betterbecause he was old enough to shave. In the same vein, some have argued thatBeatrice only indicates Dante’s chin (mento, referred to in verse 73). Even so,his chin is “bearded” if he has to shave it. For a brief and cogent review ofthe argument, see Mazzoni (Mazz.1965.2), pp. 73–74. And for a hypotheticalmeditation on the iconographic valence of Dante’s beardedness that essentiallybypasses the issue that attracts most readers (and which involves anastonishingly large bibliography)—whether Dante meant us to understand that hisface was bearded or not—see Shoaf (Shoa.1986.1). [return to English[part0015.html#c31-s23-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c31-s23-i]]70–75. [part0015.html#c31-s24-e] The formal “classical” simile is clear in itsintent: Dante, for all the reticence of his contrition, is finally won over. Itsresonance, however, is subtle and not observed in the commentary tradition.Shoaf (Shoa.1986.1), pp. 176–77, decodes the passage well. He points out thatAeneid IV.196–278 presents Iarbas’s appeal to Jupiter to intervene on his behalfin his suit for widow Dido’s hand, an appeal that results in Mercury’s coming toAeneas to spur him to his Italian voyage. The simile that gives birth to thisone is found, Shoaf continues, at Aeneid IV.441–449, when Aeneas is compared toa deeply rooted oak tree buffeted by north winds when Dido makes her last-ditchappeal to him to stay with her in Carthage. In the end, he remains strong enoughin his new resolve to deny her request and set sail. Here, the “new Aeneas,”buffeted by the south wind, gives over his stubborn recalcitrance and accedes tothe insistent demand of Beatrice, a new and better Dido, that he express hiscontrition. Where it was good for Aeneas to resist the entreaties of his woman,it is also good for Dante to yield to Beatrice’s.

[part0015.html#c31-s26-e] Since Beatrice’s hundred angels are notreferred to directly again, we can only conclude that, after this last act oftheirs, they disappear, either into thin air or else to fly back up to theEmpyrean, along with the rest of the Church Triumphant (see Purg. XXXII.89–90).While the text guarantees no solution, the second hypothesis seems the betterone, if only because we have no reason to exempt them from the general exodusthat occurs at that point, even if their arrival is not clearly accounted for(see the notes to Purg. XXX.16–18 and XXXII.89–90). [return to English[part0015.html#c31-s26-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c31-s26-i]]81.

He is now ready to perform his act of satisfaction,forgetting all his divagations, canceling them from his memory. [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c31-s29-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c31-s29-i]]91–102. [part0015.html#c31-s31-e] Dante’s immersion in Lethe, supervised byMatelda, marks his final satisfaction of his confessor’s demands on him. As wewill see (Purg. XXXIII.91–99), his forgetting that he ever transgressed againstBeatrice’s instruction will be used by her as proof that he had indeed done so.Here we understand that his act of forgetting is an act of atonement, and isrewarded with absolution, indicated by the Latin song he hears as he completeshis crossing of Lethe.As for Dante’s drinking of the waters, it has a Virgilian source, according toPietro di Dante (1340) and, among the moderns, Mattalia (1960): in Lethe’swaters the souls “longa oblivia potant” (drink in long forgetfulness [Aen.VI.715]). As we shall see at Eunoe (Purg. XXXIII.138), the ingestion of thewaters of these two rivers is essential to the accomplishment of (here) leavingone’s sins in oblivion and (there) securing in memory all the good thingsaccomplished in one’s mortal life.Does Statius also drink of these waters? And does Matelda have oversight for hiscrossing of Lethe as well as Dante’s? See the note to Purg. XXXIII.128–135.The Ottimo (1333) identifies the phrase “Asperges me …” (Purge me [with hyssop,that I may be purified; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow]) as derivingfrom “the penitential Psalm” (50:9 [51:7]) and goes on to report that the phraseis repeated in the rite of absolution when the priest blesses the confessedsinner with holy water. We have less certain information about who it is thatsings the words. Among those commentators who venture an opinion, most assume itis the angels who sing, but it could be the (still unnamed) Matelda (as Porena[1946] admits, even though he prefers the angels). Since the angels have servedas singers before (Purg. XXX.19, XXX.21, XXX.83–84), the most reasonablehypothesis seems to be that it is they who sing now, as well.

[part0015.html#c31-s35-e] The four nymphs represent the four cardinalvirtues (Justice, Prudence, Temperance, and Fortitude) in their primal form,i.e., as they were infused in Adam and Eve (and not acquired, as they have hadto be ever after). God created the first humans, and no others, in this state.They are “nymphs” in that, like some classical nymphs, they inhabit a woodlandlandscape (Lombardi [1791]). The stars they are in heaven are probably (there isdebate about this) identical with those we saw in Purgatorio I.23 (also referredto in I.37–39) and VIII.91, irradiating the face of Cato with their light. Dantethus seems to suggest that both Cato and Beatrice are of such special virtuethat it seems that original sin did not affect them—a notion that could only beadvanced in the sort of suggestive logic possible in poetry, for it is simplyheretical. Dante never did say (or would have said) such a thing in prose.The exact sense in which they served as the handmaids of Beatrice before shelived on earth is less easily determined. For two similar views of the problemsee Singleton (Sing.1958.1), pp. 159–83, and Mazzoni (Mazz.1965.2), pp. 82–86.Both link the infused cardinal virtues to Beatrice’s special role on earth,reflected in such passages as Inferno II.76–78, where she is addressed by Virgilas “donna di virtù” (lady of such virtue that by it alone / the human racesurpasses all that lies / within the smallest compass of the heavens).Botticelli-like (as in his Primavera, surely shaped by this scene), the fourdancing maidens make a composite sign of the cross with their upraised arms,which join over Dante’s head. All redeemed sinners leave the garden of Eden ontheir way to glory in the moral condition that marked the creation of the firsthumans, before the Fall: primal innocence.

[part0015.html#c31-s37-e] The four cardinal virtues, representing theactive life, insist that, while they are able to escort Dante to the eyes ofBeatrice, their sister virtues, the theological three, at the right wheel of thechariot, are more appropriate presences to prepare Dante’s vision for thatmoment.

[part0015.html#c31-s38-e] Beatrice has moved down from the chariot,from its left side, where she was looking at Dante across the stream (Purg.XXX.61 and 100), to, now that he has crossed it, a point in front of the chariotand of the griffin that draws it, so as to confront him.

[part0015.html#c31-s41-e] The word reggimenti (regiments, governments,regimes [in modern Italian]) would seem to give aid and comfort to those whohave argued that this passage makes it difficult to argue for the traditionalinterpretation of the griffin as Christ. However, beginning with Venturi (1732),commentators have understood that here the word is synonymous with atteggiamento(in the sense of bearing, self-presentation). Daniello (1568 [118–123]) hadpreviously understood the word as indicating that the griffin behaved “now asman, now as God.” [return to English [part0015.html#c31-s41-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c31-s41-i]]124–126. [part0015.html#c31-s42-e] Dante’s sixth address to his readers inPurgatorio asks that we share his wonder (see the note to Inferno VIII.94–96).The griffin himself is constant in his appearance, while his reflection inBeatrice’s eyes, revealing his truer aspect, reflects, in turn, his divine andhuman natures.

[part0015.html#c31-s43-e] Once again Scartazzini is the firstcommentator to find the likely citation behind Dante’s words and to be followed,always without acknowledgment, by any number of twentieth-century discussants ofthe passage: Wisdom speaks in Ecclesiasticus 24:29: “He who eats of me willhunger again, who drinks of me will thirst again.” That the speaker in thispassage is Wisdom, the second person of the Trinity in Christian eyes, pleasesSingleton (1973), who had argued earlier for the close relationship betweenBeatrice and Christ as Sapience (Sing.1958.1), pp. 122–34. [return to English[part0015.html#c31-s43-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c31-s43-i]]131. [part0015.html#c31-s44-e] The “other three” are obviously the threetheological virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, equally obviously of higher“rank” than the older classical cardinal virtues. [return to English[part0015.html#c31-s44-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c31-s44-i]]132. The word caribo has had extensive discussion among Dantists.

[part0015.html#c31-s45-e] The three theological virtues sing theirappeal to Beatrice, requesting that she unveil her mouth. The moment recalls anexperience recorded in Convivio. “Here it is necessary to know that the eyes ofwisdom are her demonstrations, by which truth is seen with the greatestcertainty, and her smiles are her persuasions, in which the inner light ofwisdom [Sapienza] is revealed behind a kind of veil; and in each of them is feltthe highest joy of blessedness, which is the greatest good of paradise. This joycannot be found in anything here below except by looking into [her] eyes andupon her smile” (Conv. III.xv.2–3, trans. Lansing). It is important to know thatthese words are directed to another lady, also known as Wisdom, in the Convivio,namely the Lady Philosophy, the one who came as the replacement for the thensupposedly less worthy Beatrice.

[part0015.html#c31-s46-e] The seconda bellezza (second beauty) ofBeatrice also may remind the reader of the “corollary” or extra gift thatMatelda bestowed upon the three poets at the end of Purgatorio XXVIII (verse136).

[part0015.html#c31-s47-e] The luce etterna (eternal living light)that is God has its etterno piacer (eternal beauty) reflected in Beatrice, herloveliness the mirror of the beauty of God.This passage is reminiscent of that in Purgatorio XXVIII.139–148, thedescription of the smiles of recognition on the part of Virgil and of Statiuswhen they discover that Eden represents the true Golden Age. No pagan poet, nomatter how deeply inspired by drinking of the Castalian spring on Parnassus,could have written of the meaning of his vision of the Golden Age in a way thatcould come near to equaling what this Christian poet (by virtue of his faith,not of his talent), having now drunk of Lethe, can tell of God’s love in makingHis first human creature innocent and allowing His creature a chance to regainthat lost innocence, which is what Dante has been allowed to accomplish here,while still in the flesh, and what he will finally accomplish after his death.[return to English [part0015.html#c31-s47-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c31-s47-i]]143. [part0015.html#c31-s48-e] The pronoun te (the second person singular of“you”) is jarring, in that we have already learned that Beatrice is to beaddressed by Dante with the honorific voi (at verse 36). It takes us a moment torealize that it is not Beatrice whom he apostrophizes here, but her smile.[return to English [part0015.html#c31-s48-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c31-s48-i]]PURGATORIO XXXII1–3. [part0015.html#c32-s1-e] Dante would seem to be looking back in time,seeing Beatrice now, in 1300, as she was in Florence in 1290 (the year in whichshe died). That his eyes are so “fixed” will be noted by the theological virtuesat verse 9—and not with approval.This is the longest canto in the Comedy. For consideration of the variouslengths of Dante’s cantos, see the note to Inferno VI.28–32. [return to English[part0015.html#c32-s1-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c32-s1-i]]4–6. [part0015.html#c32-s2-e] The love that Dante feels now for Beatrice isdescribed in terms that indicate its “Carthaginian” dimension. The “antica rete”(old, familiar net) reminds us of the “antica fiamma” (ancient flame—Purg.XXX.48) that flared in Dido and then in Dante, Dido’s words become his own.Dante’s morals may have been cleansed on the mountain, and Lethe may have madehim forget his now forgiven sins, but his intellect is surely not working at itshighest level. Having seen Beatrice as God loves her, he still contrives tothink she is that pretty girl from Florence. The poet records her “holy smile”;the protagonist remembers his earthly feelings.The word rete (net) was used in the last canto (Purg. XXXI.63) to denote theinstrument with which a hunter catches birds (as a girl [or girls] caughtincautious Dante, according to Beatrice), and may also remind us of the net inwhich Vulcan caught his adulterous wife Venus in flagrante delicto with Mars, asAllen Tate (Tate.1961.1), p. 103, has suggested.

[part0015.html#c32-s3-e] Dante, facing Beatrice, the griffin, and the frontof the chariot, turns to his left to pay attention to the three theologicalvirtues, facing him as they stand at the chariot’s right wheel (see Purg.XXIX.121). [return to English [part0015.html#c32-s3-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c32-s3-i]]9. [part0015.html#c32-s3-e] How can Dante love Beatrice too much? Only if hedoes not love her in God. And that, we should realize, is why he is rebuked hereby the theological virtues (not the least of them being Charity), who understandthat his gaze is fixed on the image of the young woman he loved and lost ratherthan on the saved soul who has made his journey possible. (See the note to Purg.XXX.58.) The problem is as old as Plato’s Phaedrus. How do we love physicalbeauty in such ways as to see it as only the manifestation of a higher beauty(in Dante, of the etterno piacer [Purg. XXIX.32])? See Mazzeo’s “Dante and thePhaedrus Tradition of Poetic Inspiration” (Mazz.1958.1, pp. 1–24). The virtuesintercede because they sense that Dante is caught up in carnal appreciation of aspiritual entity. [return to English [part0015.html#c32-s3-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c32-s3-i]]13–15. [part0015.html#c32-s5-e] The poet at first may seem to be makingexactly the same sort of mistake the protagonist has just made, a secondidolatrous praising of his lady who, he now seems to be saying, is of evengreater worth than the entirety of the Church Triumphant (or so Singleton [1973]implies, referring to these “strong words, calling the whole procession ‘poco’in comparison!”).The passage has caused difficulty over the years. The partial insights ofseveral help us make sense of what Dante said. John of Serravalle (1416) pointsout that the word sensibile is a technical term, reflecting such discussions asthose found in Aristotle (De anima II and De senso et sensato). The sensationencountered by any particular sense organ is what is meant, and thecommentator’s first example fits perfectly here. If one looks at the sun (asensibile, an object of sense perception, in this case by the eyes), anythingelse will seem less bright by comparison (see the discussion of the sensibilecomune [the objects of sensory perception] in the note to Purg. XXIX.47–51).Tozer (1901) reminds the reader of the similar passage at Purgatorio XV.15, inwhich Dante’s sense of sight is overwhelmed. And Steiner (1921) distinguishesbetween the light of the sun and the blinding effulgence of God.The context here is the “isplendor di viva luce etterna” (splendor of eternalliving light), that is, the smile of Beatrice glowing with the direct light ofGod’s rays. Her mouth is illumined by the “sun” that is God, while all else inthe garden is lit by the light of the natural sun, and thus is less available tothe sense of sight than Beatrice’s smile, as vv. 10–12 make all but apparent:Dante has been blinded by the Light.

[part0015.html#c32-s6-e] The Church, in metaphor a “glorious army,” hasreversed its course, is heading back toward the east, whence it came. In thispoem, until we hear the penitents cry out in joy for the liberation of Statius’ssoul (Purg. XX.136), the words gloria and glorïoso have referred to worldlyfame. But here, as there, the word has the meaning it will have in Paradiso,referring to those who live in Glory, that is, in the shining effulgence of God.(The American nineteenth-century locution “going to glory” meant “headed forheaven.”) This army is not famous for its worldly accomplishments; it dwellswith God and does not care for the world’s rewards. The word “glory” has 25 ofits 39 occurrences in the poem in Paradiso; thus nearly two-thirds of them arefound in one-third of the available poetic space. [return to English[part0015.html#c32-s6-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c32-s6-i]]19–24. [part0015.html#c32-s7-e] The elaborate military simile, in which thevanguard of the Church Triumphant had turned and was already moving eastwardwhile the chariot was still facing west (an effect striven for and achieved bymarching bands between the halves of American football games) may have anulterior purpose. Dante has reversed temporal order to present first the Churchin triumph as it will be after time, and only then the Church in its earthlytravail (see the note to Purg. XXIX.115–120). As preparation for that change,from Church Triumphant to Church Militant, he may have chosen this introductorymilitary simile, one in which the forces with which we identify are under attackand in strategic retreat.

[part0015.html#c32-s10-e] Matelda, Statius, and Dante are at the rightwheel of the chariot, since that is the one that turns in the smaller arc, giventhe fact that the “army” has turned to its right in its retreat. Statius’spresence has not been referred to since Purgatorio XXVIII.146 and his name hasnot been heard since Purgatorio XXVII.47. He is named a total of eight timesbetween Cantos XXI and XXXIII of this cantica, this being the seventh;nonetheless, his presence almost always catches us by surprise.

[part0015.html#c32-s11-e] If paradise has been regained in this Eden,it is now time to consider how it was lost in the first place; the usualsuspects are Eve and Adam (in that order, since she sinned first, but he stillmore disastrously). Eve is referred to periphrastically by the poet (verse 32),but it is Adam’s name that is murmured by all the others present in theprocession.That the procession has paused, with Beatrice descending from the chariot,indicates that we have arrived at a “destination” of some importance. [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c32-s11-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c32-s11-i]]38–42. [part0015.html#c32-s13-e] The tree, given the context, is, literally,the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. However, some of the firstcommentators (e.g., the Anonymus Lombardus [1322], Jacopo della Lana [1324]),disregarding that context, think its withered condition indicates the Tree ofLife after the original sin, when humankind lost eternal life, a perfectlysensible (if almost certainly erroneous) conclusion. Benvenuto (1380), payingattention to what is said of the tree in the next canto (Purg. XXXIII.61–63),only reasonably concludes that this tree, eaten of by Adam when he followed Evein sin, must be the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. We probably shouldalso assume that this tree, like those found on one of the terraces below (seePurg. XXII.131–135; XXIV.103–105), has its boughs pointed downward so as toprevent its being climbed.

[part0015.html#c32-s15-e] This exchange between the members of theChurch Triumphant and the griffin (his only spoken words in the poem) haspuzzled the commentators, like so much else in this difficult canto. Hisfaithful celebrate the griffin’s un-Adamic restraint; not only will he notdespoil the tree a second time, he will bring the dead tree back to life (vv.58–60).The griffin’s words, as was first pointed out by Scartazzini (1900) and now bymany another commentator, derive from Matthew 3:15. Christ insists on beingbaptized by John the Baptist: “For so it becomes us to fulfill all justice.”That the griffin speaks a version of the very words of Christ is still furtherevidence that he is meant to be understood as representing Him here. [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c32-s15-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c32-s15-i]]51. [part0015.html#c32-s17-e] The griffin now binds the temo (shaft), by meansof which he had been drawing the chariot, to the tree. Most discussantscurrently believe that this instrument represents Christ’s cross. The firstcommentators argued that, since Adam’s sin had been disobedience, this sceneshowed the obedience to which Christ enjoined his Church, a reasonable enoughunderstanding. While embracing it, Benvenuto (1380) reports that some othersbelieve that this ligature is symbolic of the Incarnation, while still othersbelieve it is related to the cross. This last interpretation eventually becamedominant, and remains so today.It was only with Scartazzini (1900), however, that the most likely source forthis tercet, the fourteenth chapter of the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, whichScartazzini claims is also the source of the lengthy paraphrase found in thegloss to the passage by Francesco da Buti (1385), came to light. Any number ofmedieval legends were developed from this text (see Longfellow [1867]). In it,Adam’s noncanonical son Seth visits the gates of the garden of Eden, now awasteland, in search of some oil to ease Adam’s aching head (Adam has been inLimbo for nearly five thousand years). Seth is not allowed to enter by theguardian angel, but does see a very tall tree, denuded of its leaves. The angelgives him a branch from the tree (it is the Tree of the Knowledge of Good andEvil) which he brings back to Adam, who has died before Seth returns to Limbowith the branch. Planted, it soon supplied the wood that would serve for thecrucifixion of Jesus.For a brief discussion of the “Legend of the Wood of the Cross” as beingapplicable to Dante’s phrasing here see Moore (Moor.1903.1), pp. 219–20. Forthese legends see Mussafia (Muss.1869.1). It is remarkable that the Gospel ofNicodemus has not made its way into other commentaries to this tercet, since ithas been a staple of commentators since Torraca (1905 [to Inf. IV.54]) as aprobable source for Dante’s sense of the harrowing of hell, witnessed by Virgil,as it is described in Inferno IV.52–63.

What was the “hymn” that he heard sung but could not understand,except to know that it is not sung on earth? Dante tells us as much and, as aresult, the Ottimo (1333) reasons, we cannot identify it. However, is there ahymn, known to be sung in Heaven, that we on earth have never heard?The word inno (hymn) occurs six times in the poem in five passages (Inf.VII.125; Purg. VIII.17; XXV.127 & 129; here; Par. XIV.123). In the occurrencesprevious to this one the word has been used once antiphrastically, to denigratePlutus’s unintelligible shout, and then, in its next two appearances, to referto the hymns “Te lucis ante” and “Summae Deus clementiae,” respectively. Inother words, until now inno has either been used antiphrastically and thus in ageneral sense (i.e., “an utterance not like a hymn”) or with exactitude toindicate a particular Christian hymn. (For the final appearance of inno see thenote to Par. XIV.118–126.) Are we supposed to be able to identify this song? Itwould be unusual for Dante to have introduced a riddle without offering us thegrounds for solving it. We are looking for a song with two characteristics: itmust be unknown on earth and it almost certainly must be in celebration ofJesus’ victory over death. Is there such a song? John of Serravalle (1416)thought so: the last book of the Bible speaks of a canticum novum (new song)that is sung before the throne of God (Apocalypse 14:3), a citation found,surprisingly enough, only once again in the commentary tradition (Steiner [1921]and then possibly again, referred to glancingly but not definitively by Trucchi[1936]). Kaske (Kask.1974.1), pp. 206–7, however, while unaware that he had atleast two precursors, also sees a reference here to the canticum novum ofRevelation. Kaske cites Apocalypse 5:9, which is also apposite, if the similarpassage at 14:3 has a certain priority, as we shall see. In Revelation 5, Christcomes as a slain lamb (Apocalypse 5:6) to judge humankind, at which thetwenty-four elders and the four Gospel beasts lower themselves before the king(5:8) and sing a “new song” (canticum novum): “You are worthy to take the book,and to open the seals thereof; for you were slain and have redeemed us to God.…”(5:9, italics added). The related passage (Apocalypse 14:3) deepens theresonances with Purgatorio XXXII: “And they sang as it were a new song [canticumnovum] before the throne, and before the four beasts and the elders; and no mancould learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, who wereredeemed from earth” (italics added). It seems clear both what the song was andwhy it is not sung on earth. For the number of those in the procession as 144,the number of the 144,000 of the Church Triumphant, see the note to Purg.XXIX.145–150.

[part0015.html#c32-s22-e] Dante is willing to live dangerously. Whatother medieval poet, in a serious moment of a serious poem, would turn to Ovidand to self-conscious literary humor in a moment like this? Dante has already(Purg. XXIX.94–96; and see the note to that tercet) referred to this Ovidianmaterial (Metam. I.568–723) in these cantos dedicated to the recovery of Eden.He compares himself to Argus of the hundred eyes (Dante of the hundred cantos?),watching over Io at Juno’s behest so that Jove cannot get at his bovinegirlfriend, set to drowsiness and slumber (disastrously for him) by Mercury’stale of Syrinx and Pan. At what point does Argus fall asleep? Just whenMercury’s tale reports on the musical sound that issues from the reeds that wereSyrinx, who had escaped Pan’s lustful pursuit and vanished. Music and adisappearance are features of Dante’s scene, as well. The parallel scene is donewith witty aplomb but is dealt with by the commentators only as seriousbusiness. It is funny, as is Dante’s aside to us that, if he could portray themoment of falling asleep, he would do so. [return to English[part0015.html#c32-s22-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c32-s22-i]]70–71. [part0015.html#c32-s24-e] Dante’s sleep and awakening in the garden isverbally reminiscent of Ugolino’s description of his awakening from his dreadfuldream (Inf. XXXIII.27), the phrase “squarciò il velame” (the veil was rent)remembered in “squarciò il velo” (broke my veil of sleep [these are the only twooccurrences of that verb in the poem]). It also reminds us that each of thethree previous days on the mountain have ended in sleep and dream. On thisfourth day, which will conclude his experience of the earthly paradise at noon,instead he has this mystic sleep after he has had a final visionary experienceof the griffin and his Church.

[part0015.html#c32-s24-e] Rather than a reference to the “Surgite, etnolite timere” of Matthew 17:7, frequently cited in the commentaries (first byJacopo della Lana [1324]), Aversano (Aver.1988.1), p. 168, prefers to believethat Matelda refers to Paul’s words (Ephesians 5:14), “Surge qui dormis” (Rise,you who are sleeping). And see his remarks on Paul’s overall importance forDante, pp. 185–88. Nonetheless, the passage in Matthew seems still closer to thecontext here, so much so that it is all but impossible not to see it ascontrolling this scene: “And Jesus came and touched them and said, ‘Arise[Surgite] and be not afraid.’ And when they had lifted up their eyes they saw noman, save Jesus only.” See the next note.

[part0015.html#c32-s33-e] Since the nymphs are seven and since the“candles” leading the procession (last referred to at verse 18) are seven, andsince Benvenuto (1380) lent the hypothesis his considerable authority, somecommentators have believed that those candles are the lamps held by the sevenvirtues. Both because the seven candles seem a part of the procession of theChurch Triumphant and because they are extremely large, this hypothesis has notconvinced every reader. On the other hand, other suggestions are all minorityopinions. Francesco da Buti (1385) believed they represent the seven gifts ofthe Holy Spirit, but many find his argument overly subtle and unsupported by thetext. Torraca (1905) suggested the seven sacraments ordained by Christ.Bosco/Reggio (1979), uncomfortable with all earlier identifications, thought thereference was to the lamps of the wise virgins in the parable (Matthew 25:1–13)of the ten wise and foolish virgins; but the wise ones number only five. Pertile(1998.2), p. 198n., points (via Alain de Lille) to the “seven lamps of fireburning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God” (Apocalypse 4:5),thus giving support to Francesco da Buti’s view, which does seem the mostpalatable. For the biblical and postbiblical understanding of the winds fromnorth (Aquilo) and south (Auster) as being the most destructive, see Pertile(Pert.1998.2), pp. 197–202.

(Those who believe that she is speaking not of Dante’s next stay in thegarden but of that time left him on earth cannot rationalize the disjunctioncaused by the fact that when Dante returns to earth he will be without Beatrice,who speaks here only of being with him in Heaven.) Most commentators now alsoagree that Beatrice is not alluding to the few minutes he will now be with herin the garden, but to the short stay he will have in his second visit to theearthly paradise, after his death and ascent. She then looks past his first andupcoming visit to paradise in order to fasten his attention on his finaldestination, when he, too, will be, with her, a citizen of the City of God, thenew Jerusalem in which Christ is “Roman.” The “city of man” that is ourmilitancy on earth is to become the heavenly Rome presided over by Christ asemperor, at least it will be for all those who will find themselves saved.[return to English [part0015.html#c32-s34-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c32-s34-i]]103–105. [part0015.html#c32-s35-e] Beatrice’s charge to Dante is reminiscentof God’s to John, author of the Revelation: “What you see, write in a book, andsend it to the seven churches.…” (Apocalypse 1:11).

[part0015.html#c32-s37-e] The second pageant in the garden of Eden isboth dramatically different from the first and exactly like it. In the firstinstance we were given a description of the Church Triumphant (which exists asan ideal out of time and can only be gathered once history is done) that comesin a temporal form, moving from Genesis to the Apocalypse before Dante’s eyes.Now he sees real history, from just after the founding of the Church until thepresent, unfolding as a series of events performed in a sort of “dumbshow” in asingle place. However, both pageants are presented as allegories, reflectinghistory, to be sure, but experienced as though they were literally fictive(e.g., the books of the Bible, the griffin, the depredations of the Church),requiring the kind of critical procedure that we expect for what Dante himselfreferred to (Convivio II.i.4–5) as allegory as practiced by the poets.The rest of the canto will present the history of the Church and of the empireas these two entities make their related voyages through history. [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c32-s37-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c32-s37-i]]109–117. [part0015.html#c32-s37-e] The first tribulation of the new Church wasto be persecuted by the emperors of Rome, beginning with Nero (54–68) whilePeter was its first pope (and was crucified in the emperor’s persecution ofChristians ca. A.D. 68), and extending to the reign of Diocletian (284–305).While the eagle of Jove may signify variously, there is no doubt that here andthrough the rest of the pageant of the persecution of the Church Militant itrepresents the empire.

[part0015.html#c32-s40-e] Beatrice, acting as the embodiment of theChurch’s spirit (the chariot representing its physical being, as it were), isable to defeat the forces of heresy, the traditional interpretation of the fox.Portirelli (1804) identified the fox with the “vulpes insidiosos” (insidiousfoxes) of the Song of Solomon (Canticle 2:15). His adjective, however, is notfound in the biblical text, where the foxes are described only as “little,” andthe phrase in fact comes from St. Augustine, who identifies heresy and exactlysuch foxes in his Enarrationes in Ps. LXXX, as was noted by Tommaseo (1837). Thetemporal progression of these scenes would indicate that Dante is thinking ofthe early centuries of the Church’s history, after the first persecutions andbefore the Donation of Constantine (see the next note). [return to English[part0015.html#c32-s40-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c32-s40-i]]124–129. [part0015.html#c32-s42-e] All commentators agree that this invasionof the chariot by the eagle of empire represents the Donation of Constantine inthe first third of the fourth century (see note to Inf. XIX.115–117). The Churchwas meant to operate independently of the empire (this is the essential theme ofDante’s Monarchia). Here, by being given the “feathers” that belong to empirealone, it is adulterated from its pure form. In this formulation Dante reverseshis usual view, which involves seeing the empire’s rights and privileges asbeing curtailed by the Church. In a sense the point is even stronger expressedthis way: the Church is harmed by exercising its authority in the civil realm.Since the gloss of the Ottimo (1333), the voice from Heaven is generally takento be that of St. Peter. From the time of the earliest commentators, however,there was an understanding that Dante’s voice from Heaven was a sort of calqueon the story that, on the day of the Donation, a voice from Heaven was heardcalling out: “Hodie diffusum est venenum in ecclesia Dei” (Today the church ofGod is suffused by poison). [return to English [part0015.html#c32-s42-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c32-s42-i]]130–135. [part0015.html#c32-s44-e] While there is some debate about the natureof this particular calamity, most commentators believe it refers to the “schism”in the Church brought about by Mohammed just after the middle years of theseventh century (see the note to Inf. XXVIII.22–31 for Dante’s understanding ofthe relation of Islam to Christianity). [return to English[part0015.html#c32-s44-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c32-s44-i]]136–141. [part0015.html#c32-s46-e] In a sort of replay of the second calamity(the Donation of Constantine), the chariot is once again covered in imperialfeathers. The standard interpretation of these verses is that they refer to thegrants of lands to the Church by two French kings, Pepin and Charlemagne, in thesecond half of the eighth century.The “plumage,” which the poet suggests was “offered perhaps with kind andinnocent intent,” represents once again that which belonged to the empire byGod’s intent, and legally, in Dante’s view, could not be surrendered toecclesiastical authority, even though kings had chosen to do so. See ParadisoXX.55–57, where a similar expression is used to indicate that Constantine hadsinned grievously, if without meaning to. [return to English[part0015.html#c32-s46-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c32-s46-i]]142–147. [part0015.html#c32-s48-e] The language and the imagery are clearlyindebted to the Apocalypse (Apoc. 13:1) for the beast with seven heads and tenhorns. Exactly what this symbolic transformation of the Church signifies is muchdiscussed, with little resolution. In general, all can agree, we here see thecorruption wrought by the clergy upon their own institution. In other words, inDante’s view, the Church had weathered all attacks upon it from within andwithout until the time of Charlemagne. In the next five centuries she would dosuch harm to herself as to make those earlier wounds mortal. This period ismarked by corruption from the papacy down to the most modestly avaricious friar;Christianity has no enemies as implacable as its own ecclesiastical institutionsor its own clergy. [return to English [part0015.html#c32-s48-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c32-s48-i]]148–160. [part0015.html#c32-s50-e] Strictly speaking, this seventh and finalcalamity is a vision, since the Church only moved to Avignon in 1309 after theelection to the papacy of Clement V in 1305. We have now surveyed, in 52 verses,nearly thirteen centuries of the history of the Church.The harlot and the giant, the whore of Babylon “with whom the kings of the earthhave committed fornication” (Apocalypse 17:2) and Philip IV of France, bring theterrible history to its conclusion. The chariot no longer has to do withBeatrice, replaced by this wanton spirit that gives herself to all and any, andis now controlled by France. Dante’s reaction to the “Avignonian captivity” isproof, if any is needed, that he is not the Protestant avant la lettre that somehave tried to find in him. Indeed, the last and only potentially (if fleeting)hopeful sign we find in the gradually darkening antitriumph of the ChurchMilitant is that the whore gazes on Dante, thus gaining for herself a beatingfrom her gigantic paramour. What does Dante represent now? Is he the embodimentof the truly faithful Christians who hope that their Church will be cleansed? ofthe Italian faithful left back on this side of the Alps? or is he Dante himself?This penultimate detail of a difficult and encompassing allegorical pageant hasleft many readers perplexed. Its final one is clear in its pessimism. The giantresponds to his lover’s wayward glance by releasing the chariot from its bindingto the tree and dragging it deeper into the forest, which now looks less likeEden than it resembles France. [return to English [part0015.html#c32-s50-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c32-s50-i]]PURGATORIO XXXIII1–3. [part0015.html#c33-s1-e] The last canto of Purgatorio begins, like thoseof Inferno and Paradiso, with poetry (see Inf. XXXIV.1 and Par. XXXIII.1–39). Inall three cases, the poem cited is in another voice than Dante’s. In the firsttwo cases this voice is Latin, first that of Venantius Fortunatus (his hymn ofthe cross), now that of David (his hymn for the desolation of Jerusalem, Psalm78 [79], which begins, “O God, the heathen have come into your inheritance”).Thus do the seven virtues respond to the present culminating moment in thehistory of the Church Militant. As Benvenuto explains (1380), just as thevarious gentile nations had invaded and oppressed the Holy Land because of thesins of the Jews, so now has God again allowed foreigners, in this case theFrench, to take possession of Holy Church because of the sins of the latter-day“Romans.” [return to English [part0015.html#c33-s1-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c33-s1-i]]7–12. [part0015.html#c33-s3-e] The words that Beatrice sings reflect closelyJesus’ words to his disciples (John 16:16), “A little while and you shall notsee me; and again a little while and you shall see me, because I go to theFather.” Since the disciples are puzzled by these words, Jesus explains them:Now they may weep, but their sorrow will be turned to joy (John 16:20). Thedisciples are finally won over, finally believe that Jesus comes from God (John16:30). Jesus ends his remarks by promising them peace after their tribulationand concludes, “I have overcome the world” (John 16:33). Thus do these twelveopening verses of the last canto of Purgatorio move from a tragic sense of lossto a celebratory and comic vision of the eventual triumph of Christ and hisChurch.Beatrice’s words also have a particular and local meaning for Dante, who wept ather death and thought he had lost her forever; she has come back into his life.[return to English [part0015.html#c33-s3-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c33-s3-i]]13–15. [part0015.html#c33-s5-e] This tercet reminds the reader exactly who ispresent in this scene (see the note to Purg. XXXII.88), Beatrice, her handmaids(the seven virtues), Dante, Matelda, and Statius. Not only is the ChurchTriumphant no longer in sight, the Church Militant has been dragged off toFrance.The way in which Statius is referred to (“the sage who had remained”) remindsthe reader, yet again, of the absence of Virgil, denied this moment. [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c33-s5-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c33-s5-i]]16–18. [part0015.html#c33-s6-e] Those that allegorize the nine steps taken byBeatrice argue that they represent the years between the accession of PopeClement V in 1305, who agreed to King Philip’s desire to move the papacy toFrance (which he did in 1309), and the deaths of Clement and Philip in 1314,thus possibly allowing the tenth step to point to the advent of the new leaderin 1315. About such things there can be little or no certainty, but thehypothesis is attractive. Nonetheless, one should probably be aware that, exceptfor a rather contorted effort by Francesco da Buti (1385), none of the earlycommentators, generally so fond of allegorizing, offers anything more than aliteral reading of the detail. The allegorical reading of the ten steps as tenyears is a nineteenth- and twentieth-century discovery, e.g., as it is found inCarroll (1904).

[part0015.html#c33-s8-e] This is the first time Beatrice addresses Danteas “brother.” One senses, again, that her desire to rebuke Dante is(temporarily) suspended. But see vv. 85–90.Beatrice for the first time, and in keeping with the spirit of her citation ofJohn 16:16 in vv. 10–12, turns her attention to the future, and to Dante’sfuture, now that the world’s and his own sinful past have been dealt with.[return to English [part0015.html#c33-s8-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c33-s8-i]]25–28. [part0015.html#c33-s9-e] Benvenuto (1380) compares Dante to a studentin the presence of his teacher, and indeed this is the opening moment in whatmight be called Dante’s education in theology, which will last for anotherthirty cantos.

[part0015.html#c33-s11-e] Before she presents her prophecy, Beatricecharges Dante with the responsibility for reporting it precisely, not in themode of a man who is talking in his sleep. Almost all the commentators take thepassage literally and as applying in some general way. But Beatrice’s words arevery hard on poor Dante, since she makes it clear that, at least in her(infallible) opinion, his actual words, uttered at some previous time, haveindeed been correctly characterized in this way. But when? Perhaps the laterpassage in this canto (vv. 85–90) that is devoted to his previous intellectualmeanderings may shed some light on exactly what she means. For now the subjectis left unexplored. [return to English [part0015.html#c33-s11-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c33-s11-i]]34–36. [part0015.html#c33-s12-e] The language, referring to the destruction ofthe Church as detailed in the preceding canto, is distinctly reflective of theApocalypse (Apoc. 17:8, “The beast that you saw was, and is not”).The word suppe (here translated “hindrance” only to make sense in its context)has been variously understood. Many of the early commentators believed itreferred to the cakes left on the tomb of a murderer’s victim in a Greek customreborn in Florence; if the murderer came to the tomb and ate of these cakes fornine consecutive days, he would then be safe from the offended family’svengeance (and for that reason the families of the slain person would keep watchover the tomb). See Portirelli (1804) for a restatement of this interpretation,which is at least as old as the commentary of Jacopo della Lana. Others thinkthe reference is to the bread soaked in wine on which an oath is sworn betweenvassal and lord; still others of the offal which the veltro will despise (seeInf.

[part0015.html#c33-s13-e] The opening verses of Beatrice’s extendedprophecy seem clearly to indicate that the one who will come is related to theeagle of empire, i.e., that beneficent Roman empire that had begun so well underAugustus and then had become corrupt. It seems difficult to believe that this,as some maintain, is not an imperial prophecy. [return to English[part0015.html#c33-s13-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c33-s13-i]]43–45. [part0015.html#c33-s15-e] This enigmatic passage has drawn anextraordinary amount of contradictory opinion. For a review of the entirequestion, see Pietro Mazzamuto, “Cinquecento diece e cinque,” ED II (1970), pp.10b–14b. It is also helpful to consult Charles Davis’s similar review of thefirst and similar prophecy in the poem, the veltro (hound) of Inferno I.101(“veltro,” ED V [1976], pp. 908a–912b). Most now argue, whether or not theybelieve that the number, if expressed by the Roman numerals DXV, is an anagramof DUX (or “leader” [the Roman “V” and “U” being equivalent letters]), that thecontext of the passage makes it apparent that Beatrice is here indicating theadvent of a temporal leader, one who will deal with the excesses of the king ofFrance and the delinquent Church. Further, if the canto is taken as having beenwritten before his death in August 1313, many believe that the prophecy pointsto Henry VII. Some also believe that if the first reference is to a politicalleader, it also points beyond him to the second coming of Christ, the finalemperor. See Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 184–90, and the note to InfernoI.100–105. A standard and useful treatment of the problem remains that of Moore(Moor.1903.1), pp. 253–83. [return to English [part0015.html#c33-s15-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c33-s15-i]]46–51. [part0015.html#c33-s16-e] The general sense of this passage is clear:future events will make plain the terms of the cloudy prophecy, which iscompared to those made by Themis (Ovid, Metam. I.375–394) and by the Sphinx.Both of these monstrous females later appear in the same passage in Ovid (Metam.VII.759–765), where their hatred of humans is, as here, described in terms ofthe loss of human and animal life in the countryside. The key lines in themodern text of Ovid run as follows: “Carmina Laïades non intellecta priorum /solverat ingeniis …” (The son of Laius [Oedipus] solved the riddles which hadbaffled the intellects of all before him). We are close to being absolutelysure, however, that the text as Dante knew it substituted “Naïades” for“Laïades” and showed a plural form of the verb (solverant). And so Dantebelieved that it was the Naiads, water nymphs, who had solved the riddle of theSphinx. This was the cruel monster who cast herself down from her rock, whenceshe had been killing clueless Thebans, once Oedipus realized that the variouslyfooted creature in her riddle was man (the story that we know from Sophocles’Oedipus, unknown, like nearly all of Greek letters, to Dante).Dante does not “nod” often, but this is one of the most egregious errors in theComedy, even if it has some reasonable excuse behind it. In fact, all of theearly commentators accept Dante’s reading, thus indicating that their texts alsohad “Naiads” where they should have had Laius’s son. The better reading had towait for Nikolaes Heinsius (1620–81), the Dutch Latin poet and scholar, one ofthe great Renaissance textual editors of the Latin classics. His edition(Florence, 1646) of the Metamorphoses restored the reading Laïades. It is thusonly with the commentary of Venturi (1732) that the better reading is made knownto the world of Dante’s commentators, and even then some of them try to objectto it, seeking a way to understand the Naiads as interpreters of propheticutterance. Ghisalberti (Ghis.1932.1) offers a comprehensive discussion of theproblem. [return to English [part0015.html#c33-s16-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c33-s16-i]]52. [part0015.html#c33-s18-e] Beatrice’s use of the verb notare here mayremind us of its last use with this sense (setting something down as a text) inDante’s self-description as inspired poet, one who only records what he hearsfrom the “dictator” (Purg. XXIV.53). [return to English[part0015.html#c33-s18-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c33-s18-i]]54. [part0015.html#c33-s18-e] Dante’s often admired phrase, describing life asa “correre alla morte” (race to death) reflects St. Augustine (DcD XIII.10):“Our time for this life is nothing other than a race to death (cursus admortem),” as was suggested by Mattalia (1960).

[part0015.html#c33-s19-e] As her scribe, Dante is instructed byBeatrice not to conceal from his eventual readers the condition of the tree, nowrobbed of its possessions twice. Bosco/Reggio (1979) review the divided opinionsof the early commentators, who variously believe that the reference is to Adamand the giant, to Adam and the eagle, or to the eagle and the giant. In theirview, all three seem plausible glosses. However, it has seemed to others that,since, from Beatrice’s words we gather that Dante has witnessed these twodevastations (and not that of Adam, which is referred to in a following tercet[vv. 61–63]), it is the first and last attacks upon the tree that are referredto here: its defoliation by the eagle (the imperial persecutions of Purg.XXXII.112–114) and its having the chariot detached from it by the giant (theremoval to Avignon, referred to in Purg. XXXII.158). [return to English[part0015.html#c33-s19-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c33-s19-i]]58–63. [part0015.html#c33-s20-e] Beatrice’s accusation now widens, blamingAdam as the first despoiler of the tree and praising Christ for redeeming him.For the calculation of the length of Adam’s life (930 years) and of hispunishment in Limbo (4,302 years) see Paradiso XXVI.118–120 and the note to thatpassage.

[part0015.html#c33-s24-e] The word “moralmente” was understood, even insome of the earliest commentators (e.g., Jacopo della Lana [1324]), as having atechnical meaning here, i.e., “con lo senso tropologico” (with the tropological[i.e., third] sense [of fourfold exegesis of the Bible]). See the section onallegory in the introduction to Inferno. Various later commentators are of thesame opinion, e.g., Tommaseo (1837), Scartazzini (1900), Poletto (1894). Whatthis signifies is that the meaning applies now to current history. God’soriginal “interdiction,” broken by Adam, whose sin was redeemed by the cross onwhich Christ sacrificed Himself, is now binding on us, as well, even though weare at least potentially saved. Even now we, new Adams, are not meant to eat ofthe Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. [return to English[part0015.html#c33-s24-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c33-s24-i]]77–78. [part0015.html#c33-s26-e] That is, Dante, bringing back this message,will seem like a pilgrim returned from the Holy Land, his “staff” decorated withthe sign of the distant and holy place to which he has been.

[part0015.html#c33-s27-e] These lines offer a fairly rare instance of aspeaker in the poem expressing himself by use of a simile. Dante is saying thatwhat Beatrice tells him seems to be completely clear, but that he really cannotunderstand what she means.

[part0015.html#c33-s29-e] Beatrice is charging Dante with havingattempted to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. As somecommentators (e.g., the Ottimo [1333], Scartazzini [1900]) have understood, thepoint here seems to be that Dante turned from theology to philosophy in hiseffort to do that. The current majority view of the nature of Dante’s aberrationis well represented by Bosco/Reggio (1979): Dante had, in the Convivio, settheology to one side in order to study philosophy, a decision he now deplores.For the notion that this fairly common view is incorrect, see Scott(Scot.1991.1). [return to English [part0015.html#c33-s29-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c33-s29-i]]94–99. [part0015.html#c33-s32-e] Beatrice’s response to Dante is worthy of theInquisition. That he can no longer remember his sins (because he has drunk fromLethe, the river of oblivion) is proof that he had committed them.

[part0015.html#c33-s33-e] Dante’s phrasing, “if from seeing smoke we arguethere is fire,” might remind a reader of St. Augustine’s discussion of signs inDe doctrina christiana (II.i.1): “A sign is a thing that causes us to think ofsomething beyond the impression the thing itself makes on the senses. Thus, ifwe see a track, we think of the animal that made the track; if we see smoke, weknow that there is a fire that causes it” (translation adapted from that of D.W. Robertson, Jr., italics added).

[part0015.html#c33-s34-e] Not only does Beatrice speak more plainlyfor the rest of this canto, but the poet does as well, allowing most of hisverse to be more immediately understandable than is his custom.

[part0015.html#c33-s35-e] The sun takes “slower steps” the higher itis above us, moving quickest at dawn and dusk, slowest as it approaches anddeparts from noon. While the absolute position of the sun is not in doubt, theearthly observer will have a sense of the location of the meridian circlecontaining it that varies according to that observer’s position.

[part0015.html#c33-s38-e] Dante indicates to the reader that he knowsvery well that the rivers in the garden of Eden in fact (i.e., in Genesis 2:14)include Tigris and Euphrates (and not Lethe and Eunoe, which are here by hisinvention). See the note to Purgatorio XXVIII.127–132. [return to English[part0015.html#c33-s38-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c33-s38-i]]119. [part0015.html#c33-s40-e] While it is only now that we hear Matelda’sname, we have observed her actions so long that we may feel that we understandher function. See the notes to Purgatorio XXVIII.1 and 40–42. [return to English[part0015.html#c33-s40-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c33-s40-i]]121–123. [part0015.html#c33-s41-e] Matelda did indeed tell Dante the name ofthis river (Eunoe) at Purgatorio XXVIII.131. As opposed to his forgetting hissins in Lethe he is now forgetting the promise of that good resolution of hisplight, so deeply, we may well imagine, has he been stung by Beatrice’saccusations. [return to English [part0015.html#c33-s41-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c33-s41-i]]128–135. [part0015.html#c33-s43-e] Only now, and in less than completely clearterms, do we learn about Matelda’s function in the garden, which seems to be toserve as “baptizer” of the souls as they finish their purification, first inLethe (as she draws Dante through that river at Purg. XXXI.91–102) and finallyin Eunoe. There is a dispute as to whether or not Matelda’s role in the gardenis Dante-specific (which it has been, from all that we have seen, until now) or“universal” (see the note to Purg. XXVIII.40–42). Indeed, Contini has argued(Cont.1976.1), p. 174n., that the verb usa (as you are accustomed) in thepresent tense should be understood as a past definite (già praticasti [as onceyou used to]) and thus implies that Matelda had such a role in Dante’s earlierlife. This is a case of interpreting (or indeed revising) the text in order tocreate or preserve a desired interpretation. Contini’s point would be worthconsidering except for a single, crucial, and indeed determinative final point,Matelda’s last words in the poem, which are addressed to Statius (vv. 134–135):“Now come with him.” Thus, and only at the very last moment, we learn thatMatelda’s function in the garden is not limited to ministrations on behalf ofDante alone (i.e., she deals either with all the saved souls who come throughhere or with some of them). (See Filippo Villani’s similar view in Bellomo’sedition of his commentary to Inf. I [Bell.1989.1], p. 92, n. 90.) To be sure,Dante alone is mentioned as receiving her ministrations at the river Lethe(Purg. XXXI.91–105). From this later passage, however, we are probably forced toconsent to the notion that she there presided over Statius’s submersion as wellas Dante’s, a scene that, like much involving Statius’s (and Virgil’s) presencein the garden, is allowed to disappear from Dante’s page. For this view seeSingleton (Sing.1958.1), p. 181, n. 17. [return to English[part0015.html#c33-s43-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c33-s43-i]]136–141. [part0015.html#c33-s46-e] This seventh and last Purgatorial addressto the reader opens a new subject that the poet will share with us, the formalrequirements of his poem. If he had more space (another few lines? anothercanto?), he would tell us what Eunoe tasted like. The early commentators thinkthat he means that he has run out of cantos (i.e., he cannot have athirty-fourth as he did for Inferno). Tozer (1901) was perhaps the first tothink that it was the number of verses in each cantica (4,720, 4,755, 4,758respectively) that Dante refers to. That seems a possible, if dubious,hypothesis. We might also note that he had just completed the longest canto inthe entire work in the preceding one (XXXII is 160 lines long), and ostensiblythus had available at least fifteen more lines. Thomas Hart (Hart.1995.1)reviews his copious work that would have us believe, among other things, thatall the canto lengths of the poem were decided by Dante early on. (For arejoinder see the note to Inf. VI.28–32.) [return to English[part0015.html#c33-s46-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c33-s46-i]]142–145. [part0015.html#c33-s48-e] The phrasing, with all its repeated “ri”sounds, reminiscent of the resurrective surge at the opening of the cantica(Purg. I.18), underlines the reconstituted innocence of this Adamic being.Scartazzini suggests that we should hear, in verse 144, a resonance of St. Paul(Ephesians 4:23), “And be renewed in the spirit of your mind.”That the three cantiche all end with the word stelle (stars) is no longer asurprise. It is important to attempt to imagine the effect of this repetition ona reader who does not know that it is coming, who is suddenly jarred intorealizing the pattern, into realizing the shaping force of divine beauty on thispoem.

For those interested in the general condition of Dantean bibliography,however, a few remarks may be helpful.Since an extended bibliography for the study of Dante includes tens of thousandsof items, those who deal with the subjects that branch out from the works ofthis writer are condemned to immoderate labor and a sense that they are alwaysmissing something important. While even half a century ago it was possible todevelop, in a single treatment, a fairly thorough compendium of the mostsignificant items (e.g., S. A. Chimenz, Dante, in Letteratura italiana. Imaggiori [Milan: Marzorati, 1954], pp. 85–109), the situation today wouldrequire far more space. Fortunately, the extraordinary scholarly toolrepresented by the Enciclopedia dantesca, dir. U. Bosco, 6 vols. (Rome, Istitutodella Enciclopedia Italiana, 1970–78—henceforth ED), has given Dante studies itssingle most important bibliographical resource, leaving only the last quartercentury—which happens to be the most active period in the history of Dantestudies—uncovered. However, for the years 1965–90, Enzo Esposito has edited ahelpful guide, Dalla bibliografia alla storiografia: la bibliografia dantescanel mondo dal 1965–1990 (Ravenna: Longo, 1995). A closer analysis of a shorterperiod is available in “Bibliografia Dantesca 1972–1977,” ed. LeonellaCoglievina, Studi Danteschi 60 (1988): 35–314 (presenting 3121 items for thisfive-year period). The bibliography in ED, vol. 6, pp. 499–618 (a length thatgives some sense of the amount of basic information available), contains ca.5,000 items and is of considerable use, breaking its materials into convenientcategories. (Its bibliography of bibliographies alone runs six double-columnpages, pp. 542–47.) The ED also, of course, contains important bibliographicalindications in many of its entries. A major new English source forbibliographical information is The Dante Encyclopedia, ed. Richard Lansing (NewYork: Garland, 2000).In the past dozen years, Dante studies, perhaps more than any otherpostclassical area of literature, has moved into “the computer age.” There is agrowing online bibliography available, developed from the bibliography ofAmerican Dante studies, overseen by Richard Lansing for the Dante Society ofAmerica, which includes an increasing number of Italian items(http://www.princeton.edu/~dante [http://www.princeton.edu/~dante]). Someseventy-five commentaries to the Commedia are now available through theDartmouth Dante Project (opened 1988) [www.dante.dartmouth.edu[http://www.dante.dartmouth.edu]]. There is also the Princeton Dante Project(http://www.princeton.edu/dante [http://www.princeton.edu/dante]), a multimediaedition of the Commedia (open to public use since 1999) overseen by RobertHollander, which also functions as an entry point to most of the many Dantesites on the Web, including Otfried Lieberknecht’s site in Berlin, which is asource of an enormous amount of information about Dante in electronic form, and,since the autumn of 2000, the site being developed by the Società DantescaItaliana (www.danteonline.it [http://www.danteonline.it]).LIST OF WORKS CITED IN THE NOTESAbra.1985.1Abrams, Richard, “Illicit Pleasures: Dante among the Sensualists (PurgatorioXXVI),” Modern Language Notes 100 (1985): 1–41.Alfi.1998.1Alfie, Fabian, “For Want of a Nail: The Guerri-Lanza-Cursietti ArgumentRegarding the Tenzone,” Dante Studies 116 (1998): 141–59.Anto.2001.1Antonelli, Roberto, “Cavalcanti e Dante: al di qua del Paradiso,” in Dante: daFirenze all’aldilà.

The Hollanders capture each and everyaccent in Dante, from the soft-spoken, effusive stilnovista poet, to thewrathful Florentine exile, to the disillusioned man who would become what many,including T.S. Eliot, consider the best poet who ever lived. The Hollanders’adaptation is not only an intelligent reader’s Dante, but it is meant toenlighten and to move and ultimately to give us a Dante so versatile that hecould at once soar to the hereafter and remain unflinchingly earthbound.”—André Aciman, author of Out of Egypt: A Memoir“The notes following each canto, besides being up-to-date in scholarly terms,and full of the insight produced by decades of teaching, reflection, andscholarship, are of genuinely useful length and pertinence. The decisions theymade about the translation seem completely successful.…This is the translationfor our time and probably beyond.”—National Review“A brisk, vivid, readable—and scrupulously subtle—translation, coupled withexcellent notes and commentary. Every lover of Dante in English should have thisvolume.”—Alicia Ostriker“This new version of The Inferno wonderfully captures the concision, directness,and pungency of Dante’s style. Like a mirror, it reflects with clarity andprecision the Italian original. Each canto’s set of copious, authoritative notescomplements the facing-page Italian and English translation. A grandachievement.”—Richard Lansing, Professor of Comparative Literature, Brandeis University“English-speaking lovers of Dante are doubly in the Hollanders’ debt: first, forthis splendidly lucid and eminently readable version of Dante’s Hell, andsecond, for the provocative, elegantly written commentary, which judiciouslysynthesizes a lifetime of deeply engaged, wide-ranging scholarship, as well asthe past six centuries of commentary on the poem. No student of Dante would wantto be without it.”—John Ahern, Antolini Professor of Italian Literature, Vassar College“This new Hollander translation deserves to sweep the field.…Robert and JeanHollander, both practicing published poets, have produced an English text ofremarkable poetic sensitivity while never traducing the original Italian orpretending to supplant Dante’s poem with one of their own. They have given usThe Inferno in English, not a modern poetic medley on themes by Dante. AndRobert Hollander has supplied precisely that kind of commentary the student orgeneral reader needs—an economical and graceful edifice of explanatory notesresting firmly on a foundation, massive and deep, yet invisible and thereforenot distracting to the reader’s eye, of the erudition of a lifetime’s study ofthe medieval Italian poets.”—John Fleming, Professor of English and Comparative Literature, PrincetonUniversity"},{"pageContent":"ALSO BY JEAN HOLLANDERCrushed into Honey: PoemsHugo von Hoffmansthal, The Woman without a Shadow (translator)I Am My Own Woman: The Outlaw Life of Charlotte Von Mahlsdorf, Berlin’s MostDistinguished Transvestite (translator)Moondog: PoemsALSO BY ROBERT HOLLANDERAllegory in Dante’s CommediaWalking on Dante: PoemsBoccaccio’s Two VenusesStudies in DanteIl Virgilio dantesco: Tragedìa nella “Commedia”André Malraux, The Temptation of the West (translator)Giovanni Boccaccio, Amorosa Visione (translated withTimothy Hampton and Margherita Frankel)Boccaccio’s Last Fiction: Il CorbaccioDante and Paul’s “five words with understanding”Dante’s Epistle to CangrandeBoccaccio’s Dante and the Shaping Force of SatireDante: A Life in WorksThe Dartmouth Dante Project (founder and director)The Princeton Dante Project (founder and director)"}]
