Paradiso, however, presents some challengesdifferent from those encountered in the first two cantiche. Needless to say, wehave again attempted to give as accurate a sense of the poetry and meaning ofthe Italian text as the English language and our abilities allow. The languageand style of this part of the poem are, in many respects, dramatically differentfrom those to which the reader has become accustomed in the previous cantiche.As we suggested in the front matter for the second volume, “While surely we mustacknowledge that Inferno and Purgatorio are very different poetic places, theynonetheless maintain some arrestingly similar elements. From the vantage pointof Paradiso the second canticle looks much more like its predecessor than likeits successor.” Indeed, Paradiso is not only unique within Dante’s oeuvre; it issimply unique. Theology set to music, as it were, it pushes its reader (not tomention its translators) to the limit.A particular problem facing translators of the Paradiso involves one of itsdistinguishing features: neologisms, or words new to the Italian language andessentially invented by their creator. The current estimate of the number ofneologisms in the poem runs to around ninety, with the great bulk of theseappearing in Paradiso (see Ferrante [Ferr.1983.1], p. 131, n. 10). It seemsappropriate that the requirements of expressing the higher realities of God’srealm involve linguistic novelties of the most radical kind. Some of these wehave attempted to bring over into English, when Dante’s coinage seems sostriking that any reader would have to pay astonished attention to the violencedone “standard Italian”; for example, the verb intrearsi (Par. XIII.57),literally “to inthree itself,” which Dante employs to speak of the Holy Spirit’sinvolvement with the other two Persons of the Trinity, and which we havetranslated with an English neologism, “the Love that is intrined with them.”Others we have not, especially when it seemed to us that his usage borders onthe “ordinarily daring” language one associates with almost any poetic making,for example, the verb ingigliarsi (Par. XVIII.113), which literally means “toenlily itself,” but is fairly obviously meant to indicate what our translationsuggests it does, i.e., “to make itself into a lily.” In other words, the firstclass of neologisms is the linguistic equivalent of self-consciously audaciousmetaphor, and, like it, is obviously intended to make a reader reel, while thesecond is closer to our normal expectations of heightened poetic language; itmay surprise, but does not shock. It is, naturally, not exactly easy to makesuch distinctions. It is also true that the difficulty of bringing the effect ofa neologism into a second language is another complicating factor. SometimesDante’s daring thrusts simply do not “feel right” in English. In short, thereader should be aware that our practice in this regard is various.We are once again grateful to two friends born in Italy and born to Dante fortheir willingness to sample our translations and my footnotes with a knowingeye. Margherita Frankel, formerly a professor of Italian at New York University,was her usual careful and exacting self as she examined our materials. The samemust be said of Simone Marchesi, who studied with me when he was a graduatestudent at Princeton and has now returned to the university to teach studentshow to read Dante in his own courses. We are pleased to express our continuinggratitude to them both. This translation has brought us into contact with peoplewhom we did not know before. It has been pleasing to hear from readers in thiscountry, England, and Australia who have enjoyed our English-speaking Dante. Andtwo of them were not only appreciative, but helpful. Professors of law ClaytonGillette (NYU) and Stephen Morse (Pennsylvania) paid for their enjoyment ofInferno by reading the penultimate drafts of Purgatorio and of Paradiso andsharing their questions and comments with us; we are deeply grateful to both ofthem, in part for demonstrating to me exactly why I have always used theadjective “lawyerly” (as in “a lawyerly argument”) in a positive sense. Finally,I would like to acknowledge those graduate students who worked with me on thiscantica, first in 1980 (Carolyn Calvert Phipps, Micaela Janan, Albert Rossi,Stephen Rupp, Alex Sheers) and then in 1986 (Sheila Colwell, Roberta Davidson,Martin Elzinga, Frank Ordiway, Lauren Scancarelli Seem). I hope that theirmemories of those seminars glow half as bright as mine.Gerald Howard, in addition to his more significant titles and duties at RandomHouse, has been our editor for some years now. It was his support that madepublication of our work possible and his continuing clear-headed and keen-eyededitorial supervision that has helped keep the project on an even keel. And weare grateful as well to all at Random House and Anchor Books (including threeformer students of mine at Princeton: Rakesh Satyal, Alice Van Straalen, andAnne Merrow) who have taken such obvious pleasure in their association with thisproject.27 November 2005 (Hopewell)This first Anchor edition has some sixty changes in the translation, some thirtyin the commentary, and six additions to the bibliography.30 January 2008 (Hopewell)This second edition includes some dozen changes in the translation and somefifty in the notes.18 January 2012 (Hopewell)"},{"pageContent":"TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS & LIST OF COMMENTATORS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.

Indeed, the subjects treated in thelast cantica represent both implausible and daring choices for a poet (anawareness reflected in the title of the three-part Canadian BroadcastingCorporation’s series for radio in 2002, Dante, Poet of the Impossible). In fact,it seems almost beyond human capacity to have written the Comedy. The whole poemmight be considered an experiment in pushing back the boundaries of humanexpression, at times surprising even its creator. What is most surprising (and,to some, offensive) is the incorporation of subjects previously reservedexclusively for prose in an Italian poem: for example, moral philosophy (Inf. XIand Purg. XVI) and biology (Purg. XXV). However, this tactic becomes mostnoteworthy in Paradiso. There we find astronomy (Par. II, where Dante takes onthe task of a Ptolemy or an Alfraganus); free will (Canto V, where he rehearsesthis topic so dear to Augustine); the theology of history (VI, Orosius);municipal politics (XVI, Cicero and Brunetto Latini); and angelology and itsrelation to astronomy (XXVIII–XXIX, the Pseudo-Dionysius). If the entire projectof the Divine Comedy must have caused its author understandable anxiety, thechoice of a strategy for making the part of the poem that is called Paradisomust have caused its author considerable effort in wrestling with weightyconcerns. If Giorgio Petrocchi’s work to establish the dates of composition forthe various parts of the poem is correct (and it must be considered aprovisional, if still the most convincing, attempt), Dante spent the years 1313to 1317 revising Inferno and Purgatorio, and planning Paradiso (see Petrocchi[Petr.1957.1 and Petr.1969.1]). Perhaps because of the time he took forrevision, only occasionally in the first two cantiche does one sense Dantelaboring under his load (as, one might suggest, is apparent in the opening fiftyor so verses of Inferno I). There is a “finished” quality to the first twocantiche that Paradiso sometimes does not have. To take a single example, thetext of Canto III clearly suggests that Dante originally planned to portray thesouls of the saved as dwelling in the stars (indeed, any number of commentatorsforget themselves from time to time and display a similar misunderstanding),while Canto IV makes it plain that they are ordinarily to be found in theEmpyrean [pronounced em-PEER-ian] and only on this very special occasionmanifest themselves to a celestial visitor in each of the first eight heavens.Further, a passage in Canto IX seems to drop back into the same mistakeoverruled in Canto IV. It is possible that a later revision of the poem wouldhave done a better job ironing out this rather alarming inconsistency. And theissue seems worth raising. Are we reading, in Paradiso, less finished work thanwe found in the first two cantiche? Given the near-total absence of any hardevidence (there is anecdotal reference, narrated by Boccaccio in his biographyof Dante, to the discovery of the last thirteen cantos by the poet’s sons onlyafter his death), a resolution of this question is probably not possible.Even a veteran reader is startled each time he or she begins rereading the thirdcantica of this “theological epic.” For here the usual accoutrements of poeticnarrative are downstaged by the language of Scholastic discourse and, finally,of mystical devotion. Dante’s Paradiso is surely one of the most daring poeticinitiatives we have—perhaps it is simply the most daring. Its extraordinarypopular success (in December 2002, Roberto Benigni recited and discussed itsfinal canto before an Italian television audience reported to be more than 12million in number) is testament to Dante’s stubbornness and to his genius. Itsat times endless-seeming theological disquisitions, to be sure, have addled manya reader; one finds few who will claim (or admit) that it is their favoritecantica. At the same time, the poetic technique found in it reflects a supremeconfidence and, in its greatest moments, attains a sublimity that sweeps allcynicism before it. It is perhaps worth the effort to report on one’s ownexperience in this regard. The writer has twice offered graduate seminars onParadiso at Princeton (in 1980 and 1986). In both of these, the same thinghappened. His students found the going difficult (as did he). They did not lookforward to breaking their heads each week over the niceties of Scholasticdistinction and other arcana. Nonetheless, once each seminar began, it was asthough all present became a single instrument working toward a commonunderstanding (perhaps in unconscious imitation of the speaking eagle in theheaven of Jupiter). Rarely have seminars flown by so quickly for all involved(or so it was reported even by the students), and rarely have students taughttheir teacher quite so well. Paradiso is certainly the most challenging part ofthe poem, but may also be the most rewarding for those who give themselves to itand let it do its work on them.(2) A Poem of the Stars.This poem about a journey through the heavens has little to do with our ownnotions of astronomy. (For Dante’s astronomy see, in English, at least Moore[Moor.1903.1], pp. 1–108; Orr [Orr.1914.1]; and Cornish [Corn. 2000.2]).Measured in the time that the protagonist is absent from the earth, the Paradisoseems to take a little more than twenty-four hours, although the temporalindications are less precise than they have been in the first two cantiche. Hezooms up from the garden of Eden at noon on Wednesday, March 30 (or April 13,depending on the view of the matter accepted by the reader’s favorite discussantof the problem—see the notes to Inf. I.1 and Inf. XXI.38) and returns to earthsometime during the evening of the next day. This return is the only temporallyunmarked portion of his reported voyage to the three realms of the afterworld,but the rough indications found in crucial passages late in the canticaencourage us to believe that the completed adventure, which ostensibly ends withthe undescribed reentry of the protagonist, has taken one week, Thursday eveningto Thursday evening. Giovanni Agnelli (Agne.1891.1), Table XI, has tried todemonstrate that the time consumed by Dante’s trip through Paradise takesexactly twenty-four hours (with some timeless time allowed for the visionaryfinal four cantos). But even a rough calculation of the duration of time aspresented in the text itself would seem to show that the time Dante spent in theheavens, as measured by earthly duration, is somewhat more than twenty-fourhours (see the note to Par. XXVII.79–81). The first twenty-four hours were spenton earth and began Thursday evening (Inf. I and II); the next full day wasconsumed exploring Hell (Inf. III–XXXIV.69); and the next in the ascent to seeagain the stars (Inf. XXXIV.70–139), which brings us to 6 pm on Sunday eveningJerusalem time, or 6 am Sunday morning at the Antipodes, where begins thethree-and-one-half-day trip up the mountain (what we call Purgatory) that endedwith our hero in the earthly paradise at the propitious time of noon.The heavens, conceived by Dante and the astronomers of his time as a series ofconcentric circular spheres, nine in all, surrounding the center of theuniverse, this our paltry earth, are formed by transparent crystal bodies, thefirst seven of which each mounts a single gem. These for Dante are the planets:Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. (In Dante’s eyes, they allshine with their own light alone.) The eighth sphere contains all the otherstars (shining with reflected light, once again precisely reversing theunderstanding of our time). The ninth, the Primum Mobile or Crystalline Sphere,contains no other physical body besides itself, but, by loving God, propels themovement of the entire universe. Strictly speaking, Dante’s physical universecontains only these nine spheres. Surmounting it, existing beyond time and spaceand yet containing all space and time, is the home of God, of the angels, and ofthe souls of the saved (with seats reserved for those few yet to come). Thisplaceless place is known as the Empyrean. As we will learn in Cantos III and IV(and the learning is not come by easily), no soul whom we meet in the eightlower spheres actually has a home in them, but has only appeared in a particularsphere to give Dante instruction of a certain hierarchical bent, for while allthe blessed are equally blessed (as all the damned are equally damned), there isnonetheless here, as there was in Hell, an order of rank among those present.All the blessed are equally blessed, only some are less blessed than others—or,perhaps better put, some have fewer apparent credentials for salvation thanothers (e.g., Piccarda the traduced nun, as compared with St. Benedict; or Folcothe former lover and poet, with St. John).We also learn that each of these heavens, which are “ruled” by one of the nineorders of angels (about which see notes found in Canto XXVIII), is associatedwith a particular virtue: faith, hope, and love, respectively, in the firstthree spheres (Moon, Mercury, Venus), but each of these theological virtues inan imperfect form (see Ordiway [Ordi.1982.1]). The next four planetary spheres(Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) present in turn the four cardinal virtues:prudence, fortitude, justice, and temperance. In the Starry Sphere we encounterthe three theological virtues in their perfected form; in the Primum Mobile thenine ranks of angels, reflecting each of the nine virtues over which each oftheir orders presides.As even this brief description indicates, Dante’s celestial bodies are lessimportant for their physical traits (which are, nonetheless, duly noted) as fortheir influence on the character of a given human soul. Dante’s astronomy isthus, to us today, a curious blend of consideration of the physicalcharacteristics of the heavens and of their influence on human life (see Kay[Kay.1983.1 and Kay.1994.2]). It is at once both astronomy and astrology, but anastrology “cleaned up,” drained of its deterministic elements, an astrology thatwould pass muster with St. Augustine, who cried out so eloquently against it(e.g., Confessions VII.vi). The notion that our actions are determined by thestars is simply anathema to Christian theologians, for whom the resultant pleas(e.g., “I was born under Venus; how could I resist the call of sexualpleasure?”) were the early version of the dog-ate-my-homework defense. ThusDante’s age combined Ptolemaic astronomy and what we would rightly callastrology in such ways as to maintain the doctrine of Free Will. The stars, wewill learn from Charles Martel in Paradiso VIII.97–148, predispose us towardcertain abilities (thus explaining why we become either warriors or poets, forexample) but in no way control our moral choices. And it is these that prepareus for our eternal lives, whether in Heaven or in Hell.(3) The Drama of Paradiso.This drama is not nearly so much moral, as was that described in the first twocantiche, as it is intellectual. Inferno and Purgatorio are both centrally moralin the reactions that they summon in the reader. This pertains at least throughPurgatorio XXVII; once we arrive in the earthly paradise, we can feel the groundmoving beneath our feet, compelling us to take a more historical and religiousdirection. Turning the corner into the heavens, we are soon aware of a moretheological (indeed Scholastic) dimension to the poem, one that is, if notaltogether a surprise, dramatically different. Here is another way in which thethird cantica differs from the first two. The motivation of much of thediscourse in the canticle comes from Dante’s puzzled questions, the result ofhis shaky understanding of God’s justice. Beatrice, given the role that onewaggish commentator has characterized as resulting from her having been forcedto act the part of St. Thomas in drag, takes over the role of guide from Virgil.And while she fields most of Dante’s questions, there are others who do so aswell. It is quite a cast of teachers that he is privileged to have, includingfour eventual saints of the Church: Thomas, Bonaventure, Benedict, and Bernard.And who is the protagonist of this bildungsroman? Pertile (Pert.1998.2), p. 19,describes him as follows: “A Florentine excluded from his city, aristocratdeprived of means, fervent Christian and unswerving anticlerical, politicianconstrained to stand on the sidelines, partisan without a party, layman swept upin his own religious mission, intellectual déclassé, Dante is a microcosm of allthe tensions and contradictions of his time.” And now, when he has reached thefinal portion of his journey, the traces of his worldly identities and caresare, if anything, even more pressing, even more visible.While the first actual presence of Beatrice in the poem, in the earthlyparadise, puts her in the role of moral preceptor rather than that of guide torevealed truth, once we enter Paradiso, that becomes precisely her role. It isno wonder that Romantic readers insist that they find her less attractive thanFrancesca. (And, in the wake of De Sanctis and Croce, there follow many otherswho try to turn the poem into something it simply refuses to be.) Dante’sheavenly preceptor sounds like a Doctor of the Church, exactly as Dante wantedher to. Her role, some have argued, is to supervise the correction of Dante’sintellect. In such a formulation, Virgil supervises the correction of Dante’swill in Inferno and the perfection of his will in Purgatorio, while Beatrice hasa similar role in the correction of Dante’s intellect in the first nine heavenlyspheres, and Bernard presides over the perfection of Dante’s intellect in theEmpyrean (see Hollander [Holl.1976.2]). That role makes the gamut of Scholasticdistinctions that she forces Dante (and us) to run through seem only areasonable course. It is probably true that no one has ever poeticized theologyat such length and with better art than Dante has done in Paradiso.There are many large theological and philosophical subjects addressed byBeatrice. (In Convivio, Dante might have referred to the passages containingthem as digressioni [digressions]—and in Paradiso XXIX.127, he again uses thatword.) This is not to consider those offered by Justinian, Charles Martel,Thomas Aquinas, Cacciaguida, or still others. Beatrice’s topics include thefollowing: the paradoxical nature of heavenly “gravity,” drawing one up and notdown (Par. I); the spiritual reason for the spots on the Moon (II—anotherrefutation of arguments found in Convivio [II.xiii.9]); the information thatsaved souls do not return to their star but proceed directly (once they havefinished their purgation, if they have had to pass through that realm; at leastsome saints and most or all martyrs apparently did not) to the Empyrean (IV);the relation between the absolute and the conditional will (IV); the repaymentof broken vows and the freedom of the will (V); the primo mobile and the rootsof time (XXVII); the ranks of the angels (XXVIII); the nature of and reason forGod’s creation of the universe (XXIX); the fallen angels (XXIX); those membersof religious orders who teach false doctrines (XXIX); the numberless ranks ofthe angels (XXIX).Given this array of subjects, we may be excused if we wonder what Dante expectedin the reader of Paradiso by way of education. We are puzzled by the alwaysinteresting and surely difficult question of the writer’s intended audience. Tohave garnered the respect and popularity he apparently did within a short periodof time, his audience would have had to understand many at least reconditeallusions and be able to follow some fairly sophisticated theologicaldisquisition. How broad an audience could Dante have had that fully appreciatedhis achievement? (We should not forget that there also sprang up an enthusiasticilliterate audience for the work, memorizing the text from the recitals ofothers, a tradition that has continued into our own times (see Ahern[Aher.1982.3]). Obviously, it had to be literate, which we may safely assumemeans that he had a small audience to begin with (but for the growth of thatpotential audience from the tenth century on and the development of an“intellectual elite,” see the classic study of Le Goff, Les intellectuels auMoyen Âge [English ed., Lego.1957.1]; and for laymen’s interests in andknowledge of formal philosophy, see Imbach [Imba.1996.1], pp. 1–128). Thataudience is expected to be conversant with all the disciplines on which Danterelies to convey his thoughts, not only theology, not only the so-called liberalarts (divided into two parts, the trivium and quadrivium [see below]), but withdeveloping issues in what we would refer to as philosophy and natural science.This was not the nineteenth century, when there were numerous readers of aprofessional preparation (doctors, lawyers, and others whose schooling includedliterature at a fairly advanced level in liceo) who entered into debate in theGiornale dantesco or other literary periodicals over some of the poem’s finerpoints in a kind of “official amateur” role. There were, in the fourteenthcentury, perhaps no more than a happy few with such preparation. The educatedreaders to whom Dante addresses his poem had perhaps surprisingly similareducational backgrounds, having been subjected to the seven liberal arts:grammar, rhetoric, dialectic (roughly what is covered less cogently bypreparation for what is measured by the “verbal” portion of the StandardAchievement Tests, familiar to American high school students); arithmetic,music, geometry, and astronomy (disciplines that were all associated withmathematics, and thus something like the preparation for the SATs in math). Themost educated were mainly priests; they had also studied theology, the “highestscience,” the only field for the “PhD” in most medieval universities, on themodel of Paris, where Thomas Aquinas taught. And so, while we may feelchallenged by any or all of the “fields” that are represented in the poem, theeducated elite probably could manage to understand a lot more of it than we, asis evidenced by the early commentaries, which produce a good deal of loreregarding what we would call astronomy, biology, geology, and physics.(4) Language and Style in Paradiso.Most of the diction of Paradiso is solemn, but some is surprisingly lighthearted(Canto V.139: “il seguente canto canta” [the next song sings]), exalted, butalso giddily playful (Canto V.122–123: “Dì, dì … a dii” [Speak, speak … ingods]); and, at times, colloquial and salty (Canto XVII.129: “e lascia purgrattar dov’ è la rogna” [and let the one who itches scratch]). If the low comicspeech we heard so much of in Inferno and a good smattering of in Purgatorio isless often present in Paradiso, the fact that it is there at all tells ussomething about Dante’s determination to keep that low comic thread present inthe fabric of the last canticle. It is probably correct to say that Purgatoriois the more “churchly” of the last two cantiche, while Paradiso is the more“Scholastic.” Nonetheless, the very presence of a few low-vernacular momentsdetermines our sense of the linguistic range that defines the enterprise. JeanRacine, who was grandly alert to such problems, once wrote that one cannot havea character say the word mouchoir (handkerchief) in a tragedy (because itviolates the stylistic register of the genre). In even the most exalted parts ofParadiso, Dante keeps the low-mimetic present, as for instance in the last canto(Par. XXXIII.7) when he refers to Mary’s womb, not in a Petrarchan and noble andpolitely metaphorical way (as one commentator thought he should have, by sayingvirginal chiostro [virginal cloister]), but by the unvarnished plainness ofventre (“womb” or “belly”).All the speakers overheard by us, eavesdropping at Dante’s shoulder, are saved.This fact understandably colors the intonations that we hear. The more academicand abstract subjects normally addressed by Beatrice and by those Dante meets inthe heavens would seem to call for different stylistic registers, and indeed wedo hear a lot of Scholastic discourse, most notably from St. Thomas and fromDante’s three apostolic examiners, Peter, James, and John, on the theologicalvirtues. Nonetheless, we catch the inflection not only of that speechappropriate to such discourse, but also of Franciscan narrative (see Canto XI),with plenty of room left for a Christian version of Old Testament prophetic ragein the various denunciations of earthly behavior we hear in the first nineheavens. As Fredi Chiappelli (Chia.1967.3) suggested, in moving to Paradiso weencounter, at first (and as we might expect), a much greater degree ofabstraction, both linguistic and conceptual, than we have become accustomed toin the earlier parts of the poem. However, and as Chiappelli points out,starting in Canto XXII the poet begins to move back to the concrete. Thisparadox is surely allied to the Incarnational basis of the Christian faith aswell as of the poetics of the Commedia.On the overall newness of the treatment of the subjects in the final canticle,see E. H. Wilkins (Wilk.1961.1), p. 3: “Certain differences between the Infernoand the Purgatorio on the one hand and the Paradiso on the other may be notedbriefly. In each of the first two cantiche the number of lines that are spokenis a little less than half the total number of lines in the cantica: in theParadiso considerably more than half of all the lines are spoken. In each of thefirst two cantiche the number of spoken passages is about three hundred andfifty; in the Paradiso it is about one hundred and fifty. In each of the firsttwo cantiche the spoken passages average about six lines in length: in theParadiso they average about twenty lines in length. In each of the first twocantiche the number of individual speakers is somewhat more than fifty: in theParadiso it is less than twenty.” Wilkins’s census confirms what readersprobably generally feel without extensive reflection: the third cantica isessentially different from the first two because of the sharp reduction in theamount of narrative it deploys. If, indeed, we examine the speeches of thetwenty or so speakers in Paradiso, we quickly realize not only that Paradiso ischaracterized by having fewer speakers with more to say, but that very few ofthese speeches are devoted to narrative. In Inferno and Purgatorio, for Virgilto hold forth on the nature of sin (Inf. XI) or for Marco Lombardo to explainthe nature of love (Purg. XVI) seemed unusual. We had become enthusiasticallyaccustomed to the experience of sinners and penitents revealing their historiesthrough riveting narratives. Even Beatrice’s reproofs to Dante in PurgatorioXXX–XXXI generally took a narrative form, a retelling of the dark side of theprotagonist’s emergent new life. In the third cantica, on the other hand,embedded narratives are few and far between. To be sure, the poet will continueto tell how the protagonist moves from place to place in brief descriptions.What is comparatively absent, however, is narrative, narrative deployed in thoseself-revealing tales told by the souls whom the protagonist encounters in thefirst two canticles. (These are so prominent a feature of Dante’s writing in theCommedia that they may seem to be its single most defining characteristic;witness their effect on Robert Browning.) Ugolino’s self-narrative, forinstance, runs 72 verses (Inf. XXXIII.4–75). The eleven speakers in Paradiso whotell their own stories, ranging from Piccarda in Canto III (through Justinian,Charles Martel, Cunizza, Folco, Thomas, Bonaventure, Cacciaguida [perhaps, asDante’s ancestor, unsurprisingly the longest-winded, at 19 verses], PeterDamian, Benedict) to Adam in Canto XXVI, tell all eleven of these in some 150verses scattered over twenty-four cantos (there are none in the first twocantos, exactly as we might expect, nor in the last seven, a fact that maysurprise us, until we reflect that the extinction of self-consciousness is onehallmark of the shared behavior of all the saints in Heaven). In short, thetotal number of verses devoted to self-narrative in the third cantica is barelymore than double that allotted to a single speaker, albeit the most loquaciousone, in Inferno.The language of Paradiso is exceptional, in every sense of that word. There arewords here that literally were never before used in a poem (or sometimesanywhere else, as far as we know), some simply transferred from one linguisticfield to a new one, others made up by our poet. For Dante’s versification, hiswide-ranging lexicon (e.g., Latinisms, dialectical speech, Gallicisms,neologisms), his rhymes, and his stylistic traits, see the admirably clear andcomplete summary produced by John A. Scott (pp. 261–80) in his helpfulintroduction to the study of Dante (Scot.2004.2).(5) Politics in Paradiso.In attempting to come to grips with Purgatorio, some readers experiencedifficulty because they take Dante’s views as being more “human” than they infact are (e.g., the episode involving Matelda in Canto XXVIII may seem to someto valorize sensual love, while in fact it shows the need to transcend it).Others, dealing with Paradiso, make the mistake of considering the interestsfound in this cantica to be only “divine” (one oft-repeated view is that afterwe leave Purgatorio behind, the poem reveals no further interest in thepolitical affairs of the world below—which is simply untrue). There is smallneed to insist on the political nature of so much of Dante’s interest in thefirst two canticles. (For a fairly recent bibliography, see Di Scipio[Disc.1983.1], p. 282, n. 1.) Paradiso, however, is frequently portrayed eitheras having left such worldly concerns behind or as, if they are seen as present,downplaying their importance. Such a view is countered by even casual attentionto the text. The reader may want to consider Canto VI, in which Justiniannarrates the history of the eagle of imperial Rome; Cantos XV–XVII, in thecourse of which Cacciaguida describes, in detail, the political life of Florencein the “good old days” and the city’s decline, as well as the future, politicaland personal, of its most famous exile, Dante Alighieri (see Davis[Davi.1968.1]); Canto XXVII (vv. 136–148), in which the poet offers the finalpolitical prophecy in the poem; and Canto XXX (vv. 133–148), where Beatriceshows Dante the vacant throne of the emperor Henry VII and savages the sittingpope (much to the dismay of some commentators, who think the poem should be morepacific at a point so near its vision of God). This is not to exhaust thepassages showing a pronounced political concern in the final cantica, but doesgive a rapid sense of the importance of politics in it. Dante’s political viewsare less surprisingly found in Paradiso than one at first may think. From theirvery first presence in the poem (e.g., the prophecy of the veltro in Inf. I,Ciacco’s discussion of better times in Florence’s earlier history in Inf. VI),they are not mere political views, but reveal themselves as having a religious,even a providential, component.Endword.“This commentary, as demanding of our labor as it was of our publisher’ssupport, represents, published in these times, an act of faith in our schoolsand even more in the values found in our culture and in our history that some,shamefully and foolishly, attempt to make matters of debate. In order topreserve our humanity, we believe that it is indispensable to continue topractice philology, criticism, and literary history, that is, to make everyeffort to understand as precisely as possible the messages passed along to us byour common culture, which we in turn bear the responsibility of passing along tothose to come. To be witnesses to and actors in a civilizational moment thatreaches toward the future does not in any way deny the value of the past, thevery source of our nourishment.” These words (here translated from the Italian),dated Easter 1978, were written by Umberto Bosco, coauthor (along with GiovanniReggio) of, in the opinion of the author of these notes, one of the finestcommentaries to Paradiso available. Bosco’s remarks, found on p. x of hisPremessa, reflect the distress felt by many in Italy during one of the mostdifficult times of the postwar era, when Italian universities were besieged(often literally) by enemies, both external and internal, as the undersigned, amember of a commission of foreign scholars preparing a report on that situation,had opportunity to observe less than a year after Bosco wrote these words. Aquarter of a century later, one hardly senses that the forces of civilizationare winning the “culture wars” that seem almost embedded in university life andin the culture that lies outside the gates. On the other hand, one may take somecomfort in the fact that Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and other geniuses in thehuman arts, in whatever form they are appreciated, are still vital presences ifonly they are read or seen or heard. Whenever they cease their posthumousvitality, their extinction, like that of the dead canary in its cage within theconfines of the coal mine, will tell those still breathing among us that it istime to get back to the surface or else, perhaps, to abandon hope.Robert Hollander Tortola, 21 January 2005"},{"pageContent":"[../images/00008.jpeg]Click here [part0048.html#b_m01] for a larger version of this image[../images/00009.jpeg]Click here [part0048.html#b_m02] for a larger version of this image"},{"pageContent":"THE PARADISO: ENGLISHOUTLINE: PARADISO I1–12 [part0009.html#c01-s01-e] proem: looking back at the completed journey and the promise to narrate the restof its course13–36 [part0009.html#c01-s05-e] invocation (fifth in the poem): the aid of “Apollo”13–21 [part0009.html#c01-s05-e] invocation proper22–36 [part0009.html#c01-s08-e] result of such inspiration; justification for it37–60 [part0009.html#c01-s13-e] the narrative begins: Dante still in earthly paradise37–42 [part0009.html#c01-s13-e] the constellation Aries43–48 [part0009.html#c01-s15-e] noon: Dante looking as Beatrice looks into the sun49–54 [part0009.html#c01-s17-e] simile: the sun in her eyes and reflecting rays55–60 [part0009.html#c01-s19-e] Dante can look directly at the sun61–81 [part0009.html#c01-s21-e] the ascent toward the Moon61–63 [part0009.html#c01-s21-e] rising, Dante seems to see a second sun above him64–66 [part0009.html#c01-s22-e] he looks back to see the stars reflected in her eyes67–72 [part0009.html#c01-s23-e] simile: Glaucus and Dante’s own “transhumanation”73–75 [part0009.html#c01-s25-e] the poet cannot say whether he ascended in body76–81 [part0009.html#c01-s26-e] reaching the sublunary ring of fire: son et lumière82–141 [part0009.html#c01-s28-e] Dante’s questions and Beatrice’s responses82–93 [part0009.html#c01-s28-e] the first question: where is he? and the response94–99 [part0009.html#c01-s32-e] the second: how can he pass through air and fire?100–126 [part0009.html#c01-s34-e] response: the upward inclination of all things127–135 [part0009.html#c01-s43-e] response: how things diverge from their true goal136–141 [part0009.html#c01-s46-e] response: but not Dante, now freed from sin142 [part0009.html#c01-s47-e] coda: Beatrice looks back up.PARADISO I [part0020.html#c01-i] The glory of Him who moves all things →[part0032.html#c01-n01] → [part0032.html#c01-n02] pervades the universe and shines → [part0032.html#c01-n03]3 [part0020.html#c01-s01-i]3 [part0020.html#c01-s01-i] in one part more and in another less.

[part0009.html#c01-s01-e] Dante clearly offers these verses as anintroduction to the third and final cantica as a whole. So much is dealt with inthem, and in precisely such a way as to set Paradiso off from the rest of thepoem, that it is perhaps worth considering them as a unit before attempting tocome to grips with particular lines. One burden of these remarks (and of thespecific glosses that follow them) is that Dante is once again (see, e.g., Purg.XXIV.52–54) playing a dangerous game as he addresses his role as poet. Hepresents himself, if in hidden ways (in modern political parlance, he “preservesdeniability”), as being inspired by God to write this part of the poem (a barelyhidden claim in the first two canticles as well). At the same time he allows usto believe, if we are uncomfortable with that claim here, that he is only doingwhat all poets do, invoking deities for poetic inspiration as has beenconventional since Homer’s time. And so here we shall find him referring toApollo (I.13), Mt. Parnassus (I.16), the satyr Marsyas (I.20), and Daphne (inthe form of the laurel tree—I.25). Yet all those classicizing gestures do notquite obfuscate the clear postclassical network of the necessary Christianappurtenances of a poem that begins by remembering its culmination andconclusion, the vision of God in the Empyrean.We are fortunate in the fact that the first dozen of these opening verses arethe subject of a commentary written by no less an expert than Dante himself, inhis Epistle to Cangrande, which now, after the evidence that it was known andextensively cited by Andrea Lancia circa 1345, as Luca Azzetta (Azze.2003.1) hasdemonstrated, cannot easily be denied its Dantean paternity (and especially notby those for whom a major piece of negative evidence against the authenticity ofthe document was the complete absence of direct reference to Dante’s authorshipin the fourteenth century). Dante himself marks off these thirty-six verses asintroductory, referring to the rest of the cantica (Par. I.37–XXXIII.145) as itspars executiva (executive portion), i.e., the narrative (of which he saysnothing, if he seems to promise to do so). In fact, his detailed treatment (thepars executiva, as it were, of his epistle) is reserved, interestingly enough,only for the first dozen of these three dozen lines, which receive some fourpages of analysis (we might reflect that, had the commentator continued at thisrate, he would have produced a document of some sixteen hundred pages forParadiso alone). Then the commentator begins to treat his subject at breakneckspeed: The last terzina of the group (vv. 10–12) receives only a single briefsentence of attention, while the following fifteen verses (13–27) are glossedeven more hurriedly.Except for Scartazzini, a happy and fairly early exception, few exegetes havemade wide use of the Epistle in their responses to the opening of the Paradiso(if Charles Singleton, in his “Special Note” to the canto, and UmbertoBosco/Giovanni Reggio [comm. to vv. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7–9, 12, 13] offer notableexceptions; see also Baldelli [Bald.1993.2]). To do so properly would overburdenthese pages; therefore, the interested reader is directed to a fuller treatmentof this document in the commentary to the opening five tercets of the canto inthe Princeton Dante Project (www.princeton.edu/dante[http://www.princeton.edu/dante]).Dante’s practice as composer of prologues to each of his three cantiche isdiverse, as may be readily observed in the following table:[../images/00010.jpeg]Paradiso, it seems clear, required more painstaking justification than anythingbefore it, and this, the fifth of the nine invocations in the poem (see the noteto Inf. II.7–9) is by far the most elaborate, requiring eight tercets for itsdevelopment. We shall return to the invocatory portion of the introduction toParadiso shortly; here we may simply observe that the self-reflective poeticgestures made in those eight tercets occupy fully two-thirds of thisintroductory poetic space.

[part0009.html#c01-s01-e] The phrasing “di colui che tutto move” (of Himwho moves all things) is unmistakably derived from Aristotle’s “unmoved mover”(see Metaphysics XII.7), familiar in Scholastic writings, as Scartazzini (1900,comm. to this verse) insists. “La gloria,” on the other hand, initiates andcontrols the Scholastic definition in order to Christianize its terminology.(“Glory” is notably and understandably absent from Aristotle’s or Thomas’sdiscussion of the first mover.) The word has various possible meanings in theCommedia (see the article “gloria” by Sebastiano Aglianò [ED III (1975)], pp.240–42): for example, it may represent earthly renown, a shining quality, thestate of blessedness. Here it may retain some of its more earthly resonance, butin only the highest sense: God’s shining forth from his beatitude, the most“famous” of all things that exist.

[part0009.html#c01-s01-e] The Letter to Cangrande devotes well over apage to these verses, arguing that we are to find the glory of God’s Beingreflected in all that exists in His secondary creation; likewise, His essence,or His intellect, lies at the heart of all the substances found in the createduniverse. Thus it is not surprising that we find a gradation among even thethings that God has made, some being more or less corruptible than others. Danteoffers no examples in this difficult passage, but it is clear that he isthinking of the angels at the highest end of creation, and the less exaltedforms of matter (e.g., rocks, mud) at the lowest. The words penetra (pervades,penetrates) and risplende (shines [with reflected light]) distinguish betweenGod’s unmediated glory and its reflection, its quality various as what it isreflected by.

[part0009.html#c01-s02-e] The reference to St. Paul’s ascent to theheavens is unmistakable (II Corinthians 12:3–4) and has long been acknowledged(at least since the time [ca. 1385] of Francesco da Buti [comm. to vv. 1–12]).For a particularly incisive treatment, see Landino on this tercet.

[part0009.html#c01-s02-e] Some commentators, perhaps beginning withPietrobono (comm. to this verse), put forward the notion that the reference isto all ten heavens, that is, to the totality of this superterrestrial world. Afew have also argued that the reference is to the outermost of the physicalheavenly spheres, either the Crystalline or the Primum Mobile. However, it seemsutterly clear that Dante is referring to the Empyrean, God’s “home” (insofar asHe who is everywhere can be thought of as located in a particular anywhere aswell). Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) was perhaps the first to refer to theEpistle to Cangrande as eventual justification of this reading: “And it iscalled the Empyrean, which is as much as to say, the heaven glowing with fire orheat; not that there is material fire or heat therein, but spiritual, which isholy love, or charity” (XIII.68—tr.

[part0009.html#c01-s03-e] On this verse, “che dietro la memoria non puòire” (that memory cannot follow after it), see Bruno Nardi (Nard.1960.3), whoexamines the understanding of the nature of memory as it is reflected in thetraditions that develop from Aristotle and Augustine and come down into AlbertusMagnus and Thomas Aquinas in order to establish that “when our intellect comesnear to the beatific vision of God …, it so immerses itself in it … that thememory and the image-receiving capacity of the mind are unable to contain it anylonger” (p. 273). As Poletto and Tozer point out (comms. to vv. 7–9), Dante hasexplained this verse in the Epistle to Cangrande (XIII.77): “Et reddit causamdicens ‘quod intellectus in tantum profundat se’ in ipsum ‘desiderium suum’,quod est Deus, ‘quod memoria sequi non potest’ ” (And he gives the reason,saying that “the intellect plunges itself to such depth” in its very longing,which is for God, “that the memory cannot follow” [tr. P. Toynbee]). There is(mainly unexpressed) disagreement among the commentators as to whether thememory is with the intellect in its first experience of the Godhead and onlyloses that perception afterward, or, as Dante seems to be saying, is left behindat the outset in the intellect’s excitement. Whatever hypothesis one accepts,the result is the same, as the last verses of the poem will also announce: Thevision of God cannot be contained in human memory; rather, we can only claim amemory of having had a memory, now lost.

[part0009.html#c01-s04-e] As though in preparation for the invocationthat is to come in the following tercet, Dante resorts to a series of phrases orwords laden with literary overtone, whether intrinsically or by the contextoffered from their other appearances in the Commedia: veramente (discussed inthe following note), regno santo, mente, tesoro, materia, il mio canto. Forinstance, the “holy kingdom” (regno santo) that is Paradise may remind us ofmedieval poets’ assigning themselves geographic/political areas as subjects oftheir work (e.g., the “matter of Troy,” the “matter of France,” etc.); all therest of these terms are also used by Dante in passages that refer to the writingof his poem. For materia, see Paradiso X.27, where Dante refers to the text ofParadiso as “that matter of which I have become the scribe.” [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s04-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c01-s04-i]]10. [part0009.html#c01-s04-e] While it is clear that, as commentators havepointed out, Dante’s conjunction (veramente, here “nevertheless”) mirrors theformality of the Latin conjunction verumtamen, it also necessarily exhibits theonly partly hidden claim that this poem is a record of things that have truly(veramente) been observed. In 1791, Lombardi (comm. to this verse) was perhapsthe first commentator to insist on the force of the Latin root, specificallydenying the meaning of con verità, certamente, found in the earliercommentaries. It is, however, difficult to accept the notion that the obviousItalian meaning is utterly effaced in the Latinism. In accord with that view,Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 1–12) glosses veramente as “not in empty dreams.”Poetry, as commentators should realize perhaps more often than we do, has thepropensity to open into a plurality of meanings that cannot be fully rendered inprose. (Dante, however, in Vita nuova XXV.10 clearly himself sponsors the notionthat the meaning of poems are known to those who make them: “For, if any oneshould dress his poem in images and rhetorical coloring and then, being asked tostrip his poem of such dress in order to reveal its true meaning, would not beable to do so—this would be a veritable cause for shame. And my best friend[Guido Cavalcanti] and I are well acquainted with some who compose so clumsily”[tr. M. Musa].)Since most of the seven of the preceding uses of the adverb fairly obviouslyoffer only the more usual Italian sense of the word (i.e., “truly,” “really”—aswill most of the seven that follow), its undertone here is not easily muffled.[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s04-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s04-i]]11. [part0009.html#c01-s04-e] The word tesoro is focal in a number of contextsas we move through the poem. For these, see the note to Paradiso XVII.121–122.Here Dante claims to have laid up in his memory the “treasure of Heaven” (seeMatthew 19:21).

As for the noun canto, when it signifies “song”(and not “side” or “edge,” a meaning it has fully seven times, interspersedthrough all three cantiche), it is used twenty-four times in the poem, andincludes reference to a gamut of “songs”: (1) classical epic (Inf. IV.95); (2) aspecific canto or passage in the Commedia (Inf. XX.2; XXXIII.90; Purg. I.10;Par. V.16; V.139); (3) Dante’s former song, the second ode of the Convivio(Purg. II.107; II.131); (4) the Ulysses-seducing song of the Siren in Dante’ssecond Purgatorial dream (Purg. XIX.23); (5) songs of biblical derivation sungas part of the rite of purgation, that is, the Miserere sung by the penitents inante-purgatory (Purg. V.27) and the Gloria in excelsis sung by the penitentavaricious at Statius’s liberation from his penitence (Purg. XX.140); (6)Charity’s directive song to which Faith and Hope measure the steps of theirdance (Purg. XXIX.128); and finally (7) twelve songs in the Paradiso directed toor emanating from Heaven, first the holy songs of the Seraphim (Par. IX.77) and,last, the Gloria sung by the Church Triumphant (if not by Jesus and Mary,already returned to the Empyrean—Par. XXVII.3).

[part0009.html#c01-s05-e] The author of the Epistle to Cangrandehimself divides the introduction to Paradiso into two parts, vv. 1–12 and 13–36(see Epist. XIII.48). While the invocation proper occupies only three verses,this entire passage supports and extends it. (For an intense consideration ofDante’s use of invocation, see Ledda [Ledd.2002.1], pp. 55–63.) [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c01-s05-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c01-s05-i]]13–15. [part0009.html#c01-s05-e] The invocation of God, even if as the “goodApollo,” is, once one considers the poetic moment, almost a necessity. (Paulinusof Nola apostrophizes Christ as follows: “Salve o Apollo vere” [Save us, O trueApollo—Carmina II.51], as noted by Kantorowicz [Kant.1951.1], p. 228, among aplethora of similar expressions found in Greek [and some Latin] syncretisticpassages.) Who else but God Himself can serve as the ultimate “muse” for a poemabout the ultimate mysteries of the Christian faith? If the first two of thesethree verses indirectly but clearly associate Apollo with God (the word valorein verse 14 is used at least thrice again undoubtedly to refer to the Power ofGod the Father [Par. I.107, X.3, and XXXIII.81]), while the second indirectlybut clearly associates Dante with St. Paul (see Inf. II.28, “lo Vas d’elezïone”[the Chosen Vessel]), since Dante, likewise, will be made God’s chosen vessel(vaso). And what of the gift that this poet seeks? The “belovèd laurel,” in thisexalted context, becomes more than poetic fame, but the true immortality ofthose who are blessed for eternity, another and better kind of immortality: the“laurel” granted by God to his immortal (i.e., saved) poet, rewarded, amongother things, for having written, under His inspiration, of Him. In the Epistleto Cangrande, Dante offers the following explanation of the reason poets call onhigher authority: “For they have need of invocation in a large measure, inasmuchas they have to petition the superior beings for something beyond the ordinaryrange of human powers, something almost in the nature of a divine gift” (tr. P.Toynbee—the last phrase reads quasi divinum quoddam munus, representing an onlyslightly veiled reference to the theologized nature of his “Apollo”). ForDante’s single use of the Latinism muno, based on munus, see Paradiso XIV.33. Weshould not forget, if we insist on the pagan valence of Apollo, that Dante hasalready twice “transvaluated” a pagan god into the Christian deity: See InfernoXXXI.92 and Purgatorio VI.118 for the expression sommo Giove (highest Jove).This is surely the same phenomenon that we witness here.Do these “transvaluations” of the more usual understandings of poeticinspiration and success entirely erase the traces of their original referenceamong poets and their audiences? We are, after all, reading a poem. And weshould have no doubt but that its human agent was as interested in earthlysuccess as any other poet (and perhaps more than most). However, the contextmakes a pagan understanding of these grand poetic gestures at the same time bothimpossible and desirable. We are almost forced to recognize the divine claimsmade by this very human agent, but we are allowed to understand them incompletely human terms as well. We find ourselves in a usual dilemma: If we takethe truth claims made by the poet on behalf of his poem seriously, we feelgreatly troubled (mortal agents are not allowed such claims unless they aredemonstrably chosen, as, to Christian believers, was Paul); on the other hand,if we insist that these claims are in fact not true, we sense that we havefailed to deal with something that, if it makes us uncomfortable, nonethelessmust be dealt with; other poets do not make such stringent demands upon ourbelief. In another way of phrasing this, we can only say No after we have saidYes, that is, by understanding Dante’s veiled claims, no matter what weeventually decide to think of them. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s05-e]/ Italian [part0020.html#c01-s05-i]]13. [part0009.html#c01-s05-e] It seems clear that, whatever the eventualidentity we are meant to assign to Ovid’s amorous god, there is one that thispersonage cannot possibly have in its higher context, that of Apollo, pagan godof the Sun, music, and so on. Ovid’s Apollo (Metam. I.452–567), pursuing Daphnewith immediate disastrous consequence for the girl, is, we are probably meant tounderstand, the “bad” Apollo. The later poet’s “sun God” is in antitheticrelationship to him when Dante reconstructs the Ovidian tale into a sort ofChristian riddle. Since the pagan Apollo was understood as the poet seekingimmortality (Daphne is metamorphosed, of course, into the laurel tree), we areleft to consider what the laurel becomes in this rarefied circumstance. The bestunderstanding of it is perhaps that Dante is invoking the aid of the true God inhis triune majesty (see the note to Par. II.7–9) to make his inspired poem sothat he himself may achieve immortal glory, eternal life in the Empyrean. Thisunderstanding of the laurel should be set against that found earlier in the poem(see Purg. XI.91–93 and note), for unlike the green crown of mortalachievements, which adorns its winner’s brow only until someone is eventuallyadjudged better by the crowd, this one is the reward of true immortality for thewriting of the poem “to which both heaven and earth have set their hand” (Par.XXV.2). The passage sounds exactly like the usual petition for aid in making apoem, but has this subtle and absolutely crucial difference. Apollo is afamiliar Christian analogue for Christ (for later manifestations of thismedieval tradition in Calderón, see Curtius [Curt.1948.1], pp. 245, 568), andhere it is perhaps the Second Person of the Trinity that first shines through tothe reader as the dominant Person present in these lines (see Giacalone’scomment on vv. 20–21: “Here Apollo is a figure of Christ”). As we shall see, theother two Persons are both referred to, clearly if obliquely. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s05-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c01-s05-i]]16–18. [part0009.html#c01-s06-e] This tercet explains its predecessor (i.e.,why the poet feels he must turn to “the Delphic god” [verse 32] now), althoughit is fair to say that elements in it have remained a puzzle through thecenturies. If previously he has seemingly not needed to appeal directly to ahigher authority for inspiration, relying only on the Muses, Dante now turns tothe god himself. Whatever the meanings and references of the details put beforeus here, almost every commentator agrees that this is their basic significance.Dante, however, is apparently confused about the configuration of the actual Mt.Parnassus in Greece. See Tozer’s explanation (1901) of this material (whichDante borrows, without perhaps recognizing the problem he inherits in doing so,from his Latin precursors): “That mountain rises to a single conspicuous summit;and when the Greek poets speak of its two summits (Soph., Ant. 1126; Eurip.,Bacch. 307; cf. Ion. 86–8) they mean, not the real summit of the mountain, butthe two peaks that rise above Delphi, which are several thousand feet lower.These expressions were misunderstood by the Roman poets, who regularly describeParnassus as rising to two summits; for example, Ov., Met. I.316–317, ‘Mons ibiverticibus petit arduus astra duobus, Nomine Parnassus’ (There Mount Parnassuslifts its two peaks skyward, high and steep—tr. F. J. Miller); Lucan, Phars.V.72, ‘Parnassus gemino petit aethera | colle’ (the twin peaks of Parnassus soarto heaven—tr. J. D. Duff). Dante followed them, and naturally fell into the samemistake.”Nonetheless, if Dante knew what many of his commentators, from the earliestthrough those of the last century, report at verse 16 (e.g., the Ottimo, Pietrodi Dante, the author of the Chiose ambrosiane, Benvenuto, the AnonimoFiorentino, John of Serravalle, Lombardi, Portirelli, Tommaseo, Scartazzini,Campi), namely, that Cyrrha was sacred to Apollo, Nissa to Bacchus, how could hehave made the second “peak” of Parnassus sacred to the Muses? At PurgatorioXXIX.37–42, Dante’s second invocation of that cantica makes reference to theHeliconian residence of the Muses. However, two other passages in Purgatorio(XXII.65 and XXXI.141) make oblique reference to the Castalian spring on Mt.Parnassus as also being home to these ladies. It does seem possible that Dantehas deliberately conflated two homes of the Muses, the spring on Parnassus withthat on Helicon (which Dante may not have known as a mountain but as itself aspring).

[part0009.html#c01-s06-e] For the phrase “m’è uopo,” here translated “Ineed,” see Landino (comm. to vv. 16–18): “chome in latino diciamo ‘mihi estopus’ ” (as in Latin we say, “I have this to do”).The word aringo (here translated loosely and, in reverse metonymy, as“struggle”) actually descends from a Gothic word referring to the space in whichtroops were gathered (and subsequently a contest took place)—see Giacalone(comm. to vv. 16–18). The English “ring” (definition 13 in the OED) offers, ifnot perhaps a true cognate, a useful analogue, as in the phrase “I would not getinto the ring with him, if I were you.” [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s06-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c01-s06-i]]19. [part0009.html#c01-s07-e] In this second piece of his invocation proper(in the first, at verse 14, he had asked to be made God’s vessel), the poet asksto be, literally, inspired (“Enter my breast and breathe in me”). If the firstpetition seems to have been aimed in particular at the Second Person of theTrinity, Christ as Apollo, this one seems to be directed to the Holy Spirit, ashas been the case in the Comedy when Dante has represented inspiration,reflecting the “spiration of the Holy Spirit” (e.g., see the notes to Inf.XXXIII.106–108; Purg. XXIV.52–54). And now see Picone (Pico.2005.1), pp. 10–11.[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s07-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s07-i]]20–21. [part0009.html#c01-s07-e] If the reader has accepted the possibility(even the likelihood) that Dante’s guarded speech is to be unriddled as aninvocation of Christian dimension and scope, these next two verses seem to undosuch a formulation with a certain exigency, for the story of Marsyas does notseem to lend itself to such understandings (but see the similar treatment ofApollo discussed in the note to verse 13).Dante probably did not have access to the fragmentary accounts knit together tomake the story of Marsyas that modern readers can find in various compendia. Theprehistory of Marsyas was, if known to him, interesting. Minerva, havinginvented the wind instrument that we know as the flute, or panpipes, sawherself, playing it, reflected in water and noticed how ugly the exercise madeher face. She hurled it away, only to have it picked up by Marsyas, who foundthat he quickly learned the skill to make his tunes. He became so convinced ofhis ability that he challenged Apollo to a musical contest (cf. those similarOvidian challengers of the gods’ aesthetic abilities, the daughters of KingPierus [Purg. I.9–12] and Arachne [Purg. XII.43–45]). Naturally, Apollo and hislyre outdo Marsyas and his flute. Since each combatant was to have his will ifvictorious, Apollo flays Marsyas alive (presumptuous mortals are always taughttheir lesson by the Ovidian gods whom they offend, but never seem to learn it).Ovid’s account (in the sixth book of the Metamorphoses) of the early stages ofthe myth are brief (vv. 383–386 [he spends the core of his account, vv. 387–391,on the flaying in graphic detail and then, in the quieter conclusion, vv.392–400, on the sadness of Marsyas’s fellow fauns and satyrs at his death andtransformation into the clearest stream in Phrygia]). He is a satyr defeated ina contest by Apollo on Minerva’s rejected reed and punished by the god; but dowe not catch a glimpse in him of a potentially failed Dante, his vernacular lowinstrument contrasted with the lofty Apollonian lyre? In the account ofMarsyas’s punishment that Dante knew best (Ovid, Metam. VI.383–400), his musicalinstrument has evidently humble origins: It is a reed (harundo [verse 384]) suchas a yokel might pluck to make a tuneful sound; it is also a flute (tibia [verse386]). Thus, along with presenting in Marsyas a coded figure of the poet as vaselectionis, Dante also would seem to encourage us to fashion a furtherunderstanding: As Marsyas, he is a proponent of the comic muse, of the lowstyle, against the higher forms of artistry intrinsically represented by Apollo,the flute versus the lyre. We have learned to read Dante’s controversialself-identifications with a certain perspicuity. At one remove, he goes out ofhis way (and we readily follow him with great relief) to show that he is not atall like Uzzah (see the note to Purg. X.56–57) or, for that matter, Arachne (seethe note to Purg. XII.43–45). On the other hand, we never rid ourselves of thesuspicion that the poet is also confessing that he, secretly, for all hisprotestation by the use of contrary exemplars, acknowledges precisely hisresemblance to these outlaws, these challengers to divine authority, thesechafers at divine constraint upon human knowledge and capacity. Ovid’s Marsyasis the opposite of Dante’s, who has been turned inside out, as it were. (SeeLevenstein’s succinct remark [Leve.2003.1, p. 412]: “While Ovid portrays thegod’s removal of the skin from the satyr, Dante describes the god’s removal ofthe satyr from the skin.”) [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s07-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c01-s07-i]]22–24. [part0009.html#c01-s08-e] Apollo now becomes God the Father, addressedby the first of his Trinitarian attributes, Power. His highest creation, theEmpyrean, is referred to as the “kingdom,” of which Dante hopes to be allowed toretain a weak but true copy in his mind; he will bring that back and write itdown for us. The phrase “l’ombra del beato regno” (the shadow of the blessèdkingdom—verse 23) reflects the Latin technical term umbra found in discussionsof figure and fulfillment in biblical exegesis. See Ledda (Ledd.2002.1), pp.302–3; Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 196–97; (Holl.1993.5), pp. 19–21; and Ledda(Ledd.1997.1), p. 137.

[part0009.html#c01-s09-e] The language here admits of two referentialfields; in the Ovidian one, the tree is Apollo’s laurel, to which Dante comes tocrown himself with its leaves, as his subject and the god himself shall make himworthy. However, poets are not usually portrayed as crowning themselves. Perhapsthat is a clue to our necessary radical transformation of the pagan myth as itapplies to Dante. In the Christian version of the myth, Apollo is Christ (seethe note to vv. 13–15) whose “tree” (the cross) the Christian poet approaches togather to himself the Christian version of the laurel wreath, the immortalitywon for humankind by Christ, which his poem and Christ’s love will make himworthy to receive. In this vein see Goffis (Goff.1964.1): “E così il ‘dilettolegno,’ a cui si rivolgerà Dante, è certo l’alloro, ma è anche il lignum crucis,e le foglie d’alloro non saranno segno di gloria terrena soltanto” (And thus the“beloved tree,” to which Dante shall address himself, is, to be sure, thelaurel, but it is also the wood of the Cross; and the laurel’s leaves shall notbe a sign of earthly glory alone). In Dante’s world, however, as the next tercetwill make clear, there are none or few who even long for such reward.The word legno occurs in nineteen passages in the poem, nine times as metonymicfor “ship,” seven times to mean “tree,” twice to mean “a piece of wood,” andonce to refer to the cross, the “tree” to which Jesus was nailed (Par. XIX.105).[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s09-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s09-i]]28–33. [part0009.html#c01-s10-e] Far from worrying about not having enoughlaurel leaves to accommodate all those worthy of them (intrinsically thecondition in earlier times, i.e., classical ones), Dante’s Apollo must take joywhenever, in this leaden age, anyone, no matter how undeserving, desires to becrowned with the leaves of “the Peneian bough,” that is, those of the laurel (orbay tree), in Daphne’s transformed state; Daphne’s father, god of a Thessalianriver, was named Peneus, and the river after him. See, as Scartazzini (comm. tovv. 31–33) suggests, Ovid (Metam. I.452): “Primus amor Phoebi Daphne Peneia”(Apollo’s first love, Peneus’s daughter, Daphne). [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s10-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c01-s10-i]]29. [part0009.html#c01-s10-e] Dante abruptly broadens the subject area toinclude emperors alongside of poets. Since, up to now (vv. 9–27), the focus hasbeen exclusively on poetry, it comes as something of a surprise to find theimperial crown beneath our gaze, no matter how usual the reference to bothlaureations may be in our minds. Dante’s sense of himself as political poet mayaccount for this expansion; nothing else in the immediate context would seem todo so. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s10-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s10-i]]34. [part0009.html#c01-s12-e] Arianna Punzi (Punz.1999.1) sees this line as anexample of “false modesty”; however, the line reads more ordinarily as modestyitself (“the smallest spark leaps from a great fire”), a reading that isridiculous and thus never attempted (e.g., how could Dante say the Commedia was“a small spark”?). On the other hand, normal grammatical usage would point inthat direction. This is not to suggest that Dante wanted us to read the versethat way, but that when we do (as he surely knew we would in our first readingof the verse, before we discard that reading as impossible), we excuse him fromthe potential sin of pride. Nonetheless, it is clear that his little spark ismeant to kindle a vast flame in us. That, however, is not necessarily to beunderstood as a prideful thought, when we consider the matter in light of thegiven of this poem (namely, that it is derived directly from God in order tohelp us to pray better), rather the completion of a chosen poet’s duty. [returnto English [part0009.html#c01-s12-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c01-s12-i]]35–36. [part0009.html#c01-s12-e] The translation is based on an interpretationthat may strike those who know the commentary tradition as erroneous (but seeHollander [Holl.1993.7], pp. 20–21; [Holl.1993.2], p. 91). These verses areusually (nearly universally) interpreted to refer to other better poets who willbe inspired to write by reading Dante (and who, because of his example, willhave even more success in finding Apollo’s favor). Michelangelo Picone has infact suggested (Pico.2002.4, p. 212n.) that Cino da Pistoia may be one such. Andeven the generally skeptical Scartazzini (1900, comm. to verse 35) falls victimto a probably unwise spirit of unanimity, although he is plainly uncomfortablewith the portrait of the poet that results from this interpretation. “Troppaumiltà” (overabundant humility) is his muttered response. Indeed, the verynotion that Dante might envision the possibility that a single other poet (muchless a whole crowd) might outdo him in poetic accomplishment seems nothing lessthan preposterous. In the later twentieth century, several commentators triedanother solution, one first reflected in the commentary tradition by DanieleMattalia (1960), who cites Giuseppe Toffanin’s remarks (Toff.1947.1), pp. 80–82,even though he does not agree with them, that try to make the case for thesaints in Heaven, including Beatrice, as being those whose prayers will beamended by Dante’s poem. That also seems a strained interpretation, sinceself-interested prayer is a necessary instrument only for those who are onearth, not yet experiencing their salvation. Nonetheless, the view impressedRocco Montano (Mont.1963.1), p. 321, enough to make its way to print yet againand, through him, in 1968, to the commentator Giuseppe Giacalone (comm. to vv.34–36). This minority position, however, does not hold up very well to scrutiny,either, though it is a welcome, if belated, response to the standard, ifunlikely, gloss. There is a “third way,” fortunately, of solving the problem.(See Hollander [Holl.2005.2 and 2006.1].) Literally, the verses seem to expressthe (not immodest) hope that the Comedy will help those who will read it to praymore effectively (and thus put themselves in the way of salvation—that wouldseem to be the necessary conclusion). It is no wonder that for centuries most ofDante’s readers avoided recognition of the barely hidden daring in suchreligious claims as this. But it seems to be the simplest explanation of theseverses, one that is in harmony with the avowed aim of this poet, which is tomove those living in the bondage of the sins of this life toward the liberty ofeternal glory (see the Epistle to Cangrande, v. 21).See the similar dispute that dogs a similar passage, Paradiso XXX.34. [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c01-s12-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c01-s12-i]]37–45. [part0009.html#c01-s13-e] This long and difficult beginning of thenarrative portion of the final cantica may be paraphrased as follows: The Sun(“the lamp of the world”) rises on us mortals from various points along thehorizon, but from that point at which four circles intersect in such a way as toform three crosses (generally understood as the circles of the horizon, theequator, the zodiac, the colure of the equinoxes, the last three of whichintersect the horizon in this way on the vernal equinox, March 21), it comesforth conjoined with a better constellation (Aries) and takes a better course,and it better tempers and imprints the material compound of the world with itsinforming power. And from that point on the horizon it had made morning there,where almost all was light (Purgatory), and evening here, where almost all wasdark (i.e., in the Northern Hemisphere). As Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 37–42)point out, Dante has marked the beginnings of all three cantiche with referencesto the time (Inf. II.1–5; Purg. I.13–30, 115–117). Singleton refines the point(comm. to vv. 44–45): Where Inferno begins at evening (around 6 pm) andPurgatorio at dawn (shortly before 6 am), Paradiso begins, more propitiously, atnoon, the most “noble” hour of the day (see Purg. XXXIII.104 and Conv.IV.xxiii.15). And see the note in Bosco/Reggio to the following tercet (vv.43–45) for some of the elaborate exegesis attached to the astronomical problemshere. For a detailed discussion in English, see Alison Cornish (Corn.2000.2),pp. 87–92. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s13-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s13-i]]46–48. [part0009.html#c01-s16-e] The lengthy opening description of theheavens yields to the first presence and first naming of Beatrice in Paradiso.Her superhuman ability to gaze directly and fixedly at the Sun reflects atradition insisting on eagles’ ability to do so found in Aristotle among theancients (De animalibus IX.xxxiv) and in Brunetto Latini among the moderns(Tresor I.v.8). And see Paradiso XX.31–32. As Carroll points out (comm. to vv.49–64), we probably should not draw allegorical conclusions about Beatrice’sturning leftward (a movement frequently symptomatic, in this poem, of moraldeficiency); here her turning in this direction is necessitated by her being inthe Southern Hemisphere where Beatrice was facing east; north, where the Sunshone, was thus to her left. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s16-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c01-s16-i]]49–54. [part0009.html#c01-s17-e] This, the first formally developed simile ofParadiso, is in fact double (and that its second element deploys the image of acompleted pilgrimage should not surprise us). We may sense an increasing degreeof abstraction in the similes of this cantica (but not always—see vv. 67–69,where Dante’s “transhumanation” is cast in physical terms; he is changed as wasGlaucus). For the increasingly abstract nature of the poetry of roughly thefirst two-thirds of Paradiso, see Chiappelli (Chia.1967.3). And for twobibliographies of studies devoted to the Dantean simile, see Sowell(Sowe.1983.1) and Varela-Portas (Vare.2002.1).Beatrice’s miraculous (to ordinary mortals) ability to look into the Sun ismomentarily granted to Dante, who sees the reflection of the Sun in her eyes andsomehow is able to look up into that planet with his returning gaze. When wereflect that, according to Purgatorio IV.62, the Sun itself is a mirror(specchio), Beatrice then becomes a mirror of the mirror of God.

[part0009.html#c01-s19-e] Some of the early commentators make theunderstandable mistake (since “here” obviously refers to the earth) of thinkingthat “there” applies to the heavens and not the pinnacle of the Mount ofPurgatory; however, both Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 49–57) and Francescoda Buti (comm. to vv. 49–63) comprehend that Dante and Beatrice are still in theearthly paradise, a fact that the title of this new cantica tends to make usforget.

The reader must assume that his greater sight results from his greatercloseness to the Sun at this highest point on the earth’s surface as well asfrom his regaining the vision of innocence (see the note to vv. 55–57).

[part0009.html#c01-s21-e] Venturi (comm. to vv. 62–63) believes thatthis additional brightness was caused by the sight of the Moon, now grown largerin its appearance because Dante is so much higher. However (and as Lombardi[comm. to this tercet] correctly objects), this cannot be the sphere of theMoon, which awaits Beatrice and Dante in the next canto, but is the sphere offire, in the outermost situation of the four elements that constitute our earth(water and earth, then air, and finally fire), a solution at first proposed in1333 or so by the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 58–63). And see verse 115 of this canto(“This instinct carries fire up toward the moon”), where the sphere of fire isapparently again alluded to.

[part0009.html#c01-s22-e] The guide and her charge presumably havepassed through the (unnamed) sphere of fire that girds the earth just below thesphere of the Moon; Dante’s eyes are guided by Beatrice’s beyond this home ofearth’s highest-dwelling element and to a first sight of the heavenly spheres.[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s22-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s22-i]]67–72. [part0009.html#c01-s23-e] Glaucus’s transformation, described by Ovid(Metam. XIII. 904–968), is a dazzling rendition of how an ordinary fisherman,chancing upon a magic herb, is metamorphosed into a god of the sea. Dante cansharply reduce the poetic space he devotes to the Ovidian scene because it is sofamiliar to his readers (at least the ones he most cares about). For theclassical history of Glaucus as it comes into Ovid, Dante’s primary source, seeDiskin Clay (Clay.1985.1).For Dante’s Glaucus (along with Marsyas) as figures of Dante’s own divinization,see Rigo (Rigo.1994.1), pp. 109–33. For the theme of deificatio in St. Bernard’sDe diligendo Deo as clarifying Dante’s notion of “transhumanation,” seeMigliorini-Fissi (Migl.1982.1), who indeed sees traces of Bernard’s workthroughout the poem, as does Mazzoni (Mazz.1997.1), especially pp. 178–80,192–230. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s23-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s23-i]]68. [part0009.html#c01-s23-e] For Glaucus’s “tasting” of the grass thattransforms him as “reversing” Adam’s “tasting” of the forbidden tree (Par.XXVI.115), see Rigo (Rigo.1994.1), p. 113. (The notion of Glaucus as Adam in hisrefound innocence goes well with that of Dante in his: See Carroll’s observationin his note to vv. 49–64.) We observe here a conflation of Ovid’s HeroidesXVIII.160, a verse (cited by Rigo.1994.1, p. 114) referring to Glaucus:“reddidit herba deum” (whom a plant once deified—tr. H. C. Cannon).The two major classical myths evoked in this canto, Apollo and Glaucus, alongwith the associated references to arrows and the ingestion of food, indicate thetwo main ways to understanding that we will hear about all through the cantica,intellectual penetration and a more passive reception of the truth.That Dante has turned to Ovid for three major myth/motifs in this canto (Apolloand Daphne/immortality; Apollo and Marsyas/being drawn out of one’s bodilylimits; Glaucus/transhumanation) would almost seem to indicate that, for Dante’spurposes, Ovid’s poem about the gods, transmogrified by Dante’s Christianintellect into shadows of a higher truth, is a more adaptable source thanVirgil’s martial epic for this more exalted and final component of the Comedy.If, after our encounter with the first cantos of Paradiso, we are of thatopinion, we are not altogether incorrect. However, if we believe that Virgil’stext is no longer a valued source in the poem’s most Christian precincts, wewill eventually be disabused of this notion, particularly in Cantos XV andXXXIII.

[part0009.html#c01-s24-e] For Dante “transhumanation” is the passingbeyond normal human limits by entering into a state at least approaching thatenjoyed by divinity.Chiarenza (Chia.1972.1), p. 83, holds this passage up to Hugh of St. Cher’scomparison of the difficulty of conveying one’s “intellectual vision” to someoneelse to the difficulty of describing the flavor of wine to one who had nevertasted it.See Migliorini-Fissi (Migl.1982.1), pp. 41–44, for St. Bernard’s relevantconcept of deificatio.

[part0009.html#c01-s24-e] Dante’s claim is lodged in self-consciouslanguage that, in a single verse, includes an Italian neologism (trasumanar),literally “to transhumanate,” an intransitive verb signifying “to become morethan human,” and a Latin phrase, per verba (in words).

There Paul is not certain as to whether he was inbody or not in his ascent through the heavens. For his phrase “third heaven” asmeaning, not the heaven of Venus, to which the phrase would ordinarily refer inDante, but the highest part of God’s kingdom, see St. Thomas, Summa TheologicaII–II, q. 175, a. 3, r. to obj. 4 (cited from the online edition of the CatholicEncyclopedia [www.newadvent.org/cathen/ [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/]]):“In one way by the third heaven we may understand something corporeal, and thusthe third heaven denotes the empyrean (I Tim. 2:7; Cf. I, 12, 11, ad 2), whichis described as the ‘third,’ in relation to the aerial and starry heavens, orbetter still, in relation to the aqueous and crystalline heavens. Moreover, Paulis stated to be rapt to the ‘third heaven,’ not as though his rapture consistedin the vision of something corporeal, but because this place is appointed forthe contemplation of the blessed. Hence the gloss on 2 Cor. 12 says that the‘third heaven is a spiritual heaven, where the angels and the holy souls enjoythe contemplation of God: and when Paul says that he was rapt to this heaven hemeans that God showed him the life wherein He is to be seen forevermore.’ ”On the Pauline stance of the poet here and elsewhere, see Mazzeo, “Dante and thePauline Modes of Vision” (Mazz.1960.1), pp. 84–110. (And see his earlier bookStructure and Thought in the “Paradiso” [Mazz.1958.1] for a wider considerationof the poetics of this cantica.) See Paradiso XXVII.64–65, where St. Peterfinally makes it plain that Dante is present, ascending through the heavens, inthe flesh. Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 73–75) make the point that, since Danteeventually allows us to believe that he went up in body (they cite Par. XXI.11and 61, passages that are perhaps less decisive than that in Par. XXVII), allthis coy uncertainty has a main purpose: to give himself Pauline credentials,since Paul himself either cannot or will not say in what state he was during hisrapture. Gragnolati (Grag.2005.1), pp. 162–74, joins those who believe thatDante contrives to make us see that he wants to be understood as having made thefinal ascent in the flesh.

[part0009.html#c01-s25-e] For Dante’s phrasing describing God’s love asmanifest in His creation, commentators beginning with Scartazzini (comm. to thisverse) have suggested the resonance of Boethius (Cons. Phil. II.m8.15), “coeloimperitans amor” (love governing the heavens). [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s25-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c01-s25-i]]75.

These two tercets create a picture of the totality of God’sspheres. Having created them in time, He also made eternal (sempiternal, asDante rightly says, i.e., having a beginning but not an end) their desire toreunite themselves with Him.

[part0009.html#c01-s26-e] The reference is pretty clearly to the “music ofthe spheres,” that harmony created by the movement initiated by the love of thespheres themselves for God. As early as the Ottimo (1333; comm. to vv. 76–81),students of the poem attributed the notion of the harmony of the spheres (as doother early commentators) to Macrobius’s commentary to the Ciceronian SomniumScipionis (for a brief overview of the vexed topic, the extent of Dante’sknowledge of this early-fifth-century neoplatonist, see Georg Rabuse,“Macrobio,” ED III [1971], pp. 757–59 [Rabuse enthusiastically supports the viewthat Dante knows both the Somnium Scipionis and the Saturnalia well]). Among themoderns, since Lombardi (1791 [comm. to vv. 76–78]), commentators have suggestedthe dependence here upon that concept, and, closer to our own time, Bosco/Reggio(comm. to vv. 76–77) point out that it is clear that Dante refers to theso-called “music of the spheres.” Such music is a pleasing notion, but all ofAristotle’s three greatest commentators—Averroës, Albert the Great, and ThomasAquinas—quash its possibility. Dante, as poet, seems to like the idea wellenough that he is willing to be its sponsor despite such firm and authoritativeopposition. Bosco/Reggio go on to point out that this reference to the music ofthe spheres is the only one found in Paradiso, where all later music will be inthe form of the singing of the saved and of the angels—less suspect musicalforms, we might conclude.

[part0009.html#c01-s27-e] Perhaps because humans are accustomed toseeing no measurable space-consuming object more vast than a lake or a sea, thepoet compares the extended fire he saw in the sky to a watery body. How we areto understand the exact nature of the phenomenon at which he gazed is not clear,although some believe (see the note to vv. 61–63) it is the fiery ring thatsurrounds the sphere of the Moon, a common fixture of medieval astronomy thatwould otherwise have remained unmentioned in the poem. But there is simply nocertainty on this matter. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s27-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s27-i]]82–84. [part0009.html#c01-s28-e] Both the beautiful sound (the music of thespheres? [see the note to verse 78]) and the brilliant and extended pool oflight (the sphere of fire between the earth and Moon? [see the note to vv.61–63]) increase Dante’s intense desire to know their realities. It will atleast seem that Beatrice’s answer (vv. 88–93) does little to answer either ofDante’s questions in ways that we, earthlings like him, would considersatisfying. However, it certainly does seem that the poet means us to be awareof our unslaked curiosity about the identity of these two heavenly phenomena. Anattractive hypothesis is that he means us to draw exactly these conclusionswithout having left himself tainted by incredible claims (e.g., “I passedthrough the sphere of fire and listened to the music of the spheres”).

[part0009.html#c01-s29-e] We learn definitively that Beatrice trulyreads the protagonist’s mind, a capacity that Virgil at times claimed but wasrarely, if ever, capable of demonstrating (see the notes to Inf. XVI.115–123;XXIII.25–30; Purg. XV.133–135). Her lips open in response before Dante’squestion has been voiced.The reason for the agitation experienced by the protagonist is explained byverses 82–84. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s29-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s29-i]]88–90. [part0009.html#c01-s30-e] Beatrice avers that, were only Dante thinkingin an otherwordly way, he would not have asked his two questions. He thinks ofwhat his senses are experiencing as though it were sensed on earth. Her point isthat it is precisely his earthly home that he has left behind and is indeedracing from as quickly as lightning flies. This response apparently does notsatisfy readers’ inquisitiveness much better than it satisfies theprotagonist’s. On the other hand, Benvenuto da Imola suggests (in his comm. toPar. I.91–93) that the sounds of celestial harmony could not be heard from earth(“audit sonum coeli, non quia sit ibi factus de novo, sed quia dum staret interra non poterat ipsum audire”). Thus Beatrice is intrinsically answeringDante’s first question; his earthly ears confounded the reality (the music ofthe spheres) of what they heard. As for the second, commentators, beginningperhaps with Lombardi (1791 [to verse 92]), have understood that Dante’sallusion is to the sphere of fire that circled the earth above the otherelements, near the Moon; in other words, that Beatrice’s words “lightningdarting from its place” contain a specific reference to the sphere of fire, asis now recognized in most discussions of this tercet.

(Both Sapegno [1955,comm. to vv. 124–126] and Singleton [1975, comm. to verse 116] cite this passagefrom the Confessions to make a similar point.) Dante’s rational soul isreturning to its “birthplace” in the heavens, where God breathed it into thebeing he was to become, his characteristics set by the Fixed Stars, as we learn,for instance at Paradiso VIII.94–114.

[part0009.html#c01-s32-e] Dante’s new question probably does not referto a concern that will arise later (if he is in the body, as he plainly seems tobelieve he is): How can he pass through the matter of the planetary spheres? SeePar. II.37–45 and the accompanying note; rather, it more likely relates to hissurprise that he in his bodied state can rise above not only land and water backon earth, but, far more puzzling to him, the lighter elements of air and fire.In the view of the author of the Codice Cassinese (comm. to verse 99), thereference is to two of the four elements: “scilicet. aerem et etherem, qui levessunt respectu aliorum duorum corporum gravium ut est terra et aqua” (that is,air and fire, which are light in comparison to those other two bodies [elements]that are heavy, as are earth and water), a formulation that shows us afourteenth-century commentator using the word corpo not to refer to the materialheavenly spheres (as some modern commentators believe it must), but to the fourelements. For the identity of ether and ignis, see Guido da Pisa (comm. to Inf.XIV.52–60). [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s32-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s32-i]]97. [part0009.html#c01-s33-e] While rhyme may have forced the Latin verbrequïevi (I was content), Dante surely enjoyed Latinizing his own speech as acharacter in his own poem (for the first [and last] time since his first word inthe poem [Inf. 1.65, Miserere]). He is, as his bibliography attests, a writer invernacular and in Latin. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s33-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s33-i]]100–102. [part0009.html#c01-s34-e] We have been made aware of the wonder ofthose in beatitude at the obtuseness of mortals at least since we first observedthe angel finding the plight of Dante at the gates of Dis of absolutely nointerest (Inf.

[part0009.html#c01-s35-e] Beatrice’s response fills the rest of thecanto, with the exception of its final line of narrative. It is divided intothree parts. In the first (vv. 100–126), she deals with Dante’s puzzlement as tohis upward inclination, given his mortal condition; in the second (vv. 127–135),she admits that fallen human nature is prone to being drawn downward, away fromthis true inclination; in the third (vv. 136–141), she avers that Dante is nowproof against such wrong directionality because he has been freed of sin.[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s35-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s35-i]]103–105. [part0009.html#c01-s35-e] While hardly answering Dante’s questiondirectly (vv. 98–99: How can his heaviness pass through lighter zones in theatmosphere above the earth?), Beatrice begins her discourse on the nature of theuniverse, the formal disposition of which is ordered, in resemblance of itsCreator. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s35-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s35-i]]106–108. [part0009.html#c01-s36-e] In the structure of the created universe,where the divine form first became manifest, angels (and humans?) possess thecapacity to understand that form. The Scholastic word “form” is akin to thePlatonic term “idea,” a spiritual essence inhering in its physicalmanifestations. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s36-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s36-i]]109–120. [part0009.html#c01-s37-e] Beatrice now presents the components of theuniverse’s order: All things in nature, whether nearer to God or farther, have anatural inclination toward the good. While their destinations differ, eachresponds to its own inborn impulse in finding its goal, whether fire (guidedtoward the lunar sphere), the sensitive soul in irrational creatures, the forceof gravity in inanimate things—and not only irrational things (animals,inanimate nature), but angels and humans as well. Both these classes of beingpossess not only intellect, but love; the latter, as Bosco/Reggio point out(comm. to verse 120) in the sense of “capable of willing,” as in PurgatorioXVII.92–93 (“amore … d’animo” [love, whether natural or of the mind]). [returnto English [part0009.html#c01-s37-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c01-s37-i]]109–111. [part0009.html#c01-s37-e] For a possible poetic precursor to Dante’sformulation of the laws of gravity, see Ovid (Metam. I.29–30), as pointed out byRossini (Ross.2000.1), p. 172. The passage was first noted by Daniello (comm. tothis tercet): “Densior his tellus, elementaque grandia traxit et pressa estgravitate sua” (the earth was heavier than these [the elements of fire and air],and, drawing with it the grosser elements, sank to the bottom of its own weight[tr. F. J. Miller]). And see the note to vv. 91–93, above. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s37-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c01-s37-i]]112–117. [part0009.html#c01-s38-e] Reverting to nautical metaphor (see vv.67–69) for the life-journeys of all created things, whether capable of willingor not, the poet equates the purposes of inanimate and one kind of animate lifewith voyages toward various ports, the ends for which God has ordained these ofHis creations. This impulse is exemplified in three kinds of being: a lightelement (fire) with its inherent “desire” to rise to its own sphere (see thenote to vv. 61–63); creatures possessed of an animal (but not a rational) soul;and a heavy element (earth) with its obedience to the law of gravity, expressedas a “desire” to become compacted (the opposite impulse from that of fire).[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s38-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s38-i]]118–120. [part0009.html#c01-s40-e] We now realize, if we did not at first,that “mortal hearts” did not refer to those of humans, in whom hearts are boundwith immortal souls, guided by intellect and by choice in their loving (theirwill), but to the inclinations or instincts of animals, guiding their actions.[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s40-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c01-s40-i]]121–126. [part0009.html#c01-s41-e] It is God’s plan that the Empyrean, bathedin His light, is unmoving, peaceful, while the uppermost and neighboring heaven,the Primum Mobile, itself most agitated, imparts motion to the other spheresbelow. It is humans’ eventual goal to be drawn toward God. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s41-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c01-s41-i]]127–135. [part0009.html#c01-s43-e] Dante, aware of our awareness that not allcreatures possessed of immortal souls tend toward the good, explains why not allarrows hit their target. The fault is not in the archer (God), but in thematerial (Beatrice switches metaphoric equivalence in mid-metaphor, moving fromarchery to the production of artifacts): Some of the craftsman’s work is faultybecause of the innate shortcomings of his material. It is a paradox that God’smore noble creatures may swerve in their movement while the lesser follow morepredictable paths; that paradox results from the unique gift of the freedom ofthe will to humans and to angels (see Par. V.19–24). [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s43-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c01-s43-i]]136–141. [part0009.html#c01-s46-e] Having offered the necessary philosophicbackground, Beatrice now more or less answers Dante’s question: His naturalinclination is to move upward. To be sure, his quandary (vv. 98–99) was how he,as an object possessing mass and weight, could penetrate matter, and thisconcern is not, strictly speaking, answered in her remarks so much as it isbypassed for a higher degree of abstraction.Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 141) set into relief the paradox that underliesthese two terzine. While Dante’s voyage through the heavens is itself miraculousin any terms, his upward tendency, which seems paranormal to him, is utterlynatural; that he was called to witness, as was Paul, is a mystery that only Godcan explain; that, once called, he rises through the spheres is explained by themerest science, the result of a spiritual force of gravity, as it were.

[part0009.html#c01-s47-e] The final verse of the canto, returning to thenarrative mode, describes Beatrice’s renewed contemplation of Heaven, to whichshe is obviously pleased to return, having had to lower her intellectual powersin order to explain what to her is intuited and obvious to such an auditor asDante, with his as yet necessarily lesser capacity to experience and tounderstand the highest truths.

[part0009.html#c02-s01-e] For the Ovidian resonances in this passage, somarked by classical motif (the poem as voyage across a sea, the poet as inspiredby gods and/or muses) and allusion (Jason and the voyage of the Argonauts), seePicone (Pico.1994.1), pp. 191–200.

[part0009.html#c02-s01-e] The canto begins apparently by discouraging the“average reader” from attempting to understand it. As we shall shortly discover,only some of us are welcomed to the attempt (vv. 10–18). We may be put in mindof the similar gesture near the beginning of Convivio (I.i.2–6). That passagecontinues (I.i.7): “Blessed are the few who sit at the table where the bread ofthe angels is eaten, and most unfortunate those who share the food of sheep”(tr. R. Lansing). See O’Brien (Obri.1979.1) for a strong differentiation of thereferences to the “bread of angels” in these two passages, the firstaccommodating secular knowing, this one based on faith and the Scriptures. Forthe differing audiences sought for Convivio and Paradiso, see Vincenzo Placella(Plac.1995.1). [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s01-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c02-s01-i]]1. [part0009.html#c02-s01-e] Despite the distraction of an address to thereader, we realize that, beginning with the opening of this canto, we are in thesphere of the Moon. There is only one other occasion in the ten heavens when theentrance to a celestial realm coincides with the beginning of a canto: ParadisoXXI (Saturn). Those who are overwhelmed by the organized quality of Dante’s mindmight like to be aware of its “disorderly” side as well.The “little bark” inevitably reminds readers of the “small bark”(navicella—Purg. I.2) that represents Dante’s intellect at the beginning ofPurgatorio. His capacities, we may infer, have increased in accord with hisnearness to God; his ship, we understand by implication, is now a mighty craft;ours is the “little bark.” [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s01-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c02-s01-i]]2. [part0009.html#c02-s01-e] For only the second time in the poem (see Inf.XXII.118), Dante addresses his readers as listeners, as Aversano (Aver.2000.2),p. 10, points out. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s01-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c02-s01-i]]3. [part0009.html#c02-s01-e] The phrase “ship that singing makes its way” onceagain capitalizes on the equation ship = poem (see Purg. I.2). The word legno asmetaphoric expression, the material of construction being referred to as thething itself, has a classical heritage and a heavy Dantean presence. While inPurgatorio it appears four times without once having this meaning, in Inferno ithad appeared ten times, in fully seven of which it denotes “ship” or “boat.” Nowin the last cantica it is used six times, twice (here and in Canto XIII.136)with the meaning “ship.”The self-consciously “literary” language continues that strain from the first 36verses of the opening canto in less lengthy but similar behavior in the first 18of this one. And see Paola Allegretti (Alle.2004.1) for a consideration of theopening passage of this canto (II.1–15) as the centerpiece between two otherimportant passages involving ships, Purgatorio II.10–51 and ParadisoXXXIII.94–96, with ample consideration of classical sources, in a revisitationof Curtius’s often-cited essay, “The Ship of the Argonauts” (Curt.1950.1).[return to English [part0009.html#c02-s01-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c02-s01-i]]4–6. [part0009.html#c02-s02-e] The warning sounds “elitist,” even scornful(and see the note to vv. 13–15). But if we think about what is at stake, nothingless than our salvation, its exclusionary nature seems only necessary. Did Dantereally mean that those of us who have no Christian upbringing either cannot besaved or at least cannot be saved by reading Dante’s poem? The latter is whatthe passage apparently asserts, for if we lose track of him, we may lose trackof God. It is perhaps necessary to remind ourselves that the voice we hearbelongs to an unsuccessful, exiled Florentine, with one completed work longerthan a single canzone (Vita nuova, some twenty years behind him), who has bankedall that he is and has on this text that he will barely manage to finish beforehis death. The intervening centuries have allowed Dante an authority onlydoubtfully accorded him by his early commentators, who by and large manage toavoid paying sufficient attention to this amazing claim, with possibly thesingle exception of Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 5–6), perhaps the sole interpreterto put the potential failure of Dante’s readership in specifically Christianterms: “quia cum vestro parvo ingenio non possetis intelligere meam profundammateriam, et possetis errare a via rectae fidei” (lest, with your limitedunderstanding, you fail to understand the depth of my material, and wander fromthe path of the true faith [italics added]). Benvenuto goes on to cite AniciusManlius Severinus Boethius, not the Consolation of Philosophy, but thespecifically Christian treatise, The Trinity Is One God Not Three Gods.

And for the “triune Apollo,” see Di Scipio (Disc.1995.1), pp.258–59, who offers a passage in Alain de Lille’s Anticlaudianus as a potentialsource for Dante’s Christianized Apollo.

I.1–3)is the watery expression for nonaqueous spaces. The assertion that the poet isthe first to report his travel over such “seas” is essentially true; for anexhaustive discussion of the topos of novelty in the Commedia, see Ledda(Ledd.2002.1), pp. 57–86. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s03-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c02-s03-i]]9. [part0009.html#c02-s03-e] Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 7–9) thinks that Dante’s“nove,” not only indicating the number “nine,” is more subtly construed as aform of the adjective nuovo (new), and believes that the poet felt the need fornew muses since he was writing of the Christian God, not the pagan divinities.While that argument probably needs to be more accommodating (since the phrase“nine Muses” is bypassed only with considerable difficulty), it should havealerted readers to the unlikely presence of pagan goddesses at this height inthe poem’s development. Suffice it to say that such concerns were expressed fromtime to time in the commentary tradition, but have never won the day, so thatthere results a certain unsureness of exactly how to deal with this verse.Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) has a useful review of such puzzlement, butdoes not attempt to solve the riddle himself. However, possibly the mostcompelling gloss to this verse was written by Giovan Battista Gelli halfway intothe sixteenth century, and not in response to this verse, but to Inferno II.7–9:“Ma perchè io mi persuado che il Poeta nostro, per trattar di quelle cosedivine, le quali son veramente divine, e non fabulose come quelle delle qualitrattano quasi tutti gli altri poeti, abbia in tutte le cose ancor concettimolto più alti e più profondi di loro, dico ancora io (ascendendo con lointelletto più alto, …) che le Muse, propiamente e divinamente parlando,significano quelle intelligenze, o sieno anime o sieno motori, che muovono eguidano le nove sfere celesti, cioè quelle de’ sette pianeti, quella del cielostellato e quella del primo mobile” (However, since I am persuaded that ourpoet, in order to treat of things divine—indeed truly divine, not the stuff offable, such as almost all other poets deal with—had in all things ideas bothmore lofty and more profound than they do; and I say further, ascending higherwith my intellect, that the Muses, properly and divinely speaking, signify thoseintelligences, whether they be souls or movers, that move and direct the nineheavenly spheres, that is those of the seven planets, that of the Starry Sphere,and that of the Primum Mobile.) See Hollander (Holl.1993.3), p. 227, for ahighly similar solution without, however, reference to Gelli. If the verse isread in this way, the discomfort of Benvenuto is addressed without twisting theliteral sense of the line. It is the nine heavens that are referred to as“muses”; they are the sign of God’s creating power and lead Dante’s mind toport. (Several commentators, beginning with Vellutello, refer to the Muses inthis context as Dante’s bussola [compass], but only one [Campi, comm. to vv.7–9] sees that metaphor in a Christian conceptual frame, i.e., that these arenot the classical Muses.) [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s03-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c02-s03-i]]10–12. [part0009.html#c02-s04-e] The handful of Christian readers who will beable to navigate the third canticle are marked by long devotion to the study ofreligious truth (not necessarily demonstrating, as several commentators urge, amore general philosophical interest). For the distinction, see Attilio Mellone,“Pane degli angeli,” ED (IV [1973]), p. 266, contrasting what is conveyed by theexpression “bread of angels” when it is used in Convivio (I.i.7) to its meaninghere; there it covers all kinds of knowing, but here only revealed truth.The opening tercet looks to the Bible and to Dante’s Convivio, as Singletonpoints out (comm. to Par.I.1–6 and 10–11). While the biblical phrase (Psalms 77[78]:25, Wisdom 16:20) is clearly theological in meaning, the passage fromConvivio (I.i.7) is not: “Blessed are the few who sit at the table where thebread of the angels is eaten, and most unfortunate those who share the food ofsheep!” (tr. R. Lansing). It seems likely that the author of the Comedy wouldlook back upon these words with a shudder, noting this hostility to the mostChristian of images, the faithful as a flock to which Jesus is shepherd.

[part0009.html#c02-s04-e] “Voi altri pochi” (you other few): This is thefifteenth address to the reader in the poem. See the note to Inferno VIII.94–96;and see Ledda (Ledd.2002.1), pp. 117–58, for a full discussion of Dante’saddresses to the reader (nineteen in all, according to him [pp. 119–21]), aspart of the poet’s larger authorial strategies.

The offertory verse fromthe mass for that day, O’Brien reports, quoting the Roman Missal, contains thephrase “the bread of angels” in the following exalted context: “The Lord Godopened the gates of Heaven and rained down manna upon them (the disciples incompany of the risen Jesus) so that they might eat; He gave them heavenly bread;and, hallelujah, man ate the bread of angels (panem Angelorum manducavit homo).”[return to English [part0009.html#c02-s04-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c02-s04-i]]12.

[part0009.html#c02-s05-e] We are warned that even a Christian reader,losing track of the ship that is Paradiso, may get lost in these precincts.

[part0009.html#c02-s06-e] The “famous men” are the Argonauts whoaccompanied Jason on the first voyage made on a ship, in the thirteenth centuryb.c., to Colchis, a voyage already referred to (Inf. XVIII.86–87) and that willfurnish the matter for the ultimate “historical” reference in the poem (Par.XXXIII.95–96), a final look at the voyage of the Argo.Dante refers to Colchis by the singular form of the adjectival noun of place,“colco.” [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s06-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c02-s06-i]]17–18. [part0009.html#c02-s06-e] In order to gain the Golden Fleece, Jason,aided by Medea’s herbal concoctions, performs wondrous deeds in Colchis (Metam.VII.100–158). In Ovid, however, it is not Jason’s shipmates who stand amazed atwhat they witness of Jason’s astounding feats (e.g., plowing a field by means ofthe iron-tipped horns of two bulls, turned upside down and serving as Jason’splow, and seeding it with serpents’ teeth, with a resulting harvest ofsoldiers), but the onlooking Colchians (“mirantur Colchi” [Metam. VII.120]).Dante is here not nodding, but “rewriting” the classical text in order to makeit more worthy of bearing a Christian message, as Picone is aware (Pico.2002.2),p. 47. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s06-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c02-s06-i]]19–22. [part0009.html#c02-s07-e] The narrative continues with Dante andBeatrice being drawn heavenward by their desire for God, she with her eyes fixedon Heaven, he with his fixed on hers, which serve as his mirrors. This is thefirst of the formulaic ascents that will precede the arrival and description ofeach new heaven. For a listing of them all, see the page facing the “map” ofParadise in the front matter.

[part0009.html#c02-s07-e] While some complicate the meaning of thecomparison, it is perhaps better to see it in simple terms: The poet, who knowsthat the stars are actually moving rather rapidly in their orbits, comparestheir movement to the rapid upward movement of Beatrice and himself.

[part0009.html#c02-s08-e] One of the most frequently discussed examplesof Dante’s employment of the device hysteron proteron, a rhetorical figure that,to denote speed and the resultant difficulty of knowing which event in asequence preceded which other(s), reverses the normal order. As a speeding arrow(actually a bolt shot from a crossbow) is suddenly released from the catch (or“nut” or “peg” [according to Tozer on vv. 23–24]) on the bow, flies, and strikesits target, that is how quickly Dante finds himself within the surface of theMoon, so quickly indeed that the constituent moments of the ascent seem to havebeen experienced in reverse order. Gabriele (comm. to vv. 23–24) informs us thatthis iron “arrow” (the bolt) was usually four-sided. [return to English[part0009.html#c02-s08-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c02-s08-i]]30. [part0009.html#c02-s10-e] Beatrice makes plain what we have probablyfathomed: Dante is in the sphere of the Moon, within the body of this “star”itself. Dante’s terms for the heavenly bodies are, from a modern point of view,both inconsistent and, at times, different from ours, as the reader has alreadyprobably noted. (Later on in this canto, he will refer to the Moon as a planet[pianeto, verse 76] and not, as here, a “star.” He uses the termsinterchangeably; for us the Moon is neither of the above.) [return to English[part0009.html#c02-s10-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c02-s10-i]]31–36. [part0009.html#c02-s11-e] Dante’s first impression of the physicalityof the Moon tells us that its matter is less “material” than Earth’s: For allits rocklike qualities, it seems a cloud. As Singleton (comm. to verse 31)points out, Aristotle taught in De caelo that the Moon and all above isphysically different from our material world. It is thus that Dante mustdescribe it as “eternal,” since, unlike Earth, it is imperishable. ThatBeatrice, pure form, penetrates the matter of the Moon, is not surprising; thatDante also does so raises the question in his mind that we find referred to invv. 37–39. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s11-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c02-s11-i]]32. [part0009.html#c02-s11-e] The poet is of the opinion that the Moon shineswith its own light as well as reflecting the light of the Sun (Mon.III.iv.17–18), as Singleton observes (comm. to verse 32). In this canto, Danterefers only to the second phenomenon (vv. 79–81). [return to English[part0009.html#c02-s11-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c02-s11-i]]37–45. [part0009.html#c02-s13-e] The poet raises the question once more (seePar. I.4–6, Par. I.73, Par. I.98–99) of his presence in the heavens with hisflesh in such a way as to make us feel that he wants us to believe he was therein body (otherwise the “bonus” referred to in the tercet that concludes thispassage will not apply).Singleton (comm. to Par. I.98–99) refers to St. Thomas’s words that were clearlymeant to calm fearful Christians, worried that at the general resurrection,saved souls would be kept from approaching Heaven by the substance of thespheres. Here is Thomas’s answer (Summa contra Gentiles IV.87): “Neither doesthis divine promise meet an impossibility in the assertion that celestial bodiesare unbreakable so that the glorious bodies may not be elevated above them. Forthe divine power will bring it about that the glorious bodies can besimultaneously where the other bodies are; an indication of this was given inthe body of Christ when He came to the disciples, ‘the doors being shut’ (John20:26).”See Picone (Pico.2000.1), pp. 7–12, for discussion of Dante’s bodily assumption;and again (Pico.2002.2), pp. 35–39, hammering home his essential observation,that Dante wants us to acknowledge his presence in paradise in the flesh,without, perhaps, paying sufficient attention to the deliberate coyness of hisclaim, only made indirectly (if clearly enough) some three-quarters of the wayinto the cantica (see the note to Par.

[part0009.html#c02-s20-e] Dante restates (as Beatrice knew he would)his previous argument, found in Convivio II.xiii.9, that the dark places in theMoon are the result of rarer matter (which does not reflect the Sun’s rays aswell as denser matter does) in the surface of the Moon. However, and asBosco/Reggio point out (comm. to this passage), the protagonist has here gonedeeper into error by making this phenomenon more inclusive and even, perhaps,general, using the plural in line 60, corpi, and thus indicating other celestialbodies in addition to the Moon.Where most critics believe Dante’s source for this view is Averroës, AndréPézard, as is duly reported by Sapegno in his introductory note to hiscommentary on this canto, believes it lies in the Roman de la Rose (vv.16803–16850 [ed. Lecoy], vv. 16833–16880 [tr. Dahlberg]). And Vasoli(Vaso.1972.1), p. 36, cites Pézard (Peza.1965.1), pp. 1377–78, for Jean deMeun’s passage with its view of the moonspots. What is most fascinating aboutJean’s words to the student of the Commedia is how clearly reflected they seemto be in Dante’s. (And the closeness is all the more arresting because Il Fiorecontains no similar passage; there can be no question of the Roman’s directinfluence on Dante here, no question that Dante is here citing a putativeearlier self in Il Fiore.) In the Roman, Nature, confessing to Genius, resolvesthe question of the moonspots more or less precisely as Dante had in Convivio:“It seems to men that the moon (la lune) may indeed not be clean and pure (necteet pure), because in some places it shows up dark (obscure). But it is becauseof its double nature that it appears opaque and cloudy (espesse et trouble) insome places … because it is both clear and opaque (clere et espesse) ….” Jean isarguing that the Moon has two kinds of matter, clear and opaque, and that theSun’s beams pass right through the clear but are reflected by the opaque; andthen, beginning at verse 16825 (16855 in Dahlberg’s translation), Nature, likeBeatrice, turns to experimental means of demonstration: “But if one took lead,or something dense (plom ou quelque chose espesse) that does not allow rays topass through, and placed oneself on the side opposite to that from which theSun’s rays come, the form would return immediately.” It is difficult to believethat Dante did not have this passage in mind when he developed his owndiscussion, also involving “experimental science,” if coming up with a verydifferent solution, one that objects strenuously to the mere physicality ofNature’s explanation, as we shall see. Thus, if Dante reveals his knowledge ofthe French text here, he does not reveal himself as an uncritical admirer.This discussion touches on one of the great unresolved issues confrontingreaders of the Commedia: Dante’s knowledge of the Old French masterpiece ofGuillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun. To deal with the state of the unresolvedissue briefly, we should be aware of at least three possible answers to thespiny question: (1) Il Fiore is indeed by Dante, and thus he knew the Roman fromhis youth (since the latter work is a sort of free translation of passages fromthe Old French work, and Contini—as well as almost all who make the Fiore a partof Dante’s bibliography—places it very early in Dante’s career, in the 1280s or,at the latest, in the early 1290s [see Rossi (Ross.2003.1), p. 20]). (2) IlFiore was indeed read by Dante, but someone else wrote it, which explains why hecites this Italian “translation” of the Rose (for some textual resonances of IlFiore in the Commedia, see ED II [1970], pp. 898–900) but not the original;there is thus no direct relationship between the French work and Dante’s. (3)Another view would hold that, beginning with this passage, Dante reveals hisrecent reading of the Roman, a text that he encountered only after he hadfinished composing Purgatorio. In recent years the dispute has intensified, evenin Italy, where—while Contini, much of whose later life was devoted todemonstrating Dantean authorship, remained among the living—dissenting voiceswere not very often heard. See the balanced volume, edited by Baranski and Boyde(Bara.1997.3), devoted in part to the question of the work’s authorship;Leonardi (Leon. 1996.1), who believes it is authentic; Malato (Mala.1999.1), pp.138–48, considering arguments pro et contra, and tending toward a negative view;and Pasquini (Pasq.2001.1), p. 43, denying Dantean authorship. For what hadearlier become the standard view and the basic bibliography, see GianfrancoContini, Fiore, Il (ED II [1970]), pp. 895–901; and for a listing of some moreagnostic views, see Hollander (Holl.2001.1), pp. 182–83. More recently, we haveLuciano Rossi’s attempt to start the investigation over again (Ross.2003.1),reminding us of his senior colleague’s early attempt to accomplish a similartask: Picone’s remarks on the problems of attribution (Pico.1974.1).

[part0009.html#c02-s21-e] Beatrice begins with a sweeping denunciationof Dante’s position in a thoroughly Scholastic manner, making clear the natureof the thesis that she will set about to destroy (Dante’s hypothesis regardingalternating layers of rarity and density). For this tercet as reflecting thepoet’s disavowal of his earlier Averroist views of the issue, see Cassell(Cass.2004.1), pp. 54–55.

For a careful study of the central theological andscientific issues here and the history of their reception among Dante’s critics,see Vasoli (Vaso.1972.1). And for an immensely helpful basic bibliography onDante in relation to the various sciences that make their presence felt in thepoem, see the extended note by Simon Gilson (Gils.2001.2), pp. 58–65.

[part0009.html#c02-s22-e] The first part of Beatrice’s discourseattacks the notion (introduced by Dante in verse 60) that various stars in theStarry Sphere shine brighter or less bright and, indeed, have otherdistinguishing characteristics (e.g., color, size, shape), simply because theyare more or less dense. This would make the differentiating power single, andwould be at odds with what we know of the variety of God’s formal principles. Somuch for the larger issue at stake here.

[part0009.html#c02-s25-e] Turning to the phenomenon itself, Beatriceadduces two arguments to destroy Dante’s position, the first involving twopoints (vv. 73–82), the second, a single one (vv. 83–105), building on thesecond point in the first argument, an extended disproof by imagined experiment.[return to English [part0009.html#c02-s25-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c02-s25-i]]73–82. [part0009.html#c02-s25-e] If the dark spots on the Moon were the resultof rarer matter, then matter rare and dense would be distributed either randomlyor in strips, as meat and fat in creatures or pages in a book (for this secondimage, vv. 77–78, see Hatcher [Hatc.1971.1]). Were the first case true (i.e.,were there “holes” without density in the Moon), we would verify that factduring eclipses of the Sun; and, since we cannot, Beatrice says, we must look tothe second possible cause put forward by Dante.For studies of the problem presented by the dark spots on the Moon, see PagetToynbee, “Dante’s Theories as to the Spots on the Moon” (Toyn.1902.1), pp. 78–86(for a discussion of possible sources and of some of the confusion caused by thepassage). See also Manlio Pastore Stocchi (Past.1981.1). And see Nardi(Nard.1985.1), Stabile (Stab.1989.1), pp. 47–55 & nn., and Picone (Pico.2000.1),pp. 21–25.

[part0009.html#c02-s28-e] If then, Beatrice reasons, there are no“holes” for the Sun’s light to come through, we must hypothesize the presence ofdense matter that will act as a mirror for whatever light has penetrated therare matter beneath the Moon’s surface. [return to English[part0009.html#c02-s28-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c02-s28-i]]91–93. [part0009.html#c02-s31-e] Dante will object, Beatrice says, that thefarther reflection, because of its greater distance, will seem dimmer, aproposition that she will spend four tercets tearing down. [return to English[part0009.html#c02-s31-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c02-s31-i]]94–105. [part0009.html#c02-s32-e] In Aristotelian manner, Beatrice extols thevirtue of experiment. In this “thought experiment” that she proposes for Danteto perform, the two equidistant mirrors (one of which is, strictly speaking,unnecessary) represent the surface of the Moon, while the one set farther backstands in for the indented portion, where the dense part begins. The threelights reflected in the mirror will show equal brightness, if not equal size.Thus, as Beatrice clearly means to instruct Dante, the quality of the light isnot affected by distance; only the quantity is.For a discussion of this passage and the significance of mirrors in Paradiso,see Miller (Mill.1977.1). See also Tate (Tate.1961.1), offering a first“Trinitarian” reading of the third experimentally unnecessary mirror. Boyde(Boyd.1995.1), pp. 14–16, actually performed a version of the experiment inorder to test Dante’s method (it passed his test). Gilson (Gils.1997.1), pp.204–6, discusses various other similar “experiments” described by earlierwriters (Pseudo-Thomas on the Meteorologica, Chalcidius on the Timaeus, RogerBacon, Albert the Great on the De causis), concluding that, while Albert’s isthe closest to Dante’s, in this (as in so much else) Dante simply cannot bepinned down. And now see Turelli (Ture.2004.1), in polemic with Kleiner(Klei.1994.1), p. 104 (who believes that “dopo il dosso” means “directly behindyour back,” thus making the experiment literally impossible). But see Landino’sgloss to vv. 100–108; he simply (and understandably) assumes that the light isabove the experimenter’s head (“et sopra el capo tuo ti sia un lume”). In ourown time, Turelli convincingly defends the experimental “correctness” ofBeatrice’s verbal demonstration; Moevs (Moev.2005.1), p. 115, however, acceptsKleiner’s presupposition, arguing that in the thought experiment we must realizethat Dante possesses—meaningfully, of course—a transparent body.

[part0009.html#c02-s36-e] Beatrice turns to simile (one of the fairlyinfrequent occasions on which the poet puts the simile-forging power into thehands of a character [but cf. Inf. XXVII.94–97]): As the Sun’s rays reduce snowto its underlying essence (water), stripping it of its accidental qualities(cold, whiteness), so Beatrice’s mind will rid Dante’s intellect of its improperqualities and return it to its original condition.

[part0009.html#c02-s38-e] Going back, in thought, to the Beginning,the Empyrean, Beatrice turns her attention to the Primum Mobile, the ninthsphere, where nothing may be seen but where all the powers that course throughthe universe have their origins in space and time. See Convivio II.xiv.15: “For,as the Philosopher says in the fifth book of the Ethics, ‘legal justice disposesthe sciences for our learning, and commands that they be learned and taught inorder that they not be forsaken’; so with its movement the aforesaid heavengoverns the daily revolution of all the others, by which every day they allreceive and transmit here below the virtue of all their parts” (tr.

It is from here that they exercise their influence on earth. [returnto English [part0009.html#c02-s39-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c02-s39-i]]118–120. [part0009.html#c02-s40-e] Perhaps it is best to follow Bosco/Reggio’sinterpretation of this difficult tercet, which they understand in light of linesfrom Purgatorio XXX.109–110: “Not only by the working of the wheels above / thaturge each seed to a certain end.…” They argue that this tercet then means thatthe seven lower heavens (after the Primum Mobile and the Starry Sphere) disposein diverse ways the various essences or powers that they receive from the StarrySphere, adapting them to their own precise purposes.

[part0009.html#c02-s42-e] Beatrice’s admonition prepares Dante to dohis own reasoning (and do better than he has done so far). If he learns fromthis experience, he will not only understand the principle that explains thephenomenon of the moonspots, but other things as well.

[part0009.html#c02-s43-e] Only now does Beatrice turn her attentionto the angels (“the blessèd movers”), the artisans of all creation.

[part0009.html#c02-s44-e] And the Starry Sphere, into the stars ofwhich the powers are distributed, receives that imprinting from theIntelligences (angels) in the Primum Mobile. There is a possible ambiguity here,as Dante uses the singular (mente profonda) to indicate either the Cherubim (theangels of knowledge) or all nine angelic orders, as the context would seem todemand.

[part0009.html#c02-s45-e] The “dust” that in Genesis (3:19 [“pulvises, et in pulverem reverteris”]) is our flesh is seen here as activated in itsvarious members by the angelic intelligences—unless we are once again to takethe singular (intelligenza—verse 136) at face value (see the note to vv.130–132), in which case Beatrice is speaking only of the Cherubim, which seemsunlikely. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s45-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c02-s45-i]]139–141. [part0009.html#c02-s47-e] The undivided power of primal angelicintelligence (found in the ninth sphere), descending, makes a different unionwith each star that it animates, similar to the way in which it binds with humansouls. For this notion, Pietrobono (comm. to this tercet) cites ConvivioII.v.18: “These movers by their intellect alone produce the revolution in thatproper subject which each one moves. The most noble form of heaven, which has initself the principle of this passive nature, revolves at the touch of the motivepower which understands it; and by touch I mean contact, though not in a bodilysense, with the virtue which is directed toward it” [tr. R. Lansing].Fraccaroli (Frac.1906.1) offers these verses as an example of Dante’s frequentdivergence from the text of Plato’s Timaeus when it counters the opinions ofAristotle (Fraccaroli is among those scholars who believe that Dante actuallyknew the text of that work in Chalcidius’s translation rather than from someother intermediary—see the note to Par. IV.24). In Plato the stars areself-propelled. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s47-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c02-s47-i]]142–144. [part0009.html#c02-s48-e] The greater or lesser effulgence of a starresults from the conjoined qualities that a particular star has in conjunctionwith the informing virtues, or powers, of its angelic informant. And this is theanswer to Dante’s quandary. He had attempted to analyze the moonspots inphysical terms; Beatrice has just accounted for them in metaphysical ones(notably poetic though these are, comparing the relative brightness of/in aheavenly body to the relative brightness in a joyful eye, an ocular smile, as itwere).

[part0009.html#c03-s01-e] If many readers have responded to the previouscanto—for some the most labored and unwelcoming of the entire poem—with acertain impatience (e.g., if Paradiso is going to be like this, I’d prefer tospend my time in Inferno and/or Purgatorio), here they are placed on noticethat, for Dante, Beatrice’s instruction in spiritual astronomy is moreaesthetically pleasing than any possible worldly attraction. It is notable thateach of the verses of this tercet contains words or phrases that are oftenassociated with sensual or aesthetic pleasure (amor, scaldò il petto, bella,dolce), yet here conjoined with the language of Scholastic argumentation (seethe note to vv. 2–3, below). [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s01-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c03-s01-i]]1. [part0009.html#c03-s01-e] It is not surprising, given its Christianvalence, that Dante should have used the Sun as metaphoric equivalent forBeatrice (it is a nice touch that the professor in the matter pertaining to, inthe phrasing of St. Francis’s Laudes creaturarum, “Sister Moon” should be her“brother,” the Sun).This evident recollection of the first significant events recorded in the secondchapter of the Vita nuova, Beatrice’s appearance to the nearly nine-year-oldDante and his immediate innamoramento, sets the stage for the entrance of hisnewly reconstituted instructor and guide (“Bëatrice, dolce guida e cara!” [mysweet belovèd guide] of Par. XXIII.34) in the next twenty-eight cantos. She willillumine his intellect as she first stirred all his soul. (Or, as Benvenuto daImola puts it, “idest que primo amoravit cor meum carnaliter, deinde mentaliter”[that is, who first set my heart in carnal affection, then in intellectuallove]). It is not that she has changed in any way; what has changed is hisability to comprehend the deeper truths available from her. Such atransformation—from physical to intellectual love—has roots in Plato’s Phaedrus,surely unknown to Dante by direct encounter, but perhaps having some influenceon him and on others in his time (those who wrote of the ennobling potential ofcarnal love) at least from its diffusion through a lengthy and various tradition(see Joseph A. Mazzeo, “Dante and the Phaedrus Tradition of Poetic Inspiration,”in Mazz.1958.1). [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s01-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c03-s01-i]]2–3. [part0009.html#c03-s01-e] The development of the opening metaphor(Beatrice as Sun) has it that the light of his guide illumines the truth behindthe conundrum of the causes of the Moon’s dark spots as the light in a lover’seyes makes beautiful the face of his beloved. The poet is joining the two mainaspects of his Beatricean versifying, that based on appreciations of herphysical beauty and that dependent upon a spiritual understanding of a morelasting attraction. It is jarring, perhaps, but exhilarating to watch the “oldpoetry” being conjoined with the new, the rhymes of carnal love being forcedinto collaboration with the language of Scholastic discourse, “provando eriprovando” (by proof and refutation). The words clearly refer, in reverseorder, to Beatrice’s refutation of Dante’s erroneous ideas (Par. II.61–105) andto her truthful assertions (Par. II.112–117). [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s01-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s01-i]]4–9. [part0009.html#c03-s02-e] Dante presents himself as both rebuked andcorrected (the terms relate to provando and riprovando in verse 3) in this“confession.” His previous confession (Purg. XXXI.1–42) involved recanting hispast improper loves. That this scene marks the beginning, in Paradiso, of whathas been described as “the correction of Dante’s intellect” in a program thatbegan with the correction and perfection of his will (Inferno and most ofPurgatorio) seems likely. (See the note to Purg. XXVII.139–141.) This processwill carry through until St. Bernard appears and the program of the perfectionof Dante’s intellect is begun.Dante’s confession is once again impeded (see Purg. XXXI.7–9). This time,however, not through any failing on his part, but because his attention has beendrawn to higher things. (Further, Beatrice already knows his thoughts and soexpression of them is not necessary.) [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s02-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s02-i]]7. [part0009.html#c03-s03-e] What is the precise character of the sight(visïone) appearing to him? Is it a dream? Is it an experience of the noumenalworld in a Pauline face-to-face encounter? From the prose of the Vita nuovaonward, these have been the two kinds of “visions” that weave their way throughDante’s works. It would thus seem here that what he is seeing is actual, notdreamed; and it would further seem that, in seeing his first saved souls as theyare for eternity (if not yet with their bodies [see Par. XXV.127–129]), he isexperiencing a higher form of vision than he has previously known, gazing on thepresence of two heavenly souls in the very Moon, a collocation that causes, aswe shall see, considerable difficulty in a reader’s attempt to comprehend theground rules governing the appearances of the saved in the spheres of theheavens.

[part0009.html#c03-s04-e] As though to reward us for having had to dealwith his theologized poetry, Dante now engages us in a pleasing aesthetic moment(so often associated in the poem with similes, a mode offering Dante the verystuff of lyric expression). It is charged with the erotic energy ofthirteenth-century Italian and Provençal lyric. What is perhaps surprising isthe fact that this poet is able to bring that energy to bear here, in thehighest realm. At the same time, we should note the way in which he twice inthis canto invites us to carnal impressions of love only to warn us that theseare valuable only if they are markers of a higher form of affection. These linesand the earlier verses that also seem erotically charged (vv. 1–3) look forwardto the stories of two nuns who are delighted to renounce sexuality. They alsoglance back to Beatrice’s explanation of the moonspots. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s04-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s04-i]]17–18. [part0009.html#c03-s06-e] The “opposite error” into which Dante fallsresults from the fact that, where Narcissus looked into a mirroring surface ofwater and thought the beautiful visage he saw in it was that of someone else,Dante believes that the faces before him are reflections of those who are nowsuddenly present alongside him and Beatrice, not these actual new beingsthemselves. See Bernardino Daniello (comm. to these verses): “quelle faccie,ch’erano vere, gli paresser false, et a Narciso la falsa, vera pareva” (thosefaces, which were real, seemed to him to be false, while to Narcissus the falseseemed real).For the “Narcissus program” in the poem as a whole (Inf. XXX; Purg. XXX; Par.III, XXX, XXXIII), see the note to Inferno XXX.126–129 and articles by Brownlee(Brow.1978.1) and Shoaf (Shoa.1983.1), pp. 21–100.

[part0009.html#c03-s07-e] Dante, bending his eye on vacancy, allowsBeatrice the chance to get off a good schoolmarmish rebuke of her pupil, whoseactions mirror those of untutored humankind, unable to read the very facts ofhuman relations—for example, who is standing where; who is reflected, who isnot. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s07-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c03-s07-i]]25–28. [part0009.html#c03-s09-e] For Dante’s puerizia and subsequent“childish” behavior, see Purgatorio XXX.40–54. Francesco da Buti’s comment tothat passage (comm. to Purg. XXX.37–51) shares elements with his comment (to vv.19–33) on this one, which has it that from the ages of one through seven a maleis a child (fanciullo), while from eight through fourteen he is a boy (garzone).The commentator continues by saying that Beatrice means to associate herconfused pupil with the latter stage of development. In the garden of Eden hisfailings were portrayed as being based on affectional disorder; here, as isalways the case after his tasting of Lethe and Eunoe (and his moral coming ofage—belated though it may have been), it is his intellect that is behaving in ajuvenile manner. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s09-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c03-s09-i]]29–30. [part0009.html#c03-s10-e] Dante’s misprision has set up Beatrice’sexplanation, central to our understanding of the epistemology of the heavenlyspheres. All whom we meet here are the living souls of real people with realhistories (i.e., they are not part of some “symbolic” or otherwise less “real”manifestation) and a place in Heaven, that is, the Empyrean, not one of thelower spheres, where they manifest themselves to Dante only on the occasion ofhis Pauline visit to the heavens. It is this last detail to which particularattention must be paid, since later discussion in this canto might lead one tobelieve that the souls whom we meet in the Moon are indeed its permanentresidents. See vv. 49–50, 55–57, 64–66, 73–75, 88–90, 97, and 121–123 (anddiscussion in the accompanying notes). Virgil describes himself, in the onlyprevious (and only other) use of the verb in the poem (Purg. XXI.18), assituated in the Limbus, which “mi rilega nell’etterno essilio” (confines me ineternal exile), hardly envisioned as a temporary state. (The form “rilegollo”has, by common consent, a different meaning; at Inf. XXV.7, his blasphemous actof freedom required that Vanni Fucci be bound again.) But what exactly doesrilegare (or relegare, a form that shows up in some manuscripts) mean? Either“relegate” or “bind fast,” according to Andrea Mariani (“rilegare,” ED IV[1973], p. 929). And, as Simone Marchesi has suggested in conversation, whetherthe form that Dante used was “relegato” or “rilegato,” the word may refer to theRoman punishment of “relegation,” the lesser form (because it was notnecessarily permanent) of exile. This description would surely fit the conditionof Piccarda and Constance rather well.Beatrice’s words may easily be understood as verifying that the souls in theheaven of the Moon are indeed permanently here, as Francesco da Buti believed(comm. to vv. 19–33): “sono nell’ultimo grado di sotto (di Dio) in vita eterna”(they are on the last level farthest from God in the life eternal). As we movethrough the relevant passages, it will be clear that Dante is far from havingshut the door on such an explanation—but that is precisely what he will do inthe next canto (in Par. IV.28–39). In consequence, one would be excused forbelieving that Beatrice means that Piccarda, Constance, and other Moon-dwellersare rilegate (bound, or, as in our translation, “assigned”) here on a permanentbasis. See also the note to Paradiso IX.119–123. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s10-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s10-i]]31–33. [part0009.html#c03-s11-e] Having potentially undermined the authorityof the next speaker by pointing out that she was one who had broken her vows,Beatrice quickly restores it in these words that guarantee her ability to speakGod’s truth and nothing but that truth.

We expect it and find it, amply present, in Inferno (some twodozen occurrences) for the damned. It is surprising to find that its use toindicate the souls of the dead, now saved, increases in Purgatorio. While itappears there 49 times in all, it is present with this meaning 34 times. Here,in Paradise, to see the first saved soul whom we meet in this cantica referredto as a “shade” is disconcerting. The term that becomes normative in Paradiso isvita, generally translated “living soul” (IX.7; XII.127; XIV.6; XX.100; XXI.55;XXV.29). It is perhaps the association of those present in the first threeheavens with flawed activities (broken vows, ambition, and lust) that movedDante to begin his descriptions of the inhabitants of Paradise with the wordthat would surely seem to connect them with the damned; it is repeated at verse67, in the plural, to refer to all the souls found in the Moon. The souls whoappear in Mercury (Par. V.107) will be the next and the last heavenly presencesto be referred to as ombre. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s12-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c03-s12-i]]35–36. [part0009.html#c03-s12-e] The soul whom we meet will shortly (at verse49) be identified as Piccarda Donati. It seems clear from her eagerness to speakwith Dante that we are meant to understand that she has recognized him fromtheir days in Florence.Piccarda joins a select few, those personages who appear at the opening of theirrespective canticles as the first representative of sin and then of redemption:Celestine V (if it is indeed he, as seems nearly certainly to be the case) inInferno III, Manfred in the third canto of Purgatorio, and now Piccarda. Each ofthese figures is a surprise, and was surely meant to be one: a damned pope, asaved libertine and possible murderer, and a woman who, no matter how unwillingher subjection to the world, was certainly no St. Clare.The protagonist’s “muddled” condition results, in the opinion of Manfredi Porena(comm. to verse 36), from his excitement at being able, for the first time, tospeak with a soul who lives in Heaven.While it is impossible to tell from the text, it would seem that Piccarda,unlike Beatrice and heavenly souls we meet farther along, does not read Dante’smind, but needs to have a spoken question in order to respond (see vv. 91–96).Dante also voices questions to Justinian (Par. V.127–129), to Charles Martel(Par. VIII.44; 91–93), and to Cunizza (Par. IX.19–21). It is only when heencounters Folquet of Marseille (Par. IX.73–79) that he expects anyone otherthan Beatrice to read his thoughts. This is another detail setting those belowthe heaven of the Sun apart from the more exalted souls of Paradise, for Dantenever has to verbalize another question, although Cacciaguida wants to savor hisunnecessary voicing of one (see Par. XV.64–69). [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s12-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s12-i]]37. [part0009.html#c03-s13-e] Piccarda is a spirit who is “ben creato” (spiritmade for bliss), in sharp opposition to those in Hell referred to as being “malnati” (“ill-born souls” at Inf. XVIII.76; “born for sorrow” at Inf. XXX.48).[return to English [part0009.html#c03-s13-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c03-s13-i]]43–45. [part0009.html#c03-s15-e] While there is much that is personal in theinteraction between Dante and Piccarda, her first words show how “impersonal”the feelings of the saved are, both for one another and for this very specialvisitor. They are more than glad to welcome him, and his coming increases thelove they feel in general (see Par. V.105) by adding one more soul for them tolove. Nonetheless (with the major exception of Cacciaguida, whose familial tiesto the protagonist are much [some might say shamelessly] exploited), almost allof the exchanges between Dante and the blessed show that they are at apostpersonal level of development. If we keep in mind some of the great scenesof personal remembrance found in the first two cantiche (e.g., those presentingCiacco, Cavalcante, Brunetto, Casella, Belacqua, and Forese), the starkness ofthe contrast is evident.

[part0009.html#c03-s16-e] “Piccarda, daughter of Simone Donati, of thecelebrated Florentine family of that name, and sister of Corso and ForeseDonati. Piccarda was a connection by marriage of Dante, he having married Gemma,daughter of Manetto Donati.… The commentators state that Piccarda was forcedfrom her convent by her brother Corso, while he was Podestà of Bologna (i.e., in1283 or 1288), in order to marry her to a Florentine, Rossellino della Tosa, andthat she died soon after her marriage.…” (T). [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s16-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s16-i]]47–48. [part0009.html#c03-s16-e] It is a “post-Proustian” touch that here therecognition of things past is not tinged by the tragic sense of mortality, ofage that strips the loveliness from the human form, but rather is complicated bythe souls having become more beautiful, and almost unrecognizable for thatreason. We may remember what her brother Forese said of Piccarda: “I cannot saywhether my sister was more virtuous / than she was beautiful” (Purg.XXIV.13–14). In her new life she is more of both.For the absence of the perfected forms of the three Theological Virtues in thosewho display themselves in the subsolar planets (i.e., Moon, Mercury, and Venus),see Ordiway (Ordi.1982.1). But see Carroll, introduction to Paradiso and Proemto Canto X, for a much earlier version of this thesis. And see Andreoli (comm.to verse 16): “The fact is that it is only in the fourth heaven that we shallbegin to find souls that are completely without reproach.” Bosco/Reggio rightlypoint out (comm. to Par. XIV.68) that, beginning in the Sun, the souls whoappear take on definite shapes—circle, cross, eagle, ladder—thus furtherdistinguishing themselves from these who appear in the first three subsolarheavens. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s16-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c03-s16-i]]49–50. [part0009.html#c03-s17-e] Naming herself (and thus answering the firstof Dante’s questions), Piccarda for a second time speaks of her placement inthis heaven as though it might be permanent. See the other relevant passagesindicated in the note to vv. 29–30. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s17-e]/ Italian [part0020.html#c03-s17-i]]51. [part0009.html#c03-s17-e] The Moon is “the slowest of these spheres”because, in Dante’s astronomy, each successive heaven, of the nine revolvingaround the earth, is moving at a faster rate of speed. See the apparentlycontradictory notice (Par. XXVIII.22–39) in which the nine ranks of angels, eachassociated with one of the planetary spheres, rotating around the point thatrepresents the Godhead, rotate faster the nearer they are to that point. [returnto English [part0009.html#c03-s17-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s17-i]]52–54. [part0009.html#c03-s18-e] A difficult tercet because it is hard to becertain whether the piacere associated with the Holy Spirit is directed by thesouls toward the Spirit or by the Spirit toward the souls. We are in accord withthat branch of the tradition, a majority, represented by Francesco da Buti’sgloss (to vv. 46–57), in which the souls whom we see in the Moon “altrodesiderio non ànno, se non di piacere allo Spirito Santo dal quale procede lacarità” (have no other care except to be pleasing to the Holy Spirit, from whomholy love comes forth).For the nature of love represented by the earthly (and now heavenly) Piccarda,see Battaglia Ricci (Batt.1989.1), pp. 51–65, 68–70, pointing out that Dante isprobably relying on various expressions of mystical devotion, especially thosefound in the Epistola ad Severinum de caritate by one “frate Ivo.” [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c03-s18-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s18-i]]55–57. [part0009.html#c03-s19-e] The “lot” of these souls reflects theirearthly failings (as will also be true of those we meet in each of the next twoheavens), their failure to maintain the strict sense of their vows. While thisis a particularly monastic concern, since vows were a part of the requirementsfor entrance, as it were, and while the only beings we hear about here were infact nuns, the failing is probably not meant to be understood as being limitedto the clergy.On yet another occasion the phrasing at the very least admits the possibilitythat Piccarda’s “lot” (sorte) is permanently to be present in the Moon. Seediscussions indicated in the note to vv. 29–30. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s19-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s19-i]]58–63. [part0009.html#c03-s20-e] Once again the nature of heavenlytransfiguration is alluded to (see vv. 47–48). Only after he knows her story canDante begin to recognize the features of the earthly woman he once knew. Thateven this much “physicality” is possible is singular; Dante will not recognizeanyone else whom he once knew and whom he meets in the various heavens, notCharles Martel (Par. VIII), not his ancestor Cacciaguida (Par. XV). From this,we may choose to believe that only here, in the Moon, is there even theslightest amount of physical resemblance of a soul to its earlier mortal self.Dante, however, does not choose to raise (or answer) this question for us. Butsee Par. XXXI.46–48, where St. Bernard tells Dante that the heavenly infants arerecognizable as such. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s20-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c03-s20-i]]64–66. [part0009.html#c03-s22-e] It is clear that the protagonist believesthat Piccarda and the other souls with her are bound in the Moon for eternityunless the desire he attributes to them to be closer to God should one day beconsummated. This, of course, is the opinion of the protagonist and is notnecessarily shared by the poet. See the note to vv. 29–30. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s22-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s22-i]]67. [part0009.html#c03-s23-e] See the discussion of the use of the word ombra(shade) in Paradiso (in the note to verse 34). [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s23-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s23-i]]69. [part0009.html#c03-s23-e] The exact nature of the love displayed byPiccarda is a subject for disagreement among the commentators, some arguing thatthe phrase is to be understood as indicating the “first fire of love,” that is,the first enamorment of a young woman; others understand that the phrase ratherindicates the fire of divine love, that given expression through the HolySpirit. Those who hold to this second view find confirming evidence in thephrase found both at Inferno III.6 and Paradiso VI.11, “primal Love” (primoamor), referring to the love expressed in the Holy Spirit, forcing the phrase tobe understood (or translated) as “love in the First Fire,” that is, the HolySpirit. While this is surely a possible explanation, it does require a somewhatforced understanding of the verse. Would it be so strange for Piccarda, burningwith reciprocal affection for God’s love of her, to seem to Dante like a youngwoman just fallen in love? It is hard to see the harm in such a reading. See thesimilar views of Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 67–69). One might also be remindedof the distance between this scene and the one containing Dante’s recognition ofthe love felt for him by Matelda (Purg. XXVIII.43–51). In that passage Danteimagines that Matelda is amorously disposed toward him in the normal mortal way;there he is incorrect. Here he is fully aware of the kind of love that motivatesPiccarda, but sees it in terms reminiscent of our mortal sort of loving. [returnto English [part0009.html#c03-s23-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s23-i]]70–84. [part0009.html#c03-s24-e] The bulk of Piccarda’s answer to Dante’squestion (vv. 64–66) begins with the word frate (brother), the word that wasnearly absent from Hell (eleven uses, predominantly to indicate a member of areligious order [nomenclature that the Infernal context makes obviously suspectat once], and only once to express human fraternity [by Ulysses, addressing hisshipmates, at Inf. XXVI.112—with, according to some readers, an unmistakablewhiff of Julius Caesar’s fulsome address to his soldiers, captatio benevolentiaeon all fours, as it were]). It frequently appeared as a term of address inPurgatorio (thirteen times). Now, in the heavens, it appears less frequently asa term of address, first here, and then a total of four other times. In a senseit contains a central message of Piccarda’s speech in that it insists on therelationship that binds all saved Christians in their fellowship in God, a sensethat overcomes the inevitable hierarchical distinctions found among them in thislife. The love that governs their will is nothing less than charity, with theresult that it is impossible for them to want advantage over their brothers andsisters in grace. To wish things other than they are, to desire one’s own“advancement,” is nothing less than to oppose the will of God. And thus allmembers of this community observe the gradations among themselves, but find inthem the expression of their general and personal happiness.Verses 80–85 return to forms for the word volontà (will), which opened (at verse70) Piccarda’s concluding discourse as its main subject, five times (voglia,voglie, voler, ’nvoglia, volontade), underlining the importance of the will’sdirection of human love to divine ends. The celestial form of will inbrotherhood is vastly different from the will that destroys fraternity here onearth. But it is as natural in the realms of Paradise as it is absent from Hell(and rarely enough found on earth). [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s24-e]/ Italian [part0020.html#c03-s24-i]]73–75. [part0009.html#c03-s25-e] At first reading, a certain indeterminacyseems possible. Does Piccarda mean “higher in the heavens” or “higher in theRose”? Since the concluding words of the tercet, “that which assigns us to thisplace,” seem to refer to the sphere of the Moon, it is difficult to concludethat she means other than in a higher heaven. See, again, the note to vv. 29–30.[return to English [part0009.html#c03-s25-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c03-s25-i]]79. [part0009.html#c03-s27-e] Our translation reflects Weatherby’s discussion(Weat.1975.1), p. 24, of the Scholastic nature of the term forma. Thus ourchoice of “essence” (in the sense of “formative principle”). [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s27-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s27-i]]85. [part0009.html#c03-s29-e] Piccarda’s last tercet makes her point with twodiffering linguistic gestures, this first a summarizing citation, the second apowerful metaphor. Exactly which text she is citing is a matter forconsideration, but a list of suggested candidates includes Luke 2:14 (“Et interra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis” [And on earth peace to men of good will]);Ephesians 2:15 (“Ipse enim est pax noster” [For he (Christ Jesus) is ourpeace]); and Augustine’s Confessions XIII.9 (“In bona voluntate pax nobis est”[Our peace lies in willing the good]). The greater closeness of the last (“E ’nla la sua voluntade è nostra pace” [And in His will we find our peace]) makes itthe most likely to have been on Dante’s mind as he created his Piccarda.(Grandgent [comm. to this verse], followed by Singleton, in his commentary tothis line, cites the passage from Ephesians. John Sinclair [Sinc.1946.1], p. 59,cites the passage from Augustine.) Readers of these notes may remark upon theparallel then found between Francesca and Piccarda, each quoting a crucial textof St. Augustine as the climactic gesture of her speech; see Inferno V.138 andthe note thereto. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s29-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c03-s29-i]]86–87. [part0009.html#c03-s29-e] Piccarda’s metaphor for the totality of thepeace found in God reverses our normal sense of the proclivity of bodies todescend or to ascend (a phenomenon that is almost the trademark of Paradiso,beginning with Beatrice’s explanation that it here is as natural to be drawn uptoward God as on earth to be drawn down by gravity; see Par. I.136–141). InParadiso I.113, Beatrice has used the phrase “lo gran mar de l’essere” (thevastness of the sea of being) to refer to all of God’s creation, both here andabove. Now Piccarda redeploys this metaphor to apply it only to God Himself,seen as the ocean to which all creation, whether direct or indirect, flows up.While many commentators, moved by Piccarda, think of Francesca da Rimini, onlySingleton (comm. to these verses) adverts to Francesca’s very words (Inf.V.98–99) as being remembered here. Both ladies use watery metaphors to expressthe peace that they either long for or enjoy. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s29-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s29-i]]88–90. [part0009.html#c03-s30-e] Piccarda’s words have finally made it plainto Dante how one can be nearer or closer to God in Heaven and yet feel equallyblessed with all who share beatitude, disregarding the matter of relative rank.Once again the phrasing, now representing not so much the response of theprotagonist (see vv. 64–66) as the understanding of the poet, raises thequestion that is necessarily so persistent for a reader of this canto: Doreferences to paradisal “placement” speak of the ranked order of the saved inthe Rose in the Empyrean or of their presences in the celestial spheres? Once wearrive in the Rose (Par. XXXII), we will see that there is a ranking (by one’srow in the Rose bowl); on the other hand, there does not seem to be much in theway of ranking going on within each sphere (there may be some in Jupiter), ifthe spheres themselves are ranked, progressing from lowest to most exalted.Again, see the note to vv. 29–30. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s30-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c03-s30-i]]91–96. [part0009.html#c03-s31-e] The second simile of the canto (see vv. 10–18for the first) is an elaborate way of describing the protagonist’s reminder tohis colloquist that she had not fully answered his second question (verse 41),the one dealing with her and her companions’ “lot” in the afterworld. As isfrequent in the post-Convivial Paradiso, the material for the simile proper isdrawn from alimentation. In a real sense, as Robin McCallister suggested in apaper in 1968, for Dante the Paradiso offered him the opportunity to completethe Convivio, now in better, more “orthodox,” form. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s31-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s31-i]]95–96. [part0009.html#c03-s32-e] The as yet unexpressed portion of Piccarda’sself-explanation is, in metaphor, compared to the unfinished portion of a wovenfabric, an image that undoubtedly reflects the Florence of Dante’s day, in theheart of which the wool merchants plied their trade. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s32-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s32-i]]97–99. [part0009.html#c03-s33-e] Piccarda is referring to the companion andfellow citizen of St. Francis of Assisi, founder (in collaboration with Francis)of her own order in 1212, the Clarisse, St. Clare (1194–1253). “[S]he wascanonized by [Pope] Alexander IV in 1255. The rule of her order, which wasconfirmed in 1247, and again in 1253, two days before her death, by PopeInnocent IV, was characterized by extreme austerity” (T).As Lauren Scancarelli Seem suggested in conversation many years ago, Piccarda’sreference to St. Clare, as being loftier than she, parallels, in opposition,Francesca’s reference to her husband, Gianciotto, as being fated to a placelower in Hell than she (see Inf. V.107). And see the note to PurgatorioXXIV.13–15 for another set of “family resemblances.”The resemblances and differences among the first three women in the threecantiche (Francesca in Inf. V, Pia de’ Tolomei in Purg. V, and Piccarda) haveoffered occasion for frequent comment. See Stefanini (Stef.1992.1), pp. 26–31,for a study of structural similarities in these three narratives.

[part0009.html#c03-s33-e] Dante’s coinage, inciela (inheavens, “set[s] ina higher sphere”), again raises the issue of whether he refers to the Empyrean(in which Clare [whom we do not see there] is seated higher in the Rose thanPiccarda) or to yet another heavenly sphere (e.g., that of the Sun, where welearn of St. Francis in Canto XI). It is very difficult to be certain, despiteBosco/Reggio’s assurances that all is under control (see their note to vv.28–30). The second alternative, however, does seem more likely (i.e., St. Clare,in Piccarda’s view [the poet’s also?], is in the Sun [or perhaps in Saturn]).Once more, see the note to vv. 29–30. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s33-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s33-i]]100–102. [part0009.html#c03-s34-e] Piccarda’s language recollects variousbiblical passages equating the love of God with marriage to Christ. Compare theSong of Solomon, passim, as read by Christian interpreters; Matthew 9:15 and25:1–12; Mark 2:19; and Luke 5:34, but in particular the parable of the wise andfoolish virgins in Matthew 25. [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s34-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c03-s34-i]]106–108. [part0009.html#c03-s36-e] This celebrated tercet condenses a momentof horror followed by a life of despondency into a single unit of verse. As forthe events to which Piccarda refers, the most frequent understanding among thecommentators is that her brother Corso wanted to marry her off to one Rossellinodella Tosa in order to further his political/financial ambition and, for thisreason, had her abducted from her convent. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s36-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s36-i]]109–120. [part0009.html#c03-s37-e] Constance of Sicily is the only companionmentioned by Piccarda (and one wonders, here and elsewhere, why, if the soulsappear in the spheres only for the instruction of visiting Dante, they alwaysseem to be accompanied by crowds of anonymous others, who are thus temporarilydeprived of the joys of the Empyrean).Bosco/Reggio offer a succinct account of the significant facts about her as theywere known to Dante (in their comment to verse 118): “Constance, daughter ofRoger II, king of Sicily, born in 1154, last heir of the Norman kingdom ofNaples and Sicily, in 1185 married Henry VI of Swabia, son of FrederickBarbarossa. By marrying her, the emperor was finally obtaining dominion oversouthern Italy, which he had in vain attempted to conquer by force of arms. In1194 Frederick II was born of this marriage. Constance, widowed in 1197, untilher death in 1198 knew how to govern the kingdom with a shrewd sort of wisdom.With sure political instinct, sensing that she was near death, she named PopeInnocent III guardian of her three-year-old son, Frederick. During the time thatthe latter was emperor, the Guelphs spread the story that Constance had beenmade a nun against her will and that, at the age of 52, taken from the conventby the archbishop of Palermo, she had been joined in matrimony to Henry VI.Frederick II, the ‘Antichrist,’ would then have been born to an ex-nun who wasat the same time a woman of a certain age, and thus opposing the precepts ofevery law, whether human or divine. In this way did Guelph propaganda attempt todiscredit the emperor. Constance, in fact, had never been a nun and had marriedHenry at the age of 31. Dante accepted the story that she had become a nun, butomitted any negative elements from it, thus being able to illumine the figure ofthe empress in a lofty poetic light, making her the innocent victim of politicalmachinations and violent acts. The halo of light that surrounds her, therefulgence in her of all of the light of this heaven, the attributes accordedher, all these tell us of Dante’s high esteem for the ‘Great Norman,’ with thenegative elements of Guelph propaganda transformed into a luminous attestationof the poet’s reverence.”Piccarda’s remarks at vv. 112–117 will puzzle Dante in the next canto (Par.IV.19–21). [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s37-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c03-s37-i]]109. [part0009.html#c03-s37-e] This is the first time the word “splendor”(splendore) is used to describe the appearance of a soul in Paradiso (but seealso at least V.103; IX.13; XI.39; XIV.95; XXI.32; XXIII.82; XXV.106; XXIX.138).In the heaven of the Sun we learn that the souls are enclosed in their own light(e.g., Par. XIII.48), thus explaining why we would not be able to recognize themeven had we previously known them—as well as why Dante can recognize thefeatures of Piccarda; that is, she still possesses features, if they are butfaint. Thus for Constance to be treated in this way, as though she wereappearing in a higher heaven, tells us a good deal about Dante’s admiration forher.

[part0009.html#c03-s40-e] Her name, Constance, plays with and against herformer weakness, inconstancy, in that, if she was inconstant in her vows whenforced (as she was at least in Dante’s sense of her life) back into the world,she was also constant in her heart (see verse 117). It is also interesting thatthere are reports that the name assumed by Piccarda, in the convent of theClarisse, was Constance (see Lombardi’s commentaries [1791] to Purg XXIV.10 andPar. III.49). In Purgatorio (III.113), Constance is remembered with greataffection by her grandson, Manfred (like his grandmother in this, not mentioningthe name of the magnificent but hated “last of the Roman emperors,” Frederick II[Conv. IV.iii.6]). As was suggested in the note to Purgatorio III.143, thatcanto is also a “canto of two Constances.” [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s40-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s40-i]]120. [part0009.html#c03-s40-e] Frederick is referred to as the third powerfulfigure in the line of Frederick Barbarossa and Henry VI, the three Swabianemperors. See Grandgent (comm. to verse 119): “The Swabian Emperors are called‘blasts’ because of the violence and the brief duration of their activity.Frederick I (Barbarossa) was the first; the ‘second wind’ was Constance’shusband, Henry VI; the third and last was her son, Frederick II.” [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c03-s40-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s40-i]]121–123. [part0009.html#c03-s41-e] Where do these two Constances go after theyrecede from view? Opinions are divided, some more recent commentators (beginningwith Costa in 1819 [comm. to verse 122]) claiming that they head back to theEmpyrean (as will, apparently, many souls encountered later in the cantica);others are of the opinion that they go deep into the mass of the Moon (e.g.,Benvenuto [comm. to vv. 115–123]: “disparuit in corpore lunae frigido”[disappeared into the cold matter of the Moon]). This is also maintained byFrancesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 121–130): “profondò nel corpo lunare” (sank deepinto the matter of the Moon). Most, however, do not even raise the question ofwhere Piccarda (not to mention Constance or, indeed, any of their companions) isheaded.This is the last passage in the canto that makes the reader confront the problemof the permanent residence of the souls we see in the Moon (see the note to vv.29–30). Here, the sense of descent would seem to make the second hypothesis morelikely. The fact that, among the early commentators, only Benvenuto andFrancesco da Buti tried to assign a destination to their departure makes theproblematic nature of the passage apparent. In the later nineteenth century,Scartazzini (comm. to verse 123) and Campi (comm. to this tercet) also draw theconclusion that Costa did, basing it on what the next canto (vv. 28–39) willmake clear: The souls are all in the Empyrean and descend from there to manifestthemselves in the planets (or so Dante called both Moon and Sun along with thoseto which we reserve that appellation). However, twentieth-century exegetespreferred to admire the aesthetic attractiveness of the passage rather thanapply themselves to this little conundrum. The result is that there is no“official” view of the problem, which remains unsolved. Dante should have shownPiccarda and the others going up, returning to God; he did not, and we haveeither, like Scartazzini, tried to be more correct than our author or, likeBenvenuto, followed our poetic sense to make Dante seem to violate his ownrules—at least the rules that he would lay down in the next canto. There is,according to an Italian proverb, always a third way (“C’è sempre una terzavia”). In this case, that has proven more popular than the first two, the way ofavoidance, whether knowingly chosen or not. [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s41-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s41-i]]121–122. [part0009.html#c03-s41-e] For the program of song in the lastcantica, see the note to Paradiso XXI.58–60.

[part0009.html#c03-s42-e] In the wake of the disappearance of the twonuns, the poet prepares us for the answers to the questions to which they havegiven rise. These lines could, without disrupting the reader’s sense of order,have been moved forward into the next canto. As we have seen (since at leastInferno VIII, which opens with the often-noted self-consciousness of the words“Io dico, seguitando …” [To continue, let me say … ]), the reader experiences asense that there was a kind of willful and arbitrary process at work in thepoet’s decisions about how a given canto should begin (or end). That Dante wasincreasingly amused by this practical poetic problem is evidenced in the growingnumber of ungainly narrative restarts as we move into Purgatorio. Danteobviously enjoyed playfully challenging our sense of proper beginnings andendings.Battaglia Ricci (Batt.1989.1), p. 29, cites with approval Marti’s argument(Mart.1964.1), p. 1385, for the circular movement of the canto, from Beatrice asSun to Beatrice as Sun. (Dante is in the first case rewarded with anunderstanding of the dark places in the Moon; in the second he is promised ananswer [if in rather disquieting terms] to the two questions that his interviewwith Piccarda has given rise to in him. Marti characterizes the first Beatriceas the “sun of love” and the second as the “sun of knowledge.”) [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c03-s42-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c03-s42-i]]PARADISO IV [part0010.html#c04-e]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1–9. [part0010.html#c04-s01-e] This three-part opening simile is not so muchdifficult as it is puzzling. The residue of the confusion resulting from what hehas seen and heard in the previous canto, it prepares the ground for theprotagonist’s two-pronged question for Beatrice about human liability. (1) Howcan a person not be guilty of a sin who wills to live the good life but somehowcomes up short of doing so? (2) Where will this kind of saved soul be located inthe afterlife? While readers are probably eventually able to make sense of therelationship between the tenor and the vehicle(s) of the simile, not a fewnonetheless wonder about Dante’s practice here. To deal with the tenor first,the prose sense of what is at stake is simple. The protagonist is so eager tohave answers to both of his questions (and so afraid of what the answers mightbe) that he simply cannot decide which one to ask first and, instead ofspeaking, he is silent (vv. 7–9). As for the vehicles, to some only the firstseems necessary, while the second may initially seem otiose, and the thirdredundant, since it only seems to repeat the substance of the first. [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c04-s01-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s01-i]]1–3. [part0010.html#c04-s01-e] Bruno Nardi (Nard.1944.1), pp. 301–3, hasargued that the widespread notion that these lines are a recasting of Buridan’sfamed paradox (starving donkey between two equally distant piles of straw)should be rejected. As Nardi and others have shown, the more certain source liesin the Summa theologica (I–II, q. 13, a. 6): “If any two things are absolutelyequal, a man is not moved to the one more than to the other; just as a starvingman, if he has food equally appetizing in different directions and at an equaldistance, is not moved to the one more than to the other” (English text as foundin Carroll’s commentary to Par. IV.1–9). Further, and as Fallani (in his comm.to these verses) points out, Buridan’s ass was posterior to Dante’s Paradiso.Beginning with Lombardi (comm. to this tercet), and continuing into thetwentieth century, one finds insistence on Thomas as source, neglectingAristotle, for example, Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet); Andreoli (comm. to thistercet); Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 1–2); Poletto (comm. to vv. 1–6); Carroll(comm. to vv. 1–9), etc. The first commentators to put the two together, as isin our day fairly commonplace, were apparently Tozer in 1901 and Torraca in1905, both in response to this tercet. However, if one reads farther in Thomas’spassage, it is striking, as Sapegno points out (comm. to vv. 1–9), citing Nardi(Nard.1944.1), pp. 297–303, that Thomas has proposed this paradox only to refuteits relationship to practical reality—as might any sensible person. Zeno’s arrowand Buridan’s ass (and Thomas’s starving man, as Thomas himself insists) are thesorts of logically developed paradoxes that “philosophers” enjoy creating andthat poets generally enjoy mocking. Here Thomas, Dante’s “philosopher,” rejectsphilosophical nonsense while Dante, our poet, seems to sponsor it. [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c04-s01-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s01-i]]4–5. [part0010.html#c04-s02-e] The second vehicle of the simile seems, fromwhat one may find in the commentary tradition, not to have a discernible sourceanywhere. If that is true, what we have here is pure Dantean invention, apost-Scholastic paradox added to Thomas’s. Whereas in the first tercet Dante thequestioner is likened to a hungry man unable to decide between two equallytempting foods (so long a time that he will, undirected by external agency,die), in these two lines he becomes the potential victim of his lupinequestions, unable to decide which one to run from, since each looks equallyfierce. While this part of the extended comparison surely seems askew, given thefact that Dante must choose which question to ask rather than which to avoid,the passage does impart something that will later be brought back into play (atverse 27): These questions are potentially destructive, and thus like (or atleast not unlike) ravening wolves. And so, after initial puzzlement, a readermust admit that the apparently otiose comparison does pay its passage in thegreater scheme. Angiolillo (Angi.1986.1) complains about the “incongruity” ofthis comparison, since it portrays immobility, not indecision; passivity, notaggression. But this is to miss Dante’s point: Solutions of his two doubts seemequally attractive and, potentially at least, the concerns that give rise toeach of them are equally destructive. For a hypothesis relating to Dante’s ownbroken vow, which may account for the poet’s “overkill” in this simile, offeringa sense of what makes the questions both attractive and dangerous, see thesecond paragraph of the note to vv. 139–142. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s02-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s02-i]]6. [part0010.html#c04-s02-e] While in the actual world two deer are capable ofaccomplishing more damage to a single dog than Dante’s text allows, it is clearthat the third vehicle of the simile displays exactly the same relationship asthe first: hungry Dante between two equally tempting viands. Here somecommentators do suggest a source (see Bosco/Reggio on this verse: Ovid [Metam.V.164–167], first suggested by Pietro di Dante and then by Daniello, and/orpossibly, if Mattalia is correct, Virgil [Georg. III.539–540], as was firstsuggested by the author of the Codice Cassinese). Angiolillo (Angi.1986.1)proposes the passage from Ovid, and then adds another from Seneca’s dramaThyestes, 707–711. Whatever the source, what seems puzzling is the fact that ourusually orderly and rigorous poet (or so we like to conceive him) here seems tohave allowed himself an unnecessary repetition. It seems fair to say that, whiledetractors of the poet’s inclusion of the second piece of business (see the noteto vv. 4–5) have failed to take the point behind it, the several expressions ofdiscomfort with the third part of the simile have not had sufficient response.However, experience teaches that Dante knows his business far better than we; ifwe fail to fathom his purposes, that does not necessarily require that he waswithout them. A possible solution is to suggest that the three-part similemirrors the process of the protagonist’s actual inner thoughts, moving fromphilosophical eagerness to fearful worry and then back to the first eagerness.[return to English [part0010.html#c04-s02-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s02-i]]13–15. [part0010.html#c04-s05-e] The simile puts into parallel Beatrice(placating Dante’s anxiety) and Daniel (stilling Nebuchadnezzar’s wrath). Itthus also necessarily puts into parallel Dante and Nebuchadnezzar, a relationthat at first seems to make no sense at all. The poet has already visited thistext in the Bible (the second book of the prophet Daniel), the king’s dream andthe prophet’s interpretation of it (see Inf. XIV.94–111 for Dante’s version ofthat dream, embodied in the representation of the veglio di Creta). Here hefastens on its perhaps strangest aspect: the new king’s desire to kill all thewise men in his kingdom of Babylon who could neither bring his forgotten dreamback to mind nor then interpret it—about as unseemly a royal prerogative asanyone has ever sought to enjoy. Thus it seems natural to wonder in what way(s)Dante may possibly be conceived of as resembling the wrathful king of Babylon.The entire commentary tradition observes only a single link: Nebuchadnezzar’sdispleasure and Dante’s puzzlement are both finally relieved by (divinelyinspired—see Trucchi on these verses) external intervention on the part ofDaniel, in the first case, of Beatrice in the second. Why should Dante have casthimself as the tyrannical Babylonian ruler? That is a question that has stirredonly the shorelines of the ponds of commentaries and has never had an answer. Ifone looks in the Epistle to Cangrande (77–82), however, one finds a gloss toParadiso I.4–9 that is germane here. And apparently, in any discussion of thispassage, only G. R. Sarolli, in his entry “Nabuccodonosor” (ED IV [1973]), hasnoted the striking similarity in the two texts, going on to argue that thissimilarity serves as a further proof of the authenticity of the epistle. In thatpassage Dante explains that his forgetting of his experience of the Empyrean(because he was lifted beyond normal human experience and could not retain hisvision) has some egregious precursors: St. Paul, three of Jesus’ disciples,Ezechiel (their visionary capacity certified by the testimony of Richard of St.Victor, St. Bernard, and St. Augustine); and then he turns to his ownunworthiness to be included in such company (if not hesitating to insist that hehad been the recipient of such exalted vision): “But if on account of thesinfulness of the speaker [Dante himself, we want to remember] they should cryout against his claim to have reached such a height of exaltation, let them readDaniel, where they will find that even Nebuchadnezzar by divine permissionbeheld certain things as a warning to sinners, and straightway forgot them”(81—tr. P. Toynbee). Dante, like the Babylonian king, has had a vision that wasGod-given, only to forget it. And now he is, Nebuchadnezzar-like, distraught;Beatrice, like the Hebrew prophet, restores his calm. Thus the typologicalequation here is not idle; Dante is the new Nebuchadnezzar in that both he andthe wrathful king, far from being holy men (indeed both were sinners), hadaccess to visionary experience of God, only to forget their vision. The kingenters this perhaps unusual history, that of forgetting a divine revelation onthe part of those who were less than morally worthy, as “the first forgettor”;Dante, as the second (see Hollander [Holl.2005.1]). [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s05-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s05-i]]16–18. [part0010.html#c04-s06-e] We are now reminded that all the fuss (vv.1–12) over Dante’s paralyzed will, rendering him unable to choose which questionto ask, was eventually in vain, since Beatrice can read his thoughts in Godanyway. The poem, of course, needs to hold our attention and thus make Dante’schoices important, even when they are technically unnecessary. His development,as sinner gradually being made worthy of the visionary experience of God andthus of salvation itself, is the major strand of the narrative of the cantica.And thus the poet may at times allow himself a certain latitude with the rulesof his own game, making his work the richer for it. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s06-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s06-i]]19–27. [part0010.html#c04-s07-e] Beatrice addresses the nature of Dante’squestions. The first concerns the apparent fact that even a person who neverceases willing the good, and who ceases doing good only by virtue of the forceof others, is in some way responsible for that failure. The second, zeroing inon a problem that we frequently encountered throughout the previous canto (seethe note to Par. III.29–30), concerns the ultimate abode of the blessed: whetheror not they return to dwell forever in the stars that most shaped theirpersonalities. This is the more pernicious of these two dangerous questions andwill thus be addressed first, if at lesser length, vv. 28–63 (Beatrice’s answerto the first question will be found at vv. 64–114). [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s07-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s07-i]]19–21. [part0010.html#c04-s07-e] Beatrice makes the need to deal with Dante’sfirst question seem even more pressing by revealing that for him it has apersonal interest: It is he who wonders if his own merit might be diminishedthrough no fault of his own. [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s07-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c04-s07-i]]24. [part0010.html#c04-s08-e] Beatrice refers to Plato’s teaching as it isfound in his Timaeus. See the note to vv. 49–54. Torraca, in his comment to thisverse, the phrase “secondo la sententia di Platone,” cites Thomas’s Summa contragentiles (II.83), “secundum Platonis sententiam.” Bosco/Reggio posit thepossibility that, if Dante did not know the text of the Timaeus directly, hemight have been acquainted with key portions of it through St. Augustine, St.Thomas, Albertus Magnus, Cicero, or Macrobius. This is the position, assumedtentatively, by most students of the question; some, however, take it that Dantedid have direct knowledge of at least this one Platonic text. For Dante’sknowledge of Plato in general and the Timaeus in particular, see Edward Moore(Moor.1896.1), pp. 156–64. The great British Dantist makes a sound case forDante’s direct acquaintance with Chalcidius’s text of the Timaeus (41 D and E,42 B, p. 157) in the relevant passages of this canto and Convivio IV.xxi.2 andII.xiii.5, although on one occasion he admits to a reasonable doubt in thatrespect, offering a near disclaimer in the clause “in whatever form it found itsway to Dante” (p. 160). Margherita de Bonfils Templer (Debo.1987.1), building onher previous investigations (see p. 90, n. 5 for these), makes her case forDante’s use of the glosses to the Timaeus of Guillaume de Conches. And see herstudy of Platonic gnoseology in Convivio (Debo.1987.2). More recently, seeGiuliana Carugati’s investigation (Caru.1994.1) of Dante’s reliance on Proclusin Convivio II and III. For a view counseling caution in attributing directknowledge of the Timaeus to Dante, who refers to the work by name only once inConvivio (III.v.6) and then here, see Marta Cristiani, “Timeo,” ED V (1976), pp.604–5. See also her entries “Platone,” ED IV (1973), pp. 546–50, and“platonismo,” ED IV (1973), pp. 550–55. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s08-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s08-i]]25–27. [part0010.html#c04-s09-e] Both of the protagonist’s questions reflect adangerous uncertainty on his part about the nature of free will, which will bethe subject of Beatrice’s urgent lecture at the beginning of the next canto. Ifhe believes that compromise in making vows is possible or that our souls’choices are controlled by the stars that govern our natures, he is in heresy.The second doubt, since it would destroy the notion of free will utterly (andnot just partially), is the more dangerous, which is why Beatrice chooses toaddress it first. As Trucchi, discussing this tercet, points out, Plato’s notionthat souls return to their formative stars, embraced by some early Christians,was finally condemned at the Council of Constantinople in the year 540. [returnto English [part0010.html#c04-s09-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s09-i]]25. [part0010.html#c04-s09-e] Dante’s use of the Latin infinitive as a noun isnot without precedent in the work: See Paradiso III.79, esse (to be [assubstantive, “being”]); Paradiso XIX.2, frui; and, more interestingly in thiscontext, Paradiso XXXIII.143, where velle (to will [as substantive, “the will”])itself reappears, once again rhyming with stelle (stars). That only otherrecurrence of this Latin word may be more programmatic than has been noticed.Plato’s apparent doctrine, rejected here, receives a final disapproving glancein the last lines of the poem, in which Dante has his final vision of theuniverse as it truly is, and not as Plato’s Timaeus (and Dante’s Convivio[IV.xxi.2]: “Plato and others maintained that they issued from the stars andwere more or less noble according to the nobility of their star”—tr. Lansing;and see also Conv. II.xiii.5) might have us believe.There are some seventy-five Latin words or passages incorporated in thisinsistently vernacular work, more than half of them in its most “churchly”cantica, Purgatorio, as is not surprising. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s09-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s09-i]]28–39. [part0010.html#c04-s10-e] Beatrice’s refutation is in three main parts:(1) Scriptural justification for God’s showing saved souls in the stars, vv.28–39.(1a) why such ways of presenting divine truth are necessary, vv. 40–48.(2) Plato’s possible error in the Timaeus, vv. 49–54.(3) Plato’s potential agreement with Christian doctrine, vv. 55–63.The first part refutes not only what Dante has shown himself to believe in theprevious canto, namely that the souls in the Moon are there permanently (see thenote to Par. III.29–30), but resolves what Piccarda and even Beatrice (dependingon how one reads verse 30 of Par. III) had left an open question. Now we aretold by Beatrice, definitively, that no soul of Paradise is present in any star,except for the occasion of Dante’s visit to the spheres. Thus if, while readingthe ending of the last canto, we may (quite reasonably) have thought thatPiccarda and Constance were heading back into the matter of the Moon, we nowprobably have to understand that they have returned to their home in theEmpyrean. [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s10-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s10-i]]28. [part0010.html#c04-s10-e] Indicating only the highest rank of angels, theSeraphim, Beatrice reminds Dante that all the nine ranks of angels are in theEmpyrean and are the beings closest to God. Here the poet resolves a potentialproblem, similar to that caused by the appearance of the souls in the spheres,in that readers might eventually assume that the angelic order most associatedwith a certain heaven actually dwells in that heaven. This verse cancels thatpotential reading before it can be applied. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s10-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s10-i]]29–30. [part0010.html#c04-s10-e] Moses, Samuel, John the Baptist, John theEvangelist, and Mary are all to be found in that same placeless place known asthe Empyrean. When we read Paradiso XXXII, we will find all of these but Samuelrepresented as having been seen by the protagonist among the eighteen soulsactually pointed out there by St. Bernard. Beatrice’s little list is“ecumenical,” involving two Hebrews (Moses and Samuel in the role of the firstand last “great jurists” of Israel, as it were), one “Hebrew-Christian” (theBaptist), and two Christians (John and Mary). Since all four whom we doeventually see in the Rose are in its highest tier, we may assume that Samuel isat that level also. (Why Dante has chosen Samuel, rather than Abraham, Solomon,David, or still another, is not immediately clear; see the discussion in thenote to verse 29.) It would also seem likely that Dante is paralleling elementsin his angelic and human populations of the Rose, referring only to the highestrank of each, thus distinguished from all who are at lower levels. [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c04-s10-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s10-i]]29. [part0010.html#c04-s10-e] The meaning of Beatrice’s remark is notdifficult to grasp. The angels (she refers to the highest order, the Seraphim,but from the context we know that she means all nine orders) and all the blessedare found, and found only, in the Empyrean. From Par. XXXII we know that four ofthe five saints referred to here are in the highest rank of the stadium-rose:Moses (vv. 131–132), John the Baptist (vv. 31–33), John the Evangelist (vv.127–128), Mary (vv. 88–93). Samuel is not among the eighteen saints referred toin that canto, but since all four who have been, like their Seraphiccounterparts, elevated to the topmost rank, we are probably meant to understandthat Samuel has been also; that is, we are to understand that he is there, evenif we do not see him.But why Dante singles him out here (and why he passes him over in silence inPar. XXXII) are questions rarely formed and perhaps never answered. Tommaseo(comm. to vv. 28–30) was perhaps the first to refer to the fact that Moses andSamuel were referred to only once in the same passage of Scripture, Jeremiah15:1: “Then said the Lord unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yetmy mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let themgo forth.” G. R. Sarolli, “Samuele,” ED IV (1973), does improve upon therelatively sorry record of the commentators, who just do not seem to realizethat this sudden appearance of Samuel in the poem calls for study. Why, forinstance, if Dante wants to pick a pair of Old Testament “heroes,” does he notcouple Moses with his favorite Hebrew figure, David? Perhaps, since Samuel wasthe last of the Judges of Israel, in Dante’s mind he balances the first Hebrew“law-giver,” Moses (see Inf. IV.57). Sarolli points to Samuel’s position amongthe exegetes as typus Christi as well as a figure of John the Baptist and to hisrole in transferring the kingly power from Saul to David as clues to Dante’sreasons for his lofty placement in the Commedia. (But why, we wonder, was notthat lofty placement confirmed, as it was for his four fellow nominees, in Par.XXXII?) Toynbee had already made the point that the rest of Dante’s referencesto Samuel by name (Mon. II.vii.8; III.vi.1–6; Epist. VII.19) have to do withSamuel’s intervention that resulted in the termination of Saul’s kingship. (Thislast passage is a casuistic argument, in which Dante insists that Samuel had thepower to depose Saul not because he was God’s vicar, which the hierocratsinsisted was indeed true [thus buttressing their case for papal intervention inimperial affairs], but because God selected him as an “angelic” messenger, Hisdirect emissary.) Such is dramatically true of Dante’s second epistle to HenryVII (Epist. VII.19), in which he compares Henry to Saul, about to be dethronedby Samuel (I Samuel 15), and in which his accusations put Dante unmistakably inSamuel’s place. If the order of composition of these Samuel-Saul passages isEpistle VII (late 1311), Paradiso IV, Monarchia II and III, the last threelikely written within only a few months of one another in circa 1314, we maybegin to have an inkling of why Samuel, so long absent from Dante’s pages,should suddenly have sprung to life in them. Henry’s foundering kingship showsthe need for a new Samuel to hector the struggling king, a role that Dante, nostranger to answering an elevated call to action, tries to take on. For Henry’sincreasing similarity to Saul, see the article referred to by Filippo Bognini(Bogn.2007.1), p. 93 (n. 54). By the time Dante is writing Paradiso XXXII, Henryis dead, and thus well beyond useful hectoring. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s10-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s10-i]]31–32. [part0010.html#c04-s11-e] Piccarda and Constance, we are told, are inthe same space as that occupied by these glorious figures. Thinking of it thisway, we can understand why they are not in the least disturbed by their lowerrank within the Rose (Par. III.70–87). Exactly where in the celestial rose theyare seated is never revealed to us; we know only that they are fairly low in it(but at least halfway up, above the innocent babes [see Par. XXXII.37–48] andyet beneath the height attained by St. Clare [see Par. III.98–99], whatever thatmay be). [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s11-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s11-i]]33. [part0010.html#c04-s11-e] The souls in Plato’s Timaeus are said to remainlonger periods in their stars in accord with their greater goodness, a bit ofdoctrine slapped aside in this single verse.

The Empyrean is not a giro (circle), like the revolvingphysical heavens, but a point, both infinitely large (Par. XXXIII.85–93) andinfinitely small (Par. XXVIII.16–21). Nonetheless, here he says it is a giro.[return to English [part0010.html#c04-s12-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s12-i]]35. [part0010.html#c04-s12-e] The phrase dolce vita (sweet life), here usedfor the first time to indicate the life of the blessed in God’s eternal presence(see also Par. XX.48, XXV.93), has a biting resonance in Federico Fellini’sDante-haunted film of 1960, La dolce vita. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s12-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s12-i]]36. [part0010.html#c04-s12-e] The relative beatitude of the blessed is definedas the result of their greater or lesser ability to respond to the breath of theHoly Spirit. Normal human competitiveness makes it hard to imagine human beings,even fairly selfless and generous ones, taking joy in their lesser ability torespond to God’s love. On the other hand, our experience of some artists,musicians, and athletes reveals that there are indeed professionals who gladlyadmire the greater ability of their betters and enjoy participation in the sameactivity in which these “stars” excel. Unfortunately, there is probably lesssuch admirable conduct than one might hope. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s12-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s12-i]]37. [part0010.html#c04-s13-e] This verse seals Beatrice’s presentation of thetemporary nature of the souls’ presence in the Moon, as she uses a past definite(si mostraro [put themselves on view here]) to indicate that they no longer doso—their time in the Moon is over. See the similar use of the past definite inverse 32, appariro (appeared), which probably also indicates that they are nolonger present.

What Dante says is that Piccarda and her companions in the Moonoccupy a less exalted rank in Heaven; commentators (and translators) tend to saythat they occupy the least (i.e., the very lowest) of the heavenly ranks.However, the comparative adverb meno (less) is never used in the Commedia as asuperlative. The reason for this attempt to turn Dante’s vague placement of theminto something far more definite is perhaps found in an assumption that, ifthese women are here encountered in the lowest heaven, they must then be in thelowest rank of Heaven. The poem does not permit any such certainty. See the noteto vv. 31–32. [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s13-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s13-i]]40–42. [part0010.html#c04-s14-e] The need to speak to the human intellect interms reflecting the experience of the senses will be more fully explored in thenext two tercets, the corollary, as it were, to what has just been said here.And here Dante presents familiar Thomistic insistence on the priority (andusefulness) of sense data, an Aristotelian position and most certainly acounter-Platonic one.

II.7 and then found some eighteen times, with a lastappearance in Par. XXIV.81), taking this passage as his point of departure, seeDumol (Dumo.1998.1), pp. 1–13, 177–95. And for the source of Dante’s concept inAristotle (Ethics VI.1), as commented upon and developed by Aquinas, see pp.95–124.

[part0010.html#c04-s15-e] The phenomenon referred to by Beatrice, ofancient Christian lineage, is known as accommodative metaphor. Put simply (andDante’s text does this admirably), it is the metaphoric presentation of higherthings and higher beings that ordinary mortals simply have not the experientialbackground to understand. (For the closeness of Dante’s presentation of it hereto the exposition made by St. Thomas, see Hollander [Holl.1969.1], p. 192, andDumol [Dumo.1998.1], pp. 5–6.) For example, angels are pure being (or, as Dantewould say, “pure act” [see Par. XXIX.33]) and have no visible aspect. So that wemay better conceive them, we are allowed to think of them as having wings,faces, voices, and other attributes. Similarly, God Himself is beyond anyanthropomorphic human imagining, but Scripture allows us to think of Him ashaving hands and feet and so on.In an important sense, almost all of Dante’s experience of the afterworld in thefirst thirty cantos of this canticle is metaphoric, that is, what he sees in thestars is there only temporarily, and for illustrative purposes. For similarunderstandings, see Freccero, “Paradiso X: The Dance of the Stars” (Frec.1986.1[1968]), pp. 221–26; Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 192–201; Chiarenza(Chia.1972.1); Mazzotta (Mazz.1979.1), pp. 246–47; Barolini (Baro.1992.1), pp.143–65; and Moevs (Moev.1999.1). And see the appreciation of a Harvard freshman,Chris Hampson, in a seminar in the autumn of 2005: “The whole point is that thisis not what it’s really like.” [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s15-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c04-s15-i]]46–48. [part0010.html#c04-s16-e] As examples of ways in which we may have agraphic sense of exactly what the phrase “accommodative metaphor” signifies,church windows to this day represent angels with human features, while evenseven hundred years ago Dante knew that angels were disembodied, were “pure act”(Par. XXIX.33). Humans are allowed to conceive of such higher realities in moreconcrete and familiar terms. Unnamed, Raphael joins periphrastically his twofellow Archangels, the ones most frequently referred to in literature and life.Indeed, only Gabriel and Michael enjoy a presence in the standard Bible, whileRaphael’s is limited to the Book of Tobit (see the note to verse 48). [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c04-s16-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s16-i]]48. [part0010.html#c04-s16-e] Raphael is generally accounted one of the sevenangels “who stand before the Lord” (Apocalypse 8:2). The apocryphal book ofEnoch (chapter 21) furnishes the names of the four others, of whom only Uriel ismuch known today (and then mainly through his presence in Milton’s ParadiseLost). The story of how this Archangel allowed Tobias to cure the blindness ofhis father, Tobit, is told in the now apocryphal Book of Tobias (11:2–15). ThatDante elected to use this particular circumlocutory detail to identify Raphaelmay seem puzzling. However, it was one of the few concrete details associatedwith this Archangel known to him. And consult Paradiso XXVI.12 for another briefreference to a miraculous cure for blindness, that conferred by the laying on ofhands by Ananias. For a substantial recounting, one nearly as controlled andentertaining as a novella by Boccaccio, of the startling biblical narrativeconcerning Tobias and Raphael, see the commentary of Jacopo della Lana to vv.40–48.

This is heresy, tout court, if it ismeant literally. Beatrice’s correction of Dante’s error, concocted in theprevious canto as a recapitulation of the error he had in fact first made in theConvivio, should end our own confusion as to the presence of the souls in thespheres. They appear in a sort of cosmic accommodative metaphor, thus suggestingthat all the last canticle up to its thirtieth canto (with a brief hiatus in thetwenty-third—see the note to Par. XXIII.61–63) is a vast metaphoric preparationfor the seeing face-to-face that will occur in the Empyrean. Further, such anunderstanding reminds us how “historical,” how “real” everything described andseen in the first two canticles has seemed in comparison. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s17-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s17-i]]51. [part0010.html#c04-s17-e] The verb par[e] (seems) begins to open the doorto Dante’s attempt to hedge his attack on certain of Plato’s views in vv. 55–60.[return to English [part0010.html#c04-s17-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s17-i]]54. [part0010.html#c04-s18-e] The reference to “form” here indicates, inlanguage reflective of Scholastic terminology, an individuated human soul thatinhabits a specific body. [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s18-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s18-i]]55–63. [part0010.html#c04-s19-e] Dante opens the question of the potentialtruth to be found in Plato’s literally untrue teachings. Here again (see thenote to vv. 13–15) the reader will want to turn to the Epistola a Cangrande,again near its conclusion (84): “For we perceive many things by the intellectfor which language has no terms—a fact which Plato indicates plainly enough inhis books by his employment of metaphors; for he perceived many things by thelight of the intellect which his everyday language was inadequate to express”(tr. P. Toynbee).Dante’s view of Plato would seem to indicate great respect (if not as much asfor Aristotle, given greater praise than his teacher in Inferno IV), a sensethat some of his teaching was potentially or actually heretical, and a furthersense of admiration, perhaps based principally on what in Plato he found mostpoetlike, his use of metaphor to express truth slantwise. In both major momentsin which Dante discusses Plato, here and in the Epistle, the salient subject is,indeed, Plato’s use of metaphor. It is possible that Dante is fervently opposedto those who read Plato as a teller of literal truth (in which reading he isnothing short of a heretic avant-la-lettre, as are, on historical grounds, theneoplatonists, in Dante’s view). It seems possible, however, that Dante iswilling to allow the philosopher himself a potential escape route; he may haveseemed to him, in the end, more like a poet than a philosopher. Dante’s teacher,Thomas Aquinas, is cited by Oelsner (comm. to verse 51) as allowing for thepossibility, just as we have seen Dante do here, of a possible metaphoric truthin some of Plato’s dicta that are literally untrue. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s19-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s19-i]]55–57. [part0010.html#c04-s19-e] Bosco/Reggio, in their comment on thispassage, point out that its source may lie in Albertus Magnus, De natura etorigine animae (II.7), since that is a sure source for the embryology ofPurgatorio XXV, as was established by Bruno Nardi (“L’origine dell’anima umanasecondo Dante” [1931–32], repr. in Nard.1960.2). Should that be true (and, asthey argue, it seems likely that it is, since there is little to suggest Dantereally knew any Plato directly, even in Latin translation), it would deeplyundercut the notion that Dante’s acquaintance with the Timaeus was firsthand.And this would also reveal that Dante had a noted precursor in trying at leastto open the question of Plato’s possible acceptability to Christian thinkers, asone tradition has even no less a rigorist than Thomas Aquinas doing (see thelast sentence of the note to vv. 55–63). [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s19-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s19-i]]55. [part0010.html#c04-s19-e] For the view that the meaning of sentenza heremust be “intention,” see Sanguineti (Sang.1999.2). But Dante’s usual practiceand the likely significance of this tercet point rather in the direction of“meaning,” as any number of commentators believe. And see, for a previous use ofthe word in this canto, verse 24, “secondo la sentenza di Platone” (in accordwith Plato’s teaching).

[part0010.html#c04-s20-e] The nature of Dante’s own “modifiedastrology” has already been made clear in Marco Lombardo’s discussion of freewill and its relationship to astral influence, particularly in PurgatorioXVI.67–84. While any astrology at all seems mere foolishness to most modernreaders, Dante’s position, which mirrors that of St. Augustine, is that whateverinfluence the stars have on us, it in no way reduces our ability to choose thegood. Our birth stars may incline us in one direction or another (see Par.VIII.122–135), but we remain totally responsible for our choices, our actions.[return to English [part0010.html#c04-s20-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s20-i]]61–63. [part0010.html#c04-s21-e] The “unenlightened” theory of astralinfluence sponsored by the ancients (and possibly by Plato) resulted in thenaming of the planets for the powers (and limitations) they conferred on humanbeings. Dante’s version supersedes that theory and restores free will to humanconduct. [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s21-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s21-i]]62.

[part0010.html#c04-s22-e] Dante’s first question, dealt with secondbecause it has less “venom” in it (verse 27), finally has its day in court. Thatit is less potentially dangerous to the health of the soul does not mean that itis not worrisome, as the amount of space it receives now (over fifty lines)attests. It, too, centrally involves freedom of the will. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s22-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s22-i]]64–66. [part0010.html#c04-s22-e] Beatrice suggests that the protagonist’sfailure to understand the precise rules that govern the keeping of vows, unlikethe larger issue of freedom of the will, is less likely to interfere with hislove for her, his guide to the truth found in God. His potential problem withhis second “doubt” is a total one, while this one is only partial. [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c04-s22-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s22-i]]67–69. [part0010.html#c04-s23-e] Beatrice offers up another paradox (see herargument in Purg. XXXIII.94–99 that Dante’s inability to remember his sins isthe very proof that he committed them): For mortals not to understand divinejustice is evidence (the probable meaning of argomento here, though there isdebate on the point) that it exists. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s23-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s23-i]]70–72. [part0010.html#c04-s24-e] Because the nature of this questionconcerning vows is not so lofty that a closer-to-divine intelligence is requiredfor its solution, Beatrice will be able to explain it fully to mortal Dante.[return to English [part0010.html#c04-s24-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s24-i]]73–81. [part0010.html#c04-s25-e] Beatrice is brutally clear: Since the will byits very nature always seeks the good, any capitulation to external force is aviolation of God’s love. A modern reader may sense a certain outrage at thisline of thought. It would seem to call for martyrdom as the only adequateresponse if another would divert us from our true path by use of force or thethreat of force. As the following examples will make plain (vv. 82–87), that isexactly what is called for. If we fail to keep our absolute will intact (theterm is employed at verse 109; see the note to that passage, vv. 109–114),allowing it to be swayed by fear, we are guilty of the sin that afflicted bothPiccarda and Constance, who should have found some way to return to thecloister, no matter what harm they thought they might have faced in so doing.Dante’s doctrine is as simple and as terrifying as that. For discussion of thesequestions, see Singleton’s commentary to vv. 73–74; 76–78. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s25-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s25-i]]77–78. [part0010.html#c04-s26-e] The image of the flame that, temporarilytwisted by external force from its natural upright position, will always by itsvery nature raise itself back up underlines the natural propensity of the willto the good, despite the force that may be used against it. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s26-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s26-i]]82–87. [part0010.html#c04-s28-e] As he did so often in Purgatorio, Dantecombines a Christian and a pagan exemplary figure to make his point: “St.Lawrence, a deacon of the Church of Rome, said to have been a native of Huescain Spain who suffered martyrdom under the Emperor Valerian, Aug. 10, 258. Thetradition is that, being commanded by the prefect of Rome to deliver up thetreasures of the Church which had been entrusted to his charge by Pope SixtusII, he replied that in three days he would produce them. On the expiration ofthe appointed time he presented to the prefect all the sick and poor to whom hehad given alms, with the words ‘Behold the treasures of Christ’s Church.’ Theprefect thereupon directed St. Lawrence to be tortured, in order to make himreveal where the treasures were hidden. But, torture proving ineffectual, he wasstretched on an iron frame with bars, like a gridiron, beneath which a fire waskindled so that his body was gradually consumed. In the midst of his agony he issaid to have remained steadfast, and to have mocked his executioners, biddingthem to turn his body that it might be equally roasted on both sides (cf.Prudentius, Peristephanon liber 401–9)” (T). “Gaius Mucius Scaevola, Romancitizen who, when Lars Porsena of Clusium was besieging Rome, made his way intothe enemy’s camp with the intention of killing Porsena; by mistake, however, hestabbed the king’s secretary instead of the king himself. Being seized, Muciuswas ordered by the king to be burned alive, whereupon he thrust his right handinto a fire, which was already lighted for a sacrifice, and held it in theflames without flinching. Porsena, struck with admiration at his fortitude,ordered him to be set free; in return Mucius informed him that there were 300noble youths in Rome who had sworn to take the king’s life, that the lot hadfallen upon him to make the first attempt, and that his example would befollowed by the others, each as his turn came. Porsena, impressed with thisaccount of the determination of the Romans, made proposals of peace and withdrewfrom the siege. From the circumstance of the loss of his right hand, Mucius wasthenceforward known as Scaevola (‘left-handed’). Dante [also] mentions Mucius inconnexion with this incident [in] Conv. IV.v.13; and, with a reference to Livy(Ab urbe II.12) as his authority in Mon. II.v.14” (T). Will so firm as that,however, is rarely found. Nonetheless, willingness to accept even martyrdomremains the only eventual solution for this problem. And the example of Scaevolamakes the message even more painful: One must be prepared to do violence evenagainst oneself in the service of liberty. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s28-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s28-i]]89–90. [part0010.html#c04-s30-e] For Beatrice’s paraphrase of Dante’sunthinking analysis of the problem addressed here, see vv. 19–21. It has nowbeen “canceled” and should trouble him no more.

[part0010.html#c04-s31-e] Beatrice now offers a sort of corollary tothe message she has just delivered, anticipating Dante’s further question: Howcan Piccarda be telling the truth when she says that neither she nor Constanceever ceased wanting to be back in their convents (Par. III.112–117), if whatBeatrice has just said is true? [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s31-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c04-s31-i]]94–96. [part0010.html#c04-s32-e] This passage makes crystal clear what hassurely been evident earlier (most recently at Par. III.31–33, but as early asthe second canto of Inferno, when we see Beatrice through Virgil’s eyes, in hisdescription of her and her “vere parole” [Inf. II.135]): The souls of those inbliss never tell less than the absolute truth. [return to English[part0010.html#c04-s32-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c04-s32-i]]100–108. [part0010.html#c04-s34-e] Starting with a general remark, Beatriceattempts to clarify her position. Humans frequently do things they know theyshould not do, both against their own will and to escape from harm. The exampleshe adduces, that of Alcmaeon, does not, however, seem to fulfill the secondpart of her precision. Further, Dante seems to have muddled his version of thestory of Alcmaeon, nearly certainly derived from Statius (Thebaid II.265–305).(And see also Ovid, Metamorphoses IX.406–415.) In Statius, Alcmaeon is the sonof Amphiaraus and Eriphyle; he avenged his father’s death by killing his mother,who, bought off by the gift of a necklace, revealed Amphiaraus’s hiding place tothose who wanted to take him into battle with them and, because of herintervention, succeeded in doing so (see Purg. XII.49–51 [and note]).Beatrice’s description, in any case, does fit Piccarda’s tale perfectly. She didsomething she did not want to do (leaving her convent) and did not return fromfear of what might be done to her if she tried to—at least that is what Dantewould seem to want us to believe. [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s34-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c04-s34-i]]109–114. [part0010.html#c04-s37-e] Beatrice’s distinction is between theabsolute will (the Latin term, absoluta voluntas, reflects its root in the verbabsolvere, to release from obligation) and another will, unnamed, thattheologians refer to as the “conditioned” (or “conditional”) will, that is, awill conditioned by circumstance. “Assoluta here means ‘absolute’ as contrastedwith ‘relative.’ Independently of the circumstances (i.e., of the pressure offear) the will does not consent to the wrong forced upon it; but when affectedby fear of worse suffering in case of withdrawing itself from the pressure ofthat force, so far it does consent. So Piccarda, when she speaks of Constance’slife, does not take into account her yielding to fear, while Beatrice does takeit into account, and therefore regards her as defective in the observance of hervows. Thus both their statements are true” (Tozer to vv. 109–114). For example,one wants desperately to stop smoking but, like Svevo’s Zeno, continually yieldsto the abysmal need to smoke one last cigarette. Piccarda’s absolute will wasalways to desire the life of her convent; her conditioned will was to accept themarriage into which she was forced. And thus there is no contradiction betweenwhat she says of herself and what Beatrice describes as a blameworthy failure inher vows. They are speaking of two differing aspects of willing.

[part0010.html#c04-s39-e] In a poem controlled by large metaphoricconstructs (e.g., light, road, forest, mountain, sea, ship, wings, city, tree,plant, beast, etc.), the third cantica nonetheless stands out for its metaphoricexertions. The last developed metaphor in a canto that began by studying thejustification for metaphor, this passage (and many another after it) showsDante’s determination to up the “poetic ante” for his reader, asked to follow adifficult mind, setting about its work giving expression totheological/philosophical concepts in emotionally charged lyric language. On thesubject of metaphor in Dante (far less visited than the related topic ofsimile), see at least Raimondi (Raim.1986.1) and Pasquini (Pasq.1996.2 andPasq.2001.1, pp. 179–217).This particular metaphor has furnished the opening of Purgatorio XXI with itsbiblical material, the water of life that Jesus offers the Samaritan woman. Andhere it is Beatrice who is equated with Jesus, bringing the source of that waterto humankind. [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s39-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s39-i]]118–138. [part0010.html#c04-s40-e] Dante’s lengthy and flowery expression ofhis gratitude to Beatrice for her explanation and of his humility before God’smysteries serves as captatio benevolentiae in disposing Beatrice to answer stillone more question—not that she requires any such suasion. Once again, the needsof the poem come first. [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s40-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s40-i]]122. [part0010.html#c04-s41-e] Dante addresses Beatrice with the respectfulvoi, as he will also do at verse 134; but see the note to vv. 136–138.

[part0010.html#c04-s44-e] Tozer (comm. to this tercet) explains thisdifficult text as follows: “ ‘Owing to this desire of knowing the Divine Verity,doubt arises at the foot of truth as saplings rise from the foot of a tree.’Appiè del vero: This is another way of saying that it springs from the root oftruth, that idea being suggested by the metaphor: the doubt is a germ of truth.è natura, &c.: ‘it is a natural process, which impels us from height to heightunto the summit.’ By the questions which arise from learning a truth, we are ledon to the apprehension of a higher truth, and so onwards till the highest isreached.” [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s44-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s44-i]]136–138. [part0010.html#c04-s46-e] Dante’s third question will be the subjectof the first eighty-four verses of the following canto. Thus all of the presentcanto and over half of the next is devoted to three questions concerning thefreedom of the will, the most important issue confronting a moralizing Christianwriter. It is probably not accidental that Dante chose to put this discussionhere, in the first sphere, that of the Moon, reflecting the fact that the firstthree realms of the heavens present saved souls whose virtues were unmistakablymarred by significant defect (see the note to Par. III.47–49). Most of Paradisois concerned with the correction and perfection of Dante’s intellect. Itsbeginning offers a chance to reengage with the world of moral choice, soinviting to a writer who never gave up his engagement with the affairs ofhumankind in this life. [return to English [part0010.html#c04-s46-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c04-s46-i]]139–142. [part0010.html#c04-s47-e] This passage offers a variant on the themeof blindness already present in this canto in the reference to Tobias in verse48 (and see the note to that verse) and reworked in Canto XXVI.12, with itsreference to Ananias’s restoration of Saul’s sight. There Beatrice’sincreasingly evident power completely (if only temporarily) destroys his powerof sight; here Dante is weakened by Beatrice’s overpowering glance, his eyes soovercome that they, in a trope developed from military behavior, are temporarilyrouted by the Beatricean ocular “army.” Most unmilitary, Dante nearly faints, ashe did, for very different reasons, at the conclusions of Inferno III and V.A possible reason for the poet’s desire to underline the protagonist’s guiltyfeelings about Beatrice comes from the context we have just now entered, hisfirst enunciation (at vv. 136–138) of his question (see Beatrice’s rephrasing ofit in the following canto, Par. V.13–15) about the possibility of redemption forbroken vows. We do know that Dante had made at least one vow that he hadspectacularly failed to fulfill. In Vita nuova XLII.2 he had made a solemnpromise: “Sì che, se piacere sarà di colui a cui tutte le cose vivono, che lamia vita duri per alquanti anni, io spero di dicer di lei quello che mai non fuedetto d’alcuna” (Accordingly, if it be the pleasure of Him through whom allthings live that my life continue for a few more years, I hope to write of herthat which has never been written of any other woman [tr. M. Musa]).And so, while Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 138) are probably correct thatDante’s question is meant to be understood as being addressed formally to all inbliss with Piccarda (and see Tommaseo comm. to vv. 136–138, citing verse 67,where Beatrice mentions “la nostra giustizia” [our justice] in much the samecontext), the earlier addresses to Beatrice (vv. 122, 134) stay in our ears andcause a certain ambiguity. Is Dante still addressing his guida, or is hepondering the opinion of the saints? This is perhaps a case of Dante trying tohide behind the mask of a more general appeal: “Do you all up here know ifmortals are allowed to make broken vows good by substituting other things forthem?” That is preferable to asking Beatrice if God can ever forgive his notmaking good the vow he made to honor her at the end of the Vita nuova, only towrite Convivio instead, a work in which she is abandoned for the LadyPhilosophy. Dante, hidden behind that impersonal formulation (delivered by thatnoun used as a pronoun, l’uom [one]), wonders whether or not he might still makeamends for his broken promise with this poem in Beatrice’s honor. Such adecision is not in the lap of these “gods,” in fact, but belongs to the Father.He has obviously decided in favor of the claimant, otherwise the voyage wouldnot have been granted him.

[part0010.html#c05-s01-e] Beatrice explains that she has flamed morebrightly into Dante’s eyes, temporarily blinding him at the end of the lastcanto (vv. 141–142), because she enjoys perfect vision in God. Further, she sees(vv. 7–9) that the process that leads to such sight has now begun in Dante aswell. In him it is at its earliest stage, since he interprets what he knows ofGod in human terms, as is reflected in his recently expressed desire (Par.IV.136–138) to know the “economics” of divine forgiveness. [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s01-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s01-i]]1–6. [part0010.html#c05-s01-e] For a presentation of the status questionis ofa problem that has bothered many readers of these verses, see Giuseppe Ledda(Ledd.2002.1), pp. 263–64. Whose sight (veder, verse 5) is perfect (perfetto),Beatrice’s or Dante’s? Plausible cases can be (and have been) made for eachalternative. As is evident from our translation, we are inclined to side withthose who think that the improved sight is Beatrice’s, as her apprehension ofthe divine Essence draws her farther into God’s sight, thus also causing her toshine with greater effulgence. But see the early gloss of Francesco da Buti tovv. 1–18; in our own time Leonella Coglievina (Cogl.1990.1), p. 50; Marina DeFazio (Defa.1995.1), p. 85; Anna Maria Chiavacci Leonardi (Chia.1997.1), comm.to vv. 4–6, all have worked on this passage; all of them believe that the moreperfect vision mentioned by Beatrice belongs to Dante. Their case is made moredifficult by the fact that currently the protagonist is having a very hard timeseeing anything at all. And while majority vote is probably not a validprocedure for disentangling knotted skeins of Dante’s text, we are in accordwith the wider opinion, given summarizing voice by Alessandro Niccoli,“perfetto,” ED IV [1973]. The most imposing criticism of Beatrice’s candidacy isbased on verse 6: How can her will be described as being in motion toward God?Is she not already there? And the answer to that is found in the severalexpressions of eagerness on her part to get her peripatetic instruction of Dantecompleted so that she can get back “home,” first as she enters the poem (Inf.II.71); then in the earthly paradise when she makes clear that the temporarynature of a stay even in that most agreeable place is preferable to a permanentone (Purg. XXXII.100–102; XXXIII.10–12); finally, when she asks Dante to lookback down the “ladder” he has climbed up through the heavens in order to reachthe “ultima salute” (Par. XXII.124–132).

[part0010.html#c05-s01-e] The “heat of love” with which Beatrice isaflame may remind the reader of the kind of affection found in a previous fifthcanto, that presenting Francesca in Inferno; it is, however, better understood,as it was by John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 1–6), specifically as the lovebreathed into Beatrice by the Holy Spirit.

[part0010.html#c05-s01-e] This first occurrence of a character’s speakingthe opening verse of a canto in Paradiso may make a reader wonder how unusual itis to find the first verse(s) of a canto spoken by a person other than thenarrator. In fact, this is not that unusual a phenomenon, occurring thirteentimes in all. For a study of the nature of Dante’s exordia, see Blasucci(Blas.2000.1).

[part0010.html#c05-s03-e] Marina De Fazio (Defa.1995.1), p. 72, citesCesare Garboli’s notice (Garb. 1971.1, p. 7) of the highly probable dependenceof Dante’s verse “Io veggio ben sì come già resplende” (I see clearly how,reflected in your mind) on Guido Cavalcanti’s line “Io veggio che negli occhisuoi risplende” (I see that, shining from her eyes …), verse 11 of his Rime XXV,“Posso degli occhi miei novella dire.” She goes on to discuss the contrastiveuse to which the verse is put, since Guido’s amor (“fundamentally unknowable andtherefore conducive to error”) has a quite different valence, and since the lovethat Beatrice teaches (and represents) “is knowledge and leads to salvation.”[return to English [part0010.html#c05-s03-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c05-s03-i]]10–12.

XVII.103–5 and 127–9, viz., that both virtue and vice in manproceed from love, or the desire of what is good, only in the case of vice thedesire is misled by a false appearance of good.” [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s04-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s04-i]]11.

P. Shaw]). The wordis a “triple hapax,” that is, a word that appears exactly once in each cantica(cf. also Inf. XXIV.50 and Purg. XXVI.106; and, for occurrences of thisphenomenon in general, see Hollander [Holl.1988.3], Appendix). [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c05-s04-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s04-i]]13–15. [part0010.html#c05-s05-e] Beatrice repeats the burden of Dante’s thirdquestion (Par. IV.136–138). It is fair to say that it is urged by a singleconcern, but one that has both objective and personal focus for him (for thelatter, see Par. IV.19–21 and note): If one has not fulfilled one’s vow, isthere anything that may be offered in its place in order to make it good?Obviously there is, we may think, since Piccarda and Constance are both found inParadise. The problem is, nonetheless, worked out painstakingly in the followingseventy verses.On the concept of the vow (voto), see Aglianò (ED V [1976], pp. 1150a–1152b);for Dante’s barely hidden polemic here against the Decretalist position on howbroken vows may be amended (and thus finally become acceptable to God), seePastore Stocchi (Past.1972.1), pp. 16–18; and see the study of the three cantidevoted to the question (III, IV, V) in Mazzotta (Mazz.1993.1), pp. 34–55.Beatrice’s lengthy intervention (vv. 1–15 and 19–84) brings the second-longestvisit to any planetary heaven in Paradiso to its conclusion (I.73–V.85); onlythe space devoted to the Sun is greater (as is of course the longest heavenlyepisode, that of the Fixed Stars, which extends nearly five cantos). Had thepoet not interrupted her here, her eighty-one-verse speech would have been thelongest uninterrupted speech in the poem until this point (see the note to Purg.XVII.91–139). Reading the poem a second time, we probably anticipate the factthat Justinian will have the honor of having the longest uninterrupted speakingpart in the Commedia, 145 verses (all of the next canto and the first three ofVII). [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s05-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c05-s05-i]]16–17. [part0010.html#c05-s06-e] It is as though Dante were playing with theconventions of his art. This self-conscious introduction, naming theintermediate unit of division (between cantica and verse) of the poem (canto—seeBaranski [Bara.1995.3] for an appropriately theoretical consideration of thisterm) for the first time since Inferno XX.2 and XXXIII.90, makes Beatrice, as itwere, the “author” of this canto (see De Fazio [Defa.1995.1], pp. 74–75), andthen, while interrupting her speech (and thus depriving her of her “record”),compares her to one who does not interrupt his or her speech. Such playfulnesswill be found again in the last verse of the canto, once more deploying the wordcanto in a self-conscious way. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s06-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c05-s06-i]]19–24. [part0010.html#c05-s07-e] Promised by Virgil (at Purg. XVIII.73–75),here begins Beatrice’s disquisition on freedom of the will, the property of,among all things in God’s creation, angels and humans alone.It is this passage that a virtual unanimity of contemporary Dante scholarsbelieves is referred to in the famous tag “sicut in Paradiso Comoedie iam dixi”(as I have already said in the Paradiso of the Comedy [Mon. I.xii.6, tr. p.Shaw]), referring to God’s gift of free will to humankind. After the work ofRicci, Mazzoni, and Shaw (see Hollander [Holl.2001.1], pp. 150–51), not tomention Scott (Scot.1996.1, pp. 51–52) and Kay (Kay.1998.1, pp. xxiv–xxxi,giving probable cause for a date after 31 March 1317), there can be little doubtas to the genuineness of this passage, which probably dates the theologicallyminded political treatise as contemporary with the composition of the earlycantos of Paradiso, and no earlier than 1314 (Mazzoni’s estimate) and almostsurely not as late as Padoan’s choice of 1320. Mineo (Mine.1987.1), pp.90–92nn., dates the composition of Canto VI to the second half of 1316. If he iscorrect, then a date of 1317 for Monarchia would be reasonable. This is acomplex and vexed problem, one that cannot be said to be entirely resolved;however, whenever the treatise was written, it was almost certainly writtenbetween 1314 and 1321 (and nearly certainly—pace Padoan [Pado.1993.1, p.116]—earlier between these poles rather than later), despite the recent claimsof Palma di Cesnola (Palm.2003.1), pp. 43–46, for as early as 1313. In any case,neither set of previous arguments for an earlier composition, whether for a datepreceding Henry VII’s stay in Italy (1307 [Nardi]) or during it (1310–13[Macarrone, Vinay]), seems viable any longer.For the most recent discussion of the dates of composition of the Commedia, witha helpful summary of the modern debate (begun by Francesco Egidi in 1927), seeEnrico Fenzi (Fenz.2005.1). [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s07-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c05-s07-i]]23–24. [part0010.html#c05-s08-e] One wonders whether, without the account ofthe one-tenth of the angelic host who chose to rebel against their maker (forDante’s version of the event, see Par. XXIX.49–51), Dante would have felt theneed even to discuss the attribution of free will to angelic intelligences.[return to English [part0010.html#c05-s08-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c05-s08-i]]25–33. [part0010.html#c05-s09-e] Given the special status of the freedom ofour will and given the nature of a vow to God, made freely (no other kind isacceptable), the free will itself becomes part of what is pledged, that is, onesacrifices the right to will any differently in the future without forfeitingthe vow. In a real sense it is a pledge to will no further—at least with respectto the matter of a particular vow. The result is that one is not free to makesubstitution for what is originally promised, since that would be to replace theoriginal sacrifice with something of less value, or simply to attempt to useagain what had already been surrendered.According to Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 26–27), Dante’s rigorism with respect tothe conditions for the substitution of that which was vowed is in polemic withthe laxity in this respect of practitioners of canon law. [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s09-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s09-i]]34–39. [part0010.html#c05-s12-e] The point of the argument, for which Beatriceprepares Dante with a certain urgency, is that there is no possible substitutionfor a vow, but that “Holy Church” (the sarcasm is stinging) does in fact allowsuch substitution. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s12-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c05-s12-i]]43–63. [part0010.html#c05-s15-e] These verses contain the core of Beatrice’sposition. Here is a portion of Carroll’s discussion of them: “She draws adistinction between the matter of a vow, and the compact or agreement itself,the latter of which, as the previous discourse showed, could never be cancelled,save by being fulfilled. Even the Hebrews had still to offer, though sometimesthe thing offered was allowed to be changed. Among Christians the surrender ofthe will in a vow must still be made, but in certain cases the ‘matter’ of thevow may be exchanged for something else. This commutation, however, is to takeplace under the strictest conditions. First of all, no man is at liberty toshift the burden at his own pleasure: since the vow is to God, only God’srepresentative can alter it—‘both the white key and the yellow’ [verse 57] mustturn in the lock, the knowledge and the authority of the Church. Even theChurch, in the second place, ought not to commute the ‘matter’ of a vow save forsomething else of greater value. In the Mosaic law, the increase of value wasassessed at one-fifth; Dante raises it to one-half—the proportion is to be asfour to six. It follows from this, in the next place, that there are some thingsof such supreme value that this exchange of a half more is impossible; and inthis case there can be no commutation, far less dispensation. It is commonlyassumed that Dante is here referring to the vow of chastity, which ‘draws downevery scale,’ and can have no equivalent. The question is carefully discussed byAquinas, who holds that even the Papal authority has no power to cancel thisvow.” [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s15-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c05-s15-i]]43–45. [part0010.html#c05-s15-e] Beatrice’s discussion of the two elements ofa vow now begins to modulate, and seems to mirror her earlier discussion ofabsolute and conditional will (see Par. IV.109–114 and note). Vows have twocomponents, the vow itself (equivalent to the sacrifice of free will), like theabsolute will, in that it may never acceptably be relinquished; and the thingvowed. We now realize that Beatrice has been hiding, in her urgent rebuttal ofthose clergy who want to keep their “customers” happy, the fact that there is aloophole in the laws regarding the second component of a vow, the beloved thingitself that is freely sacrificed. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s15-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c05-s15-i]]46–48. [part0010.html#c05-s16-e] The vow itself, the sacrifice of free will,may never be withdrawn except by being finally adhered to; this position is whatresults, Beatrice says, from her previous argument. [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s16-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s16-i]]49–51. [part0010.html#c05-s17-e] The last chapter of Leviticus repeatedly(27:13, 15, 19, 27, 31) sets the official rate of exchange: Whatever is putforth in substitution must be of 20 percent greater value.Here we, for the first time, have an example of an acceptable substitution forsomething vowed, even if exactly what may be substituted is less thanimmediately clear, while its worth seems nitpickingly precise (120 percent).Reading these verses, Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 40–51) found himselfreminded of Genesis 22:13, where Abraham substitutes a ram for Isaac as hissacrifice to his Lord: “sicut filius Abrae in arietem.” It is difficult tounderstand how a ram might be worth 120 percent of one’s beloved son, much lessthe 150 percent to which Beatrice will later raise the ante (verse 60). But suchare the ways of God, not easily interpreted by us mere humans, whether we are bytrade commentators or not. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s17-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c05-s17-i]]51. [part0010.html#c05-s17-e] Beatrice means that Dante should know theseconditions from his knowledge of Leviticus. [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s17-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s17-i]]52–63. [part0010.html#c05-s18-e] And now Beatrice makes plain the rulesgoverning allowable substitution in the “matter” of the vow: The new pledge’sworth must be 150 percent (6 to 4) of what was first offered. This seems anearly impossible condition to fulfill (and is even harsher than the conditionimposed in Leviticus 27, as we have seen [see the note to vv. 49–51]) withouttrivializing the nature of the initial vow. It is probably fair to say that thisis exactly Beatrice’s (and Dante’s!) point, for she wants essentially to ban allnegotiations with God on the part of scheming prelates and, for that matter, ofthose selfish members of their flocks. [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s18-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s18-i]]57. [part0010.html#c05-s19-e] The two keys refer to mercy and justice (see thenote to Purg. IX.117–126) as these are administered by the Church, through thepower vested in its priests. One may not, in other words, take it upon oneselfto decide exactly what is of greater value than the object first offered.[return to English [part0010.html#c05-s19-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c05-s19-i]]64–72. [part0010.html#c05-s22-e] Beatrice now adds a sort of corollary to herprevious instruction, warning us in indirect address (“Let not mortals take vowslightly”) not to make foolish vows that are better broken than kept. Thisconstitutes a special case; it is clear that we are meant to consider most vowsas being both wise and well intentioned.Jephthah’s keeping of his vow is joined with Agamemnon’s equally disastrouspledge with regard to Iphigenia. Dante pairs a scriptural and a pagan source(cf. the similar proceeding at Par. IV.82–83, linking St. Lawrence and MuciusScaevola) to underline his point. See Judges 11:30–40 and Cicero, De officiisIII.25 (according to Moore [Moor.1896.1], p. 263). But see also, as variouscommentators point out, Virgil (Aen. II.116–117) and Ovid (Metam. XII.27–38).Both Jephthah and Agamemnon make unexamined vows that result in the deaths oftheir daughters. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s22-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c05-s22-i]]64. [part0010.html#c05-s22-e] This is the seventh and final occurrence of theword voto (vow) in Cantos III through V. Underlining how heavily it dominatesthe discourse in these cantos, its presence is found in only two other places inthe rest of the poem (Inf. XXVIII.90; Par. XXXI.44). [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s22-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s22-i]]66–68. [part0010.html#c05-s22-e] For the troublesome word mancia, which, inmodern Italian, usually refers to the gratuity left for someone who performs aservice, see its only other use in the poem at Inferno XXXI.6, where it alsowould seem to mean “offering” or “gift.” Not all agree that this is what theword means in Dante. One alternative reading is based on the Old French wordmanche, with the meaning “assault,” “(military) encounter,” as Bosco/Reggio(comm. to verse 66) point out. They also remind us that St. Thomas, too,presents Jephthah as an exemplary maker of a foolish vow (ST II-II, q. 88, a.2); Thomas cites St. Jerome: “He was only being foolish when he made such a vow,but he turned impious when he kept it.” [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s22-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s22-i]]70. [part0010.html#c05-s24-e] Iphigenia had to mourn her beauty becauseAgamemnon, her father, had promised to sacrifice the most beautiful thing to beborn in his realm that year if Diana would grant favoring winds so that theGreek fleet might set sail from Aulis for Troy. From Dante’s point of view, thevow itself is tinctured with worse things than foolishness, since Troy was thesacred birthplace of what becomes, after its destruction at the hands ofperfidious Greeks, Rome. For an earlier and less frontal encounter with thisclassical matter, see Inferno XX.110–111.For Dante’s transposition of the tears of Jephthah’s daughter, weeping for herlost youth in the mountains of her sorrow (Judges 11:37–38), to Iphigenia’scheeks, see Torraca (comm. to vv. 70–72).

[part0010.html#c05-s25-e] Beatrice joins a second (and now direct)address to her last one (vv. 64–72), now specifically referring to Christians,who are ipso facto more guilty than the rest of humankind if they make foolishvows. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s25-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c05-s25-i]]74–75. [part0010.html#c05-s25-e] There is a continuing debate (if not one ofparticular consequence) about the precise meaning of this “water.” Some take itin the wider sense, that is, Christians are warned not to take vows lightly inthe hopes that they will “cleanse” them of guilt; others stay closer to theliteral, seeing in acqua the cleansing holy water of easy absolution granted byan all-too-human priestly intercessor for an ill-considered vow. The followingtercet would seem to support this second line of interpretation, which informsour translation, by implicitly calling into question the authority of such ineptpriests.In such a reading, the two verses thus would have a chronological relation:Christians should (1) be hesitant before reaching out for God’s help by takingvows without due consideration of their ensuing indebtedness and then (2), oncehaving made that initial mistake, not be so sure that all priestly interventionwill work to release them from their lightly considered (but nonethelessbinding) vows. This does seem to be the more likely meaning. If it seems thatsuch a reading blurs the traditional Catholic view, one that protects theindividual believer from the captious behavior of his or her priest, it shouldbe remembered that a vow is a pact (see verse 28, above, and Par. XII.17) madedirectly by the individual with God Himself. [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s25-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s25-i]]76–78. [part0010.html#c05-s26-e] This tercet, if understood as a generalstatement, would badly undercut the role of the clergy in the human search forsalvation, as a sort of Catholic version of each believer praying in his or hercloset (albeit guided by the pope). The word “salvamento” occurs only here inthe poem, and in final-rhyme position (where the poet’s imagination is mostforced, one admits, to find ingenious rhymes). Could it be used with a morelimited sense? That is, does it mean “solution” to a particular probleminvolving vows? This would be a difficult argument to sustain. Among theearliest commentators (e.g., Jacopo della Lana to these verses, interpreting“ ’l pastor de la Chiesa” as follows: “le predicazioni che vi fanno li pastoridella Chiesa” [the preaching that the priests of the Church make for you]), thereading “ ’l pastor” was plural (“ ’i pastor”). However, Benvenuto’s text was asours, and he nevertheless interprets the singular as a plural (comm. to vv.73–78): “praelatos praedicantes et dirigentes vos” (prelates offering youdirection in their preaching). Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 73–84) is thefirst to understand the pope (and only the pope), but he seems totallycomfortable with that meaning. In any case, and as Carroll suggests (comm. tovv. 64–84), what Dante, through Beatrice, is really saying is that vows are notnecessary to salvation, that we should enter into them only with dueconsideration. Porena (comm. to this tercet) puts the matter with admirableconcision: “Per salvare l’anima basta, invece, osservare i comandamenti di Dio,i precetti di Cristo nel Vangelo e i precetti della Chiesa guidata dal papa” (Tosave one’s soul, on the other hand, it is sufficient to follow God’scommandments, Christ’s precepts, and those of His Church, guided by the pope).[return to English [part0010.html#c05-s26-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c05-s26-i]]79–81. [part0010.html#c05-s27-e] See Carroll’s gloss on this tercet (comm. tovv. 64–84): “Dante appeals to Christians to be on their guard against the wickedgreed which will tell them that the Old and the New Testament and the Shepherdof the Church are not sufficient to salvation, and induces them to take vowsunder promise of an easy absolution for the breaking of them.” [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c05-s27-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s27-i]]81. [part0010.html#c05-s27-e] The Jew (introduced to this subject at verse 49)living among Christians knows the Law, and therefore the rules regarding themaking and keeping of vows, as well as they do; he is thus uniquely, amongnon-Christians, capable of recognizing their hypocrisy.

(Mestica [comm. on this verse] looks back to two moments in theearthly paradise in which his lady requires such duty of him, Purg. XXXII.104–5and XXXIII.52–54.) What, however, is lacking in some such comments, those thattend to emphasize Dante’s loyalty to his beloved guide, is the force of thegesture, which reinforces his pose, one that makes him not the inventor of afiction but the reporter of a series of actual encounters. In Paradiso X.27,Dante will again refer to himself as a scribe (scriba), only setting down (andnot inventing) what has been revealed to him. This verse anticipates thatgesture, presenting him as scriba Beatricis, seventy lines ago herself presentedas the “author” of this canto (see verse 16). For the influential andgroundbreaking study of the poet’s self-presentation as “scriba Dei,” seeSarolli (Saro.1971.1), esp. pp. 215–16, 233–43, 335–36.

[part0010.html#c05-s29-e] There is surprisingly much debate about theexact location of this brightness upon which Beatrice fastens her gaze. Sufficeit to say that, since they are still beneath the Sun, that is a possibleterminus; but where the universe is brightest is where God is, the Empyrean.Compare the similar view expressed by John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 85–87).[return to English [part0010.html#c05-s29-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c05-s29-i]]88–99.

[part0010.html#c05-s30-e] The nature of Dante’s unasked questions, whichsome have attempted to puzzle out, is never made known.

[part0010.html#c05-s32-e] Beatrice’s increased joy at being, withDante, closer to God makes even the immutable planet glow more brightly.

[part0010.html#c05-s34-e] This simile immediately reminds the readerof the similar formal comparison that preceded the exchange between Dante andthe souls who appeared to him in the Moon (Par. III.10–18), in a positionparallel, that is, to this one’s. There Dante believes that the forms he sees asthough they were under water or glass are reflections of himself and ofBeatrice. He avoids such Narcissistic error here, where he understands at oncethat these are souls that welcome him with love. We can see that, havingexperienced a single heaven, he has learned much about heavenly love. [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c05-s34-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s34-i]]105. [part0010.html#c05-s35-e] Their loves are for one another in God. Howwill Dante help increase these? This line has been variously interpreted. Itseems first of all true that these saved souls, finding a mortal in the heavens,know that they will help him become more holy by answering his questions andpreparing him for Paradise, thus increasing the objects of their affection byone and the heat of their affection for one another. It also seems at leastpossible that they refer to a second future increase in their affections, forone another and for him, when he joins them after his death, one more to loveand be loved in God.

[part0010.html#c05-s39-e] The speaker, as we shall learn in the nextcanto (verse 10), is the shade of the Roman emperor Justinian. His reference toDante as “bene nato” (born for bliss) has Virgilian (and thus imperial?)resonance, in that in the Aeneid the hero is referred to as natus (meaning“son”) some three dozen times (see Hollander [Holl.1989.1], p. 90, n. 28). Hegreets Dante, then, as the new Aeneas. [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s39-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s39-i]]116–117. [part0010.html#c05-s39-e] Justinian’s words for triumph and warfarereflect his imperial background and concerns; here they have a modified sense,the triumph over death found in Christ and the Christian sense of militancyreflected, for example, in Job 7:1, “Life is a warfare,” cited by Aversano(Aver.2000.2), p. 24.

[return to English[part0010.html#c05-s40-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s40-i]]122–123. [part0010.html#c05-s41-e] The poetic playfulness of the canto, soevident near its beginning and at its end (see the second part of the note tovv. 16–18), is present here as well, both in the rima composta “Dì, dì” (Say,say) and in the rapidly repeated sounds of di in these verses (“Dì, dì … credicome a dii … t’annidi”). Beatrice excitedly urges Dante (whose name happens tobegin with that sound) on in his increasing hunger for knowledge of heavenlythings. (For an even more exhilarated passage, see Paradiso VII. 10–12.)Why all these repetitions in the concluding verses of the canto? Here dì dì(pronounced, in order to rhyme with annidi and ridi, “dìdi”), and then in verse138: chiusa chiusa, and in 139: canto canta? Does the device of anaphora(repetition) have a thematic purpose, mirroring things that can be representedonly by themselves (as is the case with vows)? [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s41-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c05-s41-i]]124–126. [part0010.html#c05-s42-e] Whereas Dante could eventually make out thefacial features of Piccarda (Par. III.58–63), as his ascent continues he is ableto make out less of such detail in the next subsolar heaven; then, in the lastof them, in Venus, Charles Martel (whom he knew on earth as he did Piccarda [atleast within the claims made in the poem]) is, unlike Piccarda, notrecognizable, and makes it clear that he is simply not visible as himself toDante’s mortal sight (Par. VIII.52–54). Occupying a middle ground, as it were,Justinian’s former facial features are all, with the exception of his eyes,elided by his joy. This may reflect a “program” for the gradual effacement ofthe signs of human personality in Dante’s first three heavenly spheres.

[part0010.html#c05-s43-e] Dante’s two questions addressed toJustinian will be answered in the next canto at vv. 1–27 and 112–126. His secondquestion reflects his similar one to Piccarda (Par. III.64–66): Why is thisspirit in so relatively low a sphere? Dante may have forgotten Beatrice’sinstruction in the last canto (Purg. IV.28–36), which makes it plain that suchheavenly gradation is only temporary. Or he may have grasped the point thattemporary presence in a planet is part of God’s universal plan for hisinstruction and wants to know more.

[part0010.html#c05-s43-e] It was perhaps more than ten years earlier thatDante had compared the planet Mercury to the branch of knowledge known asdialectic (Conv. II.xiii.11): “The heaven of Mercury may be compared toDialectics because of two properties: for Mercury is the smallest star ofheaven, because the magnitude of its diameter is not more than 232 miles …; theother property is that in its passage it is veiled by the rays of the sun morethan any other star” (tr.

Just so, Dante tells us, Justinian, the love he feels increased byDante’s affection for him and by his own for Dante, was swathed increasingly inhis own light so that he, too, becoming brighter, became less visible as a humansemblance.

[part0010.html#c06-s01-e] Justinian’s response to Dante’s first inquiryallows the poet to present his version of the biography of the emperor whocodified Roman law. “Justinian I, surnamed the Great, emperor of Constantinople,a.d. 527–565. Justinian is best known for his legislation. He appointed acommission of jurists to draw up a complete body of law, which resulted in thecompilation of two great works; one, called Digesta or Pandectae (533), in fiftybooks, contained all that was valuable in the works of preceding jurists; theother, called codex constitutionum, consisted of a collection of the imperialconstitutions. To these two works was subsequently added an elementary treatisein four books, under the title of Institutiones (533); and at a later periodJustinian published various new constitutions, to which he gave the name ofNovellae constitutiones (534–65). These four works, under the general name ofCorpus iuris civilis, form the Roman law as received in Europe” (T).The sixth canto in each cantica, as has often been appreciated, is devoted to anincreasingly wide political focus: first to Florentine politics, then to Italianpolitics, and now to Dante’s theologically charged imperial politics. For aclear statement of what had become the standard view, see Brezzi (Brez.1968.1),p. 176. The three spokesmen for these three subjects are also of increasingdistinction: Ciacco, Sordello, and Justinian; we get another clue as to Dante’shigh esteem for Ciacco despite his deforming gluttony and resulting damnation.The canto is divided into four parts, the first and third as direct responses toDante’s preceding questions (Par. V.127–129). The second (vv. 28–111) is coylycharacterized by Justinian himself, here serving as Dante’s stand-in, as a“digression” (alcuna giunta—verse 30). It is not only the longest but alsoclearly the central element in Justinian’s discourse. The final section (vv.127–142) is devoted to a second spirit in Mercury, Romeo di Villanova. Mineo(Mine.1987.1), pp. 91–92, believes that the theme holding this canto together isearthly justice. And see Mazzoni (Mazz.1982.1), p. 159. We need look no fartherthan the first line of his Institutiones (I.i.1) to see how important thatconcept was to this man, who had the root of the word inscribed in his very name(iustus is Latin for “just”): “Iustitia est constans et perpetua voluntas iussuum cuique tribuens” (Justice is the constant and perpetual desire to rendereach his due).

[part0010.html#c06-s01-e] It has been suggested (Holl.2001.1, p. 140) thatthis canto, the only one in the poem spoken by a single voice, is a sort ofDantean version of a miniaturized Aeneid, become, in this handling, atheologized history of Rome. This first verse lends aid to such a view, as itrather dramatically opens this “mini-epic” in medias res, as indeed did the poemthat contains it (see the note to Inferno I.1). The uniqueness of Justinian’scanto, the only one in the poem dedicated to a single speaker and to the longestsingle speech in the poem, reflects the phenomenon addressed in great detail byWilkins (see the section “Style in Paradiso” in the introduction): The thirdcantica has fewer speakers, but these speak at greater length than do most ofthose found in the first two canticles.

[part0010.html#c06-s01-e] The Eagle, symbol of the Roman Empire,originally, with Aeneas, followed the course of the heavens, encircling theearth from east to west. Subsequently it moved from west (Italy) to east(Constantinople), where Constantine had transferred the seat of the empire in330, and where Justinian governed from 527 until 565.Aeneas’s taking Lavinia to wife, not recounted in the Aeneid, is the onlyVirgilian detail that is reprocessed in Justinian’s epic narrative.

[part0010.html#c06-s02-e] Dante’s chronology is different from that ofmost historians; he perhaps reflects one tradition found in some manuscripts ofBrunetto Latini’s Tresor, which has it that the initial transfer took place in333 (and not in 330) and that Justinian assumed the eastern throne only in 539(and not in 527), some 206 years later, thus accounting for Dante’s error (inverse 4: “two hundred years and more”). For speculation regarding these dates inrelation to Dante’s sense of imperial prophecy in the Aeneid, see Hollander andRusso (Holl.2003.1).The mountains of the Troad, in Asia Minor, are presented as the site of Troy.[return to English [part0010.html#c06-s02-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c06-s02-i]]4.

[part0010.html#c06-s03-e] Justinian’s words allow a reader to glimpse theheavily theologized nature of this history lesson. The citation (first noted byBaldassare Lombardi, in his comm. to this verse) of Psalm 16:8 (17:8), “subumbra alarum tuarum” (beneath the shadow of your wings), building on the phrase“l’uccel di Dio” (the bird of God) in verse 4, invests the passage with a senseof divinity that is surely and specifically Christian.

One feels in both the presence ofdivine selection. It is not even a paradox that in Dante a greater solemnity isassociated with the emperors, seen as carrying out God’s work even before therewere Christian emperors.

[part0010.html#c06-s04-e] This verse performs a perfectly balancedfive-word chiasmus:Cesare  Giustinianofui soneJustinian was a ruler and is a citizen of Heaven.This verse makes a reader mindful of that classical (and modern) poeticconvention in which the dead open a colloquy with passersby through the agencyof the words inscribed on their tombstones; see Stefano Carrai (Carr.2002.1),pp. 99–105. [return to English [part0010.html#c06-s04-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c06-s04-i]]11–12. [part0010.html#c06-s04-e] One key element in Justinian’sself-presentation as inspired lawgiver is perhaps surprisingly similar to a keyelement in Dante’s self-description as inspired poet (see Purgatorio XXIV.52–54and the note to that tercet). Hollander [Holl.1999.1], pp. 279–81, callsattention to the similarity in the presentations of Dante and Justinian asdivinely inspired writers; see vv. 23–24, below: “it pleased God, in His grace,to grant me inspiration / in the noble task to which I wholly gave myself.”It may seem odd that Dante thought of the Digesta, Justinian’s great winnowingof Roman law into fifty volumes, as having been inspired by the Holy Spirit—butnot much more so than that he could have made the same claim for his own poetry.Moments like these make it difficult to deny the daring of the claims this poetmakes for the veracity of his own fiction. He had to know how much discomfortthis claim would cause, broadening, as it does, the range of those to whom theSpirit had chosen to speak beyond the wildest imagining. (See Mazzoni[Mazz.1982.1], pp. 139–40, for acknowledgment of this dimension of Dante’sstrategy [which may seem surprising to those who wish to keep theology andpolitics separate], pointing to Kantorowicz’s previous and entirely similarunderstanding.)The words “[il] primo amor ch’i’ sento” are potentially problematic. We havefollowed tradition in translating the verb sentire as meaning “feel.” However,it certainly could mean “hear.” The verb is used some 92 other times in thepoem; some 32 of these mean “hear,” while some 60 indicate a more general senseof sense perception. See the clear examples of both meanings in a single verse:Purgatorio XXIV.38. Thus we have no reason to believe it could not mean “hear”here. And see the parallel with the phrase “ch’i’odo” at Purgatorio XXIV.57,pointed out by Hollander (Holl.1999.1), p. 279.

[part0010.html#c06-s05-e] Justinian confesses that he had believed inthe monophysite heresy, embraced by Eutyches, which allowed Jesus only a divinenature, that is, denied His humanity. Credit for bringing his view intoconformity with orthodoxy is conferred upon Pope Agapetus I (533–536). AsCarroll points out (comm. to vv. 1–27), however, Dante has, whether innocentlyor not, twisted several facts in order to manufacture his version of a Justiniancured of heresy before he did his inspired work on Roman law; for example,Agapetus came to Constantinople only after the books were finished, whileDante’s account (vv. 22–24) is quite different. Our poet simply must have aChristian compiler of the laws that were to govern Christian Europe; and so hemanages to find (“create” might be the better word) him.

[part0010.html#c06-s07-e] Agapetus is given credit for arguing his caseso convincingly that Justinian was persuaded, as would be a contemporary ofDante, by Aristotle’s “law of contradictories.” Tozer (comm. to this tercet)paraphrases as follows: “ ‘[Agapetus’s] article of faith (the two Natures inChrist) I now see clearly, in the same way as you see that of twocontradictories one must be false, the other true’; i.e. not as a matter ofopinion or inference, but with absolute certainty.” [return to English[part0010.html#c06-s07-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c06-s07-i]]22–24. [part0010.html#c06-s08-e] Justinian now makes still more specific thedependence of his legal writing on the Holy Spirit. See the note to vv. 11–12.Dante is insistent in establishing the emperor’s conversion as preceding hisformulation of the laws, no matter what the facts may have been. [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c06-s08-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c06-s08-i]]25–27. [part0010.html#c06-s09-e] Belisarius (ca. 500–565), Justinian’sgreatest general, is portrayed by Dante in unproblematic and glowing terms,either despite what the poet knew of his eventual difficulties with his emperoror in ignorance of them. If Dante did know the extravagant and unverified tale(but he may not have, we must remember) that Justinian finally had all hispossessions stripped from Belisarius and also had him blinded, we would senseeven more strongly how willing Dante was to let the ideality of the situationtrump its actuality. For here is a realm that a Dante can love, its supremeleader completely dedicated to the practical intellectual concerns ofgovernance, the law, while his “right hand,” loyal and true, takes care ofproblems with the Vandals in Africa and the Goths in Italy. In any case, thispair of heroic figures offers Dante an emblem of the successful collaborationbetween representatives of the active and of the contemplative life (here in theform of the lower part of Boethius’s familiar binome, practical [rather thantheoretical] thought; see Cons. Phil. I.1[pr.]).This is, according to the Grande Dizionario, one of the very few times in thehistory of the Italian language that the verb commendare is used to signify“affidare” (entrust)—the only other example put forward comes from Castiglionetwo centuries later. In Dante the word more usually signifies “praise,celebrate.” [return to English [part0010.html#c06-s09-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c06-s09-i]]30. [part0010.html#c06-s10-e] Narrowing the principal activity of his own lifeon behalf of Rome triggers in Justinian the need to “add” something more, a“digression” of sorts (vv. 34–111), which naturally enough has begun (vv. 31–33)by touching on the criminally irresponsible struggles between Guelphs andGhibellines in Dante’s Italy. It will, also naturally enough, conclude with thesame concern (vv. 97–111). Thus ancient history has a most modern relevance andis framed by that topic.

[part0010.html#c06-s11-e] The outcome of the struggle of the Eagle, agreat Hegelian bird moving through history to make manifest the Spirit, ishardly a cause for optimism, at least not at the moment in which Dante iswriting. The “covers” of Justinian’s historical essay both depict the disastrouspresent day in Italy. The ensuing narrative of the Eagle’s flight through timeand space is put to the service of showing that it has become the corrupt emblemof a corrupt party (the Ghibellines of 1300), opposed by equally corruptGuelphs.Justinian speaks ironically (employing the trope antiphrasis, saying theopposite of what is meant).

[part0010.html#c06-s12-e] The Eagle is marked by virtù (usually “power”but, at times, as here, “virtue”), precisely what the opposing Italian politicalparties lack. The ensuing list of virtuous founding presences harps upon themoral virtues that separated Romans from their enemies. See Convivio IV.iv.11for an earlier expression of Dante’s firm belief in the moral superiority of theRomans: “Therefore, since this office [rulership] could not be attained withoutthe greatest virtue, and since its exercise required the greatest and mosthumane kindness, this was the people best disposed to receive it” (tr. R.Lansing). [return to English [part0010.html#c06-s12-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c06-s12-i]]35–36. [part0010.html#c06-s12-e] Roman imperial virtue begins with the deathof Pallas, son of Evander. Despite the special protection of Aeneas, Pallas iskilled in battle by Turnus (Aen. X.479–489). Thus the founding event of theempire is presented here as the death of Pallas, an event that seems to have thestatus of sacrifice. For a discussion in this vein, see Rachel Jacoff(Jaco.1985.1). The death of Cato has a similar resonance; he died for liberty,as Virgil tells Dante (Purg. I.71–72; and see the note to vv. 71–74). Pallasdies in order to give virtue a homeland in Italy where, for a time at least, itprospered. “His death led to that of Turnus, because Aeneas would have sparedthe latter’s life, had he not seen the belt of Pallas, which [Turnus] waswearing (Aen. XII.940–950). By Turnus’ death Aeneas became possessed of Lavinia,and of the Kingdom of Latinus. Thus the death of Pallas ultimately caused theeagle to obtain the sovereignty” (Tozer’s commentary to vv. 35–36).Of the death of Pallas, Dante (Monarchia II.ix.14) has this to say: “In thiscombat [with Turnus] the clemency of the victor Aeneas was so great that, had henot caught sight of the belt which Turnus had taken from Pallas when he killedhim, the victor would have granted life as well as peace to the vanquished, asour poet’s closing lines testify” (tr.

R. Lansing). That meansDante counts the sixth king, Tullius Servius, related by marriage but not bybirth, as one of the Tarquins, as Toynbee explains (“Tarquinii”).It is probably significant that the first period of Roman history is marked, ateither end, by rape, that of the Sabine women in Romulus’s rule and that ofLucrece by her husband’s cousin, Sextus Tarquinius, son of Lucius TarquiniusSuperbus, seventh king of Rome. That second act of sexual violence eventuallyhad the result of ending Tarquin rule (510 b.c.). [return to English[part0010.html#c06-s14-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c06-s14-i]]43–45. [part0010.html#c06-s15-e] Dante records two major military victories ofthe ensuing republican period. “Brennus, leader of the Senonian Gauls, who in390 b.c. crossed the Apennines, defeated the Romans at the Allia, and took Rome;after besieging the capitol for six months he quitted the city upon receiving1,000 pounds of gold as a ransom for the capitol and returned home safe with hisbooty. According to later tradition (followed by Livy), at the moment when thegold was being weighed and Brennus, declaring the Roman weights to be false, hadthrown his sword into the scale, Camillus and a Roman army appeared, fell uponthe Gauls, and slaughtered them” (T). “Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, born 318 b.c.,died 272 b.c.; he claimed descent from Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles andgreat-grandson of Aeacus. In 280 Pyrrhus crossed over into Italy at theinvitation of the Tarentines to help them in their war against the Romans” (T).This tercet begins a passage dedicated to the Roman republic (vv. 43–54). For aclear understanding of Dante’s allegiance to republican ideals and principles,see Davis, “Ptolemy of Lucca and the Roman Republic” (1974) and “RomanPatriotism and Republican Propaganda: Ptolemy of Lucca and Pope Nicholas III”(1975), both reprinted in Davi.1984.1, pp. 254–89 and 224–53, respectively; andsee Hollander and Rossi (Holl.1986.1) and the note to Paradiso XXVII.61–63.[return to English [part0010.html#c06-s15-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c06-s15-i]]45.

Some early commentators think Dante was only deliberately(because of the exigencies of rhyme) misspelling miro (admire) with a double“rr”; others see that it means “preserve,” as Scartazzini argues it indeed does,if he dislikes any sense of the odoriferous, favored by some but inappropriate,in his view, in Paradise.

Hannibal (247–183 b.c.) was Rome’s perhaps most glorious and successfulantagonist, over a period of some fifteen years defeating them in several majorbattles, until, at the battle of Zama, in 202 b.c., he was utterly crushed byScipio (who received his surname, “Africanus,” as a result).

According toGiovanni Villani (Cron. 1.36–37), Pompey was among the generals at the siege.[return to English [part0010.html#c06-s18-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c06-s18-i]]55–72. [part0010.html#c06-s19-e] After seven tercets, each of which is devotedto one event (and sometimes more) in pre-imperial history, Dante will turn tohis gallery of Roman emperors, one that will eventually resemble no other suchlisting ever found. But he deals with the first of them, Julius, here.(Post-Shakespearean readers may need to be reminded that, for Dante andhistorians in his time, Julius [and not Augustus] was the first emperor.)Dante’s “life of Caesar” is immediately put (forced?) into a Christian context.It was Julius’s task to set the world in better order so that it would beprepared for the coming of Christ. Next Dante turns to Caesar’s militarytriumphs in Gaul (vv. 58–60). The six rivers mentioned in these verses mayderive from Lucan, Pharsalia I.399–434, as is suggested by Scartazzini (comm. toverse 58).The next four tercets (vv. 61–72) essentially recount the main Caesarean eventsof Lucan’s version of the civil wars between Julius and the republicans: (1) hiscrossing of the Rubicon and march on Rome (Phars. I–III); (2) his attack on therepublican forces in Spain (Phars. IV; see Purg. XVIII.101–102); (3) his landingon the Dalmatian coast in pursuit of Pompey (V–VI); (4) the battle of Pharsalus,with the death of Cato and flight of Pompey to Egypt, where he was betrayed andkilled by Ptolemy (VII–IX); (5) his tour of some sites of the Trojan War (IX);(6) his deposition of Ptolemy, placing Cleopatra in his stead (X); (7) hisdefeat of Juba, king of Numidia, one of Pompey’s supporters (not included in theunfinished epic, but since Juba is referred to at some length in Phars.IV.670–824, he was probably scheduled for a final, sad appearance); (8) a returnto Spain, where Caesar annihilated the remainder of Pompey’s followers (Lucanlooks forward to this last battle, at Munda, in Phars. I.40). While most ofthese events seem to have sources in Lucan’s text, and follow the order in whichthey occur in that text, what is utterly lacking is Lucan’s biting sarcasm aboutJulius so sharply felt in most of these scenes. Indeed, Dante’s own hostilitytoward Julius seems largely absent from this passage (see Stull and Hollander[Stul.1991.1], pp. 33–43, for discussion of Julius’s ups and [mainly] downs inDante’s eyes). In these lines, as in his presence as an exemplum of zeal inPurgatorio XVIII.101–102 (and see the note to the passage), only a positive viewof Caesar is appropriate, since he is seen here as the first and theologicallynecessary emperor of Rome. The reference to Troy (vv. 67–68) also seems to haveradically different purposes here and in Lucan; here it ties Julius to theTrojan founders of Rome, while there (Pharsalia IX.961–1003) it mocks hispretensions. See Mineo (Mine.1987.1), pp. 121–29, for the problematic nature ofDante’s changing views of Julius. [return to English [part0010.html#c06-s19-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c06-s19-i]]55–57. [part0010.html#c06-s19-e] For Dante’s similar sense of “kairos,” of the“fullness of time,” under Augustus, see Convivio IV.v.4–8, a text that alsoincludes the following details about the birth of Rome: “David was born whenRome was born—that is, when Aeneas came to Italy from Troy, which was the originof the Roman city, according to written records” (IV.v.6 [tr. R. Lansing]). Andsee Monarchia I.xvi.2: “That mankind was then [in the reign of Augustus] happyin the calm of universal peace is attested by all historians and by famouspoets; even the chronicler of Christ’s gentleness deigned to bear witness to it;and finally Paul called that most happy state ‘the fullness of time’[plenitudinem temporis]” (tr.

This nefarious crime of Julius is treated in this passageas a great and necessary step forward. See, however, Dante’s previous harshtreatment of Curio, who encouraged Julius to cross the Rubicon and march on Rome(Inf. XXVIII.97–99).

[part0010.html#c06-s25-e] See Inferno XXXIV.64–67 for Dante’s initialportrayal of this pair. Now he adds a detail: They are barking. In the previouspassage we are told that Brutus is silent, and Cassius is not described asuttering sounds. Their “next-door neighbor” in Cocytus, however, Bocca, doesbark (Inf. XXXII.105 and 108). Has Dante conflated that noise here? If we decidethat such a solution seems unlikely, we are faced with another loose end inParadiso (see the note to Par. III.34).

Cleopatra,fleeing before the imperial ensign, held aloft now by Octavian, did not chooseto die with her lover; she put herself to death by means of the bite of an aspthat she held to her breast (some commentators insist that she in fact employedtwo venomous snakes to do away with herself). Over the centuries many potentialsources have been cited for the mode of her suicide, which occurred only onceshe perceived that, unlike Julius, Octavian was firm against her charms andintended to take her back to Rome as a captive.

[part0010.html#c06-s27-e] For a possible source, see Aeneid VIII.685–688,where Antony is criticized for his deportment with Cleopatra (this scene is oneof those portrayed on the shield that Venus presents to Aeneas, Aen.VIII.626–731). As Fairclough points out in his note to this passage, the “ruddysea” is the Indian Ocean, not the Red Sea. The first commentator to cite thisphrase (litore rubro) in the Aeneid (VIII.686) was apparently Scartazzini (comm.to this verse). Most modern commentators also cite it, but, like Scartazzini,without noting that Virgil is not referring to the Red Sea. If he is in factciting the Aeneid, Dante either makes the same mistake his modern commentatorsmake or else forces the passage out of context, and has Augustus establishinghis dominion over that most propitious part of the Mediterranean world, whereChrist became flesh, as part of the plenitudo temporis (see the note to vv.55–57).

[part0010.html#c06-s28-e] “Tiberius Claudius Nero, stepson and adoptedson and successor of Augustus; Roman emperor, a.d. 14–37” (T). There isapparently a certain tongue-in-cheek quality to Dante’s words in support of hisselection of the third emperor in his most unusual pantheon. Julius is a bitproblematic, given even Dante’s own slurs on his character (see the notes toPurg. IX.133–138 and Purg. XXVI.77–78), but we understand that, for Dante andhis time, he was the first emperor and thus is a necessary presiding presence.About Augustus no one ever could (and no one ever has wanted to) complain. ButTiberius (not to mention Titus!) has caused more than a little discomfort. Andthe protagonist does indeed marvel at these words (in Paradiso VII.19–24). Butsee Monarchia II.xi.5: “Thus if Christ had not suffered under an authorisedjudge, that penalty would not have been a punishment. And no judge could beauthorised unless he had jurisdiction over the whole of mankind, since the wholeof mankind was punished in that flesh of Christ ‘who bore our sorrows’, as theprophet says. And Tiberius Caesar, whose representative Pilate was, would nothave had jurisdiction over the whole of mankind unless the Roman empire hadexisted by right” (tr. P. Shaw).Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 79–81) made clear his amazement at Dante’s havingincluded Tiberius among the great emperors, referring to him as “the worst sortof successor” to Augustus. (And see Benvenuto’s own list of seven emperors,dropping Tiberius and Titus in favor of Trajan and Constantine and addingTheodosius, in the outline of this canto.) It is possible that Dante’s “finallist” is indeed seven, since it eventually includes Henry VII or his successor(see the note to Par. XXX.133–138) as the seventh emperor in the line adumbratedhere.

[part0010.html#c06-s30-e] Justinian is making the case for the justnessof Christ’s death at the hands of the Romans (Pontius Pilate, acting as agent ofTiberius). This “vendetta” pursued by the Roman Eagle (as Justinian, inspired bythe justice of God even as he now speaks, insists) is what makes theaccomplishments of even Julius and Augustus seem paltry, for Christ’s deathatoned for all previous human sin and made sinners to come redeemable as well.Thus the apparently specious hyperbole in the passage regarding Tiberius (vv.82–91) must be seen as serious. His greatness is precipitated out of the eventhe presided over, the Crucifixion. See Carroll on vv. 82–90: “The wrath is thejust anger of God against the human race for its sins; and the ‘doing ofvengeance’ is the death of Christ, regarded as the bearing of the punishmentinflicted by that anger. The extraordinary thing is that Dante regards thecrucifixion as the supreme glory of Roman justice, inasmuch as it was the agentby which ‘the Living Justice’ ‘did vengeance for His wrath.’ ” [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c06-s30-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c06-s30-i]]88.

And see Inferno XXIX.55–57 and the note to vv. 54–57for Dante’s association of himself with similar inspiration, not to mentionPurgatorio XXIV.52–54.

For a clear explanation of this tercet, see Tozer (comm. to vv.91–93): “The repetition is that of the word vendetta in two differentapplications, corresponding to the twofold mission of the eagle; first itavenged God’s wrath against Adam’s sin (vendetta del peccato antico) by puttingChrist to death; then it took vengeance on the Jews for bringing about Christ’sdeath by the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.”Giorgio Padoan (Pado.1965.2), pp. 7–17, looks away from the canto of his LecturaDantis Romana (Par.

[part0010.html#c06-s32-e] Charlemagne gets short shrift as the sixth(Justinian does not, of course, refer to himself as a member of this elitegroup, but commentators have done so for him) and last of these“world-historical” emperors. See Tozer (comm. to these verses): “[W]henDesiderius, king of the Lombards, persecuted the Church, Pope Adrian I called inCharles the Great to its defence. [V]incendo: by his victory over Desiderius.The date of this was 774, and Charles was not crowned emperor of the West until800, so that at the time when it took place he was not under the protection ofthe Roman eagle (sotto le sue ali). Dante’s error here is of a part with hismore serious mistake in Mon. [III.xi.1] where he says that Charles was crownedemperor by Adrian I while the emperor Michael was on the throne ofConstantinople—whereas in reality he was crowned by Leo III during the reign ofIrene.” The process of translatio imperii has now been insisted on, as the Eaglehas flown out of Italy and into France. This tercet thus accomplishes a greatdeal, introducing and defending the concept of the Holy Roman Empire in thespace of three lines.

[part0010.html#c06-s33-e] Having finished with the “Roman” past ofimperial power, from Julius to Charlemagne, a period of just over eight hundredyears, Justinian now turns to the present political ills of Italy. This subjectis not treated as formally as the history of Roman institutions, but it is atonce clear that, for Dante, it is of extraordinary importance.

[part0010.html#c06-s33-e] For Justinian’s earlier references to Guelphsand Ghibellines and their battle over control of the sacrosanto segno (that mostholy standard), see vv. 31–33 and the notes to those verses and to verse 30. Ina real sense then, vv. 34–96 are a digression (they are referred to as a giunta[an addendum] at verse 30), only preparing for Dante’s pressing business, toshow how poorly ordered the political affairs of the peninsula were in his owntime.

[part0010.html#c06-s36-e] Charles II, king of Naples (ruled1289–1309), is referred to as “new” to distinguish him from his father, alsoking of Naples (and Sicily, in his case), who died in 1285. Justinian warns himnot to let his Guelph troops attempt to wrest the ensign of imperial rulershipfrom the Ghibellines (who have their own problems in meriting it), for theempire has defeated mightier enemies before.

[part0010.html#c06-s36-e] The imperial Eagle’s claws are portrayed ashaving “ripped the hides from larger lions” than Charles represents. The generalsense is clear, but there have been any number of interpretations of whatexactly is meant. The majority believes that there is no specific reference,only a generic prophecy of Charles’s doomed experiment with increasing hisdominions, should he try to accomplish that.

[part0010.html#c06-s38-e] In these two tercets Justinian explains thenature of what was lacking in these souls (as Ordiway has pointed out[Ordi.1982.1], pp. 82–85, it is the theological virtue of hope in its perfectedform). As the temporary Moon-dwellers displayed a marred version of faith, soJustinian and the others here, while they were alive, displayed hope in animmature form, rendering their love of God less vibrant than it should havebeen.

[part0010.html#c06-s40-e] In the following pair of tercets (thesetwelve verses indeed form a group, the two equal parts of which are joined by atriumphant “But”) Justinian, as has frequently been noted, sounds very much likePiccarda (Par.

We can safely assume that neither he nor Romeo wouldbe among the higher petals of the rose in Paradiso XXXII; but that only makesthem love God the more, for accepting them in Heaven with a history of suchgalling imperfections.

[part0010.html#c06-s41-e] This verse marks the third occurrence of thenoun giustizia in the canto, a density shared by only two previous cantos (Inf.III and Purg. XIX; however, see Par.

[part0010.html#c06-s43-e] Romeo, seneschal (chief steward) of RaymondBerenger IV, count of Provence: “The only foundation, apparently, for the story,adopted by Dante and Villani (vi.90), of the ‘pilgrim’ who became the ministerof the Provençal count, is the fact that the name of count Berenger’s grandseneschal was Romieu (or Romée) of Villeneuve. Romeo, a friend of Sordello(Purg. VI.74) was born c. 1170. In Aug. 1229 he was in Genoa as ambassador tothe podestà of that city, and in the same year was serving as Raymond Berenger’schief minister, and by him was granted certain possessions in Genoa and herterritories, and the next year received other properties. Early in 1241, onanother mission as ambassador, he became involved in a battle at sea, from whichhe escaped unscathed, even managing to capture a Pisan vessel laden withmerchandise which he had taken to Nice. On Aug. 19, 1245 Raymond Berenger died,leaving his daughter Beatrice his heir, and Romeo as ‘baiulus totius terrae suaeet filiae suae’ [guardian of all his lands and those of his daughter].

[part0010.html#c06-s44-e] Those courtiers, we suppose, who spoke illof Romeo to Raymond succeeded in forcing his removal from a position of trust(see vv. 136–139), but in the end suffered the tyrannical rule of Raymond’ssuccessors.

[part0010.html#c06-s45-e] When we read or hear Raymond’s name, we mayreflect on how many names or references to historical figures we haveencountered in this canto (all but two of them in the first 106 verses). Thetotal (Constantine, Aeneas, Lavinia, Justinian, Agapetus, Belisarius, Pallas,the Curiatii, the Horatii, the seven first kings of Rome, Sabine women, Lucrece,unnamed republicans, Brennus, Pyrrhus, Torquatus, Cincinnatus, the Decii, theFabii, Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, Pompey, Julius Caesar, Hector, Ptolemy, Juba,Augustus, Brutus, Cassius, Mark Antony, Cleopatra, Tiberius, Titus, Desiderius,Charlemagne, Charles II of Anjou, Romeo, and Raymond), even if we count someplural presences as single units, as here, is an impressive thirty-eight, andthat excludes the several-times-alluded-to Guelphs and Ghibellines. If we havebought into the discredited but still supported notion that in the last canticaDante has given over worldly concerns, it may come as something of a surprise tohave a canto in Paradiso make so obvious a gesture toward history.

[part0010.html#c06-s47-e] Where the opening verses of the canto implythe presence of Virgil, as author of the Aeneid, the concluding ones summon theimage of the exiled and “mendicant” Dante (cf. Par. XVII.58–60, Cacciaguida’sadmonition: “You shall learn how salt is the taste / of another man’s bread andhow hard it is / to go down and then up another man’s stairs”). See Mazzoni(Mazz.1982.1), p. 157; and see Woodhouse (Wood.1997.1), for a treatment inEnglish of Romeo’s resemblance to Dante: It is he who, “by recalling, in hisperson and in his name, Romeus, pilgrim to Rome, the tragic figure of Dantehimself” (p. 7). His name also binds the two seemingly disparate parts of thecanto, ancient and modern. This is a “Roman canto,” even when it turns itsattention to recent events in Provence; its first part is a sort of vernacularversion of a theologized Aeneid; its last, a comic (i.e., happily resolved)version of a lament for a courtier.

[part0011.html#c07-s01-e] If one were to select a single passage fromthe entire Commedia that seems most self-consciously wrought and thoroughlymarked by poetic exuberance, it might be difficult to find one more fitting thatdescription than this, with its opening mixture of Hebrew and Latin, themysterious “double light” glowing upon Justinian, the sudden departure of thatsoul and his dancing fellows, the protagonist’s wild excitement in hisbafflement over a theological question, and, finally, the linguistic playfulnessof the poet’s reference to Beatrice’s name. It is as though Dante wereapologizing in advance for the lack of poetic energy that typifies the rest ofthe canto, turned over to the theological needs of its protagonist as ministeredto by his guide.Canto VII almost seems to be offered as reassurance to readers with a religiousand/or theological bent that we’ve closed the books on Roman history and Italianpolitics and now will stick to our good Christian knitting—for a while, atleast. [return to English [part0011.html#c07-s01-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c07-s01-i]]1–3. [part0011.html#c07-s01-e] See Tozer’s translation and note (comm. to vv.1–3): “ ‘Hosanna, holy God of hosts, who by Thy brightness dost illuminate fromabove the happy fires of these realms.’ These verses appear to have been Dante’sown, not a hymn of the Church; but they are in Latin, to correspond to othermediaeval hymns. malacoth: as Dante required a rhyme for Sabaoth—no easy thingto find—he availed himself of the word malachoth, which he met with in St.Jerome’s Preface to the Vulgate, where it is translated by regnorum (realms).The proper form of this, which is read in modern editions of the Vulgate, ismamlachot, but in Dante’s time malachoth was the accepted reading.”For glossolalia (“speaking in tongues”) as a concern to Dante, see Hollander(Holl.1992.1). And see Di Scipio (Disc.1995.1), p. 281, for another assertionthat Inferno VII.1 is a parodic version of glossolalia. Sarolli, who almost getscredit for being the first writer to connect, in an oppositional relation, thefirst lines of this canto with those of the seventh canto of Inferno, “PapeSatàn, pape Satàn, aleppe!” (Saro.1971.1, pp. 289–90), also unaccountably urgesa reader to understand that the macaronic passage includes not only Hebrew andLatin, but Greek. (Tommaseo, in passing, does mention Inf. VII.1 in conjunctionwith the opening of Par. VII, thus depriving Sarolli of an honor he merits,since Tommaseo makes no effort to deal with the significance of the phenomenonhe has observed.)

This is the thirdconsecutive canto that begins with a speaker’s voice (rather than narration) andthe second consecutive canto to begin with the same speaker’s voice, both ofthese phenomena unique occurrences.Justinian’s first word of his last speech, Osanna, has a history in the poem:see Purgatorio XI.11 and XXIX.51. After this appearance, it also appears inParadiso VIII.29; XXVIII.118; and XXXII.135. Its six appearances make it themost present “foreign” word in the poem. The Ottimo hears its resonance from theshouts for the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem (e.g., Matthew 21:9). Benvenuto,discussing (comm. to Par. VIII.22–30) the word’s appearance in Paradiso VIII.29,has this to say: “Ista vox hebraica significat immensam affectionem mentis quaenon potest bene exprimi graece vel latine” (This Hebrew word signifies immensemental affection which cannot be properly expressed either in Greek or inLatin). The second Hebrew word in this line, sabaòth, is genitive plural “of thearmies” (or “hosts,” as Tozer translates, an English version of Latin hostis[enemy], but without its sense of opposition).For the program of song in the last cantica, see the note to Paradiso XXI.58–60.[return to English [part0011.html#c07-s01-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c07-s01-i]]3. [part0011.html#c07-s01-e] God is depicted as shining down from above andillumining these saved souls who, along with Justinian, have appeared to Dantein Mercury in the moments before they withdraw from Dante’s presence. [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c07-s01-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c07-s01-i]]4–5. [part0011.html#c07-s02-e] Justinian is now presented as a “substance,” anirreducible human soul, singing this holy song. We perhaps now understand whyDante has gone to such lengths to associate the emperor, inspired keeper of theRoman laws, and himself, inspired poet of empire, in the preceding canto (seePar. VI.11; VI.23; VI.88); their tasks are not dissimilar. [return to English[part0011.html#c07-s02-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c07-s02-i]]6. [part0011.html#c07-s02-e] The neologism s’addua is problematic. Readers aredivided as to what exactly the double light represents, and there are widelyvarious opinions. Mazzoni (Mazz.1982.1), p. 142, suggests that these lights are,the one, earthly, the other, heavenly, that is, the emperor’s past and presentidentities. Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse) are of the opinion that thelights are of the warrior and of the legislator. However, as we have seen in thepreceding canto, Justinian seems most eager to put the military life behind him(Par. VI.25–27); thus it would be strange for Dante to treat him in such wise.And see Jacoff (Jaco.1985.1), pp. 323–24, arguing for Virgil’s phrase“geminas … flammas,” the description of Augustus at the helm during the Battleof Actium, his brows casting a double flame, as he is portrayed on the shield ofAeneas (Aen. VIII.680, part of the same passage visited in the last canto: Seethe note to Par. VI.79–81). That seems a promising lead to follow. However, itwould probably be strange for Dante to have “borrowed” Augustus’s identity forJustinian. There is also a possibility that Dante is thinking of the passage inActs 2:3–4 in which the apostles are given the gift of glossolalia. Thereappeared to them cloven tongues of fire; these settled on each of them; theywere then filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak such languages as theSpirit gave them to utter. That is possibly reflected in what has been occurringin the opening lines of Canto VII; however, there may be a problem with the“dispertitae linguae tanquam ignis,” which may not be all that well described bythe phrase “doppio lume.” [return to English [part0011.html#c07-s02-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c07-s02-i]]8–9. [part0011.html#c07-s03-e] Whereas the souls in the Moon may have beenportrayed as vanishing downward into the matter of that body (Par. III.122–123),these pretty clearly travel a great distance upward very rapidly. Dante has nowgot his logistics under control: The souls that appear in the planets return tothe Empyrean once they have completed their mission, which is to instruct Dante.[return to English [part0011.html#c07-s03-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c07-s03-i]]10–12. [part0011.html#c07-s04-e] This is the third and final time Dante usesrepetitions of the word dì (see Purg. XXXI.5 and Par. V.122 for identical pairedpresences of the imperative form of dire) to give a greater sense of intensityto a speaker’s urging. The first two times Beatrice is speaking to theprotagonist; now Dante speaks to himself, in phrasing that is still moreinsistent.The tercet, a dizzying display of alliteration (there are nine d sounds in threelines), also contains a possible pun. Beatrice’s “sweet drops” in Italian (dolcistille) sound reasonably like Bonagiunta’s new sweet style (dolce stil[e] novo[Purg. XXIV.57]), which he attributes to Dante’s poetry in praise of Beatrice.The likelihood of intention behind such a play on words is increased by thepresence of the same three rhymes later on in this canto, vv. 53–57 (nodo, ch’i’odo, and modo) as are found in Purgatorio XXIV.53–57. These are the only twooccurrences of these constituents of terza rima in the poem; that they occur atthe same numerical placemarks (vv. 53, 55, 57) is hardly conclusive evidence,but doesn’t hurt the case, either.

[part0011.html#c07-s04-e] For Dante’s phrase “dolci stille” (sweet drops),see Chiamenti (Chia.1995.1), p. 178 (see also Sarteschi [Sart.1999.1], p. 186),indicating a possible source in Augustine, Confessiones XIII.30.45: “Et audivi,domine deus meus, et elinxi stillam dulcedinis ex tua veritate” (And I heard, OLord my God, and drank up a drop of sweetness out of Thy truth [tr. E. B.Pusey]). [return to English [part0011.html#c07-s04-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c07-s04-i]]13–15. [part0011.html#c07-s05-e] In an exerted tercet, the poet says that hebowed his head, under the sway of his devotion to Beatrice, just as does a manwho nods off to sleep. For the same phrase, “t’assonna,” see Paradiso XXXII.139.There it precedes the vision of the Godhead, featuring the miracle of theIncarnation. It is perhaps not accidental that this is a central subject inBeatrice’s long disquisition that begins at verse 19 and runs the rest of thecanto.

[part0011.html#c07-s05-e] Surely what is meant is “any part of her name,”but we may want to reflect that the parts referred to just happen to be thefirst and the last, mirroring, perhaps, the alpha and omega that represent God.“Bice” was, of course, Beatrice’s nickname (see Vita nuova XXIV.8, the ninthline of the sonnet “Io mi senti’ svegliar dentro a lo core”: “monna Vanna emonna Bice,” where Dante observes Guido Cavalcanti’s lady, Giovanna, precedinghis lady, Beatrice.)

[part0011.html#c07-s06-e] Some commentators try to associate the foco withthe fires of Hell, but it seems more likely that Dante is saying that Beatrice’ssmile had the power to calm even one who had been set on fire. And seePurgatorio XXVII.10–54 for Dante’s hesitant encounter with the purging flames ofthe terrace of Lust. [return to English [part0011.html#c07-s06-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c07-s06-i]]19–24. [part0011.html#c07-s07-e] Had not Justinian just spoken at even greaterlength, this would have been the longest single speech in the poem, extending130 lines from verse 19 to the end of the canto (148). The passage beginninghere is described by Carroll (comm. to vv. 10–66) as “the chief theologicaldiscourse in the Paradiso.” All the rest of the canto is, in fact, a Beatriceancommentary on two passages in the preceding canto, first (vv. 19–51) Justinian’spresentation of Titus’s doing “vengeance for vengeance” in his destruction ofJerusalem (Par. VI.91–93), second (vv. 52–120) his previous claim that Tiberius,by having sovereignty when Christ was put to death (Par. VI.89–90), took“vengeance” for God’s wrath by presiding over the Crucifixion. It is interestingthat Dante makes his two unusual choices for a short list of the mostsignificant Roman emperors the focus of Beatrice’s commentary in verse.This stylistic tour de force (having Beatrice, presented playfully in the fifthcanto as the author of the poem [vv. 16–17], now reappear as the commentator ontwo passages from the sixth canto) is not calculated to set enthusiasts of lyricpoetry aflutter. Terza rima is about the only thing poetic that we find in therest of the canto, as Beatrice’s language is Scholastic-sounding and severe, herinterests only instructional, and correctively so.

[part0011.html#c07-s07-e] The only other appearance of the wordinfallibile occurs in Inferno XXIX.56, where it modifies giustizia.

It isthis for which the Word of God chose, in his love for humankind, to offerHimself as flesh in sacrifical atonement for all sin since Adam.

[part0011.html#c07-s11-e] This tercet includes reference to the twoother aspects of the triune God, the Sapience represented by the Son having beenmentioned in verse 30 (where Beatrice refers to the Word becoming flesh); thePower represented by the Father, “Maker” of all things; the Love represented bythe Holy Spirit.

[part0011.html#c07-s12-e] Humankind, a combination of immortal soul andmortal body, as present in Adam and Eve, quickly (for exactly how quickly, seePar. XXVI.139–142) turned from God to sin, and was sent out of Eden. If wemeasure what was done to Christ upon the Cross by the enormous burden of sin Hetook on, His penalty was utterly just; if, on the other hand, we measure theworth of the one who was punished, no greater outrage was ever committed,especially when we consider what He had voluntarily consented to.

[part0011.html#c07-s13-e] The verse repeats, as Benvenuto da Imola (comm.to vv. 34–39) was perhaps the first to realize, Christ’s dictum (John 14:6) “Egosum via, et veritas, et vita” (I am the way, and the truth, and the life).

[part0011.html#c07-s16-e] The paired results of Christ’s sacrifice areexpressed in a chiasmus: The death of Jesus pleased (a) God and (b) the Jews; itcaused both (b) the earthquake at the Crucifixion and (a) the opening of Heavento humankind. The Jews took perverse pleasure at the killing of Jesus for whichreason God made the earth shake, expressing His displeasure; at the same time,and of far greater importance, God accepted Jesus’ sacrifice and opened Heavento redeemed humanity.

[part0011.html#c07-s17-e] Beatrice’s repetition of the adjective giusta(just) underlines her main concern for Dante, that he understand that God neveracts unjustly. She has taken care of his first doubt, which arose from whatJustinian said about the reign of Titus. [return to English[part0011.html#c07-s17-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c07-s17-i]]52–120. [part0011.html#c07-s18-e] Next Beatrice turns to the problem thatarose for the protagonist in Justinian’s remarks about the reign of Tiberius.This is one of the most pernicious stumbling blocks for nonbelievers and evensome Christians. It is the question posed (and answered) by Beatrice here (seeScartazzini’s lengthy gloss to this passage, which deals with Dante’s complexdiscussion clearly). The two main sources for Dante’s thinking about thejustification for the death of Jesus on the Cross are, according to Scartazzini,St. Thomas (ST III, q. 46, a. 1–3) and St. Anselm of Canterbury (Cur Deus homo).For insistence on the primacy, for Dante’s thinking on this subject, of Anselm’stract, see Fallani (Fall.1989.1), pp. 233–34. [return to English[part0011.html#c07-s18-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c07-s18-i]]52–63. [part0011.html#c07-s18-e] Now, reading Dante’s mind, Beatrice sees whatis troubling him; there must have been some other way for human sin to have beencanceled short of having the incarnate Godhead be slain upon a cross. Beatricewarns that her proof will be difficult, because only those nourished over timeby the warmth of God’s affection ever understand this mystery, that is, onlythose inspired by the Holy Spirit are able to understand the love for humankindthat impelled Jesus to give up his life for us.

[part0011.html#c07-s19-e] From Lombardi (1791, comm. to vv. 56–57) toGrabher (1934, comm. to vv. 55–63), most commentators think the word pur heremeans “only.” Starting with Trucchi (1936, comm. to vv. 52–57), the tide beginsswinging to proprio (precisely, exactly); Chimenz (1962, comm. to vv. 56–57)prefers this meaning to “only,” as do Bosco/Reggio (1979, comm. to vv. 56–57);as our translation indicates, we do, too.

[part0011.html#c07-s22-e] Tozer’s summary of these passages may behelpful: “Man, inasmuch as his soul proceeded direct from God, possessed thegifts of immortality, free will, and likeness to God, and on these depended hishigh position (vv. 64–78). By the Fall the freedom of his will and his likenessto God were impaired, and his position was lost (vv. 79–81). There were only twoways by which he could recover this, i.e., either (1) that he should makesatisfaction himself for his sin, or (2) that God in His mercy should pardon himfreely (vv. 82–93). The former of these it was impossible for man to do, becausehe could not render any adequate recompense; it remained therefore for God toguarantee his pardon (vv. 94–105). This God did in a manner at once mostconsonant with His own nature, as being perfect Goodness, and most advantageousto man, and most in accordance with the demands of justice. He followed both theway of mercy and the way of justice. By the Incarnation and death of Christ Heenabled man to regain his lost position, and at the same time made thesatisfaction for his sins which justice required” (vv. 106–20).

[part0011.html#c07-s22-e] For an attempt to demonstrate the closenessof the thought here to that found in Plato’s Timaeus, see Fraccaroli(Frac.1906.1), pp. 393–97, disputing the more usual nineteenth-century claim ofa dependence upon Boethius. However, see Richard Green’s note to the passage, inhis translation of the Consolatio (Gree. 1962.1), p. 60, pointing out that thepoem (“O qui perpetua mundum ratione gubernas” [O you who govern the world witheternal reason]) in Boethius (Consolatio III.m9) is recognized as being anepitome of the first section of the Timaeus. Among the early commentators,Pietro di Dante (comm. to vv. 64–78) cites Boethius (“Rather it was the form ofthe highest good, existing within You without envy, which caused You to fashionall things according to the external exemplar”), while Benvenuto da Imola (comm.to vv. 64–66) and Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 64–75) cite Timaeus 29e (theopening of Book I): “Optimus erat, et ab optimo omnis invidia relegata est” (He[the god who made universal disorder into order] was good: and in the good nojealousy in any matter can ever arise [tr. F. M. Cornford]—Plato is speaking ofthe divine mind, as is Boethius). For more support of Plato’s candidacy andgeneral consideration of the problem, see Galimberti (Gali.1968.1), pp. 227–35.Sapegno (comm. to vv. 64–66) was perhaps the first to cite both (Boethius, Cons.III.m9.1–6; Plato, Tim. I). Giacalone (comm. to vv. 64–66) offers helpfuldiscussion and a bibliography. [return to English [part0011.html#c07-s22-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c07-s22-i]]67. [part0011.html#c07-s23-e] Those things created directly, that is, withoutmediation, by God include the angels, the heavenly spheres, unformed matter(e.g., the earth’s surface, awaiting the formal intervention of God to be givenits definitive shape), and the rational part of the tripartite human soul.

[part0011.html#c07-s38-e] Dante employs hysteron proteron yet againto mark either end of human history, the last night of life on earth (see theApocalypse) and the first day (see Genesis). In the period of time sectored inthat arc no greater act ever was or shall be than Jesus’ act of self-humiliationto save humankind. [return to English [part0011.html#c07-s38-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c07-s38-i]]124–138. [part0011.html#c07-s42-e] This passage and the rest of the canto dealwith the ontology of God’s creation, specifically the distinctions between thenature of being in that which is created directly by God (things eternal or,more properly, since they have a beginning in time, sempiternal) and in thatwhich, though created by God (for nothing that exists owes or can owe itsexistence to any other first cause), has other participation in its making(i.e., they are made by the intervention of other already existent things, asare almost all things that we encounter: butterflies, the cliffs of Dover,rain). On this question see Moore’s late essay, “Dante’s Theory of Creation”(Moor.1917.1), pp. 134–65, and the stern response by David O’Keeffe(Okee.1924.1); Moevs’s discussion (Moev.2005.1), pp. 122–26, agrees withO’Keeffe’s objections to Moore’s formulations, which underlie many later(mis)understandings of the basic cosmic views put forward here by Beatrice, andwhich, as a result, are incorrect. As Moevs points out (pp. 123–24), Beatricefears lest Dante, mistaking her words at vv. 67–69, fail to distinguish betweenprimary creation (i.e., directly by God) and secondary creation (God acting incollaboration with other agents). As Moevs rightly insists, for Dante there isno such thing as creation independent of God; but there is (1) direct creationand (2) indirect creation; in the latter other agents besides the deity have arole. All such entities, Beatrice concludes, are “mortal,” including the fourelements. This passage is not made easier by its frequent use of the pastparticiple of the verb creare. The word creature at verse 127 has the sense of“things created” (by God). But this, mirroring the protagonist’s confusion,blurs the crucial distinction that Beatrice will make; all things are created byGod, some few directly (and they are eternal or, to use the correct term,sempiternal) but most parts of the made universe, as the four elements,indirectly. At verse 131 creati also refers to divine creation, but this time(and for the only time in this passage) of direct creation by God, and hence ofeternal things, both angels and the heavenly spheres. In verse 135 creata refersto the secondary creation of the informative power in the stars, as it does inboth of its iterations in vv. 136 and 137. The next could not be clearer, butits use of the same term, creare, for both kinds of creation, primary andsecondary (i.e., direct and indirect), makes a reader’s task more difficult.[return to English [part0011.html#c07-s42-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c07-s42-i]]124–129. [part0011.html#c07-s42-e] This is the second consecutive canto inwhich Dante has not spoken (he is in fact silent from Par. V.129 until Par.VIII.44 [for his considerably longer period of abstention from speech, see Par.IX.81–Par. XIV.96]). In this canto his suppressed speech is reported (but notuttered) at vv. 10–12 and Beatrice speaks his doubt for him in vv. 55–57 andthen once more here in this passage. [return to English[part0011.html#c07-s42-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c07-s42-i]]139–144. [part0011.html#c07-s47-e] For a paraphrase of the first tercet, seeTozer (comm. to vv. 139–141): “From speaking of things without life Beatricepasses to those which possess the sensitive or the vegetative life without therational soul. These also are not incorruptible, because their life is producedmediately by the influence of the stars, acting on those elements of theirnature (i.e., of the matter of which they are composed) which are capable ofbeing affected by them. ‘The brightness and the motion of the holy lights (thestars) draws forth the life of brutes and plants from the combination ofelements (complession) in them, which is endued with power (potenziata)thereto,’ i.e., to be so affected. Complession in its technical use means ‘acombination of elements,’ e.g., of humours of the body, or properties ofmatter.” And see Moevs (Moev.2005.1), p. 125, on this passage: “The souls of allplants and animals are ‘drawn from’ varying compounds of the sublunar elements(complession potenzïata) by the influence of the stars, but human life (thehuman intelligence or rational soul) ‘breathes directly’ from the ‘supremebeneficence,’ from Intellect-Being itself. That is why the human mind or soul isalways in love with, and never ceases to seek union with, the ground of itsbeing, of all being.” [return to English [part0011.html#c07-s47-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c07-s47-i]]145–148. [part0011.html#c07-s49-e] Moevs (Moev.2005.1), pp. 130–132, pointsout an error underpinning some commentators’ responses to the Danteanformulation of a central theological issue in this canto: the corruptibility ofthe first bodies given to humankind directly by God. Their usual position isthat this body, created as home of the soul in both Adam and Eve, wasincorruptible; thus its “true nature” is incorruptible, despite original sin;with resurrection we regain that incorruptible body. But what, we may ask, ofthe damned? Clearly their bodies are not of the incorruptible kind, since thedamned all-too-painfully recollect the corruptions of the body and liverepeating them eternally, as we have seen often enough in Inferno. That is anegative argument, if perhaps a useful one. Moreover, and as Moevs, followingO’Keeffe (Okee.1924.1), pp. 61–62, points out, the argument is heretical on itsown terms. No Christian authority ever said that the human body was eternal,even in its original Edenic condition (but exactly this opinion is found amongsome commentators; see, e.g., Fallani [Fall.1989.1], p. 236, holding that it isindeed immortal). And so the question arises: Will we be given what weoriginally had, a corruptible body washed clean of its sins (unlike the maculatebody that is the property of anyone damned), as our soul has been? Or will wereceive a truly incorruptible body? In one way of understanding, the body hasalways been, and always will be, corruptible (even if, resurrected, it will notdecay anymore). To triumph in it is also to triumph over it. Moevs concludes histreatment of this problematic passage as follows (p. 132): “Beatrice hasre-expressed the great Clementine dictum that God became man so that man maylearn from man how to become God.” But see Paul’s discussion of the raising ofthe dead in I Corinthians 15:35–54, which certainly seems to promiseincorruptible flesh to those who participate in the general resurrection.[return to English [part0011.html#c07-s49-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c07-s49-i]]PARADISO VIII [part0011.html#c08-e]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1–12. [part0011.html#c08-s01-e] The elaborate and classicizing beginning ofthe canto is marked by fully six verbs in the imperfect tense (solea, raggiasse,faceano, onoravano, dicean, pigliavano). (For a characterization of theireffect, see Ragni’s response, cited in the note to vv. 13–15.) This is one ofthe longest “single-sentence” canto-openings up to this point in the poem,superseded only by Inferno XXIV.1–15. [return to English[part0011.html#c08-s01-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s01-i]]2. [part0011.html#c08-s01-e] Venus is “Cyprian” because she was born on theisland of Cyprus. [return to English [part0011.html#c08-s01-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c08-s01-i]]3. [part0011.html#c08-s01-e] Two words in this verse may benefit from closerattention. The verb raggiare is here used in the imperfect subjunctive, thusconnoting a certain dubiety about the pagan opinion that the planet Venus wasresponsible for errors of erotic adventure. Compare Convivio II.vi.9: “… therays of each heaven are the paths along which their virtue descends [directlyfrom the planet itself] upon these things here below” (tr. R. Lansing). Dante isspeaking of Venus there, as he is here. For awareness of this connection, seePoletto (comm. to vv. 1–12).The concept epicycle (epiciclo), another example of hapax legomenon, was theinvention of ancient astronomers because their calculations of planetarymovement, based on the belief that the earth was the center of the universe,around which the planets revolved, needed regularizing. And thus all the planetsexcept the Sun supposedly had epicyclical movement. Here is Tozer on the natureof that motion (comm. to vv. 1–3): “The term ‘epicycle’ means a circle, thecentre of which is carried round upon another circle; cp. Convivio[II.iii.16–17]. To account for the apparent irregularities in the orbits of theheavenly bodies which resulted from the view that they revolved round the earthwhich was stationary, Ptolemy suggested that each planet moved in such a circleof its own in addition to the revolution of the sphere to which it belonged. Inthe case of Venus this is called the third epicycle, because the sphere of Venusis the third in order in the heavens.”And see Carroll (comm. to vv. 1–21): “Translating all this into its spiritualequivalent, the meaning appears to be: as Venus had one movement round the Earthand another round the Sun, so these souls had two movements of the heart, cyclicand epicyclic, one round some earthly centre, the other round God, of whom theSun is the natural symbol.” [return to English [part0011.html#c08-s01-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c08-s01-i]]4–6. [part0011.html#c08-s02-e] The second iteration of the word “ancient”flavors the first, which looks innocent enough when first we notice it: “ancientpeoples” is not ordinarily a slur. But it becomes one once it is conjoined with“ancient error,” at once represented by the slaughter of innocent animals(“sacrifice”) and nefarious vows (“votive cry”).

[part0011.html#c08-s03-e] Now to the amorous “pantheon,” featuring thepagan goddess Venus, are conjoined her mother, Dione, and her son, Cupid. Thesethree divinities constitute a sort of pagan trinity: Mother, Daughter, Holy Son.[return to English [part0011.html#c08-s03-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c08-s03-i]]9. [part0011.html#c08-s03-e] See Convivio IV.xxvi.8 for Dido and the promiseof eventual further reference to her in the seventh treatise, which, of course,was never completed. Is this Dante’s fulfillment of that promise?Pietro Alighieri (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 7–9) cites the Virgilian passage,including the line (Aen. I.718) in which Dido’s name, accompanied by gremio(translated by Dante’s grembo, “lap”), appears, a line that describes Venus’smaternal ruse, placing Cupid in Dido’s lap disguised as Ascanius.Paratore (Para.1989.1), p. 250, points out that the presence of Dido in thiscanto is yet another connection to Inferno V, such as others find revealed invv. 32–33, 38–39, 45.

However, Vellutello (comm. to vv. 10–12) expands hermeaning into the familiar “two Venuses,” the first earthly and carnal, thesecond heavenly and spiritual. He does not say so, but Dante is possibly loadinghis phrase with a double sense, talking both about the carnal Venus, withreference to whom he begins this canto, and also his spiritual awakening in hislove for Beatrice. [return to English [part0011.html#c08-s04-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c08-s04-i]]12. [part0011.html#c08-s04-e] The meaning is that the Sun courts Venus, nowfrom behind her (at her neck), now approaching her from the front (his attentionfixed on her brow). The celestial phenomenon referred to is the epicyclicalmovement of Venus around the Sun, in which she moves from west to east,describing a circle around the circumference of her sphere, which, like everyplanetary sphere, is itself moving in a westerly direction. Thus the counteringmotion of the planet itself, on its epicycle, takes her from a position in whichshe has the Sun behind her in the morning, when she is known as Lucifer, to onein which she has him before her in the evening, when she is known as Hesperus.As Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse) point out, Venus is not both morning starand evening star on the same day, a fact of which Dante is aware (Conv.II.ii.1). [return to English [part0011.html#c08-s04-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c08-s04-i]]13–15. [part0011.html#c08-s05-e] Once again the poet allows us to wonder howthe protagonist, especially if he is in fact in the body (see Par. I.99),manages to penetrate the physical matter of the planets.Ragni (Ragn.1989.2), pp. 137–39, points out that the imperfect tense used in thelong opening passage (vv. 1–12) is now replaced by the past definite as we movefrom the hazy distant pagan times and into the hard-edged recent experience ofthe reality of the Christian afterworld beheld by the protagonist.It is notable that the rising into the next planet on its epicyclical sphere isaccomplished in a single tercet. By comparison, the arrivals in the Moon (Par.II.19–30) and in Mercury (Par. V.86–99) both take considerably more poeticspace.

[part0011.html#c08-s06-e] The five tercets that serve as introductionto Venus are followed by another five tercets that serve to introduce the soulsof the saved who descend from the Empyrean to greet Dante here (Charles Martelin this canto, Cunizza, Folco, and Rahab in the next; the last three clearly areassociated with an inclination toward carnal love that impaired their moralfunction, a fact that calls into question the reasons for Charles’s presencehere [see the note to vv. 55–57]).Dante employs first a double simile (vv. 16–21) and then an implicit simile (itis one in content, if not quite in form, vv. 22–27) to describe these souls,before reporting on what they do (vv. 28–30), which is to sing “Hosanna.”[return to English [part0011.html#c08-s06-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c08-s06-i]]17–18.

And so they quite reasonablyconclude that Dante is referring to the Primum Mobile, where the angelic dancehas its beginning with the Seraphim and moves down through the spheres (where wecatch a glimpse of it here).

[part0011.html#c08-s11-e] One of the souls (we will eventually be ableto recognize him as Charles Martel, although he is never named) comes forward tospeak for all of them. Indeed, his opening remarks (which conclude at verse 39)are not in any way personal. He in fact is the mouthpiece for all those who havecome down. That will no longer be true once Dante asks him who he is, when hehas reason to personalize his response. [return to English[part0011.html#c08-s11-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s11-i]]34–39. [part0011.html#c08-s12-e] Charles informs Dante that here they arewhirling with the Principalities, the order of angels that govern the heaven ofVenus, which Dante had once (incorrectly) said was that of the Thrones (Conv.II.v.6). He now has firsthand experience of exactly how wrong he was.Dante is obviously revising a previous opinion about angelology. (For theclarification that in Convivio he had followed the views of Gregory the Great asfound in the Moralia, but here as found in his Homilies, see Muscetta[Musc.1968.1], p. 258.) However, something far worse than a scholarly slip by anamateur of angelic lore is probably at stake here. The first ode of Convivio,the opening verse of which is cited, specifically rejects Beatrice in favor ofLady Philosophy. And a good deal of energy in the Commedia is put to the task ofretracting the views that reflect that wrongful love. Some scholars, rejectingthis notion, point out that Dante never gives over his predilection forphilosophical investigation (e.g., Scott [Scot.1995.1], Dronke [Dron.1997.1],and Scott again [Scot.2004.2], pp. 126–29). Such a view is surely correct yetmay be said to miss the point: Dante needs to separate himself from his choiceof Lady Philosophy over Beatrice, and this requires jettisoning certain of hisphilosophical baggage, especially that displayed in the first decade of thefourteenth century, that is, not Aristotle, but perhaps Plato (author of theTimaeus) and/or the neoplatonist Proclus (see the note to Par. IV.24); notAristotle, but perhaps the “radical Aristotelians” (see Corti [Cort.1983.1]).The modern notion of a palinodic aspect in Dante’s more mature view of hisearlier work, in particular Convivio, featuring a certain amount of sternremonstrance on the part of the author of the Commedia against his younger self,began perhaps with Freccero, “Casella’s Song” (1973) (reprinted in Frec.1986.1,pp. 186–94). His position was shared by Hollander (Holl.1975.1), Jacoff(Jaco.1980.1 [to a lesser degree]), Barolini (Baro.1984.1 [also to a lesserdegree]), pp. 31–40, 57–84; and see Hollander (Holl.1990.1). For a considerablyearlier understanding of the conflict between the two Dantes, see GiovanniFederzoni’s note (Fede.1920.1) to vv. 36–39: “The reason for the reference tothe canzone here is that the amatory life, to which the spirits encountered inthis planet offered themselves, the Epicurean existence condemned by theausterity of the Christian religion, is, on the contrary, justified by paganphilosophy, the philosophy that Dante himself celebrated in the second treatiseof the Convivio and most of all in this very canzone.” And now see Picone(Pico.2002.3).

[part0011.html#c08-s13-e] While the literal sense of his remark is clearlythat staying still and quiet to welcome Dante will be no less sweet to them thanare their whirling dance and accompanying song, Charles’s way of implicitlyreprimanding Dante for his divagation from Beatrice is courtesy itself: “let ournot singing your ode seem a favor to you.” Compare Casella’s singing of the odefrom Convivio III in Purgatorio II and Cato’s rebuke.

[part0011.html#c08-s14-e] While Dante turns to Beatrice to gainpermission to pose a question to these souls, it seems likely that he might havelooked at her to see if she is reflecting upon his disloyalty when he turnedaway from her to the donna gentile. But he has been through Lethe, and himselfcannot remember his fault. But if he cannot remember, we can. He did not behaveso reverently to her memory in Convivio, when, as he tells it, after the deathof Beatrice he read Boethius and Cicero looking for consolation (silver) and, inhis reacquaintance with philosophy, found gold (Conv. II.xii.4): “I who soughtto console myself found not only a remedy for my tears but also the words ofauthors, sciences, and books. Pondering these, I quickly determined thatPhilosophy, who was the lady of these authors, sciences, and books, was a greatthing” (tr. R. Lansing).

[part0011.html#c08-s15-e] Here we find the much-debated phrase “Deh, chisiete?” Perhaps the solution is simpler than the discussion surrounding it mightindicate. In 1894, Poletto (comm. to vv. 40–45) made the only sensiblesuggestion that this is not only the correct reading (there is much textualevidence on its side, as Scartazzini demonstrated [comm. to vv. 43–44]), but (aseven Scartazzini failed to see) more than acceptable phrasing on Dante’s partand a perfectly sensible way for the protagonist to frame his question: “You(the one to whom I am speaking), say who all the rest of you are” (i.e., atleast the three others whom we will meet in the next canto).

[part0011.html#c08-s17-e] Charles presents himself as the good ruler,whose early death deprived Europe of his many virtues, but also unleashed theevil of others who came to power in his absence from the scene. “Charles Martel,eldest son of Charles II of Naples and Anjou and Mary, daughter of Stephen IV(V) of Hungary; he was born in 1271; and in 1291 he married Clemence ofHabsburg, daughter of the Emperor Rudolf I, by whom he had three children,Charles Robert (Carobert) (afterwards king of Hungary), Clemence (married LouisX of France), and Beatrice; he died at Naples in 1295 at the age of 24” (T). Hedied, narrowly predeceasing his wife, Clemenza, of the plague, although somewere of the opinion that he had been poisoned. Dante’s other great hope, for hisown political ends as well as his idealistic sense of the imperial role ofItaly, Henry VII, had died recently (24 August 1313). That event, dashing evenDante’s unrealistic hopes for the triumph of the principle of restored imperialleadership, probably colored his reflections about the untimely death of Charleseighteen years earlier.

[part0011.html#c08-s18-e] Carroll (comm. to these verses) has this tosay about this tercet: “It is a mistake to say, as is sometimes done, that thisis a mere temporary concealment due to the sudden increase of joy caused by thismeeting with his friend. Doubtless there was this increase of joy, and thereforeof light, for Dante expressly says so (Par. VIII.46–48); but from the very firsthe describes them as ‘lamps’ and ‘sparks’ within a flame [see the note to verse19]. There is no indication that at any time he saw them in their own properforms.” [return to English [part0011.html#c08-s18-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c08-s18-i]]55–57. [part0011.html#c08-s19-e] Whatever fantasy Dante may have had of abetter (nonexilic) existence had Charles remained alive and a power on thepeninsula, his use of the verb amare and the noun amore in this tercet, spokenby Charles in Venus, shows how the poet has reconceptualized the nature of lovefrom Dido’s kind to spiritual friendship (see the note to Inf. II.61). For anessay on the two Venuses, see Landino’s proem to this canto. Pertile(Pert.2001.1), p. 60, is not alone in objecting that Charles does not seem to bepresent here in the role of lover, if Cunizza, Folchetto, and Rahab (found inthe next canto) all do. Indeed, his lengthy self-presentation (vv. 49–84) isexclusively political in nature. For an attempt to link Charles and Venus, seeBoyde (Boyd.1993.1), p. 285: “Perhaps we are meant to infer that the rays ofVenus may dispose a ‘gentle heart’ to disinterested friendship, as well as toluxuria.” That is a reasonable response to Dante’s situation of Charles in thisplanet. Nonetheless, Benvenuto da Imola portrays Charles as a “son of Venus”(comm. to vv. 31–39): “fuit vere filius Veneris quia amorosus, gratiosus, vagus,habens in se quinque invitantia hominem ad amorem, scilicet, sanitatem,pulcritudinem, opulentiam, otium, et juventutem” (… he was indeed a son ofVenus, amorous, graceful, eager, possessing five qualities that promote a man’sdisposition to love, i.e., good health, physical attractiveness, wealth,leisure, and youth).Ragni (Ragn.1989.2), pp. 145–52, shows that Dante’s presentation of CharlesMartel accords with his presentation of the ideal ruler in Monarchia(I.xi.6–18).See Arnaldi (Arna.1992.1), pp. 55–56 (cited by Picone [Pico.2002.3], p. 124) forthe appealing notion that, when Charles visited Florence in 1294, he and Dantemet in the environment of S. Maria Novella, where at this period visiting headsof state were customarily lodged and where Dante may have also been involved.See his own words: “I began to go where she [Philosophy] was truly revealed,namely to the schools of the religious orders [Dominicans at S. Maria Novella,Franciscans at S. Croce] and to the disputations held by the philosophers”(Conv. II.xii.7—tr. R. Lansing). Thus the context of Dante’s new “love” (for theLady Philosophy) is understandably referred to. It must have permeated his andCharles’s discussions at the time, as may be evidenced by Charles’s reference tothe first ode of the Convivio, usually dated to around this time (ca. 1293–94).[return to English [part0011.html#c08-s19-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c08-s19-i]]58–63. [part0011.html#c08-s20-e] The familiar technique of locatingterritories by their watery limits is employed here to identify Provence, partof the dowry (see Purg. XX.61) of Beatrice, daughter of Raymond Berenger, wifeof Charles I of Anjou, and grandmother of Charles Martel. Upon the death of hisfather, Charles II (who in fact survived him by fourteen years, dying in 1309),he would have inherited the titles to lordship as Count of Provence.The second tercet points to southern Italy, where Charles would have inheritedkingship over the kingdom of Naples (as a result of the Vespri Siciliani [1282],no longer of Sicily as well): “The kingdom of Apulia in Ausonia, or Lower Italy,embracing Bari on the Adriatic, Gaeta in the Terra di Lavoro on theMediterranean, and C[a]tona in Calabria; a region bounded on the north by theTronto emptying into the Adriatic, and the Verde (or Garigliano) emptying intothe Mediterranean” (Longfellow’s comm. to verse 61).

Crowned in absentia (1292), in Aix, he never exercised hisrights to rulership, a king in title only. Hungary is farther along the Danube,past Austrian lands (“its German banks”), to the east and south. [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c08-s22-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s22-i]]67–75. [part0011.html#c08-s23-e] The fourth realm, which might have beenCharles’s to lose by his untimely death had not it already been lost because ofthe Sicilian Vespers (1282), was actually referred to in Dante’s time by itsclassical name “Trinacria” (see Bosco/Reggio, comm. to vv. 67–70), possibly toavoid reminding people that the kingdom of Sicily (currently an independententity, under the control of the House of Aragon) used to contain theterritories of Naples.Picone (Pico.2002.3), p. 127, following Arnaldi’s suggestion (Arna. 1992.1, pp.51, 57), thinks that Dante may here be imagining a second cultural “golden age”in Sicily if Charles and his heirs had only governed the island.

[part0011.html#c08-s23-e] Pachynus and Pelorus are the ancient namesfor Capes Passero and Faro, which form “arms” that stretch out at either end ofthe eastern shore of Sicily (the present-day Gulf of Catania). For Pelorus, seethe note to Purgatorio XIV.31–42. [return to English [part0011.html#c08-s23-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c08-s23-i]]70. [part0011.html#c08-s24-e] Tifeo (Typhon [or Typhoeus]), also referred toby the variant Tifo (Inf. XXXI.124), was a hundred-headed monster who attemptedto acquire power over all creatures. Jupiter struck him down with histhunderbolt and buried him in Tartarus under Mt. Aetna, the eruptions of whichwere supposedly due to his exertions to escape (see Ovid, MetamorphosesV.346–358, where Typhon’s two hands are said to be pilloried by Pelorus andPachynus). Dante dispenses with “classical erudition” in the name of “modernscience”: The clouds of smoke hanging over the area are not the result ofTyphon’s struggles to escape, but of sulphur burning in the earth. For thisexplanation, Tozer (comm. to verse 72) suggests that Dante found a source inIsidore of Seville (Etym. XIV.8).

[part0011.html#c08-s25-e] The so-called Vespri siciliani were begun at thehour of Vespers on Easter Monday of 1282 in Palermo.

[part0011.html#c08-s26-e] The debate over the most likelyinterpretation of these lines goes back to the fourteenth century, one school ofinterpretation insisting that the phrase “l’avara povertà di Catalogna” (thegreedy poverty of Catalonia) refers to the Spanish courtiers who will accompanyCharles’s brother Robert to Italy once he is “put on” (in 1309), the other, thatit is Robert’s own avarice that is worthy of a Spaniard. The firstinterpretation currently is the most favored, but counterarguments are presentedby Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet) and Picone (Pico.2002.3), pp. 128–29.Picone (p. 128n.) argues that antivedere does not here have its usual meaning(“see in advance”), but refers to a past event (a necessary choice if onebelieves that the event referred to does not lie in Robert’s future). However,see the note to vv. 79–84. And see Barolini (Baro.1984.1), p. 65n., documentingthe three other appearances of the verb in the poem (Inf. XXVIII.78; Purg.XXIII.109; Purg. XXIV.46). In all four contexts the prediction of futureoccurrences is the subject.Charles’s brother was a great enemy to Henry VII. Less than a year after Henry’sdeath, on 15 March 1314, Pope Clement V announced Robert’s appointment asimperial vicar, a position that Henry had held. Robert reigned as king of Naplesuntil 1343, long enough, that is, to place the laurel wreath on Petrarch’s headon 6 April 1341. Dante was spared knowledge of that coronation. If Canto VI isabout the triumphs of Rome, this canto is concerned with political defeats,those suffered by Charles and by Dante: Charles’s death brought his brother tothe throne and into collaboration with Clement. [return to English[part0011.html#c08-s26-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s26-i]]79–84. [part0011.html#c08-s27-e] Robert and his “ship of state” (the kingdomof Naples) are already so heavily burdened with difficulties that it is ingreater danger of foundering if it is loaded with still more deadweight. SinceRobert’s avarice is already “on board,” that comes close to ruling out thesecond interpretation of verse 77 (see the note to vv. 76–78), leaving theavarice of his Spanish followers as the better reading. For barca with thissense (“ship of state”), see Paradiso XVI.96. [return to English[part0011.html#c08-s27-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s27-i]]82. [part0011.html#c08-s28-e] This verse has long been the cause of dispute:To whom precisely does the phrase “worthy stock” refer? Since Charles’sfollowing discourse centers on the differing virtues of fathers and sons (withfathers generally getting the better of the comparisons), some suggest that thereference here is to the otherwise despised Charles II of Anjou, CharlesMartel’s father (see, e.g., Lombardi, comm. to vv. 82–84, for this view). Tozer(comm. to vv. 82–84) finds justification in such a reading in Paradiso XIX.128,where the elder Charles is granted a single virtue (and thus a certain nativeliberality). As uncomfortable as it may leave one feeling, that is perhaps thebest available gloss. [return to English [part0011.html#c08-s28-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c08-s28-i]]83. [part0011.html#c08-s28-e] This also is currently a disputed verse. What isthe reference of the noun milizia? It was only in the twentieth century, withTorraca’s complex and interesting gloss (comm. to vv. 82–84), that thepossibility that the word might refer to soldiers is even broached. All who havea previous opinion are certain that the word refers to administrators,government officials, or the like. We have accepted their view for ourtranslation. It allows, by the way, the understanding that the members ofRobert’s Spanish entourage may be included in the group, which perhaps accountsfor Bosco/Reggio’s insistence that the word refers to “mercenary soldiers”(comm. to this verse), a reading in which they are the first.

[part0011.html#c08-s29-e] Dante tells Charles that he is glad on twocounts, first that his royal friend knows of Dante’s gladness without hisneeding to express it; second, that he knows of it in God, because he is saved.[return to English [part0011.html#c08-s29-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c08-s29-i]]91–93. [part0011.html#c08-s31-e] Dante continues by wondering, on the basis ofvv. 82–83, how a good father can have a bad son. See Picone (Pico.2002.3), pp.129–31, for a clarifying discussion of this passage and the rest of the canto,which, he argues, relies for its basic point on a biblical text, the parable ofthe sower (Matthew 13:3–23).

[part0011.html#c08-s33-e] Tozer (comm. to these verses) summarizesCharles’s thoughts: “The argument is as follows: God, in creating the universe,provided not only for the existence of things, but for their working in the mostperfect manner; and the instrumentality which He appointed for that purpose wasthe stellar influences, which are directed by the angels or Intelligences whopreside over them: Were it not for these, chaos and not order would prevail.”[return to English [part0011.html#c08-s33-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c08-s33-i]]97–99. [part0011.html#c08-s33-e] God sets the mark of his Providence upon hiscreatures, not through his direct creation (which is reserved for the individualhuman soul), but indirectly, through the stars and planets associated with theeight lowest celestial spheres. This arrangement maintains human freedom of thewill and yet allows God the role of ordering his Creation, thus avoiding chaos(see verse 108). [return to English [part0011.html#c08-s33-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c08-s33-i]]100–102. [part0011.html#c08-s34-e] God foresees not only the nature of thecomposite human soul (not only the part that he makes directly, the rationalsoul, but the animal and vegetative souls, that he helps shape indirectly, byagency of the celestial bodies), but its ultimate perfection as it prepares toleave its body. The word salute, as readers of the Vita nuova (where it alsopuns on saluto [salutation]) will recall, is utilized by Dante in such ways asto run the gamut from physical “health” to more generalized “well-being” toChristian “salvation,” and it probably has polyvalent significance here. [returnto English [part0011.html#c08-s34-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s34-i]]103–105. [part0011.html#c08-s35-e] The image of an arrow striking its markonce again meets the reader’s eyes (see Par. I.119 and V.91). If one had to pickone passage in the poem that might lead a reader to believe that Dante’s view ofpredestination verges on determinism, this tercet might be a popular selection.Yet, once we reflect on the way Dante has held back, avoiding dangerousformulations in the previous tercet, we can sense that he is both aware of thepitfall and determined to avoid it. For the wider meaning in Dante’s use of theverb disporre (verse 104), see the note to Paradiso XXX.138. [return to English[part0011.html#c08-s35-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s35-i]]106–108. [part0011.html#c08-s36-e] As he concludes his “lecture” onpredestination, Charles makes it clear why he has had to come so close to theshoals of determinism, where, after Augustine, many Christian thinkers have comeclose to sinking: If God does not order the universe, it would not have anyorder at all. Nature, left to its own, would produce only chaos, as King Leardiscovered. Insistence on God’s control of so much of the field of human actionmight seem to whittle away the uses of free will to a point approaching nullity.Yet Dante, through Beatrice (see Par. V.19–24), has already insisted on theefficacy of God’s greatest gift to humankind. [return to English[part0011.html#c08-s36-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s36-i]]109–111. [part0011.html#c08-s37-e] Charles ends his exposition by an argumentfrom impossibles. For God and his informed angels to produce chaos, they wouldhave to be deficient, and that is impossible.

[part0011.html#c08-s38-e] This brief exchange may remind readers ofthe similar sort of question-and-answer drill performed by Socrates and one ofhis “student” interlocutors (whose response is the deferential “yes, Socrates”that still strikes readers as comical) in Platonic dialogues. As Bosco/Reggiopoint out (comm. to verse 114), Dante is here citing an Aristotelian maxim,“Nature never fails to provide the things that are necessary,” which he alsocites in Convivio IV.xxiv.10, Monarchia I.x.1, and Questio 44.

[part0011.html#c08-s39-e] Aristotle again sets Charles’s agenda; seethe opening of the Politics: “Man is by nature a political animal” (the LatinAristotle in fact said that he is a civile [civic] one, thus accounting forDante’s cive, which we have translated as “social”).

[part0011.html#c08-s40-e] To the next proposition (that diversityamong humankind is desirable [see Aristotle, Politics I.i.2]), Charles himselfsupplies Dante’s agreement (the poet having in fact already done so in Conv.IV.iv.5, when he speaks not only of the social needs of human life, but of theneed for diversity of occupation among the members of the community). [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c08-s40-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s40-i]]121. [part0011.html#c08-s41-e] The poet now characterizes Charles’s method ofargumentation as “deductive,” reminding the reader of the Scholastic style ofhis conversation.

[part0011.html#c08-s41-e] And so, Charles concludes, your naturaldispositions to take up one thing or something else must differ one fromanother. It results that, in order to have leading practitioners of variousnecessary human tasks, one of you becomes Solon (a legislator), another Xerxes(a general), still another Melchizedech (a priest), and finally Daedalus (anartisan). These four “orders” of society include the most necessary activities.Why Dante chose to identify Daedalus by the tragic flight of his son, Icarus, isnot clear, unless we are to understand the reference as blending with the nexttopic (as some commentators do), the differences between members of the samefamily.

[part0011.html#c08-s43-e] See Tozer’s paraphrase and interpretationof these lines: “ ‘[T]he nature of the revolving spheres, which, like a seal onwax, imprints itself on mankind, exercises its art well, but does notdistinguish one house from another.’ In other words: The stellar influencesproduce individuality of character in men, but do not favour one family morethan another by perpetuating excellence in it. Dante is returning to thequestion, How can a bad son proceed from a good father?” [return to English[part0011.html#c08-s43-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s43-i]]127. [part0011.html#c08-s43-e] The word natura is focal to this discussion.Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 37, points out that its seven appearances in thiscanto represent the heaviest concentration of the word in the poem. That isabout one-eleventh of its roughly seventy-seven occurrences. [return to English[part0011.html#c08-s43-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s43-i]]130–132. [part0011.html#c08-s44-e] Quirinus was the name given to Romulus,Rome’s first king, posthumously, when he was celebrated as a god. His mother,Rhea Silvia, a Vestal Virgin (in some versions of the story), gave birth totwins and claimed that Mars had lain with her. Daniello (comm. to this tercet)may have been the first to refer, in this context, to Virgil (Aen. I.292–293).But see Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet), who “adjusts” the Virgilian passage tothe more appropriate verse 274, where, according to Virgil, Ilia (another namefor Rhea Silvia?), a priestess, bears to Mars her twin offspring, Romulus andRemus. (It is striking that neither here nor anywhere in this or in his otherworks does Dante mention Remus, Romulus’s twin, especially here, given the factsthat he has just considered Jacob and Esau and that their story has obvioussimilarities to that of this pair of emulous fraternal twins, one of whom[Romulus] eventually killed the other.) And thus Dante’s view (and the standardview in the commentaries) is at some variance from Virgil’s presentation of theimmortal bloodlines of the founder of Rome. See, for example, Umberto Cosmo(Cosm.1936.1), p. 78, referring to the fact that: “… il figlio di un ignotoplebeo può accogliere in sé la virtù di fondare una città come Roma, e saliretanto alto nella riputazione universale da esser ritenuto per disceso da un Dio”(… the son of an unknown commoner may harbor the potency exhibited in founding acity like Rome, in making his way to the pinnacle of general approbation so asto be considered descended from a god [Mars]). In the instance of Jacob andEsau, Dante would seem to be interested only in making the point that twins maydiffer from one another, while in that of Romulus and his unnamed plebeianfather, the difference involves father and son. But the reader, as Dante musthave known, will also consider Remus as a Roman Esau. [return to English[part0011.html#c08-s44-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s44-i]]133–135. [part0011.html#c08-s45-e] Charles finishes with a flourish: The livesof fathers would always map in advance the lives of their offspring (we mustremind ourselves of the sexually skewed biology sponsored by the poet in Purg.XXV.43–48, which has it that only the paternal seed shapes the humancharacteristics of the infant [the rational soul is inbreathed directly byGod]). Thus, were it not for the mediating “interference” of Providence rayeddown by the stars, we would all be precisely like our fathers.

[part0011.html#c08-s46-e] As Heilbronn points out (Heil.1984.2), pp.45–46, this phrasing joins with that found in vv. 11–12 and 95–96 to connectwith a passage in Convivio (II.xiii.14): “and [rhetoric] appears in the morningwhen the rhetorician speaks before the face of his hearer, and it appears in theevening (that is, behind) when the rhetorician speaks through writing, from adistance.” Whether or not Dante’s associations of the planets with the sevenliberal arts in Convivio is binding in Paradiso is a question that remains to besettled, but, at the very least, a certain skepticism seems called for. It isprobably just to reflect that, had he wanted to insist on these identities, heeasily could have. That he did not would seem to make their application heredubious.

[part0011.html#c08-s47-e] In the guise of sound practical advice,Dante levels his guns at Robert, as we shall see in the concluding lines of thecanto. Paratore (Para.1989.1), pp. 260–62, gives evidence that reveals Dante’saccord in this view of Nature with that expressed by St. Thomas in his Summacontra Gentiles (III.80–81).Raoul Manselli, “Carlo Martello” ED I (1970), p. 843a, thinks of Hugh Capet, ofwhom Charles Martel turns out to be the only “good fruit” (Purg. XX.45). [returnto English [part0011.html#c08-s47-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s47-i]]142–144. [part0011.html#c08-s48-e] If we feel that we are hearing the voice ofRousseau in these lines, we should remember that natura naturata is the resultof a process very much under the control of God through his instruments, thestars. As we have just learned, God intervenes not only directly, when Hecreates our rational souls, but indirectly, in controlling our innatepropensities through the stellar influences. Thus today it might seem anexpression of a Dantean point of view whenever we hear an athlete or a singerreferring to his or her “God-given talent.” [return to English[part0011.html#c08-s48-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c08-s48-i]]145–147. [part0011.html#c08-s49-e] A part of John S. Carroll’s gloss to vv.137–148 is worth having: “There is little doubt that Charles is referring to twoof his own brothers. Louis, the next to himself in age, almost immediately afterhis release from captivity in Aragon, renounced his hereditary rights, joinedthe Franciscan Order, and was made Bishop of Toulouse [Louis died in 1297 andwas canonized in 1311]. This renunciation of the sword, for which Danteevidently thought him better fitted, gave the throne to his younger brotherRobert, who had in him more of the preacher than the king. Villani says of him:‘This King Robert was the wisest king that had been among Christians for fivehundred years, both in natural ability and in knowledge, being a very greatmaster in theology and a consummate philosopher’ [Chronicle, xii.10]. Robert wassurnamed ‘the Wise.’ Petrarch, who regarded him as the king of philosophers andpoets, submitted to be examined by him for the space of two days and a half, inthe presence of the entire Court, on every known branch of learning. Gregoroviussweeps aside Robert’s claims to wisdom with contempt: ‘The King enjoyed anundeserved reputation as a lover of learning, and was himself the author oftedious lucubrations on religious and profane questions.’ His character remindsus of James, ‘the British Solomon,’ who held that ‘a sovereign ought to be themost learned clerk in his dominions,’ and took himself seriously as a greattheologian.” [return to English [part0011.html#c08-s49-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c08-s49-i]]PARADISO IX [part0011.html#c09-e]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1–6. [part0011.html#c09-s01-e] For a fair-minded consideration of thispassage, about which it may at first seem difficult to formulate a definitiveopinion, see Oelsner’s gloss (comm. to vv. 1–6). He points out that a reader isfaced with a choice between “two impossibilities,” either the poet is addressingClemenza, Charles’s dead wife, or his daughter, of the same name, for whosepresence here there are even more decisive problems. And it should be pointedout that the intimacy of that familiar “tuo” at least implies relationship(Dante had once seen Charles’s Clemenza, according to Chimenz [comm. to verse1], in 1281, when she was thirteen, on her way to Naples, but had no dealings ofany kind with his daughter, married to the king of France). In addition, theplural “vostri” refers to Clemenza (“tu”) and at least one other, most likelyCharles’s and her son, Caroberto. Chimenz (comm. to vv. 5–6) finds this lastpiece of evidence decisive, referring to those who actually lost something tothe political chicanery of King Robert. However, perhaps the single mostconvincing piece of negative evidence deals with the detail that led to theobjection that there is something odd or impossible in Dante’s addressingCharles’s dead wife. Against this frequently offered objection, Porena (comm. tovv. 1–3) indicates that Dante on several other occasions apostrophizes the dead,for example, Constantine (Inf. XIX.115), Saul (Purg. XII.40), Rehoboam (Purg.XII.46), and Buondelmonte (Par. XVI.140). It thus seems overwhelmingly likelythat Dante presents himself as addressing the Clemenza who was Charles’s wife.[return to English [part0011.html#c09-s01-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c09-s01-i]]7. [part0011.html#c09-s03-e] This is the first appearance of the word vitawhen it has the meaning “living soul” in the poem. It is used 23 times inInferno with its usual meaning (“life,” in various senses), and then 24 times inPurgatorio. In Paradiso it is used 32 times in all, but, to indicate a soul ingrace, only here (of Charles) and then of five other denizens of Heaven, asfollows: Paradiso XII.127 (Bonaventure), XIV.6 (Thomas), XX.100 (Trajan), XXI.55(Peter Damian), and XXV.29 (James). Gragnolati (Grag.2005.1), p. 242, n. 5, issimply incorrect when he states that the “same term ‘vita’ is used throughoutthe Comedy to define the human soul.” [return to English[part0011.html#c09-s03-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c09-s03-i]]8–9. [part0011.html#c09-s03-e] As we will learn in vv. 95–96, Folco is swathedin the light of his glory, as a saved soul. Here Charles turns to God(metaphorically, the Sun), the source of his own brightness; if you are filledwith that light, there is no need of anything else.

[part0011.html#c09-s04-e] This has not always been included amonglistings of addresses to the reader (see the note to Inf. VIII.94–96), butsurely should be. (Previous addresses to the reader in Paradiso have occurred atII.1–18 and V.109–114.) Some may have realized that it is one, but the first tosay as much is Daniello (comm. to this tercet), and he has been followed by onlya few others, none in the current age of Dante studies. A probable reason forsuch reticence is the missing main verb. Nonetheless, it is clearly addressed toliving mortals and, at least inferentially, to readers of the poem. To whomelse?

[part0011.html#c09-s04-e] The rhyme position is possibly the cause ofDante’s choice of tempie (literally, “temples,” but here, in metonymy, “head”).Indeed, half of the six uses of the word in the poem occur in rhymes.

(The second part, vv. 37–42, serves to introduce the second speaker ofthe canto, Folco of Marseilles, while the third and longest part, vv. 43–63, isdevoted to the troubles that the March of Treviso soon shall experience.)Cunizza (ca. 1198–1279), after a long life of love affairs (Jacopo della Lanasays that she was in love at every stage of her life [comm. to vv. 32–33]), cameto Florence in April 1265 and signed a notarial document freeing her familyslaves in the house of Cavalcante de’ Cavalcanti (seen in Inf. X), father ofDante’s friend Guido. She was still alive in 1279 and probably died soon afterthat. [return to English [part0011.html#c09-s09-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c09-s09-i]]25–28. [part0011.html#c09-s09-e] Tozer (comm. to these verses): “The place ofwhich Dante speaks in line 28 as situated on a low hill is the castle of Romano,the patrimony of the Ezzelini. The exact position of this spot is not known, butthe part of Italy which is here described as situated between Rialto and the‘fountains’ of the Brenta and the Piave is the Marca Trivigiana, which laybetween Venice (here represented by the island of Rialto) and the neighbouringpart of the Alps, in which those two rivers rise.” Ezzelino da Romano(1194–1259) was a Ghibelline leader, famed for his oppressive ways. “Ezzelino,whose lordship over the March of Treviso lasted for more than thirty years, wasa ruthless and bloodthirsty tyrant, and was guilty of the most inhumanatrocities.… In 1255 Pope Alexander IV proclaimed a crusade against Ezzelino,styling him ‘a son of perdition, a man of blood, the most inhuman of thechildren of men, who, by his infamous torture of the nobles and massacre of thepeople, has broken every bond of human society, and violated every law ofChristian liberty.’ After a war of three years’ duration, in the course of whichhe committed the most terrible atrocities, Ezzelino was finally defeated (Sept.16, 1259) by the marquis of Este at Cassano, where he was desperately woundedand taken prisoner. Eleven days after, having torn open his wounds, he died inhis prison at Soncino, at the age of 64, after a reign of thirty-four years”(T). [return to English [part0011.html#c09-s09-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c09-s09-i]]29–30. [part0011.html#c09-s10-e] We have seen Ezzelino briefly (with hismenacing black hair) in Inferno XII.109–110. Pietro di Dante tells the followinganecdote about him (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 31–33): “When his mother was close toparturition, she had a dream that she was giving birth to a flaming torch (facemigneam) that was setting afire the entire area of the March of Treviso.”In fact, it may be Ezzelino who is responsible for his sister’s presence inParadiso, if only because he was the subject of Albertino Mussato’s Ecerinis,the first Senecan tragedy written in the postclassical age, which along with hishistorical account of Henry VII was the reason for his receiving the laurel in atumultuous ceremony at Padua at Christmas 1315. Padua was in many respects themost advanced center for the birth of early forms of humanism in Italy. Theexchange of Latin verse serving as letters between Giovanni del Virgilio andDante (ca. 1320) included an invitation to Dante to write a Latin poem aboutmajor Italian political figures and then to come to Bologna for his laureation,an offer clearly counting on Dante’s emulous feelings toward Mussato (1261–1329)and desire to be laureated himself, as Dante comes close to admitting in theopening lines of Paradiso XXV. For what had been a neglected aspect of Dante’srelationship with other writers, see Manlio Pastore Stocchi (Past.1966.1) andEzio Raimondi (Raim.1966.1). The first points to several passages in Dante,including the Epistle to Cangrande, which perhaps ought to be consideredpolemical against the never-mentioned Mussato. Raimondi, on the other hand,indicates several passages in Mussato, including a brief account of a dream ofthe afterworld that he had in Florence that was caused, it turns out, by stomachproblems, a fairly obvious shot at the rival whom he, like that rival, nevernames. And see Arnaldi (Arna.1966.1) for more on the differing reactions toCunizza and Ezzelino on the part of Mussato and of Dante. For the state of thequestion in 1970, see Guido Martellotti, “Mussato, Albertino,” ED III (1970).While Martellotti admits that there is no hard evidence connecting these twowriters (p. 1068a), he suggests that verses 25–33 are possibly a sly attack onMussato (p. 1067b). It may seem that Dante and Mussato had no cause for mutualdislike. Both were champions of Henry VII (of whom Mussato was the historian ofhis Italian activities). But Mussato despised the Scaligeri, and especiallyCangrande. In fact, in an event almost certainly referred to in vv. 46–48, thebattle at Vicenza in September 1314, not only was Mussato present to fightagainst Cangrande, he was taken prisoner by that lord (see Benvenuto [comm. tovv. 46–48]: “multi capti sunt, … et Mussatus poeta” [many werecaptured, … including the poet Mussato]) and brought back to Verona, where hewas treated less like a prisoner than an honored guest. One story thatcirculated had it that when Cangrande, impressed by Mussato’s bravery in battle(he was wounded several times and yet, in his desire to avoid capture, leapedinto the castle moat, out of which he was pulled by Cangrande’s troops), came tosee him in his comfortable quarters in the Scaliger castle, which served as hisdungeon, and asked whether he could have a few words with his prisoner, Mussatoreplied that surely he might, but only if he were able to converse in Latin. Wedo not know how long Mussato was held prisoner in Verona, but not for very long,one supposes. But we do know that Dante was a resident of that castle at thisperiod. It would seem inconceivable that Mussato was not much on Cangrande’smind and tongue. One can imagine Dante having to listen to his patron’s lavishpraise of this “other poet” who was “given the laurel,” who was such a greatLatinist, and who had put up such a brave fight in combat. It must have beengalling.As Bosco/Reggio remark (comm. to this canto, Intro.), this canto is more datablethan most, referring to a number of events that occurred in 1314 and 1315. Thusit may have been written hot on the heels of the news of Mussato’s laureation atthe close of 1315. If the original plan for the canto called for the presence ofFolco alone, perhaps including his presentation of Rahab, Dante may have decidedto add another woman (it is a rare canto in the Commedia that has two women instarring or major supporting roles; only Paradiso III, with Piccarda andConstance, comes to mind) because Cunizza offered Dante a way to address thequestion of Mussato through her brother (who enjoys brief enough treatment here,but several lines more than he receives in Inferno XII). [return to English[part0011.html#c09-s10-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c09-s10-i]]31–33. [part0011.html#c09-s11-e] Cunizza now identifies herself both as thesister of the “firebrand” and as, in the words of Benvenuto da Imola (comm. tovv. 13–15), “recte filia Veneris” (indeed a daughter of Venus). The words sheuses to do so might suggest that she dwells permanently in this planet, asPompeo Venturi (comm. to vv. 32–33) seems to believe. (For a later instance inthe canto that seems indeed to indicate that Rahab was “assumed” by Venus, seethe note to vv. 119–123.)It has been difficult for commentators to accept Dante’s salvation of Cunizza.Some show their hostile disbelief (she was, according to Benvenuto [comm. to vv.31–36], “widely known to be a whore” [famosa meretrix], but he goes on to findher youthful conduct excusable [he does not mention her mature amorousadventures]). Meretrix was a label affixed to her on a half dozen otheroccasions (deriving from an unpublished early commentary), while others attemptto put forward the unbelievable claim that she only affected the manner ofcarnal lovers. For the amply documented list of Cunizza’s various love affairsand marriages, including a famous fling with the poet Sordello during her firstmarriage, see Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 32–33) and Baranski (Bara.1993.2).(Sordello names himself at Purg. VI.74 but is present in the poem during fourcantos, until the protagonist goes to sleep at the beginning of Canto IX.) ToDaniele Mattalia (comm. to verse 32) she is a modern version of Rahab (but whatservice she performed for Church or state he does not say); however, Mattalia(comm. to verse 32) is apparently the only commentator before the seventhcentenary observations in 1965 to face the question of the relation of thepresent situation of Cunizza in the afterworld to her eternal one, and he seesthat they are different (what Dante would consider a correct view), but he thengoes on to make a further distinction unwarranted by the text: She will be inthe same rank in the Empyrean as Venus is in the heavens, that is, “in the thirdlevel of merit/happiness (merito-felicità).” Again, see the note to vv. 119–123.[return to English [part0011.html#c09-s11-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c09-s11-i]]31. [part0011.html#c09-s11-e] Cunizza’s formulation, once we consider that onesibling is seen by Dante in Hell while the other addresses him from this planet,is surely meant to remind us of the remark of Charles Martel about the differingnatures of members of the same family (Esau and Jacob) in the last canto(VIII.130–131).

[part0011.html#c09-s12-e] Cunizza is saying that she no longerbegrudges herself her sins because she neither feels the impulse that led tothem nor the remorse that followed them (both in the world and in Purgatory),which were washed away by Lethe. See the similar view of Francesco da Buti(comm. to vv. 25–36), dealing with the notion that Dante is contradictinghimself when he presents Cunizza as remembering her sins. Folco will state theproposition a little more clearly than she does in vv. 103–104: “Here we don’trepent, but smile instead, / not at our fault, which comes not back to mind” butat God’s Providence, that foresaw the sin and its redemption. The “common herd”will not understand that she is not wracked by penitential thoughts of her sins.[return to English [part0011.html#c09-s12-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c09-s12-i]]37.

[part0011.html#c09-s13-e] Dante would seem to hold to two positions,one “orthodox” in its condemnation of vainglory (see Purg. XI.100–102, wherefame in the world is but a “gust of wind,” variable and of short durance) andone less so, if still more or less acceptable in a Christian universe, renownedfor the performance of good deeds. While the commentators are not of oneopinion, it does not seem likely that Dante here is talking about the vain sortof fame, but of the second sort. See the even stronger positive evaluation ofsuch renown in Paradiso XVIII.31–33, that enjoyed by the last souls whom Danteobserves in the heaven of Mars, those who in the world made such a mark “thatany poet’s page would be enriched” by containing their names.

[part0011.html#c09-s14-e] Most readers take this line as we do, that is,this century marker shall occur five more times before Folco’s fame dies down.There was apparently a tradition, if it is referred to derisively by St.Augustine (Enarr. Ps. 6.1), that the history of humankind, from Adam untilJudgment Day, would last 7,000 years. That would, according to Dante’s timeline, make human history on this earth extend roughly to the year 1800, since6,498 years have passed since God formed Adam (see Par. XXVI.118–123).

Here (if not all thecommentators are in accord with this view), it clearly refers to extraordinarygoodness, which lives on after one has died, forming a model for others tofollow.

Cunizza first foretells the disastrous defeat of the GuelphPaduan army in the fall of 1314 in Vicenza, a Ghibelline city that it hadretaken the day before, only to be completely routed in a surprise attack by asmall imperial force led by Cangrande. For more on this battle, and the role ofAlbertino Mussato in it, see the note to vv. 29–30. [return to English[part0011.html#c09-s16-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c09-s16-i]]49–51. [part0011.html#c09-s17-e] Next Cunizza prophesies the brutal death ofRizzardo da Camino, ruler of Treviso (1306–12), murdered in his own palace whileplaying chess by a peasant wielding a pruning hook. He was married to a daughterof Nino Visconti (see Purg. VIII.53) in 1308. Thus Dante would have probablylooked with special disfavor on his notorious philandering, which may have beenthe motivating cause for his murder. As Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet)point out, Dante nods here in the present tenses of the verbs in vv. 50–51:Rizzardo was not ruling the city in 1300, nor was the plot to kill him beinghatched in that year.The presence of Rizzardo here is perhaps intended to remind the reader of thehigh praise lavished upon his father, captain-general of Treviso (1283–1306),“il buon Gherardo” of Purgatorio XVI.124. See also Convivio IV.xiv.12, with itspraise of Gherardo and mention of the rivers Sile and Cagnano. Thus we have hereanother of the examples, so dear to Dante, of the unpredictability of nobility’sbeing passed on through the seed of a noble father. “Good wombs have borne badsons” is King Lear’s version of this reflection.

Alessandro Novello, a Trevisan,was bishop of Feltre (1298–1320). In 1314 he gave three Ferrarese brothers,Ghibellines, refuge in the city, but then turned them over to the Guelphs ofFerrara, who cut their heads off.

(There were at least six prisons in Italythat bore the name Malta.) But it is also possible that Dante meant whatPetrocchi thought he did (a generalized sense of “prison”). If, however, he wasreferring to a particular place, most recent discussants prefer the choice ofthe prison for ecclesiastics situated in Lake Bolsena.

[part0011.html#c09-s21-e] Cunizza concludes her speech by remindingDante of the actual location of the angelic order of Thrones, “above,” that is,just below the Cherubim (and thus third from the highest rank, occupied by theSeraphim). For the implicit rebuke to Dante, both here and there, see the noteto Paradiso VIII.34–39.

[part0011.html#c09-s24-e] The meaning is fairly clear: Here in Paradise(là sù) a living soul, grown more joyful, becomes more refulgent; on earth(qui), a person, made happier, smiles; in Hell (giù), a damned soul, caused tofeel greater sadness, darkens in its outer aspect. We never actually see suchchange in Inferno. This is another example (cf. Inf. XVI.106–108; Inf.XX.127–129) of Dante adding details to his descriptions of earlier scenes.[return to English [part0011.html#c09-s24-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c09-s24-i]]73–81. [part0011.html#c09-s25-e] The protagonist’s nine verses indulge inrhetorical flights and playful reproof. For “fancy” rhetoric, consider Dante’sthree coinages (vv. 73 and 81), which spectacularly turn pronouns into verbs(“to in-him,” “to in-you,” “to in-me”) at either end of his address to Folco.And then there is his mock impatience with his interlocutor for holding histongue when Folco can surely see, in God, Dante’s eagerness to know his story.Is this the most “literary” pose we have as yet watched and heard theprotagonist assume? Whatever its degree of novelty, it is a delight to observe.When we look back from Paradiso XIV.96, we realize that these were the lastwords spoken by the protagonist until then. This is by far the longest stretchin the poem in which he remains silent, from here near the end of his stay inVenus, right through his time in the Sun, until just after his arrival in Mars.[return to English [part0011.html#c09-s25-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c09-s25-i]]77–78. [part0011.html#c09-s26-e] It is probably no accident that Dante speakshere of the Seraphim, the highest order of angels and associated with thehighest form of affection, spiritual love. Folco was, after all, a poet ofcarnal love, but one who transformed himself into a better kind of lover when hetook orders and then when he became God’s flail for heresy. Starting with Jacopodella Lana (comm. to vv. 73–79) and the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 73–78), the earlycommentators found biblical sources of the six wings of the Seraphim either inthe Apocalypse or in Ezechiel. However, beginning with Lombardi (comm. to vv.77–78), the consensus had moved to Isaiah 6:2, the only passage specificallynaming them in the Bible: “And above [the Lord’s throne] stood the seraphim;each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he coveredhis feet, and with two he did fly.” [return to English [part0011.html#c09-s26-e]/ Italian [part0021.html#c09-s26-i]]82–93. [part0011.html#c09-s28-e] The poet, through the words of Folco, locatesthe Mediterranean, the second largest sea on the earth’s surface after Oceanus(verse 84), which surrounds all the land on our globe, on the map of Europe.Moving from west to east, Folco makes the Mediterranean extend 90 degrees inlatitude, more than twice its length in modern cartography. Folco places hisbirthplace, the as-yet-unnamed Marseilles, between the Ebro’s mouth in Spain andthat of the Magra, in Italy, which separates Liguria from Tuscany. Nearlysharing the time of both sunrise and sunset, Folco continues, his native cityand Bougie (on the North African coast) thus nearly share the same meridian oflongitude. This rebus leads a patient reader to his city’s name. Carroll (comm.to vv. 82–92), at least in part to excuse the twelve-verse periphrasis for “Iwas born in Marseilles,” insists that Folco is looking down, from the epicycleof Venus, with an astronaut’s view of the Mediterranean, and describing what hesees.

His poems, written in Provençal roughly between 1180 and 1195,were known to Dante, who praises them highly (if the only one referred to is hiscanzone “Tan m’abellis l’amoros pensamen” [So greatly does the thought of loveplease me]), naming him by his more familiar name as poet (Folchetus in Latin,which would yield Folchetto in Italian, as many indeed do refer to him) in Devulgari eloquentia II.vi.6. Dante “recycles” the opening of the first line ofthat canzone in the first line he gives to Arnaut Daniel (Purg. XXVI.140, “Tanm’abellis vostre cortes deman” [So greatly does your courteous question pleaseme]). At least several years before 1200, Folchetto left the life of the worldbehind (including a wife and two sons), becoming first a friar, then abbot ofTorronet in Toulon, and finally bishop of Toulouse in 1205. He was deeplyinvolved in a leadership role in the bloody and infamous Albigensian Crusade(1208–29). As Longfellow has it (comm. to this verse), “The old nightingalebecame a bird of prey.”One wonders if Dante’s use of Folco (rather than Folchetto) for him in thiscanto mirrors his sense of the “new man” that eventuated once he turned fromlove and amorous poetry to the religious life. For a perhaps similarappreciation, if it is not clearly stated, see Bertoldi (Bert.1913.1), p. 27,noting that St. Dominic was at Rome in 1216 “in compagnia del vescovo Folco,l’amoroso Folchetto di Marsiglia.…” On Dante’s sense of Folco’s two-part“career,” see Barolini (Baro.1984.1), pp. 114–22. [return to English[part0011.html#c09-s32-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c09-s32-i]]95–96. [part0011.html#c09-s32-e] Folco’s meaning is that the heaven of Venushas its light increased by the presence of his soul, now wrapped in a sheath oflight because he is saved, just as it once stamped his nature with an amorousdisposition. [return to English [part0011.html#c09-s32-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c09-s32-i]]96. [part0011.html#c09-s32-e] While Folchetto’s status as poet seems not to bealluded to here at all, many deal with it as part of the context of hispresence, understandably assuming that Dante is centrally interested in that.Among those involved in examining the possible Old French and Provençal sourcesof Dante’s poems, Michelangelo Picone has been particularly active. Opposing theviews advanced by Picone (Pico.1980.1 and Pico.1983.1) and Rossi (Ross.1989.1)and reaffirmed by Antonelli (Anto.1995.2), p. 347, Pietro Beltrami(Belt.2004.1), p. 33n., argues that Folco is not to be taken as the highestexponent of Troubadour lyrics found in the poem, but rather as a poet who hasgiven over poetry for religion and is saved for that reason alone. That is,Folco’s distinction in Paradise lies in his rejection of poetry, not in hiscontinued embrace of it. Compare the similar opinion of Luca Curti(Curt.2002.1), p. 146: “… but now [we hear not the troubadour] but only thebishop Folco, in whose discourse poetry has not even a marginal presence.…”[return to English [part0011.html#c09-s32-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c09-s32-i]]97–102. [part0011.html#c09-s33-e] Dido (“the daughter of Belus”) was no moreaflame with love (bringing grief to Sychaeus [Dido’s dead husband; see Aen.IV.552 and Inf. V.62] and Creusa [Aeneas’s dead wife; see Aen. II.736–794 andthe note to Purg. II.79–81]) than Folco was. (However, since the next twoclassical lovers are both apparently drawn from Ovid’s Heroides, Dante may bethinking of the portrait of Dido found there [Book VII].) Nor was Phyllis morein love with Demophoön, who betrayed her (see Ovid, Heroides II); nor wasHercules more in love with Iole (see Ovid, Heroides IX). Allegretti(Alle.2002.1), p. 142, suggests that Dante wants us to think of the Heroides inpart because the work insists on the adulterous nature of most of the loves itrecounts, using faithful Penelope as a counter exemplum to them.

[part0011.html#c09-s35-e] The tercet clarifies the similar, but moreoccluded, statement of Cunizza (vv. 34–36). All the pain of sin is utterlyerased from the memory of every saved soul. On this simile, see Jacoff(Jaco.1980.1). [return to English [part0011.html#c09-s35-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c09-s35-i]]106–108. [part0011.html#c09-s36-e] A problematic passage. We have followedBosco/Reggio’s reading of it (see their comm. to this tercet), in which aFlorentine form of the verb torniare (to turn, as on a lathe) is seen asbringing the meaning into focus, as follows: “Here, in Paradise, we contemplatethe craft revealed in the creation that God’s love makes beautiful; we alsodiscern the goodness through which the heavens give form to the world below.”For a lengthy and unapologetic negative response to Dante’s saving of Folco, seethe judgment of John S. Carroll (comm. to vv. 82–102), which concludes asfollows: “It certainly gives us a shock to find a noble spirit like Dante’s sosubdued to the colour and temper of its time that deeds which sink Ezzelino toperdition exalt Folco to Paradise, because done in the name of Christ andauthority of His Vicar.”For the other appearance of the phrase “cotanto affetto,” see Inferno V.125,where it applies to carnal affections. Folco’s use of it now is very different,we may imagine, than it would have been in his flaming youth. [return to English[part0011.html#c09-s36-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c09-s36-i]]109–114. [part0011.html#c09-s37-e] Having read Dante’s mind, Folco changes thesubject from himself to the particularly dazzling light (“like a sunbeamgleaming on clear water”) about which he knows Dante is curious. Once we findout who it is, we understand why he has tried to create a sense of excitedmystery around this being. [return to English [part0011.html#c09-s37-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c09-s37-i]]115–117. [part0011.html#c09-s39-e] The enjambment in the second line of thetercet creates Dante’s desired effect: surprise. Not only does Rahab’s namecause us (at least temporary) consternation, what Folco goes on to say of herdoes also. Not only is a whore among the saved, she is among the loftiest soulswhom we see here.Among the first commentators, only the author of the Codice Cassinese (comm. toverse 117) said that by the “highest rank” Dante indicates the Empyrean, whichis what he should have meant, since none of the Hebrew (and a very few other)souls saved in the Harrowing of Hell is anywhere recorded as going anywhereelse, not even by Dante. That anonymous commentator would wait for nearly fiveand a half centuries for company (Torraca in 1905 [comm. to this tercet]).Torraca also believes the reference is to the Empyrean. The passage is, as manycommentators protest, difficult to understand. Nonetheless, Benvenuto da Imola(comm. to vv. 115–117) seems quite certain that her highest “rank” pertains tothe hierarchy of the souls gathered in Venus. Most of those after him who electto identify her location also think the reference is to the planet. Only in thelast one hundred years has the pendulum of scholarly opinion begun to swing, ifonly slightly, in the direction of the Empyrean. Allegretti (Alle.2002.1), pp.143–44, makes a strong case for that resolution. The only problem is that in theentire passage, all other references are unquestionably to the sphere of Venus(vv. 113 [qui]; 115 [là]; 116 [di nostr’ ordine congiunta]; 118–120 [questocielo … fu assunta]; 122 [in alcun cielo]). And so it would seem that this isyet another instance of an authorial slip (see the note to vv. 119–123). [returnto English [part0011.html#c09-s39-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c09-s39-i]]118–119. [part0011.html#c09-s40-e] The point at which ends the shadow of theearth cast by the Sun, a cone stretching nearly 900,000 miles above the earthaccording to Alfraganus, reaches only as far as the sphere of Venus (and thusmarks the planet only when it is on the lower half of its epicyclical rotation).Most early commentators, if they cite any astronomical authority, refer toPtolemy (for the relevance of his chapter on eclipses, first by Jacopo dellaLana). Beginning in the late nineteenth century, Alfraganus becomes more widelyused as Dante scholars begin to understand the extent of the poet’s debt to theLatin translation of the ninth-century Arabian astronomer’s work, in fact theprobable source for whatever Ptolemy he knew.In the Old Testament, Rahab has a major role in the second chapter of Joshua(2:1–21), where she aids and abets two spies from Joshua’s army; then she isrescued during the destruction of the city by a grateful Joshua (Joshua6:22–25). Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 118–126) point out that her salvation isnot original with Dante, but is a matter of biblical record, with such witnessas offered by St. Paul (Hebrews 11:31) and St. James (James 2:25), the first ofwhom insists on her faith in God, while the second extols her good works. Andsee Matthew 1:5, where Rahab is listed as the mother of Boaz, and thus a distantancestress of Jesus. For a figural understanding of Rahab, see Auerbach(Auer.1946.1), pp. 482–84. [return to English [part0011.html#c09-s40-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c09-s40-i]]119–123. [part0011.html#c09-s40-e] Dante slips back into the language ofParadiso III, where Piccarda and Constance seem to be located in the Moon on apermanent basis. See Bosco/Reggio (comm. on verse 120), who are of the opinionthat Dante does not in fact mean what he seems to, since the souls of all thosewho were harrowed from Hell by Christ (see Inf. IV.52–63) were assumed at onceinto the Rose, as have been, indeed, all those who have been “graduated” fromPurgatory (not to mention those few [we assume] in the Christian era who wentstraight to Heaven). However, we may once again be witnessing the trace of anearlier plan (see the note to Paradiso III.29–30). Bosco/Reggio’s alternativeexplanation seems weak (repeating the explanation of Grabher [comm. to vv.118–120]): Dante only means that in the Empyrean their rank corresponded to therank of Venus among the planets. Dante, in fact (and deliberately?), neverclarifies the relationship between the order of the eight heavens in which hesees the saved arranged for his edification (nor indeed between the hierarchyamong the souls who appear in each heavenly sphere) and the seating plan in theRose. One probable cause of his avoidance of this question is that there areobvious distinctions among the degrees of blessedness of the saved who appear invarious spheres, as we have just seen (Rahab is the highest in rank among thesevisitors to Venus). To calibrate both scales of beatitude probably proved toomuch even for a Dante, who thus simply avoided a question that we sometimeschoose to force on him. [return to English [part0011.html#c09-s40-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c09-s40-i]]123. [part0011.html#c09-s41-e] Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 118–126) perhapsexhausted the possible interpretations of this line. The two “palms” refer to(1) the palms of Rahab’s hands when she lowered her line for Joshua’s two spiesfrom the window of her room so that they could climb down; (2) the palms thatJoshua and those who followed him raised in prayer. Benvenuto says theseinterpretations have been suggested by other readers and dismisses both of themin favor of (3): the palms of the hands of Jesus, nailed to the Cross. Whilethere is still a certain amount of uncertainty, most current commentatorssupport Benvenuto’s reading. [return to English [part0011.html#c09-s41-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c09-s41-i]]124–126. [part0011.html#c09-s42-e] In his voce dedicated to “Folchetto (Folco)di Marsiglia,” ED II (1970), p. 955b, Antonio Viscardi makes the interestingsuggestion that parallels exist between Folco’s destruction of the fortifiedtown of Lavaur in the Albigensian Crusade in 1211, accompanied by the voices ofpriests raised in song, and the fall of Jericho, accomplished by the sound oftrumpets and shouts; he also suggests that both Folco and Rahab are humansstained by the sin of lust and ultimately redeemed by good works.

[part0011.html#c09-s43-e] Satan is traditionally thought of as beingprideful (in that he cannot accept being less important than God); but he isalso thought of as envious, particularly in his dealings with Adam and Eve,whose happiness he cannot abide. Dante uses the rhetorical figure periphrasishere to rousing effect, for who does not know the “answer” to this riddle? Weseem to be invited to shout the name of Lucifer. But note also the crushingresult when we consider the adverb pria (first): Satan may have been the firstto deny his Creator, but he was hardly the last, dear reader.…The sins of Eve and Adam brought all of us “distress” in that we weep for ourlost immortality.For Satan’s fall as a “foundation myth” of humankind, see the note to InfernoXXXIV.121–126. This text would seem to offer another version of that myth, withSatan’s envy as the founding sin of Florence. [return to English[part0011.html#c09-s43-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c09-s43-i]]130–132.

[part0011.html#c09-s45-e] The blackened margins of collections ofdecretals, or books of ecclesiastical law, tell what interests lure the clergyto study: the material advantage furthered, or so they believe, by mastering theins and outs of canon law. For this they have given over not only consulting theGospels, but studying the Fathers of the Church. And in one of his own letters(to the Italian cardinals gathered in France to choose a new pope after thedeath of Clement V), Dante makes the same charge, mentioning some specific namesof those whom these cardinals do not read: “Gregory lies among the cobwebs;Ambrose lies forgotten in the cupboards of the clergy, and Augustine along withhim; and Dionysius, Damascenus, and Bede” (Epist. XI.16 [tr. P. Toynbee]).See Cassell (Cass.2004.1), pp. 12–13, adducing the fact that all the popes ofDante’s time (except, of course, Celestine V) were canon lawyers, a fact thatmay help explain some of Dante’s hostility to decretals.In the early centuries of the Catholic Church, canon law was formed by themember churches themselves at synods of bishops or church councils. By the sixthcentury, papal letters settling points in canon law (a practice dating perhapsto the third or fourth century) began to be included in collections of thedecisions of synods and councils. Sometime between the late eighth and lateninth century there was produced a collection, the so-called False Decretals.These spurious documents included “papal letters” that had in common the desireto strengthen papal authority. Gratian, a sort of Justinian of canon law,published his Decretum circa 1150. It codified the laws of the Church (althoughit included many documents collected in the False Decretals) and enjoyed a greatdeal of authority. To the surprise of some, given Dante’s dislike of thosechurchmen who are interested in studying decretals as a path to maintaining oraugmenting their financial privilege, we find Gratian in the heaven of the Sun(Par. X.103–105). See J. Michael Gaynor, “Canon Law and Decretals”(http://jmgainor.homestead.com/files/PU/PF/cld.htm[http://jmgainor.homestead.com/files/PU/PF/cld.htm]).

[part0011.html#c09-s46-e] “To it” refers, again, to the florin, to whichthe highest ranks of the officialdom of the Church, the pope and his cardinals,pay much more serious attention than their vows of poverty should allow. [returnto English [part0011.html#c09-s46-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c09-s46-i]]137–142. [part0011.html#c09-s46-e] The two references are, first, to theAnnunciation (when Gabriel “opened his wings” to Mary in Nazareth); second, toall those martyred in Rome for their belief in Christ, starting with Peter(buried on the Vatican hill) and filling many a catacomb. Thus the two exemplarygroups bracket the birth and resurrection of Jesus, the one preparing the wayfor Him, the second following his path into a glorious death (and eventualresurrection).Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 127–142) suggests that Dante’s muffled prophecy is setin the context of crusading (see vv. 125–126), without going on to suggest thatit calls for a new crusade. However, that does seem a real possibility. At anyrate, most commentators have given up on finding a precise formulation forunderstanding Folco’s prophecy. The “usual suspects” have been, more or less inthis order of popularity, the death of Boniface VIII, the removal of the papacyto Avignon, the coming of a great leader (e.g., on the model of the veltroand/or the DXV). It would not seem like Dante to have a negative prophecy atthis point (furthermore, the death of Boniface did not lead to a rejuvenation ofthe Church, nor did the “Avignonian captivity”); nor would it seem like him torepeat a prophecy that he would then repeat still again in Paradiso XXVII.145(the fortuna [storm at sea]) and which is primarily imperial, notecclesiastical, as this one is. And so it seems reasonable to suggest thatScartazzini may have been on the right track. Fallani (comm. to vv. 139–142)comes close to saying so (without referring to Scartazzini). And see AngeloPenna, “Raab,” ED IV (1973), p. 817a, who says in passing that vv. 112–142reflect crusading. Mark Balfour (Balf.1995.1), pp. 140–41, sees the desire forrenewed crusading in the Holy Land as permeating the conclusion of the canto,but follows exegetical tradition in seeing its very last lines as referring tothe veltro or DXV. The Church (and the entire context of this passage, vv.133–142, which we hear in the voice of a [crusading] churchman, isecclesiastical) will reorder itself only when it returns to its originalpurpose; for Dante, no matter how this may trouble modern readers, that meantrecapturing Jerusalem.

[part0011.html#c10-s01-e] Like the other tenth canti, this one marks thecrossing of a borderline (in Inferno, it separated the sins of Incontinence fromthe walls of the City of Dis, enclosing the sins of the hardened will; inPurgatorio, Ante-purgatory from Purgatory proper). The first of these is fairlyindistinctly marked; the next more formally established. But this one is asthough a double line had been drawn across the space separating Canto IX fromCanto X, separating the planets attained by the earth’s shadow from those,beginning with the Sun, that are free of such darkening. None of the souls wewill meet from now on suffered from the human weakness that we found among thosewho lacked a vigorous faith, or those who placed too much hope in the things ofthis world, or those who failed to understand the nature of true love (for theprogram of the defective Theological Virtues in the first three heavens ofParadiso, see the note to Par. III.47–48; and see Andreoli [comm. to Par.III.16]: “The fact is that it is only in the fourth heaven that we shall beginto find souls who are completely beyond reproach”).On this opening, see Forti (Fort.1968.1), p. 352: After the several referencesin the last canto to human strife, Dante now turns to “celestial harmony insteadof earthly disorder.” Forti later says (p. 380) that the celestial Athens (seeConv. III.xiv.15) is the point at which we have now arrived.These six verses might be paraphrased: “God the Father (the Power), gazing onHis Son (Wisdom) with the Holy Spirit (Love) that breathes forth eternally fromboth Father and Son, created all things that revolve above, whether in angelicconsciousness or in the sphere that they govern (e.g., that ruled by thePrincipalities, Venus), with the result that anyone who (as Dante now is doing)contemplates the Father’s Power cannot fail to savor it.” [return to English[part0011.html#c10-s01-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c10-s01-i]]1–3. [part0011.html#c10-s01-e] Dante seizes the opportunity to underline hisadherence to orthodox doctrine: The Holy Spirit breathes forth from both theFather and the Son. The so-called filioque controversy, caused by the additionof that phrase (meaning “and from the Son”) in the Nicene Creed, which was oneof the eventual causes of the split between the Eastern and Western Churches(which became final in 1054), was centered in the dispute over the emanation ofthe Holy Spirit. Against the decision of the Council of Nicea (325), the Easternposition was that the Spirit proceeded only from the Father. See Carroll (comm.to vv. 1–6): “Probably Dante had here a special interest in asserting theorthodox doctrine, because the two chief spokesmen of this Heaven were summonedto defend it against the Greek deputies at the Council of Lyons in 1274. Aquinasdied on the way, and Bonaventura during the sitting of the Council.” [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c10-s01-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c10-s01-i]]4–5. [part0011.html#c10-s02-e] These lines have caused difficulty. Where somehave thought the references are to thoughts of things and things themselves inthe created universe, most contemporary readers (perhaps following Forti [Fort.1968.1], p. 353) think the references are to angelic intelligences (the nineorders of angels) and to the things impelled by them (the heavens with theirplanets).

The reference is to the annualrevolution of the Sun. Its daily motion is from east to west, and parallel tothe Equator; but its annual motion is from west to east, and along the Zodiac ata certain angle to the Equator.” [return to English [part0011.html#c10-s06-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c10-s06-i]]22–27. [part0011.html#c10-s08-e] There is some dispute as to whether this is adistinct address to the reader or a continuation of that found in vv. 7–15.Because they are rhetorically separate entities (“Leva dunque, lettore, …” and“Or ti riman, lettor, …”) and enjoy temporal separation (the reader is askedthree times to look along with Dante up at the circling heavens, and then tothink upon what he or she has seen, unaided by the poet, who now must return tohis narrative), one does not find an easy objection to consider them as being infact more than one. The controlling element in this central metaphor of thesetwo terzine moves from a scholar’s bench (verse 22), on which we readers sit,listening to Dante’s lecture, to (in verse 25) a seat at a banquet, at whichchef Dante is preparing the meal, a “feast of knowledge” indeed. He does,however, beg off from serving us, leaving us to do that for ourselves, since hemust attend to continuing his narrative.

[part0011.html#c10-s09-e] A hapax, the Latinism scriba, rhyming with twoother Latinisms, preliba (tasted [and not yet swallowed]) and ti ciba (feedyourself), is one of the key words in Dante’s self-presentation as veraciousauthor, which occupies a privileged space here, the last line of one of thelongest introductory passages to a canto in this poem at the point where it hasreached the first stage of its destination, what we might refer to as “God’scountry.” Poletto (comm. to vv. 25–27) points to the apt phrase in MonarchiaII.x.6 where Luke is referred to as the scribe of Christ (“Cristus, ut scribaeius Lucas testatur”). And see Sarolli, “Dante scriba Dei” (in Saro.1971.1, pp.189–336) and the note to Paradiso V.85. For a meditation on this verse asencapsulating Dante’s self-presentation as scribe throughout the poem, seeJacomuzzi (Jaco.1968.1). Dante’s claim here, to be merely the “scribe” of God,is at once part of the topos of modesty and a shattering denial of it, sinceDante’s “mere scribal” activity lifts him to the level of the authors ofScripture, including the Solomon whom we will see in this very canto.

[part0011.html#c10-s10-e] The ascent to the Sun, we are perhapssurprised to discover, has not until now been accomplished. We must surmise thatthe view of the heavens purveyed in vv. 1–27 derives from what Dante saw lookingup from the planet Venus. His movement up from there, as is Beatrice’s guidancewhile leading him up, seems instantaneous, seems not to occur in time.

[part0011.html#c10-s14-e] Placella (Plac.1987.1), p. 222, followsPetrocchi in thinking that this effulgence is not that emanating from Beatrice(as most early commentators believed, perhaps encouraged by her presence in thepreceding terzina), but of the souls in the Sun, who are so bright that theyoutshine even that brightest of all celestial bodies. For a fairly earlyinstance (ca. 1791) of the current majority sense of this tercet, see Lombardi(comm. to vv. 40–45), citing the prophet Daniel, whose final vision (Daniel12:3) portrays the wise as shining with the brightness of the sun.

[part0011.html#c10-s18-e] Beatrice plays with one of the most presentmedieval metaphors, the Sun as representing God (see Conv. III.xii.7), the “sun”of the angels, his “planets” in the Empyrean, who has raised Dante to the heightof this heaven, home of the physical sun.

[part0011.html#c10-s20-e] Discussing these lines, Curti (Curt.2002.1),pp. 150–52, paraphrases them as follows: “… my mind, so concentrated on Godthat Beatrice was eclipsed and forgotten, divided His splendor into many things,so that I saw many splendors sparkling” (p. 151). As opposed to his “forgetting”of Beatrice while he was still on earth, looked back upon with horror inPurgatorio XXX and XXXI, this forgetful behavior is laudable, as, in the nexttercet, Beatrice’s own reaction indicates.

[part0011.html#c10-s22-e] The souls in the Sun make Beatrice and Dantethe center of their circle (“crown”) just as the halo around the Moon (dwellingof the former huntress, Diana) is formed by the vapor in our atmosphere thatattaches “cloth” to the “belt” of Latona’s daughter.

[part0011.html#c10-s24-e] In the Empyrean (la corte del cielo), whenceDante has returned, there are jewels (the saints and/or the angels?) so preciousthat they may not be removed from the kingdom (resolved from metaphor, bedescribed here on earth), and it was of them that these souls in the Sun sang.In this canto we are given less indication than in any we have read (in whichthe souls are making musical tribute) about what exactly the souls were singing;eventually we learn that the conjoined choruses of the two groups of twelvetheologians are singing of the Incarnation (Par. XIII.27) and of the Trinity(Par. XIII.26; XIV.28–31), as Carroll has pointed out (comm. to vv. 70–93). Onewho does not put wings on himself (Icarus-like?), as Dante has, to fly up to seethese “jewels” might as well await word about them from the dumb. One has to seefor oneself, apparently (since not even Dante is telling), that is, take thetrip through the heavens that, as far as we learn, only Paul and Dante wereprivileged to enjoy while still in this life.A question remains unanswered in the commentaries. Are the singing souls,clearly presented as being situated in the Sun, distinguished from the “jewels,”about whom they are singing and who are in the Empyrean, or are they countedamong their companions here in the Sun? While many commentators cite InfernoII.125 for the phrase corte del cielo, no one seems to be bothered by the factthat it there clearly refers to the Empyrean, specifically referring to Mary,Lucy, Rachel, and Beatrice. It seems necessary to understand that the twelvetheologians are singing of exalted “colleagues” whom they have temporarily leftbehind them in the Empyrean, for instance, the Virgin Mary, possibly St. Francishimself, and other “stars” of the afterlife, too precious to be sent below forDante’s instruction or to be identified by their descending colleagues inbeatitude.To explain the mercantile reference in this passage, Torraca (comm. to vv.70–73) refers to Marco Polo’s II milione (XXV, LXXIX), where the travelerreports that the Great Khan would not allow rubies (see Par. IX.69 and note), inthe first case, or pearls, in the second, to leave his kingdom in order toprotect their value, not letting them become common by allowing their export.For Portirelli’s views on Dante’s knowledge of Marco Polo’s voyage, see the noteto Purgatorio I.22–24.

[part0011.html#c10-s26-e] After the “suns” in the Sun had circled Danteand Beatrice three times, like the stars that circle the poles, they seemed toDante to resemble ladies in the dance who pause, awaiting the resumption ofsinging in order to continue with their dance steps. See the description of thepractice of ladies who danced to the singing of ballate in Dante’s time inCasini/Barbi (comm. to verse 79).For a meditation on this canto that takes its departure from these lines, seeFreccero, “The Dance of the Stars” (1968), in Dante: The Poetics of Conversion(Frec.1986.1), pp. 221–44.

[part0011.html#c10-s28-e] Thomas’s first word, “Quando,” is matched byonly one other speaker’s first word similarly occupying the last place in itsline, that uttered by Ulysses (Inf. XXVI.90). Where Ulysses has epic pretensionsin his self-narrative (see the note to Inf. XXVI.90–93), Thomas, another kind of“hero,” one who indeed vigorously pursued virtue and knowledge (and not merelyin what we might regard as an advertisement for himself) is a foil to pridefulUlysses. The Greek adventurer’s pride is matched by Thomas’s humility. (His nameoccurs only after he finishes the eighteen-line introductory portion of hisspeech, and then only after he has named his teacher. Can anyone imagine Ulyssesreferring to someone who had been his teacher?) His first self-description (vv.94–96) intrinsically suggests that he is dramatically different from Ulysses,who in his pursuit of knowledge had companions whom he treated as the mereinstruments of his own adventure and whom he destroyed along with himself;Thomas, on the other hand, “was a lamb among the holy flock / led by Dominicalong the road / where sheep are fattened if they do not stray.” That last word(vaneggia) surely has a kinship with Ulysses, whose wandering brings him underthe spell of the Siren (at least according to Dante: See Purg. XIX.19–24). WhatUlysses did, Thomas chose not to do. [return to English[part0011.html#c10-s28-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c10-s28-i]]86–96. [part0011.html#c10-s29-e] It is interesting that this portion of thefirst utterance of St. Thomas, the great opponent of poetry for its seductivefigurative quality, beautiful but simply untrue, contains several metaphors: the“stair” (the ascent of the heavens toward God) that Dante is on; the “wine”(knowledge) that Thomas will share with Dante; the “plants” (souls) thatsurround Beatrice and him; the “lambs” (friars) who were Thomas and his fellowDominicans on earth; the “path” (the way to God) that led to his salvation; the“fattening” (knowledge of God’s truth) found in the nourishment of the Word. Onecan only imagine Thomas’s objection had he been able to read those words, put byDante into his mouth. The last metaphor will have its second moment in the nextcanto (Par. XI.25), and then its last and triumphal appearance in the finalverse of that canto (XI.139). [return to English [part0011.html#c10-s29-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c10-s29-i]]87. [part0011.html#c10-s29-e] The “stair” that is climbed only twice is thepathway to Heaven negotiated by a living soul in grace, who is thus promised areturn trip (we again think of St. Paul, Dante’s only known precursor, thoughunreported miraculous journeys are not ruled out). Grandgent (comm. to thisverse) notes that this is a clear prediction of Dante’s ultimate salvation, andrefers the reader to a similar earlier gesture in Purgatorio II.91–92 (and see,of course, Purg. XXXII.100–102). [return to English [part0011.html#c10-s29-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c10-s29-i]]97–99. [part0011.html#c10-s33-e] Thomas begins his “catalogue of saints,”twelve in number perhaps to remind us of the original apostles, with AlbertusMagnus (1193–1280), often referred to as “Doctor Universalis” because of hisextensive learning; he taught at Cologne, where Aquinas was one of his pupils.In some quarters it has become fashionable, after the exertions of Bruno Nardi,to argue for the actual preeminence in Dante’s thought of Albert over Thomas.But see Cogan (Coga.1999.1), pp. xxiii–xxiv: “Despite Nardi’s efforts toconvince us that Albert the Great was Dante’s preferred philosophical source, itis Aquinas whom Dante chooses as the principal spokesman for theology in theParadiso, not Albert or any other theologian.” For more detailed arguments thatare in basic agreement with this position, see Dumol (Dumo.1998.1), especiallypp. 139–66. [return to English [part0011.html#c10-s33-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c10-s33-i]]99. [part0011.html#c10-s33-e] Thomas Aquinas (1225–74), often referred to as“Doctor Angelicus,” was, in the minds of many, the greatest theologian of histime. It is perhaps fair to say that the position of those of Dante’s readersmost interested in the question has swung from the strict Thomistic constructionof Dante sponsored by Giovanni Busnelli to the far more concessive views (whichperhaps yield too much of Dante’s allegiance to Thomism) of Casella(Case.1950.1) and of two of the leading non-Italian students of the poet’stheology, Étienne Gilson and Kenelm Foster. For an extensive treatment ofDante’s intellectual response to Aquinas, see Gilson’s classic study(Gils.1939.1); and see Foster’s entry “Tommaso d’Aquino,” ED V (1976), pp.626–49, as well as his much briefer English essay (Fost.1977.1), pp. 56–65.Dante criticism is currently a good deal more “ecumenical,” a position thatundergirds Amilcare Iannucci’s fine, brief treatment of this subject (“Theology”in Lansing [Lans.2000.1], pp. 811–15). It would not be going too far to say thatDante is a precursor of at least one aspect of Renaissance humanism, itspleasure in syncretism, a delight in putting together things that would preferto be kept separate, making new concepts out of the ideas of the unsuspecting(and defenseless) great figures of the past, about some of which they would, hadthey a voice, surely bellow in complaint. For a cautionary note, indicating thecomplexity of the entire question of Dante’s various philosophic allegiances,see Simon Gilson (Gils.2001.2), passim. Indeed, while Dante may honor Thomasmore than any other theologian, that does not mean that he always agrees withhim—far from it.

Hesays, in his preface to that work, that, like the poor widow in Luke’s Gospel(21:1–4), he hopes to make his small contribution to God’s treasury. [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c10-s36-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c10-s36-i]]109–114. [part0011.html#c10-s37-e] Solomon, son of David and king of Israel,the question of whose salvation was much discussed during the Middle Ages (seethe reference to the world’s hunger for news of him in vv. 110–111, along withits prime reasons for doubting that he was saved, his prodigious carnalaffections in his old age, and his falling into idolatry as part of these amours[I Kings 11:1–9]; these missteps were compounded, for some, by his authorship ofthe Canticle of Canticles). However, if the Truth be true (i.e., if we are tobelieve what we read in the Bible), God specifically (I Kings 3:12) singlesSolomon out for the highest praise: “I have given you a wise and understandingheart, so that there was none like you before you, neither after you shall anyarise like you (nec post te surrecturus sit),” this last the source of Dante’s“non surse il secondo” (verse 114). This passage is probably remembered inMatthew 11:11, “Among them that are born of women there has not risen a greaterthan John the Baptist,” which was cited by Tommaseo (comm. to Par. X.112–114).Michele Scherillo (Sche.1896.1) reviews Solomon’s many “disqualifications” frombeing considered an author of Scripture and then his checkered career among theexegetes, the most authoritative of whom, from Dante’s own point of view (e.g.,St. Augustine, Brunetto Latini), deny him salvation (if St. Jerome granted it).(For three twelfth-century theologians who differ [Philip of Harvengt, PeterComestor, and Joachim of Flora], saying that Solomon was indeed saved, seeSarolli [Saro.1971.1], pp. 210–15.) Scherillo suggests that it was primarily hiskingship that inspired Dante to consider him among the blessed, but does notoverlook the force of the fact that Solomon was indeed, in Dante’s eyes (and, ofcourse, not in his alone), the author of canonical texts: Proverbs (see, e.g.,Conv. III.xi.12; Mon. III.1.3), Ecclesiastes (see, e.g., Conv. II.x.10), theCanticle of Canticles (see, e.g., Conv. II.v.5); though he never refers toSolomon’s authorship of the Book of Wisdom, he cites its first line in ParadisoXVIII.91–93. In other words, for Dante, Solomon is scriba Dei (a scribe of God).No matter how anyone might call into question his credentials, he has them. Wemay reflect that Dante shares both a “monarchical” and a “theological” identitywith Solomon, poet of empire and of God, his new “Book of Wisdom” (replacing theprevious and abandoned attempt, the Banquet) railing against the enemies of thetrue and God-centered empire. The more one thinks of Dante’s Solomon, the morehe becomes a likely choice as precursor of this poet (perhaps even in the lightof his sexual trespass, something that he, his father, David, and DanteAlighieri, by his own confession [Purg. XXX and XXXI], have in common).On Solomon’s auctoritas see Minnis (Minn.1984.1), pp. 94–96; 110–12. For theview of Solomon of early Christian exegetes, see Bose (Bose.1996.1). On thesense of the overwhelming importance, for Dante’s view of Solomon, of hisauthorship of the Book of Wisdom, see Pelikan (Peli.1997.1), p. 3: Wisdom “wasthe book that brought together the Timaeus and Genesis on the beginning of theworld” (cited by Herzmann [Herz.2003.1], p. 330). For a study of Dante’s senseof identity with Solomon, see Seem (Seem.2006.1). [return to English[part0011.html#c10-s37-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c10-s37-i]]110. [part0011.html#c10-s37-e] Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 43, points out thatthis is the third appearance in this canto of a form of the verb spirare (soclosely and often associated with the “spiration” of the Holy Spirit), the onlyone to contain so many occurrences (see also vv. 2 and 51).

[part0011.html#c10-s39-e] Dionysius the Areopagite, converted by St.Paul at Athens (as mentioned by Luke in Acts 17:34) and martyred there in a.d.95. He was erroneously assumed to be the author of the De caelesti hierarchia, awork particularly prized for its description of the orders of the angels and oftheir nature. (Dante makes wide use of it in the Paradiso.) The CelestialHierarchy and three others of the reputed works of Dionysius were actuallyproduced some five centuries later by Greek neoplatonists and were translatedinto Latin only in the ninth century.

[part0011.html#c10-s40-e] Orosius, whose historical compendium,entitled Historiae adversus paganos, was written at the suggestion of St.Augustine, as a defense of the Christian religion’s beneficial role in humanhistory. Augustine made use of it in writing his De civitate Dei, and it isfrequently used by Dante. See Toynbee (Toyn.1902.1), “Dante’s obligations to theOrmista,” pp. 121–36, for the opinion that the reference is indeed to Orosius,which for a long time has been the view of the majority of the commentators.Alberto Pincherle, “Agostino,” ED I (1970), p. 82b, mentions the usual suspects(Orosius, Ambrose, Tertullian, Paulinus of Nola, and Lactantius), and settles onMarius Victorinus. For continued insistence that the avvocato de’ tempicristiani is in fact Orosius, see Brugnoli (Brug.1998.1), pp. 491–92. The earlycommentators were divided, with the majority favoring St. Ambrose, but othersbacking Orosius. After them, the majority opinion has settled on Orosius by awide margin, with many convinced by Venturi’s argument (comm. to this tercet)that Dante would never have spoken of the great St. Ambrose as a “picciolettaluce” (little light). Moore should still be consulted (Moor. 1889.1), pp.457–60, for three strong arguments for the reference’s being to Orosius and notto Ambrose. But see Lieberknecht (Lieb.1996.1) for a thoughtful attempt toresuscitate Ambrose’s candidacy, even if the author ends by admitting thatOrosius remains the front-runner.

[part0011.html#c10-s41-e] In the first of these three tercets, as aunique instance among this bevy of illuminati, Dante calls attention to theimportance of a particular soul, a signal honor done Boethius, the author of theDe consolatione Philosophiae. Dante mentions him, always with this particulartext in mind, some dozen times in Convivio (first in I.ii.13). He was active inthe first half of the sixth century, holding the consulship at Rome, but earnedthe displeasure of the emperor, Theodoric, who imprisoned him at Pavia andfinally had him put to death by torture. See the note to verse 128.See Trucchi (comm. to vv. 1–6) for the notion that, where Aquinas (ST Supp., q.69, a. 2) says that only some will have to spend time in Purgatory before theypass on to Heaven, Dante has all go, with exceptions of those like Boethius,Francis, and Cacciaguida, the auspicious few, according to Isidoro del Lungo (inan unspecified text); that is, Dante’s view is the exact negative counterpart tothat of Thomas. See the note to Paradiso XI.109–117. [return to English[part0011.html#c10-s41-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c10-s41-i]]128. [part0011.html#c10-s43-e] Curti (Curt.2002.1), p. 159, reminds us thatAugustine’s remains were circa 725 removed from Sardegna (where they had beentaken from Hippo) and taken to Pavia by the Lombard king, Liutprand, whoreinterred them in the basilica of Cieldoro. Where might Dante have learnedthis? In the opinion of Curti, from the Chronicon of the Venerable Bede (presentin verse 131). (Casini/Barbi [comm. to this verse] had already pointed out thatboth Augustine and Boethius were reburied beneath imposing monuments in thatchurch by Liutprand.)

[part0011.html#c10-s44-e] Isidore (bishop) of Seville compiled one ofthe first great medieval encyclopedias in the seventh century, his twenty booksof Etymologies. He was, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through thederivative work of Uguccione da Pisa), one of Dante’s main authorities on anynumber of subjects.

[part0011.html#c10-s44-e] The Venerable Bede, the ecclesiasticalhistorian of Britain, lived well into the eighth century. See Pasquini(Pasq.2001.1), pp. 283–91, for claims on behalf of the writings of Bede(Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, De natura rerum, De metrica arte) ashitherto unexplored sources for a number of passages in the Commedia.

He and his master, Hugo of St. Victor (for whom see Par.XII.133), were mystical theologians in the monastery of St. Victor near Paris.“He was said to be a native of Scotland, celebrated Scholastic philosopher andtheologian, chief of the mystics of the twelfth century. He was, with PeterLombard, a pupil of the famous Hugh of St. Victor, and a friend of St. Bernard,to whom several of his works are dedicated; he died at St. Victor in 1173. Hiswritings, which are freely quoted by Thomas Aquinas, consist of commentaries onparts of the Old Testament, St. Paul’s Epistles, and the Apocalypse, as well asof works on moral and dogmatic subjects, and on mystical contemplation, the lastof which earned him the title of ‘Magnus Contemplator’ ” (T). Dante in hisEpistle to Cangrande (Epist. XIII.28), when justifying his dealing withtranscendental subjects in the Paradiso, appeals to Richard’s work Decontemplatione. [return to English [part0011.html#c10-s44-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c10-s44-i]]133–138. [part0011.html#c10-s45-e] Siger of Brabant, thirteenth-centuryphilosopher and theologian who taught at the Faculty of the Arts of theSorbonne, located near “the Street of Straw,” the Rue du Fouarre in Paris (oneof the few pieces of “evidence” seized on by those who believe, as few today do,that Dante visited Paris; but the street’s name was apparently widely known; andDante might have heard details about the theological disputes in Paris, forinstance from the Dominican Remigio Girolami, who had studied with St. Thomas inParis and who lectured at S. Maria Novella between 1289 and 1303). In 1270,Thomas wrote his De Unitate intellectus contra averroistas, clearly attackingsome of Siger’s teaching (along with that of others). Between 1270 and 1277,Siger was prosecuted by the archbishop of Paris Étienne Tempier (and in 1276 bythe inquisitor for France, Simon du Val) for heretical ideas and found guilty.He went to Orvieto to face the Roman Curia and apparently owned up to hiswayward philosophizing, and perhaps was absolved for it. He then stayed inOrvieto, in a condition perhaps resembling house arrest, where he apparently methis death beneath the knife of a mad cleric, possibly a man assigned to him as aservant, circa 1283–84. The author of Il Fiore (XCII.9–11) mentions Siger’sterrible end. For a compact bibliography of Siger’s extensive body of work,those considered genuine, those possibly or probably by others, and those nowlost, as well as a short list of studies of his impact on Dante, see CesareVasoli, “Sigieri (Sighieri) di Brabante,” ED V (1976), pp. 241b–42a.For an invaluable survey of the state of the question regarding theinterrelationships among Aristotle, Averroës, Albertus Magnus, and Aquinas, asthey affect Dante’s own philosophical views, see the first half of the study bySimon Gilson (Gils.2004.1). For a brief but most helpful summary in English ofthe strands of Dante’s Aristotelianism, see Scott, “Aristotle” (Lans.2000.1),pp. 61–65. For a discussion of the major “heresies” current in Dante’s time, seeComollo (Como.1990.1). We in the twenty-first century may not have enough feelfor the huge change in theology wrought by the rediscovery of Aristotle in thethirteenth century. Dante clearly felt himself drawn to the new philosophy, asis evident by his placing Aristotle higher than Plato as a figure of classicalphilosophical authority, as is first reflected in the Commedia in InfernoIV.131. [return to English [part0011.html#c10-s45-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c10-s45-i]]133–135. [part0011.html#c10-s45-e] What the reader is supposed to understandabout these thoughts that made death seem welcome to Siger is debated; perhapsit is his concern, mirrored in his retraction in (or perhaps after) 1276 thathis earlier erring notions might condemn him to damnation in God’s eyes, despitehis finally having chosen the true faith. Vasoli (“Sigieri,” ED V [1976], pp.238a–42b) is not certain of Siger’s sincerity in hewing to the line.Nonetheless, Dante may have decided that his appearance before the Roman Curiain Orvieto “cured” him of his heretical bent, and that, when he was murdered, hewas living in the bosom of Mother Church. [return to English[part0011.html#c10-s45-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c10-s45-i]]138. [part0011.html#c10-s46-e] See Tulone (Tulo.2000.1) for a review of theproblem caused by the phrase invidiosi veri (enviable truths). Tulone’shypothesis is that Dante’s text refers to the envy of those who hypocriticallyoppose Siger’s sound doctrinal teaching by claiming it is other than Christian.And see Mazzotta (Mazz.2003.1), p. 155, who is of the opinion that invidiosimeans “not logically evident or demonstrable,” on what grounds it is difficultto say. Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 133–138) distinguishes between the wordsinvidiosus and invidus as follows: “invidiosus enim est ille cui invideturpropter suam felicitatem: et sic capitur in bona parte; invidus vero est illequi invidet alteri; et sic capitur in mala parte” (for the man who is invidiosusis one who is envied because of his happiness, and the word is then understoodpositively; the man who is invidus, on the other hand, is one who is envious ofanother, and the word is then understood negatively). Curti (Curt.2002.1), p.162, while not referring to Benvenuto, may have cited one of thefourteenth-century commentator’s sources: Isidore of Seville (Etym. X.134): Onewho is invidus envies the happiness of another, while the man who is invidiosussuffers the envy of others. As for the word silogizzò (which we have translatedas “demonstrated”), from the beginning there has been dispute as to whether itis to be taken negatively or positively. Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv.133–138) argues that these syllogisms are untrue, while Benvenuto da Imola(commenting on the same passage) is of the opposite opinion, namely that thesyllogisms of Siger’s making are indeed truthful, and for that reason thesubject of envy on the part of those who heard and admired them. Over the yearsa large majority of the commentators are of Benvenuto’s opinion; and see Veglia(Vegl.2000.1), p. 103 and note, for a concordant reflection. That Siger is savedhas undoubtedly contributed to the forming of this view; the words themselvesmight seem far less generous in a different context. See, for example, thesecond verse of the next canto. [return to English [part0011.html#c10-s46-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c10-s46-i]]139–148. [part0011.html#c10-s47-e] According to Scott (Scot.2004.2), p. 297,this is the first reference in literature to a mechanical clock. He cites Dronke(Dron.1986.1), pp. 101–2, who suggests that Dante might have seen the one builtin Milan in 1306 when he was there for the coronation of Henry VII (in 1310).And see Moevs (Moev.1999.2) for the nature and location of clocks in Dante’stime. [return to English [part0011.html#c10-s47-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c10-s47-i]]144. [part0011.html#c10-s48-e] For turge see Pertile (Pert.2005.2), pp.173–76, pointing out, with numerous examples, that the word has never beforebeen used, in Latin, with a sexual denotation, a meaning it acquired only lateron. Dante, having conflated love and intellect, at least by the opening of thiscanto, can use the vocabularies interchangeably, or substitute the former forthe latter, as he does here. Psychologists refer to another version of thisprocess as sublimation, an attempt to skirt a painful awareness of sexual desireby replacing it with a more “acceptable” activity. In Jesus’ teaching (e.g., thewise virgins preparing for the arrival of the bridegroom [Matthew 25:1–13]) wecan see a more positive sense of sexuality, if it is also simultaneously seen asthe basis for its own supersession, taking carnal pleasure past its physicalexpression and its physical limits. For example, “If you enjoy the thought ofconsummating a marriage, oh, will you enjoy the kingdom of Heaven!” It wouldseem likely that Dante’s transposition of terms generally associated with sexualdesire to descriptions of the longing for God, as innovative as it may seem tobe, is in fact a continuation of a highly similar practice in Jesus’ teaching,as is found with some frequency in the Gospels.

[part0012.html#c11-s01-e] In sharp contrast to both the opening six andconcluding nine verses of the preceding canto, with their visionary taste of atrinitarian and ordered love and then the sound made by the singing souls in theSun (compared to the harmonious chiming of matins calling monks to prayer), theopening nine verses of this canto summon images of ceaseless and futile humanactivity, from which Dante is happy to have been, at least temporarily,liberated.

[part0012.html#c11-s01-e] Dante’s reflection of the opening verse ofPersius’s Satires (“O curas hominum, o quantum est in rebus inane” [O wearisomecares of men, o emptiness of the things we care for]) had anearly-twentieth-century notice in Bertoldi (Bert. 1903.1), p. 7. However, it wasfirst observed in the late fourteenth century by the author of the Chioseambrosiane. [return to English [part0012.html#c11-s01-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c11-s01-i]]2. [part0012.html#c11-s01-e] Depending on whether we have read verse 138 ofthe previous canto in bono or in malo, that is, whether we have thought Dantemeant to praise or blame Siger’s “syllogizing,” we decide that the noun form ofthat word is here used oppositionally or with the same intonation. See the noteto Paradiso X.138 for reasons to prefer the first alternative; where Siger isadmirable for his powers of reasoning, the normal run of men is not, usingreason merely to advance their cupidinous designs.

[part0012.html#c11-s01-e] The metaphor of lowered wings suggests that wemortals, born worms but with the ability to be transformed into angelicbutterflies (according to Purg.

[part0012.html#c11-s02-e] Dante’s list of vain human activities startsout with law (whether civil or canonical); medicine (identified by one of theearliest known doctors, Hippocrates, author of the medical text that bore thetitle Aphorisms); priesthood (as a position rather than as a calling); politicalpower (whether achieved by force or guile).

[part0012.html#c11-s04-e] Punning on the first noun in Paradiso, theglory (la gloria) of God, Dante separates himself from the eight activities hehas just catalogued by noting his freedom from such preoccupations as are causedby them and enjoying his presence here in the Sun, welcomed by these souls wholive, still higher above, in gloria with God.

[part0012.html#c11-s07-e] Dante here gives Thomas one of the relativelyfew similes allowed to a speaker in the poem.

[part0012.html#c11-s08-e] Perhaps we are meant to be amused thatThomas’s eulogy of Francis begins as a gloss on two difficult passages on hisown “poem” (see Par. X.96 and X.114), the veiled speech that made the historicalThomas distrust poetry. [return to English [part0012.html#c11-s08-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c11-s08-i]]28–36. [part0012.html#c11-s10-e] This convoluted and difficult passage may beparaphrased as follows: “God’s foresight, with such deep wisdom that none mayfathom it, selected two guides for the Church so that she, married to Him at themoment when Christ cried out in pain on the Cross [Daniello, comm. to vv. 28–34:See Luke 23:46] and shed His blood to wed her [Lombardi, comm. to vv. 31–34: SeeActs 20:28], might proceed joyously, and with greater confidence and faith,following Him.” Thus Francis and Dominic, the first of whom was indeed oftenportrayed as a “second Christ” (see, among others, Auerbach [Auer.1944.2], p.85), each takes on the role of Christ in husbanding the Church through her manytribulations both in his lifetime and thereafter, by instrument of the mendicantorder that he, having founded, left behind him.

[part0012.html#c11-s12-e] See Cosmo (Cosm.1936.1), pp. 123–25, for theview that Dante nourished his hopes for the Church’s renewal with the writingsof Ubertino da Casale, particularly his Arbor vitae crucifixae Iesu.

[part0012.html#c11-s13-e] The complementarity of the founders of thetwo orders is insisted on here, not their distinguishing features. Thus beforewe hear a word about either Francis or Dominic, respectively associated with theSeraphim (the highest angelic order) and love and with the Cherubim (the nextorder down) and knowledge, we are informed in no uncertain terms that we shouldnot rank one higher than the other. See the note to Paradiso XII.46–57. And seeCarroll (comm. to vv. 37–39) for a similar attempt to bridge what he refers toas “mysticism” and “scholasticism.”It may have been Bernardino Daniello (comm. to vv. 40–42) who first broughthistorical fact into play in interpreting this part of the canto. It was amatter of record, he reports, that on Francis’s feast day (4 October) one of thefriars of his order would preach the virtues of Dominic, while on the feast ofDominic (8 August), a Dominican would do the same for Francis. Daniello suggeststhat this practice lies behind Dante’s here. As many have ruefully noted, thatspirit of fraternity between these two groups of friars did not present anaccurate picture of the relations, in fact emulous, between these two mendicantorders in Dante’s time.

[part0012.html#c11-s15-e] These three tercets of Thomas might beparaphrased as follows: “Between the Topino and the Chiascio, which flows downfrom Gubbio, perched on a fertile slope on mount Subasio, whence Perugia, sometwelve miles to the west, feels both cold air from the mountains and the heat ofthe easterly sun, sits Assisi, while further to the east the towns Nocera andGualdo suffer both from the cold and from being misgoverned by the GuelphPerugians. From here, where the mountain is least steep, arose a sun, just asthe Sun we are in rises from Ganges in summer (when it is brightest).” [returnto English [part0012.html#c11-s15-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c11-s15-i]]44. [part0012.html#c11-s15-e] The “blessed Ubaldo,” canonized in 1192, wasborn Ubaldo Baldassini in 1084 and served as bishop of Gubbio (1129–60). Beforehe allowed himself an ecclesiastical life, he lived as a hermit on a hill nearthat town, along the stream named Chiascio.

The two towns “mourn beneath their heavy yoke” perhaps intwo senses: Literally, they are beneath the peaks of the Apennine Range (andthus overshadowed by them); metaphorically, they suffer under Guelph rule.[return to English [part0012.html#c11-s16-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c11-s16-i]]51. [part0012.html#c11-s17-e] The Ganges, about which we will hear again inParadiso XIX.71, was for Dante the defining eastern limit of his world. (Seville[Inf. XX.126 and XXVI.110] was close to the western limit, as Ulyssesdiscovered]). For earlier reference to the Ganges, see Purgatorio II.5 andXXVII.4.

[part0012.html#c11-s18-e] Ascesi: For the phrase describing Francis as“quasi Sol oriens in mundo” (like the Sun rising on the world) by one of hischroniclers, Bernardo da Bessa, see Baldelli (Bald.1973.1), p. 105; this sourcewas perhaps first cited by Daniello (comm. to verse 50). Perhaps the onlycommentator to be properly puzzled by what this verse means, whether in Dante’sformulation itself or in more than six hundred years of commentary that have yetto produce a convincing resolution, is Chimenz (comm. to vv. 52–54). But no oneapparently has thought of the most simple reason that might have made Danteprefer “Orïente” to “Ascesi”: the tenses of the Latin verb and participle.“Ascesi” (“I have risen,” certainly a Christlike enough word) yields to“Orïente” (rising) because the second word is present tense, that is, notconfined to the past. Francis, like Christ, is always rising, leading usHeavenward.The first commentator to turn to Bonaventure’s life of Francis for a source, apractice of many contemporary glossators, was apparently Lombardi (comm. to vv.53–54): “Vidi Alterum Angelum ascendentem ab ortu Solis, habentem signum Deivivi” (I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of theliving God [Apocalypse 7:2]). We may note that St. Bonaventure’s biblicalformula also makes use of a present participle—two of them, in fact. Bosco(Bosc. 1966.1), p. 322, privileges the Apocalypse over Franciscan writings ascompelling Dante’s attention, but not convincingly, since Dante may have beenreminded of the Apocalypse precisely by Bonaventure.

[part0012.html#c11-s19-e] Dante puns on the Sun again, using a metaphoricvalence for his birth (orto [rising]) more readily associated with the rising ofa star or planet in the sky.

Dante has boiled down into a singletercet the dramatic story of Francis’s public rejection of his father’s plansfor him, taking the clothes off his back to return them to him in a publicsquare of Assisi. This choice is represented here by his “marrying” LadyPoverty. (One of the popular Franciscan narratives of the thirteenth century wasthe Sacrum commercium beati Francisci cum domina Paupertate. For an attempt toestablish Dante’s acquaintance with this work as already revealed in passages inPurgatorio, see Havely [Have.1996.1].) That conceit gives the controlling imageto the next fifty verses (58–117). And, while even indirect reference to theconflict between the Spiritual and Conventual Franciscans will not confront thereader until the next canto (XII.124), it is clear from the outset that Danteessentially sides with the Spirituals, whose central and urgent position was theradical insistence on the Church owning nothing, a view that happens to coincidewith Dante’s political views. This is not to say that his religious feelingsabout poverty were ungenuine, but merely to point out that a secondary reasonfor them does exist. Manselli, “francescanesimo,” ED III (1971), pp. 14a–16b,points out that the fourteenth-century struggle within the order had its rootsin the papacy of Celestino V, in the waning years of the thirteenth century,when a group of Franciscans received permission to split off and form their own“sub-order.” They were fairly soon forced to flee Italy (most of them forGreece). This group included John of Peter Olivi and Ubertino of Casale, both ofwhom eventually resurfaced in Florence. For a recent discussion in English ofDante’s views of the Spiritual Franciscans, see Havely (Have.2004.1). [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c11-s20-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c11-s20-i]]60. [part0012.html#c11-s20-e] In the past sixty years there has been disputeover the somewhat curious phrase “la porta del piacere” (lit., “the door ofpleasure”), generally understood to understate the aversion to poverty, that is,none opens the door to her gladly, none welcomes poverty into his heart. Thisbecame “the doorway to pleasure” (die Pforte der Lust [Neue Dantestudien,Istanbul, 1944, p. 80]) in Auerbach’s (Auer.1944.2, pp. 88–89) formulation (histranslator does not help his case, making porta plural, while it is singular,and mistranslating piacere in her “gates of desire,” if one must admit thattranslating the phrase presents something of a problem). If most werescandalized by this reading, it has found support in some quarters, for example,Marguerite Mills Chiarenza (Chia.1993.1). The core of Auerbach’s interpretation,possibly the most controversial point in a series of works dealing with Dantethat were hardly intended to be without cause for controversy, may berepresented in a single sentence: “It seems to me absolutely necessary tointerpret the opening of the gates of desire in the proper sense as a sexualact, and thus porta as the gateway to the feminine body” (p. 88). For some ofthe many counterarguments, see Bonora (Bono.1987.1), pp. 242–43; Pasquini(Pasq.1996.1), pp. 422–23; see also Pasquini (Pasq.2001.1), pp. 193–94. Whatsupporters of Auerbach’s reading fail to take into account is that it is themale in the metaphor who opens his “porta del piacere” to the lady, thusrendering his entire argument inapplicable. [return to English[part0012.html#c11-s20-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c11-s20-i]]61–63. [part0012.html#c11-s21-e] In 1207, before the court of the bishop ofhis hometown and coram patre (Latin: “in the presence of his father”), herenounced his family and the life that had been chosen for him to follow Christ.In no other figure in the history of the Church does the concept of the“imitation of Christ” have so obvious and central a relation as it has in thelife of Francis of Assisi.His “spouse,” Poverty, once chosen, becomes increasingly more precious to him;as we will shortly find out (vv. 64–66), she had been married once before, andher previous husband had been no one less than Jesus. [return to English[part0012.html#c11-s21-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c11-s21-i]]64–66. [part0012.html#c11-s22-e] While at first the reader is perhaps not sureas to the identity of Poverty’s first husband, it will soon (at verse 72) becomeclear that she was Jesus’ “wife,” left a widow by the Crucifixion in a.d. 34,and remaining “unmarried” for 1,173 years, unwanted by any other suitor, untilFrancis’s vow in 1207.Dante has outdone himself. The writings about Francis (who was practically thecause of the explosion of the biography industry all by himself [there were atleast eight “lives” produced within the century of his death]) have, except forthe Gospels, no antecedents. Dante’s addition to existing Franciscan material isspectacularly original in its reworking of the basic narrative found inBonaventure and others. Dante expands the role of poverty not so muchconceptually (the devotion to poverty is the keystone of all Franciscanwritings) but stylistically, making his saintly life an allegorical tale of hisrelationship to her. He can, given the abundance of “official lives,” count onhis readers to fill in the by-then familiar historical details.For the influence of Franciscan lyric poetry (and especially that of Iacopone daTodi) on Dante, see Vettori (Vett.2004.1), pp. 120–22. Luciano Rossi(Ross.2002.1), pp. 170–72, follows up a suggestion of Lucia Battaglia Ricci(Batt.1997.1), p. 42, and argues that Dante’s eleventh canto reflects Francis’sLaudes Creaturarum (see the note to Inf. I.117).It seems possible that the author of the Commedia has, improbable as this mayseem, gone beyond the prideful bearing that afflicted so much of his earlierwork and attained a kind of humility (see Hollander [Holl.2003.2]). For thecrucial role of Francis in the development of that humility, particularly ascounterforce to the arid intellectual pride that leads to heresy, see Veglia(Vegl.2000.1), pp. 75–97.

[part0012.html#c11-s23-e] Not content with making Poverty the “wife” ofJesus and then of Francis, Dante invents her presence in classical epic, addingher to the participants in that scene in Lucan (Phars. V.515–531) in whichCaesar’s bellowing, bullying manner cannot impress the poverty-strickenfisherman, Amyclas (see Dante’s earlier treatment, without mention of LadyPoverty, in Convivio IV.xiii.12), not evincing fear because he has nothing ofwhich to be robbed.Occasionally, a reader (e.g., Carlo Grabher, comm. to vv. 64–75) complains thatthis bit of business seems overly cerebral (along with the next exemplum, thepresence of Poverty on the Cross with Jesus). It surely reveals the high regardDante held for Lucan’s text, putting a moment from its narrative not onlyalongside one from the Bible (a familiar enough Dantean technique), butalongside one of the supreme moments in the Bible, Jesus’ death on the Cross;yet Grabher’s point is well taken.

[part0012.html#c11-s24-e] If Lady Poverty’s loyalty to Amyclas had wonher no friends for more than a millennium, this result is all the moresurprising in that she was the last one to solace Jesus in His final agony.[return to English [part0012.html#c11-s24-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c11-s24-i]]72. [part0012.html#c11-s24-e] A much-debated line, from the earliest days tothe present. Is the verb in this line pianse (wept), as Petrocchi has decided,or is it salse (climbed), as Benvenuto da Imola insisted (comm. to vv. 70–72)?Evidently, the shocking and otherwise unheard-of act that is portrayed if thereader accepts the second option has kept some commentators on the side of theversion of this verse contained in the Codice Cassinese, in which we findpianse. As always, we are constrained (as we should be) by our decision tofollow Petrocchi’s text; on this occasion, we would have gladly been governed byBenvenuto’s reading of the line.

[part0012.html#c11-s25-e] Thomas is concerned lest he had allowed hisspeech to become chiuso (dark, unclear), and we consequently not understand ofwhom and of what he spoke, thus reflecting his characterization (vv. 22–24) ofhis figurative speech in the previous canto (most specifically Par. X.96, hismetaphor of fattening sheep, on which he has been expanding here) as not beingaperta (clear). Once again one may witness, behind the text, Dante’s desire todeal with Thomas’s attacks on the unreliable nature of poetic speech (seeHollander [Holl.1976.1]). [return to English [part0012.html#c11-s25-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c11-s25-i]]74. [part0012.html#c11-s25-e] Finally we hear the name of this hero of thereligious life. Ernesto Trucchi (comm. to vv. 55–57) revives the account of acertain preacher, named Chalippe, who, in town to address the faithful of Luccaduring the Lenten observances of 1689, was shown names engraved in stone by acanon of Lucca named Moriconi. These were two Luccan brothers, one of whom,Bernardo Moriconi, left his native city and settled in Assisi. His son, Pietro(Bernardone, after his father) Moriconi, married a noblewoman by the name ofPica Bourlement. In 1181 they had a son, baptized (at the mother’s instigation,since the father was away at the time) as Giovanni. Upon his return to Assisi,Pietro Bernardone was furious, since he had wanted his son to bear the name ofFrancesco (the adjective for “French” in Italian) to honor his own pleasure inassociation with France, the country where he had made his fortune as amerchant. Accordingly, the day of the boy’s confirmation, Pietro had his namechanged. And that, apparently, is how Francesco d’Assisi got his name.

[part0012.html#c11-s26-e] Indeed, the growing love between Francis andhis lady, Poverty, is a form of concordia developed out of apparent discord: thefirst description of poverty as something, like death, that no one willinglywelcomes.

[part0012.html#c11-s27-e] The first followers of Francis, those whowere eventually gathered into the Order of Friars Minor (so called by Francis inhis first Rule, indicating their humility, i.e, that they were “lesserbrothers”), are now presented: Bernard of Quintavalle (a fellow townsman ofAssisi, also from a wealthy family, who was so impressed by Francis’s actionsthat he sold all his possessions in benefit of the poor and became his firstfollower; Francis considered Bernard his “first born”); Giles and Silvester,both also of Assisi—the first was also among the earliest of Francis’s followersand lived until 1262; Silvester was already a priest, who, when he had a dreamin which Francis killed a dragon menacing the city, joined the group; he diedcirca 1240.The sensuous delights of going barefoot are portrayed as the freedom of the soulin unstinting love of Christ. We note how the heat increases in these lines:Bernard is described with a past definite (si scalzò) as having taken his shoesoff, but then the verb is repeated in the present tense (scalzasi) for Giles andSilvester. Those uses of the “historical present” intensify the feeling ofliberation as, one by one, Francis’s followers begin also to fall in love withthis ugly woman.

[part0012.html#c11-s28-e] The adjective ferace (literally, fertile,fecund), a hapax in the poem (as is, more surprisingly, the parallel adjectivethat precedes it, ignota [unknown]), contrasts with the notion of ordinary life,based as it is in acquiring wealth and possessions, not in living one’s faith.Like its unique status among the words of the poem, its unusualness inordinarily sterile human experience sets it apart.

[part0012.html#c11-s29-e] These lines summarize the result of thefamily struggle between Pietro Bernardone and his son, once known as Giovanni(Sigmund Freud must have enjoyed this passage): Francis, having rejected his ownfather, has himself become a father and a teacher; having rejected his ownfamily, he has created a group of apostolic brethren.

[part0012.html#c11-s29-e] The word capestro refers to the rope used tocontrol horses or oxen, that is, a halter, and was used as a belt by Francis andhis first followers as an outward sign both of their inner control and of theirhumility before God. See its other two occurrences as identifying marks ofFranciscan friars, Inferno XXVII.92 and Paradiso XI.132. And see the note toInferno XVI.106–108 for the word corda (cord), also used to designate thecincture of a garment worn by a member of a religious order (of its fourteenappearances in the poem, however, only two others refer to such a use [Inf.XXVII.67; Purg. VII.114]). [return to English [part0012.html#c11-s29-e] /Italian [part0023.html#c11-s29-i]]88–93. [part0012.html#c11-s30-e] In 1214, Francis went to Rome and had anaudience with Pope Innocent III, who approved the founding of the order (he gaveit its “first seal”). See Tozer’s paraphrase (comm. to these vv.): “On thatoccasion he was not shamefaced on account of the meanness of his origin or hiscontemptible appearance, but ‘like a prince declared to Innocent his sternintention’ of founding his Order: It is a little difficult to reconcile thestatement about the meanness of his origin with the fact that his father was awell-to-do merchant; but this appears to be the meaning, for St. Bonaventura inhis Life of St. Francis says that, when the epithets ‘boorish’ and ‘mercenary’were applied to him, the Saint was wont to reply, that such reproaches weresuitably addressed to Pietro Bernardone’s son (‘Talia enim licet audire filiumPetri de Bernardone’ [Legenda maior VI.2]).” [return to English[part0012.html#c11-s30-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c11-s30-i]]91. [part0012.html#c11-s31-e] Pasquini (Pasq.2001.1), p. 241, points out thatwords in Dante’s narrative at times are at radical odds with their counterpartsin the various vitae of St. Francis, as here regalmente (regally) replaces theadverb humiliter (humbly); similarly, in verse 101, the Sultan’s presence isdescribed as being superba (prideful) while in the lives of Francis he ispresented as offering a respectful welcome; or, in verse 106, Mt. Alvernia isportrayed as a crudo sasso (rugged rock) rather than as the locus amoenus(pleasant place) of his biographers’ accounts. What these changes commonlyreflect is Dante’s desire to make Francis’s story more heroic than did his ownbiographers, who dwelled on his humility. As opposed to those who would onlycontrast Francis and Dominic, Dante matches them as “militant heroes” of theChurch. See the note to Paradiso XII.35.

[part0012.html#c11-s31-e] Dante suppresses reference to the narrative thatappears not only in all the early lives of Francis, but which has a role inGiotto’s representation of his life in the upper church at Assisi. Pope InnocentIII at first was not favorable to Francis’s petition and was planning to denyit. He had a dream, however, in which he saw Francis holding the totteringChurch of St. John Lateran on his shoulders, and that won him over.

[part0012.html#c11-s32-e] In fewer than ten years the order had grownfrom a relatively tiny band (those who had joined by the time Francis first wentto Rome) into some five thousand members in 1223, by the time he goes there toappear before Pope Onorius III and to receive the “second seal” of his missionfrom him.

[part0012.html#c11-s32-e] There are three basic constructions of thepossible meaning of this contested line: Francis’s life (1) is only to bepraised for the greater glory of God, (2) were better sung in Heaven than by his(corrupt?) followers down there on earth, (3) were better sung in the Empyreanthan (by me [Thomas]?) here in the Sun. Sapegno argues (comm. to this verse)briefly and cogently against the first two hypotheses and makes a convincingcase for the third, giving it its first complete statement: “The life of Francisis more worthy of being sung in the Empyrean by choruses of angels and of soulsin bliss than it is of being described in pedestrian ways by me alone.” Thus, inthis canto based on praise for Francis’s humility, Thomas displays his own aswell.

[part0012.html#c11-s33-e] The word archimandrita, a word formed out of aGreek ecclesiastical term meaning “chief shepherd” (from arch + mandra[“sheepfold”]), and thus the head of more than one monastic community, a hapaxin the poem (but which appears, denoting the apostle Peter, in Mon. III.ix.17;it also is present, referring to the pope, in Epist. XI.13). This word is not,as some might expect, a Dantean coinage, but may have been found by him in theMagnae derivationes of Uguccione da Pisa, as Grandgent (comm. to vv. 97–99)seems to have been the first commentator to suggest. [return to English[part0012.html#c11-s33-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c11-s33-i]]100–105. [part0012.html#c11-s34-e] Drawn by his hope for martyrdom, inimitation of Christ, Francis, accompanied by twelve of his followers (a numberobviously meant to recall Jesus’ twelve disciples) went to Egypt during acrusade. He insisted, at great risk to all of their lives, on trying to convertthe Sultan, Malik al-Kamil, and preached before him to no avail. The Mohammedan,showing great restraint (and perhaps some political astuteness), sent Francisand his fellows back to the Christian army. Francis, seeing his plans formartyrdom during crusade foiled by his gracious adversary, returned to Italy.Dante presents this episode out of sequence, since the Egyptian journey occurredin 1219, four years before his second trip to Rome, presented in vv. 94–99.[return to English [part0012.html#c11-s34-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c11-s34-i]]106–108.

[part0012.html#c11-s37-e] Francis’s death receives more poetic spacethan any other element in Thomas’s biography. His soul flies back to its Maker.(This is one of the few specific notices we have that some of the saved bypasspurgation in order to proceed directly to Heaven. See the note to ParadisoX.121–129.)The merchant in him, now totally redefined, does what all merchants are sure todo: make a will in favor of their surviving family or friends. Thus does Francisleave his “treasure” to his “family,” commending them to love his “wife,”Poverty, and commending his body to the dust, whence we all came. In goodFranciscan fashion, he does not even want a plain coffin, only the earth itself.Thomas’s narrative has moved first along a vertical axis, beginning in themountains above Assisi (vv. 43–45) and descending from there; then along ahorizontal axis, as Francis moves around Italy and the Near East; and finallyending, once more on a mountain (Alvernia, verse 106), with his soul moving upstill higher, to Heaven, while his body’s latent movement is down, back intonothingness, without a containing bier (bara, the last word in Thomas’snarrative), in the earth.

It is probably not accidental thatPeter, referred to as archimandrita in Monarchia (see the note to verse 99), ismentioned here, as Dante obviously sees the first archimandrita and the second(Francis) as well as the new patrïarca (Dominic) as all playing a major role inthe shaping of the Church, past and present, when the weakness and corruption inthe papacy made the mendicant orders especially necessary in his eyes.The whole metaphorical passage is developed in nautical terms, in which Peter isthe first captain, followed by Francis and Dominic as cocaptains, of the Church.She is portrayed as a merchant ship (surprisingly, perhaps, until one thinks ofthe commercial metaphors that are present in some of Jesus’ parables), with aprecious cargo in its hold, the true believers who (we must assume) will benumbered among the saved. [return to English [part0012.html#c11-s40-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c11-s40-i]]124–132. [part0012.html#c11-s42-e] And now a switch in metaphor: Dominic’s“sheep” are so hungry for new food that they have become widely scattered; thefarther afield they go, the less milk they produce (i.e., the less their livesgive evidence of having taken in the lessons of life under the Dominican Rule)when they finally return. And, if a few keep close to the shepherd, it does nottake much cloth to have enough for their cowls. Thus does Thomas follow hispraise of Francis with a denunciation of his own Order, as Bonaventure will dofor his fellow Franciscans in the next canto (Par. XII.112–126).For a consideration of the identical elements in these obviously paired cantos,see the note to Paradiso XII.142–145. [return to English[part0012.html#c11-s42-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c11-s42-i]]133–135. [part0012.html#c11-s45-e] Heavily rhetorical (three “if” clauses inas many lines), the opening tercet of Thomas’s conclusion draws Dante’sattention back to his words in the previous canto (see the note to verse 139).Note that Thomas does not say, in the final clause, “what I said,” but “what wassaid,” in a painstakingly modest way of avoiding the use of the first person.[return to English [part0012.html#c11-s45-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c11-s45-i]]136–139. [part0012.html#c11-s46-e] Thomas reminds Dante that he has beenanswering the first of his unvoiced “doubts” (see vv. 22–25), caused by Thomas’sphrasing in the last canto (Par. X.96). [return to English[part0012.html#c11-s46-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c11-s46-i]]137. [part0012.html#c11-s46-e] The word “plant” (pianta) introduces stillanother metaphor, that of Dominic’s Order as despoiled plant, the reason forwhich defoliation Thomas has just made plain (vv. 124–132). [return to English[part0012.html#c11-s46-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c11-s46-i]]138. [part0012.html#c11-s46-e] A dispute found in the commentaries involvesthe understanding of the word corregger, whether it is a noun (correggér),formed from the noun correggia, the Dominican equivalent of the Franciscancapestro (see the note to verse 87), and meaning “he who wears the Dominicancincture” and thus, here, Thomas (a formulation first proposed by Francesco daButi [comm. to vv. 133–139], who, however, believed the noun referred toDominic, not Thomas). Most today, following the self-styled “first moderncommentator,” Pompeo Venturi, who, in the eighteenth century, found anequivalent for the word corregger in “reprensione” (rebuke), think it is eithera verb or an infinitive used as a verbal noun, meaning, in the first case,“correction” (we have translated it “rebuke”) and, in the second, “guidance.”And see Lombardi (comm. to vv. 138–139) for a return to Buti’s interpretation.For his customary lengthy review (and also a return to Buti), see Scartazzini(comm. to vv. 138–139). However, see the nearly equally lengthy treatmentoffered by Campi (comm. to vv. 136–139), opting for Venturi’s solution, which ismuch as our own. Since then, the basic disagreement lies between followers ofButi/Scartazzini and Venturi/Campi, with most who deal with the problem fallingin behind Venturi/Campi.

[part0012.html#c11-s46-e] Thomas, in good Thomistic fashion, rounds offhis “gloss” on Paradiso X.96 by repeating the entire line here.It is amusing to think that Dante’s revenge on his major intellectual rival inthe debate over the truth-telling capacity of poetry comes from making Thomas acommentator on Dante’s poetry, a role that he himself, perhaps prodded byThomas’s attacks on his profession, felt called upon to play in his Epistle toCangrande.

[part0012.html#c12-s01-e] The action of this canto begins, if we take itsfirst line literally, before the preceding one ends, that is, before Thomasutters the last syllables (or syllable) of vaneggia. That seems fitting, sincethese two cantos are, perhaps more than any other pair in the work, mirrorimages of one another. See Bertoldi (Bert.1903.1), referring to them, despitetheir differing subjects and feelings, as “twin cantos.” See also the note tovv. 142–145.

[part0012.html#c12-s01-e] Dante had earlier resorted to the image of themillstone (mola) to refer to the rotation of the Sun, seen from either pole,around the earth (Conv. III.v.14).

[part0012.html#c12-s02-e] The matching circles of twelve saints, eachmoving in such a way as to match the other both in the eye and in the ear of thebeholder, anticipates the final image of the poem (Par. XXXIII.143–145). [returnto English [part0012.html#c12-s02-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s02-i]]4. [part0012.html#c12-s02-e] The first circle of saints was described (Par.XI.14) as having completed a first full rotation; now it is seen as being on thepoint of completing a second one. [return to English [part0012.html#c12-s02-e] /Italian [part0023.html#c12-s02-i]]6. [part0012.html#c12-s02-e] The double repetition (moto/moto; canto/canto)underlines the matching quality of these two circles. [return to English[part0012.html#c12-s02-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s02-i]]7–8. [part0012.html#c12-s03-e] The previous tercet had divided the activity ofthe souls into circling movement and song; this one divides that song itself(repeating the word canto) into two components, words (muse) and melody(sirene). Dante had used the word Muse (capitalized by Petrocchi, if we havelittle idea of Dante’s actual practice with regard to capitalization) in Inferno1.7, in Purgatorio II.8 and XXII.102, then in Paradiso II.9, to indicate theMuses of classical antiquity. Beginning here, however, and then in two laterpassages (Par. XV.26 and XVIII.33), Petrocchi obviously believes that Dante usesthe lower-case word musa metaphorically, here to refer to poets (the next usewill refer to Virgil [or his poetry] as “nostra maggior musa” [our greatestmuse], and finally [Par. XVIII.33], to poetry itself—or so most readersbelieve).Torraca (comm. to vv. 7–9) seems to have been the first to remark on the similarconjoining of Sirens and Muses in Boethius (Cons. Phil. I.1[pr]).These two verses contain four words relating to music: canto (song), musa(muse), sirena (siren), tuba (brass musical instrument [more precisely,“horn”]). For the echoing effect that results from the repetition of the firsttwo, Dante may have had in mind the similar effect found in Ovid’s story of Echoand Narcissus, referred to in vv. 14–15. The next (and last) time we read thenoun tuba (Par. XXX.35), it will be the metaphoric expression for Dante’s poeticvoice, while here it refers to the voices of the singing saints. [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c12-s03-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s03-i]]9. [part0012.html#c12-s03-e] The word splendore is, in Dante, always theresult of light (luce), proceeding along its ray (raggio), and then reflected byan object. (For these interrelated terms, describing the three major aspects oflight, see Dante’s earlier statement [Conv. III.xiv.5].) This verse makes clearDante’s belief that a second reflection (e.g., as in a mirror) is less vividthan that original splendor (but cf. Par. II.94–105, which seems to contradictthis understanding). As we have learned in Canto X (vv. 64–69), these crowns ofdancing saints are presented as circles of musical lights. And in that earlierpassage, a simile, the comparison is to the rainbow, as will also be true in thesimile that begins in the next verse. [return to English[part0012.html#c12-s03-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s03-i]]10–21. [part0012.html#c12-s04-e] This simile, explicitly formal in itsconstruction (Come … così) and, balanced in its content, containing oneclassical and one biblical reference (Iris and the rainbow that God offered as asign to Noah), gives a sense of the identity of the two circles of saints,despite their evident differences. [return to English [part0012.html#c12-s04-e]/ Italian [part0023.html#c12-s04-i]]10. [part0012.html#c12-s04-e] Dante apparently thought of thin (and thus“translucent”) clouds as actually being constituted of a layer of water-soakeddust suspended in the atmosphere in which the rainbow appears. [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c12-s04-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s04-i]]11–18. [part0012.html#c12-s04-e] There are a number of candidates for theclassical source at work here, primarily texts in Virgil and Ovid. It seemslikely that Dante would have had the reference (Metam. I.270–271) to Juno’ssending Iris (her “handmaid,” the rainbow) as a result of Jove’s huge storm,sent below in his attempt to extirpate, in a flood, the human race (typified inthe first murderer, Lycaon [the wolf-man], and hence abandoned by piety andjustice [Metam. I.149–150]). That would nicely balance these gestures toward“famous rainbows,” since the second of them is without doubt reflective of therainbow that God sent as the sign of his covenant (Genesis 9:13) with Noah andthe few other surviving members of humankind based on His promise never to sendsuch a destructive flood again. (The first book of the Metamorphoses is, as itwere, the pagan equivalent of Genesis.) We are also probably meant to comparethe unchecked vengeful desires of the king of the pagan gods with the moderatedsternness of God the Father.Dante adds a second rainbow, as his context demands, not as he found in hissources, but as may at least occasionally be observed in Tuscany even today.[return to English [part0012.html#c12-s04-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c12-s04-i]]13. [part0012.html#c12-s05-e] The second circle is, like the second rainbow,wider than the first. Dante’s science believed that the second rainbow was bornfrom the first, not that it was part of a double refraction of light. [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c12-s05-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s05-i]]14–15. [part0012.html#c12-s05-e] The reference is to the nymph Echo (Metam.III.356–510), who fell in love with Narcissus. She wasted away with unrequitedpassion until all that was left of her was a voice. This second simile, withinthe overarching simile that compares the two circles of saints to the doublerainbow, replicates the form of such a rainbow. [return to English[part0012.html#c12-s05-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s05-i]]18. [part0012.html#c12-s06-e] As Tommaseo suggests (comm. to vv. 16–18), thepresent tense of the verb allagare (to flood) suggests the past, present, andfuture application of God’s covenant with humankind: This global flood has notrecurred and will never do so. [return to English [part0012.html#c12-s06-e] /Italian [part0023.html#c12-s06-i]]22–25. [part0012.html#c12-s08-e] Dante seemingly intuits the extraordinaryeffect made by large symphony orchestras when called upon to modulate huge soundsuddenly into silence. If the reader imagines Beethoven as the background musicto this scene, perhaps he or she will better experience what is projected bythese verses. Of course, the miraculous sound has not so much to do withextraordinary musical abilities as it does with the result of living in God’sgrace, in which all is harmonious, even sudden silence. [return to English[part0012.html#c12-s08-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s08-i]]26–30. [part0012.html#c12-s09-e] These similetic elements of this passage (vv.22–30), two eyes opening or closing as one and Dante ineluctably being drawn tothe voice of a new spirit (it will turn out to be Bonaventure), speak to thesense of the overpowering quality of the love and beauty that affects both theperformers and their observer. Torraca (comm. to vv. 28–30) points out that thecompass, invented only a short while before, had already become a familiar imagein thirteenth-century Italian poetry, for example, in poems by Guido Guinizzelliand in Ristoro d’Arezzo. [return to English [part0012.html#c12-s09-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c12-s09-i]]31–33. [part0012.html#c12-s11-e] St. Bonaventure is about to praise the leaderof Thomas’s order, St. Dominic, in response to Thomas’s praise of Francis, theleader of his own. For information about the speaker, see the note to vv.127–128. [return to English [part0012.html#c12-s11-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c12-s11-i]]34–36. [part0012.html#c12-s12-e] In the previous canto (Par. XI.40–42) Thomashad gone out of his way to insist that praise of either Francis or Dominic isnecessarily praise of the other; Bonaventure matches him. [return to English[part0012.html#c12-s12-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s12-i]]35. [part0012.html#c12-s12-e] While Dante has made every effort to“militarize” the sweetness of St. Francis, making both him and Dominic share theverb militaro (lit. “soldiered”), the following three tercets show that he iswilling to associate himself with the traditional portrayal of Dominic aswarlike, while the traditional depiction of Francis is decidedly not (see thenote to Par. XI.91). On the other hand, it is again notable that he has includedFrancis within the construct of the Christian soldier. [return to English[part0012.html#c12-s12-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s12-i]]37–45. [part0012.html#c12-s13-e] These three tercets contain seven words thatassociate the two friars with militarism and imperial rule: essercito (army),riarmar (to rearm), insegna (battle standard), imperador (emperor), regna(reigns), milizia (soldiers), campioni (“champions,” i.e., those who excel insingle combat).

[part0012.html#c12-s13-e] The “troops” obviously form the ChurchMilitant, now led by the newly approved mendicant orders, expensive to rearm,since it took the blood of the apostles to accomplish that task (see Aversano[Aver.2000.2], p. 53, for reasons to prefer this gloss to that which insists thereference is to Christ’s blood, an interpretation unopposed since the earliestdays of the commentary tradition; Aversano refers the reader to Par. XXVII.40–45for confirming evidence). Despite that, the soldiers, apparently, still lackresolve. [return to English [part0012.html#c12-s13-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c12-s13-i]]38.

[part0012.html#c12-s14-e] The meaning is that God succored His“troops,” not because they were particularly worthy, but because He extendedthem His grace. For a clear summary of the two kinds of grace at work in Dante’sworld, operating grace (which Dante received from God, through the agency ofBeatrice, in Inferno II) and cooperating grace, see Scott (Scot.2004.2), pp.187–90. Once a sinner is justified by the receipt of operating grace, which isgratuitous (i.e., cannot be earned), he or she must “cooperate” in order tomerit eventual reward (salvation). Scott reviews the American discussion of thisissue, which was dominated by the views of Charles Singleton, until AntonioMastrobuono (Mast.1990.1) clarified the nature of the problem.

I.124 and Par. XXV.41) makes Dante’scomfort with imperial trappings clear, especially to his Guelph enemies. Thisterm for God is not in itself unwarranted in Christian tradition, far from it.But Dante uses it here in an ecclesiastical context where it might seem, atleast to some, improper.

[part0012.html#c12-s16-e] Dominic was “born 1170, in the village ofCalaroga, in Old Castile; he is supposed to have belonged to the noble family ofGuzmàn, his father’s name being Felix, his mother’s Joanna. The latter is saidto have dreamed before he was born that she gave birth to a dog with a torch inits mouth, which set the world on fire. At the age of fourteen he went to theuniversity of Palencia, where he studied theology for ten or twelve years. Hewas early noted for his self-denial and charity. In 1195 he became canon of thecathedral of Osma. In 1215 he accompanied Folquet, bishop of Toulouse, to theLateran Council; and in the same year, on his return to Toulouse, he founded hisorder of Preaching Friars, which was formally recognized by Honorius III in121[7]. He died in Aug. 1221 at Bologna, where he was buried. He was canonizedsoon after his death (in 1234) by Gregory IX” (T). And see G. R. Sarolli,“Domenico, santo,” ED II (1970), pp. 546–51. Sarolli points out that, whenDominic, with six companions, arrived in Toulouse in 1215, on the verge offorming a more structured group, he associated with Folco di Marsiglia (whom weencountered in Par. IX.88–102), the newly appointed bishop of that city. [returnto English [part0012.html#c12-s16-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s16-i]]46.

[part0012.html#c12-s17-e] Torraca (comm. to vv. 56–57) thinks that thewaves are found on the surface of the Ebro, the river running two miles fromDominic’s native city, an argument contested vigorously by Bertoldi(Bert.1913.1), pp. 45–46, who supports the early commentators’ belief that thereference is to the Atlantic Ocean. Others specify the Bay of Biscay. AfterScartazzini (comm. to vv. 49–51), however, the ruling understanding is that thepassage refers to this smaller body of water.The sun hides itself from human sight when, at or near the summer solstice, itsets beyond the sight of those on land, because it has moved so far out over theAtlantic. For Dante, we must remember, to the west of the Gates of Hercules lies“the world where no one lives” (Inf. XXVI.117).

[part0012.html#c12-s18-e] “The royal arms of Castile show a castle inthe second and third quarters, and a lion in the first and fourth. Thus on oneside of the shield the lion is subdued by the castle, and on the other subduesit” (Oelsner, comm. to these verses). The images represent the kingdoms ofCastile and Leon, respectively. [return to English [part0012.html#c12-s18-e] /Italian [part0023.html#c12-s18-i]]55. [part0012.html#c12-s19-e] The vocabulary of feudal times (drudo, “vassal”)combines with that of erotic poetry (amoroso, “loving”) to interrupt themilitary associations of Dominic, and eventually presents him, like Francis, asa “husband” (see verse 61, sponsalizie, “nuptials”). The word drudo, a triplehapax, that is, a word appearing once in each cantica (see Hollander[Holl.1988.3] for a listing of all examples of this phenomenon in the poem),occurs previously in Inferno XVIII.134 and Purgatorio XXXII.155, in both casesreferring to a male partner in an illicit sexual liaison, in the first case, theman sleeping with the whore Thaïs; in the second, the giant beating his harlot,the Church in its Avignonian captivity. Thus its context in the poem worksagainst those who would read Dante’s treatment of Dominic as sugar-coated (seethe note to verse 57).The new interpretation of the second scene offered by Bognini (Bogn.2007.1) doesnot change the valence of the preceding remark, but does alter the identities ofthe “actors” in the pageant in Purgatorio XXXII. In a new (and entirelyconvincing) reading of the major characters in that scene, Bognini demonstratesthat the whore is Ezechiel’s Jerusalem and thus Dante’s Florence, while thegiant reflects Goliath as Robert of Anjou, the king of Naples and the Guelphleader in Italy, prime enemy of Henry VII.

[part0012.html#c12-s19-e] If Francis is presented as a lover, Dominic is(here) presented as a fighter, but even here he is first described (verse 55) asl’amoroso drudo. See the note to verse 55.

[part0012.html#c12-s19-e] Spiazzi (Spia.1989.1), pp. 339–41, thinks thatthe word crudo (cruel) is uncalled for, and he sets off on a lengthy defense:St. Dominic was in fact, and despite his crusading spirit, the mostmild-mannered person imaginable. However, others take this verse at face value,and see its pertinence to Dominic’s labors against the Cathars (e.g.,Ghisalberti [Ghis.2002.1], pp. 184–86), during the period 1203 to 1210, whenDominic moved from preaching and debate to more violent means; but evenGhisalberti insists on the predominance of the “sweet” approach. Others havebeen less tolerant of Dominic’s behavior. This is the last of thirteenappearances of the adjective crudo in the poem (leaving to one side the relatedwords crudele, crudeltà, etc.); in none of the preceding dozen presences of theword does it have a mitigated meaning. As a result, the motives of those whoargue for such mitigation here seem suspect. Dominic, as presented by Dante, isa tough warrior whom he goes out of his way also to present as a “lover.”[return to English [part0012.html#c12-s19-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c12-s19-i]]58–60. [part0012.html#c12-s20-e] The embryonic mind of Dominic was so powerfulthat it could send concepts (or at least images) to the mother who was bearinghim. In this way he lent his mother the gift of prophecy. The early commentatorsare frequently misled, and think the reference of “lei” is not to the mother butto Dominic’s mente in the preceding line, thus making a prophet of him. However,legend has it that, before his birth, his mother had a dream of ablack-and-white dog who carried a torch in its mouth, which set fire to thewhole world. That is what most of its interpreters today believe is referencedin the line, the mother’s vision of her unborn son’s wide effect on humanity.Since the colors of the habits of the Dominicans are black and white and sincean easily available pun (Domini canes = the dogs of God) was in circulation atthe time and was included in the first official “Life” of Dominic (by Teodoricod’Appoldia), the dream became a permanent piece of Dominican lore.Frequent in discussions of this passage are citations of Isaiah 49:1, “Dominusab utero vocavit me” (The Lord has called me from the womb); but see also Luke1:15, “Spiritu Sancto replebitur adhuc ex utero matris suae” (and he shall befilled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb), describing John theBaptist, referred to by Di Biase (Dibi.1992.1), p. 40n.

[part0012.html#c12-s21-e] A difficult line to translate convincingly,partly because the noun salute has different meanings in Dante. In Dominic’scase, he will find salvation in his faith; he cannot “save” her, but he doeskeep her safe from heresy. Vellutello’s gloss (comm. to vv. 61–66) has guided usas far as the sense is concerned: “because he saved the Faith, battling for itagainst heretics, and she in turn kept him safe.” [return to English[part0012.html#c12-s21-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s21-i]]64–66.

[part0012.html#c12-s23-e] The riddling diction yields its meaning afteronly a little effort. As Tozer (comm. to this tercet) unravels it: “Aninspiration from Heaven (Quinci) was communicated to his parents to name him bythe possessive adjective (viz. Dominicus) derived from the name of the Lord(Dominus), who possessed him entirely.” [return to English[part0012.html#c12-s23-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c12-s23-i]]67. [part0012.html#c12-s23-e] The word costrutto has caused a certaindifficulty. In modern Italian it means “sense, meaning,” but that meaning is noteasily assigned to the word here. Tozer (comm. to vv. 67–69) sorts things out asfollows: “… ‘that he might be in name what he was in reality’; costrutto: ‘theform of his name’; similarly in Purg. XXVIII.147 costrutto means ‘a form ofwords’ or ‘sentence’: and in Par. XXIII.24 senza costrutto is ‘without puttingit into words.’ ” [return to English [part0012.html#c12-s23-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c12-s23-i]]68.

There will be three others, occurring in Paradiso XIV.104–108,XIX.104–108, and XXXII.83–87. For a valuable early study of this phenomenon, seeFrancesco D’Ovidio (Dovi.1901.1). It is clear that, for Dante’s purposes, noother word is good enough to rhyme with “Christ,” who is the Word. For the nexttercet that contains the word Cristo four times, see Paradiso.Porena (comm. to vv. 73–78) holds that D’Ovidio was correct to argue that theword Cristo is allowed to rhyme only with itself because, as a penitentialgesture, Dante wants to undo the scabrous act he had perpetrated when, in one ofhis sonnets attacking Forese Donati’s behaviors, he had rhymed the name of theLord with tristo (distraught) and malo acquisto (ill-gotten gains).

In the past one hundred years there has been continuing anduncertain discussion of this seemingly simple question. But it was not alwaysthus. Almost every early commentator seizes on the same biblical passage,Matthew 19:21, Christ’s advice to the rich young man to sell all that hepossesses, give the proceeds to the poor, and then follow Him. For a summarizingsense of nearly six hundred years of near-total agreement, see Oelsner (comm. toverse 75): “The counsel of poverty (Matth. 19:21, whence the phrase ‘counsels ofperfection’). Thomas Aquinas, while distinguishing between the precepts and thecounsels of Christ, says that the latter may all be reduced to three—Poverty,Continence, and Obedience. The first counsel, then, is Poverty.”The problem of the precise reference in verse 75 is complicated by theneighboring presences of two instances of the adjective primo (first). Are theyused as synonyms, in both cases having a temporal relevance, or not? We thinkthat they are, and thus have translated as we have (“since the first lovemanifest in him / was for the initial precept taught by Christ”). Some, however,believe that the first primo is temporal, that the second has to do with orderof importance, that is, the most important of Christ’s teachings, which wouldoffer a bit more latitude as one searched through the Gospels. If we arecorrect, what then is “the initial precept” taught by Jesus? (Salsano,“consiglio,” ED II [1970], p. 159b, understands consiglio to equate with“precetto divino.”) That can in fact be the first Beatitude. Or, if Oelsner (seeabove) is correct, and Dante’s sense of the word consiglio flows through St.Thomas’s distinction between it and “precept,” then the first “counsel” mayindeed be thought of as accepting poverty, first among the three “counsels” ofChrist, poverty, continence, obedience. Either way, poverty is the issue focalto this line. This seems more than acceptable, since Dominic is presented asparallel in his virtues to Francis (Grandgent [comm. to verse 75] points outthat vv. 73–75 of both cantos thus deal with poverty), since Dominicans as wellas Franciscans took vows of poverty, and since the next tercet, although alsoless clear than some might like, would seem to associate him both with Francisand with poverty as well.

[part0012.html#c12-s26-e] “For this have I come”: See Mark 1:38, “adhoc enim veni,” as Jesus announces his intention to preach. The baby Dominic’scloseness to the earth reminds us of the similar association of Francis,indelibly associated with the dust at the end of his life (Par. XI.115–117).Poverty and humility, more usually associated with Francis, are both present inthis vignette, as preconditions for Dominic’s preacherly calling.

[part0012.html#c12-s28-e] Dominic’s honest religiosity is contrastedwith the eye-on-the-prize sort of sham activities of two intellectuals, both ofwhom died within Dante’s lifetime. The first, Enrico di Susa, from Ostia (diedin 1271), was a famous canon lawyer (and thus Dante fires another salvo at thevenal practitioners of this profession), while Taddeo d’Alderotto (the probablereference is to him) was a Florentine (died in 1295) who studied and then taughtmedicine at Bologna. Dante mocks his translation of Aristotle’s Ethics inConvivio I.x.10. In these two men Dante pillories two kinds of falseintellectual activity—religious law and Aristotelian science—both of which wereof great importance to him.

[part0012.html#c12-s30-e] Carroll (comm. to vv. 46–105) paraphrasesthis elegant pastiche of a canon lawyer’s style as follows: “[Dominic] askedfrom the Head of the Church none of the evil privileges so eagerly sought for byothers: to distribute only a third or a half of moneys left for charitablepurposes, retaining the rest; to receive the first vacant benefice; or to usefor himself the tithes which belong to God’s poor.

[part0012.html#c12-s30-e] Bonaventure, here most assuredly Dante’smouthpiece, distinguishes between the papacy, in its design supportive of thepoor, and the pope (the hated Boniface VIII in 1300), ignoring that design.[return to English [part0012.html#c12-s30-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c12-s30-i]]91–93. [part0012.html#c12-s31-e] These three corrupt practices all reveal theavarice of prelates, the first and third involving theft of monies destined forthe poor, the second, advancement in ecclesiastical position. For this last, seeTozer (comm. to this tercet): “The reference is to the expectationes, ornominations to posts not yet vacant that popes of the day were pleased to make.”Obviously, none of these self-aggrandizing activities had as their goal supportfor the benevolent tasks that customarily fell to the Church.

[part0012.html#c12-s31-e] The Latin (“the tenth part that belongs to thepoor,” the tax collected by the clergy) refers to the tithe, the 10 percent of aparishioner’s income that the Church collected in order to help feed and clothethe poor. Not even this was safe from predatory clergy, who took these funds fortheir own use. [return to English [part0012.html#c12-s31-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c12-s31-i]]95. [part0012.html#c12-s32-e] See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse):Dominic’s request for approval of his order was made to Pope Innocent III in1215, and approved only in late 1216 by Pope Honorius III, the newly electedpope (the Church had for a time prohibited the formation of new orders).However, in 1205, Dominic had gone to Rome, seeking permission to wage acampaign against heretics, which was granted. Between 1207 and 1214 he was partof the eventually bloody attempt to bring the Albigensian Cathars back into thefold, alongside of Folco di Marsiglia (see the notes to Par. IX.40 and to Par.IX.94). Bosco/Reggio try to keep Dominic’s hands free of Albigensian blood,saying that on the day of the terrible battle of Muret (12 September 1213),Dominic was at prayer in a church. However, given the poet’s praise of Folco,who was the leader of that crusade (if Simon de Montfort was in charge of thearmy at that particular battle), he may have imagined a Dominic as warlike ashis Folco. See vv. 97–102, where Dominic’s forcefulness in combating heresy isapplauded. [return to English [part0012.html#c12-s32-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c12-s32-i]]96.

[part0012.html#c12-s33-e] While the militarism of Dominic’s order maybe metaphorical, referring to his preaching, that his “career” began with aliteral war, the crusade against the Albigensians, certainly colors these lines,whatever Dante’s intention.

[part0012.html#c12-s36-e] These verses offer a kind of summary ofboth saints’ lives.

Where in the last canto the image of Thomas’s order was a merchantship, here that founded by Francis is presented as a chariot of war.Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) complain that, after the fresh andconvincing images of the last canto, some of those encountered in this one,beginning with these chariot wheels, seem forced. Here Dominic is compared tothe rim of a wheel that leaves a clear imprint in the earth, while his followersdo no such thing.

[part0012.html#c12-s39-e] There is agreement among the commentators aboutthe difficulty of making exact sense of this verse. We have not attempted to domore than give its obvious general meaning, though it happens that we are infairly close agreement with the gloss of Daniele Mattalia to this tercet, whotakes issue with some of the more strained attempts to make sense of this line,that is, the understanding, begun with Michele Barbi (Barb.1934.1, p. 287), thatthe Franciscan backsliders retrogress while facing forward, moving their frontfoot back toward (and then behind?) the other. Even if Dominic has beendescribed as “the holy athlete” (verse 56), that way of retrogression seems torequire muscular skills and patience well beyond those of most corrupt barefootfriars. Momigliano (comm. to vv. 115–117) justly complains that this line seemsforced and lays some of the blame for that on the verb form gitta (lit.“throws”), forced by rhyme.

[part0012.html#c12-s40-e] The obvious Scriptural allusion (to Matthew13:24–30, the parable of the wheat and the tares) somehow seems to have escapedthe earliest commentators. It appears first in Landino (comm. to these verses)and then is repeated in almost all subsequent comments. The reference of thetercet is a cause of some debate. See Manselli, “francescanesimo,” ED III(1971), pp. 115–16; his view is that the word “loglio” (tares) does not refer tothe Spiritual Franciscans, as some believe, but to all corrupt members of theorder, whatever their leaning in the controversy between Spirituals andConventuals.

[part0012.html#c12-s41-e] The word volume (volume), occurring first inInferno I.84 and last in Paradiso XXXIII. 86, literally runs from one end of thepoem to the other. It occurs nine times and always either refers to God’s book(the Scriptures) or to his “other book,” the created universe (except in itsfirst use, where it refers to the Aeneid [see the note to Inf. I.84]). Thus, torefer to the slender booklet, the Rule of the Franciscan Order, as a volume isto employ a heavy word.

[part0012.html#c12-s42-e] Cosmo (Cosm.1936.1), pp. 149–54, contraststhe inner tension among the Franciscan ranks with the struggles that afflictedDominic’s order, shaped by external enemies. For a study locating Francis, asDante does here, in the middle, see Stanislao da Campagnola (Daca.1983.1); andfor his indebtedness to Ubertino’s very words for his characterizations ofFrancis (seraphicus) and Dominic (cherubicus), see p. 182n. See also Manselli(Mans.1982.1) for an overview of Dante’s response to the Spiritual Franciscans,with many bibliographical indications in the notes. Mario Trovato (Trov.1995.1),p. 168, on the additional basis of his interpretation of Paradiso XI.109–114,lends his support to Manselli’s position. And for what has been the standardview of the tension among the Conventual and Spiritual Franciscans themselves(at least after Manselli’s work), see Manselli (Mans.1982.1), pp. 57–58: Matteod’Acquasparta is criticized for loosening the strictures of the Rule of theorder, while Ubertino da Casale is seen as being too rigid in his adherence tothe founder’s insistence on the importance of poverty in a true Christian life.[return to English [part0012.html#c12-s42-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c12-s42-i]]125. [part0012.html#c12-s42-e] We have translated “la scrittura” in thenarrowest sense (“the Rule”). In Dante’s Italian the word has meant both writingin general and, on some occasions, the Bible. Here it is a third form ofwriting, something more than ordinary words and to be taken as postbiblical, buthaving a similar authority. (See the note to verse 122 for the similar status ofthe noun volume.) Aversano (Aver.1984.2), pp. 23–24, points out that Francis wasso concerned that his Rule would be fraudulently emended that he encouraged hisfriars to memorize it.

[part0012.html#c12-s43-e] “St. Bonaventura was born at Bagnoregio(now Bagnorea) near Orvieto in 1221, the year of St. Dominic’s death. As a childhe was attacked by a dangerous disease, which was miraculously cured by St.Francis of Assisi. When the latter heard that the child had recovered he is saidto have exclaimed ‘buona ventura,’ whereupon the boy’s mother changed his nameto Bonaventura. In 1238 or 1243 he entered the Franciscan order. After studyingin Paris under Alexander of Hales, he became successively professor ofphilosophy and theology, and in 1257 was made doctor. Having risen to be generalof the Franciscan order (in 1257), he was offered the archbishopric of Albano byGregory X, whom he accompanied to the second Council of Lyons, where he died,July 15,1274, ‘his magnificent funeral being attended by a pope, an emperor, anda king.’ St. Bonaventura was canonized in 1482 by Sixtus IV, and placed amongthe doctors of the Church, with the title of Doctor Seraphicus, by Sixtus V”(T). The word vita, used here by Bonaventure to identify himself as a soul ingrace, is used with this sense for the second time in the poem (see the note toPar. IX.7).For Dante’s debt to mysticism, as focused for him in the writings ofBonaventure, see Meekins (Meek.1997.1). For the possibility that Dante read theapparent contradictions between the positions of Aquinas and Bonaventuresyncretistically, see Mazzotta (Mazz.2003.1) and Gragnolati (Grag.2005.1), pp.58–77. Di Somma (Diso.1986.1), p. 50n., argues for the central importance ofBonaventure’s Itinerarium mentis in Deum for all of Dante’s poem, not only forthis canto. A survey of Bonaventure’s presence in the Dartmouth Dante Projectreveals that the vast majority of references to “Bonaventura” before the end ofthe nineteenth century occur only in notes to this canto, in which he is a named(and thus inescapable) presence. Thus we realize, after a few minutes ofsearching, that a serious use of Bonaventure’s texts as a guide to Dante is afairly recent development. In fact, it is only in Scartazzini’s commentary thatone finds a total of more references to him in all the other cantos than onefinds to him in this one. After Scartazzini, that situation begins to change.(English readers will find that in this particular, as well as in others, JohnCarroll outstrips his competitors.) See Hagman (Hagm.1988.1) for a study ofBonaventure’s extensive and overall importance to Dante. But see Sofia VanniRovighi, “Bonaventura da Bagnoreggio, santo,” ED I (1970), p. 673, arguing thatattempts to show a direct textual dependence of Dante on Bonaventure have hadonly dubious results; all one can say is that his work (the Itinerarium mentisin Deum in particular) is a generic model for the outline of the Comedy, withoutbeing able to make more of a claim for it than that.

[part0012.html#c12-s43-e] The “left-hand care” reflects the traditionallink between left- and right-handedness as reflecting, respectively, “sinister”(the Latin word for “left”) and positive purposes. The former here signifies“worldly concerns.” Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 127–141) does not attempt tobanish cares of the world from the curate’s interest, but does say that he doesnot (and must not) treat them as having the same importance as issues related toeternal life.

The first was a nobleman from Rieti, who accompanied him onhis voyage to Egypt. Augustino was a townsman of Francis and eventually becamehead of a chapter of the order in Terra di Lavoro. Neither one of them isparticularly associated with knowledge, which causes Benvenuto (comm. to vv.130–132) to wonder why these two homines ignorantes were included here. He goeson to admire Dante’s subtlety in doing so, for they, if not great intellectsthemselves, helped others to become, by their labor and example, more wise.It was only in 1960 that a commentator on this verse (Mattalia), responding to anumber of Dantists who raised the issue, suggested that a predictable reactionin one who is reading this line might very well be: “But that’s not SaintAugustine of Hippo; where is he in all this?” (And we have to wait for ParadisoXXXII.35 to find that he is indeed among the blessed; see the note to thattercet.) For the last time he was named, see Paradiso X.120, but without mentionof his eventual fate. Is it possible that Dante is playing a game with us? Hementions the actual St. Augustine in the last canto, where we might haveexpected to find him, among other theologians in the Sun; he now mentions asaved soul named “Augustine” who is not he but who is here. Both these gestureslead us to contemplate the possibility that Dante is teasing us. There will besome speculation as to his reasons for doing so in a note to ParadisoXXXII.34–36, a passage that situates Augustine among the inhabitants of thecelestial Rose.

[part0012.html#c13-s01-e] Dante’s reconstruction of two perfecttwelve-studded circles (each of which he has already seen and described in theimmediately preceding cantos [Par. X.64–69; XII.1–21]) into apparently fancifulconstituent groupings has, understandably, drawn some perplexed attention. (Itis perhaps difficult not to think of the role that the poet assumes as beinganalogous to that of the geomancers, Purg. XIX.4–6, who similarly constructtheir “Fortuna Major” out of existing constellations.) What is the reason, wemight wonder, for the numbering of the three subgroups as fifteen, seven, andtwo to equal twenty-four? For Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses), this is arare case of Dante’s taste for arid preciosity (un preziosismo tuttointellettualistico). In any case, the fifteen brightest stars found in theeighth heaven are to be imagined as being conjoined with all the seven that makeup the Big Dipper and with two from the Little Dipper (see the note to vv.13–15), thus representing the twenty-four “stars” to whom we have already beenintroduced. In order to formulate a reason for the fifteen in the first group,Francesco da Buti points out (comm. to vv. 1–21) that Alfraganus, in thenineteenth chapter of his Elementa astronomica, says that in the eighth spherethere are precisely fifteen stars of the first magnitude (i.e., in brightnessand size). Niccolò Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 4–6) cites Ptolemy’s Almagest for thesame information (first referred to in this context by Jacopo della Lana [comm.to vv. 1–6]), adding the detail that these fifteen may be found situatedvariously in either hemisphere. However, that there should be nine in the lasttwo groupings, both of which are associated with locating the position of theNorth Star, may reveal the design of a plan. As we have seen (Par. II.7–9), thePole Star stands in for divine guidance; thus here the twin circles of Christiansapience are associated both with divine intellectual purpose and with thenumber that represents Beatrice, who is more clearly associated with the Wisdomof God, Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity, than with anything else.[return to English [part0012.html#c13-s01-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c13-s01-i]]2–3. [part0012.html#c13-s01-e] This self-conscious literary gesture seeks toinvolve us as coconspirators in manufacturing a substitute solar system. We, as“secondary artists,” are asked to collaborate, making ourselves responsible forliteralizing the details of Dante’s vision and keeping them in memory.

[part0012.html#c13-s04-e] See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) forthe following explanation of what is surely the most convoluted element in analready convoluted passage: Dante asks us to imagine two stars of the LittleDipper farthest from its tip as the bell of a trumpet for which the Pole Star(at that tip) is the mouthpiece. This last point intersects, according to Dante(forcing the issue to his own purpose, according to Porena [comm. to vv.10–12]), with the Primum Mobile. The universe is thus conceived of as a giganticwheel, with a diameter running between our earth and the Crystalline sphere(even if, as Porena points out, the situation of the North Star in the eighthsphere precludes its having contact with the ninth).

Her “crown” refers to the garland taken from her head by Bacchus aftershe died, having been abandoned by Theseus. Bacchus placed it in the heavens,where it is known as the Corona Borealis (see Ovid, Metam. VIII.174–182). Dantecompares it, a single thing, to a double rainbow. (That Dante refers to Ariadneas herself being translated to the heavens, and not only her garland of flowers,has troubled some commentators. However, in a sort of reverse metonymy, Dantehas given the whole for the part; he clearly wants us to think of Ariadne’sgarland as representing a circle of saints—twice. In the last canto (Par.XII.12) Juno’s handmaid (the unnamed Iris) is doubled in the sky, just as hereMinos’s daughter (the unnamed Ariadne) is.That the canto eventually finds its fullest expression of its central theme inDaedalus’s trembling hand (see discussion in the note to vv. 67–78), an objectthat probably has its source in the next episode in Ovid (Metam. VIII.183–235),tends to strengthen the case for the aptness of the citation from that samelocus here. [return to English [part0012.html#c13-s05-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c13-s05-i]]16–18. [part0012.html#c13-s06-e] Still another troubled tercet. The firstdifficulty that it presents is fairly easy to resolve: Does the second circleextend beyond the first or does it stand within it? Most commentators sensiblytake the first view, since the third circle clearly is wider than the second(Par. XIV.74–75), which at least implies that the second is wider than the firstand, indeed, contains it. The really obdurate problem, on the other hand, is howto construe verse 18. If one says “one went first and then the other followed”(as we translate the line), the meaning is that one of the circles begins tomove only after the other does (and probably the first is followed by thesecond). This hypothesis is seconded by the rhyme position of the word poi, usedfor the only time in the poem as a substantive, a usage that pretty clearly isforced by rhyme. What would Dante have said had he been writing parole sciolte(words not bound by meter—see Inf. XXVIII.1) and not been constrained by theneed to rhyme? A good case can be made for “secondo” (i.e., next). And for thisreason, we have translated the line as we have. See also Fasani (Fasa.2002.1),p. 194, buttressing this position with the early gloss of Francesco da Buti(comm. to vv. 1–21). After centuries of inconclusive debate, refusing to choosebetween the two established and conflicting views, Trucchi (comm. to thistercet) came up with a new hypothesis: Since the two concentric circles move sothat the rays sent out by each reflect one another perfectly (he was thinking offacing pairs, Thomas and Bonaventure, Siger and Joachim, etc.), the circles,since they are of different extent, to maintain this unwavering relationshipbetween themselves, must move at different speeds. Giacalone (comm. to thistercet) shares Trucchi’s view, but credits Buti’s less clear statement (comm. tovv. 1–21) for preparing the way.

XXX.78). Here the reference to the veracostellazione has a similar typological rhythm: What Dante saw yields to itsrealer version, the two circles of moving, singing saints in their “doubledance.” [return to English [part0012.html#c13-s07-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c13-s07-i]]22–24. [part0012.html#c13-s08-e] Now the purpose of our “imagining” along withDante that starry construct becomes clear: The reality to which it correspondsis as far beyond our conceiving as the circling of the Primum Mobile exceeds inspeed the movement of the Chiana, a sluggish stream in Tuscany that turned tomarsh in some places, probably referred to, without being named, in InfernoXXIX.46–49.

Reduced to its core, this is what heconveys to the protagonist: “You believe that God, when he created Adam and (thehuman part of) Christ, gave each of them as much intellect as it was possible tocreate in a human being; if that is so, you wonder, how can I have said thatSolomon’s intelligence never was bettered by another’s?

While it seems thatthe third of these alternatives is the most appealing (because it builds on theparallel structure of the entire passage, moving from Adam’s rib to Christ’swounded side), it is also true that all three interpretations cause similarreflection: Christ died for our sins.According to Schwarz (Schw.1966.1), pp. 147–48, these lines reflect the opinionof Peter Olivi (against the account found in John 19:30) that Jesus was piercedby the lance while he was still alive. Schwarz believes that Paradiso XXXII.128reflects the same understanding. For the view that Dante was deeply aware ofOlivi’s work and essentially agreed with it, but never mentions his name becausethe Franciscan was being vigorously attacked by Church officials in Provence,who managed to have his Lectura super Apocalypsim condemned, see Manselli,“francescanesimo,” ED III (1971), p. 16.

All other human bodies are formed with the influenceof intermediating agencies (i.e., the angels and the stars). And thus, inDante’s view, Thomas’s statement of Solomon’s singular intellectual gifts (Par.X.112–114) does indeed require further explanation, to which a goodly portion ofthe rest of the canto (vv. 49–111) will be devoted.

[part0012.html#c13-s17-e] This tercet perhaps exemplifies the“unpoetic” quality of this canto (representing the sort of “philosophicdiscourse” that Benedetto Croce so often inveighed against [e.g., Croc.1921.1]),the cause of its being denigrated even by those to whose lot it fell to writelecturae dedicated to it.

[part0012.html#c13-s17-e] Thomas’s figure of speech, insisting thatDante’s view of Adam’s and Christ’s knowledge and his own championing ofSolomon’s not only do not contradict one another, but are equally close to thetruth as are two points coinciding at the center of a circle. [return to English[part0012.html#c13-s17-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c13-s17-i]]52–87. [part0012.html#c13-s18-e] This portion of Thomas’s speech is one of themost “philosophical” in the entire poem. It may serve as a pretext for answeringthe protagonist’s concern about Solomon’s relative perfection as knower; at thesame time we sense that the poet simply wanted to posit his view of primary andsecondary creation.For a straightforward explanation, in simplified terms, of the passage, seeTozer (comm. to these verses): “What is created directly by God is perfect,whereas that which is created indirectly by Him through intermediate agenciesand materials is imperfect; and therefore Dante is right in thinking that Adam,and Christ in His human nature, who belong to the former class, must have beensuperior in wisdom to all men, and therefore to Solomon.” [return to English[part0012.html#c13-s18-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c13-s18-i]]52. [part0012.html#c13-s18-e] “That which does not die” resolves into God, theangels, the heavens, prime matter, and the human soul; “that which must [die]”refers to all corruptible things (see Par.

[part0012.html#c13-s19-e] The first step in this procession of God intoHis universe is for the Trinity to be reflected in the nine orders of angels(see the note to verse 59). See Moevs on these six verses: “The Trinity evokedin the [preceding] tercet is evoked again [in this one]: the Word-Son is aliving light … which flows from the source of light ( … the Father), but is notother than … its source: both are a power of love, … which ‘en-threes’ itselfwith them” (Moev.2005.1), p. 121.

[part0012.html#c13-s19-e] Dante’s coinage intrearsi (literally, “tointhree oneself”) represents a form of linguistic boldness to which the readerhas perhaps become accustomed. See, for example, the verb incinquarsi(literally, “to infive oneself”) in Paradiso IX.40. [return to English[part0012.html#c13-s19-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c13-s19-i]]59. [part0012.html#c13-s20-e] This is the first appearance (see Par.XXXIII.115; and see Par. XXIX.15 for the shining angelic substance announcingitself in the Latin verb Subsisto) of the Scholastic-flavored noun“subsistence,” that is, existence as purely related to God’s nature as ispossible, here, in the nine orders of angels. Compare Paradiso XIV.73 and thenote thereto. And see Alfonso Maierù, “sussistenza,” ED V (1976), pp. 493a–494b,who cites Boethius, in De duabus naturis, referring to “a being, which, in orderto be able itself to exist, has no need of any other being.” See also Tozer(comm. to vv. 58–59): “These are called ‘subsistences,’ because this is theScholastic term for that which exists by itself, and not in anything else; cp.Aquinas [ST I, q. 29, a. 2].” Among the earliest commentators there is a certainhesitation in choosing between angels and heavens (e.g., Jacopo della Lana[comm. to vv. 55–60]). Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 55–60), however, is definitive inseeing the angels here (“idest in novem ordines angelorum”). The disputemeandered along until Scartazzini’s magisterial review (comm. to this verse) ofthat errancy and his interpretation fixed the identification (Benvenuto’s) fornearly all later discussants: the nine orders of angels. Scartazzini invokespassages in Dante’s own texts: Epistle XIII, Convivio II.v and III.xiv, and mostparticularly Paradiso XXIX.142–145. Today one cannot find a discussant who hasnot benefited from Scartazzini’s gloss, whether directly or indirectly; at thesame time one can find no commentator (at least not among those included in theDDP) who even mentions him, although Singleton (comm. to this verse) does citetwo of the Dantean passages that he cited.

[part0012.html#c13-s21-e] The second stage of God’s progression (forthe first see the note to vv. 55–60) is into that part of the universe createdout of the four elements and, not directly by God, but indirectly and by variousagencies. Lombardi (comm. to vv. 55–63) refers the reader to Paradiso II.112–141for an earlier exposition of this process. The light of the Word (verse 55)blends its creative power with the angelic presences in each heavenly sphere,moving downward “from act to act” and reaching the elements, until it finallyinteracts with the most short-lived perishable things, brevi contingenze (briefcontingencies). According to Scholastic philosophy, contingent things have thepotential either to be or not to be, depending on the presence or absence of aconjoined formal property. Those perishable things that are shaped by form are,if produced from seed, animal or vegetable; if not, mineral. [return to English[part0012.html#c13-s21-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c13-s21-i]]67–78. [part0012.html#c13-s23-e] To explain the principle of difference, theresults of which are so noticeable to any observer of any species, Thomas,wanting to avoid imputing to God a causal relation with mortality, ugliness,and/or failure, puts the blame for such things on Great Creating Nature. Thusthe angel-derived powers of the planetary spheres are seen as waxing and waning,and the resultant creations (e.g., human beings, horses, zucchini, and garnets)variable.Courtney Cahill (Cahi.1996.1), pp. 256–65, discusses this passage at some length(in a portion of her study subtitled “The Limitations of the artista in Thomas’sDiscourse on Creation”). Among other things, she puts forward the tellingargument (p. 268, n. 25) that Thomas’s initial presentation of Nature as perfectmaker of God’s creation is intentionally contradicted here, in order to accountfor the difference we find all around us in the world. She also finds that theimage of the artist’s trembling hand reflects that of Daedalus, as portrayed byOvid (Metam. VIII.211), citing Hollander (Holl.1992.2), pp. 229–30, for anearlier and identical observation. See also Hollander (Holl.1983.1), p. 135n.,for the suggestion that this passage may also reflect Aeneid VI.32–33,recounting Daedalus’s double fatherly failure as artist to portray in gold hisson’s fall from the skies.As opposed to her performance in God’s direct creation, Nature, when she isworking with the “wax” of secondary creation (i.e., not the first man, Adam, buthis descendants; not the first apple, but the succeeding “generations” of thefruit, etc.), is always defective, coming up short of the archetype.

[part0012.html#c13-s27-e] Once again the Trinity is referred to—Spirit,Son, Father (in that order)—in order to distinguish between direct creation,under God’s unshared auspices, as distinct from the natural secondary creationof which we have just heard. Thus twice in history human beings were madeoutside the natural process, with the creation of Adam (as well as Eve, now notreferred to by Dante, perhaps, but we can hardly forget that she was indeedremembered in vv. 37–39) and of Jesus marking the limits of human perfection,well beyond the otherwise unmatchable king of Israel. [return to English[part0012.html#c13-s27-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c13-s27-i]]88–96. [part0012.html#c13-s30-e] Without further explanation, Thomas says,Dante might still remain dubious; if he only considers who Solomon was and whatmoved him to ask for wisdom, he will understand. See III Kings 3:5–12, in whichpassage God appears to Solomon in a dream and promises to grant him whatever heasks for. Solomon responds by saying that God has made His servant into a king,but a king who has need of a knowing heart to judge his people. God, pleased byhis answer, replies (in the passage quoted in Par. X.114 [and see the note tovv. 109–114]) “dedi tibi cor sapiens et intelligens, in tantum ut nullus ante tesimilis tui fuerit nec post te surrecturus sit” (I have given you a wise and anunderstanding heart; so that there was none like you before you, nor after youshall any arise who is like you [III Kings 3:12—italics added]).According to Toffanin (Toff.1968.1), p. 453, Dante’s veneration of Solomon theking is the high point of his Ghibellinism. [return to English[part0012.html#c13-s30-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c13-s30-i]]97–102. [part0012.html#c13-s33-e] Thomas now contrasts practical kingly wisdomwith typical Scholastic speculations, drawn from the following four fields:speculative theology (How many are the angels?), dialectic (Will a mixture of anecessary and a contingent premise ever yield a necessary conclusion?), naturalscience (Must we grant that motion had a beginning?), and geometry (Can atriangle be constructed in a semicircle in such a way that it not contain aright angle?). (All four answers are negative, beginning with the fact that,according to Dante, the angels are not numerable.) In Dante’s view, Solomon’spractical wisdom trumps all such formal intelligence. However, for a fardifferent appraisal of Solomon’s kingly wisdom, see Carroll (comm. to vv.88–111): “The real difficulty is that, history being the witness, all Solomon’swisdom did not make him ‘sufficient as a king.’ The outward brilliance of hisreign was but a veil which hid for the moment the slow sapping of his people’sstrength and character through his luxury and licentiousness, his tyrannies,exactions, and idolatries. He sowed the wind, and his son reaped the whirlwindwhen the down-trodden people rent the greater part of the kingdom out of hishand. Whatever Dante may say, Solomon as a king was perhaps the wisest fool whoever lived. In saying this, I am quite aware that I may be incurring the censureon hasty judgments with which Canto XIII closes.”On Solomon’s song as leading to truthful (and not seductive, deceiving) love,see Chiarenza (Chia.2000.1).

[part0012.html#c13-s33-e] For Dante’s own thoughts on this question, seeConvivio II.iv.3–15 and II.v.4–5, Paradiso XXVIII.92–93 and XXIX.130–135. Theangels are “quasi innumerabili” (all but innumerable [Conv. II.v.5]). [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c13-s33-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c13-s33-i]]98–99. [part0012.html#c13-s33-e] For a helpful guide through the maze ofmedieval logical procedures, see Oelsner (comm. to vv. 97–102): “It is a generalprinciple that no limitation that occurs in either of the premises can beescaped in the conclusion. Thus, if either of the premises is negative youcannot get a positive conclusion; if either of them is particular you cannot geta general conclusion; if either is contingent you cannot get a necessaryconclusion. For instance, from ‘The man on whom the lot falls must besacrificed,’ and ‘The lot may fall on you,’ you can infer: ‘therefore you may besacrificed,’ but not ‘therefore you must be sacrificed.’ Ingenious attempts toget a necessary conclusion out of a necessary and a contingent premise areexposed by the logicians, e.g. ‘Anyone who may run from the foe must be acoward; some of these troops may run from the foe, therefore some of them mustbe cowards.’ The fallacy lies in the ambiguous use of ‘may run from the foe.’ Inthe first instance it means, ‘is, as a matter of fact, capable of running away’;in the second, ‘may, for anything I know, run away.’ So that the twopropositions do not hang together, and the conclusion is invalid.” [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c13-s33-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c13-s33-i]]100. [part0012.html#c13-s34-e] That is, whether one can accept the notion thatthere existed a first motion, preceding all other motion. Benvenuto (comm. tovv. 97–102), after saying that, according to Aristotle’s Physics [VIII.1] motionis eternal, insists that theologians find that it, like the world, has abeginning, and goes on to cite Genesis 1:1: “In the beginning God made theheavens and the earth.” That was the First Mover’s first motion; before thatnothing moved.

[part0012.html#c13-s35-e] And so, rounding off his oratory, Thomasinsists that kingly prudence is to be valued more highly than speculativephilosophy (a position that coincides with that put forth in the Epistle toCangrande [Epist. XIII.40–41], where Dante says that the branch of philosophythat the Comedy embraces is ethics, since the project of the poem is notspeculation, but action). [return to English [part0012.html#c13-s35-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c13-s35-i]]106–108. [part0012.html#c13-s36-e] For Dante (or Thomas) to insist that whatwas said of Solomon earlier (Par. X.114) corresponds to what is said now strainscredulity, and not a little. If Dante had offered something to the effect thatneither Adam nor Christ had to “rise,” since they were made differently from allother mortals (except for Eve, conveniently lost from sight in all discussionsof this passage), since they were directly produced by God, withoutintermediation (a tactic attempted by both the Ottimo [comm. to vv. 103–108] andBenvenuto [comm. to vv. 103–108]), then we might see the problem as resolved.However, the text rather pointedly fails to offer any such limitation.If one examines the commentaries to Paradiso X.114, hardly anyone before thetwentieth century thinks that the reference is to Solomon as king. For one whodid, see Benvenuto (comm. to Par. X.109–114), who says that the phrase meansthat he has “no equal among kings.” Benvenuto, perhaps the most competent readerof poetic text among all the earlier students of Dante, had likely rememberedthe addition found in this later passage, even if he does not refer to it.Scartazzini (comm. to Par. X.114) also makes this point, referring to the laterpassage and interpreting it in Thomas’s way. But this may be said of few othersbefore 1900 (twentieth-century readers of Paradiso X nearly all do look ahead tothis passage). In fact, the biblical text that lies behind both passages (IIIKings 3:12) does not qualify Solomon’s excellence by reference to a “peergroup,” that is, that text represents him as the wisest among all humans, notonly kings. Thus we once again have a sense that the text of Paradiso, incomparison with its predecessors, was left in a relatively unfinished conditionat Dante’s death; he could have handled the issue better when he introduced it.[return to English [part0012.html#c13-s36-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c13-s36-i]]109–111. [part0012.html#c13-s37-e] With the distinction added in the precedingtercet (Dante’s wording almost gives away the fact that no such distinction wasintended in his first utterance on the subject), the protagonist can understandhow Solomon was first among the wise kings without infringing upon the primacyof either Adam (the “first father”) or of Jesus (the “One we love”). [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c13-s37-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c13-s37-i]]112–142. [part0012.html#c13-s38-e] The final thirty-one lines of this canto, atext that has, on the authority of none other than Thomas Aquinas, justestablished Solomon’s kingly wisdom as a defining part of Dante’s theocraticview of the world’s affairs, nonetheless offer a warning to all of us who tendto rush to judgment, whether in relation to matters philosophical ortheological. As we shall see (vv. 133–138), there is an autobiographicalcomponent to this plea.For Dante to have used so much poetic space on so apparently simple, even banal,a topic tells his readers how keenly he felt involved in the problem. Once againwe sense how, as he looks back over his intellectual development from thevantage point of the making of this great work, he realizes how self-centeredsome of his earlier attitudes were (see Hollander [Holl.2003.2]). [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c13-s38-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c13-s38-i]]112–114.

[part0012.html#c13-s39-e] A rush to judgment is, unsurprisingly,condemned. In the last verse, Dante’s genial understanding of the way we humanstend to fall in love with whatever opinion we contrive to form rescues thepassage from banality. If there is one passage in the last four cantos in whichthe voice of Thomas, usually so fully “captured” by the poet and so distinctfrom his own, seems to be indistinguishable from Dante’s, it is found in thesesix lines.

[part0012.html#c13-s43-e] Sabellius and Arius, Christians of the thirdand fourth centuries, respectively. Longfellow characterizes them as follows:“Sabellius was by birth an African, and flourished as Presbyter of Ptolemais, inthe third century. He denied the three persons in the Godhead, maintaining thatthe Son and Holy Ghost were only temporary manifestations of God in creation,redemption, and sanctification, and would finally return to the Father.“Arius was a Presbyter of Alexandria in the fourth century. He believed the Sonto be equal in power with the Father, but of a different essence or nature, adoctrine which gave rise to the famous Heterousian and Homoiousian controversy,that distracted the Church for three hundred years.”Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 59, points out that both of these thinkers wereconfused about the relationships among God’s substance and his persons, andsuggest that Dante may have been led to his thought by a sentence attributed toAthanasius by Alain de Lille (PL CCX.749): “Neque confundentes personas, utSabellius, neque substantiam separantes, ut Arius” (Neither confounding thePersons, as did Sabellius, nor putting asunder His substance, as did Arius).[return to English [part0012.html#c13-s43-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c13-s43-i]]128–129. [part0012.html#c13-s43-e] Sabellius, Arius, and their ilk arecompared to swords in which human faces are reflected in distorted ways; just sowere they to Scripture distorting mirrors of revealed truth. This comparison hasdisturbed many recent readers, to whom it seems either forced or unintelligible.The early commentators, however, were apparently more at ease with it, as thoughthey thought of faces reflected on the irregular surfaces of shiny sword bladesas a matter of course. Lombardi (comm. to these verses) at the close of theeighteenth century loses control of himself when confronting Venturi’scontinuance of that tradition. Swords, he shouts, were metaphorically theinstruments of heretics who mutilated Scripture to make it accord with theirnefarious purposes. For a while his intervention ruled in Italy (at Harvard,Longfellow just mentioned the two interpretations and took no side). ThenScartazzini (comm. to these verses) took Lombardi’s argument apart (e.g., thelanguage in the passage really does speak of mirroring rather than destruction),as did Poletto (comm. to vv. 127–129). Still, the debate continues into our ownday, with the older position holding the edge, but not without challenge.Strangely enough, hardly anyone has turned his attention to the Bible as apotential source, since the reference is to it. (It is not surprising that thesingle exception is Scartazzini [comm. to these vv.], if his two passages in thePsalms [56:5 and 63:4] are not exactly germane.) No one has apparently adducedthe Scriptural passage containing one of the Bible’s surprisingly few referencesto mirrors (as was pointed out by Carolyn Calvert Phipps in a graduate seminaron the Paradiso in 1980): the Epistle of James 1:23–24: “For if any be a hearerof the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in aglass; for he beholds himself, and goes his way, and straightway forgets whatmanner of man he was.” That is not a perfect fit, either, but it does at leastshare the basic context of these verses.Carroll (comm. to vv. 121–128) reminds the reader that Thomas (who is, afterall, the speaker here) had refuted both these heresies (Sabellius on theTrinity, Arius on the nonconsubstantiality of the Son with the Father). SeeSumma contra Gentiles IV.5–8. [return to English [part0012.html#c13-s43-e] /Italian [part0023.html#c13-s43-i]]130–132. [part0012.html#c13-s44-e] We find a shift in the object of Thomas’smeasured scorn, from the schooled (philosophers and theologians) to theunschooled, ordinary folk (Donna Berta e ser Martino), as well as in the subjectin which their misprision functions, from thoughts about the nature of things tothe afterlife of one’s neighbors.

[part0012.html#c13-s45-e] The two examples, in reverse order,reminded John Carroll (comm. to vv. 129–142) of the father and son, Guido andBuonconte da Montefeltro. Guido, according to Dante in Convivio (IV.xxviii.8),was saved, but then was registered as one of the damned in Inferno XXVII, hisstory presented in both texts as a sea voyage; his son, Buonconte, althoughsuffering a cruel death, in his agony spoke the name of Mary, the “rose,” andwas saved (Purg. V). Trucchi (comm. to vv. 139–142) makes the same point, butwith less effect. And see Pézard (Peza.1965.1), ad loc., for an attempt tolocate both the rose and the ship of this passage in Convivio IV.xxvii.7 andIV.xxviii.8.For readers of Convivio, Dante has placed his former writing self among theBerthas and Martins (see verse 139) of the world. Perhaps recognizing ourselvesdescribed in vv. 118–120, we may share that sense. [return to English[part0012.html#c13-s45-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c13-s45-i]]135.

[part0012.html#c13-s47-e] The foolish “donna Berta e ser Martino” remindCarlo Grabher (comm. to vv. 34–142) of what Dante says in Convivio (IV.v.9)about those vile beasts who desire to know what is known only to God. A womannamed Bertha had already enjoyed a role in Dante’s displeasure withless-than-sophisticated writing; see De vulgari eloquentia II.vi.5: “Petrus amatmultum dominam Bertam” (Peter loves Mistress Bertha a lot).

Is not he one who claims to haveknowledge of divine wisdom? Furthermore, the concealed reference to his failedjudgment of such things in Convivio (see the note to vv. 133–138) reads back athim in upsetting ways. Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 112–142) point out that thisentire passage needs to be read in the context of the medieval dispute over thedamnation/salvation of Solomon (see the note to Par. X.109–114). We rememberthat such great figures as Jerome (who thought Solomon was saved) and Augustine(who thought he was not) disagreed over this matter. It is clear that Dante iswilling to risk considerable intellectual capital in the presentation of hiscase for Solomon. Sarolli has done a great deal to explain the choice of theother Old Testament figure, Nathan, for inclusion here (see the note to Par.XII.136). As a “type” of Dante the prophet, he joins Solomon, the overwhelminglyimportant figure among twenty-four “stars” of theological and religiousimportance, as agents of explanation of Dante’s function in his own poem, asprophet, as poet, as supporter of the imperial monarchy.

[part0012.html#c13-s47-e] As a coda to the Solomon theme, present on andoff since Paradiso X.109 and that was almost immediately accompanied by itshallmark, the verb surgere (Par. X.114; X.140; XIII.106), the poet marks theconclusion of that thematic unit with its final presence.

[part0013.html#c14-s01-e] A simile, with the formal markers of the tropesuppressed (e.g., “just as,” “so,” “like”) but with reference to its literarykind embedded in it (similitudine [a hapax, verse 7]), this comparison of thesounds of Thomas’s voice, at the circumference of the smaller circle of saints,and of Beatrice’s, issuing from near Dante at the center of that circle, drawsattention to the mind of its maker, a witness of such celestial phenomena. Themeaning is clear enough, if some have stumbled over the question of how water inthe center of a bowl may be struck (answer: by something falling from above[like the thought that drops into Dante’s mind—see the last part of the note tovv. 7–9]).

[part0013.html#c14-s02-e] The use of the word “vita” to designate the soulof Thomas echoes Paradiso XII.127, describing the living soul (vita) ofBonaventure. See the note to Paradiso IX.7.

[part0013.html#c14-s03-e] Just as the previous canto, in order tointroduce a new group of saved souls, had begun with two instantaneously coupledlinks in a chain of events, the first of which is Thomas’s speaking hisconcluding word (Par. XI.139 and XII.1–3), so now does this one. The utteranceof Beatrice here comes hard upon Thomas’s last word. It is probably notaccidental that the Latinism caso in verse 4 reflects that particular word,cadere. Thomas says “fall” and it “falls” into Dante’s mind that the discoursesof Thomas and Beatrice are similar. That similarity is assumed to be obvious bymost of the commentators, who, at any rate, do not trouble to discuss it.However, it is not finally clear what is meant. Thomas has just finished alongish discourse (Par. XIII.112–142) about the limited capacity of humanknowledge. Beatrice’s nine verses insist on the same thing: She knows what Dantewants to know even before he does. What these two saved souls shareintellectually is the ability common to those who dwell in the Empyrean to knowall that is knowable, and to know it in God (including, clearly, as the nexttercet demonstrates, the future thoughts of mortals before they think them).[return to English [part0013.html#c14-s03-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c14-s03-i]]10–18. [part0013.html#c14-s04-e] These are Beatrice’s first words sinceParadiso X.52–54 (her longest silence since she entered the poem in PurgatorioXXX; she will not speak again until Par. XVII.7, and then only briefly), justbefore Thomas began speaking at X.82. Thomas and Cacciaguida are two of the mostvoluble characters Dante meets in the afterlife. While they speak less than dothe most present and loquacious of the guides, Virgil and Beatrice, not even themore mobile Statius or the presiding figure in the Empyrean, St. Bernard, speaksas much as either of these within their respective heavens. They are allowed topush Beatrice to the periphery of the discourse.Dante, Beatrice says, will want to know two related things. She is addressingher request to all the saints in both the circles (all her pronouns are plural;we shall see that she is addressing all twenty-four of them by the plural cerchi[circles] of verse 23). One of them will step forward to deal with Dante’squestions; if we expect Thomas—we would be excused if we did—we will besurprised.The questions she attributes to Dante are: (1) Will the light that you give offbe yours in eternity? (2) If it will, how will you not be blinded by one anotheronce you get your bodies back (and become all the more resplendent)?

[part0013.html#c14-s07-e] As opposed to the first simile in the canto(see the note to vv. 1–9), this one is fully expressed in the conventional mode,both tenor and vehicle keyed by the expected terms of comparison (Come … così).As circling dancers here on earth sometimes show greater pleasure by moving moreanimatedly and singing, so these twenty-four souls revealed (by moving moreanimatedly and singing) that they were pleased by Beatrice’s request (theyobviously take delight in being able to make others feel more joy).

For the opposite sort of rain, seeInferno VI.7–12. [return to English [part0013.html#c14-s09-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c14-s09-i]]28–29. [part0013.html#c14-s10-e] Lombardi (comm. to vv. 28–32) points out thatnone of the earlier commentators had revealed the plan in the first two lines,which is to set the “one” of the first verse against the “three” of the second,and the “three” of the first against the “one” of the second, thus makingdramatic the relations of the Trinity, one-in-three as well as three-in-one. Healso discusses the significance of the parallel relation between the two “two”sin the lines, representing the human and divine united in the Second Person ofthe Trinity. Porena (comm. to these verses) summarizes what is presented heresuccinctly: “Theological designation of God, who lives and reigns eternally as asingle Substance, two Natures, and three Persons.”It took a bit longer until the palindromatic structure of these verses wasunderstood as reflecting Joachim of Flora’s structure of history, with its threegreat Ages: the first, of the Father; the second, of the Son; the third, of theSpirit.

X.85–87) that he says Dante once made to him: Not only did rhyme neverforce him into saying other than he intended to say, but he was able to makewords in the rhyme position mean other than what they had meant in the work ofprevious poets.See the note to Paradiso 1.13–15 for the use of munus in the Epistle toCangrande. [return to English [part0013.html#c14-s11-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c14-s11-i]]34–36. [part0013.html#c14-s12-e] From the earliest commentators on, forexample, Jacopo della Lana (comm. to verse 34), writers have identified thisunnamed figure as Solomon. In light of Paradiso X.109, which says that his lightwas the most beautiful in his circle, it is difficult not to. However, Francescoda Buti is the first commentator to hesitate to the point of not naming any oneof the twelve in the first circle; perhaps his hesitation, shared by several, aswe shall see, accounts for some of the continuing doubt about the identity ofthis singer. Landino (comm. to this tercet) advocates the candidacy of PeterLombard; we find Vellutello (comm to vv. 34–39) denying that this is he, andjoining those who believe it is Solomon. Both Gabriele (comm. to verse 34) andhis pupil, Daniello (comm. to this tercet) abstain. In more modern times asimilar profile describes the debate, with almost all thinking it is Solomon towhom reference is made. However, Porena’s uneasiness is perhaps instructive(comm. to vv. 34–35). He suggests that Solomon may be here only because he wasseen as the brightest star in his circle in Paradiso X (one would like to askPorena why Dante has so described him if he did not mean anything by theremark). He goes on to wonder why Solomon is never mentioned by name—a worthyquestion. It is also clear that he is a bit concerned by the fleshly activitiesand celebrations of the king. Chiarenza (Chia.2000.1), p. 206, on the otherhand, insists on Solomon’s value, in Dante’s eyes, for his heightened sense ofthe importance of the flesh. She also points out Dante’s practice of not naminghim, but always (Purg. XXX.10, Par. X.109, and here) presenting him as aprivileged member of a group (pp. 206–7), thus looking at the same phenomenonthat makes Porena feel that Dante is uncomfortable with his own treatment ofSolomon, while Chiarenza sees, much more steadily, that he is playing off ourdiscomfort. (For an example of that discomfort, see Carroll’s remarks in thenote to Paradiso XIII.97–102.)It seems clear that this is indeed Solomon, and that Dante values him veryhighly, ranking him even higher than Thomas, both in the description of hisbrightness in Canto X and in choosing him to hold the last and privilegedposition in the heaven of the Sun. If we reflect how surely we expect Thomas toanswer Beatrice’s formulations of Dante’s doubts (let the reader start readingagain at Canto X and come to this canto innocent of both knowledge andinclination: Will not he or she expect Thomas to take command once more?), wecan recapture some of our original surprise at finding not Thomas but Solomonhere. And, as Scartazzini (comm. to verse 34) reminds us (Carroll [comm. to vv.34–60] allows the same point), a passage in Ecclesiastes (3:18–22) revealsSolomon’s skepticism about the destination of the soul after the death of thebody. Carroll’s treatment, unlike Scartazzini’s, goes on to argue that an expertof no less authority than Aquinas asserts (ST I, q. 75, a. 6) that in thispassage Solomon is speaking “in the character of the foolish” about an error ofothers that he states in order to refute. Whether Scartazzini or Carroll isright, it does seem that Dante knows that even in asserting that Solomon wassaved, he was taking on some pretty estimable adversaries (e.g., Augustine); inmaking him an authority on the Trinity and the general resurrection, he has,once again, chosen to live dangerously.

[part0013.html#c14-s12-e] The adjective dia can mean (and it has had bothmeanings in the poem) “divine” or “shining.” We have followed Bosco/Reggio(comm. to vv. 34–35) and many others in believing that here it possesses thelatter meaning.

Tommaseo hears the voice of Beatrice beneath thisverse.

[part0013.html#c14-s12-e] The reference to Gabriel and the Annunciation isa brief, iconographic way to connect this passage to the Song of Solomon, thewedding song of Christ and his Bride (the Church), as it was interpreted bygenerations of Christian exegetes.

[part0013.html#c14-s13-e] Solomon’s hymn, so different in techniquefrom Thomas’s “Scholastic” verses in these cantos, really does seem intended toimitate the warmth and poetic quality of the Canticle of Canticles. He answersDante’s two questions (vv. 37–57: In the rest of time the saved shall shine asbrightly as we do here and now, until, after the general resurrection, therenewed presence of our bodies will make us shine more brightly still; vv.58–60: Indeed, our restored senses, stronger than they are now, will be capableof looking on this even greater brightness). However, he does so by singing whatcan only be regarded as a hymn to the general resurrection, to borrow fromMomigliano (comm. to vv. 28–33), a passage of critical prose that captures, aswell perhaps as any has ever done, the thread uniting this entire canto, acelebration that combines praise of the Trinity and of the Resurrection. In anonly human view, these two moments are registered as the birth and death ofJesus. [return to English [part0013.html#c14-s13-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c14-s13-i]]37–39. [part0013.html#c14-s13-e] Solomon responds to Beatrice’s question onDante’s behalf of all the spirits gathered in the Sun (see vv. 13–15), theanswer to which is “we shall be resplendent eternally.” [return to English[part0013.html#c14-s13-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c14-s13-i]]40–51. [part0013.html#c14-s14-e] For a discussion of previous notice (that ofUmberto Bosco and of Patrick Boyde) of the way in which this passage iscomplementary to Inferno VI.106–111, where Virgil tells Dante that after theLast Judgment and the recovery of their bodies, the sinners will feel more pain,see Gragnolati (Grag.2005.1), pp. 154–57. Solomon’s words clearly state that thereclad soul will have greater powers of sight, and thus, it would follow,greater joy in seeing both the “soldiery of Paradise” and God Himself.For interesting and pertinent remarks about the rhetorical figure chiasmus inthis canto, beginning with its first verse and culminating in Solomon’s speech,in these twelve verses, see Sowell (Sowe.1995.1), pp. 201–5. This trope derivesits name from the Greek character transliterated as chi and expressed as “X”;thus, like the two major elements in the letter “x” (> <), a mirror image, forexample, “apple baby castle … castle baby apple.” Depending on its context, itmay also put the reader in mind of the chiasmus-shaped Cross of Christ, as wellas of the first letter of His name.

[part0013.html#c14-s14-e] In the first of two “interlaced” tercets,Solomon, like Gabriel in verse 35, is modest, more modest than reading him mightprepare us to find. The more grace he and his fellow saints experience, thebetter they see God; the better they see Him, the more they love Him; the morethey love Him, the brighter they will shine. The verses run back down the chainof cause and effect. Compare the tercet at vv. 49–51 for a second example ofthis sort of interlacing. There the order is natural, that is, we move fromseeing to loving to shining. [return to English [part0013.html#c14-s14-e] /Italian [part0023.html#c14-s14-i]]49–51.

[part0013.html#c14-s18-e] In marked contrast to Thomas, who only rarelysounds “poetic” (but see the note to Par. XI.19–21), Solomon here is granted oneof the few similes allowed a speaker in the poem (we have not encountered asimile since the one on Iris in Par. XII.10–21). This further identifies himwith Dante and the world of poetry, eclipsing Thomas at least a little. This isnot to say that Dante does not value Thomas; he values hardly anyone more. Butit is also time for taking some good-natured revenge on the man who labored tobelittle poetry and poets.There are some 628 verses in the heaven of the Sun, nearly half of them (287)spoken by Thomas, poetry’s confirmed enemy. Further, Dante is silent in all ofthis heaven, as though to match Thomas by opposition, switching roles with him.This is the only “zone” of the entire poem in which the protagonist does not saya single word.

[part0013.html#c14-s20-e] Solomon concludes by responding to Beatrice’srepresentation of Dante’s second question (see vv. 16–18). The glorified bodywill not be too strongly bright for the eyes of the saved, perhaps because theirown resurrected bodies will possess capacities their earthly ones did not, inthis case superhuman eyesight. Dante’s question was based solely on a normalhuman understanding of immortality, that is, on ignorance. [return to English[part0013.html#c14-s20-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c14-s20-i]]61–66. [part0013.html#c14-s21-e] The twenty-four souls in the first twocircles, moved by Solomon’s words, show their desire to put on their resurrectedflesh, and perhaps for the same result for all those other saved souls whom theylove.The reader who believes that Dante is not sympathetic to our physical selveswill have to acknowledge that this passage establishes his credibility as ahuman being who, like Solomon, accepts the fact of our corporeal existence andfinds it good. For Dante’s view of the resurrected body, see Jacoff(Jaco.2000.1). See also Bynum (Bynu.1995.1), pp. 291–305. And see Picone(Pico.2002.4), pp. 212–13, n. 21, for a bibliography of some Europeancontributions on this subject. [return to English [part0013.html#c14-s21-e] /Italian [part0023.html#c14-s21-i]]62. [part0013.html#c14-s21-e] The Hebrew word “amen” is given here in itsTuscan form, amme, as part of Dante’s program of expressing sacred truth in thelow vernacular. See the note to verse 64.

Such usage of the low-vernacular “mommies” is atone with the context, a soft-hued family portrait of saved humanity, as it were.Our translation deploys the less disturbing “mothers” because of its pairingwith padri (rather than babbi, “daddies”).

[part0013.html#c14-s23-e] This supercharged passage has begun to beunderstood only in the past 101 years. An undergraduate student, Randy Mamiaro(Princeton ’80), caused a stir in class when (in December 1979) he suggestedthat this third circle, tacitly parallel in number with the first two, containedthe twelve apostles, who manifested themselves here as a sign of their approvalof Solomon’s words. Were not the apostles closely associated with the HolySpirit, referred to in verse 76, represented as descending on them with the giftof tongues (Acts 2:3–4)? And would not they represent a fitting final group oftwelve to accompany the first two that have come forward? Mamiaro’s might stillbe a promising hypothesis, had not Peter Dronke in an article (Dron.1975.2, esp.pp. 10–16) shown convincingly that what Dante has built into his poem is ahighly structured reference to Joachim of Flora’s “Third Age,” “the Age of the[Holy] Spirit,” when the Church shall be taken up and each Christian living inthe Spirit will be his or her own priest (and thus the numerically unspecifiedmultitude of these many souls [a problem not well dealt with by Mamiaro’shypothesis]). Consequently, the first two circles in the Sun probably arerelated to Joachim’s Age of the Father and Age of the Son, respectively.Dronke’s thesis should have found more favor than it has. But see Picone(Pico.2002.4), p. 211, and Merlante and Prandi (Merl.2005.1), in notes to vv. 28and 76–78, acknowledging his contribution. How often in Dante studies can onesay that a new reading has completely altered our sense not only of the meaningof a text, but of its intellectual provenance as well? However, Dronke’sdiscovery (he gives credit, for a first effort in this direction, to LeoneTondelli [Tond.1940.1, pp. 260–62]), had in fact been made by another, somethree score and ten years earlier, John S. Carroll (comm. to these verses). (AndCarroll, as far as one can see, has been omitted from the post-Dronkediscussion.) In a long gloss, a portion of which follows, Carroll makes hiscase: “Now, it seems to me clear that Dante in this third circle wished to showhow far his sympathy with these Joachimite views went. In general, he acceptsthe doctrine of a third era of the Holy Spirit. If we take the three circles tocorrespond to the Trinity, we may say that the first, the Dominican, representsthe Father, the reign of law and fear; and the second, the Franciscan, the Son,the favour of the grace of Christ, whose image St. Francis bore. But Dantebelieves that these two types do not exhaust the possibilities of Theology.Joachim and his followers were not mistaken in their hope of a third era worthyto be called, in comparison with the others, the ‘true sparkling of the HolySpirit,’ far wider in its range, far more brilliant in its shining. Dante cannotdescribe it definitely; it lies far off on the dim horizon of the future. It hasthe mystery of the evening when the stars are scarcely seen, for it is thepassing away of one era. It has the mystery of the morning when the dawnwhitens, for it is the beginning of a new day of the Spirit—perhaps the eternalday itself.” John Saly (Saly.1989.1), pp. 14–15, also sees this third circle ofsouls as signifying Joachim’s Third Age, but seems unaware of his precursors inthis belief.The only problem inherent in the Carroll/Dronke hypothesis is that, while thesouls in the first two circles have all finished their lives on earth andassumed their seats in the Empyrean, those in Joachim’s prophetic text have not.On the other hand, there is no reason to believe that Dante thought Joachim’sThird Age had begun yet. Thus his text, like Joachim’s, is prophetic, andJoachim is not the only presence in the poem “di spirito profetico dotato”(endowed with the spirit of prophecy—Par. XII.141). Further, the imprecisenature of their number and the fact that they are not recognizable to Danteaccords with their status as the unnumbered and unnamed ranks of a Joachite NewAge. Singleton (comm. to vv. 74–76) correctly notes that “the context and simileclearly suggest that they are a multitude and not merely twelve lights.” [returnto English [part0013.html#c14-s23-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c14-s23-i]]67. [part0013.html#c14-s23-e] Bosco/Reggio point out (comm. to this verse)that, as usual, the phrasing “Ed ecco” (And lo) alerts the reader to a change infocus. We might expect, as a result, a change of venue, that is, the ascent to ahigher sphere.

Tommaseo is quite sure, however, thateven that last use of the word refers to angels. Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 70–75)was perhaps the first reader to identify the sussistenze as “the blessed soulsin this third circle.” [return to English [part0013.html#c14-s25-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c14-s25-i]]76–81. [part0013.html#c14-s26-e] If Dante is unable to look upon the workingof the Holy Spirit, evident in the movements of this circle, he can fix his eyeson Beatrice’s smile—if he cannot bring that back to mind, for her increasedbeauty is beyond the capacity of his memory.While one can understand the theological reasons that make it imperative torealize that Beatrice becomes more beautiful both as she gets closer to God andas Dante’s capacity to perceive her true nature improves, had the poet stintedon the number of occasions he informs us of their reciprocal progress, thelikelihood is that few of us would have complained.

[part0013.html#c14-s28-e] This is Dante’s only use in his poem of theLatinism translato (in this context, literally “carried up to”). See Sowell(Sowe.1995.1), p. 201, for the recognition of a biblical precursor. Paul speaksof God’s having snatched us from the power of darkness and translated us to HisSon’s kingdom, where we will dwell in light (Colossians 1:13).

[part0013.html#c14-s29-e] That Mars is the “red planet” is an ancienttradition.

[part0013.html#c14-s30-e] If the ascent to Mars is not particularlynoteworthy, the description of Dante’s prayer of thanksgiving most certainly is.There are nine occurrences of hapax in these nine verses (olocausto, essausto,litare, accetto, fausto, lucore, robbi, Elïòs, addobbi), a sure sign ofheightened emotion. And the passage concludes with Dante’s first spoken wordssince Canto X (verse 81), as Barolini (Baro.1992.1), p. 334, n. 8, has observed.Language, as we shall see, is a continuing concern as we move through thisentire sphere. Those who like to find Dante’s identification of the sevenliberal arts with the planets in the Convivio (II.xiii.8–30) at work in Paradisomust here justify the prior identification of Mars with music (Conv.II.xiii.20), a relationship in Paradiso perhaps more plausibly adduced from thesphere of the Sun.

[part0013.html#c14-s30-e] Portirelli (comm. to vv. 88–96) interprets thephrase “that tongue which is the same for all” as meaning “the inner feelings ofthe mind, the same in all languages,” a view that had been widely embraced asearly as the fourteenth century. Dante is evidently referring to mentalconstructions, preverbal thoughts, which match one another perfectly until theyare put into expression in various languages, when they may have smallresemblance to one another. See John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 88–90):“Conceptus mentis sunt idem in omnibus hominibus, loquela vero non sic” (Mentalconstructs are identical in all humans, but not the words [that are used toexpress them]). Dante is perhaps suggesting that there exists an ideal universalvernacular innate in all of us. See the note to Paradiso XV.39.

For such sacrifice recorded in the OldTestament, most memorably in Abraham’s eventually jettisoned intention to make aburnt offering of his son Isaac, see Genesis 22:2, 22:7, 22:8, 22:13. See theprior reference in Paradiso V.29.Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 88–90), the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 88–89), andPietro Alighieri (comm. to vv. 85–90) all say that “olocausto” involvessacrifice of the whole object, while “sacrificio” involves only a part of it.[return to English [part0013.html#c14-s30-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c14-s30-i]]94.

[part0013.html#c14-s32-e] For the meaning of Elïòs, Torraca (comm. to vv.94–96) may have been the first to cite Toynbee (Toyn.1902.1), p. 112, forDante’s dependence on Uguccione da Pisa: “Ab ely, quod est deus, dictus est solelyos, quod pro deo olim reputabatur” (From ely, which means “God,” the sun,which once was considered God, is called elyos). The protagonist may here bepresented as speaking in tongues, or at least a mixture of two biblicallanguages. His first word in particular, the name of God, reflects Hebrew (Eli[see Purg. XXIII.74]) and Greek (Helios).The verb addobbare (a hapax in the poem, probably meaning “to adorn”) isgenerally understood to refer to the wearing of ornamental clothing, since itusually refers to a person as being adorned, with the range of the verb’smeaning here being extended to light. However, a persistent temptation in thecommentaries is to see the verb as reflecting the French verb adober (English“dub”), as in striking a knight on the shoulder with a sword as part of theceremony that reflects his worthiness. See Giacalone (comm. to verse 96).[return to English [part0013.html#c14-s32-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c14-s32-i]]97–102. [part0013.html#c14-s33-e] The first simile in the heaven of Marscompares the small, nearly invisible stars that make up the Milky Way (laGalassia) to the souls who make up the cross of Mars (for Dante’s learneddiscussion of the conflicting theories accounting for the existence of thiscelestial phenomenon, see Convivio II.xiv.5–8). Again, those who want to arguefor a correspondence between Convivio’s alignment of the human arts and scienceswith the heavens of Paradiso face a large (insurmountable?) problem. In Convivio(II.xiv.5), Dante associates la Galassia with metaphysics. Here it is associatedneither with the Sun (which may have created it) nor with the Fixed Stars (whereDante locates it in Convivio) but with Mars, associated with music in Convivio(see the end of the note to vv. 88–96).

[part0013.html#c14-s34-e] Mars seems previously to have had both negativeand positive associations for Dante (see Conv. II.xiii.20–24), if not the samepositive ones that we find in the Commedia; in the earlier work Mars isassociated with musical harmony as well as the destructiveness of war. In theCommedia, as the pagan god of war (e.g., Inf. XXIV.145; Inf. XXXI.51; Purg.XII.31), he is hardly praised. In his second aspect, he is sanitized (as heintrinsically is here) as the representative of the Christian warrior. C. S.Lewis (Lewi. 1964.1), p. 106, pegs Dante’s positive sense of the pagan god tothe term martire (martyr), as derivative of “Mars.” [return to English[part0013.html#c14-s34-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c14-s34-i]]103–108. [part0013.html#c14-s35-e] These tercets contain the second set (offour) triple identical rhymes on Cristo found in the poem (for the first, seePar. XII.71–75; also see the note to that passage).Beginning with the notice of the fact that the Cristo-rhymes in Cantos XIV andXIX of the Paradiso appear in exactly the same lines (104, 106, and 108), ThomasHart performs a series of calculations to demonstrate that Dante had employedratios used to calculate the circumference of a circle to predetermine theprecise locations in the poem of all four of these rhymes; these ratios in turnsuggest the quadrants of a circumscribed Greek cross (formed by two diameters atright angles to one another). For more on the question of Dante’s numericalcomposition, see Hart’s various studies, as referred to in what may serve as asort of compendium of them (Hart.1995.1).

[part0013.html#c14-s35-e] The ineffability of what the narrator has seenwill become increasingly a theme of the poem as it nears its (ineffable) visionof God. His poetic ability (and here ingegno clearly refers to Dante’s art, notGod’s [see the note to Inf. II.7–9]) is simply not able to represent adequatelythe amazing things that he is indeed capable of holding in mind. By the end ofthe poem he will not be able to do that, either. [return to English[part0013.html#c14-s35-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c14-s35-i]]106. [part0013.html#c14-s36-e] Dante’s phrasing follows closely the words ofChrist in Matthew 16:24: “Let him who wishes to follow me deny himself and takeup his cross and follow me” (see Jacopo della Lana [comm. to vv. 106–108] andmany others). [return to English [part0013.html#c14-s36-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c14-s36-i]]108. [part0013.html#c14-s36-e] See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse) for asummary of the debate over this line. We have followed them in thinking thegerund vedendo describes Dante, and not the Christian soldier he is addressingindirectly. One of the main justifications for their argument is the fact thatno soul on its way to God should come by this route (we are allowed to assumethat all go directly to the Empyrean). Further, and perhaps more tellingly, thiscross of Christian soldiers will no longer be here, since all who appear in allthe spheres are there only temporarily, for the sake of Dante’s education. Onthe other hand, the passage does read more readily the “wrong” way. And it wasonly fairly recently that anyone objected to that understanding (e.g., Torraca[comm. to vv. 106–108]), if that objection is both well founded and fairlycommon, especially after Porena’s final note to this canto (found in the DDP athis comm. to vv. 106–108), entitled “una distrazione di Dante.” Is this anotherinstance of the unfinished quality of Dante’s last cantica? See the notes toParadiso III.29–30 and IX.119–123.For the verb balenare (to flash [said of lightning]), Carroll (comm. to vv.103–108) points to Matthew 24:27: “As the lightning comes out of the east, andshines even unto the west, so shall also be the coming of the Son of Man.”Carroll goes on to say that this is the first of three visions of Christ inParadiso, the second occurring in Canto XXIII.28–39, amidst the ChurchTriumphant. The final vision occurs, of course, in the concluding tercets of thepoem. [return to English [part0013.html#c14-s36-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c14-s36-i]]109–117. [part0013.html#c14-s37-e] The first of two consecutive similes, thisone has armies of admirers for its small detail drawn from ordinary daily life,an experience that all have known but never expected to find in an “important”poem, the motes suspended in air irradiated in the streaks of sunlight makingtheir way through shutters. We can almost observe Dante observing them (see thenote to Inf. XXXII.70–72) and wondering how to use them in his poem. The rangeof this poet, his ability to move back and forth between the lofty and thesimple, is perhaps unparalleled. One is content to be counted among hisadmirers.

[part0013.html#c14-s37-e] Singleton (comm. to this verse) reminds us thatin Italian (and, one might add, in Latin) the word corno can refer to the flankof an army.

[part0013.html#c14-s37-e] The rapid movements of the souls along thetwo bands of the cross have certain logistical implications, as we learn fromthese verses, that is, there seems to be more than one file of saints along eachband, since these souls catch up to and pass one another. We remember that inthe preceding heaven, also, the souls, in their circles, were both dancing andsinging as, we are about to learn, those in this new group are also.

Thismelody, like the “hymn” in that earlier passage, leaves Dante (at first) unableto make out its words. Here, however, he almost immediately does make out two ofthem, “Resurgi” and “Vinci” (Arise and Conquer). Landino (comm. to vv. 124–126)points out that these two “Scriptural” words are sung to Christ: “Arise andconquer,” that is, “Arise from death and conquer the devil.” Grandgent (comm. toverse 125) finds a source in the missal for Thursday of Easter Week (a mostappropriate day, since it coincides with the beginning of the poem), thesequence “Resumpta carne resurgit victor die in tertia” (He rose again, havingtaken on once more His flesh, victorious on the third day).For the program of song in the last cantica, see the note to Paradiso XXI.58–60.[return to English [part0013.html#c14-s40-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c14-s40-i]]118–123. [part0013.html#c14-s40-e] The second simile in this set (eighth andlast in the canto) captures the sonorous condition of the souls in Marsaccompanying their rapid movement along the arms of the cross. This is a cantothat is more characterized by simile than perhaps any other. (See Picone[Pico.2002.4], p. 205, who counts nine [including one that may not be consideredformally a simile, if it does involve comparison, at vv. 34–36], differing fromBlasucci [Blas.1991.1], enumerating ten, because he includes the simplecomparison [see the note to Inf. I.22–27] at verse 126.) For bibliography on theDantean simile, see Sowell (Sowe.1983.1) and, for more recent Italian work, seePicone, op. cit., p. 205n., including reference to Pagliaro, “similitudine,” EDV (1976), esp. pp. 254a–257b, and Baldelli, “lingua e stile,” ED VI (1978), esp.pp. 94a–97b.Dante habitually uses similes in profusion at moments of heightened emotional orconceptual challenge, typically when the protagonist experiences stress (e.g.,when he meets Beatrice and is castigated by her in Purg. XXX), or when the poetrequires expanded intellectual powers (e.g., arriving in the Empyrean from thelower heavens in Par. XXX).In Paradiso X.143 we have seen an earlier occurrence of the phrase dolcetintinno in the poem. There it refers to the sound issuing from a distant clocktower, here of two differing stringed instruments playing in harmony. Thepleasure that a listener may take from music without recognizing the tune waslike the pleasure Dante took from hearing the song these souls were singingwithout being able to make out most of its words. [return to English[part0013.html#c14-s40-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c14-s40-i]]127–129. [part0013.html#c14-s43-e] The tercet concludes with a playful butmeaningful identical rhyme: vinci (verb form derived from the Latin nounvinculum [shackles, bond]). Christ conquered death, we conquer by being bound toHim. This is the highest recognition that Dante has yet achieved, based on theexperience of his selfless love of God. [return to English[part0013.html#c14-s43-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c14-s43-i]]130–139. [part0013.html#c14-s44-e] Dante realizes that his reader may objectto his apparent slight of Beatrice. These final ten verses of this extraordinarycanto function as a commentary on the previous tercet (vv. 127–129), detailingDante’s increased love of God. Here is Tozer’s explanation (comm. to vv.133–139) of this convoluted, witty passage: “Dante here justifies himself forhaving said that the melody which he had just heard delighted him more thananything he had hitherto met with in Paradise, by doing which he had assignedthe second place to the joy of seeing Beatrice’s eyes. In order to justifyhimself (Per escusarmi), he accuses himself of not having looked at Beatrice’seyes since his arrival in the Heaven of Mars (l. 135); and his excuse for this(Escusar puommi) is that he was attracted by the delights of that Heaven, whichsurpassed those of the previous Heavens, according to the system of Paradise, inwhich the beauty and joy increase in ascending from sphere to sphere (ll. 133,134). Consequently, what he had said about the delight of the melody of thisHeaven surpassing all previous delights was true, inasmuch as it is reconcilablewith the superior attractions of Beatrice’s eyes, for their beauty had increasedsince the Heaven of Mars had been reached, but Dante was not aware of thisbecause he had not seen them (ll. 138, 139).” Tozer and most other commentatorstake the verb dischiudere, which usually (in the Commedia as well as in Italiangenerally) means something like its English cognate, “to disclose,” to signify,as they argue it also does once earlier (Par. VII.102), “to exclude.” (But fordisagreement with this generally accepted variant meaning in both cases, seeCardellino [Card.2006.1]). Our understanding of most of the literal sense ofthese verses coincides with that of Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 133–139).That the word “here” (qui) refers to the poem is nearly guaranteed by itsdistinction from the “there” (lì) of line 135. (See the similar situationaddressed in the note to Inf. XXIX.54–57.)

[part0013.html#c15-s01-e] Perhaps it is the result of the only necessaryrelative absence of narrative in Paradiso, but the opening passages of many ofits cantos show contorted construction and convoluted phrasing, an authorialself-consciousness that is more present than it had been in the first twocantiche. Narrative has its own excuse for being; theology at least seems torequire justification, perhaps nowhere more so than in a poem. These two tercetsare among those least afflicted, but still are not exactly easy. A possibleparaphrase is: “The will that would perform good deeds and that always revealsitself in well-purposed love (as does evil will in a love of the things of thisworld) silenced the singing that God Himself makes harmonious.” That is, thedancing choir of saints (see Par. XIV.109–123) grew quiet (and ceased moving) inorder to welcome Dante to this heaven and to invite his questions. Their“harmony” is, in Dante’s metaphor, the result of God’s “hand” having tuned the“strings” of the “instrument” that their voices represent.

[part0013.html#c15-s01-e] A question here involves the verb, whether it isa form of liquare (to liquify) or liquere (to make manifest). Most choose thelatter alternative, believing Dante treated the second-conjugation Latin verb asthough it were among those of the first conjugation and also made it reflexive.Since it occupies the rhyme position, thus preparing the reader to grant thepoet a perhaps larger amount of license, it is difficult to fault this view, andwe have followed it in our translation.

After Inferno V, with 10appearances in 68 lines (and two “triplets” at vv. 61–69 and 100–106, occurringin nine and seven lines, respectively), this is one of the densest groupings ofthe word in the poem, with three occurrences in 11 lines.

From the first (e.g., Jacopo della Lana [comm. tovv. 13–18]), commentators have insisted that the celestial phenomena are notfalling stars, but ignited vapors, referring to Aristotle’s Meteora as theirauthority. Beginning with Daniello (comm. to vv. 13–15), later commentators havesought a classical poetic source for this “shooting star” in one of threeplaces: in Ovid (Metam. II.319–322 [Phaeton]) or in Virgil (Georg. I.365–367[stars falling from the skies]) and Aen. II.692–703 (the portentous shootingstar or—more likely—comet that appears to Anchises’ request for an omen ofJupiter’s approval of his flight from Troy). Since the neighboring tercet’scontext (vv. 25–27) aligns Anchises with Cacciaguida, that has seemed to somethe more likely source. However, it is only in Ovid that we find words that seemto be mirrored in Dante’s description of the celestial phenomenon: The star hasnot in fact fallen, if it seemed to have fallen (“etsi non cecidit, potuitcecidisse videri”).

[part0013.html#c15-s08-e] That is, in its approach before its descent,this “star” follows the right angle made by the “arm” and the “stem” of thecross. For Dante’s earlier treatment of the cross of Mars, see ConvivioII.xiii.22: “This is also why in Florence, at the beginning of its ruin, therewas seen in the sky in the shape of a cross a great quantity of these vaporswhich accompany the star of Mars” (tr. R. Lansing).The apsidal chapel dedicated to the local martyr of Ravenna, St. Apollonaris, inthe church dedicated to his memory, S. Apollinare in Classe, displays over thealtar a mosaic cross that has jewels depicted as being embedded in it, withChrist’s face as the central jewel, located at the transverse of its twoelements. Is it possible that Dante was thinking of that particular cross? We donot know whether he visited Ravenna before he moved there, circa 1317–19, norwhen he composed these cantos (but see the last paragraph of the note to Par.IX.29–30, reporting on the possibility that that canto reflected the pressure ofthe recent past, the years 1314–15). Petrocchi’s dating of the composition ofthe last cantica would have it begun circa 1317. And so it is at least possiblethat the greater portion of Paradiso was composed in Ravenna. At any rate,Jeffrey Schnapp (Schn.1986.1), pp. 171–203, offers detailed arguments thatlocate various architectural features of Ravenna in the texts of the centralcantos of Paradiso, including the mosaic found in this chapel, with its jeweledcross (pp. 180–85).

[part0013.html#c15-s08-e] Alabaster is a creamy white stone, softlytranslucent, so that it could, when hollowed in such a way as to contain wax anda wick, be used as a light (particularly for votive purposes). Dante goesexisting technology one better, imagining the cross of Mars as hollow andsomehow having moving lights within that space.

Itself representing paternal affection, it is perhapsthe most obvious and filial affection shown by the poet to his poetic father,Virgil, since he left the poem in the earthly paradise (Purg. XXX). See AeneidVI.684–686, a description of the shade of Anchises welcoming his living son tothe Elysian Fields. (See the note to Purgatorio II.79–81.) What exactly we areto make of the reference is a matter of some dispute and more than a littlecomplexity.Surprisingly, this may be the first obvious citation of Virgil’s text (Aen.VI.684–686) in quite some time and it is surely the most vibrant one so far inParadiso. While there have been several at least generally Virgiliancontaminations, this is the first pellucidly precise one since Paradiso VIII.9.Before that, the last great Virgilian flowering occurred in Purgatorio XXX (vv.21, 48, 49–51, 52, 59–60—see Hollander [Holl.1993.1], pp. 317–18). From thebeginning of the Paradiso it may have seemed that Virgil had been left behind asthe main classical source in favor of Ovid (see the last paragraph of the noteto Par. I.68). For discussion see Hollander (Holl.1983.1), pp. 134–35. [returnto English [part0013.html#c15-s09-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s09-i]]26. [part0013.html#c15-s09-e] It is a commonplace in the commentaries to saythat “musa” here means “poet.” See, among others, Pietro di Dante (Pietro1,comm. to vv. 25–27): “qui major musa, idest poeta, latinorum est” (who was thegreatest muse, that is, poet, among the Romans). And see Convivio IV.xxvi.8,where Dante refers to Virgil as “lo maggiore nostro poeta,” and MonarchiaII.iii.6, where the Latin master is “divinus poeta noster Virgilius.” However,Bosco/Reggio (comm. to Par. XVIII.33) offer strong reasons for taking musa tomean the text of the Aeneid rather than its author.The first commentator apparently even to sense the possible condescension towardVirgil in this verse was Steiner (comm. to vv. 26–27), who attempts to downplayits significance. That it took seven hundred years for a reader to say that thiscompliment might even seem to be backhanded is, one might say, remarkable. Dantecould easily have avoided introducing this concern about how much faith weshould give to Virgil’s poem as a record of event. Merely to lodge the doubt isenough to identify Dante’s motive, which is to call into question Virgil’s finalauthority when faced with the certainties of the world of Revelation, in whichthe protagonist now finds himself. (Of course, we can turn the same questionback onto Dante, whose poem also may not merit our belief, either; it is adangerous game that he has chosen to play. And he knows that.) Mattalia (comm.to verse 26) is a good deal more firm than Steiner and sees the point of Dante’sinsistence on the fictitious nature of Virgil’s account, but goes on to claimthat Dante believed in the historicity of the events he narrates (a difficultposition to accept as soon as one asks the inevitable question, “Do the eventsnarrated as taking place in the Elysian Fields have any verifiable realityoutside of Virgil’s text?”). The firmest sense of the failing being lodgedagainst Virgil found in contemporary commentaries is perhaps that of Singleton(comm. to verse 26), sending the reader to his comment on Inferno II.13. And seethe note to Inferno II.28, above. Nonetheless, the first clear statement of theproblematic aspects of these dubiety-creating references to the Aeneid isprobably Grandgent’s (comm. to Inf. II, intro. note): “It is worth noting thatin introducing the example of Aeneas, Dante begins with ‘tu dici che …,’ and afew lines further on he uses the phrase ‘questa andata onde gli dai tu vanto’;so in Par. XV, 26, referring to the same episode, he adds ‘se fede merta nostramaggior Musa,’ meaning Virgil. These expressions seem to imply a mentalreservation with regard to the literal veracity of Aeneas’s adventure.” And seeHollander (Holl.1983.1), pp. 135–36. [return to English[part0013.html#c15-s09-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s09-i]]28–30. [part0013.html#c15-s10-e] This is the only tercet in the poem entirelyin Latin: “O blood of mine, O grace of God poured down from above, to whom, asto you, shall the gates of heaven ever been opened twice.” Indeed, only St. Paulis, alongside of Dante, in such glorious company, as far as we (or Dante) canknow.While it has pronouncedly Virgilian and biblical elements, the tercet is alsoDante’s brief answer to an unspoken challenge (until Giovanni del Virgilio,around 1320, had the dubious taste to offer him a chance at the laurel fromBologna in exchange for a truly worthy poem, a political one cast, more noblythan was this lowly Comedy, in Latin [see the note to Par. IX.29–30]). Heundoubtedly earlier had come into contact with others who thought that he shouldhave eschewed the vernacular to write his poem in Latin, in the tradition ofclassical poetry. That, after all, is what Albertino Mussato had done.For an overview of the situation of Latin writing in relation to the formationand development of the European vernaculars, see Marc Van Uytfanghe(Vanu.2003.1).The Virgilian elements in the tercet include the words sanguis meus, widelyrecognized as a citation of Aen. VI.835. Anchises is addressing Julius Caesarand asking him to cast away his sword (rather than put it to use in bloody civilwar): “proice tela manu, sanguis meus!” That speech ends with Anchises’ fervidhope that Rome will spare the defeated and bring down the prideful (Aen. VI.853:“parcere subiectis et debellare superbos”). If that was her mission, Virgilknows how badly she failed in it. But there is a much less frequently citedpossible second citation, in verse 30, a reference to the Sibyl’s admonition; ifAeneas is so eager for his perilous journey, she will guide him. She expressesthe danger awaiting him in two examples of passage into the land of the dead andback (Aen. VI.134–135), twice crossing the Styx, twice seeing black Tartarus(bis Stygios innare lacus, bis nigra videre / Tartara). It can certainly beargued that what Dante has done here is to take the fairly glum passage inVirgil and brighten the context considerably, the futile challenge to civildiscord in Rome become the crusader’s welcome to his “son,” Aeneas’s journeythrough Hell become this son’s unique voyage to salvation.That Cacciaguida’s first words are in Latin, both biblical (at leastgenerically) and Virgilian, accomplishes one of Dante’s aims. It establishes hisancestor as speaker of the doubly significant “grammatical” tongue, that of Godand man, Church and empire. As Dante’s spiritual and fleshly father, he isperfectly fitted to meet his son’s needs. [return to English[part0013.html#c15-s10-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s10-i]]28. [part0013.html#c15-s10-e] Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 66, points out thatthe protagonist has himself once used sangue in this precise sense (i.e., todenote bloodline), referring to Geri del Bello (Inf. XXIX.20). And now hisancestor uses the word, in Latin, to identify Dante as his seed. [return toEnglish [part0013.html#c15-s10-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s10-i]]29. [part0013.html#c15-s10-e] Some readers have reflected that this versewould seem to put Dante in a class by himself, since Paul claims (II Corinthians12:2) a celestial ascent only as far as the third heaven. But see the note toParadiso I.73 for notice that traditional understanding of the passageidentified Paul’s “third heaven” with the Empyrean.

[part0013.html#c15-s10-e] Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 28–30) says that this,Dante’s first visit to the realms of Paradise, is made in the flesh, while thenext one will not be (i.e., Dante’s soul will fly up without his body after hisdeath). Of course, he is destined to get that body back at the generalresur-rection. [return to English [part0013.html#c15-s10-e] / Italian[part0024.html#c15-s10-i]]31. [part0013.html#c15-s11-e] While this “light” does not choose to identifyhimself until verse 135, it is perhaps good to have some sense of Dante’sgreat-great-grandfather, who is speaking in this scene, “of whose life nothingis known beyond what Dante himself tells us; viz. that he was born in Florence(Par. XV.130–133) in the Sesto di Porta san Piero (Par. XVI.40–42) about theyear 1090 (Par. XVI.34–39); that he belonged (possibly) to the Elisei, one ofthe old Florentine families which boasted Roman descent (Par. XV.136; Par.XVI.40); that he was baptized in the baptistery of San Giovanni in Florence(Par. XV.134–135); that he had two brothers, Moronto and Eliseo (Par. XV.136);that his wife came from the valley of the Po, and that from her, through hisson, Dante got his surname of Alighieri (Par. XV.91–94, Par. XV.137–138); thathe followed the Emperor Conrad III on the Second Crusade, and was knighted byhim (Par. XV.139–144), and finally that he fell fighting against the infidelabout the year 1147 (Par. XV.145–148)” (T). [return to English[part0013.html#c15-s11-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s11-i]]32–33. [part0013.html#c15-s11-e] The protagonist makes up for his previous“failure” to look at Beatrice in the last canto (XIV.127–132).Aversano claims that stupefaction is experienced only twice in the Bible, bothtimes in the responses of those who beheld Christ, citing Mark 9:14 (regardingthe populace after the Transfiguration) and Acts 9:6–7 (regarding those whowitness what is to them strange behavior on the part of Saul on the road toDamascus). But see also Acts 2:7–12, which perhaps contains a more relevantcontext than those two passages. After the apostles found they were able to“translate” words spoken in tongues into their own language, they were amazed.This is the first use of the word stupefatto in the poem. It will twice be usedagain (Par. XXVI.80 and Par. XXXI.35). On the last of these it will refer to thereaction of the pilgrim approaching Rome who sees the city for the first time.[return to English [part0013.html#c15-s11-e] / Italian[part0024.html#c15-s11-i]]34–36. [part0013.html#c15-s12-e] Beatrice’s smile recognizes that Dante hasunderstood his identity better than ever before, biologically, but moreimportant in terms of his family’s heritage, and, still more important, as“Roman” and as Christian, assured of his salvation. [return to English[part0013.html#c15-s12-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s12-i]]37–42. [part0013.html#c15-s13-e] This is Cacciaguida’s second kind of speech,one that the protagonist is unable to understand. For some reason André Pézard(Peza.1967.1) does not include this passage in his consideration of the“tongues” spoken by Cacciaguida (he deals with items 1, 3, and 4 in the listingbelow). This list is found in Hollander (Holl.1980.2), pp. 125–27 (for somefurther consideration, see Hollander [Holl.1992.1], pp. 38–39, n. 57). However,it seems clear that the reader must consider four languages as spoken byCacciaguida: (1) vv. 28–30, Latin; (2) 37–42, speech that the protagonist couldnot recognize; (3) vv. 47–48, the Italian of Dante’s time; (4) ParadisoXVI.34–36, the vernacular of Cacciaguida’s day. For support for this view, seeHoness (Hone.1997.1), p. 130. [return to English [part0013.html#c15-s13-e] /Italian [part0024.html#c15-s13-i]]39. [part0013.html#c15-s13-e] Poletto (comm. to vv. 37–39) seems to have beenthe first commentator to notice the closeness of this line to the tenth verse ofthe last poem of the Vita nuova (XLI.12): “io non lo intendo, sì parla sottile”(I cannot understand the subtle words it [his pilgrim spirit, having visitedParadise and seen Beatrice] speaks [tr. M. Musa]). Benvenuto explains (comm. tovv. 37–42) that Cacciaguida was speaking of pure mental constructs (conceptionesmentales) that transcend mere humans’ ability to understand. (See the note toPar. XIV.88.) On the other hand, Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 37–48) andCristoforo Landino (comm. to vv. 37–39) both think the context of his firstwords in Latin, regarding Dante’s status as one of the elect (vv. 28–30), pointto the issue of predestination, a position that Sapegno (comm. to vv. 37–42)brings back into consideration, as several others do also. Hollander(Holl.1980.2) is of the opinion that this linguistic behavior on the part ofDante’s ancestor may reflect either Adamic vernacular or the apostles’ speakingin tongues. There is, in short, no consensus about how to read this verse. Butsee the note to vv. 43–48. [return to English [part0013.html#c15-s13-e] /Italian [part0024.html#c15-s13-i]]40–42. [part0013.html#c15-s14-e] Benvenuto’s hypothesis (see the note to verse39) concerning “mental constructs” would seem to be certified by these lines,which tell us that Cacciaguida was not trying to hide his words from Dante butthat the language he employed simply overshot its human target, that is,Cacciaguida had momentarily forgotten that Dante was not yet “immortal,” that,in other words, his intelligence still was limited by his humanity.The word concetto represents an important element in Dante’s vocabulary ofconsciousness. Used as a singular noun for the first time in Inferno XXXII.4(where it refers to the mental construct Dante has in his brain of the lowestlandscape of Hell), it does not reappear until here (for the rest of its“career” in the poem, see the note to Par. XXXIII.127). [return to English[part0013.html#c15-s14-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s14-i]]43–48. [part0013.html#c15-s15-e] These six lines perhaps offer someclarification of the nature of Cacciaguida’s ununderstandable utterance (vv.37–42). First, he seems to have been addressing God, and certainly not Dante;second, if the words he speaks now flow from the ones he uttered then, they,too, were words of thanksgiving for God’s grace to his descendant.

[part0013.html#c15-s16-e] This is the last appearance in the poem of theadjective cortese (literally “courtly” [i.e., of the court], and hence“courteous” [i.e., behaving as a courtier does—or should do]). It transforms theusual sense of the word, which often associates it with “courtly love,” intoheavenly affection, a rather pronounced Nietzschean “transvaluation of values.”Dante had already availed himself of a similar strategic displacement at the endof the Vita nuova, when he refers to God as the “sire de la cortesia” (the Lordof graciousness [tr. M. Musa]). [return to English [part0013.html#c15-s16-e] /Italian [part0024.html#c15-s16-i]]50. [part0013.html#c15-s17-e] For volume, see the note to Paradiso XII.122. Towhat “volume” does Cacciaguida refer? Where today commentators are unanimous intheir opinion, it is amusing to read Jacopo della Lana on the problem. Accordingto him (comm. to vv. 49–50) and to perhaps one other (the Anonimo Fiorentino[comm. to vv. 49–51]), it is the Aeneid. The Codice Cassinese (comm. to thisverse) is perhaps the first to deliver the standard gloss: the mind of God. Withfew exceptions this is the common opinion during seven hundred years ofcommentatary. Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 49–51) suggests that the reference may alsobe to the Apocalypse (3:3), the Book of Life, in which the names of all thesaved are recorded. Insofar as we are supposed to think of God’s mind ascontaining this book (and, since it contains infinity, it must), we realize thatCacciaguida has read in it Dante’s salvation.

[part0013.html#c15-s17-e] Cacciaguida is using lofty diction to saythat Dante’s arrival has satisfied the long craving he has experienced (dating,we assume, from his arrival in the Empyrean circa 1147) to see his descendant’sarrival in the heavens, about which he read in God’s mind, credit for which hegives to Beatrice.

[part0013.html#c15-s17-e] That is, the words in this “book” areunchanging, unlike those in human manuscripts, where scribes variously blot,erase, add to, and cross out previous texts. Compare Paradiso XVII.37–39. Andsee Torraca (comm. to vv. 49–51) for a reflection of this verse in the openingline of Dante’s first Eclogue to Giovanni del Virgilio: “Vidimus in nigris albopatiente lituris …” (In letters black, upon receptive white, I saw …).

[part0013.html#c15-s18-e] It is not difficult to believe that Dante ishere revisiting a theme dear to him, the ill-fated flight of Icarus (see Inf.XVII.109–111 and XXIX.113–116; Par. VIII.125–126), but now starring Beatrice asa better-artificing Daedalus and Dante as nonfalling wonder boy. See the note toverse 72.

[part0013.html#c15-s19-e] “Cacciaguida tells Dante that he understandsthe reason why he does not inquire his name and the cause of his interest inhim, which is, that he (Dante) is aware that the denizens of Heaven see thethoughts of others through the medium of the mind of God which reflects them inevery detail; and consequently that it is unnecessary for him to state in wordswhat he wishes to be told him, because his wishes are already fully known toCacciaguida. Still, he encourages Dante to speak, because his (Cacciaguida’s)love will be increased by complying with his request” (Tozer, comm. to theseverses).

[part0013.html#c15-s19-e] See Grandgent (comm. to verse 56): “Raia,‘radiates.’ Unity is the beginning of number, as God is the beginning ofthought; from the conception of unity is derived the conception of all numbers,and in the divine mind all thought is contained.” [return to English[part0013.html#c15-s19-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s19-i]]68. [part0013.html#c15-s23-e] Will and desire are the hallmarks of the soul’saffective knowing and wise loving in Paradise. As Tommaseo pointed out long ago(comm. to vv. 67–69), the cantica will conclude with these two spiritualmovements in Dante operating harmoniously (Par. XXXIII.143).

[part0013.html#c15-s24-e] Dante apparently could not resist a secondreference to Beatrice as Daedalus (see the note to verse 54). And see Hollander(Holl.1983.1), p. 135n., pointing out that there seems to be a “Daedalusprogram” in this part of the poem: Paradiso VIII.125, X.74–75, XIII.77–78, andhere, representing, according to him (p. 136n.), something bordering on theobsessive.

[part0013.html#c15-s25-e] This tortured preamble to a simple question(“What’s your name?”) is paraphrased by Tozer (comm. to these verses) asfollows: “Dante here excuses himself for being unable to thank Cacciaguida as hewould wish to do for his benevolence. The ground of his excuse is that, whereasin Heaven a feeling (affetto) is accompanied by an equivalent power of thought(senno), through which that feeling can find expression, this is not the casewith mortal men, for in them the means (argomento) of expressing feeling fallshort of the wish to do so (voglia).” [return to English[part0013.html#c15-s25-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s25-i]]74. [part0013.html#c15-s25-e] The term equalità, a hapax, has considerabletheological weight. Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 68, cites Richard of St. Victor,De Trinitate VI.xxi: “Quid summa aequalitas sit in illa Trinitate, ubi oportetomnes aeque perfectos esse” (What very great equality there must be in thatTrinity, in which it is necessary for all the elements to be equally perfect).Aversano continues by adducing the gloss of Alain de Lille (PL CCX.445) to hisfourth regula theologica: “in Patre unitas, in Figlio [sic] aequalitas, inSpiritu sancto unitatis aequalitatisque connexio” (in the Father, uniqueness; inthe Son, likeness; in the Holy Spirit, the link between uniqueness andlikeness).If one thinks about the “aesthetics” of the Christian religion (and of Dante’spoem), one has a sense of the centrality of both uniqueness and of likeness.This is nowhere more readily apparent than in the Second Person of the Trinity,Jesus Christ, a uniquely human being (because He is also the immortal God) andyet a commonly human being (because He was also mortal). And, it is perhaps fairto suggest, this theme has nowhere before in the poem been quite so evident orso important as it has become in this canto.

[part0013.html#c15-s27-e] The phrase “pennuti in ali” (feathered wings)picks up (from verse 54 [“vestì le piume”] and verse 72 [“crescer l’ali”]) tomake this one of the densest insistences on Dante’s heavenly flight in the poem.See Shankland’s two studies (Shan.1975.1; Shan.1977.1) for discussion of the punon the poet’s surname (Alighieri) available in the Latin adjective for “winged,”aliger.

[part0013.html#c15-s29-e] The protagonist addresses his ancestor as“topaz.” Alain de Lille, cited by Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 68, says that thereare two colors of topaz, sky blue and golden.

Cacciaguida says that he already knowswhat Dante wants to ask but wants him to ask it anyway, to bring him greaterpleasure (vv. 55–69); and then Dante spends nearly as much poetic space (vv.73–84) explaining why he cannot express his gratitude for Cacciaguida’s welcome.That the inquiry about Cacciaguida’s identity took so long to make it fromDante’s lips is, perhaps, amusing, a sort of Scholastic joke, the sort of thingthat would offer Rabelais, two centuries later, endless opportunity for spirited(and antagonistic) amusement at the expense of medieval modes of expression.However, Dante may have felt that the reader (even the fourteenth-centuryreader) may have needed to be reminded of the gulf that separates souls thathave come to God, enjoying an eternal and quasi-angelic spiritual existence, andeven ultimately favored mortals, like Dante Alighieri. When we consider thisaspect of the third cantica, we probably all agree that the poet manages topresent himself as feeling proper humility at finding himself prematurely amongthe blessed, something that is not perhaps as often observed as it might be.

IX.31) of Dante’s family, of which hedeclares himself the root, begins his wider exploration of the history ofFlorence, the subject of some forty verses (88–129). Beginning with Benvenuto(comm. to vv. 88–90), there has been appreciation of the fact that Cacciaguida’swords remember those attributed to God the Father (Matthew 3:17; Mark 1:11; Luke3:22): “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” [return to English[part0013.html#c15-s30-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s30-i]]91–94. [part0013.html#c15-s31-e] Cacciaguida refers to his son Alighiero(Dante’s great-grandfather) as the source of the poet’s surname (sinceAlighiero’s own son, Dante’s grandfather, was known as Bellincione degliAlighieri). Alighiero was perhaps given a Christian name reflecting his mother’smaiden name, Alaghieri (see the note to vv. 137–138). We know from documentaryevidence that he was alive in 1201, which means that Dante was misinformed as tothe date of his death, since the poet has Cacciaguida represent him as havingspent more than one hundred years in Purgatory purging his pridefulness (thereresults a certain family resemblance [see Purg. XIII.136–138]) and the calendarin the poem stands at 1300. [return to English [part0013.html#c15-s31-e] /Italian [part0024.html#c15-s31-i]]95–96. [part0013.html#c15-s32-e] The news of Alighiero’s presence on theterrace of Pride comes with an admonition of Dante’s family duty, to pray forthe deliverance of his soul from torment. There is a parallel moment in Inferno(XXIX.18–36), Dante’s discovery of his ancestor, Geri del Bello, a cousin of hisfather, among the sowers of discord, an apparition that causes him to feelguilty for not having avenged a relative’s violent death. For another similardistribution of a family, consider the case of the Donati (Corso in Hell, Foresein Purgatory, and Piccarda in Heaven [see the note to Purg. XXIII.42–48]; butthere are several other examples as well).See the note to Paradiso I.35–36 for the understanding that the purpose of thepoem is to affect its readers’ prayers.

The two details manageto make the Florentine institution of marriage sound more like sexual bondagethan matrimony. [return to English [part0013.html#c15-s35-e] / Italian[part0024.html#c15-s35-i]]106. [part0013.html#c15-s36-e] The line has caused difficulty. The earlycommentators thought it referred to the thirteenth-century Florentine luxuriousliving in the early Renaissance equivalent of McMansions, showier houses thanfamily life required; later ones believed that Dante was referring to marriagesthat were only for show, allowing the couple to lead dissolute lives.Scartazzini (comm. to this verse), reviewing the dispute, sides with the olderview, because it better accords with the context, which is unnecessary luxury,as the following two lines demonstrate.

[part0013.html#c15-s36-e] “Sardanapalus, last legendary king of theAssyrian empire of Ninus, noted for his luxury, licentiousness, and effeminacy.He spent his days in his palace, unseen by any of his subjects, dressed infemale apparel, and surrounded by concubines. The satrap of Media, havingdetermined to renounce allegiance to such a worthless monarch, rebelled againsthim, and for two years besieged him in Nineveh, until Sardanapalus, unable tohold out any longer, collected all his treasures, wives, and concubines, andplaced them on an immense funeral pile, to which he set fire destroying himselfat the same time” (T). The identity of Dante’s source here is debated; thosemost commonly proposed are Juvenal (Satires X.362), Cicero (Tuscul. V), Justinus(Hist. 1.3), Orosius (Hist. contra paganos I.xix.1), and Aegidius Colonna (Deregimine principum II.xvii), this last favored by Toynbee (in the entry fromwhich the opening passage is cited) because it specifically refers toSardanapalus’s nefariously luxurious activity as being confined to a singleroom.

[part0013.html#c15-s37-e] The thought here is that Florence afterCacciaguida’s day rapidly eclipsed Rome in urban splendor, but its fall fromsupremacy will be even more swift. In synecdoche, Monte Mario and Uccellatoiorepresent Rome and Florence, respectively. Explaining these lines, Carroll hasthis to say (comm. to vv. 97–120): “Montemalo (now Monte Mario) is the hill onthe way from Viterbo from which the splendour of the Eternal City is first seen;and Uccellatoio is the point on the road from Bologna from which the first flashof the greater splendour of Florence breaks on the traveller’s view.” [return toEnglish [part0013.html#c15-s37-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s37-i]]112–113.

He was father of the “good Gualdrada” of InfernoXVI.37. While males, with the exception of the effeminate Sardanapalus and thecorrupt Lapo (see verse 128), are not used to exemplify improper municipalbehavior, they surely are present in the rest of the canto as representatives ofFlorentine virtue.

[part0013.html#c15-s41-e] This vignette from “Scenes from FlorentineFamily Life, ca. 1125,” by Dante Alighieri, features baby talk (see Hollander[Holl.1980.2], p. 127), a phenomenon that Dante is (perhaps surprisingly) mostinterested in. Florentine babies, goo-gooing in their cribs, are represented asteaching their mommies (and daddies, too) to speak in that “idiom.” That word,which first appears here and then will be used only once more in the poem (Par.XXVI.114), where it is used to delineate Adam’s first speech, is unmistakably“vernacular” Hebrew. And thus the word idïoma, here, may offer an insight intoDante’s theory of the history of language: Each infant recapitulates the primallinguistic moment, speaking a version of Adamic vernacular, until, in the pushand pull of maternal and paternal instruction and the infant’s response, thatvernacular takes on a local flavor, in this case Florentine. See Benvenuto(comm. to vv. 121–126): “scilicet, maternum linguagium, scilicet, la ninnananna.” It is perhaps useful to know that Vellutello regularly uses the wordidioma to refer to various Italian vernaculars.

[part0013.html#c15-s42-e] This grandmother narrates for the childrenin the family (but heard by all) the prehistory of Florence, with its roots inTroy, Rome, and Fiesole. Torraca (comm. to vv. 121–126) explains the details,common to many chronicles of the time, as follows: “The Florentines told of theorigins of their city in the following way. After the linguistic division madeas a result of the attempt to construct the tower of Babel, Atlas built thefirst city, which thus fu sola [stood alone] and was therefore called Fiesole.Another of Atlas’s sons, Dardanus, traveling in the East, built Troy there. FromTroy Aeneas came to Italy. One of his descendants founded Rome. The Romansdestroyed Fiesole. Romans and Fiesolans founded Florence.” [return to English[part0013.html#c15-s42-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s42-i]]127–129. [part0013.html#c15-s43-e] Dante alludes to two of his Florentinecontemporaries, first Cianghella, daughter of Arrigo della Tosa. She married aman from Imola, after whose death she returned to her birthplace and behaved insuch fashion as customarily gave widows a very bad name (cf. Boccaccio’sCorbaccio), leading a life marked by lust and luxury. The profile of LapoSalterello sounds a good bit like that of Dante (to what must have been thepoet’s dismay). He was a jurist and poet who, in 1294, represented his city tothe papacy, and was then elected prior of Florence; further, in 1300 hedenounced several of his cocitizens for collaborating with Pope Boniface VIII;in 1302 he, like Dante, was sent into exile (for fomenting discord and forbarratry) by the victorious Black Guelphs. In chiastic order, Cianghella andLapo are compared with two virtuous figures from the era of the Roman republic,Cincinnatus and Cornelia (see Inf. IV.128), the mother of the Gracchi. ForDante’s overwhelming admiration of the Romans of those days, see Hollander andRossi (Holl.1986.1). And for a revisionist (and convincing) analysis of therepublican roots of Dante’s imperialist views, see Armour (Armo.1997.2) [returnto English [part0013.html#c15-s43-e] / Italian [part0024.html#c15-s43-i]]130–148. [part0013.html#c15-s44-e] Cacciaguida’s self-narrative, the longestin Paradiso, nonetheless seems brief when compared to some of the epicautobiographical performances of characters in Inferno, e.g., Ulysses (53lines), Ugolino (72 lines). For discussion of the nature of speeches inParadiso, see the fourth section of the introduction.For a global study of these three canti dedicated to Dante’s ancestor, seeFigurelli (Figu.1965.1).

[part0013.html#c15-s44-e] This terzina repeats a theme that we haveencountered before (the “good old days”), but does so with such emphasis andfluidity (both lines are enjambed, so that the entire tercet has the feeling ofa single line of thought, with four iterations of the adverb così upping theemotional effect), as to leave us in suspense, wondering about the subject andpredicate that it introduces.Dante’s radical notion of the responsibility of the citizen, based on ethicsmore than on politics, may have been shaped by the “radical corporationalism” ofRemigio de’ Girolami; the characterization is that of Ernst Kantorowicz (Kant.1957.1), p. 478, cited by Claire Honess (Hone.1997.2), p. 104. For an overviewof the still underinvestigated question of Remigio’s possible influence onDante, with bibliography (including three important essays in English by CharlesTill Davis), see Ovidio Capitani, “Girolami, Remigio dei,” ED III (1971).[return to English [part0013.html#c15-s44-e] / Italian[part0024.html#c15-s44-i]]133–135. [part0013.html#c15-s45-e] The first three words of the line offersubject, verb, and object: “Mary gave me.” The tercet is based on the moments ofbirth and baptism, the crusader’s mother calling out for the aid of Mary in thepain of parturition and the ceremonial pronouncing of the child’s name at hisbaptism (in the Florentine Baptistery, where Dante himself would also receivehis Christian identity and name); the last word of the tercet, reflecting itsfirst word, also a name (Maria), is Cacciaguida. (He has delayed Dante’sgratification for some time now; Dante asked to know who he was at verse 87.)[return to English [part0013.html#c15-s45-e] / Italian[part0024.html#c15-s45-i]]136. [part0013.html#c15-s46-e] Cacciaguida now names his brothers, Moronto andEliseo, of whom we know absolutely nothing. There has been some dispute over theyears about the exact content of the line and some speculation that Dante meansto associate himself with the great Florentine Ghibelline family, the Elisei,but with no convincing result to the process.

[part0013.html#c15-s46-e] Cacciaguida’s wife came, he says, from thevalley of the Po (over the years, Ferrara remains perhaps the favorite locationamong the discussants, but, since there is a lot at stake [as, for someAmericans, there is with regard to George Washington’s dining and sleepinghabits], the debate goes on). It was from her, he continues, that Dante got hissurname, Alaghieri or Alighieri. Since one of her and Cacciaguida’s sons wasnamed Alighiero, it seems more than likely that he was named for his mother.[return to English [part0013.html#c15-s46-e] / Italian[part0024.html#c15-s46-i]]139–144. [part0013.html#c15-s47-e] He follows the emperor, Conrad III, on the(disastrous) Second Crusade (in 1147) against Islam, against which the popeseven now in Dante’s day fail to take up arms (not even preaching crusade, muchless fighting one). There still remains some debate over the question of whichemperor Dante really means, Conrad II or III. But see Carroll (comm. to vv.130–148): “Some doubt has been thrown on the commonly accepted view that theEmperor whom Cacciaguida followed to the Crusades was Conrad III of Suabia, butwithout reason. Founding on a passage in Villani (IV.9), Cassini suggests ConradII, the Salic, who was Emperor from 1024 to 1039. According to Villani, thisEmperor (whom he calls Conrad I and misdates) visited Florence frequently andknighted many of its citizens. The only crusade he undertook was against theSaracens in Calabria, so that on this view Cacciaguida never was in the HolyLand, and his birth must be pushed back at least a century before the generallyreceived time. It is obviously impossible that he could in that case be thefather of the Alighiero whom he calls his son, who died more than a hundred andsixty years later. There is no reason for giving up the ordinary view that theEmperor referred to is Conrad III, who in 1147, with Louis VII of France,undertook the disastrous Second Crusade, so enthusiastically preached by St.Bernard of Clairvaux. (Bernard’s defence for the failure of this Crusade whichroused all Europe against him is that it was due to the sins of the Crusadersthemselves. They fell as the Israelites fell in the wilderness, and from thesame cause. His remedy is—faith and a third Crusade [De Consideratione, II.1].)”[return to English [part0013.html#c15-s47-e] / Italian[part0024.html#c15-s47-i]]145–148. [part0013.html#c15-s49-e] He died in the Holy Land and came frommartyrdom to this peace (cf. the words for Boethius’s similar journey, Par.X.128–129). While some twentieth-century commentators seem to be open to theidea, no one before Chimenz (comm. to vv. 145–148) states clearly that the textsurely accommodates the view of medieval clergy that those who died on crusadein the Holy Land went straight to Heaven, bypassing Purgatory.Botterill’s entry “Martyrdom” (Lans.2000.1, p. 596) offers reflections onDante’s daring in making Cacciaguida one among the otherwise canonical martyrsof the Church.

[part0013.html#c16-s01-e] Dante, in the course of celebrating his noblebirthright, uses the occasion to condemn any such self-aggrandizing sentiments.The appeal of noble bloodlines is so great, the poet explains, that he tookpride in his ancestry even now in the heavens, where he assuredly should haveknown better. For a meditation on the problematical nature of Dante’s ideasabout nobility, see Borsellino (Bors.1995.1), pp. 39–41.Boethius (Cons. III.6[pr]) proclaims the emptiness of a noble name in a passagealso probably echoed by Dante in Convivio (IV.xx.5). See also Monarchia(II.iii.4), words that sound much like Francesco da Buti’s gloss to theseverses, citing Boethius in distinguishing nobility of soul from “corporeal”nobility (i.e., that established by bloodline).Where at the close of Canto XIV Dante claims that he was not wrong in notpraising Beatrice there, here he states that it was wrong indeed to feel himselfglorified in his ancestry. [return to English [part0013.html#c16-s01-e] /Italian [part0025.html#c16-s01-i]]7–9. [part0013.html#c16-s03-e] This apostrophe of nobility of blood employs ametaphor, in which the mantle (or cloak) of nobility of blood grows shorter eachgeneration that fails to ornament its reputation by earning further genuinehonors (as did Cacciaguida, dying a martyr’s death on crusade). [return toEnglish [part0013.html#c16-s03-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c16-s03-i]]10–12. [part0013.html#c16-s04-e] Dante, finally knowing who it is whom headdresses, used the honorific voi to hail his ancestor, the “You” that was firstgiven to Julius Caesar, according to Lucan (Phars. V.383–386), but is now littleused by the contemporary Romans, descended into a state approaching barbarism inDante’s eyes (see Dve I.xi.2). (Perhaps the first to observe the Lucanian sourcewas Pietro di Dante [comm. to this tercet].) Lucan, prompted by his hatred ofJulius (and of Nero, for whom Julius occasionally stands in), has invented thisparticular in his True History of Authoritarian Language, a fabrication thateventually came to light. According to him, since Julius, assuming his role asdictator, also assumed the many roles of those Romans who had previously heldpositions of responsibility in republican Rome, he needed to be addressed in away that represented the plurality of his roles. Gabriele (comm. to verse 10)was perhaps the first to express some doubt about Lucan’s observation; Lombardispiked it through the heart (comm. to vv. 10–15). The “honorific You” actuallycame into use, explains Scartazzini (comm. to verse 10), only in the thirdcentury. [return to English [part0013.html#c16-s04-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c16-s04-i]]13–15. [part0013.html#c16-s05-e] This tercet returns to a scene that had beenfocal to the pivotal moment in the adulterous passion between Francesca andPaolo in Inferno V, the kiss exchanged by Lancelot and Guinevere in thetwelfth-century Old French prose romance Lancelot du lac. “During [Gallehault’s]residence at King Arthur’s court a warm friendship sprang up between him andLancelot, who confided to him his love for Queen Guenever. The latter, whosecretly loved Lancelot, was easily persuaded by Gallehault to meet the knightprivately. In the course of the interview Gallehault urged the queen to giveLancelot a kiss, which was the beginning of their guilty love.… [Dante here]alludes to the cough given by the Lady of Malehault, one of the queen’scompanions, on perceiving the familiarity between them (she herself being inlove with Lancelot, who was aware of the fact, and was in great anxiety lest itshould injure him with the queen)” (T). Umberto Carpi (Carp.2004.1), vol. I, pp.24–25 and 256, refines the general appreciation of the reference, pointing out(and crediting Pietro Beltrami for the observation leading to his insight) thatGuinevere’s handmaid did not cough when the queen and Lancelot kissed, butbefore that, when she revealed to her admirer that she was aware of his name andof his lofty lineage. Her words cause the lady-in-waiting to cough as a way ofinforming Lancelot that she finally knows his identity and nobility of blood.Thus Beatrice, hearing Dante’s response to his own genealogical distinction, thevoi with which he addresses his ancestor, smiles in knowing response to that.That she does so as a warning against such pride seems clear, even if somecommentators insist on a friendlier, less critical attitude at this height inthe heavens. [return to English [part0013.html#c16-s05-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c16-s05-i]]16–18. [part0013.html#c16-s06-e] The poet again contorts the order of eventsfor his narrative purposes; the words that the protagonist speaks precede,naturally, Beatrice’s reaction to them (vv. 13–15). Indeed, we may realize thatthe preceding terzina (vv. 10–12) also reflects what he has said just now.These three parallel uses of the honorific voi for Cacciaguida, emotive anaphora(see Francesca’s Amor … Amor … Amor in Inf. V.100–106), offer an outpouring ofancestral affection, but more than tinged with vainglory, the sin we sawcorrected on the terrace of Pride in Purgatory.This program (of honorific address uttered by the protagonist) began in InfernoX, with Farinata and Cavalcante. It had one more appearance in the firstcantica, with Brunetto Latini. In Purgatorio, Currado Malaspina, Pope Adrian V,Guinizzelli, and Beatrice all received the respectful voi in salutation. In thisconcluding canticle, Beatrice receives it three times (Par. IV.122–134), andCacciaguida also three times, all in this tercet, in a final “explosion” thatlays it to rest. (See the notes to Inf. X.49–51 and to Purg. XIX.131; also toPar. XXXI.79–90.) [return to English [part0013.html#c16-s06-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c16-s06-i]]16. [part0013.html#c16-s06-e] The protagonist addresses seven beings as“father” in the poem: first of all Virgil, a total of seven times (between Purg.IV.44 and XXIII.13); then God (in the guise of Apollo) in Paradiso I.28;Cacciaguida (here and in Par. XVII.106); St. Benedict (Par. XXII.58); St. Peter(Par. XXIV.62 and XXIV.124); Adam (Par. XXVI.92); and finally St. Bernard (Par.XXXII.100). Dante the poet refers to five others as being his “fathers”:Brunetto Latini (Inf. XV.83); Cato (Purg. I.33); Guido Guinizzelli (Purg.XXVI.97); St. Francis (Par. XI.85); and the Sun (Par. XXII.116).

[part0013.html#c16-s07-e] These “rivers” are, resolved from metaphor, thesources of the protagonist’s pleasure in the knowledge of his lineage and in hiselection to join Cacciaguida among the saved souls here and, eventually, in theEmpyrean.

[part0013.html#c16-s08-e] The protagonist wants to know (1) the root ofhis roots, as it were; (2) about the times in Florence when Cacciaguida was ayouth; (3) the number of inhabitants in the city in those days; and (4) the bestpeople in the city then. His first question is reminiscent of Farinata’s to him(Inf. X.42), “Chi fuor li maggior tui?” (Who were your ancestors?).

[part0013.html#c16-s10-e] This simile, at least from the time ofScartazzini (comm. to vv. 28–33), has been recognized as Ovidian in provenance,reflecting the similar comparison (Metam. VII.79–81) describing Medea’s renewedinfatuation with Jason. It seems odd that, for a description of Cacciaguida’srekindled affection for his great-great-grandson, Dante should resort to Ovid’sdescription of Medea’s reignited passion for the handsome youth who will, as shealmost fully realizes, betray her. (Dante had previously visited a part of thislong passage dedicated to Medea and Jason [VII.1–403] in Par. II.16–18. For the“rewriting” of Ovid involved in that tercet, see the note to Par. II.17–18.)[return to English [part0013.html#c16-s10-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c16-s10-i]]33. [part0013.html#c16-s11-e] What language does Cacciaguida speak? Breakingranks with the vast majority of modern commentators who believe that it istwelfth-century Florentine, Porena (in his second endnote to the canto, found inhis comm. to verse 154 in the DDP) suggests that it is Latin. This solution hadalready been proposed by Daniello (comm. to this verse). It was held in favoruntil Poletto, some 330 years later, perhaps rightly sensing that Dante neverwould have used the terms “dolce” or “soave” to describe Latin as contrastedwith the vernacular, cited Beatrice’s use of Florentine vernacular, as referredto at Inferno II.57, as part of his understanding that the text refers to theItalian spoken in Cacciaguida’s time. Grabher (comm. to vv. 28–33) is firm indenying Daniello’s hypothesis; he favors a reference to Cacciaguida’s use of theFlorentine vernacular. (Grabher also denigrates a second theory, which hadoccasionally been pressed into service after Vellutello introduced it [comm. tovv. 28–33], that Cacciaguida spoke in “the tongues of angels.”) He, likePoletto, is sure that it is best to understand that Dante is concerned here withthe transitory nature of any stage in a vernacular tongue’s development, asreflected in Convivio I.v.9, a concern that led to his promise, in the nextsentence, to take up that matter in De vulgari eloquentia (which he did: see DveI.ix.6).

[part0013.html#c16-s12-e] The Annunciation, occurring on March 25 ofthe first year of Christian history, marked by the words “Ave Maria” inGabriel’s Latin, coincides with the date of the new year as measured byFlorentines in Dante’s age. It is probably not an accident that we are supposedto understand that the poem itself begins on that date in 1300. See the note toInferno I.1.

[part0013.html#c16-s13-e] “ ‘This fire (Mars) came 580 times to itsLion, to be rekindled under its paw.’ Between the Conception—the beginning ofthe year 1—and the birth of Cacciaguida, Mars returned 580 times to theconstellation of Leo, which, being of like disposition to Mars, reinforces theinfluence of that planet. As Mars completes its revolution in 687 days, we shallget the year of Cacciaguida’s birth by multiplying 687 by 580 and dividing by365: 1091. He was therefore 56 when he followed the crusade, having lived from1091 to 1147. Cf. Moore [Moor.1903.1], III, 59–60. G. Federzoni, In quale annonacque Cacciaguida? in Fanfulla della Domenica, 22 Nov. 1914 (XXXVI, no. 39),would adopt a reading tre for trenta, as Pietro Alighieri and some others did,giving fiate three syllables as usual, and thus would get a date 1106 instead of1091” (Grandgent, comm. to vv. 37–39). The variant tre has now mainly beendismissed from the discussion, perhaps as a result of Lombardi’s strongopposition (comm. to vv. 34–39), which even countered the opinion put forward bythe Accademia della Crusca.

[part0013.html#c16-s14-e] Here is John Carroll (comm. to vv. 40–45)clearing up this difficult passage: “The use of the word sesto by Cacciaguidais, strictly speaking, an anachronism. It is proper to a later time when thecity was much larger, was enclosed in a second line of walls, and was dividedinto six wards or sestieri. The smaller city of Cacciaguida’s day lay within thefirst wall, and was divided into four wards—quartieri, formed by a line ofstreets running from the ancient Porta del Duomo on the north to the PonteVecchio on the south, and crossed by another line from east to west, runningthrough the Mercato Vecchio, now demolished to make way for the hideous PiazzaVittorio Emanuele. The quartiere in which the house of his ancestors stood wasthat named after the eastern gate, Porta San Piero. An annual game was run onJune 24, the day of the patron saint of the city [John the Baptist], and, as itscourse was from west to east, this quarter was the last the competitors reached.And what Cacciaguida says is that the house in which he and his forefathers wereborn stood just at the point where the runners entered this last quarter of thecity. This would localize it in the Via degli Speziali which runs off the PiazzaVittorio Emanuele towards the Corso, …” [return to English[part0013.html#c16-s14-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c16-s14-i]]42. [part0013.html#c16-s14-e] Elements in this canto, including the referenceto the annual palio, the race around the inner routes traversing the city,remind some readers of Brunetto Latini (Inf. XV.121–124). As the civic/politicalfigure closest to the center of Inferno, he seems to have a certain similarplacement and function both to Marco Lombardo (Purg. XVI) and to Cacciaguida(Par. XV–XVII). [return to English [part0013.html#c16-s14-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c16-s14-i]]43–45. [part0013.html#c16-s15-e] A series of debates has followed this tercet.Nonetheless, the context offered by the opening of the canto, where theprotagonist is portrayed as glorying in his ancestry and is cautioned byBeatrice’s smile against so doing, perhaps offers us all we need to know tounravel this skein. Cacciaguida will not feed his great-great-grandson’s prideby narrating his heroic noble past, which may be traced back to the Romans. Thisis the sense offered by Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 45), who sensibly go on toexplain that in fact necessity lies behind the author’s reticence: No one knows(or perhaps ever knew) the family history that is supposedly here suppressed inthe service of modesty. [return to English [part0013.html#c16-s15-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c16-s15-i]]46–48. [part0013.html#c16-s16-e] Answering the protagonist’s third question,Cacciaguida leaves us in a quandary because his response is not clear. The malesof “draft age” (as we would say today) in early-twelfth-century Florence were 20percent of (a) the entire population in 1300 or (b) the males of draft age in1300. The Italian would clearly (as our translation suggests) indicate that thefirst is what is meant. [return to English [part0013.html#c16-s16-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c16-s16-i]]47. [part0013.html#c16-s16-e] The phrase “between Mars and the Baptist” is away of describing the confines of the city in Cacciaguida’s day by itsnothernmost and southernmost monuments within the original walls (the Baptistryand the statue of Mars at the Ponte Vecchio). [return to English[part0013.html#c16-s16-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c16-s16-i]]50. [part0013.html#c16-s17-e] These three small towns are today known as CampiBizenzio (the nearest), Figline, and Certaldo (the farthest away from Florence;Boccaccio was born there in 1313). Readers have assumed that, in his choices,Dante expected local readers in the fourteenth century to recognize certainfamilies that had recently arrived from these towns and associated themselveswith nefarious activities.

[part0013.html#c16-s17-e] Cacciaguida is referring to the “unmixed” (i.e.,Roman and pure) blood of the original inhabitants, pure in even the leastartisan and not yet diluted by the bad bloodlines of those descended from theFiesolans—or from those even worse.

[part0013.html#c16-s18-e] Cacciaguida is of the opinion that thequality of urban life would have been much improved had these new folk keptoutside the boundaries north (Trespiano) and south (Galluzzo). However, theyinstead entered the city, bringing with them the “stench” of men like Baldod’Aguglione and Fazio da Signa, both of whom, renegade White Guelphs, wereinvolved in the “exile question” during Dante’s attempts to return to Florenceand both of whom were also opposed to the city’s welcoming Henry VII. In short,each was a personal and political enemy of Dante. [return to English[part0013.html#c16-s18-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c16-s18-i]]58–66. [part0013.html#c16-s20-e] See Tozer’s paraphrase of this passage (comm.to verse 58): “If the clergy had not set themselves in opposition to theImperial power, there would not have been those feuds between the small Italiantowns, which ruined them, and caused their inhabitants to take refuge inFlorence, where they became traders.” For a more developed consideration, alsoin English, of the political situation referred to in these lines, see Carroll’scommentary to them.

[part0013.html#c16-s20-e] There soon results a linguistic “familyresemblance” between the emperor and Dante (see Par. XVII.47), to both of whomthe city behaves like a cruel stepmother (noverca). [return to English[part0013.html#c16-s20-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c16-s20-i]]61–63. [part0013.html#c16-s21-e] Ever since Grandgent (comm. to verse 61,referring to two contemporary Italian sources), there has been a tradition amongcommentators to assign an identity to this exiled family from Semifonte (a townconquered and “colonized” by Florence in 1202), that of Lippo Velluti. One ofthe things that makes this hypothesis especially attractive is that Lippo wasinstrumental in sending Giano della Bella (see vv. 131–132), author of theOrdinamenti di Giustizia (1293), into exile. Dante, like Giano, was a prior ofFlorence and shared with him a noble bloodline (at least Dante may have sensed asimilarity in this regard) as well as a deep distrust of the great noble houses,which abused their powers easily and often. Giano’s Ordinamenti placed severelimits on their ability to do so. While neither Lippo nor Giano is mentioned byname, their antagonistic relationship may help unriddle the references in thispassage as well as in the later one.

[part0013.html#c16-s22-e] Continuing in the same vein, Cacciaguidaargues that the Conti Guidi, the Cerchi, and the Buondelmonti (about whom weshall hear more at the end of this canto) all would have been better off hadthey not become Florentine citizens, staying in their original homes outside thecity.

[part0013.html#c16-s23-e] The mixing of peoples, like overeating, ruinsa city, with the result that it becomes too large and too cumbersome. Itsresulting unwieldiness is compared to that of a bull or of a superfluity ofswords in the hand of a swordsman. This last is perhaps meant to mirror the 500percent growth in Florence’s population referred to in verse 48 (if it was to sogreat an increase that Dante was there referring [see the note to vv. 46–48]).[return to English [part0013.html#c16-s23-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c16-s23-i]]73–81. [part0013.html#c16-s25-e] Two Roman cities, Luni (near Carrara) andUrbisaglia (near Macerata), had fallen into ruins well before Dante’s time andremained in that condition. Two others, Chiusi (near Siena) and Senigallia (nearAncona), seemed to be suffering a similar fate. If cities show such mortaltendencies, reflects Cacciaguida, how much more subject to mortality are merefamilies? This unhappy thought leads toward the death-list of the greatFlorentine families that will occupy much of the rest of the canto.

[part0013.html#c16-s28-e] Introduced by a simile (as the Moon causestidal change that variously inundates and lays bare litoral planes, so thegoddess Fortune does with Florence), Cacciaguida’s task will be the recording ofthe great families who are dying out and whose remembrance is also growingfaint. His purpose is to rescue their fame from “the dark backward and abysm oftime.” [return to English [part0013.html#c16-s28-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c16-s28-i]]88–139. [part0013.html#c16-s30-e] The catalogue of once-great families ofFlorence includes the following, arranged here in groups of five [with thosereferred to by periphrasis in square brackets] and numbering forty: Ughi,Catellini, Filippi, Greci, Ormanni; Alberichi, dell’Arca, della Sannella,Soldanieri, Ardinghi; Bostichi, Ravignani (the noble and ancient family ofBellincion Berti [Par. XV.112], mentioned with the later-arriving Conti Guidiand with those who took their name from the first Bellincione), della Pressa,Galigaio, [Pigli] (“the stripe of fur”); Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifanti, Barucci,Galli; [Chiaramontesi] (“those who blush because of the bushel”), [Donati](“from which the Calfucci sprang”), Sizii, Arrigucci, [Uberti] (“those nowundone by pride”); [Lamberti] (“balls of gold”), [Visdomini] (“the fathers”),[Tosinghi] (“the fathers”), [Adimari] (“the proud and insolent race”),Caponsacchi; Giudi, Infangati, della Pera (the Peruzzi?), the Baron (Hugh ofBrandenburg), Gualterotti; Importuni, [Buondelmonti] (“new neighbors”), [Amidei](“the house that is the wellspring of your tears”), [Gherardini], [Uccellini](these last two are referred to as “allies” of the Amidei).“Il XVI è quasi tutto una cronaca irta di puri nomi, ed è la più lunga e piùarida pagina di cronaca di tutto il poema” (Canto XVI is nearly entirely achronicle bristling with mere names; it is the longest and most arid page ofchronicle in the entire poem [Momigliano, comm. to vv. 22–27]). Momigliano’sjudgment is, if more harsh than most, not atypical. Not only does it miss theaesthetic point of the catalogue of families (which might be compared to Homer’smasterful catalogue of ships in Iliad II—if it cannot hope to rival that firstand possibly best of literary catalogues), it severely overstates its length:not “quasi tutto una cronaca irta di puri nomi,” but only a little overone-third of the canto, occupying verses 88–139.For praise of the nostalgic poetic quality of Paradiso XVI, so roundlycriticized by so many readers precisely for its unpoetic qualities, see Porena’sfirst endnote in his commentary to this canto (appended to his comm. to verse154 in the DDP).

[part0013.html#c16-s32-e] Carroll: “[These lines] refer to the Cerchi(see note [in Carroll’s comm. to vv. 58–66]). Their houses were above the PortaSan Piero, and had been acquired by this wealthy family from the Conti Guidi,who sprang from the ancient house of the Ravignani, the head of which was theBellincion Berti of Par. XV. 112. The fellonia or treason charged against theCerchi seems to be their failure as leaders of the Whites to defend the cityagainst the Blacks in Nov. 1301. Dino Compagni says ‘their hearts failed themthrough cowardice’: the Priors gave them orders to prepare for defense and urgedthem ‘to play the man.’ But ‘from avarice’ they refused to pay the hired troops,made practically no preparations, and so handed over the city to six terribledays of outrage and pillage. The exile of the Whites which followed is the‘lightening of the barque’ to which Dante refers in line 96. For a full accountof this disastrous struggle between the Bianchi and the Neri, see DinoCompagni’s Chronicle, Bk. II, and Villani’s, VIII.38–49.”These six lines have been the cause of a certain confusion and of considerabledebate; Carroll’s view, however, seems sensible.

[part0013.html#c16-s39-e] Carroll: “A bitter stroke at theAdimari,—dragons to the timid, but to men with teeth or purse, lambs. Dante’sbitterness is not unnatural when we remember that, according to earlycommentators, one of this family, Boccaccino, gained possession of the poet’sproperty, and therefore opposed strenuously his recall from exile. This mightaccount also for his scorn of Filippo Argenti (Inf. VIII.31–64), who belonged toa branch of the Adimari.”The wife of Ubertino Donati, a member of the twenty-second family referred to inCacciaguida’s social registry of ancient Florence, was a daughter of BellincionBerti; Ubertino was displeased when Bellincione, his father-in-law, arranged forthe marriage of another of his daughters to a member of the Admiari clan, thusmaking Ubertino their kinsman.

Villani says heknighted five Florentine families, who for love of him bore his arms. One ofthese, the Della Bella, is here referred to as having surrounded the arms with aborder of gold. It was a member of this family, the famous Giano della Bella,who in 1293 proposed the Ordinances of Justice, in order to curb the lawlessnessof his own order, the nobles, and it is probably he who is referred to as having‘joined himself with the people.’ How the Marquis Hugh was converted, built theBadia, died on S.

[part0013.html#c16-s45-e] While both families, the Gualterotti andthe Importuni, were Guelph in the views of the local chroniclers (Villani,Compagni, Malispini), according to other documents, as reported by Bosco/Reggio(comm. to verse 133), the Gualterotti were in fact Ghibellines. Bosco/Reggiosuggest the contradiction may be explained by the diverse political sympathiesfound in diverse branches of the family.

[part0013.html#c16-s46-e] This is Cacciaguida’s rueful contemplationof the wrack and ruin caused by a single event. Here is Carroll (comm. to Par.XIV. 79–87) on this pivotal moment in the history of Florence: “The reference isto the well-known story of the murder of Buondelmonte de’ Buondelmonti in 1216.This young nobleman was betrothed to a lady of the Amidei family, but forsookher for a daughter of the house of the Donati. The kinsmen of the insulted ladywaylaid and slew him at the foot of the statue of Mars, ‘that mutilated stone,’as he rode into the city on Easter Day [Villani, Chron. V.38; Dino Compagni,1.2]. Well for the city, says Cacciaguida, if the first time he came to it hehad been drowned in the little stream of the Ema which flows through theValdigreve, a little south of Florence, where his castle lay. The murder wasgenerally regarded as the beginning of the feuds of Guelphs and Ghibellines ofwhich Dante himself was a victim; although, as Villani admits, ‘long beforethere were factions among the noble citizens, and the said parties existed byreason of the strifes and questions between the Church and the Empire’[Chronicle V.38].” [return to English [part0013.html#c16-s46-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c16-s46-i]]136–138. [part0013.html#c16-s46-e] The Amidei are portrayed as justly angeredby the snub to their name revealed in Buondelmonte’s behavior; it is from theirrage that originated the current sorrow of the city.

Mars as the pagan god of war is in this canto deployedagainst the Christian militancy that typifies the crusading spirit. SeeBorsellino (Bors.1995.1), p. 46, on the ambiguity of the sign of Mars in thiscanto, representing, in different contexts, both Heaven-approved crusading anddamnable internecine broils.

[part0013.html#c16-s50-e] For the question of the actual number of noblefamilies in Florence in the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, see Scartazzini(comm. to vv. 59–154). Villani (Cron. V.39) accounts for seventy noble familiesin 1215. (He also reports on the numbers for 1015 [Cron. IV.10–13].) Thediscrepancies between Dante’s figures and Villani’s lead Scartazzini to thinkthat Dante is not to be relied on for particulars of this kind. However, in thisverse Dante has Cacciaguida say that there were more than these forty famousfamilies that he has mentioned flowering at that time.

The image of the flag reversed uponits staff is apparently a reference to the following practice: Members of thevictorious army would drag the losers’ battle-flags upside down over the fieldof combat.In 1251 the Guelphs changed the design of the Florentine flag from a white lilyon a red field to a red lily on a white field, while the ousted Ghibellinesretained the traditional arrangement (according to Villani, Cronica, VI.43). AsStephany (Step.1973.1) points out, the original flag mirrors Cacciaguida’ssituation in the fifth heaven, red Mars quartered by a white Greek cross.[return to English [part0013.html#c16-s51-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c16-s51-i]]154.

[part0014.html#c17-s01-e] We have come to the midpoint of Paradiso. See,for a reading of this central canto, Brugnoli (Brug.1995.1), pointing out, amongother things, that the poet has underlined numerically this mathematical fact.Brugnoli demonstrates that the central cantos of the last canticle, XI–XXIII,are arranged, at least in terms of the number of verses that they contain, in apattern, as follows (the two bordering cantos, excluded from the pattern, arelisted, in the table below, in italics, only to indicate how noticeably theybreak it):[../images/00011.jpeg]Apparently Brugnoli did not know the work of John Logan (Loga.1971.1), pp.95–98, who had already made the identical observation, also pointing out thatthis pattern mirrored the pattern found in the line lengths of the centralthirteen cantos of Purgatorio precisely. (For treatments of the numerical centerof the whole poem, see the reference at the conclusion of the note to Purg.XVII.124–125.)For another and more recent attempt to deal with the “centers” of the threecanticles, see Ambrosini (Ambr.2002.1), pp. 253–54. His discussion begins andends with Singleton (Sing.1965.2), but is without reference to the work of Loganand (still more surprisingly) of Brugnoli.

[part0014.html#c17-s01-e] Phaeton sought reassurance from his mother,Clymene, against the denial (on the part of his “half-brother in divinity,” asit were, Epaphus, a son of Io by Jove) of his origin from divine Apollo’s seed(see Metam. I.747–789 [setting up the lengthy narrative of Phaeton’s disastrouschariot-ride, Metam. II.1–400]). So now does Dante wish to be enlightened aboutthe nature of the ills that will afflict him after 1300, ills that he has heardprophesied in Hell and in Purgatory (for all those prophetic passages [three ofthe last four are positive, not worrisome], see the note to vv. 43–99), even ifhe is assured of his eventual salvation. Beatrice and Cacciaguida share the roleof a wiser Apollo, confirming his purpose without destroying him by allowing arunaway journey through the heavens. In Ovid’s “tragic” narrative, Phaeton is,we remember, allowed to destroy himself through overenthusiastic evaluation ofhis own capacities as rookie sun-driver; in Dante’s comically resolved tale ofhis journey through the heavens, we see the protagonist as a wiser (andbetter-aided) version of Phaeton.See Moore (Moor.1896.1), p. 175, comparing Cacciaguida’s assurance that Dantewill survive his troubles to the Sibyl’s similar gesture toward Aeneas (Aen.VI.95–96); Moore goes on to mention both heroes’ calm acceptance of their fates(cf. Aen. VI.103–105). And see Schnapp (Schn.1991.2), pp. 217–19, and Picone(Pico.1994.1), pp. 181–82, for two particularly interesting responses to theseverses. Also see Brownlee (Brow.1984.1) for the “Phaeton program” in theCommedia. [return to English [part0014.html#c17-s01-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s01-i]]7–12. [part0014.html#c17-s03-e] These are the first words uttered by Beatricesince Paradiso XIV.18. They repeat something we have been told several times now(first at Par. I.85–87), that the souls of the saved have the capacity to readminds; thus speech addressing them, while technically unnecessary, has thebenefit to a mortal speaker of making his thoughts clear to himself so that hisquestioners, all of whom are necessarily saved souls, will have sufficientindication of what is “on his mind.” This only seems a curious notion; uponreflection it makes perfectly good sense (i.e., if he has a confused thought inhis mind, that is what his celestial interrogator will read in it). And whatother writer can we imagine having such a complex thought about thinking’srelationship to speech?The metaphor of thirst as representing desire for knowledge has also been beforeus previously in this canticle (first at Par. II.19). It is here used byBeatrice as part of a severely mixed metaphor, since she has at verse 7 referredto the vampa (ardor, flame) of Dante’s desire, now translated into water.Heavenly stylists are obviously not bound by the petty rules of mortalgrammarians.

[part0014.html#c17-s05-e] Dante’s words to Cacciaguida make plain thathe has understood a vital difference between mortal intelligence and that of thesaints: The latter see, in the eternal present in God, even contingencies (i.e.,those things that might either happen or not happen, in other words all possibleoccurrences, even those that in fact never did, or do, or will occur [see Par.XIII.63 and the note to Par. XIII.61–66]). The best we mortals can do, bycontrast, is to grasp certain definitional truths, for example, that no triangle(containing a total of 180 degrees) can possess two angles each of which isgreater than 90 degrees.Where Phaeton wanted to know about his ancestry, Dante wants to know from hisancestor (as we will learn in vv. 22–27) the path of his future life. However,both “sons” have absolutely in common the need to be reassured. [return toEnglish [part0014.html#c17-s05-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c17-s05-i]]13. [part0014.html#c17-s05-e] The word piota refers to the sole of the foot(see Inf. XIX.120); here it may literally mean footprint while, in metaphor, itwould rather seem to signify “root”; Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) discussesthe Tuscan use of the noun to indicate the clump of earth around the root systemof blades of grass, etc. And this seems the best way to take this passage:Cacciaguida is the patch of earth from which has sprung Dante’s “plant.” Cf.Paradiso XV. 88–89, where Cacciaguida refers to himself as the “root” (radice)that has produced Dante as its “bough” (fronda).

[part0014.html#c17-s07-e] It comes as something of a surprise to hearVirgil’s name on Dante’s lips at this point, and for the first time in thiscanticle. It is as though the Virgilian resonances of Canto XV.25–30 had stirredthe protagonist’s loyalties (the last time we heard Virgil’s name was in companyof Dante’s unique nominal presence [Purg. XXX.55]). This is the penultimate of32 appearances of the Roman poet’s name in the poem; the last will occur, inAdam’s mouth, surprisingly enough, at Paradiso XXVI.118 (an occurrence somehowoverlooked by Foster [Fost.1976.1], p. 72). Among denizens of the afterworld,only Beatrice is more often present in name (63 occurrences), if that of Godoccurs even more often than hers (more than 100 times).

In her view, he, like Dante, persecuted and unjustlycondemned, wrote a work of which he, again like Dante, was both author andprotagonist.For the Cacciaguida episode as also reflecting the sixth book of Cicero’s De republica, known as the Somnium Scipionis (and in this form commented on byMacrobius), see Schnapp (Schn.1986.1, e.g., p. 62, but passim) and Raffa(Raff.2000.1), pp. 147–64.

[part0014.html#c17-s09-e] Starting with Jacopo della Lana (comm. to thistercet), some early commentators attribute a version of this saying (“Jaculumpraevisum minus laedit” [A javelin blow hurts the less if it is foreseen]) to“Solomon”; others, later along, beginning with Daniello (comm. to verse 27), saythat it derives from a saying of Ovid’s: “Nam praevisa minus laedere telasolent” (For the blows of weapons that one sees coming do not usually hurt asmuch) but without specifying where in Ovid it is to be found. (Daniello alsorefers to the “Solomonic” dictum first found in Jacopo della Lana.) It wasVenturi (comm. to verse 27) who, while maintaining the attribution to Ovid, alsokept the first citation alive, but (correctly) reassigned it to Gregory theGreat and spiked the attribution to Solomon. However, the phantom attribution toOvid lasted into the twentieth century, despite the fact (which should haveraised more suspicion than it did) that it had never been assigned a specificsource in any Ovidian text. Finally, Vandelli (in the Scartazzini/Vandelli comm.to verse 27), referring to an article in BSDI (25 [1918], p. 108), reassigns thepopular tag to the Esopics of Waltherius anglicus (for Waltherius, see the noteto Inf. XXIII.4–18). In this “school” are found also Brezzi (Brez.1989.1), p.447, and Chiamenti (Chia.1995.1), p. 188. However, Aversano (Aver.2000.2) arguesfor the pivotal role of Gregory the Great’s Homilies (to Luke 21:9–19): “Minusenim iacula feriunt quae praevidentur” (For javelins that one sees coming woundthe less), rather than that of Waltherius because, both in Gregory and in Dante,the context is of the greater pain one suffers at the betrayal of one’s friendsthan at the hands of one’s known enemies (Aversano points to Dante’s sense ofbetrayal by his fellow exiles as registered in vv. 61–66).

Perhaps Dante refers to Sibyllineprophecy that resulted in human sacrifice (see the muffled but telling referenceto the killing of Iphigenia in Inferno XX.110–111). Such is opposed by a bettersacrifice, that of the Lamb, who took on all our sins (see, for the eventualbiblical source of the phrase in the liturgy, which pluralizes our sins[peccata], John 1:29: “Ecce agnus Dei; ecce qui tollit peccatum mundi” [Beholdthe lamb of God; behold the one who takes away the sins of the world]).

[part0014.html#c17-s11-e] The word ambage has an interesting history.Dante probably found its most troubling presence in Aeneid VI.99, where ambageswas used to typify the animal-like sounds of the cave-dwelling Sibyl’sprognostications. On the other hand, and as Pio Rajna (Rajn.1902.1) has pointedout, in Virgil, Ovid, and Statius it is also used to describe the twisting pathfound in the Cretan labyrinth; it also in Virgil indicates an enigmatic way ofspeaking. In De vulgari eloquentia (I.x.2), giving the palm for prose eloquenceto the French (to the Provençals and Italians is reserved that for vernacularpoetry [I.x.3–4]), Dante had referred to the term. The northerners are recordedas composing biblical narratives, tales of Troy and Rome, and the beautifulambage (fictions) of King Arthur’s court. Thus the word, a hapax in the poem,arrives in this context loaded with negative associations. [return to English[part0014.html#c17-s11-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c17-s11-i]]32. [part0014.html#c17-s11-e] The verb inviscarsi has been used twice before(Inf. XIII.57 and XXII.144). In the first instance (where the verb’s root isspelled invesc-), Pier delle Vigne speaks of the guileful properties of words(see Marchesi [Marc.1997.1]); the second passage describes winged demons caughtin the pitch over which they are playing a cruel game with a sinner whotemporarily outwits them. The verb describes the effects of birdlime, spread toentrap birds. It was a favorite word to Petrarch, who liked to describe Laura’sbeauty as imprisoning him.

[part0014.html#c17-s12-e] The word “latino” has caused debate, with theprimary warring interpretations being (1) it refers, as it has throughoutInferno, to things Italian (whether the country or, as twice in Paradiso, itslanguage) and (2) it here means “Latin,” for the negative reason that, if itdoes not, then Dante has committed himself to a tautological expression, since“chiare parole” (plain words) and “preciso latin” (clear speech) signify thesame thing.For examples of arguments devoted to each of these views, see (for [1]) Honess(Hone.1994.1), pp. 51–52, and (for [2]) Vianello (Vian. 1968.1), pp. 593–94. Theview put forward by Vianello does not admit that the two terms may predicatediffering things of Cacciaguida’s speech. However, the first term (chiareparole) may refer to his diction, the second (preciso latin) to his syntacticalcommand of the language, his substance and his style, as it were. See, for anexample (and it is only the very first example) of this poet’s pleasure in“multi-predication,” Inferno 1.5, “esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte”; inshort, Dante’s usual habit would seem to support the first view. Furthermore, inthe rest of the poem “latino” only once seems surely to refer to the Latinlanguage (Par. X.120). On most other occasions it clearly means “Italian” (Inf.XXII.65; XXVII.27; XXVII.33; XXVIII.71; XXIX.88; XXIX.91; Purg. XI.58; XIII.92;and here, where it is employed for the last [thirteenth] time in the poem).[return to English [part0014.html#c17-s12-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s12-i]]37–42. [part0014.html#c17-s13-e] The old (and apparently never successfullydisposed of [if what one hears in one’s own classroom even now is any guide])problem that many an early Christian theologian felt he had to grapple with, howGod’s foreknowledge does not limit freedom of the will, is here resolved inimagistic terms: God’s knowing what you will do does not cause you to do it,just as when you watch a ship moving downstream, its motion is not propelled byyour observing eyes.

[part0014.html#c17-s13-e] Brezzi (Brez.1989.1), p. 448, underlines theimportance of the concept of contingency in this canto, first at verse 16(“contingenti”) and then here (“contingenza”), as opposed to those things thatare eternal. (See also the “cluster” of concern with contingent things in Par.XIII.63, XIII.64, and XIII.69.) The word (used as a verb) will reemerge for afinal appearance in Paradiso XXV.1.

[part0014.html#c17-s15-e] Cacciaguida’s lengthy personal prophecy ofthe course of Dante’s future life, the ninth and final one in the poem(stopping, strictly speaking, at verse 93, it is nonetheless exactly the samelength as the preceding eight put together), eclipses all that we have learnedfrom the four in Inferno (Ciacco, VI.64–75; Farinata, X.79–81; Brunetto,XV.55–57, 61–66, 70–75; Vanni Fucci, XXIV.143–150) and the four found inPurgatorio (Currado Malaspina, VIII.133–139; Oderisi, XI.140–141; Bonagiunta,XXIV.37–38; Forese, XXIV.82–90). See Pasquini (Pasq.1996.1), p. 419. This isclearly meant to be taken as the most important prognostication of Dante’spersonal involvement in the political affairs of his world. If we consider thateach of the first two canticles has four such passages and that this one, comingin the central canto of the third, is so detailed, it becomes clear that it ismeant to overwhelm in importance all those that have preceded.Chiarenza (Chia.1983.3), p. 145, juxtaposes the two Ovidian myths found in thiscanto, Phaeton and Hippolytus (see the note to vv. 46–48), arguing that thefirst is emblematic of damnation, the second of salvation.

[part0014.html#c17-s15-e] The first commentator to be clear about theproblems of this passage is Fallani (comm. to this tercet), referring to hisgloss on Purg. IX.144, in which he cites Casimiri’s lecture of 1924. Casimiriinsisted that there were no instances of singing to organ accompaniment untilthe fifteenth century. Fallani is of the opinion that some of the earlycommentators (e.g., Jacopo della Lana, the Ottimo, Francesco da Buti, theAnonimo Fiorentino), when speaking of “il cantare degli organi,” probably werereferring only to the harmony established by two or more voices singingdifferent notes, not to the musical instrument, the organ. For earlierdiscussion of this material, see the note to Purgatorio IX.139–145. And seeHeilbronn-Gaines (Heil.1995.2), arguing that here the singular form organoclearly marks this reference as being to vocal polyphony, while the pluralorgani (as in Purg. IX.144) refers to the musical instrument.No matter how discordant the sounds of his great-great-grandson’s comingtravails may seem, Cacciaguida would seem to be insisting, they will eventuallybe heard as harmony, at least once Dante’s task is completed.

[part0014.html#c17-s16-e] At least since the time of Scartazzini,commentators have recognized that the word indicating a cruel stepmother(noverca: Phaedra, Florence) and that indicating a man unjustly exiled(immeritum: Hippolytus, Dante) are found in a passage in Ovid’s Metamorphoses(XV.497–505). Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet) point out that the words exulimmeritus found in four of Dante’s thirteen epistles likely come from thispassage in Ovid and that Hippolytus, as a result, should be considered a figuraDantis. And for Dante’s sense of himself as sharing with Ovid the experience ofexile, see the note to verses 55–57.As Cacciaguida begins his lengthy series of predictions concerning Dante’s life,we may perhaps remember that two passages in Inferno (X.130–132 and XV.88–90)surely seem to promise that Beatrice will be the one to reveal to Dante thecourse of his future life. Several readers have advanced hypotheses in order toaccount for Dante’s obvious change in plan, most notably Marguerite MillsChiarenza. For a summary of her argument, see the note to Inferno X.130–132.[return to English [part0014.html#c17-s16-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s16-i]]46. [part0014.html#c17-s16-e] Chiarenza (Chia.1966.1 [and see alsoChia.1983.3]) was perhaps the first to examine the import to Dante of the restof the tale of Hippolytus: his restoration from death and his ensuing life inexile from Athens under the name “Virbius.” She argues that Dante could haveknown this part of Hippolytus’s tale from Virgil (Aen. VII.777) and from Ovid(Metam. XV.497–546 [a connection first observed by Jacopo della Lana, comm. tovv. 46–48, if without naming Virbius]). (Dante might not have required theauthority of Servius [alluded to by Chiarenza] who etymologizes Hippolytus’sposthumous name as “bis vir” [twice a man], but simply seen these obvious Latinroots himself.) Chiarenza’s conclusion is that the Virbius tradition gives Dantemuch more than a political self-justification, namely, a sense of his ownspiritual second life. On the other hand, it does limn in precise parallel theFlorentine’s escape from the political dangers of the world of “Thebes” (inInferno an insistent stand-in for the ailing and divided city of man on earth,the city of destruction that surely reminded the poet of the internecine woes ofFlorence [see Inf. XIV.69; XX.32; XXV.15; XXX.2; XXX.22; XXXII.11; XXXIII.89;there are three references to the Greek city in Purgatorio, but these are rathermore neutral in tone]).

[part0014.html#c17-s17-e] If the reader has been missing Virgil, thiscanto brings his name back into play (see the note to verse 19). And if thereader has missed the presence of one of Dante’s favorite whipping boys, PopeBoniface VIII, here he is, officiating over a corrupt Roman clergy that makesits profit out of selling Christ. We might almost be back in Inferno XIX ratherthan at the midpoint of Paradiso. [return to English [part0014.html#c17-s17-e] /Italian [part0025.html#c17-s17-i]]51. [part0014.html#c17-s17-e] How to translate tutto dì? We have decided,finding little help in the commentaries, that the phrase is more likely to referto an imagined single long day in the “marketplace” of the Vatican rather thanto an endless succession of days. Both solutions are found in the commentaries,the second more often. However, it seems to us that the sense of “all day long”is both more caustic and less obvious. [return to English[part0014.html#c17-s17-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c17-s17-i]]52–54. [part0014.html#c17-s18-e] The poet looks back at his banishment, an“injured party” indeed, from Florence; then he turns to God’s swift retributivejustice, evident at least in the death of Boniface in 1303. Some dates that arepertinent here: Boniface was plotting against the Florentine White Guelphs asearly as April 1300 (or so Dante probably believed); Dante was nearly certainlyin Rome circa October 1301; on 27 January 1302 the Whites were banished fromFlorence. Possibly the most painful period in Dante’s life is rehearsed in theselines.Perhaps encouraged by the use of the same noun at verse 69, where it obviouslydoes refer to a political party, some take the noun parte in verse 52 to referto the White Guelphs. On the other hand, since Cacciaguida’s entire prophecy isdirected toward Dante’s personal future, we probably should understand thatDante himself is the “offended party” whose innocence will be proclaimed in thevengeance he will enjoy once God intervenes to set things right. However, thefirst to take the passage in this way appear to have been the sixteenth-centurycommentators Alessandro Vellutello and Bernardino Daniello (comms. to thistercet); nearly all the earlier ones take the victims to be the exiled WhiteGuelphs (including Dante, of course). Since we will shortly hear, in only thinlyveiled ways, of the enmity Dante felt from his fellow Whites in exile (vv.61–66), it would be extremely odd for him to think of them as sharing his statusas victim here. It really seems necessary to believe that this parte, like thatin verse 69, is a party of one.Vellutello, perhaps following the lead of Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 46–57)in citing these particulars, is of the opinion that signs of Dante’s “revenge”were evident in the various Florentine disasters of the spring of 1304; theseare recounted more fully elsewhere (in his comm. to Inf. XXVI.7–9): the collapseof the Ponte alla Carraia because of the vast crowds of those who had assembledon the bridge to watch a spectacle enacted on the river below in which Hell wasdisplayed (a “spectacle” that Dante himself would within several years begin toproduce in writing, possibly with this one in mind); the civil war between theWhite and the Black Guelphs; and the terrible fire that destroyed seventeenhundred houses in the city (see Villani, Cron. VIII.70–71). Over the years therehave been other candidates as well. The facts that these events were socataclysmic (two major disasters and a civil war), involved such dramatic lossof life and destruction of property, seemed indeed like God’s punishment uponthe city, and occurred so soon after Dante was exiled (a mere two years) allcombine to give continuing support to Vellutello’s hypothesis. Of course, therewere other notable events that the poet might have considered the result ofGod’s hand smiting the enemies of Dante Alighieri, “a Florentine by birth butnot in his behaviors” (as he describes himself in the salutation of the Epistleto Cangrande), for instance the death of Boniface VIII in 1303 (the choice ofsome commentators) or of Corso Donati in 1308 (the choice of others). However,everything in this lengthy passage is centered both on Dante and on his fecklessfellow Florentines. For this reason Vellutello’s interpretation seems moreworthy of attention than others.

[part0014.html#c17-s19-e] The protagonist has asked his ancestor toprovision him against the “slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune” (verse 27);Cacciaguida now responds by referring to the sharpest wound of all: his exile.For Dante’s sense of himself as the Italian Ovid, see Smarr (Smar.1991.1). Fromher observation that Ovid casts himself in the role of wandering Ulysses in boththe Tristia and the Ars amatoria, she argues that Dante takes Ovid as a negativeversion of himself. For another treatment of Ovid as Dante’s counterpart inexile, see Picone (Pico.1999.3). And see the note to vv. 46–48.

[part0014.html#c17-s20-e] One of the most celebrated tercets in thepoem, bringing home to the reader the poet’s daily sense of abandonment in hisexilic condition, a necessary guest even under the best of circumstances (andwith the most benign of hosts). The poet’s understatement catches perfectly therhythm of the exile’s daily round, going downstairs with perhaps some sense thatthis day may bring tidings betokening a possible return to Florence, and thenmounting back up at night with the deadened senses of one who knows that lifewill probably merely continue as it is.

From the beginning, all have agreed that it refers to the bittertaste of bread (or anything else) eaten in bitter conditions. The “unofficialcommentary tradition,” that is, ordinary readers, however, senses a reference tothe way bread is prepared in Florence (to this day): It is baked without salt.Pietrobono (comm. to vv. 58–60) is the first commentator even to refer to thatfact and simply denies its relevance (thus revealing that some discussants hadraised this issue), insisting on the larger and obvious meaning. (He cites theoften-cited passage in Convivio [I.iii.4] in which Dante laments his exilicexperience.) Fallani (comm. to vv. 58–60) explains that the salty taste issupplied by the exile’s tears.Longfellow (comm. to this verse) cites several pertinent passages, includingEcclesiasticus 29:24 [29:31–32 in the Vulgate] and 40:28–29 [29–30]: “It is amiserable thing to go from house to house; for where thou art a stranger, thoudarest not open thy mouth. Thou shalt entertain and feast, and have no thanks:moreover, thou shalt hear bitter words.…” “My son, lead not a beggar’s life, forbetter it is to die than to beg.

[part0014.html#c17-s21-e] Dante became “a party of one” (verse 69) whenhe was disgusted with the efforts of his fellow exiles to make their way backinto Florence, circa 1304. His correctness (we imagine a large meeting in whichDante was able to accomplish what the American comedian Mort Sahl, some fiveminutes into one of his scabrous and rollicking routines, used to ponder: “Isthere anyone here I haven’t offended yet?”) about the folly of theirpreparations was, as far as he was concerned, reflected in their crushing defeat(an army of more than 10,000 men was routed, leaving 400 dead behind) by theBlack Guelphs at the fortress Lastra a Signa, three kilometers from the walls ofFlorence, on 20 July 1304, during which battle Dante was in Arezzo. By a twistof circumstance, that put him there on the very day Francesco Petrarca was bornin that city. [return to English [part0014.html#c17-s21-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s21-i]]65–66. [part0014.html#c17-s22-e] While some of the earlier commentators (e.g.,Portirelli to vv. 61–69) see the red of bloody wounds to the head, the majorityof them think only of the red of a guilty blush. Dante’s point would seem to bethat theirs would be no ordinary blushes (infusing only the cheeks with color),but would cover their entire countenances, even up to the hairline. In moderntimes, Scartazzini (comm. to verse 66) began the tradition of seeing bothmeanings in the line. That line of attack has, however, had little success, andtwentieth-century commentators are fairly evenly divided in choosing one or theother. However, the phrase does seem a strange way to indicate those lying deadon the field of battle, since we assume that most of them were not killed byblows to the head (nor imagined as having blood from their other wounds or fromthe wounds of others staining their heads), while all of his former allies must(in Dante’s view) now feel ashamed (i.e., are blushing) for having turnedagainst him, reviling his opposition to their bankrupt and eventuallyanti-Florentine schemes. Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 64–66) object that blushescover one’s cheeks, not the forehead. But that, perhaps, is exactly Dante’spoint: This is no ordinary blush, but burns on all the exposed parts of theface, “blushing to the roots of their hair,” as the English expression has it.[return to English [part0014.html#c17-s22-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s22-i]]67–69. [part0014.html#c17-s23-e] The only other appearance of the nounbestialitade is in Inferno XI.83, where its meaning is much debated. See thenote to Inferno XI.76–90 and Fosca’s commentary to that passage (vv. 79–84) forthe minority opinion, followed here, that bestialitade refers to the lowest formof fraud, treachery, as surely Dante sees his supposed allies among the WhiteGuelphs (and those fellow-traveling exiled Ghibellines who had joined forceswith them), who deserted Dante’s advocacy of the proper initiative against theBlack Guelph rulers of the city. (Of course we know nothing of the matter[s] indispute, just that there was a dispute and that it was pivotal and had adramatic result, the defeat at La Lastra.) We remember that Antenora was thezone of Cocytus in which we found those who had betrayed country or party(Inferno XXXII.70–XXXIII.90), possibly the very sin Dante attributed to hisfellow exiles, effectively dooming the cause and leaving him to form a “party ofone.”The context of this entire passage, vv. 52–75, is unabashedly Dante-centered, somuch so that even the most zealous lover of this poet may feel the stingingwarmth of embarrassment stealing up and over his face, blushing to the roots ofhis hair. [return to English [part0014.html#c17-s23-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s23-i]]70–71. [part0014.html#c17-s24-e] Some commentators explain that, while Veronawas not in fact the first place that Dante was received as he began his twentyyears of exile (he did not arrive there for between one year and two [in 1303 or1304] after he left Rome in 1302), it was nonetheless his first “real” shelter.The succession of the Scaligeri, the ruling family of Verona in Dante’s time,was as follows: Mastino della Scala had become the ruler in 1262; he wassucceeded by his brother Alberto in 1277. Alberto died in 1301 and wassucceeded, in turn, by each of his three sons: Bartolommeo (who died in March1304), Alboino (who died late in 1311, having just been named by Henry VII hisimperial vicar, a title passed along at his death to his younger brother, whohad joined him in joint rulership in 1308), and Cangrande (the youngest, born in1291 and who died in 1329, eight years after Dante’s death). (Alberto also siredtheir illegitimate half brother Giuseppe, abbot of San Zeno [see Purg.XVIII.124].) According to what, after Petrocchi’s work, has become a widespreadunderstanding, Dante left Verona soon after the accession of Alboino in 1304 andreturned in 1312 or 1313, that is, once Cangrande had assumed sole power. It hasbecome an assumption in Dante studies that for some reason Dante and Alboinojust did not get along, thus explaining the poet’s eight years or more ofabsence from a city for which he obviously felt deep affection.For a sketch of the historical situation after Cangrande’s accession to unsharedpower, after Alboino died in 1311, see Manselli (Mans.1966.1). Manselli takesDante’s praise of Cangrande as genuine, since he was the only one active on thescene whom Dante considered capable, both in his personal qualities and byvirtue of his political position, of carrying out the lofty imperial missionunsuccessfully initiated by Henry VII.There is a large literature devoted to what was at one time a vexed question:Which Scaliger governed Verona when Dante first arrived? Now just about allagree that it was Bartolommeo. For a summary of the dispute, in English, seeCarroll (comm. to vv. 70–75). For a fuller treatment, summarizing the entiredebate and concluding, with nearly all the early commentators, that Bartolommeowas indeed Dante’s first meaningful supporter in his exile, see Scartazzini(comm. to vv. 70–93).

[part0014.html#c17-s24-e] See Tozer (comm. to vv. 71–72): “The arms of theScaligers were a golden ladder in a red field, surmounted by a black eagle,which was the imperial ensign.” Unfortunately for Dante’s sake, this insigniawas not chosen by the Scaligeri (at the earliest, by Bartolommeo) before 1301.By making it present now, in 1300, the poet hurries history along faster than itwants to go.

[part0014.html#c17-s25-e] That is to say, Bartolommeo and Dante willgrant one another’s requests even before the other can make them, while in mostcases the granting follows much later than the asking (i.e., it may not beforthcoming at all). [return to English [part0014.html#c17-s25-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s25-i]]76–90. [part0014.html#c17-s26-e] Commentators agree that this passage refersto Cangrande della Scala, one of the great figures of his time in northernItaly. He was indeed a “son of Mars,” a fearless and fabled warrior, and a manof, in Dante’s eyes, impeccable political convictions, an extreme supporter ofEmperor Henry while he lived, and a man who refused to relinquish his title asimperial vicar even when the pope insisted that he do so (since there was nolonger an emperor to be vicar to). For a portrait of the man and his court, seeCarroll (comm. to vv. 76–93).It has seemed reasonable to some to point out that Cangrande was too young in1300 to be the subject of so dramatic a prophecy (not to mention the one in Inf.I, if that, also, applies to him), since he was only nine years old in 1300 andonly around fourteen or fifteen when Dante began writing the poem. However,those who have made this argument have neglected to take three things intoaccount: First, stories about Cangrande as a child prodigy were abundant (e.g.,in one such the boy is depicted as being shown a chest, opened to reveal thecoins and jewels it contains; he reaches out and covers that pelf back over withits cloth: See Cacciaguida’s words in vv. 83–84 and Benvenuto’s gloss to them[comm. to vv. 82–84]; and see the similar sentiment expressed of the veltro,Inf. I.103); second, Cangrande had been named commander in chief of the Veronesearmies before he was in his teens; third, and in general, expectations of theprinces of royal houses and other such luminaries were simply out of allproportion to our own expectations of the young. See the note to InfernoI.100–105. Further, if this later passage was written when Cangrande was wellinto his twenties, as it undoubtedly was, it is not surprising that it looks tohim to take over the role of the veltro and of the “five hundred ten and five.”But see the note to Paradiso XXVII.142–148. [return to English[part0014.html#c17-s26-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c17-s26-i]]78. [part0014.html#c17-s26-e] What does Dante imagine Cangrande willaccomplish politically? Somehow, he apparently must think, Cangrande will finishthe task that Henry started but failed to complete, the reestablishment ofconditions leading to the refounding of Aeneas’s Rome. That is the only surmisepossible that might justify the amazingly positive things said throughout thiseventually unexpressed (or better, suppressed [see vv. 92–93]) prophecy. It isnot, perhaps, “officially” one of the three “world prophecies” that appear, onein each cantica (Inf. I, Purg. XXXIII, Par. XXVII), but it reflects the firsttwo of them and informs the third. [return to English [part0014.html#c17-s26-e]/ Italian [part0025.html#c17-s26-i]]79–81. [part0014.html#c17-s27-e] Dante takes the sticks out of the hands ofthose who would beat him about the head for prognosticating such things about amere child. See the note to verses 76–90. [return to English[part0014.html#c17-s27-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c17-s27-i]]82–84. [part0014.html#c17-s28-e] The “Gascon” (Pope Clement V) first led Henryon and then tried to undermine his imperial efforts. The date most commentatorsaffix to the pope’s open hostility to Henry is 1312, when the emperor hoped tobe crowned (a second time in Italy) in St. Peter’s, but was put off and finallyrelegated by decision of Clement to St. John Lateran, outside the walls of thecity and in ruins. The “sparks” of virtue with which Cangrande is credited heremay have been his demonstrations of support for the emperor; similarly, his“toil” is perhaps his effort, unrewarded, on Henry’s behalf (for this view, seeCarroll [comm. to vv. 76–93]). More likely, the first signs of virtue apparentin his not caring for worldly possessions was, apparently, a part of his“legend” (see the note to vv. 76–90); as for the affanni (toils) he does notcomplain about, most who remark on them take them as referring to his militaryexercises.

XXXI.88) and the Virgin (Par. XXXIII.20) are allowed toshare this word with Cangrande. See also the first word of the dedication to himof Epistle XIII, “Magnifico.” [return to English [part0014.html#c17-s29-e] /Italian [part0025.html#c17-s29-i]]89–90. [part0014.html#c17-s30-e] Steiner was the first among the commentatorsto see the possible connection with a part of Mary’s hymn of praise for herLord, Luke 1:52–53: “He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exaltedthem of low degree. He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich hehas sent away empty” (comm. to vv. 89–90). In light of this scripturalconnection, Porena (comm. to these verses) thinks of Cangrande as a sort ofLombard Robin Hood. [return to English [part0014.html#c17-s30-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s30-i]]91–93. [part0014.html#c17-s31-e] It is difficult to see how this blank“prophecy” of the things that will be accomplished by Cangrande, imperial vicarthat he was and insisted on being even after Henry’s death, is anything but“imperial” in nature. (Henry, betrayed by Pope Clement V in 1312, is referred toa few lines ago [verses 82]). See Di Scipio’s (Disc.1983.1) convincing attack onPasserin D’Entrèves (Pass.1955.1) for denying Dante’s significant involvementwith imperial ideas (in favor of religious orthodoxy), a position that simplyfails to account for such clearly political (and imperial) passages as these.It seems likely that Dante’s optimism about Cangrande’s future deeds is more theresult of desperation than hope. Here was a man who had decided, upon preciouslittle evidence, when he was writing the fourth book of Convivio, that the RomanEmpire would be active once more. Within a decade an emperor comes down to Italyand behaves like the new Charlemagne, as far as Dante is concerned. One can onlyimagine (but the edgy tone of his second epistle to the emperor tells us a greatdeal about his growing disillusionment) the bitterness he felt once Henry haddied in 1313. And now, some four or five years later, here he is, shouting atthe top of his lungs, “The emperor is dead, long live the emperor!” He had, withlittle in the way of hard evidence, simply decided that Rome must rise again.And events made him correct. If Italy had not been ready for Henry (see Par.XXX.137–138), it would have to be ready for what Cangrande would do to clear thepath for the next emperor. It may not be excessive to suggest that Dante felt as“keyed in” to the political events of his day, even before they occurred, asFyodor Dostoyevski felt himself endowed with prescience about those of his time.Carolyn Calvert Phipps (in a seminar in 1980) pointed out that there is apossible dependence here on the prophetic book referred to in the Apocalypse(10:4): “Signa quae locuta sunt septem tonitrua: et noli ea scribere” (Seal upthose things which the seven thunders said and write them not). This is theinstruction given John by the angel who brings him God’s prophetic book for himto ingest. What makes Professor Phipps’s observation particularly worthy ofstudy is that there may be another possible visitation of the tenth chapter ofthe Apocalypse in this canto; see the note to vv. 130–132. [return to English[part0014.html#c17-s31-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c17-s31-i]]94–96. [part0014.html#c17-s32-e] Concluding, Cacciaguida characterizes hisutterances over the last seventeen tercets (vv. 43–93) as chiose (glosses); thislong prophetic passage is unique in the poem, both for its length and for itspersonal import for the protagonist. It is divided into three sections, lines43–69 (the pains of exile [Dante]); 70–75 (the first stay in Verona[Bartolommeo]); 76–93 (the second stay in Verona [Cangrande]).What exactly do these “glosses” predict of Dante’s difficult life as an exile?See the note to verses 52–54 for the range of possibilities according to thecommentators. And to what specific prognostications do they respond, onlyCacciaguida’s here or to some of the earlier ones we heard in the first twocantiche, and if so, to which ones? We can say with some security that only thefirst section of his ancestor’s prophecy, that concerning Dante’s harshpolitical fate, is involved. It is worth remarking that the time frame thatCacciaguida seems to have in mind is short (a pochi giri), and that thus weshould probably think that the events of 1304, just four revolutions of theheavens away from the date on which he speaks (1 April 1300), are likely what hehas in mind. [return to English [part0014.html#c17-s32-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s32-i]]97–99. [part0014.html#c17-s33-e] Cacciaguida’s repeated promise of Dante’svindication in the punishment of his enemies sounds very much as it did when itfirst was uttered in vv. 53–54. As for the notion contained in the neologisms’infutura (present tense of Dante’s coinage, infuturarsi [lit. “to infutureoneself”]), ever since the early days of the commentary tradition at least somehave argued that it would have been bad taste and out of keeping with Christiandoctrine (not to mention the poet’s own stated views) for Dante to have boastedat having survived his enemies in the flesh. Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to thistercet) does not even consider this possibility, referring only to Dante’shonorable name as what will survive him, and survive longer than the dishonor ofhis enemies. Nonetheless, such a vaunt has been a long-standing trait in thosewho have survived the threatening behaviors of such powerful enemies as BonifaceVIII (dead in 1303) or Corso Donati (dead in 1308). (Boniface is mentioned inthis context by several commentators, although it is a bit of a stretch tobelieve that Dante thought of him as a “neighbor.”) Porena points out (comm. tothis tercet) that the “orthodox” interpretation, ridding Dante of a perhapspetty desire to outlive his enemies, makes little sense, since his immortallongings (see vv. 119–120) are considerably grander than the afterlives heforesees for his Florentine enemies, clearly meant to be in oblivion while Dantelives on. If that was his wish, he has been rewarded. [return to English[part0014.html#c17-s33-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c17-s33-i]]100–102. [part0014.html#c17-s34-e] The metaphor, drawn from weaving, has itthat Cacciaguida has finished answering Dante’s question (the “warp”) with hisresponse (the “woof”), thus completing the pattern. See the earlier use of asimilar metaphor, describing Piccarda’s words (Par. III.95–96). [return toEnglish [part0014.html#c17-s34-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c17-s34-i]]103–105. [part0014.html#c17-s35-e] A “pseudo-simile” (see the note to Inf.XXX.136–141) in which the protagonist is compared to someone—very much likehimself—asking a question of a person whom he trusts and loves—exactly such aone as Cacciaguida.

If he will lose his nativecity within two years because of his obstinate adherence to telling the truth,should not he then consider mitigating his bitter words in complaint of thehuman iniquity found in other parts of Italy lest he be denied shelter andsupport in his exile? Since we have read the poem (which he only imagineswriting at this point), we know that he did not succumb to the Siren song of“safety first.” However, and as Carroll suggests (comm. to vv. 106–120), “Inthose days of the vendetta it is a marvel that a sudden knife in the heart didnot send Dante to make actual acquaintance with that invisible world whosesecrets he feigned to know.” [return to English [part0014.html#c17-s37-e] /Italian [part0025.html#c17-s37-i]]111. [part0014.html#c17-s37-e] For a source of this verse, Brugnoli(Brug.1995.1), pp. 56–57, cites Ovid, Tristia II.207: “Perdiderint cum me duocrimina, carmen et error.…” (Although two crimes, one a poem, one a mistake,shall have brought me to perdition …). This text, highly familiar and certainlymost applicable to Dante, is somehow almost entirely lacking from the commentarytradition, appearing only once before, in Boccaccio’s Vita Ovidii (in his comm.to the literal sense of Inf. IV.90), and never, or so it seems, in the contextof Dante’s own exile. [return to English [part0014.html#c17-s37-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s37-i]]112–120.

Whilehe might have won the goodwill of some of us by gilding the lily, as it were, hewould have lost his claim on the rest of us (we do indeed call Dante’s time“ancient,” do we not?). For we want truth in our poetry, not blandishment.[return to English [part0014.html#c17-s38-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s38-i]]118. [part0014.html#c17-s40-e] Beginning with Scartazzini (comm. to thisverse), the Aristotelian provenance of this gesture has been amply noted (thebeginning of the Ethics [I.4]): “For friends and truth are both dear to us, butit is a sacred duty to prefer the truth.” Dante himself has quoted or referredto this dictum on at least three occasions (Conv. IV.viii.13; Mon. III.i.3;Epist. XI.11). Cf. also the frequently cited Aristotelian tag, “Assuredly, I amPlato’s friend, but I am still more a friend to truth.” [return to English[part0014.html#c17-s40-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c17-s40-i]]119. [part0014.html#c17-s40-e] Brunetto had taught him how to make himselfimmortal, “come l’uom s’etterna” (Inf. XV.85). It is not, we can assume, byflattering one’s hosts. Brunetto seems to have been on Dante’s mind in thiscontext; see the note to verses 121–122. [return to English[part0014.html#c17-s40-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c17-s40-i]]121–122. [part0014.html#c17-s41-e] Cacciaguida’s shining presence is verballyreminiscent of the identical phrasing found in Inferno XV.119, where Brunettorefers to his own work (for the question of exactly which work, whether Tresoror Tesoretto, see the note to Inf. XV.119, and Hollander [Holl.1992.2], p. 228,n. 82) as il mio Tesoro, the same words that we find here, used of Cacciaguida.Are we perhaps to believe that, for Dante, Cacciaguida is a better, truer“father” than Brunetto? See Quinones (Quin.1979.1), pp. 174–76, and Ordiway(Ordi.1990.1) on Brunetto’s replacement by Cacciaguida.This is the sixth appearance (of seven) in the poem of the word tesoro. It firstappeared in Inferno XV.119 (where Brunetto Latini alludes to his book of thattitle); then in Inferno XIX.90 (where Christ wants no “treasure” from Peter incompensation for the spiritual gifts He bestows upon him [as opposed to SimonMagus, who wants to acquire such gifts for a price]). In the first canto of thelast canticle (Par. I.11), the poet refers to the “treasure” of God’s kingdomthat he has been able to store in his memory; the word is then found in ParadisoV.29 (where it refers to God’s greatest gift to humankind, the freedom of ourwill); X.108 (representing the worldly goods that Peter Lombard renounced inorder to follow Christ); and finally in XXIII.133 (designating the treasure inheaven of Matthew 6:20 [and/or 19:21], as Tommaseo [comm. to vv. 133–135] wasapparently the first commentator to observe). That last reference eventuallycolors all that precedes it. In the final reckoning, worldly treasure ismeasured against this sole standard. And thus the word tesoro, which begins itscourse through the poem as the title for one of Brunetto Latini’s works (bywhich he hopes to have achieved “immortality” in the world, a contradiction interms), is examined and reexamined in such ways as to suggest either thedesirability of renunciation of earthly “treasure” or the preferability of itsheavenly counterpart, that “treasure in Heaven” that we may discover through theexercise of God’s greatest gift to us, our true treasure here on earth, the freewill, in our attempt to gain a better (and eternal) reward.The poet’s clear enthusiasm for his ancestor’s noble sacrifice at least castsinto doubt the central thesis of Brenda Deen Schildgen’s article (Schi.1998.1)and book (Schi.2002.1), namely, that Dante did not promote crusading in the HolyLand, a position that may have the advantage of having a certain vogue amongthose who find crusading distasteful, but no other.

[part0014.html#c17-s42-e] Cacciaguida admits that Dante’struth-telling will hurt all those who either themselves have given offense orwho bear the sins of their relations on their consciences, but encourages him totell the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

[part0014.html#c17-s43-e] This tercet contains terms that have apossible relevance to Dante’s sense of his own poeticizing. First, there ismenzogna (a reference to the bella menzogna [beautiful lie] that represents akind of poetry, as in Conv. II.i.3). Next we come upon the term visione (seePar. XXXIII.62), a kind of writing distinguished by being (or by claiming to be)literally true. This lofty word has barely ceased resonating when Dante descendsthe stylistic ladder to perhaps the lowest level of the vernacular that weencounter in this canticle, grattar dov’ è la rogna (scratch where it itches).In three lines he puts forward what the poem is not (a tissue of lies, a “mere”fiction), what it is (an inspired vision), and what style its author insiststhat he employs (the comic, or low vernacular, style). See the notes to InfernoXX.I–3, XX.106–114, and XX.130; Purgatorio IX.34–42 and XXX.21; and ParadisoI.20–21. [return to English [part0014.html#c17-s43-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s43-i]]130–132. [part0014.html#c17-s44-e] While few of the commentators suggest asource for this tercet, Pietro di Dante is a rare early exception (comm. to vv.127–132 [only in his first redaction]). He cites, after various other potentialsources, the text that alone has had a “career” among Dante’s commentators tothis passage, Boethius (Cons. Phil. III.1[pr]), a citation only recurring nearlyfive centuries later in Campi (comm. to this tercet). In the first half of thetwentieth century it is found in Grandgent (comm. to this tercet) and inScartazzini/Vandelli (comm. to verse 132). Porena (comm. to verse 132) alsocites it, but sees a possible problem with its pertinence to Dante’s context.However, it currently enjoys a certain stability, finding its way to most recentcommentaries. Boethius’s text reads: “Talia sunt quae restant, ut degustataquidem mordeant, interius autem recepta dulcescant” (You will find what I haveyet to say bitter to the taste, but, once you have digested it, it will seemsweet [tr. R. Green]). However, there is no instance of a commentator referringto a biblical text (a close neighbor of one that may have been on Dante’s mindonly shortly before [see the note to vv. 91–93]), one found in John’s Revelation(Apocalypse 10:9 [repeated nearly verbatim in 10:10]), where the angel isaddressing the apostle: “Accipe librum, et devora illum: et faciet amaricariventrem tuum, sed in ore tuo erit dulce tanquam mel” (Take the book and eat it;it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey).[return to English [part0014.html#c17-s44-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s44-i]]133–142. [part0014.html#c17-s45-e] Cacciaguida’s concluding ten lines (and hewill speak only nine more as he leaves the poem in the next canto, vv. 28–36)establish, if not the ars poetica of this poem, then its mode of employingexempla for our moral instruction. This passage has caused no little confusion,especially three elements contained in it. (1) Some commentators seem to assumethat it is only concerned with those in Hell; (2) others think that the poemennobles its subjects (rather than the obverse); and (3) still others objectthat not all the populace of the afterworld seen by Dante may be consideredfamous. The first two problems are easily dealt with, for it is obvious that thepoet means to indicate the famous dead in all three canticles and also that thehonor accrues to the poem (one that eschews the commonplace for theextraordinary) rather than to its subjects. As for the third, one example ofthis complaint will suffice. Singleton (comm. to verse 138) argues that thisclaim cannot be taken as literally true, since there are many “unknowncharacters” found in the cast of the Comedy. “One has only to think,” he says,“of the riff-raff, generally, of the eighth circle of Inferno.” However, thosecrowds of “extras” do not count in Dante’s scheme of things; those who are namedare famous (or were, in Dante’s time at least, better known than they are inours).There is one other problem of literal understanding that is as present today asit has always been, perhaps because it has never been treated, since readers donot see that it is problematic and simply assume that they understand what ismeant. The word cima can mean various things (see the note to Purg. XI.91–93),but here it refers either to mountaintops (as we believe it does) or treetops(as it apparently does for most readers). The general sense is clear enough:Exemplary figures and clear arguments are both required to convince a reader.[return to English [part0014.html#c17-s45-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c17-s45-i]]133–134. [part0014.html#c17-s45-e] The metaphors and similetic comparisons(the poem is a “cry,” equated with the wind; its human subjects, metaphoricallymountain peaks [or, according to not a few, treetops]) now make the poem lofty,that is, “tragic” in its stylistic reach. See the note to vv. 127–129. If therethe author insisted on the comic essence of his work, he now insists equallyvehemently on its tragic (or stylistically lofty) dimension.

If ever there existed a “proof that remains obscure,” that lacunaqualifies.This canto, with its lavish praise of Cangrande, may be thought of as Dante’sfarewell to Verona, written between 1317 and 1318 according to Petrocchi(Petr.1988.2), pp. 335, 337. For the question, still somewhat vexed, of theexact date of Dante’s arrival in Ravenna (we assume soon after he left Verona),see Eugenio Chiarini, “Ravenna,” ED (IV [1973]), pp. 861–64.

[part0014.html#c18-s01-e] This is a more difficult tercet than it mayseem. The standard view in the first commentators is that Cacciaguida wasdelighting in what he had said to his great-great-grandson, while theprotagonist was sharing in that joy. Scartazzini (comm. to verse 1) disentanglesthe tortuous skein of debate over this line, pointing out that the text suggeststhat each of the two participants contemplates different “words.” He offers whathas become the standard modern view: The word verbo must here be understood as atranslation of the Scholastic Latin term verbum (e.g., as defined by ThomasAquinas, ST I, q. 34, a. 1), meaning “concept of the inner mind.” Thus, we atleast may conjecture, Cacciaguida was enjoying his understanding, beyond thesecontingent events, of a higher form of being, in the light of Eternity, whileDante was seeing, sub specie humanitatis, the harmonious relation of his exileto his eventual happiness. This would mark an improvement in his cognition(seeing eventual concord where he was expecting only grief), which, nonetheless,remained limited by his mortal aspirations. To mark the differences in theirlevels of experience, as Torraca (comm. to this tercet) observes, Dante usesvery different verbs: Cacciaguida savors (godeva) completely his inner conceptof deity, while the protagonist has but a first taste (gustava) of his ownhigher awareness. [return to English [part0014.html#c18-s01-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c18-s01-i]]3. [part0014.html#c18-s01-e] Few commentators point out the obvious (but seeat least Carroll [comm. to vv. 1–18]): The third verse reflects Cacciaguida’spromise (Par. XVII.43–45) of an eventual harmonious resolution of the problemsinherent in Dante’s exile. The protagonist is now capable of a larger and widerview of the impending events in his life, knowing that they are a part of thedivine plan, one that includes his writing this text and that corroborates therightness of his political decisions in the greater scheme of things. UnlikeCacciaguida, however, he is not yet capable of seeing essences without theircontingent trappings. [return to English [part0014.html#c18-s01-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c18-s01-i]]5–6. [part0014.html#c18-s02-e] Beatrice, perhaps having tuned in on the innerthoughts of both Cacciaguida and Dante, reminds her charge that God takes awayany sense of loss in earthly circumstances that the saved may feel, according toDante’s current understanding. Once saved, a soul is in patria, not in exile anylonger.Beatrice, who has been uncharacteristically silent in Mars (to make room for thepoet’s “Cacciaguida voice,” which is expansive), now speaks for only the secondtime in this heaven. She has smiled twice (Par. XV.71 and XVI.14) and spokenonce (Par. XVII.7–12); she will speak once more (vv. 20–21), as briefly as shedoes now.

[part0014.html#c18-s03-e] The insistent presence of first-personpronouns and pronominal adjectives in this passage (io is heard four times, therhyming mio, three) is striking. It reminds us that, from the beginning, we havehad to consider the strategic difference between the writing agent and thebehaving protagonist, the first seeing all things in the light of his finalvision of God, the second experiencing them cumulatively.

[part0014.html#c18-s03-e] This passage reflects the earlier one atParadiso I.5–9, which similarly insists on the poet’s incapacity to retell whathe has experienced and forgotten, since his memory was not up to containing somomentous an experience.

[part0014.html#c18-s03-e] The word conforto, used as a noun to describeanother human being (e.g., “that person was my comfort”), has been employedthree times before now (Inf. IV.18; Purg. III.22, IX.43), on each occasionassigned to Virgil; here, for the first (and last) time referring to anyoneelse, it obviously refers to Beatrice.

See the note to Purgatorio XXXI.47–54for a discussion of the verbal noun piacere, denoting the aesthetic aspect ofdivinity. For Aquinas on God’s aesthetic dimension, see ST I, q. 39, a. 8, wherehe argues that “the highest form and paradigm of beauty is the splendor of Godas manifested through Christ, to whom … the name ‘Beauty’ is most fittinglyattributed” (Masciandaro [Masc.1995.1], p. 329).

[part0014.html#c18-s07-e] Beatrice “conquers” Dante’s will bycompelling him to look away from her eyes in order to turn his attention a finaltime to the words of his great-great-grandfather. This is the last smile shewill direct at Dante for quite some time. See the note to Paradiso XXIII.46–48.[return to English [part0014.html#c18-s07-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c18-s07-i]]22–27.

XIV.37–60), returns for an encore. And, likeSolomon’s, his has ramifications for our understanding of the genre of his poem.Solomon’s was a hymn to the Resurrection; his is a piece from a Christianmartial epic. For this last as a Dantean genre, see Hollander (Holl.1989.1),arguing that, after an initial series of rebuffs to martial epic in Inferno,eventually in Paradiso the poet begins to associate himself, throughCacciaguida, with a Christian poetry of crusade, surely a martial subject.[return to English [part0014.html#c18-s10-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c18-s10-i]]29. [part0014.html#c18-s10-e] The image of the tree that is nourished from itstopmost tip, that is, the “tree” of the saved in the Empyrean by God Himself,may reflect, as Battaglia Ricci suggests (Batt.1995.1, p. 11), biblical languagein general or perhaps Matthew 13:22 and/or Ezechiel 47:12.

[part0014.html#c18-s13-e] For Dante’s knowledge of the French traditionof the Neuf preus (Nine Worthies), see Hollander (Holl.1989.1), pp. 83–85,citing Joan Ferrante (Ferr.1984.1), p. 277n., and pointing to the first frontalstudy of Dante’s eclectic treatment of this traditional subject, athen-forthcoming article by Lauren Scancarelli Seem. See also the discussion inPicone (Pico.2002.5), pp. 268–71. Picone rightly notes that Seem’s article(accepted by Forum Italicum around 1989) never appeared. See also BattagliaRicci (Batt.1995.1), pp. 13–14. Trucchi (comm. to vv. 34–36) observes only thatthe exemplary fighters are nine, “a symbolic and perfect number,” but isunaware, as is the entire commentary tradition, of the likely presence of areference to the Nine Worthies. Seem, in her unpublished article, argues thatDante knew the tradition of these nine heroes, three Jewish, three pagan, threeChristian, from either Les Voeux du paon, by Jacques de Longuyon (ca.1298–1309), or from the earlier Latin and French tradition, dating from theeleventh century (with somewhat differing lists of heroes), that Jacques himselfrelied on.The traditional list of the Nove prodi includes five not included in Dante’srevised list (the right-hand column in the two lists below):Joshua[1 in Dante also] DavidRoland [4] Judas Maccabeus[2 in Dante]HectorWilliam of Orange [5] Alexander the GreatRenouard [6] Julius CaesarRobertGuiscard [8] King ArthurCacciaguida [9] Charlemagne[3 in Dante] Godfrey ofBouillon[7 in Dante]It seems clear that Dante is taking a canonical list and recasting it to conformto his special purposes. He includes two of the first three and the last pair ofnames (Joshua, Judas Maccabeus; Charlemagne, Godfrey), dropping the middle four,and then adding five more recent “Christian heroes,” three drawn from fictionaltreatments, sometimes of historical characters (Roland and William of Orange, ifnot Renouard) and two from history itself (Robert Guiscard, Cacciaguida), and“updating” the list, which had ended with Duke Godfrey, leader of the FirstCrusade (1096), by adding last his own ancestor, who had perished, a martyr, inthe second (1147).

[part0014.html#c18-s13-e] This line makes it clear that the protagonisthears the names of the heroes spoken by his ancestor, who thus becomes, for amoment, the “author” of this part of the poem, and thus of a crusading epic. Seethe note to verse 51. However, and as Iorio (Iori.1989.1), p. 474, reminds us,there is not a word about their battles; this text presents them as they are,now and forever, in the sight of God, literally sub specie aeternitatis, withall that violence behind them.

[part0014.html#c18-s14-e] “It was joy that whipped that spinning top”:That is, joy “was the impulse which caused the rotation.

[part0014.html#c18-s16-e] Robert Guiscard (“Robert the Astute”), ahistorical figure (1015–85), was also celebrated in a Latin poem, Gesta RobertiWiscardi. Exactly why Dante wanted to include him in this list is not clear,indeed is the subject of a certain scholarly puzzlement. Further, he violatesthe chronology established by the inclusion of Godfrey before him. Dante haspreviously mentioned him (Inf. XXVIII.13–14) as having defeated the Saracens inPuglia, and that may have been his single largest qualification in the poet’seyes.

[part0014.html#c18-s17-e] The word artista, as Hollander (Holl.1992.2),pp. 217–18, has argued, is perhaps used here for the first time in Italian withits modern sense, that is, not only as the practitioner of one of the liberalarts (in this case, music), but as a full-fledged “artist,” both composer andperformer of his own work, performing his “mini-epic” of nine crusading spirits,his personal version of the Nine Worthies. Its second such use will be inParadiso XXX.33, where Dante will join his great-great-grandfather as one of theonly two “artists” so designated in the Commedia.The musical reference of this canto, its concerns so often expressed in musicalterms, is studied by Heilbronn-Gaines (Heil.1995.2).

[part0014.html#c18-s18-e] The ascent from Mars to Jupiter isaccomplished during the course of a single action (Dante looks into Beatrice’seyes [vv. 52–57]), which is amplified by two similes (vv. 58–63, 64–69). Thefirst combines awareness of the slowness of process with the suddenness of therealization that a change has finally occurred; the second presents a subtlechange (the return of normal complexion) that follows a fairly dramatic event (ablush of modesty in response to some sort of embarrassment) that recedesperceptibly over a brief period. See the note to vv. 64–66. The first similerefers to the ascent from Mars and arrival in Jupiter in spatial terms, whilethe second reflects the colors of the two planets, respectively red and silverywhite. Each refers to a subtle process, occurring over an indeterminate periodof time, that is suddenly perceived as having involved fairly dramatic change.[return to English [part0014.html#c18-s18-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c18-s18-i]]56–57.

[part0014.html#c18-s21-e] Dante has become aware that the segment ofthe ideal circle traversed by his body in each sphere is increasing incircumference the higher he rises, a natural result of his progress up throughthe heavens. [return to English [part0014.html#c18-s21-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c18-s21-i]]64–66. [part0014.html#c18-s22-e] Beginning with Scartazzini (comm. to verse64) and Poletto (comm. to vv. 64–69), some readers have turned to Ovid for asource for this blush in Arachne’s face (Metam. VI.45–49). The scene is atroubling one: Athena appears (first disguised as an old woman) to acceptArachne’s challenge to a contest in weaving. When the goddess reveals herself,the other mortals present show reverence, except for Arachne, whose involuntaryblush is only momentary, and quickly fades, like the red sky at dawn. Picone(Pico.2002.5), p. 272, points out that the figuring element and the thingfigured are reversed in Dante’s use of the passage, reflecting an even moresignificant reversal, from a negative experience (Arachne’s transformation intoa spider) to a positive one (the letter M’s transmutation into a lily and thenan eagle).For some resonances of this Ovidian moment, see, among others, Barolini(Baro.1987.1) and Macfie (Macf.1991.1).

[part0014.html#c18-s24-e] As Poletto (comm. to vv. 70–72) points out, theword facella (from Latin fax, “torch”) has been used once before to mean “star”;see Purgatorio VIII.89.

[part0014.html#c18-s24-e] The phrase nostra favella has caused minordifficulty among those who (rightly) understand the noun usually to refer tovernacular speech and who therefore wonder why Dante uses this term for wordsthat are Latin, and not Italian. The rhyme position obviously forced Dante’shand a little here. Most readers understand, along with Steiner (comm. to thisverse) and, even more pointedly, Momigliano (comm. to vv. 70–72), that we shouldtake the phrase more broadly and as referring to human speech in general.[return to English [part0014.html#c18-s24-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c18-s24-i]]73–78. [part0014.html#c18-s25-e] Poletto (comm. to these verses) seems to havebeen the first to link them to Purgatorio XXIV.64–69. And Benvenuto (comm. tovv. 73–78) the first to see that this image is derived from Lucan (Phars.V.711–716).Picone (Pico.2002.5), p. 274, points out that, while the avian “skywriting”observed by Lucan is aleatory and quickly obliterated, Dante’s is lasting, byvirtue of its inscription here in his pages.

[part0014.html#c18-s25-e] Carroll (comm. to vv. 70–81) succinctly tiestogether the avian imagery that, beginning here, is so present in Jupiter: “Itis to be noted that in this Heaven of the Eagle nearly all the similes are takenfrom bird-life (e.g., in addition to the Eagle and the present passage:XVIII.111, the mysterious reference to nests; XIX.34, the falcon issuing fromits hood; XIX.91, the comparison of the Eagle to the stork hovering over itsyoung; XX.73, the lark pausing, content with ‘the last sweetness’ of its song.See the chap. on ‘The Birds of Dante’ in Christopher Hare’s Dante theWayfarer).” [return to English [part0014.html#c18-s25-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c18-s25-i]]74.

While those earlier “doves,”temporarily seduced by an ode from Dante’s Convivio, failed to distinguishbetween wheat and tares (see the note to Purg. II.124–132), these “cranes” aresinging God’s song to Dante. [return to English [part0014.html#c18-s25-e] /Italian [part0025.html#c18-s25-i]]76. [part0014.html#c18-s26-e] These “holy creatures” (sante creature) willlater (Par. XIX.100–101) be identified as “lucenti incendi / de lo SpiritoSanto” (the Holy Spirit’s fiery lights).

What the Muse is asked to perform, the inspiration of Danteso that he may give long life to cities and kingdoms, might seem to require thatClio, the Muse of history, is called upon here. However, only one commentatoreven mentions her as a possibility (Momigliano [comm. to verse 82]), and he saysonly that the imperial context most fits Calliope or Clio.The words ingegno (Inf. II.7; here; Par. XXII.114) and concetto (Inf. XXXII.4;here; Par. XXXIII.68) are both twice elsewhere present in passages containinginvocations.

There sprang forth Hippocrene, the fountain sacred tothe Muses. Which one of them does the poet invoke here? The most popular choices(given in historical order) are (1) Minerva, “Wisdom,” as a sort of “super muse”(first suggested by Jacopo della Lana [comm. to vv. 82–87]); (2) a nonspecific,“generic” muse (first, Benvenuto [comm. to vv. 82–87]); (3) invoked for thesecond time in the poem (see Purg. I.9), Calliope, the Muse of epic (first,Vellutello [comm. to vv. 82–84], and the “majority candidate”); (4) also invokedfor the second time (see Purg. XXIX.41), Urania, the heavenly Muse (first,Andreoli [comm. to this verse]). This is a vexed question, with four fairlypopular solutions (and a few others, e.g., Euterpe [Torraca, comm. to vv. 82–84]and Clio [Momigliano, comm. to this verse]) and no clear consensus. All one cansay is that the poet really seems to have a particular Muse in mind, since headdresses her with the singular “tu” in verse 87.

[part0014.html#c18-s30-e] Perhaps the single most self-conscious,“artificial” passage in a poem that hardly lacks aesthetic exertion, the sort ofthing Romantic readers, in the wake of De Sanctis and Croce, despise in theCommedia. However, for the view that this sort of calculated performance is asign of the poet’s “bello stile,” see Parodi (Paro.1915.1).

[part0014.html#c18-s30-e] For the poet to have counted his letters(there are 13 different ones in all), 35 instances of vowels (18, with “i”dominant [occurring 10 times]) and consonants (17, with “t” dominant [occurring5 times]), tells us that he was making a point that he considered central to hispurpose.

[part0014.html#c18-s31-e] These seven words (“Love justice, you whojudge the earth”) constitute the opening sentence of the book of the Biblecalled “Sapientia” (Wisdom), attributed, by Dante at least, to Solomon. Thatattribution was a matter of some dispute for Christians, from the early Fatherson (e.g., in a fairly rare moment of concord, both Jerome and Augustine denySolomon paternity [if both err in attributing it to Philo Judaeus]). Fordiscussions of Dante’s knowledge of this text, see G. R. Sarolli, “Salomone” (EDIV [1973]) and the unsigned article (apparently by Alessandro Niccoli),“Sapientia, Libro della” (ED V [1976]). Sarolli shows that Dante, in one of hismany references to the biblical king (Conv. IV.xvi.1), refers, by citing Wisdom6:23, to Solomon as the author of that now-apocryphal book. This passage inParadiso is treated by most (including Sarolli) as the only reference to Wisdomin the Commedia (but see the note to verse 101), if there are two references inthe Epistle to Cangrande (Epist. XIII.6 and XIII.62).For the program of St. Paul’s “five words with understanding” in the poem andits possible relevance here, see Hollander (Holl.1992.1), pp. 39–43.It seems probable that this is the third passage in the poem to involve aphenomenon that might be described as “visible speech,” formally similarexpressions that also prominently involve the idea of justice. This one joinsthe “visible speech” found in the writing over the gate of Hell (Inf. III.1–9)and the words “seen” in the intaglio presenting Trajan and the widow (Purg.X.73–96). See Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 297–300; Pertile (Pert.1991.3), p.38; and Martinelli (Mart.2002.1), p. 283. [return to English[part0014.html#c18-s31-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c18-s31-i]]91. [part0014.html#c18-s31-e] It is not surprising that justice, mostblatantly evident as a guiding concern for this poet in this canto (where it isliterally spelled out in capital letters), has caught the attention of nearlyall who deal with it. Giglio’s lectura (Gigl.1988.1) is little more than ameditation on Dante’s conception of justice. And see Chimenz (Chim.1956.1), p.1735, supporting a definition of the Commedia as a “poem of justice, both humanand divine.” In this vein, see also Scott (Scot. 1996.1), p. 55, citing Dante’sepistle (Epist. XII.7), where he refers to himself as a “preacher of justice”(vir predicans iustitiam).For a consideration of the centrality of justice to Cantos XVIII–XX and to thepoem as a whole, see Took (Took.1997.1). Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 70–99) refersto two earlier passages that reveal Dante’s overwhelming respect for this ideal:“Thus, although every virtue in man is deserving of love, that is most deservingof love in him which is most human, and that is justice” (Conv. I.xii.9, tr. R.Lansing); “… Justice, which disposes us to love and conduct ourselves withrectitude in all things” (Conv. IV.xvii.6, tr. R. Lansing).

[part0014.html#c18-s32-e] Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 94–108) saysthat the “m,” last letter of the word terram, stands for mondo (the world), areading immediately supported by the meaning of the word itself in Wisdom 1:1.He continues by reading the souls making up the letter as being minor publicofficials and private citizens who have in common a love of justice; they willbe the body politic for the emperor, figured in the eagle’s head into which thecentral stem of the letter will eventually be transformed at its top. It hasbecome far more common, but only in the twentieth century, for interpreters toclaim that the letter stands for monarchia. On the other hand, the earlyinterpretation has the virtue of separating the human desire for justice fromits expression in actual imperial rule, which would certainly correspond withDante’s own experience, most of which was of a world that hoped for empire butwas denied its presence. (See the note to vv. 100–108.) [return to English[part0014.html#c18-s32-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c18-s32-i]]95–96.

[part0014.html#c18-s33-e] Other souls, descending (from where we arenot told, but it is difficult to imagine from anywhere else but the Empyrean),not those who had paused in their “skywriting,” appear to make a “cap” on themidpoint of the top of the “m,” which then resembles (as we learn in verse 113)a lily, as well as a capital “M” in Gothic script.

[part0014.html#c18-s34-e] The simile accounts for the rising of thesouls (probably from the second group alone [i.e., that which had just formedthe cap] and not from both groups, as some would understand) to represent thehead and neck of an eagle. That physical detail remains a matter in question(i.e., whether the souls forming the eagle derived only from the new group orfrom both). Also a cause for debate is the more important question of what thethree embodiments of the “m” represent. There are many solutions proposed. Themore plausible explanations limit the possible choices to the following: (1)whether the “m” stands for monarchia or mondo, (2) whether the “M” (as lily)stands for France or Florence (its two most widely known identities), (3)whether the “M” (as eagle) stands for Christ or the empire. While arguments canand have been made for all these interpretations (and more), and in varyingcombinations, it does seem plausible to hold that the first image indicates the“world” of would-be imperial citizens, while the third indicates the empire onceit is established (e.g., as Dante knew it briefly under Henry VII, 1310–13, andhoped to know it again). As for the second stage in the transformation (the mostdifficult to interpret—if no element of this puzzle is easily resolved), thosewho argue that it indicates the ideal primitive Florence (i.e., as Cacciaguidahas described it in Par. XVI), a template for the civic virtues necessary todevelop a populace capable of being led to empire, are most in accord with whatwe know of Dante’s predilections in these matters.

[part0014.html#c18-s35-e] This Sun is God and these arriving souls sing,apparently, of their desire to return to Him.

[part0014.html#c18-s37-e] Just as birds need no exemplar to designtheir nests, but follow some inner imprinting, so God needs no “model” for hiscreating. This simple paraphrase of the tercet would have come as a greatsurprise to almost all who either avoided dealing with it or who labored over itin order to find something “more profound” in it. Indeed, its first clearstatement had to await Brunone Bianchi (comm. to this tercet) in 1868. However,it is perhaps prudent to observe that the main opposing argument (there areseveral to choose from) has it that not the nests but the creatures within them,referred to by synecdoche, are portrayed as developing in accord with theirarchetypal form. And this just may be what Dante had in mind.It was Grandgent (comm. to this tercet) who was perhaps the first to point toThomas Aquinas for a potential source (ST I, q. 19, a. 4). Perhaps still closeris the reference put forward by Becker (Beck.1988.1) to Thomas’s Quaestionesdisputatae de veritate, XXIV, a. 1, resp. 3, which has it that “all swallowsbuild their nests in the same way.” [return to English [part0014.html#c18-s37-e]/ Italian [part0025.html#c18-s37-i]]112–114. [part0014.html#c18-s38-e] The rest of the spirits who had at firstseemed to be content to make up the “enlilying” cap of the “M” now fill out theEagle’s shape (his wings?). This detail would argue against those who claim thatsome of the first group are drawn up into this further design. It would seemrather that they stay in the original “m.” See the note to vv. 100–108.

Picone(Pico.2002.5), pp. 277–78, argues effectively for the fugitive vision that Dantehas of the “M” as lily being the representation of the civic principles ofFlorence of the “buon tempo antico” as being consistent with the restoration ofRoman imperial virtue in the city. Fumagalli (Fuma.2005.1) attempts toresuscitate the “French connection,” arguing that the passage (vv. 88–114)presents St. Louis (King Louis IX of France) in a better light than iscustomarily perceived. He admits that Fenzi (Fenz.2004.1) has offered a strongargument against such a view, but presents it anyway. [return to English[part0014.html#c18-s38-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c18-s38-i]]115–117. [part0014.html#c18-s39-e] The first of the apostrophes with whichthis canto concludes is addressed (as will be the second) to the positive forcesin God’s universal plan, first the tempering planet, just Jupiter. This tercetoffers a clear example of Dante’s belief in astral influence on earthlybehaviors, with Jupiter conceived as the heavenly shaper of human embodiments ofjustice. See Paradiso VIII.97–99 and VIII.122–126 and the appended notes.Lenkeith’s chapter “Jupiter and Justice” (Lenk.1952.1, pp. 73–131) concludeswith a citation of this tercet. She offers an evaluation of Dante’s debt toCicero’s Stoic statecraft (with which the poet is in accord except for a totaldisavowal of its Godless theory of politics) and his total disagreement withAugustine’s theologically determined rejection of the state’s ability to haveanything to do with “real justice” altogether. [return to English[part0014.html#c18-s39-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c18-s39-i]]118–136. [part0014.html#c18-s40-e] The reader can hardly fail to notice thesudden and sustained shift in the tense of the verbs (from past definite inverse 116) to present, some eighteen verbs in all, from prego (I pray [118]) toconosco (I know [136]). The most dramatic is perhaps the resurrective “arealive” (son vivi) for Saints Peter and Paul in verse 132. But the ostensiblereason for the shift in tenses is clear: Dante looks up from composing his textto see again the souls he had previously seen in this sphere (we will meet themonly in Par. XX), first among them David, those of just rulers, to pray fortheir intervention with God to alleviate the civic distress of all on earth whohave been led astray by corrupt clergy, presided over by a corrupt pope. Forreasons to believe that Dante here is thinking specifically of the papacy andparticularly of Pope John XXII, see the note to verse 130. [return to English[part0014.html#c18-s40-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c18-s40-i]]118–123. [part0014.html#c18-s40-e] Now the poet turns his attention from thisplanetary home of justice, where he was suspended, to God the Father, who is thesource of the justice that Jupiter rays down to earth, and prays that He willobserve the “smoke” that extinguishes those just rays before they reach ourworld and will feel wrath at the offenders. [return to English[part0014.html#c18-s40-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c18-s40-i]]122–124. [part0014.html#c18-s41-e] Each of these three verses is constructedfrom a different verse of the Bible. For the commerce in the temple, see Matthew21:12; for the bloody cost of building the Church out of sacrifice andmartyrdom, see Acts 20:28; for the heavenly militia, see Luke 2:13.

[part0014.html#c18-s42-e] The second of the three concluding apostrophesis addressed to the souls of the just rulers, whom he contemplates, as he writesthese words, in the Empyrean. Nowhere in this passage does the poet rise to ahigher pitch of blissful contemplation than here, where he even now “holds inmind” those whom he has previously seen in this heaven. See the note to vv.118–136. [return to English [part0014.html#c18-s42-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c18-s42-i]]126. [part0014.html#c18-s42-e] Surely Dante does not mean that all on earthare misled by corrupt prelates; his negative enthusiasm runs away with him. Buthe clearly does mean to indicate the population of Italy (and of others as well)that is misgoverned by the Church.

[part0014.html#c18-s43-e] The “bread” that God the Father bars tonone is generally understood as the sacraments of the Church, and in thisinstance most particularly the sacrament of the Eucharist.Since it is the Church that “makes war” by denying the sacrament of communion(an inevitable consequence of excommunication), in a better age the Church (andnot, as some commentators believe, ancient Roman warriors) must have been braveon the field of battle. Exactly what Dante means by this is perhaps as puzzlingas the commentaries have allowed it to become. However, in this very canto wehave heard about those worthies who battled against the soldiery of Mohammed inorder to regain the Holy Land, the Crusaders. Is this an approving recollectionof the Crusades? No commentator apparently thinks so, but that fact in itselfseems surprising. (Commentators who do attempt to identify the objects of theseChristian weapons are content with a general sense, heretics and/or pagans.)[return to English [part0014.html#c18-s43-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c18-s43-i]]130–136. [part0014.html#c18-s44-e] The third and final apostrophe is hurled atthe sitting pope, and perhaps explains Dante’s reasons for shifting out of thenormal “time zone” of the poem to a “now” in which Pope John XXII is very muchalive. See the note to verse 130.The rhythmn of the three apostrophes is noteworthy, the first two addressed tothe temporary inhabitants of Jupiter and the permanent residents of the Empyrean(O dolce stella, … O milizia del ciel), lofty in tone; the last, brutallypersonal and in the casual intonation not far removed from that of the gutter(Ma tu …). This conclusion of the canto is meant to be scabrous, because it isconcerned with scabrous deeds, the repeated selling of Christ for personal gain.These verses offer what may be considered an appendix to Inferno XIX (where wefirst met simoniac popes) in which we hear the sitting pontiff, his words lenthim by the acid-tongued Signor Alighieri, sounding like a mobster in TheGodfather or The Sopranos, speak of his dead “buddies,” one who was killed (Johnthe Baptist, whose image, of course, adorns the florin) so that a politicalfunctionary could watch a striptease performed by his stepdaughter, and anothertwo (whom we heard rightly named in the poet’s voice just now, Peter and Paul)disparagingly referred to as a fisherman and “Paulie”—to whom he greatly prefersthe florin.

[part0014.html#c18-s44-e] A probable reference to Pope John XXII, whoacceded to the Holy See in 1316 (he would survive in it for thirteen years pastDante’s death, until 1334). John was not only French, but he decided to keep theChurch in France, in its Avignonian “captivity,” thus managing to draw Dante’sire. It has seemed to some that this diatribe against papal use ofexcommunication for political purpose is grounded in John’s excommunication ofthe imperial vicar Cangrande in 1317.The last pope who had a speaking part in the poem was Adrian V, on his way toParadise, addressed by the protagonist with the honorific voi (Purg. XIX.131).Now, in the poem called Paradiso, we hear the protagonist speak to the sittingpope, using the familiar tu, in the most disparaging terms and tone of voice.[return to English [part0014.html#c18-s44-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c18-s44-i]]131–132. [part0014.html#c18-s44-e] Dante’s threat to Pope John is advanced intwo lines hinged on the past tense of the verb “to die” (moriro[no]) andculminating in the triumphant assertion that the first keepers of the vineyardof the Church, who gave their lives for it as martyrs, are indeed alive (vivi).Peter and Paul (and John the Baptist, as we shall shortly hear), for the popeand his cofunctionaries, are dead indeed; but not for believers like Dante.[return to English [part0014.html#c18-s44-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c18-s44-i]]PARADISO XIX [part0014.html#c19-e]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1–6. [part0014.html#c19-s01-e] The Eagle is first seen as a discrete entity(la bella image) and then as its components, the individual just rulers whoconstitute this beautiful image of justice, each appearing as a much-prizedprecious stone, the ruby. The text goes on to suggest that all of them wereglowing as though the sun were equally reflected in all of them at once(something that would not happen in earthbound optics, where uneven surfacesreflect a distant light variously). In fact, these “rubies,” red with the glowof caritas, are shining with their own light of affection, if that is eventuallya reflection of God’s love for them.Dante’s radical (and revolutionary, at least from an Augustinian point of view)notion is that earthly justice is the direct product of a divine principle. And,as we learned in the last canto (see the note to Par. XVIII.115–117), the soulsof the shapers of those human institutions that serve justice are themselvesshaped by the agency of this heaven.

[part0014.html#c19-s01-e] The image of the Eagle, with its open wings,suggests, to Baranski (Bara.1995.4), p. 277, a passage from Deuteronomy 32:11,“expandit alas suas” (spreading out its wings), in the song about himself thatMoses intones near the end of his life, in which he is presented as an eagletaking his chicks upon his back for an exodal ride.

[part0014.html#c19-s03-e] What Dante must now report was never reportedby voice, nor written in ink, nor present in the image-receiving faculty of themind, for he had seen the beak speak and had heard it, too, when it uttered withits voice “I” and “mine,” while in its conception it meant “we” and “our.” Wehave had a similar experience once before, hearing Dante introduce himself as“we” and then speak as “I” in the first two lines of the poem (Inf. I.1–2): “Nelmezzo del cammin di nostra vita / mi ritrovai per una selva oscura.…”St. Paul describes similar marvelous truths (I Corinthians 2:9) that “the eyehas not seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined,” an observationdating back to Jacopo della Lana (proem to this canto).

Thecontext is the fourth angelic trumpet blast, and the eagle is announcing woe tothose who dwell on earth. Dante’s Eagle, on the other hand, has a more eupepticmessage.It seems clear that Geoffrey Chaucer was amused when he read this verse; hisloquacious eagle in that delightful send-up of Dante’s poem, The House of Fame,surely was one poet’s laughing salute to another.

[part0014.html#c19-s05-e] These verses were initially and widelyinterpreted to refer to that glory (salvation) that is greater than any desirefor it. Scartazzini (comm. to verse 15), however, cites Bartolomeo Perazzini(Note alla “Divina Commedia” [Venice, 1844], p. 155), who says that the heavenlyglory won by these souls, even more than did their desire, reflected (andrewarded) their deeds. Given the context of their virtuous acts as rulers, thisinterpretation has won support ever since it was presented by Scartazzini andCampi (comm. to vv. 13–15). Nonetheless, there is still no consensus, withvarious commentators advancing the one or the other explanation. Here is Carroll(comm. to vv. 1–18), summarizing the debate before attempting to find a way out:“Two interpretations are suggested: (1) that this glory of Jupiter is superiorto all human desire; (2) that it does not allow itself to be won by meredesire—it must be worked for (Matth. 7:21). I venture to suggest a third: thecommon way in which kings aim at glory is at their own ‘desire’ or ambition, andearthly glory may be so won.

[part0014.html#c19-s06-e] We may need to remind ourselves that theEagle is speaking as a corporate entity, his “I” really meaning “we,” that is,the virtuous rulers composing his shape have all left exemplary lives behindthem that draw lip service but no imitative good actions.

[part0014.html#c19-s06-e] The commentators, from Benvenuto (comm. to vv.16–18) onward, generally take storia here in the sense of exemplum, that is,according to the fourteenth-century Dantist, the wicked on the earth do notfollow the positive examples of these virtuous rulers, present here in theEagle, of whom we shall see some in the next canto.

[part0014.html#c19-s07-e] The simile pounds home the poet’s insistencethat the plurality of souls making up the Eagle’s unity sing as a single voice.[return to English [part0014.html#c19-s07-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c19-s07-i]]22–24. [part0014.html#c19-s08-e] The protagonist himself, as it were, picks upthe theme of the simile only to express it in metaphor: He believes that thesesouls have become a garden of flowers giving off a single perfume, that is,speaking as one. [return to English [part0014.html#c19-s08-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c19-s08-i]]25–33. [part0014.html#c19-s09-e] We probably are reminded of the presence inLimbo of the virtuous pagans (unauthorized by previous authority, e.g., St.Thomas, who denies them a place alongside the only inhabitants of the “orthodox”Limbus, the innocent but unbaptized infants [see the note to Inf. IV.30]). Itwas clear from that earlier passage that our poet had a problem with traditionalChristian views of the “guilt” of otherwise morally good (or even excellent)human beings. The last words of his request to the souls in the Eagle make itplain that in his life he had been bothered by the Church’s teaching on thepostmortal situation of the virtuous heathen.

[part0014.html#c19-s09-e] The gerund (perhaps used here as a presentparticiple) spirando (breathing forth) is a form of the verb (spirare) thatDante uses to indicate the “spiration” of the Holy Spirit. For confirmation ofthis association, see verse 101. [return to English [part0014.html#c19-s09-e] /Italian [part0025.html#c19-s09-i]]28–30. [part0014.html#c19-s10-e] The poet here refers, as Tommaseo (comm. tothis tercet) was apparently the first commentator to point out, to Cunizza’swords in Paradiso IX.61–62, from which he has learned that the angelic order ofThrones, presiding over the heaven of Saturn, is designated as reflecting divinejustice. But this does not mean that these just souls here in Jupiter areinnocent of such knowledge, since they know about earthly justice and, further,like all the saved, see the higher form reflected in God Himself.

This one shows a tamed falcon being prepared to gooff on a hunt for prey, while the next, at vv. 91–96, completes the implicitlyjoined image with a stork that has fed its young.For six other references to falconry in the poem, see Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv.34–36).

[part0014.html#c19-s14-e] The following is Tozer’s paraphrase of theselines: “God, who created all things, infinitely surpasses in Himself the wisdomwhich appears in His creation (ll. 40–45). Lucifer, the highest of createdbeings, fell, because he lacked as yet the light which would have enabled him tosee God perfectly (ll. 46–48). How much more feeble must be the vision of beingsinferior to him! (ll. 49–51). Hence our minds cannot have any true conception ofGod’s attributes (ll. 52–57), and, in particular, of His justice (ll. 58–63).”[return to English [part0014.html#c19-s14-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c19-s14-i]]40. [part0014.html#c19-s14-e] For the image of the compass in God’s designingof the universe, see Proverbs 8:27, as was perhaps first noted by Tommaseo(comm. to vv. 40–42).

[part0014.html#c19-s16-e] Lucifer’s fall (and that of the otherrebellious angels) will have an entire passage to itself for Beatrice’selucidation in Paradiso XXIX.49–66. For Adam’s contrasting “ripeness,” seeParadiso XXVI.91. The poet might seem to suggest that Lucifer did not awaitGod’s finishing His creation of him, which would have made him “perfect” withthe light of grace.

[part0014.html#c19-s23-e] Marked by two Latinisms used as rhymes(latebra, “hiding-place”; crebra, “frequent”), this tercet marks the Eagle’sfinally coming to grips with Dante’s insistent question about the justice of thecondemnation of pagans who had apparently committed no positive sin.

[part0014.html#c19-s23-e] The poet, allowing the Eagle to do so for him,insists once again that his life has been marked by a sort of prehumanist zealto defend the pagans from unfair Christian treatment. But see the note to vv.88–90. [return to English [part0014.html#c19-s23-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c19-s23-i]]70–78. [part0014.html#c19-s24-e] This passage gives the fullest and mostaffecting version of this question, one that was directed at, as we have seen,perhaps the single most troubling aspect of Christian orthodoxy for Dante. Thelanguage, if indirectly, revisits a scene from Purgatorio (XXI.7–13), theappearance of Statius, himself led to salvation by Virgil, represented so as tobe reminiscent of Jesus, resurrected, appearing to Cleopas and his wife. SeeLuke 24:19, a description of Jesus given by Cleopas (to Jesus Himself, whom hedid not at first recognize), “vir propheta potens in opere et sermone” (aprophet mighty in deed and word), perhaps first cited by Tommaseo (comm. to vv.73–75). In Purgatorio XXI.17–18, Virgil, hoping Statius will soon enjoy thefruits of salvation, refers to his own situation, condemned by “the unerringcourt / that confines me in eternal exile,” with full acceptance of his guilt inGod’s eyes. It is difficult to read the passage at hand and not think of Virgil.Once we encounter some of the virtuous pagans who were saved in the next canto,it will once more be difficult not to think of him. [return to English[part0014.html#c19-s24-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c19-s24-i]]70–72. [part0014.html#c19-s24-e] For a meditation on the challenge to Dante’sclaim to universality presented by those dwelling beyond the Indus (i.e., inIndia or even farther to the east), see Schildgen (Schi.1993.1).

[part0014.html#c19-s27-e] Up until now we have probably beensympathizing with the protagonist’s unwillingness to embrace the justice thatwould condemn such an essentially admirable human being who, through no fault ofhis own, has not heard the Word. Suddenly the Eagle pounces on Dante (his “tu”is most personal, where in most of the rest of his long speech [vv. 40–90], withthe exception of five other second-person singular pronouns or verbs within fourlines, 67–70, he seems to be thinking of all mortals, three times addressing usas “voi”). “Who are you, Dante, to judge God’s judgment?” Further (and now theEagle resorts to third-person attack, Dante being offhandedly treated as acaviling subtilizer), is he not aware of what the Bible says? See the discussionof Romans 9:20 in the note to vv. 79–81. [return to English[part0014.html#c19-s27-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c19-s27-i]]79–81. [part0014.html#c19-s27-e] As a biblical source for this tercet, Venturi(comm. to verse 79) adduces the Pauline formula (Romans 9:20) that will havemost currency among later commentators: “o homo tu quis es qui respondeas Deo?”(But who are you, O man, that you answer back to God? [Is this the source of theEagle’s “tu”?]) Tommaseo adds a reference to Dante himself speaking in this vein(Conv. IV.v.9).For the notion that this is the most important tercet of the canto, see Scrivano(Scri.1995.1), p. 29. [return to English [part0014.html#c19-s27-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c19-s27-i]]81.

[part0014.html#c19-s30-e] All that is just in the world accords withGod’s will; on the other hand, no created good draws God’s will to itself; itsgoodness is the manifestation of that will, not its cause. Scartazzini/Vandelli(comm. to this tercet) point to Dante’s similar phrasing in Monarchia II.ii.5, apassage that, in turn, may reflect the concept of God’s inability to be unjustin Romans 9:14–15.Having set himself up as a “liberal” on the question of the eternal punishmentof virtuous pagans, Dante now embraces the “conservative” position, which has itthat pagans are justly damned for not having intuited the truth of Christ. Hewill play this hand out again in the next canto, where he will see saved pagans(their presence in Heaven surely reflects a “liberal” mind-set), but willcontrive to convince us (and himself?) that they had somehow found Christ. As wewill see, moral perfection alone will not procure the most just among pagans aplace in Heaven, this poet’s Christian pantheon.

[part0014.html#c19-s33-e] Just as the second avian simile completed thefirst one (see the notes to vv. 34–39 and 91–96), so this second simile,pronounced by the Eagle itself, completes the pattern established by the firstsimile. There (vv. 19–21), many were resolved as one (many embers sensed as asingle heat, many affectionate voices heard as a single song); here celestialharmony is not audible to human ears, which can hear only the individual voicesand cannot make sense of them. See Inferno XX.29–30 for a similar insistence onthe necessary failure of humans to understand God’s justice. [return to English[part0014.html#c19-s33-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c19-s33-i]]101–102. [part0014.html#c19-s34-e] This formulation might help clarify anissue that confuses some readers. The Eagle is not so much a symbol of Romanimperium as it is of God’s justice made apparent in this world in whateverembodiment it should happen to take. [return to English[part0014.html#c19-s34-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c19-s34-i]]103–105. [part0014.html#c19-s35-e] The Eagle’s words are pellucidly clear;nevertheless, some readers contrive not to understand them. Salvation withoutbelief in Christ is simply not possible. We should tuck this notice away inorder to reexamine it in the light of the salvation of both Trajan and Ripheusin the next canto; in the light of this absolute qualification, their salvationsseem dubious, at the very least.For an excursus (in English) on the concept of implicit faith, which alone canmake a bit more understandable Dante’s unshakable embrace of the Church’s firmruling in this matter, see Carroll (comm. to vv. 79–84).

[part0014.html#c19-s36-e] Mowbray Allan (Alla.1993.1) restates andwidens some of his earlier conclusions about the poem’s openness to thepossibility of Virgil’s salvation. He reads this tercet as promising more thanDante probably intends. The text states only that, after the Judgment, some ofthese failed Christians will be still farther from God than certain pagans. Thatstatement probably should not be interpreted as arguing for the possibleeventual salvation of Virgil (or other pagans). They are already nearer God, inthe Limbus (see Baranski [Bara.1995.4], p. 292, making this point), than most ofthe damned, who are predominantly (at least nominally) Christians. There isnothing here that requires us to think that Dante thinks that God will changehis mind about Virgil—although of course He has the ability to do exactly thatshould He choose. The evidence of the text, however, does not in any way suggestthat Dante thought that He would. For example, Virgil is allowed to describe hisplace in Limbo as eternal (Purg. XXI.18), not something the poet would have putin his mouth were he to have disagreed, as is (or ought to be) abundantly clear.[return to English [part0014.html#c19-s36-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c19-s36-i]]109–114. [part0014.html#c19-s37-e] In response to this passage, perhapsVenturi (comm. to this verse) was the first commentator to cite the followingpertinent text in Matthew (12:41–42): “The men of Nineveh will rise up at thejudgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preachingof Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here. The queen of the South willrise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came fromthe ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater thanSolomon is here.” [return to English [part0014.html#c19-s37-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c19-s37-i]]110. [part0014.html#c19-s37-e] This verse has been a stumbling block for somereaders. The clause “when the two assemblies go their separate ways” almostcertainly does not mean, as some have taken it to do, that the Ethiopians shalldepart from the wicked Christians and go to Heaven. Rather, it signifies thatwhen the sheep (the saved “soldiery of Heaven”) are separated from the goats(both decent Ethiopian nonbelievers and sinful Christians), these virtuousheathen will (justly) castigate their Christian counterparts, who were given thekey to Heaven and chose not even to try to unlock its gates.

[part0014.html#c19-s38-e] The word “kings” sets up the acrostic with itslist of those rotten rulers that fills the rest of the canto. [return to English[part0014.html#c19-s38-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c19-s38-i]]113. [part0014.html#c19-s38-e] The noun volume was first used, we mayremember, to indicate Virgil’s Aeneid (see Inf. 1.84 and note). Of its nineoccurrences in the poem (see Hollander [Holl.1969.1], pp. 78–79, unaccountablymentioning only seven of these, omitting the two occurrences found at Par.XXIII.112 and XXVI.119), only this one refers more or less directly to theBible, more precisely, to the Apocalypse (20:12), as was first pointed out inspecific terms by Pietro Alighieri ([Pietro1] comm. to vv. 112–114). These twouses do not make Virgil’s book a Christian book by association; rather, theyunderline the tragic distance separating Virgil from salvation. The biblicaltext refers to the Book of Life, in which are recorded the names of the saved,and other unnamed “Books of the Dead” (see discussion of Inf. XXIX.57 inHollander [Holl.1982.1]): “And I saw the dead, great and small, standing beforethe throne, and the books were opened. Then another book was opened, which isthe book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books,according to what they had done.” It is more than sufficiently clear that Danteis here referring not to the “good” book in Revelation 20:12, but to the “bad”one(s).

[part0014.html#c19-s38-e] That the word dispregio (here translated“infamy”) has already been seen at Inferno VIII.51 has been noted in thecommentaries at least since the appearance of Poletto’s (1894, to vv. 112–114).This is its seventh and last appearance in the poem, in one form or another.[return to English [part0014.html#c19-s38-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c19-s38-i]]115–139. [part0014.html#c19-s39-e] Dante’s second (and last) full-scaleacrostic in the poem (for the first, see the note to Purgatorio XII.25–63).There can be little doubt but that this one, too, is a deliberate contrivance,whatever the strength of the feelings one happens to harbor against suchliterary behavior. Three sets of three consecutive tercets begin with the sameletter, L, V, and E, respectively, thus spelling the word lue, or “plague.”However, even such astute readers as Bosco and Reggio (comm. to verse 115) seemto want to join Savi-Lopez (BSDI 10 [1903], p. 328) in thinking Dante’s LVE theresult of mere chance. While that seems extreme, at the other end of extremitywe find Taylor (Tayl.1987.1), who wants to extend the acrostic by adding the “i”and “emme” of its central tercet (vv. 128–129) so as to get the scrambled word“lueim,” an anagram for umile (humble). For her more than questionable procedurein so doing, see Barolini’s complaint (Baro.1992.1), pp. 309–10. Barolini (pp.308–9) also dismisses three other “discoverers” of “acrostics” elsewhere in thepoem. However, see Allegretti (Alle.2004.2) for a study of yet another (andhitherto unobserved) acrostic in Dante’s poetic response to Giovanni delVirgilio’s invitation to compose a pastoral eclogue.

[part0014.html#c19-s39-e] Lì, here and in the next two tercets, means“in that volume,” that is, in the “Book of the Dead.” Albert (emperor from1298–1308, i.e., in precedence of Henry VII), was previously denounced by Dantefor his neglect of Italy (Purg. VI.97–126). In 1304 he invaded and devastatedBohemia. In the assemblage of fifteen crowned heads appearing here, Albert isthe only one to be named, thus giving us a sense of how much knowledge of“current events” Dante believed he could count on in his readers.

[part0014.html#c19-s40-e] For Philip’s monetarist failings, see Oelsner(comm. to vv. 119–120): “[the king] debased the coinage to one-third of itsvalue, in order to meet the expenses of his Flemish campaigns in 1302. This isone of several passages in which we see the horror of tampering with the coinageentertained by Dante, the citizen of the greatest commercial city of Europe. Asthe symbol of greed the Florin was the ‘accursed flower’ of Par. IX.130, but asthe foundation of all commercial relations it was worthy of such reverence thathe who tampered with it was to be ranked with him who falsified the verypersonality of human beings, the ultimate basis of human intercourse.” Toynbee(“Filippo2”) points out that Philip is always named by periphrasis in the poem,never by his name, and lists his other main periphrastic appearances: InfernoXIX.87; Purgatorio VII.109, XX.91.

[part0014.html#c19-s40-e] This mention of the death of the French kingdates the canto as having been composed (or, at least, modified) after November1314, according to Campi (comm. to vv. 118–120); see also Foster (Fost.1976.1),p. 85. The Ottimo (comm. to vv. 118–120), writing in 1333, knew about the deathof Philip the Fair, caused by a boar. (The word cotenna, in Tuscany, meant thehide of a wild pig and perhaps, in Dante’s day [as nineteenth-centurycommentators report, even then on the tongues of peasants in the Romagna],referred to the whole dangerous animal.) Lombardi (comm. to this verse) explainswhat happened (citing Villani [Cron. IX.66]): A boar ran among the legs ofPhilip’s horse and the frightened animal threw his royal rider, killing him.[return to English [part0014.html#c19-s40-e] / Italian[part0025.html#c19-s40-i]]121–123. [part0014.html#c19-s41-e] “The pride that makes men thirst” isevidently the craving to dominate. Dante is probably referring to the borderwars between Scotland and England in the reign of Edward I (1272–1307). However,just which monarch Dante has in mind is debated. Since the poet had previouslypraised Edward I (Purg. VII.130–132), some readers have suggested that Dante wasthinking of Edward II, even if he ruled at a period that places him outside thelimits established for everyone else mentioned in this list (i.e., to have beengoverning in 1300). Thus it probably seems necessary to believe one of twothings: Either Dante had received information that made him change his mindabout Edward I, or else he had incorrect dates for Edward II. The Scottishleader referred to is perhaps Robert the Bruce (1306–29). That would put himalso outside the allotted time zone. However, as Tozer points out (comm. to thistercet), since Villani (Cron. VIII.90) represents him as the Scottish leaderduring Edward I’s reign, Dante may have fallen into the same error.

Tozer (comm. to vv. 127–129) paraphrasesand comments: “His virtues will be seen marked by a unit (I), his vices by an M(for Lat. mille, ‘a thousand’). The one virtue here intended was liberality,which Dante attributes to him in Paradiso VIII.82.” Steiner (comm. to vv.128–130) says that others have suggested that “I” and “M” refer to the first andlast letters of his desired and fraudulent title, “King of Ierusalem.” [returnto English [part0014.html#c19-s43-e] / Italian [part0025.html#c19-s43-i]]130–132.

Sicily is referred to as “the isle of fire” because of thevolcanic activity of Mt. Etna. For the death of Anchises on its western shore,see Virgil (Aen. III.707–710).

[part0014.html#c19-s45-e] Frederick is the only one of thepestilential dozen to receive more than a single tercet for his dispraises. Witha wry sense of humor, Dante claims that Frederick is unworthy of attention, yethe gives Frederick’s unworthiness more space than any of his competitors inmalfeasance. Tozer paraphrases the tercet as follows and then comments: “ ‘Inorder to let men know how paltry he is, that which is written against him willtake the form of abbreviations, which will enumerate many vices within a smallspace.’ Abbreviations were commonly used in MSS. to save space; so they would beused in God’s record of Frederic, because he was too insignificant for a largespace to be allotted to him.” [return to English [part0014.html#c19-s45-e] /Italian [part0025.html#c19-s45-i]]137–138.

[part0015.html#c20-s01-e] Any aesthetic performance is likely, atmoments, to leave its observer wondering as to the motives of the performer. Forexample, here one might inquire why Dante did not decide to make this alreadyhighly wrought passage a perfectly turned simile. It has all the requisiteelements, lacking only the initial Come (Just as) and the pivotal così (so) atthe beginning of the seventh verse. With regard to the classical simile, italmost seems as though he had decided to ring the changes on an established formas frequently as he could. See the notes to Purgatorio XXVII.76–87; ParadisoXIV.19–24 and XIV.118–123.The Eagle has stopped speaking as a corporate entity. That allows the individualvoices of this particular collective of the saved to speak as themselves. Hadtheir actual words been recorded here, it probably would have been clear, as itis when they speak as themselves at the end of the canto, that their descriptorfor themselves is “we” (verse 134) and not “I” (verse 31). In simile, they arelike the shining of the stars after the sun has left the sky (in Dante’s furthercomparison, once the Eagle’s beak has gone silent).

[part0015.html#c20-s02-e] According to Dante’s astronomy, stars did notglow with their own energy, but derived their light from the Sun (see Conv.III.xii.7): “… il sole. Lo quale di sensibile luce sé prima e poi tutte lecorpora celestiali e [le] elementali allumina” (the Sun, which illuminates withperceptible light first itself and then all the celestial and elemental bodies[tr.

[part0015.html#c20-s05-e] The poet apostrophizes the love emanatingfrom these spirits, wreathed in “smiles”: How ardent did this love appear inthose “pipes” (or in those “flames” [there is much debate in the commentariesover this choice]) that were so full of holy thoughts! As Bosco/Reggio (comm. toverse 14) point out, the word flaillo is an absolute hapax, meaning that this isits unique appearance, not only in the Commedia, not only in all the works ofDante, but in the history of the Italian language. In their opinion, there is noway to decide between the two possible meanings, “flute” (see French flavel) or“flame” (from O Fr. flael), since both find resonance in the surroundingcontext. However, Benvenuto states unambiguously that the reference is to sound.And his opinion is given further weight by the musical reference of the similein vv. 22–27.

Thistercet marks the beginning of the first of the two central elements of thecanto, a presentation of the souls that make up the eye of the Eagle (vv.16–78); the second, the Eagle’s explanation of the presence in Paradise of thosewho certainly appear to be pagans, runs through vv. 79–129.

The passage in Virgil’s epic describes the rumor ofthe many voices of the native Italians being quieted by King Latinus’s voiceddecision to make peace with the invading future Romans. Chiarenza (Chia.1995.3),p. 302, makes the point that this decision is thus in accord “with theunchangeable will of Providence.” [return to English [part0015.html#c20-s07-e] /Italian [part0026.html#c20-s07-i]]22–29. [part0015.html#c20-s08-e] This double simile, reflecting the fingeringof two kinds of musical instruments in order to produce varying sounds (alongthe neck of a lute or at the vents of a bagpipe), describes the sound producedfrom within the Eagle’s neck, eventually issuing from his beak as a series ofnotes (or words).Landino (comm. to vv. 25–29) expresses his admiration for Dante’s ability,plainly visible here, to “make the impossible seem believable” and compares himto Ovid in this respect.

[part0015.html#c20-s12-e] The Eagle now reports that the souls thatform its eye (we only see one of the two, if it in fact happens to possess morein the way of orbs of sight than its profiled appearance as the emblem of empirerequires—a dubious eventuality) are the greatest among the many that give itsform an aquiline shape.

[part0015.html#c20-s13-e] The Eagle’s thirty-six verses in sixsegments, each of six lines, and each involving use of anaphora (the phrase oraconosce), identify the six “chiefs” of justice: David, Trajan, Hezekiah,Constantine, William the Good, and Ripheus (their fame is at first insisted onwhen the first four of them are named only by circumlocution; the last twounderstandably require more assistance). It seems possible that the poet wantedus to reflect that the thirty-six lines in praise of these half dozen deadrulers mirror, if adversely, the twenty-seven verses, also marked by anaphora,describing the dozen defective living rulers in the preceding canto, ParadisoXIX.115–141.The number of these just rulers (six) may also be meant to put us in mind of thesix “world-historical” emperors presented in Paradiso VI: Julius Caesar,Augustus, Tiberius, Titus, Justinian, and Charlemagne. Those seemed to have beensignificant primarily for the events over which they presided; these, for theirpersonal justness. That distinction may or may not explain their appearing here(only temporarily, we at times may struggle to remember) in a higher heaven.Dante never gives us the grounds on which to establish the relative advancementof the blessed in the Empyrean, except for the eighteen souls whom we areallowed to see in Paradiso XXXII; and none of these saved rulers is seen amongthem.

[part0015.html#c20-s13-e] The first of these most just among justrulers is David, in the Commedia most honored as the singer of the Holy Spirit(as are also all his companions in the Eagle: see Par. XIX.101). (David isprominently mentioned in Purg. X.65 [and see the appended note]; Par. XXV.71–72and XXXII.11–12). He is, in fact, the figure from the Old Testament most presentin Dante’s work, referred to perhaps fifty times in all.For his service to the Lord in transporting the Ark of the Covenant, seePurgatorio X.55–69.

[part0015.html#c20-s14-e] Some think the words suo consiglio (his ownthought) refer to the “thought” of the Holy Spirit; most, to that of David (asis reflected in our translation).The question of the “merit” of David’s song disturbs some readers. See, forinstance, Tozer (comm. to vv. 40–42), pointing out that David could benefit onlyinsofar as his song proceeded from his own free will (and thus was not theeffect of inspiration, in which case it would not, as the text suggests, initself make him worthy of salvation). However, is David’s worthiness not similarto the unexpressed claim for his own “merit” that Dante might have consideredmost convincing? He presents himself as the “new David” from the outset (seeInf. I.65), that is, as a man directly inspired by God to lift his eyes fromworldly distraction. In Dante’s mind, there does not seem to be any limitationon the freedom of his will imposed thereby.

[part0015.html#c20-s15-e] Trajan, the Roman emperor (a.d. 98–117), isclosest to the Eagle’s beak in the semicircle that describes the “eyebrow,” asit were, above David, located as the pupil of the eye. For his humble service tothe widow and the tradition of his salvation, see Purgatorio X.73–93 and theappended note. For some of the twists and turns in the history of the accountsof the salvation of Trajan, see Picone (Pico.2002.6), pp. 313–19.Now Trajan appreciates, both by now being here with God and by having been inLimbo, the cost of not following Christ.

[part0015.html#c20-s17-e] Hezekiah, a king of Judah in the seventhcentury b.c., was a just monarch, according to the Bible, at least in his ownaccountancy (see II Kings 20:3).His tears (but were they shed in penitence?) are found in Isaiah 38:3, as wasfirst noted by Jacopo della Lana (comm. to verse 51). Here is the pertinentpassage (38:1–5): “In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point ofdeath. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him,‘Thus says the Lord: Set your house in order, for you shall die, you shall notrecover.’ Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, andsaid, ‘Please, O Lord, remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness andwith a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.’ And Hezekiah weptbitterly. Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah: ‘Go and say to Hezekiah,Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; Ihave seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life’ ” (italicsadded). Hezekiah in fact here does not weep out of penitence, as Dante says hedid, but the detail that God saw his tears and then remitted his sentence ofdeath was perhaps enough to suggest to the poet that the king was contrite forhis sins, and not merely brokenhearted and afraid.Now Hezekiah knows that answered prayers are part of God’s plan, rather thanrepresenting a change in it (cf. Purg. VI.28–42, where the same question israised about Virgil’s views on this matter). Carroll (comm. to vv. 49–54) putsthis well: “In short, what Hezekiah now knows in Heaven is the mystery of howprayer harmonizes with and fulfils ‘the eternal judgment,’ instead of being, asit seems, an alteration of it.”For Hezekiah as “type” of Dante, see Charity (Char.1966.1), p. 230, and the noteto Inferno I.1. [return to English [part0015.html#c20-s17-e] / Italian[part0026.html#c20-s17-i]]52–54. [part0015.html#c20-s18-e] Tozer (comm. to this tercet) paraphrases andinterprets this passage as follows: “ ‘when a worthy prayer causes that whichwas ordained for the present time to be postponed to a future time’; this waswhat happened in Hezekiah’s case through the postponement of his death. Themeaning of the entire passage here is, that what God has ordained is not changedin answer to prayer, because God has already provided for it.” [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c20-s18-e] / Italian [part0026.html#c20-s18-i]]55–60. [part0015.html#c20-s19-e] Since the spatial arrangement of theinhabitants of the Eagle’s semicircular eyebrow is not chronological, the factthat Constantine (274–337) is the middle figure in it, and thus the highest,takes us by surprise, given the number and vehemence of Dante’s outburstsagainst the Donation (e.g., Inf. XIX.115–117, Purg. XXXII.124–129; and seeMonarchia, which fairly seethes with them). In this passage Dante settles forConstantine’s good intent in his governance of the Eastern empire. However, nowthis emperor knows that if the evil he unwittingly committed has not harmed him,it has nonetheless destroyed the world. Dante may allow him salvation, but makeshim pay for it eternally and dearly with this permanent wound in hisself-awareness. This does not efface the glory his good intention won him, butit does mar its beauty. [return to English [part0015.html#c20-s19-e] / Italian[part0026.html#c20-s19-i]]61–66. [part0015.html#c20-s21-e] William the Good, king of (Naples and) Sicily(ruled 1166–89), is presented as mourned by his subjects (he died young, atthirty-five), who now must suffer the misdeeds of his two successors, Charles ofAnjou (who ruled Apulia) and Frederick II of Aragon (who ruled Sicily itself—seePar. XIX.127–135, where these two are the sixth and seventh unworthy rulers inthat pestilential acrostic). Now William, who was widely celebrated in hislifetime for his lawful reign and his generosity, knows that God loves a justking.

[part0015.html#c20-s23-e] Ripheus is unlike the first five identifiedrulers in not ever having been mentioned within a Christian context by anyone atall; he is also the only one of them not to have been a king or an emperor.Indeed, he is a sort of “extra,” a bit player (if a heroic and probably highbornone) in the Aeneid, barely mentioned but for his death fighting along withAeneas (Aen. II.426–428; see also II.339, II.394). Dante does not refer to aparticular good deed that he performed, insisting instead on the general fact ofhis justness. The not inconsiderable poetic space (vv. 118–129) devoted to“explaining” his Christian belief has never diminished readers’ amazement atfinding him here. That is not surprising, as even he is portrayed (in verse 72)as not knowing the reason for his being among the elect.For a recently discovered (it had been hiding in plain view for centuries) andprobable source, or at least confirmation, of Dante’s view of Ripheus, see Scott(Scot.1994.1), pp. 190–92, pointing out that a passage in Boethius (Cons. Phil.IV.6[pr].127–131) offers several reasons to think it was in Dante’s mind as hewrote this passage: (1) that Boethius is referring to the same passage thatscholars habitually point to as Dante’s source in Aeneid II seems highly likely;(2) the Boethian context is utterly appropriate, since it involves thesurprising nature, in human eyes, of providence; (3) the passage includes aspecific reference to Lucan’s Cato of Utica (Phars. I.128), approving Cato’sworth (even though he lost his war) against that of Caesar, though Julius (andnot Cato) was victorious (see Dante’s presentation of Cato in the first twocantos of Purgatorio). The text in question reads in part as follows (tr. W. V.Cooper, italics added): “For, to glance at the depth of God’s works with so fewwords as human reason is capable of comprehending, I say that what you think tobe most fair and most conducive to justice’s preservation, that appearsdifferent to an all-seeing Providence. Has not our fellow-philosopher Lucan toldus how ‘the conquering cause did please the gods, but the conquered, Cato?’ ”One can only imagine how Dante felt, seeing that his own radical and dangerousideas had some justification in no less an authority than Boethius. For anearlier, similar, but not quite as pointed recognition of the influence of theConsolatio (and particularly its fourth book) on Dante’s thought here, seeChiarenza (Chia.1983.2).On the other hand, one may be excused a certain dubiety concerning thegenuineness of Dante’s belief in the salvation of this pagan. Virgil has handedDante the stick with which to beat him: After he calls Ripheus the most just ofthe Trojans (“iustissimus”), he concludes with the phrase “dis aliter visum” (tothe gods it seemed otherwise [Aen. II.428]); the muffled meaning seems to bethat the gods do not care about just humans, and “kill us for their sport” (asKing Lear phrased it). Dante lands hard upon Virgil for this judgment: HisChristian God reverses pagan justice. (For this view, see Hollander[Holl.1983.1], p. 138; for a more conciliatory one, Bosco/Reggio, comm. to verse68.)Chiarenza (Chia.1995.3), pp. 304–5, puts into intelligent focus the way so muchof Paradiso XX reopens the “question of Virgil” in our minds: “Virgil’s drama isbased on the contingency that he died just nineteen years before the birth ofChrist. If God could extend Hezekiah’s life by fifteen years, why did He notextend Virgil’s by little more? It was said that St. Paul, moved by the beautyand wisdom of Virgil’s poetry, prayed at the poet’s tomb for his salvation. (Forthis topic, she adverts to the work of Comparetti [Comp.1872.1], p. 98; Davis[Davi.1957.1], pp. 103–4; and Vickers [Vick.1983.1], p. 72.) If God could answerGregory’s prayers for Trajan, why did He reject the similar prayer of the greatSt. Paul? How could a minor figure in Virgil’s poem have caught the attention ofGod, while Virgil himself failed to?” Whether we like it or not, we have heardthe answer to our question in the last canto, when the Eagle came down hard uponDante for his similar question (Par. XIX.79–90): We cannot weigh God’s intent,only recognize it.On the question of God’s disposition of the virtuous pagans, see G. Fallani,“salvezza dei pagani,” ED IV (1973) and Picone (Pico.2002.6), pp. 311–13, and,with specific reference to Ripheus, pp. 317–20. For the interesting observationthat Dante might have found an equally “salvable” pagan in the person ofGalaesus, also referred to by Virgil as “iustissimus” (in Aeneid VII.536), seeCamerino (Came.1995.1), pp. 55–56, who sees Dante as observing this ratherstriking phenomenon and considering that the two “most just” pagans point only,again, to the inscrutable nature of God’s justice—as well, we might want to add,as of Dante’s.Apparently first among the few to hear the echo here of the salvation of theRoman (and thus pagan) centurion Cornelius (see Acts 10:22–23; 34–35) wasScartazzini (comm. to vv. 68–69); most recently see Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p.91, building the evidence for his point better than his (unacknowledged)predecessors: Cornelius the centurion, “vir iustus et timens Deum” (a just andGod-fearing man [Acts 10:22; Aversano’s italics]). He concludes, “In patristicexegesis this centurion is the type of the gentiles saved by the grace of God”;Cornelius “because of his great faith and his justness, received the gift of theHoly Spirit before he was baptized” (Aversano is citing Rabanus Maurus for thisjudgment).Perhaps our poet was tempted to push his reading of Virgil past the point of noreturn. At any rate, that is what he has accomplished, making the condemnedauthor of the Aeneid, alongside the similarly Limbo-bound hero of his epic,spend their eternities in the lower world of an afterlife they neither believedin nor deserved, while this “bit player” enjoys the fruits of Heaven. For him tobe here, Ripheus necessarily had to welcome Christ into his life; again, one hasa difficult time believing that Dante really thought so. But that is what hedecided he thought.

That he wants them to couple it withhis similarly contentious insistence on Solomon’s salvation (despite the warmlycontrary opinions of some “big guns” of Christian theology, none bigger or morenegative about the possibility of Solomon’s salvation than Augustine) is theopinion of Lauren Seem (Seem.2006.1), p. 77. She points out that both Solomon(Par. X.109) and Ripheus are the fifth lights in the shapes that they and theircolleagues have temporarily assumed in order to display themselves to Dante, acircle and the eyebrow of an eagle, and that both were spectacularly provocativeselections for salvation. [return to English [part0015.html#c20-s23-e] / Italian[part0026.html#c20-s23-i]]73–78. [part0015.html#c20-s25-e] The Eagle, delighted by its own report of thesalvation of Ripheus (and by the fact that not even he understands why he wassaved), is like a lark satisfied by its own song, silent in its flight, savoringthat melody in memory. The ensuing description of the silent emblem is not easyto decode, but it seems to refer to the Eagle (l’imago) as stamped (de la’mprenta) by the eternal Beauty that is God (l’etterno piacere), by whose willeach thing becomes that which it is. In this case that last and rather puzzlinggeneral statement probably refers most directly to Ripheus’s saved soul, as thecontext suggests.This passage has understandably caused a certain amount of debate (for asummary, see Scartazzini [comm. to vv. 76–78]). Its key phrase (“la ’mprenta /de l’etterno piacere”) either means that the Eagle bears the imprint of God’swill or is the imprint of His beauty. Most of the commentators, includingScartazzini, are of the first persuasion. However, when speaking of the etternopiacere of God, Dante elsewhere seems to refer to His everlasting beauty (seeTook [Took. 1984.1], pp. 10–11, 17–22). The phrase also occurs in PurgatorioXXIX.32 and Paradiso XVIII.16. In addition, in Paradiso the word piacere,standing alone and referring to God, frequently seems to indicate His beauty(see Par. XXVII.95, XXXII.65, and XXXIII.33). And so we have translated thephrase, if gingerly, as we have. This is a possible reading, but not a certainone.

[part0015.html#c20-s25-e] John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 73–78) is alertto the charming pun available in the name of the bird (allodetta, lark). He putsLatin words into its beak: “Surge, Deum lauda, iam lux est, cantat alauda”(‘Arise, praise God, for it is light,’ sings the lark [italics added, eventhough John’s play on words is lost in English]).

[part0015.html#c20-s27-e] This simple comparison, less developed than a“classical” simile, makes the heavy question within Dante evident to the soulsconfiguring the Eagle. Despite knowing that, he nonetheless bursts out inamazement and perplexity. We may need to remind ourselves that for eighty-fivecantos the protagonist has resisted the notion that virtuous pagans should becondemned to Hell. Then the Eagle insisted on that harsh truth in Canto XIX. Andnow that same Eagle tells Dante that two of the greatest souls that produce hisshape are saved pagans. It is small wonder the protagonist is both amazed andperplexed. [return to English [part0015.html#c20-s27-e] / Italian[part0026.html#c20-s27-i]]79–81. [part0015.html#c20-s27-e] Tozer (comm. to this tercet) explains thepassage as follows: “The metaphor is from coloured glass, the reference being to‘coated’ glass, i.e. white glass coated with a coloured film on one side only.As this colour could be clearly seen through the glass, so the spirits couldlook through Dante’s mind, and see the doubt within it.” [return to English[part0015.html#c20-s27-e] / Italian [part0026.html#c20-s27-i]]85–90.

[part0015.html#c20-s31-e] Commentators, beginning with Scartazzini(comm. to vv. 91–92), suggest the trace here of Aquinas’s distinction betweencognitio sensitiva and cognitio intellectiva (ST II–II, q. 8, a. 1), that is,between knowledge based on sense perception and that based on reason,penetrating to the true meaning of phenomena.

As we willsee (vv. 108, 121), the virtues of Hope and Love will be specifically alignedwith the salvations of Trajan and of Ripheus, respectively.

[part0015.html#c20-s33-e] Rhyme may have forced Dante to use aProvençalism, sobranza (overcomes, conquers), but he seems to welcome theexcuse, as his project for the language of the Commedia is inclusive rather thanexclusive.

[part0015.html#c20-s35-e] This tercet is built on still anotherchiasmus: Trajan, Ripheus; Christ to come, Christ come.As opposed to a more comfortable understanding, in other words, that Trajan and(more pointedly) Ripheus had been won to the God of the Christians throughimplicit faith (see Aquinas, ST II–II, q. 2, a. 7), Dante insists that hebelieves that we believe that they believed explicitly in Christ, in Trajan’scase (less difficult to accept, but involving a major miracle [see vv. 106–117],after the fact; in Ripheus’s, before [see vv. 118–129]). And so they died, notas unbelievers, but as full-fledged Christians. The trick here is to add adisclaimer for Trajan (he died a Christian only when he died a second time) andto swallow hard at the claim made on behalf of Ripheus.The feet of Jesus, transfixed to the Cross by a single spike, offered one of themost piteous physical images drawn from the Passion. See, for example, Bonvesinde la Riva’s De scriptura rubra in his Libro de le tre scritture, vv. 153–170(cited by Gragnolati [Grag.2005.1], pp. 95–96; and see p. 231, n. 57), where, ineighteen verses, the word pei (Milanese dialect for “feet”) occurs six times inBonvesin’s bloody account of the Crucifixion. [return to English[part0015.html#c20-s35-e] / Italian [part0026.html#c20-s35-i]]106–117. [part0015.html#c20-s36-e] The somewhat grudging authority of St.Thomas (ST, Suppl., q. 71, a. 5) sustains the widely disseminated tale thatTrajan was resuscitated by agency of Gregory’s accepted prayers, believed inChrist, was baptized, died a second time, and was received in Heaven (see thenote to Purg. X.73–93). Thomas, however, seems in fact to have been drawn to thestory of Gregory’s intervention on Trajan’s behalf, referring to it in some sixloci in his other works. See the indispensable online Corpus Thomisticum(www.corpusthomisticum.org [http://www.corpusthomisticum.org]), the project inwhich Father Roberto Busa convinced IBM to become his partner in 1946.

[part0015.html#c20-s36-e] What is perhaps most surprising about Trajan’sreward is that it was won not by his hope, but by that of Pope Gregory. We arereminded of the fate of those in Limbo (where, we assume, Trajan was firstlodged), who exist (according to Inf. IV.42) longing for a better lot, ifwithout hope for it (sanza speme). Gregory’s hope “conquered” God on Trajan’sbehalf; the emperor himself, the evidence that we gather from Limbo would seemto assert, was hopeless.

[part0015.html#c20-s40-e] Some early commentators (e.g., Pietro diDante [Pietro1, comm. to these verses], John of Serravalle [comm. to vv. 31–36and 127–129]) speak of the “baptism of fire” in those inspired by the HolySpirit to love God perfectly. For Dante, Virgil’s single word, iustissimus,seems to have been the key for this incredible invention. (For the centrality ofjustice to Dante’s design, see the note to Inferno III.4.)To Ripheus Virgil has dedicated a total of only five lines in the Aeneid; Dantedoubles that (and then some) in this passage alone.

[part0015.html#c20-s41-e] The word drittura is a hapax in the poem, buthas a Dantean history before it puts in its appearance here, first in Convivio(IV.xvii.6), where, as rectitude, it is an attribute of the eleventh and finalof Aristotle’s moral virtues, Justice. Drittura also appears in the exiliccanzone, “Tre donne intorno al cor mi son venute” (Rime CIV.35), where she seemsas much a despised exile from Florence as does the poet.

[part0015.html#c20-s42-e] As provocation, this detail is over the top.Nonetheless, the commentators are amazingly willing to accept what Dante sayswithout protest. The whole story of Ripheus is nothing less than outrageous, andnow the poet tops it off by turning him, as Poletto (comm. to vv. 124–126) hadthe strength of mind to observe, into a sort of Trojan St. Paul. Why not? Danteseems to have thought; if he became a Christian, he must have hated those shoddypagan gods and the religious practices of his fellow pagans, doesn’t that makessense? And so he preached against those practices. Is Dante having fun with us?And at Virgil’s expense? Perhaps. [return to English [part0015.html#c20-s42-e] /Italian [part0026.html#c20-s42-i]]127–129. [part0015.html#c20-s43-e] The three ladies are obviously the threetheological virtues, whom we saw at the right wheel of the chariot of the ChurchTriumphant in Purgatorio XXIX.121–129. In what sense did they “serve to baptize”Ripheus? Since that ritual was not available to him, and since he was born withoriginal sin upon him, he required something in its place. Somehow he acquiredthe three theological virtues and these brought him to Christ. Dante’s text heremay reflect a passage in St. Augustine’s De doctrina christiana (I.xxxix.43):“Thus a man supported by faith, hope, and charity, with an unshaken hold uponthem, does not need the Scriptures except for the instruction of others” (tr. D.W. Robertson, Jr.). [return to English [part0015.html#c20-s43-e] / Italian[part0026.html#c20-s43-i]]130–148. [part0015.html#c20-s44-e] The fourth and final section of this cantoaddresses itself to a question that has always troubled Christians (as isfocally shown in many of the writings of Augustine): predestination. ReiteratingThomas’s criticism of our all-too-human desire to speculate upon the likelysalvation or damnation of our neighbors (Par. XIII.139–142), the Eagle nowportrays as cosmic the unknowing that surrounds God’s purpose. Not even theimmortal just souls in the Empyrean know all the elect (see verse 72 for theless dramatic notice of the shortness of mortal vision in this regard). Thiscomes as something of a surprise, as Torquato Tasso noted (comm. to vv.133–135), since everything we have previously learned about this topic wouldclearly seem to indicate that the saved know, in God, all things that exist(see, inter alia, Par. V.4–6, VIII.85–90, IX.73–75, XV.49–51, XVII.13–18, andXIX.28–30, as well as the notes to Par. IV.16–18 and XIV.7–9); however, Dante’senthusiasm for the subject seems to have led him into at least a possibleself-contradiction, since what is said here denies that even the blessed canhave complete knowledge of what God has in His mind. Gragnolati (Grag.2005.1,passim) argues that after the general resurrection God’s thought will beknowable by all the saved. Dante’s apparent assertion that the blessed do notknow the identities of those not yet saved certainly seems to violate theprinciple that whatever God knows the saved are able to read in His mind, asTasso noted. From Paradiso XV.49–51 we have learned that Cacciaguida knew thatDante was inscribed in the Book of Life. And so we must wonder how thoroughlythe poet held to this apparent revision of his earlier view, as much as we musthonor it.Venturi (comm. to verse 135) was apparently the first commentator to refer topart of the collecta (“collect”—originally a short prayer recited to Christiansgathered [“collected”] for a service) known as “the Collect for the living andthe dead”: “Deus, cui soli cognitus est numerus electorum in superna felicitatelocandus” (God, to whom alone is known the number of the elect that is to be setin supernal bliss). This prayer, once it was cited by Venturi, had a certainafterlife in the commentators right through the nineteenth century, but for somereason has been allowed to vanish in our time. Nonetheless, while it does giveus an official teaching of the Church regarding the limits of the knowledge ofthose in the Empyrean, it certainly is at odds with what the poem has led us toexpect, as Tasso observed. [return to English [part0015.html#c20-s44-e] /Italian [part0026.html#c20-s44-i]]134. [part0015.html#c20-s45-e] The Eagle once again, concluding its presencein the poem, speaks as a plural entity, in the collective voice of theindividual souls of the just. [return to English [part0015.html#c20-s45-e] /Italian [part0026.html#c20-s45-i]]139–141. [part0015.html#c20-s47-e] Thus were Dante’s weak eyes strengthened byJustice (cf. the Eagle’s very first words at XIX.13, speaking in thefirst-person singular: “Per esser giusto e pio” [For being just and merciful]).[return to English [part0015.html#c20-s47-e] / Italian[part0026.html#c20-s47-i]]141. [part0015.html#c20-s47-e] The phrase “soave medicina” (sweet medication)recalls the medicina of Inferno XXXI.3. It also probably refers to the“pestilence” the protagonist’s eyes had encountered in the counterpoised objectof vision to this briefer catalogue of the justly saved, the group of twelvedamned rulers found in Canto XIX. As Marino Barchiesi (Barc.1973.1), pp. 73–74,realized, it also recalls the “disease” of sympathy for classical divinationdemonstrated by the protagonist in Inferno XX. And, in this vein, see Hollander(Holl.1980.2), p. 199: “The disease which has been cured in Paradiso XX revealedits etiology in Inferno XX.” [return to English [part0015.html#c20-s47-e] /Italian [part0026.html#c20-s47-i]]142–148. [part0015.html#c20-s48-e] This is the final simile of the canto andof this simile-filled heaven (there are twelve in Cantos XVIII–XX, four ineach): As a lutenist accompanies a singer, Trajan and Ripheus move their flames,as though in accompaniment, to the Eagle’s words.

[part0015.html#c21-s01-e] As has always been the case (Par. I.64–66[Moon]; V.88–96 [Mercury]; VIII.14–15 [Venus]; X.37–39 [Sun]; XIV.79–84 [Mars];XVIII.52–57 [Jupiter]; and in these verses), as he ascends to a new heaven,Dante fixes his eyes on Beatrice’s face so that nothing else can attract hisattention. And it will be much the same in the three ascents still before him(Par. XXII.97–105 [Starry Sphere]; XXVII.88–96 [Crystalline Sphere]; XXX.14–27[Empyrean]). In most of these moments, Beatrice is either explicitly orindirectly portrayed as smiling. This time, however, there is something quitedifferent about the heavenly guide’s disposition, as we discover in thefollowing tercet: For the first time in this situation, an ascent to the nextcelestial heaven, Beatrice is rather pointedly not smiling. The little mysterythat this fact engenders is left for Peter Damian to resolve (see vv. 61–63).[return to English [part0015.html#c21-s01-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c21-s01-i]]5–12. [part0015.html#c21-s02-e] The reference to Ovid’s Semele (Metam.III.256–315) may at first seem out of place in this context (as it did not whenit occurred in Inf. XXX.1–2, where the vengeance of God upon the counterfeitersis compared to the vengeance taken by Juno upon Semele). “Semele, daughter ofCadmus, king of Thebes; she was beloved by Jupiter, by whom she became themother of Bacchus. Juno, in order to avenge herself upon Jupiter, appeared toSemele in the disguise of her aged nurse Beroe, and induced her to ask Jupiterto show himself to her in the same splendour and majesty in which he appeared toJuno. Jupiter, after warning Semele of the danger, complied with her request,and appeared before her as the god of thunder, whereupon she was struck bylightning and consumed to ashes” (T). Here, Beatrice, as Jove, withholds hersovereign and celestial beauty from her mortal “lover” until such time as hewill be able to bear her divine beauty. Thus Ovid’s “tragic” tale, embellishedwith a Christian and “comic” conclusion, is rewritten; unlike Semele, Dante willbecome capable of beholding the immortals face-to-face. See Brownlee(Brow.1991.2) for a discussion in this vein, also demonstrating that this mythfunctions as the “spine” of the narrative of Dante’s spiritual growth in thisheaven.

[part0015.html#c21-s03-e] The phrase l’etterno palazzo (eternal palace)recalls, according to Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 94, the domus Dei (house ofGod) mentioned by Jacob in Genesis 28:17, a passage not distant from the onedescribing his dream of the ladder, so prominently visited in this canto. Seethe note to vv. 28–30. [return to English [part0015.html#c21-s03-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c21-s03-i]]13–15. [part0015.html#c21-s05-e] Beatrice announces that they have arrived inthe seventh heaven, that of Saturn, characterized, as we shall find, by monasticsilence. As the tenth canto of this cantica marked a transition to a higherrealm (from the subsolar heavens of Moon, Mercury, and Venus), so does thiscanto lift the pilgrim into a still higher realm, beyond that dedicated to thepraise of those associated with knowledge, just warfare, and just rulership, forDante the highest forms of human activity in the world. Contemplation, as a formof direct contact with divinity, is thus marked off as a still higher form ofhuman activity, one that itself borders on the divine. The major exemplaryfigures in this realm, Peter Damian and Benedict, are presented as, even duringtheir lives on earth, having been nearly angelic in their comprehension, if,however, maintaining contact with the ordinary in their daily rituals ofmonastic labor (a monastery was, among other things, a sort of single-sexfarming community). The eighth sphere will present us with still holier humans,writers of the Christian Bible (Saints Peter, James, and John), while in theninth we find the reflection of the angelic intelligences. Thus we are hereentering the final triad in the poet’s tripartite division of the createduniverse.That the constellation Leo should be described as warm (“ardente”—v. 14) seemsto allow the understanding that Dante is speaking only metaphorically (the Sunbeing in Leo, and thus “warming” it). But, as Torraca (comm. to vv. 13–15) andothers, after him, point out, an antecedent text (Par. XVI.39) also seems tomake the constellation itself heat-producing.

[part0015.html#c21-s06-e] Beatrice’s monitory metaphor is precise:Dante should put his mind/memory behind his eyes in order to make them mirrors,by agency of such “backing,” in order to understand and remember what he isabout to see in Saturn.

XIX.3). It is alarger presence in Convivio, where it is mentioned several times, including inthe following description: “The heaven of Saturn has two properties by which itmay be compared to Astrology: one is the slowness of its movement through the 12signs, for according to the writings of the astrologers, a time of more than 29years is required for its revolution; the other is that it is high above all theother planets” (Conv. II.xiii.28—tr. R. Lansing). This makes it symbolically themost lofty philosophical pursuit of all, since astrology is the highest and mostdifficult science for its students to master. Theology alone is more lofty—andmore difficult. [return to English [part0015.html#c21-s09-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c21-s09-i]]28–30. [part0015.html#c21-s10-e] This ladder, as has been recognized at leastsince the fourteenth century (see the Codice Cassinese, comm. to Par. XXII.67),derives from the Bible, the ladder to Heaven seen by Jacob in his dream (Genesis28:12), as Dante’s reference in the next canto will underline (Par. XXII.70–72).Further, and as Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 29–30) point out, both these saints,Peter Damian and Benedict, had written of Jacob’s Ladder as emblematizing thepurpose of (monastic) life. However, we probably ought also to considerBoethius, who presents the Lady Philosophy as having the image of a ladder onher gown (Cons. Phil.

Pecoraro takes an interesting detour through the writingsof Paolo Amaducci, a neglected figure in Dante studies, who effectively was thefirst modern critic (Filippo Villani was arguably the first ancient one) toapply the fourfold method of Scriptural exegesis to interpreting Dante (forAmaducci, without reference to Pecoraro’s earlier notice, see Hollander[Holl.1976.1, pp. 128–29, n. 49, and Holl.2001.1, p. 187, n. 45]).

[part0015.html#c21-s11-e] It is eventually clear (e.g., vv. 64–66) thatall these spirits (compared to all the stars in the nighttime sky), descending,are coming from the Empyrean for the sole purpose of welcoming Dante to hishigher degree of contemplative awareness; that they, like all the spirits we seein the heavens, are only temporary visitors to these realms; that all the savedsouls and the angels populate the Empyrean (as far as we can tell, they havenever manifested themselves to anyone in a lower heaven before Dante’s mostextraordinary visit to the heavens that concludes his journey through theafterworld).Jacob saw angels on the ladder in his dream, ascending and descending. Dantesees the souls of the blessed only descending, at least for now. [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c21-s11-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c21-s11-i]]34–42. [part0015.html#c21-s12-e] This is the sole “classical” simile in thesetwo cantos devoted to the monastic sphere of Saturn (but see Par. XXII.1–6) andperhaps represents the only joyous moment in them. It describes those souls whodescend from the Empyrean, where such behavior is not only appropriate butnatural, for it is the realm of everlasting joy.This fairly extended simile is complex enough to have caused considerabledifficulty. For an interesting and original interpretation, see Carroll (comm.to these verses). He argues that Dante has carefully followed Thomas Aquinas (STII–II, q. 180, a. 3–6) for every detail of this passage (Torraca [comm. to theseverses] will later cite the same passage without treating it as fully). Here isan abbreviated version of Carroll’s argument: Thomas is responding to Richard ofSt. Victor’s six steps of contemplation, reduced by Richard himself to three:Cogitatio, Meditatio, Contemplatio. When the descending spirits, the jackdaws inthe simile, reach a certain step, groups of them begin moving in one of threeways (about which there will be more shortly). That step, Carroll says,represents Richard’s second step, Meditation, or speculation, an intellectualactivity that draws, in Aquinas’s treatment here, on the image of mirroring (asCarroll points out Dante has done in vv. 17–18). The descending spirits, we mustremember, are used to seeing in the third way, Contemplation. Now, reenteringthe protagonist’s realm of experience, which necessarily falls short of seeingface-to-face (as even he will be able to do shortly, once he enters theEmpyrean), these saved souls behave in three different ways. Carroll associateseach of these behaviors in turn with Thomas’s discussion of Richard of St.Victor’s three modes of intellectual activity: “Some of the souls ‘go awaywithout return,’ that is, without doubling back: they represent the straightmotion which goes direct from things of sense to things of intellect. Some ‘turnback to where they started from’—to the certain step from which their flightbegan: they represent the oblique motion, which is composed, says Aquinas, of amixture of straight and circular, of reason and divine illumination. And some,‘wheeling, make a sojourn’: they represent the circular motion,—that perfectmovement by which the intellect turns uniformly round one centre of Divinetruth, the ‘sojourn’ signifying the immobility of this motion, as of a revolvingwheel that sleeps upon the axle.”As for the birds themselves, Carroll cites Benvenuto (comm. to these verses) tothe effect that they love solitude and choose the desert for their habitation.Pole, according to some commentators, are cornacchie grige (gray crows, orjackdaws), having black wings, silver eyes, and large red beaks encircled byyellow.

[part0015.html#c21-s13-e] It is perhaps needless to say that there havebeen several ingenious attempts to explain these three movements of the birds.It is perhaps fair to say that none has seemed ultimately convincing. Carroll’s,based in the texts of Richard of St. Victor and of Aquinas (see the note to vv.34–42), remains the most interesting.

[part0015.html#c21-s14-e] It may be fair to suggest that the significanceof this “rung” of Jacob’s Ladder has also escaped even the few who choose todiscuss it. It seems unlikely to represent a mere “realistic” detail, forexample, the “rung” of the “ladder” that is at a level with the heaven ofSaturn. Again, see Carroll’s interesting hypothesis (see the note to vv. 34–42),that this is the “grade” of meditation, the earthly form of divinecontemplation, as it were.

[part0015.html#c21-s16-e] Dante underlines his obedience to Beatrice asthe reason he does not respond more fully to Peter Damian’s affection for thisspecial visitor to the sphere of Saturn.

[part0015.html#c21-s18-e] From Peter, Dante wants to know two things:why he seemed, by his proximity, so affectionate toward him and why, for thefirst time in the heavens, song has yielded to silence. [return to English[part0015.html#c21-s18-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c21-s18-i]]58–60. [part0015.html#c21-s20-e] Saturn is marked by an atmosphere of monasticself-denial. It is the home of the cardinal virtue temperance and of religiousmeditation. The absence of melody in Saturn is singular thus far in Paradiso,for we and the protagonist have become accustomed to hearing sacred songs as weascend the spheres: “Ave Maria” in the Moon (Par. III.121–122); an “Osanna” inboth Mercury (VII.1) and Venus (VIII.29); the singing of the souls in the Sun isreferred to a good half dozen times, but it is only in XIII.25–27 that we areinformed that they sing, not of Bacchus nor of Apollo, but of the Trinity; nextwe learn that the unidentified song in Mars contains the words Risurgi and Vinci(XIV.125) and that the souls in Jupiter sing of God (XVIII.99). Underscoring theuniqueness of the silence of this sphere, the final three heavens are alsomarked by song: the Starry Sphere by Gabriel’s song for Mary (XXIII.103–108) andby the other members of the Church Triumphant crying out, to the ascendingmother of God, “Regina celi” (XXIII.128). In the succeeding sphere, variousmoments in Dante’s progress among his saintly interlocutors are punctuated byvoices raised in song: “Dio laudamo” (XXIV.113), “Sperino in te” (XXV.73),“Sperent in te” (XXV.98), “Santo, santo, santo” (XXVI.69), “Al Padre, al Figlio,a lo Spirito Santo, gloria” (XXVII.1–2); in the Crystalline Sphere the angelicchoirs resonate with “Hosannah” (XXVIII.94); in the Empyrean we hear once morethe “Ave Maria” (XXXII.95).

It is brutally frank: Dante still thinks as theworld thinks and is not yet ready to experience the higher degree of divinitythat songs at this level represent. And now we also learn that this wasprecisely the reason for Beatrice’s withholding of her customary smile as well(see verse 4). [return to English [part0015.html#c21-s21-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c21-s21-i]]64–72. [part0015.html#c21-s22-e] Peter’s answer to Dante’s first question ismore circuitous, but reflects the same problem: Dante’s inability to thinkbeyond the limits of a human comprehension of love. Peter’s affection for Danteis not greater than that felt by any others among the saved in Paradise, that isto say, it is not “personal.” We may remember Casella in Purgatorio II, whosegreeting was very personal indeed, as a kind of control for our measurement ofthis affection.

[part0015.html#c21-s25-e] Still a slow learner, Dante gets part of themessage: In the Court of Heaven, freedom in loving is to follow God’s will, asimilar paradox to that developed in Beatrice’s lengthy discussion of free willin Paradiso V.19–33. On the other hand, his follow-up question reveals that heis still eager to understand the reason for the choice of Peter Damian as thedeliverer of heavenly greeting.

[part0015.html#c21-s26-e] For Aquinas’s distinction (ST I, q. 23, a. 1)between providence and predestination, see Torraca (comm. to these verses).Carroll, in another context (comm. to Par. XX.130–132), cites this same passagein the Summa and paraphrases it as follows: “Hence Predestination is defined as‘Divine Providence leading rational creatures to their supernatural end, theBeatific Vision,’ the entire process, from beginning to end, having its reasonin the Divine will alone. It is not dependent on the foreseen merits of theelect; and the prayers of saints (such as Gregory’s for Trajan) are only part ofthe second causes by means of which the decree of Predestination is worked out.”Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 78) also cite Thomas (ST I, q. 22, a. 3): “Twothings belong to providence—namely, the type of the order of things foreordainedtowards an end; and the execution of this order, which is called government.”They go on to suggest that Dante was in accord with this view in ParadisoXI.28–30. Their point is that the subject here is not predestination, but divineforeknowledge of the actions of particular individuals.For more on predestination, see the note to Paradiso XX.130–148.

[part0015.html#c21-s28-e] Peter’s preamble tells Dante how he wasfilled with divine love for his mission, but not why, as his final point willinsist.Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) paraphrase the passage as follows: “Thelight of grace descends on me, penetrating the light that wraps me round, inwhose womb I am enclosed, and its power, conjoined with my intellect, lifts meso far above myself that I can see the supreme essence, God, from whom thislight bursts forth. From this sight comes the joy with which I shine, since thesplendor of my flame is as great as the clarity of my vision of God.” [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c21-s28-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c21-s28-i]]84. [part0015.html#c21-s28-e] Muresu (Mure.1996.2), p. 30, reports discomfortat the Dantean coinage inventrarsi on the part of several commentators. Amongthose he mentions are Tommaseo (comm. to this verse): “non bello” (notbeautiful) is his laconic reaction. Andreoli (comm. to this verse) has this tosay: The term is “unfit to describe a heavenly spirit speaking of his divinelight.” But see Mattalia (comm. to this verse) for an understanding of Dante’ssense of the Scriptural relevance of the word, reflecting the Gospels’references to Mary’s womb (e.g., Luke 11:27, cited by Virgil, as character, atInf. VIII.45). As usual, Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) has a lengthydiscussion of the variant readings. See also the two appearances of the nounventre (womb, belly) in this cantica (Par.

[part0015.html#c21-s31-e] Neither the most exalted soul in Heaven,Peter explains, possibly referring to Mary (see Par. XXXI.116–117), nor one ofthe most enlightened of the highest order of angels, a seraph, can ever know thereasons for God’s decisions. This is the only limit, then, on even angelicintelligence. All those in the Empyrean can know, in God, all relations amongall things, in heaven and on earth, but not the eventual reasons that mightexplain their causes. The urgency of Peter’s explanation to Dante is clearlyaimed past him, to us on earth, who so enjoy imagining that we understand theroot causes of events even though our normal sinful disability should probablydeprive us of such baseless optimism in this regard. But we are little moremature than babies, forever asking “Why?” See, on this passage, Hawkins(Hawk.1995.1), p. 313.

[part0015.html#c21-s32-e] The description of providence (God’sforeknowledge, which alone can account for the causes that lie behind theinterrelations of things) as an “abyss” suggests a “plurality of worlds,” thisuniverse (known by the angels and the blessed) and the vast inner mind of Godthat extends (if it may be said to extend) to regions of which we cannot possesseven the slightest knowledge nor indeed verify the existence. At least as earlyas Purgatorio III.37, Dante should have understood that such things were beyondknowing. Virgil then advised him that humans were not behaving rationally whenthey hoped to know the “why” behind things. Dante is, as we are frequentlyforced to acknowledge, a slow learner.

[part0015.html#c21-s35-e] Discouraged from pursuing his quest forknowledge beyond both human and, indeed, angelic potential, Dante contentshimself with asking Peter, in the form of his third question, to identifyhimself.

[part0015.html#c21-s36-e] The seven tercets dedicated to the life ofPeter Damian (1007–72) are reminiscent of the earlier saints’ lives that we haveheard in Paradiso. Once again we begin with a geographical indicator (themountain called Catria, in the Apennines, that rises some five thousand feetabove sea level, near the town of Gubbio). Peter’s narrative is brief andself-abnegating (those of Francis [Par. XI] and of Dominic [Par. XII] areconsiderably more full, but then they are narrated by praiseful others, not bytheir abstemious selves). Peter’s is modesty itself, concluding with the ironicand bitter reflection on his having been made to give over the life of prayerthat truly pleased him for that of “administration.”“St. Peter Damian, proclaimed doctor of the Church by Leo XII in 1828; born ofan obscure family at Ravenna c. 1007. In his childhood he was much neglected,and after the death of his parents was set by his eldest brother to tend swine.Later on, another brother, named Damian, who was archdeacon of Ravenna, tookcompassion on him and had him educated. Peter in gratitude assumed his brother’sname and was thenceforth known as Peter Damian (Petrus Damiani). After studyingat Ravenna, Faenza, and Parma, he himself became a teacher, and soon acquiredcelebrity. At the age of about 28, however, he entered the Benedictine monasteryof Fonte Avellana on the slopes of Monte Catria, of which in 1043 he becameabbot. In this capacity he rendered important services to Popes Gregory VI,Clement II, Leo IX, Victor II, and Stephen IX, by the last of whom he was in1057, much against his will, created cardinal bishop of Ostia. He appears tohave been a zealous supporter of these popes, and of Hildebrand (afterwardsGregory VII), in their efforts to reform Church discipline, and made journeysinto France and Germany with that object. After fulfilling several importantmissions under Nicholas II and Alexander II, he died at an advanced age atFaenza, Feb. 22, 1072.“Dante represents Peter Damian as inveighing against the luxury of the prelatesin his day; the commentators quote in illustration a passage from a letter ofhis to his brother cardinals, in which he reminds them that the dignity of aprelate does not consist in wearing rare and costly furs and fine robes, nor inbeing escorted by troops of armed adherents, nor in riding on neighing andmettlesome steeds, but in the practice of morality and the exercise of thesaintly virtues” (T). While he was never formally canonized, he was venerated asa saint from the time following his death in several places in Italy and atCluny.

[part0015.html#c21-s37-e] John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 106–111)distinguishes among latrìa (the accent in the poem may be due to therequirements of rhyme or, as Scartazzini suggests [comm. to this verse], toDante’s small Greek), dulia, and yperdulia. The first is defined as honoring Godalone; the second, those who are virtuous (e.g., the saints); the third, “thingsexcellent” (examples are Mary and the cross). Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 109–111)mentions the appearance of the term in both Augustine (DcD X.1) and Aquinas (STII–II, q. 81, a. 1). Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 106–111) was thefirst to cite Isidore of Seville for the term (Etym. VIII.xi.11). [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c21-s37-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c21-s37-i]]115–117. [part0015.html#c21-s39-e] This tercet contains one (of two)references to “contemplative” intellectual behavior or to those who perform it(see the reference to contemplanti in Par. XXII.46) in the heaven of Saturn. Inneither case does it seem to refer to contemplatio Dei, but would rather seem toindicate monastic rumination, or meditation, thoughts that lead to God, but nota direct vision of Him. In fact, of the seven uses of the words derived fromcontemplare in the poem, beginning in Purgatorio XXIV.132, where Virgil, Dante,and Statius meditate upon Gluttony, only one would clearly seem to indicatecontemplation of the highest kind, St. Bernard in Paradiso XXXI.111; but eventhat may have been contemplation of the Virgin (as his contemplation referred toin Par. XXXII.1 clearly is). [return to English [part0015.html#c21-s39-e] /Italian [part0027.html#c21-s39-i]]121–123. [part0015.html#c21-s41-e] There has been controversy over thereference of the second Peter in this tercet. Petrocchi’s text has “fu’ ” (fui[I was]). And the logic of the phrasing also indicates a single reference: Inplace 1, I was called “x,” in place 2, “y.” Later historical certainty, whichwould make Dante responsible for knowing that there was another Peter, a monk inthe monastery to which he has Pietro allude and who died there in 1119, may notapply. Scholars have pointed out that Dante’s knowledge of Peter Damian wasitself suspect; he could easily have conflated these two religious of Ravenna inthis passage written, one assumes, after his settling in Ravenna circa 1317.However, since Peter Damian died in 1072, nearly fifty years before the death ofPietro Peccatore, Dante’s phrasing would seem quite odd: “In that place (hismonastery at Fonte Avellana) I was known as Peter Damian, and Peter the Sinnerwas (fu, not fu’, abbreviation of fui) in the House of Our Lady …” The syntaxand logic seem beyond rescue. The first version may be historically inaccurate,but it does make grammatical sense: “In that place I was (fu’, not fu) known asPeter Damian, and as Peter the Sinner in the House of Our Lady.” This view is inaccord with the generally authoritative Michele Barbi (Barb.1941.2), pp. 257–96,and with the later discussion in Chiavacci Leonardi (Chia.1997.1), pp. 596–97(with updated bibliography).For a review of the history of the issue (and eventual agreement with Barbi’sanalysis), see Pecoraro (Peco.1968.1), pp. 771–77. For strong support of Barbi’sviews on the single identity of the two Peters, see Muresu (Mure.1996.2), p.35n. That Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 121–123), who knew that part of Italywell, spoke so forcefully about the “deception” of those who believe that Danteis talking about two Peters probably should have concluded the debate long ago.[return to English [part0015.html#c21-s41-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c21-s41-i]]125. [part0015.html#c21-s42-e] Like Shakespeare’s “hats and clocks” in JuliusCaesar (II.i), Peter’s “cappello,” the red hat worn by cardinals, is agratuitous anachronism on Dante’s part. As Torraca was the first commentator topoint out (comm. to vv. 124–126, citing an article in BSDI 6 [1899]), it wasonly during the papacy (1243–54) of Innocent IV that this clerical accoutrementbegan to be worn by the princes of the Church.

[part0015.html#c21-s43-e] Peter concludes his words to Dante with adenunciation of corrupt clergy, culminating in one of the more memorableanticlerical images in the poem, the pastor on horseback as beast withattendants, his poor horse sagging under the weight of his flesh.Dante may have known Peter’s own imprecations against the corruptions of theclergy in his Liber Gomorrhianus (as was often suggested in the last century,first by Torraca [comm. to vv. 121–123]). As a number of commentators suggest,Peter was a man after Dante’s heart, not only for his surprising openness to“imperial” politics, but especially for his scurrilous tongue for themalfeasance of the clergy, for which he apologizes but apparently delights inallowing free rein. That Dante was recognized as anticlerical by the clergy isnot a matter to doubt. There is the obvious case of the Monarchia (which spentsome three centuries and one-third [from the first index of prohibited booksuntil 1881] as unfit for Catholic eyes). However, and as Comollo (Como.1990.1),pp. 49–50, points out, there were any number of rough spots, for a clericrespectful of his pope, in the poem (particularly Inf. XI.6–9; XIX.106–117;Purg. XIX.106–116; and Par. IX.136–142). [return to English[part0015.html#c21-s43-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c21-s43-i]]127–128. [part0015.html#c21-s43-e] Cephas (stone [pietra]) is the [Aramaic]name that Christ gave to Simon (see John 1:42), thereafter known as Simon Peter(Pietro, in Italian, keeps the pun alive better than does the English “Peter”).The “exalted vessel of the Holy Ghost” is Paul (see Inf.

[part0015.html#c21-s43-e] Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) points tobiblical sources for this fraternal abnegation: I Corinthians 10:27 (“eatwhatever is set before you”) and Luke 10:7 (Christ advising his disciples not togo from house to house in search of food, but to stay wherever they chance tobe).

[part0015.html#c21-s46-e] Peter’s collegial souls, as they descendthe ladder to greet him, glow with righteous indignation at these words.Surrounding him, having ceased their circular movement, they let loose a cry soloud and angry that Dante cannot make out the words of what they shout. Whereearlier in the canto he had been denied both Beatrice’s smile and the singing ofthe blessed, now he is allowed to hear a superfluity of sound with a similar netresult. (The canto moves from monastic silence to monkish outrage, both leavingthe protagonist stunned, uncomprehending.) It is a final reminder of his humanincapacity even now, when he has attained the height of Saturn in the heavens.For this “thunder” as resonating with that found in Ovid’s description ofJupiter, preparing to descend to seduce Semele by taking his thunder and hislightning bolts along (Metam. III.300), see Brownlee (Brow.1991.2), pp. 226–27.[return to English [part0015.html#c21-s46-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c21-s46-i]]PARADISO XXII [part0015.html#c22-e]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1–6. [part0015.html#c22-s01-e] This simile is perhaps better described as twosimple comparisons combined into a single trope. (Francesco da Buti [comm. tovv. 1–21] did, however, describe it as a “similitudine.”) It first comparesDante to a distressed child running to its mother and then portrays Beatrice asa mother calming her child. Poletto (comm. to vv. 1–3) was apparently the firstto indicate the nearly certain reference to Purgatorio XXX.43–45 (Dante as child[fantolin] running to his mommy [mamma]), but the Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. tovv. 1–3) pretty clearly had been thinking of that same text.These verses continue the action of the preceding canto, which ended with Dantebeing unable to make out the meaning of a thunder-like utterance (one of theloudest noises we hear from the pages of the poem, perhaps bringing to mind thesimilarly stunning noise of the infernal waterfall at Inferno XVI.94–105). Thisshout emanated from Peter Damian’s outraged colleagues, departing from thesilent meditation that marked their presence once they descended to this sphere(see Par. XXI.58). Naturally enough, the protagonist, unable to make out theirwords, fears lest their rebuke, so loud as to be incomprehensible, be aimed athim. His apparent logic is clear enough: In this realm, if Beatrice does notsmile and if the souls do not sing, he must be being rebuked for something hehas (or has not) done.

[part0015.html#c22-s01-e] Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 1–3) was perhaps the firstto identify the citation here of Boethius (Cons. Phil. 1.2[pr]): Philosophyappearing to the befuddled “hero” at the beginning of that work (the twopassages share versions of the phrase stupor oppressit). Thus the text of theConsolatio stands behind Dantean expressions at either end of the canto. See thenote to verse 151 (but also see the note to Par. XXI.28–30). Baranski(Bara.2002.1), p. 357, makes the telling point that Boethius presents the LadyPhilosophy’s gown as bearing a ladder that moves from lower practical matters tohigher and theological concerns, an emblem resembling the ladder we see here inSaturn, which configures both ascent and descent, the life of meditation and ofwork in the world, the monastic practices of meditation and labor. (Benedict’s“motto,” as is reported by Fallani [comm. to verse 40], was “ora et labora”[pray and work].) [return to English [part0015.html#c22-s01-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c22-s01-i]]4–6. [part0015.html#c22-s02-e] Beatrice’s increasing feminization (for her“male” attributes, see Purg. XXX.19, 43–48, 58, and the notes thereto) is,clearly, not the sign of her sexualization, as some contrive to believe. Neverin the poem does she appear as other than chaste, here, in simile, as Dante’smother. [return to English [part0015.html#c22-s02-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c22-s02-i]]7–9. [part0015.html#c22-s03-e] Beatrice corrects his misapprehension,explaining that anger in the heavens cannot be produced by anything butrighteous indignation (buon zelo). Thus the shout he heard could not have beendirected against him, but rather against those on earth who offend in theirdesecration of the religious life, “li moderni pastori” (modern shepherds [Par.XXI.131]).

[part0015.html#c22-s04-e] Beatrice explains that Dante’s inability tocomprehend the “prayers” of the visitors to Saturn, prophesying God’s vengeanceon His enemies, is in itself proof that he was not ready to bear eitherBeatrice’s beatific smile or the contemplatives’ singing, both of which were,for that reason, withheld from him.

[part0015.html#c22-s04-e] Carroll (comm. to vv. 1–18) restates apassage in St. Bernard’s De Consideratione (V.xiv) that may throw considerablelight on this tercet: There are four kinds of divine judgments, each one definedby its breadth, or length, or depth, or height. Consideration of God’s judgmentscoincides with “depth.” Carroll continues: “This kind of contemplation [citingBernard] ‘may violently shock the beholder with the fearful vision, but it putsvice to flight, firmly bases virtue, initiates in wisdom, preserves humility.’ ”It is plainly the shock of this contemplation of the ‘depth’ which here stunsthe Pilgrim. The cry is an echo from the Thrones of the Divine judgments whopreside over this Heaven, and the very echo shakes Dante to the soul; andBeatrice asks how, if the ‘depth’ so shook him, he could have borne the‘height’—the lofty ecstatic joy of contemplation represented by her smile.”[return to English [part0015.html#c22-s04-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c22-s04-i]]13–15. [part0015.html#c22-s05-e] This sort of righteous indignation is itselfa sort of joy, since it involves, as Beatrice says, the celebration of justpunishment, visible in the vengeance of God, that Dante will be able to observeon earth before he dies. This “minor prophecy” (for another see Purg.XXIII.97–102) about the punishment of the corrupt clergy resembles the similarpromise (Par. XVII.98–99), made by Cacciaguida, that Dante will witness the justpunishment of his Florentine enemies. The death of any of Dante’s majoradversaries, occurring while he was still alive, would indeed seem to makeelements of these “prophecies” correct. On the religious side of the roster,major deaths that succored Dante’s hopes included those of the popes BonifaceVIII (1303) and Clement V (1314); in the secular ledger, that of Corso Donati(1308 [see Purg. XXIV.82–90]). [return to English [part0015.html#c22-s05-e] /Italian [part0027.html#c22-s05-i]]16–18. [part0015.html#c22-s06-e] For Dante’s enemies, obviously, this swordwill make itself felt all too soon, while for him it will be slow indeed incoming.This feeling had already raced through Dante’s veins. Mattalia (comm. to verse16) indicates the second of Dante’s “political epistles” (Ep. VI.4, written inMarch of 1311), addressed to Henry VII, for the sword of God and vendetta. Thetext speaks of the “gladius Eius qui dicit: ‘Mea est ultio’ ” (the sword of Himwho says, “Vengeance is mine”).

[part0015.html#c22-s07-e] Beatrice’s urging would lead us to believethat we shall learn of the presence of at least a number of great contemplativesin this sphere. We shall, however, meet only one more, St. Benedict (named onlyby periphrasis at verses 40–42), although he is accompanied by two other namedmonastics, Macarius and Romuald (verse 49), who are merely said to be here andmust share a single line of verse. The others, of whom we are about to see manydozens, do not receive even that much notice, a perhaps fitting anonymity inthis environment of self-abnegation. For whatever reason, Dante has limited hispanoply of great contemplatives to Peter Damian and Benedict of Norcia, with anassisting cast of only two named supporting players.The phrasing of her command to Dante reflects similar urgings on Virgil’s part(Inf. IX.55, X.31; Purg. XXVII.31–32) and one earlier one by Beatrice herself(Par. XVIII.20). The ability to turn and face that which he fears or has not yetunderstood is what his two guides both encourage in him.

[part0015.html#c22-s08-e] These “one hundred little globes” are neitherprecisely one hundred in number nor little globes, but a large number ofdescended saints who, in their joy (we remember that they are spending eternityin the most joyful place there is) make one another more joyous, as can beperceived by their increasing brightness.

One light, the best andthe brightest “pearl” among them, advances to reveal his identity.For a study of Dante’s adaptation of sexually charged terms to express thedesire for God, see Pertile (Pert.1990.1), using verse 26 as his point ofdeparture.

[part0015.html#c22-s13-e] Benedict (480–543), born in the Umbrian cityof Norcia, became the founder of what is considered the oldest monastic order inthe West, which bears his name. Son of wealthy parents, he went to Rome tostudy, and there witnessed the debauchery of the clergy. His response was totake up a solitary eremitic life in a cave. His fame brought him the attentionof those who had chosen to live a cloistered life. He agreed to become the headof the convent of Vicovaro, thus moving from the existence of a hermit to thatof a cenobite. This was not in all respects a propitious decision on his part,since his fellow monks, resentful of his extremely strict Rule, tried to poisonhim. He managed to survive the attempt on his life and once again retreated tohis cave. Monks loyal to him and to his vision of the cenobitic life eventuallyfollowed him to Montecassino, where he destroyed a temple of Apollo and a grovesacred to Venus (according to Oelsner [comm. to vv. 37–39]), converted thelocals (until his advent, still pagans), and founded his order. As commentatorspoint out, beginning with Jacopo della Lana (Nota to this canto), Dante’s briefversion of Benedict’s vita is indebted to that found in his biographer, St.Gregory the Great, Dialogues, II.2. It may seem surprising that Benedict wascanonized only in 1220, nearly seven centuries after his death, while Francishad to wait only two years for his sainthood (1228).

[part0015.html#c22-s13-e] The adjectives assigned to the indigenous paganlocals pretty clearly seem to distinguish between, in Tommaseo’s view (comm. tovv. 37–39), their confused mental state and their misdirected affections (inOelsner’s formulation [see the note to vv. 37–45], worship of Apollo anddevotions to Venus).

[part0015.html#c22-s16-e] Once again (see the note to verse 1) the textindicates the special nature of the monastic vocation, a combination ofprayerful meditation and labor, in Benedict’s own prescription for cenobiticactivity, “ora et labora.” [return to English [part0015.html#c22-s16-e] /Italian [part0027.html#c22-s16-i]]48. [part0015.html#c22-s16-e] Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 37–51) resolvesthe metaphoric fiori (flowers) and frutti (fruits) into “words” and “deeds.” Itseems at least possible, given Benedict’s own division of monkish occupationinto prayer and work, that this is how we should interpret the “flowers” thatDante has in mind: the words that give shape to prayer.

[part0015.html#c22-s17-e] Saints Macarius and Romuald were surely alsomonks, but, especially with regard to the first, there is little certainty as tohis absolute identity. For Macarius, the two main candidates were both deadbefore Benedict was born. “It is uncertain which of the several saints of thename of Macarius is the one intended by Dante. The two best known, between whomperhaps Dante did not very clearly distinguish, are St. Macarius the Elder,called the Egyptian, and St. Macarius the Younger of Alexandria—both disciplesof St. Anthony. St. Macarius the Elder (born in 301) retired at the age of 30into the Libyan desert, where he remained for sixty years, passing his timebetween prayer and manual labour, until his death, at the age of 90, in 391. St.Macarius the Younger had nearly 5,000 monks under his charge (d. 404); he iscredited with having established the monastic rule of the East, as St. Benedictdid that of the West” (T).As for St. Romuald (956–1027), he began (in 1012) the Camaldolese Order, areformed group of Benedictines. It was named for the donor of its holding,campus Maldoli (the field of Maldolus), or “Camaldoli.” (Its monastery, inTuscany, is referred to in Purgatorio V.96.) Thus Benedict is bracketed,chronologically, by a precursor and a follower. Dante may have learned aboutRomuald, born in Ravenna, from the vita Romualdi composed by his townsman, PeterDamian.

[part0015.html#c22-s17-e] It sounds as though Benedict is readyinghimself to give a denunciation of the corruption of his order, in the style ofPeter Damian (Par. XXI.130–135); however, Dante interrupts him with a surprisingquestion, one that detains him for some time; he will deliver his broadside onlyat vv. 73–96.

[part0015.html#c22-s20-e] Benedict is awarded the role of Dante’spenultimate “father” in this poem, with only St. Bernard to come (for theothers, see the note to Par. XVI.16).He also has the honor of preceding St. John (see Par. XXV.122–129) in causingDante to ask questions about the fleshly aspect of the condition of the blessed.There also circulated a medieval legend that St. John, for his particularcloseness to Jesus, was unique among the rest of the blessed (Jesus and Marybeing the sole other exceptions) in having his resurrected body in Heaven beforethe general resurrection (see Jacoff [Jaco.1999.1]). Dante’s curiosity aboutBenedict’s actual appearance, however, has no ascertainable “source,” at leastnone supported by Dante’s commentators. In the case of Benedict, theprotagonist’s question (and his desire) is somewhat different. He would like tosee Benedict now as he shall be when he is found again, seated in Heaven (Par.XXXII.35), that is, with his sheathing flame removed so that his face’s featureswill be utterly plain to a beholder. Once in the Empyrean, Dante will see allthe blessed as though they had already been given back their fleshly selves(Par. XXX.43–45), that is, even before the general resurrection. Thus he willthere experience the reality of Benedict and of John (and of all the othersaints) in identical ways.Why, the commentators are left to ask, does Dante introduce this concern here,one that seems to have no historical footing? The least that one can hazard isthat, given his “fatherhood” and this exceptional request, Benedict played amore vital role in Dante’s intellectual and spiritual development than has beenascertained, if in what precise ways remains unknown.Brownlee points out (Brow.1991.2), pp. 227–28, that Dante’s desire to seeBenedict in his flesh uncomfortably parallels Semele’s request to Jove, but thathe will see Benedict as though resurrected in the flesh in Paradiso XXXII.35.His story, unlike hers, has a happy ending.

[part0015.html#c22-s21-e] At some length Benedict corrects thesupposition that lay behind Dante’s desire to see him in his true humanresemblance. His conclusion, with its reference to Jacob’s Ladder and itsfunction as the connecting point between the rest of the timebound universe andthe unchanging Empyrean, brings his attention back to his monks, last heard ofat verse 51.

[part0015.html#c22-s21-e] This represents the last use of the word“brother” (frate) as a term of address in the poem. See the note to PurgatorioIV.127.See Carroll (comm. to vv. 61–63) for the notion that Benedict is gentlyreproving Dante for having called him “father” (verse 58) by insisting that theyare better considered brothers in Christ. Compare the desire of Pope Adrian Vnot to have Dante kneel before him in obeisance, since they enjoy a similarbrotherhood (Purg. XIX.133–135).

[part0015.html#c22-s22-e] Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 101, points out that,rather than redundant through some failing on the poet’s part, as somecommentators hold, these three adjectives reproduce a phrase in an apostolicepistle (James 1:4): “And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you maybe perfect and complete, lacking in nothing” (perfecti et integri, in nullodeficientes).

[part0015.html#c22-s24-e] The tercet puts into play, in case we havemissed it, the reference to Genesis 28:12: “And he dreamed, and behold, therewas a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. Andbehold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.” [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c22-s24-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c22-s24-i]]73–87. [part0015.html#c22-s25-e] Beginning with the foot of Jacob’s Ladder, asit were, Benedict now rounds on the current members of his order. Theirdegeneracy is reflected in the crumbling physical plant of the monastery; in theattempt to find some use for the cowls of the monks (since apparently those whowear them are few) as bags for flour; in the flagrant usury employed by them(quel frutto, the disgraceful “harvest” of their misguided lavoro). On this lastcharge, see Tozer (comm. to vv. 79–84), describing it as “covetousness inmisappropriating the revenues of the Church, which rightfully belong to God’spoor, to the purposes of nepotism and licentiousness. This in the sight of Godis a worse sin than usury.”Benedict’s remarks come to momentary cessation in the image of human sinfulnessquickly undoing even fresh and worthy initiatives, snuffed out soon afterinception.

[part0015.html#c22-s26-e] Christ, driving the moneychangers from thetemple (Matthew 21:12–13), portrays them as turning His “house of prayer” into a“den of thieves” (speluncam latronum), as was noted by John of Serravalle (comm.to vv. 76–78). Dante’s spelonche nearly certainly reflects that passage. [returnto English [part0015.html#c22-s26-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c22-s26-i]]85–87. [part0015.html#c22-s29-e] Oaks take a while to grow mature enough toproduce acorns—twenty years, according to Jacopo della Lana (comm. to thistercet) and Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 73–87). However, Dante seems to beunderlining the relative brevity of their acornless state. Sapegno (comm. tothis tercet) looks forward to a similar sense of the brief durance, there ofinnocence among us humans, at Paradiso XXVII.121–138. [return to English[part0015.html#c22-s29-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c22-s29-i]]88–96. [part0015.html#c22-s30-e] In the first of these three tercets, Benedictreviews high points in the establishments of communities within the Church: theapostle Peter’s first “papacy” (first century); the founding of his own order(sixth century); the founding of Francis’s (twelfth century). The reader has aclear sense that Benedict does not expect any major renewal in the Church. Andyet his speech ends with a curiously optimistic (and typically Dantean)reversal, in the promise of better days, with which his harangue comes to itsclose. If bodies of water could have been halted in their flow to let theHebrews cross to safety, as Psalm 113:3 (114:5) attests, that would still seem agreater miracle than if God were to intervene in the world now. In short, asunlikely as that possibility seems, its odds are shorter than they were for themiracles of Jordan and of the Red Sea. In Dante’s scheme of things, there isalways room for hope, a view that we will find again in Paradiso XXVII.142–148,in a passage that similarly surmounts a decidedly pessimistic view of humansinfulness with hopes for a better world in the near future.

[part0015.html#c22-s36-e] Dante apostrophizes us (for thedistribution of the addresses to the reader throughout the poem, see the note toInf. VIII.94–96) for the final time in the poem (as Tommaseo noted). Are we tothink it a coincidence that this last occurrence falls just before the first ofthe final triad of invocations, now to higher powers directly (God’s creativepowers in the stars and then the Deity Itself in Par. XXX and XXXIII)? It is asthough the poet is underlining the distance between human and divine experienceby leaving us behind. After Dante looks down through the planets, the next sighthe will see is the Church Triumphant, which we will see again in the penultimatecanto of the poem. For all of the next canto, for the last third of thethirtieth, and for all the final three we are seeing “face-to-face.”As the space travelers near their eventual goal, the time taken for the ascentfrom sphere to sphere decreases, since the “gravitational pull” of the Empyreannaturally increases as one nears it. [return to English[part0015.html#c22-s36-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c22-s36-i]]109–111. [part0015.html#c22-s37-e] The poet allows us to learn, inferentially,where his visit to the Starry Sphere has been situated by Providence, in “thesign following the Bull” (Taurus), and thus in Gemini, the sign under which, in1265, he was born and which shaped whatever genius he possesses. With Gemini theSun rose and set the day Dante was born in Tuscany; and now he comes to thisheaven in this constellation. (Singleton [comm. to vv. 127–154] cites aninteresting observation of Grandgent’s: “Thus, in a spiritual sense, [Dante]returns, like Plato’s departed, to his native star: cf. Par. IV.52–57.”) Fromthe stars of Gemini the poet invokes aid in acquiring the necessary capacity totell of the final things of Heaven, beginning in the next canto with theappearance of the “hosts of Christ’s triumph” (Par. XXIII.20–21). [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c22-s37-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c22-s37-i]]109–110. [part0015.html#c22-s37-e] The by-now fairly familiar trope hysteronproteron is used to describe the speed of their upward movement and attainmentof the next sphere. See the note to Paradiso I.23–26. [return to English[part0015.html#c22-s37-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c22-s37-i]]112–123. [part0015.html#c22-s38-e] Adding to the reader’s sense of the poet’sself-consciousness at this moment in his creation, this seventh invocation alsounderlines the importance of the visit to the stars that shaped his humanabilities. In Inferno II.7, when Dante invoked alto ingegno for aid, it is atleast possible that he was invoking God’s power to help him make his poem (seethe notes to Inf. II.7–9 and Par. XXV.2). Here, especially in light of theequation between God’s powers and that of the heavenly spheres suggested byParadiso II.9, Dante would seem to be aligning his own powers as a poet withthose specifically allotted him by God through the agency of the alignment ofthe stars at his birth, when the Sun (“he who is father to all mortal life”) wasunder the sign of Gemini. [return to English [part0015.html#c22-s38-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c22-s38-i]]121–123. [part0015.html#c22-s41-e] The actual invocation occurs only now, asthe first three tercets of the passage define the power of these stars and givethe nature and history of Dante’s relationship with them. What is the specific“daunting task” for which the poet seeks heavenly aid? Most commentators arecontent to see this as a general appeal, called for by the heightening of thepoem’s subject, rising above the realms in which Dante and we are allowed to seethe temporarily present souls of saved mortals and looking forward to the finalvision in the poem’s final canto. This seems a sensible view. (For a review ofthe varied [and rather vague or general] interpretations offered through thenineteenth century, see Scartazzini [comm. to vv. 122–123].) Del Lungo (comm. tothis tercet) offers a stronger reading, arguing that the specific appeal is madefor a specific reason: Dante in the next canto must describe the triumphpresided over by Christ and Mary. Indeed, in Canto XXIII the protagonist will beseeing “face-to-face.” And what he will see is the ultimate destination of thejustified portion of our race, the Church Triumphant, which will descend fromthe Empyrean in order to make itself visible to a mortal (for the first [andonly!] time in human history, we may embarrassedly consider). And thus thisinvocation is “special” for that reason. Having made it, the poet reports firston his downward glance, as he readies himself to see better things; the passagedescribing that vision will complete this canto. In the next, the intricateopening simile leads directly into the vision of the Church Triumphant, thefirst thing above him that Dante will describe after the invocation (see Par.XXIII. 19–21, Beatrice’s words, “Now look upon the hosts / of Christ in triumph,all the fruit / gathered from the wheeling of these spheres!”). It is with thisimmediate destination in mind that one might want to understand the “clue” tosuch an understanding found in Beatrice’s earlier statement, a few lines fartheron in this canto, at verse 124 (“You are so near the final blessedness”), as areference not to his eventual destination in the Empyrean, as most imagine it tobe, but in fact to this immediately proximate vision of the citizenry of thatplace in the next canto. In fact, the vast majority of commentators believe thepassage looks forward only to the last canto, drawn by the phrase ultima salute,for God, in Paradiso XXXIII.27. Only Trucchi (comm. to vv. 124–126) resists this“easy” solution, seeing that the presence of Christ in the next one is what isat stake.Of similar effect is Beatrice’s ensuing remark (vv. 131–132), encouraging Danteto look back to see how much heavenly territory he has already traversed, ajourney that makes him ready to appear before “the triumphant throng / thatcomes rejoicing to this celestial sphere.” In light of such indications, itseems more than likely that the invocation is meant to be read as a preparationfor that near-at-hand experience, not one some ten cantos distant.

[part0015.html#c22-s41-e] The phrase “passo forte” (daunting task) caughtBenvenuto’s attention (comm. to vv. 121–123). Why is it so? “Because,” Benvenutosays, “here is that which all things strive toward. In what follows [Dante]describes God’s Church in its triumph, with all the celestial court, includingGod.” [return to English [part0015.html#c22-s41-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c22-s41-i]]124–129.

She continuesby claiming that the Comedy uses both agricultural and navigational metaphors todemonstrate that poetry is more fitting than philosophy or theology toarticulate “the ascent to divine contemplation.” While her sense of Dante’shostility to Thomas is surely overblown, she is among those who realize that allis not peaches and cream in Dante’s presentation of his relations with Thomas.[return to English [part0015.html#c22-s42-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c22-s42-i]]124–126. [part0015.html#c22-s42-e] Beatrice is not so much admonishing Danteto prepare his eyes for such exalted vision as insisting that, trained as theyhave been, they are now necessarily ready for that vision, and will be so forthe duration of his visit to the rest of the heavens and to the Empyrean. Thisis to agree with Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet). For the sense in whichDante is at this moment near his “final blessedness,” see the note to vv.121–123.

The coinage is possibly to be taken as a verb of the firstconjugation, “inleiarsi,” to “in-it oneself,” that is, to make oneself one withsomething external to one’s being.

[part0015.html#c22-s43-e] Beatrice’s reference to the great extent of theuniverse that Dante can now make out “beneath his feet” reminds us again that weare still not sure whether we are meant to understand that Dante is in Paradisoin the flesh. While something like certainty awaits us, as will be made clear ina few cantos, here we sense a certain coyness. Beatrice may be speakingfiguratively, meaning “Look down beneath you, where your feet would be if youwere here in the flesh.” Or she may simply be saying, “Look beneath your feet,”feet that are really there, dangling beneath him in the heaven of the FixedStars.

[part0015.html#c22-s44-e] The word etera, literally translated, means“(a)ether,” in Aristotle’s sense of the “fifth element,” as understood by Jacopodella Lana (comm. to vv. 130–132), that which composes the “stuff” of which acelestial sphere consists and in which other bodies (e.g., the stars) arecontained. It is thus differentiated from both stars (and what we refer to asplanets) and nothingness (what we used to refer to as “space”).

[part0015.html#c22-s45-e] This remarkable passage is almost asinteresting in its antecedence as in its immediate progeny. There are similarscenes in Boccaccio’s Filostrato and Teseida; Chaucer visits both of these, inthe moment that is perhaps central to the understanding of his intentions forthe ending of the Troilus; and both writers evidently pay close attention toDante as well as to his and their classical precursors. While there continues tobe debate about Dante’s firsthand knowledge of the portion of Cicero’s lost Dere publica known as the “Dream of Scipio,” it really does seem to most thatDante knew this text (VI.xvi.16). On the other hand, there is and can be nodebate about his knowledge of the similar passage in Boethius’s De consolatione(II.m7.1–6), if that seems less directly resemblant. (Singleton [comm. to vv.127–154] presents both texts, with English translations.) In Cicero, Dante’sgreat Roman hero Scipio, appearing in a dream to his grandson after his death,speaks of this paltry world, seen from the heavens, in much the same tone as wefind here; in Boethius, there is a vision of this narrow earth.

[part0015.html#c22-s45-e] Some readers may benefit from a reminder: ForDante the seven “planets” circling over our earth are Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun,Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. All the stars are contained in the next sphere, theheaven of the Fixed Stars, to which point the protagonist has just now risen(see vv. 100–111). [return to English [part0015.html#c22-s45-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c22-s45-i]]139–150. [part0015.html#c22-s47-e] Dante examines the planets beneath hisfeet; these are seen in a somewhat unusual order and are mainly named by their“parents”: (1) Moon (daughter of Latona), (4) Sun (son of Hyperion), (2) Mercury(son of Maia), (3) Venus (daughter of Dïone), (6) Jupiter (son of Saturn), (7)Saturn (father of Jupiter), (5) Mars (son of Jupiter).Carroll (comm. to these verses) makes a helpful distinction between St.Bernard’s terms consideratio and contemplatio: “St. Bernard (De Consideratione[II.ii]) thus distinguishes: ‘Contemplation may be defined as the soul’s trueunerring intuition, or as the unhesitating apprehension of truth. Butconsideration is thought (cogitatio) earnestly directed to research, or theapplication of the mind to the search for truth; though in practice the twoterms are indifferently used for one another’ (Lewis’ transl.). Both words arebelieved to come from augurial rites: Contemplation, from com and templum, themarking out of a templum, or sacred space open to the sky; and consideration,from com and sidus (sideris) a star, or constellation, observation of thestars.” In Bernard’s language then, Dante is “considering” the stars;contemplation of God remains ahead of him.

[part0015.html#c22-s47-e] The reference is, obviously, to the Moon(Latona’s daughter, Diana) and to Dante’s earlier misprisions of the reasons forits differing degrees of brightness (see Par. II.49–51). Now that he is seeingher from “behind,” from the side turned away from earth, her surface is uniformin appearance.

II.xiii.25): “The heaven of Jupitermay be compared to Geometry because of two properties: one is that it movesbetween two heavens that are antithetical to its fine temperance, namely that ofMars and that of Saturn; consequently Ptolemy says, in the book referred to[Dante mentions his Quadripartitus in section 21], that Jupiter is a star oftemperate constitution between the cold of Saturn and the heat of Mars; theother is that among all the stars it appears white, almost silvery” ([italicsadded] tr.

[part0015.html#c22-s50-e] From his vantage point in the eighthcelestial sphere, Dante is now able to observe the relationships among the sevenplanets (see the note to verse 134) with regard to their varying sizes, thediffering speeds of their rotations around the earth, and the distances betweentheir ripari, that is, what medieval astronomers refer to as their “houses,” ortheir stations in the heavens.

[part0015.html#c22-s51-e] The word “aiuola,” frequently translated as“threshing floor,” is almost without a doubt, as Scott (Scot.2003.1) has argued,without the biblical resonance of Matthew 3:12 and Luke 3:17 that is heard bysome from the nineteenth century into our own time. He also believes that theword reflects its presence in a phrase found in Boethius’s De consolatione,II.7[pr], angustissima … area. Scott cites Kay (Kay.1998.1), p. 317, n. 22,glossing Monarchia III.xvi.11, where Dante uses the Latin equivalent of“aiuola”: “Latin areola is a diminutive form of area, and hence is ‘a littlespace’ ” (see also Pasquini [Pasq.1988.1], p. 439). (For the long-standing butfrequently overlooked knowledge of the reference to Boethius, see first Pietrodi Dante [Pietro1, comm. to vv. 145–150] and then Francesco da Buti [comm. tovv. 149–154], who are joined by several later practitioners, including Landino,Daniello, and Tommaseo. Longfellow [comm. to this verse] gets the Boethius rightbut is responsible [according to Scott] for the invention of “threshing floor”in his translation.) This rendering of the word has had a long run, but may infact still need winnowing. Scott continues: “Dante uses it here in this general,etymological sense, although often both areola and its Italian calc aiuola areused for specific small spaces, e.g. a flowerbed, seedbed, open courtyard,threshing floor, or even a blank space on a page [ … ]. Dante probably had inmind Boethius’s description of the inhabitable world as an ‘angustissimum[sic] … area’ (Cons. Phil. II.7[pr].3), which Dante echoed in Epist. [VII.15]:‘in angustissima mundi area’ [such a narrow corner of the world].”See Dante’s second use of aiuola at Paradiso XXVII.86.

[part0015.html#c22-s51-e] Because of the high-speed revolution of thecelestial sphere in which he is currently lodged, Dante is able to see all ofthe physical contour of our earth. He does so without particular enthusiasm, andis quick to turn his eyes back to the eyes of Beatrice, which are undoubtedly tobe understood as gazing up toward God and not down toward Dante’s (and our)paltry patch of earth.This passage inevitably leads a reader to wonder exactly how much time Dantespent in the heavens (and in the Empyrean). He left our terrestrial globe atnoon on Wednesday (either 30 March or 13 April in the year 1300, as the readerwill recall [see the note to Inf. I.1]). How long was he in Paradise? When didhe come “home”? For discussion, see the note to Paradiso XXVII.79–81.

[part0016.html#c23-s01-e] This warm-hued and extended simile opens acanto that has long been admired as one of the most lyrical of the entireCommedia. It contains more similes than any canto since Purgatorio XXX (whichhas seven) and Paradiso XIV (eight), by merit of offering seven in all (and twosimple comparisons). In contrast, the preceding two cantos together offered onlya single striking example (XXI.34–42). When one considers them, their burdenunabashedly religious and explanatory, one senses at once the differing registerintroduced by the presence here of affective poetry.The first nine verses of the simile portray a mother bird awaiting the dawn sothat she can find the food with which to feed her nestlings; the final tercetmakes the terms of the comparison clear: Beatrice hopes soon to be able tonourish Dante with a vision of the final and best thing knowable by humankind,eternal beatitude in the presence of God. Nonetheless, for all the resemblances(and few of Dante’s similes are as “neat” as this one) between mother bird andBeatrice, between soon-to-be-awake, soon-to-be-satisfied nestlings and Dante, wealso can see that there is at least one crucial difference here as well. In theimagined earthly scene, the physical sun rises in the east; in the reportedscene in the eighth sphere, the metaphoric “sun” descends from the zenith, asupernatural sun having risen at noon, as it were. Dante’s theologized“transvaluation of value,” so crucial a part of his strategy, especially inParadiso, following examples found in the teaching of Jesus, is observable here.What will the joys of Heaven be like? Like the pleasure of being fed, but havingnothing to do with eating; like the pleasure of the bride when her bridegroomcomes to her, but having nothing to do with sexuality; like the pleasure ofpossessing great wealth, but having nothing to do with money.See Goffis (Goff.1968.1), p. 838, for notice of Dante’s reliance here onLactantius’s De ave Phoenice, vv. 39–42, in the portrait of his mother bird, aswas first claimed by Enrico Proto (BSDI 22 [1915], pp. 72–73). This attributionis now supported by a number of commentators. The passage presents the bird atthe top of a tree, turned to where the sun will rise and waiting for its rays.Some have objected that the phoenix, as near-immortal bird, does not seemappropriate to this context and deny its presence behind Dante’s lines.Lactantius, who lived into the early fourth century, was imbued with theChristian faith, so much so that he was hired by the emperor Constantine toinstruct his children. It is not certain he was in fact the author of the poem;what is certain is that, as a Christian symbol (precisely of the reborn Christ),the bird, whoever was its author, is appropriate to the atmosphere of Dante’smoment, preparing for a vision of Christ in His flesh.

[part0016.html#c23-s01-e] It seems entirely fitting that a canto centrallydevoted to the mother of Jesus begin with this image of the selfless and lovingmother bird. Such is the retrograde nature of some commentators that they debatewhether this bird is meant to be taken as male or female. While it is true thatthe gender of the bird is not specified, and while male birds do indeed care fornestlings, the context of the simile and of the canto as a whole makes a fatherbird an otiose thought.

[part0016.html#c23-s01-e] The phrase dolci nati (sweet brood) may have itsorigin in Virgil, Georgics II.523, “dulces … nati,” in that glowing tableau ofthe bucolic life in the “good old days” of pre-Roman Italy. Indeed, as Boscopoints out in his introductory note to this canto, there are many classicalreferences peeking out at us from these lines, including that one.

[part0016.html#c23-s05-e] Dante, as nestling, must await his “food.”Like the subject it describes, delayed satisfaction both for giver andrecipient, the passage continues to draw out that moment of satisfaction, untilthe “sun” is finally described as having risen.

[part0016.html#c23-s07-e] While a great deal of preparation has led upto this moment (and it should now be clear that it is this moment thatnecessitated the invocation in the last canto), it is nonetheless a vastsurprise, once we realize that what has just occurred is a “visit” by the entireChurch Triumphant to the second of the heavenly spheres beneath the placeless,timeless Empyrean. There the object of their “visit” is no other and no morethan Dante Alighieri, “a Florentine by birth but not in his behaviors.” Thereare few moments in the poem, not even the final vision of the triune God, thatcome close to reaching the level of daring found here. The saved who dwell withChrist are thought of as the souls that have been harvested by Him (some in theHarrowing [see Inf. IV.52–63], slightly fewer than half of them later), in partbecause of the positive qualities bred in them by the stars at their birth.Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 104, suggests that the descent of these souls fromthe Empyrean may mimic that described in the Apocalypse (Apoc. 21:2), “And I sawthe holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, …”(descendentem de coelo a Deo).There has been and remains dispute as to who exactly comes down to be seen byDante. Some embarrassment is felt on the poet’s behalf had he wanted the readerto believe that all the saints in Heaven came down to greet him. Embarrassing ornot, that seems the only possible reading: tutto il frutto (all the fruit) doesnot allow for a more modest, gentlemanly selectivity.We are forced also to reflect that Dante has seen some of these souls before. Ifall of them now descend, their number includes all the souls since Piccarda whomhe has already seen in the various seven previous heavens.

[part0016.html#c23-s08-e] The by-now customary (and, within the poet’sstrategy, necessary) upward gradation in Beatrice’s joy as she gets nearer herGod may seem more justified here than at other times. She is now once more inthe presence of those with whom she shares Eternity; and now for the first timeshe is accompanied by her Dante. She is “home,” and escorting Dante to his homeas well.

For more on costrutto, see the note to ParadisoXII.67. Mattalia (comm. to this verse) explains that it means “the parts andelements of ‘discourse’ ” and goes on to suggest that, in De vulgari eloquentia,Dante refers to it as constructio, that is, the building blocks of language.[return to English [part0016.html#c23-s08-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c23-s08-i]]25–30. [part0016.html#c23-s09-e] The second simile in the canto compares theMoon, when it is largest and brightest, surrounded by the other astralpresences, to this “sun,” irradiating the host of the blessed. There can be nodoubt as to what this “sun” is. For here Dante is looking at (if unable to see)the living light that is Jesus Christ, like His mother, present here in theresurrected flesh worn, at least now, before the general resurrection, by themalone. Some commentators, perhaps puzzled by the strange and lone occurrence inwhich the assembled citizenry of the Empyrean descends as a unit to the netherheavens, believe that this “sun” is a “symbol” of Christ; however, we are meantto understand that it is Christ (see the note to vv. 31–33). Here is Jacopodella Lana (comm. to these verses) on this passage: “Or qui dà esemplo come lasubstanzia della umanità di Cristo, ch’era sopra tutti li predetti beati, lucevapiù di tutti, e tutti li illuminava, simile a questo sensibile sole, cheillumina tutti li corpi celesti” (Now [Dante] here gives an example of how thesubstance of the humanity of Christ, which was above all the aforementionedblessed souls, shone more brightly than all of them, and illumined them all,just as does this material Sun, which illumines all the heavenly bodies).[return to English [part0016.html#c23-s09-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c23-s09-i]]25–27. [part0016.html#c23-s09-e] For Trivia, the Moon, see Picone(Pico.1994.2), pp. 213–17. He insists on a source, not in Horace or Virgil, asis proposed by some, but in Ovid (Metam. III.138–252). Picone’s treatment ofDante’s interpretation of Actaeon resembles Brownlee’s reading of his Semele(see the note to Par. XXI.5–12); it is a subversive reading of the “tragic”original, in which Actaeon is torn apart by his own hounds. Now Dante/Actaeonfinds a better resolution.

Singleton, who on seven separate occasions in hiscomments to this canto insists that what we witness of Christ’s presence is notto be taken literally but “symbolically,” here (comm. to vv. 31–32) believesthat “Sustanza is used in the scholastic sense (substantia), denoting that whichhas separate existence, as contrasted with ‘accident,’ which is a qualityexisting in a substance. See Dante’s use of these terms in Vita nuova XXV.1–2.With this term the stress is rather on the human Christ. The whole vision issymbolic, however—a point not to be forgotten.” In fact “the whole vision” is tobe taken as the most “real” experience Dante has yet had, as any such seeing ofChrist in His flesh would have to be.

[part0016.html#c23-s12-e] In a single verse Dante culminates his long andvarying experience of Beatrice in this recognition of what her guidance hasmeant and where it has finally led him. When she came to him as mediatrix, onewhose being was imprinted by Christ in order to lead him back to his Savior, hewas often uncertain. Now the identity between them is finally sensed on hispulses, and he is properly grateful. This is a line that many readers findthemselves greatly moved by, without perhaps being able to verbalize the reasonsfor their emotion. It was amazing, he must reflect, that she had faith in suchas him.For an essay on the relationship between Beatrice and Virgil as Dante’s guides,see Punzi (Punz.1999.1). For the sense that Dante, here and elsewhere, hastotally revised his earlier and earthly sense of Beatrice, see Paolo Cherchi(Cher.2004.1): “This is the true praise. Beatrice loses nothing of her physicalbeauty; indeed, she remains the most fair among the fair. However, the‘diseroticization,’ so to speak, comes … from Dante, who comes to understand, ata certain point in his narrative, that the lady whom he desires is truly ‘venutada cielo in terra a miracol mostrare’ ” (come from Heaven to earth to reveal amiracle—VN XXVI.6).Masciandaro’s lectura of this canto (Masc.1995.1) demonstrates the importance ofaesthetic concerns throughout this particularly beautiful canto.

[part0016.html#c23-s14-e] The third simile of the canto compares theswelling lightning bolt, escaping from the cloud that can no longer contain it,and falling, against its nature, downward, to Dante’s mind, swelling with itsrapt vision of Christ, escaping from its “container,” and becoming other than ithad been.Dante’s meteorology (for this phenomenon Steiner [comm. to vv. 40–42] citesAlbertus Magnus, Meteor. I.iv.7) held that lightning resulted when contentionbetween fiery and aquatic elements within a cloud resulted in the fiery partbecoming too large and bursting the edges of the aqueous envelope, as it were.Theorists of the phenomenon were hard pressed to explain why this excess of fireshould, only in this instance, fall downward rather than follow its naturalinclination up.

[part0016.html#c23-s15-e] The noun dape (Latin dapes, viands), a hapax inthe poem, shows Dante’s hand once again being forced by rhyme.

[part0016.html#c23-s15-e] It seems clear that the author wishes us tounderstand that the protagonist, blinded by Christ, has had a Pauline (orJohannine) raptus.

[part0016.html#c23-s16-e] Dante’s vision has now readied him, if not tosee Christ in His splendor, then at least to be able to have a version of thatexperience with respect to Beatrice. Heretofore, she has made herself his mirror(e.g., Par. XVIII.13–18); now she invites him to see her as herself; in theprevious sphere (Par. XXI.4–12, XXI.63, XXII.10–11) he was denied her smile(which he last saw in Mars [Par. XVIII.19]). Now he possesses the capacity tobehold her true being, since his experience of the Church Triumphant underChrist has raised his ability to deal with such lofty things.As Brownlee points out (Brow.1991.2), pp. 230–31, this marks the completion ofthe “Semele program” in bono, Dante’s being able to look upon his “goddess” inher true nature. [return to English [part0016.html#c23-s16-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c23-s16-i]]49–51. [part0016.html#c23-s17-e] The tercet, while offering a simplecomparison rather than, strictly speaking, a simile (see, e.g., Par. XXII.2–3,4–6 for like phenomena), continues the similetic tonality of the canto. Here wefind another comparison involving a state of mind (see the note to Inf.XXX.136–141). We may be reminded both of Dante’s final vision of Beatrice inChrist in Vita nuova XLII and (if we have already read this poem at least once)of the final vision in Paradiso XXXIII. In both those cases, as here, there isat stake a visione that cannot be brought back to consciousness. In all threecases we are speaking of what is clearly presented as a true vision, not adream, even if here this is compared to an ordinary dreamer’s attempt to revivein himself the experience of the dream from which he has awakened. Our task asinterpreters of text is not made easier by the fact that in Dante’s Italian bothordinary dreaming and privileged sight of the highest kind may be signified bythe same word, visione. For an attempt to demonstrate how carefully Dantedeveloped and deployed necessary distinctions in his vocabulary of seeing asearly as in his Vita nuova, see Hollander (Holl.1974.1).In the last tercet the poet has used the verb vedere to register Dante’s visionof Jesus, the “sun” that is too bright for him as yet to take in; Beatriceinvites him to look upon her as she truly is (if he cannot yet sustain a visionof Christ). He had never before enjoyed, in the narrative of her presence in theCommedia, from Purgatorio XXX until right now, such beholding of Beatrice“face-to-face.” However, it seems probable that we are meant to consider thatshe was present to his vision in an at least approximately similar manifestationin the last chapter of the Vita nuova. And thus this moment is meant to drawthat one back to mind. There, too, Beatrice was a living soul in the presence ofGod.

[part0016.html#c23-s17-e] Poletto (comm. to vv. 49–54) notes that thishapax, the Latinism oblita (forgotten, faded from memory) is deployed in theEpistola a Cangrande (XIII.80). The context of that passage is perhapsremembered here: “This again is conveyed to us in Matthew, where we read thatthe three disciples fell on their faces, and record nothing thereafter, asthough memory had failed them (quasi obliti). And in Ezekiel it is written: ‘Andwhen I saw it, I fell upon my face.’ And should these not satisfy the cavillers,let them read Richard of St. Victor in his book On Contemplation; let them readBernard in his book On Consideration; let them read Augustine in his book On theCapacity of the Soul; and they will cease from their cavilling” (tr. P.Toynbee). Perhaps unsurprisingly, some of these texts (particularly those ofRichard of St. Victor and of Bernard) have been before our eyes in notes to thelast contemplative heaven. This portion of the Epistola (XIII.77–84) is a fairlylengthy commentary on Paradiso I.7–9. The context is supplied by theextramundane experiences of Paul and Dante, those uniquely favored humans whohad seen God in their ascent to the Empyrean.

[part0016.html#c23-s18-e] Beatrice’s “offer” to let Dante see herface-to-face, as she truly is, that is, blessed in the company of the elect, isthe greatest gift she has ever bestowed on Dante. Among other things, itpromises his own blessedness to come, for how would God sanction such a visionto a mortal bound to perdition?

[part0016.html#c23-s18-e] The language here, too, puts us in mind of theVita nuova, now of the opening reference (VN I.1) to Dante’s libro della miamemoria (book of my memory), in which Beatrice’s significant presences arerecorded. Strangely enough, because the self-citation does seem obvious,surprisingly few (ten) commentators to Paradiso XXIII refer to the Vita nuova asbeing focally present behind the phrasing of verse 54. Once again the first isScartazzini (comm. to vv. 52–54). [return to English [part0016.html#c23-s18-e] /Italian [part0027.html#c23-s18-i]]55–59. [part0016.html#c23-s19-e] Not even if all the most inspired (pagan)poets, inspired by all the Muses (led, in this consideration, by the oneassociated with sacred song, Polyhymnia), should come to Dante’s aid, would thatserve to reveal more than a tiny bit of the Christian truth he now saw inBeatrice.There happen to be in the poem nine invocations (no more than five of themaddressed to traditional Muses) and nine references to the Muses; see Hollander(Holl.1976.2), n. 3, who also offers an account of the inaccuracies ofMuse-counting from 1896 to 1973, from Scartazzini to Singleton. Since we haveknown for a long time of the importance of the number nine to Dante, such failedaccounting is surprising. But see Hollander’s belated discussion (in his laterversion of this article [Holl.1980.1], p. 32, n. 1a) of Fabio Fabbri(Fabb.1910.1), p. 186, who lists the nine invocations correctly.For this trope (nursing Muses) as it is developed in the (only slightly?) laterEclogues, see Heil (Heil.2003.1). And see Cestaro (Cest.2003.1), pp. 139, 162,166, for the Muses as nourishing in Purgatorio and Paradiso. [return to English[part0016.html#c23-s19-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c23-s19-i]]55–57. [part0016.html#c23-s19-e] It has become fairly usual (beginning withTommaseo [comm. to this tercet]) for commentators to cite Aeneid VI.625–627, forexample, Poletto (comm. to vv. 55–60): “No, had I a hundred tongues, a hundredmouths, and voice of iron, I could not sum up all the forms of crime, orrehearse all the tale of torments” [tr. H. R. Fairclough]. The Sibyl is herereacting to what she and Aeneas might have seen had they entered Tartarusinstead of proceeding to the Elysian Fields. Since we are seeing the inhabitantsof the Christian version of those “fields,” the passage in the Aeneid seemsdoubly apt.

[part0016.html#c23-s19-e] Polyhymnia is mentioned as one of the nine Musesby all the early commentators; most of them go on to identify her with memoryrather than a specific artistic form, as she is in handbooks today (with thesacred hymn). The first commentator to associate her with hymns was Andreoli(comm. to vv. 55–57), etymologizing her Greek name; with him she becomes, forthe modern commentary tradition, the Muse “of many hymns.” [return to English[part0016.html#c23-s19-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c23-s19-i]]61–63. [part0016.html#c23-s21-e] Read as literally as it probably should be,Dante’s remark indicates that his poem right now is “representing Paradise,” anddoing so for the very first time. That is why he required a preparatoryinvocation (Par. XXII.121–123) for this portion of the poem (now combined withan at least equally attention-summoning “non-invocation,” vv. 55–63). TrueParadise is found only, one may respond, after Paradiso XXX.90, once Dantebegins to see the courts of Heaven as they are. However, singularly andstrikingly, it is here, in the Fixed Stars, that he is allowed to see those whodwell there, whom he will see again once he himself has reached the Empyrean. Inthis vein, among many, see Goffis (Goff.1968.1), p. 826, referring to this cantoas beginning the “second part” of Paradiso. However, see Benvenuto da Imola, forthe kind of misapprehension that dogs him whenever Dante represents himself ashaving looked upon reality. Here is Benvenuto’s response to this tercet:“figurando il paradiso, that is, representing poetically, figuratively; for thispassage does not represent real things.…”Scartazzini (comm. to verse 61) documents the confusion caused by these lines:If “figurando il paradiso” means “representing [true] paradise,” that is, theChurch Triumphant, citizenry of the Empyrean (and that is not everyone’sunderstanding, if it seems to be a just one), then why does the “sacred poem”indeed “have to make a leap”? There is a fairly straightforward interpretation:The poem “overleaps” an intervening heaven, the Primum Mobile, in finding itssubject matter in those who inhabit the Empyrean. It is in that sense that he islike a man “who finds his path obstructed” and has to leap over the impediment.Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet) puts it into relationship with Inferno XXXII.9,where Dante is concerned with the difficulty of describing the bottom of theuniverse (here, with the top of it). There we find, immediately following thisexpression of concern, an invocation; here, immediately preceding an expressionof similar difficulty, a non-invocation. [return to English[part0016.html#c23-s21-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c23-s21-i]]61. [part0016.html#c23-s21-e] In the Commedia the word paradiso has only asingle presence outside the cantica that bears its name (Purg. I.99). Its firstclear reference to the Empyrean (rather than to the celestial regions ingeneral) perhaps occurs only in its sixth appearance, in Paradiso (XV.36).[return to English [part0016.html#c23-s21-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c23-s21-i]]64–66. [part0016.html#c23-s22-e] This is an “indirect address to the reader,”as it were; for the extent of the real kind in the poem, see the notes toInferno VIII.94–96 and Paradiso X.22–27.Daniello, Lombardi, Tommaseo, Scartazzini, Torraca (all in their comments onthis tercet) cite Horace’s much-quoted passage (“sumite materiam”) from his Arspoetica (vv. 38–41): “Take a subject, you writers, equal to your strength, andponder long what your shoulders refuse, and what they are able to bear. Whoevershall choose a theme within his range, neither speech will fail him, norclearness of order” (tr. H. R. Fairclough). Torraca reminds the reader thatDante had earlier cited this passage in De vulgari eloquentia (II.iv.4).The altogether possible pun on Homer’s name, unrecorded in the commentaries, inDante’s rephrasing of Horatian humerus (shoulder) as òmero mortal (mortalshoulder), since Omèro is Homer’s name in Italian (see Inf. IV.88), was noted inthe 1970s by Professor Janet Smarr, while she was a graduate student atPrinceton. That Dante may have for a moment thought of himself as the “ItalianHomer” would not come as a surprise. If he did, the profoundly famous Homer (seeHorace, Ars poetica 401: insignis Homerus), by any stretch of the imagination“immortal,” has an Italian counterpart in the very mortal Dante. For Dante’searlier reference to a Homeric being seeming like a god (and thus immortal), seeVita nuova II.8. [return to English [part0016.html#c23-s22-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c23-s22-i]]67–69. [part0016.html#c23-s23-e] This tercet, recapping the nautical imagerythat shapes the beginnings of each of the last two canticles of the poem, allowsus to realize that, in some real sense, Dante put forward this canto as aliminal space, at the border of the infinite, as it were. In that perspective,the text that follows directly after this one is the final third of ParadisoXXX, where we are again in the direct presence of Eternity.These verses pick up various thematic elements from earlier in the poem. For the“little bark” with its unworthy readers, see Paradiso II.1; for the Commedia asa legno, see Paradiso II.3; for the angelic steersman as celestial nocchiero,see Purgatorio II.43. We have progressed to that point at which the poet hashimself become the pilot who will not spare himself in guiding us to ourheavenly destination.Is this tercet a boundary stone for a “fourth part” of the Commedia, consistingin Dante’s experience of the Empyrean, begun here, only to be interrupted by sixmore cantos that take place in the last two spheres?

XXI.90) has not seemed problematic to thecommentators (it is a verb form meaning “I match” or “I equal”). Here, on theother hand, where it is a predicate nominative, it has caused traffic jams. Thevalue of the word in its two most favored forms (there have been as many asseven candidates at one time or another) is close enough that one may say thatthe difference is not worth a large investment of effort: Some sense of a voyageover an extensive piece of sea is what most think is meant, however they arriveat their conclusion. [return to English [part0016.html#c23-s23-e] / Italian[part0027.html#c23-s23-i]]70–75. [part0016.html#c23-s24-e] That the protagonist is looking upon theChurch Triumphant is beyond question, despite occasional shilly-shallying abouthow many of the saved are represented as having come down to be seen by Dante(since Beatrice’s words at verse 20 make it plain that all are here). Thequestion that remains is why the poet engineered this extraordinary scene. Thecommentators have not ventured an opinion, perhaps because they do not fullytake in what an extraordinary moment this is. It is simply amazing to find thatall the blessed have appeared in space and time, that is, in the Starry Sphereand before we enter the Empyrean. One might counter that this is similar totheir appearances through the spheres. But there they came as “emissaries” ofthemselves; now they are themselves (without, of course, their flesh), and arearranged as they shall be for eternity. For a precise understanding of thedifference, see Borzi (Borz.1989.1), p. 644: “Il Canto XXIII del Paradiso segnail passaggio dalla rappresentazione dei beati distribuiti, per ragionididattiche, nei sette cieli, alla visione di un Paradiso còlto nella realtàteologica della sua unità” (Canto XXIII marks the passage from therepresentation of the blessed souls distributed, for didactic reasons, throughthe seven heavens, to the vision of a Paradise caught in the theological realityof its oneness).

[part0016.html#c23-s24-e] The word giardino (garden), absent from the poemsince Purgatorio VI.105, where it was used in the phrase “the garden of theempire,” now, referring to the members of the Church Triumphant, reappears. Itwill do so again at Paradiso XXVI.110, where it refers to the garden of Eden,and then in XXXI.97 and XXXII.39, where it will signify the Empyrean, Edenregained.

The single rose, by common consent, isMary; the lilies, if with slightly less unanimous support, represent theapostles, leading humankind toward salvation in Christ (along “the right way”).See Jacopo della Lana (comm. to verse 74) on three reasons for identifying thelilies with the apostles: (1) because lilies are white (signifying faith),vermilion in their inner petals (signifying incorruptibility and charity), andfragrant (signifying preaching and hope).

[part0016.html#c23-s26-e] For a second time (see vv. 31–33), thebrightness of Jesus overwhelms Dante’s ability to look at Him.

[part0016.html#c23-s27-e] The precondition for this simile, as wefinally will realize in verse 86, is that Jesus has withdrawn, going back up tothe Empyrean. And so now He, as the Sun, shines through a rift in clouds andilluminates a spot of earth, representing, resolved from the simile, the host ofChrist’s first triumph (the Harrowing) and the souls of all those saved afterthat.

Perhapsnowhere else in the poem is this arrangement articulated so neatly, each elementreceiving one line in the tercet, but that is not to say it is not oftenpresent. See the note to Paradiso XII.9.

[part0016.html#c23-s29-e] Christ, addressed as His paternal attribute,Power, is now thanked by the poet for having made, by withdrawing, hisexperience of the scene possible. His overwhelming light, which is compared tothe sun being present only through a chink in the clouds (His “ray” thatilluminates the resplendent flowers in a field without blinding the onlooker byshining full on him as well), is thus only resplendent on the souls thatconstitute the “garden” of the Church Triumphant.

[part0016.html#c23-s30-e] This passage brings out emotional responsesin even hardened commentators, as demonstrated by a quick sampling of theirresponses to it in the DDP. And surely they are correct in thinking that Danteis revealing a personal trait, what a stern Protestant would describe, withperhaps an Anglo-Saxon harrumph, as “Mariolatry.” This is, nonetheless, one ofthe few touches in the poem that allow us to feel the presence of an ordinaryhuman being beneath the writer’s words (we often are allowed to share Dante’sthoughts, only rarely his doings), one who is occupied with the details of dailyliving, praying to the Intercessor before he descends the stairs in a stranger’shouse and then again after he climbs them in the evening (see Par.

Porena (comm. to vv. 106–108), however, deniesthat the angelic presence here is that of Gabriel, urging rather the candidacyof an unnamed Seraph.

The essential bliss hecalls the corona aurea, or simply aurea; and the accidental reward, aureola, adiminutive of aurea. All saints in the Fatherland receive the aurea, theessential bliss of perfect union of the soul with God; but the aureola, oraccidental reward, is given only to those who, in the earthly warfare, have wonan excellent victory over some special foe: virgins, martyrs, and doctors andpreachers [Summa, Supp., q. xcvi, a. 1].” [return to English[part0016.html#c23-s32-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c23-s32-i]]97–102.

[part0016.html#c23-s38-e] Trucchi (comm. to these verses) considersthis scene, surmounting those that previously reflected the Annunciation and theCoronation of the Virgin, a revisitation of her Assumption; as Carroll alreadyhad suggested (comm. to vv. 91–108), this scene represents “the heavenlycounterpart of the Assumption of the body of Mary, which, according to thebelief of the Church, God did not suffer to see corruption. Like her Son, sherose from the dead on the third day, and was received by Him and the angels intothe joy of Paradise.”It would be like Dante to have worked those three major episodes in her lifeinto his scene, the first representing her being chosen, the second her victoryover death, and the third her bodily Assumption into Heaven, a reward she shareswith her Son alone. The other commentators, with the exception of Carroll (comm.to vv. 109–129), do not mention it. [return to English [part0016.html#c23-s38-e]/ Italian [part0027.html#c23-s38-i]]112–114. [part0016.html#c23-s38-e] The poet refers to the primo mobile, theninth sphere, also known as the Crystalline Sphere (because, even though it ismaterial, it contains no other heavenly bodies in addition to itself).

[part0016.html#c23-s41-e] This final simile of the canto portrays thedenizens of the Empyrean, currently visiting Dante in the eighth heaven, asinfants reaching up with gratitude to their mommies who have just nursed them.We remember that, in the non-invocation (vv. 55–60), Dante referred to theMuses’ milk that had nourished classical poets (verse 57), whose songs would notbe much help at all in singing Beatrice’s smile. That milk is evidently incontrast with the one referred to here. This milk, we understand, is anourishing vernacular, one quite different from the Latin latte that is oflittle nutritional value for a Christian poet. (See Hollander [Holl.1980.2].)The word “mamma” has an interesting presence in this poem (see the notes to Inf.XXXII.1–9 and to Purg. XXI.97–99). It is used a total of five times, once inInferno, twice in Purgatorio (last in Purg. XXX.44), and twice in this finalcanticle (first in Par. XIV.64). Here it picks up on its last use in Purgatorio.It is always a part of Dante’s rather boisterous championing of the “lowvernacular,” and never more naturally than in this warmly affectionate scenethat represents the members of the Church Triumphant stretching upward inexpression of their love for Mary. [return to English [part0016.html#c23-s41-e]/ Italian [part0027.html#c23-s41-i]]128. [part0016.html#c23-s43-e] In the wake of Mary’s ascent, following Jesusback up to the Empyrean, the rest of the members of the Church Triumphant singher praise. From the beginning of the commentary tradition, with Jacopo dellaLana (comm. to this verse), the hymn “Queen of Heaven” has been identified as anantiphon sung at Easter, celebrating the resurrection of Jesus. (An antiphon isa responsive song, based on a psalm, sung by the congregation, after the readingof that psalm, which forms the text of the lesson at Matins or Vespers. Thisparticular antiphon was used in the eight-day period defining the Easter season,Palm Sunday to Easter itself.) Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) gives thecomplete Latin text, six verses, each ending with the cry of praise“hallelujah.” (For the English text, see Singleton [comm. to this verse].) Boththe third and sixth verses of the antiphon refer to the resurrection of Jesus;since He has recently (verse 86) Himself gone back up, we probably (and aremeant to) think of His first ascent, in the flesh then as now.

[part0016.html#c23-s44-e] In our translation, we have mainly followedCarroll (comm. to vv. 130–139), who has Dante turning from his admiration ofMary to “the heavenly treasures stored up in the Apostles. The metaphors, itmust be confessed, are somewhat mixed. The Apostles are at once the sowers orthe soil (depending on how we understand bobolce) and the chests in which theabundant harvest is stored. The harvest is not simply their own personal bliss,but the life and joy they have in the treasure of redeemed souls all round themin this Heaven, won in weeping in the Babylonian exile of earth, where for thiswealth, they abandoned gold.” [return to English [part0016.html#c23-s44-e] /Italian [part0027.html#c23-s44-i]]130–132. [part0016.html#c23-s44-e] Lino Pertile (Pert.2006.1) demonstratesthat many elements found in this canto are reprocessed in Dante’s first Eclogue,and goes on to hypothesize that this, the first modern European classicaleclogue, was written soon after Dante had finished working on this canto, andthat his reference, in the eclogue, to the ten “pails of milk” that he hopessoon to send to Giovanni del Virgilio, his poetic correspondent, are preciselythe final ten cantos of the Paradiso, a bold and interesting idea first proposedby Carroll (comm. to Par. XXV.1–12). [return to English[part0016.html#c23-s44-e] / Italian [part0027.html#c23-s44-i]]132. [part0016.html#c23-s44-e] The word bobolce, a hapax, one, more than most,the deployment of which is obviously forced by rhyme. See Enrico Malato,“bobolca,” ED I (1970), for the various interpretations. We believe that itprobably refers, as most of the early commentators believed, to the apostles as“sowers” of the “seeds” of the new faith.

[part0016.html#c23-s45-e] The first tercet of the concludingseven-line flourish celebrates the victory of the triumphant Church, seen forthe last time in this realm. There is no valediction for them, only celebration.Pietro Alighieri (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 130–136) was apparently the first (andremains one of the surprisingly few) to note the presence here of an allusion toPsalm 136 [137]:1: “By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept when weremembered Zion,” a text Dante himself had previously remembered in EpistolaVII.30 (as was noted by Poletto [comm. to vv. 130–135]).It is worth noting here (it will be unmistakably clear in Paradiso XXXII) thatDante specifically refers to the Hebrews who were saved (“the treasure / theygained with tears of exile, / in Babylon”). It will come as a shock to somereaders to learn that fully half of those in Paradise are, in fact, ancientHebrews who believed in Christ as their savior. (See Par. XXXII.22–24.)

In this heaven, he will share speaking parts withtwo other of the original disciples, James and John, as well as with the firstfather, Adam. Peter will speak in both Paradiso XXIV (eight times for a total of54 verses) and XXVII (an utterance in 36 verses and in two parts, both devotedto a ringing denunciation of the corrupt papacy).

[part0016.html#c24-s01-e] This verse/tercet is made up of “loaded” terms,the first of which is sodalizio: Jacopo della Lana says there are four kinds offellowship: in battle, “cumpagni”; on voyages, “comiti”; in business, “cumlega”;at table, “sodali.” For a likely “source” for Dante’s choice of the word eletto,see Matthew 22:14: “Multi enim sunt vocati, pauci vero electi” (For many arecalled, but few are chosen). For the phrase la gran cena, see Apocalypse 19:9:“Beati qui ad coenam nuptiarum agni vocati sunt” (Blessed are they who arecalled to the marriage supper of the Lamb) and Luke 14:16: “coenam magnam”(great banquet).

We have seen it once before (at Par. X.23). It has also been usedin De vulgari (I.iv.5) and in Epistle VI.24. All these occurrences are recordedin the entry “prelibare” by Antonio Lanci in the Enciclopedia dantesca (ED IV[1971]), which, however, omits the two occurrences in the Epistle to Cangrande(XIII.42 and XIII.46). Its use here may remind us of its presence there, whereit indicates the opening passage of the cantica, the foretaste of (or prologueto) what is coming.

[part0016.html#c24-s02-e] For the crumbs of bread that fall from thebanquet of philosophy, see Convivio I.i.10; is this a correction of thatpassage, substituting a better “meal,” communion in Christ, for the oneportrayed there?

They look like comets because they have tails of light; however, theyapparently maintain their circular orbits, that is, are not errant in theirmotions, as actual comets are.

[part0016.html#c24-s05-e] The simile clarifies the motion of these“comets.” Like the flywheels of a mechanical clock, some move more quickly thanothers; however, here greater speed is the mark of greater worthiness, as welearn from vv. 19–21.Among the earlier commentators, only John of Serravalle (comm. to these verses)perceives and expresses the precise resemblance between the simile’s tenor andvehicle. For him the circling groups of dancers and the flywheels are preciselyrelated in their varying grades of joy, their greater and lesser speedsrevealing their relative degrees of blessedness. He does not go on to observe,and nearly five centuries would pass until Poletto would do so (comm. to theseverses), that, since we are seeing the Church Militant, the circles that we areobserving here might well be the circles we observe there (in Canto XXXII), thatis, the “rows” in the round “amphitheater” of the Rose. In that case, all thosewho seem to believe that this circle contains only apostles need to revise theiropinion. The highest tier of the Rose contains Mary (Par. XXXII.1); John theBaptist (XXXII.31); Adam, Peter, John (as scribe of the Apocalypse), Moses,Anna, and Lucy (all referred to in XXXII.118–137). All of these, we must assume,are in that circling dance from which issues Peter now, and James and John inthe next canto. It is difficult to understand why Poletto’s understanding ofthese verses has not entered the discussion of them, which remains, as a result,maddeningly vague. See Hollander (Holl.2006.2).For a much earlier listing, which also refers to the population of the top tierof the Rose, see the note to Paradiso IV.29–30. In those lines we learn thatMoses, both Johns, Mary, and Samuel are probably there; the first four areindeed confirmed as being in the highest row by the text of Paradiso XXXII.[return to English [part0016.html#c24-s05-e] / Italian[part0028.html#c24-s05-i]]16. [part0016.html#c24-s06-e] The word carola (lit. “carol”) here refers to astyle of dancing. See Greco (Grec.1974.1), pp. 112–13, for the distinctionbetween a danza (dance) and a carola (reel), in which dancers in circles or instraight lines hand each other off to a next (temporary) partner. But seeLandino (comm. to vv. 16–18) for the most economical explanation: “Chosì quellecarole, idest anime che si giravono; proprio carola che significa ballo tondo,differentemente danzando, et per questa differentia dimostra più et menobeatitudine, et però dice mi si faceano stimare veloci et lente della suaricheza” (Thus were these “carols,” i.e., souls, turning. “Carol” signifies“round dance.” “Moving to a different measure” in such a way as to reveal moreand less beatitude; and therefore [the poet] says “made me gauge their gladness”by its wealth).

[part0016.html#c24-s07-e] From among the “dancers” and from the groupof them that was most joyful, evidently the one that includes the apostles, camea “flame” that was as bright as any other there. We perhaps need to be remindedthat Dante is beholding the Church Triumphant, minus Jesus and Mary. When weexamine the inhabitants of the Rose (Par. XXXII.118), we will see that the onlytwo apostles mentioned there (Peter and John) are in the highest rank in thatgreat stadium. Their situation here lends support to those who believe that thegroup set apart here is also apostolic. But see the note to vv. 13–18.

[part0016.html#c24-s08-e] Peter circles Beatrice three times, as he willdo again at the end of the canto (verse 152), on that occasion circling Dante.This number, that of the Trinity, is obviously auspicious. (Some latercommentators see it as the number of the three theological virtues; since Peterappears here as the representative of only one, Faith, that would seem a lesslikely reference here.) However, and as other passages will remind us, it isalso the number of times Peter betrays Jesus (see Matthew 26:34, 26:75; Mark14:30, 14:72; Luke 22:34, 22:61). This might not be a case convincingly made onthe basis of this verse alone; but see the note to vv. 124–126. [return toEnglish [part0016.html#c24-s08-e] / Italian [part0028.html#c24-s08-i]]24.

[part0016.html#c24-s09-e] Daniello (comm. to vv. 22–27) is apparently theonly reader of this canto to think of the context offered this scene by theweaving contest between Athena and Arachne. He does so in order to place thepainterly technique (the representation of folds in a garment) referred to herein an Ovidian context (Metam. VI.61–66). Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 26–27)was the first to make the now common observation that this verse describes theway a painter would depict the folds in a garment, by using darker colors forthem.

[part0016.html#c24-s09-e] Dante laments the coarseness of the art ofhis time (his own included), which is simply not up to the challenge ofrepresenting such delicate shadings, whether visually or verbally. What he doesreproduce is what Peter says to Beatrice, i.e., the words that he speaks afterhe has stopped singing. She, he reports, has loosed him from the sphere he wascircling in (see verse 11) and he, as a result, may serve as Dante’sinterlocutor. [return to English [part0016.html#c24-s09-e] / Italian[part0028.html#c24-s09-i]]31–33. [part0016.html#c24-s11-e] And now Dante does reassume his role asscribe, setting down the words that Peter uttered after he had finished his(unrecorded) song. No other section of the poem has more uses of the noun for“breath,” spiro, and the verb for “inspire” or “breathe into,” spirare (Par.XXIII.104, XXIV.82, XXV.82, XXV.132, XXVI.3, XXVI.103). The self-consciousnessof these lines is telling: Peter, inspired (the word the poet uses for hisbreath, spiro, is nearly surely intended to remind us of the spiration of theHoly Spirit), utters words that Dante, his scribe, can tell us (and just has).See the notes to Purgatorio XXIV.55–63 and Paradiso VI.88.

[part0016.html#c24-s12-e] From this tercet we realize that the“everlasting light” (we remember that this light was the most brilliant amongits companions in the Church Triumphant at verse 21) addressed by Beatrice isSt. Peter. For Jesus left the “keys of the kingdom” (Matthew 16:19) to Peter.

[part0016.html#c24-s13-e] Peter’s walking on water displayed his faith inJesus, but also revealed the tenuous nature of that faith when he doubts andbegins to sink, causing Jesus to castigate him: “O you of little faith” (Matthew14:28–33). And so here Beatrice is remembering Peter’s noble beginning andsuppressing reference to the far less impressive conclusion of the biblicalnarrative. See the note to vv. 124–126.

[part0016.html#c24-s14-e] Beatrice concludes her intervention onDante’s behalf by acknowledging that Peter already knows that her pupil passesmuster on the three theological virtues.

[part0016.html#c24-s14-e] The three verbs of this verse obviously reflectthe three theological virtues, Love, Hope, and Faith, in that order, as wasapparent from the very beginning of the commentary tradition (see Jacopo dellaLana on this verse).

[part0016.html#c24-s16-e] The medieval bachelor’s examination intheology, some elements of which still persist in oral doctoral examinations ina few fields at a few institutions in our day, is rehearsed here. A bachelor wasa candidate for the first degree in the field, just as today. The examinationwas administered by a magister (master); he certified the bachelor as beingworthy of entering the pursuit of the doctorate in theology, probably his owngoal as well. [return to English [part0016.html#c24-s16-e] / Italian[part0028.html#c24-s16-i]]48. [part0016.html#c24-s16-e] The magister intervenes, not to settle thequestion (quaestio, a formal exercise in debate in which the answer is known orassumed), but to formulate it—as Peter is about to do.See Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 47–48) for a full discussion of the dispute thathas followed this verse through the centuries. And see Tozer’s explanation(comm. to vv. 46–48): “The allusion here is to what took place in the mediaevalUniversities. The ‘Master’ is a duly licensed teacher, and the Bachelor astudent who is preparing for the office of teacher. The Bachelor at one stage ofhis preparatory course was required to pass through a form of examination, whichwas called ‘Disputatio tentativa,’ before a Master, who propounded the subjectof this (la question). Usually in such cases a number of opponents wereappointed to combat the candidate’s arguments (see Rashdall, The Universities ofEurope in the Middle Ages, vol. I., p. 466). In the present instance, however,this is not supposed to happen, and the proofs advanced lead up to a conclusionwhich is recognized as well established, so that the candidate has no need [to]terminar la questione. Similarly, St. Peter propounds the question, and Danteadduces what he considers to be the fitting arguments, but the conclusion isdetermined beforehand. The title ‘disputatio tentativa’ is probably referred toin the word tenta in 1. 37.” [return to English [part0016.html#c24-s16-e] /Italian [part0028.html#c24-s16-i]]52–111. [part0016.html#c24-s18-e] Tozer (comm. to these verses) divides theensuing “examination” into five parts, as follows: “The subjects of thequestions and answers in what follows are: (1) what faith is (ll. 52–66); (2)how Dante understands St. Paul’s definition of faith (ll. 67–82); (3) whetherDante possesses faith (ll. 83–87); (4) whence he derived his faith (ll. 88–96);(5) what is the evidence of the inspiration of Scripture, on which he bases hisfaith (ll. 97–111).” [return to English [part0016.html#c24-s18-e] / Italian[part0028.html#c24-s18-i]]52–57. [part0016.html#c24-s18-e] Dante turns to Peter and then to Beatrice,who signals that he should, in metaphor, “pour forth the waters” of his answer.As Grandgent was apparently the first to notice, the passage is possibly acalque on Christ’s words (John 7:38: “He who believes in me, as the Scripturesays, ‘From within him there shall flow rivers of living water’ ”). It isinteresting that here, as later (vv. 64–65, when he will turn to Paul for thedefinition of Faith), Dante never uses the words of his examiner to define thistheological virtue. It is all very well to explain (as does Carroll [comm. tovv. 52–66]) that Peter never offered a definition of it, with the result thatDante had, therefore, to resort to St. Paul. The question then remains (inaddition to the nagging question of Paul’s absence from the cast of characterswho perform a part in the poem), why did Dante choose to give Peter so prominenta role with regard to Faith? And, for the question of Paul’s importance toDante, see the last items in the note to Inferno XXXI.67. [return to English[part0016.html#c24-s18-e] / Italian [part0028.html#c24-s18-i]]56–57. [part0016.html#c24-s19-e] Cf. Inferno I.79–80: “Or se’ tu quel Virgilioe quella fonte / che spandi di parlar sì largo fiume?” (Are you then Virgil, thefountainhead / that pours so full a stream of speech?). Consultation of the DDPreveals that apparently no one has seen what seems a fairly obviousself-citation, perhaps because it would seem to have Beatrice promote Dante toVirgil’s status, making him, and not the Latin poet, a “source” or“fountainhead”; nonetheless, that is approximately what has transpired withinthe narrative.

[part0016.html#c24-s20-e] While this tercet would qualify, formally, asa true invocation, it is uttered by the protagonist rather than by the poet, andthus falls outside the set of nine authorial invocations (see the note to Inf.II.7–9); cf.

[part0016.html#c24-s20-e] “Centurion,” our translation, is the genericterm; Dante, however, uses a word that needs some explanation. Peter ispresented as the primipilus among “Christian soldiers.” The term refers to thestandard-bearer in the Roman army who throws the first javelin (primum pilum) inbattle. Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 58–60) was the first to say that theword was found in Isidore of Seville; he has been followed by several latercommentators. However, none offers a specific textual location for thedescription; furthermore, consultation of the Etymologies does not reveal anyeven promising leads. (Daniello [comm. to vv. 58–60] indicates a possible sourcein the Roman military historian Vegetius [cited by Dante in Mon. II.ix.3], inparticular De re militari II.viii.)

[part0016.html#c24-s21-e] Dante’s claim for the trustworthiness of eventhe writing instruments of sacred texts, clear from the phrase “the truthfulpen,” reflects his concern for that basic distinction between two kinds ofwriting, truthful and fabulous (i.e., historical and fictive), that runs fromone end of the Commedia to the other. [return to English[part0016.html#c24-s21-e] / Italian [part0028.html#c24-s21-i]]62–63. [part0016.html#c24-s21-e] Dante’s locution necessarily calls attentionto the fact that Peter did not in fact write about faith, a task that he leftfor Paul. See the notes to vv. 52–57 and to vv. 124–126. [return to English[part0016.html#c24-s21-e] / Italian [part0028.html#c24-s21-i]]64–66. [part0016.html#c24-s22-e] As Paul said (Hebrews 11:1): “Faith is thesubstance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen—that is itsquiddity.” Greco (Grec.1974.1), p. 120, reports that Aquinas, in his De fide,says that it is in fact the best definition of this theological virtue.We should remember that Hebrews 11:4–40 recounts the salvations, by their faithin Christ to come, of major Hebrew figures, from Abel to Samuel.

[part0016.html#c24-s24-e] Tozer (comm. to these verses) translates theprotagonist’s thoughts as follows: “Heavenly mysteries cannot be known on earthby sight, but are discerned by faith only; and as hope is founded on this, faithis the substance, or foundation, of things hoped for. It is also the proof ofthings unseen, because we are justified in arguing from faith in matters wheresight is unavailing.” [return to English [part0016.html#c24-s24-e] / Italian[part0028.html#c24-s24-i]]75. [part0016.html#c24-s25-e] Dante’s intenza translates the Scholastic termintentio (notion, concept).

[part0016.html#c24-s27-e] Peter approves Dante’s intellectual grasp ofthe doctrinal aspect of faith; now he wants to know if his pupil really has it,or is only talking a good game, like the sophist Dante seems to have convincedhim he is not.

[part0016.html#c24-s35-e] Peter persists in his testing of Dante’sfaith, asking whether it might be true that the argument from miracles is notverifiable, that is, that such argument is based on the truth of the propositionthat is being tested. (We may reflect that the obvious subtext here, for aChristian discussant, is the resurrection of Jesus.) [return to English[part0016.html#c24-s35-e] / Italian [part0028.html#c24-s35-i]]106–110. [part0016.html#c24-s36-e] Tozer (comm. to these verses) paraphrasesDante’s rejoinder as follows: “The reply to such an objection is that theconversion of the world to Christianity without miracles by men of no positionlike the Apostles would be incomparably the greatest of all miracles, and wouldbe in itself a sufficient proof of the divine origin of Christianity.” SeeAugustine, the final words of the fifth chapter De civitate Dei XXII: “[O]negrand miracle suffices for us, that the whole world has believed without anymiracles” (tr. M. Dods). [return to English [part0016.html#c24-s36-e] / Italian[part0028.html#c24-s36-i]]108. [part0016.html#c24-s36-e] For the word centesmo, see Matthew 19:29(another passage in which the authority of Peter may seem challenged; see thenote to vv. 124–126): “And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sistersor father or mother or children or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive ahundredfold and will inherit eternal life” (italics added). It was Peter’stroubling question (what shall he and the other disciples have for giving up thethings of this world to follow Jesus) that elicited that remark. [return toEnglish [part0016.html#c24-s36-e] / Italian [part0028.html#c24-s36-i]]111. [part0016.html#c24-s37-e] Gratuitous in terms of the argument being made(but thoroughly in keeping with what we expect from Dante) is this biting thrustat the Church, corrupted under (and, in some cases, by) Peter’s successors. Fora survey of saved and damned popes, see the note to Inferno VII.46–48. [returnto English [part0016.html#c24-s37-e] / Italian [part0028.html#c24-s37-i]]113–114. [part0016.html#c24-s38-e] “Dio laudamo” is of course the Italianversion of the Latin hymn “Te Deum laudamus,” which we heard intoned inPurgatorio IX.140, when the gate of Purgatory swung open (see the note to Purg.IX.139–145). And see Casagrande (Casa.1976.1), pp. 260–64, for the relationshipbetween all the Italian hymns of praise in the eighth heaven and the Hebrew wordof praise “alleluia.” Also see Brownlee (Brow.1984.2) for reflections on “Whythe Angels Speak Italian.”There is a profusion of hymns in this heaven: Paradiso XXIII.128 (“Reginaceli”); XXV.73 (“Sperino in te”); XXV.98 (“Sperent in te”); XXVI.69 (“Santo,santo, santo”); XXVII.1 (“Al Padre, al Figlio, a lo Spirito Santo, gloria”),including this one, six musical outbursts in all.It is curious that the commentary tradition is silent on the fact that the “TeDeum” is represented as being sung in the vernacular, surely connected to theItalian identity of the poet/bachelor of theology who has just concluded thecrucial part of his “examination” here. Further, the commentators, withoutdispute among themselves, either think that the outburst of the ChurchTriumphant celebrates Dante’s profession of faith or the triumph of theChristian faithful. Scartazzini/Vandelli (comm. to these verses) were the firstto suggest that possibly both are intended, as Momigliano (comm. to theseverses) concurs.

[part0016.html#c24-s39-e] Although verse 121 makes it plain thatPeter has accepted Dante’s profession of faith, it is also clear that he wantsthe new professor to expatiate on two points (they correspond to his first andfourth questions and Dante’s responses [vv. 52–53 and 61–66; and then vv.89–96]). Peter wants Dante to spell out precisely what he believes and exactlywhere he learned it. [return to English [part0016.html#c24-s39-e] / Italian[part0028.html#c24-s39-i]]115. [part0016.html#c24-s39-e] Peter’s baronial title will be given to Jamesas well (see Par. XXV.17). It probably reflects its use as the term of addressfor a feudal lord, as Mestica observes (comm. to vv. 115–117). Lombardi (comm.to vv. 115–117) reports that it was not uncommon in the late medieval period togive saints the titles of those who were indeed powerful in this world. Oneexample (of the two) he adduces is Giovanni Boccaccio’s (repeated) reference to“baron messer santo Antonio” (Decameron VI.x.9, VI.x.11, VI.x.44).

[part0016.html#c24-s42-e] Dante’s seventh response involves theexperience of Peter and John at Christ’s tomb (see John 20:3–8); Dante’s credoin God the Creator; his proofs: philosophical, theological, and Scriptural (fromGenesis to Peter’s Epistles). [return to English [part0016.html#c24-s42-e] /Italian [part0028.html#c24-s42-i]]124–126. [part0016.html#c24-s42-e] Here is a part of Carroll’s comment to vv.115–138: “That is, Peter sees now the risen body of Christ, concerning which hehad only faith as he ran to the sepulchre; but even faith made him conquer theyounger feet of John, who at the time had no faith in the Resurrection. Thedifficulty is that it was John who outran Peter and came first to the sepulchre.It is not in the least likely that Dante forgot this. His meaning undoubtedly isthat while the younger feet, through lack of faith, lingered at the entrance,Peter’s faith carried him past his doubting companion to the inside. (In De Mon.III.ix, however, the incident is given as an instance of Peter’s impulsivenessrather than his faith: ‘John says that he went in immediately when he came tothe tomb, seeing the other disciple lingering at the entrance.’ Perhaps Dantewished to retract his former judgment.) This does no injustice to John, since hehimself says it was only after he entered and saw how the grave-clothes werefolded up, that he believed (John 20:5–8). It is somewhat strange, however, thatDante should choose this incident as an example of Peter’s faith.”Is this more than a slight dig in the ribs for Peter? See the notes to vv. 22,39, 52–57, 62–63, and 108. The reader would do well to turn immediately toMonarchia III.ix.1–19, a diatribe against Peter as a stand-in for the papacy.Discussing the context of the passage in Luke 22:38, which was among thebiblical texts that the hierocrats used to assert papal authority over theemperor, Dante has this to say about Peter’s intellectual capacity: “Peter, aswas his habit, answered unreflectingly, only considering the surface of things”(Mon. III.ix.2); later (III.ix.8) he adds that, had Peter actually said what thehierocrats claimed he did, Christ would have reproached him for that remarkabout the two swords “as He did reproach him many times, when he replied notknowing what he was saying.” Dante continues in a similar vein (III.ix.9): “Andthat Peter was in the habit of speaking without reflecting is proved by hishasty and unthinking impulsiveness, which came not just from the sincerity ofhis faith, but, I think, from his simple and ingenuous nature.” Finally, havinglisted a whole series of Peter’s inadequacies, both as thinker and as loyalfollower of Jesus, Dante moves toward his conclusion: “It is helpful to havelisted these episodes involving our Archimandrite in praise of hisingenuousness, for they show quite clearly that when he spoke of the two swordshe was answering Christ with no deeper meaning in mind” (all these translationsare from P. Shaw’s edition). According to Carroll, this passage may serve as apartial retraction of those views. The reader has, nonetheless, to wonder whyDante should, if more circumspectly than in the anti-Petrine diatribe inMonarchia, be chipping away at the veneer of authority lodged in the man whom heconsidered the first pope. Is it possible that his widely represented distrustof particular popes prompts him to protest any emerging sense that a pontiff,because of his tenure in the highest ecclesiastical office, is necessarilywithout doctrinal error? See Bennassuti’s unintentionally amusing insistence(comm. to Inf. XI.8) that Dante could not have condemned Pope Anastasius II as aheretic because the poet believed in papal infallibility (Bennassuti, as apriest, should have known better, since this did not become a doctrine of theChurch until his own nineteenth century); as a result the reader is tounderstand that demons put that inscription on the tomb for Dante to read. Thisis perhaps one of the most extravagant misreadings of the text of the poem andof Dante’s intentions in a commentary tradition that is not deprived ofamusingly wrongheaded insistences on what Dante supposedly would never do.[return to English [part0016.html#c24-s42-e] / Italian[part0028.html#c24-s42-i]]130–132. [part0016.html#c24-s44-e] Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet)interpret what has proven to be a surprisingly controversial line as having twofocal points, the love on God’s part for His creation, the love on its part forHim.

[part0016.html#c24-s46-e] This verse repeats, nearly verbatim, Luke24:44, as was pointed out by Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 136–138). Jesus speaks:“These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, thateverything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalmsmust be fulfilled.” [return to English [part0016.html#c24-s46-e] / Italian[part0028.html#c24-s46-i]]137–138.

[part0016.html#c24-s47-e] Dante recites his credo in the Trinity. Hegoes on to say that his proofs for God’s trinitarian nature are Scriptural,without specifying where these appear. Somehow it does not come as a surprisethat Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 143–144) was the first to offer such a list:Matthew 28:19; John 14:16–17; II Corinthians 13:14 [see, instead, 13:13]; IPeter 1:2; and I John 5:7.

However, see Aversano(Aver.2000.2), pp. 113–14, suggesting that two passages in St. Luke may beconflated in Dante’s text, Luke 19:17 and (somewhat more convincingly) 15:20–32,the parable of the Prodigal Son. As Aversano admits, the connections may seem abit tenuous; however, as he points out, Dante’s gerund gratulando may pick upLuke’s two uses of congratularsi in this chapter (15:6 and 15:9), according tohim the only two uses of that verb in the Gospels.

[part0016.html#c24-s51-e] St. Peter now “laureates” Dante in Faith.While the phrase tre volte (three times) occurs on seven other occasions in thepoem, its first and last appearances are the only ones that occur in the finalfour verses of a canto, here and in Inferno XXVI.139. It would seem possiblethat this use remembers in bono that first occurrence, in which the ship ofUlysses spins around three times before it sinks. Here Dante is not beingpunished for his presumption, but rewarded for his faith.

[part0016.html#c25-s01-e] This passage is surely one of the most personalstatements Dante makes in the entire poem. However, it tends to causedisagreement, the central issue of which is whether Dante presents himself asvigorous in his hope for laureation or as sardonic about its likelihood. Asrepresentative of the first school of thought, which has its roots in Jacopodella Lana (comm. to verse 1) and, more vociferously, in the Ottimo (comm. tovv. 1–12), one might choose the recent treatment of Scott (Scot.2004.2). His“optimistic” reading (and it is a reading at least apparently in keeping withDante’s “hopefulness,” the subject on which he is being examined by St. James)is found both in Scott’s translation and paraphrase of these lines. In thefirst, he supplies the following (the square brackets are in his text): “If itcomes [and may it come] to pass that the sacred poem to which both heaven andearth have lent a hand …” (p. 98); in the second, he offers his eventual senseof the passage (p. 295), intrinsically denying to Dante a proper Christian senseof the contingency of all earthly things. Scott considers the two subjunctivesin vv. 1 and 4 optative, expressing “what the exiled poet longs for with all hisbeing, a burning desire that opens the canto dedicated to the theological valueof hope.”On the other hand, see, among others, Sarolli (Saro.1971.1), pp. 384–89,Chiarenza (Chia.1983.3), pp. 147–48, and Chiavacci Leonardi (Chia.1988.2), p.268, for appreciations of the contingent nature of Dante’s hope for laureationin Florence, which they find in the passage. Such an attitude is typified by aresigned tone rather than the hopeful one that most readers, like Scott, assignto him. A playful paraphrase in tune with this second view of the passage mightrun as follows: “Should it ever fall out [even if it seems most unlikely to doso] that I return to Florence [but those bastards will never allow me to comeback home] and then [perhaps equally implausibly] that those fools decide togive me the laurel [which Giovanni del Virgilio has already offered me if Iwrite a Latin poem for those sharing his dreadful Bolognese taste in poetry] ….”In such a view, where the first two verbs are circumspectly (and correctly)dubious, and thus in the subjunctive mood, the last two are triumphantly (andillogically) indicative (“I shall return,” “I shall take”). (The subjunctive ina dependent clause almost necessarily causes a reader or a listener to expectthe conditional [“I would return,” “I would take”].) Indeed, in one sense Dantealready has crowned himself (he allows St. Peter to be the agent of his heavenly“laureation” at the conclusion of Canto XXIV, an “event” he refers to in verse12). In this reading, the desired but improbable hometown laureation isrepresented as being both totally unlikely and as inescapable, were the world(and particularly Florence) only honest; thus the truculently aggressive tone ofthe indicatives. To summarize, to those of this persuasion, Dante seems to besaying, “Well, I do not think it is really likely to occur but, if I do make itback home, I’m going to take the laurel (since I deserve it).” It is notablethat Dante, on both occasions on which he considers the prospect of his ownlaureation (see Par. I.26, coronarmi [crown myself]), imagines the wreath, notas being bestowed upon him by some benevolent figure, but as being taken byhimself. (For this appreciation, see Mattalia [comm. to verse 9].)Scott (p. 296) observes that the vello (fleece) in verse 7 aligns Dante, as wellas with Jason, with the biblical prophet John the Baptist, that patron ofFlorence and figure celebrated by its Baptistry, who wore camel skins as hisgarment in the wilderness, his fleece. For the only slightly more widelyrecognized reference here, to Jason’s search for the Golden Fleece, see Sarolli(Saro.1971.1), p. 401, and Pohndorf (Pohn.1965.1), p. 189, the latter inparticular supported by Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 223–24. (It is a perhapssurprising fact that no commentator in the current version of the DDP seems tohave associated this vello with Jason, although their connection here seemsobvious.)

[part0016.html#c25-s01-e] We may do well to remember the offer made toDante by Giovanni del Virgilio, that he should follow his vernacular Commediawith a more worthy instrument of procuring the laurel (see the note to Par.XV.28–30), a Latin poem with a political subject. If the hypothesis shared byJohn Carroll and Lino Pertile is correct (see the note to Par. XXIII.130–132),Dante composed his answering eclogue soon after he was writing that canto. It isinviting to think that this insistence on his poem’s being, on the contrary,dedicated to sacred things, is a defiant answer to that invitation, even if thatmay stretch chronological possibilities a bit much. However, for Dante’s senseof a recent (1315) Italian laureation and its impact on him, see the note toParadiso IX.29–30. And see Hollander (Holl.2003.2), pp. 54–55, for the poet’shandling of the temptations of fame.Villa (Vill.2001.1) considers both the term poema sacro and the related phrase“sacrato poema” at Paradiso XXIII.62.This is the only presence in the poem of the verb contingere. For theoccurrences of the noun contingenza (Par. XIII.63; XIII.64; XVII.37) and theparticipial adjective contingente (Par. XIII.99; XVII.16), see the entries forthose terms, both prepared by Alfonso Maierù, ED (II [1970]). [return to English[part0016.html#c25-s01-e] / Italian [part0028.html#c25-s01-i]]2. [part0016.html#c25-s01-e] In response to this challenging verse, Pasquini(Pasq.2001.1, pp. 145, 147) moves away from the traditional exegesis, which hasit that the words cielo and terra both refer to what God has created, the twinsubject of the poem, as it were, heaven and earth. That is, he realizes that theverse is not about the subject of the poem but about its heavenly agency.However, while an improvement in one respect, his reading seems deficient in themain one. For what may seem a radical (but perhaps only a necessary) view of thematter, see Hollander (Holl.1997.1) and, for a similar view, Baranski(Bara.2001.2), pp. 393–94. Such a reading of this line has it that Danteinsists, however covertly, that the poem has two makers, God (the divine“dictator”) and himself (the human “scribe”). The notion that he thus portrayshis own hand writing the poem finds support in Rime CXIV.8, Dante’s answer to asonnet from Cino da Pistoia, in which he portrays his tired fingers grasping thepen with which he writes his own responsive sonnet.

[part0016.html#c25-s03-e] Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet) was perhaps thefirst to point to a passage in Dante’s first Eclogue, which is addressed toGiovanni del Virgilio, who had made a conditional invitation that he come toBologna to receive the poet’s crown there. In that poem Dante says (vv. 42–44):“Nonne triumphales melius pexare capillos, / et, patrio redeam si quando,abscondere canos / fronde sub inserta solitum flavescere, Sarno?” (Were it notbetter my triumphant locks should hide beneath the green their hoariness, erstauburn-glowing, by the ancestral stream, should ever I return to deck themthere, of Arno? [tr. Wicksteed and Gardner]). It seems evident that either thispassage is reflected in that one—unless, as seems less likely, this one waswritten after that one. In any case, it seems clear that Dante was much involvedwith thoughts reflecting both Mussato’s laureation in 1315 and his own desirefor that reward, whether before Giovanni’s goading offer or after it.

[part0016.html#c25-s03-e] In this use of the word poeta, we have theclosest Dante ever comes to calling himself “poet” outright, though he has beenissuing statements that all but said as much as early as Vita nuova XXV. Novernacular writer of lyric had ever used this term for himself before; it istraditionally reserved for the classical (Latin and Greek) poets.

See Rigo (Rigo.1994.1), pp. 135–63, for a complexmeditation on possible meanings of the poet’s putting on the cappello (“crown,”according to her, in the sense of “reward for accomplishment in poetry”), inwhich she advances the theory that it refers most significantly to Dante’sdesire to be given back his Florentine citizenship.

He wants to be “crowned” in the Baptistrybecause it was there he entered the Catholic faith. His belief in Jesus Christhas just now (Par. XXIV.152) been celebrated when his temples were thricecircled by St. Peter, named for the first time since his appearance in the lastlines of Canto XXIII.

For primizie (first-fruits), see James1:18: “Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we shouldbe a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.” James is speaking of all theapostles; here Dante uses his word in the singular to refer to Peter alone.[return to English [part0016.html#c25-s05-e] / Italian[part0028.html#c25-s05-i]]17.

[part0016.html#c25-s06-e] “St. James, to whose tomb at Compostella, inGalicia [Spain], pilgrimages were and are still made. The legend says that thebody of St. James was put on board a ship and abandoned to the sea; but theship, being guided by an angel, landed safely in Galicia. There the body wasburied; but in the course of time the place of its burial was forgotten, and notdiscovered again till the year 800, when it was miraculously revealed to afriar” (Longfellow, comm. to verse 17). Compostella, after Rome, was the mostpopular goal of pilgrims inside Europe’s borders. See Dante’s divisions ofpilgrims into three groups in Vita nuova XL.7: “palmers” (to the Holy Land),“pilgrims” (to Galicia), “romers” (to Rome).What was Dante’s knowledge of the distinctions between the two saints namedJames? Historians distinguish between James the Major (son of Zebedee) and Jamesthe Minor (son of Alpheus). For the undeveloped claim (and death has deprived usof such development) that Dante here deliberately conflates the two James, seeKarl Uitti (Uitt.2005.1), p. 650n.

XXIV.1–2, “the elect invited to / the glorioussupper of the blessèd Lamb”), thus tacitly rebuking the careless eating habitsof the freshly saved souls on the shore of Purgatory. There are only these threepresences of doves in the poem, each in a carefully turned simile, one to acanticle; it is difficult to believe Dante was not paying close attention totheir distribution and significance.

[part0016.html#c25-s10-e] Tozer (comm. to vv. 29–30) says that thepassages in St. James’s Epistle that are referred to are 1:5, “If any of youlacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, andit will be given him”; 1:17, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is fromabove, coming down from the Father of lights”; other commentators add 2:5, “Hasnot God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs ofthe kingdom?” Tozer continues, “It is to be remarked that Dante has here and invv. 76–77, by a strange error, attributed this epistle, which was written by St.James the Less, to St. James the Greater; the same mistake is found in BrunettoLatini (Tesoro, Bk. II, Ch. 8).” For the favor of Jesus, Grandgent (comm. to vv.32–33) offers the following: “Three of the disciples (Peter, James, John) werechosen by Jesus to be present, and to receive the clearest revelation of hischaracter, on three different occasions: at the Transfiguration (Matth. 17:1–8),in the Garden of Gethsemane (Matth. 26:36–38), and at the raising of thedaughter of Jairus (Luke 8:50–56).

[part0016.html#c25-s10-e] The Greek word “basilica” is defined by Jacopodella Lana (comm. to vv. 29–30) as Domus regia (royal palace).

[part0016.html#c25-s13-e] The plain meaning of this circumlocution isthat, at the invitation of James, Dante looked up at both apostles, since he hadat first lowered his gaze in respect. See Psalm 120:1: “Levavi oculos meos inmontes, unde veniet auxilium mihi” (I have lifted up my eyes to the hills,whence shall come my help).

[part0016.html#c25-s17-e] In the poet’s barely suppressed reference toDaedalus, Beatrice is portrayed as having done well in guiding Dante’spens/wings to such lofty flight. She now intervenes for him, answering James’ssecond question—perhaps because it would have been awkward for Dante to haveresponded, since his answer might have seemed self-praising.

[part0016.html#c25-s18-e] Mazzotta (Mazz.1988.2), p. 98, sees thispassage as confirming the pattern of Exodus as a model for the poem, as hasalready been made explicit in Purgatorio II.46. It also contains two (of onlythree) uses of the verb militare in the poem. We are dealing here with an armedexodus, a Christian militancy. Beatrice presents Dante’s claims to thetheological virtue of Hope. Inscribed in Christ, he has been chosen to come from“Egypt” to “Jerusalem” and to this vision before he finishes his militancy(Daniello [comm. to vv. 55–57] was apparently the first commentator to cite Job7:1 in this connection: “Militia est vita hominis super terram” [Man’s life onthis earth is a warfare]; it has since become fairly commonplace to do so).[return to English [part0016.html#c25-s18-e] / Italian[part0028.html#c25-s18-i]]58–63.

In Luke 4, Jesus readsfrom this chapter of Isaiah in the temple; when he sees that his words areoffensive he insists that “no prophet is honored in his native land” (Luke4:24), words that certainly must have seemed to the exiled poet to fit his owncondition as well.

This is what he has to say: “It isprobably meant to be the reversal of the incident in the Earthly Paradise.…There, when the Angels, pitying Dante’s distress, sang ‘In te, Domine, speravi,’they were promptly silenced by Beatrice—he had then no title to hope.

[part0016.html#c25-s33-e] The identity of the singer(s) of the words ofthe psalm is not given. The commentators are universally puzzled (if onlyChimenz [comm. to vv. 97–99] has the good sense to complain that Dante had leftthe issue unresolved and problematic). It is thus perhaps necessary to assumethat angels, whether in the ninth sphere or, as seems more likely, in theEmpyrean, are their source. The only human souls above them now are Jesus andMary. And while one cannot rule out the possibility that it is one of them thatwe hear (or even both of them), that does not seem likely, nor has anyone,perhaps, ever argued for that solution. And so an angelic voice or group ofvoices is probably an acceptable solution, but not one that there is consensusabout. However, the inhabitants of the “spheres” (circles) of the ChurchTriumphant are probably ruled out, since they are now here in the eighth heavenand not up above. It is as though whoever, singular or plural, is doing thatsinging were answering Dante’s Italian version of the psalm in Latin, as thoughto underline his acceptance as a hopeful member of the Church.

Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 133–135) are in accord with Porena.

[part0017.html#c26-s02-e] These lines bring back to mind a similar tacticon the part of Virgil (Inferno XI.10–15), where Dante’s olfactory sense must berested from the infernal stench before the downward journey into the pit may becontinued; therefore, Virgil, in order to pass the time profitably, offers his“lecture” on the order of the sins. Here, in response to Dante’s temporaryblindness, John will use the time to give Dante his examination on Love, whichbegins with the next tercet.

[part0017.html#c26-s02-e] Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 121, points out thathere the verb ragionare, so intimately connected with the phrase d’amore (andthus “to speak of love”) in Dante’s own and other amorous lyrics, here is put tothe service of discussing a higher form of love, the third (and highest) of thethree theological virtues (see Paul’s statement to that effect [that amongfaith, hope, and love, “the greatest of these is love”] in I Corinthians 13:13).(The verb is repeated in verse 21.)At the same time, it is necessary to keep in mind, as Scartazzini (comm. to vv.1–18) reminds us, citing Thomas (ST I–II, q. 65, a. 5), the necessary relationsamong Charity, Faith, and Hope. We may be tempted to conclude that, like thePersons of the Trinity, the presence of one of them implies the presence of theother two.

For the reference, see Acts 9:10–18, where Ananias, a discipleof Christ, is sent to cure Saul of his blindness. Once he does so, Paul beginsto preach Jesus Christ. This is thus the pivotal moment in the life ofSaul/Paul. While Beatrice, bringing back Dante’s sight, is thus Ananias-like,there is much less at stake here, and the comparison may seem at least a bitoverblown.

[part0017.html#c26-s03-e] The past participle, smarrita, of the verbsmarrire (to confuse, discourage, bewilder) is used to suggest Dante’s innerstate in Inferno I.3, II.64, V.72, X.125, and XIII.24 (see the note to Inf.X.125). In most of those situations, the protagonist felt sympathy for thedamned. Here, in the penultimate occurrence of the word to indicate his innerstate, his loss of the faculty of vision is not the result of his sinfulness,but represents only a temporary failing (a result of his remaining tendency tosee with carnal eyes?) in his increasing capacity to understand things divine. Afinal occurrence of the verb to indicate that condition awaits (Par. XXXIII.77);there it will refer to a rather different (and loftier) “confusion” on theprotagonist’s part.

[part0017.html#c26-s05-e] Getto (Gett.1968.1), p. 933, has observedthat this canto enters into an intimate relationship with the Vita nuova (seealso Brownlee [Brow.1990.1], p. 390). And these verses, more pointedly than mostin this cantica dedicated to Dante’s love for Beatrice, recall the physicalbasis of Dante’s first desires for her (and one also refers to the even clearersexual reference of that Virgilian reminiscence found in a similar moment, Purg.XXX.46–48, equating Beatrice and Dido). The language here is unmistakablyreminiscent of the language of sexual desire found in Dante’s lyrics (and inthose of other poets). Reassembling arguments made in her three previous essaysin this vein, Regina Psaki (Psak.2003.1) argues that Dante’s heavenly love forBeatrice conflates that early form of love in his present one. Opponents of thisview are accused of “cultural nervousness about the notion that sexual love maybe sacred” (p. 119). Nonetheless, it is difficult to believe that Dante wantshis reader to think that the old flame still burns beneath angelic clothing; andit is still more difficult to believe that, at least within the confines of theComedy, he would consider any form of extramarital sexual love “sacred.” [returnto English [part0017.html#c26-s05-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c26-s05-i]]16–18. [part0017.html#c26-s06-e] Dante’s answer is simple (at least it seemsso at first). Love “reads” instruction to him, as might a professor at theSorbonne. The poet’s word leggere refers to the practice of instruction intheology from which the word “lecture” derives (for a previous use, see Par.X.137); see Poletto (comm. to Par. X.136–138). Dante’s heart is instructed bythe Holy Spirit to love God.The problem for the reader results from the phrasing of the thought “whateverscripture Love teaches me in loud or gentle tones.” Since the precise meaning ofthis tercet is much contested, there are many instances of commentators whooutdo themselves in improbable readings (for a review, see Scartazzini [comm. tovv. 17–18]; his own attempt, however, leaves much to be desired with respect tothe last four words [o lievemente o forte]). To characterize them with the wordsof Origen, hurling invective at those copyists of the Gospels who twisted thesense of the text in order to arrive at a meaning of which they approved, suchcommentators are guilty of “perverse audacity” (see Ehrman [Ehrm.2005.1], p.52). However, see Carroll (comm. to vv. 1–18): “Much difficulty is made of thesewords, but the meaning is quite simple: ‘God is the beginning and the end of allmy love.’ The figurative form is taken from the Alpha and Omega of Revelation1:8: God is the entire alphabet of the sacred writings which love reads to hissoul—the scripture of the universe. Many meanings are suggested for ‘olievemente o forte,’ ‘with light voice or strong’: such as reason andrevelation, or human and Divine love, or God loved for Himself and for Hisbenefits. Dante’s own words which follow seem to me to give the answer. The loudvoice corresponds to the arguments of Philosophy and the assurance of Revelationin ll. 25–45; and the low voice to the secondary causes of love in ll. 55–66.But whether low or loud, God is the one and only object of love.” For adifferent view, see Benvenuto (comm. to this tercet), who interprets “lievementeo forte” as “easy or difficult,” a view accepted by Simone Marchesi(Marc.2002.2).For “Alfa ed O” Dante is of course citing John’s own words (Apocalypse 1:8,21:6, 22:13), as he has already done in the Epistle to Cangrande (XIII.90): “Andsince, when the Beginning or First, which is God, has been reached, there isnought to be sought for beyond, inasmuch as He is Alpha and Omega [Alfa et O],that is, the Beginning and the End, as the Vision of John tells us, the workends in God Himself, who is blessed for evermore, world without end” (tr.

[part0017.html#c26-s08-e] John asks the protagonist to go down to asecond level in his disquisition on this theological virtue, to put his answerthrough a “finer sieve.” However, and as Singleton (comm. to vv. 1–79) pointsout, “no definition of love is given in the examination, as it is with faith andhope. This serves to stress the fact that love is primarily a matter of thewill, not of the intellect. Dante is simply asked what he loves, and why.”[return to English [part0017.html#c26-s08-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c26-s08-i]]25–27. [part0017.html#c26-s09-e] Dante replies briefly but thoroughly,refining his first response (vv. 13–18).

Consequently, the Being whois perfect goodness must attract more love than any other object.” [return toEnglish [part0017.html#c26-s10-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c26-s10-i]]37–39. [part0017.html#c26-s13-e] To whom does Dante refer here? Aristotle isthe nearly unanimous opinion of the commentators, who are divided only about theprecise passage, whether in the Metaphysics, the Ethics, or On Causes(attributed to Aristotle during the Middle Ages), explaining how the spheres’love for the Godhead set the universe into motion.

It reports that God says to Moses (Exodus 33:19),“Ego ostendam omne bonum tibi” (I will make all My goodness pass before you).Perhaps the first commentator to deal with the context of this passage wasVellutello (comm. to vv. 40–42), noting that it continues by having God revealto Moses only His “back parts,” not His face. Apparently he was the onlycommentator to do so before Carroll, whose discussion is informative (comm. tovv. 19–45): “It seems to me difficult to believe that Dante, when quoting this,did not remember that God proceeds to say: ‘Thou canst not see my face: forthere shall no man see me and live.… Thou shalt see my back parts: but my faceshall not be seen.’ And, as I understand it, the passage which he takes from theNew Testament is chosen just because it is the fulfillment of the imperfectrevelation given to Moses.” Then Carroll turns to the less clearly identifiedsource: “It is taken from St. John’s writings, the particular reference beingmuch disputed.… Dante is thinking of all [of John’s writings] as oneproclamation of the secret of heaven to earth; and if so, ‘the beginning of thehigh heralding’ is the Prologue to the Fourth Gospel. Now it happens that theclosing words of the Prologue allude to this very fulfillment of the imperfectrevelation through Moses of which I have spoken: ‘The law was given by Moses;grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man hath seen God at any time; the onlybegotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.’ Theevident connection of this with the passage quoted from Moses seems to meconclusive. Moses saw the back of God; Christ reveals the ‘secret’ of heaven—thebosom of the Father” [Par. XXVI.40–45]. [return to English[part0017.html#c26-s14-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c26-s14-i]]42. [part0017.html#c26-s14-e] For Guido Cavalcanti’s version of thisstatement, see Vita nuova III.14: “Vedeste, al mio parere, onne valore” (I thinkthat you beheld all worth—tr. M.

Benvenuto begins the understandingthat this preconio is the opening verse of John’s Gospel, “In the beginning wasthe Word.” However, and as Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) argues, most of theancient commentators are of the opinion that the Apocalypse is on Dante’s mindhere; he follows them. It would have been hard to oppose the combined authorityof Benvenuto and Scartazzini; the former’s judgment (supported, as it was inthis particular, by that of Francesco da Buti) should perhaps have weighed moreheavily with the latter.

Depending onwhether the verb guarda is to be taken as a present indicative (as we translateit) or as an imperative strongly influences one’s understanding of the tercet.See, inter alia, discussions in Scartazzini, brusquely dismissive (if perhapsrightly so) of those who decide for the imperative, and Bosco/Reggio, morebalanced in keeping the options open (both in their comms. to this tercet).[return to English [part0017.html#c26-s16-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c26-s16-i]]49–51. [part0017.html#c26-s17-e] John now sets his third question for theprotagonist, involving the subjects of what draws him (by pulling him with corde[cords]) and what goads him (by bites of its denti [teeth]) toward God. Thereader may be reminded of the stimuli on the seven terraces of the purgatorialmountain, which featured (see, e.g., Purg. XIV.147) freno or richiamo (“curb” or“lure”). In Paradiso XXVIII.12, Beatrice’s eyes will be presented as the “cord”(in the sense of “noose”) that captured him.In response to Venturi’s complaint against the bitterness of Dante’s metaphorfor such a sweet feeling (love), Lombardi (comm. to verse 51) points out thatDante has always used harsh metaphors for love (presented as burning, wounding,etc.).

[part0017.html#c26-s19-e] Carroll (comm. to vv. 46–63) continues hisglobal explanation of this passage: “But [John’s] examination is not finished.‘The Eagle of Christ’ pursues the subject into its secondary causes. We come atthis point to the scripture which Love reads with a low voice (l.18)—thecollateral and subsidiary sources of charity, or as John puts it, the cords thatdraw, and the teeth that bite into the heart.” And then, interpreting the verses58–60, Carroll concludes: “In other words, the creation of the world and man,the cross of Christ, and the hope of glory: these are ‘the teeth’ with which thelove of God bites into his heart, for all are operations of that love. Yet it isto be noted that they are not ‘the interior act of charity,’ the clinging of thesoul to God, but only cords to draw men to the act.” [return to English[part0017.html#c26-s19-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c26-s19-i]]62–63.

[part0017.html#c26-s23-e] See Getto (Gett.1968.1), pp. 942–43,discussing Dante’s formula for concluding the apostles’ examinations of him onthe three theological virtues. These occur at Paradiso XXIV.112–114, XXV.97–99,and in these verses. Getto finds the three texts sharing the following earmarks:Each passage (1) is contained in no more or no less than a single terzina; (2)contains reference to Dante’s completion of his utterance; (3) cites the openingwords of the celebrative song raised at its conclusion; (4) includes somedescription of the quality of that song; (5) refers to those who sang it.Once again we find a Latin hymn (the “Sanctus”), which had become a part of theliturgy, performed in Italian (“Holy, holy, holy”).

See, for example, Inferno I.111, III.136, XXV.90, XXX.136–141, XXXIII.38;Purgatorio IX.11, IX.33–42, IX.63, XV.119–123, XVII.40–42, XVIII.87–88,XVIII.143–145, XXVII.92, XXVII.113, XXXII.64–69, XXXII.76–78; ParadisoXXXII.139.See Boyde (Boyd.1993.1), pp. 74–75, for an analysis of the “mechanics” of seeingin these six lines.

[part0017.html#c26-s25-e] The verb ab[b]or[r]ire (or, as we believe,ab[b]or[r]are)—and both forms (along with others, as well) are found withorthographical variants in the interpretive tradition—has caused a great deal ofpuzzlement. See Casagrande (Casa.1997.2) for a thorough study of the history ofthe problem, concluding that (1) the verb is nearly certainly the firstconjugation one, used by Dante twice in Inferno (XXV.144; XXXI.24); (2) itprobably, on the basis of observations found in Uguccione da Pisa, derives froma Latin synonym for balbus (not speaking clearly [see Purg. XIX.7 and Par.XXVII.130 and 133]) and here means “loses the power of speech.” Casagrande,following Porena (comm. to vv. 73–75), treats the form of the verb here asmetaplasmic, that is, believing that Dante, his hand forced by the exigencies ofrhyme, has switched conjugational endings (-ire) for (-are). Our translationaccepts the basic interpretation of Porena (as restated by Bosco/Reggio [comm.to vv. 73–75])—but does not accept the new reading proposed by Casagrande, forthe reason that the action resulting from Beatrice’s intervention is not thatthe protagonist can speak clearly so much as it is that he can see better (seeverse 79). Since what is revealed as the object of his eventually clear visionis still another soul, it would seem reasonable to argue that what at firstappears unclear to the protagonist is that “fourth light,” what turns out to bethe radiance of Adam.

[part0017.html#c26-s27-e] The totally unexpected “fourth light,” wehabitual readers realize, without surprise, is Adam. If we remember our firstreading, we probably recall our amazement at what Dante (who reports himself“stupefatto” [dazed]) has done, putting the first father before us for aninterview about Edenic existence.

[part0017.html#c26-s27-e] For the word stupefatto, see Aversano(Aver.2000.2), p. 125, citing Acts 9:7, all the more plausible as a reference,given the Pauline context of the canto (introduced at vv. 10–12). “The men whowere traveling with him [Saul] stood speechless [stupefacti], hearing the voicebut seeing no one.” Jesus, invisible, has called Saul to Him. Saul rises fromthe ground blind and is led by the hand by his fellow travelers into Damascus,where he will be cured of his blindness as the new man, Paul, by Ananias.[return to English [part0017.html#c26-s27-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c26-s27-i]]82–84. [part0017.html#c26-s28-e] The theological dimensions of this tercet arelarge indeed: God the Father created all things and then Adam, who gazes up athis maker with the love sponsored by the Holy Spirit. That love is made manifestin turn by the redemptive act of Christ, who has saved fallen Adam and some ofthose who were born in his sinfulness.

[part0017.html#c26-s29-e] This is an at least somewhat puzzling simile,equating Beatrice with a gust of wind, forcing the top of a tree down from itsnormal inclination upward. It then goes on to equate Dante with that treetop,regaining its natural upward direction once the gust has blown itself out. Themeaning is plain, but the negative associations that surround Beatrice seemstrange; nonetheless, the positive ones that accompany Dante’s desires to dosomething of which Beatrice approves eventually govern our understanding.[return to English [part0017.html#c26-s29-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c26-s29-i]]91–92. [part0017.html#c26-s31-e] Adam was, by tradition, thought to have beencreated by God as though he were thirty or (more usually) thirty-three years old(thus matching the years of Christ on earth). Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 91–93)remarks that the protagonist’s phrasing is not very kind, since it brings toAdam’s mind the appetite (for the apple) that caused his fall.On this passage see Moevs (Moev.2005.1), pp. 101–2, distinguishing between Adamas indeed ripe in himself, as he was made by God (and now again is), and thecreature he had mistakenly thought he could improve by opposing God’s will andstealing His forbidden fruit.

Of course, the same holds true for grooms, if with gendersexchanged. See Carroll (comm. to vv. 88–96), explaining that this verse is “anecho of St. Augustine’s City of God, XV.16: ‘Father and father-in-law are thenames of two relationships.… But Adam in his single person was obliged to holdboth relations to his sons and daughters, for brothers and sisters were unitedin marriage. So too Eve his wife was both mother and mother-in-law to herchildren of both sexes.’ ” [return to English [part0017.html#c26-s31-e] /Italian [part0029.html#c26-s31-i]]95–96. [part0017.html#c26-s32-e] The poet (and protagonist) play with theconvention established and embellished as we proceed through the last canticle:Souls in Heaven read the thoughts of others in the mind of God. That being true,the protagonist acknowledges, an unvoiced question begets its answer morerapidly, avoiding the time otherwise lost in verbal duplication. Adam himselfwill underline this point at some length (vv. 103–108). [return to English[part0017.html#c26-s32-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c26-s32-i]]97. [part0017.html#c26-s33-e] This line has caused confusion, even anger, and(perhaps consequently) flights of fancy. It was only with Lombardi (comm. to vv.97–102) that a commentator disagreed with the earlier commentators’ assumptionthat the covering was the creature’s own fur. Now almost all agree that theimagined animal is covered (if for a reason not readily discerned) with a clothof some kind. (Porena [comm. to vv. 97–99] would eventually draw on a childhoodexperience, when he once carried a cat in a sack, to suggest that Dante wasreferring to a similarly ensacked feline.) Torraca (comm. to vv. 97–102)suggests the possible reference to a caparisoned horse (if Pézard mainlyreceives the credit for Torraca’s in fact earlier observation), but then wiselybacks away from making any definite identification; he continues by reminding usof the highly similar similetic moment in Paradiso VIII.52–54, in which Dantecompares the glad soul of Charles Martel to a silkworm clothed in its ownglowing light. (And see the earlier and altogether similar appreciation ofPoletto [comm. to vv. 97–102].) This, one thinks, is assuredly the model for anyattempt at an interpretation; however, it is rare that the verse has beenconsidered in this light.If one wants to crown a particular exercise for its fervid imagination, onemight well favor Daniello’s opinion (comm. to vv. 97–102) of male horsessniffing on the wind the maddening odor of female horses in heat and shudderingthereat. In short, a number of animals have been called (including, in additionto those already mentioned, piglets, dogs, even birds [in particular, the hoodedfalcon]), but none has been chosen.

A goodly number of Dantists are firmly committed to the notion that theappearance of the poet’s name in the poem, his signature, as it were, occursonly once, as the first word spoken by Beatrice, in Purgatorio XXX.55. Such asthey are most grateful to Moore’s exertions, since there had been, before hisintervention, more than a few who were most eager to find “Dante” uttered byAdam, the first namer (see Genesis 2:19–20).

[part0017.html#c26-s36-e] Tozer (comm. to vv. 106–108) paraphrasesAdam’s remark as follows: “I see those wishes depicted in the mind of God, inwhich, as in a faithful mirror, the thoughts of His creatures are reflected;whereas their minds (and therefore your [i.e., Dante’s] mind) cannot know whatis passing in the mind of God, so that you cannot reach the same certainty.” Hecontinues as follows: “According to this interpretation, pareglio is asubstantive, meaning a ‘parhelion’ or mock-sun; from which sense—as a parhelionis a reflected or refracted image of the sun—it is taken to signify simply a‘reflexion.’ The literal translation, then, of vv. 107–108 will be—‘who makes[H]imself the reflexion of (i.e., in [H]im are reflected) the other things (and,in particular, men’s minds), while none of them makes itself a reflexion of[H]im ([H]is thoughts are not reflected in their minds).’ ” For an exhaustive(it contains more than fifteen hundred words) review of the word pareglio,which, if its general sense is understood, has caused considerable difficulty,see Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 106–108).

[part0017.html#c26-s37-e] Adam “repeats” Dante’s four questions: (1)How much time has passed since God put Adam in Eden? (2) How long did he residethere? (3) What caused God’s anger against him? (4) What were the languages thathe was given and that he developed? (This fourth question has been variouslyunderstood.)

[part0017.html#c26-s37-e] Dante’s “thought question,” intuited byAdam from the mind of God, included his reverent feelings toward Beatrice(unsurprisingly enough), who came to him in Eden, the very place that Adam lost,prepared to lead him on this great spiritual and intellectual journey. [returnto English [part0017.html#c26-s37-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c26-s37-i]]114. [part0017.html#c26-s38-e] The early commentators did not realize howproblematic (and how important) this verse is. It presents Adam as having twoseparate linguistic “pools,” each deriving from a different source, from whichhe first gathered and then formed the first human speech. It was Lombardi (comm.to this verse), at the early dawn of the “modern age” in Dante studies, in thelast decade of the eighteenth century, who first made the (fairly obvious) pointthat the first speaking task performed by Adam was to name the animals God hadjust created as sharers of his world (Genesis 2:19–20). What was the source ofthat language? That is, did Adam learn it or was it innate in him, put there byGod when He formed him from earth? Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 112–114) is (andcorrectly so) of the second opinion. Andreoli (comm. to this verse) appropriatesTommaseo’s words to this effect, but then adds an important piece of evidencefrom Dante himself (De vulgari eloquentia [I.vi.4]): “I say that a certain formof language was created by God along with the first soul; I say ‘form’ withreference both to the words used for things, and to the construction of words,and to the arrangement of the construction; and this form of language would havecontinued to be used by all speakers, had it not been shattered through thefault of human presumption, as will be shown below” (tr. S. Botterill [italicsadded]). Thus did Dante at that time account for the origins of humanvocabulary, of grammar, and of syntax; these all came directly from God and wereinherent in Adam (and Eve, we imagine, though Dante never pays any positiveattention to Eve as speaker; that is not something for which he considers herinteresting). It is Adam who will name Eve virago (“woman”—Genesis 2:23). WhatDante believed to have been Adam’s creative process in developing his God-givenlanguage by adding words to it may be apparent here: From the pre-Hebrewequivalent of Latin vir, implanted in him by God, he derived “virago” (for“woman”).While it is clear that Dante had changed his thinking, by the time he waswriting the Commedia, about the second part of this history of the language (thelength of time that the original Adamic speech survived—see the note to verse134), there is no reason to believe he had altered that first opinion very much,if at all: The first Adamic speech was given by God, but (and we will besurprised by this, as some today still are, even to the point of simply gettingit wrong) it was given as perishable. It was, as we shall shortly see, the core,or seedbed, of the first vernacular and, like all vernacular speech, doomed todie out to be replaced by other always changeful “idioms.” God gave hisUrsprache to Adam as a form, containing models for his development ofvocabulary, of grammar, and of syntax. Simultaneously, He granted him theprivilege of naming the animals himself. As a result, “dog,” “owl,” “lion” wereterms invented by Adam, not by God. The language that he got from God was thusimmediately, even if it first served as a model, in flux, a part of the mortalworld of becoming, as was, we shall shortly learn, the one word that we cansafely assume he got directly from his Creator, His name. This was “I,” butbecame “El” (again, see the note to verse 134). (For God’s changing His ownname, see Exodus 6:2–3: “I [Dominus] appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and toJacob, as God Almighty [in Deo omnipotente], but by my name the Lord [Adonai] Idid not make myself known to them”).For the word idïoma, which we have here translated “language,” but which seemsto be identified by Dante with vernacular speech, see the note to ParadisoXV.121–123, the passage in which it has its only other occurrence in the poem.On the language of Adam, see Mengaldo, “La lingua di Adamo,” ED (IV [1970]), pp.47b–48b; Imbach (Imba.1996.1), pp. 197–214.

[part0017.html#c26-s39-e] Tozer summarizes the rest of the canto(comm. to these verses): “Of Dante’s four questions, which have just beenstated, Adam answers first No. 3—‘What was the real cause of the Fall of Man?’(vv. 115–117); next No. 1—‘How long a time had elapsed from the Creation to thepresent moment?’ (vv. 118–123); then No. 4—‘What language did Adam speak?’ (vv.124–138); and finally No. 2—‘How long a time did he spend in the EarthlyParadise?’ (vv. 139–142).” [return to English [part0017.html#c26-s39-e] /Italian [part0029.html#c26-s39-i]]115–117. [part0017.html#c26-s39-e] Adam answers first the third question thatDante has put to him, a question that, as many commentators point out, reflectsthe gravest issue that Adam knows: his own disobedience, which cost him and allour race Eden. This is “paradisal” behavior that we witness here; what sinner inInferno would voluntarily recite his worst sin first (or at all)? There are afew exceptions, beginning with Ciacco (see Inf. VI.53), but most, as we saw, tryto avoid this subject.Hardly anyone dealing with this tercet recently (and this is particularly truewith respect to American Dantists, who are perhaps more drawn to Ulysses thanmay seem reasonable) fails to discuss the obvious “quotation” in the phrase “iltrapassar del segno” (the trespass of the boundary line) of InfernoXXVI.107–109: “… we reached the narrow strait / where Hercules marked off[segnò] the limits, / warning all men to go no farther.” Surprisingly, the onlyapparent mention in the commentaries collected in the DDP (but see, e.g.,Chiavacci Leonardi [Chia.1997.1], p. 728) is in Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv.109–117), referring to this passage’s relationship with the theme oftransgression, as embodied in the canto of Ulysses. However, cf. (among others)Iannucci (Iann.1976.1), p. 426; Hawkins (Hawk.1979.1); Brownlee (Brow.1990.1),p. 394; and Barolini (Baro.1992.1), pp. 49, 52, 58, 106, 108, 112, and 238,whose treatment begins with reference to Nardi’s consideration (Nard.1942.1) ofboth Ulysses and Adam as having trespassed boundaries.

[part0017.html#c26-s39-e] The last occurrence of the noun cagione(reason, cause), of its forty-six instances in the poem, is found here (and forthe penultimate, see verse 113). As the poem concludes, discursive reasoningyields to more intuitive forms of understanding and expression.The use of the noun essilio (exile) binds two other figures to Adam in havingshared this bitter experience, Dante and Virgil (who sees his afterlife asexilic—see Purg. XXI.18). It is not surprising to find “Virgilio” as its rhymein verse 118. [return to English [part0017.html#c26-s39-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c26-s39-i]]118–120. [part0017.html#c26-s40-e] For the first notice of Adam’s long life ofexile from God’s kingdom, first on earth and then in Limbo, see PurgatorioXXXIII.58–63 and the note thereto. See also the note to Paradiso IX.40 and tovv. 121–123, below.Eusebius (whose dates were the basis for Jerome’s authoritative Chronicon [whichserved most medieval encyclopedists, such as Isidore of Seville and Uguccione daPisa]) is credited by the more recent commentators (beginning with Lombardi[comm. to vv. 119–120]) as being Dante’s source for the 4,302 years betweenAdam’s death and the Harrowing.

It thus occurs slightly more than halfas often as that of Beatrice, which appears sixty-three times. (See the notes toPurg. XV.77 and Par. XVII.19.) [return to English [part0017.html#c26-s40-e] /Italian [part0029.html#c26-s40-i]]121–123. [part0017.html#c26-s41-e] Adam says that he had lived on earth for930 solar years (see Genesis 5:5). This means that he was harrowed (in a.d. 34)after 5,232 years (930 + 4,302) of sinful life, first on earth, then in Limbo,where his punishment was, apparently, to live without hope yet in desire. Atleast that is Virgil’s description of the suffering of him and his cosufferersin Limbo (Inf. IV.42: “without hope we live in longing”), and it certainly fitshim and all other damned pagans. But what of the Hebrew saints, like Adam?During their time in Hell were they equally without hope? Or, because theybelieved in Christ to come, were they in fact hopeful? Adam, however, does referto his time in Hell as being typified by “anguish” (verse 133). In short, thisis not an issue that Dante has chosen to confront, and we cannot say whetherDante thought that Adam and his eventually to-be-harrowed companions knew thatChrist was coming for them or not, or whether they even hoped that He would.Adam has now enjoyed 1,266 years of grace in Heaven. Adam’s years coincide, ofcourse, with the course of human life in general, 6,498 years along its road in1300. See the note to Paradiso IX.40 for one traditional estimate of the futureduration of human time. And see, for a fuller discussion of three views of thatfuture, involving the Platonic Great Year (36,000 years), a medieval variant ofthat tradition (13,000 years), and St. Augustine’s (possible) view that theworld will last seven millennia, the last paragraph of the note to Inferno I.1and the note to Paradiso IX.40 in the PDP. [return to English[part0017.html#c26-s41-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c26-s41-i]]124–126. [part0017.html#c26-s42-e] Pietro di Dante explicitly identifies(comm. to vv. 124–132) Adam’s first lingua as being vernacular speech. It wasextinct, this tercet insists, before construction of the Tower of Babel began.Many have realized that this is a direct contradiction of what Dante had said inDe vulgari (I.vi.4–7), where he specifically says that the first language wasHebrew and that it was spoken until after the construction of the Tower. (For astudy of the literary history of this topos, see Borst [Bors.1957.1].)From Genesis, Dante might have learned several things about the history of thelanguage that squared with his spectacularly idiosyncratic theory of thathistory. The tenth chapter teaches that Noah’s three sons (Japheth, Ham, andShem) each had children, and all these groups of progeny spoke differentlanguages (linguae); that is, the “confusion” was apparently in progress beforethe launch of Nimrod’s “unachievable” architectural project. Nonetheless,Genesis 11 begins with the earth still being of a single tongue (terra labiiunius), and this passage is what Dante “revises,” whatever justification hemight have thought he had found, in the previous chapter, for doing so. God putshumankind into confusion for trying to build the tower (and that is the versionfound both in Genesis and in De vulgari); in the Commedia, however, the resultof Babel is pre-Babelic. This is not the only time that we find Dante revisingthe text of the Bible to suit his own purpose. To seize on only one otherblatant example, found in a neighboring passage in De vulgari (I.iv.2–3), Dantedenies the authority of Genesis in making Eve the first speaker (God, he says,would not have wanted a woman to utter the first spoken word). And see hissimilarly high-handed treatment of classical text, e.g., of the Aeneid inPurgatorio XXII.40–41. Fortunately, there is a good deal of playfulness thatlies behind these otherwise numbingly troglodytic gestures; nonetheless, therethey are, and they are certainly challenging.

Mengaldo, “lingua,” ED (III [1971]),p. 661b, discussing the source of this verse in Egidio Romano, De regimineprincipum (III.ii.24): “It is a natural thing that man should speak, and natureteaches him to do so; but whether the speech should be German or French orTuscan nature does not instruct him. On the contrary, a man must himself learnit, either by himself or with the aid of others.” [return to English[part0017.html#c26-s44-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c26-s44-i]]132. [part0017.html#c26-s44-e] Daniello (comm. to vv. 130–132) makes theastute observation that Dante is here citing the first line of the poem inProvençal he composes and attributes to Arnaut Daniel (it actually derives froma poem by Folchetto—see the note to Purg. XXVI.140–147—“Tan m’abellis l’amorospensamen”). See Purgatorio XXVI.140. [return to English[part0017.html#c26-s44-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c26-s44-i]]133. [part0017.html#c26-s45-e] Adam dates the change in the pre-Hebrewvernacular as having occurred before his death at the age of 930. His words donot allow any greater precision than that.It is striking that we do not hear his name in this scene (we have heard it fivetimes in Inferno and Purgatorio). See Andrea Ciotti, “Adamo,” ED (I [1970]),pointing out that medieval Scriptural exegesis related Greek ’âdhâm to âdâhmah(“man” to “earth”), thus homo to humus. This would surely have been of interestto Dante, since it would tend to locate Adamic vernacular within the low style,Dante’s own (or so at least he chose to present it as being). [return to English[part0017.html#c26-s45-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c26-s45-i]]134. [part0017.html#c26-s45-e] This verse has been the cause of a great dealof confusion, as some of its interpreters are honest enough to admit.Scartazzini, after an exhaustive survey of the history of its interpretation,concludes with the notice that, while it is most embarrassing for a commentatorto admit such a thing, he has not resolved its problems. (For another noteworthyattempt to clarify [if not to solve] the problem, see Porena [comm. to thisverse].) The most enduring, among the several desperate stabs it has caused, hasbeen the following: Vellutello (comm. to vv. 130–138) was apparently the firstto claim that “I” was to be read numerically, as “one.” Another notion hasperiodically reappeared (after having been introduced by Scartazzini [comm. tothis verse]): “I” (or “J”) is the first letter of “Jah” or “Jehovah.” A muchrarer but still interesting proposed solution is only found as late as Trucchi’scommentary (comm. to vv. 133–138): Dante wanted “I” and not “El” because “I” (or“J,” the same character in his Italian) was the first letter of “Jesus.”Nonetheless, the formulation that “I” equals “un” (“one”) found favor, over theyears, with many interpreters (including several editors, who replace what is“I” in our text with “un”), beginning with Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv.133–142). Lombardi (comm. to this verse) was apparently the first commentator torefer to Dante’s earlier treatment of the nature of Adam’s first word in Devulgari; he also pointed out that Dante was (whether deliberately or not he doesnot say) in disagreement with Isidore, who had been plain that “El” was the namethat God was first called. That “I” is the number/name of God is a valid readingof this verse is reinforced by the presence of the same alpha-numerical pun onthe Roman “i” as “one” at Paradiso XIX.128.See Casagrande (Casa.1976.1) for a careful consideration of the problems of thisverse. He ends up linking it, through the commentary of the Ottimo ad loc., toIsidore’s eighth (of ten appellations) name of God (Etym. VII.i), ia, itselfconnected to the Hebrew word alleluia, as praise of God’s name. Hollander(Holl.1969.1), p. 144n., had previously argued for Isidore’s ninth name of God,the tetragrammaton, transliterated as ia ia, as being the text that Dante had inmind, as evidenced by the parodic reference to it and the sixth name of God(“Ego sum, qui sum” [I am that I am]) found first in the Siren’s self-naming(Purg. XIX.19), “Io son, io son dolce serena” and then corrected in Beatrice’sself-naming (Purg. XXX.73), “Ben son, ben son Beatrice.” (All of these phraseshave repetition as a common feature.)Hollander (Holl.1980.2), p. 128, returning to this subject, offers ahypothetical reason for Dante’s change of mind: The poet wanted to associate hisown vernacular Italian, in which the name of God coincides with Adamicpre-Hebrew vernacular, with that first of all vernaculars. And he might havecited (but in fact did not) the following passage in De vulgari (I.vi.2): “Forwhoever is so misguided as to think that the place of his birth is the mostdelightful spot under the sun may also believe that his own language—his mothertongue, that is—is pre-eminent among all others; and, as a result, he maybelieve that his language was also Adam’s” (tr. S. Botterill). This mocking ofboosters of their own inconsequential towns perhaps also conveys Dante’s ownhidden claim in the Commedia: Dante’s version of Tuscan is to be seen as in someway resurrecting Adamic vernacular, coinciding in the vowel “I,” which is thename of God in each. For a similar opinion, see Moevs (Moev.2005.1), p. 183. Andsee Paradiso XXIX.17 for the dative pronoun “i” referring to God.One might also speculate that Dante considered El as the name of God associatedwith Hebrew “grammaticality,” the written language of the scribes of the Bible;for this reason he must retract his earlier opinion (El) in favor of a truly“vernacular” solution (I). Further, we may reflect that when he considered thecontext of his remark in De vulgari (I.iv.4), he surely would have noted thatthere he had characterized Adam’s first word as an emotive exclamation, indeed acry of joy. The word I, which we have just heard Adam use in the preceding verse(“pria ch’i’ scendessi”), may sound and feel “vernacular,” while El may soundand feel “grammatical,” that is, like a language learned in school.

[part0017.html#c26-s45-e] God the Father had been stern with sinful Adamfor more than five thousand years; then his Son drew him forth from the Limbusup to the Empyrean. We hear nothing of the possibility of purgation forpre-Christian Christians and so must assume that in His triumph (Par. XXIII.20),when he harrowed Hell, He brought them straight “home.” Anything less charitable(i.e., a visit to Purgatory) would seem picky, wouldn’t it? And so here is aparadox: Some saved Christians, even most (and it seems likely that thisrestriction applies to all but the saintliest of saints), bound for Heaven mustpass through purgation, while the virtuous Hebrews who were harrowed by Christ(if not all the saved pagans—we do see Cato and Statius on the Mount ofPurgatory) apparently do not have to repay any of their sins on earth.

[part0017.html#c26-s46-e] The recognition of the Horatian source (Arspoetica 60–63) of these verses begins with Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv.124–129). Here is Horace, as cited, with a translation by Singleton (comm. tothese verses): ut silvae foliis pronos mutantur in annos, prima cadunt; ita verborum vetus interit aetas, et iuvenum ritu florent modo nata vigentque. debemur morti nos nostraque.… [As forests change their leaves with each year’s decline, and the earliest drop off: so with words, the old race dies, and, like the young of human kind, the new-born bloom and thrive.

[part0017.html#c26-s47-e] The question of the length of time spent byAdam in Eden before the Fall is not uniformly dealt with. On the other hand, andas Thomas Hill (Hill.1982.1), p. 94, has demonstrated, Dante is not alone instating that the first man’s innocence lasted only between six and seven hours,citing Petrus Comestor and Gulielmus Durandus as preceding him in this opinion.Dante obviously felt that the detail was of great enough interest to make it theclimactic, canto-ending detail.Brownlee (Brow.1990.1), p. 396, points out that this period corresponds more orless exactly to the amount of time Dante himself has recently spent in thegarden of Eden (see Purg. XXVII.133 and XXXIII.103–105). He might have addedthat Dante also spends six hours with Adam and his companions here in the StarrySphere (starting at Par. XXII.129). See the note to Paradiso XXVII.79–81. Andsee the similar observation offered by P. Sabbatino, L’Eden della nuova poesia:Saggi sulla “Divina Commedia” (Florence: Olschki, 1991), p. 99, pointing outthat Dante enters the earthly paradise on the sixth day of his otherwordlyjourney at the sixth hour of the day, while Adam, on the sixth day of Creation,fell at the sixth hour and while Christ was crucified to redeem fallen mankindat the sixth hour as well. Sabbatino’s observation of these numericalsimilarities is cited by Bognini (Bogn.2007.1), p. 82 (n. 32).

[part0017.html#c27-s01-e] In celebration of the completion of Adam’s“education” of Dante in the eighth sphere—where Dante spends six hours (see Par.XXII.152, XXVII.79–81, and cf. Adam’s six hours in Eden) and six cantos, thelongest time spent in any sphere—the entire consistory of heaven, first seen inParadiso XXIII.19–33 and 82–139, now sings the “Gloria” to the Trinity.Bosco/Reggio point out that the poem contains the “great prayers” of the Church:“Paternoster” (Purg. XI.1–24), “Credo” (Par. XXIV.130–41), “Ave Maria” (Par.XXXIII.1–21), “Te Deum” (Purg. IX.139–41; Par. XXIV.112–14), and “Sanctus” (Par.XXVI.69). Here once again the souls sing in Italian. It seems possible that theblessed and the angels use Latin when they sing to one another and that, whenthey sing of Dante, their language is Italian. For the songs heard in thiscanticle, see the note to Paradiso XXI.58–60.For Dante’s “drunkenness” see Jeremiah 23:9, “quasi vir ebrius” (like a man whois drunk); but see also, as Bosco/Reggio cite Consoli as noting, Vita nuovaIII.2, where Dante, upon first hearing Beatrice’s voice, was taken by “tantadolcezza, che come inebriato mi partio da le genti” (became so ecstatic that,like a drunken man, I turned away from everyone [tr. M. Musa]). He has come fullcircle. [return to English [part0017.html#c27-s01-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c27-s01-i]]4–6. [part0017.html#c27-s02-e] Insisting on his “drunkenness,” the poet nowsays that to the first cause (the singing) was added a second inebriant, whatseemed to him no less than a smile of universal proportions.

[part0017.html#c27-s03-e] The five conditions apostrophized by the poet(happiness, joy, love, peace, riches) are all usually associated with life inthis world.

IV.4). Bosco/Reggio (comm. toverse 9) cite Convivio III.xv.3: “[il desiderio] essere non può con labeatitudine, acciò che la beatitudine sia perfetta cosa e lo desiderio sia cosadefettiva” (desire is something that cannot coexist with blessedness, sinceblessedness is something perfect and desire something defective—tr.

[part0017.html#c27-s04-e] Peter, about to reenter the action as theprimus inter pares yet again, has his flame turn from white to red. Thepseudo-simile has it that Peter went from white to red as would Jupiter were heto exchange plumage with Mars; against those who find the figure of speech“strange” or “forced,” Chiavacci Leonardi (Chia.1997.1), p. 743, points out thatan ancient tradition of representation presented the planets as birds, with raysas their feathers. Scott, in his essay “Su alcune immagini tematiche di ParadisoXXVII” (Scot.1977.1, pp. 195–237), demonstrates the precision of Dante’sapparently forced figure: The just God (Jove) will demonstrate His justness byrighteous indignation (i.e., Mars-like—pp. 196–202).

[part0017.html#c27-s07-e] Peter looks ahead to the transmogrificationof every member of the Church Triumphant, reddening with righteous anger, whenhe unleashes his harsh words. Significantly enough, this is treated as occurringonly after his reference to Satan in verse 27. [return to English[part0017.html#c27-s07-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c27-s07-i]]22–24. [part0017.html#c27-s08-e] Despite Peter’s vehemence about Rome’scentrality to the papacy, it is good to keep in mind the observation of V. H. H.Green (cited by Scott [Scot.2004.1], p. 253n.), that between 1100 and 1304 (andwe should be aware of Dante’s insistence on the rightness of their being there),the popes were more absent from Rome than present, 122 years vs. 82 years.Further, for Dante, Boniface was both a bad pope and an improperly elected one.On either (or both) of those grounds, he may have considered the Papal See“vacant” in 1300, and thus felt he could represent Satan’s particular pleasurein Boniface’s improper stewardship. However, it seems likely that the passage isalso meant to reflect the scandalously long period between the death of Bertrandde Got, Pope Clement V (20 April 1314), and the election of yet anotherFrenchman, Jacques d’Euse, as Pope John XXII (5 September 1316). On the otherhand, it also seems probable that, to Dante’s eyes, if Boniface had left thepapacy “vacant” because of his various shortcomings, both of his successors, onehaving moved the papacy to France and the other having kept it there, had leftits true seat, in Rome, vacant. (Scartazzini [comm. to vv. 10–27] is of asomewhat different opinion, believing that Dante considered the Papal See“vacant” when John XXII, a simoniac pope if ever there was one, ruled theChurch; half a dozen more recent commentators are also of this opinion.)Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 22–24) was apparently the first to point out that therepeated phrase “il luogo mio” recapitulates Jeremiah 7:4, the thrice-repeated“templum Domini” (the Lord’s temple). He is seconded by a number of othercommentators between Poletto and Fallani, but then the commentaries go silent onthis ascription.Peter’s triple repetition, not quite unique in the poem (see the santo, santo,santo of Par. XXVI.69), is nonetheless notable, perhaps reminding the reader ofthe Trinity as well as of the triple-tiered tiara worn by the pope.

[part0017.html#c27-s09-e] For a discussion of this penultimate, ifintrinsic, assault on Boniface, see Massimo Seriacopi (Seri.2003.1), pp. 220–25.The author goes on to describe Dante’s general attitude toward this great figurein the history of the papacy as follows: “[Boniface is to Dante] at once thepope and a simoniac; magnificent and yet obtuse; full of energy but arrogant”(p. 226). His book concludes with a helpful review of the varying views ofBoniface, found in Dante’s margins, put forward by the fourteenth-centurycommentators (pp. 239–57). For a papal attempt (that of Benedict XV in 1921) tosquare Dante’s poem with the Church’s teaching, see Maria Lorena Burlot(Burl.2003.1), p. 551.

(See Grandgent [comm. to verse28].) That blush fits the context of the blush of shame attributed to Beatricein verse 34.

[part0017.html#c27-s11-e] D’Ancona (Danc.1913.1), p. 460, was among thefirst to insist (see Steiner [comm. to vv. 31–34], in disagreement) thatBeatrice went pale, that is, did not grow red with indignation. (But seePoletto’s [comm. to vv. 31–34] earlier report of Giuliani’s still earlier andsimilar interpretation, which he, similarly, does not accept.) This view has,nonetheless, been followed by a number of twentieth-century Dantists. But seeScott (Scot.1977.1), p. 209, for a rebuke of those who so argue. And seeBosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 28–36) for a view similar to his; however, they go onto argue that the reference to the eclipse at Christ’s Passion (see Matthew27:45) reflects not only her darkening, but that of all the saints of the ChurchTriumphant temporarily gathered here.

[part0017.html#c27-s11-e] What probably makes the passage more difficultthan it really should be is the adjective timido, understood by the earlycommentators as “ashamed” (a word readily associated with blushing), whilemodern ones think it means “timid” (an adjective more likely associated withfacial pallor). The last seems a less likely significance, given the context.[return to English [part0017.html#c27-s11-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c27-s11-i]]37–39. [part0017.html#c27-s13-e] Peter’s voice (vv. 19–27) was, we may besurprised to learn, not as angry in that utterance as it is soon to be. When weread back over the passage (vv. 19–39), we realize that the poet has carefullystaged the development of this scene: (1) preparation for the change in color(vv. 19–21); (2) the occurrence of that change (vv. 28–36); (3) the furtherchange in the quality of Peter’s voice (vv. 37–39). Cf. Dante’s own two-stage“drunkenness” in vv. 1–6, first at a sound, then at a sight. Here Petermodulates his appearance first, and then his voice.

[part0017.html#c27-s14-e] Peter begins a list of some martyred popeswith himself; he refers to or names six others in all. These may be broken downinto three pairs, one from each of the first three centuries of the Church’slife (Linus and Cletus, Sixtus and Pius, Calixtus and Urban).

[part0017.html#c27-s16-e] Christ will come in judgment and divide hisflock into sheep (those who are saved) and goats (those eternally damned). Thesitting pope (in 1300, Boniface VIII) is charged with dividing his people intotwo political factions, the Guelphs loyal to him (his sheep) and his Ghibellineenemies (the goats). This does not mean that Dante limited his list of papaloffenders in this respect to one. [return to English [part0017.html#c27-s16-e] /Italian [part0029.html#c27-s16-i]]49–51. [part0017.html#c27-s17-e] The first four of Peter’s complaints (vv.40–54) about papal misconduct seem both generalizable and yet specific toBoniface’s reign (1294–1303). The papacy was often portrayed by Dante as usingits temporal power incorrectly; this passage may particularly rememberBoniface’s “crusade” against the Colonna family, already alluded to in InfernoXXVII.85–90, as Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 49–54) was the first to suggest.

See Matthew 7:15 for the warning against wolves in sheep’s clothing,applied to those priests who betray their calling (and their parishioners).See Marietti (Mari.2003.1), pp. 435–40, for the way in which Dante considershimself a descendant of the prophet Jeremiah here and throughout the Comedy. Andsee Sapegno (comm. to these verses) for a citation of the prophet’s outcryagainst those shepherds who harm their flocks (Jeremiah 23:1).

XIX.79–87) and John XXII (1316–34) of Cahors (forthat city’s association with usury, see the note to Inf. XI.46–51), will attemptto gather wealth from the Church founded by the blood of the first martyredpopes, representing the good beginning that will have so foul an end. [return toEnglish [part0017.html#c27-s20-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c27-s20-i]]61–63. [part0017.html#c27-s21-e] A first prophetic utterance, leading into thefuller prophecy at the end of the canto (vv. 142–148): Providence, which sidedwith Scipio (in 202 b.c. at the battle of Zama) to maintain Rome’s glory in theworld (and it is clear that the text refers to imperial, and not ecclesiastical,Rome), will soon act to set things straight, as Peter conceives (for the forceof this verb, see the notes to Inf. II.7–9, Inf. XXXII.1–9, and Purg.XXIX.37–42).For Dante’s lofty sense of Scipio, see Hollander and Rossi (Holl.1986.1), pp.65–69. For his persistent presence in Convivio (IV.v), Monarchia (II.ix), andCommedia (Inf. XXXI, Purg. XXIX, Par. VI, and here), see the table(Holl.1986.1), p. 75, also listing the various appearances of the dozen and ahalf republican heroes referred to in Dante’s works.It is surely striking that, at the climax of his antipapal outburst, he turns toa great political figure and not to a religious one. For an earlier and moredeveloped presentation of this view, see Scott (Scot.1977.1), pp. 216–20. Asimilar political frame of reference may inform Beatrice’s prophecy of thefortuna (verse 145) at the end of the canto. [return to English[part0017.html#c27-s21-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c27-s21-i]]64–66. [part0017.html#c27-s22-e] These are the last words spoken by anycharacter in the poem, except for Dante, Beatrice, and Bernard. Peter joinsthose who charge mortal Dante with his prophetic task, Beatrice (Purg.XXXII.103–105; XXXIII.52–57) and Cacciaguida (Par. XVII.124–142), thus makingthreefold the source of the poet’s authority to reveal his vision. Thisrepresents his final investiture in his role as God’s prophet.Peter’s flat-out acknowledgment that Dante is here in his flesh finally setsthat question to rest. See previous discussions in the notes to Paradiso I.73,II.37–45, and XXII.129. [return to English [part0017.html#c27-s22-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c27-s22-i]]67–72. [part0017.html#c27-s23-e] The Sun is in Capricorn (the Goat) in lateDecember and the first two-thirds of January, when we earthlings may wellwitness snowflakes falling downward through the air. Just so did Dante see thesouls in whom the celestial Rose consists making their way back up (and thusthrough the Primum Mobile) to the Empyrean. This is not, as we may first think,a reversal of gravity. The celestial pull is the obverse of the terrestrial one,upward toward God. They are snowing themselves back home. They have been awaysince Paradiso XXIII.19, more than five hundred verses in five cantos, and forroughly the same six hours that Dante has spent here.Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 67–68) was apparently the first to cite as “source”the upside-down “rain of manna” of angels returning to Heaven in Vita nuovaXXIII.25, in the canzone “Donna pietosa e di novella etate.” The context of thatcentral poem (sixteenth of thirty-one poems in all, second of three canzoni) is,however, the opposite of this passage, for in it Dante imagines the death ofBeatrice, and does so in human, tragic terms. Here, Beatrice is very much alive,watching as her companions in beatitude joyfully return to their immortalstations.It seems extraordinary that leggere Dante con Dante (“reading Dante through thelens of Dante,” in a free translation), as Scartazzini is doing here, took solong to establish itself as a critical method. There is very little reference toother loci in the Commedia (and hardly any to Dante’s other works) in the firstfive hundred years of the poem’s life among its commentators. And, in a relatedphenomenon, there is hardly any citation of the poet’s “competitors” invernacular lyric; the major sources of literary reference are the Bible and theLatin classics. Today, readers take all of these as necessary and useful avenuesfor exploring the poem. See, for example, Pasquini, “Fra Dante e Guido: la nevee i suoi segreti” (in Pasq.2001.1, pp. 66–67), discussing the Cavalcantianelements of this simile.

[part0017.html#c27-s26-e] Beatrice, seeing that Dante can no longermake out the members of the Church Triumphant as they return home, invites him,once again, to look beneath his feet, down through the universe, toward theearth (see Par. XXII.127–129). [return to English [part0017.html#c27-s26-e] /Italian [part0029.html#c27-s26-i]]79–87. [part0017.html#c27-s27-e] The formally similar beginnings andconclusions of the two passages (this one and Par. XXII.133–153) devoted to theprotagonist’s earthward gazing back down through the heavens underline theformulaic aspect of both scenes. See Moore (Moor.1903.1), pp. 62–71, for a fulldiscussion.Dante’s reference points are noteworthy: He is over the trackless ocean to thewest of the two islands referred to as Gades (Insulae Gades [see the note toverse 82]) where Ulysses began his folle volo (Inf. XXVI.125) and can almost seethe shore of Asia Minor, where Europa was raped by Jupiter. Some suggest thatthese two myths reflect the two most insistent temptations of man, prideful ortransgressive intellectual behavior and lust. It may also be tempting to seethem in autobiographical terms for Dante, his besetting sins of waywardphilosophizing and sexual misconduct, these two sins finding an echo (and amodel?) in St. Augustine’s Confessions (see Hollander [Holl.1969.1], p. 165n.).As Jacoff points out (Jaco.1991.2), p. 237, Ovid tells the story of Europa inthree different places (Metamorphoses II and VI; Fasti II) with quite diversetreatments; she meditates upon the possibility that Dante has at once pairedEuropa with Ulysses in malo, as transgressive voyager (even if she is a victimof Jove’s lustful forcing), and also in bono, as a sort of classicalprefiguration of Dante, in that she was conjoined with the divine. On thispassage, see Moevs (Moev.2005.1), pp. 132–33, arguing that Ulysses and Europahave opposed valuations, he being identified with selfish seeking, while sherepresents “loving surrender to the divine.” For expression of the more usualview, see Scott (Scot.1977.1), p. 223, finding in Ulysses a man who fell victimto the temptations of the intellect and the will, while seeing in Europa avictim of her own sensual desires. However, it might be objected that Europa isnot the character who is paired with Ulysses, but that Jove is. That is, Ulyssesand Jupiter are both portrayed as embarking on voyages, spurred by curiosity inthe first case and by lust in the second, that are harmful to their “mates.”[return to English [part0017.html#c27-s27-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c27-s27-i]]79–81. [part0017.html#c27-s27-e] How long was Dante away from our terrestrialglobe? In Carroll’s words (comm. to Par. XXII. 151–154), this is “one of themost difficult problems in the poem.” But then Carroll himself neglects thequestion of how long Dante actually remained in the heavens. Most Dantists todayseem likely to agree that he was there some thirty hours.If we limit our inquiry to how long he was in this heaven, we can establish thatperiod from the celestial details we are given here (see, e.g., Moore[Moor.1903.1], p. 68): Six hours have passed since the protagonist last lookeddown (at the conclusion of Par. XXII). And see the note to ParadisoXXVI.139–142, pointing out that Dante spends six hours in the Starry Sphere, asdid Adam in Eden. (This is not to mention that [all but two] members of theChurch Triumphant were also present here for that amount of time [see the noteto vv. 67–72]).See Tozer’s clarifying paraphrase of this passage (comm. to this tercet): “HenceDante, in describing himself as passing, while he was in Gemini, from themeridian of Jerusalem to that of Gades, says that he moved along the arc formedby the primo clima. The interval between those two points is represented asreaching from the middle to the end of the first clima, because to Alfraganusthe climata were divisions not of the entire globe, but of the habitable globe(thus he says ‘Loca quadrantis habitabilis dividuntur in septem climata’), andhe regarded their extension from E. to W. as corresponding to twelve hours intime (‘longitudo omnium climatum ab oriente in occasum spatio 12 horarum arevolutione caelesti conficitur’), which represent 180° in space. Consequently,the half of this extension (dal mezzo al fine) would be six hours in time, or90° in space, thus corresponding to the difference between Jerusalem and Gades.Fine is appropriately used of the western extremity of the clima, because themovement of the sun, and that of Dante himself in the zodiac, which are hereregarded, are from E. to W. It is hardly necessary to add that, when it is saidthat Dante was on the meridian of Jerusalem or of Gades, it does not follow thathe was over those places, but only that he was in the same longitude with them.”[return to English [part0017.html#c27-s27-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c27-s27-i]]82.

Those who attemptto read the central character of Inferno XXVI as positive here must deal withDante’s firm rejection of the hero, which surely makes it even more difficult toheroicize him than did the ironic treatment offered in the earlier episode.

Boyle (Boyl.2000.1) is among the many who simply assume that it iswhat is meant by the word.For the twin problems, exactly how far Dante had moved with the heavens and,consequently, how much of our globe he was able to observe, see Carroll (comm.to Par. XXII.151–154). His hypothesis is that the reader is supposed to identifyeach of the three apostles with whom Dante has conversed as having beenparticularly identified with efforts located in specific parts of theMediterranean world, John with Asia Minor, Peter with Rome, and James withSpain. And thus, with regard to the second question, the protagonist’s vision ofearth coincides with those regions. [return to English [part0017.html#c27-s29-e]/ Italian [part0029.html#c27-s29-i]]85–87. [part0017.html#c27-s29-e] This tercet repeats two distinctive elementswe found at the arrival in the Starry Sphere: The poet again (see Par.

XXII.129) sees it beneath his feet(sotto li piedi)—see the appended note concerning the possibility that we aresupposed to conclude that those feet make the protagonist present in his body.When we read the phrase now, however, it is difficult to come to any otherconclusion, since Peter has already (see verse 64) referred to Dante’s “mortalburden”—with him now, his flesh.

Once again, Beatrice has become unspeakably more beautiful,outdoing either natural beauty or artistic rendering. With his eyes fixed onhers, Dante moves up to the next realm. The passage includes, perhapssurprisingly, a reference to Beatrice’s physical beauty (vv. 91–93). We areclose enough to the Empyrean for that to come as a surprise, even as a shock.However, when we examine the text, we find that the poet tells us that suchcarnally delightful images would be nothing compared to her beauty as areflection of God’s divinity.

It certainly seems plainthat Dante abandoned this schematic design of the earlier work in the Comedy,for whatever reason. But see Armour (Armo.1995.1), p. 410, claiming thatBeatrice’s turning to invective is indeed the sign of this heaven’s alignmentwith moral philosophy.

For instance, see Chiarenza(Chia.1988.1), pp. 232–34, reacting to Paradiso XXVIII.14–15 with the suggestionthat Dante’s “picture” derives from Bonaventure (Itinerarium mentis, V).For a quick introduction to the properties of the hypersphere, one may visit thefollowing site: http://www.hypersphere.com/hs/abouths.html[http://www.hypersphere.com/hs/abouths.html].

[part0017.html#c27-s39-e] The Crystalline Sphere rules the temporalrelationships among the parts of the rest of the universe. Dante employs theword testo (“flowerpot”; in modern Italian “baking dish”), a hapax when havingthis sense (but see Inf. XV.89 and Purg. VI.29 for its use with the meaning“text”) to portray the ninth (and invisible) sphere as the container of alltime, with its invisible roots here, displaying its leaves, pushed downward, inthe visible portions of the rest of the spheres (the stars and planets). (TheCrystalline Sphere’s “likeness” to a flowerpot would seem to be based on thefact that we cannot see the “roots of time,” just as we cannot see the rootsystem of a plant when it is in a pot.)The author of the Codice Cassinese was perhaps the first to point to Dante’ssource here, Aristotle’s Physics (IV.x–xiii); Francesco Torraca (comm. to vv.118–120) appears to have been the first commentator to cite Dante’s citation ofthat passage in Convivio (IV.ii.6).

[part0017.html#c27-s43-e] We follow Chimenz (comm. to vv. 127–129) andmost recent commentators in reading the word fede in the moral (rather than thetheological) sense, and thus “loyalty” or “honesty.” [return to English[part0017.html#c27-s43-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c27-s43-i]]130–135. [part0017.html#c27-s44-e] In these two examples of failing humanconduct, does Dante rehearse the first two sins of mankind, eating and killing?An air of puzzlement about the poet’s reasons for choosing these particularexamples pervades the early commentaries. John of Serravalle (comm. to vv.133–135) is among the few to offer a motive, in the second instance, for suchnasty thoughts on the part of the grown child, putting in his mouth thefollowing maledictive question: “When will she be dead, this damned widow?”Baldassare Lombardi (comm. to vv. 134–135) suggests two motives: to be done withher pious corrections and to dissipate her property. This two-part motive isrepeated by any number of later commentators; Luigi Pietrobono (comm. to verse135) is the first of them to think of Cecco Angiolieri’s sonnet “S’io fossifuoco” (If I were fire) in which he says, “S’i’ fosse morte, andarei a mi’padre;—s’i’ fosse vita, non starei con lui:—similemente faria da mi’ madre” (IfI were Death, I’d go to my father; if I were life, I would not abide with him:and [I’d have] the same dealings with my mother).

[part0017.html#c27-s44-e] The gerund balbuzïendo, used as participle(repeated in verse 133), picks up the adjective balba (stammering) fromPurgatorio XIX.7, the description of the foul seductress in Dante’s secondPurgatorial dream. There it contrasted with the false beauty and eloquence thatthe dreaming protagonist lent her; here it is the sign of innocence andimmaturity that is preferable to mature and calculated evildoing.

And yet, at least at first glance and if welisten only to its first interpreters, it seems easier to resolve than it has infact turned out to be. The Ottimo, Benvenuto, and Landino, obviously reflectingon the context of the preceding six verses, argue that the bella figlia is humannature itself, “created” by the Sun (the Ottimo refers us to Par. XXII.116 forDante’s presentation of the Sun as “father” of every mortal life). Starting withJohn of Serravalle (comm. to this tercet), who also believes that the referenceis to human nature, commentators refer to Aristotle’s tag, “Homo et sol generanthominem” (Man and the Sun generate men), found near the end of the secondsection of the Physics (and quoted by Dante [Mon. I.ix.1].) This is thenrepeated by numerous later glossators.What tends to be obscured in the conflicting studies of the tercet is thedifficulty in making out the literal sense of the phrase “nel primo aspetto.”This phrase may be understood in at least three mutually exclusive ways: theaspetto (1) belongs to the daughter (it is probably located in the skin of herface, her “aspect,” what she looks like) and is darkened by the Sun; (2) belongsto the daughter and is her gaze; (3) is what is seen by the Sun, that is, is inhis sight (whatever the Sun represents, whether itself or God). Since there isno sure way of determining which of these possibilities governs, one has toproceed “backward,” arguing from the context to the meaning of this phrase.(Indeed, that is how we arrived at the first option.)What may seem surprising today, in light of the wildly differing responses thatbegin with Carmine Galanti (as reported by Poletto [comm. to this tercet in1894], he introduced Circe into the list of “candidates”) and continue into ourown time, is the near unanimity of the ancients. Major exceptions are Jacopodella Lana (comm. to this tercet), who interprets her as representing theChurch; the Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to this tercet), who, in a variation,thinks that she represents the priesthood. (For passages in Bonaventure’sCollationes in Hexaemeron [XII and XXV] that portray the Church as filia solis,see Pierotti [Pier.1981.1].) On the other hand, and for something completelydifferent, see Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 121–138), who uniquely is of theopinion that, reflecting her presence in Aeneid VI.142 (the next two versesdetail the plucking of the golden bough), she is Proserpina, or the Moon. Themost complete summary of interpretations until 1921 is found in Casini/Barbi(comm. to verse 136) and is still useful, to a point, today.Strangely enough, it was only eighty years ago that what has come to beconsidered an essential reference in verse 136 was brought to light by H. D.Austin (Aust.1936.1): Song of Solomon (1:5), “I am black but comely.” OnceAuerbach (Auer.1946.1), pp. 485–88, also treated this as an evident borrowing,it began to be more widely noticed. (For discussion of this tercet [and thesetwo contributions], see Hollander [Holl.1969.1], pp. 174–80, and Pertile[Pert.1991.2], pp. 5–6.)Scartazzini (comm. to this tercet) resurrects Jacopo della Lana’s solution: theChurch. In the twentieth century Circe became the favored choice, supported bythe Virgilian (Aen. VII.11) and Ovidian (Metam. XIV.346) phrase, filia solis,describing her (see Barbi [Barb.1934.1], pp. 292–93; Scott [Scot.1977.1], p.229). More recently, Guthmüller (Guth. 1999.1), pp. 248–50, takes issue withPertile’s anti-Circean view. Pertile (Pert.1991.2), who mines commentary to theCanticle of Canticles by Guillaume de Saint-Thierry (pp. 7–18), had argued thatfor Dante, in this passage, at least, the sposa (bride) of the Canticlerepresents the human soul.The Third Vatican Mythographer (XI.6) offers the following list of those to whomthe name filia solis was given: Pasiphae, Medea, Circe, Phaedra, Dirce. For thefirst of these, Pasiphae, see Sarteschi (Sart.2000.2), referring to Servius assource; but see the previous article of Cassata (Cass.1971.3), who had arrivedat this interpretation before her. Lanza (Lanz.1996.1), ad loc., acceptsCassata’s argument.However, for still another candidate, see Hollander (Holl.1969.1), p. 191n.: IfDante knew either the Dittochaeon (Prudentius’s poeticized version of Scripturalnarrative) or some digest or listing in which at least its first line is found(cf. the online catalogue of the holdings of the monastery at Melk, where itdoes in fact appear), he would have seen some version of the following: “Evacolumba fuit tunc candida; nigra deinde / facta per anguinum malesuada fraudevenenum” (Eve was at first white as a dove; she then became black because of thevenomous serpent and its persuasive fraudulence). Hollander begins by citingOvid (Metam. V.568–571) for the facies (face, aspect) of Proserpina turning, inthe obverse of what is described here, from sadness to sunlit gladness; he thenpresses his case for Dante’s figural melding of Proserpina and Eve (a familiarenough equation, e.g., both women as sinful “eaters” [Hollander, p. 179]).There are problems with all the solutions heretofore proposed except, perhaps,for the most generic one: human nature, or human beings in general (or, inPertile’s formulation, the human soul). This last hypothesis is accompanied byonly one slight problem: Dante has, in the two preceding tercets, exemplifiedhuman conduct in a male child; why should he, if his subject remains the same,suddenly switch to a generic female child? This would make a reader believe thatthe reference changes to feminine for a reason, a hidden identity that we aremeant to puzzle out. And we have certainly puzzled. However, and to take onlythe two most popular modern readings, Circe and the Church, both of these seemflawed. Circe does not have the virginal aspect that these lines at least seemto confer upon the bella figlia. And she really doesn’t fit the context; shedoes not change from good to bad, from lovely to ugly, etc.; she changes othersinto something that they were not before. In order to support this reading, onemust interpret Circe as changing the complexion of her captives, hardly whatDante seems to be interested in here. And what about the Church? As a possibleinterpretation, it gains support from its longevity (it first was broached byJacopo della Lana), from a modern authority (Scartazzini), and from a skillfulargument (Chiavacci Leonardi’s [Chia.1997.1], p. 763). However, if one reads theentire context as political and civil, as it surely seems to be, one finds thatsolution awkward. Indeed, it could be argued that Dante’s thoughts about theChurch’s reform and revitalization outside a political context at the time hewas writing the last parts of Paradiso (with the Church, by electing John XXIIpope, having thereby confirmed its election of the Avignonian captivity) arenever anything but grim. All we hear about the Church in upper paradise is givenin thundering invectives against her failings. It does not appear that Dantespent much thought on ways in which it might be amended.As for the proposal of Eve, it faces (as do all the others but that puttingforward human nature) a formidable challenge: the present tense of the verb fa.If the verse read, in the original, fé, as Lanza suggests it might have(Lanz.1996.1, ad loc.), then the reference to Eve would be a lot more plausible.But such proposals must be advanced only with a sense of restraint.

[part0017.html#c27-s47-e] Perhaps because we are so near theEmpyrean, many Dantists do not observe the clearly political interests of thefollowing prophecy (vv. 142–148), which concludes the canto. Any sort ofopen-minded reading of this tercet makes it plain that the governance Dante hasin mind is not that of a pope, is not ecclesiastical in any way. It isinstructive to compare the similar moment in Purgatorio XVI.94–96 (and see theappended note). It is also instructive to study the lengthy and concerted glossto this passage of Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 139–148), which interpretsthe entire prophecy as having to do with the corruption and necessary reform ofthe Church. That so gifted a commentator can go astray is a warning to us lesserreaders. [return to English [part0017.html#c27-s47-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c27-s47-i]]142–148. [part0017.html#c27-s48-e] Tozer interprets: “The reckoning of theJulian calendar involved a yearly error in excess of somewhat less than ahundredth part of a day (la centesma), and this in Dante’s time amounted to anerror of about nine days, so that January was advanced by so much towards theend of winter and beginning of spring. It was this which was corrected by theGregorian calendar two centuries and a half later. The general meaning, then, ofprima che, &c., is ‘before a very long time has passed’; but it is intended tobe understood ironically as meaning ‘before long,’ ‘soon,’ somewhat in the sameway as when we say ‘not a hundred miles off’ for ‘near.’ ” Whatever the timeinvolved, it is clear that this is a major prophecy in the poem, in line withthose found in Inf. I (“veltro”) and Purg. XXXIII (“DXV”), as Hollander(Holl.1969.1), pp. 180–91, has argued. One of the medieval meanings of “fortuna”was “storm at sea”—cf. Purg. XXXII, 116—and that clearly seems to be the imageDante uses here. The word for “fleet” (classe) is here used for the first timein Italian (according to the Grande Dizionario [Batt.1961.1]); it comes fromLatin classis, the name for Ravenna as home of the Roman fleet and (for a time)capital of the empire. Within the context of the canto, Peter’s slam of thepapacy also ends with a Roman thought (Scipio defeating Hannibal); it is notreally surprising that Beatrice here should prophesy the coming of an emperorwho will set things right. (See, among others, Scott [Scot.1977.1], pp. 232–33;Hollander [Holl.2001.1], pp. 142–44.) Only then will the human race steer a goodcourse—and the papacy, too, get straightened out.

[part0017.html#c27-s48-e] See Moore (Moor.1903.1), pp. 95–101, for anextended presentation of what still coincides with the “standard” interpretationof this problematic expression. He shows that the Julian calendar, itselfdeveloped to adjust “seasonal slippage” of considerable extent, mismeasured thesolar year by the one-hundredth part of a day. Richard Kay (Kay.2003.2) arguesthat, on the contrary, Dante refers to the hundredth part of a degree ofsidereal movement.

[part0017.html#c27-s49-e] The word fortuna, as only several earliercommentators have pointed out (e.g., the Anonimo Fiorentino and Tommaseo, bothto vv. 145–148 [although both eventually hedge their bets]), here nearlycertainly has the meaning “storm at sea.” In the nineteenth century, beginningwith Andreoli (comm. to vv. 145–147), that became the dominant reading (and seeHollander [Holl.1969.1], pp. 181n., 190). Tommaseo (comm. to these verses) hadpreviously cited an analogous passage (Purg. XXXII.116), “come nave in fortuna”(like a ship tossed in a tempest), which might have offered a clue to others.Perhaps the vastly different context of that passage (the nascent Church isbeing attacked by Roman emperors) is responsible for the failure of attention.However, for a recent and differing opinion, see Prandi (Pran.1994.1), p. 120,who does not consider pertinent the meteorological meaning of fortuna in thisoccurrence of the word; the same may be said of Antonelli (Anto.2002.1), pp.422–23.For notice of a similar and entirely relevant passage, see Scott (Scot.1996.1),p. 100, in his discussion of Purgatorio VI.76–78, pointing to Epist. VI.3: “… When the throne of Augustus is vacant, the whole world goes out of course, thehelmsman and rowers slumber in the ship of Peter, and unhappy Italy, forsakenand abandoned to private control, and bereft of all public guidance, is tossedwith such buffeting of winds and waves as no words can describe, …” (tr. P.Toynbee). See Tommaseo (comm. to these verses [and see the note to verse 148]),citing an earlier form of the image in a discussion of empire in ConvivioIV.v.8. Kleinhenz (Klei.1986.2), pp. 229–30, thinks that the prophecy is of “apowerful temporal ruler.” Vazzana (Vazz.1989.1), p. 726, sees the storm at seaas representing the next and very angry emperor, “un nuovo Scipione, salvatorearmato” (a new Scipio, a savior in arms).

And here prora, of which this is the fifth and finalappearance (see Inf. VIII.29 and XXVI.141; Purg. XXX.58; Par. XXIV.68), joinsits naval counterpart for a shared final appearance. [return to English[part0017.html#c27-s49-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c27-s49-i]]148. [part0017.html#c27-s49-e] The canto ends with a corrective return to theimage of failed fruition (found in verse 126). We are promised that the eventualimperial reemergence, latent in history (one perhaps thinks of the modelrepresented by kairos, the “fullness of time” in the coming of Christ during thePax romana), will be, amazing even to Dante, fulfilled before our very eyes.This underlying reference had already been precisely expressed in ConvivioIV.v.8: “Nor was the world ever, nor will it be, so perfectly disposed as at thetime when it was guided by the voice of the one sole prince and commander of theRoman people [Augustus], as Luke the Evangelist testifies. Since universal peacereigned everywhere, which it never did before nor ever shall again, the ship ofhuman society was speeding on an even course directly toward its proper port”(tr. R. Lansing). This is, “reading Dante through the lens of Dante” (see thelast paragraph of the note to vv. 67–72), perhaps the single best gloss to thisdifficult passage, even if it appears to have been cited only by Tommaseo (seethe note to vv. 145–148). Much has recently been written about Dante’s rejectionof the values he espoused in his earlier works, particularly Convivio (see thenotes to Par. VIII.34–39 and XVIII.91–93). While it seems nothing less thanobvious, to any sort of objective examination that this is true, it surely needsalso to be observed that such retrospective change of heart is not total. Thesenotes refer to the minor works frequently, and to the Convivio most frequently(roughly one hundred times). In some respects it was the pre-study for Paradiso(see the note to Par. III.91–96), embodying several of its major themes andimages (centrally, the intellectual banquet [the “bread of angels”]). Thus,while some of its matter may have been “heretical” from the standpoint of theauthor of the later poem, many of its judgments, particularly in the fourthtreatise, in which the Convivio changed its course dramatically, now embracingRoman history as one of its new themes, are exactly as we find them in Paradiso(see Hollander [Holl.2001.1], pp. 86–90).

[part0018.html#c28-s01-e] This retrospective opening tercet reminds usthat, if humanity is in parlous condition (cf. Par. XXVII.127–141, Beatrice’slament for our lost innocence), the protagonist’s guide has prophesied bettertimes to come (Par. XXVII.142–148). Dante’s gaze, in this canto, will alsoreflect a double focus, first fixing on Beatrice’s mirroring eyes, and thenbehind him on what they reflect, God and the angels, themselves as seen, we areperhaps to understand, reflected on the convex outer surface of the CrystallineSphere (see the note to vv. 13–15).

[part0018.html#c28-s01-e] See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse), who claimthat we may read Beatrice here either allegorically (as “Theology”) or literally(as herself). They, doubtless wisely, prefer the second understanding;nonetheless, some readers may find it a bit disquieting to discover intelligentcritics even raising the possibility, so near the final vision, of “poets’allegory” being used as an interpretive tool for what the poet presents as beingboth actual and experienced.

[part0018.html#c28-s02-e] This return to the conditions of the experimentalluded to in the second canto (see the note to Par. II.94–105) shows howcaptious some readers are in their insistence that Dante deliberately presentsthat experiment as being literally impossible. Such a reader will once againobject that, if the flame is behind the subject’s back, it cannot be reflectedin a mirror set directly in front of him. And once again a less positivisticreader will realize that, if the flame is, for instance, only a few centimetersabove the observer’s head (as it is in the reproduction of a fifteenth-centuryillustration of the experiment [see Boyd.1995.1, p. 15)]), the result will be asDante says. In any case, this is a poem and not a physics lab. And yet we shouldrealize that Dante only says “behind” (dopo, retro) the observer, without in anyway suggesting that the flame might not be visible from a point directly infront of him.

Aside from Gabriele (comm. to verse 9), who shrugs the verse awaywith the description “a very ugly comparison,” most commentators struggle withthese lines, until Porena (comm. to these verses) sees that all previousattempts at suggesting resemblance (e.g., singing with its accompaniment, songwith its meter, words with their music, etc.) are not as precise as the image towhich this musical analogue is likened, the reflection of a thing in a mirror.[return to English [part0018.html#c28-s03-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c28-s03-i]]10–12. [part0018.html#c28-s04-e] Psaki (Psak.1995.1), p. 426, is eloquentdefending Dante’s right to present Beatrice’s sexual being as somehow stillbeing a part of her attraction for him. The problem with her argument is thatthis text is clearly past-oriented, the verb fece (past definite) in evidentcontrast with the present tense of Dante’s coinage imparadisa (imparadises). Thegirl toward whom he had been drawn sexually had turned out to be valuable forother and (in this poem) better reasons.

[part0018.html#c28-s04-e] For this use of the word corda (cord, heretranslated “snare”) as having only metaphorical valence as a “simbolo di virtù”(symbol of virtue), see Padoan (Pado.1974.1), p. 177n. He says that this usageis found also at Inferno XVI.106 (the famous, or infamous, “cord” that holdsDante’s garments together and is used by Virgil as an invitation and challengeto Geryon) and Purgatorio VII.114 (where Pedro III of Aragon is “girt with thecord of every virtue,” perhaps the only occurrence in which Padoan’s formulationreally works). However, it is not clear that the word in any of theseappearances has only a metaphorical sense.In the thirteen presences of the word corda in the poem, five times it refers toa bowstring; three times, to the strings of musical instruments; once, to thecords on a whip. That leaves one other form of corda that seems identical with(or at least highly similar to) Padoan’s three: Paradiso XXVI.49, the cords(corde) of love that draw us after it. And that seems to be the same (or aclosely related) meaning as is found here. [return to English[part0018.html#c28-s04-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c28-s04-i]]13–15. [part0018.html#c28-s05-e] Exactly what Dante sees reflected inBeatrice’s eyes is a matter of considerable dispute, although some commentatorshave possibly begun to sever the Gordian knot. Torraca (comm. to this tercet)was perhaps the first to realize that God and his angels have not descended tothis sphere from the Empyrean, if without specifying how it is exactly that theyare seen here. Sapegno (comm. to vv. 13–16) improves that formulation, insistingthat the protagonist sees God and the angels in the Empyrean through theperfectly transparent sphere of the Primum Mobile. This view has the benefit ofkeeping God and his angels where they belong (in the “tenth heaven”), but doesnot do very well by the poet’s insistence that he saw them “in quel volume” (in[or “on”] that revolving sphere). The fullest and best discussion of theproblem, one that is aware of the pitfalls into which all his precursors haveslipped, is that of Siro Chimenz (comm. to this tercet). He gets all the detailsright, but in the end confesses that he simply cannot come up with a solution.See the note to the opening tercet of this canto for an attempt at a resolution:Dante portrays the surface of the Primum Mobile as where the highest realitiesof all, God and His angelic partners in creation, are visible. In support ofthis hypothesis, we might consider the fact that the introductory simile itselfspeaks of a reflection (in Beatrice’s mirroring eyes). That, in turn, may beconsidered (if this hypothesis is correct) a reflection of a reflection.Possible confirmation is found in Paradiso XXX.106–108, where the Rose ispresented as a self-reflection off the convex surface of the Primum Mobile.Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet) point out that the commentators are confusedby this apparently simple utterance. How can God and the angels be present inthe Crystalline Sphere anytime one looks intently into it? It is not easy to seehow or why they, Bosco/Reggio continue, would now or ever descend to this sphere(despite, they might have added, the descent of the Church Triumphant in CantoXXIII), nor how any other hypothesis might account for the apparition (e.g., avision, an allegory, some sort of unusual perception). Our hypothesis is asfollows: Dante looks from a mirror (Beatrice’s eyes) into a second “mirror” (theconvex surface of the Crystalline Sphere) where first the Point and then theangelic circlings are what he sees, painted, as it were, upon the surface ofthis Primum Mobile, the circling of which moves all the universe by itsinfluence. Cf. Paradiso I.1–3: “La Gloria di colui che tutto move / perl’universo penetra, e risplende / in una parte più e meno altrove” (The glory ofHim who moves all things / pervades the universe and shines / in one part moreand in another less). God’s glory is to be considered as completely penetratingand at the same time visible here, in the first and purest sphere (and reflectedleast clearly of all by earth, spiritually even “denser” than the Moon, itself aless than perfect mirror, as we learned in Paradiso II). Seeing this highest andpurest “universe,” God and his angels, on the surface of the Crystalline Sphere,the protagonist experiences the “copy” as though it were actually present. Forpossible confirmation of this view, see the note to Paradiso XXX.103–108.Mellone (Mell.1989.1), pp. 733–34, demonstrates the congruence between thelanguage of Alfragano (whose view is accepted and cited by Giovanni diSacrobosco) and that of Dante here. Alfragano presents the earth as a tiny pointin relation to even the smallest star that can be seen from earth. In Mellone’sjudgment, Dante has deliberately misapplied the astronomer’s picture of ourphysical universe to God’s spiritual one.

[part0018.html#c28-s05-e] Mellone (Mell.1989.1), pp. 734–35, politely butfirmly (and correctly) dismisses those Dantists (most significantly Bruno Nardi)who believe that this giro is in fact found in (or simply is) the Empyrean,rather than referring to the Crystalline Sphere itself. In fact, we shouldprobably understand that it is the Crystalline Sphere. It is true that Danteonce refers to the Empyrean as a giro, but he probably should not have (see thenote to Par. IV.34).

[part0018.html#c28-s08-e] See the note to Paradiso III.51 for theapparent contradiction here, in that “the nine ranks of angels, each associatedwith one of the planetary spheres, rotat[e] around the point that represents theGodhead faster the nearer they are to that point,” while in the lower universethe spheres rotate more slowly the closer they are to their center.

[part0018.html#c28-s09-e] In earth-centered astronomy, we learn thatthe Primum Mobile, the outermost sphere, rotates the fastest (see Par.XXVII.99). Now we learn that the first ring of angels, the Seraphim, rotateseven more quickly. If we reflect only a moment, what seems an inverse relationbetween these two universes is in fact one of parallelism when considered fromthe perspective of the Empyrean’s God-centered astronomy. In such a view, thecloser a sphere is to God, the faster it rotates on its axis, no matter wherethat axis is.Between vv. 99 and 126 we shall hear the names of the angelic bands indescending order, exactly as they are presented anonymously here. Looking backfrom there, we can add to the highest rank, the Seraphim, the names of Cherubim,Thrones; Dominions, Virtues, Powers; Principalities, Archangels, and Angels.[return to English [part0018.html#c28-s09-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c28-s09-i]]27.

[part0018.html#c28-s10-e] Surely a highly competitive candidate in anyannual “Worst Tercet in the Divine Comedy” contest, this terzina does possessthe merit of a matter-of-fact tone that encourages the reader to take Dante’scelestial reportage at face value by suggesting that a certain value lies inprosaic verse.

[part0018.html#c28-s14-e] As was first pointed out by Daniello (comm.to vv. 40–45), this statement reflects a passage in Aristotle’s Metaphysics. Andsee Singleton (comm. to these verses): “This clearly reflects Aristotle’sstatement in the Metaphysics summarizing his speculations on the unmoved moveras final cause and supreme good. In the Latin translation of Aristotle known toThomas Aquinas this reads (Metaphys. XII, 7, 1072b): ‘Ex tali igitur principiodependet caelum et natura.’ (It is on such a principle, then, that the heavensand the natural world depend.) Aquinas, in his commentary on this point in theMetaphysics, states (Exp. Metaphys. XII, lect. 7, n. 2534): ‘Hence it is on thisprinciple, i.e., the first mover viewed as an end, that the heavens depend bothfor the eternality of their substance and the eternality of their motion.Consequently the whole of nature depends on such a principle, because allnatural things depend on the heavens and on such motion as they possess.’ ”See Vasoli (Vaso.1972.1), pp. 44–50, for a discussion of the neoplatonizingelements in Dante’s emanationist view of God’s stellar creations and theireffect on the lower world. This is, according to Vasoli, not really Aristotelianat all, but essentially and clearly neoplatonic, “closer to Avicenna’smetaphysical imagination than to the texts of [Aristotle’s] De caelo, …” (p.47).

[part0018.html#c28-s14-e] The point about this punto is that in theEmpyrean it is both a mathematically unlocatable and tiny point, a speck,containing everything, and/or an unimaginably large space in which everythingthat exists in the lower spheres—as a reflection of this point—truly exists. SeeParadiso XXXIII.85–87. [return to English [part0018.html#c28-s14-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c28-s14-i]]43–45. [part0018.html#c28-s15-e] Love may or may not “make the world goround,” but it certainly is the motive force of the universe.

[part0018.html#c28-s16-e] These four tercets are the protagonist’s onlywords in this sphere, and once again indicate that his intelligence is stillearthbound. See Tozer’s recapitulation (comm. to vv. 46–57): “Dante here statesthe difficulty which he feels, viz. that, whereas in the world of sense thespheres move more swiftly in proportion to their distance from the centre, i.e.,the earth, the celestial circles which he is now contemplating move more swiftlyin proportion to their nearness to the centre, i.e., God. As the latter of thesesystems is the pattern of the former, it would be natural that they shouldcorrespond.” That is to say, the physics of the highest heavens is counter toexpectation; the smallest circle runs fastest, the most distant, slowest, theexact opposite of what the protagonist experienced as he moved upward andoutward from the earth. As Beatrice will explain, that inverse ratio is puzzlingonly to an earthling; the spiritual physics that she explains is only(super)natural. See the note to vv. 25–27.

[part0018.html#c28-s18-e] The protagonist refers to the Primum Mobileas a “temple” and to its “boundary,” the Empyrean, in terms of love and light,its two most notable characteristics, as we shall see.

He wants to know the relationship between theactual universe and the spiritual one.Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 70–78) was the first among many to citeBoethius, Cons. Phil. (III.m9), already cited by Dante at Convivio III.ii. 17;the last lines of this poem, a favorite during the Middle Ages, contain thephrase te cernere finis cited in the Epistle to Cangrande (Epist.

[return to English [part0018.html#c28-s20-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c28-s20-i]]64–78. [part0018.html#c28-s22-e] See Tozer’s paraphrase (comm. to vv. 64–78):“The argument is as follows:—In the material universe the size of the spheres[i.e., their circumference] corresponds to the amount of divinely infused power(virtute) which they possess, and which is diffused by them throughout theirwhole range (per tutte lor parti), i.e., from sphere to sphere and to the earth(ll. 64–66). A larger amount of the benefits thus communicated and receivedbelow (maggior bontà) is the result of a larger amount of salutary influence(maggior salute), and the larger amount of salutary influence is contained in alarger body—supposing always that that body has complete receptive powerthroughout (ll. 67–69). Consequently, the ninth sphere, or Primum Mobile, whichis the largest, is also the highest in its nature of all the spheres; and thusit corresponds to the first and highest circle of the angels, that of theSeraphim (ll. 70–72). Hence, if you estimate the angelic circles, not by theirsize, as you see them, but by the rank and relative power of the spirits whichcompose them, you will perceive that each material Heaven corresponds exactly tothe Order of Intelligences that guides it, the wider sphere to the superior, thenarrower to the inferior power.” [return to English [part0018.html#c28-s22-e] /Italian [part0029.html#c28-s22-i]]72. [part0018.html#c28-s24-e] Those who believe that Dante is either“Franciscan,” privileging love over knowledge, or “Thomist,” placing knowledgehigher than love, find here only one of several clear indications that he wantsto combine intellect and will in a common activity, “loving-knowledge” or“knowing-love,” that bridges this divide. This has been apparent since weencountered a similar formulation lying behind the harmonious presentation ofthese two fraternal communities in the heaven of the Sun. And see the note tovv. 37–39.

Boreas, the north wind, blows straightahead or from his left (from the northeast) or from his right (from thenorthwest). This last was considered the mildest of these three winds, swellingup his right cheek and clearing out the night sky. However, there is somedisagreement on this point. Those who find Dante’s source in the Tresor ofBrunetto Latini (I.cvi.14) maintain that the passage refers to the northeastwind.Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 79–81) locates a source in Boethius (Cons. Phil.I.m3.1–10). [return to English [part0018.html#c28-s27-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c28-s27-i]]87. [part0018.html#c28-s29-e] Not so much a developed simile as a simplecomparison, this verse equates Beatrice’s fairly lengthy and complex explanation(vv. 61–78) and the clear light from a star (in a sky that has been rid of itsobscuring clouds by the wind, if we remember the first simile, vv. 79–84). Allthat complexity—two dozen verses of it—yields to the simplest illustration ofthe protagonist’s new comprehension.

[part0018.html#c28-s30-e] Pleased with Beatrice’s explanation, theangelic circles (in the Empyrean, we remember) throw out sparks (i.e., theangels themselves, each order keeping to its circle) like molten iron.For Dante’s previous use of this image, see Paradiso I.60. [return to English[part0018.html#c28-s30-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c28-s30-i]]91–93. [part0018.html#c28-s31-e] See Longfellow (comm. to verse 93) for thereference: “The inventor of the game of chess brought it to a Persian king, whowas so delighted with it, that he offered him in return whatever reward he mightask. The inventor said he wished only a grain of wheat, doubled as many times asthere were squares on the chess-board; that is, one grain for the first square,two for the second, four for the third, and so on to sixty-four. This the kingreadily granted; but when the amount was reckoned up, he had not wheat enough inhis whole kingdom to pay it.”One commentator (Oelsner [comm. to verse 93]) reports that this number isgreater than 18,000,000,000,000,000,000. The reader will want to remember thatsuch an astoundingly high figure is the result of simple doubling; the result ofsquaring (unless one begins with one [what the king should at least have offeredas his counterproposal]) would be beyond astronomical.This anecdote, deriving from the East, has several potential Europeanintermediaries, as has been duly noted (e.g., among others, Peire Vidal, asreported by Torraca [comm. to these verses]; but see Ledda [Ledd..2002.1], p.297n., for fuller documentation). The question of Dante’s direct knowledge ofArabic material has focused, in the last century, on the Libro della scala, theaccount of the Prophet’s night journey to another world. Theodore Silverstein(Silv.1952.1) for a while seemed to have silenced those who argued, encouragedby two books by Asín Palacios (Asin.1919.1 and Asin.1927.1), that there was adirect relationship between the Arabic Libro della scala and the Commedia. Hisbook is still most valuable, although it has often been forgotten in therekindled debate. Silverstein examined critically Asín’s evidentiary proceduresand found them deeply flawed, pointing out that more likely sources are to befound in familiar Jewish and Christian texts. However, a new stage in the debatewas initiated by Cerulli (Ceru.1949.1), who produced a palliative argument insupport of a basic relationship between Dante’s poem and Arabic sources (see thediscussion of his book by Nardi [Nard.1960.4].) More recently, as respected acritic as Maria Corti (Cort.1995.1) attempted to resuscitate Asín Palacios’sthesis; but see Chiamenti (Chia.1999.3) for an effective debunking of hereffort. For more recent support of at least the thrust of Asín Palacios’s views,see Schildgen (Schi.2002.1).

For the source of that celestial plan, see the note to vv.130–135 (and see the discussion in Pasquazi [Pasq.1972.1], pp. 375–78).While he substantially alters his ordering of the angelic hierarchy from hispresentation in Convivio, Dante remains firmly in disagreement with St. Thomasabout a crucial detail, as Scott (Scot.2004.2), p. 109, takes care to point out.In the Summa contra Gentiles (III.1xxx.11), Thomas said that the angelic orderof the Virtues was alone responsible for the movement of all the heavenlyspheres, while Dante, first in Convivio (II.v.6) and then here, carefullyassociates a particular order of angels with a particular sphere, and goes on tosay that the various angelic orders are the causes of the movements of thecorresponding heavenly spheres (Conv. II.v.13; vv. 127–129). [return to English[part0018.html#c28-s33-e] / Italian [part0029.html#c28-s33-i]]98–102.

But see Torraca’s solution (comm. to this tercet):The causal clause does not clarify the reason for the name “Thrones” (as mostassume), but relates to God’s having completed the first triad of angels when Hecreated the Thrones. Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 105) uneasily accept thissaving understanding of what they consider an “infelice terzina” (infelicitoustercet). [return to English [part0018.html#c28-s35-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c28-s35-i]]104. [part0018.html#c28-s35-e] The Thrones convey the judgments of God below,as Dante has explained in Paradiso IX.62. It seems possible that Dante thoughtof these first three orders as being particularly related to the Trinity, Love,Knowledge, and Divine Judgment, related to, in order, the Spirit, the Wisdom,and the Power of God. On the other hand, like the Trinity itself, each of thePersons (and each order of angels) has a triune identity along with itsindividual primary characteristic. There were in fact quite elaborate systemsavailable relating each of the three main groups of angels to each of the threePersons of the Trinity.Carroll (comm. to vv. 97–105) has a different understanding of the first threeorders: “The Thrones are, as they are called elsewhere, ‘mirrors’ (Par.IX.61–63) by which the Divine judgments are flashed throughout the universe.These judgments, however, descend to the Thrones through the Seraphim andCherubim, that is, through love and knowledge. The Thrones, therefore, are theterminus, so to speak, of the love and knowledge of God issuing in judgment.‘The Seraphim,’ says Bonaventure, ‘contemplate the goodness of God, the Cherubimthe truth, the Thrones the equity’ (Compend. Theol. Veritatis, II.12; St.Bernard, De Consideratione, V.4–5); and this equity contains the goodness andtruth, the love and light, which flow down through the two higher Orders.”[return to English [part0018.html#c28-s35-e] / Italian[part0029.html#c28-s35-i]]105. [part0018.html#c28-s35-e] The past definite tense of the verb terminarehere is used in a dialectal form (as is vonno, with which it rhymes, in verse103). In De vulgari eloquentia (I.xiii.2), Dante had disparaged this (Pisan)dialectal form of the past definite ending (-onno), as commentators (beginningwith Andreoli [comm. to vv. 104–105]) have taken pleasure in pointing out. Whileboth these words are forced by rhyme with (the apocopated form of possono)ponno, it seems evident that Dante enjoyed being forced into this“ungrammatical” posture (i.e., presenting himself as employing a surprisinglylow vernacular).

[part0018.html#c28-s37-e] This tercet offers apparent aid and comfortto those who propose a “Dominican” Dante, one who values knowledge over love.However, here the poet is saying that knowledge precedes love temporally, notthat it is better than it. Clearly, we are meant to understand that, in aChristian soul, they work together. If not, the poet would have found a way topresent the Cherubim as the highest order of angels.

[part0018.html#c28-s44-e] Dante had perhaps followed Gregory (MoraliaXXXII.48) indirectly by following the version (Seraphim, Cherubim, Powers,Principalities, Virtues, Dominions, Thrones, Archangels, Angels) found inBrunetto Latini, Tresor (I.xii.5). (Oelsner [comm. to verse 133] was apparentlythe first commentator to discuss Dante’s reliance here on Brunetto.) Gregory, inthe Homiliae (XXXIV), had only two orders at variance from Dionysius’s, theorder Dante employs here. See Tozer (comm. to verse 130): “Dionysius theAreopagite, the convert of St. Paul at Athens (Acts 17:34), was the reputedauthor of the De Caelesti Hierarchia, … In reality that work seems to have beenwritten in the fifth or sixth century. It was translated from the original Greekinto Latin by John Scotus Eriugena (Cent. IX), and became the textbook ofangelic lore in the middle ages. The names of the Orders were derived fromScripture, for five of them, viz. Thrones, Dominions, Virtues, Powers, andPrincipalities, occur in St. Paul’s Epistles (cp. Romans 8:38 [Vulg.]; Ephesians1:21; Colossians 1:16), and the remaining four, viz. Seraphim, Cherubim,Archangels, and Angels, in other parts of the Bible; but the system which Dantehere gives was due to the work just mentioned.” For Dante’s own earlier version,which is probably much more on the poet’s mind than Gregory’s, see ConvivioII.v.7–11. This is a large “oops!” that has Dante laughing at himself even morethan Gregory might be imagined as doing.For an essay in English on the importance of Dionysius for Dante, see Gardner(Gard.1913.1), pp. 77–110.

Porena (comm. to vv. 130–135) thinks Dante has noddedhere. Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 134–135) deal with the problem by claiming,less than convincingly, that the poet really meant Heaven in general, and notthe Primum Mobile. The only way around the obstacle is to insist that Gregory,passing through this heaven on his way to his seat in the Rose, saw the image ofthe nine angelic orders present on this sphere as Dante did (see the note to vv.13–15); however, this seems a forced argument.

[part0018.html#c29-s01-e] Alison Cornish (Corn.1990.1 [repr. Corn.2000.2,pp. 119–41]) has furnished a bravura performance on this opening simile,connecting its consideration of a single moment separating two very differentstates (balance/imbalance) to the moment separating God’s creation of the angelsfrom that of their first choices. See also Moevs (Moev.2005.1), pp. 151–60.[return to English [part0018.html#c29-s01-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c29-s01-i]]1–3. [part0018.html#c29-s01-e] Cornish begins her treatment of this momentwith the following observation: “We have no way of knowing whether the planetaryconfiguration that opens [this canto] describes dawn or dusk” (Corn.1990.1), p.1. In the first three centuries it was a rare commentator (but, for exceptions,see Francesco da Buti [comm. to vv. 1–12] and Vellutello [comm. to vv. 1–9]) whodid not assume that Dante presented the Sun as being in Aries, the Moon inLibra. After Vellutello there is a period in which everyone gets this “right”;in fact, among the Italians it is only in the twentieth century with Steiner(comm. to verse 2) that the old error returns (until Bosco/Reggio [comm. to vv.1–9] restore the better reading; but see Chiavacci Leonardi [Chia.1997.1], p.797, who reverts to the discredited interpretation). Among Dante’sEnglish-writing commentators, however, only Oelsner (comm. to these verses)understood that Dante leaves it absolutely opaque as to whether it is the Sun orMoon that is in Aries (the Ram) or in Libra (the Scales). The reference to theSun’s being in Aries at the Creation in the first canto of the poem (Inf.I.39–40) has, understandably perhaps, been the controlling factor for suchreaders. [return to English [part0018.html#c29-s01-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c29-s01-i]]1. [part0018.html#c29-s01-e] For discussion of Latona’s role in the poem (sheis also named at Purg. XX.131, Par. X.67, and XXII.139), see Aversano(Aver.2000.2), pp. 141–42, suggesting that her maternal role may have seemed toDante reminiscent of Mary (in particular in her having given birth to Apollo,treated several times as Christ [see the notes to Par. I.13–15, 13, 19, 25–27]).He continues by suggesting that Dante also was drawn to the figure of Latona byher exilic condition, particularly as this was presented by Ovid (Metam.VI.186–191), and by her eventual stability, shared by the former wandering isle,Delos, in a sort of pagan version of eternal peace and light. [return to English[part0018.html#c29-s01-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c29-s01-i]]4–6. [part0018.html#c29-s02-e] The Sun and the Moon are described as beingmomentarily balanced (an instant immeasurably brief because both are always intheir orbital motion); their being “out of balance” is recognized after acertain duration, when both are perceived as having changed position, movingaway from (the one above, the other below) the horizon. Strangely, Cornish(Corn.1990.1), p. 7, believes that Porena was of the opinion that this instantalso corresponds to that of a total lunar eclipse. Porena, in fact, first in hisearlier article (Pore.1930.1) and then in his commentary (to vv. 4–6),“dismisses the eclipse as an accident” (the words are Kleiner’s [Klei.1994.1],p. 166, n. 14). Porena is in polemic against those of Dante’s commentators whotake his scientific lore too seriously. [return to English[part0018.html#c29-s02-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c29-s02-i]]7–8. [part0018.html#c29-s03-e] Some (incorrectly) believe that what isdescribed as being of immeasurably short duration is Beatrice’s smile (seePayton [Payt.1995.1], p. 439): “The longer it is thought about, the smaller theexact instant is.… How long did Beatrice smile? How brief a moment can youconceive?” Payton has not digested Cornish’s explanation (Corn.1990.1, pp. 6–7),not of Beatrice’s smile, but of her silence, which is the issue here: “ForAristotle an instant (or the ‘now,’ as he called it) is the temporal equivalentof a point on a line; yet time is no more made up of these ‘nows’ than a line iscomposed of geometrical points” (p. 7). She points out that Porena before herhad correctly characterized the temporal nature of Beatrice’s silence (see hiscomm. to vv. 4–6) as indeed having measurable duration. Porena suggests that theamount of time for half the rising or setting Sun or Moon to rise completelyabove or to sink completely below the horizon is a little more than a minute,certainly a measurable time. Cornish might have observed that Bosco/Reggio(comm. to vv. 1–9) had supported Porena’s thesis. [return to English[part0018.html#c29-s03-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c29-s03-i]]9. [part0018.html#c29-s03-e] For the poet’s contrastive inner reference toFrancesca’s words (Inf. V.132, “ma solo un punto fu quel che ci vinse” [still,it was a single instant overcame us]), here and in Paradiso XXX.11, seeHollander (Holl.1993.5), pp. 7–8, nn. 18–19, citing Contini (Cont.1976.1), p.206, as having preceded him in pointing out this parallel. But see also Chiampi(Chia.1981.1), p. 66. And now see Moevs (Moev.2005.1), p. 157. [return toEnglish [part0018.html#c29-s03-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c29-s03-i]]10–12. [part0018.html#c29-s04-e] By now a most familiar claim of Beatrice’s:She reads Dante’s thoughts in the point (God) where all space (Latin for“where”: ubi) and time (Latin for “when”: quando) most purely and truly exist.[return to English [part0018.html#c29-s04-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c29-s04-i]]13–18. [part0018.html#c29-s05-e] We are in the highest part of God’s creationin time, a mixture of form and matter, the heavens. This sphere, we remember, isgoverned by the Seraphim, the highest order of angels, dedicated to loving God.Dante has asked a most difficult theological question: If God isself-sufficient, if He has no “needs,” why did He bother to create anything atall? The answer that Beatrice offers is simplicity itself: He created because Heloves and wanted the angels to enjoy His love in their being, loving Him inreturn.For consideration of Dante’s reflections on the Creation, see Boyde(Boyd.1981.1), pp. 235–47. On the canto as a whole, see Nardi’s lectura(Nard.1956.1). For Dante’s recasting in it of the relatively anthropomorphicview of creation found in Genesis for a more abstract and philosophical one, seeBoitani (Boit.2002.1). Boitani further maintains (p. 95) that Dante’srescripting of Genesis goes far beyond what is authorized by the Bible inportraying the creation of the angels, a subject about which Scripture issilent.

[part0018.html#c29-s05-e] The Latin verb form subsistere is used here, asBosco/Reggio point out, voluntarily (Dante had used the Italian form of the nounsubstantia [sussistenza] at Paradiso XIII.59 and easily could have used sussistohere, which rhymes perfectly with visto and acquisto). And so we may concludethat he wanted the Scholastic flavor that the Latin term affords. See verse 12,where the parallelism with the Latin word ubi causes the reader to realize thata perfectly usual Italian word quando is there a Latin word.

[part0018.html#c29-s06-e] The Italian dative pronoun “i” (gli in modernItalian) is used some eight times in the poem, but this is the only time itrefers to God after Adam informs us that “I” was the first name that humanspeakers used to address Him, and that Adam was the first to use it. See thenote to Paradiso XXVI.134. [return to English [part0018.html#c29-s06-e] /Italian [part0030.html#c29-s06-i]]19–21. [part0018.html#c29-s07-e] Two major issues are touched on here. If oursense of the history of the world begins with Creation (i.e., Genesis 1:1), whatwas God doing before then? (Attributed to St. Augustine is the retort,“preparing a Hell for the inquisitive” [see Carroll, comm. to vv. 19–30].)Dante’s point is that whatever He was doing, He was not lazing about, even ifthere was, strictly speaking, no time before the Creation.The second problem is of a different order. What exactly does “God moved uponthese waters” mean? Precisely what “waters” are referred to? The obviousreference is to Genesis 1:2. The first commentator (but hardly the last) topoint to the work of Bruno Nardi was Porena (comm. to this tercet). Nardi hadshown (see Nard.1944.1), pp. 307–13, that one traditional medievalinterpretation of this biblical text was that these waters are above the rest ofthe heavens (the Primum Mobile was also referred to as the “acqueous sphere”).As Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this tercet) point out, Dante’s use of thedemonstrative adjective “queste” (these) makes that solution even moreattractive, since Dante and Beatrice are currently in the Primum Mobile.

[part0018.html#c29-s08-e] From the fourteenth century onward,commentators (e.g., the author of the notes to the Commedia found in the CodiceCassinese [comm. to verse 22]) have entered into the question of what exactlyDante envisioned when he thought of “pure matter.” The author of that earlycommentary resorts to Plato’s term ylem [“hyle”], for primordial matter withoutform, the “stuff” of the four elements to which God would give shape in creatingthe physical world. See O’Keeffe (Okee.1924.1), pp. 56–57, for why this is notthe same as the “prime matter” of Averroës. And, for a recent discussion inEnglish, taking issue with Nardi’s various pronouncements that would make Danteless orthodox than even he probably wanted to be perceived, see Moevs(Moev.2005.1), pp. 40–45. For instance, Moevs believes that Dante’s ideas aboutmateria puretta accord with Thomas’s views.For the three entities “shot” by this “three-stringed bow,” see the note to vv.31–36.

[part0018.html#c29-s11-e] The standard gloss is found in Bosco/Reggio(comm. to these verses), who say that the angels, “pure act” (i.e., pure form orsubstance, unmodified by accidents), were created in the Empyrean; that “purematter” (unformed matter before God created the universe) was the condition ofthe earth before the event recorded in Genesis 1:1–2; that the nine heavens,between the Empyrean and earth, were created out of a mixture of form and matter(“act” [atto] and “potential” [potenza]). However, for a nuanced and morecomplex discussion of Dante’s unique integration of elements from many sourcesin this passage, orthodox (e.g., Thomas Aquinas) and unorthodox (e.g.,Averroës), see Mellone (Mell.1974.1), pp. 198–200.There is a persistent counterview, one that understands the second aspect of theCreation differently, as humankind.

Summa theol. I of ThomasAquinas as it passes from question 43 to question 44), beginning with thehighest creatures, which are the angels.” [return to English[part0018.html#c29-s11-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c29-s11-i]]37–45.

Dante’s disagreement with Jerome is confrontationaland dismissive, all the more so since it issues from the mouth of Beatrice, andwe cannot lay the blame on a somewhat intemperate protagonist. (For the text ofThomas’s far more conciliatory packaging of his own dissent [ST I, q. 61, a. 3],see Singleton [comm. to vv. 37–39]).

[part0018.html#c29-s17-e] No one seems to have found a reason or asource for this segment of time that Dante decides it took the angels to fallfrom the Empyrean into Hell. In fact, normal gravitational force, applied tonormal objects, would have left them falling a far longer time. Their sin,self-loving rebellion against God, occurred the moment of/after their creation,for all intents and purposes instantaneously. Their fall, traversing the entireuniverse to its core, took less than half a minute. [return to English[part0018.html#c29-s17-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c29-s17-i]]50. [part0018.html#c29-s17-e] See Convivio II.v.12 for Dante’s previoushandling of the question of the fallen angels: It was about one-tenth of thewhole group who sinned and fell; God was moved to create humankind as a kind ofreplacement for these (“alla quale restaurare fue l’umana natura poi creata”).For Augustine’s absolute unwillingness to consider that God created theeventually fallen angels anything less than completely good, see Cornish(Corn.1990.1), pp. 10–14. On the other hand, he clearly thought that angelicnature would have come into being making choices. And so Augustine, caughtbetween two very strong theological imperatives (God never created evil; Satannever enjoyed the bliss of loving God), invented an amorphous mora (delay)between his creation and his fall. According to Cornish, for Augustine “thedevil was not created sinful, yet his sin was not deferred even for asplit-second. He makes the distinction that by nature the devil was good, bychoice he became evil, so that the beginning of Lucifer’s being and thebeginning of his sin occurred at two separate moments. Whether these are logicalor chronological moments is not clear” (p. 11). Dante’s view, while neverclearly stated, is probably not very different.

[part0018.html#c29-s17-e] For suggetto, see Bemrose (Bemr.1983.1), pp.197–201, siding with the majority; the word refers to “terra” (earth). See, forinstance, Lombardi’s gloss (comm. to vv. 49–51), saying that earth is subject to(i.e., lies beneath) the other three elements, water, air, and fire. But seeMazzoni (Mazz.1979.2 [Intro. to Questio], pp. 712–32) and Baranski(Bara.1984.1), p. 300, both of whom suggest that we are meant to realize thatwhat is under discussion is “prime matter” (la materia prima). And see Cestaro(Cest.2003.1), p. 248, n. 87: “Dante alludes here to the common Scholasticnotion of a subiectum elementorum, the primal elemental material prior to thedefinition of four distinct elements, akin to Plato’s silva [‘hyle’] ….” Ahedged bet is found in Oelsner’s notes (comm. to vv. 49–51): “Il suggetto deivostri elementi is usually (and perhaps rightly) taken to mean ‘that one of yourelements that underlies the rest,’ i.e., earth. Compare Inf. XXXIV.121–126. Butif we take this passage on its own merits, it seems better to understand thesubstrate of the elements to mean the prima materia (compare [Par.] II.106–108;VII.133–136, and lines 22–24 of this canto); the elaboration of the elementsbeing the subsequent work of the Angels and the heavens.” The strongest caseagainst this second interpretation was made by Porena (comm. to vv. 49–51),pointing out that Inferno XXXIV.122–126 reveals that Dante thought that, by thetime Satan had penetrated our globe, water and earth had already been separated.However, Chimenz (comm. to vv. 49–51) countered that argument as follows: Thewords inscribed over the gate of Hell (Inf. III.7–8) would seem to suggest thatbefore the creation of Hell (and, Chimenz insists, the contemporary creation ofthe angels), nothing existed except eternal things, and thus Satan fell intounformed matter. Nonetheless, it is certainly possible that we are meant tounderstand that earth was formed while Satan was falling and (at least in part)in order to receive him and his partners in rebellion.

Their merit (merto) wasprecisely that humility and their waiting upon the Lord to bestow that higherlight. With that bestowal they were forever confirmed in this highest grace, andaccordingly they are now bound thereby to the good and to do the good. They havefullness of vision and of will, and they cannot sin. See Thomas Aquinas, Summatheol. I, q. 62, a. 8, resp.: ‘The beatified angels cannot sin. The reason forthis is, because their beatitude consists in seeing God through His essence.Now, God’s essence is the very essence of goodness. Consequently the angelbeholding God is disposed towards God in the same way as anyone else not seeingGod is to the common form of goodness. Now it is impossible for any man eitherto will or to do anything except aiming at what is good; or for him to wish toturn away from good precisely as such.

[part0018.html#c29-s24-e] Dante’s corrosive attack on bad preachingreveals heartfelt annoyance, probably reflecting extensive personal experience.Tasked with the representation of the Word, preachers should control theirdesires for recognition of their powers of speaking.

[part0018.html#c29-s24-e] Discussing the questions pertaining to thenatures of angelic language (see De vulgari eloquentia I.ii.3) and memory, seeBarbara Faes de Mottoni (Faes.2001.1). Her discussion of this passage, found onpp. 243–53, concludes (p. 253) with the assertion, difficult to fault, that theangels, knowing everything in God, have, at least in Dante’s possibly heterodoxopinions (potentially opposed to those of Peter Lombard, Bonaventure, Albert theGreat, and Thomas Aquinas), need of neither language nor memory. However, seethe further distinction offered by Attilio Mellone (Mell.1974.1), pp. 205–8, whosuggests that, while a passage in Monarchia (I.iii.7) clearly seems to requirethat we conceive that Dante there denies that the angels have memories, here thepoet only seems to assert that they do not need to make use of them.

[part0018.html#c29-s25-e] Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse) allow thatpossibly Dante believes that, projecting human experience onto the terms“intellect,” “will,” and “memory” (see verse 72), some earthly judges distortthe nature of the angelic versions of these capacities. That would “save” Dantefrom opposing some pretty potent authorities (see the note to vv. 70–81).[return to English [part0018.html#c29-s25-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c29-s25-i]]79–80.

For discussion, see Curti (Curt.2002.1),pp. 161–62. It seems likely that Dante wants, as is often the case, to formulatehis own position on an issue, one that accords with elements found in severalother authorities. [return to English [part0018.html#c29-s27-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c29-s27-i]]82–84. [part0018.html#c29-s28-e] The explanation seems clear enough (and isfound in many early commentaries): There are those on earth who are totallyconfused (i.e., they “dream” even while they are not sleeping) in believing thatthe angels have need of memory, while others, those who maintain such a viewwhile knowing it to be false, are guilty not of ignorance but of fraud. TheseChristian sophists care more about making a splash than seeking the truth.Boitani (Boit.2002.2), p. 451, is effective in joining two responses that arerarely seen together in the commentary tradition when he understands (1) thatthe focus of Beatrice’s anger is completely on the question of angelic memory(and does not spill over into the sins of bad preachers, which dominate thefollowing verses [91–126], as so many allow their discussion to do) and (2) thatthe zeal behind her (Dante’s) insistence is passionate and fully conscious ofthe famous feathers that will be ruffled thereby, those of Saints Jerome,Augustine, and Thomas, for starters. However, he perhaps goes too far inasserting that Dante denies that angels have memory; the text only asserts (vv.80–81) that they have no need of memory, which may imply either that they haveor do not have this capacity. Dante is obviously outraged at the notion ofangels requiring (and actually using) memory, since they live in the eternalpresent. However, whether he goes as far as Averroës (and Siger) in denying thatthey have this capacity, that question he leaves us to wonder about. He couldnot have left the issue more ambiguous, as he obviously desired to—which mayimply that he did in fact buy into Siger’s argument.

[part0018.html#c29-s29-e] These two tercets form the pivot on whichBeatrice’s argument turns from heavenly theology (involving the nature ofangelic mind) to religious concerns of a lower intellectual order, from thedisputes of theologians to the fables told by preachers—and Dante almostcertainly has in mind itinerant friars.

[part0018.html#c29-s31-e] The “cost” of the benefits of Scripture inblood (of Jesus, the martyred apostles, and the other martyrs [seePasquini/Quaglio, comm. to this tercet, for these three references]) is nottaken into account.Poletto (comm. to this tercet) at least reacts to the curious present tense ofthe verb costa (costs), and “translates” it as costò (cost). Grabher (comm. tothis tercet) does take the present tense as meaningful, believing that Dante isnot speaking literally of the blood of martyrs, but metaphorically—of the innersacrifice made by all Christians. This does not seem a convincing gloss. Andthus, while the constraints of rhyme may be all the explanation one requires forthe presence of the form, the reader is forced to wonder. Did Dante think of thepast sacrifices of the heroes of the Church as occurring in the vivid presenttense, or is his point that such sacrifices are being made even now, in his day?His opinions on the current condition of the City of Man, expressed volublythroughout the poem (most recently at Par. XXVII.121–141), would seem to gainsaythis second possible explanation. [return to English [part0018.html#c29-s31-e] /Italian [part0030.html#c29-s31-i]]94–126. [part0018.html#c29-s32-e] Pasquazi (Pasq.1968.1), p. 1031, begins hislectura with this invective against preachers, which is a frequent cause ofcomplaint among less stern readers of the last canticle. His view is that itshould be dealt with not as aberrant, but as of a piece with the texture andpurpose of the canto. Mellone (Mell.1974.1), p. 209, is of a similar opinion.For discussion of a similar discomfort among the commentators with Beatrice’slast words in the poem in the following canto, see Hollander (Holl.1993.5), pp.31–33.

Her insistence on the fictitious nature of this sort of publicutterance is underlined by the word invenzioni (inventing new ideas) here andfavole (tales) at verse 104, ciance (idle nonsense) at verse 110, motti andiscede (buffoonery and jokes) at verse 115. Cf. Giovanni Boccaccio’s portrait ofa fiction-dealing friar, Fra Cipolla (Decameron VI.x), which probably owes morethan a certain debt to this passage. (See Longfellow [comm. to verse 115] andHollander [Holl.1997.2], pp. 41–45). [return to English[part0018.html#c29-s32-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c29-s32-i]]97–102. [part0018.html#c29-s33-e] For the “darkness at noon” that overspreadthe world during the Crucifixion of Jesus, see Luke 23:44: “It was now about thesixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.”(See also Matthew 27:45 and Mark 15:33.) And see Grandgent (comm. to theseverses): “To explain this darkness at the Crucifixion, some said that the moonleft its course to make an eclipse, others that the sun hid its own rays.Dionysius (Par. XXVIII.130) favored the first explanation, St. Jerome thesecond. Both are recorded by St. Thomas in Summa Theologiae III, q. 44, a. 2.The second theory has the advantage of accounting for an obscuration ‘over allthe land,’ whereas an ordinary eclipse would darken only a part of it.” [returnto English [part0018.html#c29-s33-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c29-s33-i]]100. [part0018.html#c29-s34-e] This line has caused scandal. Does Dante reallywant to say that those who say that the Moon retroceded six constellations inthe Zodiac in order to blot out the Sun (and, according to Scartazzini [comm. tothis verse] and Bosco/Reggio [comm. to vv. 97–102], some fairly illustriousauthorities, including Dionysius the Areopagite, Albert the Great, and ThomasAquinas, took this explanation seriously) are liars? Those are strong words.Scartazzini was the first to point out that Dante had a precursor in such aharsh view, Petrus Comestor (PL CXCVIII.1631), who says that those who upholdsuch tales “have lied” (mentiti sunt). Eventually Nardi (Nard.1944.1), pp.375–76, would also turn to this source and argue that, despite the commentators’discomfort, both the manuscript tradition and Petrus’s harsh words underline thefact that Dante meant exactly what he said. We should remember the poet’s harshtreatment of Jerome, specifically mentioned as totally incorrect (Dante couldhave been less direct!) in this very canto (verses 37–45); on that occasion,concerning the dating of the creation of the angels, St. Thomas was right (ifDante doesn’t say so specifically). And now it is his turn to be told off, ifindirectly. Bosco/Reggio try to diminish the force of the verb mentire inDante’s day (i.e., rather than lying, it meant something more like “does nottell the truth”). Nonetheless, it is plain enough that Dante is belittling anopinion that is to be thought of as having the same merit as the idle tales toldby not-very-well-educated friars. And if Dionysius, Albert, or Thomas chooses toalign himself with such drivel, he gets only what he deserves—that seems to bethe poet’s attitude.Dante disposes of this “scientific” account of the miracle recorded in threeGospels on truly experimental grounds. If it were true, then the resultingeclipse would have been only partial. And so we are forced to follow Jerome,whose miraculous “self-eclipse” of the Sun indeed was visible in all the world,and not merely in the area around Jerusalem.

All over thecity, in parish after parish, all through the year, the leaders of the flocktrade in “wind,” notions that are clearly estranged from truth. Suchintellectual vagrancy, however, does not excuse the individual sheep, who shouldrealize that what they listen to so avidly has nothing to do with the Bible orwith the fundamental truths of their religion.

In the middle ages the swine of themonks of St. Antony were allowed to feed in the streets of cities, and were fedby devout persons (Jameson, Sacred and Legendary Art, pp. 750, 751); this iswhat Dante refers to.” The obvious reversal in the values of the Antonines, whobecame the representatives of the vice that their founder had conquered, isapparent.

Dante’s coinage, the verb ingradarsi, is found inslightly altered form (digradarsi) in Paradiso XXX.125. In both cases it seemsto have the meaning “to increase step-by-step.” Thus, the higher the eyes of anobserver mount, the more angels they are able to take in. And that number isbeyond both human vocabulary and mortal conception. [return to English[part0018.html#c29-s44-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c29-s44-i]]133–135. [part0018.html#c29-s45-e] Discussing this passage, Ledda(Ledd.2002.1), pp. 297–98, points out that Daniel’s numeration of the angels(Daniel 7:10, “a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times onehundred thousand stood before him” [according to the Vulgate]), whileincalculable for most human beings, was probably a finite number in Dante’sopinion. Similarly, the wording of verse 135, “a particular number liesconcealed” (determinato numero si cela), would clearly seem to indicate a verylarge but determinable number. Most commentators think the poet is sayingsomething quite different, namely that the number of angels cannot berepresented by any finite number. However, Dante’s sense for mathematics may bemore sophisticated than that of his commentators; apparently he knows thedistinction between “numberless” (i.e., beyond counting because of limited humancapacity) and “infinite,” a concept of which he knew at least from the extendeddiscussion in Aristotle’s Physics (III.iv–viii).Behind this passage, according to Mellone (Mell.1974.1), pp. 210–11, there liesa dispute between “Aristotelians” (who propose a limited number of angels) andthe Bible (e.g., Daniel 7:10, Apocalypse 5:11). However, see Thomas Aquinas (STI, q. 112, a. 4), as cited by Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 135): “The multitudeof the angels transcends any material multitude.” It is clear what positionDante does not share, that of the “Aristotelians,” who argue for a strictlylimited number (as few as sixty). However, whether he believes that the angelsare infinite or numbered is not entirely clear, although verse 135 may be morespecific than it is generally understood as being. Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p.148, supports the second opinion, citing Gregory’s gloss on Job 25:3 from theMoralia: “And if the number of angels is finite to the eye of God [Dante’s‘particular number’?], in the human view it is infinite [Dante’s ‘liesconcealed’?]” (PL LXXV.542).

[part0018.html#c30-s01-e] Tozer’s paraphrase (comm. to verse 1) of thiscomplex tercet runs as follows: “The dawn, instead of being mentioned by name,is here described, by an elaborate periphrasis, as the time when it is aboutmidday 6,000 miles off from us on the earth’s surface. This calculation isarrived at in the following manner. Seven hours are approximately the period oftime which the sun takes to pass over 6,000 miles of the earth’s surface; for,according to the computation of Alfraganus (cap. VIII), which Dante accepted(Conv. III.v.11—see Toynbee, Dict., p. 522, s.v. “Terra”), the entirecircumference of the earth was 20,400 miles, and consequently the amount of thatcircumference corresponding to seven hours out of the complete revolution oftwenty-four hours was 5,950 miles (20,400 x 7/24 = 5,950), or in round numbers6,000 miles. Hence, when Dante says that the sixth hour is 6,000 miles distantfrom us, he means that with us it is seven hours before noon, or an hour beforesunrise, the sun being regarded as rising at 6 a.m. The word Forse intimatesthat the calculation is made in round numbers.” For an analysis of the entireopening passage (vv. 1–15), see Salsano (Sals.1974.1), pp. 215–24.

[part0018.html#c30-s01-e] The phrase letto piano (level bed) refers to themoment when the sun’s midpoint is in the plane of the horizon. Grandgent (comm.to vv. 1–3): “The sun is below our horizon on one side, and the earth’s conicalshadow, projected into space, is correspondingly above our horizon on the other.As the sun rises, the shadow sinks; and when the middle of the sun shall be onthe horizon line, the apex of the shadow will be on the same plane in theopposite quarter.” [return to English [part0018.html#c30-s01-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c30-s01-i]]4–6. [part0018.html#c30-s02-e] For mezzo as “center of the sky,” in the senseof zenith, see Salsano (Sals.1974.1), pp. 222–24, and Chiavacci Leonardi(Chia.1997.1), pp. 825–26. For centuries this was the standard gloss. That is,commentators believed that Dante was referring to the midpoint of the StarrySphere, directly overhead. Porena (comm. to vv. 1–6 [= “Nota finale” to thiscanto]) sharply objected. How can the sky directly above an observer be thefirst part of the heavens seen growing lighter at the approach of dawn, whenobviously the eastern horizon is? He goes on to cite a text that, he says,explains this verse perfectly, Convivio III.ix.11–12, where Dante discusses theobscuring qualities of the earth’s atmosphere itself. Most of the commentatorswho follow Porena accept his explanation (a few even crediting him). See, forexample, Bellomo (Bell.1996.1), pp. 52–53. At least three aspects of Porena’sargument are, however, problematic: (1) Dante does not say that the predawn skygrows lighter first at its zenith, only that it does so, and does so verygradually; (2) his description seems to imply invariable phenomena (i.e.,celestial events that happen in the same manner every night at its juncture withdawn), while atmospheric hindrances are variable; (3) the relationship betweenthis and the following terzina is such that the process initiated in this one iscompleted in that, which would at least imply a continuous movement in thesecelestial “candles” becoming dimmer and finally being snuffed out. In short, itseems unwise to jettison the old reading for Porena’s. [return to English[part0018.html#c30-s02-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s02-i]]4. [part0018.html#c30-s02-e] For Dante’s cielo … profondo it has beentraditional (at least since the time of Lombardi [comm. to vv. 1–6]) to citeVirgil, Georgics IV.222, caelumque profundum.

[part0018.html#c30-s03-e] The traditional understanding, of uninterruptedcurrency until the last decade of the nineteenth century, is that the “brightesthandmaid of the Sun” is Aurora, who announces the arrival of her lord atsunrise. Scartazzini (comm. to verse 7), however (if without changing thatinterpretation), reminds us that Dante refers to the hours of the day as ancelle[del giorno] (Purg. XII.81, XXII.118). That bit of lore about the personifiedhours (which hardly dispatches the traditional literary association of Aurora asthe handmaid of the Sun indirectly referred to at Purg. IX.2, with itspresentation of the brightening predawn sky) remained offstage until Poletto(comm. to vv. 1–15 [of course not mentioning Scartazzini]) casually refers to itas his only comment on this verse. He was joined by Mattalia (comm. to verse 7[of course not mentioning either Scartazzini or Poletto]), who was the firstcommentator to insist that the first hour of the day is the particularbrightness referred to. However, several considerations cast serious doubt onthis solution: (1) It would be strange for Dante to have referred to the firsthour of the day as its brightest, since most would doubtless consider noon to bethat; (2) the passage refers to a gradual process (like that of the aurora ofthe Sun), while the passing of even a single minute when the Sun is rising ismarked by a dramatic change indeed; (3) it is difficult once the Sun rises tosee any stars at all, much less to watch a gradual extinguishing process acrossthe eastern half of the heavens. Perhaps it was such considerations thatgoverned the continuing response among the commentators, all of whom representedin the DDP remain wedded to the traditional gloss, Aurora. However, inexplicably(if tentatively), Chiavacci Leonardi (Chia.1997.1), p. 826, cites and acceptsMattalia’s interpretation. For the proposal of a totally new understanding, seeLeuker (Leuk.2004.1), who claims that the “handmaid” is Venus as morning star.He does not find it problematic that Venus will be referred to in verse 9,believing, rather, that both these periphrases refer to her.

[part0018.html#c30-s04-e] The lengthy and elaborate simile now presentsits second term: As the light of the stars in the dawn sky yields to theincreasing brilliance of the Sun, so the nine angelic orders, whirling aroundGod, extinguish their glow. The result is that their self-effacement encourageshim to yield to his desire, which is to look at Beatrice. [return to English[part0018.html#c30-s04-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s04-i]]11. [part0018.html#c30-s04-e] See Contini (Cont.1968.1), p. 1018, forrecognition of the self-citation here. The line contains a fairly obviousrevisitation, in the phrase “al punto che mi vinse” (around the point thatovercame me), of Francesca’s description of the punto in the Lancelot romancethat aroused her and Paolo (Inf. V.132): “ma solo un punto fu quel che ci vinse”(still, it was a single instant overcame us [italics added]). It is perhaps onlythe oppositional nature of this punto, not a “point” in a text describing sexualarousal, but God, the Point of the universe, that had kept the close resemblancein phrasing apparently unobserved for so many centuries. For other notice, seeHollander (Holl.1983.1), pp. 139–40, Dronke (Dron.1989.1), p. 32 (both withoutreference to any precursor), and De Robertis (Dero.1990.1), p. 141 (citingContini).

[part0018.html#c30-s06-e] The poet, seeing Beatrice at the edge ofeternity, as it were, begins his valedictory remarks by insisting that all hispreceding praise together would not do to fulfill the need he feels to expressher beauty.

As recorded in Vita nuova, Dante began to grow toward comprehendingthe meaning of Beatrice when he turned from poems about the pain his loving herhad caused him to those in praise of her (see VN XVIII.9).

[part0018.html#c30-s06-e] For the Latinism vice (here translated “thatwhich is due”), the commentators are torn among several possibilities. Perhapsthe most popular is the usage found in the Latin phrase explere vicem, meaning“to fulfill one’s duties,” probably the most likely sense of the word here. Butsee Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) for the majority opinion (which he doesnot share) that it means volta with the sense of “time” or “occasion.” Severaladd “place” to the possibilities, and there are still other options. Singleton(comm. to this verse) cites the other use of vice (at Par. XXVII.17), where itis paired with officio (duty), to argue that it therefore cannot mean that here;but see Scartazzini (comm. to Par. XXVII.17–18), who deals with vice as therebeing the “duty” of silence incumbent on the rest of the spirits while St. Peterfulfills his duty, which is to hold forth against papal turpitude, the two wordssharing a sense approaching that of synonyms.Scott (Scot.1977.2), p. 163, comments on the extraordinary incidence ofLatinisms in this canto, which he puts at fifty.

[part0018.html#c30-s07-e] Dante will see Beatrice once more, after sheresumes her seat in the Rose (from which she arose once, on 24 March 1300 [alsoMaundy Thursday according to Dante’s Idealized Earth Time], in order to drawVirgil forth from Limbo; and then again, around noon the following Wednesday, inorder to descend to the earthly paradise for her reunion with Dante). This,however, is his last attempt to describe her beauty, which has been increasingfrom his second description of it (in the heaven of the Moon, Par. IV.139–142)every time he sees her anew until now. That this “program” has come to its endis clear from the seven tercets (vv. 16–36) devoted to a final description ofher increased beauty, which offer a kind of history (esp. vv. 28–33) of thatbeauty’s effect on Dante.On the point of returning to her undivided attention to God, she is alreadybeing retransformed into a more-than-human being, pure soul, as it were, withoutthe hindrance of human concerns that she has taken on for Dante’s sake. Thusonly God can fully enjoy her beauty. [return to English[part0018.html#c30-s07-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s07-i]]22–27. [part0018.html#c30-s08-e] And thus the human poet who is speaking tous, confined by the two modes (and only two generic possibilities are referredto in the entire text, unlike De vulgari eloquentia, which mentions severalothers), tragic or comic, that are available to him, must acknowledge hisnecessary failure. The poem of the triumph of Beatrice needs a new genre, onethat Dante has defined at Paradiso XXV.73, and that shares with David’s psalms,expressing his love for God, the generic tag of tëodia (god song).For this last, see Barolini (Baro.1984.1), p. 277. Only a new form might seemcapable of describing such things.See Shaw (Shaw.1981.1), p. 196: “There is a chain of inadequacy in Dante becauseof the visionary nature of the experience he is describing. The mind cannotfully grasp what it experiences, because this transcends the human capacity forunderstanding; the memory cannot now recall even that which the mind did graspat the time; and finally, the poet’s words cannot do justice even to what he canrecall to mind. The poet’s words are three stages removed from what he isattempting to represent.”For discussion of reference here to Virgil and Dante as, respectively, writersof tragedy and of comedy, see Scartazzini (comm. to verse 24) and Hollander(Holl.1993.5), p. 10, n. 23.

[part0018.html#c30-s09-e] Like a mortal with weak eyes, unable evenmore than most to look directly at the Sun, the poet finds his inner sightblinded by the memory of this last and transformed beauty evident in Beatrice.Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 25–27) was apparently the first commentator (but notthe last, though none of the others cites him) to call attention to threepassages in the minor works that offer similar images, Vita nuova (XLI.6) andConvivio (III.0.59–60; III.viii.14 [this last the commentary on those verses]).It is amusing to discover that in the first case, it is Beatrice’s soul,ascended to Heaven, that is too bright for Dante to behold, while in the twopassages in Convivio the blinding is accomplished by the glow of LadyPhilosophy. The first is entirely germane to the present context, which hasBeatrice about to ascend to exactly where Dante first saw her seated in Heavenin the libello. Dante would have preferred, however, that we forget the second,in praise of the lady who replaced Beatrice in his affections.

[part0018.html#c30-s09-e] Porena (comm. to vv. 26–27) is perhaps the firstto discuss the two possible meanings of mente, “mind” (here with the sense of“intellect”) and “memory,” making a good case for the former, as we havetranslated the word. See also Maierù, “mente,” ED (III [1971]), pp. 899a–905a,who agrees (p. 902b). However, if it is his mind that Dante is separated from,in what specific ways ought we consider the possible meaning(s) of the verse?This is a difficult line to translate.

[part0018.html#c30-s10-e] If we accept the “history” put forward inVita nuova, the first time that he saw Beatrice was shortly before Dante’s ninthbirthday (VN II.1–2), thus no later than June of 1274, and probably a littlebefore then.

Are weto understand that that work, even if it records her being eclipsed in Dante’saffection by the donna gentile, nonetheless is about her? Or are we to imaginethat, since Dante has been through the rivers Lethe and Eunoe, he forgets hispast wrongdoing and remembers only the good in the history of his affections?”(Hollander [Holl.1993.5], p. 11, n. 26).

And thus Dante must leave her to a maggiorbando, the angelic trumpets’ heralding at the [G]eneral Resurrection.…[Beatrice] is better than all mortals because she is immortal, a condition[that] she shares utterly with her fellow saints. In a sense, Dante’s inabilityto sing of her results not from her being unique, but from her being absolutelythe same as all the blessed in her love of God” (Hollander [Holl.1993.5], pp.11–12).

[part0018.html#c30-s11-e] See Binni (Binn.1968.1), p. 1070, for aparaphrase of this verse: “il limite estremo delle sue forze espressive” ([at]the outer limit of his powers of expression).

[part0018.html#c30-s12-e] Rossi (Ross.1981.1 and Ross.1985.1), p. 65 andp. 89, respectively, points out that the word bando here looks back atPurgatorio XXX.13 in such a way as to make its meaning clear. All the earlycommentators who make an effort to identify the source of that trumpeting saythat it will be a later poet (Benvenuto [comm. to vv. 34–39] specifies “apoet-theologian,” in which judgment he is followed by John of Serravalle [comm.to vv. 34–42]); some, their discomfort more or less apparent, go along, perhapsbecause they do not understand to what else the sonorous reference might refer.That was the muddled condition of appreciation of this passage until Scartazzini(comm. to this verse) cut through centuries of weak responses and magisteriallysolved (or should have) the riddle once and for all (the text refers to thetrump of Judgment Day), even if his reward for doing so was to be ridiculed byPoletto (comm. to vv. 34–37) and to be ignored even by those relative few whoagree with him. Mestica (comm. to vv. 34–38), without reference to Scartazzini(do we hear the strains of a familiar tune? [see the note to Purg.XXX.115–117]), also settles on this daring but sensible explanation, as does DelLungo (comm. to vv. 34–38). Still more blameworthy than Poletto, Vandelli,revising his master’s work, simply substitutes his own version of the ancientview for Scartazzini’s radical new interpretation (comm. to vv. 34–36),attributing the trumpet blast to a “voce poetica più possente della mia” (poeticvoice more powerful than mine). In more recent times, Scartazzini’s position hasfound support in Rossi (Ross.1981.1), pp. 65, 72; Hollander (Holl.1993.5), pp.10–13 [with a review of the status of the debate]; Chiavacci Leonardi(Chia.1997.1), p. 830; and Ledda (Ledd.2002.1), p. 301. However, see Shaw(Shaw.1981.1), p. 197, for a return to the old solution, the bando will issuefrom “a greater poetic talent than his own.”For a similar problem, what Dante refers to by the phrase “con miglior voci”(with better words) at Paradiso I.35, and the utter unlikelihood that he mightbe thinking of future poets better than he, see the note to I.35–36.

[part0018.html#c30-s13-e] On these verses see Bortolo Martinelli(Mart.1985.1), pp. 113–14, arguing that the Empyrean is to be considered ashaving corporeal being. Dante (in Conv. II.iii.8) has been interpreted as sayingthat this was indeed the case. (Although there are those who do not hold to thisopinion, finding that Dante attributes this opinion to “Catholics” withoutnecessarily embracing it himself, this would not mark the first time that Dantechanged his mind about an opinion expressed in the Convivio). Here, however, itseems totally clear that Dante is reiterating his thoughts about the triformCreation (see Par. XXIX.22–24), which included pure form unalloyed with matter(i.e., the Empyrean and the angels). As Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 151, pointsout, if the Primum Mobile is the largest material sphere in the heavens, thatrequires that the Empyrean not be material, for it contains (i.e., is largerthan) all else.It is quite striking, as Aversano points out, that after Inferno II.21 Dantenever uses the word empireo again. It had, in fact, appeared more often in theConvivio (twice: II.iii.8 and II.xiv.19). [return to English[part0018.html#c30-s13-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s13-i]]39–42. [part0018.html#c30-s13-e] These four verses, weaving their threeline-beginning/ending nouns luce, amore, letizia into a knot expressing thenature of God’s kingdom (intellectual light and love, the latter yielding joy)in a pattern of linkage new to the poem, are perhaps calculated to offer a firstsense of the higher spiritual reality of the Empyrean.

Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 43–45) says the firstfought against the rebel angels, the second, against the vices. [return toEnglish [part0018.html#c30-s15-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s15-i]]44–45. [part0018.html#c30-s15-e] The poet, in his enthusiasm for incarnation,restrains himself only enough not to insist that the angels are seen as thoughthey, too, are embodied. There is no preexisting tradition that allows thisdaring invention (seeing the blessed as though they were already incarnate) onDante’s part. And yet, once we read his instruction, we accept their phantomflesh as a necessary element of his vision.This is all the more striking as we have just been assured that we left“corporality” behind when we left the Primum Mobile (vv. 38–39). See discussionin Scott (Scot.1977.2), pp. 164 and 179, and Hollander (Holl.1993.5), p. 14:“[T]his resubstantiation occurs exactly at the moment at which we haveapparently left corporality behind us.… ‘From nature and history to spiritualityand eternity’ is one way to translate [Beatrice’s] phrase.” [return to English[part0018.html#c30-s15-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s15-i]]46–51. [part0018.html#c30-s16-e] Again Dante is blinded by the light, one lasttime before he begins seeing the higher reality of God’s Heaven as it really is.The simile makes use of a fitting biblical precursor, St. Paul (see the note toverse 49).For the blending of scientific and biblical elements in this simile, see Gilson(Gils.2001.2), p. 56. [return to English [part0018.html#c30-s16-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c30-s16-i]]49. [part0018.html#c30-s17-e] Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 49–51) was apparently thefirst commentator to hear the echo of the passage in the Book of Acts (22:6)that features the fairly rare verb circumfulgere. Scartazzini (comm. to thisverse) also did so. Their view was shared by Poletto (comm. to vv. 46–51) and atleast nine commentators in the following century, from Torraca to Bosco/Reggio.Disagreeing with such as these, who think that Dante’s Latinizing verb formcircunfulse (shone all around) reflects the circumfulgere of Acts 22:6 (oreither of two other passages in that book), Dronke (Dron.1989.1), p. 37–38,insists on the greater relevance of Luke 2:9, the only other biblical passagethat contains this verb, describing the shepherds keeping watch on the night ofthe Nativity: “And the glory of the Lord shone around them” (et claritas Deicircumfulsit eos). Dronke objects to claims for a linkage here between Dante andSaul, “the fanatical persecutor whom the circumfulgent light blinds for threedays, stunning him into a change of heart.” However, what works against Dronke’shypothesis is the very context that he tries to turn against those who take thereference as being to Saul/Paul, since he fails to take into account thenoticeable fact that Dante, like Paul (and unlike the shepherds), is blinded bythe light. For Dante’s Pauline identity here, see Foster (Fost.1977.1), pp.70–73; Di Scipio (Disc.1980.1); and Shaw (Shaw.1981.1), p. 201: “There can be nodoubt that Dante expects us at this point to think of Saul on the road toDamascus.” And see Hollander (Holl.1993.5), pp. 14–15 (n. 34). Kleinhenz(Klei.1995.1), pp. 458–59, is also of this opinion; on p. 468, n. 5, he refersto Dronke’s hypothesis with dubiety, as does Bellomo (Bell.1996.1), p. 45, n.19.

[part0018.html#c30-s18-e] Beatrice explains that the blindingbrightness of the Empyrean welcomes all newcomers just as Dante is welcomed now(and will be again, we realize), prepared to see God face-to-face and to flamewith love for Him.

[part0018.html#c30-s18-e] The word salute (greetings), ever since itsteasing presence in the Vita nuova as meaning either “greeting” or “salvation”or an enigmatic union of the two, appears here, also, with ambivalent meaning.[return to English [part0018.html#c30-s18-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c30-s18-i]]55–60. [part0018.html#c30-s19-e] The protagonist is now ready for the finalstage of his journey, as is betokened by the fact that he has internalizedBeatrice’s words. Not all commentators agree that such is the case, claimingthat Dante is uncertain as to the source of the words, even that he may havespoken them himself. But see Benvenuto (comm. to these verses) who, withwhatever justification, has no doubt—the words are indeed spoken by Beatrice. Itcertainly seems a part of the protagonist’s preparation for being rapt in hisvision of God that distinctions between objective and subjective reality should831begin to break down. In Paradiso XXXIII.131 he will see himself in the imageof Christ. [return to English [part0018.html#c30-s19-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c30-s19-i]]61–69. [part0018.html#c30-s21-e] The last accommodative metaphor in the partof the poem that precedes seeing face-to-face presents what Dante observes withimperfect vision in such a way as to reveal the substance hidden in these“shadowy prefaces” (verse 78).For the river of light, and its possible dependence on a passage in theAnticlaudianus of Alanus ab Insulis (Alain de Lille), see Witke (Witk.1959.1).Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 196–202, discusses the complex way in which Dante’suse of metaphor morphs into absolute reality, which had first been available tohis still-strengthening mind as only an approximation of itself. [return toEnglish [part0018.html#c30-s21-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s21-i]]61. [part0018.html#c30-s21-e] Notice of the dependence of Dante on Apocalypse22:1 (“Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright ascrystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb”) apparently begins withthe author of the commentary in the Codice Cassinese (comm. to this verse).Sapegno (comm. to this verse) cites, as do many others, this biblical text, butadds St. Bonventure’s commentary to it: “Flumen aeternae gloriae est flumen Dei,plenum congregatione sanctorum.… Aeterna gloria dicitur fluvius, propterabundantiam; aquae vivae, propter indeficientiam; splendidus, propter munditiam;tamquam cristallum, propter transparentiam” (The river of eternal glory is theriver of God, filled by the congregation of the saints.… Eternal glory is saidto be flowing water because of its abundance; the water of life because it hasno impurities; shining because of its clarity; like crystal because of itstransparency). (The second most cited potential biblical source is Daniel 7:10.)Chiavacci Leonardi (Chia.1975.2), p. 16, reminds us that this is not a river oflight, but light in the form of a river. (See Jacopo della Lana [comm. to vv.61–69] for a similar understanding.) [return to English[part0018.html#c30-s21-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s21-i]]62–66. [part0018.html#c30-s21-e] Seeing metaphorically, as it were (thusreversing our usual practice, which is to understand the truth of things andthen express that in metaphor), the protagonist sees light in the form of ariver, its two banks covered with flowers, with sparks flying up and thensettling back down on the blossoms. All these elements will be metamorphosedinto their realer selves, a round stadium-rose nearly filled with saved souls,with angels (“bees”) moving quickly back and forth between the souls (“flowers”)and God (the “hive”). There is, as well there should be, general agreement aboutthe identities of these three elements, resolved from metaphor. The identity ofthe light in the form of a river is frequently passed over in silence. However,Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 61–63) was apparently the first to associate it withgrace.

[part0018.html#c30-s21-e] Exactly what adjective Dante set down (and whatit means) has been a matter of some dispute, with four possible choices(fulvido, fulgido, fluvido, fluido) doing battle over the centuries. SeeScartazzini, who rejects the last two, and supports most of the firstcommentators in choosing the first (or the second, which has, according to him,the same meaning). It means, he says, “resplendent.” Others, for instanceTorraca (comm. to vv. 61–63), say that Dante’s word derives from Latin fulvus(reddish yellow). [return to English [part0018.html#c30-s21-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c30-s21-i]]64–66. [part0018.html#c30-s22-e] For Virgil’s Elysian Fields as the model forthis passage, see Gmelin (Gmel.1957.1), p. 52 (his note to Paradiso XXXI.7). Forthe view that this passage may, in its own right, be a veiled first presentationof that text, see Hollander (Holl.1976.2), p. 240 (repr. Holl.1980.1, p. 38). Inthe Aeneid (VI.703–709), the protagonist is looking at the souls of the blessed,those happy inhabitants of the Elysian Fields. (At least they probably seemhappy to us when first we see them; but see the note to Par. XXXI.7–12 forAeneas’s eventual view.) In simile, they are compared to bees nestling inflowers. To Dante, not one to leave a fine poetic moment only as fine as hefound it, the “bees” are the angels, while the blessed are the “flowers.” Thisbecomes clearer in the next canto (see the note to Par. XXXI.7–12), as severalcommentators testify. Yet it is nonetheless true, once we see the allusion, thatwe can carry it back with us to this passage. And then we may begin tounderstand that, for all the apparent discarding of Virgil that sets the lastcantica apart from the first two, the Latin poet is rewarded by his greatestmedieval admirer with a new life in the conclusion of his poem. See Hollander(Holl.1983.1), p. 140; Rossi (Ross.1981.1), pp. 55–58; Rossi (Ross.1989.2), pp.306–7; and Hollander (Holl.1993.5), pp. 17–19, making the additional point (p.18) that the reference thus makes this reference, along with that in verse 49 toSaul, reverse the negative version of the protagonist’s typology (Inf. II.32).Where before, at least in the protagonist’s own view, he failed to match up tohis two precursors, now he is indeed the new Paul and the new Aeneas: Interea videt Aeneas in valle reducta seclusum nemus et virgulta sonantia silvae, Lethaeumque domos placidas qui praenatat amnem. hunc circum innumerae gentes populique volabant: ac veluti in pratis ubi apes aestate serena floribus insidunt variis et candida circum lilia funduntur, strepit omnis murmure campus.. . . And now Aeneas sees in the valley’s depths a sheltered grove and rustling wooded brakes and the Lethe flowing past the homes of peace. Around it hovered numberless races, nations of souls like bees in meadowlands on a cloudless summer day that settle on flowers, riots of color, swarming round the lilies’ lustrous sheen, and the whole field comes alive with a humming murmur. (Tr. R. Fagles [Viking 2006])This is a powerful moment in which Virgil’s and Dante’s mimetic proclivities areshown in their warmest tones; at least in Dante’s case we witness the imitationof nature engineered by another kind of imitation altogether. See McLaughlin(Mcla.1995.1), p. 5, for the distinction between mimesis of external reality andimitation of previous literature. And for an earlier brief discussion of thedistinction and of how the two techniques may be found joined, see Hollander(Holl.1975.2), p. 122.

[part0018.html#c30-s22-e] For the ruby set in gold, it has becomecommonplace, after Scartazzini (comm. to this verse), to cite Aeneid X.134:“qualis gemma micat, fulvum quae dividit aurum” (glittered like a jewel set inyellow gold [tr.

[part0018.html#c30-s23-e] For the inebriation of the angels, Scartazzini(comm. to vv. 46–81) cites the Psalms (35:9–10 [36:8–9]): “They feast on theabundance of your house, / and you give them drink from the river of yourdelights. / For with you is the fountain of life; / in your light do we seelight.” [return to English [part0018.html#c30-s23-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c30-s23-i]]68.

[part0018.html#c30-s24-e] Beatrice intervenes again, preparing Dantefor his baptismal ingestion of the waters of Life. Hollander (Holl.1969.1), p.196, and (Holl.1993.5), p. 19, points out that he has experienced “baptism” intwo previous scenes: Purgatorio I.121–129 and XXXIII.127–129. [return to English[part0018.html#c30-s24-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s24-i]]76–81. [part0018.html#c30-s26-e] His guide now explains what we may havealready understood, that what Dante was seeing was not really what he thought itwas, that it was only a “shadowy forecast” of its true nature.For the notion that all of Paradiso up to verse 90 is best conceived as a seriesof accommodative metaphors, see discussion in Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp.192–202; (Holl.1993.5.1), pp. 19–21.

[part0018.html#c30-s28-e] In nine lines Dante “drinks in” his“baptismal” “milk” and, as a result, has his vision transformed; he will shortlybe able to see the realities of Heaven as they truly are. This simile is theopening gesture in staging his identity as newborn “babe,” culminating inParadiso XXXIII.106–108.

[part0018.html#c30-s29-e] The conclusion of this simile is effortfulindeed: Dante “drinks” his “baptism”with his eyelids and thus moves his eyesightto the next level of seeing.

[part0018.html#c30-s30-e] In a single verse the meaning of Dante’s changed“eyesight” is manifest: For him time has become eternity; history has become itsown fulfillment in revelation. His previous linear sense of things has moved toa new dimension, the circularity of perfection. This new vision, unlike that ofsome, maintains its relation to the things of the world, which now for the firsttime may be really understood. See Paradiso XXXIII.88–90. [return to English[part0018.html#c30-s30-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s30-i]]91–96. [part0018.html#c30-s31-e] The first moment of face-to-face seeing ispresented with this simile. The protagonist now perceives the “flowers” as thesaints they are, the “sparks” as angels. While no one said so for centuries, theonly apparent “source” for this image of unmasking was a festive occasion, amasked ball of some kind. Poletto (comm. to vv. 91–96) somewhat uneasily defendsthe poet’s choice of material; however, the noun feste (lit., “festivals,” or“celebrations”) in verse 94 at least seems to help establish a frame ofreference. Nonetheless, Fallani (comm. to vv. 91–93) suggested that thereference is to masked actors. A potential literary source for this image hasapparently never been suggested. It is probably fair to say that most readersfeel puzzled as to the poet’s motivation at such an important moment.For another sort of unmasking, in which the protagonist again has his initialvision yield to a greater reality, see the note to Paradiso XXXIII.28–33.[return to English [part0018.html#c30-s31-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c30-s31-i]]95–99. [part0018.html#c30-s32-e] On identical rhymes, see Wlassics(Wlas.1975.1), p. 121. He points out that this repetition of vidi (I saw)underlines the claim for a poetics based in seeing and making seen. As severalcommentators have observed (apparently the first was Scartazzini [comm. to vv.97–99]), aside from the four occurrences of the identical rhymes of “Cristo”(see the note to Par. XII.71–75), there are only two other cases of tripleidentical rhymes in the poem, the bitterly ironic repetition of “per ammenda” inPurgatorio XX.65–69 and the occurrences of “vidi” here.Responding to the word’s presence in verse 61, Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 152,points to the repetitive pattern of the same form, vidi, in John’s Apocalypse(Apoc. 5:1, 5:2, 5:6, and 5:11). Dante uses that form seven times in all in thiscanto, the most of any canto in the cantica (Par. XVIII is the nearestchallenger, with six uses; however, Inferno IV, with its list of forty virtuouspagans whom the protagonist saw in the Limbus, has fully eleven appearances ofvidi; and in Purgatorio XXXII, there are eight. There are 167 occurrences ofthis form of the verb vedere in the poem, all but fourteen of them spoken by thepoet; exceptions include Virgil [at Inf. IV.53, VIII.25, and XXIX.25], theprotagonist [at Inf. XXIV.129], and several souls to whom Dante listens [Inf.XXVI.103, XXVII.79, XXVIII.71, XXXII.116; Par. XIII.136; XV.115; XVI.88, 91,109]). Vidi is one of Dante’s favorite locutions, reflecting his strategicinsistence on the reality of his experience. [return to English[part0018.html#c30-s32-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s32-i]]95. [part0018.html#c30-s32-e] The fiori (flowers) are the saved souls, thefaville (sparks) are the angels, as is commonly agreed (see the note to vv.62–66). We see them again in the next canto, verses 7–9, the sparks nowtransformed, in simile, into bees. Once we see that, we can understand thatthese first “real substances,” noncontingent and sempiternal, that we see“face-to-face” in the entire poem have models in a scene in the Aeneid(VI.703–708 [see the note to vv. 64–66]).

II.7–9), addressing God’s reflected light,possibly his grace (the ninth and final invocation will be addressed to God asluce, the source of light, in Par. XXXIII.67). [return to English[part0018.html#c30-s33-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s33-i]]100–102. [part0018.html#c30-s34-e] The first line of this tercet marks aborderline as sharply etched as that, involving similar stylistic traits,separating lower from upper Hell (Inf. XVIII.1): “Luogo è in inferno dettoMalebolge” (There is a place in Hell called Malebolge). Here the light of gracethat makes God visible to once-mortal souls introduces the final (and visionary)part of the poem. [return to English [part0018.html#c30-s34-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c30-s34-i]]100. [part0018.html#c30-s34-e] There is a certain amount of indecision in thecommentaries as to whether this lume is reflected light rather than its source(which would be luce). Some argue that it is the Holy Spirit, others Jesus asLogos, still others some form of grace. For this last, see Carroll (comm. to vv.100–123): “It will be noticed that I speak of this central circular sea as lumengratiae, for it is still the light of grace which once flowed in form of ariver; but that light of grace has now reached its perfect form of eternity, thelumen gloriae. The change of the river into the circular sea is Dante’s symbolicway of stating that the grace by which a soul is saved and strengthened topersevere to the end of the earthly life, is not something different in kindfrom the glory to which it leads. According to Aquinas, ‘grace is nothing elsethan a certain beginning of glory in us’ [ST II–II, q. 24, a. 3: ‘Gratia etgloria ad idem genus referuntur; quia gratia nihil est aliud quam quaedaminchoatio gloriae in nobis’], and the light of glory is simply the perfectedform of the grace of earth [ST I–II, q. 111, a. 3]. Aquinas is here laying downthe distinction between prevenient and subsequent grace.” Hollander(Holl.1993.5), p. 25, n. 63, claims that, among the first commentators, onlyBenvenuto (comm. to Par. VII.1–6) discusses the lumen gloriae (even ifelsewhere); but see his remarks on this passage (vv. 100–102) and those of hisstudent, John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 100–105). He does go on (correctly) tocredit Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 115–117) as being the first of the moderns todo so. [return to English [part0018.html#c30-s34-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c30-s34-i]]103–108. [part0018.html#c30-s35-e] The enormous size of the Rose may come assomething of a surprise. Dante never tells us the number of places that arefound there, whether it is the precise number (144,000) offered in theApocalypse (see the note to Par. XXXI.115–117), or the approximate number on thebasis of the “replacement value” of the fallen angels (see the note to Par.XXIX.50), or still another figure. There are some questions that we are simplynot encouraged to pose.The disc of the Sun, even populated by souls on thrones with first-classlegroom, would hold more saints than are imaginable, millions of millions. SeePoletto (comm. to vv. 100–105) for discussion of what Dante knew about suchmeasurements, including that of the diameter of the Sun, 37,750 miles accordingto Convivio IV.viii.7.The Rose is made up of a beam of light (the Godhead) reflected upward from theconvex surface of the Primum Mobile, which rotates because of its love for thatbeam and spreads its influence through the celestial spheres beneath it.This passage may help in understanding the difficult text at ParadisoXXVIII.13–15 (see the note thereto). There the poet, in the Primum Mobile, hashis first vision of the Godhead and the surrounding spheres of angels. Exactlywhere he sees them is a matter in dispute. This passage might help establishthat they are here (in the Empyrean) but are seen down there, on the surface ofthe Crystalline Sphere, whence they, along with the Rose, are also reflectedback up here.For the shape of the Rose as being neither a cylinder nor a cone, buthemispheric, see Kay (Kay.2003.1), pp. 46–48.

[part0018.html#c30-s37-e] In the vehicle of this simile, the stadiumin which the saints are seated is “personified” as a hillside that can look downto its foot and see itself, alive with spring (see the primavera of verse 63),reflected back up to its gaze. The tenor presents the seeing hill’s counterpart,the protagonist, as looking up (not down), and seeing, not himself, but all theblessed as reflections of the beam, reaching upward a thousandfold. (We areaware that Dante frequently uses this number as a synonym for an uncountablemultitude; see at least the next [and last] time he does so, Par. XXXI.131.)[return to English [part0018.html#c30-s37-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c30-s37-i]]115–117. [part0018.html#c30-s39-e] Daniello (comm. to this tercet) wonders, ifthe circumference of the lowest row in the Rose is greater than thecircumference of the sphere that holds the Sun (see the note to vv. 103–108),how great must be the circumference of the highest row, at least one thousandrows higher (and wider by a factor of at least one thousand times a probablyconstant yet indeterminate measurement).

[part0018.html#c30-s39-e] Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 109–117) saysthat the rows of the Rose “are like those in the arena di Verona.” He isfollowed by two modern commentators, Trucchi (comm. to vv. 118–123) and Sapegno(comm. to vv. 112–113). Trucchi, however, prefers the notion of GioachinoBrognoligo that the structure Dante has in mind is the Colosseum at Rome. BothDante’s more recent and more certain visit to the Arena and its greater intimacyas a built space give the edge to Verona.

[part0018.html#c30-s40-e] For a concise statement of the “resemblantdifference” of the Empyrean, its way of not relating and yet totally relating tothe literally underlying realms of the created universe, see Moevs(Moev.2005.1), p. 82: “The Empyrean is out of space-time, untouched by physicallaw; it is a dimensionless point, in which all is immediately present, a ‘space’of consciousness, in which the ‘sight’ of awareness ‘takes’ (prendeva) as itselfall it sees, all that exists.”As we will discover, Dante is allowed to see with a new sense of dimension,which abrogates spatial perspective and makes all things equidistant one fromanother (see Par. XXXI.73–78). This passage prepares for that one, and bothoffer further evidence of the poet’s extraordinarily vivid and inventivescientific imagination.

[part0018.html#c30-s42-e] Ever since Jacopo della Lana, the yellowhas been understood as the center of the Rose (the reader should remember thatDante is not talking about cultivated roses but wild ones, with their flatterprofile). Beatrice and Dante are standing at the midpoint of the Rose when shedirects him to look up and see the citizenry of the City of God.As has been suggested (see the note to verse 117), Dante may have found a modelfor the Rose in the Arena di Verona. The reader is in fact urged to visit thatplace, to find a way to walk, without looking up, into the very center of itsfloor, and then to experience the sight of the inner tiers of the amphitheater.And it is just possible that he or she then will share the experience that Dantehad there some seven hundred years ago. It really looks like the model for theRose, vast yet intimate. [return to English [part0018.html#c30-s42-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c30-s42-i]]124. [part0018.html#c30-s42-e] For the notion that Dante’s Rose is a kind ofcounterimage to the flower plucked at the end of the Roman de la Rose, with itsevident reference to the female pudenda, see Shaw (Shaw.1981.1), pp. 209–10.Shaw, who accepts Contini’s argument for attributing the Fiore, the sonnetsequence based on the Roman, to Dante, consequently argues that this passage isa “case of the mature poet making amends for the aberrations of his youthfulself” (p. 210). (For discussion of the status of these questions, Dante’sknowledge of the Roman and his authorship of the Fiore, see the note to Par.II.59–60.) Among the surprisingly few commentators to express an opinion on thismatter (one that no one considers unimportant), Mestica (comm. to vv. 115–123)raises the possibility that Dante had read it (and that he had written theFiore). Giacalone (comm. to vv. 124–129) cites Savj Lopez (Savj.1964.1), whothinks that Dante would have made allowances for the profane love championed bythe Roman and thus seen it as a worthy precursor.

[part0018.html#c30-s43-e] For the phrase bianche stole (white robes), seeits previous use at Paradiso XXV.95, where it clearly signifies the bodies to bereturned at the general resurrection. Beatrice has promised Dante that this isthe way the saved will seem to him, even though they are not yet resurrected,and so the phrase here allows us to understand that this is indeed how theyappear, in the flesh.For an overview of the history and significance of the concept of resurrectionof the flesh in the Western Church (with some consideration of Dante), see Bynum(Bynu.1995.1). For a close look at the importance of the resurrected body, inseveral writers preceding Dante and (primarily) in the Commedia, see Gragnolati(Grag.2005.1). For Dante’s sense of this subject, see also Jacoff (Jaco.1999.1and Jaco.2000.1).At least since reading Paradiso XIV.61–66 (the passage shows the first twogroups, the twenty-four contemplatives, who have shown themselves to Dante andBeatrice in the heaven of the Sun, all longing for their own resurrected fleshas well as for their saved relatives to regain their own), we have been awarethat there is something missing in the beatific life. Against more usual views,Dante presents the afterlife of those currently in Paradise as being less thanperfect (and less than perfected) because, against the orthodox notion thatblessedness itself is the ultimate and eternal reward, there is, according toDante, one thing that is felt as currently lacking: the resurrection of theflesh. Taught by Jesus (e.g., Luke 14:14) and insisted on by St. Paul, thatfuture event is promised to all the saved. However, the early medieval view(e.g., that of Augustine) was, unsurprisingly, that once with God, the conditionof the soul in a blessed and blissful member of the Church Triumphant wasalready perfected, both in what it knew and what it desired. The generalresurrection, promised by St. Paul (most extensively in I Corinthians 15:35–55),of course awaited that soul, but the admixture of corporality was only“decorative,” at least in a sense. Paul tackles that issue with what seems acuriously defensive insistence, against pagan (and Christian?) mockers (see Acts17:18 and 17:32), that the saved will indeed regain their own flesh in the longpassage in I Corinthians.Only months more than ten years after Dante’s death in 1321, his old nemesis,Pope John XXII, preached a series of sermons of which a central point was that,until the soul was reclad in its flesh, it would not see God, setting off ahorrified reaction within the Church, the eventual result of which was that thenext pope, Benedict XII, restored the earlier disposition of the matter, namely,that the saved soul immediately experiences both the highest bliss in and thefullest knowledge of God of which it is capable.Dante might have been amused to find that John XXII, whom he despised (see thenote to Par. XXVII.136–138), was in disagreement with him on this important anddivisive issue as well as on more pressing “political” concerns.

[part0018.html#c30-s44-e] For a global discussion of this finalpassage, see Hainsworth (Hain.1997.1), arguing that it not only fails to destroythe harmony or unity of this canto (a position shared by many—see p. 154n. for aconcise bibliography of the question), but that it is part of its integrity. Seethe similar opinion of Salsano (Sals.1974.1), pp. 232–34, and of Hollander(Holl.1993.5), pp. 31–33.For an attempt to “save” this passage despite itself, see Bosco/Reggio (comm. tothese verses), who concede that Dante probably should not have turned aside fromcontemplating things eternal and divine for such a feverish concern with merecontingency, compounding that “fault” by putting this earth-centered speech inthe mouth of holy Beatrice, and as her last utterance at that. One can hearawareness of centuries of complaint behind their words. To be just, one mustadmit that this concern with earthly things seems inconsistent with the usualsort of piety. No one ever said (or should have) that Dante is “usual” in anyrespect at all. [return to English [part0018.html#c30-s44-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c30-s44-i]]130–132. [part0018.html#c30-s44-e] There are only two possible considerationsof the significance of the few places left in the Rose: Either there are veryfew good people alive (or who will be born before the end of time), or the endis coming faster than we think. That we should combine these two responses seemsprudent. However, for Dante’s possible sense that there are some fifteen hundredyears left to run in history, see the note to Paradiso IX.40.

[part0018.html#c30-s45-e] Silverstein (Silv.1939.1) deals with thesurprise that most readers exhibit at the empty throne of the emperor being thefirst object that the protagonist sees in the Empyrean by reminding us of thefar more ample medieval tradition that displayed vacant seats in heaven awaiting“humble friars and simple monks” (pp. 116–17) rather than emperors. He thus seesthe salvation of Henry VII not in terms of his imperial mission (failed as itwas), but as an “accolade of kingly righteousness” (p. 129), showing that, inpassages in the Gospels and one in the Vision of Tundale (see p. 124 and n. 19),Dante had available testimony to the personal justness of those kings who,rather than merely ruling them, truly served their people. (He might havereferred to Dante’s praise of William the Good; see the note on Par. XX.61–66.)However, it is probably a mistake to accept, as Silverstein does (p. 128), thenotion that, with Henry’s failure to establish lasting imperial rule in Italy“died all of Dante’s hope on earth.” For a view, apparently shaped in part bySilverstein’s, that Dante had essentially given up his hopes for an imperialresurgence because of the derelictions of the fourteenth-century papacy, seePeters (Pete.1972.1), who goes further than Silverstein in seeing Dante ashaving modified his imperial hopes. But see Goudet (Goud.1974.1) and Rossi(Ross.1981.1), pp. 43–50 (with a rejoinder to Peters on p. 49) for a moreconvincing sense of Dante’s continuing imperial hopes.For Dante’s fifth Epistula (addressed to the princes and peoples of Italy) asrechanneling biblical and liturgical reflections of Christ’s majesty onto HenryVII, see Rigo (Rigo.1980.1).For Henry VII as the seventh divinely selected emperor treated in the poem, seethe last paragraph of the note to Paradiso VI.82–91.

[part0018.html#c30-s46-e] For Henry’s first naming, see Paradiso XVII.82,where his betrayal by Pope Clement is clearly referred to.

[part0018.html#c30-s48-e] This concluding passage, with its rancoragainst the ecclesiastical enemies of the imperial idea, has disturbed many, whofind it entirely inappropriate as Beatrice’s last utterance in a theologicallydetermined poem. One must admit that it may seem out of place in a Christianpoem, with its necessary message of the unimportance of the things of the worldcoupled with Jesus’ insistence that we forgive our enemies. Such a sensibleview, however, disregards the thoroughgoing political concern of the poem anddoes not deal with Dante’s stubborn insistence on the rectitude of his vision ofthe world order (see Hollander [Holl.1993.5], pp. 32–33).The thirtieth cantos of the final cantiche are united, as Claudio Varese noted(Vare.1953.1), p. 25, in at least two major respects: They are cantos ofdeparture for both beloved guides; they also are both “cantos of Beatrice,” thefirst of arrival, the second of return (to the point of her departure, her seatin Heaven, as described in Inferno II.71, 101–102).If we can remember our first reading of the poem, we will perhaps recall oureventual and retrospective surprise upon discovering that these were the lastwords spoken by Beatrice in the Divine Comedy. We, like the protagonist, havegotten used to her guidance. Unlike Virgil’s departure, which is prepared foreven as he enters the poem (Inf. I.121–126), Beatrice’s departure is a totalsurprise (see the note to Par. XXXI.102). [return to English[part0018.html#c30-s48-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c30-s48-i]]142–144. [part0018.html#c30-s48-e] This tercet undoubtedly is a last nastyglance at Pope Clement V, who made a show of welcoming Henry VII to Italy butthen worked assiduously behind the scenes to defeat the emperor’s efforts tounite her cities under his rule (see the note to Par.

[part0018.html#c30-s49-e] Simon Magus gave the “naming opportunity” toDante for the third of the Malebolge (see Inf.

The reference, of course, is to Pope Boniface VIII,seen as forced deeper into his hole (that of the simoniac popes) by the adventof Clement, who now will be the topmost, and thus able to wave his burning solesabout in Hell. Dante didn’t know it, but Clement’s time would exceed that ofBoniface, who waved his feet from 1303 to 1314. In the unwritten continuation ofthis poem, Clement would have twenty years in the relatively open air of thebolgia, since John XXII did not die until 1334 (surely Dante felt he wasdestined for eternal damnation, and would have continued to do so, especiallyhad he learned of John’s unenlightened views on the resurrection of the flesh[see the note to verse 129]).

[part0019.html#c31-s01-e] For the resemblance of Dante’s candida rosa tothe rose-wheel windows of medieval cathedrals, see Leyerle (Leye.1977.1). Heargues for the double significance of this design: the wheel of Fortune, symbolof the fleetingness of earthly success, and the rose, symbol of a higher andmore ordered affection (one particularly related to the Blessed Virgin). He thengoes on to suggest that Dante has this design in mind both in his depiction ofFortune’s wheel (Inf. VII) and of the Rose found here in the Empyrean. Leyerlealso believes that a particular rose-wheel window was in Dante’s mind, the onethat was completed in the façade of the basilica of S. Zeno in Verona at leastby 1300. On the exterior of S. Zeno, carvings of human figures, all four of whomare either falling or rising, strengthen his first case; the lovely tracing ofthe light on the inner spaces of the cathedral are at least not unlike thedesign found in Dante’s Rose. However, see Scott (Scot.2002.1), p. 477, citingBarnes (Barn.1986.1, pp. 25 and 31, n. 30) for the argument that the term for“rose window” only begins to appear in the European vernaculars, first inFrance, in the very late seventeenth century. This is hardly conclusive evidencethat Dante did not think of one of these round, large, beautiful, and many-huedglass structures, piercing stone and splashing the interior space with coloredlight, as the model for his Rose. (In fact, Migliorini-Fissi’s lectura of thecanto [Migl.1989.1], pp. 609–11, certainly lends credence to Leyerle’s argument;while she does not mention his article, but does note two later treatments foundin Di Scipio’s fifth chapter [Disc.1984.1] and in Demaray [Dema.1987.1], shepoints out that the idea was first broached in 1870 by Ozanam.) The term may beanachronistic, but nothing in Leyerle’s case depends upon the availability ofthe term. And if one were to select a particular window, Leyerle has chosenwell. Verona was, at least for two lengthy periods in both decades of thefourteenth century in which Dante lived, the focal point of his life as anexile, at least until his removal to Ravenna probably in the final third of thesecond decade. San Zeno was (and is) an astoundingly beautiful church. [returnto English [part0019.html#c31-s01-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c31-s01-i]]1. [part0019.html#c31-s01-e] Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 1–3) sees that the adverbdunque (then) is pointing to a previous discussion (Beatrice’s first descriptionof the Rose, in Par. XXX.124–132, “interrupted” by the “digression”[XXX.133–145] of her bitter words about Henry’s death and the corrupt recentpopes Boniface and Clement). With “dunque” the poet announces his return to herprior subject. The word’s casual, “vernacular-sounding” nature caught theattention of Scaglione (Scag.1967.2), as is reported by Scott (Scot.2002.1), p.476. Both of them refer to the term brought to bear in Dante studies by Auerbach(Auer.1958.1), sermo humilis, for the low style, in their classification of thislinguistic gesture. Scott admires the juxtaposition of dunque with candida rosa(luminous white rose) as the expression of Dante’s union of the low with thesublime.Vellutello (comm. to vv. 1–3) was apparently the first commentator, in a longtradition, to link the “bianche stole” (white robes) last heard of in ParadisoXXX.129 with the adjective candida (luminous white) modifying rosa. Grandgent(comm. to this verse) is one of only two in the DDP to suggest a source inAlbertus Magnus (De laudibus beatae Mariae Virginis [XII.iv.33]): “Et nota, quodChristus rosa, Maria rosa, Ecclesia rosa, fidelis anima rosa,” equating Jesus,Mary, the Church, and the faithful soul of a believer with the rose.For the fullest bibliography for this canto available in print, see Costa(Cost.1996.1), pp. 78–85.

[part0019.html#c31-s03-e] The angelic host is given simileticexpression. At first, by Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 7–9) andBenvenuto (comm. to vv. 4–12), these bees were seen as deriving from AeneidI.430–431. However, from Vellutello (comm. to vv. 4–12) onward, commentatorshave heard the more relevant echo of the simile at Aeneid VI.703–709 (for thattext, see the note to Paradiso XXX.64–66).The conclusion of Rossi’s study (Ross.1989.2), pp. 313–24, accounts for thedisparities in the two similes by showing that the situation in the Aeneid, froma Christian perspective, is less propitious than it first may seem. As a centralcase in point, Aeneas discovers that all these happy shades are about to be(from Dante’s perspective) “reincarnated.” We can hardly imagine the joy felt bythe hero of this “epic” when he sees the souls in the Rose as they will lookwhen they are resurrected. Surely we are meant to remember Aeneas’s quitedifferent reaction, when he learns from Anchises about the flesh that thesesouls in the Elysian Fields will bear with them as they return to the world andits toils. Indeed, Aeneas laments their return to the world of flesh (Aen.VI.719–721). In the post-Platonic Aeneid, the world of flesh has nothing to dowith spiritual perfection; in Dante’s poem the beatified spirit has only asingle unfulfilled desire: to be granted the return of its flesh. Thus, if Danteallows Virgilian text a renewed presence in his poem, he is not without theironic distance that we have found present in even the first moments of the poem(for example, see the notes to Inf. II.28 and II.56–57).For other possible sources for this passage, e.g., in St. Anselm and St.Bernard, see Scott (Scot.2002.1), p. 478. For several different passages inBernard, see the following: Carroll (comm. to vv. 1–12), Torraca (comm. to theseverses), Casini/Barbi (comm. to verse 7), and Trucchi (comm. to vv. 4–12), whoalso cites Anselm. A few later commentators also make gestures in both thesedirections, if without furnishing texts.A discussion of the elaborate structural play in this simile is found in Lansing(Lans.1977.1), p. 37. The vehicle and tenor of the simile each mirrors bothmoments in the movement of the bees/angels, first down to the flowers/souls,then back up to the hive/God.

XXX.64–66),Virgil’s verb (insidere) for what the bees do at least suggests that, more thansettling on the blossoms, they enter them. Thus Dante here follows Virgilfaithfully, if others seem to believe he does not (see Bosco/Reggio [comm. tothis verse]).

[part0019.html#c31-s03-e] The word laboro is obviously a deliberateLatinism, since lavoro, Italian for “labor,” is metrically the same, and Dante’shand was not forced by rhyme.

[part0019.html#c31-s04-e] We are given a clue as to the separate“dwelling” of God. Fallani (comm. to vv. 40–42) discusses the fact that amongthe Scholastics there was a tradition of a second “heaven” in the Empyrean, thecoelum Trinitatis (the heaven of the Trinity), a “place” distinct from theEmpyrean, where dwelt the triune God, separated from the blessed souls. InFallani’s opinion, Dante accepts that tradition. It is, however, not clear thathe does. Perhaps he both honors and abrogates it, for his God is not in an“eleventh zone” of the heavens, but in the one He shares with the saints—if in ahigher and thus different locus from them (the distance between the “floor” andthe top tier of the Rose is greater than that between the lowest place in thesea and the highest place beneath the Moon [see the note to vv. 73–78]; thedistance between that point in the Rose and God would seem to be infinite). Andthus Dante can have things both ways: Is God separate from the saints? Yes andno. He is infinitely farther aloft than they, but that does not require that He“inhabits” another “place,” especially since His “habitation” is everywhere andnowhere. It seems clear that Dante intends to avoid this issue, of which he musthave been aware. For the presence of the phrase coelum Trinitatis, in a contextthat is related, see Thomas Aquinas, Super Evangelium S. Matthaei lectura (51.2,referring to Psalm 36:11 [37:11] and Matthew 5:5, “The meek shall inherit theearth”; Aquinas explains that the terra [earth] promised them is the Empyrean).It is not entirely clear, but he seems to think of the Empyrean and the coelumTrinitatis as though they might be considered one and the same.

[part0019.html#c31-s05-e] Dante’s description of the angels, flamingred faces, golden wings, and white “bodies,” is possibly based in biblical textsas well as popular iconography (as found, for instance, painted on churchwalls). Quite a few biblical sources have been a part of the indeterminatediscussion down through the centuries. Perhaps the only sure citation (for theangels’ red faces) is Scartazzini’s (comm. to verse 13): Ezechiel 1:13: “theirappearance was like burning coals of fire,” which has quantitatively the mostsupport. A second at least likely attribution is Tommaseo’s (comm. to thistercet), who, for the white, cites Matthew 28:3: the angel who appears at thetomb of Jesus, his vestments “white as snow” (some later commentators join [orsubstitute] Matthew’s supposed “source,” Daniel 7:9). The gold has severalsuggestions based in Daniel 10:5, but this is not convincingly chosen, since thegold there described is that found on a belt, not on wings.As for the “allegorical” meaning of the three colors, nearly all can agree thatthe red faces bespeak angelic love. However, the other two are the cause ofdisagreement. Some, unconvincingly, propose the Trinity (Love, Wisdom [?], andPower [??]); others select various abstractions, not much more convincingly.There is a general understanding that the angels and their colors are perfect inthree respects: They love perfectly, fly on immortal pinions, and have “bodies”that are utterly pure. And that is probably enough. [return to English[part0019.html#c31-s05-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c31-s05-i]]17–18. [part0019.html#c31-s06-e] In Dante’s lovely transposition, these bees,now having gathered the “pollen” (God’s love) from the hive, bring “honey” backfrom the hive to the souls: a celestial variant on nature’s apiary artistry.These flowers have a second chance to enjoy their own (now enhanced) sweetness.Dante’s “honey,” like God’s love and their love for Him, is bidirectional.As Augustine knew and taught, mortal love can never satisfy or be satisfied:“inquietum est cor nostrum donec requiescat in te” (restless is our heart untilit finds rest in you—Confessiones I.1). These two words, pace and ardore(“peace” and “love”), can be found together only here in the Empyrean, never inDante’s world below.

XXVIII.25–27), do not hinder in any wayeither His ray from reaching the saints in the Rose or their ability to make outHis splendor (which Aversano [Aver.2000.2], p. 159, particularizes as the SecondPerson, Christ, irradiated by the Father). Torraca (comm. to vv. 22–24) remindsus that, in Convivio (III.vii.5), Dante had in fact said that the angels were asthough translucent (diafani). Indeed, all of them, those who believed in Christto come and those who believed after the fact, are gazing lovingly on the triuneGod. [return to English [part0019.html#c31-s07-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c31-s07-i]]22–23. [part0019.html#c31-s08-e] See Paradiso I.2 and the note to verse 5,above. Thus Dante, nearing his ending, reflects his beginning, a way of alsosignaling that the poem is approaching its conclusion. [return to English[part0019.html#c31-s08-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c31-s08-i]]25–27. [part0019.html#c31-s09-e] We now see all the saints doing what, as wewill learn in the next canto, they always do, looking up, fixing their gaze onGod. There is no variety in Heaven, nor is it desired by the blessed.We also learn, in that canto, what is intrinsic only to what we see here. Thereare more Jews in Heaven than Christians. This puzzled some commentators andinfuriated others, the first group claiming that Dante could not possibly havemeant this, the others believing him only too well. Pretty clearly Dante’s neatdivision of the Rose into two equal parts, with a few empty seats in theChristian half and none in the Jewish one, is meant to force that conclusionupon a reader. As far as we know, there are only a very few gentiles among theHebrew group. In fact, we know only that there are two, Cato (there thus shouldbe at least one empty place in the full half, as Cato is still mindingPurgatory) and Ripheus (Statius and Trajan were both alive in Christian times).Dante’s point is clear: More Jews believed in Christ without the authority ofHis presence, as certified by the witness provided by the New Testament, thandid Christians, even though they were given the answers before they took theexam. [return to English [part0019.html#c31-s09-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c31-s09-i]]28–29. [part0019.html#c31-s10-e] In verse 27 the saints are said to aim theirgaze at a single target. Now the poet speaks of that single essence as a “star,”but also as the Trinity, a “threefold Light,” bringing joy to all the blessedwho behold it (and they all do). Some of the early commentators are less clearthan they might be that this is not an “invocation” or part of the prayer thatDante will address to God in verse 30. This is an example of apostrophe, one ofpraise, and not part of a request. [return to English [part0019.html#c31-s10-e]/ Italian [part0030.html#c31-s10-i]]30. [part0019.html#c31-s10-e] The poet then addresses God, praying that Helook down at the “storm” afflicting mortal lives on earth. Is there an implicitfurther request to be understood here? Most of the commentators think so. Andall of them who are of this opinion believe that Dante is asking God tointervene on behalf of storm-tossed mortals. However, it seems at least aslikely that he means no such thing. Rather, as the reference to Florence (verse39) might also suggest, God ought to look down at the spectacle of human sinwith grim recognition of the lostness of those living now on earth, almost allof them beyond redemption. Apparently the first to offer so point-blank anegative reading was Roffarè (Roff.1968.1), p. 1107. What stands in the way ofaccepting this pessimistic interpretation is the highly possible presence of acitation of a passage, first cited by Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 28–30), inBoethius’s Consolatio (I.m5.42–48): “O God, whoever you are, who joins [sic] allthings in perfect harmony, look down upon this miserable earth! We men are nosmall part of Your great work, yet we wallow here in the stormy sea of fortune.Ruler of all things, calm the roiling waves and, as You rule the immenseheavens, rule also the earth in stable concord” (tr. R. Green). Also germane isMonarchia I.xvi.4, first cited by Torraca (comm. to vv. 28–30): “O human race,how many storms and misfortunes and shipwrecks must toss you about while,transformed into a many-headed beast, you strive after conflicting things” (tr.P. Shaw). This last is part of the bitter conclusion of the first book of thattreatise, and would not encourage one to believe that, if Dante were thinking ofit here, he foresaw any sort of divine aid coming to the human race. On theother hand, see the prophecy concluding Paradiso XXVII, which does predict God’spositive intervention in the affairs of men (similarly presented as a storm atsea [fortuna]—see the note to Par. XXVII.142–148). It is thus difficult todecide what the author intended us to gather about the nature of his request forGod’s attention.

[part0019.html#c31-s11-e] In this lengthy simile the poet comparesbarbarians, probably coming, in times of peace, from northern Europe to Rome,seeing the imperial buildings of the city before Constantine gave thosebuildings to the papacy just after his conversion in 312, to himself, moving inthe opposite direction, “south” to “north,” from Florence to the New Jerusalemabove the heavens.The magnificent church of St. John Lateran was destroyed by fire in 1308. Makingthings worse, Henry VII, denied a coronation in St. Peter’s by Pope Clement, wascrowned in the ruins of that church in 1312, nearly exactly one thousand yearslater, and died the next year (see note to Paradiso.XVII.82–84).For a discussion of the various notions of what exactly Dante meant by thereference, see Costa (Cost.1996.1), pp. 65–66.

The nymph Helice or Callisto was transformed into the constellation ofthe Great Bear, and her son Arcas or Boötes into the Little Bear: Metam.II.496–530, especially 515–517; cf. Purg. XXV.131.

[part0019.html#c31-s13-e] The phrase “a people just and sane” is thethird and last in a series of parallel pairs, with the parallelism inverted inthe third term: good/bad, good/bad, bad/good. See Paradiso XVI.152, whereFlorentines in “the good old days” were portrayed in much more positive terms.Now things have changed, and Florentines are those left behind in order forDante to associate with such people as they once were, now found only in Heaven.[return to English [part0019.html#c31-s13-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c31-s13-i]]39. [part0019.html#c31-s13-e] This is the fifteenth and last time we hear theword Fiorenza in the poem; we first heard it in Farinata’s voice (Inf. X.92).While in fact Florence had replaced Rome as the greatest city of Italy, Dantehere reverses that equation, making old Rome the type of the celestial city,while new Florence is portrayed as the city of the lost.

[part0019.html#c31-s15-e] The second simile in a series of threededicated to the theme of pilgrimage (see the note to vv. 103–111), this onepresents Dante as a traveler to a shrine, a journey he has vowed to make. Forthe pilgrimage motif in the entire poem, see Holloway (Holl.1992.3).While Dante leaves the particular shrine he may have had in mind shrouded insilence, the early commentators variously suggested the Church of the HolySepulchre in Jerusalem, St. Peter’s in Rome, and St. James of Compostella inGalicia (Spain), the three most important destinations for pilgrims in his day.[return to English [part0019.html#c31-s15-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c31-s15-i]]48. [part0019.html#c31-s16-e] The Tuscan word for “now” (mo) was first heardat Inferno X.21 and leaves the poem after a dazzling three uses in a single line(and the twenty-third through twenty-fifth in all), perhaps underlining Dante’sdesire to be considered a vernacularizing poet even at the sublime height of theEmpyrean. The effect of the triple presence of the word accents the eager natureof his glance, unable to move quickly enough in taking in every aspect of theplace he has so long desired to see, the goal of his pilgrimage. Verse 54describes Dante’s similar hurried and eager glances cast around the Rose in theattempt to take it all in.

The last time we heard it was in the poet’s description of Virgil whenhe was running up the slope of Mount Purgatory (Purg.

[part0019.html#c31-s19-e] Compare the similar scene in PurgatorioXXX.43–54, when the protagonist turns back to speak to Virgil, only to find himgone. This scene, clearly reflective of that one, is much briefer and in analtogether different key. That one is three times as long, and in the tragicmode. Here, the disappearance of Beatrice has a quite different tonality. Amongthe differences is that she disappears from the “floor of the arena” only toreappear in her place in the Rose (see verse 71).

Are we supposed to wonder? Or is this mere “realisticdetail” (i.e., are we merely supposed to reflect, “Of course, anyone would havea lot of questions during a first visit to Paradise”)? Some commentators,however, try to ascertain what questions Dante wanted to ask. For example,Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 55–57): Dante wants to know the identities ofthose seated in the Rose; or Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 52–57): Dante wants to knowwhere Mary and Beatrice are seated. Poletto (comm. to vv. 52–57) loses patiencewith such attempts, urging us not to seek what the poet has chosen not toreveal. Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 43–57) had solved the riddle acceptably,if obviously and unprofitably: Dante had questions about Paradise.… Steiner(comm. to these verses) has the wisest response: These lines refer to thequestions that St. Bernard will eventually respond to, reading them in God. Infact, this is a rare occasion on which almost everyone is essentially correct.Bernard does answer Dante’s voiced question (Where is Beatrice? [verse 64]) andone unvoiced one (Where is Mary? [verse 100]). He also in the next canto names agood number of souls seated in the Rose, as Jacopo suggested he might and asBernard says he will (vv. 97–99).

[part0019.html#c31-s20-e] In place of Beatrice, he finds, near him onthe “floor” of the Rose, an “old man” (it will turn out to be Bernard, but we donot know that yet), looking like the other blessed souls.

XXXII.40–75),who point out that by portraying Bernard as an old man (sene), Dante isviolating a commonly understood ground rule of Paradiso, that all souls are, intheir perfected beings, of the age of Christ in His last year on earth, when hewas thirty-three. (This is sometimes given as thirty, thirty-three, thirty-four,or even thirty-five.) Why Dante chose to violate this “rule” is not clear.Bosco/Reggio opt for an artist’s rebellion against a view that would inhibit hisartistic virtuosity, an old Bernard being more believable than one in hisrenewed youth. And see Carroll (comm. to Par. XXXII.1–48), discussing the babesseated in the lower half of the Rose: “Further, as we saw in the case of Bernardhimself, Dante appears to ignore the doctrine of Aquinas that in theResurrection the saints will rise at the age of thirty. Bernard, himself an oldman, draws his attention to the child faces and voices of the lower ranks (Par.XXXII.46–48). Each soul, apparently, wears the form proper to the age it hadattained on earth, freed of course from weakness and defect of the flesh. Danteevidently felt that there would have been something incongruous in makingbabies, who had never exercised true choice, appear full-grown in the flower oflife. (Augustine thought otherwise: infants would receive ‘by the marvellous andrapid operation of God that body which time by a slower process would have giventhem’ [De civ. Dei, XXII.xiv].)” [return to English [part0019.html#c31-s20-e] /Italian [part0030.html#c31-s20-i]]63.

For a similar scene, see Inferno II.109–112, whereBeatrice tells how Lucy came to her exactly where we see her now and got her toleave this seat in order to go into Limbo to enlist Virgil’s aid.

The poet has already explained (Par. XXX.121–123) that inthe Empyrean, the usual physical laws that we know on earth are suspended.In a sense, Dante here “disinvents” the as-yet-to-be-discovered technique ofperspectival representation that would distinguish Italian painting of the nextcentury.

[part0019.html#c31-s26-e] See Scott (Scot.2002.1), p. 485, for thisstriking word (effige), which is used only here and in Paradiso XXXIII.131, thusfurther associating Beatrice and Christ.

[part0019.html#c31-s27-e] Apparently, the first commentator to pay anyconscious attention to the protagonist’s switch from the honorific voi, inaddressing Beatrice, to the affectionate tu, was Grabher (comm. to vv. 70–93),if he does not make much out of it. Porena (comm. to vv. 79–90) also notices thechange, but has quite a strong sense of what it signifies, only appearing to bea closing of the distance between them, but being in fact a distancing, becauseit is the tu addressed to a saint, or that is proffered both to God and to Mary.Indeed, both God and Mary, in Christian theology, have the unique gift of beingdivine and human simultaneously—as does Beatrice. Nonetheless, Chimenz (comm. tovv. 79–84) admires Porena’s formulation. Giacalone (comm. to vv. 79–84) is alsoin their camp. A different view is advanced by Singleton (comm. to verse 80),one that proposes that the guide has become the individual soul of Beatrice(Singleton retains his sense that the guide is “allegorical,” while theindividual is not, a judgment that some would dispute in its first instance,others in the second). Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 82–84) also support Porena’sthesis.For a different view, see Hollander (Holl.2001.1), pp. 126–27, pointing outthat, as in the Vita nuova, Beatrice in Heaven may indeed be addressed with tu,“only when she is at one with God, where and when there are no humanhierarchies.” The fact would seem to be that these eleven second-person-singularpronouns and verb endings (in only twelve verses) do indicate a more personalsense of affection, in a sort of uncontrolled outburst of personal enthusiasm,allowable now that they are on an equal footing as lovers of one another in God.We cannot imagine Jesus addressing Mary as Voi.

[part0019.html#c31-s27-e] For the figural equation, Beatrice as Dante’s“Christ,” see Hollander (Holl. 1969.1), p. 261. After calling attention to thepoet’s last words to Virgil in the poem (Purg. XXX.51), “Virgilio a cui per miasalute die’mi” (Virgil, to whom I gave myself for my salvation), he thencontinues as follows, discussing this tercet: “At Dante’s beginnings we do wellto have in mind his endings, and vice versa. It is Beatrice, the figure ofChrist, who brings Dante to salvation; it is Virgil who brings Dante toBeatrice. Dante does not (and did not in the Vita nuova) use the word salutelightly. His last words to Virgil give him the highest function anyone less thanChrist can perform, and that is to bring another to Christ.” In this vein, seeScott (Scot.1973.1), p. 570. See also Iannucci (Iann.1995.2), p. 483 (citing hisearlier article [Iann.1979.1]), who also notes Beatrice’s Christlike attributesin this passage (as, once again, does Scott [Scot.2002.1], p. 486). This hasbecome more or less the standard interpretation of those considered by some inItaly to be part of a so-called scuola americana, “the American school (of Dantestudies).” And see Pasquini (Pasq.2001.1), p. 254, remarking on the“near-heterodoxy” of these verses.To be honest, this reading seems so obvious that one feels apologetic forharping on it. However, to understand what blinders Dantists accustomedthemselves to wearing whenever they came near the border of so “blasphemous” atheologized poetic for the poem, see the allegorizing glosses of such asBenvenuto da Imola (comm. to this tercet). In his reading (and he is far frombeing alone in it), Beatrice becomes “theology” who comes down to this “hell onearth” (our world, not Limbo) in order to bring her message to all mortals(including, we assume, Dante Alighieri). This is so flagrantly wrongheaded thatone has to admire Benvenuto at least for his stubbornness in not yielding to aChristological interpretation of Beatrice nor to a personal one of Dante, who,in his treatment, is only a stand-in for all humankind. This, one of the mostpersonal moments of the Commedia, is thus turned into a kind of simplemindedversion of an uplifting moral tale, one only implausibly attributed to thegenius of Dante. Reviewing responses to this passage in the DDP, one finds theword “Christ” only in Singleton’s commentary (to verse 91) of 1975. How did (ordoes) anyone read this passage and not think of Christ’s descent into Hell andHis subsequent Harrowing of the Hebrew saints?

[part0019.html#c31-s29-e] The typological equations (Beatrice = Moses;Dante = the Hebrews) once again align Beatrice with Christ. See the note toverses 79–81.

[part0019.html#c31-s34-e] Bernard names himself, having sounded like alyric poet of Dante’s youthful acquaintance talking about his lady, associatinghimself, however, not with a Giovanna, a Lagia, or a Selvaggia, but with theBlessed Virgin Mary. Everything about this moment comes as a surprise. We didnot anticipate a new guide in the poem, if Dante surely decided that he wantedto have a chance to bid farewell to Beatrice, as well as to present her as beingback in bliss. In addition, perhaps for reasons reflecting his personal devotion(for a possible confirmation, see Par. XXIII.88–89), he wanted a guide moreassociated with Mary for this highest part of the poem (not that Beatrice wouldhave been in any way unqualified); perhaps he also felt a numerological tug indeciding to have a trinitarian third instructor. Still, one sympathizes withthose who feel that there is something ungainly about the substitution ofBernard for Beatrice. (See the discussion in Botterill [Bott.1994.1], pp.64–115.) And no one who defends the advent of a new guide can argue that it hasbeen at all prepared for, as was Beatrice’s (as early as Inf. I.121–126).Pertile (Pert.2001.1), pp. 67–69, goes so far as to argue, if not particularlyconvincingly, that Dante had planned (and the first sign of such a plan revealeditself, according to him, in Inf. II.24–25, with the indication of Mary, Lucy,and Beatrice) to have Beatrice replaced by Lucy. Whatever one thinks of thatsolution, one must admit that there is a problem here, one that a few strokes ofthe quill could have avoided. However, see Mazzoni (Mazz.1997.1), who insists onthe influence of Bernard’s work (or that which Dante considered Bernardine)behind the text of the poem from its outset. And see Iannucci (Iann.1995.2), pp.481–82, for the notion that the surprise of Bernard’s presence is only a tacticto alert us to his importance for Dante. A series of essays discussing thereflection of several of Bernard’s writings in the Commedia is found in Aversano(Aver.1990.1). For a summary of Bernard’s importance for Dante and of thepresence of his writing behind the cantos in which he appears, see Carroll(comm. to vv. 118–142). For the possible influence of Bernard’s De diligendo Deoon the structure of the entire poem, see Hollander (Holl.1976.2, repr.Holl.1980.1, pp. 33–38). And see the notes to Purgatorio XXVII.139–141 andParadiso XXXIII.127–132. For a compact treatment of Bernard’s life, see RaoulManselli, “Bernardo di Chiaravalle, santo,” ED (I [1970]), pp. 601a–5b, which,however, skirts the question of the actual literary influence of Bernard onDante. For an introductory treatment in English, one may, in addition toBotterill, consult Gardner (Gard.1913.1), pp. 111–43.Dante does not refer to Bernard’s urgent and frequent support of the SecondCrusade (1145–1147) in his preaching. For a study of this crusade, inevitablylinked to the adjective “disastrous,” see Constable (Cons. 1953.1). Dante’ssilence is perhaps not surprising, given its failure.Bernard names himself only at the end of his speech (vv. 94–102). The impressionof humility is perhaps less pronounced than when similar behavior was exhibitedby both Thomas Aquinas (Par. X.82–99) and Cacciaguida (Par. XV.88–135), whoindeed speak longer before naming themselves. Nonetheless, his comportment isclearly intended to portray his modesty.

[part0019.html#c31-s35-e] This long but essentially simple similelinks Dante once again with a pilgrim arriving at his destination, in this caseRome, where the Veronica, a most holy relic, was preserved. Veronica wassupposedly a woman of Jerusalem who offered Jesus a cloth (sudarium) to wipe theblood and sweat from His face on the way to Calvary. His features remained onthe cloth, which was eventually taken to St. Peter’s in Rome, where it wasdisplayed to the faithful on certain occasions. That her name was actuallyVeronica is doubtful, since her name itself means “true likeness” (vera icona).The whole history of this image (and of other relics like it, particularly theShroud of Turin) is controversial. But for Dante, there was not even a questionof its authenticity. See his earlier reference, at the climactic moment of theVita nuova (XL.1), to pilgrims on their way to Rome to see the Veronica, amoment fulfilled here in this poem by Dante’s pilgrimage to “that Rome whereChrist Himself is Roman” (Purg. XXXII.102).See Lansing (Lans.1977.1), pp. 137–40, for consideration of three consecutivesimiles in this canto (see also vv. 31–40 and 43–48) dedicated to the theme ofcompletion of a pilgrimage.

It was believed that Bernard, in suchmeditation, had a foretaste of the peace of Heaven. In the Meditationespiissimae (XIV, 36–37), ascribed to Bernard, there is a rhapsody on the joys ofcontemplation. See also Bernard, Sermones in Cantica Canticorum, XXIII, 15–16.As noted above, Dante in his Letter to Can Grande (Epist. XIII, 80) refers thereader of his Paradiso to Bernard’s work De contemplatione.” [return to English[part0019.html#c31-s37-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c31-s37-i]]112–117. [part0019.html#c31-s38-e] Dante, in fixing his gaze on Bernard, whohas descended from his seat in the Rose upon Beatrice’s urging (see verse 66),has fixated on a lesser version of the good and true than that which Bernardwill eventually bring him to see. At least for now the Virgin is the best sightavailable to him, and she is at the very highest point, in the top row of thestadium-rose.

The Apocalypse numbers the saved as144,000 (Apoc. 7:1, 7:4; 14:1, 14:3). Landino (comm. to Par. XXX.133–138)reports that some say that the number of blessed is equivalent to the number offallen angels, while others are of the opinion that it is the same as that ofthe remaining good angels. (For Dante’s previous opinion on a related matter,see the note to Paradiso XXIX.50.) Landino concludes that only God knows thenumber of angels, as Aquinas says.

[part0019.html#c31-s40-e] This passage is seamless, a single action,Dante’s raising his eyes (verse 118) at Bernard’s command and seeing Mary,surrounded by angels and admired by the rest of the blessed. It is like apainting of the Virgin seated in glory. However, since it is only like apainting, the poet introduces his central scene with a double simile, eachelement of which begins “e come.”Until now, we have been shown the Empyrean with a long-range perspective, seeingall the Rose as a unit divided into many parts. Now we focus on a single part ofit and are presented with a new sense of graduated selectivity, in which thethings that are nearest Mary are brightest, while those farthest from hergradually fade from view. [return to English [part0019.html#c31-s40-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c31-s40-i]]118–123. [part0019.html#c31-s40-e] The first simile pairs Mary with thebrightness of the Sun at its rising, as compared with the entire rim of the sky.We are asked to imagine a 360° view: The east and the parts of the horizonnearest it are brightest, the west, where the Sun lit up the horizon the eveningbefore, the darkest. As we will see, this arrangement is perfectly mirrored inthe varying brightness of parts of the Rose. [return to English[part0019.html#c31-s40-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c31-s40-i]]124–129. [part0019.html#c31-s42-e] In the second simile, the brightness at thelocus of the rising Sun is contrasted with the diminished light on either sideof it, and is compared either to all the Rose or to Mary (see the note to verse127).Once again, as in the first of these conjoined similes (vv. 118–123), the variedlightness in parts of the Rose is insisted on.

[part0019.html#c31-s42-e] Rhyme forces Dante into synecdoche, the parttemo (yoke-beam, or chariot-pole [i.e., that to which the horses are attached])for the whole (chariot). For other occurrences of this word (timone in modernItalian), see Purgatorio XXII.119; XXXII.49, 140, 144; Paradiso XIII.9.

[part0019.html#c31-s42-e] We last heard of Phaeton, a frequent presencein the poem, in Paradiso XVII.3 (see the note to XVII.1–6). Why Dante wants torecall that tragic adventure here is not immediately evident. [return to English[part0019.html#c31-s42-e] / Italian [part0030.html#c31-s42-i]]127. [part0019.html#c31-s43-e] This arresting oxymoron, “peaceful oriflamme”(or “battle flag of peace”), has a varied history in the commentaries. Mosttrace its origin to the French royal battle standard. Scott (Scot.2002.1), p.488, points out that, whereas many contemporary commentators say that thisbanner of the French kings, maintained at St. Denis, was red, it was actuallyred and gold, as its Latin derivation makes plain (auri fiamma [golden flame]).See Oelsner’s brief exposition (comm. to this verse), which, however, reversesthe more usual relations between the red and the gold: “The Oriflamme (aureaflamma) was the standard given by the Angel Gabriel to the ancient kings ofFrance, representing a [red] flame on a golden ground. No one who fought underit could be conquered. The golden glow of heaven is the invincible ensign not ofwar but peace.”Most who write about this verse play up the opposed values of the two elementsin this image, Mary’s peaceful conquest as opposed to the French (or any) king’smilitary exploits. However, we should remember that this gathering, too, is anarmy, if now a triumphant one, with all but a final battle (that of thereturning Christ against Antichrist at the end of days) behind it. (For a viewin absolute disagreement with this one, see Porena [comm. to this verse].) Whilethere is some dispute about whether the oriafiamma is Mary alone, all the Rose(including her), or some portion of the blessed souls distinct from her, seeTrucchi (comm. to vv. 124–129) for an interesting solution. The oriafiamma isthe entire Rose, Mary is the golden flame, the rest of the blessed (the petalsof the “rose”) the red background. While this is not in accord with the minorityexplanation of what is figure, what background, it surely is worth seriousconsideration for its complete explanation of all the elements in the image.However, it is clear that Mary is the light referred to as the Sun in bothsimiles.

[part0019.html#c31-s46-e] Dante’s verb imaginar (referring to the mind’sability to receive and store images received from outside it) is quite differentfrom the more modern instance of the word, with its clear reference to inventionof things not previously seen by the imaginer. See the note to PurgatorioXVII.13–18. [return to English [part0019.html#c31-s46-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c31-s46-i]]139–142. [part0019.html#c31-s47-e] The canto concludes with Bernard, famous asthe “lover-poet” of Mary, gazing, alongside her newest “lover-poet,” DanteAlighieri. His awareness of Bernard’s affection for her makes his own all themore ardent.For a recent discussion of whether or not Dante is to be considered “a mystic,”see Botterill (Bott.2003.1), who is mainly in the affirmative. It is difficultto believe that the final cantos of the poem, so obviously reflective of a greatmystic, St. Bernard, and so triumphantly presenting a final vision, can bethought of as separate from the tradition of Western mysticism. At the sametime, it is difficult to think of the earlier ninety-seven cantos of the poem asbeing essentially mystical in character. Thus the best answer seems to be “no”and “yes”—in that order. But see Scott (Scot.2004.2), pp. 407–8, for a cautiousdenial of even this much mysticism in Dante’s poetry. One supposes that some(who find Dante’s poetry more like Blake’s than not) think of him as a mystic,while others (who do not so find) deny that he is one.

We heard it first in Purgatorio II.118,used in malo, for Dante and the newly arrived souls who are seduced by Casella’ssong and require Cato’s reprimand in order to get back on their path toward God.It then appears in Purgatorio XXXII.1, where it describes Dante’s gaze, fixed onBeatrice, trying to slake his ten-year “thirst” for her presence. Thatrepetition was perhaps intended to counter the first instance, the context ofwhich was the song that Dante had composed in favor of Beatrice’s rival, theLady Philosophy (her identity at least according to the Convivio [first atII.xii.9]). Now it is used a second time in bono, here referring to Dante’s new“lady,” the Virgin. Unlike the last one, this ocular gesture does not reflectthe rejection of one lady in favor of another. In Heaven there may be nomarrying, but there is no limit to the number of objects of one’s affection.[return to English [part0019.html#c31-s47-e] / Italian[part0030.html#c31-s47-i]]"},{"pageContent":"PARADISO XXXII [part0019.html#c32-e]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. [part0019.html#c32-s01-e] The opening verse of this canto has causedconsiderable difficulty. Without reviewing the various responses (for which seeScartazzini [comm. to this verse]), we should say that we have followed fairlyfreely Scartazzini’s basic understanding, which takes “affetto” as being, here,a Latinism, formed out of the past participle (adfectus) of the deponent verbadficior (influence), and thus, loosely here, “intent upon” or “absorbed in.” Asfor the noun piacer, we take it here not as “beauty” but as Bernard’s “delight”in Mary. See also Tozer (comm. to vv. 1–2).Perhaps the most compelling gloss to this opening word of the canto is found inAversano’s commentary (Aver.2000.2), p. 165. He, as did several moderncommentators before him (e.g., Mestica and Mattalia [comms. to this verse]),traces the source of affetto to the past participle of the verb afficere, withthe resulting sense of being affixed, or conjoined. Aversano attributes thissense of the word to St. Bernard on two occasions (PL CLXXXIII.1297,CLXXXIII.1384). [return to English [part0019.html#c32-s01-e] / Italian[part0031.html#c32-s01-i]]2–3. [part0019.html#c32-s01-e] Porena (comm. to vv. 1–2) suggests that Bernarddoes not interrupt his personal adoration of Mary in order to carry out his newresponsibility, as doctor (teacher), but names the inhabitants of the Rose frommemory. This task, along with allied concerns, will occupy vv. 4–87 of thecanto.As Aversano points out, the adjective santo (holy) occurs more often in thiscanto than in any other. In fact, it occurs here seven times. [return to English[part0019.html#c32-s01-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c32-s01-i]]4–18.

It offers an “instant replay” run backward, undoing theuniversal effect of the wound of Original Sin, incurred by Eve’s eating of theforbidden fruit, when Mary gave birth to Jesus. Mary’s position in the Rose,seated with Eve at her feet, reinforces that understanding. [return to English[part0019.html#c32-s02-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c32-s02-i]]8. [part0019.html#c32-s03-e] Jacob’s first and second wives, Leah and Rachel,as we saw in Purgatorio XXVII.100–108, represent (as they were traditionallyunderstood as doing) the active and the contemplative life, respectively.Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 166, points out that, according to Richard of St.Victor, in his Benjamin major (PL CXCVI.62), Rachel, as the first stage ofcontemplation, dilatatio (expansion), an identity she shares with Beatrice,yields to the second stage, represented by the son she died giving birth to,Benjamin, or sublevatio (i.e., being raised up), who has a counterpart in thepoem, of course, in Bernard, Dante’s Benjamin. That state in turn yields toalienatio (ecstasy), the passing beyond human limits to experience things asthey are in themselves, absolute reality. Aversano also cites PL CXCVI.52 andCXCVI.170.

This perhaps indicates that such anidiosyncratic pattern is meant to reflect the individual identity of thebeholder. It thus results that Dante is like everyone else in being uniquelyunlike everyone else, an only apparently paradoxical insight later developedcentrally by Michel de Montaigne.It does not seem to have caught the attention of any commentator that Beatrice’sname appears in the ninth verse of the canto, that is, accompanied by heridentifying (and trinitarian) number. Beatrice is named here for thesixty-second time. (For the last, see Par. XXXIII.38. Her name thus occurs overa span of ninety-nine cantos [her first nominal appearance is in Inf. II.70].)See the note to Purgatorio XV.77.Costa (Cost.1996.1), p. 70, makes a telling point: Beatrice’s presence in theRose scotches any attempt to conclude that her status in the poem is merely“allegorical.” [return to English [part0019.html#c32-s03-e] / Italian[part0031.html#c32-s03-i]]10. [part0019.html#c32-s04-e] Sarah, Rebecca, and Judith were among the OldTestament heroines harrowed by Christ. Sarah was the wife of Abraham and motherof Isaac; Rebecca, the wife of Isaac and mother of Jacob; Judith, the savior ofthe Jews from Assyrian captivity when she murdered Holofernes (see Purg.XII.58–60).

[part0019.html#c32-s04-e] Ruth is identified only by periphrasis and inher role as the great-grandmother of David, also indicated by periphrasis. He isrepresented by his sins of adultery and murder (Bathsheba and Uriah), thesetting for Psalm 50 (51), Miserere mei (Have mercy on me), which served as thetext of Dante’s first spoken words as character in the poem (Inf. I.65). For themeaning of David for Dante, see the notes to Purgatorio X.65 and ParadisoXX.37–39. And see Carroll’s discussion of a common theme behind at least most ofDante’s choices (comm. to vv. 1–48), which offers another reason for thereference to David: “[T]hey were all regarded as types of the Church, and theyare for the most part ancestresses of Christ according to the flesh (Rachel andJudith alone are not in the direct line of our Lord’s ancestry. Judah, throughwhom the descent flows, was a son of Leah; and Judith had no children [Judith16:22]): Ruth, for example, is described as the bisava, the great grandmother,of David, for the purpose, apparently, of indicating the descent of the Virgin,and therefore of her Son, from that king. The manner in which David is referredto—‘the singer who for sorrow of his sin said Miserere Mei’ (Ps. 51[50]:1)—while apparently irrelevant to the question of descent, is in realityclosely connected with it. Matthew 1:6 states plainly that ‘David the king begatSolomon of her that had been the wife of Urias.’ The reference therefore toDavid’s repentance for his great sin, so far from being irrelevant, suggests inthe most delicate way the continuation of the descent through Solomon.” [returnto English [part0019.html#c32-s04-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c32-s04-i]]13–15. [part0019.html#c32-s05-e] Bernard indicates many more saints than weactually hear him name; therefore, we probably assume, the poet’s selection ofthe eighteen who are named is not casually arrived at.

[part0019.html#c32-s06-e] These Hebrew women, the seven whom we havejust heard referred to by name or by periphrasis, are only the beginning of along line down the Rose (until we would come to the first Hebrew female child,we assume) that separates pre-Christian and Christian saints. As Aversano(Aver.2000.2), p. 166, points out, neither Eve (obviously not a descendant ofAbraham) nor Ruth (who was from Moab) can properly be considered Hebrews,despite Dante’s insistence.Singleton (comm. to vv. 40–42) believes that Dante intends us to believe thatthe dividing “walls” of Hebrew women and Christian men reach all the way to the“floor” of the Rose, and that thus the lower half of them are surrounded bybabies. That seems a dubious notion, although Dante does not clearly portray thesituation. If “neatness counts,” he may have expected us to imagine a line ofsmiling Hebrew female babies looking across the Rose at equally happy Christianmale babies, while spreading out to either side of those two lines are babies ofthe other gender, the first half of them of their own religion, the second groupof the other.

[part0019.html#c32-s09-e] Dante once again insists on the absence ofsome saints-to-be in the Christian half of the Rose (the only place for which hespecifies the eventual tenant is the throne destined for Henry VII [see theconclusion of Par. XXX]). He also refers to semicircles in order to alert us tothe fact that there will be a matching descending line, one composed entirely ofmales, beneath John the Baptist. To Mary’s left and John’s right sit the Hebrewsaints; to her right and to his left, the Christian ones. It is not stated, butseems clear, that we are to picture two different semicircles, with the midpointof their arcs located at Mary and John, containing male saints (beneath Mary)and female saints (beneath John), except for the bisecting line, which isgendered as is each of them.

[part0019.html#c32-s11-e] John’s epithet gran (exalted) reflects, in theopinion of a great number of commentators, beginning with Scartazzini (comm. tothis verse), Matthew 11:11: “[A]mong those born of women there has arisen no onegreater than John the Baptist.” [return to English [part0019.html#c32-s11-e] /Italian [part0031.html#c32-s11-i]]32–33.

XII.130).Once Dante studies became more “scientific,” in the nineteenth century, we mighthave expected that a great “detective” of Dante’s reading habits, Edward Moore,would have started to set things right in this respect. However, when he takesup this subject in Scripture and Classical Authors in Dante (Moor.1896.1), pp.291–94, he is both tentative and hesitant, lest he overstate the importance ofAugustine to Dante. Here are his concluding words (p. 294): “I must confess, inconclusion, that I have not been able as yet to investigate the question ofDante’s probable acquaintance with the works of St. Augustine nearly as fully asthe subject seems to deserve. I am continually coming on fresh points ofresemblance. There is, however, always this element of uncertainty, that many ofhis theories or arguments are reproduced by Aquinas, …” One does not want toblame Moore for the general underappreciation of Augustine’s importance forDante. Nonetheless, the great scholar’s hesitance undoubtedly affected others,who felt excused thereby from studying the problem as carefully as it “seems todeserve.” For better appreciations, if not the central study that is still badlyneeded, see Mazzoni (Mazz.1967.1), passim; Newman (Newm.1967.1); Fallani(Fall.1976.1); Freccero (Frec.1986.1), especially pp. 1–15; Mazzotta(Mazz.1979.1), esp. pp. 147–91; Wingell (Wing. 1981.1); Took (Took.1990.1);Hawkins (Hawk.1991.2). Like Hawkins, Sarteschi (Sart.1999.1) believes that thereis a widespread and often unacknowledged interaction between the texts ofAugustine and those of Dante.Augustine knew that imperial Virgil had to be resisted publicly and spiritedly,and yet he makes his Confessions a sort of epic Mediterranean countervoyage (seeHollander [Holl.1969.1], p. 12 and n.), in which the pivotal municipal momentoccurs not in an imperial monument in Rome but in a church in Milan. And if thetext is seemingly a-Virgilian, even anti-Virgilian, it is nonetheless studdedwith Virgilian references. If that sounds suggestive of Dante’s later treatmentof Virgil in his Christian epic, the differences are perhaps not so very great.See the note to Paradiso XII.130 for discussion of the appearance of Augustine’sname (but not the saint) in Paradiso X and XII. And see Seem (Seem.2006.1), p.82, pointing out that these two nominal presences arouse our expectations, butwhen Augustine finally does appear (Par. XXXII.35), he is only a word fromhitting the cutting-room floor, as it were, to be included, unbeknownst to us,among the unnamed others (e altri) seated in the Rose. This close call (andDante’s playful game with the reader over Augustine’s fate in the Danteanafterworld) may possibly be explained by the fact of Augustine’s strenuousopposition to the imperial (and republican) Roman ideal. Thus the Augustiniantale of two cities, which extols the City of God and its embattled earthlyprecursor, the Church Militant, but has no room for the empire in its worldview,is the work of an enemy. There is no question but that Dante knew Augustine’swork and admired it deeply—as theology, but even as theology only up to a point,for that theology permeates his historical vision, and vice versa. And the pointthat divides these two thinkers is Rome. [return to English[part0019.html#c32-s12-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c32-s12-i]]35. [part0019.html#c32-s12-e] See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse): Dominicis not here only because his Order used the Augustinian Rule and the threeothers mentioned here, Augustine, Benedict, and Francis (to name them inchronological order), each composed the Rule for his Order. Others have tried towrestle with the apparently slighting omission of reference to Dominic here,made all the more troublesome by the fact that in Convivio (IV.xxviii.9), Danterefers to Benedict, Augustine, Francis, and Dominic (in that order). There theyare exemplars of the religious life. Among the early commentators, onlyFrancesco da Buti apparently felt that the omission required comment. Herevisits Thomas’s insistence (Par. XI.40–42) that what is said in praise of one(Francis) is to be understood equally of the other (Dominic).

[part0019.html#c32-s12-e] From Bernard’s remark at vv. 14–15, where hesays that he will name many other saints in the line descending from Mary, wesurely assume that this line beneath the Baptist, probably composed of otherreligious leaders, was also identified, but not reported. See the note to vv.13–15. [return to English [part0019.html#c32-s12-e] / Italian[part0031.html#c32-s12-i]]37–39. [part0019.html#c32-s13-e] John Carroll (comm. to vv. 1–48) was perhapsthe first to claim that the arrangement of the named souls might have aniconographical effect: “It is not likely to be accidental that the Rose is thusblessed with the sign of the Cross on each side.” The design formed in the Roseby those who are named is possibly reminiscent of the T or tau, the emblem ofthe cross so important in the iconography of St. Francis, as Fleming, amongothers, has demonstrated (Flem.1982.1), pp. 99–128. Francis knew that Ezechiel(9:4) had said that the faithful would all be marked with the tau on theirforeheads and took it as his particular version of the sign of the cross.When we consider the saints in the order they are named (the numeration isprovided in the diagram below), our sense of that is reinforced, since the poetfirst fills up the I-stem of the figure (plus the idiosyncratic adjunct ofBeatrice, for which see the note to verse 9), then arranges the bar of the T ina chiasmus (15-14-13-16), and then finally adds its foot, chronologicallyordered (Anne, then Lucy).[../images/00012.jpeg]Montanari (Mont.1974.1), p. 256, points out the symmetries in the arrangement ofthis seating plan of Heaven; the stadium is divided into corresponding zones bythe following six groups, further sorted into three pairs: Old Testament, NewTestament; Men, Women (both of these groups on horizontal axes); Adults, Infants(on a vertical axis).Since our subject is Dante, it will come as no surprise to the reader to learnthat even this diagram (above) is controversial. While there is consensus amongsome, perhaps expressed in the clearest and briefest terms by Pernicone (Pern.1965.1), p. 109, there is a surprising amount of disagreement over what seemsclose to self-evident. Among the issues found variously among the discussantsare the following: (1) Do the indications “left” and “right” (vv. 121–124)indicate directions from the protagonist’s perspective or from (respectively)the Virgin’s and John’s? (2) Does Dante consider Lucy and Anne as figures whoshould be present in the “Christian” or “Jewish” section of the Rose, and has hebotched his placement of them as a result? (3) How many rows are there in thiscelestial stadium?(1) There are intensely held views on either side of this issue. For adiscussion of these, see Russi (Russ.1968.1), pp. 1176–87, who devotes a majorportion of his lectura to a labored attempt at resolving the directionalindications in the canto. Picone (Pico.2002.8), p. 494, is matter-of-fact indeclaring that we are seeing them from the perspective of Dante’s left andright. Such a view would require that the reader imagine the post-Advent saintsas seated to Mary’s left, and those pre-Advent to her right. It is true that thepoet does not make their disposition clear, leaving us to deal with thequestion. On the other hand, placing the New Testament figures to Mary’s leftwould seem an implausible choice. God would not be so rude a host to theseheroes of Christianity in forming His Eternal Seating Plan.(2) The question of the arrangement of the two souls on either side of John theBaptist (see vv. 133–138) has also been strangely controversial. Severalcommentators contrive to put Lucy to John’s right, believing her a pre-Christianfigure. Russi (Russ.1968.1), p. 1187, accepting this arrangement, goes on toargue that she is not the historical Lucy, but a symbol of illuminating grace.(It is surprising how long it was until a commentator treated Lucy ashistorical, the third-century martyr from Syracuse; the first appears to havebeen Portirelli [comm. to vv. 136–141] in the early nineteenth century. Did hisprecursors really believe that Dante had granted an allegory a seat in Heaven,in which it would eventually wear its own flesh?) The situation barely improvesin more recent times, when, even after Lucy of Syracuse has entered thecommentary tradition, some moderns revert to the age-old error.(3) Picone (Pico.2002.8), p. 495, discussing verses 16–18, which enumerate theseven levels of the stadium down from Mary through Ruth, goes on to extrapolatefrom that passage an erroneous supposition, namely, that there are only thatmany rows in the upper half of the Rose. From that assumption he (onlylogically) calculates that the lower half (the kindergarten, as it were) must becomprised of the same number of rows (seven). However, what we know does notaccord easily with his hypothesis. See, for the vast upward expanse of the Rose,Paradiso XXX.115–118 and XXXI.73–75 (where we learn that Beatrice, not even inthe highest rank of the Rose, is at a distance even greater than that betweenthe lowest point on earth and the farthest reach of its atmosphere). If we wereto accept Picone’s calculations, we would have to understand that a mere twelverows of the Rose rose upward in that vast a space. (Not to be preferred areother attempts at numerical precision, even if they seem properly moregrandiose. See, for instance, Russi, p. 1169, citing G. Barone in 1906 as havingcalculated the rows as numbering 1,290.) Indeed, the text itself makes it quiteclear that there are more Hebrew women beneath Ruth, forming the dividing line.(What it doesn’t tell us is whether the line stops at the halfway mark [see thenote to vv. 40–48] to be continued by female Hebrew babies, or whether, as atleast Singleton believes, it goes all the way to the Rose’s “floor” [see thenote to vv. 16–21]). Further, if Dante accepted, at least as an approximateguide, the canonical 144,000 who make up the citizenry of the Empyrean (see thenotes to Par. XXX.103–108 and Par. XXXI.115–117), Picone’s fourteen rows wouldeach need to seat more than ten thousand souls. To be fair, he was led to thisview by his arguably possible interpretation of the word soglie (either “seats”or “tiers”; he chooses the former). That, however, is to neglect the clearsignificance of the word soglia at Paradiso XVIII.28, which clearly illuminatesthe next use of the word at verse 13 of this canto; in both these uses Dante isfairly obviously referring to “rows” and not individual “seats.” Perhaps therhyme position helps explain the use he made of an expanded meaning of the word.Other, if less noticed, problems about the population of the Rose are caused bythe location of Beatrice’s presence in it. This is obviously idiosyncratic tothis particular viewer, since it is the only element not part of a balanceddesign. And, compounding that problem, her placement itself seems to beproblematic, out of order. From what we are nearly forced to extrapolate fromthe arrangement seen in the top row, the center lines divide male from female onboth sides of the Rose. Thus Beatrice should be next to a male (e.g., Benedict).Iconography apparently trumped the boy-girl ordering principle in Dante’s mind.Further, he had boxed himself into this arrangement in Inferno II.102, whereBeatrice says that Lucy came to her in Heaven where she was seated next toRachel. In any case, there does not seem to be a way around the fact that inplacing Beatrice next to Rachel, Dante has violated his own unstated but clearlyformulated rules. The following arrangement is based on the left-right axis asprovided for in item (1), above.

[part0019.html#c32-s13-e] All those commentators who believe that Dante“doesn’t mean” what he indicates, that in Heaven for the Last Judgment andgeneral resurrection there will be an equal number of Christians and Hebrews(the latter including only a few gentiles in their number, at least two [see thenote to Par. XXXI.25–27] and only possibly more), should have to recite theselines aloud before saying anything about the issue.

[part0019.html#c32-s14-e] Dante now draws another boundary line, thisone dividing the “north-south” axis of the Rose into two portions of equalheight (though of unequal volume). There are three classes of saved babies, allof whom, because they had not attained the age of reason, died only in theirinherited sinfulness (i.e., without positive sin): (1) Jewish infants whosomehow shared their parents’ faith in Christ to come; (2) Jewish infants whoseparents, once circumcision was instituted as a ritual by the Jews, had themcircumcised (see the note to vv. 76–81); (3) Christian infants who had thebetter form of “circumcision,” baptism. In real terms, then, the rules forChristian infants were more stringent. [return to English[part0019.html#c32-s14-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c32-s14-i]]43.

[part0019.html#c32-s16-e] Dante obviously enjoyed rewarding himself forhis strict interpretation of the law of baptism in Inferno IV.30, when he agreedwith St. Thomas that all unbaptized children will be found in Limbo. Now he seesa multitude of saved infants, and he dwells much longer on them.See the note to Paradiso XXXI.59 for discussion of the presence of these babesnot as the adults they should become (according to the standard view), but asthe babies they were, back in their sweet flesh. See Nardi (Nard.1944.1), pp.317–34, for the “age” of the babes in Heaven and other problems associated withtheir presence here.

[part0019.html#c32-s17-e] Dante now chooses to deal, at some length,with a knotty problem: Do these sinless and saved innocents appear in the Rosein any meaningful pattern, as do the adults? This matter is set forth andresolved in three parts (vv. 49–60, 61–66, and 67–84). [return to English[part0019.html#c32-s17-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c32-s17-i]]49–60. [part0019.html#c32-s17-e] Part I: Bernard has divined that Dante,observing that these infants seem to be ranked in some sort of preferentialorder, immediately counters that (true) perception with the perfectly sensiblenotion that they only seem to be ordered by their varying merit, but are in factmerely casually arranged (for how can one distinguish one infant’s moralperfection from another’s?). In response, he treats his pupil as though he werea balky schoolboy (the reader may understandably feel surprise; we are, afterall, very near the final vision).

No, Bernard says, there is no possibility, in thisrealm, of what exists existing without a reason. Thus, if you see gradation,there is gradation, and there is a reason for it.

[part0019.html#c32-s21-e] Part II: The second stage of Bernard’sresponse to Dante’s unvoiced question is a clear answer: Nothing happenscasually here. The reason for His ordering the infants’ places as He does is inthe mind of God and it is futile to try to fathom His reasons; just accept them.(And it may be particularly difficult to accept the idea that God creates humansouls with unequal degrees of ability to know Him.)

[part0019.html#c32-s23-e] Part III: The third and final stage of hisresponse is to give examples of God’s other and similar behavior, which mighthave made it clear even to Dante that His preference for preference has alwaysbeen manifest in the varying degrees of his grace.

See Malachi 1:2–3: “Yet I have loved Jacobbut Esau I have hated.” And this while they were still in the womb.Distinguishing them was not what they have done (they have not done anything),but, as it may seem, the color of their hair (Esau; see Genesis 25:25). That isthe uncomprehending human view. God sees what we do not, and knows what we donot: the inner sight of our fellow beings. Esau’s red and Jacob’s black hairwere only the outward manifestations of their inner differences, their abilitiesto know and love God.

[part0019.html#c32-s26-e] Making clear what was latent in lines 40–48,Bernard now details the “history of grace” for babies, at first their parents’love for Christ to come, then circumcision, and finally (in the age of Christ)baptism.For the first two of these, see St. Thomas (ST III, q. 70, a. 4), cited byBosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 76–78): “Ante institutionem circumcisionis fidesChristi futuri iustificabat tam pueros quam adultos” (Before the institution ofcircumcision, faith in Christ to come justified both little children andadults). Bosco/Reggio go on to point out that Thomas (ST III, q. 70, a. 2) alsoholds that Original Sin is passed along through males alone (though it affectsall, since our race cannot rely on matrilineal parthenogenesis), which accountsfor the emphasis on male circumcision in the second tercet of this passage.However, the rules became more stringent once Christ came, with baptism nowmandatory for the salvation of the innocent.

[part0019.html#c32-s27-e] Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 79–81)understands that the “age of circumcision” began with Abraham. The author of theCodice Cassinese (comm. to this verse) was the first to understand the referencehere as being to the first two ages, from Adam to the Flood, from the Flood toAbraham, some 3,184 years according to him.

[part0019.html#c32-s30-e] And now, as a sort of coda to the foregoing“lecture,” the angels radiate their pleasure in her down from above to Mary.Gabriel, who had before (see Par. XXIII.94–96) descended to reenact theAnnunciation, does so once again, spreading his wings as the painters of thisscene always show him doing, and singing her song.

(For the program of song in the last cantica, see the note toPar. XXI.58–60.) If we recall the first parodic references to “hymns” (Inf.VII.125) or “songs” (Inf. XIX.118) or “psalms” (Inf. XXXI.69) to describeantimelodic utterance in Hell, we realize the care with which Dante organizedhis plan for the “musical score” of the Commedia, beginning in bono with thefirst singing heard in Purgatorio (II.46–48), the “theme song” of the entirework, Psalm 113, In Isräel de Aegypto.

[part0019.html#c32-s33-e] The word cantilena, a hapax, would seem to referspecifically to Gabriel’s song (although some think it is more general in itsreference). The singers would seem to include (although there is someuncertainty about this also) everyone on the scene, all the angels and all thesaints, and their response, according to Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 94–99), is bothspoken and sung: “cantantes et dicentes Dominus tecum etc.” (singing and saying“The Lord be with you,” etc.). Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 85–99) fills inthe “etc.” by reciting the full response: “Blessed are you among women, andblessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.”Cantilena (at least in Italian) seems to be a coinage of Dante’s. It happensthat the word is also a hapax in the Vulgate (as Aversano has noted[Aver.2000.2], p. 169), occurring in the following passage of Ecclesiasticus(47:13–18): “Solomon reigned in days of peace, and God gave him rest on everyside, that he might build a house for his name and prepare a sanctuary to standfor ever. / How wise you became in your youth! You overflowed like a river withunderstanding. / Your soul covered the earth, and you filled it with parablesand riddles. / Your name reached to far-off islands, and you were loved for yourpeace. / For your songs [cantilenis] and proverbs and parables, and for yourinterpretations, the countries marveled at you. / In the name of the Lord God,who is called the God of Israel, you gathered gold like tin and amassed silverlike lead.” Aversano reasonably enough believes that the word cantilenae herereflects the songs of Solomon gathered in the Cantica canticorum. Thus cantilenamay have a certain affinity with the last coinage for a God-derived song,tëodia, that we heard in Paradiso XXV.73, as Mattalia (comm. to verse 97)suggests.

[part0019.html#c32-s47-e] This verse has caused innumerable problems.Giacalone (comm. to vv. 139–144) compiles six differing attempts atinterpretation; there are probably more, but one must admit it is hard todistinguish shadings of meaning from substantial differences. Most can agreethat the verse refers to time and to sleep, but what exactly is time doing tothe protagonist and what sort of sleep is involved? Further, and pivotal, is adistinction about when the dreaming referred to occurred or is occurring or willoccur. The basic disagreements have, it is probably fair to say, their roots inthe temporal relation of Dante’s dreaming. Either Dante (1) has been “dreaming”from the beginning of this special experience, as might be indicated by InfernoI.11, where Dante admits he was full of sleep when he lost the true way, and/or(2) is “dreaming” now (in the sense that he is having a more than normalexperience of the afterworld), or (3) will be “out of time” (in both senses ofthe phrase) when he has the final vision of the Trinity, for which Bernard willseek Mary’s aid, in a few minutes. Barolini (Baro.1992.1), pp. 144–51, carrieson a long conversation with Barbi (Barb.1934.1), in which she unsuccessfullytries to undermine his objections to her position. Barolini wants to make theentire poem “visionary.” Barbi, on the other hand, wants to distinguish betweenthe “experiential” feel of most of the narrated journey and “vision” properlyspeaking. And the fact that there are “real” dreams presented in the poem (e.g.,in Purg. IX, XIX, and XXVII) certainly implies that the rest of the time Danteis having “normal” experience of the decidedly postnormal things he witnesses inthe afterworld. The crux of the issue found in this verse is to what precise (orfor that matter general) dreaming the text refers. More than one hundred yearsago, Torraca (comm. to vv. 139–141) read the verse as follows: “[P]erchè giàcessa il tuo essere nel tempo, finisco, per non ritardare la tua partecipazioneall’eternità, le tua visione suprema” (Because your presence in time already isceasing, I finish speaking, so as not to delay your participation in eternity,your supreme vision). For a recent paper, not very distant from Torraca’sfinding, see Cuzzilla (Cuzz.2003.1), whose views influenced our reading of theverse. What he suggests is that the “sleep” is the mystic vision, alreadyreferred to in the picture of John “dreaming” in Purgatorio XXIX (see the noteto vv. 127–129).For some other discussions, see Passerini (Pass.1918.1), ad loc.; Gilson(Gils.1924.1), pp. 62–63; Pernicone (Pern.1965.1), pp. 120–21. Gilson citesCanticle of Canticles 5:2, “Ego dormio et cor meum vigilat” (I sleep and myheart wakes), a passage that Bonaventure uses to indicate the state of ecstaticvision. And see Boyde (Boyd.1993.1), pp. 130–39, for a discussion of somnia(dreams). See also the note to Paradiso XXVII.79–81.

Advising his reader thathe should measure out his epistolary space with care, so that his thoughts willall fit onto the amount of paper reserved for them, Buoncompagno continues histhought with a simile: “sicut providus sartor pannum, de quo camisiam disposuitfacere vel gunnellam” (just as a tailor, having thought ahead, has prepared thecloth from which to make a shirt or else a skirt).

[part0019.html#c33-s01-e] This much (and justly) celebrated passage,Bernard’s prayer to the Virgin, has the authority and unity of a separate poem.This is not to suggest that it is in any way incongruous in its context (quitethe opposite is true), only that it could be published (as surely it has been)in an anthology of devotional lyrics and be one of the most moving andcommanding of the collection.For a study of this passage, see Auerbach (Auer.1949.1), who aligns it withexamples of classical and Christian praise. And for the large extent to whichDante has borrowed from Bernard’s own writings for the words of this prayer, seeAversano (Aver.2000.2), pp. 173–76.Gian Carlo Alessio, in a lecture he presented at Princeton University during theautumn semester of 1981, broke down the rhetorical divisions of Bernard’s prayeras follows:1–12: salutatio13–21: exordium22–27: narratio28–33: repetitio34–39: peroratioThe tone of intimacy found in this prayer is emphasized by its extraordinarynumber of second-person-singular pronouns (tu, te, ti) and adjectives (tuo,tua), 17 of them in 39 verses (and that figure does not includesecond-person-singular endings of verbs). See the note to Paradiso XXXI.79–90.[return to English [part0019.html#c33-s01-e] / Italian[part0031.html#c33-s01-i]]1. [part0019.html#c33-s01-e] This verse establishes the basic modality of theentire canto, making two references to what will be a common theme of so manyverses in it: harmonious resolution of impossibly related contraries. “Virgin”and “mother” cannot logically be the shared properties of any woman; nor can anywoman be the daughter of her son. This overriding of the logic of impossibilitywill culminate in the final simile of the poem, the geometer attempting tosquare the circle. The only answer to impossibility is miracle. Reacting to theentire canto, Güntert has said (Gunt.2002.2), p. 505, “No Christian poet hadever been so daring.”For the beginnings of the last cantos of the first two cantiche, see the note toPurgatorio XXXIII.1–3, which points out that each of the previous opening lineswas in another poetic voice, first that of Venantius Fortunatus and second thatof David, both of them speaking Latin. Here we have another poetic voice, thatof St. Bernard, but he does not use his customary Latin tongue (apparently nowriting of Bernard in French survives), but the vernacular. This opening linethus presents us first with a completed pattern and then, on furtherconsideration, with a broken pattern: We expect Latin here, but do not find it.For both elements of this verse as dependent on formulations found in the fifthbook of Alain de Lille’s Anticlaudianus, see Ledda (Ledd.2002.1), p. 308n.,citing the previous notice by Jacomuzzi (Jaco.1965.1), p. 12n. Ledda alsoreports other medieval formulae that are similar to Dante’s paradoxicalexpressions.This marks the thirteenth time that a canto has begun with a speaker’s words(see the note to Par. V.1).

[part0019.html#c33-s01-e] If one had to choose a single line of thefourteen thousand two hundred and thirty-three verses of the Commedia to standfor its stylistic program, countering classical high style with Christian sermohumilis, this one might serve that purpose. It begins and ends with the humanityof Mary, humble and a mere human creature, who is, at the same time, lofty(alta), as is the poem itself.

[part0019.html#c33-s01-e] See Carroll’s explanation of this line (comm. tovv. 1–39): “The woman worthy to be the ‘Mother of God’ must have been elect fromthe beginning.” [return to English [part0019.html#c33-s01-e] / Italian[part0031.html#c33-s01-i]]4–6. [part0019.html#c33-s02-e] This tercet, remarkable for its triple play onthe “making” of flesh (fattore, farsi, fattura), rises to the heights with thehapax (and coinage?) nobilitasti (ennobled). What is the noblest act ever done?God’s making himself mortal for our sake (cf. Par. VII.118–120). [return toEnglish [part0019.html#c33-s02-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c33-s02-i]]7. [part0019.html#c33-s03-e] Dante’s use of the word ventre (here and onceearlier for Mary’s womb at Par. XXIII.104) was perhaps not intended to becontroversial. See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 1–21), pointing out that Dante mayhave deliberately been echoing “et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Jesus”(blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus [originally found in Luke 1:42]). Thisis the end of the first part of the prayer: “Hail, Mary, full of grace, /blessed are you among women.” Nonetheless, and as we have observed (see thenotes to Par. XXI.84 and XXIII.104), some of Dante’s readers find this alowering of diction unbefitting such a lofty subject.In a related and similar vein, see McLaughlin (Mcla.1995.1), pp. 20–21,remarking that “After Petrarch reasserts the absolute superiority of Latin overthe volgare, Dante’s vernacular echoes of classical auctores are regarded as adiminution of their status.”On the word amore, see Sacchetto (Sacc.1974.1), for whom love is the key to thepoem, occurring 19 times in Inferno, 50 in Purgatorio, and 85 in Paradiso.[return to English [part0019.html#c33-s03-e] / Italian[part0031.html#c33-s03-i]]8–9.

[part0019.html#c33-s04-e] For the saved, there is no more need forhope—their hope (as well as their faith) has been rewarded, and now they onlylove eternally. Meanwhile, while to those (few, we need to recall, lest we getcarried away by the warmth of these verses) left on earth who will be saved,Mary offers the surest path of hope for their salvation.

[part0019.html#c33-s05-e] Campi (comm. to vv. 13–15) cites MonsignorCavedoni for the attribution of this image to St. Bernard, Sermones in VigiliaNativitatis Domini III.10: “Nihil nos Deus habere voluit, quod per Mariae manusnon transiret” (God does not wish us to have anything that has not first passedthrough the hands of Mary). [return to English [part0019.html#c33-s05-e] /Italian [part0031.html#c33-s05-i]]15. [part0019.html#c33-s05-e] Geoffrey Chaucer, who knew and understood thispoem better than any English writer for many centuries, appropriated this linein his Troilus with hilarious result. Stanza 182 of Book III (one stanza fromthe numerical midpoint of the work, 588 of 1178 stanzas) has Troilus in themidst of his three-stanza prayer to Venus (his “Mary”). Whoever wants toaccomplish his love (he is thinking about carnal pleasure), he says, withoutVenus’s help, “his desire will fly without wings,” that is, will not besuccessful. It is Paradiso XXXIII done as Some Like It Hot, one of BillyWilder’s greatest films. (That Chaucer could do Dante “straight” is witnessed inmany of his texts; in the context of this canto, see particularly his rewritingof the first half of Bernard’s prayer in “The Second Nun’s Prologue” of TheCanterbury Tales, vv. 29–77.)As Simone Marchesi, in conversation, has pointed out, Chaucer’s Billy Wilder wasGiovanni Boccaccio, whose lascivious Venetian friar Albert (Decam. IV.ii), inillicit pleasure with a Venetian matron, “flew many times without his wings.”Albert appears to the credulous woman as the angel Gabriel, decked out in acostume including wings that he takes off only in the darkness of her bedroom.Boccaccio is clearly pulling Dante’s leg; now Chaucer does so also.

[part0019.html#c33-s07-e] Here we have a case of a Virgilian borrowingthat has apparently remained hidden for centuries (in both texts, CAPITALS markstructural parallels and italics indicate secondary repeated sounds of te): In TE misericordia, in TE pietate, in TE magnificenza, in TE s’aduna …See Georgics IV.465–466 (Orpheus lamenting his dead Eurydice, a scene Dante hasrevisited in Purg. XXX.49–51 [see the note to that passage] as parallel to hisplaint for lost Virgil, as is fairly widely agreed these days): TE, dulcis coniunx, TE solo in litore secum, TE veniente die, TE decedente canebat. [thee, sweet wife, thee, alone on the lone shore, thee while day dawned, thee while it died, he sang.]This seems an obvious revisitation. Perhaps we have not seen it because thesituations are so opposed. But that is the point: Bernard is a better Orpheussinging a better Eurydice, Maria. It is a small but telling emblem of how Danterewrites Virgilian tragedy as Christian comedy. And the Virgilian context isstriking: We last heard the notes of Georgics IV in tragic mode for hisdisappearance as a character from the poem; now that poem becomes the subtextfor a better moment, his own reentry to this Christian comedy at its highestpoint.Notice of this echo is fairly recent. See Hollander (Holl.1993.1), p. 339,citing a communication from Professor Rachel Jacoff in 1987, suggesting theexistence of this borrowing, which also possibly reflects Paradiso XXIII.88–89,where Dante presents himself as praying to Mary each morning and evening, whileOrpheus presents himself as “singing” Eurydice morning and evening. The starkcontrast between Virgilian “Orphic” love that leads to death and Marianaffection that leads to eternal life could not be more striking.We may remember that the first (and only) time we heard Dante’s name in thispoem (Purg. XXX.55), it was echoing a passage just a little farther along inthis Georgic (see the note to Purg. XXX.63). [return to English[part0019.html#c33-s07-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c33-s07-i]]22–23. [part0019.html#c33-s08-e] Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) rightlyexpress surprise that there is any debate at all over exactly which of the soulsin which parts of the afterworld Bernard refers to, since he obviously refers toall of them.

[part0019.html#c33-s10-e] The meaning of these verses is clear enough,but the discussion of them is uncertain with regard to a possible source. Whileseveral commentators hear a plausible echo of Aeneid II.604–606 (first Gabriele[comm. to vv. 31–32]) in these verses, and a few others hear one of Boethius(Cons. III.m9.25–28) and not of Virgil (first Vellutello [comm. to vv. 28–33]),neither text is really close enough to be a convincingly heard citation, if theVirgilian one has the largest following and the more likely context. If webelieve that the Virgilian passage is being alluded to, the parallels are fairlyinviting. Where Venus removes the shield of invisibility from the gods so thatAeneas may see his true enemies for what they are, Mary takes the cloud of hismortality away from Dante so that he may see his “friend,” God, as He is.[return to English [part0019.html#c33-s10-e] / Italian[part0031.html#c33-s10-i]]29–39.

[part0019.html#c33-s11-e] Once again the precise understanding one shouldhave of the verbal noun piacer is an issue. See the note to PurgatorioXXXI.47–54. Grabher (comm. to vv. 28–33) believes that here it means sommabellezza (highest beauty), as do we. [return to English[part0019.html#c33-s11-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c33-s11-i]]34–39. [part0019.html#c33-s12-e] See Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 1–21), whoobserve that this final prayer offered by Bernard may reflect the second andfinal part of the Ave Maria: “Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, / ora pro nobispeccatoribus, nunc, / et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen” (Holy Mary, Mother ofGod, / pray for us sinners now / and at the hour of our death. Amen).The traditional interpretation of these lines, as it is advanced by Sapegno(comm. to these verses); Chiavacci Leonardi (comm. vv. 34.36); and Dronke(Dron.1994.1), p. 28, fits well with the Marian text. It sees the final momentsof the prayer as turning to Dante’s Nachleben back on earth, and hoping thatMary will intervene to help him remain pure, so that he will indeed be able toreturn here. This understanding is opposed by Pertile (Pert.1981.1); BàrberiSquarotti (Barb.1995.1), pp. 367–71; and Ledda (Ledd.2002.1), pp. 309–10, all ofwhom find it inappropriate for Bernard’s prayer to leave the subject of Dante’svision being pure for that of his post-Paradiso life back on earth being morallysound. Why is this an unseemly concern, either aesthetically or intellectually?It had already been before the reader in Paradiso XXXI.88–90, where Dantehimself beseeches Beatrice for this kind of heavenly assistance. Pertile (p. 2)argues that, for the very reason that Dante’s prayer has been accepted, assignified by Beatrice’s smile, there is no longer any need to linger on thisissue. Perhaps so. On the other hand, the language of these six verses(particularly at vv. 36 and 37) really does seem to be related to earthlyconcerns. In other words, even if it seems ungainly to some (but not to most),the standard interpretation seems more plausible.

[part0019.html#c33-s14-e] The Virgin, evidently made of more auguststuff than Beatrice, does not smile when Bernard finishes his prayer as Beatricedid when Dante finished his (Par. XXXI.92), but indicates by the expression inher eyes how much she is gratified by the prayers of the devout. Then she turnsher gaze (as did Beatrice) back up to God.

[part0019.html#c33-s16-e] As Güntert observes (Gunt.2002.2), p. 511, afterthe formal conclusion to Bernard’s prayer (vv. 40–45), this verse begins thefinal “macrosequence” of the one-hundredth canto; it is precisely one hundredverses in length.

We follow Singleton’s interpretation(comm. to this verse): “The meaning of the verb in this verse is much debated,but one aspect of that meaning seems beyond discussion: finii cannot here be ina normal signification of ‘bring to an end.’ Indeed, the context requires thatthe meaning be the exact opposite, i.e., ‘I brought the ardor of my desire toits highest intensity.’ ” And see the similar position of Bosco/Reggio (comm. tothis verse). Another difficult passage may be considered a “preview” of this one(Purg. XVIII.31–33) and may help unscramble the sense of this line. See the noteto that passage (Purg. XVIII.28–33).

[part0019.html#c33-s17-e] As Aversano (Aver.2000.2), p. 177, points out,this is the third and last appearance of Bernard’s name in the poem (see alsoPar. XXXI.102 and 139), as a sort of Trinitarian gesture of farewell. [return toEnglish [part0019.html#c33-s17-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c33-s17-i]]50–51. [part0019.html#c33-s17-e] Bernard was signaling, in his capacity asguide, what Dante should be doing, but Dante was already doing exactly that.

[part0019.html#c33-s18-e] The poet could not be more precise. Up to nowhis powers of sight have improved so that he can finally see God’s reflection inthe universe perfectly, an ability that was far from his grasp when the poembegan. Now he will see Him as Himself. Thus the protagonist’s vision is about tomove from reflections of His glory up into the beam of light emanating from Him.It is balanced for seconds between the two aspects of deity, reflection andsource (see the note to Par.

[part0019.html#c33-s19-e] The experience of seeing God face-to-face (1)is ineffable, not describable, and (2) the vision cannot be remembered in any ofits details anyway (these twin disclaimers were made at the outset [see Par.I.7–9]).

[part0019.html#c33-s20-e] Given our previous experience reading in theParadiso, we expect here exactly what we get. Moving into an area of heightenedexperience, which challenges his expressive powers (as it had challenged hisperceptive powers), Dante has inevitably moved to simile. After, in the lasttercet, understating the fact that he saw God, he now turns not to one simile,but to three of them, in order to express the nature of his loss. This isperhaps the only time in the poem that he deploys three similes back-to-back; inany case, the Trinitarian nature of what he has looked upon (which will be madeclear to us before long) is perhaps reflected in their number.These are the penultimate similes in a poem that turns to them more often thanwe might have expected, and surely his use of the technique reflects his senseof the classical Latin epic simile, so familiar to him, particularly from thepages of Virgil. And the last of these three will be unmistakably Virgilian.[return to English [part0019.html#c33-s20-e] / Italian[part0031.html#c33-s20-i]]58–63. [part0019.html#c33-s20-e] The first and fullest of the three similes isone of a class defined by Tozer (see the note to Inf.

[part0019.html#c33-s20-e] The present tense of the verb in the simileseems natural to us, since Dante usually bases his similes in the world of ourpresent experience. We do not, however, expect to hear the narrative voicespeaking in the present tense—but if we look ahead to verse 61, we find the poetspeaking to us now, from his writing table back on earth. He won’t stay there(see vv. 133–138, a parallel structure, in which the poet compares himself tothe geometer and then says “such was I”), as we will see, but that is where hepresents himself as being now, at least for the moment.

[part0019.html#c33-s21-e] Switching from the experience itself to writingabout his recording of the experience, the poet speaks in the present tense,which comes as a surprise, since we have not heard him use that tense in theEmpyrean, and not since Paradiso XXX.34.

[part0019.html#c33-s21-e] This is the sixth and final appearance of theword visione, used here for the first time for the poem itself.

[part0019.html#c33-s22-e] Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 64–66) says that this isa fitting simile, because “the human mind, weak and infirm, loses the form ofits phantasy’s vision beneath the heat of the Eternal Sun.” This secondcomparison is apparently not “literary” in its inspiration. There is in fact nocitation of any text of any kind for this verse among the commentators gatheredin the DDP. [return to English [part0019.html#c33-s22-e] / Italian[part0031.html#c33-s22-i]]65–66. [part0019.html#c33-s22-e] When we read her name, we may wonder why wehave not heard it before now; it is as though Dante were holding her in reservefor his hundredth canto (as we will see, that number is three times associatedwith her in the main passage involving her in the Aeneid). The Sibyl, we maysometimes fail to remember, was merely the conduit for Apollo’s messages. Thus,and as Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 64–66) says, both the Sibyl and Dante lost trackof a communication from a divinity. If we recall the first two cantos of thiscanticle, with their insistence on Apollo as God’s “stand-in” (Par. I.13; II.8),we can see why Benvenuto makes them companions in losing track of the truthrevealed by “Apollo.”The history of the commentators’ response to this Virgilian reference isstrange, beginning with the mistake of Francesco da Buti (or his scribe), whoidentifies (comm. to vv. 55–66) the source as being in Aeneid V, when he clearlymeans Aeneid III. All the other earlier commentators, beginning with Pietro(Pietro1, comm. to vv. 58–66), and including Benvenuto, John of Serravalle,Daniello, and Venturi, refer only to the appropriate passage in Aeneid VI.However, beginning with Lombardi (comm. to vv. 64–66), every commentator but tworefers only to the passage in Aeneid III (443–451), which is the one in whichthe usual scattering of her leaves is described; the second passage, while alsoreferring to that usual result, has Aeneas convincing the oracle to speak, andnot write, her expression of Apollo’s response. However, it is probably helpfulto have both scenes in mind; the only two commentators in the DDP to refer toboth passages are Oelsner and Singleton (comms. to these verses).The passage in the Aeneid (VI.42–155) describing the Sibyl’s cave is both longand full of arresting “Dantean” detail. The cave possesses one hundred mouthsand one hundred gates (VI.43); Aeneas requests that the Sibyl not write her“poems” (carmina) on leaves to be scattered by the wind, but recite them aloud(VI.74–75); the hundred gates open and their breezes carry her reply (VI.81–82);Virgil (VI.99) typifies her utterance as “horrible enigmas” (horrendas ambages),a phrase that Dante has picked up in Paradiso XVII.31; Aeneas asks (VI.108) theSibyl to bring him into his father’s sight (ad conspectum cari genitoris), whileDante hopes to see his Father. (While there are other resonances in Dante’s poemof the last four dozen verses, they are not relevant to this passage.)If the obvious references to Virgil have been recognized, but not all that wellexploited, there is also possibly a reference to Augustine, which has onlyrarely been noticed and not exploited at all. It is found in chapter xxiii ofBook XVIII of De civitate Dei, a text vengefully hostile to Virgil for hisprideful view of Rome’s continuing and sempiternal hegemony (especially now thatthe city has been sacked in the year 410). Augustine says that the Sibyl (notthe Cumaean [Virgil’s] but the Erythraean—if he later hedges by saying it mayhave been the Cumaean) had, in a poem, prophesied the coming of Christ and oughtto be considered as inhabiting the City of God. What led Augustine to make suchclaims may have been a desire to roast Virgil, either for not heeding his ownSibyl (who, after all, presides over the fourth Eclogue) or for choosing tosponsor the wrong one. Here is a portion of what he sets down in his lengthyanalysis of this poem: The first letters of each successive line in the GreekSibylline pronouncement spell out, Augustine reports: “ ‘Jesus Christ the Son ofGod, the Saviour.’ And the verses are twenty-seven, which is the cube of three.For three times three are nine; and nine itself, if tripled, so as to rise fromthe superficial square to the cube, comes to twenty-seven. But if you join theinitial letters of these five Greek words, … they will make the word ikduj, thatis, ‘fish,’ in which word Christ is mystically understood, because He was ableto live, that is, to exist, without sin in the abyss of this mortality as in thedepth of waters” (tr. M. Dods). Notice of this passage in St. Augustine is not afrequent feature of the commentaries. However, see Benvenuto (comm. to theseverses), who points to it at some length. He is followed apparently only byCampi (comm. to these verses). Hollander (Holl.1983.1), pp. 146–50, whilesuggesting this connection, neglected his two precursors (when he could haveused all the help he could find).For an article by Philippe Verdier on the Sibyl’s appearance to Augustine at Aracoeli in Rome, see Mélanges de l’École française à Rome 94 (1982): 85–119. Andfor a collection of studies of the Sibyl’s antique and medieval presence, seeAllevi (Alle.1965.1) as well as Bouquet and Morzadec (Bouq.2004.1). Allevidiscusses this passage on pp. 443–48.

[part0019.html#c33-s23-e] The word concetto (conception, conceiving) isthe linchpin of this passage, occurring in verses 68 and 75 (on the latteroccasion as a verb). Dante, in this last of his nine invocations (see the noteto Inf. II.7–9), asks God to make His reality “conceivable” by mortals. If Herequites Dante’s request, the poet promises, that will be the result. Ascaled-back request, the poet insists, is all that he makes, underlined by therepetition of the phrase “un poco” (one small part).This is the fourth time in the poem that the word concetto is connected with aninvocation (see the notes to Inf. XXXII.1–9 and 10–12; Par. XVIII.82–87; and,for a survey of all the presences of concetto in the poem, see the note to Par.XXXIII.127). It surely seems to be involved in Dante’s sense of what the humanagent needs from a higher source, not the mere substance of his vision, but itsshaping conceptual formulation. And that is precisely what, the poet will tellus, he was granted in the lightning bolt that resolves all his questions inverses 140–141.

Having utteredhis ninth invocation a few lines earlier (vv. 67–75), he does not invoke theDeity. He does not need help to see Him any longer; he has accomplished thatgoal. And so he gives thanks for His grace in allowing this final vision, whichhe is about to unfold before us. See discussion in Ledda (Ledd.2002.1), pp.313–14 and n.

And Dante, seeing the universaldiversity as unity, experiences it as God saw it in creating it, as a simple yet“limitless and dimensionless reality” (Moevs, p. 78).

[part0019.html#c33-s29-e] On the various dimensions of this passage,from medieval book production, in which a writer took his individual quartos(quaderni) to have them conflated and sewn into a “book,” Ahern argues thatDante’s poem reflects the “book” of God’s created universe, even to itsTrinitarian structure.

[part0019.html#c33-s29-e] Chiarenza (Chia.1972.1), p. 80, says thatthis tercet is “inspired by the doctrine of the double existence of creation,separate in the universe and unified in its Creator’s conception.” [return toEnglish [part0019.html#c33-s29-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c33-s29-i]]91–93. [part0019.html#c33-s31-e] Güntert (Gunt.2002.2), p. 508, hopes toconvince us to see “three Dantes” in this tercet: the narrator (credo), thenarrator speaking of the protagonist in the past tense (i’ vidi), and the“post-vision protagonist” (mi sento … i’ godo), a being somehow differentiatedfrom the narrator in Güntert’s view (see the similar argument advanced by Picone[Pico.2000.3], pp. 18–21). However, it is difficult to understand how hisseparation of the first and third voices can be supported, since they both usethe present tense and surely seem to be the standard voice of the io narranterather than two different voices, speaking from different times. Since it is notlogically possible for one of those times to be post-writing, it must then fallbetween the vision and the writing, and thus in the past. To put this anotherway, had Dante had such a plan in mind, he needed to deploy a better-conceivedtactic in order to make it effective. As it is, we have two moments in the poem.One is stable, the protagonist’s voyage during a week in the spring of 1300, inwhich he does change over that time; that is then. The other is always in factshifting between circa 1307 and circa 1321, but is treated without temporaldistinction as the authorial now, if it has in fact finally reached its farthestpoint. The author who looks up at us from the pages of Inferno XXXII.71–72 totell us his discomfort in winter’s cold occupies the same moment as this one, asfar as we can see from his text, which offers no temporal divisions of thewriterly present except for the ones we may happen to supply. Proust would laterchoose to dramatize the subject of the author’s mortal change through time; alltimes in which Dante, on the other hand, looks up at us from his writing tableare equally “now.” All that has changed is that he is finishing his book; inHollander’s formulation (Holl.1969.1, p. 227), “The Pilgrim he was has becomethe history of the Poet he is.”For the similarities between Dante’s “deification” here and that of Glaucus inParadiso I.67–79, see Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 228–29. See also Longen(Long.1975.1) and Migliorini-Fissi (Migl.1982.1).For the suggestion that this image of a ship, filled with armed men and headedfor battle, underlines the poet’s desire to associate his Christian poem withclassical martial epic in this final reference to the world of men, seeHollander (Holl.1989.1), p. 85.

[part0019.html#c33-s32-e] This tercet has called forth equal amounts ofadmiration and distress, admiration for the beauty and scope of its conception,distress at the indubious difficulty of its highly compacted literal sense.First things first. What does the tercet mean? Perhaps because of the difficultyof understanding why Dante might have wanted to present himself as forgettingthe greatest insight he (or practically anyone) has ever had, there has beensome attempt to understand letargo not as “forgetting,” but as a form ofvisionary experience. However, most now think that the former meaning is farmore likely here, as, obviously, do we. If all can agree (and that is to assumea good deal) that the term, in Dante’s Italian, refers to oblivion, forgetting,that still leaves a deal of difficulty.A good place to begin one’s study of this tercet is with the extensive gloss ofScartazzini, not because he solves its mysteries (he almost certainly does not),but because he so thoroughly indicates what these are. Francesco da Buti’sdiscussion of this tercet (a part of his comm. to vv. 82–99) makes a point basedin mythographic history that stands as a helpful understanding even today. He(uniquely) offers a striking version of the classical background: Neptune hadlonged to see his “kingdom,” the sea, “inhabited” as was the land. Therefore, hetook great joy in seeing the first ship ever to bring men to his “territory,”the sea, and has been painfully “forgetting” it (in the sense that he longs tosee it without satisfaction every day) for twenty-five hundred years ever since.And thus Dante can say that his one moment of awareness of the final mystery ofthe Trinity, how humanity and divinity share the same being, now being lost, ismore painful than Neptune’s far longer period of experiencing oblivion. SeeTozer’s similar paraphrase (comm. to this tercet): “ ‘[O]ne single moment isgreater oblivion to me (letargo, lit. lethargy, dullness), than twenty-fivecenturies have been to the enterprise which caused Neptune to marvel at theshadow of Argo.’ In other words: ‘I forgot in a single moment more of what Isaw … than men have forgotten, in twenty-five centuries, of the Argonauticexpedition.’ ” Needless to say, there are other views. For instance, Chimenz(comm. to this tercet) believes that the twenty-five centuries are marked byremembrance, not by forgetting. However, others have noted that the structure ofthe passage simply forces the reader to accept the negative understanding (i.e.,the view advanced by Tozer). And if the poet goes on to describe the vision ingreat detail (the main point put forward by those who read the text“positively”), he also will insist on its fleetingness, as Carroll (comm. tothis tercet), objecting to Scartazzini’s “positive” interpretation, rightlyargues. Lombardi had offered, in addition to the classical modern statementlater found in Tozer, two important additions to the sum of commentaryknowledge: The word letargo derives from Greek lethe (forgetfulness), and theyears between the voyage of the Argo and 1300 are, according to Dante’sauthorities, either 2,523 or 2,570. Tommaseo (comm. to this tercet) supports thefirst of these dates, which has now become “canonical” among the commentators.Either one is a promising date, since both sector the “history of sea voyages”in an arc of twenty-six centuries, 1223 (or 1270) b.c. to 1300, with itsapproximate midpoint in the Incarnation (as Hollander [Holl.1969.1], pp. 231–32,has argued). The voyage of the Argonauts, preceding the Trojan War, was thefirst important event in the Greek portion of universal history. (See Gmelin[Gmel.1957.1], p. 572, for an examination of Dante’s Argonautical chronology.)[return to English [part0019.html#c33-s32-e] / Italian[part0031.html#c33-s32-i]]94.

[part0019.html#c33-s32-e] The word impresa (undertaking, enterprise) hasan interesting history in the poem. See Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 230–31,pointing out that, in Inferno II.41 and 47, the word refers to Dante’s journeyand that, in Inferno XXXII.7, it represents Dante’s poem about that journey;here, on the other hand, it would seem to refer both to the journey and to therecord of that journey, for the first is in process of becoming the second.[return to English [part0019.html#c33-s32-e] / Italian[part0031.html#c33-s32-i]]96. [part0019.html#c33-s32-e] According to Ovid, Jason was the builder of thefirst ship (“primaeque ratis molitor” [Metam. VIII.302]). For the history of theArgo-motif, see Curtius (Curt.1950.1), favoring Ovid (Metam. VII.120), whichassuredly lies behind Dante’s earlier reference to Jason’s voyage (see the noteto Par. II.17–18), but does not seem quite so good a fit here.The image of Neptune looking up from beneath the sea is reminiscent of what thepoet tells us in Canto XXXI.73–78, where he looked up at Beatrice as though hewere immersed in the deepest point in the sea and she were at the highest pointin the earth’s atmosphere. Both sightings involve the word effige (features),the first time as Beatrice’s likeness, the second (Par. XXXIII.131), that ofJesus. The fact that Neptune saw the shadow (ombra) of the Argo makes it atleast probable that the poet hoped we would consider that voyage as theprefiguration of his own (see Hollander [Holl.1969.1], p. 232).And as for Ovidian inspiration for what is sometimes considered a Danteaninvention, Hollander (Holl.1969.1), p. 222, has argued for the impact of thelast line (721) of Ovid’s Book VI, describing the Argo setting sail from Iolcos:“Per mare non notum prima petiere carina” (The first keel to cleave an unknownsea). That would leave Neptune alone unaccounted for. To be sure, we find himlooking up from the seabed (wherever Dante found the source of the image)earlier in this very poem, Inferno XXVIII.83–84, where, in his only otherappearance, he witnesses Malatestino’s treachery as he has witnessed similarcrimes on the part of Greeks (gente argolica), the “bad Argonauts” succeedingJason, as it were.

From thecircle of the Father appeared reflected the circle of the Son, as Iris [rainbow]from Iris [rainbow]; and from both was breathed forth equally the fire of Lovewhich is the Holy Spirit (on the Procession of the Spirit from both Father andSon, and the filioque controversy, see above [Carroll’s comm.], on Par.

Torraca seems to have been the first commentator(and, among those gathered in the DDP, he seems to have been followed only byMestica [comm. to this tercet]) even to note that we have seen this term beforein Inferno I.63, but has no further comment. Hollander suggests that “this useof the word is intended to make us consider Virgil’s initial fiochezza, with allits metaphoric insistence on the fact that he had failed to speak the Word. Inthis respect, the two poets find themselves once again together at the end,reunited in their failures, and yet so very far from one another, separated bythe ground of their failures” (p. 151).Bellomo (Bell.1996.1), p. 55n., believes that the question of Dante’s Virgilneeds to be reopened, beginning with a rereading of Bruno Nardi (Nard.1960.1),especially pp. 96–150.

[part0019.html#c33-s42-e] Ledda (Ledd.2002.1), p. 317n., says he isfollowing Jacomuzzi in seeing that the protagonist’s final vision is of theIncarnation, and not the Trinity. Does one really have to make that choice? Itwould seem to be preferable to see it as Trinitarian, which includes the visionof Jesus as spirit in flesh, as He is. [return to English[part0019.html#c33-s42-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c33-s42-i]]127–132. [part0019.html#c33-s43-e] Finally, Dante sees the Humanity of theTrinity, the Son, Jesus Christ, incarnate within the circle that abstractlyrepresents the Second Person. Once again the differing colors of the Persons areinsisted on, and once again (see the note to vv. 118–120) Dante does not reportthe color of the Son (nor of the Father).It took centuries until a commentator (Scartazzini [comm. to verse 131])realized that this image contained a reference to St. Paul (Philippians 2:7),“but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in thelikeness of men.” This is currently a fairly widespread perception, but the onlyother writer in the DDP to observe it is Grandgent (comm. to verse 131).The enormous presence of the Bible in the poem has at times simply overwhelmedits observers. This is a case in point. Moore (Moor.1896.1), pp. 321–34, listsover six hundred possible citations in all Dante’s works, the bulk of them inthe Commedia. Thus one needs to deal cautiously with Steiner’s accountancy(Stei.2001.1), p. 89, which counts the actual citations (rather than moregeneral forms of reference) as two in Inferno, eight in Purgatorio, and a dozenin Paradiso.

[part0019.html#c33-s43-e] This is the final use of this word, whether asan abstract noun meaning “concept” or “conceiving” or a transitive verb (toconceive [an idea—see Inf. XII.13 for the first and only use of the verb to mean“to conceive offspring,” although there is more than an overtone of that sensehere]). There have been twelve previous uses of the noun or of the verb (Inf.XXVI.73, XXXII.4; Par. III.60, XV.41, XVIII.86, XIX.12, XXII.33, XXIV.60,XXIX.81 and 132, XXXIII.68 and 122), which has more uses in this canto than inany other (three). See the note to Paradiso XV.40–42.

[part0019.html#c33-s44-e] For notice of a possible reflection here of thefourth and final stage of loving God in St. Bernard’s De diligendo Deo, seeHollander (Holl.1976.2), p. 35 (repr. Holl.1980.2): “Commentators have for along time annotated this passage with a reference to Philippians 2:7” (as wehave seen [note to vv. 127–132], that is barely true; only two of them in thelast 150 years). Hollander goes on to show that Bernard, in De diligendo Deo(Sancti Bernardi Opera, ed. J. Leclercq and H. M. Rochais, Vol. III [Rome:Editiones Cistercienses, 1963], p. 142), resorts to the same Pauline passage ina highly similar context, describing the height of the mystical love of God,when one loves oneself in God. For Bernard’s four stages in the love of God andtheir possible relation to the stages in the Comedy (first suggested by astudent at Princeton, Donald J. Mathison, in 1968), see the note to PurgatorioXXVII.139–141. For later discussions that are in agreement, see Mazzoni(Mazz.1997.1), p. 176, as well as Moevs (Moev.2005.1), p. 81. And see E.

[part0019.html#c33-s46-e] See Kay (Kay.2002.1), pp. 30–31, for thenotion, advanced as a follow-up to his examination of the Vitruvian nature ofDante’s calculations of the dimensions of both the giants (Inf. XXX) and ofSatan (Inf. XXXIV), that what Dante sees is Vitruvius’s image of man inscribedin a circle, his umbelicus at the center of the circle, his fingers and toes atthe circumference, in what is the eventual model for Leonardo da Vinci’s farmore famous design. As charming as this notion is, the word effige in Dante(Par. XXXI.77, XXXIII.131) seems rather to indicate, as is generally the case inItalian, the visage, not the whole human body.

[part0019.html#c33-s46-e] Jacomuzzi (Jaco.1965.1) offers a reading ofthese verses and of the poem as a whole in the mode of a theologicallydetermined fourfold allegoresis. For discussion, with some bibliography, ofItalian and American treatments of theological allegory in the poem, seeHollander (Holl. 2001.1), pp. 37–39 and p. 188, nn. 55–57. [return to English[part0019.html#c33-s46-e] / Italian [part0031.html#c33-s46-i]]139–141. [part0019.html#c33-s47-e] For insistence on the role played, in thisfinal vision, of both the Benjamin major of Richard of St. Victor and theItinerarium mentis in Deum of Bonaventure, see Gilson (Gils.1924.1), pp. 56–57.Gilson (pp. 62–63) concludes that, given these two sources, Dante’s vision isnot a Pauline raptus (a function of the intellect), but a Franciscan exstasis (afunction of the affective capacity). This, however, and despite Gilson’sauthority, is not the general current opinion, which rather insists that Dantedid have a Pauline raptus (as the entire cantica has been preparing us togrant). For instance, Güntert (Gunt.2002.2), p. 507, cites Aquinas (ST II–II, q.175, a. 3), distinguishing among three kinds of vision (but for an earlier andsimilar treatment see Pertile [Pert.1981.1], pp. 6–7). After discussions thatare in strong agreement with positions taken on the issues by Augustine, Thomasexplains, in his Reply to Objection 1: “Man’s mind is rapt by God to thecontemplation of divine truth in three ways. First, so that he contemplates itthrough certain imaginary pictures (per similitudines quasdam imaginarias), andsuch was the ecstasy that came upon Peter [Acts 10:10–16]. Secondly, so that hecontemplates the divine truth through its intelligible effects (perintelligibiles effectus); such was the ecstasy of David, who said (Psalm 115[116]:11): ‘I said in my excess: Every man is a liar.’ Thirdly, so that hecontemplates it in its essence (in sua essentia). Such was the rapture of Paul,as also of Moses; and not without reason, since as Moses was the first Teacherof the Jews, so was Paul the first ‘Teacher of the gentiles’ ” (tr. from thewebsite of the Catholic Encyclopedia). It is typical of Gilson, a Dominicanhimself, to downplay the importance of Dominicans in favor of Franciscans. Hisgraciousness is a model to us all. However, it may be that he is simplyincorrect here. The reader will note that here, even at the conclusion of thegreat poem, commentators are divided among Franciscan and Dominican positions onthe issues. For the difficult history of the intertwined strands of knowledgeand love in St. Thomas, in whom, at least apparently, such distinctions would beclearer than they are in Dante, see Sherwin (Sher.2005.1). In Dante, we find atmoments, like this one, knowledge eclipsing the claims of love; at others, thatdynamic would seem to be reversed. One comes away with the feeling that Danteresponds fully to the main competing voices in this continuing dialectic,“Franciscans” (Francis himself, Bonaventure, Bernard, and perhaps Joachim aswell), who privilege love (but not against knowledge), and “Dominicans” (Thomasprimissimus inter impares, but Albertus Magnus and Remigius Girolamus as well),who privilege knowledge (but not against love). For an article that stronglysupports the notion that Dante was closely aware of the text of Ezechiel, seeBognini (Bogn.2007.1).

[part0019.html#c33-s48-e] The final four lines are divided into twoparts, the first referring to an apparent failure (“Here my exalted vision lostits power”), in which the protagonist/poet, so recently rewarded with thecomprehension of Everything (verse 141), loses that vision, which is blotted outby his reemergent humanity. And then the poem’s final sentence, begun with anadversative, ma (but), tells a quite different story: The protagonist’s interiormotions, that of his affective power (the will) and that of his intellectivepower (his transmuted desire), both move in harmony with God’s cosmos.

[part0019.html#c33-s48-e] Pertile (Pert.2005.2), pp. 265–81 (a reprintingof an article published in 1995) and pp. 133–35, reopens the question of themeaning of this final image. The vast majority of readers have believed thatDante has a single wheel in mind (none more exigently and at greater length thanNardi [Nard.1944.1], pp. 337–50), all places on which move with uniformregularity. Pertile revives the view of those few twentieth-century readers whosaw the tautological vacuity of this as a final image and, revisiting Ezechiel(1:19–21 and 10:16) and Boethius (Cons. II.m8.28–30), revives a better idea:Dante has two wheels in mind. Aversano (Aver.1984.2), pp. 203–6, also finds thesource in Ezechiel (1:15–21), but in order to make a different point. But seeFreccero (Frec.1986.1, pp. 246–50 of an essay entitled “The Final Image,” firstpublished in 1964) for whom there is but one wheel, despite the fact that hethinks it reflects Ezechiel’s wheel within a wheel, which would seem to indicatetwo wheels.For a new wrinkle, see Rizzardi (Rizz.2000.1), who makes a case for Dante’shaving an image in mind that would become a staple in later ages: the universeas the movements in a mechanical clock. She bolsters her argument by pointingback to previous clock imagery (at Purg. VIII.85–87; Par. X.139–146 and Par.XXIV.13–18).Whatever the metaphor controlling this passage, whether biblical or astronomicalor mechanical, the simplest solution of the literal sense of the line is tounderstand that line 144, “as a wheel that is moved in just the same way,” isattached to the preceding (Latin) noun, velle. What the text then says is clear:“But already my desire was moving in a circle (around God), as was my will,revolving in just the same way.” This was precisely the understanding putforward by Torraca (comm. to vv. 143–145) over one hundred years ago that BrunoNardi belittled (Nard.1944.1), p. 349n. The protagonist/poet’s soul has left oursolar system behind and is moving in a circle, not around our earth, but, likethe angelic orders, around God. See Pertile’s concluding remarks on the lastparadox in the poem: The pilgrim has found his peace in continual movement. Itis not an accident that Goethe admired this final scene and used it indeveloping the conclusion of the second part of Faust.

[part0019.html#c33-s48-e] While the fact that the word stelle is the lastword of each canticle would seem to have been an early and lasting perception,John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 133–145) appears to have been the first ever tohave had it.For the possibility that Dante’s stella reflects Ovid’s astra (Metam. XV.876)and his starry vision of his own personal immortality that concludes his greatpoem (vv. 871–879), reformulated by Dante to accord with quite a different (andless self-absorbed) view, see Levenstein (Leve.2003.1), p. 418.For an essay on this “last word,” see Ahern (Aher.1984.1), who, while notreferring to Ovid, argues that this canto couches its central concerns,conflating two metaphors, in the images of the heavens as book and of the starsas alphabet.Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) points out that the presence of the same formof the verb muovere in the first and last lines of the cantica creates a sort ofring composition. He also points out that Dante’s practice in this regardresembles that found in canzoni of other poets in his time; he also suggests thepertinence of the ending (which happens to constitute its thirty-thirdparagraph) of the Epistle to Cangrande (XIII.90): “And since, when the Beginningor First, which is God, has been reached, there is nought to be sought forbeyond, inasmuch as He is Alpha and Omega, that is, the Beginning and the End,as the Vision of John tells us, the work ends in God Himself, who is blessed forevermore, world without end” (tr.
