We wouldlike to say the same of this translation. We have tried to bring Dante into ourEnglish without being led into the temptation of making the translation soundbetter than the original allows. The result may be judged by all who know him inhis own idiom. This is not Dante, but an approximation of what he mightauthorize had he been looking over our shoulders, listening to our at timesferocious arguments. We could go on improving this effort as long as we live. Wehope that as much as we have accomplished will find an understanding ear andheart among those who know the real thing. Every translation begins and ends infailure. To the degree that we have been able to preserve some of the beauty andpower of the original, we have failed the less.The accuracy of the translation from the Italian text established by GiorgioPetrocchi (1966–67) has been primarily my responsibility, its sound as Englishverse primarily that of the poet Jean Hollander, my wife and collaborator. Aswill be clear from various notes in the text, I am not always in accord withPetrocchi’s readings; however, I thought it imperative to use as the base ofthis entire project the current standard Italian text of the work, indicating myoccasional desire to diverge from it only in its margins. My original intentionwas to reproduce the John D. Sinclair translation (1939) of Inferno, cleaning upits just barely post-Victorian “thee”s and “thou”s and other such, to atwenty-first-century ear, outdated usages. However, (a) differences between theItalian in the Società Dantesca Italiana (1921) edition, from which Sinclairtranslated, and Petrocchi’s edition, (b) later “corrections” of Sinclair’sversion by a later translator, Charles Singleton, (c) further study of Dante’slines themselves, (d) a sense of ways in which a prose translation eventuallyfails to be “sayable”—all of these considerations led us to attempt a new versetranslation of the first cantica, despite our original debt to Sinclair.Those who come to our text familiar with the Singleton translation (1970) willperhaps think that it is its resonance that they occasionally hear; this isbecause a tremendous amount of Singleton’s translation conforms word-for-word toSinclair’s, as anyone may see simply by opening the two volumes side by side.Thus, having decided to begin with Sinclair and to modify him, we found thatSingleton had apparently done essentially the same thing. To his credit, hischanges are usually for the better; to his blame is his failure to acknowledgethe frequency of his exact coincidence with Sinclair. And thus, on his ownadvice, we have considered it “a mistake … not to let the efforts of one’spredecessors contribute to one’s own” (page 372), and have on occasion includedhis divergences from Sinclair when we found them just. However, let there be nomistake: the reason our translation seems to reflect Singleton’s, to the extentthat it does, is that ours, on occasion, and Singleton’s, almost always, areboth deeply indebted to Sinclair.In February 1997, when my wife and I decided to commit ourselves to this effort,we were able to consult the draft of a verse translation of Inferno composed byPatrick Creagh and me (begun in 1984 and abandoned in 1988, with some 80 percentof the work Englished). Some of its phrases have found their way to our text,and we owe a considerable debt to Patrick Creagh (and to my earlier self), whichwe are glad to acknowledge. We also owe a debt to the prose paraphrases ofdifficult Italian passages found in the still helpful English commentary by theRev. Dr. H. F. Tozer (1901); and to glosses gleaned from various Italiancommentaries (most particularly, in the early cantos, those of Francesco Mazzoni[1965–85], but also to the interpretive paraphrases found in the Bosco/Reggiocommentary [1979]). We decided early on that we would not consult contemporaryverse translations until after we had finished our work, so as to keep othervoices out of our ears.Several friends and colleagues have helped us in our task. Lauren ScancarelliSeem, administrative coordinator of the Princeton Dante Project, was our firstreader, making a number of suggestions for changes. Margherita Frankel, aveteran Dantist as well as a good friend, gave us a close reading and made manyvaluable criticisms to which we have attended. The poet Frederick Tibbetts lentus his exacting ear and made dozens of helpful suggestions. Lino Pertile, theDante scholar at Harvard University, also combed through our text and made anumber of helpful suggestions. The paperback edition benefitted from the eagleeye of Peter D’Epiro, who caught a number of slips that have been corrected inthis printing. Our greatest debt is to Robert Fagles, who went through thistranslation verse by verse and made many hundreds of comments in our margins. Tohave had such attentive advice from the most favored translator of Homer of ourday has been our extraordinary fortune and pleasure.Our goal has been to offer a clear translation, even of unclear passages. Wehave also tried to be as compact as possible—not an easy task, either. It is ourhope that the reader will find this translation a helpful bridge to theuntranslatable magnificence of Dante’s poem.February 1997 (Florence)–February 1998 (Tortola)For this reprinting of the Anchor Books edition, we have made about one hundredand fifty changes in the translation, mainly affecting phrasing and punctuation.There are also some five or six changes in the notes.November 2010 (Hopewell)"},{"pageContent":"TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS & LIST OF COMMENTATORS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.

It is probably impossible to define the conceptanalytically to anyone’s satisfaction, but it may be described pragmatically: awork that is loved, over time, by millions of more-or-less ordinary readers andby thousands of scholars. Dante, by the time he was writing the fourth canto ofInferno, had already decided he was writing such a book. He sets his name downas one of the six all-time great writers: only Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Horace, andLucan have preceded him (he will later add Statius). Unspeakably self-assured asthis poet may seem, many today would now shorten that list, perhaps even to two:Homer and Dante. His self-confidence may seem overweening, but he was even moreof a prophet than he realized.In about 1306, having entered his forties, he set about work on his Comedy. By1295 he had written a “little book” (the nomenclature is his own), The New Life,thirty-one of his lyric poems surrounded by a governing prose commentary thatalmost explains the eventual meaning of his love for a young woman of Florencenamed Beatrice, who had died in 1290 at the age of twenty-five. We know nothingabsolutely certain about her, whether she was an actual woman (if so, probably amember of the Portinari family, and then almost certainly married) or whethershe is a fictitious lady of the sort that love-poets invented in order to have asubject to write about. The text, on the other hand, makes it clear that we areto treat her as historical, and also suggests that we are to understand that shemeans more than she seems, for she is ineluctably joined with the Trinity, andin particular with the life of Christ. Dante seems completely aware of theradical newness of a lady loaded with such lofty theological meaning in thetradition of vernacular poetry of love. That is, he knows that what he isproposing is out of bounds. And this is why he is usually so very diffident inhis remarks, forcing us to draw some rather disquieting conclusions about thenature of the very special kind of love that eventually informs his praise ofBeatrice.Before he began work on his “theological epic,” the Comedy, he had also writtenmajor parts of two other works, one a presentation of his ideas about eloquencein the vernacular, De vulgari eloquentia, the second, Convivio, a lengthy studyof moral philosophy (in the form of commentary to his own odes), of which he hadcompleted four of the projected fifteen “treatises.” He had been activelyinvolved in the often bitterly contested political life of Florence, at thattime one of the most important European cities, swollen with new wealth andconsequent political power. At a time when that city had only six of them, heserved the customary two-month term as one of its priors, the highest politicaloffice in the city. By 1302, having inherited the wrong political identity, helost practically everything when his party, the White Guelph faction, wasoutfoxed by the Black Guelphs, supported by the allied forces of Pope BonifaceVIII and the French king. He was exiled in 1302 and never returned home again.He then lived a mainly itinerant life in northern Italy, with two longish staysin Verona and a final one in Ravenna, where he died of malarial fever inSeptember 1321 at the age of fifty-six.The political situation of northern Italy during his lifetime was distinguishedby factionalism and chaos. The emperors who were supposed to govern all ofEurope had, for centuries, mainly avoided their Italian responsibilities. Thelast of them to rule in Italy was Frederick II (we hear of him in Inferno X andXIII), and he, while one of the greatest figures in Europe, was not a leader toDante’s liking. Dead in 1250, Frederick was the last emperor to govern fromItaly. Dante hoped for an imperial restoration of the proper kind, and, toeveryone’s amazement, including his own, had his hopes rewarded when the newlycrowned Henry VII, a compromise candidate from Luxembourg, allowed to becomeemperor primarily because of the machinations of Pope Clement V, descended intothe peninsula to rule Europe from Italy in 1310. When his military expeditioneventually failed because of his death in 1313, Dante’s imperial hopes weredealt a terrible blow, but not finally dashed. To the end of his days (and inthe text of Paradiso XXVII and XXX) he insisted on believing that a new“Augustus” would fulfill God’s design for Italy and Europe.On the local level, late-thirteenth-century northern Italy (Milano, to thenorth, and Rome, to the south, are barely on Dante’s personal political map;rather we hear, in addition to Florence, of such cities as Genoa, Pisa, Pistoia,Siena, etc.) was in constant turmoil. The two main “parties” were the Guelphs(those essentially allied with the papacy) and the Ghibellines (aligned with theemperor—when there was one to be aligned with—or at least with imperial hopes).But most politics, as they are in our own time, were local. And there, labelsdid not count so much as family. In Florence the Ghibellines had been defeatedand banished in 1266, a year after Dante’s birth, leaving the city entirelyGuelph. But that did not betoken an era of unity. The Guelphs themselves werealready divided (as they were in many northern cities) in two factions, the“Blacks,” led by the Donati family (into a less powerful branch of which Dantemarried), and the “Whites,” led by the Cerchi. (It is probably correct to saythat the Whites were more devoted to a republican notion of governance, whilethe Blacks were more authoritarian.) The first impetus toward political divisionhad occurred early in the century, when a young man, member of a Ghibellinefamily, broke off his engagement and married a Guelph Donati (in Pistoia, notentirely dissimilarly, the roots of division supposedly began in a snowballfight). A member of a White Guelph family, and having married into the mostimportant Black family, Dante was therefore tied to Guelph interests. How then,do we explain his patent allegiance, in the Comedy, to the imperial cause? In1306 or so he seems to have, rereading the Latin classics, reformulated his ownpolitical vision (as is first evident in the fourth and fifth chapters of thelast treatise of the Convivio, before which there is not a clear imperialistsentiment to be found in his writing). And so, nominally a Guelph, Dante was farmore in accord with Ghibelline ideas, except that, in practice, he foundGhibellines lacking in the religious vision that he personally saw as thefoundation of any imperialist program. Politics are everywhere in the poem,which is far from being the purely religious text that some of its readers takeit for.In his exile, the Commedia (first called the Divina Commedia only in 1555 by aVenetian publisher) became his obsession. For about fifteen years, with fewexceptions (a notable one being his treatise, Monarchia, concerning the divineprerogatives of the empire, perhaps composed in 1317), the poem absorbed almostall of his time and energy. Its “motivating idea” is a simple one, outrageouslyso. In the Easter period of 1300 a thirty-five-year-old Florentine, strugglingwith failure and apparently spiritual death, is rescued by the shade of theRoman poet Virgil. He, won to the project by the living soul of Beatrice, whodescends to hell from her seat in heaven in order to enlist his aid, agrees tolead Dante on a journey through hell and purgatory. Beatrice herself will againdescend from heaven to take Dante the rest of the way, through the nine heavenlyspheres and into paradise, where angels and souls in bliss gaze, in endlessrapture, on God. The entire journey takes nearly precisely one week, Thursdayevening to Thursday evening. It begins in fear and trembling on this earth andends with a joyous vision of the trinitarian God. It is perhaps difficult toimagine how even a Dante could have managed to build so magnificent an edificeout of so improbable a literary idea. The result was a book that began to betalked about, known from parts that seem to have circulated before the whole,even before it was finished (first citations begin to be noted around 1315). Bythe time he had completed it, shortly before his death, people were eagerlyawaiting the publication of Paradiso. And within months of his death (or evenbefore) commentaries upon it began to be produced. It was, in short, an instant“great book,” probably the first of its kind since the last century of the paganera, when Romans (no less of them than Augustus himself) awaited eagerly thefinished text of Virgil’s Aeneid.One of the most striking things about the Comedy is the enormous apparatus thathas attached itself to it. No secular work in the western tradition has sodeveloped a heritage of line-by-line commentary, one that began in Latin andItalian and that has now entered any number of languages, European, Slavic, andAsian. It is clear that Dante’s work convinced the scholars of his time thatthis was a poem worthy of the most serious attention, both as a purveyor of themost important ideas of Christianity (e.g., sin, grace, redemption,transcendence) and as a response to the greatest of the Latin poets (Virgilforemost, but also Ovid, Statius, Lucan, and others) and philosophers (Aristotle[in his Arabic/Latin form] and Cicero, primarily). Knowledge of Greek hadessentially disappeared from the time of the establishment of Latin Christianityas the dominant religion and culture of the West in the fifth and sixthcenturies. The study of the language would only gradually begin again some fiftyyears after Dante’s death. And thus while Dante knows about Greek philosophy,all he has experienced of it comes from the works (most of Aristotle) and bitsand pieces (only one work of Plato’s, the Timaeus, and excerpts of some of thepre-Socratics) that had been translated into Latin. Strangely, for a modernreader, his first commentators pay little or no attention to his close andfairly extensive dealings with the poems of his vernacular predecessors andco-practitioners (Guido Guinizzelli, Arnaut Daniel, Brunetto Latini, GuidoCavalcanti, Cino da Pistoia, and others). Perhaps the most impressive aspect ofthese commentaries (and we are speaking of line-by-line analyses, on the modelof commentary to the Bible or to a handful of especially respected classicalauthors, a form essentially denied to modern writers before 1300) is the vastnumber of them. From the first twenty years after Dante’s death at least tenhave survived; by our own time there are hundreds.Along with conquering the allegiance of scholars, Dante won the hearts ofless-erudite Italians (or, at first, Tuscans) who found in his vast poem thefirst use of Italian as a literary language in an indisputably major work.Italian poetry, beginning at the time of St. Francis in the early twelfthcentury, had performed wonders, but it had rarely found a subject that seemedserious enough. Here was a poem that tackled everything: theology, religion,philosophy, politics, the sciences of heaven (astronomy/astrology) and of earth(biology, geology), and, perhaps most of all, the study of human behavior. Andit did all these things in a language that everyone could understand, or atleast thought he could. It is probably not true to suggest that Dante “inventedmodern Italian.” What he did do was to deploy Italian as a literary language ona major scale, incorporating the “serious” subjects that had hitherto beenreserved to Latin. If the Italian language had been waiting for a voice, Dantegave it that voice. Before him it did not exist in a global form, a completelanguage fit for all subjects; after him it did. It is probably not because ofhim that Italian has changed no more between his time and today than English hassince Shakespeare’s day. It is, nonetheless, a continuing surprise and rewardfor contemporary Italians to have so ancient and yet so approachable a father,speaking, at least most of the time, words that they themselves use (andsometimes that he had invented).Is Dante an “easy” poet? That depends on what passages we happen to be reading.He can be as simple and straightforward as one’s country neighbor, or asconvoluted as the most arcane professor. (Boccaccio, one of his greatestadvocates, also shows both proclivities in the prose of the Decameron.) Yet hehas always found a welcome from the least schooled of readers, and even fromthose who could not read at all, but learned the poem by rote. A living Tuscanfarmer/poet, Mauro Punzecchi, years ago memorized the poem while he worked hisfields and is today able to recite all of it. Who does not envy him his gift?Each of us reads his own Commedia, which makes perfect sense, most of the time.It is only when we try to explain “our” poem to someone else that the troublestarts.The commentary that accompanies this new translation is, like every one that haspreceded it, except the first few, indebted to earlier discussions of this text.And what of that text, as Dante left it? No one has ever seen his autographversion. As a result, the manuscript tradition of the poem is vast andcomplicated. Nonetheless, and despite all the difficulties presented byparticular textual problems, the result of variant readings in variousmanuscripts, it must be acknowledged that in the Comedy we have a remarkablystable text, given the facts that we do not possess an autograph and that thecondition of the manuscripts is so unyieldingly problematic. However, we do knowthat Dante left us precisely 14,233 verses arranged in one hundred cantos, allof which contained precisely the number of verses we find in them today in everymodern edition. And that is no small thing.And so each reader comes to a text that offers some problems of the textualvariety; these pale beside problems of interpretation. What we can all agree onis that the work is a wonder to behold. Reading Dante is like listening to Bach.It is unimaginable to think that a human being, so many years ago (or indeedever), could make such superhuman magic. Yet there it is, beckoning, but alsorefusing to yield some of its secrets.When I considered how I might present this poem in a brief introduction, afteryears of thinking about it and teaching it and writing about it, I thought ofwhat I myself missed when I started reading Dante. The first was a sense ofDante’s intellectual biography; the second was a set of answers to a series ofquestions: how does allegory work (i.e., how does this poem “mean”)? What doesVirgil represent and why is he the first guide in the poem? How am I supposed toreact to the sinners of Inferno, especially those that seem so sympathetic tome? The first subject is too vast for treatment here. My own attempt at anintellectual biography of the poet is available in Italian (Dante Alighieri,Rome, Editalia, 2000; an English version was published by Yale University Pressin 2001). The three questions I have tried to answer, both in the “Lectures”found currently in the Princeton Dante Project, and, in shorter form, in anessay I wrote a year ago (“Dante: A Party of One,” First Things 92 [April 1999]:30–35; the essay on Virgil also has some points in common with my article,“Virgil,” in the Dante Encyclopedia, ed. Richard Lansing, New York, Garland,2000). What follows is another attempt to deal with three important mattersfacing any first-time reader of the poem, or any reader at all.(1) Allegory.When I was young I was taught that Dante’s poem was the very essence ofallegorical writing. What exactly is allegory? Simply put, it is theinterpretive strategy of understanding one thing as meaning not itself butsomething other. A lady, blindfolded, holding a pair of scales in one hand, isnot to be understood as a being with a particular history, but as a timelessentity, an abstraction: justice. If we understand just this much, we areprepared to comprehend how we might read—and how many of his first readers didunderstand—Dante’s poem as an “allegory.” Virgil is not the Roman poet so muchas he is human reason unenlightened by faith; when he acts or speaks in the poemhe does so without the historical context supplied by his life or works. Andwhat of the second guide in the poem, Beatrice? She, too, is removed from herhistorical role in Dante’s life, and is treated as an abstraction, in her casethe truths discovered through faith, or perhaps revelation, or theology. Andwhat of the protagonist, Dante himself? That he has a very personal history, ofwhich we hear a good deal, matters not. He is a sort of “Everyman,” andrepresents the ordinarily appetitive human soul. Please let me explain that Imyself think very little of such formulations, but they are found in almost allthe early commentators. In a term derived from Cicero, these interpretersthought of allegory as a “continuous metaphor.” The most significant actionsperformed in the poem, they thought, could best be understood as part of thissingle, developing metaphor, in which the flawed human soul called “Dante” isgradually educated, first by reason (referred to as “Virgil”), and then bytheological certainty (code name “Beatrice”).Since something like this does seem to occur in the course of the poem, we cansense why the formulation has its appeal. The problem is that it shortchangesthe entire historical referentiality of the poem. Dante’s life disappears as asubject worthy of attention; Virgil’s texts need not be read or understood asways to find out what the poem means when it refers to them; Beatrice’s earthlyexistence as a young woman becomes utterly superfluous, as does her“relationship” (a curiously and precisely wrong word, given its contemporaryusage) with Dante. Fourteen centuries ago Isidore of Seville defined allegory as“otherspeech,” in which a speaker or writer said one thing but meant somethingelse by it. Without exploring the limitations that he himself imposed upon thatformula, we can merely note that it is frequently used in modern days to explainallegory simply and quickly. If I say “Beatrice” I do not mean her, but what shemeans. We are back to the lady holding the scales. To use a medieval example,St. Thomas explains (Summa I.i.9) that when the Bible refers to the arm of God(Isaiah 51:9) it does not mean that God has an arm, but that He has operativepower. That is, we can discard the literal for its significance, or, in moremodern terms, the signifier for the signified. Does this way of reading Danteutterly denature the text we have before us? Perhaps not utterly, but enough sothat we should avoid it as much as we can.The matter gets more interesting and more complicated because Dante himselfwrote about the question of allegory. In his Convivio he distinguishes betweenallegory as it is understood and practiced by poets (along the lines we havebeen discussing) and as it is used by theologians in order to understand certainpassages in the Bible (a very different procedure that we will examine in amoment). And in Convivio (II.i) he says the “correct” thing: it is hisintention, in the explication of his odes, to follow the allegorical proceduresof the poets (“since it is my intention here to follow the method of the poets,I shall take the allegorical sense according to the usage of the poets”). Thereare those who put this remark to the service of the claim that the “allegory ofthe theologians” thus has nothing to do with Dante’s procedures in the Comedy,either. However, that is exactly what he claims in the letter he wrote to hispatron, Cangrande della Scala of Verona. The authenticity of his Epistle toCangrande, written sometime after Dante had begun writing the Paradiso, and thusprobably no earlier than 1316, is one of the most debated of Dantean questions.It is difficult for this writer to be fair to the negative argument, which is soobviously based in a desire to cancel what the epistle says. Whether or notDante wrote it (and current scholarly opinion is, once again, decidedly infavor), this remarkable document puts forward the disturbing (to use a mildword) idea that Dante’s poem was written with the same keys to meaning as wasthe Bible. No one had ever said as much about his own work before, and it mustbe made clear that it is anathema to any sensible person of Dante’s (or any)time. If this were the only occasion on which this most venturesome of writershad said something outrageous, one might want to pay more heed to those who tryto remove the text from his canon on the ground that he had no business makingsuch a claim.The principal tenet of theological allegory is that it holds certain (but notall) historical events in the Bible as a privileged and limited class of texts.Some historical passages in the Bible possessed four senses. The four senses ofthe Bible are generally put forth, and especially in the wake of Thomas Aquinas(Summa theologiae I.i.10), as follows: (1) historical/literal, (2) allegorical,(3) moral or tropological, (4) anagogical. It is helpful to understand thatthese senses unfurl in a historical continuum. For instance, the historicalMoses, leading the Israelites out of captivity, gains his allegorical meaning inChrist, leading humankind out of bondage to the freedom of salvation. His moral(or tropological—these words are used synonymously) sense is presentnow—whenever “now” occurs—in the soul of the believer who chooses to make his orher “exodus” from sin; while the anagogical sense is found only after the end oftime, when those who are saved are understood as having arrived in the NewJerusalem, eternal joy in heaven. To offer a second example, one favored byDante’s early commentators: Jerusalem was the historical city of Old Testamenttime; it points to the allegorical Jerusalem in which Jesus was crucified; it isthe moral or tropological “city” (whether within a single believer or as theentity formed by the Church Militant now) at any present moment; it is,anagogically, the New Jerusalem, which will exist only at the end of time. Asopposed to the literal sense of poet’s allegory, the literal sense oftheological allegory is historically true, found only in events narrated in theBible (e.g., the fall of Adam and Eve, Moses leading the Israelites in theExodus, the birth of Jesus, the Crucifixion). According to the Epistle toCangrande and, more importantly, as found in the treatment of subjects in hispoem itself (most of which was written before he wrote the epistle, it isimportant to remember), Dante has adapted the techniques of theological allegoryto the making of his poem. Characters and events in it are portrayed in ahistorical mode and as part of a historical continuum. Adam, Moses, Icarus,Aeneas, Paul, Augustus, Virgil, and Dante are all portrayed as having saidthings or accomplished deeds that are seen in a historical and meaningfulpattern that gives shape to this poem. Their actual historical status does notmatter. Dante surely did not believe that Icarus had enjoyed a life on earthbeyond that conferred by poets and mythographers. But he treats him, in InfernoXVII, as a possible precursor to himself, should Dante, a latter-day flyerthrough space, have had a bad end and fallen from the back of Geryon.If we have been able to rid ourselves of the interpretive problems engendered bythe “allegory of the poets,” here we have a still larger problem. How can Dantehave written the Comedy in the same way that God wrote the Bible through hisinspired human agents? Obviously he could not have. Then why does he make sooutrageous a claim? Because what he is most concerned with is establishing the“right” of poetry to truth. This is a complex argument, and needs to beundertaken with a sense of the standing of poetry in a theological age. Let ussay that it was not propitious. St. Thomas Aquinas had been clear about theissue. Poetry was the least of the human sciences, was basically devoid ofcognitive value, and its practitioners were liars. In an intellectual climate ofthat kind, Dante was forced into making a choice. Either he did what all otherswho defended poetry had done (and as he himself had done in Convivio), admitthat poets are literally liars who nonetheless tell moral and philosophicaltruths through (poets’) allegory, or he had to find a new answer to the attackson poetry by friars like Thomas. Typically, he went his own way. If religiousdetractors of poetry say it lacks truth, he will give them truth. The Comedy ispresented, from end to end (no reader can possibly miss this fact), as a recordof an actual experience. Let us be honest with one another. You do not believe,and I do not believe, that Dante took a seven-day trip to the otherworld. But wecan agree that his claims for total veracity are in the poem. Why? Because Dantetook Thomas seriously. It is a wonderful game that he plays, daring and at timesvery funny, and surely he enjoyed playing it. Let me offer a single example,drawn from a pretty “serious” setting, the Earthly Paradise. Describing the sixwings adorning each of the four biblical beasts that represent the authors ofthe Gospels in Purgatorio XXIX, Dante assures us that their wings were six innumber (Ezechiel’s cherubic creatures had only four), that is, as many as arefound in John’s description of the same cherubs (Revelation 4:8). The text putsthis in an arresting way: “John sides with me, departing from him [Ezechiel].”No one but Dante would have said this in this way. “Here I follow John” wouldhave been the proper way for a poet to guarantee the truthfulness of hisnarrative. Not for Dante. Since the pretext of the poem is that he indeed sawall that he recounts as having seen, his own experience, in completely Thomisticspirit, comes first—he knows this by his senses. And so John is his witness, andnot he John’s.The whole question of exactly how and how much the “allegory of the theologians”permeates the Comedy is not to be rehashed here. It is the subject of a numberof books, including two by this writer. It is important to grasp that, bybreaking out of the lockstep of other poets, who give us narratives that areutterly and only fabulous, i.e., patently untrue in their literal sense, Dantewanted to take poetry somewhere new. The greatest French medieval poem, theRomance of the Rose, is built around the presentation of a series ofabstractions speaking to one another in a garden. Marianne Moore, borrowing fromanother writer, once referred to poems as “imaginary gardens with real toads inthem.” The Romance of the Rose is an imaginary garden filled with imaginarytoads; the Comedy presents itself as a real garden containing real toads. If thestudent (or teacher) who is wrestling with this difficult matter for the firsttime takes only this much away from this discussion, it should be ofconsiderable aid. The reader is not asked by the poem to see Virgil as Reason,Beatrice as Faith (or Theology or Revelation), Francesca as Lust, Farinata asHeresy, etc. We may banish such abstractions from mind, unless Dante himselfinsists on them. On occasion he does—e.g., the Lady Poverty, beloved of St.Francis [Paradiso XI.74], who is not to be confused with any historical earthlywoman, but is to be regarded as the ideal of Christ’s and the Apostles’renunciation of the things of this world. It is a useful and pleasing freedomthat, in consequence, we may enjoy: “The allegory of the Comedy is not allegoryas the commentators urge me to apply it. I may read this poem as history, andunderstand it better.” That, at least provisionally, is a good way to beginreading this poem.(2) Virgil.We should be aware that Virgil was not always Dante’s guide in poetry. The Vitanuova is essentially without major reference to him; De vulgari and the firstthree treatises of Convivio are similar in this respect. It is only in thefourth and last treatise of the latter that we can begin to see how the Comedycould make Virgil so essential a presence, for there Virgil’s texts are presentin important ways, as Dante begins to think of moral philosophy, Roman polity,and the jettisoning of allegorical procedures in the same breath. As the worldof political reality, of human choices made in time and with real consequence,for the first time becomes a stage for Dante’s thought, Virgil becomes his mostimportant resource. As is widely understood, Dante’s recovery of Virgilian textis the most noteworthy example of this phenomenon that we find in the MiddleAges. We have not yet entered the world of the Renaissance, but we are gettingclose.There are few surprises awaiting the reader of the Comedy as unsettling as tofind a pagan poet serving as guide in a Christian poem. We have perhaps gottenso used to the idea of Dante’s Virgil that we forget to be surprised by it. Forreasons that we find it difficult to fathom, Dante needed Virgil in order tomake this poem; and he wanted him to serve as a central character in it. Lesserminds would have made a less provocative choice: an anonymous friar, a learnedChristian theologian, anyone less troubling than Virgil. One tradition ofChristian reception of Virgil, which is at least as old as the emperorConstantine, held that his much-discussed fourth Eclogue actually foretold thecoming of Christ. Had Dante so believed, his choice of guide might have beenless burdensome. However, we may be certain from Monarchia (I.xi.1) that Danteknew that Virgil’s “virgin” was not the blessèd Mary but Astraea, or “justice.”Any number of passages within the Comedy make it plain that Dante did notconsider the Roman poet a Christian avant-la-lettre. We must conclude that hewillfully chose a pagan as his guide, leaving us to fathom his reasons for doingso.In recent years a growing number of Dante’s interpreters have been arguing forthe view that Dante deliberately undercuts the Latin poet, showing that both insome of his decisions as guide and in some of his own actual texts he is, fromDante’s later and Christian vantage point, prone to error. If this is the case,we must not forget that Dante at the same time is intent upon glorifying Virgil.And then we might consider the proposition that Dante’s love for him, genuineand heartfelt, needed to be held at arm’s length and chastised, perhapsrevealing to a pagan-hating reader that Dante knew full well the limitations ofhis Virgil. Yet he could not do without him. Virgil is the guide in Dante’s poembecause he served in that role in Dante’s life. It was Virgil’s Aeneid and notthe works of Aristotle or of Aquinas which served as model for the poem; it wasVirgil who, more than any other author, helped to make Dante Dante.It may take readers years of rereading before they discover an extraordinaryfact about Dante’s Virgil. For all the excitement, even exhilaration, broughtforth by Virgil’s mere presence in this poem (a text that would seem to need toexclude him on theological grounds), sooner or later the fact that he istreated, on occasion, rather shabbily begins to impress us. This is so obvious,once it is pointed out, that one can begin to understand how thoroughly trainedwe have all been to look with pleased eyes upon a Dantean love for Virgil thatheralds Renaissance humanism. To take only a few examples from the goodly supplypresented in the text of Inferno (and Purgatorio will add many another), wewitness Virgil embarrassed by the recalcitrant fallen angels who deny himentrance to the City of Dis (Inf. VIII and IX); later teased by his pupil forthat momentary failure (XIV); being careful to get Dante out of observingdistance lest Geryon prove as difficult as the rebel angels had been and thusembarrass him again (XVI); completely fooled by the demons of the pitch, whocause him acute discomfort over three cantos (XXI–XXIII). If such scenes make itseem more than unlikely that Virgil could possibly represent Reason (andcommentators who think so grow silent at the margins of these scenes, onlyoccasionally being honest enough even to say, “here the allegory isintermittent”), they also make us wonder about Dante’s motives in treating his“master and author” so disrespectfully. It is perhaps only because he lovedVirgil so deeply that he feels the need to remind himself and his reader thatthe pagan was, in the end, a failure, capable of causing another Roman poet,Statius, to convert to Christianity, but not of taking that step himself. All ofthat seems wrong to us. There is perhaps no doctrine in the entire Comedy sohateful to modern readers as that which makes pagans—and others outside theChristian dispensation—responsible for knowing Christ. When we consider Dante’ssituation, however, his motives may seem more understandable to us. Havingfought off the temptation to make Virgil a Christian, Dante must now showhimself and his reader that he has not gone overboard in his affections.There is another disturbing element to Dante’s Virgilianism. Not only is Virgilthe character forced to undergo some seriously humiliating moments, but histexts are also on the receiving end of Dante’s playful mockery. Perhaps the mostevident moment of this occurs in the twentieth canto, where Virgil is made torevise an episode in the tenth book of the Aeneid so that it accords better withChristian ideas about divination. It is a richly woven scene, and is extremelyfunny (Dante is a much funnier poet than we like to acknowledge), once we beginto understand the literary game that is being played under our eyes. And this isnot the only time that Virgil’s texts receive such treatment. We will even findthe Aeneid remembered in the very last canto of Paradiso, with its reminder ofwhat the Sibyl told of Christian truth to an ear that could understand herutterance—if not Virgil’s.It is simply impossible to imagine the Comedy without Virgil. And no one beforeDante, and perhaps very few after, ever loved Virgil as he did. At the same timethere is a hard-edged sense of Virgil’s crucial failure as poet of Rome, thecity Dante celebrates for its two suns, church and empire, but which Virgil sawonly in the light of the one. For Dante, that is his great failure. As unfair asit seems to us, so much so that we frequently fail to note how often Virgil iscriticized by the later poet who so loved him, it is the price that Dante forceshim to pay when he enters this Christian precinct. And it may have been theprice that he exerted from himself, lest he seem too available to the beautifulvoices from the pagan past, seem less firm as the poet of both Romes. TheVirgilian voice of the poem is the voice that brings us, more often and moretouchingly than any other, the sense of tragedy that lies beneath the text ofthe Comedy.(3) The Moral Situation of the Reader.How are we meant to respond to the sinners in hell? That seems an easy questionto resolve. In the Inferno we see the justice of God proclaimed in theinscription over the gate of hell (III.4): “Justice moved my maker on high.” IfGod is just, it follows logically that there can be no question concerning thejustness of His judgments. All who are condemned to hell are justly condemned.Thus, when we observe that the protagonist feels pity for some of the damned, weare probably meant to realize that he is at fault for doing so. Dante, notwithout risk, decided to entrust to us, his readers, the responsibility forseizing upon the details in the narratives told by sinners, no matter howappealing their words might be, in order to condemn them on the evidence thatissues from their own mouths. It was indeed, as we can see from the many readerswho fail to take note of this evidence, a perilous decision for him to havemade. Yet we are given at least two clear indicators of the attitude that shouldbe ours. Twice in Inferno figures from heaven descend to hell to further God’spurpose in sending Dante on his mission. Virgil relates the coming of Beatriceto Limbo. She tells him, in no uncertain terms, that she feels nothing for thetribulations of the damned and cannot be harmed in any way by them or by thedestructive agents of the place that contains them (Inf. II.88-93). All shelongs to do is to return to her seat in Paradise (Inf. II.71). And when theangelic intercessor arrives to open the gates of Dis, slammed shut againstVirgil, we are told that this benign presence has absolutely no interest in thesituation of the damned or even of the living Dante. All he desires is tocomplete his mission and be done with such things (Inf. IX.88; 100-103),reminding us of Beatrice’s similar lack of interest in the damned.The complex mechanism that Dante has developed to establish what we today, afterHenry James, call “point of view” has perhaps not been examined as closely as itshould be. If we consider it, we realize how “modern” it is. The essentialstaging of any scene in Inferno involving a confrontation with a sinnerpotentially contains some or all of the following voices: (1) the all-knowingnarrator, who has been through the known universe (and beyond!) and knows andunderstands everything a mortal being can understand; (2) Virgil, the wise guidewho understands (most of the time) all that an extremely intelligent pagan canunderstand (which is considerable, if at some times more limited than atothers); (3) the gradually more-and-more-informed protagonist, who moves fromalarming cowardice and ignorance to relatively sound moral competence andjudgment before the Inferno ends; (4) a sinner (sometimes more than one) who mayor may not be trying to tell his or her story in a distorted, self-serving way,seeking a better reputation, whether in Dante’s eyes or in the view ofposterity. That is a brief morphology of the possible combination of speakers inany given scene. We all should be able to agree that such an arrangement is, ifnothing else, complex. If the only speaker were Dante the narrator, we wouldalways know where he (and we) stood. When we reflect that he hardly everintervenes with moral glosses within scenes, we learn something important aboutthis poem: it will not do our work for us. Most of the speakers are, thus, atbest usually reliable, at worst completely unreliable. The gradations of theirqualifications may change with every scene. And we are left with the problem ofevaluating the result. Let us examine only a single scene to see how this gridof potential understanding functions.In one of the most celebrated passages in all of literature, Francesca da Riminitells the protagonist her story (Inf. V.72–142). As is usual, the omniscientnarrator tells us nothing but the facts. From him we learn that the protagonistwas overcome by pity (72—is this a good or bad thing?); that the sinners looklike doves (82–84—what is the “iconography” of these doves, birds of Venus orsigns of the Holy Spirit [the two most usual medieval associations for thesebirds]?); that Francesca and Paolo come from a line of sinners that includesDido (85—Dido has a pretty rocky medieval reputation as adulteress; doesFrancesca suffer from guilt by association?); that the protagonist’s summoningcall was full of affection and was effective (87—is this to be applauded?).Later, he will tell us that Dante was greatly stirred by Francesca’s firstspeech (109–111—again, what moral view should we take of his behavior?). And heconcludes the canto with the information that Paolo was weeping all throughFrancesca’s second speech (139–140—what do we make of these tears?) and that theprotagonist, filled with pity, collapsed in a faint (141–142—what moral viewshould we take of that?). The omniscient narrator could have given us answers toall these questions; he is content to raise them (intrinsically, he rarely asksquestions outright) and leave them in our minds. Often, and surely in theRomantic era, many readers have thought that we are meant to identify with theprotagonist’s view of the scene. And that view, at least, is unambiguous. He isintrigued by the sight of these two handsome shades (73–75), cries out to themwith courteous regard for their prerogatives (80–81), bursts into apassionately-felt sense of identification with them (112–114), tells Francescaas much (116–117), and then asks her to spell out exactly how she was overcomeby love (118–120). And that is all he says. Of course the narrator tells usthat, at the conclusion of Francesca’s words, he faints from pity, perhaps hissingle most eloquent response. We at least know where he stands.What of Virgil, Dante’s guide? He only speaks twice, first to assure Dante thatthese lovers will come if he but summon them in the name of love (77–78—hislaconic remark may be read either as a mere statement of fact or as theworld-weary remark of the poet who knows all too much about what my friend JohnFleming calls “Carthaginian love,” i.e., the passion that undermines reason,exemplified in Dido, as Virgil himself has told the tale in Aeneid IV). And thenhe has only one more two-word utterance (in Italian it is the laconic “chepense”): “What are your thoughts?” (111—is he merely asking, seeing Dante sodeep in reverie about the lovers, or is he delicately reminding Dante that heshould be thinking, rather than feeling, since we have already been told by thenarrator [at verse 39] both that the sin of lust makes “reason subject todesire” and that the protagonist has understood this?). Virgil has fewer thanthree verses of the seventy-one dedicated to the scene. What would he have saidif the poet had allotted him more? It is interesting to speculate.What about Francesca herself, the most loquacious of the four? She hasthirty-eight verses to tell her story, well over half of the scene (88–107;121–138). What she tells is moving and beautiful, like the woman herself, weimagine. In this reader’s view, one common element in both her speeches is thatsomeone or something else is always being blamed for her unhappiness: the Godwho will not hear her prayers, the god of Love who made Paolo fall in love withher beautiful physical being and made her respond similarly to his, her husbandfor killing them, the book that, describing an adulterous kiss, encouraged themto engage in an adulterous embrace, and the man who wrote that book. I admitthat I am here taking a dour view. Are we meant to read the scene this way? Mostpeople do not. (A. B. Giamatti, with whom I used to converse endlessly aboutDante, loved the Romantic reading of this canto. He once cursed me, complaining,“Are you going to try to ruin this scene for me too, Hollander?”) I hope it isclear that we all need to watch more carefully the actual exchanges among thevarious characters that might help establish a point of view from which we canstudy the events brought forward in the poem. Whatever else we can say, weshould all be ready to admit that this is complicated business. Dante isbeautiful, yes, but he is complicated.It is important to acknowledge that Romantic readers have a point. Had Dantethought that all those in hell deserved as little attention as the saved affordthem, in other words, if he felt about them as do Beatrice and the descendedangel, he could have begun the poem in purgatory, offering a brief notice of thepains of the damned, of which it is better, he might have had the guardian ofpurgatory say, not to speak. But he was interested in them, and not only asnegative exemplars for those Christians who need to reaffirm their faith andwill. The saints may have no interest in the damned, but neither we nor Danteare saints. And thus, one might argue, Inferno, the most effective part of thepoem, in human terms, deals with the problem (sin) and not its solution (faithand good works). Do we have sympathy for the damned, at least those of them thatreveal traits that we admire (effective rhetoric, strong feeling, a sense oftheir personal wrongness, even, at times, courtesy)? Of course we do. Yet weshould be aware that there is a trap for us if we go too far. We need to learnto read ironically (a word that is only used once in all Dante’s works, in theincomplete thought that ends what we have of De vulgari eloquentia [II.xiv]),finding an angle of vision that corresponds to the author’s, who expressesthoughts through his characters that need to be examined with care. That is adifficult goal.Nonetheless, it is noteworthy (though rarely, if ever, noted) that the “best”people in hell are not necessarily those whom we tend to admire most. Theyinclude those who were involved in Florentine public affairs, always championingthe cause of good governance: Ciacco (Inf. VI), Farinata degli Uberti (X),Brunetto Latini (XV), Jacopo Rusticucci and his mates (XVI), even Mosca deiLamberti (XXVIII). All of these are unusual among the denizens of hell in thatthey either own up to their sins (not making an effort to persuade Dante oftheir innocence or simply to avoid his questions about their guilt) or want tobe remembered for their good deeds on earth. That the “standard list” ofsympathetic sinners only mentions two of them (Farinata and Brunetto) isinformative: Francesca da Rimini (canto V), Farinata, Pier delle Vigne (XIII),Brunetto, Ulysses (XXVI), and Ugolino della Gherardesca (XXXIII). Francesca,Pier, Ulysses, and Ugolino all try to convince Dante of their worthiness,avoiding the subject of their sins. Their behavior in this regard might serve asa clue to an attentive reader. On this score, Ciacco is a good deal morereliable a witness than is Francesca.There is more to say about many things. The text of the poem awaits, withannotations that will address many of these. Your translators wish you aninvigorated journey through hell (not a bad place once you get used to it) andyour commentator hopes that you will find his remarks helpful.Robert HollanderTortola, 23 February 2000"},{"pageContent":"THE INFERNO: ENGLISHOUTLINE: INFERNO I1–9 [part0009.html#c01-s01-e] Dante, having lost his way, in a dark wood10–21 [part0009.html#c01-s03-e] hint of dawn: the sun on a mountaintop22–27 [part0009.html#c01-s08-e] simile: survivor of shipwreck looking back at sea28–36 [part0009.html#c01-s10-e] journey resumed; ascending the slope; a leopard37–43 [part0009.html#c01-s13-e] dawn and reassurance44–54 [part0009.html#c01-s15-e] a lion renews his fear; a she-wolf drives him back55–60 [part0009.html#c01-s19-e] simile: merchant (or gambler?) losing everything61–66 [part0009.html#c01-s21-e] apparition (of Virgil) and Dante’s first words67–75 [part0009.html#c01-s23-e] Virgil identifies himself76–78 [part0009.html#c01-s26-e] his pointed question to Dante79–90 [part0009.html#c01-s27-e] Dante’s recognition, praise of Virgil; plea for aid91–100 [part0009.html#c01-s31-e] Virgil’s warning: power of the she-wolf101–111 [part0009.html#c01-s34-e] Virgil’s prophecy of the hound that will defeat her112–120 [part0009.html#c01-s38-e] Virgil will guide Dante through two realms to a third121–129 [part0009.html#c01-s41-e] Virgil: a second guide will take him to those in bliss, since he is not allowedinto that realm130–135 [part0009.html#c01-s44-e] Dante agrees to be led through the first two realms136 [part0009.html#c01-s45-e] the two set outINFERNO I [part0017.html#c01-i] Midway in the journey of our life → [part0024.html#c01-n01] I came to myself in a dark wood, → [part0024.html#c01-n02]3 [part0017.html#c01-s01-i]3 [part0017.html#c01-s01-i] for the straight way was lost. →[part0024.html#c01-n03] Ah, how hard it is to tell the nature of that wood, savage, dense and harsh—6 [part0017.html#c01-s02-i]6 [part0017.html#c01-s02-i] the very thought of it renews my fear!

But because I would have burned and baked, fright overcame the good intentions51 [part0020.html#c16-s17-i]51 [part0020.html#c16-s17-i] that made me hunger to embrace them.

Its length of tail lashed in the void, twisting up its forked, envenomed tip,27 [part0020.html#c17-s09-i]27 [part0020.html#c17-s09-i] armed like a scorpion’s tail.

And, when we reached the beast, I see some people sitting on the sand36 [part0020.html#c17-s12-i]36 [part0020.html#c17-s12-i] a short way off, near where it fallsaway.

Then I was even more afraid of being dropped, for I saw fire and heard wailing,123 [part0020.html#c17-s41-i]123 [part0020.html#c17-s41-i] and so, trembling, I hold on tighter withmy legs. And for the first time I became aware of our descent and wheeling when I saw126 [part0020.html#c17-s42-i]126 [part0020.html#c17-s42-i] the torments drawing closer all around me.

At the very center of this malignant space there yawns a pit, extremely wide and deep.6 [part0020.html#c18-s02-i]6 [part0020.html#c18-s02-i] I will describe its plan all in duetime. A path that circles like a belt around the base of that high rock runs round the pit,9 [part0020.html#c18-s03-i]9 [part0020.html#c18-s03-i] its sides descending in ten ditches.

And, just as narrow bridges issue from the gates15 [part0020.html#c18-s05-i]15 [part0020.html#c18-s05-i] of fortresses to reach the farthest bank, so ridges stretched from the escarpment down across the banks and ditches18 [part0020.html#c18-s06-i]18 [part0020.html#c18-s06-i] into the pit at which they end and join. Dropped from Geryon’s back, this was the place →[part0026.html#c18-n02] in which we found ourselves. The poet kept21 [part0020.html#c18-s07-i]21 [part0020.html#c18-s07-i] to the left and I came on behind him. To our right I saw a suffering new to me, →[part0026.html#c18-n03] new torments, and new scourgers,24 [part0020.html#c18-s08-i]24 [part0020.html#c18-s08-i] with whom the first ditch was replete.

My gentle leader stopped with me,45 [part0020.html#c18-s15-i]45 [part0020.html#c18-s15-i] and then allowed me to retrace my steps. The scourged soul thought that he could hide by lowering his face—to no avail.48 [part0020.html#c18-s16-i]48 [part0020.html#c18-s16-i] I said: ‘You there, with your eyes castdown, ‘if I’m not mistaken in your features, you’re Venèdico Caccianemico. → [part0026.html#c18-n06]51 [part0020.html#c18-s17-i]51 [part0020.html#c18-s17-i] What has brought you to such stingingtorture?’ And he replied: ‘Unwillingly I tell it, moved only by the truth of what you’ve said,54 [part0020.html#c18-s18-i]54 [part0020.html#c18-s18-i] which brings to mind the world that onceI knew. ‘It was I who urged Ghisolabella to do the will of that marquis,57 [part0020.html#c18-s19-i]57 [part0020.html#c18-s19-i] no matter how the foul tale goes around. ‘I’m not the only Bolognese here lamenting. →[part0026.html#c18-n07] This place is so crammed with them60 [part0020.html#c18-s20-i]60 [part0020.html#c18-s20-i] that not so many tongues have learned tosay ‘ “sipa” between the Sàvena and the Reno.

A few steps farther and we came upon a place69 [part0020.html#c18-s23-i]69 [part0020.html#c18-s23-i] where a ridge jutted from the bank. This we ascended easily and, turning to the right upon its jagged ledge,72 [part0020.html#c18-s24-i]72 [part0020.html#c18-s24-i] we left behind their endlesscircling. → [part0026.html#c18-n09] When we came to the point above the hollow →[part0026.html#c18-n10] that makes a passage for the scourged,75 [part0020.html#c18-s25-i]75 [part0020.html#c18-s25-i] my leader said: ‘Stop, let them look atyou, ‘those other ill-born souls whose faces you have not yet seen, since we have all78 [part0020.html#c18-s26-i]78 [part0020.html#c18-s26-i] been moving in the same direction.’ From the ancient bridge we eyed the band advancing toward us on the other side,81 [part0020.html#c18-s27-i]81 [part0020.html#c18-s27-i] driven with whips just like the first.

From here we heard the whimpering of people one ditch away, snuffling with their snouts105 [part0020.html#c18-s35-i]105 [part0020.html#c18-s35-i] and beating on themselves with their ownpalms. The banks, made slimy by a sticky vapor from below, were coated with a mould108 [part0020.html#c18-s36-i]108 [part0020.html#c18-s36-i] offending eyes and nose. The bottom is so deep we could see nothing unless we climbed to the crown of the arch,111 [part0020.html#c18-s37-i]111 [part0020.html#c18-s37-i] just where the ridge is highest.

Searching the bottom with my eyes I saw a man, his head so smeared with shit117 [part0020.html#c18-s39-i]117 [part0020.html#c18-s39-i] one could not tell if he were priest orlayman.

Like dolphins, when they arch their backs →[part0026.html#c22-n03] above the water, giving sailors warning21 [part0021.html#c22-s07-i]21 [part0021.html#c22-s07-i] to prepare to save their ship, so from time to time, to ease his pain, one of the sinners would show his back24 [part0021.html#c22-s08-i]24 [part0021.html#c22-s08-i] and, quick as lightning, hide it onceagain.

After their fury had subsided, my leader seized this chance to ask78 [part0021.html#c22-s26-i]78 [part0021.html#c22-s26-i] the one still staring at his wound: ‘Who is the one you mentioned, from whom you parted so unwisely when you came ashore?’81 [part0021.html#c22-s27-i]81 [part0021.html#c22-s27-i] And he replied: ‘It was Fra Gomìta →[part0026.html#c22-n10] ‘of Gallura, a vessel full of fraud, who had his master’s enemies in hand84 [part0021.html#c22-s28-i]84 [part0021.html#c22-s28-i] but dealt with them so each one sings hispraises. ‘He took their money and discreetly let them off, as he himself admits.

The Navarrese chose his moment well, planted his feet and in a second123 [part0021.html#c22-s41-i]123 [part0021.html#c22-s41-i] leaped and escaped from their designs.

And if they are dead, what gives them the right90 [part0021.html#c23-s30-i]90 [part0021.html#c23-s30-i] to go uncovered by the heavy stole?’ and then to me: ‘O Tuscan, who have come to this assembly of sad hypocrites, → [part0026.html#c23-n14]93 [part0021.html#c23-s31-i]93 [part0021.html#c23-s31-i] do not disdain to tell us who you are.’ ‘In the great city, by the fair river Arno,’ I said to them, ’I was born and raised,96 [part0021.html#c23-s32-i]96 [part0021.html#c23-s32-i] and I am here in the body that was alwaysmine. ‘But who are you in whom I see distilled the misery running down your cheeks in tears?99 [part0021.html#c23-s33-i]99 [part0021.html#c23-s33-i] And what is the grief you bear thatglitters so?’ And one of them answered: ‘Our golden cloaks are made of lead, and they’re so dense,102 [part0021.html#c23-s34-i]102 [part0021.html#c23-s34-i] like scales we creak beneath theirweight. → [part0026.html#c23-n15] ‘We were Jovial Friars, born in Bologna. →[part0026.html#c23-n16] My name was Catalano, his, Loderingo. → [part0026.html#c23-n17]105 [part0021.html#c23-s35-i]105 [part0021.html#c23-s35-i] Your city made the two of us a pair, ‘where usually a single man was chosen, to keep the peace within, and we were such108 [part0021.html#c23-s36-i]108 [part0021.html#c23-s36-i] that all around Gardingo the ruins can beseen.’ I began: ‘O Friars, your evil deeds …’ →[part0026.html#c23-n18] but said no more, for one there caught my eye, →[part0026.html#c23-n19]111 [part0021.html#c23-s37-i]111 [part0021.html#c23-s37-i] fixed cross-wise to the ground by threeshort stakes.

It stretched its hind feet down the other’s thighs, thrusting its tail between them57 [part0022.html#c25-s19-i]57 [part0022.html#c25-s19-i] and curled it up behind, above thebuttocks.

That part where first we are nourished it transfixed in one of them87 [part0022.html#c25-s29-i]87 [part0022.html#c25-s29-i] and then fell prone before him. The one transfixed just stared, said nothing. Indeed, with his feet stock-still, he yawned,90 [part0022.html#c25-s30-i]90 [part0022.html#c25-s30-i] as if deep sleep or fever had assailedhim. He and the reptile stared at one another. Both gave out dense smoke, one from its wound,93 [part0022.html#c25-s31-i]93 [part0022.html#c25-s31-i] the other from its mouth. Then theirsmoke merged.

Their corresponding changes went like this: →[part0026.html#c25-n18] the reptile split its tail into a fork105 [part0022.html#c25-s35-i]105 [part0022.html#c25-s35-i] and he that was wounded drew his feettogether. First his calves and then his thighs began to knit so that in but a moment108 [part0022.html#c25-s36-i]108 [part0022.html#c25-s36-i] no sign of a division could be seen. The cloven tail assumed the shapes the other one was losing, and his skin111 [part0022.html#c25-s37-i]111 [part0022.html#c25-s37-i] was turning soft while the other’shardened. I saw the man’s arms shrinking toward the armpits and the brute’s forepaws, which had been short,114 [part0022.html#c25-s38-i]114 [part0022.html#c25-s38-i] lengthen, precisely as the other’sdwindled. Then the hind-paws, twisting together, became the member that a man conceals,117 [part0022.html#c25-s39-i]117 [part0022.html#c25-s39-i] and from his own the wretch had grown twopaws. While the smoke veils one and now the other with new color and grows hair here120 [part0022.html#c25-s40-i]120 [part0022.html#c25-s40-i] and elsewhere strips it off, one of them rose to his feet, the other fell, but neither turned aside his baleful glare123 [part0022.html#c25-s41-i]123 [part0022.html#c25-s41-i] under which each muzzle changed its shape. In the one erect it shrank in to the temples, and, from the excess flesh absorbed,126 [part0022.html#c25-s42-i]126 [part0022.html#c25-s42-i] two ears extruded from smooth cheeks. That which did not recede, the remnant of that excess, made a nose for the face129 [part0022.html#c25-s43-i]129 [part0022.html#c25-s43-i] and gave the lips a proper thickness. The one prone on the ground shoves out his snout and draws his ears into his head132 [part0022.html#c25-s44-i]132 [part0022.html#c25-s44-i] as a snail draws in its horns, and his tongue, till now a single thing and fit for speech, divides, and the other’s135 [part0022.html#c25-s45-i]135 [part0022.html#c25-s45-i] forked tongue joins, and the smoke stops. The soul just now become a brute takes flight, hissing through the hollow, and the other,138 [part0022.html#c25-s46-i]138 [part0022.html#c25-s46-i] by way of speaking, spits after him.

After the woeful rout when Charlemagne →[part0027.html#c31-n03] had lost his holy band of knights,18 [part0023.html#c31-s06-i]18 [part0023.html#c31-s06-i] Roland did not sound so terrible a blast. I had not looked that way for long → [part0027.html#c31-n04] when I saw what seemed a range of lofty towers,21 [part0023.html#c31-s07-i]21 [part0023.html#c31-s07-i] and I said: ‘Master, tell me, what cityis this?’ And he to me: ‘Because you try to pierce the darkness from too far away,24 [part0023.html#c31-s08-i]24 [part0023.html#c31-s08-i] it follows that you err in yourperception. ‘When you are nearer, you will understand how much your eyesight is deceived by distance.27 [part0023.html#c31-s09-i]27 [part0023.html#c31-s09-i] Therefore, push yourself a littleharder.’ Then with affection he took me by the hand →[part0027.html#c31-n05] and said: ‘Before we travel farther,30 [part0023.html#c31-s10-i]30 [part0023.html#c31-s10-i] and so the fact may seem to you lessstrange, ‘you should be told: these are not towers, but giants and, from the navel down,33 [part0023.html#c31-s11-i]33 [part0023.html#c31-s11-i] each stands behind the bank that ringsthe pit.’ As, when the mist is lifting, → [part0027.html#c31-n06] little by little we discern things36 [part0023.html#c31-s12-i]36 [part0023.html#c31-s12-i] hidden in the air made thick by fog, so, when my eyes saw through the heavy dark and I got nearer to the brink,39 [part0023.html#c31-s13-i]39 [part0023.html#c31-s13-i] error left me and fear came in its place. For, as all around her ring of walls → [part0027.html#c31-n07] Monteriggioni is crowned with towers,42 [part0023.html#c31-s14-i]42 [part0023.html#c31-s14-i] so at the cliff-edge that surrounds thepit loomed up like towers half the body bulk of horrifying giants, those whom Jove45 [part0023.html#c31-s15-i]45 [part0023.html#c31-s15-i] still threatens from the heavens when hethunders. Now I could discern the face of one, his chest and shoulders, a portion of his paunch,48 [part0023.html#c31-s16-i]48 [part0023.html#c31-s16-i] and, hanging at his sides, his arms. Surely nature did well when she renounced →[part0027.html#c31-n08] the craft of making creatures such as these,51 [part0023.html#c31-s17-i]51 [part0023.html#c31-s17-i] depriving Mars of such practitioners. If she does not repent her elephants and whales, when one reviews the matter closely54 [part0023.html#c31-s18-i]54 [part0023.html#c31-s18-i] she will be found more cautious and morejust. For when the power of thought is coupled with ill will and naked force57 [part0023.html#c31-s19-i]57 [part0023.html#c31-s19-i] there is no refuge from it for mankind. His face appeared to me as long and broad →[part0027.html#c31-n09] as is, in Rome, the pine cone at St. Peter’s,60 [part0023.html#c31-s20-i]60 [part0023.html#c31-s20-i] his other parts as large in like degree, so that the bank, which hid him like an apron from his middle downwards, still showed63 [part0023.html#c31-s21-i]63 [part0023.html#c31-s21-i] so much of him above that quite in vain three Frieslanders might boast of having reached his hair. For I saw thirty spans of him66 [part0023.html#c31-s22-i]66 [part0023.html#c31-s22-i] beneath the place where men make fasttheir cloaks. ‘Raphèl maì amècche zabì almi,’ → [part0027.html#c31-n10] the savage mouth, for which no sweeter69 [part0023.html#c31-s23-i]69 [part0023.html#c31-s23-i] psalms were fit, began to shout. →[part0027.html#c31-n11] And, in response, my leader: ‘You muddled soul, →[part0027.html#c31-n12] stick to your horn!

They wound five times around his bulk90 [part0023.html#c31-s30-i]90 [part0023.html#c31-s30-i] on the part of him that we could see. ‘This prideful spirit chose to test his strength →[part0027.html#c31-n14] against almighty Jove,’ my leader said,93 [part0023.html#c31-s31-i]93 [part0023.html#c31-s31-i] ‘and this is his reward. ‘He is Ephialtes.

Going farther on, we came upon Antaeus.

[part0009.html#c01-s01-e] The first of the 14,233 lines that constitute theComedy immediately establishes a context for the poem that is both universal andparticular. It also immediately compels a reader to realize that this is adifficult work, one that may not be read passively, but calls for the reader’sactive engagement.Many commentators have pointed out that this opening verse echoes a biblicaltext, Isaiah’s account of the words of Hezekiah, afflicted by the “sickness untodeath” (Isaiah 38:10): “in dimidio dierum meorum vadam ad portas inferi” (in themidst of my days, I shall go to the gates of the nether region). Many anotherpotential “source” has found proponents, but this one is so apposite that it hasprobably received more attention than any other. One other should also bementioned here, the Tesoretto of Brunetto Latini (see note to Inf. XV.50).Another tradition holds that the reference is to the age of Dante when he madehis voyage (he was thirty-five years old in 1300, half of the biblical “threescore and ten”—Psalms 89:10). In addition, some commentators have noted theresonance of the epic tradition in Dante’s opening phrase, since epics were seenas beginning, like this poem, in medias res, “in the midst of the action,” notat its inception.Related issues are also debated by the earliest commentators, in particular thedate of the vision. While there has been disagreement even about the year of thejourney to the otherworld, indicated at various points as being 1300 (e.g., Inf.X.79–80, XXI.113, Purg. II.98, XXXII.2), it is clear that Dante has set his workin the Jubilee Year, proclaimed by Pope Boniface VIII in February of 1300. Farmore uncertainty attends the question of the actual days indicated. Dante’sdescent into hell is begun either on Friday, 25 March or on Friday, 8 April,with the conclusion of the journey occurring almost exactly one week later. Infavor of the March date, one can argue that Dante could hardly have chosen amore propitious date for a beginning: March 25 was the anniversary of thecreation of Adam, of the conception and of the Crucifixion of Christ, and alsomarked the Florentine “New Year,” since that city measured the year from theAnnunciation.

[part0009.html#c01-s01-e] mi ritrovai (I came to myself) has the sense of asudden shocked discovery. “It is the pained amazement of one who has only now,for the first time, become aware that he is in peril” (Padoan, comm. to Inf.I.2).The grammatical solecism (“Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita / mi ritrovai”[Midway in the journey of our life I came to myself…]), mixing plural andsingular first-persons, is another sign of the poet’s desire to make his readergrasp the relation between the individual and the universal, between Dante andall humankind. His voyage is meant to be understood as ours as well.The selva oscura is one of the governing images of this canto and of the poem.Many commentators point to the previous metaphorical statement found in theDantean work that is probably nearest in time to it, the fourth treatise of hisConvivio (Conv. IV.xxiv.12), where the author refers to “la selva erronea diquesta vita” (the error-filled wood of this life). But here the wood is to betaken “historically” in at least a certain sense, and seems to reflect, to somereaders, the condition of Eden after the Fall. In such a reading, Dante’s sinfullife is as though lived in the ruins of Eden, the place to which he has lethimself be led, away from the light of God. In any case, the wood indicates notsin itself, but human life lived in the condition of sin. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s01-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c01-s01-i]]3. [part0009.html#c01-s01-e] See Wisdom 5:7: “Lassati sumus in via iniquitateet perditionis, et ambulavimus vias difficiles; viam autem Domini ignoravimus”(We grew weary in the way of iniquity and perdition, and we walked difficultpathways; to the way of the Lord, however, we paid no attention)—perhaps firstnoted in Padoan’s commentary to this verse.

The problem is a simple one to describe: what is theantecedent of the implicit subject of the verb è (“It is so bitter …”)? Thereare three feminine nouns that may have that role, since the predicate adjective,amara (bitter), is also in the feminine: cosa dura (hard thing, v. 4), selva(wood, v. 5), paura (fear, v. 6). Several current commentators are convincedthat selva is the antecedent. On the other hand, it seems likely that theantecedent is the phrase cosa dura (as in Castelvetro’s commentary). The entirepassage makes good sense when read this way. To tell of his experience in thedark and savage wood is difficult (vv. 4–6) and so bitter that only dying seemsmore bitter; but, in order to treat of the better things he found in the wood,he will speak. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s03-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c01-s03-i]]8–9. [part0009.html#c01-s03-e] These innocent-sounding lines have been thecause of considerable puzzlement. What is “the good” that Dante found? What arethe “other things”? It may be that these terms are in antithetic relation. Overfive hundred years ago Filippo Villani (Bell.1989.1, p. 93) offered this gloss:“de bonis et malis in silva repertis” (of the good and the bad found in theforest). Following this line of interpretation yields the following generalsense of the passage: “Even in the depths of my sin I found God in terriblethings.” And thus the ben is not here Virgil (as many commentators suggestdespite the fact that Virgil does not appear to Dante in the forest), but God’sgrace in allowing Dante to learn of His goodness even in his worst experiences.[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s03-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c01-s03-i]]11. [part0009.html#c01-s04-e] pien di sonno. The date is Thursday, 24 March(or 7 April?) 1300. As the text will later make clear (Inf. XXI.112–114), we areobserving the 1266th anniversary of Good Friday (which fell on 8 April in 1300[but see note to v. 1, above]). This would indicate that the poem actuallybegins on Thursday evening, the 1266th anniversary of Maundy Thursday, when theApostles slept while Christ watched in the garden, and continued to sleep evenas He called to them to rise. That this moment is recalled here seems likely:Dante, too, is “asleep” to Christ in his descent into sin.

[part0009.html#c01-s05-e] The colle (hill) is generally interpreted assignifying the good life attainable by humankind under its own powers; some,however, believe it has a higher and spiritual meaning, involving salvation.

[part0009.html#c01-s05-e] paura (fear), as many have pointed out, isperhaps the key word, in the beginning of the poem, that describes Dante’sperilous inner condition.

[part0009.html#c01-s07-e] For Boccaccio, this “lake” or “concavity” in theheart is the place to which our emotions flow; he goes on to mention fear as theexemplary emotion, thus giving Dante’s verse a “medical” explanation.

[part0009.html#c01-s08-e] This is the first simile in a poem filled withsimiles, as many as four hundred of them. Here, in response to the first ofthese, it is perhaps helpful to observe that “similes” in Dante are varied, andpossibly fall into three rough categories: “classical” similes, like this one,perfectly balanced and grammatically correct; “improper classical” similes,which are similarly balanced but not expressed with grammatical precision; andsimple comparisons, brief and unembellished. For a study in English of theDantean simile see Lans.1977.1; for bibliography see Sowe.1983.1.This simile probably takes its setting from the Aeneid (I.180–181), the scene ofAeneas’s shipwreck on the coast of Carthage, and begins a series of linkingallusions to the narrative of the first book of that poem that run throughInferno I and II. Dante begins his role as protagonist in this “epic” as the“new Aeneas”; his first words as speaker will later suggest that he is the “newDavid” as well (v. 65). [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s08-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c01-s08-i]]26–27. [part0009.html#c01-s09-e] A much-disputed passage. Almost allcommentators equate the passo with the selva (see note to v. 2, above). Thedebate centers on whether the relative pronoun che is objective or subjective,i.e., do we say “the pass that never let a mortal being go alive” or “the passno mortal being ever left behind”? Mazzoni (Mazz.1967.1, pp. 79–86) offersconvincing evidence for the second reading, on the basis of Dante’s elsewiseconstant use of the verb lasciare in this way (to mean “abandon,” “leavebehind”). We have followed Mazzoni in our translation.Dante’s verse may reflect one of the first vernacular poems in Italian, the“Laudes creaturarum” of St. Francis, vv. 27–28: “Laudato si’, mi’ Signore, persora nostra morte corporale, / de la quale nullu homo vivente pò skappare”(Blessed be thou, my Lord, for our sister mortal death, from whom no living mancan escape). Whether or not this is the case (and we might consider a secondpossible citation of Francis’s poem in v. 117—see note to that verse, below),the meaning would seem to be that Dante’s extraordinary voyage into theafterworld will uniquely separate him, if only temporarily, from the world ofthe living while he is still alive. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s09-e]/ Italian [part0017.html#c01-s09-i]]30. [part0009.html#c01-s10-e] It seems likely that the words are meant bothliterally and figuratively: Dante, sorely beset by his fatigue and probably byhis fear as well, is inching up the slope toward the hill by planting his bottomfoot firm and pushing off it to advance the higher one. As Filippo Villani wasfirst to note, there is a Christian tradition for such a difficult progresstoward one’s goal, found precisely in St. Augustine, who for a long timeremained a catechumen before he chose his life in Christ (Bell.1989.1, p. 109).John Freccero formed a similar opinion. According to his article “Dante’s FirmFoot and the Journey without a Guide” (1959, reprinted in Frec.1986.1), Dantemoves forward with the right foot, representing intellect, supported by the leftfoot, representing will. Freccero goes on to show that the resultant figurationis one of homo claudus, a limping man, wounded in both his feet by Adam’s sin.[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s10-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c01-s10-i]]32–54. [part0009.html#c01-s11-e] The lonza (a hybrid born of leopard and lion)is the first of the three beasts to move against Dante as he attempts to mountthe hill. Commentators frequently point to a biblical source for Dante’s threebeasts, the passage in Jeremiah (5:6) that describes three wild animals (lion,wolf, and “pard” [a leopard or panther]) that will fall upon Jerusalemitesbecause of their transgressions and backsliding. For an extensive review of theproblem see Gaetano Ragonese, “fiera,” ED (vol. 2, 1970, with bibliographythrough 1969).The early commentators are strikingly in accord; for them the beasts signify (1)three of the seven mortal sins: lust, pride, and avarice. Modern interpretersmainly—but not entirely, as we shall see—reject this formulation. One of theseinterpretations is based on Inferno VI. 75, the three “sparks” that have litevil fires in the hearts of contemporary Florentines, according to Ciacco, whois seconded by Brunetto Latini [Inf. XV. 68]): (2) envy, pride, and avarice.Others suggest that the key is found at Inferno XI. 81–82, where, describing theorganization of the punishment of sin, Virgil speaks of (3) “the threedispositions Heaven opposes, incontinence, malice, and mad brutishness.” Evenwithin this approach there are strong disagreements as to which beast representswhich Aristote-lian/Ciceronian category of sin: is the leopard fraud orincontinence? is the she-wolf incontinence or fraud? (the lion is seen by allthose of this “school” as violence). For instance, some have asked, if theleopard is fraud, the worst of the three dispositions to sin, why is it thebeast that troubles Dante the least? A possible answer is that fraud is thedisposition least present in Dante.Perhaps the single passage in the text of Inferno that identifies one of thethree beasts in such a way as to leave little doubt about its referentialityoccurs in XVI. 106–108, where Dante tells us that he was wearing a cord that heonce used in his attempt to capture the beast with “the painted pelt.” That thiscord is used as a challenge to Geryon, the guardian of the pit of Fraud, makesit seem nearly necessary that in this passage the leopard is meant to signifyFraud. If that is true, it would seem also necessary that the lion would standfor Violence and the she-wolf for Incontinence. The last formulation is thetrickiest to support. The she-wolf is mainly associated, in the poem, not somuch with Incontinence as with avarice (e.g., Purg. XX. 10–15). Thus Dantepresents himself as most firm against Fraud, less firm against Violence, andweak when confronted by Incontinence. In his case the sin of Incontinence thatafflicts him most is lust, not avarice.There are few passages in the poem that have generated as much discussion and aslittle common understanding. Now see Gorni’s extended discussion (Gorn. 1995.1,pp. 23–55).The formulation of the early commentators ([1] lust, pride, and avarice) has hada resurgence in our time. It would certainly be pleasing to have reason toassent to their nearly unanimous understanding. Mazzoni (Mazz. 1967.1. pp.99–102) has given, basing his argument on texts found in the Bible and in thewritings of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church, good reason for returning tothis view. If it were not for Inferno XVI. 106–108, it would be a fairlyconvincing argument. However, that passage seems unalterably to associate Geryonwith the lonza.It should also be noted that a number of still other modern interpreters haveproposed various political identities for the three beasts, perhaps the mostpopular being (4) the leopard as Dante’s Florentine enemies, the lion as theroyal house of France, the she-wolf as the forces of the papacy. It is difficultto align such a view with the details in the text, which seem surely to bepointing to a moral rather than a political view of the situation of theprotagonist as the poem begins.For an extended discussion of the problem in English see Cassell (Cass. 1989.2),pp. 45–76.

[part0009.html#c01-s19-e] Dante’s second simile in the canto turns fromthe semantic field of epic and perilous adventure to the more mundane but notmuch less perilous activity of the merchant or the gambler, his financial lifehanging in the balance as he awaits news of an arriving ship or the throw of thedice—just at that moment at which his stomach sinks in the sudden awareness thathe has in fact, and unthinkably, lost.

IV.vii.9: “La via … de li malvagi è oscura.Elli non sanno dove rovinano” (The path of the wicked is a dark one. They do notknow where they are rushing).

[part0009.html#c01-s21-e] Dante’s phrasing that describes Virgil’sappearance to the protagonist (“dinanzi a li occhi mi si fu offerto”) remindedTommaseo (commentary to Inf. I.62) of the phrasing that describes Venus’sappearance to her son, Aeneas, when the latter is intent on killing Helen inorder to avenge the harm done to Troy by the Greek surprise attack within thewalls of the city: “mihi se … ante ocul[o]s … obtulit” (she offered herself tomy eyes).

[part0009.html#c01-s21-e] Both Brugnoli (Brug.1981.1) and Hollander(Holl.1983.1, pp. 23–79) independently agree on most of the key elements in thispuzzling verse: fioco is to be taken as visual rather than aural; silenzio isunderstood as deriving from the Virgilian sense of the silence of the deadshades (e.g., Aen. VI.264: umbrae silentes). It is fair also to say that neitherdeals convincingly with the adjective lungo. How can one see that a “silence” isof long duration? A recent intervention by Casagrande (Casa.1997.1, pp. 246–48)makes a strong case for interpreting the adjective lungo as here meaning “vast,extensive,” having a spatial reference. In his reading the verse would mean “whoappeared indistinct in the vast silence”; our translation reflects Casagrande’sview.

[part0009.html#c01-s22-e] Dante’s first spoken word as character in hisown poem is Latin (Miserere, “Have mercy”). This is the language of the Church,the first word of the fiftieth Psalm (50:1). Thus our hero is identified as ason of the Church—albeit a currently failing one—at the outset of the work. Ithas also been pointed out that, typically enough, this first utterance made bythe protagonist involves a double citation, the first biblical, the secondclassical, Aeneas’s speech to his mother, Venus (Aen. I.327–330).That Dante is trying to ascertain whether Virgil is a shade or a living soulhelps interpret v. 63, i.e., he looks as though he is alive, and yet somehownot.

[part0009.html#c01-s22-e] Alessio and Villa (Ales.1993.1) offer animportant consideration of Dante’s debt to the traditional classical andmedieval “lives of the poets” in formulating his own brief vita Virgilii in thispassage. Among other things, such a view undercuts the argument of thoseinterpreters who try to make Virgil an “allegory” of reason. He is presented asa real person with a real history and is thoroughly individuated. No one couldmistake the details of this life for that of another, and no one has.

In what sense are we to take the phrase sub Iulio? What is theimplicit subject of the verb fosse? What is the precise meaning of tardi(“late”)? Virgil was born in 70 B.C., Julius died in 44 B.C., and Virgil died in19 B.C. Hardly any two early commentators have the same opinion about thisverse. Has Dante made a mistake about the date of Julius’s governance? Or doessub Iulio only mean “in the days of Julius”? Was Virgil’s birth too late for himto be honored by Julius? Or does the clause indicate that, although he was bornlate in pagan times, it was still too early for him to have heard ofChristianity? The most usual contemporary reading is perhaps well stated inPadoan’s commentary to this verse: the Latin phrase is only meant to indicateroughly the time of Julius, and nothing more specific than that; when Juliusdied, Virgil was only twenty-six and had not begun his poetic career, which wasthus to be identified with Augustus, rather than with Julius.

[part0009.html#c01-s25-e] The word poeta is one of the most potent wordsin Dante’s personal vocabulary of honor and esteem.

At this first appearance of Virgil’s name inDante’s text (it will appear thirty times more) it is probably worth noting thatDante’s spelling of the name is not only his, but a widespread medievalidiosyncrasy.

[part0009.html#c01-s28-e] For the lofty resonance of the word volume inthe Comedy (as compared with libro, another and lesser word for “book”) seeHoll.1969.1, pp. 78–79. The Bible is the only other book so referred to. Twoother words that usually refer to God’s divine authority are also each used onceto refer to Virgil or his writing: autore (Inf. I.85) and scrittura (Purg.VI.34). [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s28-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c01-s28-i]]86–87. [part0009.html#c01-s29-e] There has been much discussion of exactlywhat the “noble style” is and where it is to be found in Dante’s work. The styleis the “high style” or “tragic style” found in Virgil and other classical poetsand was achieved by Dante in his odes (three of which are collected inConvivio), as he himself indicated in De vulgari eloquentia (see Dve II.vi.7).Dante’s formulation here goes further, making Virgil his sole source. His laterinteractions with other poets in hell (e.g., Pier delle Vigne [Inf. XIII],Brunetto Latini [Inf. XV]) or relatives of poets (Cavalcante [Inf. X]) show thatnot one of them is interested in the identity of Dante’s guide, a fact thatreflects directly on the poems left by these three practitioners, which aremarkedly without sign of Virgilian influence. Thus, not only is Virgil Dante’ssole source for the “noble style,” but Dante portrays himself as Virgil’s solefollower among the recent and current poets of Italy. Perhaps more than anyother claim for a literary identity, this sets him apart from them. For Dante’scomplicated relationship with his poetic precursors see Barolini (Baro.1984.1).[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s29-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c01-s29-i]]100–105. [part0009.html#c01-s34-e] In a canto filled with passages that havecalled forth rivers of commentators’ ink, perhaps none has resulted in so muchinterpretive excitement as this one. While our commentary always followsPetrocchi’s text of the poem, even when we are in disagreement, we should saythat here we are in disagreement. We would capitalize the two nouns “Feltro” and“Feltro,” so that they would indicate place names in northern Italy. The personin Dante’s mind would then be Cangrande della Scala, the youthful general of thearmies of Verona when Dante first visited that city ca. 1304. In that case, whatwe would deal with here is the first of three (see also Purg. XXXIII.37–45, Par.XXVII.142–148) “world-historical” prophecies of the coming of a political figure(in the last two surely an emperor) who, in his advent, also looks forward tothe Second Coming of Christ. For an excellent review of the entire problem seeC. T. Davis, “veltro,” ED (vol. 5, 1976). For the notion that there is indeed aVirgilian (and imperial) source for Dante’s prophecy in the prediction ofAugustan rule in Aeneid I.286–296 see Holl.1969.1, pp. 90–91.

III.522–523), as has been frequently noted. Some haveargued that, in Dante, the words have a moral tint, mainly contending that thereference is to Italy’s current lowly political condition. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s36-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c01-s36-i]]107–108. [part0009.html#c01-s36-e] The curious intermingling of enemies(Camilla and Turnus fought against the Trojan invaders, Euryalus and Nisus withthem) helps establish Dante’s sense that Aeneas’s Italian war was a necessaryand just one, its victims as though sacrificed for the cause of establishingRome, the “new Troy.” For the centrality of Rome in Dante’s thought see thevolume of the late Charles Till Davis (Davi.1957.1), still the essential studyof this important subject. [return to English [part0009.html#c01-s36-e] /Italian [part0017.html#c01-s36-i]]109–111. [part0009.html#c01-s37-e] Mazzoni (Mazz.1967.1, pp. 137–38) arguesstrongly for the interpretation of prima as an adjective modifying invidia, andthus for a phrase meaning “primal envy,” when death entered the created worldprecisely because of Satan’s envy (see Wisdom 2:24: “Through envy of the devilcame death into the world.”). He notes the resulting parallel between this lineand Inf. III.6, where God is, in His third person, “Primo Amore” (Primal Love).[return to English [part0009.html#c01-s37-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c01-s37-i]]117. [part0009.html#c01-s39-e] The possibilities for interpreting this verseare various. The “second death” may refer to what the sinners are suffering now(in which case they cry out either for a cessation in their pain—a “death” ofit—or against their condition) or it may refer to the “death” they will sufferat the end of time in Christ’s final Judgment (in which case they may either becrying out for that finality or against that horrifying prospect). Mazzoni(Mazz.1967.1, p. 143) was perhaps the first to hear an echo here (now heard byseveral others) of v. 31 of St. Francis’s “Laudes creaturarum” (for an earlierpossible citation of that poem see note to v. 27): “ka la morte secunda no ’lfarrà male” (the good soul, liberated by death, hopes that it will not suffereternal damnation at the Last Judgment). Thus, while the question remains adifficult one, the best hypothesis probably remains Mazzoni’s (Mazz.1967.1, pp.139–45): the sinners are crying out in fear of the punishments to come after theLast Judgment.

[part0009.html#c01-s41-e] Virgil’s self-description as unworthy mayreflect a similar self-description, that of John the Baptist. See John 1:27 andrelated discussion in Holl.1983.1, pp. 63, 71–73. In this formulation Virgil isto Beatrice as John was to Christ. For an earlier moment in Dante’s writing thatis based on exactly such a typological construction, one in which GuidoCavalcanti’s Giovanna/John the Baptist is portrayed as the “forerunner” toDante’s Beatrice/Christ, see VN XXIV.3–4. [return to English[part0009.html#c01-s41-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c01-s41-i]]125. [part0009.html#c01-s42-e] It is fair to say that most commentators dodgethis troublesome word. How could Virgil have been a “rebel” against a God he didnot know? We should remember that this formulation is Virgil’s own and maysimply reflect his present sense of what he should have known when he was alive.That is, Virgil may be exaggerating his culpability.

[part0009.html#c01-s45-e] Dante has apparently understood clearlyenough that Virgil will lead him through hell and purgatory, but not paradise.Having read the poem, we know that Beatrice will assume the role of guide forthe first nine heavens. Virgil seems to know this (see vv. 122–123), but notDante, who seems to be aware only that some soul will take up the role of Virgilwhen his first guide leaves him.

[part0009.html#c02-s01-e] Against the common opinion (as it exists eventoday, most recently exhibited by Merc.1998.1) that the first two cantos performseparate functions (e.g., I = prologue to the poem as a whole, II = prologue tothe first cantica), Wilkins (Wilk.1926.1) argues, on the basis of discussion ofthe defining characteristics of prologues found in the Epistle to Cangrande(Epist. XIII.43–48), that Cantos I and II form a unitary prologue to the entirepoem as well as to its first cantica (or “canticle”). This reader finds hiscomments just and convincing. In actuality, all three cantiche begin withtwo-canto-long prologues containing an invocation, some narrated action, andpresentation of details that prepare the reader for what is to follow furtheralong in the poem.For the structural parallels that also tend to merge the two cantos into asingle entity see Holl.1990.2, p. 97: [return to English[part0009.html#c02-s01-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c02-s01-i]]Inferno I Inferno II 1–27 Dante’s peril 1–42 Dante’s uncertainty simile (22–27)simile (37–40) 28–60 three beasts 43–126 three blessed ladies simile (55–58)simile (127–130) 61–136 Virgil’s assurances 127–142 Dante’s will firmed1–3. [part0009.html#c02-s01-e] The precise Virgilian text that lies behindDante’s generically “Virgilian” opening flourish is debated. (Major candidatesinclude Aen. III.147, Aen. IV.522–528, Aen. VIII.26–27, Aen. IX.224–225, Georg.I.427–428. See discussion in Mazz.1967.1, pp. 165–66.) These three lines, as hasoften been noted, have a sad eloquence that establishes a mode of writing towhich the poet will return when he considers the Virgilian “tears of things” inthe lives of some of his characters. [return to English[part0009.html#c02-s01-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c02-s01-i]]3. [part0009.html#c02-s01-e] The protagonist, about to descend into hell, isdescribed, perhaps surprisingly, since he is in the company of Virgil, as beingalone (“sol uno”). But see Conv. IV.xxvi.9, where Dante describes Aeneas, aboutto begin his descent ad inferos, similarly as being “alone”: “… when Aeneasprepared, alone with the Sibyl [solo con Sibilla], to enter the underworld.” InDante’s view, it would seem that the condition of a mortal soul, about to enterthe underworld, is one of loneliness, even though it is accompanied by a shade.See Holl.1993.1, p. 256. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s01-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c02-s01-i]]4–5. [part0009.html#c02-s02-e] This formulation perhaps refers to the struggleof the protagonist with the difficulties of proceeding (his struggles withfearsome exterior forces ranged against him, from the previously-encounteredthree beasts in the first canto to Satan in the last) and with his own interiorweakness, demonstrated by his occasional surrender to the emotion of pity(beginning with Francesca in the fifth canto and ending when he does not yieldto Ugolino’s entreaties for his pity in the thirty-third). For a possiblefive-part program that marks the development of the protagonist’s strength, ashe moves through five cycles of pity and fear in hell, see Holl.1969.1, pp.301–7. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s02-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c02-s02-i]]6. [part0009.html#c02-s02-e] In the words of Singleton’s gloss, “Memory willnow faithfully retrace the real event of the journey, exactly as it took place.This most extraordinary journey through the three realms of the afterlife isrepresented, never as dreamed or experienced in vision, but as a realhappening.… Here, then, and in the following invocation, the poet’s voice isheard for the first time as it speaks of his task as poet.” [return to English[part0009.html#c02-s02-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c02-s02-i]]7–9. [part0009.html#c02-s03-e] The passage including the poem’s firstinvocation is challenging and has caused serious interpretive difficulty. Whydoes Dante invoke the Muses in a Christian work? What does alto ingegno (loftygenius) refer to? Is the invocation of two powers (“Muses” and “lofty genius”)or of three (the mente, or “memory,” of verse 8)? For a discussion of thesepoints see Holl.1990.2, pp. 98–100, arguing that the “muses” are the devices ofpoetic making that the individual poet may master, that the “lofty genius” isnot Dante’s, but God’s, and that only these two elements are invoked, while“mente” is merely put forward as having been effective in recording the facts ofthe journey (and is surely not “invoked,” as the very language of the passagemakes plain). In this formulation, here and in some of his later invocationsDante is asking for divine assistance in conceptualizing the matter of his poemso that it may resemble his Creator, its source, while also asking for the helpof the “muses” in finding the most appropriate expressive techniques for thatconceptualization. As for the raw content, that he has through his ownexperience; he requires no external aid for it. What he does need is conceptualand expressive power, alto ingegno and the poetic craft represented by the“muses.”It is, given Dante’s fondness for the number of Beatrice, nine, difficult tobelieve that the fact that there are nine invocations in the poem may beaccidental (see Holl.1976.2). For perhaps the first reckoning that accounts forall nine invocations see Fabb.1910.1. It is curious that few commentators havenoted the fact that there are, in fact, nine invocations (and only nine) in thepoem. They are as follows: Inf. II.7, XXXII.10–12; Purg. I.7–12, XXIX.37–42;Par. I.13–21, XVIII.83–88, XXII.112–123, XXX.97–99, XXXIII.67–75. [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c02-s03-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c02-s03-i]]10. [part0009.html#c02-s04-e] This verse begins a series of conversations thatgive the canto its shape. With the exception of the eleventh Canto, 92 percentof which is devoted to dialogue (mainly Virgil’s explanations of the circles ofhell, joined by Dante’s responses and questions), no other Infernal cantocontains so much dialogue, with 118 of its 142 verses being spoken (83 percent).These conversations form a chiasmus (from the Greek chi, our letter ‘x’), thedevice of shaping the parts of a text into a perfectly balanced pattern (seeHoll.1990.2, p. 100):1. Dante (10–36) 2. Virgil (43–57) 3. Beatrice (58–74) 4. Virgil (75–84) 5. Beatrice (85–114) 6. Virgil (115–126)7.

[part0009.html#c02-s04-e] The meaning of the phrase alto passo is debated.See Mazz.1967.1, pp. 180–84, for documentation. Mazzoni gives good reasons foraccepting a literal reading, one that makes the passo correspond to the journey,rather than, as some have proposed, a metaphorical one, in which it signifiesthe poem. Mazzoni paraphrases these words with the phrase “impresa eccezionale”(extraordinary undertaking), while also stressing the difficulty of thatadventure. Our translation seeks a similar solution.

[part0009.html#c02-s05-e] In his commentary Padoan points out that theinsistence on the physicality of Aeneas’s descent effectively undercuts thattradition of medieval allegorized Virgil which asserts that the “descent” is tobe taken as a “philosophical,” rather than as a literal, journey. Aeneas’sjourney, like Dante’s own, is to be dealt with as actually having occurred inspace and time. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s05-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c02-s05-i]]16–19. [part0009.html#c02-s06-e] For the commentators, the most troublingaspect of a difficult tercet is found in the phrase “e ’l chi e ’l quale”(“considering who and what he was,” v. 18—see Mazzoni, pp. 192–96). The sense,however, may be fairly straightforward: it is not surprising that God shouldhave chosen Aeneas to found Rome, with its profound impact on human history,both imperial and ecclesiastical, since Aeneas (the “who” of the verse) was boththe founder of a royal line (ancestor of Julius Caesar through Ascanius) and“divine” (the “what,” since he was the son of a goddess, Venus).Dante uses the word “cortese” (courteous, i.e., as in the favoring generosity ofa lord or lady) in v. 17 in a way that theologizes its usual courtly context.For the tradition of the concept as it comes into Dante see Crim.1993.1. [returnto English [part0009.html#c02-s06-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c02-s06-i]]20–21. [part0009.html#c02-s07-e] The adjective alma (here translated as“holy”) has had various interpretations in the commentary tradition, e.g.,“exalted” (eccelsa: Boccaccio), “lofty” (alta: Buti), “nurturing” (alma:Landino), “holy” (sancta: Benvenuto). Citing Paget Toynbee, Mazzoni(Mazz.1967.1), p. 198, makes a strong argument for the last of these. Ourtranslation reflects his view. And this formulation knits up these two tercetsinto a single meaning: Aeneas was chosen by God to be the founder of imperialand ecclesiastical Rome. Such a view disturbs those who believe that Dante, whenhe began the Comedy, was still a Guelph (i.e., a supporter of the papacy) in hispolitical attitudes and not a Ghibelline (a supporter of the empire). A readingof the fourth book of Convivio (Mazzoni [Mazz.1967.1], pp. 216–20), demonstratesthe close correspondence between what Dante says here and what he had said inConvivio IV, iv-v. There he had already made a decisive shift toward recognizingthe importance of what we would call “secular Rome.” Dante, as the prophecy ofthe veltro (depending on one’s interpretation of it) may already havedemonstrated, now believes in the divine origin and mission of the empire. Seenote to Inf. I.100–105. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s07-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c02-s07-i]]22–24. [part0009.html#c02-s08-e] See Mazzoni (Mazz.1967.1), pp. 198–220, for athorough review of this tercet, made problematic not because its words or thesense of these words is difficult, but because what it says is assumed by manycommentators to be premature in its championing of the empire, a position Danteis supposed to have embraced only later. See the preceding note. For a recentattempt to describe the political aspect of the poem see Hollander(Holl.2000.1), the section, in the discussion devoted to the Commedia, entitled“La politica.” [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s08-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c02-s08-i]]26. [part0009.html#c02-s09-e] Aeneas understood things from what was revealedto him in the underworld, most notably by his father, Anchises (see Mazz.1967.1,p. 222).

These five tercets continually break Aeneas’sidentity or task into two aspects (“e ’l chi e ’l quale” [who and what he was—v.18], “de l’alma Roma e di suo impero” [holy Rome and her dominion—v. 20], “laquale e ’l quale” [both of these established—v. 22], “di sua vittoria e delpapale ammanto” [to victory and … the papal mantle—v. 27]). This speech is notin the mouth of Virgil, but of Dante, and for a reason. It purveys, with someheated enthusiasm, the view of Roman imperial excellence that Dante had onlyrecently developed. He cannot allow its religious dimension authoritativeutterance by Virgil, whose credentials as “Christian” are not exactly imposing.And so the otherwise not-very-mature protagonist is here given the author’svoice to say what that author wants most definitely to set down before us.[return to English [part0009.html#c02-s09-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c02-s09-i]]28. [part0009.html#c02-s09-e] For Paul as the Vas d’elezïone (Chosen Vessel)see Acts 9:15. For his ascent to heaven while still alive see II Cor. 12:4.This flat statement that Paul’s journey actually occurred contrasts with theless forthright claim made for Aeneas’s in verse 13: “Tu dici che” (You tellthat). This and the subsequent phrasing, in which that same journey is referredto as the “andata onde li dai tu vanto” (journey for which you grant him glory)at v. 25, both imbue the speaker’s acceptance of the veracity of Virgil’saccount of that journey with a certain sense of dubiety (see Holl.1990.2, p.103), at least when compared with the biblical authority enjoyed by Paul’s.With regard to the question of whether or not Dante believed Paul had been tohell (as recounted in the Visio Pauli) see Padoan’s comment, with bibliography(to which now should be added Silv.1997.1). Most commentators would seem tobelieve that Dante is here alluding only to Paul’s heavenly journey, not to hisapocryphal descent.

What the protagonist says is not what hisauthor thinks: Dante is to be understood as both the “new Aeneas” and the “newPaul.” Jacoff and Stephany offer an ample deliberation on this subject(Jaco.1989.1), pp. 57–72.

[part0009.html#c02-s11-e] Dante’s apparent modesty is obviously meantto be taken rather as cowardice, as Virgil’s response at v. 45 (“your spirit isassailed by cowardice”) makes pellucidly clear.

[part0009.html#c02-s14-e] For the importance of the word impresa(enterprise) in the overall economy of the poem see Holl.1969.1, p. 230. Itoccurs twice in this canto (next at v. 47), where it refers to Dante’s journey,then in Inf. XXXII.7, where it refers to the poem that Dante is writing, andfinally in Par.

[part0009.html#c02-s15-e] This is the first occurrence of the word “word”(parola) in the poem and in this canto. It will reappear four more times in thecanto at vv. 67, 111, 135, and 137. If, as several commentators have urged (seeHoll.1990.2, p. 96), the first Canto of the poem is the “canto della paura”(canto of fear—the word paura appears five times [see note to canto I.15], asdoes parola in this one, and neither appears so many times in any other canto),then Inferno II perhaps should be construed as the ‘canto della parola’ (cantoof the word).

[part0009.html#c02-s18-e] The verbal adjective sospesi (suspended), thatis, in a position between the presence of God and actual punishment, is atechnical term for the virtuous heathen who dwell in Limbo.

[part0009.html#c02-s18-e] Beatrice’s anonymous first appearance andVirgil’s instinctive obeisance might easily lead a reader to assume that thislady has primarily an “allegorical” meaning. For a recent study of the roots ofthe problematic allegorical interpretation of Beatrice see Porc.1997.2. We willin time be told who she is (Inf. II.70). Dante’s first extended work, Vita nuova(ca. 1293), celebrated his lady, Beatrice, as a mortal woman unlike any other,her meaning indissolubly linked with the Trinity, and in particular with theSecond Person, Christ. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s18-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c02-s18-i]]56–57. [part0009.html#c02-s19-e] Virgil describes Beatrice’s speech as beingsoave e piana (gentle and clear). She will, in turn, describe his speech asparola ornata (polished words—at v. 67). The two adjectives, piana and ornata,may remind us of a major distinction, found in medieval categorizations ofrhetorical styles, between the plain, or low, style, and the ornate, or high.Benvenuto, commenting on this passage, was the first to point this out, glossing“soave e piana” as follows: “divine speech is sweet and humble, not elevated andproud, as is that of Virgil and the poets.” Thus Virgil’s description ofBeatrice’s words corresponds antithetically to hers of his; her speechrepresents the sublimely humble style valorized by the Comedy, while his recallsthe high style that marked pagan eloquence (the observation is drawn fromHoll.1990.2, p. 107, where there are references to previous discussions inAuer.1958.1, pp. 65–66; Mazz.1979.1, pp. 157–58).

[part0009.html#c02-s20-e] Beatrice’s first words, which Daniello(commentary to this verse) compared to Juno’s attempt to win over Aeolus atAeneid I.66–67, offer a striking example of captatio benevolentiae, therhetorical device of gaining favor with one’s audience. They will be effectiveenough in gaining Virgil’s goodwill. And, despite Virgil’s characterization ofher speech, in v. 56, as being “gentle and clear,” it is also unmistakably loftyin its rhetorical reach.

[part0009.html#c02-s21-e] For a consideration of the fullest implicationsof this verse see Mazzoni (Mazz.1967.1), pp. 256–68. According to him, theliteral sense is that Dante is not a friend to Fortune, not that Fortune hasforsaken him. The upshot of these readings is that Beatrice makes Dante herfriend in true spiritual friendship, denying that he is “friendly” to Fortune.[return to English [part0009.html#c02-s21-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c02-s21-i]]62–64.

[part0009.html#c02-s25-e] Beatrice’s promise to speak well of Virgil toGod has drawn some skeptical response, e.g., Castelvetro on this verse: “Questoche monta a Virgilio che è dannato?” (What good is this to Virgil, who isdamned?). We are probably meant to be more impressed than that. [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c02-s25-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c02-s25-i]]76–78.

Singleton, in his comment onthis verse, speaks of the “strong pejorative connotation” of Dante’s phrase,stemming from “the well-established view that the earth’s position at the centerof the universe is the most ignoble—because it is farthest from God and Hisangels.” Singleton goes on to cite from a sermon of Fra Giordano da Rivalto,characterizing the true center of the earth as “that point within the earthwhich is in its midst, as the core is in the midst of an apple.

[part0009.html#c02-s29-e] Beatrice’s insistence that she is not“touchable” by the grim powers of the pains of hell underlines the marginalityof sin for the saved. Hell is simply not of concern to them. It is important toknow, as one begins reading the poem, what one can only know once one hasfinished it: no soul in purgation or in grace in heaven has a thought for thecondition of the damned (only the damned themselves do). Their concern for thosewho do not share their redeeming penitence or bliss is reserved for those stillalive on earth, who have at least the hope of salvation. Hell, for the saved, isa sordid reality of which it is better not to speak. [return to English[part0009.html#c02-s29-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c02-s29-i]]94.

[part0009.html#c02-s33-e] Lucy, the martyred Syracusan virgin (fourthcentury), whose name itself associates her with light, obviously played aspecial role in Dante’s devotional life. She will reappear in Purg. IX.52–63,where she indeed carries Dante from the valley in which he sleeps in theante-purgatory to the gate of purgatory itself; and then she is seen seated inblessedness (Par. XXXII.137–138). See the discussion in Jacoff and Stephany(Jaco.1989.1), pp. 29–38. [return to English [part0009.html#c02-s33-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c02-s33-i]]102 [part0009.html#c02-s34-e]. Rachel, the fourth lady indicated as dwelling inheaven, presented here as Beatice’s “neighbor,” is traditionally interpreted (asshe is by Dante himself—see Purg. XXVII.94–108) as the contemplative life, asher sister Leah represents the active one. Since the fourteenth century therehave been frequent (and widely varying) attempts to “allegorize” the Virgin,Lucy, and Beatrice, most often as various varieties of grace (see Padoan’scommentary to v. 97 for a brief summary). There is no textual basis for suchefforts, as appealing as many readers apparently find them. [return to English[part0009.html#c02-s34-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c02-s34-i]]105. [part0009.html#c02-s35-e] What exactly does it mean, Lucy’s insistence toBeatrice that, for her sake, Dante “left the vulgar herd” (la volgare schiera)?Guido da Pisa interprets the phrase to mean Dante turned from the study of theliberal arts to theology. Without debating such a judgment, one might add apoetic dimension to it, as has Francesco Mazzoni (Mazz.1967.1, pp. 289–93).According to him, the most important meaning of the verse is to reflect Dante’sturning from a “conventional” amorous poetic subject matter to what he willlater call the “dolce stil novo” (Purg. XXIV.57), a poetry that presents, in anew “style,” the higher meaning of Beatrice. (Some would go further, still, andsuggest that this meaning is essentially Christological—see Holl.1999.1.)Mazzoni’s view is seconded by the importance of the word volgare to Dante. Whileit is surely at times limited to the negative sense of the Latin vulgus,pertaining to the common people, the “mob,” it is also the word that he uses todescribe his own vernacular speech, as in the title of his treatise De vulgarieloquentia (“On Eloquence in the Vernacular”).The view that Dante’s sense of his own poetic vocation is central to the meaningof this verse is supported by the text at Inf. IV.101, where the group ofclassical poets, who so graciously include Dante in their number, is alsodescribed as a schiera (company).

[part0009.html#c02-s36-e] As tormented a passage as may be found inthis canto, and one of the most difficult in the entire work, whether for itsliteral sense (what “death”? what “river”? what “sea”?) or its possibly onlymetaphorical meaning. See Mazzoni’s summary of the centuries-long debate overthe passage (Mazz.1967.1), pp. 294–303, as well as Freccero’s essay (Frec.1986.1[1966]), pp. 55–69. For discussion of a “typological” reading of the passage seeHoll.1990.2, pp. 110–11, associating the narrated action with a temporarilyhalted attempt to enter the River Jordan.For the literal sense in which the Dead Sea is not a “sea,” but a “lake” thatreceives the waters of Jordan see Filippo Villani (Bell.1989.1, p. 109): “And,in the literal sense, the river Jordan does not flow into a sea, but ends in alake that is bright and clear, even pleasant.” [return to English[part0009.html#c02-s36-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c02-s36-i]]109–114. [part0009.html#c02-s37-e] Beatrice concludes her speech by expressingthe efficacy of Lucy’s words on Dante’s behalf, which won her over tointerceding with Virgil in order to give her beloved a second chance.(Purgatorio XXX and XXXI will reveal that she had grounds for being lesscharitable to her backsliding lover.) Her speech concludes with the same sort ofcaptatio benevolentiae that marked its inception at v. 58, now couched in termsthat praise Virgil’s parlare onesto. The phrase means more than “honest speech,”as is made clear by its etymological propinquity to the verb onora (honors) inthe next line. “Noble” (found also in Sinclair’s translation) seemed to thetranslators a reasonable way to attempt to bridge the gap between “honest” and“decorous,” retaining a sense of moral and stylistic gravity for the words ofthe greatest poet of pagan antiquity—which Virgil was for Dante.

Virgil has savedDante from the she-wolf; why has his pupil not been more ready to follow him?And now there is the further evidence of the three heavenly ladies who have alsointerceded on Dante’s behalf, thus giving confirmation of the justness of whatVirgil had sketched as a plan for Dante’s journey (Inf.

[part0009.html#c03-s01-e] Modern editions vary in using capital orlower-case letters for this inscription over the gate of hell. Lacking Dante’sautograph MS, we can only conjecture. For the view that the model for thesewords is found in the victorious inscriptions found on Roman triumphal arches,sculpted in capital letters in stone, see Holl.1969.1, p. 300. In this viewevery condemned sinner is being led back captive to “that Rome of which Christis Roman” (Purg.

[part0009.html#c03-s01-e] For the city as the poem’s centering image ofpolitical life, the hellish earthly city, resembling Florence, “which stands forthe self and against the common good,” and the heavenly city, an idealized viewof imperial Rome, see Ferrante (Ferr.1984.1), pp. 41–42.

Dante’sapparently theologically incorrect statement shows the importance of his senseof justice as the central force in the universe, so encompassing that it may beseen as, in a sense, God’s “muse,” as well as the primary subject of the poem.The word in its noun form appears fully thirty-five times in the poem (seeHoll.1992.1, pp. 40–41).

[part0009.html#c03-s02-e] The three attributes of the Trinity—Power,Wisdom, and Love—are nearly universally recognized as informing these twoverses. Hell is of God’s making, not an independent “city” of rebels, but atotally dependent polis of those who had rebelled against their maker. For thepostbiblical concept of the Trinity, especially as it was advanced in St.Augustine’s De Trinitate, where Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is each identifiedby one of these attributes, respectively, see G. Fallani, “Trinità” (ED, vol. 5,1976, pp. 718–21). [return to English [part0009.html#c03-s02-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c03-s02-i]]7–8. [part0009.html#c03-s03-e] The apparent difficulty of these verses(perhaps reflected in Dante’s difficulty in understanding the writing over thegate, Inf. III.12) is resolved once we understand that here “eternal” is used tomean “sempiternal,” that is, as having had a beginning in time but lasting everafter. Only God, who is not created but all-creating, may be considered eternal.See Mazz.1967.1, pp. 331–36. Mazzoni, in agreement with B. Nardi (Nard.1959.1),p. 17, allows this status to three classes of being: angels, prime matter (thatis, the potential form of the as yet uncreated world), and the heavenly spheres.For Matthew’s description of Christ’s Judgment of the damned see Matth. 25:41,46: “Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, yecursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels … And theseshall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.”[return to English [part0009.html#c03-s03-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c03-s03-i]]10. [part0009.html#c03-s04-e] Are the letters of these words “dark in hue,” asare the inset carvings over actual gates, begrimed by time (or, as some earlycommentators urged, because they are hellishly menacing)? Or are theyrhetorically difficult, and “dark” in that respect? The phrase “rhetoricalcolors” to indicate the rhetor’s stylistic techniques is familiar from classicalrhetoric and is found in Dante’s Vita nuova, e.g., VN XXV.7; XXV.10. Whicheverunderstanding one chooses, one will have to make a decision consonant with aninterpretation of verse 12, below.

[part0009.html#c03-s04-e] There is a fairly serious disagreement over themost probable interpretation of the words “for me their meaning is hard.” Ourtranslation tries to reflect both possibilities, suggesting that one is clearlypresent, while the second may be only latent. Are the words over the gate ofhell (1) threatening to Dante? Or (2) are they hard for him to understand? Itseems clear that the traveler is frightened by the dire advice tendered in verse9, which would have him abandon all hope. Mazzoni (Mazz.1967.1), pp. 337–42,offers a lengthy gloss to this tercet. It seems impossible not to accept hisbasic premise, namely that the context of the scene makes the meaning immediateand moral: the traveler is afraid, and Virgil reproves him for his fear (vv.14–15).

[part0009.html#c03-s05-e] The phrase “as one who understood” lendsVirgil authority in two regards: he is aware of Dante’s moral shortcomings andhe understands the underworld, since he has descended once before (see Inf.IX.22–27, XXI.63).

[part0009.html#c03-s08-e] This first sense impression of the underworldis exclusively aural. We are probably meant to understand that Dante’s eyes arenot yet accustomed to the darkness of hell. Cf.

[part0009.html#c03-s08-e] This first instance of Dante’s weeping is partof a program of the protagonist’s development in hell, in which he (very)gradually overcomes the twin temptations to weep for or feel fear at thesituation of the sinners in Inferno.

[part0009.html#c03-s09-e] The adjective diverse here means either“different the one from the other” (on the model of the confused languagesspoken after the construction of the Tower of Babel) or “strange,” a meaning forthe adjective frequently found in Dante. In our translation we have tried toallow for both meanings. Mazzoni (Mazz.1967.1), p. 348, cites v. 123 as furtherevidence for the first interpretation; there those who die in the wrath of God“assemble here from every land,” a phrasing that calls attention to differingnationalities and thus suggests a plurality of tongues.

And, for the existence of exactly such a “vestibule”in hell in the apocryphal Visio Pauli, describing St. Paul’s descent to thenetherworld, see Silverstein (Silv.1937.1). In Paul’s vision (for the mostrecent text see Silv.1997.1) there is a river of flame separating “those whowere neither hot nor cold” (Revelation 3:15–16) from the other sinners.

[part0009.html#c03-s13-e] There has been a lengthy dispute in thecommentary tradition as to whether or not Dante has invented the neutral angelsor is reflecting a medieval tradition that had itself “invented” them (sincethey are not, properly speaking, biblical in origin). This is presented atlength by Mazzoni (Mazz.1967.1), pp. 368–76, who shows that such a tradition didexist and probably helped to shape Dante’s conceptualization. On this problemsee Nardi (Nard.1960.1), pp. 331–50. See also Freccero’s 1960 essay “The NeutralAngels” (Frec.1986.1), pp. 110–18.

The neutral angels (v. 38) arethe antecedent of the pronoun li in vv. 40 and 41. It seems clear that this isalso true with respect to the adjective in v. 42, and thus our translation,“lest on their account the evil angels gloat.” That the adjective is to betreated as an adjectival noun for “the wicked,” i.e., the damned in general, isan idea that has only entered commentaries in our own century.

[part0009.html#c03-s18-e] Dante’s essential technique for indicatingthe crucial moral failures of his various groups of sinners is here before usfor the first time. The neutrals, who never took a side, are portrayed as anorganized crowd following a banner: exactly what they were not in life (e.g.,the neutral angels who neither rebelled directly against God nor stood with Him,but who kept to one side). And in this respect the neutrals are punished bybeing forced to assume a pose antithetic to that which they struck in life. Atthe same time, the banner that they follow is the very essence of indeterminacy.Not only is there no identifying sign on it, it is not held in the anchoringhand of any standard-bearer; it is a parody of the standard raised before a bodyof men who follow a leader. Elsewhere we will encounter other such symbolicartifacts. In Dante’s hell the punishment of sin involves the application ofopposites and similarities. This form of just retribution is what Dante willlater refer to as the contrapasso (Inf. XXVIII.142). [return to English[part0009.html#c03-s18-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c03-s18-i]]58–60. [part0009.html#c03-s20-e] The most-debated passage of this canto, atleast in the modern era. Many of the early commentators were convinced that itclearly intended a biting reference to Pope Celestine V (Pier da Morrone), whoabdicated the papacy in 1294 after having held the office for less than fourmonths. He was followed into it by Dante’s great ecclesiastical enemy, PopeBoniface VIII, and colorful contemporary accounts would have it that Bonifacemimicked the voice of the Holy Spirit in the air passages leading to Celestine’sbedchamber, counseling his abdication. Mazzoni (Mazz.1967.1), pp. 390–415,offers a thorough history of the interpretation of the verse. Two factors led togrowing uneasiness with the identification of Celestine: (1) in 1313 he had beencanonized, (2) ca. 1346 Francesco Petrarca, in his De vita solitaria, haddefended the motives for his abdication. Thus, beginning with the secondredaction of the commentary of Pietro di Dante, certainty that the vileself-recuser was Celestine began to waver. The names of many others have beenproposed, including those of Esau and Pontius Pilate. It seems fair to say thatthere are fatal objections to all of these other candidacies. For strong, evenconvincing, support for that of Celestine see Padoan (Pado.1961.1) and Simonelli(Simo.1993.1), pp. 41–58. Telling objections to Petrocchi’s denial that Dantewould have put the canonized (in 1313) Celestine in hell (Petr.1969.1 [1955],pp. 41–59) are found in Nardi (Nard.1960.1).The word viltà (cowardice) is the very opposite of nobility of character. SeeConvivio IV.xvi.6 for Dante’s own statement of this commonplace: “ ‘nobile’ […]viene da ‘non vile’ ” [“noble” derives from “not vile”]. And we should rememberthat Dante himself has twice been accused by Virgil of viltà because of hiscowardice in not immediately accepting his Heaven-ordained mission (Inf. II.45,II.122).

Now we see that thesebeings, who lacked all inner stimulation, are stung (stimolati) by noxiousinsects. Their tears mix with the blood drawn by these wounds only to serve asfood for worms.

Similarly, the phrase che mai non fur vivi (who never werealive) is darkened by its probable source, cited by several modern commentators(perhaps first by Sapegno) in Rev. 3:1: “Nomen habes quod vivas, et mortuus es”(you have a name that you are alive, and are dead), a fitting castigation forDante to have had in mind for the neutrals.

The exact reasonfor Virgil’s reproof is a matter of some debate. One might argue that his pointis that Dante has gotten ahead of himself. In the first instance, he asked aboutthe nature of those he saw displayed just before him. Now he is anticipating,literally looking ahead, and Virgil warns him against such behavior.

It is fascinating, however, to watch the early commentators, soused to reading any fiction as though it were “allegorical,” “dehistoricizing”Charon. Among the early commentators Charon is variously understood as “fleshlydesire,” “disordered love,” “ancient sinfulness,” “vice,” “time,” etc. It issurely better to understand him first and foremost as himself.

It is a commonplace that the thirdcanto is the most “Virgilian” canto of the Commedia. In fact, study has shownthat it has more than twice as many Virgilian citations than any other canto inthe poem (see Holl.1993.1, pp. 250–51). This double simile has long beenrecognized as involving an amalgam of two Virgilian passages (Aen. VI.309–312and Georg. II.82). It has also been understood as comprising the “controllingsimile” for the entire poem, combining pagan and Christian elements: see thearticle by M. Frankel (Fran.1982.1).

[part0009.html#c03-s45-e] Dante’s falling into unconsciousness indicateshis inability to deal with the overwhelming experience of his crossing into therealm of hell proper, an “inability” apparently shared by the poet, who simplydoes not tell us how he crossed the river. The protagonist will suffer a similarlapse at the conclusion of the fifth canto (Inf. V.142).The question of how Dante crosses Acheron is much debated. The pointed lack ofconcrete reference to how he is transported is a sign either of the poet’sreticence or confusion or of his having set a little problem for his readers. Ithas become acceptable, on the heels of the lengthy gloss offered by Mazzoni(Mazz.1967.1), pp. 452–55, to suggest that the poet has deliberately left theissue unresolved. Yet that does not seem a likely hypothesis. The moment is tooimportant, supported by too many details, to be dealt with as anything less thana problematic mystery that the poet asks us to solve. Mazzoni registers thevarious theories that account for his transporter (Charon, an angel, Virgil,Beatrice, Lucia, some unnamed supernatural force). But see the counteringargument of Hollander (Holl.1984.1), p. 292: We are in fact meant to understandthat it is Charon who takes Dante across and that this crux is entirely theresult of interpretive overexertion that has made the self-evident confusing.Charon indeed does wish to refuse Dante passage in his skiff (vv. 88–93); to hisprotestations Virgil responds as follows (vv. 94–96): “Charon, do not tormentyourself. It is so willed where will and power are one, and ask no more.”Daniello, commenting on these verses, says that Virgil’s words have the sameeffect on Charon that the Sibyl’s display of the golden bough had on him. ForCharon to be able to resist such a command would involve Dante in a theologicalor at least a poetic absurdity. Cf. the similar moment at Inferno V.16–24, whereMinos likewise would resist Dante’s passage through his realm and where Virgilemploys the same incantatory phrase that he had uttered in Canto III to achievethe same result. Would Virgil have uttered the spell again had it not previouslyproved efficacious? That seems a most doubtful proposition. It seems likely thatDante’s reason for not permitting us to witness the first scene being played out(we are given another version of the scene upon which it is modeled a bit laterat Inf. VIII.25–27) is that he found that poetic choice an excessive one, tooself-consciously reminiscent of Aeneas’s fanciful entrance into the underworldfor him to make evident reference to it at this important moment, the thresholdof his Christian afterworld. If this argument has merit, it accounts for thepoet’s reticence on poetic grounds. Dante easily could have told us what hewants us to make ourselves responsible for; but that is not his way. Rather, hemakes us his partners in taking responsibility for such incredible details asthese all through this incredible poem.

[part0009.html#c04-s01-e] The last canto had come to its dramaticconclusion with a shaking of the earth accompanied—indeed perhaps caused by—asupernatural lightning bolt that made Dante fall into a fainting “sleep.” Inmedieval opinion such earthquakes were caused by winds imprisoned in the earth.Now he is awakened by the following thunder. As the last verse of Inferno IIIhas him overcome by sleep (“sonno”), so in the first line of this canto thatsleep is broken, overriding the sharp line of demarcation that a canto ending orbeginning seems to imply, as at the boundary between Inferno II and III.There has been a centuries-long debate over the question of whether this“thunder” (truono), the noise made by the sorrowing damned (v. 9), is the sameas the thunderclap of v. 2 (truono [the reading in most MSS and editions]).Mazzoni (Mazz.1965.1), pp. 45–49, summarizes that debate. It seems best tounderstand that this noise is not the one that awakens Dante, but the one thathe first hears from the inhabitants of Limbo, i.e., that the two identical wordsindicate diverse phenomena.

[part0009.html#c04-s05-e] That, even according to Virgil, who dwells init, the world of Limbo is “blind” might have helped hold in check some of themore enthusiastic readings of this canto as exemplary of Dante’s “humanistic”inclinations. For important discussions along these lines see Mazzoni,Introduzione (Mazz.1965.1), pp. 29–35; Padoan (Pado.1965.1). And see Virgil’sown later “gloss” to Limbo (Purg. VII.25–30), where he describes his punishmentfor not believing in Christ-to-come as consisting in his being denied the sightof the Sun. Dante describes Limbo as being without other punishment than itsdarkness (and indeed here it is described as a “blind world” [cieco mondo]), itsinhabitants as sighing rather than crying out in pain (v. 26). Had he wanted tomake Limbo as positive a place as some of his commentators do, he surely wouldhave avoided, in this verse, the reference to the descent that is necessary toreach it. Such was not the case for the neutrals in the previous circle, whoapparently dwell at approximately the same level as the floor of the entrancethrough the gate of hell. This is the first downward movement within theInferno. [return to English [part0009.html#c04-s05-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c04-s05-i]]16–17. [part0009.html#c04-s06-e] Virgil’s sudden pallor (v. 14) causes Danteto believe that his guide is fearful, as he himself had been at the end of theprevious canto (III.131).

[part0009.html#c04-s06-e] Virgil has given comfort to Dante when thelatter has succumbed to doubt in each of the first two cantos.

[part0009.html#c04-s07-e] Virgil makes plain the reason for his pallor:he is feeling pity for those who dwell in Limbo (and thus himself as well), notfear. That much seems plain enough. But there has been controversy over thecenturies as to whether Virgil refers only to the inhabitants of Limbo or to allthe damned. Mazzoni (Mazz.1965.1), pp. 58–65, offers a careful review of theproblem and concludes that the better reading is the former, demonstrating thatDante has, in five passages in earlier works, made sighs (sospiri) the result offeeling anguish (angoscia)—as they are here (v. 26).

[part0009.html#c04-s09-e] As was true in the last Circle (where theneutrals were punished) the darkness is at first so great that Dante apparentlycannot see; his first impressions are only auditory. Compare Inferno III.21–30.[return to English [part0009.html#c04-s09-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c04-s09-i]]30. [part0009.html#c04-s10-e] This line, seemingly innocent of polemicalintent, is in fact in pronounced and deliberate disagreement with St. Thomas(though in accord with Virgil’s description of the crowds along the bank ofAcheron [Aen. VI.306–307]). For Thomas, the inhabitants of Limbo were in one oftwo classes: the Hebrew saints, harrowed by Christ and taken to heaven, and allunbaptized infants. They are now of that second group alone. Dante’s addition ofthe virtuous pagans is put forward on his own authority. This is perhaps thefirst of many instances in which Dante chooses to differ with Thomas. For ahelpful analysis of the ways in which Dante both follows and separates himselffrom “authoritative” accounts of the Limbus, see Mazzoni (Mazz.1965.1), pp.70–80. Mazzoni shows that Dante is in total agreement with Thomas about thepresence of the unbaptized infants in Limbo, but disagrees with him (followingBonaventure instead) about whether these infants suffer the pain that comes fromknowing of their inability to see God—which Thomas allows himself to doubt.Dante (as does Bonaventure) holds a harsher view on this point. His view of theunbaptized pagans, however, is as mild as his view of the pain of the infants issevere. It is in sharp disagreement with the views of most Christians on thisissue. Padoan (Pado.1969.1), p. 371, cites Guido da Pisa’s commentary to thisverse as exemplary of early puzzled or hostile responses to Dante’s inclusion ofthe virtuous pagans in Limbo: “The Christian faith, however, does not hold thatthere are any here other than the innocent babes. Here, and in certain otherpassages, this poet speaks not as a theologian but as a poet.” [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c04-s10-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c04-s10-i]]42. [part0009.html#c04-s14-e] Virgil’s insistence that the inhabitants ofLimbo “without hope live in longing” does not as greatly reduce the sense ofpunishment suffered here, as some argue. See St. Thomas, De malo, q. 5, art. 2(cited by Mazzoni [Mazz.1965.1], p. 69): “Original sin is not fitly punished bysensation, but only by damnation itself, that is, the absence of the sight ofGod.” If their only punishment is that absence, it is nonetheless total.

[part0009.html#c04-s15-e] In at least one respect Inferno I and II arecantos paired in opposition, the first rooted in Dante’s fear (paura), thesecond in the reassurance granted by the word (parola), as spoken by Virgil andBeatrice. The same may be said for Cantos III and IV. Mazzoni, following thelead of Forti (Fort.1961.1), identifies the central subject of the first of thispair as “pusillanimità” (cowardice), of the second as “magnanimità” (greatnessof soul—Mazz.1965.1, pp. 34–35). See note to Canto III.58–60. [return to English[part0009.html#c04-s15-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c04-s15-i]]45. [part0009.html#c04-s15-e] The word sospesi (“suspended”) has caused greatdispute. Are the limbicoli “hanging” between heaven and hell? between salvationand damnation? Is there some potential better state awaiting them? Mazzoni’snote (Mazz.1965.1), pp. 89–93, leaves little doubt, and resolves their situationas follows: they are punished eternally for their original sin, but are aware(as are none of the other damned souls) of the better life that is denied them.They are “suspended,” in other words, between their punishment and theirimpossible desire.

Whyshould he seek confirmation of Christ’s ascent to heaven from a pagan? Whyshould he need to confirm his Christian faith on this indisputable point ofcredence, without which there is no Christian faith? Neither Dante’s questionnor Virgil’s answer concerns itself primarily with Christ’s descent to Limbo andascent to heaven, but rather with the more nebulous facts regarding those whowent up with Him after the harrowing of hell. See, for a modern recovery of theimportance of the harrowing as a concern in Limbo, the work of Iannucci(Iann.1979.2; Iann.1992.1). “Did ever anyone, either by his own or by another’smerit, go forth from here and rise to blessedness?” Dante’s question refers,first, to the Hebrew patriarchs and matriarchs, second, to unbaptized infantsand to all those who were later taken up from Limbo and whose ascent Virgilmight have witnessed. Indeed, Virgil’s answer will identify more than twenty ofthose harrowed by Christ; thus we know how he understood Dante’s first concern.Dante was interested in confirming what he had heard about the harrowing. Buthis question does have a second point. Virgil has himself been elevated fromhell, if but for a moment. Dante’s question alludes, tacitly, to him as well:“Are you one of the saved?” Dante’s “covert speech,” as the phrase intimates, isfocused on the salvation of pagans, and on Virgil in particular. In his gloss tov. 51 Benvenuto da Imola characterizes Dante’s view of his own “covert speech”as follows: “… as though my words had hidden the thought, ‘you greatphilosophers and poets, your great wisdom, what did it, without faith,accomplish for your salvation? Certainly nothing at all, for even the ancientpatriarchs, in their simple, faithful credence, were drawn up out of thisprison, in which place you are to remain for ever and ever.’ ” [return toEnglish [part0009.html#c04-s16-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c04-s16-i]]52–54. [part0009.html#c04-s18-e] Virgil tells Dante what he witnessed in 34a.d., when he was “new” to his condition, some fifty-three years after his deathin 19 B.C. He saw a “mighty one” (Christ recognized by Virgil only for hispower, an anonymous harrower to the pagan observer).

As lofty as noble actions and great philosophy may befor him (but that part of the canto, vv. 106–147, has only a single occurrenceof the word “honor”), it is poetry that, for Dante, is the great calling.[return to English [part0009.html#c04-s24-e] / Italian[part0017.html#c04-s24-i]]73.

Perhaps.Certainly not Ovid, not exactly Virgil’s greatest supporter. And even lessLucan, whose work rather pointedly attacks what Virgil champions.

They havewitnessed this sort of event before, at least once (the harrowing), and perhapsat least once more (Trajan’s latter-day resurrection). A student, ElizabethStatmore (Princeton ’82), in a seminar in February 1982 offered an interestinghypothesis (see Holl.1984.2, p. 219): Virgil’s companions thought that he, too,had now been harrowed.

[part0009.html#c04-s30-e] Alessio and Villa argue that the Latin poetsin Dante’s bella scola are divided into generic categories as follows: Virgil:tragedy; Ovid: elegy; Horace: satire; Lucan: history. Missing from such a listis a representative of comedy. They argue that almost any reader would haveexpected to find Terence’s name here, and go on to surmise that Dante hasdeliberately excluded Terence as the representative of comedy because he hastaken that role unto himself (Ales.1993.1, pp. 56–58).

In recent years there has been a growing amountof concerted attention finally being paid to Dante’s enormous debt to Ovid,historically overshadowed by the at least apparently even greater one to Virgil.E.g., Jaco.1991.1, containing seven essays on Dante’s responses to Ovid, andPico.1991.1, Pico.1993.1, Pico.1994.1. And see the lengthy treatment by MartheDozon (Dozo.1991.1).Lucan, not studied enough as source for so many of Dante’s verses, is alsobeginning to receive more attention. For a recent study arguing for Dante’sclose and highly nuanced reading of Lucan, one that helps to account for much ofthe portrait of his Ulysses, see Stull and Hollander (Stul.1991.1).

Virgil is not suggesting that his fellow ancientpoets do well to praise him, but that in praising him they honor their sharedprofession. If there is a “humanistic” gesture in this canto, we find it here,“a solemn celebration of the worth of poetry” (Padoan’s comment).

(1) Is the “lord of loftiest song” Homer or Virgil? Mosttoday agree that Homer is meant. (2) Does the relative pronoun che in v. 96refer to the singer or the song? That is, is it Homer (or Virgil) who soarsabove all other poets, or is it the lofty style of epic that flies higher thanall other forms of poetic expression? Most today prefer the second reading. Thisargument depends heavily upon the reference of the adjective altri. Those whothink that the second meaning is most likely point out that the adjective seemsto refer to canto in the preceding line, while a reference to the “other poets”can only be assumed, since there is no noun to attach to them. Our translationleaves the meaning ambivalent, as Dante seems to do. [return to English[part0009.html#c04-s32-e] / Italian [part0017.html#c04-s32-i]]99 [part0017.html#c04-s33-i].

In Inferno II.105 Lucy tells Beatrice thatDante, for her sake, had left “the vulgar herd” (la volgare schiera). Exactlywhat this means is a matter of some dispute, yet some believe that it refers tohis distancing himself from the rest of contemporary vernacular poets in hisquite different championing of his own and most special lady. (See note to Inf.II.105.) Such an interpretation is lent support by the fact that here the word(schiera) returns to designate a quite different group of poets, the greatauctores. (Of the nineteen uses of the noun in the poem, only these two make itrefer to a group that Dante either leaves or joins.) In this interpretationDante makes himself unique among contemporary poets in part because of hisadherence to Beatrice, in part because of his involvement with Virgil and theother great poets of antiquity.

For a review of the various sorts of discomfortamong the commentators occasioned by Dante’s promotion of his own poetic careerin this verse (some going so far as to insist that he displays humility hererather than pride) see Mazzoni (Mazz.1965.1), pp. 147–54. It is clear that Danteis putting himself in very good company on the basis of very littleaccomplishment: a series of lyrics, the Vita nuova, two unfinished treatises,and three cantos of the Comedy. His daring is amazing. However, we ought toconsider that most of his readers today will readily agree that he is not onlyjustly included in this company of the great poets of all time between Homer andDante, but is one of its foremost members. It was a dangerous gesture for him tomake. It is redeemed by his genius.For a possible source for this verse see Gmel.1966.1, p. 91: Ovid’s Tristia,IX.x.54, where that poet makes himself fourth in the line of poets afterTibullus, Gallus, and Propertius. And we should look ahead to Purg. XXI.91 whenthe inclusion of Statius will make Dante not the sixth but the seventh in thisgroup.That there are forty named or otherwise identified inhabitants in Limbo isprobably not accidental (the five poets and the thirty-five souls later observedin the precincts of the noble castle). In one tradition of medieval numerologythe “number” of man is four (of God, three). In a widely practiced mode ofmedieval “counting,” 40 = 4 + 0 = 4.

Mazzoni (Mazz.1965.1, pp. 154–56), following an earlyindication of D’Ovidio’s, argues that the subject is poetry, or the secrets ofthose involved in this sacred art, adducing as evidence two passages in Purg.XXII (104–105; 127–129). In the first of these Virgil tells Statius that he andhis poetic companions in Limbo often speak of the Muses; then Dante is allowedto overhear Statius and Virgil speaking of the art of poetic making. To be sure,the poet deliberately refuses (and this will not be the last time) to tell uswhat was said. Yet it is clear that we are meant to wonder what it was, and tocome up with some sort of reasonable hypothesis in explanation. No writer wouldotherwise include such a provocative detail.

The noble castle with its seven walls andsurrounding stream that Dante and the poets walk over as though it were dry landin order then to pass through the seven gates and into a green meadow: what dothese things signify? It is clear that here we are dealing with the conventionalkind of allegory, in which poetic objects stand for abstract ideas. But whichones? As is often the case, allegories (here, a brief extended metaphor) of thiskind have proven to be extremely difficult for Dante’s readers, and not only forhis modern readers. Mazzoni (Mazz.1965.1) presents the history of the question(pp. 156–68); yet it cannot be said that he has resolved it. Is the castle thegood life of the human being without Grace, all that can be done with the moraland speculative virtues that pagans could perfect despite their lack of faith(Mazzoni)? Or does the castle represent philosophy, with its seven disciplines(physics, metaphysics, ethics, politics, economics, mathematics, and dialectic[Padoan’s comment])? Or something else? And what does it mean that the paganpoets and Dante all can cross the stream as though it were not water? Surelythat stands for some impediment that keeps the rest of the inhabitants of Limboout, since apparently only those worthy of entrance can move over it. There arethirty-five designated inhabitants within the walls and fully two-fifths ofthese are “actives” (and the majority of these are women: eight of thefourteen). The more numerous “contemplatives”—had they been the only inhabitantsdiscussed—might indicate that the castle stands for “philosophy.” But what haveCaesar, Camilla, Latinus, or Lavinia got to do with philosophy? What, then, dothe castle and its surroundings stand for? The best that human beings can bewithout God, in whatever precise further formulation: that seems a plausible, ifnot satisfying, response to Dante’s riddle.

That Saladin, for all the good report that heenjoyed, is included by Dante in Limbo (along with two other “infidels,”Avicenna and Averroes, at vv. 143–144) is nonetheless extraordinary.

With the exception of the invocation inInferno II.7, this is the first time he has assumed that role, this timeaddressing remarks about the poem to us, his readers: “I cannot give account ofall of them, for the length of my theme so drives me on, the telling often comesshort of the fact.” The effect is, as we have observed before (note to vv.64–66, above), to put together an appeal to his experience as voyager, returnedfrom a veracious visit to the otherworld, and insistence on his absolute controlover what he has in fact invented. As readers we are aware that it is he who hascreated the inhabitants of Limbo; his remark both insists that he is onlyrecording what he observed and simultaneously allows a shared understanding ofhis contrivance. What is genial in it is that it turns his reader into acollaborator. The use of the word tema (here “poetic subject”) underlines theliterary nature of the enterprise.

[part0010.html#c05-s01-e] A descent again marks a border, this timebetween the Limbus and the second Circle. Singleton’s gloss argues that thepresence here of Minos in judgment indicates that “real hell” begins only now,that Limbo is “marginal.” It is true, however, that the Limbus is inside thegate of hell. Not only does “real hell” begin there, it in a sense begins withthose who are barely inside the gate, the neutrals. They are so pusillanimousthat they are not even allowed “a proper burial,” as it were. One may not evensay, as some have, that only with the second Circle do we begin to witnessactual punishment being meted out for past sins, since the neutrals are indeedtormented by stinging insects as a fit punishment for their feckless conduct(Inf. III.65–66). [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s01-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s01-i]]4–5. [part0010.html#c05-s02-e] Padoan, in his gloss, argues that the presenttense of the verbs in this tercet (sta, ringhia, essamina, giudica, manda,avvinghia) reflects the continuous condition of Minos’s behavior. In fact allthe verbs in the passage describing Minos’s judgment, vv. 4–15, are in thepresent, as Dante leaves little doubt but that he wants his readers to imaginethemselves—unless a life of good conduct and God’s grace combine to gain abetter end—coming before that judgment in the future. This is the everlastingpresent of the moment of damnation, occurring, the text would make us feel, evenas we read. For a study of the historical present in the Commedia, withattention (pp. 266–68) to this passage, see Sanguineti (Sang.1958.1).Dante fairly often portrays infernal monsters and characters as having bestialtraits. For this particular one, canine vociferation, see also Cerberus (Inf.VI.43), Plutus (Inf. VII.43), Hecuba (Inf. XXX.20), Bocca degli Abati (Inf.XXXII.105; Inf. XXXII.108); Brutus and Cassius in Inferno XXXIV (described as“barking” retrospectively at Par. VI.74). See discussion in Spag.1997.1, p. 112.For the conflation here in the figure of Minos of the roles of Minos and ofRhadamanthus in Virgil’s underworld, see Moor.1896.1, pp. 183–84; the texts arefound at Aeneid VI.432–433 and 566–569.

Does he flap it back and forth as many times ashe wishes to indicate the appropriate Circle? Or does he wind it like a vinearound a tree? See Mazz.1977.1, pp. 104–5, for a brief summary of the debate andreasons to prefer the second hypothesis.

Sinners are “ill-begotten” in that their end isthis, eternal damnation, because of their sins (and not because theirprocreation in itself so fated them). Padoan, commenting on this verse, pointsout that Dante himself is later described as “bene nato” (wellborn)—Par. V.115.[return to English [part0010.html#c05-s03-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s03-i]]8. [part0010.html#c05-s03-e] Dante presents Minos as a parody of a confessormeting out penance to a sinner (see Beno.1983.1). The word confessa marks thebeginning of this canto’s concern with confession, which will be parodied againwhen Dante “confesses” Francesca (vv. 118–120). For now we are perhaps meant toruminate on the perversity of sinners. In the world above they were offered,through this office of the Church, the possibility of confession and remissionof sins. We may infer that those sinners whom we find in hell probably did notavail themselves of their great opportunity. (We never hear the word“confession” on the lips of any of them except for Guido da Montefeltro [Inf.XXVII.83]. And he, having confessed and become a friar, then sins again and iscondemned. His second [and vain] confession is made, too late, in hell and onlyto Dante.) This moment offers a brief but cogent vision of human perversity: intheir lives all those whom we see in hell had the opportunity to be rid of theirsins by owning up to them in confession. They apparently did not do so. Here, inhell, what is the very first thing that they do? They make full disclosure oftheir sins … to Minos.

[part0010.html#c05-s03-e] The mechanical nature of Minos’s judgment—heis a judge who renders judgment with his tail, not his head—underlines the lackof authority of the demons in hell: Minos is merely doing God’s work. Hell ispresented as a perfectly functioning bureaucracy. If some of Satan’s minions areat times rebellious (e.g., the rebel angels in Inf. IX, the winged demons inXXI–XXIII), they are so in vain. Hell, too, is a part of God’s kingdom. [returnto English [part0010.html#c05-s03-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c05-s03-i]]17.

[part0010.html#c05-s06-e] Minos, seeing a rarity, to say the least—aliving man before him at the entrance—steals a moment from his incessantjudgment to offer this warning. How kindly are his intentions? Most commentatorsseem to think he is the most “humane” of the infernal demons, and even courteousto Dante. However, and as Padoan points out (in his commentary), his callinginto question, albeit indirectly, the competence of Virgil as guide(“beware … whom you trust”), is evidently meant to unsettle Dante. He wouldobviously prefer not to have such visitors. [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s06-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c05-s06-i]]20. [part0010.html#c05-s07-e] Commentators customarily note that here Dantebuilds his line out of two sources: Aeneid VI.126: “Facilis descensus Averno”(the descent to the underworld is easy [but not the return from there]); Matth.7:13: “spatiosa via est, quae ducit ad perditionem” (broad is the way that leadsto perdition).

For the repetition here of theidentical verses (23 and 24) used to quell Charon’s rebellious desires see Inf.III.95–96 and note.

[part0010.html#c05-s12-e] One of the most debated verses in this cantobecause of the word ruina (literally, “ruin”). What precisely does it mean? Twodiscussions of the commentary tradition are available, the first by LetterioCassata (Cass.1971.1), the second, still more complete, by Nicolò Mineo (ED,vol. 4, 1973), pp. 1056–57. Mineo points out that there have been sixidentifiable schools of interpretation for the meaning of la ruina.Unfortunately, there are severe problems associated with all of them. ManyAmerican and some Italian students of the problem have been drawn to Singleton’ssolution (commentary to Inf. XII.32 and XII.36–45): Dante suppresses the meaningof the noun here only to reveal it at Inferno XII.32–41, where questa ruina (v.32) refers to the crack in the wall of hell made by the earthquake thataccompanied Christ’s crucifixion. However, it does remain extremely dubious, asmany rightly point out, that Dante would, for the only time in his poem, holdback the reference necessary to a word’s clear literal sense for seven cantos.We agree with Mazzoni’s tentative judgment (Mazz. 1977.1, pp. 106–8) that themeaning of ruina here is not “ruin,” but “fury, violence,” as in the impetus ofthe wind that drives these sinners.

[part0010.html#c05-s14-e] The first two similes of the canto (and seethe third one, vv. 82–85) associate the lustful with birds, a naturalassociation given their condition, driven by the wind, and one in accord withthe medieval view that lust is the property of beings less than human, andindeed frequently of birds.

[part0010.html#c05-s16-e] The group in the second simile of the cantois more select, the “stars” of lustful living. Where the starlings are as thoughwithout individual identities, the “masses” of the lustful, as it were, each ofthese has a particularity and a certain fame, and is thus worthy of beingtreated as exemplary. (For a discussion of exemplary literature in the middleages see Delc.1989.1, with special attention to Dante, pp. 195–227.) Padoan(commentary), on the other hand, suggests that this second group isdistinguished from the first on moral grounds, since they all died by their ownhand or at the hand of others, and are as a result more heavily punished. Theevidence for such a view does not seem present in the text.For the cranes see Aeneid X.264–266 as well as Statius, Thebaid V.11–16.

In the Circle of lust we findthese seven identified sinners and two more: Francesca and Paolo, who bring thetotal to nine. As Curtius argued quite some time ago, given the importance forDante of the number nine (the “number” of his beloved Beatrice), it seems likelythat these nine souls who died for love are associated with her by opposition(Curt.1948.1, p. 369).It is also notable that Dante’s catalogues are unlike (and pronouncedly so inthis case) later humanist catalogues of the famous, which thrive on additions,in display of “erudition”: the more the better seems to be the motto of suchwriters. Dante, on the other hand, frequently sculpts his groupings to apurpose.One of the insistent poetic topoi that we find in medieval writers—and certainlyin Dante—is that of translatio. This is the notion that certain ideas orinstitutions have their major manifestations in movement through historical timeand space. The two most usually deployed examples of this topos are translatioimperii (the movement of imperial greatness from Troy to Rome to “newRome”—wherever that may be in a given patriotic writer’s imagination [in Dante’scase the empireless Rome of his own day]) and translatio studii (the developmentof serious intellectual pursuit from its birth in Athens, to its rebirth inRome, to its new home [Paris, according to some, in Dante’s day]). It is perhapsuseful to think of Dante’s catalogues as reflecting a similar sense of history,of movement through time and space. In this one, a sort of translatio amoris, wehave three triads: Semiramis (incestuous paramour of her own son), Dido (partnerof Aeneas, abandoned by him), Cleopatra (lover of Julius Caesar and of MarkAntony), all three lustful queens of the African coast; Helen and Paris (Greekand Trojan lovers whose lusts brought down a kingdom) with Achilles (Greek loverof the Trojan woman Polyxena); Tristan (a man caught up in destructive passionfor King Mark’s wife, Isolde, in the court of Cornwall, as we move into Europeand toward the present); Francesca and Paolo (lovers from the recent past [ca.1285] in Rimini, here in Italy).

Semiramis was the legendary queen of Assyria(Dante has confused the name of her capital, Babylon, for that of the Egyptiancity, and thus misplaced her realm). She was supposed to have legalized incestin order to carry out her sexual liaison with her son. For more about her seeSamu.1944.1 and Shap.1975.1. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s20-e] /Italian [part0018.html#c05-s20-i]]61–62. [part0010.html#c05-s21-e] Dante’s use of periphrasis (circumlocution)represents one of his favored “teaching techniques,” in which he (generally, butcertainly not always) offers his readers fairly easy problems to solve. Use ofperiphrasis has a second effect: it tends to emphasize the importance of theperson or thing so presented. The “Dido” that we scribble in our margins,remembering that her husband’s name was Sichaeus, stands out from the page,partly because it is we who have supplied the name. That Dido is thequintessential presence in this “flock” is underlined by v. 85, where she is theonly named presence in it, having previously been alluded to only indirectly.[return to English [part0010.html#c05-s21-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s21-i]]61 [part0010.html#c05-s21-e]. Dido’s presence here frequently upsets readerswho think that she ought to be found in Canto XIII, since she committed suicide.It is clear that Dante thinks of the psychology of sin with a certainsophistication, isolating the impulse, the deeper motive, that drives ouractions from the actions themselves. In Dido’s case this is her uncontrolleddesire for Aeneas. She does not kill herself from despair (as do the suicides inthe thirteenth canto), but rather to give expression to her need for herlover—or so Dante would seem to have believed.

[part0010.html#c05-s21-e] Virgil’s similar one-line description of Dido’s“infidelity” occurs at Aeneid IV.552, where she admits that she had not “keptthe faith promised to the ashes of Sichaeus.”[return to English[part0010.html#c05-s21-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c05-s21-i]]63.

[part0010.html#c05-s22-e] It is important to remember that Dante,Greekless, had not read Homer, who only became available in Latin translationmuch later in the fourteenth century. His Achilles is not the hero of the Iliadknown to some of us, but the warrior-lover portrayed by Statius and others.[return to English [part0010.html#c05-s22-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s22-i]]69–72. [part0010.html#c05-s23-e] di nostra vita. The echo of the first line ofthe poem is probably not coincidental. Dante was lost “midway in the journey ofour life” and, we will later learn, some of his most besetting problems arosefrom misplaced affection. He was, indeed, near death as a result of histransgressions. The repetition of the word smarrito to describe Dante’sdistraught condition also recalls the first tercet of the poem. Here we can seean emerging pattern in his reuse of key words from previous contexts in order toenhance the significance of a current situation in the poem. [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s23-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c05-s23-i]]71. [part0010.html#c05-s24-e] Dante refers to the great figures of the oldendays with strikingly anachronistic terms, the medieval “ladies and knights”emphasizing the continuity of the historical record. No “humanist” writer wouldbe likely to use such a locution that so dramatically erases the gap betweenclassical antiquity and the present age.

[part0010.html#c05-s25-e] To be “light upon the wind” is, to some readers,a sign of Francesca’s and Paolo’s noble ability to triumph over their dismalsurroundings; to others, it indicates that they are driven even more wildly thansome other shades by the winds of passion. This first detail begins a series ofchallenging phrasings that invite the reader to consider closely the ambiguitiesof the entire episode. For a summary of the issues at stake here, seeMazz.1977.1, pp. 124–28. And for a thorough consideration of the history ofinterpretation of the episode of Francesca see A. E.

[part0010.html#c05-s26-e] Virgil’s only complete tercet in the secondhalf of the canto (see note to vv. 109–117) is laconic, as though he were awareof the emotions felt by Dante (which he himself had so devastatingly presentedin Aeneid IV, the story of love’s destructive power over Dido) and realizedthere was nothing he had said or could say that might rein in his excited pupil.[return to English [part0010.html#c05-s26-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s26-i]]80. [part0010.html#c05-s27-e] The protagonist’s adjective for the two sinners(they are “anime affannate”) may well be meant to remind us of the only othertime we find that adjective in Inferno (Inf. I.22), when Dante is described asbeing like a man who has escaped from the sea “with laboring breath” (con lenaaffannata). If that is true, it further binds the character’s sense of identitywith these sinners. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s27-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s27-i]]82–84. [part0010.html#c05-s28-e] The third simile involving birds in thiscanto (and there are only three similes in it) compares the two lovers to doves.As Shoaf (Shoa.1975.1) has demonstrated, there is a “dove program” in theComedy, beginning with the Venereal doves reflected here, passing through thedoves at their feeding in Purgatorio II.124–129, and finishing in the referenceto James and Peter as “doves” of the Holy Spirit in Paradiso XXV.119–121.Dante’s doves here seem to reflect both Aeneid V.213–217 and Georgics I.414.[return to English [part0010.html#c05-s28-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s28-i]]88. [part0010.html#c05-s30-e] Francesca da Polenta of Ravenna was affianced toGiovanni Malatesta of Rimini, who was crippled. History or legend has it thatthe marriage was arranged when his younger brother, Paolo, was sent to make thepledge of betrothal. Francesca, seeing him, was under the impression that it wasthis handsome man who was to be her husband. Her delusion on her wedding day isnot difficult to imagine. Commentators point out that her adulterous conduct wasa lot more calculated than Dante presents it (she and Paolo, also married, bothhad children and she had then been married for ten years). The fact is, however,that Dante’s version of the story makes her conduct seem about as understandableas possible, an effort on which the character herself spends her considerableresources of persuasion.The beginning of her highly rhetorical speech reflects the tradition ofclassical rhetoric that would have a speaker first seek to gain the sympathy ofthe audience, a device referred to as captatio benevolentiae, the capturing ofthe goodwill of one’s auditors. For noteworthy earlier examples of captatio seeBeatrice’s first words to Virgil (Inf. II.58–60) and Virgil’s first words to her(Inf. II.76–81). [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s30-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s30-i]]91–93. [part0010.html#c05-s31-e] Francesca’s locutions are revealing andinstructive: God is portrayed as having turned away from the two lovers, whileDante is welcomed for not having done so, for feeling pietà for them. This cantohas one of its “key words” in amore, which occurs fully eleven times in it (vv.61, 66, 69, 78, 100, 103, 106, 119, 125, 128, 134). But this word, “pity,” iscrucial as well (vv. 72, 93, 117, 140, and, in the continuing narrative of thenext canto, VI.2). Dante is filled with pity for lost lovers. Should he be? Thatmay be the central question facing a reader of Inferno V (see furtherdiscussion, below [note to v. 142]). [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s31-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c05-s31-i]]91 [part0018.html#c05-s31-i]. For the source of this verse in Cavalcanti’s line“Se Mercé fosse amica a’ miei disiri” (Were Mercy friendly to my desires) seeContini (Cont.1976.1), p. 155.

The use of anaphora (repetition) here at thebeginning of each tercet, “Amor … Amor … Amor…,” underlines the rhetorical skillof Francesca, who presses her case with listening Dante: it was Love’s faultthat she and Paolo fell into carnal passion. “Amor” appears three times as thefirst word in a tercet after an end-stopped line and thus must be capitalized.It seems also reasonable to believe that Francesca is here referring to her“god,” the Lord of Love, Cupid, whose name is “Amor.” He is the only god sheseems to own, since, by her account (v. 91), the “King of the universe” is nother friend. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s34-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s34-i]]102 [part0018.html#c05-s34-i]. Against Pagliaro (Pagl.1967.1), pp. 136–49, whoargues that Francesca is referring to the way in which she was made to fall inlove, Padoan (commentary and Pado.1993.1, pp. 189–200) argues persuasively thatshe refers in fact to the brutal manner of her death. This verse is muchdebated. The wording of the text allows, in itself, either interpretation. Ourtranslation therefore leaves the meaning ambiguous, as does, indeed, theoriginal, whatever Dante’s intentions. [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s34-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c05-s34-i]]103 [part0018.html#c05-s35-i]. The dicta of Andreas Capellanus are often citedas lying behind Francesca’s speech (e.g., De amore II, 8): “Amor nil possetamori denegare” (Love can deny love nothing at all). A closer parallel existsbetween a line in a love poem by Cino da Pistoia and this one: “A nullo amatoamar perdona amore” (“Love allows no one beloved not to love,” cited by EnricoMestica [commentary]). But we do not know if Dante is echoing Cino or Cino,Dante. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s35-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s35-i]]107 [part0018.html#c05-s36-i]. Francesca, whose chief rhetorical strategy is toremove as much blame from herself as she is able, finding other forces at faultwherever possible (e.g., Paolo’s physical beauty, her despicable husband, theallure of a French romance), here tries to even the score with her husband. Shemay be damned, but he, as the killer of his wife and brother, will be much lowerdown, in the ninth Circle. Since Gianciotto, who killed them in 1283–84, liveduntil 1304, his shade could not be seen by Dante in Caïna. We have, as a result,no basis on which to question her opinion. However, had Dante wanted toguarantee it, it would have taken a line or so to do just that—and he doesseveral times have sinners tell of the impending arrival of still others in agiven Circle in ways that clearly call for acceptance (see note to Inf.XXXII.54–69). And so we are left wondering at Francesca’s remark, and should atleast keep this question open. It seems better to view her prediction as a wishstated as a fact than as a fact. However, for an example of the view thataccepts Francesca’s predictive placement of her husband in hell see Bald.1988.1,p. 1070.Iannucci suggests that Gianciotto may have been conceived by Dante as beingmisshapen and lame like Vulcan, the cuckolded husband of Venus (Iann.1980.1, p.345). [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s36-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s36-i]]109–117 [part0018.html#c05-s37-i]. These nine verses contain the “drama” of thecanto in nuce. Dante’s pensive condition in the first tercet reflects his beingmoved deeply by Francesca’s beautiful speech; Virgil attempts to spur him tothoughtful appreciation of what he has seen and heard; the second tercet recordshis more emotional than rational outburst: he is totally sympathetic to thelovers, and now, in the third, he turns to tell Francesca that he is filled withpity for her. She has won him over.Some twenty years ago Dante’s tearful state (v. 117) reminded Elizabeth Raymondand Susan Saltrick (both Princeton ’78) of the tears Augustine shed for Dido—seePine.1961.1, p. 34 (Confessions I.13).

In 1972, Georgia Nugent, then a student atPrinceton, pointed out that Dante’s question mimics the questions used byconfessors to ascertain the nature of a penitent’s sins. Here, we may reflect,Dante is behaving more like a priest in the so-called “religion of Love” than aChristian confessor. See the earlier discussion of confession in this canto,note to v. 8. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s40-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s40-i]]121–126 [part0018.html#c05-s41-i]. “This [the first tercet] imitatesVirgil … but literally translates Boëtius” (Taaf.1822.1, p. 326). See theConsolation of Philosophy II, pr. 4: “in omni adversitate fortunaeinfelicissimum est genus infortunii fuisse felicem” (among fortune’s manyadversities the most unhappy kind is once to have been happy).For the Virgilian resonances (Aen. II.3–13), see the fairly detailed account inHoll.1969.1, pp. 110–11. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s41-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s41-i]]123 [part0018.html#c05-s41-i]. There is debate as to whether the word dottore(here “teacher”) refers to Boethius or Virgil. Most prefer the secondhypothesis. We should realize that either choice forces upon us a somewhatungainly hypothesis, the first that Francesca knows Boethius well (it is onlyseveral years since Dante had characterized the Consolation of Philosophy as awork known only to few [Conv. II.xii.2]), the second that she recognizes theRoman poet Virgil without having had him identified by Dante. Since Virgil isreferred to by Dante as “il mio dottore” in this very canto (v. 70), it seemsthe wiser choice to accept the notion that Dante, taking advantage of poeticlicense, allows Francesca to recognize Virgil.

In the Old French Lancelot of the Lake, KingArthur’s queen, Guinevere, betrayed her husband with the knight Lancelot. Muchhas been written on the sources of this scene. Work in English includes articlesby Carozza (Caro.1967.1) and Maddox (Madd.1996.1). And for a possible link tothe love story of Eloise and Abelard see Dronke (Dron.1975.1).

Francesca’s account of her and Paolo’s conquestby Amor is “corrected” by a later text, Dante’s reference to God as the “puntoche mi vinse” (Par. XXX.11), where Dante is, like Paolo, “constrained” by love(strinse [v. 128]; Paradiso XXX, 15: amor mi costrinse)—but his desire is forBeatrice, not for a fleshly liaison. The passage in Paradiso is clearly meant toreflect negatively, not only on the amorous activity of Francesca and Paolo, buton the protagonist’s reactions to it. The god of Love and Francesca are beingplayed against God and Beatrice—or so we will understand once we reach the lastcantica. For the resonance of this self-citation see Holl.1988.1, pp. 7–8,discussing the contributions of Contini (Cont.1976.1), p. 206; Hollander(Holl.1983.1), pp. 139–40; and Dronke (Dron.1989.1), p. 30.

Once again Francesca blames another for theirpredicament, this time the go-between, Gallehault, in the tale of Lancelot andGuinevere as well as its author. By now we have come to see—or should have—howoften she lays her problems at the doors of others. At least in part because ofDante’s reference to him here, Gallehault became synonymous with“pander.”[return to English [part0010.html#c05-s46-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s46-i]]138 [part0018.html#c05-s46-i]. Francesca, reading a book that leads to her“conversion” to sin and death in the company of a man named Paul, is the“negative antitype” of St. Augustine, reading a book by Paul that leads to hisconversion (Confessions VIII.xii [Pine.1961.1, p. 178]—see Swing for what seemsto be the first observation of this striking connection [Swin.1962.1], p. 299,and further discussion by Hollander [Holl.1969.1], pp. 112–13). Augustine isconverted by reading a passage in St. Paul (Romans 13:13–14): “Let us walkhonestly as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering andwantonness, not in strife and envying. But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, andmake not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.” Here, we mayreflect, Francesca reads a book and is “converted,” by doing so, to the lustthat leads to death. And if Augustine was converted by reading a man named Paul,Francesca gives herself to adultery with a man bearing the same name. As Swinghas pointed out, Francesca’s last words, quel giorno più non vi leggemmo avante(that day we read in it no further), seem more than coincidentally close toAugustine’s nec ultra volui legere (and I did not wish to read any further). Forsupport of the idea that Dante is here thinking of this pivotal moment inAugustine’s spiritual autobiography, see Scot.1979.1, p. 14. If we are meant tothink of Augustine’s Confessiones here, that would round off this canto’sconcern with confession (see discussion, above, in notes to vv. 8 and 118–120).[return to English [part0010.html#c05-s46-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s46-i]]140 [part0018.html#c05-s47-i]. We now realize that during the entire episode wehave not heard a word from Paolo. Dante will return to this strategy when hetwice again involves pairs of sinners in suffering together, Diomedes withUlysses in Inferno XXVI, Ruggieri with Ugolino in Inferno XXXIII. In each caseone of the two is a silent partner. We can try to imagine what an eternity ofsilence in the company of the voluble being who shares the culpability for one’sdamnation might be like. [return to English [part0010.html#c05-s47-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c05-s47-i]]141. [part0018.html#c05-s47-i] Dante’s death-like swoon has him experiencingsomething akin to the death in sensuality experienced by Francesca and Paolo.This is to be at odds with the view of Pietrobono (commentary), who argues thatDante’s death-like collapse mirrors his attaining of the state urged by Paul inhis Epistle to the Romans, chapter 6, wherein the Christian “dies” to sin inimitation of Christ (e.g., “For he that is dead is freed from sin”—Romans 6:7).It would rather seem that this is exactly not the state attained by theprotagonist at this point in the poem.Maddox (Madd.1996.1), pp. 119–22, draws a parallel between Dante’s faintingspell and that suffered by Galehot in the prose Lancelot. [return to English[part0010.html#c05-s47-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c05-s47-i]]142 [part0018.html#c05-s47-i]. Torraca, commenting on this verse, was perhapsthe first commentator to note the Arthurian material that lies behind Dante’sfamous line: the Italian prose version of the stories of Arthur’s court, Latavola ritonda, XLVII, where Tristan’s response to Isolde’s death is describedas follows: “e cadde sì come corpo morto.” The protagonist is thus compared tothe victim of overwhelming passion. His fainting marks him here as unable tocontrol his pity, as it had had the same effect with respect to fear two cantosearlier (Inf. III.136).The fifth Canto of Inferno is the cause of continuing debate. Where are we tolocate ourselves as witnesses to these scenes? Romantic readers understandablytend to align themselves with the love that Francesca emblematizes and/or thepity that Dante exhibits; moralizing ones with the firmness that an Augustinianreader would feel. Virgil perhaps, given his silence through most of the secondhalf of the canto (once Francesca appears on the scene he speaks only two words:“che pense?” [what are your thoughts?—v. 111]), would then seem to be trying torein in Dante’s enthusiastic involvement with this enticing shade. Yet even astheologically-oriented a reader as Mazzoni (Mazz.1977.1, pp. 125–26) finds itimportant to distance himself from such “rigid moralizing” as is found inBusn.1922.1 and Mont.1962.1. A view similar to Mazzoni’s is found in amuch-cited essay by Renato Poggioli: “The ‘romance’ of Paolo and Francescabecomes in Dante’s hands an ‘antiromance,’ or rather, both things at once. Assuch, it is able to express and to judge romantic love at the same time”(Pogg.1957.1, p. 358). In America, the role of the “rigid moralizer” has beenplayed, in recent times, most notably by Cassell (Cass.1984.1), with similarresponses from most of his reviewers. For Mazzoni and many, perhaps most,contemporary readers, the canto needs to be responded to more generously thanthe “moralizers” would like. And, to be sure, there is at times a certainperhaps unfortunately zealous tone in the words of such critics. On the otherhand, their views seem only to accord with the overall aims of the poet and hispoem. Francesca is, after all, in hell. The love she shares with Paolo was andis a “mad love” (for this concept see Aval.1975.1). The text clearly maintainsthat the lustful punished here “make reason subject to desire” (v. 39). And so,where some would find pity the middle ground for the reader to occupy, betweenthe sinful lust of Francesca and Paolo and the “rigid moralizers,” others,including this commentator, argue that it is pity itself that is here at fault.Amore and pietà are no doubt among the “key words” of the canto (see above, noteto vv. 91–93); that does not mean that they must function in opposition to oneanother; they may be versions of the same emotion. Indeed, if we see thatFrancesca’s aim is precisely to gain Dante’s pity, and that she is successful indoing so, we perhaps ought to question his offering of it. Sympathy for thedamned, in the Inferno, is nearly always and nearly certainly the sign of awavering moral disposition.

[part0010.html#c06-s09-e] The “sop” to Cerberus, in Virgil a honeyedcake (Aen. VI.419–422), here becomes mere earth (terra). Kleinhenz (Klei.1975.1,p. 190) has pointed out that Dante’s strategic redoing of Virgil has itsbiblical resonance, as God’s malediction of the serpent (Gen. 3:14) concludes“… terram comedes cunctis diebus vitae tuae” (and dust shall you eat all thedays of your life). The serpent’s punishment for having urged Eve to eat thefruit of the tree is himself to eat the dead earth; his punishment is shared nowby Cerberus.

This is the only simile found in this, theshortest canto we have yet read (only Inferno XI will have so few verses—115).It is as though Dante had begun paring his art, striving for succinctness morethan he had before.The distribution of canto lengths throughout the poem would seem to indicatethat Dante originally was limiting himself to composing in shorter units than hewould generally employ later in his text. If we examine the first twenty cantoswe find that fourteen, or 70% of them, are 136 lines long or fewer (115 to 136),while 9 (or 11%) of the final eighty are in this group (and all of these between130 and 136 lines). Confining ourselves to the very shortest cantos (those from115 to 130 verses), we find that these occur six times in the first twentycantos, with only one (of 130 lines) in this shorter group occurring afterInferno XX. Of the eighty final cantos, 88.75% (71 of them) are between 139 and160 lines long; only 11.25% (9 cantos) of the final eighty are 136 lines orfewer. See Ferrante (Ferr.1993.1), pp. 154–55, for the distribution of Dante’scanto lengths. Such data surely make it seem that Dante was experimenting withthis distribution as he progressed, a tentative conclusion that would cast somedoubt on the position of Thomas Hart, who has argued, carefully and well, thatit seems plausible that Dante may have planned even these details from the verybeginning. For a summary of his copious and interesting work, affording anoverview of it, see Hart.1995.1.

In hell, we are given to understand, matterand bodies can interact, but not matter and shades. Accordingly, we might expectDante to be soaked and chilled by the awful rain, while the shades of thegluttons feel nothing. Instead, in a single terzina, the poet forces us to maketwo allowances: Dante, walking through the rain that strikes the sinners,apparently feels nothing of it. The sinners, of course, feel it all too well. Weare reminded again that the physical laws of the afterworld are immutable—exceptwhen the writer chooses to break them in order to make the details of his poetrywork better.

[part0010.html#c06-s17-e] The metaphor of a sack out of which thecontents spill introduces the main theme of the canto, not gluttony, butpolitical rivalry (even if the image itself relates to the overabundant storageof food). Many commentators try to find reasons to explain Dante’s havingrelated the two, but none has found a genuinely convincing link. Until now, eachgroup of sinners, the neutrals, the virtuous pagans, the lustful, has beenportrayed as expressing their most pertinent activities on earth in everythingthat they do or say. Dante, however, chose not to keep to such a scheme on aregular basis and obviously decided to introduce “subcategories,” as it were, incertain Circles (e.g., politics [again] in the Circle of heresy). The fact is,Dante wants to address certain concerns and brings them to his text when hewants to.The envy that Dante sees as the source of the terrible political rivalries inFlorence in 1300 is traditionally understood as that felt by the nobler butpoorer Donati (Black) faction of the Guelphs against the richer Cerchi (White)faction. Yet, and given both the political situation and the main meaning ofenvy in Dante’s understanding (e.g., the desire to see one’s opponents sufferloss), it seems clear that all Florentines are marked by this sin in Dante’seyes. Envy, seen in Inf. I.111 as the motive force behind Satan’s seduction ofEve, is the second worst (after pride) of the seven mortal sins. In our time wetend not to understand either its gravity nor its widespread hold on humanhearts. An envious person does not want another’s wealth or happiness so much ashe wishes his neighbor to be deprived of wealth or happiness.

[part0010.html#c06-s18-e] One of the most debated questions of this cantohas to do with the identity and the name of this character. Was his nameactually “Ciacco”? If it was, an enduring supposition is that of Isidoro DelLungo (commentary): he is the thirteenth-century Florentine poet Ciaccodell’Anguillaia. While such a solution is attractive, there is as yet not ashred of evidence to support it. A more likely hypothesis is that his name was anickname, granted him either because of his gluttonous habits (“ciacco” was anoun that in Tuscany meant “pig,” or “hog,” according to some fourteenth-centurycommentators, most notably Francesco da Buti, but none of the earliest reportthat this was the case and there is no other confirming record) or because hisphysiognomy was such as to call for such a name (i.e., his nose was flattened onhis face [Pézard, ED, vol. 1, 1970, p. 983b]). And there is the furtherpossibility that the nickname suggested no reference to offensive traits(Mazzoni points out that there are many examples in public documents of the timein which such names are used as Christian names [Mazz.1967.2, p. 36]). Thefourteenth-century commentator published as the Chiose selmiani states thatCiacco was a Florentine banker who ate and drank so much that his eyesight wentbad—as a result he could not count money and people made fun of him; he knewDante, and died before Dante turned fourteen. That is the most detailed andspecific account we find in any early commentator. Boccaccio’s reference toCiacco (Decameron IX.viii.4) would suggest that he read Dante’s phrasing (“Voicittadini mi chiamaste Ciacco”) as indicating that this man had a different namebut was called by the Florentines by his nickname: “essendo in Firenze uno datutti chiamato Ciacco” (there being in Florence a man who was called “Ciacco” byeveryone). For a recent review of the entire problem, opting for the porcinenickname on the basis of Isidore of Seville’s discussion of Epicureans as hogs,see Simone Marchesi’s article (Marc.1999.1).

[part0010.html#c06-s22-e] This is the first prophecy about events thatwill have importance in Dante’s own life (as opposed to the “world-historical”prophecies that concern Dante as part of the human family) in a poem that isstudded with them. For the “personal prophecies” in the poem see Pasq.1996.1, p.419: Ciacco’s, Farinata’s (Inf. X.79–81); Brunetto’s (Inf. XV.55–57); VanniFucci’s (Inf. XXIV.143–150); Currado Malaspina’s (Purg.

Ciacco’sprophecy concerns the events of May 1300, three or five weeks after the date ofthe journey, and thus events genuinely near at hand. The White faction, led bythe Cerchi family, selvaggia in the sense of “rustic” (in that its members comefrom the wooded outskirts of the city), will drive out the Black faction in1300.

[part0010.html#c06-s25-e] “Two men are just …” For a brief but strongreading of the due giusti as referring to Dante and another Florentine, identitynot knowable, see Barb.1934.1, p. 266. Currently a great debate rages over thisverse, fanned by the exertions of Mazzoni. Following the gloss of Pietro diDante, who argues that the phrase refers not to two human beings, but to twolaws, natural and posited, (i.e., made by man), Mazzoni argues that the sourcefor such an interpretation exists in St. Thomas’s commentary on a passage inAristotle’s Ethics (VIII, c. xv, 1243): “Duplex est iustum” (Justice istwofold), that is, natural and posited. Perhaps even more helpful to Mazzoni’scase is Dante’s own phrasing in his epistle against his fellow townsmen (Epist.VI.5), whom he accuses of transgressing laws both divine and man-made (“Vosautem divina iura et humana transgredientes”). The traditional reading of theverse, which has gathered massive support, is as we have translated it: “Two menare just and are not heeded there.” Mazzoni’s “translation” would read, inEnglish, “the two kinds of justice are not followed there.” One can see both theforce and the charm of his argument. It is a possible line of interpretation.But it has to date failed to convince most who address the problem. Theycontinue to find the traditional reading a much more likely one (e.g.,Bara.1981.1).

Ifthere are only two just Florentines in the city in 1300, in “the good old days”there seem to have been at least five, men who made great effort to offersustenance to goodness. The meaning of the tercet is clear enough. The problemarises because one of the five, Arrigo, is never mentioned again—or surely doesnot seem to be. The other four are seen in hell, Farinata in Canto X, among theheretics, Tegghiaio and Iacopo in XVI, among the Florentine homosexualpoliticians (the most positively presented sinners since those we met in Limbo),and Mosca, in a sense the only “surprise” here, since he is punished in CantoXXVIII for his treachery on the battlefield, but, in Dante’s mind, ispraiseworthy for his efforts to bring peace to the city before that. See thestudy of Pietro Santini (Sant.1923.1) for this argument. Of course, it is thepuzzle created by Arrigo’s not being further referred to in hell that has drawncommentators’ fullest attention. For a review of the many competing “Harrys” whobegan to populate the margins of Dante’s poem in the fourteenth century and havecontinued to do so into our own, see Vincenzo Presta, “Arrigo” (ED, vol. 1,1970, pp. 391–92). It is strange that Dante picked the names of five men, fourof whom he goes on to include prominently in his poem, and one that he does notmention again—especially since he has Ciacco say explicitly that the protagonistwill see all of them in his descent (v. 87).

[part0010.html#c07-s01-e] Plutus, the god of wealth in classical myth,wishes to prevent the passage of this living soul through Satan’s kingdom. That,at least, is what we must surmise from Virgil’s reaction, vv. 4–6, whichassuages Dante’s fear. There is a program of demonic resistance that makes Dantefearful throughout Inferno: Charon (Inf. III.91–93), Minos (V.19–20), Cerberus(VI.22–24), Phlegyas (VIII.18), the Furies (IX.52–54), the Minotaur (XII.14–15),Geryon (XVII.25–27), Malacoda and the Malebranche (XXI.23–XXIII.57), Nimrod(XXXI.67), Satan (XXXIV.22–27). In almost all of these scenes it is Virgil’stask to quell the resistance of the infernal guardians and to reassure hischarge.Pape Satàn, Pape Satàn, aleppe. The third verse suggests that Virgil understandsthese words spoken by Plutus. If that is correct, he is perhaps the only one tohave done so. Over the centuries a continuing debate addresses, ratherconfusedly, the precise nature of these five words: whether they are part of arecognizable language or not; whether they are totally meaningless or have somemeaning; whether they are an invocation of the power of Satan against invadingDante or an oath giving expression to the monster’s surprise at the presence ofa living soul in hell. For a review of the question see Hollander (Holl.1992.1),who sees this and Nimrod’s similarly nonsensical five words (Inf. XXXI.67) asparodic inversions of the five words of clear speech called for by St. Paul,concerned about the overreliance of the faithful on speaking in tongues (I Cor.14:19). Plutus’s oath may be garbled speech, but it does contain “pseudo-words”that have meaning: Pape represents either a Latin interjection (papae) ofadmiration, as many ancient commentators think, or/and a debased form of theItalian and Latin for “pope” (papa—see v. 47: papi); Satàn would fairly clearlyseem to be a form of the Italian “Satana” or of the Latin “Sathanas” and thus“Satan”; aleppe, as some of the first commentators noticed, is the Italian formof the Hebrew word for the first letter of the alphabet, “aleph,” as in theLatin expression “alpha ed omega” (the first and last letters of the Greekalphabet, signifying “the beginning and the end”), as God defines Himself in theBible (Rev. 1:8, repeated at 21:6 and 22:13). If one had to render thesenonsense words in English one might say something like “O Pope Satan, my god.”Fortunately, one does not have to. For the connection of these words in mixedlanguage to those in the first verses of the seventh canto of Paradiso (there,naturally, totally positive in tone and meaning)—the parallelism is certainlystriking—see Sarolli (Saro.1971.1), pp. 289–90.

[part0010.html#c07-s03-e] That Virgil refers to Plutus as a wolf ties himto the vice of avarice, since in this poem wolves are often symbols of that vice(e.g., Purg. XX.10; Par. IX.132; XXVII.55).

Dante appropriates these two details tobuild the details of his fourth Circle. Virgil’s brief description of those wholoved riches to excess is without reference to those of the precisely oppositeinclination. In Dante’s formulation, prodigality is the opposite form of thesame vice. This is one of the few examples in the code of ethics found in thispoem in which an Aristotelian measure seems to be at work, in which a “goldenmean” locates the correct or permissible amount of affection or desire.

Christ had led his followers in embracing poverty and, muchlater, the mendicant orders took vows of poverty, some in remembrance of St.Francis’s imitation of Christ in this respect. Thus, while avarice in any personrespected for a higher calling would be disgraceful, it is particularly so in amember of the clergy and becomes an easy (and popular) target. It is notablethat the clergy are noticed only here—and in number—among the avaricious; noneof them is pointed out among the prodigal.

The insistence on the large number of clericsamong the avaricious (and no other social orders are identified as beingavaricious, not even bankers or moneylenders) continues, now including aplurality of popes.The anonymous plurality of popes mentioned in v. 47 leaves the reader free tosupply any number of such pontiffs. The essential impression left by the poem asa whole is that more popes are damned than saved. This is probably true, butDante does insist that a number of popes are in fact saved. The first andforemost is of course St. Peter, considered by Dante and medieval writers ingeneral as being the first pope. He is seen in paradise by Dante in the heavenof the Fixed Stars, where he has a major role as speaker, but he is referred tofrom the beginning of the poem to its end (Inf. II.24; Par. XXXII.133). AndPeter himself is the one who tells of the salvations of six other early popes:his two immediate successors Linus and Cletus, both martyred in the firstcentury (Par. XXVII.41), as well as four other popes martyred, according to atradition that Dante followed, in the second and third centuries: Sixtus I, PiusI, Calixtus I, and Urban I (Par. XXVII.44). Also mentioned as being saved areAgapetus I (Par. VI.16) and Gregory I (Par. XXVIII.133–135). We see Pope AdrianV purging his avarice on the road to heaven (Purg. XIX.99) and Pope Martin IVrepenting his zest for eating eels also on his way to paradise (Purg. XXIV.22).And there is Pope John XXI, seen as present in the heaven of the Sun and henceamong the blessed (Par. XII.134). Thus, twelve popes are indicated as beingamong God’s chosen.Several other popes are referred to, but without having their eventualdestinations under God’s justice made plain. Such is the case with respect toSylvester I (Inf. XXVII.94), Clement IV (Purg. III.125), Innocent III (Par.XI.92), and Honorius III (Par. XI.98).The case of the popes who are damned is more complex. Here is an attempt to listthe fallen pontiffs referred to in the poem. If the one “who made the greatrefusal” (Inf. III.60) is, as many believe, Pope Celestine V, he would be thefirst damned pope whom we see. He is followed by the unnamed pontiffs of CantoVII and then by Anastasius II (Inf. XI.8). Many believe that Innocent IV is themost certain presence in the unnamed line of precursors alluded to by NicholasIII (Inf. XIX.73)—a second instance of a plurality of damned popes, while thesaved ones are never referred to in this way. Those that are confirmed as damnedare Nicholas himself (Inf. XIX.70), Boniface VIII (Inf. XIX.53), Clement V (Inf.XIX.83), and, a last for good measure, John XXII (Par. XXVII.58). Thus at leastfive popes are definitively damned. In two cases, as we have seen, Dante opensthe door to other possibilities. As a result, the absolute possible low is nine(five plus the plural “papi” at Inf. VII.47 and “altri” at Inf. XIX.73—theremust be at least two in each case to account for the plural). Celestine wouldbring the total to ten. In short, Dante probably did mean to encourage hisreaders to believe exactly what most of them seem to believe—that more popeswere damned than were saved.

Sinclair, in his note to this verse (Sinc.1939.1, p. 105), cites anold Italian proverb: a prodigal spends “even to the hair of his head.” [returnto English [part0010.html#c07-s19-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c07-s19-i]]62–96 [part0010.html#c07-s21-e]. Virgil’s discourse on the nature and effect ofFortune on mortal lives is notable for its sunniness and equability. The usualand necessary citation among commentators is of Boethius, whose Consolation ofPhilosophy is the standard medieval text on the subject and was well known toDante. The Lady Philosophy explains to complaining Boethius that humans whosuffer like to blame their misfortune on bad luck, expressed by the fortune thatturns its back on them. What philosophy makes plain is that the fault lies inourselves, in that we pitch our hopes on things we should recognize as fallible,fleeting, and of ultimately little importance. What Dante adds to this sternmessage is a sense of calmness about and even positive acceptance of these factsof human existence. Fortune may be understood as, in the happy formulation ofCharles Grandgent (in his proem to this canto), “the Angel of Earth.” Nothingthat she does should be unexpected; everything that she does is “right.” Exactlysuch an understanding may be found in Dante’s own words in his Monarchia(II.ix.8), where he says that the force that distributes the goods of the world,victory or defeat in battle, which the pagans attributed to their gods, “wecall … by the more appropriate and accurate name ‘divine providence.’ ”Particularly helpful discussions of Dante’s understanding of fortune may befound in Cioffari’s book (Ciof.1940.1), Toja’a article (Toja.1965.1), andPadoan’s various remarks on this passage in his commentary.The distance that Dante has traveled from the position he took in his Convivio(IV.xi.6–8), where the unequal distribution of goods among humans is seen as adefect of Fortune’s agency, is manifest. In that passage Fortune is seen asacting randomly; here she is provident (v. 86)—and we should remember that shewas traditionally portrayed as blindfolded, unseeing as she acts. In thispassage, as one of the angelic hierarchy, she turns her famous “wheel” inknowledge and in bliss. God’s in His heaven, Fortune turns her wheel, all’sright with the world, which is only and absolutely as it should be.

[part0010.html#c07-s28-e] Dante’s “serpent hidden in the grass” has beenseen, at least from the sixteenth century on, as being a translation of Virgil’sthird Eclogue, verse 93: “latet anguis in herba.” [return to English[part0010.html#c07-s28-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c07-s28-i]]87.

[part0010.html#c07-s30-e] The rapid tranformations of human states aresummarized by the Casini/Barbi commentary to v. 96 as follows: a given humanbeing may typically move, along eight points on Fortune’s wheel, from humility,to patience, to peace, to riches, to pride, to impatience, to war, to poverty.This is a typical “ride” of anyone tied to Fortune’s wheel, ending back at thestarting point.

Clearly the protagonist, gazing upon theinhabitants of the fifth Circle, is looking at the wrathful. The problem forinterpreters is that wrath, or anger, is a sin of violence, not one ofincontinence; yet the poem has not yet left the realm of incontinence behind.Without reviewing the fairly vast literature upon this problem, one can offersome uncomplicated solutions, based on the thirteenth chapter of St. Thomas’scommentary on Aristotle’s Ethics (IV.5). Aristotle, in Thomas’s paraphrase,distinguishes three kinds of anger: choleric (which comes upon one quickly andquickly departs), bitter (which lasts long in the heart of the afflicted person,and is not released easily), difficult (which is more hostile, longer-lasting,and directed against those it should not be, and which is not released until theone experiencing this kind of wrath inflicts injury upon an enemy). It seemsclear that Dante here shows the punishment of the first sort of wrath in thecholeric, who are not guilty of sins of violence, but of intemperance. (For thesecond set of sinners punished here, see the next note.) In this interpretation,the third form of anger, which has as its intention physical harm to another, ispunished only in the realm of the violent against others, in Canto XII—where itshould be, and not as a sin of intemperance, which these first two are. [returnto English [part0010.html#c07-s37-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c07-s37-i]]118–126 [part0010.html#c07-s40-e]. Those who are punished under the surface ofthe Styx are, in this formulation (see n. to vv. 109–114), what St. Thomascharacterizes as Aristotle’s second set of the wrathful, the amari, or “bitter.”These people kept their anger in, suffering gravely within themselves (asopposed to the choleric, quick to vent their anger in insults and blows).Dante’s inventive representation of this kind of wrath shows its exemplars asexperiencing the “muddy” or “smoky” sensation of stifled anger.

[part0010.html#c08-s01-e] For the first time the poet interrupts thechronological flow of his narrative, interpolating events that occurred beforethe situation described in the very last verse of the preceding canto (for abriefer but similar interpolation see the first tercet of the thirteenth canto).The first 81 lines of Canto VIII relate what occurred between the travelers’first experience of the wrathful sinners in the Styx (VII.129) and their arrivalat the foot of a tower of the walled city of Dis (VII.130). The self-consciousinterruption of the narrative may be enough to account for the self-consciousopening verse: “To continue, let me say …” However, Boccaccio, in his commentaryto this canto, was the first to sponsor the idea that in fact Dante only now, inLunigiana in 1306, took up again the composition of his poem, begun in Florencebefore his exile and left behind when he could not return to the city. Accordingto Boccaccio, a friend brought him the text of the first seven cantos, which hadlain fallow for some six or seven years. While most do not credit this versionof the history of composition of the Comedy, it has some support. See Ferretti(Ferr.1935.1) and Padoan (Pado.1993.1). The latter’s book is devoted to areassessment of the problem of the compositional history of the entire poem. Inhis view, Inferno was composed between 1306 and 1315, while most students of theproblem argue for a completion of the first cantica around 1310. [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c08-s01-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c08-s01-i]]4–6. [part0010.html#c08-s02-e] This mysterious signaling almost certainlyrefers to the defensive maneuvers of the demonic guardians of hell. Perhaps thefires of the defenders of Dis atop this tower are a warning to those fartheralong the wall—or at least some think so. Thus the two flames set out here wouldwarn against a force of two enemies, and the answering flame would seem toacknowledge that warning. Yet the primary purpose of the two flames would seemto be to summon Phlegyas (see n. to v. 19) to capture and deliver a soul intobondage. (In this second interpretation, the twin flames do not necessarilyindicate the number of interlopers.) Such a view encourages some to believe thatMinos hurls the wrathful into the Styx, whence they are retrieved and givenproper station by Phlegyas, whose business in the muddy river is not to ferrysouls across and into Dis, but to place them in the river, as Caretti(Care.1951.2), p. 6, believes. That solution, however, would imply that thesignals from the tower would be deployed each time a wrathful soul is sent down,and that seems improbable. A possible way out is offered by the hypothesis thatPhlegyas’s function is to round up escaping wrathful souls should they attemptto flee the mud. In such a case, the demons of Dis would assist a fellow demonto wreak pain upon the damned. But then why do the demons signal other demonsalong the wall? Or are the fires answered by still other demons at Phlegyas’s“boathouse”? The details are sparse enough to make a final resolution next toimpossible.

[part0010.html#c08-s03-e] Dante’s three questions are not reallyanswered by Virgil, who does not say exactly what the twinned flame signifies,does not say at all what the second means in answer, and similarly ignores thequestion of agency with respect to the second flame. He does imply thatPhlegyas’s skiff is what the custodians of the first flame summoned. [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c08-s03-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c08-s03-i]]15. [part0010.html#c08-s05-e] Padoan, in his commentary, points out thatPhlegyas’s skiff is not large, like Charon’s, but small, an infernal speedboat,as it were, meant for the pursuit of individuals and not intended for ferryingcrowds of souls across a river.

[part0010.html#c08-s06-e] Phlegyas, who is not in the least interested inVirgil, would seem to believe that Dante is a condemned soul who is trying toescape. As Padoan points out in his commentary to this verse, Dante elsewhereseveral times uses the adjective fello (here translated as “damned”) so as toassociate it with wrath (see Inf. XVII.132; XXI.72; Par. IV.15). [return toEnglish [part0010.html#c08-s06-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c08-s06-i]]19. [part0010.html#c08-s07-e] “Son of Mars and King of Orchomenos in Boeotia,father of Ixion and Coronis; the latter having been violated by Apollo, by whomshe became the mother of Aesculapius, Phlegyas in fury set fire to the temple ofApollo at Delphi, for which sacrilege he was slain by the god and condemned toeternal punishment in the lower world” (T). In the Aeneid (VI.618–620) he ismentioned by the Sibyl as now, in Tartarus, warning against such temerityagainst the gods.

[part0010.html#c08-s07-e] Virgil’s mocking response makes it seemlikely that Phlegyas does at times intervene in the capture and punishment ofdamned souls, if not under what precise conditions he does so.

[part0010.html#c08-s08-e] The brief simile establishes the fact thatPhlegyas feels he has been tricked into thinking that he had been summoned to dohis usual task. As we have seen, exactly what that is remains something of amystery. Yet why would other demons have chosen to trick him? Or is the readerto infer a divine plan behind his summons? This last detail, like so many inthis part of the narrative (vv. 3–24), raises more questions than it answers.[return to English [part0010.html#c08-s08-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c08-s08-i]]25–30. [part0010.html#c08-s09-e] For the relation of this moment, so clearlymodeled on Aeneas’s stepping into Charon’s skiff in Aeneid VI.413–414, toDante’s version of that scene at the close of Inferno III, see the note to v.136 of that canto.

[part0010.html#c08-s11-e] This is the first time in the poem that wehear an angry debate between the protagonist and one of the sinners. These areoften, as here, couched in a form reminiscent of tenzoni, poems in the lowlanguage of streetwise insult, that were a popular pastime of thirteenth-centuryItalian poets, including Dante. “Pure” tenzoni were usually sonnets. The secondparticipant usually responded to the insults of the first with the same rhymescheme (and often the identical rhyme words) deployed by the original attacker.Dante’s adaptation of the technique in Inferno reveals its roots in this form.[return to English [part0010.html#c08-s11-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c08-s11-i]]32. [part0010.html#c08-s11-e] This is Filippo Argenti. See n. to v. 61, below.[return to English [part0010.html#c08-s11-e] / Italian[part0018.html#c08-s11-i]]37. [part0010.html#c08-s13-e] Casagrande (Casa.1978.1), p. 249, cites apassage in Hugh of St. Victor to explain Dante’s curse and Filippo’s weeping:“It is a misery to him who, bitter of mind because he cannot exact revenge uponhis superior, must take satisfaction in his own tears.” [return to English[part0010.html#c08-s13-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c08-s13-i]]40–45. [part0010.html#c08-s14-e] After Virgil thrusts Filippo Argenti (see n.to v. 61) back into the Styx, fending off his attempted wrathful assault, hecongratulates Dante for his harsh words to this sinner (vv. 37–39). His wordsare reminiscent of those spoken of Christ in Luke 11:27: “Blessed is the wombthat bore you.” Sinclair (Sinc.1939.1, p. 119) cites a biblical text as being inconcert with the spirit of the protagonist’s righteous indignation here: “Do notI hate them, O Lord, that hate you … I hate them with perfect hatred: I countthem my enemies” (Psalms 139:21–22). In his commentary to Inferno XX.28–30 Guidoda Pisa put this thought in the following terms: “The suffering of the damnedshould move no one to compassion, as the Bible attests. And the reason for thisis that the time for mercy is here in this world, while in the world to come itis time only for justice.” [return to English [part0010.html#c08-s14-e] /Italian [part0018.html#c08-s14-i]]46. [part0010.html#c08-s16-e] Some read Filippo’s pridefulness as being his“real” sin, and not wrath. Wrath is his besetting vice, but many others may comeinto play in him or in any sinner. The notion that our disposition to sin mustbe unitary has no base either in medieval ethical treatises or in ordinary humanexperience.

[part0010.html#c08-s21-e] From the cries of others the reader finallylearns the name of this sinner (Dante has known exactly who he is—see v. 39).Filippo Argenti was a Black Guelph from a powerful Florentine family. His realname was Filippo Adimari de’ Cavicciuoli, but he supposedly was known as FilippoArgenti because he had his horse’s hooves shod in silver (argento). A number ofearly commentators relate that his brother, Boccaccino, got hold of Dante’spossessions when the poet was exiled. If that is true, we have here a prettyclear case of authorial revenge upon a particularly hated enemy. See FrancescoForti, “Filippo Argenti,” ED, vol. 2, 1970, pp. 873–76.

Perhaps no other literary text contains as manycases of direct address to its readership. The net effect is to forge arelationship between us and the author that makes us partners in his enterprise.His most usual tactic is to ask us to share in the strong emotions heexperienced at any given moment; on other occasions he invites us to interpretthings difficult to understand. In all cases we feel drawn into the poem, asthough we were witnessing what the poet describes ourselves or being asked toshare with him the difficulty of interpreting his materials. See discussions inGmelin (Gmel.1951.1), Auerbach (Auer.1954.1), and Spitzer (Spit.1955.1). And seethe article of Vittorio Russo, “appello al lettore,” ED, vol. 1, 1970, pp.324–26, for a listing: Inf. VIII.94–96; IX.61–63; XVI.127–132; XX.19–24;XXII.118; XXV.46–48; XXXIV.22–27; Purg. VIII.19–21; IX.70–72; X.106–111;XVII.1–9; XXIX.97–105; XXXI.124–126; XXXIII.136–138; Par. II.1–18; V.109–114;X.7–27; XIII.1–21; XXII.106–111. Thus there are seven in each of the first twocantiche and at least five in Paradiso. However, and as Russo points out, theremay be seven in the third cantica as well, since the passage at IX.10–12 mayalso be included and that at X.7–27 perhaps should be seen as two separateaddresses (7–15 and 22–27).The addresses are a subgroup of the classical rhetorical figure of apostrophe(direct address), which is amply used by this poet. For discussion see thearticle “apostrofe” by Francesco Tateo, ED, vol. 1, 1970, pp. 319–21. Anothersubdivision of apostrophe in addition to addressing one’s reader is found in theinvocations of the Comedy. See note to Inferno II.7–9. There are nine of thesein the poem.

[part0010.html#c08-s33-e] In their commentary Casini/Barbi insist that,on the model of several biblical passages (e.g., the just man who falls seventimes, rising again each time, of Prov. 24:16), the “seven times” is to be takenas indeterminate. They go on to list eight times that Virgil has come to Dante’said: Inferno I.49, II.130, III.94, V.21, VI.22, VII.8, VIII.19, VIII.41.

[part0010.html#c08-s35-e] Virgil’s reassurance of an understandablyshaken Dante, given the strength of opposition from the fallen angels, relies onthe promise of divine support made to him, apparently, by Beatrice in the scenereported in Inferno II.

[part0010.html#c08-s36-e] For the first time since he began hisguidance, Virgil feels able to leave Dante to his own devices. The next timethat he does so (Inf. XVI.37–39) his pupil will even be allowed to visit a groupof sinners unguided. Both these moments, in ascending order, reveal theprotagonist’s growing capacity to deal with sin.

[part0010.html#c08-s39-e] For the first time in his role as guide,Virgil suffers defeat in an attempt to gain Dante access to the next stage ofthe journey.

His main evidence for believing thathe will be able to continue is drawn from his witness of the harrowing of hell,of which he gave notice in Inferno IV.52–63. J. S. Carroll, in his comment toInferno III.1–9, looks ahead to these verses and cites the apocryphal Gospel ofNicodemus, chapters 13–19, in which the hosts of hell attempted to blockChrist’s harrowing as source for the attempt of these new rebels to keep Virgilout of their kingdom.

[part0010.html#c08-s43-e] The nature of this descending messengerwill be discussed in the note to Inferno IX.85. Musa (Musa.1974.1), p. 150,argues that this descent should put us in mind of the descent of the prophesiednova progenies (new race) of Virgil’s fourth Eclogue, v. 7.How does Virgil know that such aid is coming? Some argue that he “sees” it inhis mind; others that Beatrice had promised exactly such help if ever it wereneeded when she spoke to Virgil in Limbo (Inf. II).

Seeingthis, Virgil tries to compose his own features. In Canto VIII.121 Virgil wasangry, and this fact leads many commentators to believe that the color in hisface now is still the red flush of anger. On the other hand, others believe (andover the centuries there are roughly as many of one opinion as of the other)that Virgil’s new color just now is the pallor of frustration and shame. Eitherreading is possible, but red is probably the better choice, especially since wethen have the dramatic contrast between white-cheeked Dante and red-facedVirgil.

The overall sense of the tercet is, however,probably clear enough: “we must win this fight unless (I did not understand whatBeatrice told me)…No, what she said must be true; but I wish the promised helpfrom heaven would get here.” Musa’s remark on the passage bears repeating(Musa.1974.1, p. 73): “because during his lifetime [Virgil] could not believe inthe coming of Christ, so now he can not believe in the coming of the angel—inspite of his having learned from Beatrice that the Pilgrim’s journey is willedin Heaven.” In other words, Virgil, condemned to hell for not having had faith,repeats that error even now.

[part0010.html#c09-s04-e] A fairly rare example of an interpretiveexercise embedded in the poetic text itself, Dante as glossator of Virgil’swords and presenter of his own understanding as he heard them.

[part0010.html#c09-s06-e] The “first circle” is Limbo, where Virgil andthe other virtuous heathens have their eternal resting place, and where, in hisown words, “without hope we live in longing” (Inf. IV.42). [return to English[part0010.html#c09-s06-e] / Italian [part0018.html#c09-s06-i]]19–27. [part0010.html#c09-s07-e] Erichtho’s conjuration of Virgil may be thesingle most outrageous example of the utter liberty Dante at times employs inhis treatment of classical literature. No such tale exists in any other textbefore Dante’s, nor anything like it. While many point to the similar statementmade by the Sibyl, hoping to reassure Aeneas that she has been shown by Hecate(Proserpina) the places of the underworld (Aen. VI.562–565), no one has comeclose to finding a source for a Virgilian journey to the depths of hell underthe spell of Erichtho. This Thessalian witch appears in a crucial role inLucan’s Pharsalia, the later poet’s rather nasty version of Virgil’s more benignSibyl. In a lengthy episode in the sixth book (vv. 507–830) of Lucan’s poem, abook with evident parallels to the descent to the underworld in the Aeneid,replete with Sibyl-like guide in the person of Erichtho, the witch holds centerstage. Serving the curiosity of Sextus Pompeius, son of the great Pompey, one ofthe major republican opponents of Caesar in the civil war, she agrees toforetell the outcome of the war by practicing her necromantic art on the corpseof a recently slain soldier. What the soldier tells is hardly pleasant news, butis hardly complete, either. He does make plain to Sextus that the ghost of hisfather will come to him in Sicily (VI.812–813) in order to reveal still more(but Lucan committed suicide by Nero’s order before finishing the poem, and thescene was not written). It is out of these materials that Dante has concoctedhis idiosyncratic tale.And what is it that Erichtho wanted? In Lucan’s poem (VI.586–587) we learn thather greatest desire is to be able to mangle the corpses of Julius Caesar (thepoem is set before the murder of Caesar—44 B.C.) and of Pompey. Virgil died in19 B.C. As he says in this narrative, Erichtho called him (like the youngsoldier in Lucan’s poem, only recently dead) back into his body shortly after hedied and sent him down to the ninth Circle, Judecca. Why? Those who have writtenon this problem have not developed any hypothesis to account for her motive. YetDante surely would have given her one in the myth that he was constructing. OrVirgil is simply making up a tall story in order to give himself authority—adubious hypothesis embraced by some.We know from Lucan that Erichtho had an unfulfilled ambition, to ravage thecorpses of Caesar and Pompey. Where are these located in Dante? Caesar is inLimbo; of Pompey we hear little, and nothing about his station in the afterlife.However, it is at least possible that Dante is playing a game with his readerhere. As a co-conspirator of Brutus and Cassius, would Pompey not naturally havebeen punished along with them? That seems possible. Whatever justification weseek for this strange tale of Virgil’s first visit to the realm of the damned,we probably should try to find it in the pages of Lucan. (See Holl.1980.1, pp.178–80.)Boccaccio was the first and perhaps lone discussant (in his commentary to Inf.IX.25–27) to think of the only biblical tale that contains similar elements (andwas surely familiar to Dante), the story of Saul’s visit to the witch of Endor,who calls up the spirit of Samuel for Saul; the latter—in a scene more powerfulthan even anything in Lucan—foretells Saul’s death and the defeat of theIsraelites at the hands of the Philistines (I Samuel 28:3–25).

It seems more likely that the ira (“wrath”)referred to is the righteous anger of the forces of God (namely, the angel whois now approaching) rather than the wrath the travelers will encounter in theforces defending the City of Dis, as Boccaccio believes, or the “wrath” theymust employ in order to enter the city (the view of most of the earlycommentators).

In Virgil, as in Greekmyth, these three sisters are punishers of crimes of blood. Dante sees them asthe handmaids of Proserpina (or Hecate), the queen of hell.

SeeOvid, Metamorphoses IV.606–V.249.

VIII.94–96). This one has caused moredifficulty than any other, and “solutions” are so abundant that it is fair tosay that none has won general consent, from the first commentators’ exertionsuntil today. Opinions are divided, first of all, on whether the passage pointsback in the text, either primarily to Medusa (seen as despair, heresy, thehardened will, etc.) or to the Furies (seen as sin itself, or the three maincategories of sin punished in hell [incontinence, violence, fraud], or remorse,etc.), or to a combination of these. Those who believe that the passage invitesthe reader rather to look forward than back are in accord that it refers to theavenging intruder who is about to appear in order to open the locked gates ofDis; but there is great debate over exactly what the one “sent from heaven” (v.85) signifies (see discussion, below). Surely it seems more natural for thereference to point backwards to something already said. And indeed somethingnoteworthy and perhaps puzzling has just occurred: Virgil has covered Dante’seye-covering hands with his own hands as well. If this passage (vv. 58–60) isthe one that contains a hidden doctrine (and few commentators believe it is, butsee Hollander [Holl.1969.1], pp. 239–46), perhaps what it suggests is that stoicrestraint is not enough to keep a sinner safe from dangerous temptation (i.e.,Dante, had she appeared, would have looked upon Medusa and been turned to stone,just as Ulysses would have listened to the Sirens and been destroyed by them hadhe not been restrained by other forces).

In the first of these the Trojan forces mount an impetuouscounterattack upon the Greek invaders of their city; in the second the forces ofAeneas begin the eventually victorious final attack upon the armies of Turnus.The celestial messenger, though only one in number, has the force of a greatarmy; victory is seconds away.

[part0010.html#c09-s29-e] That this agent of good is “sent from heaven”indicates clearly enough that he is an angel, although debate over his identitystill continues. See Silvio Pasquazi, “Messo celeste,” ED, vol. 3, 1971, makinga strong case for his angelic status and giving a summary of the debate.Pasquazi also argues for one traditional further identification, making themesso specifically the archangel Michael, who led the forces of the good angelsagainst the rebellious ones in the war in heaven (Rev. 12: 7–9)—see n. toInferno VII.10–12—exactly the forces he now must combat once more in thenetherworld. Over the centuries there has been a continuing argument betweenthose who believe that the messo is Mercury and those who believe that he is anangel, and, in some cases, specifically Michael. It seems highly likely thatDante here gives us an archangel Michael “dressed up” as Mercury, a fusedidentity that is not problematic in any way, given Dante’s practice of combiningpagan and Christian materials.

Hisreference to the chaining of Cerberus by Hercules reflects Aeneid VI.392–396.Dante has now been associated with two classical heroes, Theseus (v. 54) andHercules.

[part0010.html#c09-s43-e] Virgil explains to Dante that this sixthCircle of hell encloses many different heretical sects, each of which ispunished in a separate sepulchre, and some of which are punished with more,others with less, severity.Why is heresy punished within the walls of Dis, where all the sins punished aresins of will, not those of appetite? It is interesting to see how often earlycommentators associate heresy with obstinacy or obduracy; their word is theLatin pertinax. Some of them may be reflecting St. Thomas’s definition (S.T.II–II, q. 5, a. 3): if a man “is not pertinacious in his disbelief, he is inthat case no heretic, but only a man in error.” See, among others, thecommentaries of Boccaccio (Inf. IX.127; IX.110–133), Benvenuto (Inf. IX.112–116;IX.127–129), Francesco da Buti (Inf. IX.106–123; X.31–39), John of Serravalle(Inf. X.13–15); Daniello (Inf.

[part0010.html#c09-s44-e] The turnings to the right here and at InfernoXVII.32 have caused puzzlement and some ingenuity. In hell, whenever thedirection of their movement is mentioned, Dante and Virgil elsewhere always headto the left. Only on these two occasions do they move rightward. These tworightward turnings occur just before the entrance to the sixth Circle, in whichheresy is punished, and before the exit from the realm of Violence, the seventhCircle. This is another instance in which the commentary tradition has notresolved Dante’s plan, if indeed there was one.

While in theConvivio (IV.vi.11–12) Dante defines Epicureanism as the pleasure principlewithout speaking of it as specifically heretical, here he falls in with a morestringent Christian view, perhaps echoing St. Paul who, in I Cor. 15:32, citesthe standard tag for Epicureanism, “Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow wedie,” as the unworthy countering view to the Resurrection.

Having expelled the Guelphs from the city in 1248, theGhibellines were themselves expelled in 1258, but, led by Farinata, took revengequickly at the battle of Montaperti in 1260, at which they utterly routed theFlorentine Guelphs and their allies. Subsequently the Ghibellines gathered incouncil at Empoli, where it was proposed that Florence should be destroyed, togeneral acclaim. Farinata was the unyielding force of opposition and eventuallywon the day, saying that he would fight alone with sword in hand to prevent thisoutcome. The Florentines did not show great appreciation of his acts and nevermade any exception for his family in their dealings with the various eventualGhibelline exiles. Farinata died in Florence in 1264.

[part0011.html#c10-s18-e] The interruption of the discourse betweenDante and Farinata will last for seven tercets, until Farinata, “on hold” whilethis other drama is played out, will continue the conversation as though therehad been no interruption to it.The far less imposing figure who rises out of the same tomb alongside Farinata,Cavalcante de’ Cavalcanti (died ca. 1280), was a wealthy Florentine Guelph andthe father of Dante’s former “first friend” (see VN III.14, XXIV.6, XXX.3),Guido Cavalcanti. Since Guido was alive at the imagined date of Dante’s journey,he cannot be found in the afterworld. However, his reputation as a “materialist”makes it seem at least likely that Dante was certain that this aristocratic andindependent-minded poet and thinker was coming right here to join his father. Itis not accidental that the entire conversation between the father and his son’sformer friend concerns that son. If Farinata believes in family and party,Cavalcante is the archetypal doting father. Their portraits, showing them insuch different lights, are perhaps the finest example we have of such close,contrastive “portraiture” in verse since the classical era. See the study ofErich Auerbach (Auer.1957.1).One of the finest lyric poets of his time, Guido Cavalcanti was from six to tenyears older than Dante. He was married by his family to a woman named Beatrice,in fact the daughter of Farinata. In other words, these two hereticalFlorentines, Guido’s father, Cavalcante, and Farinata, are in-laws; it isnotable that, divided by party loyalty as they are, they do not speak to oneanother. Guido was an ardent Guelph, siding with the Whites (Dante’s party also)when the Guelphs divided into two factions. He had a street brawl with theleader of the Black Guelphs, Corso Donati, who had once tried to kill him. “Inthe summer of 1300, during Dante’s priorate (June 15–Aug. 15), it was decided(June 24), in order to put an end to the disturbances caused by the continuedhostilities between the two factions, to banish the leaders of both sides,…amongthose who approved this decision being Dante, in his capacity as Prior. It thuscame about that Dante was instrumental in sending his own friend into exile,and, as it proved, to his death; for though the exiles were recalled veryshortly after the expiry of Dante’s term of office (Aug. 15), so that Guido onlyspent a few weeks at Sarzana, he never recovered from the effects of themalarious climate of the place, and died in Florence at the end of August inthat same year; he was buried in the cemetery of Santa Reparata on Aug. 29 …”(T). One might wish to consider the fact that Farinata the Ghibelline and Guidothe Guelph had been banished by the priors of Florence, Farinata in 1258,Cavalcanti in 1300. And mindful of the afterlives of these two exiles is theexiled Dante Alighieri, former prior, now himself exiled by the priors of thecity.

[part0011.html#c10-s20-e] Dante’s phrase, “cieco carcere” (dark prison),has long been considered an echo of the same words in Virgil’s Latin, carcerecaeco, at Aen. VI.734.

[part0011.html#c10-s20-e] The phrase “per altezza d’ingegno” (by virtue ofyour lofty genius) is clearly meant to remind us of the similar phrase we heardin Dante’s first invocation: “O Muse, o alto ingegno” (O Muses, O loftygenius—Inf. II.7). However, how we are to interpret the resemblance is noteasily resolved. Those who believe that in the first passage Dante was invokinghis own poetic powers see in Cavalcanti’s doting father’s reaction a simplesense of rivalry: which of these two poets is more gifted? If, on the otherhand, we believe that Dante, in the invocation, calls for aid from a HigherPower (see note to Inf. II.7–9), then the father’s question indicates that hedoesn’t understand, materialist that he is, the nature of true Christian poeticinspiration. His son’s genius and that inspiring Dante are not commensurable.[return to English [part0011.html#c10-s20-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c10-s20-i]]60. [part0011.html#c10-s20-e] Cavalcanti’s mournful question about his son’swhereabouts has put some commentators (perhaps the first was Daniello, in 1568)in mind of Andromache’s equally mournful question about the whereabouts of herhusband Hector, “Hector ubi est?” (Where is Hector?—Aen. IV.312). But seeDurling (Durl.1981.2), p. 25n., arguing for the resonance of Genesis 4:9: “Ubiest Abel frater tuus?” (Where is Abel your brother?) Durling points out thatboth these “fratricidal” stories culminate in an exile, Cain sent forth from theland a fugitive (Gen. 4:12–16), while Guido was literally sent into exile by theaction of Dante and the five other priors of Florence.

It should be noted that our translation is interpretive; the Italian canmean either what we have said it does or else “whom perhaps your Guido held inscorn.” The text thus either indicates that Guido at a certain point perhapsscorned the work of Virgil or else withdrew his approval of Dante’s love ofBeatrice, to whom perhaps Dante is being led, as Virgil has promised him (Inf.I.122–123).

[part0011.html#c10-s23-e] The father’s premature lament for his livingson (but he will be dead in four months) in this searing tercet obviouslycollects the difficult thoughts and feelings of the poet as well. There has beena great deal written about the use of the past definite (“elli ebbe” [he had])and its possible consequences. Why did Dante say that (v. 63)? Had Guido scornedsomeone habitually, the use of the imperfect would have been more likely. Thosewho believe that his scorn was for Virgil (roughly half of those who involvethemselves in this quarrel) are right to be puzzled, for such a scornful view ofthe Latin poet would not seem to have been a sudden shift of attitude (and, infact, there is no Virgilian element in any of Guido’s poems). An attractivealternative explanation is given by Siro Chimenz in his commentary: at a certainpoint in his relations with Dante, and at least after Beatrice’s death, whenDante continued to write of her, Guido did come to have disdain for Dante’sloyalty to Beatrice. In short, Dante the protagonist is thinking of Guido’sclimactic “rejection” of Beatrice as a definite past event, one perhapsprecisely reflected in a sonnet Guido wrote to Dante expressing his disgust withhis former friend.

[part0011.html#c10-s25-e] Farinata’s stoic restraint is evident onceagain; he has been waiting for Dante’s attention to return to him in order tocontinue their difficult conversation about Florentine politics. Unmoved andunmoving, he is the exemplification of the “stone man” admired by Stoicphilosophers. He is “great-souled” (magnanimo), a quality of the highest kind inAristotle’s formulation in the Ethics, but connected, even in classical times,with a fear that such a man may also be prideful. See Scott (Scot.1977.1), pp.13–45, for the double valence of the term, which becomes still less evenpotentially positive in the works of Christian writers.

[part0011.html#c10-s26-e] Farinata, more human in his secondconversation, admits his sense of frustration in his family’s politicalmisfortune; it is, he says, worse torment even than damnation. We may reflectthat, in the universe of this poem, there is no worse torment than damnation.Nonetheless, Farinata exudes a certain selfless concern for his family.

[part0011.html#c10-s27-e] Bested by Dante’s last riposte, Farinata nowgets even with a prophecy: within fifty months (fifty moons; Proserpina, themoon, is traditionally referred to as queen of hell) Dante himself will know thepain of exile. There surely seems to be fellow-feeling joined to the bleakpromise. By July 1304—roughly fifty months from March 1300—the last efforts ofthe Whites to reenter the city were over and done with (Dante had already givenup on their efforts), and Dante knew his exile was, for all intents andpurposes, limitless.

[part0011.html#c10-s29-e] Dante’s answer offers the perhaps sole locusin this canto that directly relates heresy and politics—and surely the readerhas wondered what the connection must be. The “prayers” in the church that herefers to are words uttered in vituperative political councils, thus creating animage of political intrigue, even if of Guelph against Ghibelline, as a form ofdeformed “religious” activity. Florence seems a city in which politics hasbecome the state religion.The Arbia is a river near the site of the battle of Montaperti.

[part0011.html#c10-s30-e] Farinata’s last words on the subject of theFlorentine past remind his auditor that he was no more guilty than the rest ofthe Ghibellines (and many of them have been allowed to return) and that,further, at the council of Empoli (see note to vv. 22–24), he was alone indefending the city from destruction. There is no question but that Dante’s viewof Farinata is complex. As hard as he is on him, there is also great admirationfor some of his qualities as leader, and for his having stood alone, andsuccessfully, in defense of the city. The drama of Ghibellinism for Dante is acentral one; what these people want to accomplish politically is not in itselfanathema to him—far from it; that they wish to achieve their aims without God iswhat destroys their credentials as politicians and as human beings.

On the other hand, for the view that this condition pertainsonly to the heretics see Cassell (Cass.1984.1), pp. 29–31. But see Alberigo, hissoul already in hell yet not knowing how or what its body is doing in the worldabove (Inf. XXXIII.122–123). And see note to Inf.

[part0011.html#c10-s37-e] Dante excuses his “fault”: until Farinataexplained things, he assumed the damned were aware of present events. Given thehistorical situation between the poet and Cavalcanti, it is not surprising thatthe author stages the drama of his understandable guilt at his role in Guido’sdeath in this somewhat strained way.

I.3) and then occurs again (Inf.XV.50) with specific reference to his lostness at the outset of the journey forthe last time in the poem. It is also used in such a way as to remind us of hisinitial situation in Inf. II.64, V.72, and XIII.24; in the last two of thesescenes the protagonist is feeling pity for sinners, emotion that the poet fairlyclearly considers inappropriate.

That role, so clearlyreserved for Beatrice, is eventually given to Cacciaguida in Par. XVII.46–75.The apparent contradiction has caused much consternation. An ingenious solutionhas been proposed by Marguerite Mills Chiarenza (Chia.1985.1): just as in theAeneid Helenus promises Aeneas that the Sibyl will reveal his future to him(Aen. III.458–460) only to have her instead lead him to Anchises, who performsthat promised task (VI.756–886), so in the Comedy also the promised female“prophet” is replaced by a male.

[part0011.html#c11-s03-e] Dante may have confused Pope Anastasius II(496–98) with the emperor Anastasius I (491–518). In the commentaries there isalso a question as to whether Dante’s Photinus was a deacon of Thessalonica orthe bishop of Sirmium. Further, the grammatical structure of the passage wouldallow us to understand either that Photinus misled Anastasius into heresy or washimself thus misled by the pope. A passage in Isidore of Seville, if it happensto be Dante’s direct or indirect source, resolves two of these three issues.Isidore is speaking of the various kinds of heresy (Etymologiae VIII.v.37).According to him, the Photinians are named after Photinus the bishop of Sirmium,who followed the Ebionite heresy (see Etym. VIII.v.36) in promulgating thenotion that Jesus was born from the natural union of Joseph and Mary. And thusit was Photinus who misled the pope, since this very heresy is named after him.The more usual view in the commentaries is that the Photinus in question was thedeacon of Thessalonica, a follower of Acacius, but this is probably not thebetter interpretation.

[part0011.html#c11-s04-e] Dante, as though speaking through Virgil tohis reader, would seem to be admitting that this canto is not nearly as excitingas those that have gone before (and those that will come after), since itinvolves nothing but pedantic lecturing. In his little joke the excuse for hisreader-unfriendly behavior is that the protagonist’s olfactory powers required arest so that they might become accustomed to the stench of lower hell. Noexperiential learning being possible, the class had to retire to the schoolroom.Virgil’s discourse is thus presented as little more than filler—even if thereader realizes that the canto has no lesser purpose than that of establishing asystem for the organization of the sins of humankind. [return to English[part0011.html#c11-s04-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c11-s04-i]]22–27. [part0011.html#c11-s08-e] Perhaps the key passage for our understandingof the organization of lower hell. All sins punished therein are sins ofmalizia, malice, in the sense that these sinners all willfully desire to do harm(the incontinent may indeed end up doing harm to others or to themselves, buttheir desire is for another kind of gratification altogether). Heresy, becauseit lies within the iron walls of Dis, and is thus also punished as a sin of thewill rather than of the appetite (surely it seems closer to malice than toappetite), is perhaps less readily considered a desire to harm others (eventhough it assuredly, to Dante’s mind, does so). Ingiuria has thus both its Latinmeaning, injustice, acting in opposition to the law (iniuria), and its othermeaning, the doing of harm. As Mazzoni (Mazz.1985.1, p. 14) points out, Daniellowas the first commentator explicitly to link this passage with its almostcertain source in Cicero (De officiis I.xiii.41), a passage that defines iniuriaas having two modes, force or fraud, with fraud meriting the greater hatred.Here malice is divided into two subgroups, force (violence) and fraud. Frauditself will shortly be divided into two subgroups (see note to vv. 61–66); butfor now Dante has only divided the sins of violence (Cantos XII–XVII) and fraud(Cantos XVIII–XXXIV) into these two large groups. On malizia see Mazzoni, pp.10–14; he demonstrates that for Dante, following St. Thomas, malice reflectsvoluntas nocendi, the will to do harm. For a revisionist view of the entirequestion see Cogan (Coga.1999.1). [return to English [part0011.html#c11-s08-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c11-s08-i]]28–33. [part0011.html#c11-s10-e] Virgil divides the sins of violence(synonymous with those of force) into three subsidiary “rings” (gironi). Theseare, in order of their gravity, violence against God (Cantos XIV–XVII), againstone’s self (Canto XIII), and against one’s neighbor (Canto XII). [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c11-s10-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c11-s10-i]]34–39. [part0011.html#c11-s12-e] Now, in the order in which we witness them,Virgil describes the three categories of the sin of violence more fully, hereviolence against others, whether directed against their persons or theirproperty (Canto XII). [return to English [part0011.html#c11-s12-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c11-s12-i]]40–45. [part0011.html#c11-s14-e] Those violent against themselves or their ownproperty are in the second ring (Canto XIII).

[part0011.html#c11-s16-e] The third ring encloses those who are violentagainst God by blaspheming him (Canto XIV); “violent” against nature in thecommission of unnatural sexual acts (sodomy, identified by the reference toSodom, punished in Canto XV—see the confirmation at Purg. XXVI.79, where thepenitent homosexuals cry out “Soddoma” against their past sins); violent against“art,” exemplified in the reference to Cahors, the town in southern Francewhich, in the Middle Ages, had become synonymous with usury (see Virgil’sfurther explanation at vv. 97–111). [return to English [part0011.html#c11-s16-e]/ Italian [part0019.html#c11-s16-i]]52–60. [part0011.html#c11-s18-e] Turning at last to fraud, Virgil now dividesit into two kinds, depending on whether or not it is practiced against those whotrust in one or not. He first describes the second and lesser kind, “simplefraud,” as it were, committed by those who are punished in the eighth Circle,which we shall learn (Inf. XVIII.1) is called “Malebolge” after the ten “evilpockets” that contain them (Cantos XVIII–XXX). Here the poet for whatever reason(to keep his readers on their toes?) allows Virgil to name the sins in nodiscernible order, while also omitting two of them: (6) hypocrisy, (2) flattery,(4) divination, (10) counterfeiting, (7) thievery, (3) simony, (1) pandering[and seducing, not mentioned here], (5) barratry (the purchase or sale ofpolitical office); totally omitted from mention are (8) false counsel and (9)schismatic acts.

[part0011.html#c11-s21-e] The second form of fraud, that which seversnot only the tie of affection that is natural to humans but that even moresacred one which binds human beings in special relationships of trust, isreferred to as treachery (v. 66). Such sinners occupy the ninth Circle (CantosXXXI–XXXIV). [return to English [part0011.html#c11-s21-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c11-s21-i]]67–75. [part0011.html#c11-s23-e] Having told Virgil that his discourse hasbeen clear and convincing, the protagonist nonetheless reveals that he has notquite got it; why, he asks, are not the angry and sullen (Canto VIII), thelustful (Canto V), the gluttonous (Canto VI), and the avaricious and prodigal(Canto VII) punished inside the City of Dis if God holds them in his righteousanger? And if He doesn’t, why are they in the state of affliction they are in?Dante has set up his reader with this inattentive question. The protagonistthinks that Virgil’s analysis of God’s wrath at v. 22 makes God hate onlymalizia, and does not understand the relationship between that form of sin andincontinence. [return to English [part0011.html#c11-s23-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c11-s23-i]]76–90. [part0011.html#c11-s26-e] After chastising Dante for his foolishness,Virgil clarifies the situation. Aristotle, he says, in the seventh book of theEthics treats the three dispositions of the soul that Heaven opposes. These areincontinence, malice (the malizia of v. 22), and “mad brutishness” (mattabestialitade). The clarity of this statement should not have left so muchvexation in its wake, but it has. (For a thorough review of the debate and asolution of the problems that caused it see Francesco Mazzoni’s lengthy gloss tothese verses, Mazz.1985.1, pp. 25–45.) “Malice,” just as it did when it wasfirst used, identifies violence and simple fraud; “mad brutishness” refers totreachery. As Mazzoni demonstrates, both in Aristotle and in Thomas’s commentaryon the Ethics (and elsewhere in his work), “bestiality” is one step beyondmalice, just as it is here in Dante; in Thomas’s words it is a “magnum augmentumMalitiae,” i.e., a similar but worse kind of sin. Nonetheless, there are thosewho argue that, since malizia eventually comes to encompass both kinds of fraud(those punished in both the eighth and ninth Circles), matta bestialitade cannotrefer to treachery. Nonetheless, if they were to consider the way in which Dantehas handled his various definitions they might realize that he has done herejust what he has done at vv. 22–24: he identifies “malice” with violence andfraud and then (at vv. 61–66) adds a third category (and second category offraud), treachery, just as he does here. For a strong and helpful summary (inEnglish) of the debate, with arguments similar to and conclusions identical withMazzoni’s, see Triolo (Trio.1998.1), whose own initial work on the subject datesto 1968 (see his bibliographical note).

[part0011.html#c11-s33-e] Weaving strands of Aristotle and St. Thomas,Virgil demonstrates that nature takes her course from the divine mind, and that“art” then follows nature. Humankind, fallen into sin, as is recorded in Genesis(3:17), must earn its bread in the sweat of its brow, precisely by following therules of nature and whatever craft it practices. And for this reason usurers areunderstood as sinning against nature, God’s child, and her child, “art” (in thesense of “craft”), thus the “grandchild” of God and all the more vulnerable tohuman transgression.

[part0011.html#c12-s04-e] “The infamy of Crete” is the Minotaur (onlyidentified by name at v. 25), half man and half bull, conceived by the sexuallyventuresome Pasiphaë (wife of Minos, king of Crete) with a bull, when she placedherself in a wooden replica of a cow in order to enjoy a bovine embrace. SeePurg. XXVI.87 for another reference to her on the Terrace of the purgation oflust. Most modern commentators, but not all, believe that Dante, in a reversalof the classical tradition, gave the Minotaur a man’s head upon a bull’s body.[return to English [part0011.html#c12-s04-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c12-s04-i]]16–21. [part0011.html#c12-s06-e] The Minotaur had his labyrinthine home onCrete, where his violence was kept under some control by feeding to him a yearlytribute from Athens of seven maids and seven youths. Virgil taunts and thusdistracts him, reminding him that he was killed by Theseus, instructed by themonster’s “sister” Ariadne and guided by her thread back through the labyrinth.Since the Minotaur is the first infernal guardian whom we meet within the wallsof Dis (the rebel angels, the Furies, and the unseen Medusa were located on thecity’s ramparts in Canto IX), we might want to consider in what way he isdifferent from those we have met in the Circles of Incontinence—Minos (the“step-father” of the Minotaur, as it were—Canto V), Cerberus (Canto VI), andPlutus (Canto VII). Like Charon (Canto III) and Phlegyas (Canto VIII), Minos hasa general function, “judging” all the damned souls who confess their besettingsins to him (Charon ferries all across Acheron, Phlegyas seems to be employed inreplacing temporarily escaped sinners in the Styx). Thus only Cerberus(gluttony) and Plutus (avarice) would seem to represent a particular sin ofincontinence. The Minotaur (and the matter is much debated) seems to representthe entire zone of Violence, as Geryon (Canto XVI) will represent Fraud and theGiants (Canto XXXI), Treachery. If this hypothesis is correct, then theMinotaur’s function is precisely similar to that of Geryon and of the Giants,and he is the gatekeeper for the entire seventh Circle (see Inf. XII.32). Forhis connection to violence see Boccaccio’s commentary: “When he had grown up andbecome a most ferocious animal, and of incredible strength, they tell that Minoshad him shut up in a prison called the labyrinth, and that he had sent to himthere all those whom he wanted to die a cruel death.” Rossetti’s commentary seesthe Minotaur as being associated with all three sins of violence punished inthis Circle: “The Minotaur, who is situated at the rim of this tripartitecircle, fed, according to myth, on human limbs (violence against one’sneighbor); according to the poem [v. 14] was biting himself (violence againstoneself) and was conceived in the ‘false cow’ (violence against nature, daughterof God).”Surely he is wrathful (this canto has more uses of the word ira [wrath] than anyother: XII.15, XII.33, XII.49, XII.72). As was pointed out in the note to Inf.VII.109–114, the wrath punished in Styx was intemperate wrath, a sin of passionand not of hardened will, while the sin punished here is Aquinas’s third sort ofanger, that which is kept alive for cold-blooded revenge. For a similar opinion,which insists on the distinction between the incontinence of Filippo Argenti andthe intentional, willful behavior that we witness here, see Beck.1984.1, p. 228.[return to English [part0011.html#c12-s06-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c12-s06-i]]22–25. [part0011.html#c12-s08-e] The possible Virgilian source (Aen.II.223–224) of Dante’s simile was perhaps first noted in Tommaseo’s commentary:Laocoön, dying beneath the assault of the twin serpents, bellows like a strickenbull that has momentarily escaped death and is now fleeing from the altarbecause the axe of his executioner has been slightly off target, allowing him afew more minutes of life.

[part0011.html#c12-s11-e] Wrath, punished in the Styx (the fifth Circle)is here distinguished from “bestial” wrath that is the sign of a hardened willto do violence. As was the case in Inf. XI.83 (see note to Inf. XI.76–90) Danteuses the word “bestial” to increase the heinousness of a kind of sin. Wrath is asin of Incontinence; “bestial wrath,” a sin of Violence. Fraud is a sin ofmalice, “mad brutishness” (treachery) a sin of greater malice. [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c12-s11-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c12-s11-i]]34–36.

[part0011.html#c12-s14-e] Virgil’s explanation of what happened in theimmediate aftermath of the Crucifixion shows a correct temporal and physicalunderstanding (he, after all, actually witnessed these phenomena fifty-threeyears after he arrived in Limbo [see Inf. IV.52–63]). However, his use of theGreek poet and philosopher Empedocles (ca. 492–430 B.C.) as authority shows hisingrained pagan way of accounting for one of Christianity’s greatest miracles,Christ’s ransoming of souls committed to hell. According to Empedocles (firstreferred to at Inf. IV.138), in addition to the four elements (earth, water,air, fire) there were two others, and these governed the universe in alternatingmovements of love (concord) and hatred (chaos). As chaos moves toward concord,crowned by love, that very order, momentarily established, at once recedes andmoves back toward chaos. This “circular” theory of history is intrinsicallyopposed to the Christian view, in which Christ’s establishment of love as auniversal principle redeemed history once and for all. In Virgil’s apparentunderstanding, the climactic event in Christian history marked only thebeginning of a (final?) stage of chaos. For an appreciation of the importance ofVirgil’s misunderstanding of the meaning of the Crucifixion see Baldassaro(Bald.1978.1), p. 101. (For Dante’s knowledge of Empedocles’s theories throughAristotle, Albertus Magnus, and St. Thomas see G. Stabile, “Empedocle,” ED [vol.2, 1970], p. 667.)

VII.19–21, XIV.16–18) would seem to identify two of the most immediatecauses of violent acts, cupidity and wrath. See Guido da Pisa’s commentary onthis passage: “the violence that is inflicted on a neighbor arises either fromcupidity or wrath.” [return to English [part0011.html#c12-s17-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c12-s17-i]]56–57. [part0011.html#c12-s19-e] Patrolling the river of blood (identifiedonly later [Inf. XIV.116] as “Phlegethon”) from its bank are the Centaurs. Someearly commentators saw in them a portrait of the bands of mercenary cavalrymenwho were such an important feature of the horrendous wars of Dante’s dividedItaly. As Dante presents them they are seen as replicating their cruel habits ashunters in the world above. The original centaurs, half man and half horse, inGreek myths that came to Dante through various Latin poets, were the “sons” ofIxion and a cloud made to resemble Juno, whom Ixion desired to ravish whenJupiter allowed him entrance to Olympus. His sperm, falling to earth, createdone hundred centaurs (their name reflects their number, “centum,” and their airybeginning, “aura,” or so believed some early commentators, e.g., Guido da Pisa,Pietro di Dante, and John of Serravalle). Their career on earth involvedattempted rape at the wedding feast of Pirithous and Hippodamia, where it wasnecessary for Hercules to intercede in order to disperse them. The centaursrepresent the particular sin of violence to others, turned to God’s use inpunishing those mortals who also sinned in this way.

[part0011.html#c12-s20-e] The centaurs take Virgil and Dante forwandering damned souls and one of them (we learn that this is Nessus at v. 67)challenges them. His words, “Tell us from there. If not, I draw my bow” (Ditelcostinci; se non, l’arco tiro) are probably modeled on Charon’s to the armedfigure of Aeneas (Aen. VI.389): “fare age, quid venias, iam istinc, et comprimegressum” (tell me, even from there, why you come here, and hold your steps).[return to English [part0011.html#c12-s20-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c12-s20-i]]64–66. [part0011.html#c12-s22-e] Virgil accords greater authority to Chironthan to the other centaurs. Dante’s view of him reflects the fact that he wasnot sired by Ixion’s lust, but by the former Olympian-in-chief: “Saturn,enamored of Philyra and fearing the jealousy of his wife, Rhea, changed himselfinto a horse and in this shape begat Chiron, who took the form of a centaur.Chiron educated Achilles, Aesculapius, Hercules, and many other famous Greeks,and Virgil knows at once that, because he is the wisest, he must be the leaderof the band” (Singleton’s commentary). [return to English[part0011.html#c12-s22-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c12-s22-i]]67–69. [part0011.html#c12-s23-e] Nessus, on the other hand, is one of theIxion-begotten centaurs. When he tried to rape Hercules’ wife, Deianira,according to the ninth book of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, the great hero shot himwith a poisoned arrow as Nessus was crossing a stream with Deianira on his back.Dying, the centaur dipped a tunic into his own poisoned blood (thus explainingexactly what Dante means when he says “fashioned of himself his own revenge”)and gave it to Hercules’ wife, telling her that whoever put on that tunic wouldbecome enamored of her. Years later, when Hercules fell in love with Iole,Deianira gave him the tunic. He put it on, experienced excruciating pain, andcommitted suicide to end his agony. Vengeful, Nessus displays his connection toviolence against others, and precisely that “difficult” anger described by St.Thomas (see note to Inf. VII. 109–114).

[part0011.html#c12-s24-e] “Chiron’s bowed head may be intended tosuggest wisdom or an attitude of meditation, as most commentators believe, sincehe was considered to be the wisest of all the centaurs; but it also serves todirect the reader’s gaze to the creature’s breast, where its two natures, humanand bestial, are joined” (Singleton’s commentary). For Chiron as teacher ofAchilles see at least Statius, Achilleid I.118. [return to English[part0011.html#c12-s24-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c12-s24-i]]72. [part0011.html#c12-s24-e] Pholus, like Nessus, and unlike Chiron, whoseviolence is tempered (and thus made more effective?) by reason, has no betternature to recommend him. He, begotten by Ixion like Nessus, like Nessus died atthe hands of Hercules in most of the various Latin versions of the tale thatDante knew, but as the result of an accident: he himself dropped one ofHercules’ poisoned arrows on his foot and died.

[part0011.html#c12-s25-e] Degrees of sinfulness control the depth ofimmersion: sinners are variously swathed in blood up to their eyebrows (v. 103:murderous tyrants); throats (116: murderers); waists (121: plunderers); feet(125: unspecified).Some commentators believe that Dante’s conception of this river of blood wasinfluenced by his experience as a cavalryman at the battle of Campaldino in1289, when the slaughter made the rivulets crossing the terrain run with blood.For a description and analysis of that battle see Oert.1968.1.

[part0011.html#c12-s26-e] Chiron’s remarks are put to the service ofreminding the reader of the uniqueness of this fleshly visitor to hell. The“realism” of the detail (when he is described as moving the bristles of hisbeard with an arrow) has understandably pleased many; it perhaps also forces usto wonder whether the demons of hell have a fleshly or only a spirit presence,for if Dante can move things with his body, apparently Chiron can also—his ownbeard with the nock of an arrow. This question is never confronted by Dante, wholeaves the ontological status of the demons of hell unresolved. [return toEnglish [part0011.html#c12-s26-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c12-s26-i]]88–89.

[part0011.html#c12-s33-e] The “tour” of the river of blood is only nowready to begin, under the guidance of Nessus, perhaps because Ovid had said ofhim that he was “membrisque valens scitusque vadorum” (strong of limb andschooled in fording streams—Metam. IX.108). [return to English[part0011.html#c12-s33-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c12-s33-i]]104. [part0011.html#c12-s35-e] Dante’s negative view of tyrants, seen asserving themselves rather than the state they govern, is also found in Monarchia(III.iv.10). [return to English [part0011.html#c12-s35-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c12-s35-i]]106–111. [part0011.html#c12-s36-e] The first (and worst) group of the violentagainst others are the tyrants, including Alexander the Great and Dionysius theElder of Syracuse. Both these identities are disputed, some modern commentatorsarguing for Alexander of Pherae, some for Dionysius the Younger, the son of theElder. Singleton’s notes to the passage offer convincing support for bothtraditional identifications. On Dante’s view of tyrants see Carp.1998.1.Ezzelino III da Romano (1194–1259), Ghibelline strongman in the March of Trevisoin northern Italy, was, in Guelph eyes, a monster of cruelty. (See GiovanniVillani’s account of his misdeeds, cited by Singleton.) He is coupled with aGuelph, Òpizzo II d’Este (1247–93), lord of Ferrara and a supporter of theFrench forces in Italy and of the pope. His violence was rewarded in life by hismurder at the hands of either his own and “denatured” son or his illegitimate(“natural”) offspring (the commentators are divided). [return to English[part0011.html#c12-s36-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c12-s36-i]]114–115. [part0011.html#c12-s38-e] In handing Dante over to Nessus, Virgildoes not tell him to “mount up.” Yet this is what we should almost certainlyunderstand is happening. The rest of the canto, up to its final two lines, takesplace with Dante looking down from Nessus’s back (see note to v. 126). This isalmost clear when we consider the next verse: “A little farther on the centaurstopped.” Up to now the movements of Dante and Virgil have been noted as theymade their way along; now it is the centaur’s movement which is recorded. Why?Because Dante is sitting on his back. Why did Dante handle this part of thejourney so delicately? Perhaps because he was aware that the scene would havebeen “outrageous,” a Dante on horseback in hell, too much for a reader to acceptif merely told. In this formulation the poet once again invites the reader tobecome his accomplice in making his fiction. (For discussion see Holl.1984.1.)[return to English [part0011.html#c12-s38-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c12-s38-i]]116–120. [part0011.html#c12-s39-e] This slightly less bloodied crew contains“mere” murderers, only one of whom is indicated (by periphrasis): Guy deMontfort (1243–98), of royal English blood, in order to avenge his fatherSimon’s murder killed his cousin, Henry of Cornwall in a church at Viterbo in1271, supposedly while Henry was praying during the elevation of the Host.Henry’s heart, returned to England, “still drips with blood” because his murderwas not avenged.

[part0011.html#c12-s41-e] Those who rise higher from the blood aregenerally understood to be the non-murderous violent. It seems likely that theircounterpart group, perhaps 180 degrees across the river, is the final onereferred to before the end of the canto (vv. 134–137). Dante recognizes many ofthe present group, thus perhaps asking us to understand that they are localTuscan ruffians.

[part0011.html#c12-s42-e] Although those who merely stand in bloodare not further identified in any way, we may assume that they were the leastdestructive of those violent against the property of others, perhaps pickpocketsand others of that ilk.

[part0011.html#c12-s43-e] As he crosses toward the far side of theriver (the one nearer to the center of hell) Nessus looks back over the areathey have traversed (to their right), where the river grew increasingly shallow,and then looks left, where, he knows, the riverbed gradually deepens until itreaches its lowest point, which coincides with the first place Dante saw, thatin which the tyrants are punished. This information suggests that Dante andVirgil have traversed a semicircle in order to reach this shallowest point,where they have forded the river. The unexplored run of the river thus alsooccupies 180 degrees of the circle. [return to English [part0011.html#c12-s43-e]/ Italian [part0019.html#c12-s43-i]]133–138. [part0011.html#c12-s45-e] The only group referred to in thatunexplored bend of the river includes those whose violence was limited toproperty, the group parallel in placement to the third group seen by Dante inhis journey along Phlegethon. This new group is situated roughly halfway alongthe untraversed semicircle. The five identified personages that he has alreadyseen in the one he has traveled are in parallel with the five he will only heardescribed: Attila the Hun (ca. 406–53), Pyrrhus of Epirus (ca. 318–272 B.C.),and Sextus Pompeius Magnus (d. 35 B.C.), the son of Pompey the Great, who,according to Lucan, disgraced the family name when he turned pirate (PharsaliaVI.119–122). The identities of the last two are sometimes disputed; one reasonto think that they are as given here is that the resulting group of exemplaryplunderers has in common its depredations of Rome. For a brief and clearrepresentation of the various confusions among potential identities for Pyrrhusand Sextus see Botterill (Bott.1990.1), p. 156.

That one third of the borders of Dante’s cantos are so fluid helps usto understand that he has a strong sense of delineation of the units of thewhole and, at the same time, a desire not to be restrained by these borders.[return to English [part0011.html#c13-s01-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c13-s01-i]]4–9.

The repetition of the word here seems deliberate, and perhapsinvites us to consider the possibility that the lost soul whom we met in InfernoI was in some way himself suicidal.

[part0011.html#c13-s09-e] This is perhaps the most self-consciously“literary” line in a canto filled with “literariness.” See the elegant essay byLeo Spitzer (Spit.1942.1) for a close analysis of Inferno XIII.

[part0011.html#c13-s11-e] Dante’s hesitant gesture and the sinner’shorrified response reflect closely a scene in the Aeneid in which Aeneassimilarly tears pieces of vegetation from the grave of murdered Polydorus, whofinally cries out in words that are echoed in this sinner’s complaints (Aen.III.22–48). Just before the Greeks overran Troy, Priam sent his son Polydorus tobe raised by the Thracian king Polymnestor, and with him the treasure of Troy.Once the city fell, Polymnestor killed Polydorus, stole the treasure, and hadthe youth’s body cast into the sea.The speaker, we will later learn from the historical details to which he refers(he is never named), is Pier delle Vigne, the chancellor of Frederick II ofSicily and Naples (see note to vv. 58–61). Here he is represented as a “granpruno” (tall thorn-bush), and while the modifying adjective grants him a certaindignity, it also reduces him to the least pleasant of plants. The forest of thesuicides resembles a dense thicket of briar, the only “vegetation” found in hellafter the green meadow of Limbo (Inf. IV.111).

[part0011.html#c13-s16-e] Virgil’s apology to Pier for encouragingDante to pluck a piece of him now clearly evokes the text of the Aeneid, thusadding a dimension to the words he had uttered at vv. 20–21.

[part0011.html#c13-s18-e] Virgil’s invitation to Pier to speak so thatDante may “revive his fame” in the world above has a positive result. As we movedown through hell, we will find that some sinners look upon their “interview”with this “reporter” as a wonderful opportunity to attempt to clear their name,while others shun any “publicity” at all.

[part0011.html#c13-s19-e] The beginning of Pier’s speech is an Italianversion of Pier’s noted “chancery style” of Latin oratory turned todocument-writing. Pier was known not only for his Latin writings on behalf ofFrederick’s exercise of imperial power, but for his vernacular poems, which aresimilarly florid.His speech to Dante, in its entirety, forms an Italian version of a classicaloration, with its parts measured as follows: (1) capturing of the goodwill ofthe audience (55–57); (2) narrative of events at issue (58–72); (3) peroration,making the climactic point (73–75); (4) petition, seeking the consent of theaudience (76–78). (For a more detailed consideration of the rhetoricalconstruction of the speech see Higgins [Higg.1975.1], pp. 63–64.)

[part0011.html#c13-s20-e] The speaker identifies himself, if bycircumlocution, as Pier della Vigna (or “delle Vigne”): “Petrus de Vinea,minister of the Emperor Frederick II, born at Capua ca. 1190; after studying atBologna, he received an appointment at the court of Frederick II as notary, andthenceforward he rapidly rose to distinction. He was made judge and protonotary,and for more than twenty years he was the trusted minister and confidant of theEmperor. He was at the height of his power in 1247, but two years later he wasaccused of treachery, and was thrown into prison and blinded; and soon after hecommitted suicide (April, 1249)” (T). For the Emperor Frederick II see note toInferno X.119.Holding the keys to the emperor’s heart, the “promised land” of any self-seekingcourtier, this Peter is a parodic version of St. Peter, who, in the Christiantradition, holds the keys (one for mercy, one for judgment) that unlock or lockthe kingdom of heaven.

[part0011.html#c13-s22-e] This “slut” is commonly recognized as envy, thesin of hoping that one’s happy neighbor will be made unhappy.Pier is trying to establish his innocence of the charges that he betrayed hislord by stealing from his treasury. We now know that he was in fact guilty ofthat fault; however, it is far from clear that Dante knew what we know. SeeCassell’s gathering of evidence for the case against Pier’s barratry(Cass.1984.1, pp. 38–42). [return to English [part0011.html#c13-s22-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c13-s22-i]]68.

[part0011.html#c13-s24-e] Pier’s disdegnoso gusto, whether pleasure inself-hatred (see Vazzana [Vazz.1998.1] for this reading) or pleasure inimagining his vengeance upon his enemies (see Higgins [Higg.1975.1], p. 72), ispresented as the motive for his suicide. [return to English[part0011.html#c13-s24-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c13-s24-i]]73–75. [part0011.html#c13-s25-e] How are we to respond to this unquestionablyimposing figure? Here is Attilio Momigliano, in his commentary to this passage:“[Pier’s] way of speaking, with its lofty sense of fidelity, with its steadyclearsightedness, with its manly rebellion against the injustice of fate, withthat indestructible sense of his honor and the desire to redeem it, even indeath—all of these dressed in the folds of an austerely embellishedeloquence—dwells in our memory like a solemn portrait of a courtier and makes usforget the fault of the suicide, as the words of Francesca, Brunetto, or Ugolinomake us forget adultery, sodomy, betrayal. These virtues or passions thatredeem, even in hell, a great sin are among the most noble and suggestiveinventions of the Comedy.” Such a view of the “great sinners” of the Inferno isattractive, no doubt, in part because it makes Dante a much less “judgmental”poet than in fact he is. However, it is probably better to see that, in the caseof Pier (as well as in that of the others mentioned by Momigliano), the sinnerspeaks of himself in such a way as to condemn himself in his own words, at leastif we learn to read him from the ironic angle of vision that the split betweenthe consciousness of the slowly evolving protagonist and that of theknowledgeable poet surely seems to call for.It was centuries ago that a reader first thought of Judas when he read of Pier.Pietro di Dante, in the second redaction of his commentary to vv. 16–51 of thiscanto, cites St. Jerome’s comment on Psalm 8: “Judas offended God more greatlyby hanging himself than by betraying Him.” Dante’s son, however, never developedthe importance of Judas as the quintessential suicide in the controlling imageof this canto. In our own time perhaps the first to do so was Giovanni Resta(Rest.1977.1); a fuller expression of this insight was developed by AnthonyCassell (Cass.1984.1, pp. 46–56). While Cassell’s reading mainly involves Pier’sbetrayal of Frederick, the perhaps better understanding is to allow Pier hisproclaimed fealty to his emperor, but to realize that his very words revealthat, if his temporal allegiances were respected, they had displaced his onlytruly significant loyalty, that owed to his only meaningful Lord, Jesus Christ(see Loon.1992.1, p. 39). Like Judas, he did betray his Lord, as Stephany hasshown, precisely in his loyalty to the emperor, whom he treats, in his eulogy ofFrederick, as in his own kingly person being all the Christ one needed. Andthus, in imitation of Judas, he will have his body hanging on a tree foreternity. (For two articles about Frederick, Pier, and the court life that theyshaped and shared, see Feng.1981.1 and Step.1982.1).Pier, as many have noted, has important attributes in common with Dante. Bothwere political figures who ended up losing the goals of their highly energizedactivity; both were poets. Yet it seems clear that, for all the fellow-feelingthat Dante must have felt for the ruined chancellor, he is more interested inthe crucial errors he made in directing his political life to the sharing andtaking of power and to that alone. For Dante, the political life can only belived justly under the sign of the true “emperor,” God. [return to English[part0011.html#c13-s25-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c13-s25-i]]82–84. [part0011.html#c13-s28-e] The protagonist, like many readers, has beenwon over by Pier’s oratory. As was the case in his meeting with Farinata andCavalcante in Inferno X, he began in fear, then turned to pity. Neither is anattitude recommended by the moral setting of the poem that contains thiscurrently piteous protagonist. [return to English [part0011.html#c13-s28-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c13-s28-i]]109–126. [part0011.html#c13-s37-e] This self-contained unit of twenty-sevenverses is devoted to a second class of those violent against themselves. Thesewastrels were “prodigal” in so thoroughly intentional a way that they did notcasually toss away their possessions, but willfully destroyed them in a sort of“material suicide.” Once again we note the line that Dante has drawn between theincontinent form of a sin (prodigality, punished in Inferno VII) and its“malicious” version.Paget Toynbee describes the two sinners found here as follows: “Lano [ArcolanoMaconi], gentleman of Siena, placed by Dante, together with Jacomo da sant’Andrea, among those who have squandered their substance … Lano is said to havebeen a member of the ‘Spendthrift Brigade’ of Siena, and to have squandered allhis property in riotous living. He took part in an expedition of the Florentinesand Sienese against Arezzo in 1288, which ended in the Sienese force fallinginto an ambush and being cut to pieces by the Aretines under Buonconte daMontefeltro at … Pieve al Toppo. Lano, being ruined and desperate, chose tofight and be killed, rather than run away and make his escape; hence theallusion of Jacomo in the text … Jacomo [and not Dante’s “Jacopo”] dellaCappella di sant’ Andrea of Padua, the son of Odorico Fontana da Monselice andSperonella Delesmanini, a very wealthy lady, whose fortune Jacomo inherited, andsquandered in the most senseless acts of prodigality. He is supposed to havebeen put to death by order of Ezzolino da Romano [see Inf. XII.102] in 1239”(T). [return to English [part0011.html#c13-s37-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c13-s37-i]]130–135. [part0011.html#c13-s44-e] The relatively minor figure we nowencounter, a cespuglio (bush) and not the gran pruno (tall thorn-bush—v. 32)that holds the soul of Pier delle Vigne, complains against the unintentionaldespoiling of his leaves by the exhausted Jacomo, who had huddled up against himin order to escape the pursuing hounds. Various of the early commentatorsidentify him as either Lotto degli Agli or Rocco de’ Mozzi, yet some of thesecommentators also suggest that Dante left the name “open” because so manyFlorentines committed suicide by hanging themselves that he wanted to suggestthe frequency of the phenomenon in his native city.

[part0011.html#c13-s47-e] The nameless suicide, now more careful ofhis “body” than he had been when he took his own life, asks to have his torn-offleaves returned to him. He identifies himself as Florentine by referring to thecity’s first patron, Mars, the god of war, whose replacement by John the Baptistin Christian times had weakened her, according to his not very reliable view.(Dante’s sources seem to have confused Attila with Totila, who had in factbesieged the city in 542.)

[part0012.html#c14-s01-e] The first tercet concludes the action of thepreceding canto. This is a particularly egregious example of the way in whichDante deliberately avoids keeping his canto borders “neat” (see note to Inf.XIII.1–3).

[part0012.html#c14-s02-e] These verses, on the other hand, would havemade a “proper” beginning to the fourteenth canto, marking, as they do, theborder between the second ring of the seventh Circle (violence against selves)and the third (violence against God). Here we shall witness (as indeed we havedone before) the dreadful “art” of God in carrying out His just revenge uponsinners, in this case those who sinned directly against Him.

[part0012.html#c14-s03-e] The hellscape, featuring impoverished“vegetation” in the last canto, now is as barren as it can possibly be: nothingcan take root in this sand. The retrospective glance reminds us of where we havebeen in this Circle: Phlegethon, circling the wood, the wood in turn circlingthe sand (violence against others, against selves, and now against God).The translation of verse 7, which uses the adjective nove either to mean “new”or “strange,” or perhaps both at once, attempts to represent this ambiguity.[return to English [part0012.html#c14-s03-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c14-s03-i]]14–15. [part0012.html#c14-s05-e] That Dante should refer here to Cato theYounger, who committed suicide at Utica (when further opposition by therepublican forces led by him against Julius Caesar’s army seemed futile), seemsto invite a negative judgment on him. Cato, however, will be presented inPurgatorio I and II, in an authorial decision that still baffles commentators,as one of the saved. To refer to him here, a few verses from the wood of thesuicides—where Christian readers would normally assume that Cato might bepunished—given Dante’s plan eventually to reveal his salvation, was a chancychoice for him to have made.The poet is translating a line from Lucan’s Pharsalia describing Cato’s heroicdecision to lead the remnant of dead Pompey’s republican forces across thebarren sands of Libya in an attempt to escape from Caesar, and to do so, notcarried by slaves, as Roman generals were wont to be transported, but on foothimself: “primusque gradus in pulvere ponam” (and I, first among them, shall setmy feet upon the sand [Phars. IX.395—the citation was perhaps first noted byDaniello in 1568]). (For a treatment of Cato in the context of Canto XIV seeMazzotta [Mazz.1979.1], pp. 47–65.)Dante thus reads Cato’s suicide as something other, an act resembling Christ’ssacrifice of Himself so that others may be free (for discussion see Hollander[Holl.1969.1], pp. 123–31). Such a view may seem blasphemous; it has causedextraordinary exertion on the part of commentators to “allegorize” the savedCato we find in Purgatorio by turning him into an abstract quality rather thantreating him as historical. Dante’s text will not permit us such luxury ofavoidance. His Cato, a Christian through a process that hardly anyone hasunderstood, is saved.

Only in retrospect are we able with precision to realize which sinnersare alluded to by which postures: those lying supine, the fewest in number, arethe blasphemers (and they, because they cursed God, now cry out the loudest);the most numerous class of sinners, moving about incessantly, are thehomosexuals, who sinned against nature (Canto XV); the sinners hunched up arethe usurers, who sinned againt God’s “grandchild,” art, or industry (Canto XVI).[return to English [part0012.html#c14-s07-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c14-s07-i]]28. [part0012.html#c14-s10-e] The flakes of fire showering down on all thosewho were violent against God seem most directly derived from the brimstone andfire rained down upon the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah for their allowanceof the practice of homosexuality (Genesis 19:24), as was perhaps first observedby Vellutello in his commentary (1544) to this passage.

[part0012.html#c14-s10-e] A clear reference to a line in a sonnet by GuidoCavalcanti, “Biltà di donna” (“A lady’s loveliness”), in which, describingthings beautiful to behold, he refers to “white snow falling on a windless day”(e bianca neve scender senza venti).

[part0012.html#c14-s15-e] Dante’s preface to his question about theidentity of the noteworthy personage before them might be compared to theunnecessarily flippant question posed by a student to a teacher who had beencaught out in an earlier mistake. There seems to be no other reason for Dante toremind Virgil of his failure to enter the walls of Dis (Inf. VIII.115–117).[return to English [part0012.html#c14-s15-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c14-s15-i]]46–48. [part0012.html#c14-s16-e] Like Farinata, Capaneus (we learn his namefrom Virgil at v. 63) is a figure of some greatness (see Inf. X.73, whereFarinata is magnanimo [great of soul]—and see Statius, Thebaid XI.1, whereCapaneus is referred to as magnanimus); like Farinata, he seems not to bebothered by the pains of hell (Inf. X.36).The last verb in the tercet is a matter of debate. As always, in our translationwe follow Petrocchi, even when we disagree with him. His reading is marturi, or“torture”; others prefer the traditional reading, maturi, “ripen” or “soften,” aview with which we concur.

[part0012.html#c14-s17-e] Capaneus, though undergoing the paininflicted by the burning flakes, is alert enough to overhear the two strangersdiscussing him. Surely his stoic reserve creates an initial positive impressionon the reader. [return to English [part0012.html#c14-s17-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c14-s17-i]]51–60. [part0012.html#c14-s18-e] Capaneus was one of the seven kings whobesieged Thebes in aid of Polynices, the son of Oedipus whose twin brother,Eteocles, refused to allow him his turn at ruling. The narrative of the death ofCapaneus on the walls of Thebes and his boast against Jupiter are drawn fromStatius, Thebaid X.883–939.As Capaneus’s oratorical flourish begins, the listener tends to admire thecourage of his speech. As it continues, it more and more resembles vaingloriousboasting. Capaneus may play the role of a stock character in Roman comedy, themiles gloriosus, or braggart soldier. When we study his words we find somedisquieting elements in them: alive he was a defamer of the gods, as he is now;he says that Jupiter will not have his revenge against him even if he sendsVulcan in his forge in Mount Etna into mass production of lightning bolts (aswas necessary to quell the insurrection of the giants at the battle of Phlegra[see the further reference at Inf. XXXI.95]). We may reflect that, in the firstplace, Jupiter (or indeed the true God he would have blasphemed had he knownHim) already has his vengeance (one look at supine Capaneus confirms this); inthe second, when Jupiter took his revenge at Thebes, it took him but a singlebolt to dispatch Capaneus (and Statius says that he was lucky not to live longenough for the second). In short, Capaneus, in his egregious overconfidence,makes something of a fool of himself (and see Inf. XXV.15 for confirmation ofhis prideful opposition to God). [return to English [part0012.html#c14-s18-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c14-s18-i]]61–66. [part0012.html#c14-s21-e] The vehemence of Virgil’s outburst againstCapaneus, underlined as being his most heated condemnation of a sinner yet (andno other will exceed it), is difficult to explain. A student, Edward Sherline(Princeton ’82), some years ago suggested that Virgil, already angered byDante’s wry reminder of his previous insufficiency before the walls of Dis (vv.43–45), is now having his revenge on Capaneus, a revenge especially pleasingwhen Virgil considered what Capaneus was quite effective doing and what hehimself had utterly failed to do: besting the defenders of the walls of ahostile city (mere victory of that kind was not enough for Capaneus, whochallenged Jupiter himself to combat). [return to English[part0012.html#c14-s21-e] / Italian [part0019.html#c14-s21-i]]69–70. [part0012.html#c14-s23-e] Some readers have objected that blasphemyagainst Jupiter should be welcomed in a Christian dispensation, not punished.Dante’s point is clearly that Capaneus meant to oppose the very principle ofdivine power, no matter what its name.

[part0012.html#c14-s26-e] The little stream that the travelers now seeis the second (and last) body of water that moves across their usual circularpath and downward (see Inf. VII.100–108, where the descent from the fourth tothe fifth Circle is made alongside a little stream that seems to connect Acheronto Styx). All other gatherings of water have been circles that they hadeventually to cross in order to descend. We will soon be able to understand (vv.115–117) that this particular stream contains waters from Phlegethon that willeventually fall into the frozen Cocytus (heard tumbling down to the eighthCircle at XVI.1–2). Dante and Virgil apparently do not happen to see the streamthat connects Styx to Phlegethon because, as Virgil suggests (vv. 128–129),their path does not describe a full circle in every zone (e.g., their passagealong Phlegethon, which covers exactly a semicircle, in Inf. XII).The Bulicame is a hot spring near Viterbo from which prostitutes, perhaps notallowed to frequent the public baths, made conduits from the source to servicetheir own dwellings.The passage to the next and deeper zone of the burning sand now lies rightbefore them (it is a necessary expedient, we want to remember, to get Danteacross the burning sand); before they can follow it, Virgil will take up thesubject of the waters of hell.

[part0012.html#c14-s32-e] Virgil, in his presentation of the rivers ofhell, pauses first to create an etiological myth that explains their source. Ithas two parts, a history of Crete and a description of the statue of an old manthat stands inside Mount Ida. [return to English [part0012.html#c14-s32-e] /Italian [part0019.html#c14-s32-i]]94–102. [part0012.html#c14-s34-e] Virgil’s first words rely on the passage inthe Aeneid (III.104–106) describing Crete, similarly located “in the middle ofthe sea” (medio … ponto). It was once “chaste” when it enjoyed a “golden age”under Saturn (see Iann.1992.2, for Dante’s almost entirely positive treatment ofSaturn). But now its mountain, Ida, the site of a sort of classical “Eden,” richin water and vegetation, is a wasteland; like Eden, it, too, is deserted. Rhea,Saturn’s wife, chose it as the cradle for her son, Jupiter. But now “originalsin” seems to have crept into the Golden Age: the crying child needs to beprotected (in the original myth, of course, from Saturn himself, who had theunpleasant habit of eating his children so as to be sure not to be dethroned byone of them).That is all we are told. On Crete there was once a Golden Age, but somethingwent awry. Many commentators refer to the parallel with the similar narrativefound in Ovid (Metam. I.89–150), the descent from an age of gold, to one ofsilver, to one of bronze, and finally to one of iron, when Astraea, justice, isthe last of the gods to leave the earth. (See note to Inf. XXXIV.121–126.)[return to English [part0012.html#c14-s34-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c14-s34-i]]103–111. [part0012.html#c14-s35-e] Dante’s second myth is more of his owndevising. While the statue of the old man is closely modeled on that found inNebuchadnezzar’s dream (Daniel 2: 31–35), the poet’s enclosure of the statue inIda seems to be essentially his own invention. But there are “hydraulic” reasonsfor putting him and his tears (these are not found in Daniel) there: Dante needsto account for the origin of the rivers of hell. The gran veglio, within themountain, turns his back on Egypt (Damietta, a city in the Nile delta) and gazeson Rome as though it were his mirror. Interpretations of this detail vary, butit would seem that the movement of temporal rule from the East to Rome wouldaccount for this representative of the original political order looking towardits new home. What does he see there? Probably, in Dante’s view, his mirrorimage, since the empire is totally ineffective. He is putting more weight uponhis right foot, formed of baked clay, which most of the early commentatorsthought represented the corrupt Church; yet an argument can be made that, sincethe veglio is a figuration of pagan man, the Church would be inappropriately apart of his “physique.” In Nebuchadnezzar’s dream a rock destroys the feet ofthe statue; for Christian exegetes this rock represents Christ, destroying theOld Man and making the new life possible for mankind.

[part0012.html#c14-s38-e] The waters that collect from all thenon-golden and riven parts of the statue gather somewhere beneath it under MountIda and force their way into the underworld. For the root of the image of therivers of hell as tears from the veglio’s eyes in the redeeming blood of Christon the Cross, flowing into Limbo to redeem Adam, see Silverstein (Silv.1931.1)and Cassell (Cass.1984.1), pp. 58–60.

[part0012.html#c14-s39-e] And now Virgil can get to his putative mainpoint, the disposition of the rivers of hell. Dante’s question in response seemsto reveal that he has forgotten what he has seen at the border of Avarice andWrath (Inf. VII.100–108). See note to vv. 76–84, above. On the other hand,Virgil does not make that plain to him. As a result, whether that stream issupposed to be from the same source as this one—the most attractivehypothesis—becomes, at best, moot.

[part0012.html#c14-s44-e] Dante’s two questions are meant as an aidto the reader, who may not have realized that the river of blood and what hasjust now been called “Phlegethon” for the first time (at v. 116) are one and thesame. As for Lethe, since it is thought of as being a major fluvial appurtenanceof the afterworld, the poet wants to reassure his reader that it has not beenforgotten in the watery arrangement of hell but awaits discovery in purgatory.[return to English [part0012.html#c14-s44-e] / Italian[part0019.html#c14-s44-i]]139–142. [part0012.html#c14-s47-e] The coda ties the action back to where itstopped, at v. 84. The next canto, in fact, will pick up precisely from there(and not here), as though it were the last verse of the canto. For a similarphenomenon earlier on, see note to Inferno VIII.1.

[part0012.html#c15-s01-e] Both the words margini (borders) and ruscello(stream) appear in the passage at which the forward motion of the journey wasarrested in the previous canto (XIV.79–84). The action, interrupted by Virgil’sdiscourse about Crete and the gran veglio, now continues. The poets walk alongone of the two “banks” that rise above the barren plain of sand and border thered stream as it heads for the lower regions. Thus we know that all theirmovement until they reach the edge of the next boundary (XVI.103) is on adownward gradient, headed toward the center of the pit. This revision in theirusual procedure (a leftward, circling movement) is necessitated by thetopography of the ring of violence against God, the sand where flakes of firefall and which admits no mortal traversal.

[part0012.html#c15-s02-e] The double simile compares the constructionmade by God to carry the “water” of hell toward its final destination to thehuge earthworks engineered in Flanders and in northern Italy to protect farmlandand human habitations from flood. “Carentana” probably refers (the exactreference is debated in the commentaries) to the mountains north of Padua fromwhich in spring the snows release their torrents.

As the poets moveaway from the wood of the suicides and down across the sand along their dyke,they approach a group of the damned. Its members examine them as men look at oneanother under a new moon and as an aging tailor concentrates upon threading hisneedle. The first comparison may suggest the image of homosexual “cruising” inthe darkest of moonlit nights (it is difficult for modern readers to imagine howdark the nighttime streets of medieval cities were); the second conveys theintensity of such gazing. For this way of reading many of the words and imagesof the canto see Pequigney (Pequ.1991.1).

[part0012.html#c15-s08-e] The sinner, standing below Dante, must reachup to touch the hem of his garment. His words of recognition capture the tone ofan elderly teacher recognizing his former star pupil and, some would argue, ofhis effeminacy. [return to English [part0012.html#c15-s08-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c15-s08-i]]28–30. [part0012.html#c15-s10-e] Dante recognizes his old “teacher,” BrunettoLatini (ca. 1220–94). He probably taught Dante by the example of his worksrather than in any classroom, but the entire scene is staged as a reunionbetween teacher and former student.Brunetto, whose life has a number of similarities to Dante’s, was a FlorentineGuelph, a man of letters who was much involved in politics, and, not least inimportance, he wrote narrative verse in the vernacular; he was also a notary,which accounts for his title, ser. He became a de facto exile when he learnedabout the battle of Montaperti (1260) and the triumph of the Ghibellines whilehe was in France. He stayed there for six years and, wrote his Frenchencyclopedic treatise, the Livre dou Tresor, or Treasure. Before his voluntaryexile, Brunetto had previously written a major portion of an allegorical poem inItalian rhymed couplets, referred to within the work itself three times as IlTesoro but which became known as the Tesoretto (“Little Treasure”—one supposesbecause it was both incomplete and did not seem as “weighty” as the Tresor[referred to as Tesoro in Bono Giamboni’s abbreviated Italian version of theprose work]). The Tesoretto, as it has continued to be called, was at thatpoint, even though incomplete, the longest narrative poem composed in Italian.Returning to Florence after the “restoration” of 1266 in the wake of the battleof Benevento, he took up his political and notarial chores, and died in thecity, much honored, in 1294. (For a careful presentation of the importance ofBrunetto for Dante, see Francesco Mazzoni, “Latini, Brunetto,” ED, vol. 3, 1971,pp. 579–88. See also Mazzoni’s essential study of Dante’s borrowings fromBrunetto [Mazz.1967.3]; and Charles Davis’s article [Davi.1967.1].)The poet’s honorific feelings toward Brunetto are perhaps mirrored in the wordhis name rhymes with: “intelletto.” And his answering gesture, to move his facedown toward his “teacher,” certainly does so as well. (The Petrocchi text hereoffers what is surely an implausible reading: “la mano alla sua faccia” (whichwe have translated as it stands). It seems nearly certain that the text shouldread, as it does in many manuscripts, “la mia alla sua faccia,” i.e., Dante benthis face toward Brunetto’s in an act of homage. This better reading is confirmedby the later verse (v. 44) that has Dante walking with his head still bent downin reverence (see note to v. 50).

[part0012.html#c15-s16-e] A number of commentaries on this passage citeAeneid VI.531–534, Deiphobus’s similar questions to Aeneas.It is striking that Brunetto never discovers the identity of Dante’s leader (nordid Cavalcante in Inf. X). Like Cavalcante’s son Guido’s, Brunetto’s body ofwork is notably unmarked by Virgil’s influence. The omission, in other words,may be entirely intentional.

I.3, I.14) picks up, as a few commentators have sensed (Pietrobonoperhaps the first), a similar passage in Brunetto’s Tesoretto, vv. 186–90: e io, in tal corrotto pensando a capo chino, perdei il gran cammino, e tenni a la traversa d’una selva diversa.(And I, in such great vexation, my head bowed down, lost the main road and cameupon a path that crossed a strange wood.)The phrase a capo chino (my head bowed down) has perhaps been borrowed todescribe Dante’s reverence before Brunetto (v. 44—see note to vv. 28–30).[return to English [part0012.html#c15-s17-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c15-s17-i]]54. [part0012.html#c15-s18-e] Dante had criticized Brunetto’s (along with otherTuscan poets’) Italian poetry for its low dialectism in De vulgari eloquentia(I.xiii.1); now he himself uses a Tuscan dialectical form (ca, for casa, “house”or “home”) as though in apology; and he uses it to express the high and ultimatepurpose of his journey, his return to the God who made him. It is a moment ofstunning force. [return to English [part0012.html#c15-s18-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c15-s18-i]]55. [part0012.html#c15-s19-e] Dante’s “star” is probably his natal sign,Gemini.

[part0012.html#c15-s20-e] Brunetto’s desire to aid Dante in his currentand future plight, given the context of the discussion that follows, would seemrather to refer to his political life than to his literary one, though it isdifficult to separate the two.

His sense of the history of Florence (perhapsreflecting his own treatment of this subject in the first book of his Tresor)puts forward the legend that Florence was populated by the Romans after theydestroyed neighboring Fiesole in order to put an end to Catiline’s conspiracy.Unfortunately, their descendants, the Florentine nobility, allowed the survivingFiesolans to emigrate and mix their base population with the Roman stock. ForDante, all the city’s (and his own) troubles stem from this original mistake.[return to English [part0012.html#c15-s21-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c15-s21-i]]83–85. [part0012.html#c15-s28-e] Dante pays his debt to Brunetto. But what wasit that Brunetto (or, more likely, his writings) taught Dante about immortality?Brunetto himself (Tresor II.cxx.1) says that fame for good works gives one asecond life on earth. Surely that is not enough for the Christian Dante, whoknows the true meaning of immortality. The only seconde vie that matters is inthe afterlife. Is Dante saying that Brunetto taught him this? That seemsimpossible. But he did learn from him how his earthly fame might be establishedby writing a narrative poem in Italian. And his heavenly reward might becombined with that one if his poem were, unlike Brunetto’s work, dedicated to ahigher purpose. Perhaps one of the earliest commentators said this best:Brunetto gave Dante “the knowledge that does not allow him to die either in hisessential being in the other world, nor with respect to fame in this one”(Jacopo della Lana). For the work of Brunetto that had such effect on Dante seethe note to v. 119. [return to English [part0012.html#c15-s28-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c15-s28-i]]88–90. [part0012.html#c15-s30-e] The protagonist, responding to Brunetto’swarning that his good deeds will not go unpunished (vv. 61–64), adverts toFarinata’s similar prophecy and Virgil’s promise of Beatrice’s eventualexplanation of it. See note to Inf. X.130–132. [return to English[part0012.html#c15-s30-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c15-s30-i]]91–94. [part0012.html#c15-s31-e] Dante claims that he is ready for Fortune’sadversity.

[part0012.html#c15-s32-e] For a reading of the “peasant” that is basedin the representation of Saturn as an old and tired farmer, carrying a spade ormattock, and thus keyed to the allegorical understanding of Saturn as time, seeIannucci (Iann.1982.1). The phrase would then mean: “let Fortune turn her wheelas she pleases and let time continue its relentless course” (p. 6).

[part0012.html#c15-s33-e] This is Virgil’s only utterance in the canto.(Walking ahead of Dante, accompanied by Brunetto, who is moving close to thebank, along the sand, Virgil is not “in the frame” for most of the scene.) Howwe should read the remark is no longer as clear as it once seemed. Is itcongratulatory or monitory? All the early commentators who deal with it think itis the latter, i.e., Dante has just uttered a truthful wish (vv. 91–96), but onedifficult to live up to. And that seems the most likely reading. [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c15-s33-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c15-s33-i]]106–114. [part0012.html#c15-s36-e] Brunetto indicates that all his companionswere men of letters, identifying Priscian (the great Latin grammarian of theearly sixth century); Francesco d’Accorso (1225–93), a renowned jurist ofBologna; and Andrea de’ Mozzi (died 1296). A Florentine, he was made bishop ofFlorence (on the Arno) in 1287 until he was transferred to Vicenza (on theBacchiglione) by Pope Boniface VIII (here ironically referred to with the papalformula “servant of servants”) in 1295 for his riotous habits. None of these(neither is Brunetto) is recorded by other writers as having been homosexual.The last verse, indicating Andrea’s “sin-stretched sinews” would, however, seemto indicate his sexual activity (and the meaning of this line is thus hotlycontested by those who deny that homosexuality is punished in this ring—see theendnote to the next canto). [return to English [part0012.html#c15-s36-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c15-s36-i]]118. [part0012.html#c15-s40-e] What is the division that separates these twogroups of homosexuals? We should note that Brunetto, accompanying Dante, hasgone lower down the sloping sand than he generally does; his group apparentlyremains higher up. The only clue given us by the text is that his fellows areall men of letters, while the next group will be made up of politicians (butthen Brunetto must be considered, at least to some degree, a “politician”himself). Is that what keeps them separate? It does not seem likely. It wouldrather seem that the two groups are kept separate by their particular form ofsexual deviance, as Boccaccio appears to suggest. [return to English[part0012.html#c15-s40-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c15-s40-i]]119. [part0012.html#c15-s40-e] It has long been assumed that Brunetto asksDante’s affectionate remembrance of his Tresor. In the opinion of some, however,it is far better to understand that the work in question is the Tesoretto. Tosuggest as much is not to deny the importance of the French encyclopedictreatise for Dante, who knew it well and whose memory is suffused by it.However, given his predilection for poetry, it seems likely that for him thepivotal work was the Tesoretto because it was his first Italian model for theComedy. It is fairly clear why nearly all the commentators think that Dante isreferring to the Tresor: It is a major work, at least by comparison to theunfinished Tesoretto, and people do not especially appreciate the poetry ofBrunetto (perhaps with good reason). But why would Dante not be giving credit tothe work which made a difference to him as poet? That seems a sensible view ofthe matter. However, it was only in the eighteenth century that a commentator(Lombardi) would suggest this possibility, and only in the nineteenth that onewould seize upon it (Gregorio Di Siena). An as yet unpublished book on Dante andBrunetto by Frank Ordiway extends the evidence offered by Mazzoni (Mazz.1967.3)of Dante’s considerable citation of the Tesoretto into a strong argument for thereference to the Italian work in this line. For bibliography of those who haveargued for the Tesoretto see Holl.1992.2, n. 82.The text of the Tesoretto itself offers evidence that it is the work we shouldthink of here: Io, Burnetto Latino, che vostro in ogni guisa mi son sanza divisa, a voi mi racomando. Poi vi presento e mando questo ricco Tesoro, che vale argento ed oro:… (vv. 70–76; italics added) (I, Brunetto Latini, who am yours in every way, without any reservation commend myself to you. Then I present and send to you this rich Treasure, which is worth silver and gold.)Within the text of what we call the Tesoretto we find that its own title foritself is Tesoro (and this will occur twice more in the work). And we can hear,in Dante’s verse 119, another echo of the Italian work, the verb raccomandare.It seems difficult to go on believing that the Tresor is on our poet’s mind atthis crucial juncture of his presentation of his literary “father,” his finalwords in Dante’s poem. [return to English [part0012.html#c15-s40-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c15-s40-i]]121–124. [part0012.html#c15-s41-e] The canto concludes with a simile thatperfectly expresses Dante’s ambivalent feelings about Brunetto. He looks everybit the winner—but he is in last place. In the actual race run outside Verona,the runners ran naked, according to the early commentators; the winner receiveda piece of green cloth, while the one who finished last was given a rooster,which he had to carry back into the city with him as a sign of his disgrace anda cause of derisive taunts on the part of his townsmen. The case can be madethat Dante treats Brunetto in exactly both these ways.Two biblical texts are of interest here: “The race is not to the swift, nor thebattle to the strong” (Eccles. 9:11); “Know ye not that they which run in a racerun all, but one receives the prize?” (I Cor. 9:24).

And in Inferno VI.79–82 we read thatDante was particularly interested in meeting Iacopo and Tegghiaio (along withFarinata, Mosca, and the mysterious Arrigo), Florentines who had labored to dogood for the city. Again we face a situation in which the sinner seems, apartfrom his sin, a thoroughly admirable person, and indeed capable of performinggood deeds. See also Ciacco in Inferno VI.

[part0012.html#c16-s07-e] The three sinners who have recognized Danteas Florentine from his clothing continue their lamentation, but now formthemselves into a wheeling circle so that they may remain in motion (in accordwith their penalty) while also staying in one place, like joggers at astoplight. Thus while their feet move in one direction, their heads move in anopposite one, so that their glances may stay fixed on Dante.There is some discussion in the commentaries as to whether Dante refers toclassical wrestling, as presented in Latin epics such as Virgil’s and Lucan’s,or to a contemporary version of the sport, or, indeed, to both. [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c16-s07-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c16-s07-i]]28–42. [part0012.html#c16-s10-e] The first-named of three Florentines is GuidoGuerra (a member of the family of the Conti Guidi, one of the most powerful innorthern Italy); born ca. 1220, grandson of Guido Guerra IV and Gualdrada de’Ravignani, he was a notably successful Guelph political leader, leading themback from exile after the battle of Montaperti (1260) to their crushing defeatof the Ghibellines at Benevento (1266) and their restoration to power in thecity; he died in 1272. The second is Tegghiaio Aldobrandi, of the noble Adimarifamily, contemporary and ally of Guido Guerra in the Guelph cause; along withGuido he counseled the Florentines not to engage in the expedition against Sienathat ended in the disastrous defeat at Montaperti. The speaker is IacopoRusticucci, also a Guelph, but not, like the two he names, of noble rank (atleast according to the Anonimo Fiorentino’s commentary to this passage). Hishouse and that of his neighbor, Tegghiaio, were destroyed in the aftermath ofMontaperti. In the eyes of most readers, Iacopo blames his unwilling wife forhis turning to homosexuality. But now see Chiamenti (Chia.1998.1), who arguesthat the adjective fiera (bestial) used of her rather suggests her bestialpleasure in having anal intercourse with her husband, a form of sexual practiceindeed considered sodomitic.

[part0012.html#c16-s16-e] Dante’s journey through hell produces noscene in which he is as cordial to a group of sinners as this one (seeHoll.1996.1). That his affection is directed toward homosexuals is noteworthy,but does not necessarily involve him in anything more than what a modern readermust consider a remarkable lack of the typical Christian heterosexual scorn forhomosexuals. The conversation here, like that with Ciacco, is devoted not to thesin of which these men were guilty, but to their political concerns forFlorence, which Dante shares enthusiastically. These men are “good Guelphs,” asFarinata was a “good Ghibelline,” leaders who put true concerns for the cityover those of party, as Dante surely believed he himself did.

[part0012.html#c16-s20-e] Dante identifies himself, out of modesty wepresume, as a fellow Florentine, but not by name. His heavenly destination isenough by way of reward to let him wish to remain modestly anonymous. Hisreference to the good “deeds” (ovra) of these souls joins, in a series ofmoments with positive things to say about some of Florence’s citizens, withBrunetto’s reference (Inf. XV.60) to Dante’s own political work (opera) onbehalf of Florence, and to the passage that initiated these concerns, withspecific reference to Guido Guerra and Iacopo Rusticucci (Inf. VI. 79–81), whenDante spoke with Ciacco of the good deeds of some of Florence’s citizens.[return to English [part0012.html#c16-s20-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c16-s20-i]]64–72. [part0012.html#c16-s22-e] Iacopo’s question offers Dante an opportunityto stage one of his frequent invectives against human depravity, especially ofthe Florentine sort. Guglielmo Borsiere, only recently arrived at this station,has been telling his fellows that the “good old days” are so no longer (while wehave a secure date of death only for Guido Guerra [1272], we imagine that hisother two companions also have been in hell for a quarter century or so:Florence is much changed). Guglielmo, of whom we know little, was, as his lastname informs us, probably a pursemaker. Courtesy (in the sense of decency towardone’s fellows but more in the wider sense of a whole courtly code of living) andvalor (in the sense of showing attention to the worth of things by one’s ownconduct) are thus societal values reflected in individual behavior. Find them inFlorence today? Dante’s answer will be firmly negative. [return to English[part0012.html#c16-s22-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c16-s22-i]]73–75. [part0012.html#c16-s25-e] The “new rich,” having moved in from thesurrounding countryside, are without any valor and courtesy, and already thecivic price is being paid. Dante’s brief but strongly phrased remark is filledwith personal—and bitter—experience. We should probably remember the earlierdenunciation of the original Fiesolan “barbarian” incursions into pure “Roman”Florence (Inf. XV.61–78). This moment of rhetorical elevation marks the onlyplace that the name of the city about which the canto is so largely concerned isallowed to appear.

[part0012.html#c16-s26-e] Dante approximates the gesture of an OldTestament prophet, calling for divine retribution, raising his eyes and voicerather to heaven than, as some commentators propose, to Florence.

VI.88) and few others inhell, these men have the confidence in the force of the good that they did onearth to want to be remembered above, even though they are condemned to eternalpunishment.This is the only time in hell that several sinners speak harmoniously as one.And what is also notable is their reference to the stars that shine over earthnow, the last reference to them until we come to the concluding line of thecantica (Inf. XXXIV.139), when Dante and Virgil see them once again.Beginning with Daniello (who borrowed the notice from his teacher, TrifonGabriele [Gabr.1993.1]), commentators have remarked on the similarity of thesentiments expressed in their words “when you shall rejoice in saying ‘I wasthere’ ” to Aeneas’s words to his storm-tossed men (Aen. I.203): “forsan et haecolim meminisse iuvabit” (perhaps one day it will be a joy to recall even suchevents as these).

[part0012.html#c16-s30-e] When this group hurries off to rejoin theirfellows (as did Brunetto his), the poet describes their flight as taking no moretime than it takes to say “Amen.” The detail also probably implies, as it were,an illicit prayer for them on Dante’s part, as though the protagonist, inresponse to their kind words, accepted their prayer for his return to the world,and would like to offer one for them in return. In a sense, the poet’s positivetreatment of them in this canto is the fulfillment of that wish. [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c16-s30-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c16-s30-i]]91–93.

[part0012.html#c16-s32-e] Dante, fond of the rivers of Italy assources for poetic “digressions,” describes the Acquacheta (its name means“quiet water”) as being joined by the Riodestro near its source in theApennines, and then changing name (to “Montone”) at Forlì, before it flows intothe Adriatic Sea just south of Ravenna without pouring first into the Po, themajor river of the region. At its source at San Benedetto dell’Alpe, the meaningseems to be (and Petrocchi’s text is much debated here), when the river was notin flood, forming the cascade referred to, it might have consisted in only athousand rivulets. Phlegethon, descending into Cocytus, is here a waterfallresembling the Acquacheta in flood.Perhaps mirroring the length of the river it describes, the simile here is thelongest yet found in Inferno (the two closest challengers occur at Inf.III.112–120 and Inf. XV.4–12; but the thirteen cantos of Malebolge will at firstequal and finally outdo any other area of the poem for length of simile: Inf.XXI.7–18; Inf XXII.1–12; Inf. XXIV.1–18; Inf. XXVIII.7–21; and the “champion,”Inf. XXX. 1–27). [return to English [part0012.html#c16-s32-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c16-s32-i]]106–108. [part0012.html#c16-s36-e] Dante’s cord is now retrospectively addedto the details of the scene in Inferno I (as the full moon will be added to thatscene in Inf. XX.127–129). The cord has the function of holding his robestogether, but symbolically may also reflect the cincture of one who attempts to“gird his loins” and live right. (For bibliography of various interpretations ofthe cord’s significance see Mercuri [Merc. 1984.1], pp. 14n.-17n.)Over the years, some commentators have tried to make the case that the cord isthat of a Franciscan garment, and that Dante was a member of the (lay) ThirdOrder of Franciscans. This may be true (most doubt it), but the corda wouldoffer no proof at all, since Dante knew the technical name for the cord thatbound the garment of a Franciscan: the capestro (Inf. XXVII.92).This passage is linked to the question of the identity of the three beastsencountered by Dante in Inferno I (see note to I.32–54).

[part0012.html#c16-s37-e] Virgil pitches Dante’s coiled-up cord intothe abyss apparently as a challenge to a creature somewhere down there. The poetbuilds suspense for the advent of that creature, whose appearance is delayeduntil the beginning of the next canto.

[part0012.html#c16-s39-e] Does Virgil read Dante’s thoughts or is hesimply so sensitive to Dante’s way of reacting to events that he can understandwhat his pupil must be thinking? For a convincing statement in support of thesecond thesis, with review of the various other passages in Inferno in whichVirgil might seem to be claiming for himself the sort of intellective powersthat Beatrice will possess (she does read the pilgrim’s mind), see Musa.1977.1.[return to English [part0012.html#c16-s39-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c16-s39-i]]124–132. [part0012.html#c16-s42-e] Rhetorical energy increases as Dante swearsto each of us, his readers, that he actually saw the creature he is about todescribe. It is Geryon (only named at Inf. XVII.97, but see note at XVII.1–3),as mythical a monster as one can find and, as Castelvetro complained in hiscommentary, in Dante’s handling not even resemblant of any of the descriptionsof him found in classical literature. In other words, Dante has put the veracityof the entire Comedy (here named for the first of only two times [the secondoccurs at Inf. XXI.2]) upon the reality of Geryon. Where such as Ferrucci(Ferr.1971.1) use the passage to argue that Dante here obviously admits that hispoem is no “historical” record of an “actual” journey, Hollander (Holl.1976.1),pp. 111–12; 132–33, bases his countering argument in his perception that theground for Dante’s choice of the “allegory of the theologians” for the Comedylay in his battle with St. Thomas over the literal untruth of poetry; thus,according to him, Dante “claims that his poem is literally true while tacitlyadmitting that he has made it all up” (p. 133). The difference between these twopositions may seem slight, but is major, for one reads the poem differentlyaccording as one admits or denies the applicability of theological allegory toits making and to its understanding.For Dante’s distinctions between tragedy and comedy see the concludingdiscussion in the note to Inferno XX.106–114.

[part0012.html#c16-s45-e] The concluding simile asks the reader toimagine a detail that cannot be seen: “something other hidden in the sea”; onemight argue that precisely this inability to describe what cannot be seen marksthe guarantee of Dante’s “realistic” descriptive narrative. Makers of “merefictions” operate under no such limit.For Geryon as palombaro, that is, a man who releases anchors from the objectsthey attach to and then pulls himself back up to the surface by a cord throwninto the water with him, see Baldelli (Bald.1993.1). [return to English[part0012.html#c16-s45-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c16-s45-i]]Endnote. The debate concerning homosexuality in these cantos. There has beenmuch recent debate about whether or not the sin punished here is in facthomosexuality. The principal negative findings are those advanced by AndréPézard (Peza.1950.1), Richard Kay (Kay.1978.1), and Peter Armour (Armo.1983.1;Armo.1991.1). (Pézard’s solution is that these sinners were guilty of blasphemyin deriding the mother tongue; Kay’s, that they were guilty of denying thepolitical supremacy of the empire; Armour’s, that Brunetto was guilty of aManichaean heresy. For bibliography of other recent discussions see Contrada[Cont.1995.1].) One of the principal issues facing those who oppose theseinteresting arguments is that in purgatory homosexuality is regarded a sin oflust and thus of incontinence. If it is punished here, in Violence, it would bein a different category than it occupies there. Had Dante thought ofhomosexuality as the sin against nature when he composed Inferno, with its basicorganization taken from Aristotle and Cicero, and as a sin of lust when hecomposed the second cantica, organized by the seven capital sins? If he did so,perhaps he should not have. Despite the significant contradiction that results,most students of the problem remain convinced that the sin punished in Cantos XVand XVI is in fact homosexuality, and are supported by the text itself. The sinpunished here is surely what is referred to by the name of the city “Soddoma”(Sodom) at Inferno XI.50; in Purgatorio XXVI.40 the penitent homosexuals callout that word in self-identification and penitence (and report that they do soat XXVI.79). If Dante had wanted us to separate the two sins, he made it awfullydifficult for us to follow his logic in so doing. (For an attempt to rationalizethe discrepancy see Pequigney [Pequ.1991.1], pp. 31–39.)INFERNO XVII [part0012.html#c17-e]1–3. [part0012.html#c17-s01-e] Virgil’s description of Geryon (not identifiedby name until v. 97) reflects his triple nature in classical literature. In thetradition known to Dante, he enticed strangers to be his guests, only to killand eat them. He was eventually killed by Hercules. In the Aeneid he is twiceidentified with the number three: he is described as forma tricorporis umbrae(the form of the three-bodied shade—VI.289) and again as tergemini … Geryonae(triple Geryon—VIII.202). Ovid (Heroides IX.92) says that “in tribus unus erat”(he was one in three). In classical literature he is sometimes referred to asthe king of three Iberian islands—which may account for his tripleness. “Dante’simage was profoundly modified, however, by Pliny’s description—followed bySolinus—of a strange beast called Mantichora (Historia Naturalis, VIII, 30)which has the face of a man, the body of a lion, and a tail ending in a stinglike a scorpion’s” (Grandgent’s introductory note to this canto). All thesethrees find an answer in the three destructive action verbs describing him inthis first tercet. This embodiment of fraud (he is the “foul effigy of fraud” atv. 7) is thus presented as the counterfeit of Christ, three-in-one rather thanone-in-three. The very words that introduce this numerically central canto ofInferno, “Ecco la fiera” (Behold the beast), would seem to echo the familiar tagfor Christ, Ecce homo (Behold the man [John 19:5]), as a student at DartmouthCollege (Sarah LaBudde, ’84) suggested some years ago.

[part0012.html#c17-s04-e] The positive words that accompany thisdescription, invoking justice and benignity, remind us of the absence of suchqualities in hell. Now they appear, but only as the masks for Fraud. The realmof Violence here will show us its last set of sinners, the usurers, menidentified by bestial devices hanging from their throats; this first tip of theiceberg of Fraud is in the form of a huge beast, his bestial and reptilian partsat first mainly hidden in the void, with the fair face of a man. The last bookin the Christian scripture tells of similar creatures, the locusts ofdestruction that will be loosed upon the world who have faces like men and tailslike scorpions, with stingers in them (Rev. 9:7; 9:10).

[part0012.html#c17-s05-e] The “tattooed” body of Geryon looms in eeriebeauty until the resemblance to the similarly “painted” leopard of Canto I.42(referred to again at XVI.108) suggests that we can understand both thesecreatures as embodiments of the sins of fraud (see Durling and Martinez on theseverses [Durl.1996.1]). And the concluding reference to Arachne (Ovid, Metam.VI.5–145), that world-class weaver turned into a spider, whose metamorphosedbeguiling art has a purpose: the entrapment of flies. Chiavacci Leonardi(Chia.1991.1) calls attention to Rossetti’s commentary to vv. 7–12, in which heinterprets the shape of the serpent as a sort of history of the process offraud: “Fraud begins its work by inspiring trust (the face of a just man); thenweaves its deceit (the serpentine trunk); and at last strikes its final blow(the pointed tail).” [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s05-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c17-s05-i]]19–24. [part0012.html#c17-s07-e] The two similes identify the posture ofGeryon in terms of homely images, a boat drawn up to shore, a beaver fishingwith its tail. (Beavers were reputed to use their tails as bait, eventuallygrasping the thereby attracted fish with their paws.) Tommaseo’s commentary tothis passage pointed out that hyperactive Teutonic appetite was a matter of noteas far back as the histories of Tacitus.

[part0012.html#c17-s10-e] Their descent to the right causes somecommentators to think that the travelers have changed direction, as they did inthe Circle of heresy; what they have done is merely what they have done before,all across the ring of the violent against nature; that is, they are movingdownward toward the center. They have not changed their essential leftwardcourse on this occasion, either. [return to English [part0012.html#c17-s10-e] /Italian [part0020.html#c17-s10-i]]37–39. [part0012.html#c17-s13-e] For only the second time in the poem Virgilleaves Dante alone (see Inf. VIII.106–111). And now, for the first time, he isallowed to visit a group of sinners unguided. Virgil’s decision to let him do soprobably tells us that he believes the protagonist already proof against thedanger or attraction of usury. Further, on both occasions we have come to theend of a large area of hell, first Incontinence and now Violence. For the ideathat the infernal voyage is divided into five segments, in each of which theprotagonist moves through cycles of unworthy fear and improper sympathy until hereaches firmness against an entire category of sin, see Hollander (Holl.1969.1),pp. 301–7, with addendum in Holl.1980.1, pp. 168–69.

We are in the third and final zone of the third ring of theseventh Circle. Like the first, it is located at a margin of that Circle (seeInf. XIV.12).

[part0012.html#c17-s19-e] The usurers, rendered unrecognizable by theburning (and by the degrading nature of their sin, which is a sin against God’s“grandchild,” industry, yet is also a sin against His child, nature, because itmakes money “copulate”), have their only identity in the coats-of-arms hangingfrom their necks, fastened loose enough so that they themselves can see them.Their identities are made known to an observer by these devices, but they wouldrather seem to be gazing on their “real” selves, the money that used to filltheir purses, than on their escutcheons.

He was fromPadua and was a usurer on a major scale. A penitential desire to make up forpaternal usurious practice reputedly moved his son, Arrigo, to endow theconstruction of the Scrovegni Chapel, its walls devoted to Giotto’s frescoes,one of the most beautiful interior spaces in the Western world.

[part0012.html#c17-s25-e] Reginaldo’s animalistic, sub-verbal facialgesture in response to the reported conversations of his companions conveys someof the self-enclosed antisocial nature of these sinners. They really did notcare for anything but money. Dante, having been warned by Virgil to returnquickly (and the whole scene has a rushed urgency about it), heads back towardVirgil—and Geryon.This little narrative (vv. 43–78) of Dante’s first (and last) “solo” adventurein the Inferno is carried out with a striking mixture of brief understatementand the only vivid colors we find in the cantica (as Chiavacci Leonardi pointsout in her commentary to v. 63). The quick spareness of the narration allows thepoet to give us five personages in this brief space. And for all the brightnessof the color on the devices that we see, the net effect is of an enervatedattachment, not so much to wealth as to the lonely pursuit of infinitegathering.

[part0012.html#c17-s33-e] Virgil’s commands to Geryon, coupled with themonster’s instantaneous disappearance once his tour of duty is ended, make thereader realize that Virgil has used extraordinarily persuasive arguments to tamethis beast. His having sent Dante away also reminds us of the time he left hischarge alone but in sight of his temporary yet crushing defeat at the hands ofthe demons at the walls of Dis. This time he first gets his pupil out of viewingrange and then, we do not know how, manages to control a most difficult demonand turn him into the first helicopter.

[part0012.html#c17-s36-e] The extraordinary journey put fear into ourhero, which he now may compare to that felt by classical precursors who failedon similar flights. As Brownlee points out, Phaeton (his story is found in Ovid,Metam. II.47–324) dropped the reins of his heavenly chariot as a result of histerror upon looking at the constellation Scorpio, while Dante mounts on thescorpion-tailed Geryon in order to accomplish his flight (Brow.1984.1), p. 136.The “scorching” of the sky, the path of Phaeton’s fall, is the Milky Way.[return to English [part0012.html#c17-s36-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c17-s36-i]]109–111. [part0012.html#c17-s37-e] Icarus (Ovid, Metam. VIII.183–235), on asecond extraordinary flight that failed, did not obey the instructions of hisfather, Daedalus, trying instead to turn a voyage home into a trip through thegalaxy. If the protagonist then thought of these two precursors, he must havethought that he, too, might die for his temerity; the poet, however, making theanalogies now, sees the comic resolution of a voyage that might have turnedtragic except for the fact that this voyager had God on his side. [return toEnglish [part0012.html#c17-s37-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c17-s37-i]]115–126. [part0012.html#c17-s39-e] This, perhaps the single most melodramaticand implausible narrative passage in the Comedy, is accomplished withconsiderable art. Dante, his face at first pushed up against the body of thebeast, sees nothing. He feels the wind on his face, hears the torrent below,finally gets his eyes into play and sees the flames of lower hell, hears thecries of the damned, and finally, now that he is able to look, realizes thepattern of his descending flight from the “approach” of the circling and risinghellscape.

[part0012.html#c17-s43-e] The simile re-introduces falconry to thepoem; references to this sport of hunting with birds will reappear severaltimes. The similetic falcon, like Geryon an unwilling worker, has come downbefore finishing his mission (to catch a bird or be summoned home by thefalconer’s lure); to compound his bad birdmanship, he does not even land on hismaster’s arm, but far afield. Geryon, on the other hand, while equallyrebellious, does complete his flight as his master (Virgil) had ordered. Thesimile, now that the fearsome flight is over, has a way of making Geryon lessterrifying than he was, comparing him to a small bird of prey. At this midpointof the Comedy we have a provisional comic ending, with Dante safe and soundexactly halfway there. (For Dante’s distinctions between tragedy and comedy seethe note to Inferno XX.106–114.) The last two verses of the canto, however, giveGeryon a last moment of terrifying will and power. [return to English[part0012.html#c17-s43-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c17-s43-i]]INFERNO XVIII [part0012.html#c18-e]1–18. [part0012.html#c18-s01-e] The extended introductory passage interruptsthe narrative in order to set the new scene: Malebolge, the eighth Circle, withits ten varieties of fraudulent behaviors. Only in Inferno does an equal numberof cantos (17 and 17) create a precise center for a cantica in the space betweentwo cantos, and we have just passed it. The last canto ended with a sort of“comic” conclusion to Dante’s dangerous voyage on Geryon. He has now traversedprecisely half of the literary space devoted to the underworld. Thus, fully halfof the cantica, Cantos XVIII to XXXIV, is dedicated to the sins of Fraud. Thatdivision tells us something about the poet’s view of human behavior, namely thatit is better typified by the worst of sins than by the lesser ones.The poetry of Malebolge, studied by Sanguineti (Sang.1962.1), is strikinglyself-confident. One has the feeling that Dante, having finished hisapprenticeship, now has achieved a level of aesthetic performance that may havesurprised even him. In the seventh canto he had conjoined two kinds of sinners,the avaricious and the prodigal; but these are two sides of the same sin. Herefor the first time, as something of a tour de force, he includes two entirelyseparate categories of sin in a single canto, one of them itself subdivided intotwo groups, as in Canto VII—all of this in 115 lines. The precision of theoperation is noteworthy, and may be represented as follows:(1) panders & seducers (2) flatterers disposition of both (22–39)disposition (100–114) modern exemplar (52–66) modern exemplar (115–126)classical exemplar (82–99) classical exemplar (127–136)The hellscape offers a gray stone circular wall surrounding a stone “field,”which in turn surrounds a pit (the “keep” of this “castle”); the field isdivided into ten valleys, which resemble moats set around a castle. The analogyis complete, but works in reverse, since a castle rises above its surroundings,while this “castle” is a hole leading into hell. Our first view of Malebolge(the name is a Dantean coinage made up of words meaning “evil” and “pouches”)makes it seem like a vast, emptied stadium, e.g., the Colosseum, which Dantemight have seen in 1301 if he indeed visited Rome then, or the arena of Verona,which he probably saw at least by 1304. The former hypothesis is attractive inthat the second image of the canto is also modeled on Roman architecture: thebridge over the Tiber between the Vatican and the city.

[part0012.html#c18-s08-e] The panders, moving from left to right asDante views them, are moving in a direction contrary to his; the seducers,moving from his right to his left, and thus moving in parallel with him, aregoing faster than he; but then he has no demons lashing him with whips.

[part0012.html#c18-s10-e] The simile, reflecting the Roman invention oftwo-way traffic in 1300 for the crowds thronging to the holy places, on thebridge across the Tiber, from the city (to St. Peter’s, after they pass CastelSant’Angelo) and back again (to the area of Monte Giordano, just off the Tiber),has caused some to argue that Dante had been in Rome during the Jubilee. It ismore likely that he was in fact there in 1301 and heard tell of this modernwonder of crowd control. That the first city that Malebolge calls to mind isRome in the Jubilee Year is not without its ironic thrust, especially since ithad been Pope Boniface VIII, so hated by Dante, who proclaimed this great event(the first in the Church’s history).

[part0012.html#c18-s20-e] Venedico’s pleasantry insists that there aremore Bolognesi in this zone of hell than currently populate the city itself.“Sipa” is ancient dialectical Bolognese for “yes,” and thus the phrase means“have grown up speaking Bolognese dialect” between the rivers that mark theeastern and western confines of the city.

However, it wasonly some eighty years ago that Enrico Bianchi (Bian.1921.1) brought such acomprehension back to the verse, thereby increasing its power: the reference isto the Florentine custom of whipping a condemned man along the route to hisexecution.

Dante hasVirgil condense the lengthy narrative of Jason’s exploits found in Ovid (Metam.VII.1–424) into two details, the seductions of Hypsipyle (daughter of the kingof Lemnos) and of Medea (daughter of the king of Colchis).For the resonance at v. 91 of Beatrice’s description of Virgilian utterance as“parola ornata” see the note to Inf. II.67. As for Jason’s segni (signs oflove), Dante may be thinking of his ability to move Medea by tears as well aswords (see Metam. VII.169).

[part0012.html#c18-s45-e] Thaïs is a courtesan in Terence’s comicplay Eunuchus, and had a reputation even into the Middle Ages as a flatterer.Whether Dante is citing Terence directly (most currently dispute this) orthrough Cicero (De amicitia XXVI.98—a text that Dante assuredly did know andwhich explicitly associates Thaïs with flattery, though there and in Terence sheis the one flattered, not the flatterer) is a matter that still excitesargument.

[part0013.html#c19-s01-e] “In the Bible, Simon Magus was a sorcerer ofSamaria who was converted by the preaching of Philip the evangelist (see Acts8:9–13). When he subsequently attempted to buy the power of conferring the HolyGhost, he was severely rebuked by the apostle Peter for thinking that the giftof God might be purchased with money (see Acts 8:14–24). From the name Simon isderived the word ‘simony,’ which is applied to all traffic in sacred things,especially the buying or selling of ecclesiastical offices” (Singleton’scomment).For the intrinsic and striking distinction between the man named Simon, who wasa magus (Acts 8:9), and the apostle Peter, also named Simon (Simon Petrus—John20:2, 20:6), see Singleton (Sing.1965.1) as well as Herzman and Stephany(Herz.1978.1), pp. 40, 46. Nicholas is seen as the follower of Simon Magus,while Dante presents himself as the follower of Simon Peter.For studies of the canto as a whole see Fost.1969.1 and the third chapter ofMusa.1974.1.

[part0013.html#c19-s06-e] Some have argued that this passage is notcredible if taken literally and, therefore, must be understood as metaphorical.See Spitzer (Spit.1943.1) and, more recently, Noakes (Noak.1968.1), who arguesthat the public vow of adherence to the French king taken, in the baptistry andthus in proximity to the font, before Charles of Valois entered Florence in1302, is what Dante now confesses he “broke.” The language of the passage is soconcrete that it seems difficult to credit such an ingenious solution.Mazzoni (Mazz.1981.1) affirms the literal meaning of the passage, while leavingin doubt the nature of the act that Dante claims to have performed. Reviewingthe commentary tradition, he supports the view of most of the early commentatorsthat the noun battezzatori refers to the priests who performed baptismal rites.Mirko Tavoni (Tavo.1992.1) gives reasons for believing that it refers to thefonts themselves. That question is probably not resolvable, as the noun can haveeither meaning.All the early commentators take the incident referred to here as actually havingoccurred, when a child, playing with other children, became lodged in one of thesmaller baptismal fonts of the Florentine baptistry. Castelvetro has perhaps themost believable explanation; in his view the baptismal font and its severallittle pozzetti were protected by a thin wooden covering in order to protect theholy water from sight (and desacralizing droppings?). It is this and not themarble of the font (which Benvenuto da Imola has Dante breaking with an axebrought to him by a bystander) that the poet broke, thus saving the near-drownedchild. His solemn oath, reminiscent of the language describing papal bulls andtheir seals, now stakes his authority as Florentine and poet on the charitablenature of his act, which others had apparently characterized as sacrilegious.Whatever explanation we find most acceptable, it seems clear that Dante isreferring to an actual event that his former fellow-citizens would remember.[return to English [part0013.html#c19-s06-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c19-s06-i]]22–24. [part0013.html#c19-s08-e] We shall later learn that Dante here comesface to feet with a pope, Nicholas III (vv. 69–72). The inverted figure, likeJudas in the central mouth of Lucifer (Inf. XXXIV.63), has his head within, hislegs without. Dante’s use of bocca (mouth) for the opening of the hole intowhich he descends suggests that eventually Nicholas will be eaten and digestedby hell itself once the next simoniac pope comes to his eternal station.

[part0013.html#c19-s17-e] Dante now assumes the role of confessingfriar. The last verse of the tercet has caused controversy. While cessare, usedtransitively, ordinarily in Dante means “to avoid,” most agree that here itmeans “delay.” In our translation we have tried to hedge, using “stay” in such away as to allow it to be interpreted either as “put off (for a while)” or “put astop to.” [return to English [part0013.html#c19-s17-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c19-s17-i]]52–53.

[part0013.html#c19-s23-e] Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini)served from 1277–80, openly practicing nepotism in favor of his relations. Hisreferences to the “she-bear” and her “cubs” reflect his family name, Orsini(orsa means “bear” in Italian), one of the most powerful of Roman families.[return to English [part0013.html#c19-s23-e] / Italian[part0020.html#c19-s23-i]]79–87. [part0013.html#c19-s27-e] Clement is compared to Jason, brother of thehigh priest Onias. From the king of Syria, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, he bought hisbrother’s position and then brought pagan practices to Jerusalem (see II Mach.4:7–26). In short, to Dante he seemed a Jewish “simoniac pope,” prefiguring thecorrupt practices of Clement. Dante condemns, as Durling points out(Durl.1996.1, p. 300), a number of Clement’s actions, including “his role inPhilip’s destruction of the Templars, Purg. XX.91–93; the removal of the papalsee to Avignon, Purg. XXXII.157–160; his simony, Par. XVII.82; and his betrayalof Henry VII, Par. XXX.142–148.”This is perhaps the crucial passage for those who debate the internal dating ofthe composition of the poem. First, one should explain its literal meaning.Nicholas has now been “cooking” for twenty years (1280–1300). The FrenchmanBertrand de Got, who served as Pope Clement V from 1305–1314 and who supervisedthe papacy’s removal to Avignon in 1309, an act that caused much Italian outrage(and notably Dante’s [see Purg. XXXII.157–160; Epist. XI.21–26]), will replaceBoniface as topmost simoniac pope before Boniface spends twenty years in thatposition of punishment, i.e., before 1323. If the first cantica was composed, asmany, but not all, propose, between 1306–07 and 1309–10, Dante here is eithermaking a rough (and chancy) prediction that Clement, who suffered from illhealth, would die sometime before 1323, or he is knowingly referring to thedeath of Clement in 1314. However, most, observing Dante’s general practice in“predicting” only things actually known to him, argue that this is a prophecypost eventum, i.e., that the passage was written after April of 1314, whenClement died. If that is true, then either the traditional dating of the poem’scomposition is incorrect, and it was written later (and much more quickly) thanis generally believed (ca. 1313–1321), or Dante inserted this passage while hewas revising Inferno in 1315 before circulating it. This is Petrocchi’s solution(Petr.1969.1), and many follow it. For an opposing view, see Padoan(Pado.1993.1). And for a summary of the question and bibliography see A. E.Quaglio, “Commedia, Composizione,” ED (vol. 2, 1970), pp. 81–82.That this is the only reference to Clement before well into Purgatorio lendssupport to the idea that this passage is a later interpolation. In a paperwritten in 1999 Stefano Giannini (Gian.1999.1), a graduate student at JohnsHopkins University, examined all the references to events occurring after 1300in Inferno. His provisional results are as follows: 22 references to eventsoccurring between 1300 and 1304; 4 references to events occurring between 1306and 1309 (all between Cantos XXVI and XXIX); this sole reference to an eventoccurring in 1314. These results would certainly seem to support those whomaintain that this passage is a later interpolation and that Inferno wasessentially completed during the first decade of the fourteenth century.

[part0013.html#c19-s30-e] Dante’s coyness here is palpable: of course heis not being “too bold” (troppo folle) in the eyes of any just observer.

[part0013.html#c19-s30-e] Dante’s great outburst of invective againstNicholas (and all simoniac popes) is based on the history of the Church,beginning with Christ’s calling of Peter, moving to Peter’s and the otherapostles’ choosing Matthias by lot to take the place of Judas. After Dantealludes to Nicholas’s vile maneuvering against the Angevin king, Charles I ofSicily, he returns to the Bible, now to Rev. 17, interpreted positively as thepresentation of the Roman Church as keeper of the seven gifts of the Holy Spiritand the Ten Commandments. (For the relationship between the woman here [Rome ashonest wife of the Caesars, free of papal constraint] and the whore ofPurgatorio XXXII [Rome as the corrupted Church after the Donation ofConstantine] see Davis [Davi.1998.1], p. 271.) Dante’s oration ends with a finalslam at papal worship of “the golden calf,” joining the final apostrophe of thecanto in rebuke of Constantine as the source of most of Christianity’s troubleswhen he granted the papacy temporal authority. [return to English[part0013.html#c19-s30-e] / Italian [part0020.html#c19-s30-i]]115–117. [part0013.html#c19-s39-e] The author’s apostrophe of the emperorConstantine (reigned 306–337) holds him responsible for the so-called “Donationof Constantine,” by which he granted temporal sovereignty to Pope Sylvester I(314–335)—and his successors—over Italy and the rest of the western empire. Thisdocument was considered genuine until Lorenzo Valla, in the fifteenth century,demonstrated that it was a forgery. For Dante it was genuine and a cause forexcited concern. (His views on the subject are exposited forcefully in the laterMonarchia [III.x.1–9]). In his view the emperor was not empowered to give overhis authority; thus the document was truthful, but its legitimacy compromised.We are perhaps meant to understand by these lines that Sylvester, who curedConstantine of leprosy and was, as a result, rewarded by him with authority overthe Roman Empire, is the bottom-most pope in this hole, the “first rich Father,”a condition that was to his immediate benefit but to the eventual loss of allChristians.

[part0013.html#c20-s01-e] The uniquely self-conscious opening of thiscanto, featuring the only explicit numeration of a canto in the poem, has causeda certain puzzlement and even consternation. One discussant, H. D. Austin, hasargued that its prosaic superfluity recommends that future editors either exciseit from the poem, as an addition by an overenthusiastic scribe, or at leastprint it in square brackets (Aust.1932.1, pp. 39–40). Its self-consciousness anddifficulty, one might argue in rejoinder, are precisely signs of Danteanauthorship.The opening line portrays a poet who only unwillingly commits himself to thedifficult task he now must assume. Many of the words of this first tercet havereceived close critical attention. Nova has either the sense (or both senses, asour translation would indicate) of “new” or “strange” (see D’Ovidio[Dovi.1926.1], p. 318). Matera is, as Chiavacci Leonardi says (Chia.1991.1), p.599, a “technical term,” one used to denote the subject that a writer chooses totreat. Canto is here used for the first time (it will be used again only at Inf.XXXIII.90, Par. V.16 and V.139) to indicate a part of the poem; as Bara´nski(Bara.1995.3, pp. 3–4) has pointed out, the early commentators found this termstrange, rendering it with Latin or Italian words for “chapter” or “book.”Canzone is a still more troubling choice of word (it is used twice more, Purg.XXXI.134, XXXII.90); in De vulgari eloquentia (e.g., Dve II.viii.2–9) it is theword (cantio in Dante’s Latin) that describes the lofty vernacular ode thatDante presents (with himself as most successful practitioner of the form) as theheight of poetic eloquence in the mother tongue, and thus “tragic” in tone,because it is like the lofty style of the classical poets. Is Dante suggestingthat Inferno is tragic? (For some thoughts along this line see Hollander[Holl.1980.1], pp. 137–40.) It is only in Purg. XXXIII.140 that he will finallygive a part of the poem the name it now enjoys: cantica, with its religious(resonance of Solomon’s Canticle of Canticles [see Pert.1991.1, pp. 107–8]) and“comic” overtones. And finally there is the apparently strikingly inexact wordsommersi, which has seemed to many commentators wrong, since the damned are notsubmerged in water but buried under earth. Marino Barchiesi (Barc.1973.2), p.85, resolved this problem by finding a probable source in the Aeneid (VI.267),where Virgil asks the gods for permission “pandere res alta terra et caliginemersas” (to reveal things immersed deep in earth and darkness).If the opening tercet causes this much difficulty, what follows will often be atleast as challenging. One of the most interesting and provocative studies of thecanto remains Parodi’s essay (Paro.1908.1). It is a canto that is still todayrenowned for its problematic nature.

[part0013.html#c20-s02-e] The first description of the diviners insistsupon their silence and their misery, expressed by tears, the only form ofexpression allowed them, given the fact that their necks are twisted, thuscutting off the possibility of speech.

[part0013.html#c20-s04-e] Hollander has suggested (Holl.1980.1, p. 141)that the image of the twisted necks of the diviners, with the resultant loss ofthe capacity of speech, may have been suggested by a text in Lucan (Phars.V.197), in which Apollo closes off the throat of a prophetess (Phemonoe) beforeshe can reveal the rest of a dire prophecy, thus depriving her Roman listener ofnews of his unhappy destiny: “Cetera suppressit faucesque obstruxit Apollo”(Apollo closed her throat and suppressed the rest of her speech).

[part0013.html#c20-s07-e] The first tercet of this fourth address tothe reader in this cantica (see note to Inf. VIII.94–96) is generally understoodas indicating that, given the sad sight he must behold, Dante is excusinghimself from blame for weeping. Benvenuto da Imola, however, has a differingview (and says that “this subtle fiction is poorly understood by many others”).According to him, Dante’s tears reveal his guilty feelings about his owninvolvement in astrological prediction and that “as a result he presents himselfas weeping out of compassion for others, and for himself because of his ownerrors.” It is possible to read the passage in an even harsher light. If thereader is to “gather fruit” from reading this passage, is it not likely that itspoint is that Dante was wrong to weep for these creatures? What he feels issadness at the human figure rendered so contorted, forgetting the reason for the(entirely just) punishment.

[part0013.html#c20-s09-e] Dante weeps and thereby earns Virgil’s rebuke(which commentators since Tommaseo have related to the words that Jesus directedto Peter and the other apostles, slow to take his meaning, found in Matthew15:16: “Adhuc et vos sine intellectu estis?” (Are you also even yet withoutunderstanding?) A question that has exercised many readers is whether theprotagonist already knows that those punished here are the diviners. While some,like Ettore Caccia (Cacc.1967.1, p. 695) and Antonino Pagliaro (Pagl.1967.1, p.611), argue that Dante weeps only at the piteous condition of the contortedhuman body, and not for the lot of the diviners, others, like Marino Barchiesi(Barc.1973.1, p. 62) reply that such distinction-making is oversubtle. Indeed,the whole context of the canto would make it seem necessary that Virgil’s rebukeis not aimed at so wide a target, but rather at Dante’s failure to reactadversely to the diviners. [return to English [part0013.html#c20-s09-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c20-s09-i]]28–30. [part0013.html#c20-s10-e] Perhaps the tercet in the canto that hascaused the most debate. Where is “here” (qui)? Who is indicated by the first“who” (chi)? And what does the last verse of the tercet mean? In response to thefirst two questions, Hollander has made the following observations (Holl.1980.1,p. 147), dividing the most plausible series of answers into two groups: “(1) IfDante weeps for lost humanity in general, qui refers to hell in general and chialmost certainly refers to Dante. (2) If Dante weeps for the diviners inparticular, qui refers to this bolgia and chi almost certainly applies to thediviners.” Carlo Steiner, in his commentary to this passage, argues that itseems logically inconsistent for Virgil to call Dante “witless” at v. 27 and“impious” at v. 29, as stupidity and impiety are some stages distant one fromanother.As for the complicated philological problem regarding the exact reading of verse30, this writer, along with many another, accepts the arguments of Petrocchi(Petr.1966.1, pp. 181–82) for the reading “passion comporta” (and not“compassion porta” or “passïon porta”). For a fuller exposition, based on textsin Statius and St. Augustine, see Holl.1980.1, pp. 147–57, citing, forAugustine, the earlier discussions of Filomusi Guelfi (Filo.1911.1), pp. 192–95;and now see Puccetti (Pucc.1994.1), pp. 199–206.

Having warned Danteagainst the sin of divination, he now proceeds to identify its exemplars,beginning with five classical diviners. The first of these derives from Statius.“Amphiaraus … was one of the seven kings who joined in the expedition againstThebes (Inf. XIV.68); foreseeing that the issue would be fatal to himself, heconcealed himself to avoid going to the war, but his hiding-place was revealedby his wife Eriphyle, who had been bribed by Polynices with the necklace ofHarmonia (Purg. XII.50–51). Amphiaraus, as had been foreseen, met his death atThebes, being swallowed up by the earth, but before he died he enjoined his sonAlcmaeon to put Eriphyle to death on his return from Thebes, in punishment ofher betrayal of him (Par. IV.103–105)” (T). The incidents referred to here are asomewhat reinvented version of the narrative found in Statius (ThebaidVII.690–823; VIII.1–210). For Dante’s willful distortions of the story of thisaugur, who is portrayed with great sympathy by Statius, see Holl.1980.1, pp.170–73.

[part0013.html#c20-s14-e] “Tiresias, famous soothsayer of Thebes.According to the story he once separated with his staff two serpents which hefound coupled in a wood, whereupon he was changed into a woman for seven years;at the expiration of this period he found the same two serpents and struck themagain, whereupon he was changed back into a man. Subsequently, Jupiter and Junohaving differed as to which of the two sexes experienced the greater [sexual]pleasure, the question was referred to Tiresias, as having belonged to bothsexes, and he decided in favour of woman, which coincided with the opinion ofJupiter; Juno thereupon in anger struck him with blindness, but Jupiter, by wayof compensation, endowed him with the gift of prophecy (Ovid, Metam.III.316–38)” (T). For a study of Dante’s recasting of Ovid’s essentiallypositive presentation of Tiresias, making him a repulsive figure rather than thetruthful and blameless seer he is in Ovid, with particular attention to theverga, or magic wand, that Dante contrives for him, thus associating him withCirce and Mercury, see Holl.1980.1, pp. 173–84.

I.584–638) foretold the civil war, which was to end in thedeath of Pompey and the triumph of Caesar. Dante … describes him as having dweltin a cave … in the Carrara hills” (T). Castelvetro, in his comment on thispassage, points out that, in Lucan’s text, Aruns does not dwell in a cave butwithin the walls of Luni and that, furthermore, he was not an astrologer (asDante implies) but used other means to develop his soothsaying (e.g., studyingthe flight of birds, the innards of animals, the course of the thunderbolt).[return to English [part0013.html#c20-s16-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c20-s16-i]]52–56. [part0013.html#c20-s18-e] “Manto, daughter of Tiresias, Thebanprophetess…; Dante here puts into Virgil’s mouth an account of the founding ofMantua by Manto … which is totally inconsistent with Virgil’s own account asgiven in the Aeneid (X.198–200). By an oversight Dante also includes la figliadi Tiresia, who can be none other than Manto, among the persons mentioned byStatius who Virgil says are together with himself in Limbo (Purg. XXII.113)”(T). Compared with the violence done to classical texts in the preceding threeexamples (Amphiaraus, Tiresias, and Aruns), that done to Virgil’s tale of Mantois even more remarkable. Even her hair seems to belong to another, whether theuncombed locks of frenetic Erichtho (“inpexis … comis”—Phars. VI.518), asBenvenuto da Imola suggested, or those of the Sibyl (perhaps the “source” forLucan’s witch’s hair), “non comptae … comes” (Aeneid VI.48), as noted byGrabher. Since the Roman poet, as surely Dante realized, had deliberatelyassociated his birthplace (Pietola, then probably known as Andes, near Mantua)with Manto, so as to make himself, like her, a vates, or prophet (see the studyby Marie Desport [Desp.1952.1]), Dante now makes his maestro ed autore recantthe fiction that he himself had devised. (Virgil’s commentators themselves hadwondered how the Greek Manto could have come to Italy in order to found hercity, since Virgil’s poem is the only text to contain this claim.)One of the lasting problems left by this canto is its eventual contradiction ofDante’s placement of Manto in Limbo in Purgatorio XXII.113, where Virgil tellsStatius that various of the characters of whom the later poet wrote are found inthat zone of the afterworld. Previous writers had resorted to varioushypotheses, none particularly satisfying, in order to explain how Dante couldhave forgotten what he had said about Manto here when he wrote the laterpassage, or that, with equal failure to satisfy, “the daughter of Tiresias” ofPurgatorio XXII was someone other than Manto, or even that the original textread something other than “la figlia di Tiresia.” Two Americans have arguedindependently that the apparent contradiction is intentional, and is based onDante’s willful insistence that the Manto portrayed by Virgil was indeed adiviner, while the same character portrayed by Statius was not (she is ratherthe dutiful daughter of Tiresias, helping with the chores, as it were). SeeRichard Kay (Kay.1978.2) and Robert Hollander (Holl.1980.1), pp. 205–13. Kayalso argues, less convincingly, that Dante thought of Virgil’s Manto ashistorical and of Statius’s character as fictive, thus further excusing thebilocation.

[part0013.html#c20-s19-e] With risible understatement, the poet hasVirgil ask for a little of the protagonist’s time (his digression will continueuntil verse 99, occupying fully fourteen terzine). This passage begins bytacitly acknowledging the utter fictiveness of this account, since we have nosource for what happened to Manto after Tiresias’s death (and the conquest ofThebes by Creon). Dante puts, into the mouth of Virgil, an account of her voyageinto Italy. As is the case for that undertaken by Ulysses in Canto XXVI, thereis no known source for this one, either.

[part0013.html#c20-s21-e] We turn our attention from the story of Mantoin order to examine the landscape of Italy, to which she will repair in herwanderings. Benaco is now known as Lake Garda.

She is described as“vergine cruda” (cruel virgin [in the sense that she does not like the companyof men]), a phrase that may reflect Statius’s description of her (ThebaidIV.463) as “innuba Manto” and/or Dante’s description of that other diviner,Erichtho, who is “Eritón cruda” at Inf. IX.23. Here she practiced her divinatoryarts with her servants and died. Those who had fled her fearsome presencereturned after her death and built Virgil’s city upon her bones, giving it hername, but not her divinatory capacity. What is at first shocking about thisaccount is that it contradicts what we find in the Aeneid, where (X.198–203) welearn that the city was founded by Ocnus, the son of Manto. In other words,Dante has excised (indeed, has forced Virgil himself to excise) Ocnus. For ifManto had had progeny, as she did according to Virgil, then her mantic abilitymight have been passed on to others—the claim that Virgil was evidently himselfbent upon making in his poem, only to be forced to recant it here in Dante’s. Itis an extraordinary moment. [return to English [part0013.html#c20-s29-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c20-s29-i]]94–96. [part0013.html#c20-s32-e] Dante’s reference to alate-thirteenth-century political disaster in Mantua probably seems gratuitousto the modern reader. Given the poet’s concern with the condition of his ownFlorence, however, we can appreciate his interest in the dramatic eventsresulting from when the Guelph leader of Mantua, the Count of Casalodi, allowedhimself to be tricked by the Ghibelline Pinamonte Bonacolsi, who apparentlyconvinced him to expel many of the nobles in order to mollify the populace,angered by his having come from Brescia to rule in 1272. Foolishly exiling evenmembers of his own party, he was in time bereft of supporters; in 1291,Pinamonte led a popular revolt that sent the count into exile and killed theremaining noble families. The tercet offered Dante a moment’s bitter reflectionupon his own condition as exiled Guelph, brought about by the similar folly ofhis fellow citizens. [return to English [part0013.html#c20-s32-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c20-s32-i]]97–102. [part0013.html#c20-s33-e] Capping his (to us absurd yet amusing)contradiction of the details of the founding of Mantua published in his ownpoem, Virgil now gets Dante to swear that he will regard only the currentversion of that history as truthful, and that he will consider any otherversion, i.e., the Roman poet’s own, as nothing other than a lie. Theprotagonist dutifully assents. Thus is Virgil made to remove the stain ofdivination from his poem and from himself. The result is eventually quitedifferent from what the tactic might have been intended to secure, i.e.,Virgil’s poem is seen precisely as associated with this fault. See Barolini(Baro.1998.1), pp. 283–84. [return to English [part0013.html#c20-s33-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c20-s33-i]]106–114. [part0013.html#c20-s36-e] “Eurypylus, augur sent by the Greeks toconsult the oracle of Apollo as to their departure from Troy; he brought backthe reply that, as their departure from Greece had cost them a bloody sacrificein the death of Iphigenia, so by blood must they purchase their return (Aen.II.114–119). Dante, who describes Eurypylus as having a long beard,…makes Virgilsay (vv. 110–113) that Eurypylus was associated with Calchas in foretelling thetime of the sailing of the Greek fleet from Aulis; but there is no mention ofthis fact in the Aeneid” (T). Toynbee’s version is not exactly correct. Not evenin Sinon’s lying account of these events, to which the text refers, is Eurypylussaid to be an augur: the message that he brings back from Apollo’s shrine isthen interpreted by Calchas, the “true” augur in the Aeneid, to mean that Sinonmust be sacrificed. We should reflect that Dante must have realized that none ofwhat Sinon says is truthful. Yet he nonetheless uses this material in order toconcoct his own still more inauthentic version of events. See Holl.1980.1, pp.200–3.The phrase with which Virgil indicates the Aeneid, “l’alta mia tragedìa,” hascaused only some debate, as most commentators believe that, for Dante, withregard to its plot, Virgil’s epic was a “comedy” because it begins in difficulty(the shipwreck that initiates the action) and ends in happiness (the impendingmarriage of Aeneas and Lavinia; the impending foundation of Rome). Its style, onthe other hand, is generally seen as lofty, and thus, in Dante’s understandingof such things, “tragic” (see, for example, Inf. XXVI.82, where Virgil alsorefers to epic writing as being in the high, or tragic style: “quando nel mondogli alti versi scrissi” [when, in the world, I wrote my lofty verses]). For anattack on the usual understanding, beginning with the view that Virgil’s phrasewould then be pleonastic (“l’alta mia tragedìa” would need to be understood ashaving the sense of “my lofty high poem,” twice referring to the stylistic levelof the work), and arguing that both for a few early commentators and in Dante’sown views the plot of the Aeneid is indeed tragic, see Holl.1980.1, pp. 214–18;Holl.1983.1, pp. 130–34; Holl.1993.2, pp. 19, 62–66. According to this reading,the meaning of Virgil’s phrase is that his poem is lofty in style and unhappy atits conclusion, the death of Turnus at the hands of Aeneas, who gives over theideal of clemency when he kills his enemy.

[part0013.html#c20-s43-e] Once again (see, for example, Inf.XVI.106–108) Dante adds a detail to an earlier scene in the poem, the prologue,the action of which takes place on this earth. There is no mention of the moonin the first canto. It is also not possible that Virgil means yesterday night,as some propose, for Dante and Virgil were then already in hell, having beguntheir descent on Friday evening after Dante spent his night in the wood onThursday: “ ‘yesternight,’ i.e. the night before last, it being now earlymorning” is the explanation offered in Tozer’s gloss on this verse.

Having proscribed the word introcque from theillustrious vernacular in De vulgari eloquentia (Dve I.xiii.2), Dante hereemploys it. It is a latinism (derived from inter hoc) and means, roughly,“meanwhile.” That is how Dante uses it as an example of crude Florentine“municipal” speech in De vulgari: “Since we ain’t got nuthin’ else to do, let’seat” would be a colloquial American equivalent of the example he gives. Ifwriters of the illustrious vernacular are to avoid such expressions, we areperhaps forced to reflect that Dante’s Comedy, unlike Virgil’s lofty Tragedy, iswritten in the low style (and has a “happy ending”).

[part0013.html#c21-s01-e] What is the subject under discussion as thetravelers leave the fourth bridge and reach the midpoint of the fifth? Mostcommentators simply avoid the issue, which probably must remain moot, asConrieri argues (Conr.1981.1, pp. 1–2).Dante’s choice of title for his work caused some early commentators difficulty,but not all of them. Guido da Pisa, for instance, nearly certainly echoing theepistle to Cangrande, says that this work is a comedy because, like othercomedies, it begins in misery and adversity and ends in prosperity and happiness(incipiunt a miseria et adversitate et finiunt in prosperitatem et felicitatem).Others see only the stylistic reference of the term, as in the case ofBenvenuto, for whom the title simply means “my book in the vernacular” (meusliber vulgaris). But others, like Francesco da Buti, allow that they arepuzzled, wondering whether or not Dante should so have entitled it, but thenallowing that it was his right to do whatever he chose. For a briefconsideration of Dante’s sense of tragedy and comedy see the concludingdiscussion in the note to Inferno XX.106–114.

[part0013.html#c21-s03-e] Castelvetro objects that Dante’s wonderfullyenergetic simile is almost entirely made up of extraneous elements, i.e., heneeded only to say that the pitch in the bolgia was as black as that in thearsenal at Venice. Of course, that is the beauty of it, as Dante paints hisscene as though he had seen the pictures of Brueghel before they were painted.Trucchi’s gloss points out that the “honest mercantilism” of the Venetians, withall its vitality, stands against the sordid conniving of barrators. The pitch,the punishing agent of this bolgia, is the apt sign of the nature of barrators(whom we today call “grafters”), working in secret and leaving suchpractitioners enlimed with its sticky sign, attaching to all who practice thiskind of fraud. “Barratry, the buying and selling of public office, is the civilequivalent of simony, the buying and selling of church office, the sin punishedin the third bolgia” (Singleton’s comment).Verse 11, “chi fa suo legno novo,” is understood by nearly all the commentatorsto refer to the construction of new ships. However, the entire context hereinvolves the rebuilding of existent vessels; thus our translation has it thatthis phrase refers to making an old ship new.

The elders of Lucca were the city’s magistrates,similar in their governance to the priors of Florence. Zita was a young servantwoman of the city, dead in the 1270s, to whom were reputed great kindness andnumerous miracles. While she was not canonized until 1690, she was reputed asaint shortly after her death, and her cult flourished around her tomb in thechurch of San Frediano in Lucca.As for the identity of this nameless Lucchese, Guido da Pisa seems to have beenthe first commentator to say that he was Martino Bottario (or Bottai). He seemsto have shared political (and thus grafting) power with Bonturo Dati, mentionedin v. 41. There is another fact about him that is striking: he apparently died,according to Guido, on 26 March 1300, that is, at least in certain calculations,on the very day that is now unfolding in Dante’s poem. Francesco da Buticonfirms his name and also registers the date of his death, now given as theFriday night before Holy Saturday (but only referring to the month of March,strangely, since Good Friday fell on 9 April in 1300). Later commentators, ifthey refer to this material, all have the death date as occurring on 9 April,even though this is not authorized by the first commentators to claim thatMartino is the Lucchese here present.

The notion that barrators come straight fromearth to this point in hell, carried off by a devil, seems to violate the rulethat all must cross Acheron with Charon (Inf.

Even the black Cherub who carries off the soulof Guido da Montefeltro is said (by Guido himself) to have carried him only asfar as Minos (Inf. XXVII.124). Thus Singleton reasons that the devil at leaststops briefly at Minos’s place of judgment in order to allow the formalsentencing to take place. (Must we also imagine that he accompanies barratorsfrom Lucca aboard Charon’s skiff?) It is surely true that Dante is generallyprecise in honoring the ground rules that he establishes; it is also true thathe has written a poem, one that allows him to please his fancy when he chooses.[return to English [part0013.html#c21-s13-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c21-s13-i]]41–42.

Does this sinnerreturn to the surface with his face now covered with pitch (in which case heresembles the ebony face of Christ on the much-venerated image of theCrucifixion in San Martino, in Lucca)? or is he bent in two, emerging with hisbackside from the pitch (in which case he looks like a citizen of Lucca kneelingto prostrate himself before the image)? Strong arguments are made for eachinterpretation, and each is supported by a further text (Inf. XXII.25–28,19–24), in which the sinners in this bolgia are compared, second to frogs withonly their snouts out of water, first to dolphins showing their backs as theymove through water.

Some Renaissance commentators (e.g., Vellutelloand Daniello) insist on the proximity of the word baratta to barratry, whichwould indicate that the word is likely to indicate a previous scuffle with thesevery demons—who certainly seem the types to have bothered Virgil on his descentto Cocytus when Erichtho sent him on his mission down there (Inf. IX.22–27). Thefirst commentator in the DDP to try a different tack is Singleton, who arguesthat the primary reference is to Virgil’s difficulties with the devils at thewalls of Dis (see Inf. VIII, 82–130) or to some skirmish that he had with thesedevils on his previous journey to lower hell (Inf. IX, 22–30). The fact thatVirgil is shortly to be found out of his depth in his struggle with theMalebranche, again after exhibiting self-confidence in the face of hostiledemons, supports this reading.

[part0013.html#c21-s23-e] Virgil’s calm assurance is shredded by theattack of the “dogs” who rush out upon him, a poor beggar. The simile is hard onVirgil, who only barely manages to regain control of the situation, which, weremember, is being observed by Dante, squatting in hiding on the bridge.

[part0013.html#c21-s26-e] The entry on the scene of Malacoda(“Eviltail”), the lead devil of the Malebranche of Malebolge, is perfectly incharacter, as we shall see.

[part0013.html#c21-s27-e] Virgil’s aplomb, his “high style” contrastingwith demonic “vernacular,” serves at once to set him apart from the “low-life”devils and their leader, Malacoda, but also to make him seem slightlyridiculous, since Malacoda, not he, is eventually in control of the situation,as Virgil will only finally realize, to his considerable chagrin, in CantoXXIII.140–141. Virgil’s reference in v. 83 to the fact that he is not alone(“Let us proceed”) for the first time alerts Malacoda and his cohort to Dante’shidden presence.

The devils, sensing fresh meat, crowd forward.

Dante was present at the successful siege ofCaprona in 1289, a cavalryman observing the success of the mission of his TuscanGuelphs against this Pisan stronghold. It is to his lasting credit that what heremembers for us is how the victims must have felt when they came out under apact of safe conduct. Dante, exiled on the charge of barratry by his fellowcitizens, here perhaps means to remind them that he had borne arms on behalf ofthe republic in its victories, the siege of Caprona in August 1289 and theprevious great victory at Campaldino that June, referred to later in this scene(XXII.4–5). He was not a grafter, scheming in the dark, but a cavalryman who didhis deeds in the fearsome clarity of war. There have been several attempts inthe last two centuries to relate the scenes and personages of these cantos ofbarratry to Dante’s own experiences as accused barrator perfidiously sent intoexile on this pretext (and thus presented as attacked by the twelve priors ofFlorence, the Malebranche), and to his military experiences, offered asvindication against such malicious and untrue charges. For cautionary remarks,urging restraint in such interpretation, see Conrieri (Conr.1981.1), pp. 38–39.[return to English [part0013.html#c21-s32-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c21-s32-i]]100–105. [part0013.html#c21-s34-e] Dante’s fears are justified; onlyMalacoda’s intervention prevents the bullying devils from assaulting him withtheir hooks. Malacoda holds back Scarmiglione, encouraging him to await a morepropitious moment for his attack. Scarmiglione is the first of the twelve devilsto be named. He is apparently not included in the squad of ten put underBarbariccia’s control—see note to vv. 118–123. [return to English[part0013.html#c21-s34-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c21-s34-i]]106–111. [part0013.html#c21-s36-e] Malacoda’s partial truth (the sixth bridge,over the bolgia of hypocrisy, is in ruins) is quickly joined to a totalfabrication (the next bridge along their route is intact).

[part0013.html#c21-s38-e] This extraordinarily precise time referenceis the most certain text in the poem for establishing an external date for thejourney. It is 7 AM of Holy Saturday, since Christ, according to Dante (Conv.IV.xxiii.10), died at noon. In fact, Dante here is modifying the facts, if onthe authority of Luke 23:44, who gives the time of the preternatural darkness asnoon. Even Luke, however, is clear that Jesus died at 3 PM. Dante is willing torewrite any text to suit his purpose.From this passage we learn that the events narrated in this poem occurred inEaster week of 1300. However, and as we have seen, Dante seems to be conflatingtwo dates for the start of the journey, each of which is propitious, 25 Marchand 8 April (the actual date of Good Friday in 1300) in order to gain themaximum significant referentiality.

[part0013.html#c21-s40-e] Dante’s pleasure in developing nomiparlanti (names that bespeak the quality of their possessors) is evident here.His playful naming is based on the aggressive bestial characteristics of thesecreatures.Dante’s thoroughness and care in his handling of the demons’ names is underlinedby the fact that each of the ten members of the decina (from decuria, the Latinmilitary term for a “squad” of ten troopers) is named exactly once in thefollowing canto, as follows (with Sinclair’s [Sinc.1939.1, p. 279] Englishapproximations of some of these names in parentheses): Barbariccia(Curlybeard—XXII.29), Graffiacane (Scratchdog—34), Rubicante (Redface—40),Cirïatto (Swineface—55), Libicocco (70), Draghignazzo (Vile Dragon—73),Farfarello (94), Cagnazzo (Low Hound—106), Alichino (112), and Calcabrina (133).[return to English [part0013.html#c21-s40-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c21-s40-i]]125–126.

[part0013.html#c21-s43-e] Dante’s pleas to Virgil will fall on deafears, but we sense already (and will shortly have confirmed) that he, not hisguide, understands what the devils are up to.

[part0013.html#c21-s45-e] Virgil’s response to Dante’s question,based on correct observation and resultant correct interpretation of the devils’true motives, marks yet another moment in this canto in which the reader isnearly forced to observe how harshly the guide is being treated by the author.In recent years there has been an increasing acknowledgment of what should havebeen clear to any reader who is willing to give over the notion that the Comedyis essentially an “allegorical” poem in which the character Virgil represents“Reason.” See, among others, Bacchelli (Bacc.1954.1), Ryan.1982.2, Holl.1984.3.[return to English [part0013.html#c21-s45-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c21-s45-i]]136–139. [part0013.html#c21-s46-e] The devils either prepare to make or havealready made a farting sound with their tongues stuck through their teeth inanswer to Malacoda’s prior “war-signal” of a fart. See Sarolli’s appreciation ofthis low-mimetic scene as part of the tradition of musica diaboli, the hellishmusic that stands in total contrast with the heavenly music we shall hear inParadiso (Saro.1971.1, pp. 5n., 363–80). The perverse devils turn their mouthsinto anuses in preparing to answer Malacoda’s (and he is surely aptly named inlight of this sound) turning his anus into a bugle, the gestures constituting asign of “understanding among the malefactors and a sign of their derision forVirgil’s self-confident misreading of their intentions” (Holl.1984.3, p. 90).[return to English [part0013.html#c21-s46-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c21-s46-i]]INFERNO XXII [part0013.html#c22-e]1–12. [part0013.html#c22-s01-e] The similetic array of signals for troopmovements in battle or for the start of a sporting event, a small catalogue ofthings and techniques domestic and foreign, is, we remember, the poet’s way ofresponding to the demonic fart that concluded the last canto and ushered Danteoff on his journey under the guidance of the decuria, Malacoda’s squad, nowunder the control of Barbariccia. Vv. 4–5 are generally taken to refer to thebattle of Campaldino in 1289.This, even if it is not a “true simile,” is the first of eleven canto-openingsimiles in the poem. See Inferno XXIV.1–18; XXX.1–27; XXXI.1–6; PurgatorioVI.1–12; XVII.1–12; Paradiso IV.1–9; XVII.1–6; XXIII.1–12; XXIX.1–9; XXXI.1–15.[return to English [part0013.html#c22-s01-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c22-s01-i]]13–15. [part0013.html#c22-s05-e] Professor Kevin Brownlee, in a seminar atDartmouth College in 1985, suggested that these verses and the atmosphere of theentire scene in XXI and XXII reflect some earmarks of the French fabliau:physical violence, proverbial remarks, animalistic traits, physically strongercharacters being bested by cleverer weak ones.

[part0013.html#c22-s07-e] The two similes describe the actions of thebarrators in motion and at rest. They only move to relieve their pain for amoment or to duck under the pitch (thus increasing their pain) in order to avoida hooking by the devils—a pain still more disturbing, as well as embarrassing.It was apparently a current belief that dolphins approached ships when theysensed that a storm at sea was brewing.

NowBarbariccia extends his long arms around the place where the pitchy sinnerstands to ward the others off: he wants Ciampolo for himself.

[part0013.html#c22-s31-e] Once again the conversation between Ciampoloand Virgil is interrupted by the devils’ vicious sport, with order beingmaintained only by Barbariccia’s firm insistence.

[part0013.html#c22-s33-e] As crafty as his keepers, Ciampolo uses Danteand Virgil to set up his countermeasures, offering to bring to the surfacebarrators who will speak their language, Tuscans and Lombards (he has evidentlycaught the linguistic marks of their birthplaces in their accents). Dante, ofcourse, is variously recognized as a Tuscan from his speech, but it comes assomething of a surprise when we discover Virgil actually speaking in Lombarddialect (Inf. XXVII.20–21). [return to English [part0013.html#c22-s33-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c22-s33-i]]100–123. [part0013.html#c22-s34-e] The game Ciampolo devises involves thefollowing ploys on his part and reactions by the Malebranche: (1) Ciampolo’scleverly indirect invitation to the devils to withdraw so as not to frighten off(putative) emergent Tuscans and Lombards whom he, sitting down to show his ownapparent good faith, will whistle up if there are no devils visible; (2)Cagnazzo’s understanding that this is a ruse; (3) Ciampolo’s countermove: “Butyou must give them room. Do you think I would cause my fellow-sufferers stillgreater suffering?” (of course he would!); (4) Alichino’s being won over byCiampolo’s wiles, mainly because he is so eager for a fight, whether Ciampolo istricking them or not; he gets all his mates, even the suspicious Cagnazzo (andBarbariccia, we must surmise), to move down behind the ridge so as not to bevisible from the pitch and challenges Ciampolo to try to escape him, if he dare;(5) Ciampolo’s dive from the ridge as he makes good his escape. The rhythm ofthis central action in Canto XXII parallels that in the previous canto, in whichtwo observers have entirely different interpretations of the same phenomena.Cagnazzo and Alichino here respectively play the parts of Dante and Virgil inthe previous scene: Cagnazzo and Dante discern the motives of Ciampolo and thedevils, respectively, while Alichino and Virgil do not.At v. 123 we have translated the noun proposto as “designs,” i.e., “intention,”as Bosco/Reggio argue in their comment to this verse.

[part0013.html#c22-s42-e] The postlude to Ciampolo’s escape also isfilled with action: (1) Alichino speeds after the Navarrese but cannot catch upwith him; (2) Calcabrina takes out his rage on Alichino, whose gullibility ledto the loss of their plaything; (3) they both fall into the pitch.

[part0014.html#c23-s01-e] The quiet opening of the canto compares the twotravelers to pairs of Franciscan mendicants. As John of Serravalle reminds us inhis comment to this passage, the more authoritative of the two traditionallywent before. Thus, when we consider the considerable time spent in exploringVirgil’s difficulties in the preceding two cantos, we probably ought to perceivethe delicate irony inherent in these verses. [return to English[part0014.html#c23-s01-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c23-s01-i]]4–18. [part0014.html#c23-s02-e] The fable runs roughly as follows: a mouse,wishing to cross a river, is advised by an apparently friendly frog to allowhimself to be attached to that frog by a string, to which project he consents.Once the frog, mouse in tow, reaches midstream, he dives in an attempt to drownthe mouse. An overflying kite, or hawk, seeing the struggling mouse atop thewaters, dives down, captures and kills the mouse—and the attached frog, a bonus.It seems sensible to believe that, as the protagonist reviews the events of theprior canto, he thinks of two things: the aptness of the fable to the situationof Ciampolo (mouse), Alichino (frog), and Calcabrina (kite), as well as to hisown: Dante (mouse), Virgil (frog), and the Malebranche (kite). Thus thebeginning and the end of the fable are particularly apt to his situation: inorder to reach the next bolgia he has tied himself to Virgil, and now the kitemust be on its way. That Virgil should be cast in the role of the double-dealingfrog seemed so unlikely that apparently no one, before Guyler, pp. 35–40,suggested as much. While this writer agrees with him, the complexity of thepassage, it should be noted, guarantees that its meaning will continue to bedebated.The words “mo” and “issa” are both dialectical forms, meaning “right now,”derived from the Latin modo (used again in this canto at v. 28 and a total oftwenty-five times in the poem) and ipsa hora (see Purg. XXIV.55). Hollander(Holl.1984.3), p. 93, suggests that the choice of words for “now” accentuatesthe imminent and immediate danger in which Dante finds himself.The absolute source of this fable of “Aesop” is not known, but it seems thatDante may have been acquainted with both the collection circulated under thename Romulus, which McKenzie (McKe.1900.1) says is the (Carolingian) collectionadverted to by the various fourteenth-century commentators who discuss thepassage, and the later one (12th century) assembled by Waltherius Anglicus.Clara Kraus (“Esopo,” ED, vol. 2, 1970, pp. 729–30) points out, followingMcKenzie, that this particular fable derives from an unknown non-Aesopic source,even if the poet presents it as being by him. (Dante had referred to Aesop oncepreviously: Conv. IV.xxx.4. For the question of sources see also Mandruzzato(Mand.1955.1) and Guyler (Guyl.1972.1), pp. 29–31, the latter reviewing thediscussions of McKenzie, Larkin (Lark.1962.1 and Lark.1966.1), and Padoan(Pado.1964.1) and eventually favoring Waltherius as source text.

For Dante’s hair, curling tight with fear, Pietrodi Dante adduces Aeneid II.774: “steteruntque comae” (and my hair stood on end).The setting for the scene is the night of the destruction of Troy. A few linesearlier (v. 733), Aeneas is warned by his father, Anchises, to flee:“nate,…fuge, nate; propinquant” (my son, my son, flee—they are coming closer).Moments later, Aeneas realizes that he has lost Creusa, and turns back to theflaming city to find her. His wife’s ghost appears to him in a vision that isthe cause of his hair standing on end. If Dante was thinking of this scene, asPietro believed, he has perhaps put Anchises’ warning about the fast-approachingGreek marauders into his own mouth, the advice he might have expected to haveheard from Virgil, his “father,” and the author of that scene. For theseobservations see Hollander (Holl.1984.3), p. 94. [return to English[part0014.html#c23-s07-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c23-s07-i]]25–30. [part0014.html#c23-s09-e] As Mark Musa (Musa.1977.1) has pointed out,Virgil, here and elsewhere (Inf. IV.51; X.17–18; XVI.119–120; XIX.39;XXVI.73–74), is either accorded by the protagonist or confers upon himself thepower of “reading Dante’s mind.” Musa shows that, rather than the power actuallyto read the protagonist’s thoughts, Virgil’s capacity is one of heightenedrationality, not the kind of supernatural power enjoyed by Beatrice, who, likeall beatified souls, has precisely the ability to read the unvoiced thoughts ofothers; in other words, Virgil is able to fathom what Dante is thinking from thecontext of the experiences that they share, and nothing more than that.Dante refers to mirrors being made by backing clear glass with lead in ConvivioIII.ix.8.

[part0014.html#c23-s13-e] This simile, classical in form, seems to haveno classical counterpart (although the fires of dying Troy may come to mind),whether in image or in language; rather, it seems to be among those that Dantedraws from contemporary experience, ruinous fires being a pronounced feature ofmedieval town life. Virgil’s customary paternal role here is resolved into amaternal one. That we should take this surprising change as meant positively isguaranteed by a later scene, just as Virgil has left the poem and returned toLimbo. At this moment of greatest pathos involving Dante’s love for his guideand teacher, Dante turns back to him as a frightened child runs to his mother(Purg. XXX.44), only to find him gone forever.

[part0014.html#c23-s21-e] The hypocrites, “dressed” as monks, are infact represented by only two personages, Catalano and Loderingo, both friars(see n. to vv. 104–108). The hypocrisy of the clergy—and especially of themendicant orders—was a medieval commonplace, one most effectively exploited bysuch writers as Boccaccio and Chaucer.While many early commentators believed that the monastery referred to waslocated in Köln (Cologne), in Germany, the predominant modern view is that thisis the great Benedictine monastery in France, at Cluny.

The object of the order was to make peace betweenthe contending factions in the different cities of Italy, and to reconcilefamily feuds, and to protect the weak against their oppressors. The nickname‘Frati Gaudenti’ is supposed to have been bestowed upon the knights on accountof the laxity of their rules, which permitted them to marry and to live in theirown homes, and merely required them to abstain from the use of gold and silvertrappings, from attending at secular banquets, and from encouraging actors;while they bound themselves not to take up arms, save in defence of widows andorphans, and of the Catholic faith, or for the purpose of making peace betweenman and man” (T).

Loderingo was one of the founders of theBolognese order of the Frati Gaudenti, and Catalano was also involved in it.While their allegiances to opposing parties made them seem to be an ideal“couple” to serve as podestà (an office usually taken on by a singlenon-citizen, chosen in the hope of guaranteeing fairness) of a faction-riddledcity, their vows to the pope meant that, once they were chosen to serve inFlorence in 1266, they in fact sided with the forces of the pope (Clement IV)against the Florentine Ghibellines, with the result that the area known as theGardingo, where some of the most powerful Ghibelline families lived (includingFarinata’s Uberti—see Inf.

There is dispute as to whether Dante’s brokenapostrophe of the two friars (or, as some believe, of friars in general) wasgoing to be one of rebuke (e.g., Benvenuto da Imola) or commiseration (e.g.,Francesco da Buti). The context and the similar moment in Inferno XIX.90–117,when Dante upbraids Pope Nicholas III, both would seem to support the harsherreading.

[part0014.html#c23-s37-e] Dante’s attention is drawn by the figurecrucified upon the ground, attached through his hands and his conjoined feet.From Catalano’s description it will become clear that this is Caiaphas, the highpriest who urged the Pharisees “that one man should be martyred for the people”and bears that burden of responsibility for the death of Jesus (see John 11:50).As Chiavacci Leonardi points out (Chia.1991.1, p. 696), Caiaphas masks his ownvicious motives for wanting to give over Jesus as a desire for the public weal(i.e., saving the rest of the Hebrews from Roman repression), thus justifyinghis presence among the hypocrites.

They are cloaked in lead, heis naked (his Christ-centered hypocrisy deserves to be revealed); yet he, too,feels the weight of hypocrisy on his own body when each of the others, in turn,slowly walks over his outstretched form.

[part0014.html#c23-s41-e] Catalano refers to Annas, the father-in-lawof Caiaphas, who presided over the council of the Pharisees (the “others” of thetext) by which Jesus was condemned. It was this action, in Dante’s mind, whichwas punished in the destruction of the second Temple by the forces of the Romanemperor Vespasian, led by his son Titus, in 70 A.D. and in the resultantdiaspora of the Hebrew people. [return to English [part0014.html#c23-s41-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c23-s41-i]]124–126. [part0014.html#c23-s42-e] The high priest, unlike Jesus, is crucifiedupon the ground and trodden upon (thus seeming so “ignoble”). There has beenmuch discussion of the possible reasons for Virgil’s “marveling” over thecrucified shape of Caiaphas. Castelvetro, in error, says that Virgil would haveseen Caiaphas on an earlier visit to the depths; Lombardi gets this right: whenVirgil was sent down by Erichtho, Christ had not yet been crucified and Caiaphasnot yet been damned. Further, and as Margherita Frankel has argued (Fran.1984.1,p. 87), Virgil has already seen Christ and his Cross (Inf. IV.53–54).Nonetheless, and as others have pointed out, Virgil does not marvel at otherswho were not here before his first visit. Rossetti further remarks that nowhereelse in Inferno does Virgil marvel at any other sinner, the text thus conferringa specialness upon this scene. Benvenuto da Imola and Vellutello both offered aninteresting hypothesis, which has since made its way into some moderncommentaries: the verse at line 117, “one man should be martyred for thepeople,” seems to echo a verse from the Aeneid (V.815): “per multis dabiturcaput” (one life shall be given for many). (In that passage Neptune speaks ofthe coming “sacrifice” of Palinurus.) Vellutello sees that “prophecy” as anunwitting Virgilian prophecy of Christ, and suggests that Virgil now wonders athow close he had come. If that seems perhaps a forced reading, a similar effectis gained by the phrase that Dante uses to indicate Caiaphas’s punishment in his“eternal exile” (etterno essilio). That phrase will only be used once again inthe poem, precisely by Virgil himself to indicate his own punishment in Limbo(Purg. XXI.18), as Castelvetro observed. The Anonimo Fiorentino, perhaps betterthan many later commentators, caught the flavor of this passage, which he readsas indicating Virgil’s grief for himself because he had not lived in a time whenhe could have known Christ. In this reader’s view, Virgil wonders at Caiaphasbecause the high priest had actually known Christ in the world and yet turnedagainst Him. Had Virgil had that opportunity, he thinks, his life (andafterlife) would have been very different.

Are they actually fallen angels, or does Virgilmerely speak ironically, employing the figure antiphrasis, indicating devils bytheir opposites? Most of the commentators seem to believe that these really arefallen angels. This may be a questionable interpretation, since Dante seemsclear about the kinds of fallen angels found in hell: neutral (Canto III.37–42)and rebellious (Canto VIII.82–83). If this were the only other place in hell inwhich we found evil creatures referred to as “angels,” it would seem likely thatthe term would be merely a figure of speech on Virgil’s part. However, we alsohave the black Cherub referred to by Guido da Montefeltro (Inf. XXVII.113). Seethe note to that passage.

[part0014.html#c23-s45-e] Virgil’s question to Catalano (andLoderingo) receives this devastating answer: he has been fooled by Malacoda; allthe bridges connecting the fifth and sixth “valleys” are down.

[part0014.html#c23-s48-e] Catalano’s bit of “university wit” is thelast straw for Virgil, pilloried with understated sarcasm for trusting in thewords of devils. Catalano cites Scripture (John 8:44): “Diabolus est mendax etpater eius” (The devil is a liar and the father of lies).

We reflect that it is Dante who hascontrived this whole elaborate scene to the discomfiture of Virgil, but who now,as a character in the poem, follows humbly and caringly in his dear leader’sfootsteps. Hollander (Holl.1984.4), pp. 115–17, has suggested that this lastverse is modelled on the concluding verses of Statius’s Thebaid (XII.816–817):“… nec tu divinam Aeneida tempta, / sed longe sequere et vestigia semper adora”(do not attempt to rival the divine Aeneid, but follow at a distance, alwaysworshiping its footsteps). With this gesture Statius tries to reassure hisreader (and perhaps himself) that he feels no envy toward Virgil’s greatness;Dante’s gesture has a different task to perform, to reassure himself (and hisreader) that, for all that the poet has put Virgil through in these cantos ofbarratry, he nonetheless reveres his great pagan guide. [return to English[part0014.html#c23-s49-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c23-s49-i]]INFERNO XXIV [part0014.html#c24-e]1–21. [part0014.html#c24-s01-e] This elaborate canto-opening simile (see noteto Inf. XXII.1–12) and its aftermath knit the narrative back together: Virgilhad walked away from Catalano (and from Dante) at the end of the last canto;now, getting his anger under control, he turns back to reassure Dante andcontinue his leadership. That is a fair summary of how the simile works as areflection of what is happening between the two characters. However, this simile(like the Aesopic material in Canto XXIII) can be read for more than one set ofequivalences: (1) Virgil’s frown (hoarfrost) melts and he once again encouragesDante (the humble wretch), who eventually will, having completed the journey,feed us (his sheep) with the pages of the poem; (2) the devils’ deception(hoarfrost), in the form of an incorrect presentation of the terrain,discourages Virgil (the wretch), who finally reads the signs right and will leadDante (his sheep) to pasture. A form of this second simultaneous reading wasproposed by Lansing (Lans.1977.1), pp. 77–80.As Frankel has noted (Fran.1984.1), pp. 82–83, the simile itself is divided intotwo rather different stylistic zones; the first six verses are “classicizing”and rather high-flown, while the final nine are in the low style. Hollander(Holl.1984.4) suggests that the first tercet of the “classical” part derivesfrom Virgil’s third Georgic (vv. 303–304), a citation also found in the secondand third redactions of the commentary of Pietro di Dante, and also noted byTommaseo. For other studies in English of this much studied simile seeBake.1974.1, Econ.1976.1, and Lans.1977.1 (pp. 74–80); for Dante’s knowledge ofthe Georgics see Marigo (Mari.1909.1).The reference to Aquarius sets the time within the simile as winter, since thesun is in that constellation from 21 January to 21 February. And so the suncools his “locks” (its rays) in this season. [return to English[part0014.html#c24-s01-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c24-s01-i]]22–24.

[part0014.html#c24-s11-e] The protagonist’s physical difficulty, sinceunlike Virgil he must move his flesh and bones against the pull of gravity, isinsisted on. The interplay between Virgil and Dante, now with roles reversedfrom Cantos XXI–XXIII (when Virgil was the one at a disadvantage) goes on forsome time, through verse 60.

[part0014.html#c24-s13-e] Once again (see Inf. XIX.35 and note) thepoet insists that the far sides, or banks, of each bolgia are not as high as theones encountered first, since the sloping floor of the Malebolge cuts downacross each ditch. [return to English [part0014.html#c24-s13-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c24-s13-i]]49–51. [part0014.html#c24-s17-e] The commentators are almost unanimous intaking Virgil’s words at face value and as sound advice. See, for example,Chiavacci Leonardi (Chia.1991.1), pp. 712–13, who argues for earthly fame’s“double valence” in the poem; she claims that it is sometimes an excusable aim(as here), sometimes a culpable one. Certainly the net effect of Virgil’s appealhere is to get Dante moving upward in order to continue to the top of the ridge,whence he will be able to see into the next ditch as he continues his journey.Yet is it not strange that the motivation offered by Virgil is not the need tostruggle onward toward the presence of God so much as it is the reward ofearthly fame? Rossetti, in his commentary, was perhaps the first to observe theresonance of what has now become a standard citation for these verses, theentirely similar similes found in the book of Wisdom (5:15): “like theinsubstantial foam that is dispersed by the storm, like the smoke that isdissipated by the wind.” In Wisdom the comparisons are to the hopes of theimpious man (as opposed to those of the just, whose thoughts are set on God[5:16]). Narrowly construed, Virgil’s words are those of the impious man wholodges his hopes in the most transitory of things—exactly what the poem willlater establish as the true and fleeting nature of earthly fame (Purg.XI.91–93). If we were to imagine St. Thomas as guide here, we would expect hiswords to have been quite different. Beginning with Gregorio Di Siena,commentators also cite another apposite text for these lines, Aeneid V.740,“tenuis fugit ceu fumus in auras”: it is the vision of Anchises that vanishesfrom Aeneas’s sight “like thin smoke into the air.”Cantos XXI–XXIV thus include Virgil’s most difficult moments as guide to theChristian underworld. The rest of the cantica is mainly without such unsettlingbehavior toward his master and author on the poet’s part. But this will start upagain in a series of moments that are difficult for Virgil in the early cantosof Purgatorio.

[part0014.html#c24-s20-e] In a moment that will strike anyone who is infact a “notably bad climber” with its aptness, the passage insists on Dante’seffort to convince his guide that he is better furnished with breath than infact he is.

[part0014.html#c24-s23-e] These twelve verses have no other point thanto underline the intensity of Dante’s curiosity about the identity of thespeaker whose unintelligible voice he has just heard. It would be unlikely forhim to have left his riddle unanswered. See note to vv. 17–18 of the next canto.Verse 69 has been the cause of much debate. Is the word in the text ire (as inPetrocchi’s edition, meaning “to go”) or ira (wrath)? For a treatment of theproblem see Hollander (Holl.1983.2), offering a listing of the history of thecommentary tradition (pp. 29–31) and concluding that the text originally readira, as almost all the early commentators believed, with the major exception ofPietro di Dante. For a countering view see Stef.1993.1, p. 85.Once again, while not in agreement with it, we have preserved the letter ofPetrocchi’s text in our translation. Berthier, who opts for ira, cites St.Thomas to the effect that one of the five effects of wrath is precisely to causein the furious sinner “clamor irrationabilis” (irrational cries), perhapsexactly what Dante has made out. It also remains difficult to explain how onecan hear, from a distance and in darkness, how a being is “moved” to gettinginto motion, while it is not at all difficult to hear, in precisely thesecircumstances, that a voice is moved by wrath.

[part0014.html#c24-s31-e] The scene, with its principal actors naked,afraid, and trying to hide, evokes, as Hollander has argued (Holl.1983.2), p.34, the description of Adam and Eve hiding from God in the Garden of Eden afterthey have sinned (Gen. 3:9–10): “Vocavitque Dominus Deus Adam, et dixit ei: ‘Ubies?’ Qui ait, ‘Vocem tuam audivi in paradiso et timui, eo quod nudus essem, etabscondi me’ ” (And the Lord God called Adam and asked, “Where are you?” AndAdam said, “I heard your voice in the garden and I grew afraid, because I wasnaked, and I hid myself”). Hollander goes on to examine nine more moments inthis scene that reflect the “primal scene” of thievery in Eden, including theparodic version of the fig leaves with which Adam and Eve covered their loins inGen. 3:7 found here in vv. 95–96. See also Beal.1983.1, pp. 103–5, forresonances of the Edenic scene in this passage.The heliotrope was a stone that supposedly had the power to render its possessorinvisible, as Boccaccio’s Calandrino was urged to believe by his tricksterfriends (Decameron VIII.3).

Since the so-called Ottimo Commento (1333),commentators have agreed that these two letters are written most quickly becausethey are written in a single stroke. But do these two letters signify anything?For instance, are they a code for Dante’s vaunt against Ovid (i.e., “I [io] canportray metamorphosis even better than you”)? Or do they represent the negationof Vanni’s self (i.e., “io” spelled backwards)? For an ingenious argument,extending this second hypothesis, see Darby Chapin (Darb.1971.1), suggesting anOvidian source. She argues that, when Io was transformed into a cow (Metam.I.646–650), medieval commentators represented her new hoofprint as made of thetwo letters of her name, the “I” written inside the “O” so as to represent thecleft in her newly formed hooves ([../images/00010.jpeg]).

[part0014.html#c24-s41-e] Vanni Fucci’s laconic self-identificationtells us that he was an illegitimate son (of the Lazzari family of Pistoia) andinsists upon his bestiality (some early commentators report that his nicknamewas “Vanni the Beast”). He died sometime after 1295, when he apparently leftPistoia, and before 1300—although this is not certain. [return to English[part0014.html#c24-s41-e] / Italian [part0021.html#c24-s41-i]]127–129. [part0014.html#c24-s43-e] Dante’s response indicates that he had onceknown Vanni and thought of him as guilty of sins of violence, not necessarilythose of fraud. [return to English [part0014.html#c24-s43-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c24-s43-i]]132–139. [part0014.html#c24-s44-e] Vanni’s shame and honest self-descriptiongive him a certain moral advantage over many of the dissembling sinners whom wemeet. At the same time his wrathful character extends not only to self-hatred,but to hatred of others, as his ensuing harsh words for Dante will reveal (vv.140–151). His character, so briefly etched, is that of a familiar enough figure,the embittered destroyer of any human bond.The theft of sacred objects from the sacristy of the chapel of St. James inPistoia—which caused an uproar when it occurred, ca. 1293–95—was first not laidto his door and he indeed had left the city before his complicity was revealedby one of his confederates, soon afterwards put to death for his part in thecrime. There is speculation that the eventual truth of Vanni’s involvement wasonly discovered after 1300, yet in time for Dante to present it as “news” herein his poem. [return to English [part0014.html#c24-s44-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c24-s44-i]]140–142. [part0014.html#c24-s47-e] Vanni’s prophecy is the last of these“personal prophecies” found in Inferno. There are nine of these in the Comedy.(See note to Inf. VI.64–66.) He offers it as a form of revenge on Dante forhaving seen him in such distress. [return to English [part0014.html#c24-s47-e] /Italian [part0021.html#c24-s47-i]]143–150. [part0014.html#c24-s48-e] The riddling expression of the language ofprophecy is, at least for a contemporary of Vanni’s and Dante’s, for the mostpart not difficult to unravel. Pistoia’s White Guelphs will drive out the Blackparty in 1301; Florence’s Blacks will do the same in the same year to the Whitesin that city (with one consequence being Dante’s exile). In 1302 the Blacks ofPistoia, allied with Moroello Malaspina (“the headlong bolt”), will have theirrevenge upon the Whites, taking their stronghold at Serravalle. Some understandthat Vanni also (or only) refers to the eventual Black victory over the Whitesin Pistoia itself in 1306.

Vanni’s acerbic ending, personalizing theprophecy as a way of making Dante grieve, is his tit-for-tat response for thegrief that Dante has caused him by seeing him. He may be damned for thievery,but his party will be victorious, while Dante’s will be roundly defeated.[return to English [part0014.html#c24-s50-e] / Italian[part0021.html#c24-s50-i]]INFERNO XXV [part0014.html#c25-e]1–3. [part0014.html#c25-s01-e] Emphasizing the close relationship between thetwo cantos, this one begins in absolute continuation of the action of the last,as though there were no formal divide between them.Vanni’s obscene gesture to God is variously understood. Francesco da Buti, inhis gloss, says that the gesture is made by extending two fingers on each hand(apparently the same gesture as giving the sign of the horns, for cuckoldry, butthe commentator does not say so), and in this case, four fingers in all, thusaccounting for the verb squadrare (“to square”), with its resonance of fourness.Beginning with Pompeo Venturi in the 1730s, most commentators say that thegesture is made by placing the thumb between the index and middle fingers.Ignazio Baldelli, however, has recently argued that the gesture involves makingthe image of the female pudenda with thumb and index finger (Bald.1997.1).Whatever the precise gesture Vanni made, it was not a polite one.

[part0014.html#c25-s02-e] The serpents, according to Guido da Pisa, becomeDante’s “friends” because they undo the reason for the curse laid on the serpentin the Garden (Gen. 3:15); these serpents are doing something praiseworthydespite their unappealing ancestry.

[part0014.html#c25-s04-e] The poet apostrophizes Pistoia as he nearsthe end of the section of these cantos devoted to Vanni Fucci. The next thieveswhom we will see will all be Florentines. [return to English[part0014.html#c25-s04-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c25-s04-i]]13–15. [part0014.html#c25-s05-e] Vanni’s pride is unfavorably compared even tothat displayed by Capaneus (Inf. XIV.49–60). We are reminded once more thatsins, in any given sinner (living or dead) are often several; Capaneus, ablasphemer, and Vanni Fucci, a thief, are both portrayed as being motivated bypride against God. [return to English [part0014.html#c25-s05-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c25-s05-i]]17–18. [part0014.html#c25-s06-e] It is here, at last, that we find the answerto the question the text left us with in the last canto—or so Hollander(Holl.1983.2), pp. 36–37, has claimed. Verses 65–78 of the previous canto hadDante eager to discover the identity of the speaker of those unformed words andVirgil getting him closer to their source so that he could have his answer. Thedescent, however, allows him to see still other (very distracting) things: theserpents and then Vanni Fucci. The moment Vanni disappears we finally hear thatvoice and have our question answered. All commentators who have dealt with theissue have argued either that the voice was Vanni’s or that its identity wasintentionally and totally masked by the author. It seems, on the other hand,that the voice is that of Cacus, the thieving centaur, who will be named at v.25. What do we discover? He is angry (“pien di rabbia”), as was that voice (adira mosso, and not ad ire mosso); he cries out in perverse imitation of God’svoice in the Garden in the Bible (Gen. 3:9) asking hiding Adam, “Where are you?”(See note to Inf. XXIV.91–96.) Cacus is in pursuit of Vanni Fucci, “unripe”(acerbo) because of his sin. Later in the poem Satan is also portrayed as havingfallen from heaven “unripe” (acerbo) in his sinfulness (Par. XIX.48), whileAdam, beginning his life innocent, without sin, is referred to as having beencreated by God “ripe” (maturo) in the Garden (Par. XXVI.91). Thus, in this“replay” of the primal scene of theft in the Garden, Vanni takes on the role ofAdam after the Fall, having moved from ripeness to unripeness, hiding from hisjust maker, while Cacus plays the unlikely role of the vengeful God in pursuitof his fallen child. [return to English [part0014.html#c25-s06-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c25-s06-i]]19–33. [part0014.html#c25-s07-e] Cacus was strictly speaking not a centaur,but the tradition that he was one extends at least until the prologue ofCervantes’ Don Quixote. Virgil does refer to him as “semihominis Caci”(half-human Cacus) at Aeneid VIII.194, but his context is clear: Cacus is theson of Vulcan, not of Ixion, father of the Centaurs. And so Dante’s decision tomake him a centaur, a “brother” of the keepers of the first ring of violence inInferno XII, is either completely his own or reflects a tradition about which weknow nothing. (See G. Padoan, “Caco,” ED, vol. 1, 1970, pp. 741–42.) On theother hand, many details of this passage clearly reflect those found in thelengthy passage describing Hercules’ killing of Cacus for his theft of cattle inVirgil’s poem (VIII.184–275), dragging them into his cave backwards so thattheir hoofprints would lead away from the guilty party’s lair. It seems clearthat Dante here had Virgil’s poem in mind as his prime source and that heknowingly distorts Virgilian text: in Virgil, Cacus is not a centaur; in Virgilhis mouth gives forth smoke and fire (vv. 198–199; 252–255; 259) while in Dantehe has a dragon on his back to do that for him; in Virgil, Hercules stranglesCacus (vv. 260–261) while in Dante he clubs him over the head (see Holl.1983.2,pp. 40–41). We have seen such willful rearrangement of Virgilian materialbefore, notably in Inferno XX, and will see it again (see Inf. XXXI.103–105),when the unseen Briareus will be described in very un-Virgilian terms (see noteto Inf. XXXI.97–105). As Beal points out (Beal.1983.1), pp. 108–10, Cacus wasoften seen as related to Satan, since Hercules was frequently understood torepresent Christ.The Maremma is a boggy region of Tuscany, the Aventine one of the seven hills ofRome.

[part0014.html#c25-s12-e] The frenetic action described in this cantois so amply described that less than 15 percent of its verses are spoken by itscharacters, the lowest figure for any canto in the Inferno.The three sinners will turn out to be Agnello (named at v. 68), Buoso (v. 140),Puccio (v. 148); Cianfa literally joins Agnello (named at v. 43); Francesco willbe added, referred to indirectly (v. 151).

[part0014.html#c25-s15-e] The first of the five Florentines referred to inthe canto, Cianfa, according to early commentators, was a member of the Donatifamily; he apparently died in 1289. [return to English [part0014.html#c25-s15-e]/ Italian [part0022.html#c25-s15-i]]44–45. [part0014.html#c25-s15-e] Dante’s digital gesture hushes Virgil.

[part0014.html#c25-s22-e] The third of these three rapid comparisonshas caused difficulty: does the poet refer to a flame moving across a piece ofparchment, turning the nearer material brown before it blackens? or to the wickof a candle, which similarly turns brown before turning black? The strongestcase for the former is that, in the case of the candlewick, the brown colormoves down the wick, while Dante says the brown moves suso (“up,” “along”). SeeChia.1991.1, p. 746.

[return to English [part0014.html#c25-s23-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c25-s23-i]]69–72. [part0014.html#c25-s23-e] For the “mating” of the two thieves,twentieth-century commentators, beginning perhaps with Grandgent, point to theconjunction in a single bisexual body of Ovid’s nymph Salmacis andHermaphroditus (Metam.

[part0014.html#c25-s28-e] A new figure (Francesco) assaults one of theremaining two (Agnello and Cianfa have moved off), known as Buoso, as we shalllearn near the canto’s end. [return to English [part0014.html#c25-s28-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c25-s28-i]]94–102. [part0014.html#c25-s32-e] The three rhetorically balanced tercetsperform a task slightly different from the one they are traditionally accorded,i.e., the modern poet’s victorious boast over his creaky classical forebears.But that is what the first two both seem to do: let Lucan be silent with hishorrible tales of soldiers slain by serpents in the Libyan desert in Book IX ofthe Pharsalia; let Ovid be silent with his tales of Cadmus, transmogrified intoa serpent (Metam. IV.563–603), and of Arethusa, transformed into a spring(Metam. V.572–641). The third puts forward the modern poet’s superiority: Buosoand Francesco do not sustain individual transformations, but exchange their verynatures, one becoming the other. Is the radical difference between Lucan/Ovidand Dante the poetic novelty of the latter, as would seem to be the case? Or isit rather the result of this poet’s not inventing his marvels, but merelydescribing them? We all realize that the first explanation is in fact correct,Dante does (and means to) outdo his classical precursors. But then we mayreflect that his claim is that he is not making this up, but merely observing“reality,” God’s vengeance on the floor of the seventh bolgia. Let fictive poetsyield to this new Christian teller of truths revealed, the humble scribe of God.We do not have to believe this claim, but we can sense that it is being lodged.[return to English [part0014.html#c25-s32-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c25-s32-i]]103–138. [part0014.html#c25-s35-e] This, the most fully described of thevarious metamorphoses found in these two cantos, is broken by Castelvetro intoseven stages of mutual transformation, Francesco into a man and Buoso into aserpent. The former becomes a man as follows: (1) his tail becomes legs, (2) hisfront paws become arms, (3) his rear legs become a penis, (4) his hide becomesskin, (5) his posture changes from prone to erect, (6) his snout becomes a face,(7) his serpentine hiss becomes a voice. Buoso, naturally, goes through exactlythe obverse process. [return to English [part0014.html#c25-s35-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c25-s35-i]]139–141. [part0014.html#c25-s47-e] Francesco, not identified until the lastverse of the canto, turns momentarily away from Buoso, having regained his powerof speech, only to use it to express his desire to punish him, addressing Puccio(see v. 148). As for Buoso, his identity is much debated. Michele Barbi(Barb.1934.1), pp. 305–22, suggests that he is probably Buoso di Forese Donati(died ca. 1285).

[part0014.html#c25-s48-e] Campi points to Landino’s and Vellutello’sunderstanding of this Florentine verb, abborracciare, as meaning to makesomething of a botch of things as a result of working too quickly. Thus Dante’sworries that his pen, following these never-before-observed and rapidtransformations, may have blotted his page a bit when he attempted to set themdown.

[part0014.html#c26-s01-e] Matching the ironic apostrophe of Pistoia thatfollows the departure of Vanni Fucci in the last canto, vv. 10–12, this one ofFlorence comes in the wake of the poem’s departure from the five Florentinethieves. The image of Florence as winged has caused some puzzlement. Whilecommentators, beginning perhaps with Scartazzini/Vandelli, point out thatDante’s words most probably echo the Latin inscription, dating to 1255, on thefaçade of the Florentine Palazzo del Podestà, proclaiming that Florence is inpossession of the sea, the land, indeed the entire world, we are still left tospeculate on Dante’s reasons for presenting her as winged. Whatever his reason,we might want to reflect that he thought of himself as the “wingèd one” becauseof the easy pun available from his surname, Alighieri, in Latin “aliger”(wingèd). See Shan.1975.1 and Shan.1977.1. In this canto the apostrophized cityand the seafaring Ulysses are both associated with “wings” (“in our mad flightwe turned our oars to wings” [v. 125]); at least intrinsically, the protagonistis also. He is on a better-purposed “flight.” For these motifs and anotherrelated one see Corti (Cort.1990.1). [return to English[part0014.html#c26-s01-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c26-s01-i]]7. [part0014.html#c26-s03-e] The text alludes to the classical and medievalbelief that morning dreams were more truthful in their content than any others.Guido da Pisa is the first (but hardly the last) to refer to a text in Ovid tothis effect (Heroides XIX.195–196). On the subject see Speroni’s article(Sper.1948.1). And see, for the same view of morning dreams, PurgatorioIX.16–18.

[part0014.html#c26-s03-e] The passage about Prato has caused twointerpretive problems: (1) Does it refer to the anger felt by Cardinal Niccolòda Prato when he failed to bring peace between the warring Florentine factionsin 1304, or to the rebellion of the town of Prato in 1309, when Florence’s smallneighbor cast out its Black Guelphs? (2) Is Dante heartened or heartsick as hecontemplates this “future” event?It was only in the eighteenth century that a commentator suggested a referenceto the cardinal (Venturi). Further, since the second event was probably roughlycontemporaneous to the writing of this canto, it seems likely that Dante wouldhave enjoyed having so recent a piece of news as confirmation of his “prophecy.”As to his emotions, it seems more reasonable to reflect that Dante is admittingthat he will only be happy once the power of the Black Guelphs of Florence isdestroyed; he is in pain as he awaits that liberation. In other words, this isnot an expression of sadness for the city’s coming tribulation, but a desire tosee them come to pass—and that is the common view of the early commentators.[return to English [part0014.html#c26-s03-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c26-s03-i]]14. [part0014.html#c26-s05-e] While we do not believe that Dante says herewhat Petrocchi says he does, we have, as always, followed his text, which readsiborni (pallid, the color and coolness of ivory) and not, as the text hadpreviously stood, i borni (the outcroppings of the rocks). In our opinion the“old” reading is the superior one. Instead of “on those stairs that turned uspale when we came down” we would say “on the stairs the jutting rocks had madefor our descent.” [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s05-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c26-s05-i]]19–24. [part0014.html#c26-s07-e] According to Pertile (Pert.1979.1), those whopropose a negative view of Ulysses fail to acknowledge the importance of theseverses, which reveal the poet’s sympathy for the Greek hero even now as hewrites of him. He cites (p. 37) Ovid (Metam. XIII.135–139) in support of hisargument. However, that text offers Ulysses’ vaunt of his own worthiness toreceive the arms of Achilles (denying the claims of Ajax), and the entirepassage gives us the portrait of a figure full of pride and self-love. SeeHollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 115–16, arguing that Dante, in this passage, isfully conscious of his previous “Ulyssean” efforts, undertaken by hisventuresome and prideful intellect, and now hopes to keep them under control.Castelvetro’s reading of the passage is in this vein; according to him the poetgrieves “for having improperly put to use my genius.” Dante hopes, in otherwords, to be exactly unlike Ulysses.

[part0014.html#c26-s09-e] The first of two elaborate similes inprologue to the appearance of Ulysses deals with the number of false counselors:they are as numerous as fireflies. Dante, as peasant (il villano) resting on hishillside (poggio—Frankel [Fran.1986.1, pp. 102–5], contrasts his “humble”hillock with Ulysses’ “prideful” mountain [v. 133]), looks out upon this valleyfull of fireflies. This peaceful scene lulls many readers into a sort of moralexemption for Ulysses; if he looks so pleasant, how can he be seen as sinful? Infact, the distancing effect of the simile makes Ulysses seem small andrelatively insignificant. We can imagine how he might feel, told that he hadbeen compared to a firefly.Many readers are rightly reminded of the previous simile involving a rustic (lovillanello) at Inferno XXIV.7–15.

[part0014.html#c26-s11-e] For the flames as reminiscent of the Epistle ofJames (3:4–6) see Bates and Rendall (Bate.1989.1) and Cornish (Corn.1989.1):“Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven by fiercewinds, yet are turned about with a very small helm, wherever the steersmanpleases. Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasts many things. Beholdhow great a matter a little fire kindles! And the tongue is a fire, a world ofiniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body,and sets on fire the course of nature, and it is set on fire of hell.” Pietro diDante was the first to cite this passage in connection with Dante’s descriptionof the flames here.

[part0014.html#c26-s12-e] The second Ulyssean simile describes theflame-wrapped appearance of Ulysses in terms of Elijah’s fiery ascent to heaven.Perhaps the first extended discussion of the biblical text behind the passagewas offered by Frankel (Fran. 1986.1), pp. 110–16, who argues that, while Elijahis seen as antithetical to Ulysses (see Cass.1984.1, pp. 88–93), Dante is alsoseen as related to the negative aspect of Elisha (his pride in taking on theprophet’s mantle)—see II Kings 2:9–12. She is answered by Ferretti Cuomo (Ferr.1995.1), who sees Elisha as only a positive figure of Dante, similarly acceptinghis role as successor prophet. For the same view see Hollander (Holl. 1969.1),p. 117.Elisha was avenged by the bears in that the forty-two children who mocked hisprophetic calling, addressing him as “Baldy” (calve), were attacked andlacerated by two bears (II Kings 2:23–24).

[part0014.html#c26-s15-e] The protagonist’s excitement at the prospectof seeing Ulysses is evident (Ulysses has not been identified yet, but the poetseems to be taking a liberty in allowing his character to fathom who is about toappear). In his reckless abandon to gain experience of this great sinner, heresembles Ulysses himself. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s15-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c26-s15-i]]48. [part0014.html#c26-s16-e] Virgil’s point seems to be that each of theflame-enclosed sinners is covered by the external sign of their inner ardor,their longing to captivate the minds of those upon whom they practiced theirfraudulent work.

[part0014.html#c26-s18-e] Almost all commentators point to the passagein Statius’s Thebaid (XII. 429–432) that describes the immolation of the corpsesof the two warring brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, whose enmity was the rootof the civil war in Thebes and is manifest now even in their death, as the smokefrom their burning bodies will not join. Among the early commentators onlyPietro di Dante noticed that the same scene is reported in similar ways in Lucanas well (Phars. I.551–552).

[part0014.html#c26-s19-e] Ulysses and Diomedes are clearly indicated assuffering the punishment of God for their fraudulent acts; yet this indictmenthas not kept readers from admiring them—or at least Ulysses. Perhaps the centralproblem in the large debate that has surrounded Dante’s version of the Greekhero in the last century-and-a-half is how sympathetically we are meant torespond to him. To put that another way, what is the nature of Ulysses’ sin, andhow urgently is it meant to govern the reader’s sense of his worth? And afurther complication is of more recent vintage: what should we make of the atleast apparent similarity between Ulysses and Dante himself? Chiavacci Leonardihas made a useful distinction between the two essential attitudes thatdistinguish divergent readings of the undoubtedly heroic figure (Chia.1991.1, p.762): (1) Ulysses is marked by greatness; he is unfortunate but guiltless; (2)he is characterized by the sin of pride, like Adam. For an example of the firstview see Francesco De Sanctis in 1870: Dante “erects a statue to this precursorof Christopher Columbus, a pyramid set in the mud of hell” (DeSa.1949.1), pp.201–2. For similar views see Croce (Croc.1921.1), p. 98, and Fubini(Fubi.1966.1). Attilio Momigliano, in his comment to vv. 64–69, throws allcaution to the wind. He complains that the first sixty-three verses of the cantoare too dry and erudite. Now that Ulysses is on the scene, we breathe the air oftrue and enthusiastic poetry. “Appearances notwithstanding,” he says, “Dante notonly does not condemn the fraudulent acts of Ulysses and Diomedes, he exaltsthem.” The negative view in modern discussions was enunciated clearly by BrunoNardi (Nard.1942.1). See also Wilhelm (Wilh.1960.1); Padoan (Pado.1977.1);Hollander (Holl.1969.1), pp. 114–23; Scott (Scot.1971.1); Iannucci(Iann.1976.1). Recently a third “school” has opened its doors, one that findsUlysses less than totally admirable and yet associated with Dante, who presentshimself, just beneath the lines of his text, as a trespassing voyager himself.See Mazzotta (Mazz.1975.1), p. 41; Stierle (Stie.1988.1); Barolini(Baro.1992.1), passim; Bloom (Bloo.1994.1), pp. 85–89. For a rejoinder to theposition of these critics see Stull and Hollander (Stul.1991.1 [1997]), pp.43–52. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s19-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c26-s19-i]]58–63. [part0014.html#c26-s20-e] Virgil lists the sins of the two heroes: thestratagem of the troop-hiding Trojan horse (with which Ulysses, if not Diomedes,is associated in Virgil, Aen. II); Ulysses’ trickery in getting Achilles to jointhe war against Troy, thus abandoning, on the isle of Scyros, his belovedDeidamia (as recounted in Statius’s unfinished Achilleid), who subsequently diedof grief at the news of his death in Troy; the joint adventure in which theystole the Palladium, image of Athena, a large wooden statue, in return for whichthe horse served as a fraudulent peace-offering (Aen. II.163–169). Those who,like Momigliano, believe that the fraudulent acts of Ulysses and Diomedes areexalted by Dante, should be reminded that Virgil, in the Aeneid, is pretty hardon them. Diomedes, for his part in the theft of the Palladium, is impious(impius—Aen. II.163) while Ulysses is called an “inventor of crimes”(scelerum … inventor—Aen. II.164). It seems more than likely that Dante wouldhave shared Virgil’s views of these matters. For the recovery of the notion,widespread in the ancient commentators, that Ulysses is best described as“astutus” (in the sense of possessing low cunning) see Kay.1980.1; Aher.1982.1.Sources for Dante’s Ulysses are found nearly everywhere, so much so that one hasa feeling that more are called than should be chosen: Virgil (Loga.1964.1;Pado.1977.1; Thom.1967.1, pp. 44–46; Thom.1974.1, pp. 52–61); Ovid(Pico.1991.2); Persius (Chie.1998.1); Statius’s Achilleid (Pado.1977.1, pp.173–76; Hage.1997.1); Lucan (Stul.1991.1); Tacitus (VonR.1986.2); the Alexandercycle (Aval.1966.1; VonR.1986.1); as built on negative correspondences withMoses (Porc.1997.1, pp. 20–25). There are of course many more. For three Latinpassages (from Cicero, Horace, and Seneca) that may have helped shape Dante’sconception of Ulysses see Singleton’s comment to vv. 90–120.For the vast bibliography of work devoted to Dante’s Ulysses see Cass.1981.1 andSeri.1994.1, pp. 155–91. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s20-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c26-s20-i]]64–69. [part0014.html#c26-s22-e] Now that Dante knows that the flame containsUlysses, his ardor to hear him speak is nearly overwhelming. [return to English[part0014.html#c26-s22-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c26-s22-i]]70–75. [part0014.html#c26-s24-e] See Donno (Donn.1973.1) for the notion thathere Virgil actually speaks Greek (if not assuming the role of Homer, as somehave argued) because of a fable, which Dante might have known, that had it thatDiomedes, forced back into wandering when his homecoming is ruined by news ofhis wife’s infidelity, went off to Daunia (Apulia?) and eventually diedthereabouts. Some of the birds that dwelled there became known as “Diomedianbirds.” Their main trait was to be hostile to all barbarians and friendly to allGreeks (pp. 30–31). On the basis of this fable, Donno argues, Virgil chooses toaddress Diomedes and Ulysses in Greek. The argument may be forced, but it isinteresting. The passage is puzzling and its difficulty is compounded by what isfound at Inferno XXVII.20, when Guido da Montefeltro says that he has heardVirgil speaking Lombard dialect to Ulysses. [return to English[part0014.html#c26-s24-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c26-s24-i]]79–84. [part0014.html#c26-s27-e] Virgil identifies himself as Ulysses’ (andDiomedes’) “author.” Now this is strictly true, since both of them appear (ifrather unfavorably) in the Aeneid. Nonetheless, one can understand why somecommentators have imagined that Virgil is pretending to be Homer as he addressesUlysses and Diomedes. However, that he refers to his work as li alti versi (“mylofty verses”) probably connects with his earlier description of his Aeneid,“l’alta mia tragedìa” (my lofty tragedy), at Inferno XX.113. It seems mostsensible to believe that Virgil is speaking whatever language he usually speaks.[return to English [part0014.html#c26-s27-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c26-s27-i]]90–93. [part0014.html#c26-s30-e] Ulysses’ speech begins, like classical epic,in medias res (in the midst of the action, i.e., not at its beginning). Dantewould seem to be portraying him as the author of his own self-celebrating song,a “mini-epic,” as it were. He makes it sound as though staying with Circe, theenchantress, were less culpable than it probably was, in Dante’s eyes. His nextgesture is to boast that he had come to Gaeta before Aeneas did, which cityAeneas names after his dead nurse, who died and was buried there (Aen. VII.2).Thus does Ulysses put himself forward as a rivalrous competitor of Virgil’shero. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s30-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c26-s30-i]]94–99. [part0014.html#c26-s32-e] Ulysses’ aim, to discover the truth about theworld and about mankind, sounds acceptable or even heroic to many contemporaryreaders. When we examine the prologue to this thought, in which he denies hisfamily feeling for Telemachus, Laertes, and Penelope in order to make hisvoyage, we may begin to see the inverted parallelism to the hero whom he wouldemulate and best, Aeneas, loyal to Ascanius, Anchises, and Creusa. If Ulysses isventuresome, Aeneas is, as Virgil hardly tires of calling him, pius, a “familyman” if ever there was one. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s32-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c26-s32-i]]100–111. [part0014.html#c26-s34-e] He and his crew of aging, tired sailorshead out across the Mediterranean from Italy and reach the gates of Hercules,the very sign, even as Ulysses reports it, of the end of the known world. WhileDante does not refer to it (nor to the previous voyages of Marco Polo), a numberof recent commentators speculate that he was aware of the voyage of the Vivaldibrothers in 1291. They, in search of India, sailed out through the Strait ofGibraltar, having passed Spain and Africa, and were never heard from again.[return to English [part0014.html#c26-s34-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c26-s34-i]]112–113. [part0014.html#c26-s38-e] It is a commonplace in the commentaries tobelieve that the opening words of Ulysses’ speech to his men reflect the firstwords of Aeneas to his men (Aen. I.198). Several, however, also refer to thesimilar passage in Lucan (Phars. I.299), but without making any further case forLucan’s greater appositeness here. Stull and Hollander (Stul.1991.1), pp. 8–12,argue that Caesar’s infamous words to his men, urging them to march on Rome, arecited far more precisely: the phrase “che per cento milia / perigli” (through ahundred thousand perils) mirrors nearly exactly Lucan’s “qui mille pericula”(through a thousand perils) except for the added touch that Ulysses is even moregrandiloquent than Lucan’s florid Julius. The result seems fairly devastating toall those who argue for a positive valence for Dante’s Ulysses, which is closeto impossible to assert if the essential model for the hero is Julius Caesar,portrayed in Lucan as the worst of rabble-rousing, self-admiring leaders, hereat the moment that begins the civil war that will destroy the republic. ForLucan, and for Dante, this is one of the most terrible moments in Roman history.Stull and Hollander explore a series of resonances of Lucan’s text in thiscanto. [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s38-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c26-s38-i]]118–120. [part0014.html#c26-s40-e] Ulysses’ final flourish not only won overhis flagging shipmates, it has become a rallying cry of Romantic readers of thisscene, from Tennyson to Primo Levi. What can be wrong with such desires, sofully human? Alessandra Colangeli, a student at the University of Rome,suggested, after she heard a lecture on this canto on 10 March 1997, thatUlysses’ words seemed to echo those of the serpent in the Garden to Adam andEve, promising that, if they were to eat the forbidden fruit, they would becomelike gods, knowing good and evil (Gen. 3:5). For a similar if more general viewof Ulysses as the tempter see Cassell (Cass.1984.1), p. 86. Since Adam’s laterwords to Dante (Par. XXVI.115–117) rehearse both the scene in the Garden andUlysses’ transgression, the eating from the tree and the trespass of anestablished limit, the association has some grounding in Dante’s text. Baldelli(Bald.1998.1) is the latest to argue that the speech is the locus of Ulysses’fraudulent counsel, since he, anticipating the reckless adventure of the Vivaldibrothers, urges his men to go beyond the known limits in search of experience.Gustavo Vinay (Vina.1960.1), pp. 5–6, points out that these verses echo theopening of the Convivio (“All men naturally desire knowledge”). His insightgives support to those who have argued that Ulysses is staged as a precursor, asit were, of the venturesome younger Dante, in whose more mature view a number ofpositions put forward in Convivio have become something of an embarrassment. Forsuch opinions see, among others, Valli (Vall.1935.1), Hollander (Holl.1969.1),pp. 114–18, and Holl.1975.1; Freccero (Frec.1986.1 [1973]), pp. 188–90;Gagliardi (Gagl.1994.1), pp. 330–32, resuscitating Valli’s views (his titlederives from Valli’s).

Once he has uttered his words, hisexhausted companions are ready for anything. We now perhaps notice that one ofhis key words is “little,” one mark of a speaker who masks his pride in falsehumility: his reduced company of shipmates is picciola (v. 102); so is the timeleft his men on earth (picciola, v. 114); and now his oration is also but alittle thing (v. 122), picciola used one more time, a total of three times intwenty-one verses. Ulysses is, in modern parlance, a con artist, and a good one,too. He has surely fooled a lot of people. [return to English[part0014.html#c26-s41-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c26-s41-i]]124–126. [part0014.html#c26-s42-e] His men, his “brothers,” now show theirreal relationship to Ulysses: it is an instrumental one. They are his oars. AsCarroll suggests in his commentary, “Is it not possible that this wild adventureis narrated as the last piece of evil counsel of which Ulysses was guilty?”[return to English [part0014.html#c26-s42-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c26-s42-i]]127–135. [part0014.html#c26-s43-e] The five-month voyage, the ship’s stern tothe east (the site of sunrise, perhaps the most familiar medieval image forChrist), occupies three tercets. Ulysses, abetted by his rowers, has stormedOlympus. They are the first mortals to see the mount that became purgatory sinceAdam and Eve left it. God’s punishment does not wait long to overcome them.[return to English [part0014.html#c26-s43-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c26-s43-i]]136. [part0014.html#c26-s46-e] For a possible source of this verse in theBible (John 16:20), see Chiappelli (Chia.1989.1), p. 123: “You shall weep andlament, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrowshall be changed to joy.” For another, perhaps more apt, see Durling(Durl.1996.1), p. 414, citing James 4:9: “Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: letyour laughter be turned to mourning, your joy to heaviness.” [return to English[part0014.html#c26-s46-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c26-s46-i]]137–138.

[part0014.html#c26-s47-e] The final image of Ulysses’ narrative isbased, as a commentator as early in the tradition as Guido da Pisa realized, onAeneid I.116–117, where Virgil describes the only ship in Aeneas’s flotilla tobe destroyed in the storm at sea: “… but a wave whirls the ship, driving itthree times around in the same place, and then a sudden eddy swallows it up inthe sea.” The echo is probably not without consequence for our view of thewould-be hero Ulysses: “The ship in point is that which carried the Lycians andfaithful Orontes and which goes down within sight of the land that would havesaved its sailors, as does Ulysses’ ship. It is a ship of the damned. Aeneas, inhis piety, is the hero; Ulysses, in his heroicness, is the failure”(Holl.1969.1, p. 121). [return to English [part0014.html#c26-s47-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c26-s47-i]]142. [part0014.html#c26-s47-e] The final verse of the canto seems also to havea classical antecedent (one not previously noted), the final verses of theseventh book of Statius’s Thebaid. There, the seer Amphiaraus, the first of the“seven against Thebes” to die in that civil war, plunges into a chasm in theearth only to have the land then close back in above him (Theb. VII.821–823):“and as he sank he looked back at the heavens and groaned to see the plain meetabove him, until a fainter shock joined once more the parted fields and shut outthe daylight from Avernus” (trans. Mozley). Dante has referred to Amphiaraus’sdescent into hell at Inferno XX.31–36. If he is thinking of it here, it wouldcall to mind still another pagan hero who may serve as a model for Ulysses’ rashvoyage and entombment.

[part0015.html#c27-s01-e] This innocent detail—Virgil’s dismissal ofUlysses—will resurface at v. 21 with the addition of rather striking informationabout the language of Virgil’s last words to Ulysses, uttered but not recordedhere. [return to English [part0015.html#c27-s01-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c27-s01-i]]4–6. [part0015.html#c27-s02-e] The next flame-enclosed shade, who will turn outto be a modern-day Ulysses, Guido da Montefeltro, was well known enough that henever has to be identified in more than indirect ways (vv. 67–78). Born ca.1220, Guido was one of the great Ghibelline captains of the last third of thethirteenth century, winning a number of important victories for the nonethelesseventually unsuccessful Ghibelline cause. He was reconciled to the Church in1286, but then took up his soldiering against the Guelphs once again, finallydesisting only in 1294. In 1296 he joined the Franciscan order (v. 67). However,in the following year Pope Boniface VIII cajoled him into reentering the worldof military affairs, this time working against the Ghibellines (the Colonnafamily, which held the fortress of Palestrina, Roman Praeneste, as detailed inthe text [vv. 85–111]). Guido died in 1298 in the Franciscan monastery atAssisi.While other pairs of preceding cantos contain those who had committed the samesin (VII–VIII [the wrathful]; X–XI [heretics]; XV–XVI [sodomites]; XXIV–XXV[thieves]), only XXVI and XXVII treat two major figures guilty of the same sin,perhaps suggesting how closely Guido and Ulysses are related in Dante’simagination. [return to English [part0015.html#c27-s02-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c27-s02-i]]7–15. [part0015.html#c27-s03-e] This simile is derived either from varioushistories (Pietro di Dante mentions Orosius and Valerius Maximus) or from Ovid,Ars amatoria I.653–656. The ancient tyrant of Agrigento (in Sicily), Phalaris,had the Athenian Perillus construct for him a brazen bull in which he couldroast his victims alive. Their screams were transformed into what resembled thebellowings of a bull. Once the instrument of torture was finished, Phalarisordered that Perillus be its first victim, thus testing his handicraft. Itworked. Ovid’s moral to the story (Ars I.655–656) seems to be echoed in Dante’sverse 8: “there is no law more just than that the craftsman of death should dieby his own handicraft.” [return to English [part0015.html#c27-s03-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c27-s03-i]]16–18. [part0015.html#c27-s06-e] These verses make clear for the first time howthe mechanics of speech of the fraudulent counselors work; their words areformed by their tongues, within their fires, and then produced by the tips oftheir flames. When Guido first appeared (v. 6) he was apparently only mumblingabout his pain within his flame. [return to English [part0015.html#c27-s06-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c27-s06-i]]19–21. [part0015.html#c27-s07-e] Guido’s address to Virgil not only insiststhat the Roman poet was speaking his (native—see Inf. I.68) Lombard, i.e., northItalian, dialect, but then offers in evidence his exact words. What are we tounderstand about the language in which Virgil first addressed Ulysses (Inf.XXVI.72–75)? Was it the same as this? Or is this, as seems more likely, thecolloquial manner in which he sends him away? The entire problem has vexed manya commentator, and no simple resolution has as yet emerged. [return to English[part0015.html#c27-s07-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c27-s07-i]]25–27. [part0015.html#c27-s09-e] Perhaps because he cannot see clearly fromwithin his flame, Guido cannot tell whether Virgil (or Dante, for that matter)is a living soul or a dead fellow-sinner, just now come down from Italy to spendeternity here. The reason for Dante’s insistence on this detail will be madeplain when Guido reveals himself only because he does not believe that Dantewill ever resurface to tell his miserable story. [return to English[part0015.html#c27-s09-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c27-s09-i]]28. [part0015.html#c27-s10-e] When Guido died (1298), the peace in Romagna hadnot yet been confirmed, as it was the following year. The region of Romagna issituated in the eastern north-central part of Italy. [return to English[part0015.html#c27-s10-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c27-s10-i]]33. [part0015.html#c27-s11-e] Not only is Guido an Italian (latino), he is thatItalian whom Dante had designated as most noble (lo nobilissimo nostro latino)in Convivio IV.xxviii.8. Commentators have been concerned about this apparentcontradiction (for an attempt to mitigate it see Pertile [Pert.1982.1], pp.171–75). If, however, Dante had changed his mind about a number of his positionsin Convivio, as others believe, there is no reason to find the contradictionanything less than intentional. Further, he may not have known of Guido’sinvolvement with Boniface when he wrote the passage praising him in Convivio.See note to vv. 106–111.Virgil’s passing the questioning of Guido (a modern) over to Dante reminds us ofhis insisting on it for Ulysses (an ancient) in the previous canto. [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c27-s11-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c27-s11-i]]37–39. [part0015.html#c27-s13-e] Dante’s reference to Romagna answers Guido’sfirst question: there is peace—of a sort—there now.

Dante now enlightens Guido (and only an expertin the political and geographical lore of the region would understand hiselliptical speech) about the condition of eight cities and fortified towns ofRomagna, governed by various tyrants: Ravenna, Cervia, Forlì, Verrucchio,Rimini, Faenza, Imola, and Cesena.

Eliot as the epigraph to The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,makes it clear that, for him, report among the living would bring infamy, notfame. Since he believes that Dante is a damned soul, and thus unable to regainthe world of the living, he will speak. [return to English[part0015.html#c27-s21-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c27-s21-i]]67. [part0015.html#c27-s23-e] Guido sums up his life in a single line: he wentfrom bad to good. In fact, he went from bad to good to bad again. Dante may havereflected that his own life was exactly the opposite in its movements, from goodto bad, but then from bad to good. Guido did not have a Beatrice to lead himback to the true path, only a Boniface. [return to English[part0015.html#c27-s23-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c27-s23-i]]70–72. [part0015.html#c27-s24-e] Boniface VIII, according to Guido, led himfrom his life of religious retreat back into political machinations. LikeFrancesca da Rimini, Guido da Montefeltro blames his fall upon another; likeher, he will tell Dante the reasons for it. See Inf. V.119, where Dante asksFrancesca to tell “a che e come” (how and by what signs) she came into Love’spower; Guido will tell Dante “e come e quare” (Latin “why,” more precisely “inwhat respect” [how and why]) the reasons for his fall into perdition.

[part0015.html#c27-s25-e] According to contemporary documents, Guido wasactually referred to as “the fox.” His quality of astutia, or “cunning,” furtheridentifies him with Ulysses (see note to Inf. XXVI.58–63). [return to English[part0015.html#c27-s25-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c27-s25-i]]79–81. [part0015.html#c27-s27-e] Guido’s nautical metaphors clearly relate him,perhaps more plainly than before, to Ulysses. For the curious notice on the partof Filippo Villani (in his life of Guido Bonatti) that Guido da Montefeltro was“full of all cunning [astutia]” and that he was known among the Italians as “thenew Ulysses” see Hollander (Holl.1980.1), p. 142. This would suggest eitherthat, in Dante’s day, Guido was actually referred to in this way, or thatFilippo, a great reader of Dante, is freely interpreting the reason for thejuxtaposition of these two great figures in Inferno. [return to English[part0015.html#c27-s27-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c27-s27-i]]82–84. [part0015.html#c27-s28-e] Guido speaks of his contrition, confession,and satisfaction as though they were the merest of conveniences to attain anend. Do we believe, on the strength of this account, that he had actually fooledGod? [return to English [part0015.html#c27-s28-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c27-s28-i]]85–93. [part0015.html#c27-s29-e] Guido’s vicious slam of Boniface, with itsconcomitant enthusiasm for the abandoned devotion to crusading, is not in anyrespect at odds with Dante’s own thoughts. Boniface is attacking Palestrina andits Christian inhabitants, none of whom had joined the Saracens in theirretaking of Acre in 1291, until then the only remaining Christian possession inthe Holy Land, or gone there only to do business with the enemy. Instead ofattacking the infidel (or backsliding Christians) he moves against hiscoreligionists.Boniface cares nothing for Christians, according to Guido (and Dante). Not onlydoes he not oppose the heathen in order to make war on his own, he does nothonor his own holy orders, nor those of Guido the friar. The use of the termcapestro (cord) here has implications for those who believe that the corda atInferno XVI.106 is a reference to Dante’s status as a Franciscan. (See note toInf. XVI.106–108.) [return to English [part0015.html#c27-s29-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c27-s29-i]]94–97. [part0015.html#c27-s32-e] In the fourth century, Constantine, sufferingfrom leprosy, had Pope Sylvester I brought to him from his cave on Soracte(where he was in hiding because of Constantine’s persecution of Christians) tocure him. When the pontiff did so, Constantine converted to Christianity (andended up in paradise, according to Dante [Par. XX.55–60]); but he also out ofgratitude was reputed to have given Sylvester authority over the western empire,centered in the city of Rome. (See note to Inf. XIX.115–117.)

The Colonna family were in rebellion againstBoniface’s authority and had defended themselves in this fortress. [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c27-s34-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c27-s34-i]]103–105. [part0015.html#c27-s35-e] Boniface’s claim is utterly false, as Guidowill learn. His reference to Celestine V here makes it seem all the more likelythat it is he who is referred to in Inferno III.59–60. [return to English[part0015.html#c27-s35-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c27-s35-i]]106–111. [part0015.html#c27-s36-e] Silence as a defensive weapon against thispope was probably the only way out; but his imposing insistence was too much forGuido, and he makes his bargain.A continuing debate follows verse 110. Did Dante read these words in chroniclerswho preceded him (e.g., Riccobaldo of Ferrara, Francesco Pipino of Bologna, bothof whom wrote before 1313, if we are not sure exactly when), or did they getthem from Dante? Some contemporary commentators (e.g., Bosco/Reggio) favor theprecedence of Riccobaldo’s chronicle, perhaps written between 1308 and 1313, andbelieve that Dante’s account (and revision of his former positive view of Guido)derive from it. [return to English [part0015.html#c27-s36-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c27-s36-i]]112–114. [part0015.html#c27-s38-e] Markulin (Mark.1982.1) considers thepossibility that Guido has invented the battle between St. Francis and the blackCherub (a member of the second highest rank of angels, associated withknowledge). Discomfort with the scene has been abroad for a while. Castelvetrodid not hide his annoyance, seeing that Dante had portrayed the soul of Francisas having made an error in thinking that Guido was to be saved and thus couldnot possibly have been sent from heaven by God (and was consequently wasting histime), for which reasons he criticizes Dante for not speaking with greaterreverence.Guido’s son Buonconte will be caught up in a similar struggle between devil andangel, with the angel winning (Purg. V.104–105). Such a scene may findjustification in medieval popularizing art, but Castelvetro is right to complainabout its theological absurdities. On the other hand, Dante is writing a poemand not a treatise. That he repeats the motif would seem to indicate that we aremeant to take it “seriously.” See note to Inferno XXIII.131. [return to English[part0015.html#c27-s38-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c27-s38-i]]116. [part0015.html#c27-s39-e] Perhaps the most discussed issue in these cantosis developed from this verse. What is “fraudulent advice” (consiglio frodolente)precisely? Is it the sin that condemns Guido? Is Ulysses condemned for the samesin? Fraudulent counsel is giving someone evil advice (whether or not it iseffective advice) or acting in such fraudulent ways as to lead others intoharming themselves. Since Virgil, in Canto XI.52–60, leaves the sins of theeighth and ninth bolgia unnamed, this is the only indication we have for a cleardetermination of the sin punished in these two cantos. Any other solution seemsless satisfactory, if there have been many who have been eager to try to findone. [return to English [part0015.html#c27-s39-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c27-s39-i]]118–120. [part0015.html#c27-s40-e] While Dante, in Convivio III.xiii.2, clearlystates that fallen angels cannot philosophize, since love is a basic requirementof true philosophizing and they are without love, it is clear that they can uselogic, one of the tools of philosophy.

[part0015.html#c27-s43-e] Unlike Ulysses, who ends his speech with acertain majesty, Guido insists upon his bitterness, realizing eternally hisfoolishness in his having given over his chance for love and salvation when hedid the bidding of Boniface. The canto opens with Ulysses’ flame calm and steady(vv. 1–2) and ends with that of Guido writhing. [return to English[part0015.html#c27-s43-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c27-s43-i]]INFERNO XXVIII [part0015.html#c28-e]1–6. [part0015.html#c28-s01-e] For Dante’s disclaimer of the ability todescribe the blood and wounds that surpass both words and memory (even were heto revert to prose to do so), see Virgil’s similar disclaimer in AeneidVI.625–627: “And if I had a hundred tongues and as many mouths, along with avoice of iron, I could not put together all the shapes of crime nor run throughall the catalogue of torments.” The passage was first cited by Pietro di Danteand is now a commonplace in the commentaries. [return to English[part0015.html#c28-s01-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c28-s01-i]]7–21. [part0015.html#c28-s03-e] This elliptical version of a simile, so rich inits catalog of the horrors of war, involves four battles (or series of battles),two of them ancient, two modern, roughly as follows: [return to English[part0015.html#c28-s03-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c28-s03-i]]1150 B.C. ca. Aeneas’s Trojans triumph in south and central Italy; 216 B.C.Romans are defeated by the Carthaginians at Cannae; 1070 ca. Robert Guiscard’sNormans defeat the Saracens; 1266 & 1268 Manfred, then Conradin, defeated byCharles of Anjou.In this series of military actions the Roman and/or imperial side first wins,then loses disastrously. The intrinsic view of history here is more chaotic thandirected. Absent is Dante’s more optimistic view of history unfolding as a Romanand Christian manifestation of the spirit moving through time to its appointedgoal. And we might further reflect that winning and losing battles has little todo with one’s final destination in God’s plan: Aeneas wins, but is in Limbo(Inf. IV.122), Robert Guiscard wins and is in heaven (Par. XVIII.48), Manfredloses and is on his way to heaven (Purg. III.112).For Dante’s relation to martial epic, a genre surely drawn to our attention bythese scenes of war, see Hollander (Holl.1989.1). While Dante’s position herewould also seem to look down on “mere” martial epic, with all its pointlessslaughter, he nonetheless reveals an aptitude for the genre.9–11. [part0015.html#c28-s03-e] Puglia (Apulia) here, most commentators agree,is meant in its wider sense, i.e., not only the southeast portion of the Italianpeninsula, but the region including Lazio. The Trojans are then Aeneas and hismen (some believe the reference is to the later Romans). The “long war” is thesecond Punic War (218–201 B.C.), during which the Romans suffered a terribledefeat at the hands of Hannibal’s Carthaginian forces at Cannae (216 B.C.) inApulia. Historians relate that after the battle a Carthaginian envoy showed theRoman senate the vast number of gold rings taken from the fingers of nobleRomans killed in the battle.

Commentators point out that Dante here would ratherseem to be following Orosius (or Augustine) than Livy, but still appeals to Livyas the most authoritative historian of Rome. His vast compendium, Ab urbecondita, did not come through the ages intact; precisely which parts of it wereknown to Dante is not known to us.

[part0015.html#c28-s05-e] Robert Guiscard, a Norman, won many victoriesin Puglia ca. 1060–80 to consolidate his power as duke of the region, includingwhat for Dante was the most important one, that over the Saracens, whichapparently helped to gain him his place in Paradiso (XVIII.48).

[part0015.html#c28-s05-e] The text alludes to Manfred’s disastrous loss,occasioned, in Dante’s view, by the betrayal of his Apulian allies, at thebattle near Ceperano that was prologue to his final defeat and death at thehands of the forces of the French king Charles of Valois at the battle ofBenevento (1266). Manfred is the first saved soul found once Dante begins hisascent of the mount of purgatory (Purg. III.112). [return to English[part0015.html#c28-s05-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c28-s05-i]]17–18. [part0015.html#c28-s06-e] Two years after the defeat at Benevento, theGhibelline forces, now under Conradin, the grandson of the emperor Frederick II,suffered their final defeat near Tagliacozzo, in the Abruzzi, again at the handsof the forces of Charles of Anjou, who, after the battle, had Conradin put todeath, thus ending the Hohenstaufen succession in Italy. Alardo was the Frenchknight Érard de Valéry, who gave Charles the strategic advice that gained himmilitary advantage on the field.

[part0015.html#c28-s07-e] This image, suggesting layers of excavatedbattlefields, each containing vast areas of wounded soldiers holding out theirmutilated limbs, gives us some sense of Dante’s view of the end result of war,sheer human butchery.

[part0015.html#c28-s12-e] All punished here are described by this verse.“Scandal,” in this sense, means a promulgated doctrine that leads others tostumble and lose their way to the truth. See Thomas Aquinas, Summa theologicaII–II, q. 43, a. 1, resp., on the Greek word σκ˙αƲδαλοƲ, or “stumbling block.”Thus all here either caused schism in others or themselves lead schismaticgroups, the first three religious (Mohammed, Alì, Fra Dolcino), the last fivepolitical (Pier da Medicina, Malatestino, Curio, Mosca, Bertran de Born).[return to English [part0015.html#c28-s12-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c28-s12-i]]37–40. [part0015.html#c28-s13-e] The unseen devil of this ditch joins the castof devils of the Malebolge, the whippers of the first bolgia and the hookers ofthe fifth. In this case there seems to be one devil alone, perhaps intended toremind the reader of the solitary Cherub, with flaming sword, sent to guard theGarden after Adam and Eve had been ejected from it (Gen. 3:24). (See PurgatorioVIII.25–27, where this passage is more clearly alluded to.) It is only inMalebolge that we find such creatures.

But how or why he thinks that such as they can loiter inhell, doing a bit of sightseeing before they go to judgment, is not easilyexplained. Virgil’s response (v. 49) makes it clear that only he, in this pairof visitors, is a dead soul. [return to English [part0015.html#c28-s15-e] /Italian [part0022.html#c28-s15-i]]55–60. [part0015.html#c28-s19-e] Disabused of his erring view, Mohammed usesthe occasion to send a message to his fellow in religious schism, Fra Dolcino. Anortherner, from Novara (balancing the southern setting of the opening of thecanto), Dolcino Tornielli was the head, from ca. 1300, of a group known as theApostolic Brethren (gli Apostolici). This “order” had as its aim the restorationof the simplicity of apostolic times to the Christian religion. Its enemiesaccused Dolcino of holding heretical ideas, such as the community of goods andwomen. It did not help Dolcino’s case that he was accompanied by a beautifulwoman, Margaret of Trent, reputed to be his mistress. Pope Clement V preached acrusade against the Brethren in 1305. In 1307, starved out by their enemies inthe high country to which they had retreated, the Brethren were captured.Margaret and Dolcino were burned at the stake.

[part0015.html#c28-s21-e] Mohammed’s placement of his suspended foot isread by some as a mere “realistic detail.” Rasha Al-Sabah (Alsa.1977.1) arguesfor an iconographic reading, based in a passage in St. Thomas on Proverbs6:12–19, in which “a wicked man with lying mouth, sowing discord,” has “feetthat are swift in running to mischief.” His posture, one foot suspended, mayalso refer to the Greek term “σκ˙αƲδαλοƲ,” for “stumbling block,” found at v.35.

[part0015.html#c28-s22-e] This bloodied figure, thus sliced by thesword-wielding devil, will be revealed as Pier da Medicina at v. 73. For thereminiscence of Virgil’s description of the disfigured visage of Deiphobus (Aen.VI.494–497), similarly deprived of his nose, see Scartazzini’s commentary andmany later ones as well.

[part0015.html#c28-s24-e] The early commentators are not sure exactlywho Pier of Medicina (a town between Bologna and Imola) was, but Dante and heapparently knew one another. While the nature of his schismatic behavior thuslies in shadow, the fact that his ensuing remarks refer to political intriguewould seem to mark him also as a political, rather than a religious, schismatic.[return to English [part0015.html#c28-s24-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c28-s24-i]]76–81. [part0015.html#c28-s26-e] Pier refers, in his prophecy, which parallelsthat given by Mohammed, initially to two victims of “schism,” Guido del Casseroand Angiolello di Carignano, first identified by Guiniforto in 1440, and then tothe victimizer, Malatestino Malatesta, lord of Rimini. (He is referred to as“the younger mastiff” in the last canto at v. 46.) The details are not known toany commentators, but apparently Dante knew that these two leaders of the cityof Fano were tricked by Malatestino into coming to confer with him at the townof La Cattolica. His men caught them in their ship on their way (or after theyleft) and drowned them. [return to English [part0015.html#c28-s26-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c28-s26-i]]82–84. [part0015.html#c28-s28-e] Unriddled, the passage means that the entireMediterranean Sea never witnessed so great a crime.

[part0015.html#c28-s35-e] The description of Mosca dei Lamberti is oneof the most affecting in this canto filled with affective moments. Mosca wasamong those Florentine citizens mentioned by Dante (Inf. VI.80) as havingattempted to do good in the divided city; for his crime, of those mentioned heis the farthest down in hell. A fervent Ghibelline, in 1216 he urged the murderof Buondelmonte dei Buondelmonti, who, engaged to a girl of the Amidei family,married a Donati instead. The result of this killing was the origin of thebitter rivalry between the Amidei and the Donati, Ghibellines and Guelphsrespectively, and of the civil discord that tore Florence apart. Mosca is thusseen as a modern-day Curio, urging the powerful to do what in their hearts theymust have known was not to be done.His words, “a done deed finds its purpose,” so mercilessly laconic, now causehim enough by way of regret that we can sense some justification in Dante’soriginal characterization of him.

[part0015.html#c28-s44-e] Bertran de Born, one of the great poets ofwar of his or any time (and thus greatly admired by Ezra Pound in the lastcentury) loved to see destruction of towns and men. One thinks of RobertDuvall’s character in Francis Ford Coppola’s film Apocalypse Now, who loved thesmell of napalm in the morning. It is often pointed out that v. 132 is a repriseof a passage in the Lamentations of Jeremiah (Lament. 1:12), already cited byDante in the opening verses of an “exploded” sonnet in his Vita nuova (VII.1–3)to express his own solitary sadness in love. In a sense, they are part ofBertran’s punishment, the “tough guy” portrayed as self-pitying.Bertran was a Gascon nobleman of the second half of the twelfth century. Hispoetry, written in Provençal, which is reflected in several passages in thiscanto, is not the subject of his discourse. Rather, he condemns himself for hisimplacable schismatic actions at the English court, where he supported andencouraged the rebellious plotting of Prince Henry against his own father, HenryII, king of the realm. For a text that encapsulates the problem presented inBertran and all the other political schismatics, see Luke 11:17: “Every kingdomdivided against itself is brought to desolation” (cited by Marianne Shapiro[Shap.1974.1], p. 114).For the reference to Ahitophel’s similar support and encouragement of Absalom’srebellion against his father, King David, see II Samuel 15:7–18:15.

[part0015.html#c28-s47-e] The word contrapasso is generally understood tobe based on an Aristotelian term in its Latin translation, contrapassum, used inthe same sense that the biblical concept of retribution, expressed in the Latinlex talionis (the taking of an eye for an eye, etc.), is understood to have.That is, one does something wrong and receives the appropriate punishment fordoing it. Out of the Hebrew and Aristotelian concept (the latter refined byThomas’s commentary on Aristotle), Dante supposedly developed this idea, whichis given a name here, but has been operative since we saw the first sinners inhell, the neutrals, in Canto III. For a lengthy and helpful gloss, see Singletonon this verse. Valerio Lucchesi (Lucc.1991.1) has mounted a complex argumentattempting to deny this positive understanding of the term by Dante on the basisof its instability as a concept that St. Thomas actually embraces.

[part0015.html#c29-s01-e] Dante’s weeping eyes have reminded commentators,beginning with Tommaseo, of biblical sources, particularly Isaiah 16:9 and 34:7,as well as Ezekiel 23:33. Durling (Durl.1996.1), p. 458, suggests an echo of apassage in St. Augustine’s Confessions (VI.8), when Alypius is described asbecoming drunk at the sight of the blood spilled at the Roman games.

[part0015.html#c29-s03-e] Virgil’s sarcastic thrust for the first time inthe poem offers us a measurement of the size of one of the areas of hell: thisbolgia is twenty-two miles in circumference. (We will discover, at Inf. XXX.86,that the next bolgia’s circumference is exactly half this one’s.) These twomeasurements were the cause of an orgy of calculating in the Renaissance,involving no less a figure than Galileo in absurd plottings of an implausiblyhuge Inferno. For an account of these see John Kleiner (Klei.1994.1), pp. 23–56.[return to English [part0015.html#c29-s03-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c29-s03-i]]10.

He goes on to add that Servius,in his commentary to Aeneid VI.255, pointed out that only a single day wasgranted by the gods for Aeneas’s journey to the underworld. We understand thatthe same is true for Dante, whose voyage in hell takes exactly twenty-fourhours. [return to English [part0015.html#c29-s04-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c29-s04-i]]11–12. [part0015.html#c29-s04-e] Virgil’s lunar time-telling suggests that,since Inferno XXI.112, some six hours have passed, making it ca. 1:30 PM now andleaving less than five hours for the completion of the journey.

[part0015.html#c29-s05-e] Defending himself against the charge of idlecuriosity, Dante informs Virgil that he was looking for the shade of a relativeamong the schismatics. The exchange shows that Virgil cannot in fact “read”Dante’s thoughts. See note to Inferno XXIII.25–30. [return to English[part0015.html#c29-s05-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c29-s05-i]]22–27. [part0015.html#c29-s08-e] Virgil now adds some details to Canto XXVIII:he had seen Geri del Bello menace Dante while the protagonist was so preoccupiedby Bertran de Born. This family drama runs as follows. Geri del Bello, Dante’sfather’s cousin, was evidently something of a troublemaker (he was once citedfor attacking a man in Prato in 1280). He was murdered, perhaps at about thistime, by a member of the Sacchetti family, and revenge was only achieved byanother member of the Alighieri clan ca. 1310 (perhaps just as Dante wasfinishing Inferno). The details are far from clear, and the accounts in theearly commentators diverge. See Simonetta Saffiotti Bernardi and RenatoPiattoli, “Alighieri, Geri,” ED, vol. 1, 1970. [return to English[part0015.html#c29-s08-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c29-s08-i]]31–36. [part0015.html#c29-s11-e] For the delicate interplay between Dante’saristocratic sense of the necessity of acting on behalf of his family’s honorand his Christian knowledge that vengeance is the province of God alone, seePertile (Pert.1998.1), pp. 378–84. Pertile also argues that Dante and Geri playout the roles of Aeneas and Dido in the underworld, when the guilty former loverfails to communicate with the shade of his offended dead paramour and leaveswith his guilt unresolved (Aen. VI.450–476). Dante’s feeling pio—piteous towardGeri—would seem to connect him with Virgil’s pius Aeneas, who also honored hisfamiliars.

The first thirty-six verses of the canto havebeen a sort of personal addendum to the last canto; the rest of it will combinewith the next one to present the final ditch of the Malebolge, devoted to thepunishment of forgery, in various forms: of metals (all in Canto XXIX), ofpersons, of coins, of words (all in Canto XXX). For the “fraudulent” blending ofmetals by alchemists, those punished in the rest of this canto, see Meye.1969.1.[return to English [part0015.html#c29-s13-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c29-s13-i]]40–45. [part0015.html#c29-s14-e] These “lay brothers” of the “monastery” of theforgers are piteous in their aspect and in their groans; the protagonist, now ofsterner stuff than he had been under the influence of his relative’s unavengedmurder, covers his ears (where he had feasted his drunken eyes at the beginningof the canto).

But what does it mean that she records or“registers” them? And where is “here”? Most early commentators argued that“here” referred to the bolgia. Beginning in the Renaissance, the majoritybelieve that it refers to this world. But what sense does it make to say thatjustice “registers” sinners in this world? The image is of writing down aperson’s name in a book. For a review of the debate over the line (57) seeHollander (Holl.1982.1), proposing that “here” means “this book,” i.e., Dante’sInferno, a solution put forth (although never discussed by later commentators)by John of Serravalle in the fifteenth century. Dante will once again (and onlyonce again) use the verb registrare: see Purgatorio XXX.63, when his name,“Dante,” is “registered here,” i.e., in his text. [return to English[part0015.html#c29-s18-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c29-s18-i]]58–66. [part0015.html#c29-s20-e] Details from Ovid’s lengthy account of theplague, sent by Juno, on the island of Aegina (Metam. VII.523–657) is here usedin simile to describe the falsifiers, who have become plague-blasted shades ofhumans because of their counterfeiting, in which that which is worth less ismade to seem worth more. That their affliction is an infernal version of leprosy(some commentators believe it is scabies [see v. 82]) is attested byBosco/Reggio (commentary to this verse) on the basis of medieval medicaltreatises, some of which report that scabies is a secondary symptom of leprosy.Capocchio, the second of the two sinners revealed here, is described as“leprous” (v. 124).In verse 63 Dante takes mere poetic fictiveness to task (in Conv. IV.xxvii.17 hehad referred to this story as a favola [fable]). His “real” sinners may resemblethe plague-victims in Ovid’s fanciful tale; unlike them, however, they are notpresent in a fable, but in a truthful narrative. Here Dante’s insistence on theveracity of what he relates is so challenging that we can see the wink in hiseye. [return to English [part0015.html#c29-s20-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c29-s20-i]]73–84. [part0015.html#c29-s25-e] The three rapid comparisons are the very stuffof homely poetry: pans on a stove, stable boys currying horses, cooks’ helperscleaning fish. We have seen precisely this stylistic range before, pairedsimiletic passages describing the same thing in two very different registers,that of classical myth deployed alongside that of “scenes from everyday life.”Among other things, this second register, with its ordinary, even ugly, names ofthings in the real world, helps us “believe” that Dante’s poetry is in fact“true,” while Ovid’s is not—even as we acknowledge that Dante is as much afabulist as was Ovid. [return to English [part0015.html#c29-s25-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c29-s25-i]]85–90. [part0015.html#c29-s29-e] Even Virgil’s ironic captatio, his attempt towin Griffolino’s goodwill, reflects the low style of things in this scene.[return to English [part0015.html#c29-s29-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c29-s29-i]]109–120. [part0015.html#c29-s37-e] Griffolino d’Arezzo was in fact burned atthe stake for a charge of heresy brought by Albero di Siena, perhaps the naturalson of the bishop of Siena, ca. 1270. Thus he was put to death for a sin he didnot commit, but condemned by God for the one he did: falsifying metals. Danteobviously enjoyed telling this tale of buffoonish credulity, in which Griffolinofailed in his role of Daedalus to Albero’s Icarus, and which would have fit anovella of Boccaccio, even though it is irrelevant to the sin punished here.[return to English [part0015.html#c29-s37-e] / Italian[part0022.html#c29-s37-i]]121–123. [part0015.html#c29-s41-e] Florentines love to belittle the Sienese;Italians love to belittle the French. Dante gets two for one.

As was the case when we listened to Griffolino, what we first hearabout from him does not concern falsification, but another topic altogether—theluxurious living of the Sienese, down to their overindulgence in the use ofcloves to season their food. This is exemplified in Stricca the spendthrift;Niccolò the gourmet; and Caccia d’Asciano who, with Abbagliato, was part of thenotorious brigata spendereccia (Spendthrift Brigade) of Siena, which liked togather to eat and drink and then destroy the plates and service while they wereat it.

[part0015.html#c29-s46-e] Capocchio was, according to some earlycommentators, known to Dante in their early days as students. He was supposedlya particularly adept imitator of the words and gestures of others, a talentwhich he later extended to “alchemical” malfeasance, to his cost. For theconcept of the ape as mimic, see Curtius (Curt.1948.1), pp. 538–40. [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c29-s46-e] / Italian [part0022.html#c29-s46-i]]INFERNO XXX [part0015.html#c30-e]1–12. [part0015.html#c30-s01-e] This is the first of two lengthy classicalopening similes derived from the third, fourth, and thirteenth books of Ovid’sMetamorphoses. Dante’s classical material in this first sally involves thematter of Thebes, his favorite example of the “city of destruction” in ancienttimes. Juno, jealous of Semele, daughter of Cadmus, founder of Thebes, takes outher wrath on the city by destroying Semele herself (only referred to indirectlyhere in v. 3) and her sister, Ino, the consort of Athamas, king of Orchomenus.Juno’s revenge in this second instance is achieved by making Athamas go mad. Inhis distemper he kills his son Learchus, thus causing Ino to leap with the other(Melicertes) into the sea (see Metam. IV.512–530). [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s01-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c30-s01-i]]13–21. [part0015.html#c30-s05-e] The second tale is related to Troy, that otherclassical “city of destruction.” After the fall of the city, the widowed queen,Hecuba, was, according to Ovid’s account in his thirteenth book, carried off bythe Greeks. When they stopped in Thrace, she witnessed the sacrifice of herdaugher Polyxena on the tomb of Achilles and then, when she had gone to the seafor water to prepare the corpse for burial, found the body of her son Polydorus,murdered by the Thracian king, Polymnestor, washed up on the shore beside her.At this she went mad, and began barking like a dog (Metam. XIII.404–406).Finally, she killed Polymnestor, according to Ovid, by tearing out his eyes.[return to English [part0015.html#c30-s05-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c30-s05-i]]22–27. [part0015.html#c30-s08-e] The completion of each opening simileticcomparison is only now put forward. Reduced to madness, Athamas kills his ownchild, Hecuba, the king who had killed her son (Metam. XIII.558–564).Nonetheless, they are less savage than the two bestial forms that now appear.[return to English [part0015.html#c30-s08-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c30-s08-i]]28–33. [part0015.html#c30-s10-e] One of these two sinners attacks and bears offCapocchio, who had held our attention at the end of the last canto. This newshade is thus associated with Athamas, acting out his maddened rage, and isidentified by Griffolino, the other sinner we met in Canto XXIX, as GianniSchicchi. Where Capocchio had been scratching himself, he now gets his scabrousbelly scraped by the ground as he is dragged off.Gianni Schicchi was a member of the Florentine Cavalcanti family and wasrenowned for his ability to impersonate others. He was dead by 1280.Commentators speculate that Dante would have heard tell of his impersonationswhile he was still a boy. One particular case is detailed a few lines farther on(vv. 42–45). [return to English [part0015.html#c30-s10-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c30-s10-i]]37–41. [part0015.html#c30-s13-e] Griffolino explains to Dante that the otherfurious shade is that of Ovid’s Myrrha (Metam. X.298–502). She, daughter ofCinyras, king of Cyprus, disguised herself, abetted by her nurse, as a willingyoung woman (her mother being absent) in order to sleep with her father. In thedevelopment of the canto, she is at least formally in parallel with Hecuba(since Gianni plays the part of Athamas), but beyond their common femininesavagery there is little to associate them.We may speculate that all the Ovidian material of this canto has marginalizedVirgil. Indeed, he does not speak a word until v. 131. This is the longestsilence on his part since he entered the poem in its first canto; it is 169lines since he last spoke at XXIX.101. For preceding long Virgilian silences seeInferno V.112–VI.93; XV.1–99; XVI.18–121. In two cantos he speaks only a singleverse: Inferno XV.99 and XXVII.33. However, the longest Virgilian silences inthe poem await us. Inferno XXXII is the first canto in the poem in which he doesnot speak a word (and he is silent between XXXI.134 and XXXIII.106, a total of255 verses); Purgatorio XXIV is the second and the longest (with Virgil silentbetween XXIII.15 and XXV.17, a total of 288 verses).

[part0015.html#c30-s14-e] The story of Gianni Schicchi’s impersonationof the dead and testamentless Buoso Donati in order to help the survivingSchicchi family members get an inheritance they feared they would otherwise losedelighted the early commentators, who take pleasure in repeating it. Gianni’spayment for himself was to will himself the best animal—the lead mule—of Buoso’sherd. Puccini’s opera, bearing his name as its title, continues to purveyGianni’s tale.

[part0015.html#c30-s16-e] Reading the last canto for the first time, wemay have assumed that the tenth bolgia was devoted to detailing the punishmentof a single form of falsification, alchemical deceptions, punished in a singleway, by the scabs that cover the bodies of these leprous sinners (see note toInf. XXIX.58–66). After reading Canto XXX we have learned that there is a totalof four species of falsification, each punished by a particular disease. Thethree species in this canto are as follows: impersonators (hydrophobia),counterfeiters of coin (dropsy), perjurors (fever). Here we come to the secondin this group, the counterfeiters. [return to English [part0015.html#c30-s16-e]/ Italian [part0023.html#c30-s16-i]]49–51. [part0015.html#c30-s17-e] For the musical elements in the description ofthis sinner (he will find a name, Master Adam, at v. 61), see Iannucci(Iann.1995.1). The lute, which resembles “a pregnant guitar” (as a waggishstudent of music once insisted) was, in Dante’s time, generally regarded as a“serious” instrument, like David’s harp, and thus associated with the “right”kind of musical performance. Iannucci points out (p. 114) that this is the onlystringed instrument mentioned in hell. Adam, who looks like a lute, ends upsounding like a drum (v. 103), an instrument, as Iannucci argues, associatedwith such lower forms of musical amusement as public spectacles. For thesymbolic inversions in the musicality of this scene see Heilbronn (Heil.1983.1).[return to English [part0015.html#c30-s17-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c30-s17-i]]52–57. [part0015.html#c30-s18-e] Dropsy, in which a main symptom is theretention of water, which distends parts of the body, was also characterized byterrible thirst.

Master Adam, according to some commentators anEnglishman, was in the employ of the Conti Guidi of Romena (in the Casentino,not far from Florence). (We will hear more of this family in vv. 73–87.) Theyconvinced him to falsify the gold florin, stamped with the image of John theBaptist, the patron of Florence, by pouring gold of only 21 (and not 24) carats,thus reducing its purity by one-eighth. On the symbolic importance of money, asit is reflected in this canto, see Shoaf (Shoa.1983.1), pp. 39–48. Adam’s crimewas discovered and he was burned alive in Florence in 1281.His name almost inevitably reminds the reader of his namesake, the first sinner.For discussion of the way in which this “new Adam” is in fact a modern versionof the first one, see Mussetter (Muss.1978.1).As many note, the language here again reflects that found in the Lamentations ofJeremiah. See note to Inferno XXVIII.130–138. [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s20-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c30-s20-i]]64–69. [part0015.html#c30-s22-e] Adam’s memories of “the green hills of home”torment him, only increasing his punishment. What for the reader is a moment ofpastoral escape from hellish thoughts is for him torment. For a Virgilian sourceof the image see Eclogue X.42, describing “cool streams and gentle meadows.”[return to English [part0015.html#c30-s22-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c30-s22-i]]76–78. [part0015.html#c30-s26-e] Envy, often marked by the desire to see thosewho are well off suffering, rules Adam’s heart. He would rather see hisemployers punished than slake his thirst. Fonte Branda, according to the earlycommentators, is the famous spring in Siena. Later writers have argued foranother, of the same name, in the vicinity of Romena. However, that the earliestcommentators do not refer to it probably seconds the notion that the more famousone is referred to here.

[part0015.html#c30-s27-e] Guido had died in 1281 and news of hislocation in this bolgia has reached Adam through one of the rabid impersonatorswho range the territory.

[part0015.html#c30-s28-e] Adam’s “impossible dream” is to be able tomove an inch in a hundred years—and even that is beyond him. Were it not,Manfredi Porena did the math and calculated that, at even this speed, it wouldtake him 700,000 years to find Guido.That this bolgia is half the circumference and breadth of the last one has giventhose who would like to establish the exact size of Dante’s hell the twocoordinates they think they need. Such calculation is a temptation to beavoided. See the note to Inferno XXIX.8–9. Adam undercalculates the diameter,which is 3.5 miles, considerably. We reflect that his dubious measurement is theresult of his dropsied bulk and consequent laziness. A half mile is hundreds ofthousands of years of (for him impossible) movement. [return to English[part0015.html#c30-s28-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c30-s28-i]]88–90. [part0015.html#c30-s30-e] Adam’s hatred of the Conti Guidi isunderstandable; his placing the entire blame on them for his own misdeeds istypical of certain sinners, always finding a cause for their failures in thehearts and minds of others.

[part0015.html#c30-s33-e] Adam first identifies Potiphar’s wife (Gen.39:6–20), who, having failed to seduce Joseph, accused him before Pharaoh ofattempting to seduce her. Then he identifies Sinon (as he is known from thesecond book of the Aeneid), whose misrepresentations led to the destruction ofTroy. Both suffer from high fever, seen not as a symptom of other ailments, butas a disease in itself; both worked treacherously against a “chosen people,” theHebrews and the Trojans.

[part0015.html#c30-s34-e] Angered by the words of Master Adam, Sinon’sfirst gesture is to strike him on his taut paunch, which booms like a drum. Thisact begins a series of exchanged insults, begun and ended by Adam. Until thelast in the series, each one occupies a single tercet (Adam’s final flourishwill occupy two). As many who have written on this scene have reflected, Dante’stechnique here is modeled on the exchange of poetic insult found in the genrecalled tenzone. See note to Inferno VIII.31–39.

[part0015.html#c30-s39-e]Not only are these exchanges generallyreflective of the tradition of the tenzone, this particular verse has been seen(e.g., Casini/Barbi’s commentary in 1921) as rehearsing a particular tenzone,one between Cecco Angiolieri and Dante (whose sonnet, apparently the occasionfor Cecco’s, is lost). Cecco’s (“Dante Alighieri, s’i’ so’ bon begolardo”)begins roughly as follows: Dante Alighieri, if I’m a foolish bard, I can feel your lance just behind my back; If I’m out for dinner, you’re there for a snack; If I chew the fat, you but suck the lard.

[part0015.html#c30-s42-e] Adam’s last words remind Sinon that, even ifthe counterfeiter is suffering from dropsy, his accuser has got a case of fever.His last riposte jibes at Sinon’s thirst, which would lead him to the “mirror ofNarcissus,” i.e., a pool that would reflect his true, hideous self—which imagehe would destroy out of thirst, in a sort of grubby version of the originalmyth. As Brownlee pointed out, this reference begins the “Narcissus program” inthe Commedia, which includes references to the myth in a number of passages, andin all cantos numbered XXX (Brow.1978.1), pp. 205–6.

Dante’s emphatic acceptance of it stands inclear contrast to his rejection of the similar rebuke in the last canto (Inf.XXIX.4–12), where Virgil had not understood the cause of his staring into theninth bolgia. Here Dante has become an interested bystander (rather than a manwith a mission), enjoying the back-and-forth argument between the two sinners(just as do we) because it is both violent and amusing.

[part0015.html#c30-s46-e] This is a remarkable simile (or“pseudo-simile” on the grounds that it “compares a thing, person, or emotionwith itself”—in the words of Eric Mallin (see Mall.1984.1), p. 15. (Mallindiscusses this particular simile, pp. 28–31.) Tozer’s prior remark in hiscommentary (1901) is of interest: “This is a conspicuous instance of aninteresting class of similes—viz. those drawn from mental experiences—of whichthere are as many as thirty in the Divine Comedy.” The simile is difficultenough that a prose paraphrase may help to make its point clearer: “As a mandreams of being harmed and of wishing he were only dreaming (which he in factis), so did I, unable to speak, feel ashamed because I could not excusemyself—while all the while my blushing was doing just that for me.” [return toEnglish [part0015.html#c30-s46-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c30-s46-i]]142–148. [part0015.html#c30-s48-e] Virgil accepts Dante’s unvoiced apology andwarns him against future backsliding of this kind. Berthier, in his gloss, citesfrom St. Bernard, De ordine vitae, from a passage, he says, located “before itsmiddle”: “audire quod turpe est, pudori maximo est” (it is most shameful to giveear to vile things).

[part0016.html#c31-s01-e] The reader—at least on a second reading—mayadmire Dante’s insistence on his authorial freedom in not marking the borderbetween Malebolge and the ninth Circle at the canto’s edge. Instead, withanother classical simile (and Momigliano notes the large numbers of classicalallusions sprinkled through Cantos XXVIII–XXXI), he delays the transition untilv. 7.Virgil’s rebuke in Canto XXX.130–132 had both caused Dante embarrassment andsupplied the antidote: his blush of shame (which reassured Virgil of hischarge’s moral development). The most likely source for Dante’s reference to thelance of Achilles, which had the magical property of curing with a second touchthe very wound that it had caused, is Ovid, Remedia Amoris I.43–44: “The Pelianspear [in Dante’s understanding, the spear of Peleus?] that once had wounded hisenemy, the son of Hercules [Telephus], also brought comfort to the wound,” atale presented as being of somewhat dubious provenance, as another one of thosepagan yarns (“so I have heard it told”). For some of the problems associatedwith this text see Singleton’s commentary. Ovid in fact refers to the speargiven by Chiron, the centaur (see Inf. XII.71), who lived on Mt. Pelion, toAchilles himself. At least one other medieval poet before Dante, Bernard deVentadour, had referred to the weapon as belonging first to Peleus. Dante knewthat Peleus was the father of Achilles, from, if nowhere else, Statius’sAchilleid (I.90). [return to English [part0016.html#c31-s01-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c31-s01-i]]7–13. [part0016.html#c31-s03-e] The departure from Malebolge and arrival in thepenumbral murk of the last bolgia is anything but dramatic. Here nothing isdistinct until Dante hears a horn-blast. We shall eventually learn that this issounded by Nimrod (v. 77). [return to English [part0016.html#c31-s03-e] /Italian [part0023.html#c31-s03-i]]16–18. [part0016.html#c31-s06-e] The reference to the Chanson de Roland, a textthat, Cecchetti reminds us, Dante knew in a form probably most unlike anythingwe read today (Cecc.1990.1, p. 409), is the reader’s first sure sign that we arein the realm of treachery, not mere “simple fraud.” As Scott points out(Scot.1985.1), pp. 29–30, for most medieval readers there was perhaps no worsebetrayal than that of Ganelon (punished in the next canto, XXXII.122), whosetreacherous act, in 778, was directed against Charlemagne, the future emperor(crowned in Rome on Christmas Day in 800) and future saint (canonized in 1165,exactly one hundred years before Dante’s birth); he betrayed Charlemagne’s rearguard to the Saracen invaders. Roland blew Oliphant, his horn, too late to bringback Charlemagne and his troops, miles distant, in time to save his part of thearmy, all of whom were slaughtered at Roncesvalles by the Saracens. Reminded ofthat blast, we know we are among the treacherous.The parallels set up by the scene are interesting. If Nimrod plays the role ofRoland, his horn-blast is timely enough to prevent the entrance of the“invaders,” Dante and Virgil, but equally ineffectual. There is an “emperor” inthis scene, too, “lo ’mperador del doloroso regno” (the emperor of the woefulkingdom), Satan (XXXIV.28). And Nimrod’s blast is meant to warn the Satanicforces of the advent of the enemy, as Roland’s was. Who is the Ganelon of thescene? Antaeus, who will “betray” his lord by helping Dante and Virgil descendinto Satan’s stronghold. If all these inverse parallels work, we have to addanother: Dante and Virgil are the Saracens in this series of analogies bycontrary.

As the guardians of this zone of hell, asthe most proximate servants of Satan, as it were, the giants are seen torepresent the sin of pride. That is how Pietro di Dante saw them centuries ago:“Gigantes figurative pro superbis accipiuntur” (The giants are to befiguratively understood as those who are prideful).

It involves improving sight, whether because a mistgradually lifts or because a walker gets closer to the indistinct object heexamines from afar.

[part0016.html#c31-s14-e] The third simile compares the looming giantswith the towers of the fortified town, Monteriggione, a Sienese outpost situatedon the road between Florence and Siena. In the thirteenth century its defensivewalls were supplemented by fourteen towers, each over sixty feet in height.For the attempt of the giants to overthrow the Olympian gods, referred toobliquely here, see note at vv. 94–96.

XI.99–105), can only be taken seriously, by a modernreader, when one considers that, according to Genesis 6:4, once “giants walkedthe earth.” Nature, as implementer of God’s design, is “more cautious and morejust” because she now fashions her largest creatures without intelligence, thusbetter protecting humans.

[part0016.html#c31-s20-e] The anatomy of the giants, visible only abovetheir waists, since the bank forms a sort of apron, or “fig leaf” (perizoma—seethe word in Gen. 3:7) for them, is described from the head down, to theirshoulders (“where men make fast their cloaks”), to their waists. The giant’shead, which resembles the bronze pinecone Dante might well have seen in Rome in1301 in the Vatican, is about eleven feet in height. Three Frieslanders, reputedto be among the tallest of men, standing on one another’s shoulders, would havereached merely from the bank to the bottom of his locks, some twenty-two feet,if we allow the topmost Frieslander to reach up with an arm toward that hair.This leaves a foot or two of neck unmeasured. Further, Dante himself, measuringby eye, thinks that the distance from the bank to the giant’s shoulders is somethirty spans (a span equals the space covered by a hand spread open), also sometwenty-two feet. Dante indicates that the giant is about thirty-five feet tallmeasured from the waist, his midpoint, and thus some seventy feet in all. Onesenses his amusement at the reader who will do this calculation. [return toEnglish [part0016.html#c31-s20-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c31-s20-i]]67. [part0016.html#c31-s23-e] The garbled speech that issues from Nimrod’smouth has caused a veritable orgy of interpretive enthusiasm. (The reader shouldbe aware that we are not at all sure about what these words looked like whenthey left Dante’s pen; as nonsense, they may have caused more scribal confusionthan others. Hence, any attempt to “construe” them should be extremely cautious,which has certainly not been the case.) Dante has variously been assumed to haveknown more Aramaic or Arabic or Hebrew than he likely could have, and to havedeployed this arcane knowledge in creating a meaningful phrase. For a review ofvarious attempts to make these words “make sense,” with bibliography, see EttoreCaccia, “Raphèl maì amècche zabì almi,” ED, vol. 4, 1973. And see the note toInferno VII.1, where Plutus also speaks five garbled words. While it is nearlycertainly true that we are not meant to be able to understand Nimrod’s words(that is the point Virgil makes, after all), it is nonetheless likely that they,like those of Plutus, should be seen as corrupted versions of words that do makesense. “Raphel” can hardly fail to remind us of the name of the archangelRaphael, “maì” seems a version of the Italian word for “ever” (or “never”),“amècche” could be a series of simple words (a me che: “to,” “me,” “that”),“zabì” sounds like a slide into dialectical speech, and “almi” is perfectly goodItalian for “holy,” “divine.” The point is not that these words make any sense;it is rather that they do not. Like Plutus’s outburst, they are meant to beunderstood as corrupted speech. And, as was true in that case, they are intendedto keep these intruders out of the place this guardian has been posted to guard.See Chiari (Chia.1967.1), p. 1107, who argues that Nimrod’s cry is the productof anger and menace common to all infernal guardians.These five words may refer to St. Paul’s desire that the Corinthians speak fivewords with understanding rather than ten thousand in tongues (I Cor. 14:19), aswas first noted by Pézard (Peza.1958.1), p. 59; he was supported by onecommentator, Giacalone, in 1968, and then by Kleinhenz (Klei.1974.1), p. 283n.Hollander (Holl.1992.1) attempts to take this ‘program’ into passages inPurgatorio and Paradiso.For the importance to Dante of St. Paul, who does not appear as a personage inthe Commedia, see Angelo Penna and Giovanni Fallani, “Paolo, santo,” ED, vol. 4,1973; Giorgio Petrocchi (Petr.1988.1).

[part0016.html#c31-s23-e] That Dante refers to this fallen speech as“psalms” (salmi), even negatively, reminds the reader that Nimrod’s wordsreflect the divine origin of language, if we hear it now in its postlapsariancondition. [return to English [part0016.html#c31-s23-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c31-s23-i]]70–81. [part0016.html#c31-s24-e] Virgil’s stinging remarks to Nimrod (which arein fact quite amusing) have drawn puzzled responses from some commentators. Whydoes Virgil address Nimrod, since the giant cannot understand him? Or are hiswords meant only for Dante? Some complain that it is like speaking to an animalfor him to speak to this creature. Precisely so. And we humans do this all thetime. It matters not at all that Nimrod cannot understand. The reader can.Virgil treats Nimrod like a drunk at a New Year’s Eve party, telling him to giveover attempts at speech and content himself with blowing his horn. Referring tothe giant’s rage, he underlines the oppositional intent of his outburst; callinghim “creature of confusion” (anima confusa), he probably alludes to the“confusion of tongues” that followed in the wake of the building of the Tower ofBabel. Before dismissing Nimrod as unworthy of further speech, Virgil makes thisassociation clear. In Genesis, Nimrod was not a giant, but “a mighty hunterbefore the Lord” (10:9). It is probably to St. Augustine, who mentions him threetimes in De civitate Dei XVI as a giant, that we owe Dante’s decision to do soas well. The building of the tower and the resultant “confusion” of language(Gen. 11:1–9) was, for Dante, one of the defining moments in the history ofhuman language, the “linguistic fall” described there paralleling the fall ofAdam and Eve. See Arno Borst (Bors.1957.1), vol. 2, pp. 869–75, for Dante’splace in the history of responses to the building of the tower.Nimrod will be referred to by name twice more in the poem (Purg. XII.34; Par.XXVI.126), so that he is mentioned once in each cantica. For this phenomenon,words that appear a single time in each cantica, see Hollander (Holl.1988.3),pp. 108–10. [return to English [part0016.html#c31-s24-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c31-s24-i]]84–90. [part0016.html#c31-s28-e] The second of the three giants whom we see inthis canto (we shall hear of three others) will be identified shortly (v. 94) asEphialtes. Unlike Nimrod, too stupid to be dangerous, this one, bigger still andfar more fierce, is capable of the harm that the poet feared in vv. 55–57.[return to English [part0016.html#c31-s28-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c31-s28-i]]91–96. [part0016.html#c31-s31-e] Ephialtes was one of the giants who attempted,by piling Pelion on Ossa, to scale Olympus and overthrow the gods. He and hisfellow rebels were killed by Jove at Phlegra (Inf. XIV.58). [return to English[part0016.html#c31-s31-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c31-s31-i]]97–105. [part0016.html#c31-s33-e] Dante wants to see Briareus because, wesuppose, he has read about him in the Aeneid (X.565–567); he has a hundred armsand hands and breathes fire from fifty mouths and breasts. It is important tonote that Virgil himself apologizes for this account: dicunt, he says, “or sothey say,” the same tactic that Dante has used when warning us against theexcesses of pagan mythmaking when he imports it to his own poem (see Inf.XXIX.63; XXXI.4). Dante, however, wants to have some fun at his fellow poet’sexpense. Briareus, Virgil explains (like a host who does not want to produce aparticularly embarrassing guest at a party), is way up ahead there, and he looksjust like Ephialtes, anyway. What Dante has made his auctor do is to apologizefor including such unbelievable rot in the divine Aeneid, while allowing Virgilto escape the discomfort of actually having to gaze upon the “normal,” Danteanversion of a proper giant, human in everything but his size. Most commentatorsdo not perceive the humor of this moment. However, for a sense of Dante’splayfulness here, see Andreoli in 1856 and Trucchi in 1936.Not only is Antaeus a “normal” giant (we see what Dante has gotten us to assentto by overruling “excessive” gigantism—an acceptance of “normal” gigantism), buthe is a relatively friendly one, unfettered, we assume, because he did not fightagainst the gods at Phlegra. The son of Neptune and Gea, Earth, Antaeus wasinvincible in combat so long as he remained in contact with earth. Hercules,discovering this, was able to hold him free from the earth and kill him,crushing him in his hands. On Dante’s treatment of Antaeus, see Rabuse(Rabu.1961.1).

[part0016.html#c31-s36-e] Ephialtes is angry, either because he thinksVirgil and Dante will have more success with Antaeus or because Virgil has saidthat Briareus looks even meaner than he. [return to English[part0016.html#c31-s36-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c31-s36-i]]113–114. [part0016.html#c31-s38-e] The size of Antaeus’s upper body, notincluding his head, is seven ells, about twenty-two feet, thus roughly the sameas Nimrod’s. [return to English [part0016.html#c31-s38-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c31-s38-i]]115–124. [part0016.html#c31-s39-e] Virgil begins by referring to the Battle ofZama in 202 B.C., where Scipio Africanus defeated Hannibal (revenge for theBattle of Cannae in 216—see Inf. XXVIII.9–11), thus successfully concluding thesecond Punic War, which had begun so badly. Needless to say, this (for Dante andany Roman-minded reader) great victory is hardly of a comparable magnitude tothat of a giant capturing a lot of lions. Thus the reference to Zama offers abackhanded compliment to Antaeus, who killed his lions in the same place thatScipio defeated Hannibal.Virgil finds himself in a difficult situation. As was not the case with Ulysses,when Virgil could boast that he had written of his exploits (even if not veryfavorably, he had at least written of the Greek hero—see Inf. XXVI.80–82), hehas not written about Antaeus at all. To make matters worse, he did once mentiona certain Antaeus, a soldier in Turnus’s ranks, mowed down by Aeneas in hisAchilles-like battlefield fury in Aeneid X.561. And, still worse, this mentionof an Antaeus who is merely a walk-on corpse in Virgil’s poem precedes by onlyfour lines Virgil’s mention of Briareus (see note to vv. 97–105). And so here isa poet who has, intrinsically at least, insulted the giant whom he now wants tocajole. What is he to do? What he does is borrow from Lucan (of course only weknow that he is accomplishing this chronologically impossible feat) in order topraise Antaeus. It was Lucan, not Virgil, who told the tale of Antaeus thelion-killer (Phars. IV.601–602), and it was Lucan, not Virgil, who explicitlycompared Antaeus favorably to Briareus, not to mention Typhon and Tityus (thetwo other giants of whom we are about to hear at v. 124). See PharsaliaIV.595–597. Gea had more reason to boast of this gigantic son, Antaeus, than ofthe others, Typhon, or Tityus, or fierce Briareus; and she was merciful to thegods when she did not set loose Antaeus on the field at Phlegra. (This detailoffers the matter for Virgil’s second instance of the greatness of Antaeus.) Itcan hardly be coincidental that all four of the giants present in Virgil’sspeech here are also together in Lucan’s text. And so Virgil’s two gesturestoward Antaeus are both taken from Lucan. It is an extraordinarily amusingmoment; one can imagine how Dante smiled as he composed it. Nonetheless, many ofhis commentators vehemently deny that this passage is ironic. It is difficult tosee with what justice they do so. For what has Virgil really said to Antaeus?“You killed a lot of lions right near the place where Rome won one of itsgreatest military victories; you didn’t fight at the battle in which yourbrothers were killed by the gods.” [return to English [part0016.html#c31-s39-e]/ Italian [part0023.html#c31-s39-i]]125–132. [part0016.html#c31-s42-e] Virgil’s captatio benevolentiae has not beensuccessful. Antaeus still needs persuading. Dante, Virgil tells him, can do whathe didn’t do: make Antaeus famous. Perhaps Antaeus was a better reader ofclassical texts than some imagine; his lip was still curled with disdain afterVirgil’s praise had ended. Fame is the spur; Antaeus bends and grasps Virgil, ina benevolent replay of his own death scene, when Hercules held him in his hands.[return to English [part0016.html#c31-s42-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c31-s42-i]]136–141. [part0016.html#c31-s46-e] The fourth and last simile of the cantorefers to one of two towers (the shorter one, in fact, but the one that “leans”the most) built in Bologna in 1109 and 1110. Towers and giants have pride incommon, and so the comparison is not without its moral reasons. Its visualreasons are indisputably stunning, a tower that seems to be falling because acloud is passing over it.

Are their feet on the floor itself or do they stand on a ledge aboveit? See the next canto, vv. 16–18 and the note thereto.

IX.100–103) nor cooperative monster (Inf.XVII.133–136).Guiniforto, in his comment to this passage, suggests that Dante must have had asmall boat in mind, the mast of which may be raised very quickly.An entire canto has been devoted to a transition from one circle to the next. Werealize, once all the exuberant poetic play has stopped, that we are on thelowest point in Dante’s universe, the floor of hell. From here, everywhere isup.

[part0016.html#c32-s01-e] Dante apologizes for not having under hiscontrol a language rough enough to be the exact counterpart of what he mustdescribe. For the relationship of the diction of the passage to that found inDante’s Rime petrose, see Poletto’s commentary (1894), perhaps the first tocontain this observation, now become customary. See also Blasucci (Blas.1969.1).The place he needs to describe is the center of the entire universe (at least itis in the geocentric view). If he had the right words, he would be able to setforth more adequately what he indeed fully understands, i.e., his conceptiondoes not come short of the nature of these things (see v. 12), but his wordsmay. Dante draws this distinction with some care. To repeat, his “conception” isone matter, his description of it another (it is the “juice” that he must“squeeze” from the “fruit” of his experience). And the setting of thatexperience into verse is no light task (impresa—for the importance of this word,referring variously to Dante’s journey and to his poem, see Holl.1969.1, p. 230,citing its other three occurrences in the poem [Inf. II.41 and II.47; Par.XXXIII.95]), not one for a tongue capable only of “babytalk.” For the linguisticprogram concerning “babytalk” found in the Commedia and its oppositionalrelation to that previously advanced by Dante in De vulgari eloquentia, seeHoll.1980.2. Here Dante is including two words, “mommy” and “daddy,” that hehimself had explicitly proscribed from the illustrious vernacular (DveII.vii.4).

For theprogram of invocation in the poem as a whole, see note to Inferno II.7–9. Herethe poet seeks aid only from the Muses and only for his ability to find theright words for his difficult task in rendering such unpleasant matter. His“conception” (see v. 4), we may understand, is already formed (in Inf. II.7 heimplicitly asked for that, as well).The reference to the poet Amphion probably derives from the Ars poetica ofHorace (vv. 394–396), a work well known to Dante. Amphion was able, through themagic of his inspired lyre-playing, to compel the rocks of Mt. Cithaeron to movedown the mountain and, of their own accord, create the walls of Thebes. Dante,describing the Infernal “city of destruction,” the ninth Circle, home ofLucifer, asks for the help of the Muses in order to build, not the physicalcity, but his image of it in words that do justice to the conception he has beengiven.

[part0016.html#c32-s05-e] The poet’s address to all the denizens ofCocytus seems to have been aimed particularly at the arch-sinner punished here,Judas, by its reference, first noted by Pietro di Dante, to Matthew 26:24,Christ’s words to Judas, for whom it had been better “not to have been born.”[return to English [part0016.html#c32-s05-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c32-s05-i]]16–18. [part0016.html#c32-s06-e] The narrative of this ultimate part of thefirst cantica has been held in abeyance for nine self-conscious opening linesabout the poet’s craft, for an invocation, and then for an apostrophe. The visitto the pit of the universe has finally begun. However, Dante’s failure to managethese details more clearly has rattled his readers. Do the giants stand on theicy floor of Cocytus? Apparently not. Here Dante asserts that he and Virgil findthemselves far below the feet of Antaeus. They do not seem, however, to havethemselves descended that distance. Rather, it seems more likely that Antaeushas set them down just about where they find themselves now. Some commentatorsobject, since most humans, and certainly most giants, are probably not limberenough (or long-armed enough) to bend at the waist and deposit a burden wellbelow the level of their feet. Do we learn where the giants stand? No. Is Danteconcerned lest their feet become chilled on the ice? No. Might they be standingon some sort of ledge? Yes. Can we be certain that they are? No. Might Antaeushave longer arms than we like to think? Yes. Can we know that he does? No. Thisis a poem, and, especially when it deals with the marvelous, while it is attimes amazingly precise, it is also, at other times, exasperatingly (to certainreaders) imprecise. As a result, beginning perhaps with Bianchi (1868),commentators have invented a ledge for Antaeus, and hence all the giants, tostand on. It has become part of the furniture of the poem, even if Dante did notconstruct it. [return to English [part0016.html#c32-s06-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c32-s06-i]]19–21. [part0016.html#c32-s07-e] The identity of this voice has long puzzledreaders. Torraca, essentially alone in this opinion, opts for Virgil; many foran unnamed sinner; many others for one (or both) of the Alberti brothers, whomwe see in vv. 41–51. Benvenuto da Imola, followed only by his student John ofSerravalle, makes probably the best surmise: the voice is that of Camicione de’Pazzi, a position that seems sensible, as we shall see as we move through thescene, but has had no success among the commentators.

[part0016.html#c32-s08-e] Dante had been looking back up in thedirection of Antaeus and wondering at the height of the wall he now stoodbeneath.

[part0016.html#c32-s13-e] This first group of sinners (we will learneventually that there are four groups, each in a somewhat different posture)have their heads facing downwards. Their mouths clatter with the cold, theireyes run with tears (as we shall find out, that is a better condition than thatenjoyed by those lower down in the ninth Circle). We are in Caïna, named forCain, the first murderer (of his brother Abel). [return to English[part0016.html#c32-s13-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c32-s13-i]]46–51. [part0016.html#c32-s16-e] These two (we will shortly learn that they arebrothers) lift up their heads to behold Dante, which causes their tears to spillover their faces and onto their lips (instead of onto the ice), thus gluing themtogether still more firmly when their tears become gelid. Frozen into a parodyof the Christian kiss of peace, they respond by moving the only part of themthey can, their foreheads, which they use to butt one another in anger. Once wehear who they are, we will understand the reason for such hatred. [return toEnglish [part0016.html#c32-s16-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c32-s16-i]]54–69. [part0016.html#c32-s18-e] The speaker is Camicione de’ Pazzi. Nothingmuch is known of him except that he, from near Florence (the Val d’Arno)murdered his relative Ubertino. His is the only voice we hear in this first zoneof Cocytus, the prime reason to believe that it was he who spoke at vv. 19–21.Having warned Dante to be careful as he began walking, lest he kick theinseparate heads of the two brothers, he now identifies them for Dante.Alessandro and Napoleone degli Alberti, counts of Mangona, were also “neighbors”of Dante’s, living in the countryside near Prato. While little is known of them,they apparently killed one another in the 1280s as the result of a dispute overtheir inheritance from their father.Also here, says Camicione, is Mordred (vv. 61–62), who killed King Arthur andwas slain by him, as recounted in the Old French Morte d’Arthur. The blow ofArthur’s lance left a hole clear through Mordred’s body so that a ray ofsunlight passed through it—and thus through his shadow as well. And Focaccia ishere (v. 63). That was the nickname (see Aher.1982.2) of Vanni dei Cancellieriof Pistoia, a White Guelph reputed by various commentators to have murderedvarious of his relatives, most probably at least his cousin Detto, a member ofthe Black Guelphs, ca. 1286. Also present is Sassol Mascheroni (vv. 63–66),another Florentine who murdered a relative in a quarrel over an inheritance.After he identifies himself, Camicione says that his relative, Carlino, willcommit a still greater sin, betraying a White stronghold in the Val d’Arno toBlack forces for money—a sin fit for the next zone, Antenora, where politicaltreachery is punished, thus making (in his own eyes, at least) Camicione’s sinseem less offensive.Carlino’s treachery and death took place only in 1302; therefore, Camicione isusing the power of the damned to see into the future, of which we were told inInferno X.100–108. The staging of a future damnation just here perhaps hasconsequence for Francesca’s projected damnation of her husband in 1304 toprecisely this circle and zone: Gianciotto is headed here, according to her(Inf. V.107). Since Dante uses this occasion precisely to predict the latercoming of a damned soul currently still alive, we may be reminded of Francesca’ssimilar prediction. And we sense how easy it would have been for Dante to havehad Camicione, guilty of the same sin as Gianciotto, tell of his future presencein Caïna, thus “guaranteeing” Francesca’s prediction. And he, like Francesca inthis, tries to exculpate himself to some degree by insisting that the person herefers to is more guilty than he is, and will be punished still lower down inhell. [return to English [part0016.html#c32-s18-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c32-s18-i]]70–72. [part0016.html#c32-s24-e] We have crossed a border without knowing it.The ice of Cocytus is not marked, as were the Malebolge, with clear delineatorsthat separate one sin from another. This difference may result from Dante’ssense of the essential commonality of all sins treacherous in nature, so utterlydebased (they are referred to as “matta bestialitade” in Inf. XI.82–83).The four areas of Cocytus make concentric circles, each lower in the ice thanthe last, as we move toward the center. We understand that we have reached a newzone only because the faces of the damned look straight out at us (and are notbent down, as they were in Caïna). This zone is named after Antenor, the Trojanwho, a grandson of Priam, in the non-Virgilian versions of the story of theTrojan War, urged that Helen be given back to Menelaus. After Paris refused togive her back, Antenor, in such sources as Dictys Cretensis, is responsible forbetraying the city to the Greeks. He escaped from the city and founded Padua(see Purg. V.75).

The language is such thatanswering is not easy. Was the blow the result of will (his own) or fate(destiny, as determined by God) or chance (mere accident, a thing of noconsequence to the Divine Mind)? These three alternatives offer a range ofgenuine and separate possibilities, which is not true for all the hypothesesthat one may consult in the commentary tradition. As Bosco/Reggio argue, thatDante kicks the head hard makes it difficult to believe that his will was notinvolved. [return to English [part0016.html#c32-s25-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c32-s25-i]]79–81. [part0016.html#c32-s27-e] The victim of Dante’s kick, we will learn atv. 106, is Bocca degli Abati. Bocca’s betrayal occurred on the battlefield atMontaperti (1260) when he, a member of the Florentine Guelph army, cut off thearm of the standard-bearer at the height of the battle. The ensuing disastrousdefeat of the Guelphs at the hands of the Ghibellines was sometimes laid at hisdoor, as it is here by Dante. [return to English [part0016.html#c32-s27-e] /Italian [part0023.html#c32-s27-i]]82–85. [part0016.html#c32-s28-e] The protagonist thinks he knows that thismight well be Bocca, and gets Virgil’s permission to question him. We recall howstern Virgil was in his rebuke of Dante for listening to the “tenzone” betweenMaster Adam and Sinon in Canto XXX.131–132. Here he stands complacently to oneside as Dante gets involved in a fairly violent “tenzone” himself. But now, onemight argue, he is actively engaged in remonstrating with a wrongdoer and thushas Virgil’s full support. [return to English [part0016.html#c32-s28-e] /Italian [part0023.html#c32-s28-i]]87–112. [part0016.html#c32-s29-e] This “tenzone” is in five parts. (1) Dantebegins it with a rebuke for Bocca’s bad manners (a sinner in the depth of hellshould treat mortal special visitors better than he has done); Bocca answerswith continuing complaint. (2) Dante offers fame—for a price; Bocca answersrudely. (3) Dante moves to a threat of physical assault; Bocca defies him. (4)Dante begins pulling out Bocca’s hair; Bocca “barks,” thus moving another sinnerthere present to name him (he is answering in Bocca’s place, as it were). (5)Dante rejoices in his victory over Bocca; Bocca remains sullen.The Italian at v. 90 is, in itself, ambivalent. Because of the conjugation ofthe imperfect subjunctive, “se fossi vivo” can either mean “were I alive” or“were you alive.” Since Bocca, like Camicione (if he is the speaker of vv.19–21), seems to be able to tell that Dante is in the flesh, e.g., from thesound of his footfall on the ice, from the force of his kick, it would make nosense for him to doubt Dante’s presence as a living being. Further, Dante’sresponse would seem to follow better if Bocca’s words are understood as meaning,“were I alive.” Our translation runs accordingly. (There are those who disputethis reading.)At vv. 103–105 Dante is playfully citing his own vengeful and sexually chargeddesire to pull the hair of the “stony lady” in one of his Rime petrose, “Cosìnel mio parlar,” vv. 66–73. For the most recent discussion see Pasquini(Pasq.1999.1), pp. 31–33, noting as well various other resonances of the “stonyrhymes” in this canto. See also the study of Durling and Martinez (Durl.1990.1)for a wider view. [return to English [part0016.html#c32-s29-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c32-s29-i]]113–123. [part0016.html#c32-s38-e] Bocca’s revenge for his “betrayal” by Buosoda Duera is to reveal the names of others in Antenora so that they may join himin infamy as a result of Dante’s eventual report to the living, the first ofthese, naturally, being Buoso himself (vv. 114–117). Buoso was a Ghibelline (heis “paired” with the Guelph Bocca) who, entrusted by Manfred’s high command tohold the high passes near Parma against the invading army of Charles of Anjou in1265, apparently accepted a bribe in order to let the Guelph forces reach Parmawithout a fight.Tesauro de’ Beccheria (vv. 119–120), abbot of Vallombrosa, a Ghibelline, wasaccused of treacherously assisting the Florentine Ghibellines, banned from thecity in 1258, to reenter Florence. He was beheaded for betraying the city.Gianni de’ Soldanieri (v. 121), also a Ghibelline, joined the popular uprisingagainst the Ghibelline leaders of Florence just after the defeat and death ofthe great Ghibelline leader, Manfred, at Benevento in 1266. He thus was seen asbetraying his own party.Ganelon (v. 122) treacherously betrayed Charlemagne’s rear guard at Roncesvallesin 778. See Inferno XXXI.16–18.Tebaldello Zambrasi of Faenza (v. 122), also a Ghibelline, betrayed his fellowGhibellines of Bologna who, having been exiled, had taken refuge in Faenza. In1280 Tebaldello opened a gate of his city, just before dawn, to a war party ofBolognese Guelphs so that they might avenge themselves upon their fellowcitizens. Tebaldello himself died in 1282 in another battle. [return to English[part0016.html#c32-s38-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c32-s38-i]]124–125. [part0016.html#c32-s42-e] A sudden change in the protagonist’sattention reveals the pair of sinners whom we will shortly know as Ugolino andRuggieri (vv. 13–14 of the next canto), the one with his head above the other’s.[return to English [part0016.html#c32-s42-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c32-s42-i]]127–132. [part0016.html#c32-s43-e] Again Dante blends an unadorned “ordinary”scene (a hungry man wolfing down a loaf of bread) with classical material (apassage from Statius’s Thebaid VIII.751–762) in a double simile. The moment inStatius describes Tydeus, dying in battle, asking his men to cut off for him thehead of Melanippus, whom he had just slain, but who had first given him his ownmortal blow. They do so (Capaneus [Inf. XIV] is the one who carries the body tohim). With savage joy Tydeus, dying, chews upon the head of the man who hadkilled him.

[part0016.html#c32-s45-e] For the “bestial sign” as reflecting the wordsof St. Paul, see Freccero’s essay, “Bestial Sign and Bread of Angels”(Frec.1986.1), p. 160: “But if you bite one another, take heed or you will beconsumed by one another” (Galatians 5:15). The cannibalistic scene before ushere introduces the concerns with starvation that will be so prominent in thefirst half of the next canto. [return to English [part0016.html#c32-s45-e] /Italian [part0023.html#c32-s45-i]]135–139. [part0016.html#c32-s45-e] Dante offers to present to the world thissinner’s case (so that it may judge whether or not his wrath is justified) if hewill but reveal his name and the offense committed by the other sinner. Dantefulfills this promise in the following canto, and the world—or at least theDantean part of it—has been arguing about that case ever since.There is also a dispute over the exact meaning of the last line of Dante’s oath.A number of understandings have been offered: “as long as I do not die first”(the choice of many of the early commentators); “as long as my tongue does notfail me” (also popular among the early commentators); “if this cold [of Cocytus]does not wither it” (only Torraca and Pietrobono; probably not worth seriousconsideration); “if my words do not die” (Grabher and Fallani); “if it does notbecome paralyzed” (Steiner and quite a few modern commentators). It seems clearthat Dante, in this vernacular and pithy oath, swears on his life that he willcarry out his promise. Tozer (1901) paraphrases adequately: “If I live torecount it.” Recently Guglielmo Gorni has tried an entirely new tack: “if myFlorentine vernacular survives” (Gorn.1996.1), but this seems more venturesomethan necessary.When we finish reading this canto we may reflect on the singular fact that, forthe first time since he entered the poem in its sixty-seventh verse, Virgil hasnot spoken in an entire canto. See note to Inferno XXX.37–41. [return to English[part0016.html#c32-s45-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c32-s45-i]]INFERNO XXXIII [part0016.html#c33-e]1–3. [part0016.html#c33-s01-e] The complications of political intrigue liebehind the story that we are about to hear. For a review, in English, seeSingleton’s commentary to vv. 17–18. The main particulars are as follows. CountUgolino della Gherardesca (ca. 1220–89) was of a Ghibelline family of Pisa. In1275 he joined with the Guelph Visconti family in order to advance his ownpolitical ambitions, but failed to do so when his plans became known and he wasbanished. He returned to Pisa and now joined with the Archbishop, Ruggieri degliUbaldini (grandson of Ottaviano degli Ubaldini [see Inf. X.120]), a Ghibelline,and conspired with him against Judge Nino Visconti, a Guelph, and, in Dante’seyes, a good man (we see him, on his way to salvation, in Purg. VIII.53). In1288, Ugolino and Ruggieri managed to force Nino to leave the city, thusallowing them a free hand. At this point, however, Ruggieri decided to be rid ofUgolino, and had him accused of “betraying” Pisa by giving some of its outlyingcastles to the Florentines and the Lucchesi (he had in fact been trying tonegotiate a political advantage to Pisa in these dealings). With that as anexcuse, Ruggieri had Ugolino imprisoned in the summer of 1288, along with twosons and two grandsons (Dante has made the tale more pathetic by making all fourof the children young—but Ugolino was in his sixties when the five of them wereimprisoned). They were starved to death in February 1289.Ugolino is found in Antenora, and thus was a betrayer of party or country. Inwhat did his sin consist? Dante refers to the “betrayal” involving the castlesin v. 86, but seems to think this was only an accusation. However, his realtreacherous behavior, in Dante’s eyes, may have involved either his betrayal ofhis own Ghibelline party, or of the good forces in Pisa itself in hisdouble-dealing with Judge Nino, who also happened to be his grandson.Almost all admire the horror of this scene, Ugolino lifting his gore-stainedmouth from Ruggieri’s neck, then wiping it on the hair of his enemy’s head. Wemay reflect that Ugolino is moved to cease his vengeful chewing by his hope forfurther, greater vengeance: Dante’s recounting of his case against Ruggieri inthe world above. [return to English [part0016.html#c33-s01-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c33-s01-i]]4–6. [part0016.html#c33-s02-e] Ugolino’s first words are nearly universallyobserved to be a citation of the opening of Aeneas’s sad speech to Dido inAeneid II.3–8, a passage also nearly universally cited for the beginning ofFrancesca’s second speech to Dante (Inf. V.121–123). Why the repetition?Hollander (Holl.1984.5), p. 550, suggests that it represents a sort of test forthe reader, who now hears another “sympathetic sinner” trying to capture thegoodwill of the protagonist (and, indeed, of the reader) and is supposed torealize that this refrain has been heard before, similarly put to the service ofexculpating a sinner by that very sinner.For a second Virgilian resonance here see Aeneid I.209, where Aeneas hides thegrief in his heart from his companions (“premit altum corde dolorem”); the echoof these words (“che ’l cor mi preme”) was noted by Tommaseo, who observes thediffering contexts. [return to English [part0016.html#c33-s02-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c33-s02-i]]8. [part0016.html#c33-s03-e] The phrasing of Ugolino’s hoped-for fruition ofinfamy for Ruggieri possibly reflects the language of the parable of the sower(Luke 8:4–11), where Jesus interprets the seed as the word of God. Durling andMartinez (Durl.1996.1), p. 531, suggest the importance, for the images offruition used both by Ugolino and Alberigo, of Matthew 7:20, “by their fruitsyou shall know them.” [return to English [part0016.html#c33-s03-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c33-s03-i]]9. [part0016.html#c33-s03-e] Both Francesca (Inf. V.126) and Ugolino weep andspeak simultaneously, each of them in imitation of Aeneas’s imagined hardenedsoldier, who would have to speak through tears if he had the fall of Troy tonarrate (Aen. II.6–8). And both Francesca and Ugolino are accompanied by acompanion who does not speak in Dante’s presence. [return to English[part0016.html#c33-s03-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c33-s03-i]]11–12. [part0016.html#c33-s04-e] Like Farinata (Inf. X.25), Ugolino realizesthat Dante is Florentine from his speech. [return to English[part0016.html#c33-s04-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c33-s04-i]]20–21. [part0016.html#c33-s07-e] The story of Ugolino’s imprisonment and deathwas familiar to all who lived in Tuscany. What Dante could not have known,Ugolino says, was how much he had suffered. The way in which he says this, onthe other hand, indicates the sort of egotism that we will experience allthrough his speech. Here is a man who has experienced death in the company ofhis children; we do not even hear of them at first, since his attention is fixedentirely on himself. See Holl.1984.5, p. 551.

[part0016.html#c33-s08-e] The tower (the edifice remains, without itstower, in the Piazza dei Cavalieri in Pisa to this day) would not serve asprison many years into the fourteenth century, but it apparently still did sowhen Dante wrote these lines.

[part0016.html#c33-s10-e] Ugolino’s dream turns out to have beencompletely accurate: Ruggieri, out hunting on Mount San Giuliano, is afterUgolino (the wolf) and his children (the cubs). He has set, ahead of the chase,the waiting ambushers, the Ghibelline leaders of Pisa, and with his hounds he isdriving his victims toward them and to their destruction.For the canine imagery in Cocytus and especially in this canto, see Brugnoli(Brug.1989.1).

[part0016.html#c33-s13-e] Ugolino awakes from the dream to find itsreality before his eyes, his children hungry in their sleep and crying for theirdaily bread, usually brought them in the morning (see vv. 43–44). [return toEnglish [part0016.html#c33-s13-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c33-s13-i]]40–42. [part0016.html#c33-s14-e] Ugolino is angered by the fact that Dante isnot weeping. The protagonist, unlike most readers, has evidently found a moralvantage point from which there seems something wrong with this narration. Sincewe have seen him weep for other apparently less sympathetic figures, his lack ofcompassion might serve as a clue to us about our own reactions.In this canto, vv. 5–75, words for weeping and grief (piangere, lagrimare,doglia, dolere, dolore, and doloroso) occur a total of thirteen times (seeHoll.1969.1, p. 306). And see Vittorio Russo (Russ.1966.1) for a wider study ofthis phenomenon. [return to English [part0016.html#c33-s14-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c33-s14-i]]45. [part0016.html#c33-s15-e] Apparently the children have had a dream similarto their father’s. The process of the starvation of Ugolino and his childrenroughly coincided with the Lenten season. [return to English[part0016.html#c33-s15-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c33-s15-i]]46–48. [part0016.html#c33-s16-e] Ugolino’s dream now has a finer point. Heunderstands at once that they are to die, caught by the hunter Ruggieri and hismen. His first impulse, which will be repeated, is to keep silent. [return toEnglish [part0016.html#c33-s16-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c33-s16-i]]49. [part0016.html#c33-s17-e] Ugolino, who has just criticized Dante for beingcruel because he does not weep, now tells the protagonist that he himself didnot weep when he perceived the fate of his sons and of himself. Indeed, heturned to stone. For Hollander (Holl.1984.5), pp. 552–55, the key passage thatstands behind this scene is found in Luke’s Gospel, 11:5–13, Christ’s parable ofthe importunate friend. A man is visited by a friend at midnight and goes to thehouse of another friend to seek bread in order to feed his guest. The importunedfriend replies, “Trouble me not, the door is now shut, and my children are withme in bed; I cannot rise and give you.” Christ comments on the parable,insisting that importuning will eventually work: “If a son shall ask for breadof any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?” The various detailsof the parable, in a form that is both parallel and antithetic to the actionrecounted here, find their place in Ugolino’s narrative: the knocking on thedoor echoed in the hammer blows nailing up the prison, the man in bed with hischildren behind a locked door, and the father who will not give his son a stonewhen he asks for bread. Ugolino, however, gives his sons exactly that, a stonysilence. When we ask ourselves what we would do in that situation, we probablyknow. We would speak, not be silent (see Botterill [Bott.1988.2], p. 287); wewould weep with our children, not show stoic reserve; and, if we werethirteenth-century Italians, we would pray with them after having sought theirforgiveness for having involved them, innocent, in our political machinations.The opening passage of Luke 11 has a prayer for us, should we require one, forit is in that text that Jesus teaches his disciples what we know as “the Lord’sprayer.” [return to English [part0016.html#c33-s17-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c33-s17-i]]58–63. [part0016.html#c33-s20-e] Ugolino, silent, biting his hands from grief,causes the children to think that he is hungry and they offer themselves to himfor food. They, like their father, can only think literally about nourishment,forgetting the symbolic eucharistic value of bread. (Freccero [Frec.1986.1], pp.156–57, believes that their offer is eucharistic and spiritually motivated.)This is the last conversation among them. [return to English[part0016.html#c33-s20-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c33-s20-i]]64–69. [part0016.html#c33-s22-e] The father, thinking that display of his ownsorrow will only increase the pain felt by his sons, teaches them his lesson:stoic silence in the face of death. Had Seneca written this canto, perhaps wewould be justified in thinking Ugolino’s reserve a valuable example of courage.The silence is only broken once more, on this fourth day, by Gaddo, dying, whoasks the question the reader, too, might very well ask: “O father, why won’t youhelp me?” The drama of paternity that we find in this canto is not thatproposed, in his beautiful essay, by Francesco De Sanctis (DeSa.1967.1), butthat of a terribly failing father.The total absence of religious concerns in Dante’s portrait of Ugolino is incontrast to the tale that circulates in some of the commentaries, first in 1333in the Ottimo Commento, that Ugolino, realizing they were all to die, asked fora friar to confess them, and was refused. Had Dante included such a detail, hisUgolino would have seemed a much different man. [return to English[part0016.html#c33-s22-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c33-s22-i]]74. [part0016.html#c33-s25-e] Only now that it is too late does Ugolino breakthe silence with his cries. It is the last heartbreaking detail of his failureas a father. The tale that he tells to win Dante’s sympathy has also failed, aswe shall see. [return to English [part0016.html#c33-s25-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c33-s25-i]]75. [part0016.html#c33-s25-e] Did Ugolino ingest his children? For a history ofthe centuries-long debate see Hollander (Holl.1985.2). For a strong argument infavor of the notion, see Herzman (Herz.1980.1). To most, the positionrepresented by Herzman and others, mainly (in recent years) Americans, seems anot convincing interpretation. In Singleton’s opinion, it is a “curious view,”one “hardly worth a serious rebuttal.” This writer stands with GeoffreyChaucer’s view of the matter in the Monk’s Tale, v. 2455: “Hymself, despeired,eek for hunger starf” (and he, despairing, also [i.e., as the children had] diedfrom hunger). One wishes that Chaucer had used a term for starvation, but thatmight not have rhymed or scanned. “Digiuno” (fasting) is not the same thing as“hunger.” And surely Chaucer knew that.An observation in the commentary of Guido da Pisa also offers evidence that thenumber of days in the narrative (seven) is significant in this regard. Guidosays, “And lest it seem impossible that one could have lived six days withoutfood, heed Macrobius on the Dream of Scipio. He says that the life of a mancannot last beyond seven days without food.” If Dante, with his so carefullycalculated seven days to starvation, is aware of this bit of medical lore,Ugolino died at the limit of human endurance without nourishment. Had heingested the flesh of his children, he would have lived longer. Further, whenthe corpses were exhibited outside the tower, after their removal, the scandalof the teeth-torn flesh would have made the rounds. No such story did, with theexception of a variant, somewhat suspect, in the text of the commentary ofJacopo della Lana. See Holl.1985.2, n. 24.

[part0016.html#c33-s26-e] His tale told, Ugolino resumes his bestialrage against the cause of his woes, the skull of Ruggieri, whose evil plotsbested Ugolino’s own machinations. For the view that Ugolino hides his ownculpability behind that of others, see Barberi Squarotti (Barb.1972.2). [returnto English [part0016.html#c33-s26-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c33-s26-i]]79–90. [part0016.html#c33-s27-e] Romantic readers, who admire Ugolino, do notoften read past verse 75 with close attention. Dante’s apostrophe of Pisa, “newThebes,” blames the city, not for killing Ugolino, which it had a reason to do(if not perhaps a correct one), but for killing the children. All of Dante’ssympathy is lodged with the children, none with Ugolino. And here we are notspeaking of the protagonist (who was firm enough himself against Ugolino’sentreaties for pity), but of the author.In Dve (I.viii.2–5) Dante had divided Europeans into three large linguisticgroups, Provençal, French, and Italian, by their respective ways of saying“yes,” oc, oïl, and sì. He thus, at vv. 79–80, refers to the inhabitants ofItaly.Capraia and Gorgona are islands in the Mediterranean that then belonged to Pisa.[return to English [part0016.html#c33-s27-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c33-s27-i]]91–93. [part0016.html#c33-s31-e] The transition to Ptolomea is as abrupt asthat to Antenora had been (Inf. XXXII.70). And once again the determining detailis the positioning of the faces of those punished in the area. These now havetheir faces turned upwards (where those in Antenora looked straight ahead andthose in Caïna had their faces tilted downward).Most commentators believe that Ptolomea, where treachery to guests and friendsis punished, gets its name from Ptolemy, the captain of Jericho who, as recordedin I Maccabees 16:11–17, invited his father-in-law, Simon Maccabeus, and his twosons to a banquet and then, once they had drunk, slew them. (There is disputeabout the matter, some proposing Ptolemy XII, king of Egypt, 51–47 B.C., whomurdered Pompey as a favor to Julius Caesar [Lucan, Phars.

[part0016.html#c33-s36-e] Pietro di Dante suggests that the windemanating from Satan, to which Virgil alludes gingerly, not wanting to alarmDante unduly (cf. his behavior as they approached the giants in Inf.XXXI.29–33), is a perverse imitation of the breath of the Holy Spirit referredto in Acts 2:3.

[part0016.html#c33-s37-e] The only speaking presence in Ptolomea(identified as Fra Alberigo in v. 118) believes that Dante and Virgil aresinners destined for Judecca, the “lowest station” in Inferno. In Antenora thesouls seemed to be able to tell that Dante was alive; here, perhaps because oftheir greater physical discomfort and icebound blindness, their sensorycapacities seem more limited than those of the souls above them.

[part0016.html#c33-s39-e] Dante’s “agreement” with Alberigo is utterlycynical; he has no intention of helping this sinner in any way, and says what hesays only to get the sinner to disclose himself, swearing a misleading oath inorder to reassure him (of course he is going to the “bottom of the ice,” but notas a sinner for his eternal punishment, but as a very privileged visitor).[return to English [part0016.html#c33-s39-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c33-s39-i]]118–120. [part0016.html#c33-s40-e] A member of the Jovial Friars (see note toInf. XXIII.103), Alberigo was a Guelph from Faenza, and, in 1285, invited two ofhis relatives, with one of whom he had had a dispute, to dinner. When he calledout for the fruit course, the prearranged signal, hired assassins rushed intothe room and killed his guests. Now, he says, he is having a fruit course of hisown, in which he is getting more (and worse) than he gave, date for fig (since,in Dante’s day, dates were more expensive than figs).

[part0016.html#c33-s41-e] Here, in answer to the protagonist’squestion, based in his surprise at finding him here, since he had not heard thathe had died, Alberigo reveals the poet’s extraordinary innovation. Those whohave broken the guest laws die in their souls as soon as they do so, so thattheir souls go to hell, leaving their bodies alive on earth. As early as Pietrodi Dante, some commentators have pointed to a possible source in John 13:27,where it is said that, shortly after Judas betrayed Jesus at the Last Supper,Satan entered into Judas.Atropos (v. 126) is the third of the three Fates (Clotho spins the fabric forthe skein of our lives, Lachesis lets it out from her distaff, and Atropos snipsit off at our deaths).

[part0016.html#c33-s45-e] To prove his point, Alberigo points outsomeone he believes Dante might know taking his “winter vacation” here inPtolomea, Branca d’Oria. He was a Ghibelline nobleman of Genoa who, with thehelp of another family member, treacherously murdered his father-in-law, MichelZanche (see Inf. XXII.88), around 1294. Thus his soul has been down here for sixyears, while his body is still eating, drinking, sleeping, and putting onclothes, as Dante insists. History contrived to make Dante’s fiction all themore amusing. Branca, who was born ca. 1233, lived into his nineties, only dyingin 1325, thus outliving his condemner, Dante. Perhaps he had the great pleasureof reading about his “wintering” soul as he enjoyed his life in Genoa. [returnto English [part0016.html#c33-s45-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c33-s45-i]]148–150. [part0016.html#c33-s50-e] For the third time Alberigo asks Dante toclear the ice from his eyes, and now Dante, having what he wanted from him,simply does not do so. There are those who argue that the protagonist herebehaves more like a sinner than a Christian, but by now we should be used to hisapproved form of righteous indignation. And there is no reproof for suchbehavior from Virgil here. [return to English [part0016.html#c33-s50-e] /Italian [part0023.html#c33-s50-i]]151–157. [part0016.html#c33-s51-e] Matching the apostrophe attacking Pisa thatended the first part of the canto (vv. 79–90), this one of Genoa concludes thevisit to Ptolomea, one of the shortest episodes in the Inferno.

[part0016.html#c34-s01-e] The first verse of the last canto of Inferno (likethe first verse of the last canto of Purgatorio) is in Latin. Its first threewords are identical to the first verse of a hymn of the True Cross composed byVenantius Fortunatus (sixth century) but the last, obviously, has been added byDante. Satan, still in the distance, is naturally not “advancing” against Danteand Virgil, but the wind he emits might have made it seem that way as theyapproach him. Satan, as we shall see, is immobile.This is the only complete Latin verse in the cantica, but see seven earlierLatin words or phrases: Inferno I.65; I.70; XV.62; XVI.88; XVIII.6; XXI.42;XXVII.72. [return to English [part0016.html#c34-s01-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s01-i]]4–7. [part0016.html#c34-s02-e] “The Satanic mills” of William Blake may notreflect this passage, even as much as Blake read Dante, yet Dante’s simileimmediately presents Satan as a vast contraption doing its necessary work in thearchitect’s plan for this infernal city. We reflect that this was once thefairest of angels, now reduced, despite his awesome size, to mindless iterationof his wings. Joan Ferrante speaks of “Lucifer, who emits no sound but sendsforth a silent and freezing wind of hate, a parody perhaps of the love-inspiringtongues of flame brought to the Apostles by the Holy Spirit” (Ferr.1969.1), p.38. [return to English [part0016.html#c34-s02-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s02-i]]8–9. [part0016.html#c34-s03-e] Commentators occasionally remark that Dante hashere forgotten the fact that insubstantial Virgil, a shade, would give Dante noshelter at all. The “rules” of the poem overrule the “rules” of even his ownphysics if and when he chooses. For example, Virgil picks Dante up and carrieshim at Inferno XIX.124–125 and XXIII.37. See note to Inferno VI.34–36. [returnto English [part0016.html#c34-s03-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c34-s03-i]]10. [part0016.html#c34-s04-e] Since Tommaseo, in 1837, commentators have cited,for this verse, Aeneas’s words as he tells the story of Laocoön (Aen. II.204):“horresco referens” (I shudder merely to tell it). In the Aeneid two serpentsare moving toward the priest to kill him; here, the Serpent is being approachedby Virgil and Dante. The differing context is eventually reassuring, but theprotagonist is, for the last time in this cantica, filled with fear. [return toEnglish [part0016.html#c34-s04-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c34-s04-i]]11–12. [part0016.html#c34-s04-e] For the third time in Cocytus the fact that wehave crossed a boundary is made clear only by the fact that sinners are nowpunished in a different posture. This last realm is named, of course, for Judas,who betrayed his rightful Lord, Jesus Christ. [return to English[part0016.html#c34-s04-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c34-s04-i]]13–15. [part0016.html#c34-s05-e] The sinners here are frozen inside the ice, asthough tossed into it helter-skelter before it froze and now stuck in theirvarious postures eternally, like straw caught in molten glass in the artisan’sshop and now fastened in that glass, a lasting imperfection in it. Theirpostures are horizontal (whether facedown or supine we cannot tell—perhapsboth), vertical (both head-up and head-down), or bent in two. We eventuallyrealize that in this zone we will not learn the identity of any of thesesinners, a situation that may remind us of the anonymity that was insisted onfor the neutrals in Inferno III.49–51. All of our attention is saved for Luciferand the three special betrayers who are punished in his mouth. [return toEnglish [part0016.html#c34-s05-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c34-s05-i]]20–21. [part0016.html#c34-s07-e] Virgil uses the classical name for the king ofhell, as he has once before (Inf. XI.65), and as he did in his own poem (e.g.,Aen. VI.269). This is the last time that we will hear that name, as we areshortly to leave his “kingdom.” The phrase “Ecco Dite” here surely echoes thephrase used of Jesus, before he is sentenced to death, “Ecce homo.” See note toInferno XVII.1–3. [return to English [part0016.html#c34-s07-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s07-i]]22–27. [part0016.html#c34-s08-e] The last verse of this seventh and lastaddress to the reader in Inferno is treated by most commentators as atriviality, i.e., Dante assures the reader that he was indeed half-dead (as hehas already said). See, for example, the comment found in Bosco/Reggio: “Theexpression simply translates … that simple and banal phrase … in Italian, mezzomorto [half dead].” Does Dante need to ask us to exercise our wits, if we havethese, in order to understand that? The portentousness of his declaration thathe cannot write what he became because words would fail him cannot be squaredwith such an interpretation, words for which would fail no one. Few, however,have come forward with more vital readings. Gregorio Di Siena, in hiscommentary, quotes Torricelli, who says that at this moment Dante is passingfrom the state of death to the state of living in God’s forgiveness. ErnestoTrucchi, who bridles at the terribly uninteresting readings put forward byprevious commentators, claims that this is the moment in which, in theprotagonist, the fear of hell becomes the fear of God. More recently, Durlingand Martinez propose (Durl.1996.1, p. 544) the following: “This moment is theculmination of the penitential imitation of Christ in the descent into hell,symbolically the pilgrim’s death to sin, that is, the death of the ‘old man,’leading to the reversal of direction from descent to ascent.” They give creditto Freccero’s essay “The Sign of Satan” (Frec.1986.1), pp. 167–79. Whether weaccept their interpretation or not, it does seem that they, and very few others,have responded with the kind of attention that the passage obviously calls for.[return to English [part0016.html#c34-s08-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s08-i]]30–31. [part0016.html#c34-s10-e] That is, “I am, proportionally, closer in sizeto a giant than a giant is to Lucifer.” For the size of the giants, ca. seventyfeet, see the note to Inferno XXXI.58–66. Let us, merely for purposes ofcalculation, agree that Dante was six feet tall. The equation is simple: 6/70 =70/x; x = 817. Since a body is roughly 2.5 times an arm’s length, Satan is some2000 feet tall and thus looms, from the waist up, over the ice by some 1000feet. [return to English [part0016.html#c34-s10-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s10-i]]35. [part0016.html#c34-s12-e] Satan, once of the highest order of angels, theSeraphim, has come a long way down. It is worth noting that the only othersinner in hell referred to as raising his brows is prideful Farinata (Inf.X.45). [return to English [part0016.html#c34-s12-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s12-i]]37–38. [part0016.html#c34-s13-e] The “wonder” that is Satan even now reminds usof his divine origin. As many have noted, he stands before us as a parodicversion of Christ crucified, even to his physical resemblance to the scene onGolgotha, in which Christ was upon a cross between two thieves. For arepresentation of the three-headed Satan known to Dante from the mosaic on theceiling of the Baptistry in Florence see Bosco/Reggio’s commentary.

Almost all the early commentators equate them with the opposites ofthe three attributes of the trinitarian God, Love, Power, and Knowledge. Theyassociate red with anger, thus hatred (or impotence), yellowish white withimpotence (or hatred), and black with ignorance. As many note, these are notparticularly convincing schemes, if their overall applicability seemsacceptable. [return to English [part0016.html#c34-s13-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s13-i]]46–51. [part0016.html#c34-s16-e] The six wings of Satan are his six wings asone of the angelic order of Seraphim (Isaiah 6:2); they are now not glorious incolor but the wings of a giant bat. Their resemblance to sails on a great shipis parodic, since Satan proceeds nowhere, but connects with images associatedwith Ulysses (Inf. XXVI) and the ship bringing the saved souls to the shore ofpurgatory (Purg. I). [return to English [part0016.html#c34-s16-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s16-i]]53–57. [part0016.html#c34-s18-e] Guido da Pisa associates Satan’s tears andmastication with a biblical text (Matth. 8:12), Jesus’ words to the centurionconcerning those who fail to believe: “and there shall be weeping and gnashingof teeth.” [return to English [part0016.html#c34-s18-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s18-i]]61–67. [part0016.html#c34-s21-e] The three most gravely punished sinners of thepoem are Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus (founder of the Church), as well asBrutus and Cassius, who betrayed Julius Caesar (the first ruler of the empire).Judas is tortured more severely, his back flayed (see vv. 58–60) as wasChrist’s, on the way to Golgotha, bearing the cross. Nonetheless, Brutus andCassius, those stalwarts of the Roman Republic, which Dante honored so notably(see Holl.1986.1), are not treated a great deal better. When we consider thatanother “conspirator” against Julius, Cato the Younger, is found saved in thenext canto (Purg. I), we must surely be puzzled. For Dante, despite hispredominant hostility to him as a man (see Stul.1991.1, pp. 33–43), Julius wasnonetheless the first emperor of Rome, and thus served a divinely-ordainedpurpose. For this reason, Brutus and Cassius are seen as betrayers of theirrightful lord. [return to English [part0016.html#c34-s21-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s21-i]]68–69. [part0016.html#c34-s23-e] It is now nightfall of the Saturday of Easterweekend; the journey to this point has lasted precisely twenty-four hours. Wehave also reached the border of the midpoint of this canto, verse 69 of 139. Thenext verse begins the action that will encompass another twenty-four-hourperiod, seventy verses that will extend through exactly as many hours as havebeen consumed by the journey up to now.

[part0016.html#c34-s24-e] When Satan opens his wings, Virgil, with Danteholding on to him, seizes the moment to grasp the animal-like flank of “theBeast.” [return to English [part0016.html#c34-s24-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s24-i]]76–84. [part0016.html#c34-s26-e] At the very center of the universe evenVirgil, a shade, feels the pull of gravity as he tries to move back up towardthe light.The locution describing Virgil’s changed direction, “ov’ elli avea le zanche”(where he had his shanks), has caused debate, some believing that the “he”refers to Virgil himself, i.e., turned his head to where his legs had been;others, that he turned his head to where Satan’s leg were. Our translationfollows Hatcher and Musa, who opt for Satan’s legs (Hatc.1964.1 andHatc.1966.1), pointing out, among other things, that Dante’s insertion of thepronoun “elli” before the verb “avea” makes it almost necessary to draw thisconclusion, since he never else inserts a pronoun into a sequence of verbswithout introducing a new subject of the verb; that is, if the line read“[Virgilio] volse la testa ov’ avea le zanche,” Virgil would clearly be theimplied subject of the second verb. According to Hatcher and Musa, the “elli”all but removes that possibility.Since Dante doesn’t understand (see vv. 90–93) that he has reached the center ofthe universe and is being moved back upward toward the surface of the earth atthe antipodes, he assumes that Virgil is going back up toward the ice ofCocytus. [return to English [part0016.html#c34-s26-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s26-i]]94–96. [part0016.html#c34-s32-e] It is now 7:30 AM (midway between 6:00 and9:00, the first “tierce,” or three-hour period, into four of which the solar daywas divided (6–9; 9–noon; noon-3; 3–6). Since moments ago (v. 68) we had learnedthat it was 6 PM in Jerusalem, how can this be? For the first time in the poemVirgil tells time by the sun, and not the moon; and he tells it by the positionof the sun in purgatory, twelve hours ahead of Jerusalem (where it is currently7:30 PM). We are leaving hell behind. [return to English[part0016.html#c34-s32-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c34-s32-i]]97–120. [part0016.html#c34-s33-e] Even though the travelers have to traverse anenormous distance in seventy lines, thirty-nine of them (88–126) are devoted totheir new situation, Dante’s three questions, and Virgil’s responses. Thesetting is a space on the convex side of the ice of Cocytus, i.e., on its farside. The only remaining evidence of the infernal core is offered by the legs ofLucifer, sticking up through the crust of the area that contains the rest ofhim. We are on the other side of the ice, and there is nothing more by way ofconstructed space to catch our eye.Dante wants to know why he no longer sees the ice, why Lucifer is “upside down,”and how it can already be morning. Some of Virgil’s explanations have alreadybeen adverted to. He also explains that they are now under the southernhemisphere of the world above, not the northern, where Christ was put to deathand whence they had begun their descent. [return to English[part0016.html#c34-s33-e] / Italian [part0023.html#c34-s33-i]]121–126. [part0016.html#c34-s41-e] Virgil’s final words in Inferno create, asit were, the foundation myth of sin: how it established itself in the world thatGod had made good. Forti (Fort.1986.1), p. 246, refers to the passage as a“genuine cosmological myth,” to the fall of Lucifer as “the first event thatoccurs in time” (p. 259).It is worth considering a similar passage in Ovid (Metam. I.151–162): Astraea,or justice, has just left the earth. The battle of Phlegra ensues (about whichwe have heard in Canto XXXI [44–45, 91–96, 119–121]); once the giants aredestroyed, mother Earth, Gea, forms man in their image, if smaller, out of theirgore. But this new stock, too, is contemptuous of the gods. Soon enough Lycaon(the “wolf-man”) will commit the first murder, one that will eventually lead tothe murder of Julius Caesar (v. 201).Here, in the final moments of the final canto, we learn of the first things tooccur in terrestrial time: Satan fell from heaven and crashed into our earth(see Par. XXIX.55–57). To flee from him, all the land in the southern hemispherehid beneath the sea and moved to the north of the equator, while the matter thathe displaced in his fall rose up behind him to form the mount of purgatory.Over the years there have been efforts to find contradictions to this view ofthe earth’s “geology” in Dante’s later Questio de aqua et terra (1320). BrunoNardi (Nard.1959.1) made a case for the contradiction. Freccero’s review(Frec.1961.1) offered strong rebuttals to Nardi’s main arguments. Themagisterial edition produced by Mazzoni (Mazz.1979.2) convincingly presents thework as Dantean. Pasquazi (Pasq.1985.1) makes a strong case for the absence ofany significant contradiction. For a study of the wider question see Stabile(Stab.1983.1). [return to English [part0016.html#c34-s41-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s41-i]]127–132. [part0016.html#c34-s43-e] Along a passage in the rock through thespace contained between the floor formed by the convex side of Cocytus and theunderside of the earth above, the travelers follow the sound of a stream. It,many suggest, is the river Lethe, running down into hell filled with the sinsnow forgotten by all who have purged themselves of them (Purg. XXVIII.127–130).[return to English [part0016.html#c34-s43-e] / Italian[part0023.html#c34-s43-i]]133–138. [part0016.html#c34-s45-e] There is no pausing for rest that now seemsa waste of time, given the nearness of the light. Looking through a crevice (theword in Italian is pertugio, the same word used to describe the opening throughwhich Ugolino could see the moon from his cell [Inf. XXXIII.22]) in the earth’ssurface, whence, we assume, comes the little stream that they are following,Dante is able to see a few stars in the firmament above him.

And inthis line both Virgil and Dante actually step out of hell, and now can see thefull expanse of the dawn sky, filled with stars. Both Purgatorio and Paradisowill also end with the word “stars” (stelle), the goals of a human sight that isbeing drawn to God. There is no doubt as to the fact that even Inferno, endingin happiness of this kind, is a comedic part of a comedic whole.

For those interested in the general condition of Dantean bibliography,however, a few remarks may be helpful.Since an extended bibliography for the study of Dante includes tens of thousandsof items, those who deal with the subjects that branch out from the works ofthis writer are condemned to immoderate labor and a sense that they are alwaysmissing something important. While even half a century ago it was possible todevelop, in a single treatment, a fairly thorough compendium of the mostsignificant items (e.g., S. A. Chimenz, Dante, in Letteratura italiana. Imaggiori [Milan: Marzorati, 1954], pp. 85–109), the situation today wouldrequire far more space. Fortunately, the extraordinary scholarly toolrepresented by the Enciclopedia dantesca, dir. U. Bosco, 6 vols. (Rome, Istitutodella Enciclopedia Italiana, 1970–78—henceforth ED) has given Dante studies itssingle most important bibliographical resource, leaving only the last quartercentury—which happens to be the most active period in the history of Dantestudies—uncovered. However, for the years 1965–90 Enzo Esposito has edited ahelpful guide, Dalla bibliografia alla storiografia: la bibliografia dantescanel mondo dal 1965–1990 (Ravenna: Longo, 1995). A closer analysis of a shorterperiod is available in “Bibliografia Dantesca 1972–1977,” ed. LeonellaCoglievina, Studi Danteschi 60 (1988): 35–314 (presenting 3121 items for thisfive-year period). The bibliography in ED, vol. 6, pp. 499–618 (a length thatgives some sense of the amount of basic information available), contains ca.5000 items and is of considerable use, breaking its materials into convenientcategories. (Its bibliography of bibliographies alone runs six double-columnpages, pp. 542–47.) The ED also, of course, contains important bibliographicalindications in many of its entries. A major new English source forbibliographical information has recently been published: The Dante Encyclopedia,ed. Richard Lansing (New York: Garland, 2000).In the past dozen years, Dante studies, perhaps more than any otherpost-classical area of literature, has moved into “the computer age.” There is agrowing online bibliography available, developed from the bibliography ofAmerican Dante studies, overseen by Richard Lansing for the Dante Society ofAmerica, which includes a growing number of Italian items(http://www.princeton.edu/~dante [http://www.princeton.edu/~dante]). Someseventy-one commentaries to the Commedia are now available through the DartmouthDante Project (opened 1988), still best reached via Telnet (telnetlibrary.dartmouth.edu; at the prompt type “connect dante”), but soon to beavailable on the Web as well. There is also the new Princeton Dante Project(http://www.princeton.edu/dante [http://www.princeton.edu/dante]), a multimediaedition of the Commedia (open to public use since 1999) overseen by RobertHollander, which also functions as an entry point to most of the many Dantesites on the Web, perhaps most notably that established and maintained byOtfried Lieberknecht in Berlin, which is a source of an enormous amount ofinformation about Dante in electronic form, and, in the autumn of 2000, the sitebeing developed by the Società Dantesca Italiana (www.danteonline.it[http://www.danteonline.it]).LIST OF WORKS CITED IN THE NOTESAher.1982.1Ahern, John, “Dante’s Slyness: The Unnamed Sin of the Eighth Bolgia,” RomanicReview 73 (1982): 275–91.Aher.1982.2Ahern, John, “Apocalyptic Onomastics: Focaccia (Inferno XXXII, 63),” RomanceNotes 23 (1982): 181–84.Ales.1993.1Alessio, Gian Carlo, and Claudia Villa, “Per Inferno I, 67–87,” in Dante e la“bella scola” della poesia: Autorità e sfida poetica, ed.

The Hollanders capture each and everyaccent in Dante, from the soft-spoken, effusive stilnovist poet, to the wrathfulFlorentine exile, to the disillusioned man who would become what many, includingT. S. Eliot, consider the best poet who ever lived. The Hollanders’ adaptationis not only an intelligent reader’s Dante, but it is meant to enlighten and tomove and ultimately to give us a Dante so versatile that he could at once soarto the hereafter and remain unflinchingly earthbound.”—André Aciman, author of Out of Egypt: A Memoir“The present volume makes the poem accessible to the lay reader and appealing tothe specialist: the translation is both faithful to the original and highlyreadable; the introduction and notes are dense without being overly scholarly;the bibliography consists predominantly of studies in English, encouragingfurther investigation by English-language readers.… A highly worthy new Infernothat is the mature fruit of years of scholarly, pedagogical, and creative work.”—Choice“The Hollanders’ [translation] is probably the most finely accomplished and maywell prove the most enduring.… The annotation is crowded with useful insightsand bits of information and keeps us abreast of scholarly opinion across theages.”—RWB Lewis, Los Angeles Times“The notes following each canto, besides being up-to-date in scholarly terms andfull of the insight produced by decades of teaching, reflection, andscholarship, are of genuinely useful length and pertinence. The decisions theymade about the translation seem completely successful.… This is the translationfor our time and probably beyond.”—National Review“A brisk, vivid, readable—and scrupulously subtle—translation, coupled withexcellent notes and commentary. Every lover of Dante in English should have thisvolume.”—Alicia Ostriker“English-speaking lovers of Dante are doubly in the Hollanders’ debt: first, forthis splendidly lucid and eminently readable version of Dante’s Hell, andsecond, for the provocative, elegantly written commentary, which judiciouslysynthesizes a lifetime of deeply engaged, wide-ranging scholarship, as well asthe past six centuries of commentary on the poem. No student of Dante would wantto be without it.”—John Ahern, Antolini Professor of Italian Literature, Vassar College“This new Hollander translation deserves to sweep the field.… Robert and JeanHollander, both practicing published poets, have produced an English text ofremarkable poetic sensitivity while never traducing the original Italian orpretending to supplant Dante’s poem with one of their own. They have given usthe Inferno in English, not a modern poetic medley on themes by Dante. AndRobert Hollander has supplied precisely that kind of commentary the student orgeneral reader needs—an economical and graceful edifice of explanatory notesresting firmly on a foundation, massive and deep, yet invisible and thereforenot distracting to the reader’s eye, of the erudition of a lifetime’s study ofthe medieval Italian poets.”—John Fleming, Professor of English and Comparative Literature, PrincetonUniversity"}]
