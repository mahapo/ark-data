In t he liv ely hope whi ch animates “t he fol k secure of beho lding th e light on high,” he can see o nly a lack of em otio n resu ltin g in frigi dity; and even the visions and d ream s, i mp ortant as they are to the understanding of the Cantica, seem to him ad apted only to awak en the impati ence of the reade r , in haste to get to the en d of the story .

Several of the reason s which, in the pref ace to the s econd Cantica, I ur ged as jus tif ying the cl ai ms of that part of the Comm edia to s pecial atten tion no longer a pply .
