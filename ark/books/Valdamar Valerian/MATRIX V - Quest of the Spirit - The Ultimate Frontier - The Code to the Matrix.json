The unwary soul, who fails to grapple with the Mocki ng Demon of Illusion, will return to the Earth as the slave of Illusion. To become a true master of fate you must first become a “Knower of Self”. In a time much too distant to co nsider we as Humans splitting from the single Source entered Duality. Spiraling away from the Creator some spun in the direction of 6 while others spun in the opposite direction of 9, this is the “Spiral Force”. These two fo rms contain complete opposites, however, it is with their Union something new can be born, this is the sequence of life. Our Solar System houses various Binary or Dual worlds an d Earth called first Tiamat is one of them. Once entering this realm the Spirit begin to develop its ve ry narrow definition of th ings, as in most cases, besides twins, they ar e lacking their other side. In extinct we cr eate a “stand in” wh ich we call the ego. The ego is wholly constructed of as tral energy in which we create an d breathe life into everyday. At times not knowing “power” we birth a Monster which we love and care for since after all it is a part of us, our baby. At some point in incarnations or loops one real izes they must begin the quest of taming the Monster. They realize they must flip it over and ride it. At that moment they also see how strong it has become as it is stuck in its ways, rigid in form, brutish and ineloquent . In that condition we can take it nowhere just as you never take a street dog into a roya l party. The work before us then was to take this rough cut stone and form it into a chariot of fire that could propel us th rough the center of the Universe, it is there we will meet our other half . In this realm that is the meaning to life. To help us through this whole process and all of its components the Most High developed a system based upon the energies of the entire Univ erse. Seeing that Humans ar e smaller composites of the Celestial Spheres it be came possible for one to know how to guide their particular life in the direction that would equal the greate st amount of potential for their unique design. In each person lies the pearl of the highest potential, if developed it is a treasure to all existence visible and invisible. This wondrous Metamorphosis was possible of the Hu man creation, however, as you see in some parts of nature, not every creation has been given this ab ility. Thus there arose a challenge from lower forms"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 | P of c o the “ disc o but two ? eac h If s o the m Re d iv t w c a wi P age o nsciousne s “ Limits”.

If you ask a Pastor of a Ch urch they will say it is ev il to tell lies period, but is better to allow the loved one to be hurt? As you see everything is a matter of perspective. So there can be no good and bad only reason and reason has so many parameters if all things are not considered a person could be left confused, not knowing what decision to make from time to time thus they are left and lost in time. Whatever you do in life le t it be endowed with meaning and purpose. The world is lodged in the phase of opposite s right now, thus we face wars, racism, and extinction of our natural life. Wh at I’m presenting here is the information of the inner workings of the World along with its Creeds, Cu ltures, and Religions that have shaped our thoughts and actions since antiquity extending several incarnations. We will see how idea s grow over time and sometimes lose their true meaning altogether. In this we will see also how we were take n off track. This due in part by the “controllers” knowing if you take humans from their original cycle they are easy to confuse and enslave. Let us not forget we faced many conque rors in the past, intending to usurp the order of the world and bring it under their sway, this they accomplished, and it should not be forgotten no matter how much the Illusion tells you it does not exist. The foolish think of Me, the Un-manifest, as having manifestation, knowing not My Higher, immutable and most excelle nt form. Fools disregard Me as clad in human shape not knowing flesh cannot withstand Me. They have em pty hopes, vain actions, of va in knowledge and senseless they verily are possessed of deceitful nature an d become un-divine Beings. I hu rl these evil-doers into the womb of distortion deluded birth after birth, not attaining Me they thus fall into a condition even lower, without the slightest suspension, proving th ey are not using the reason and senses We gave them. The Most High There exist certain systems, mainly language and re ligion that perpetuate th is fallacy of Illusion in a subliminal way. If you happen to be aligned wi th any of the religions or ideas being discussed, do be careful not to think of it as bad if you happen to hear something that makes you uneasy, after all, many of us at one time or another in this life or in past lives have avowed ours elves to something only to later find out we have outg rown it because we now possess an entirely different set of key knowledge. Every time we learn something new that is the truth we should celebrate, we are closer to home. THE OTHERS This world we are in is fully an imate, it has been constructed by an “Ability” so powerful it has missed no details. Challenge in life equals substantial growth. It is after all the constant lifting of heavier weights that makes a person strong. Those weig hts we must lift are ac tually other life forms"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 | Page that are very dense slow moving vibrations. These we ights when attached to us make us wait right here on Earth burdened down and unable to fly. Those of us who are Divi ne Positive are attracted to the Light thus we must get lite by releasing the weight. But wait, the complexity of the Creator exist with in its Creations and there are many of us. On 3 rd Density we all appear to be ab out the same. Two arms, two legs, a head, etc. although if you had the ability to see each individuals astral form no two forms would look the same. Some you would see infused with animal natures, extraterrestrial life, unknown elements and essences, and everything else they had accumulated in pa st existences all comprised in one Auri c Field. When that field is placed in a humanoid body the outer shell look s similar enough to allow you to get along in society. We are all something much more different then what is seen in the mirror, so we must never be confused that the reflection is the complete you. On other dimensions there are so many life fo rms they cannot be catalog ed. It would be much more difficult than listing every type of insect, pl ant, fish, mammal etc. wh ich exist on such a small Planet as Earth. On their dimens ion they have a spirit form, the “Breathe” flows through all living creatures. When they take physical form, as we have, they combine with what is most like their character. The ancient knowledge was to know how they appeared in the “Seen World”, how to communicate with them, and which ones to avoid. Many of these Beings had no concern for the Humanoids whatsoever themselves being either much too dense to comprehend human life or much to developed to waste thought on something so distant and primitive. There are Beings who in fact are closer to us in proximity of Creation and also endowed with reason. They possessed a fiery and ai ry nature they are known now as the Serpents. Mankind’s history with the Serpents is un deniable, for example: In Columbian Mythology Bachue the primordial woman was called “Serpeinte Celestial” (Celestial Snake). Mesoamerican cultures worshipped Quetzc oatl the feathered Serpe nts and they await His return just as Christ ians wait for Jesus. The Egyptians called them Neteru an d said they came on heavenly boats and set up Priesthoods whose Priest were called Dj edhi, sound familiar? The Sumerians claimed their ancestors where Reptil ian Annunaki who genetica lly modified them to be slaves. It is of value to keep in mind the Sumerians say they where hybridized and made as slaves while other legends simply say they in termingled with their population. In Ethiopia stories and ancient st atues can be found of the Serpents known as Naga. These Naga also went into Persia and China. Nagasaki was named af ter the Serpents who migrated there. In Japan the Dragon Yasha is the protector of Buddhism. The Celts make mention of the Druid Adders or great serpents that came to instruct them in mystical arts."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 | Page The Hebrews speak of the Serpent Nakash who was ever giving them trouble and misguiding their people. The Arabs produced thousands of codex warning of the Serpent Sh aitan and his cunning ways of making man and woman fall short. It is safe to say that we can identify at least on e non-humanoid Being that in fact interfaces with our life cycle, and this is only one but there are ma ny more. Thus we should be able to establish that we are not alone. Reason 2: The Maya clearly show they had already pledged allegiance to a group of “Masculine” Serpents. The Serpent races are just as vast as our own. Many of the Serpents are on a “collective mind” thus th ey are generally out to accomplish there own agenda and stop at nothing to see it through. Humans are looked at as a resource to most of them , they are a Supremacist warrior class, also some have mated with the Human race and try to protect their “Hybrids” as extended family. Many of the Ancient Reptilians despise this union and thus a war has ensued amongst the Elders and the Siblings. Reason 3: In the Egyptian Glyphs it clearly shows much larger Humanoids inhabited the land. They are the Nephalim bent on world domination and enslaving what they called inferior Humans. They exist now in spirit form. This is beyond Alexander the Great and Constantine in fact this is where they drew their power and destiny from. They were just the Human catalyst, Hybrids themselves although there Legends are so shrouded in myth it does them little credit to th e truth of their origin. Alexander was known as “Great Two Horn” and by the Arabs Dhul-Qarna yn who built the wall."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 | Page The correct knowledge actually makes your spirit larger. Knowledge is the food for the Spirit. When this happens just like a fish that has gotten t oo big for its tank, you must move on. This is no different than having a small bike as a child that tak es you everywhere you need to go, as a child your range is a lot smaller. When you get older you may need a car, plane, or even a ship depending on where you are intending to travel. The body itself wh en developed is the vehicle to traverse the cosmos and it must now be prepared to do su ch a thing, this is a vastly popu lated territory we speak of and it contains the experiences you will need to continue growth. We will discover that all the things we have gone through in life have serv ed to get us to that point, it is only of value to realize that since nothing is absolutely still you mu st continue to move, this is th e nature of our entire Universe nothing dies even if you blow it up it will still beco me an infinite amount of pieces of whatever it was before. It is a wondrous age we have entered as we wa tch the mist of the Illu sion dissipate, the hot spiral of reality permeates the gl obe. We are awakening as children of giants from a long slumber realizing that we have been living a long dream. As a Planet we have seen many ages that are part of a larger cycle of growth, this is the process of turnin g dirt into Gold. One thing that we can be sure of since man and woman have triumphed through the St one Age to now meet th e end of the Space Age we most certainly intend to continue on to what is next. Like a game of chess you anticipate the player’s next move, so we see that it is the Age of Ether we are arriving into or more simply put, Spirit. No w we can begin to do the th ings that only made up the fiction portion of our previous ideas and imagin ation. The weight of the body, which is now the cube, will be shed and we will be open once more to higher senses . We would do well to develop and train these senses now. As we speed up and things take place it will not be time to practice. There is no doubt that we will experience a new aeon we are all Adepts of Motion, Acolytes of the Flux, we populate the Galaxy and thus we have solidified our wave thro ugh the harmonic cosmos. We are Vessels of known and unknown energi es untold being ourselves convertors for multiple life forms to assimilate and grow not only on Earth bu t also in space as above so below. Reason 4: From the Stone Age to the Space Age was made to look so easy a caveman could do it. Have you asked yourself where our world is headed next? What do you think organizations like NASA, Lucent, and Sony are really doing with now Trillions of dollars?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 | Page This energy field cannot be seen with the untr ained eye but exist all ar ound you as a standing column wave. With the science of sound which is vibration we can venture to know that if a large wave is made by anything in the same pool, it will only make the smallest wa ves speed up and increase in size, thus the small are support ed by the Great and coaxed to become bigger. Since these Greater Forces are now sending out stronger waves than ever our choice is when we fa ce that big wave, can we ride it, or will we wipe out and hope to catch another. We can be sure that we cannot be destroyed because the soul within us, a gift by the Most High , is Immortal and without end, but ye can be made to forget which is called the second death. When a person really assimilates there are other “Sentient” things in existence it opens them up to better Innerstanding the Most High through diversity. This also allo ws us to make a sober estimate of ourselves and where we personally s tand in the levels of Matter. When one remains insolent to a fact of such magnitude, there are sure to be repercussions. Those repercussions cause a Supremacist nature; never considering what we thin k is the top is actually the bottom for another Being. We would assu me we are on an elated level which real ly does even more damage than good since the sub-conscious mind factors in that we are poisoning the same air we breathe, so as the most intelligent we are really the most ignorant. Anything built on th at kind of foundation will go through successions of destruction and chaos, now we have Earth’s full historical de scription.

I had no doubt heard of accele rated thinking and higher abilities, however, my intention at the time was to just s eek answers from a Higher Source, not to mention trusting if whether a Higher Sour ce could actually be contacted. I knew something Higher existed, that became obvious by seriou sly taking into account man did not create man, it’s at least mathematically not possible. I had done this by chanting until my body had changed it s complete vibrational frequency which took about 2 hours and some extreme de sire. The desire I called (HSM) Heart, Soul, and Mind something I found in the Tora h that was worth extracting. It was said to be the real formula of contacting the Most High, a focal point to interface with if One came to such a moment that contact would need to be made. Once I started to activate all th e metal in the room was shaking I had to remove my watch, belt, and anyt hing that contained metal. I had no idea this was going to be the outcome, the energy was far more than I anticipated thus I was extremely unprepared and confused but strong nonetheless, I ha d become the portal for Higher Selves. As the camera continued to ru n on my PS3 catching these moments I knew we had something special, finally I had vividly captur ed my proof of the paranormal. I ca n only explain it as I went up and came back down very fast and I could feel the Essence of were I ha d gone inside of me, especially in my hands. My friend, who is now my witness wa s even less prepared, he had also experienced the phenomena by simply touching me once I reached Hi gh Vibration, this he did by accident or fear of the metal situation. This prompted him to grab me and ask me what was happ ening, like I knew. That caused it to spread to him instantly and later he said “he went down deep into somewhere, saw himself, grabbed himself, and starte d making an ascension back out wi th Things hot on his trail”. He was, what I later figured out, in some lower dimension being rule d by some Dominion. This was defiantly a result of his current character al though he was given a chance nonetheless. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 | Page Breaking through the Netherworld with obviously his Ka in tow, my friend got stuck. How this appeared in our Realm was he looked to me to be gone, wacko, done, goosed. I was gathering myself fast, still feeling the strength, but also thinking of the full parameters of what just occurred. I knew that I had to do something fast because my friend (fiend) was saying the same two words over and over so loud eventually the neighbors would call the cops , he seemed to be in a mental loop. Using the “WORD” I yelled It into his mouth, it was all I could think to do. Later he said at that moment he saw a light and he was able to hurry to it. That br ought him back to this Plan e. That was my second vivid Spiritual encounter.

It was through Them it was conveyed to me my mishaps. It wa s in such joy of returning to the true Path and turning from the Ab yss that I light ultra rays Resple ndid that will exhaust Plutonium fuel cells so all in the darkness may know of and come to receive the real Light. It was then I knew that the world could raise its entire vibration by contact with just one person who could hold the frequency. The voice th at entered inside of my head after “the charge” started to tell me things that I had never read or seen before. I also felt the ac tivation of the opposite hemisphere of my brain which came first as a separate voice with a mind of its own. At first I thought I had gone crazy or had broken something in my br ain, as I settled down I realized it was my other half so excited to be heard finally. I spent weeks on Google checking the information after it was made known to me and I was fascinated with such a breakt hrough as everything that was being spoken into my mind was accurate, not to mention the personal hidden things it reveal ed. For me at that moment I knew there was something they were not telling us , this should be the first subject in school! I imagined how much the encounter would enli ven the Youth this is what we wanted. Later when I was able to enter Higher States th rough simple whole body breathing techniques I realized our potential as a Species is definitely a threat to anything that se eks to rule over the Human Race. It would not be possible, the energy of free dom is too great and when felt, ones life means nothing if they cannot constantly feel it again. If the Humans were to unlo ck their true self thus broadcasting a higher signal or frequency that would permeate the globe, it wo uld surely burn holes in the nets and webs created to surround our atmosp here (At Most Fear) that’s keeping us trapped within. They admit the eye can see thousands of miles when there is no atmosphere, this was another phenomena they recorder when in Space. This is the time one is now free to feel and receive the truth fr om the thin air which contains a stream of information of now, past , future and most valuably who we really are. Who we really are is the biggest secret period, any wise man thinking on that will agree. What I also felt more than I understood was that it was harder to destroy a Planet than it was to keep it in harmony and peace. The Planet was so strong, I watched how much She took payloads of nuclea r arsenals “H” Bombs and “A” Bombs all while keeping the children snug on the other side of the world, spinning lightly on her axis with only a slight wobble. This is the true food for thought. I was convinced that the majority would want to be on a Higher Vibration and I set out almost immedi ately on that Quest. What was conveyed to me then was that many people in our history all the way until our current day claiming spirit ual enlightenment, especi ally the New Agers, were talking to Angels and Masters that had in fact corrupted our world long ago. Many of these Beings at a certain point were workers of a much Greater Force thus they lear ned various mental and sp iritual techniques that appear Godlike to humans. In time, pride, jealousy, selfishness, and scarcity crept in the Order and ideas that they should divvy up everything that was re sourceful to them became prevalent. This is in part due to the nature of the Most High which does not watch all its Creations like a micro manager."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 | Page Once the design is put in place It’s off Creating mo re Universes and all in ti me will eventually take its proper form, however, there are phas es in between. The Creations make up the entire construct of allowing those “in between phases” to be possible, we sha rpen each other. As with all things some Beings have more senses thus more power than others. These Beings are often times given the name Angels, although there classification is much vaster and the term Angel is far from the word that should be used. Consider this, most modern Angels names end in EL. EL is the Name given by the Hebrews of their God which corresponds to our Planet Saturn, this means all the Angels work for El and this you will see is true on various levels as we go on. You will learn to trace the Origin of a Name using a system that is infallible. Through the correct procedure you can seriously have a Guide to the Universe and a map to other worlds beside Eart h Dimension 3. Breaking down Saturn you have Sat and Urn or Sa and Turn. The word with the most pr actical use out of these combinations is Sat and Urn. As we go on you will learn who Sat is. As said before the original name for this Planet was El thus the new Name given in English signifies some type of unity between this Being “Sat” and another simply ca lled “Urn”. When we drop the “N ” to see if we can get anymore clarity since an Urn’s basic meaning is just someth ing you use to put the ashes of the cremated dead in, we find a place that syncs up Ur. “Ur” was know n as Chaldea, also known as Samaria, also known as Babylon. History says Ur of Chaldea, home of Marduk , Chaldean Magic and the Necromicon spell book was also home of a young boy known as Abram, late r Abraham. According to the story Abram’s father Terah made idols known as Teraphim and it was Abram’s responsibili ty to peddle those idols to the people. It was said Abra m rejected the worship of the idols be cause they had no power. He later discovered the true God and thus became the father of all Mankind, just like that. Logically this story has to have so type of hidden meaning because its li teral definition is prepost erous although almost all people believe in the literal meaning; they believe Abraham is their ancestral father even when their genealogy places them somewh ere like Africa or Asia. These household Teraphim caused much trouble th roughout the Bible even after Abrams exit from Ur. Rachel stole Teraphim from her father and he could not rest until they were returned, a few other similar stories exist like this . It is revealed that the Sylphs, Serpent spirits of the Air whom I call Siths, inhabited these items and wo uld bring forth Oracles of the future. Abraham wife is Sarah his father is Terah. It is obvious th e real story here is about the unit y of the Seraphim and the Teraphim both being spirit forms. Again, since the Bible is a partial account of variou s stories, only those who really have dissected the clay tablets are able to cross all these characters back over to their original Sumarian Archetypes along with pu tting together the details of thei r story about what went on. When we are simply looking for truth and spiritual growth this all becomes too mu ch. So many have never researched any of this and are at th e alters blindly saying AMEN, they mind as well add Ra after that, its still the same Being. Amen-Ra. Blindly they are dragged about."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 | Page All the stories from the Sumarian Tablets are retold in the Tora h after a few alterations mainly with the Names of the individuals involved. By changing the Names it became virtually impossible for the “common” people of the times, most of whom could not read no r write, to realize they were actually still following the religion of the Chaldean s long after being lead fr om captivity. The Hebrews became enslaved by the Babylonian s, along with many other Nations afterward. As more cultures are put into the melting pot of Babylon, facts become blurred with fiction and languages are turned to Babel. Terah, Abraham’s Father an d Torah the first 5 books of the Bible are so close together in spelling it begs one to wonder wh at is meant by all this? You will s oon see that many of the stories being told are the events of the cross-br eading that took place with mankind. Amazingly many ancient nations such as the Ph oenicians had no written language or culture of their own, instead they borrowed from everyone th ey conquered. They altere d the original cultures and languages of these people saying they were “perfecting” them, what au dacity. In the Western world we credit our language, English, much of our symbolism like the Ph oenix, our current death and resurrection doctrine, and many other things to the Phoenicians who were really the Philistines. Philadelphia was the original state capitol of th e United States. The biggest mistake a conquered people can make is to be gin to imagine they were never defeat ed, thus placing their trust in the assailant. We are seeing the results of that now, our Government, Spiritual Leaders, and Instructors have been telling a multitude of lies many without the slightest kn owledge of it. Some are sworn traitors avowed to something much more sinister. We mistakenly have trus ted the same system that once brutally annihilated everything that had its own will so they could indoctrinate their falsehood. What now has to be done in order for us to di scover our true potential is we have to put our real past back together. During the times Pharaohs, Czars, Kings, and Shahs despoiled the lands they found it most important to alter th e history, culture, and language of the people they conquered. This is how they gained a monopoly over social and spir itual power, the later bein g the controller of the former. Most of these factions served the “Unseen Ha nd” very far back in our history so they generally Reason 7: There are traitors amongst us with phenomenal resources that have avowed to so mething far more devious then can normally be conceived. Left unchecked for centuries they have finally come to the conclusion of an agenda scheduled for the near future. Who will face them?"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 | Page had the same agenda. Removing a pers ons spiritual belief in themselves leaves them powerless. All of Mysticism has effect based on the be lief of the Welder of such power. In ancient times many had such exemplary belief in their Internal Power, Symbols, and Talismans they where very difficult to conquer much less indoctrinate. The tyrants of ancient times sent entire armies to subdue them and often entire armies were laid to wast e, many eluded those armies by going underground, deep into the mountains, and some even left this dimension, af ter all what does killing mind controlled soldiers really solve? The greatest adversary to the human race ha s been the human race. No matter how much evidence we find that links Devils, Aliens, Spirits and various other li fe forms to the corrosion of our natural state, in all these stories yo u will find human traitors that gave them access to our inner circles. The entire human race was a colle ctive brother and sisterhood capable of maintaining contact with one another across entire planetar y systems. We were gr ouped more commonly as all Humanoids, not black man, white man, yellow man, etc. It is virtually impossible to break apart from the outside anything as strong as human will. This book is not about pointing the finger, this book is about Innerstanding our original state, ho w it was altered, how to grow ba ck into it, and even excel beyond its original potential. At this moment we are in a degraded state, it is only pride that keeps the individual from admitting this. Power now lies most ly in monetary wealth, not spiritual essence one will always pass away the other is eternal. Common sense is not common. This may sound a little confusing especially this early on, however, the earlier you see this the better. When they decided to make the Names for the Planets in Englis h they really did began to turn things in an opposite direction. Searching for other Names indigenous tribes used for the Planets will turn up almost nothing. Some may think this is because in Ancients times we had no knowledge of the Cosmos, and of course this pr oves to be untrue. We are told th e Sumerians, Egyptians, and a few indigenous tribes from Africa have the only details of the Names given to the Planets in ancient times. Whatever the case we can be sure that what we ca ll the Planet Saturn in modern times may not be actually referring to the Planet with the rings, but mo re of an idea of Evil Sa t, bought forth from Ur. Our consciousness, when not hindered, will always look to the sky for answers. Our Spirit is from the sky or rather far out in space while our bo dies are indeed flesh and wi ll remain here as dust. When we innocently inquire about the names of Plan ets, Stars, and Moons wanting to learn more, we get names that are tainted with deception.

They possessed various powers that caused the indigenous tribes of the time to worship the Supreme Creators which was far from true. The head of the Fallen Angels would place the Demigods over the people to rule them in a hierarchy or Pyramid structure.

Those who were more interested in the fast route imagining that Spiritual work was a road to riches would inherit the curse of Ammon/Amon one of the first names given to Planet Jupiter and is in fact a very active Egyptian God. Jupiter is one of the largest Planets in this system. From here we will refer to Jupiter or Ammon as Am on so we can keep track of this Being. Even the Bible scripture gives a clue when it says “Thou canst serve both God and Mammon”, unfort unately it didn’t leave more detailed information. The “Am” in Amon is where the “Am” in America comes from and is the great I AM. You will find an advanced intelligent “Am”phibian called Oanes the fish God amongst them along with its offspring such as Dagon, they crossed into our world a long time ago under the Sumarian name E.A. (pro nounced Aya) Lord and King of the S”ea”. One of the greatest questions that will ultimately come to mind is; are the ac tual Planets themselves doing this, or are these malevolent Beings with various powe rs who have fooled man into be lieving they are the Planets? To answer that we will have to consider a fe w things, the Planets themselves are in a fixed movement everything interacting together. I person ally know there are many more Planets in our immediate system that most know nothing of such as Vulcan. The he aviest spiritual involvement from these “Sat”ellites seems to come from the Asteroid s like Venus and Ceres al ong with what we call Meteorites ,“falling stars”, and comets, that seem to cause many of the problems. There are also hollowed artificial satellites such as our Moon Si n, and Phobos which are bases of some sort. Think of this also, the Bible is supposed to be a Holy Book and in the end you find a passage that says something like “Whoa to the one who adds or takes away from what is written in this book, We will add to him the plagues of this Book and take away his Name from the B ook of Life”. There is obviously a faction that cares noth ing of this warning because every time a new addition of the Bible comes out, there are serious change s. People need to start seeing that the ones who are changing it care nothing for the curses because there are none and the Book itself ha s stories borrowed from everywhere, such was the way of these people. The negative forces are infamous for lying, if a Being says “I AM Amon I AM Jupiter the Planet you know as the biggest”, I find this no different from a ma n who says “I AM the Son of the Sun and because of that I have leave to destroy ever ything in my path”. Ma n has been notorious for blindly following these possessed deluded traitors wh o are blurred by their ow n desire to iconoclast themselves in the mold of time and usurp the Th rone of the Great One which is unreachable and immeasurable.

One simply has to think that although some may perceive already that we are alone in this Universe, which is profoundly un -true, if we blew up Earth it would cause a chain reaction of cataclysms for the entire galaxy thus we have been governed by higher forces that oversee the timing of events so the crazy Dictator does n’t slip on the nuclear kill switch. There are Principalities, Rulers, Forces, and Dominions in pl ace working out an entirely larger scheme that makes Earth more of a value subd ued, not destroyed. Think of the loss of resources and biological data. Earth is a storehouse of genes working toge ther well enough. For one moment do not doubt all these genes are in criyo tubes fully cataloged and read y to implant into other wo rlds which is a part of Terraforming a Planet and getting it prepar ed for higher life forms like me and you. Since we know there are other Beings with other senses we can endeavor to obtain those senses also. This separates us from anim als who seldom openly enlist the help of humans. This also means that some who have higher senses have already discovered harmon y, the benefits of a collective mind, the power in Numbers, the Elements, etc. thus there is a place to go. It is entirely possible that the knowledge of even how to alter an entire planetary frequency with just insect s that also emit sound frequency is in the Orion arsenal of technology. This moves us further into the intelligence of Beings who are more advanced in some wa ys than us. We could go so far in imagining what they have and what they can do and we would more than likely be right, however, what is of value here is to show that they are not the Creator of all things. They to had a Cr eator and if we find ourselves in service, it should be to That only. They are no doubt involved in our evolution; there can be no question of it. Just as the wheel has saved us endl ess amounts of time and effort so we may travel further, faster. If these Beings gave us T.V. or should I say things like the Cathode Ray Tube and the Integrated Circuit that’s enough altering right there, case closed. The way many Beings feel about Earth is they would not give so mething that looks like dust compared to Antares and Betelgeuse the honor of destroying this whole Ga laxy. Everything must evolve in time and for this se gment of the Human race that time is long overdue. The lower dimension now awaits occupying the spot we are in now. Since the information vault is now open you can gain a higher level of esoteric intelligence, wi thout being fully Initiated, and thus stuck in some lower dimension slave world ruled by jealous me galomaniacs because you joined the wrong group chanting Namaste, “Name Sat”. Some of the most valuable portions of th is information has come from Higher Beings still reaching back to help al ong the children which we all are, they gave no names, and they demanded no worship save to the Original Cr eator in which all things will eventually have to face and it is patient Shrouded within itse lf Majestic and Wise. Many of the forces that have invisibly protected and guided the Human race have long since ascended be yond points where they can any longer interact with the Earth because of contamination and its lack of pure ideas thus there is a heavy need for new Ethe real Planetary workers, not Golden Age materialist."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26 | Page On the flip side there are those working with th e dark force that have kept the masses in this recent segment of time away from the true wisdom .

Those who have read works li ke the Art of War and the Law of Seduction should get a general idea of how they op erate in business much less in the Spiritual World.

In addition they do not just read but put into play the methods being elaborated upon as if the world is only a giant chess board with human pieces. Even now this particular work which you ho ld in your hands is allowed to reach the mainstream not because they could not easily stop it, but because it fulfills another one of the Prophecies, thus they cannot plug the loop hole th at has been made. Although they plan unceasingly the Most High is the greatest plan ner. Have you not noticed the forces that seek to hinder always tell what is to come in the future before it happens? Even in the Bible there is always a solemn warning by the Prophet before the destruction. This is in fact a Law of the Universe which exist so that all conscious Beings on a Planet may ha ve a choice of whether they want to participate in the collectively planned future of that Planet, attempt to do someth ing to prevent it, or eman cipate themselves from it entirely which is always an opti on. We do hold the master button on our personal Earth life if we want to really exit, we ca n make it happen, some type of choice always clings to us. Our future is the beautiful fractalised shape of a myriad of choices. As you see within the word “Pla net” there is a “Plan” here wh ich we will just call “Planned Net 10” which means the end of one world and of course many new worlds will begin after. Our status in the ungoverned worlds beyond has much to do with our accolades and milestones that we have crossed in our previous world of origin. This information al ways remains on our Aura even if we are unaware of it. Think of yourself known throughout the whol e Universe as someone who assisted your race in Ascension. As all things are recorded that’s what the record will reflect once the deed is accomplished. Every action we make will always be contained somewh ere, it determines what we are to face next on various levels of action and reaction, it can always be accessed and cannot be erased just balanced. If you were strong did you protect the weak? If you were truly wise did you share your knowledge to your best ability? If you possessed wealth did you distribute the goods commi tted to your charge? It was known that each segment of astrological time is controlled by a particular Planet. That Planet is responsible for emitting the energy that is necessary to accomplish what has to be done during that cycle. The Universe can be looked at as a big clock in which the Planets rotate positions as if on massive cogs. It is known that Mars was on ce in the position we are occupying now in the Cosmos, they were the 3 rd Planet with a lush surfac e, oceans, etc. What is left now after their wars is just their core in which we still find war torn life , Mars was 3 times larger than Earth, a sad story that was.

The wars fought on Mars continue here on Earth between the two factions called Atla ntians and Lemurians. We find Sh aka Zulu as one of the earliest African films introduced into our physic for a reason that will be obvious later. The original Phoenicians were also of darker skin tone. It may be of value for you to start seeing these Deities, Gods, Spirits, Da emons, as Beings alien to you because there are many of them that did not originate here on Earth. In ancient times people had gained the knowledge of this and began to emul ate the movement of Energies, Stars, and Planets, and thus some became completely al ienated from the people. This is al so when the Elitist religions of the “Chosen People” began to flouri sh. Those who wished to be in power during a certain era would make pacts and oaths with the Spir it energies and from there they would become fleshly vessels doing the bidding of these rouges by declaring war on all unbelieving infidels. Even the word “Peace” means something must be split up and on ly a portion remains. The word Un ity also means a unit or part, not the whole thing. We have gr own so accustomed to these word s we don’t see that every time nations use it as a reason to go to war, we get ex actly what we ask for, sending in the Units to tear things to Peaces. The world has now been divided in to so many pieces we ha ve all become isolated from one another and thus we thin k our true enemy is our fellow ma n and women and silently in the Cabal rules one who is not Human at all.

Vile Beings in the Real m of afterlife betwixt dimensions began hording the Human souls after death. Other times we were made while living to go to physical war in the Name of the Gods which only hurt us, fragile flesh is. This was forbidden times, man was lost wo rshipping Gods, Stars, Asteroids, and Moons, thus Destiny was created.

Reason 15: This is by far not the first Aquarian or Golden Age, in fact this only represents the time of a shift. The energy of the Cosmos actually assists a person, if they do a little seeking, to find Higher Truth. Once that time passes those who have not seized Enlightenment will come around the cycle again after death remembering little of what happened before. The Golden Age Movement is designed to get the whole world to rewind and re-live a time long past.

This other world is what we glimpse ourselves in at times while we are sleep or in vision, in this world everything appears as it really is and there are few limits. One has higher senses, can fly through the Ether, considers not time, and can make contact with mult iple Beings. Omnipresence, the art of being in more than one place at a time, is possible in this pa rallel realm thus you can visi t multiple people all in one moment. This is why it is easier to contact other Beings while in Lucid Sleep, so the controllers do their best to keep us from being conscious while in that world, even more than they do in this one. We tend to watch our dreams rather than control them, as in society we have a tendency to take things as they come and react accordingly rather than getting directly involved in the big picture. On the 3 rd dimension there are physical laws agai nst Omnipresence generally you can only separate your body into 2 parts while on 3 rd dimension.

Destruction is a ma in part of keeping up the Chaos on Earth and many of these Beings are destroyers. Now that the Hindu Pantheism is the preference for the New World Order they have unleashed a whol e retinue of Destroyers like Shiva, Kali, and Latchme. They con “Khan” the person by telling them to think they must be destroyed completely to be made new again as they dissolve into nothingne ss. They are instructed to chant and meditate on the Destroyer which is a weakening t ool. This is no different than nonsense like boiling frogs’ eyes in pigeon’s blood which Agrippa used to recommend to Caesar. The end if thes e things could never be positive because it began in negativity. Kali is bedecked in the severed head s of the victims she has destroyed.

It can be assumed that their he ight proportion is in conjunction with the size of their Planet. Amon has 63 moons orbiting it while we have only one and that one Moon has a lot of influence over the minds of our planetary inhabitants because of the magnetic energy. As will be seen more and more Humans are energy and we have a magnetic core and poles ju st the same as a Planet hence the term Bi-Polar. To show a brief link we will talk of another tool used against us which is money. This is by far the most effective tool so I will discuss its “Spirit Origin”. The money we use now is “Pa”per we are no longer really using currency made of metals as yo u may have notice. In the old days if you had lots of Silver or Gold you at least had the energy of these metals around you and they carried certain types of strength that gave one certain spiritual advantag es, now we are on paper. Why? The main advent of this was with the first Pope of wh om his parents were “Pa”pists. A Pa pist is a person who makes paper or “Pa”rchment. This magical art wa s known to be taught by one of th e fallen Angels and is discussed in the book of Enoch under, cutti ng of roots. Certain trees when blended together and formed into parchment have a binding effect. Th is is the basis for the special pa per a talisman must be inscribed on. When you look at the currency of the world, which has been revealed with the U.S. one dollar bill, you will see many magical symbols, especially St ars, and even a magnetic strip to give it power. The paper itself holds a binding en ergy that perpetuates ou r desire for it; this was one of many wicked things done by the “Pa”pacy by direction of the esoteric knowledge of the Jesuits. Reason 20: While pretending to teach moderation and piety the vice generates for the Wicked One spew their poison of money/Mammon over the Earth. Few know of the Black Pope which controls the Jesuit arm of the Papacy. Money has become the stumbling block of the world. I’ve heard many say “he is our Pope” indeed they will share his lot. To the left is an “astral depiction of the Pope” the use of trees for magic has been their main tactic . Tree, Three, Word, Wood."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 | Page Looking at our world today one should not be surprised that destruction and chaos beyond preconceived proportion could be possibly looming in the future. We have the NWO Zionist who no longer want money only blood, The Annunaki Ship Nibiru or Planet X whic h can be seen from the South Pole lazily headed this way, the End of th e 13 Moon Mayan Calendar , Global Warming beyond reversal, Anti-Christ’s in Las Vegas and India, Quet zalcoatl the feather serpen t scheduling a tour, the proposed Alien Invasion warming thei r ships, The Galactic Line up cl icking into place, a population doubling by 2012 and a host of other wild cards to give us a jolt into the future. It is safe to say maybe one should start tuning in to Higher Energy and ph one home just in case on of these things just happens or maybe even all of them all at the same time. In any event this book will serve to prepare the sincere, while still making a good read for the ever remaining skeptic which I began as myself. It is better to think of it this way, since the Earth continues to be polluted and mistreated with no cl ear sign of massive reversal, we can move a step ahead and just come to the conclusion that all this is happening to promote us to wake up from the “s”mothering and see what else is out there. We must connect with our other half then with Spirit newly mended we can go to the next wave length. With this formulation we are now wholly prepared or re-“membered”, everything we need being internal , thus we are self sufficient to move about the Galaxy to meet new life which equals new experience. This ensu res our proper growth and of course that we don’t get bored in Immortality caught in infinite loops of Qlipoth. Just how long can we as a people really wake up every morning, battle traffic, suck fresh smog, get to work, give half of what we earn to Fascis t, come home and eat Code x Alimentarius infested food, get digitally mind controlled by the Flat Screen , go to sleep, not remember our dreams and start over again the next day. C’mon have you noticed that for many it seems like the movie Ground Hogs Day, February 2, the 33 rd day of the year, and why are we takin g this? There is something that has not been figured out, not because of the lack of intelligence, but rather the height of distraction. I personally believe that right now in your hands is what you need to get your perspective focused once again on the main picture. The census says our population will actually doub le by the year 2012 the reader should highly consider if the Earth can handle doub le the trouble it is in now. It is due time that the world change and the same energy used to destroy for so long will now consume those who used it in vain as they are consumed in the reflux current. The Elite knew ther e would be those that woul d come able to convert their negative energy they spewed upon us into po sitive. They tried to tell us it was only One, the anagram for Neo, that could do it which is far from the truth. They feared and anticipated that the younger generation, who seem to have the unique ab ility of converting bad into good, would catch on at some point and Break the Matrix. This term The Matrix comes from the head of the Greek Goddess Pantheon known as Mede atrix of whom their descenda nts come from Medea/Media."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35 | Page There are those who serve consolidated dark ener gies under a Elitist pretense and thus have been eating away at society for centuries.

This Plutonium is being kept in the satellites we have in orbit over the Planet.

The world government has proclaimed to benevolen t extraterrestrials that if they seek to “physically” intervene then they ca n pick up the ashes. This is why you don’t see vivid aid from other Benevolent Humanoid factions, they remain at the status of “unseen” , they show us the way through signs and seldom materialize.

Most organizations especi ally secret societies are compartmentalized in a way where each group is only holding a fraction of the truth thus the new initiates never know the complete plan.

One only needs to go back 200 years and they will find the entire “civilized” world involved in dark magic and Grimores. Countless novels were written by men who had made pacts with demoniac life forms to represent them and do their bidding.

It is time that we admit we are not dealing with dummies that just need to be voted ou t of office, there is more evidence of a massive plot that need be put to ruin. Leaders like Martin Luther King arose attempting to free the people but still remained trapped to the Religion that did little for those he represente d. The first ship that brought Nubians to America was named Jesus. The most Christianity seemed to do for the Af ricans was make th em more passive brainwashed servants. In fact pacifi st movements always come into pl ay when the people were finally ready to rebel against the oppressor at the cost of their lives. There is a certain power that possesses a person when they are willing to lay down their life so that the ch ildren may have one. This power often preserves the life of the courageous; this is th e true act of unselfishness, a noble deed. After all, the adults that have lived till at least 30 in our current era have seen so much of life already. We have enjoyed what it took lifetimes for our predecessors to experience all in one va cation. We should thus do our duty in carving out a world for the innocent youth who already bare the gifts of the future in their complexly beautiful minds.

The soldier can no longer continue in this pr esent day since he knows what he is doing is obviously not for patriotism. So they now put him behi nd a screen to kill and make it look like a video game as he flies the drone like its on Playstation 3. What he kills no longer brings a feeling since even the victims appear as just white li ght’s or blobs of infrared on the screen in the tank, plane, or battleship. Since the world is now in the information age every soldier has access to Zeitgeist and many more publications revealing the intention behind the hideous wars of the past. This makes him question his role in such disasters since he sees that it is not to protect the co untry that we continue to kill thousands. Since they foresaw this happening th e chemicals already put into the soldier’s diet to keep him subservient were incr eased, he was removed from the frontline and put behind the computer to deal out death still remain ing under the foot of the “Gen”eral.

The Illuminati planned Pro-Peace agen das all over the world to make th e people docile while they put the finishing touches on the New World Order.

When passing by on the street, jogging in a park, walking on th e beach or pretty much anywhere unless people are drinking and then nothing is clear. Truly if we are prepared to see a one-eyed green Alien and accept them be fore we can see our own neighbor who may be of different ethnicity but a Human nonetheless, we have missed the mark. There was a time that if you happen to see another Human while in transit you immediately greeted each other with hugs and ki sses of astonishment as you tried to communicate by first giving gifts and showing them things you had found on your journey as they did the same. You would explain to them the various territories you have crossed, what resources were there, and what to be aware of. Often time s you learned their customs and came to respect their individuality marv eling at how the Creator made things so dive rse. Now that has faded away and people are looked at as ex pendable, some even as worthless by others as ra cism increases. They have forgotten if you have climbed up on the ladder you are in a perfect position to help the person below you. Instead they give them a boot in the face knocking them down further. We must re- establish communication. When you look around you if you see someone is lonely or troubled, speak to them. I find it amazing men will speak with de vils, demons, and brutes but not their own Kin. Reason 27: The unique blend of ethnicities is one of the greatest assets of Earth. We have so many things to share with one another while religion has kept us divided, teaching us not to mingle with one another. Our souls are all unique and none are the same thus we operate as a team with multiple functions endowed with splendor and beauty, it is only the blind that cannot see this .

It beckons one to ask “Are we really in a Matrix”? Can we be pulled out of the Matrix? Is there an actual Code to the Matrix? This book will show beyond the shadow of doubt that the answer to the questions being proposed above is yes, and that is not all. This book will awaken your memory and quicke n you thus causing your DNA to reformulate which I will prove to be possible by the end of th is composition. DNA itself is manipulated by the mental state, surroundings, and acquaintances of th e individual subject. When any these are altered for a constant period the DNA itself also alters an d reformulates according to its environment. This means that once you become firm about what you kn ow to be true, especially about your special abilities that have been dormant, the DNA will reco nstruct itself to make what you will believe again to be possible, happen. That is one of the main secrets of creating th e Superhuman, you have to give it “Reason” to activate itself. This takes consistenc y and as we talked about earlier a firm foundation grounded in truth to what reality is, not what Maya or Illusion attempts to make you perceive. The value of this to your future would be of catamount benefit es pecially in the world of today where knowledge is power. You can thus remove your self from the cubes known as the hexagon or the bee hive.

You will be able to do this without the aid of books and sc holars thus you will be placed back in the driver’s seat of life exiting the checkered cab. The issue we all individually face is that we wait to see what is going to happen next before we react; this is called reactionary. This leaves you with no preparation and little time or ability to shape the future. I say that one sh ould confront danger and fear before they become closed in by it instead of allowing it to greet you on your doorstep while your loved ones are inside. Run and face it so you may prevent it or at least prolong it. This may in fact give those you care for the edge they will need to prepare.

In fact it is more like two lovers who have both fallen asleep on the phone and the lines remain open although there is no one speaking. It is time you begin to unlock all the mysterie s and most importantly yourself. Often I began lengthy writings only to leav e them incomplete, pieces of these writing you will find in Italics throughout the book they serve as tidbits of poetry to ponder. The rabbit hole is far deeper than I expected in the beginning, not to mention the fact that after you get deep into the rabbit hole you must climb back out, which they fo rgot to mention. You do not want to be in any hole, trust me. When you learn the whole system, you will have so much knowledge you will not be incapable of fitting it all in one book. What should be kept in mind is once you start to “unlock” you will see what used to remain hidden, everywhere in plain view. This also means th at everything is not contained here, only the framework that is ne eded for you to build your own ladder out of the Cube of Flesh into the Sphere of Spirit. After that the statement will co me true that if the oceans were ink and the trees were pens you could still not write about ever ything that you will know in fact to be true. With that being said I have done my best to narrow the book down to what is of highest worth to know. It was originally meant to show how words themselves play one of the most valuable roles in your individual awakening. That l ater morphed into a detailed story of our true past, present, and future. Even the Elite cannot simply say “the old la nguage is no good anymore so from today you will use this new language”. That only happened one ti me in history in the confusion of Babel, when tracing the story of Babel or “The Gates of Ishtar ” a far more complex story arises than the brief chapters dedicated to it in the Bible. In the ancien t texts one story holds abou t Babel. This Tower or Ziggurat had multiple purposes and it was also connected to a Gate , the two went hand in hand. In most ancient tribes some type of structure wa s built to serve as the portal of communication between the presiding God/Goddess and the people. You will find a pre cise geometric layout of some type of construction whether stone alter, pillar, temple, hollowed tree, or various other portals. You will learn that the geometric structure, especially its number of sides, has everything to do with the type of energies being evoked and from what dimension, plane, expans e, or abyss they hail from. In Reason 35 you will see a rare picture of pre- historic London now synchromystically called Babylondon. It seems the Atlantian style art deco is preferred. The Py ramids have four sides because they are massive Gates to the 4 th and 8 th dimension. These dimensions although very different from the 3 rd, are functioning and highly populated unbeknownst to the masses.

Mithras Day was December 25. Do you think it would be of value on various levels to at le ast investigate who this individual is? What I find is those who think an inkling about their souls want to prepare it for afterlife. This would mean knowing as much as yo u can about what that involves rather than just imagining that being a servant in the afterlife fo rever would actually be a reward. This is what determines whether or not you end up in a plac e that will mean total freedom, or the opposite. Servants are always slaves to something. It is al ready obvious that our curr ent Overseers seem to be very detached from the people, so this means you mu st build yourself to lear n of the higher things. The future can only be the future for so long and then it becomes the present. Another ploy is the fight we get dragged into all the time with these Two Brother Archetypes that appear in many religious texts whether it’s the Astrological Jupiter Vs Sa turn, Sumerian Allalu Vs Anu, Egyptian Osiris Vs Set, Hebraic Ishmael Vs Is rael, and my all time favori te classic mind job Cain Vs Able. This is the roots of Duality. After reading hundreds of Testam ents, Vedras, Hieroglyphs, St eles, Tablets, and spending months in meditation on what had been gathered a very clear picture began emerge. When this quest began it was in earnest desire to find God. My ideas have never been to disapprove the existence of God or other Beings, only to cre ate a clear path that I may enter in constant communion with them. There can be no benefit in falsely disapproving something that could em ancipate us all. In addition I not only studied these faiths I im mersed myself in them. There can be nothing more unnerving than someone ousting a religion that they have not even st udied, much less participat ed in. What I did also since I was very serious about the quest was I sought to become the highest in each faith I was deluging Reason 35: Ancient London was mo re like a rather large Stonehenge/Atlantis. Few know of this part of London’s history and th e ongoing attempt to restore its sacred layout. Notice the model of Atlantis as seen on the right.

So while I was a Christian, I was a Pastor and Prophet, while I was a Muslim I was also an Imam and Sufi, etc. There can be nothing more positively life changi ng then following the truth even when it goes against everything you have been taught. I believe many headlong in their religion have discovered through one book or another the true origin of their proclaime d faith. At that moment and subsequent times after, the person enters a strong du ality phase. One side insists that it is the Wicked One who is trying to steal their faith. This side te nds to use no facts only emotions barraging a person with memories of past divine experiences. The other side finds constant facts that debunk what the emotional side is suggesting. It often shows that paranormal experience should not be the only gauge of determining if something is true or false, especially positive or negative. Sadly the emotional side tends to win because a person has also gained friend s in the religion, a home or fellowship place, and all these novelties weigh heavier on making the correc t decision to disavow. As a Pastor it was hard for me to walk away from Christianity, however, since I was also infused with the Spirit of Truth it was even more difficult to keep den ying the obvious which was its demoniac esoteric doctrine. Once engulfing the Spiritual terrain there is in deed a common story, it is only the names that change. We will examine this story once and for all because it is the backbone of all belief systems which we will call ME’s (pronounced Mays). Belief Systems and Words are ME’s. In the Sumarian text it talks about something described as only ME’s. If one gains possession of the knowledge of these ME’s they can control large parts of this dimension. All authors on Sumarian religion never present a definition of what these ME’s are just that they are very powerful. It is no ted that the ME is not a weapon, they describe various weapon s that belong to the Gods in the Sumarian text but they are sure to keep the ME’s separate. Th e only hint they give of them is th at they are written on Tablets. The resin of information that remains coated on our Aura of what happened in past existences will always serve as mental triggers for our minds. This is how st ories of the our past is linked to religion in order to bring about devoutness, fear, resonance, and lo yalty under false pretenses .

The Sun awakes the whole world and gets the next day started. The Sun and Son were made synonymous in Englis h because of this. The Babylonia name being Sam, Son of Sam or is it Samson? The Son God religions embed th emselves in the natural occurrences of nature. There is always a Mother so metimes two since we are in a binary system this always leads to one good Mother and one Evil or surrogate mother, Eve and Lilith. The Mother Archetype will always survive because the Planet ca n never be seen as anything different than a nourishing Mother, thus when a na me for the Mother Earth was given all would revere it as they do their physical Mother. The name was spoken as Ga ia then Maia/Maya then a thousand more. Often the Origin of the name was never examined; the people remained always too trus ting of their rulers. The dying and resurrecting Sun theme was all in a days work the Sun died at night and resurrected in the morning. This al ways left the door open for a host of nighttime nightmare creatures that played the role as adversary to the Son, thus the Devil became night/knights or Set as in Sunset still a Sun God nonetheless with a host of worshi ppers that gravitate towa rds darkness. Once this began the idea of a City with eternal light was hatc hed, a place that was never dark and of course there were requirements of how to get there. Those requirements where made known by the numerous Prophets, Shamans, Seers, Holy Men, Gurus, Yogis and various others playing the role of predictors of time. They later became just as re vered and reversed as the God itself . Notice how in Christianity Jesus is now worshipped more than YHVH , many in church don’t even know n who that is nor do they care Jesus has it all covered. In Buddhism there is more discussions about Buddha than the Devine concept of the focal point which Buddha pre sented, this is no wonder sinc e they say his mothers name was Maia/Maya, all around the world the same song. Vari ous sects of Islam suffer form the same problem revering Caliphs, Imams, and Moha mmad more than Ilah at times. The Rabbis get more air time than Ain Soph especially since they ar e convinced “He” is incomprehensible and cannot be conceived by impure flesh. Last but far from least comes the chaos and destru ction. Since mankind is not immortal in this physical state many assume a time will come for ever ything to die thus we fa lsely decree the Earth’s time will come also. It should be obvious by no w the Earth is immortal and passes through various phases. We watch it happen everyday as animals die, bugs die, we age, the house or neighborhood gets rundown. Decay is inevitab le, however, the glass half empty approa ch of modern religion in which the whole world and most of its inhabitants must be ut terly destroyed by plagues and horrors falling from the sky distorts an act that should otherwise be looked at as the entr ance to a Greater Phase. The truth is the heaven and hell these distorted belief system s propose are one in the same. With their Spiritual technologies they have mastered how to keep the soul in stasis, true Spirituality is the growth of the Soul.

The commoner is enticed to a place of wors hip for one reason or an other. The High Priest, however, must understand how it a ll works especially the Spiritual real m. Chanting is a major part of Priestly duties beyond ritualistic observances. What chanting does is bring the body into the frequency of whatever Name is being chanted, once the frequency match is accomplished the portal is open. We are the fifth element being comprised of Earth/Flesh, Water/Mucus, Air/Breathe, Fire/Blood and the Fifth which is the Devine Breath liken unto fire none can produce save th e Most High. Many have tried and reasonless abominations they continue to bring forth wh en “Practicing” as Doctors and Magicians tend to call their Art of non-perfection. One of the real reasons this is happening is the Most High has decreed a ll will eventually return to the Source and it does not exist in time thus it is extremely patient. It al so says it is sufficient enough to rule its Creations and does not need representatives that claim to magnify but in all actuality block the way. If man or woman wanders of f the true Path they easi ly lose focus by being divided amongst Gods vying for power splitting the pe rson’s energy at least 3 ways which they call the Trinity. Instead of following these Gods who want sa crifices and servants all the time I went to look for something that is not as petty and sadistic an d guess what I found it and I’m giving it to you. When you give something good out you get the same in return. That is what we were supposed to do no matter what everyone else is doing. Just reme mber if they don’t know “The Code” their entire form as it exist before you is bein g effected in more ways than you ca n even conceive so you can afford to give those you have grudges against a pass. This is pre-history, however, Gods abound across the globe in various lands and they are increasing. This is because the term God is being used so loosely you even have people saying that they are God. I know the popular argument is God is expe riencing itself through us. This is another one of those things that just sounds good and is neve r questioned. The Most High brought forth all experience from Itself and shared it with us as a gift, there in no need for The Most High to live through us, I’m sure better things are entertainm ent for an All Powerful Being building multiple galaxies with a spiral force than playin g the Sims with Its Human creations. The truth is sayings like this are fuel for the eg o, which can make us thin k a little too much of ourselves while still not in constant contact with th e Most High. We are living in a society where most things related to paranormal and esoteric matters that have been proven are still hidden from us, imagine our maturity rate compared to freed societ ies. With the Entities the stronger eventually becomes the victor and they are warlike Gods. The Most High is not involved in such debased and petty things; this is the key to proper distingu ishment. With the Gods their strength comes in numbers, those numbers are individual Souls who get caught up in the religion and die with it freshly on their mind and aura. Its time you finally get the truth so you can be what your dreams used to say you were when you were a child tr aveling worlds with endless imagination creating things in your perfect undistorted image."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"55 | Page I will make it clear if it wasn’t for the brain sc rewing by those sinister groups that administer Medical Drugs and Procedures, Cartoo ns, Candies, Toys and Education to kids while they are in their most sensitive growing phases, naturally we would ha ve a beautiful world full of joy.

The Word How this all came about this thing we call the Ma trix was through a play of words. Language is the Microsoft Windows or Unix for the brain. The Bible says, “In the beginni ng was the Word”. This did not mean the whole book because it would have read “In the beginning there was a Book” but instead it refers to an actual Word that can create things. This ability is refe renced here in the first book known as Genesis. Since we are in the Image of the Creator we can do smaller versions of the same thing depending upon how well we understand the ability an d how to use it. Although the need to create a new World/Word is now at hand the ga p between creating multiple Worlds and creating the things within worlds is vast, thus the original keepers of this knowledge used this ability to form many things after the first creation; we will ca ll them “Secondary Creations”. These Secondary Creations were not created by the Mo st High but created by the Beings the Most High created, this is of value to remember how to distin guish one from the other. Throug h the real Kabbalah, that 4 letter Word, and its many formulations we re made known to a fe w men and that gave the original man the ability to step onto the level as baby creators. The word Kabbalah itself means Oral Resusci tation which means that the true Kabbalah can only be given verbally due to correct pronunciation of these words of power, it is never written. When this knowledge of such magnitu de came to be known across the land two more Kabbalah’s where introduced, the first being the Abjad, the Arabic Ka bbalah, then came the Kabbalah of Canaan or the Grimores of which the latter can be easily downloaded from the internet, while the former has remained hidden.

To sum up Kabbalah for the reader I will give this explanation. The original oral Kabbalah consist of only one word that masters every spirit en ergy on this dimension. The entire body was put into formulation to pronounce this word. The wr itten Kabbalahs have been proven to a degree to teach the Magus how to control droves of elemental s that can be bent to the will of the Magus, however one should keep in mind that the use of thes e Beings to gain advantage in everyday life rather than doing it naturally always “spells” trouble. It has been documented severa l times that these Beings are very different from Humans, being lower life fo rms they have only one ability, thus their name Elemental meaning simple or base, a controller of one element. They are referred to as Sylphs, Undines, Gnomes, and Salamanders wh ich correspond to Water, Air, Ea rth and Fire. It is known that they often play tricks on the Magus, hiding th ings, and breaking things, which becomes a can of worms that the Practitioner wishes they had never opened, those are the normal experiences. Deeper forms of this Practice have lead to haunting, unknown strangulations and death, as the otherworld will continue to entreat the Magus driving him or her mad especially in Go etia were the departed souls drain the life force from anything alive in the vicinity when evoked, especially the Magus. Reason 43: A classic de piction of a Magician who has evoked too many elementals. The art of magic itself is very real, dark magic is dangerous and leads to encounters that can stunt the Seekers growth. Magicians have been known to also create two part Beings known as Golem to do their biddings, there is now concern in certain esoteric circles in regards to Golem who are said to be revolting because they to are evolving and want to be free. Stories such as Solomon controlling Jinn has fascinated many into be lieving that it is mans right to control the Jinn.

As you notice in Christianity they speak of a Gospel (Ghost Spell) and entreat the Holy Ghost. What business does the church have with these Ghosts? Someone call the Ghostbusters. Again the only one really responsible is the indivi dual person. There is definitely a point of no return and that point is reached at times within th e first ceremony.

For awhile the Ea rth was clear of the Gods , whose chief labor had been for thousands of years to capt ure the Spirits of the recently dead , and make slaves of them for the glory of the lesser kingdoms. Their end was swift just as one rises and falls in power, however, the cursed Magicians invited them back into this realm once more, and the people, ever lacking in reason, welcomed them back by their abhorred ac tions and impurities to no extent. Some of these Beings are further along the evolutio nary cycle than we are, thus they appear as Gods to the primitive. The Art of Deifying or cre ating Gods was perfected in Egypt.

Even the word Bible comes from the word Byblos which is th e place Isis set up worship to mourn Osiris. Likewise Ishtar did the same with Ad onis long before the Holy Bible and King James were thought of. The Hebrews now re fer to their God as Adonai, this is Adonis. Decoding the Bible you will find that all the prophecies are occurring exac tly as they have been fo retold. This is because millions of people believe the proph ecies of the Book will come true due to their religious preference, thus they are actually happening be cause we manifest what we think collectively out of thin air. I for one know that prophecies are for profit and that will become more eviden t later. Many have attempted to authenticate when the Books of the Bi ble were written, after ma ny investigations it was Reason 48: The S aturnalian ritual of the eight sided rectangular box insured the departed soul was transported to their dimension or sealed. It exists today without the slightest notice as people are unknowingly being boxed up and transported.

I once read an ancient transcript of a meetin g that took place between Kings and Emperors in regards to powerful languages. Being a person th at sought to model myse lf after wise men I was curious of why there was such emphasis put on the formation of languages. I soon discovered that language codes and directs the mind and this was known at least since the time of the ancient Arabs although evidence proves way before then. Accordin g to the Bible at the Tower of Babel man faces a confusion of languages by the God and that is the wo rd used, confusion. A few chapters later the same God remarks that He is not the author of confusion. Huh? What is all this about? This made for quite a puzzle for me that made no sense. Parts of the puzzle we will unrave l slowly so nothing is missed. The Ishtar Gate is one of the most controversial relics known to man. Just as th e pyramids are gates, the Gate of the Ishtar also known as the Gates of Ilu were first located in Ur. Th is was the first gate ever constructed to open the Portal of Inanna/Ishtar/Ashtoreth/Astarte/Ash erah/Venus a channel to androgynous vampric serpents and various other life form s that hang out in Club Shemha mphoresh.

The most damaging thing about many languages of today is they are not only backwards “Back Words” as the word indicates but they are also heavily laden with the names of various Deities from our past fetish with Pantheism. It is now evident that many words with certain vibrations pu ll energy while others restore energy; this was shown through water crystals.

This art was blamed on the Fallen Angel Tubal-Cain the Kenite Goat God who in legend ta ught man how to fashion the first sword from a plow share. From that point man looked for anything to make a better weapon to pummel and plunder his brother. The discovery of gun powder and various other explosiv es by the Alchemists produced a fatal time of misuse of energy that cont inues more now than ever. It has also morphed into genetics. Everything is alive so imagine what Radiations character is. Our “Kind” have become fascinated with force, not energy and ability which is entirely different. It can be looked at this way: Some things are passive like steel, we can fashion it into a plow, till the soil, and bring forth abundant food or we can make it into a gun. This is my definition of “Passive Energy”. Then you have things like Mercury and Radiation that have no nurturing assimilation for Human bein gs they are what I call “the Force”. Their use is generally to deteriorate anything they come in contact with. When asking about the various fuels that are used as food for different energies and spirits I learned that first it was Plasma the lower vibration Beings fed on, the wars were fought with swords and the blood was up to the bridle. Many ancient accounts note that the battlefield when war was finished would glow with an eerie light and you co uld see gaseous life forms absorbing the energy of the blood. In time “Ra”diation was in preference, th e nastier the element the more degraded the Host that feed upon it, this is the wi sdom taught by “Es”. Now you see they are using depleted “Ur”anium and you should know enough by now to get the cl ue on where the Hosts that feed on that energy come from. Our history also shows that many have had a fondness for worshi pping and serving rather than mastering and leading. True Spirituality benefits the one who is able to enact such rare talent as communion with the Most High. Wh at remains is religion which fo r the most part borrows from everywhere orthodox faiths and tales of Villains an d Heroes may have sprang up. Where most people get lost is being able to imagine this unseen world is real. The world we live in now is very populated with other forms of life. In history these Beings were given names in which many people, especially those that speak the languages of the Latin Vulgat e, evoke everyday. As the wise men always knew behind your words lies a certain force depending up on how serious you take it. If you speak only idly there are those who take that as an opportunity to release you of your power and use it at their advantage, they understand how it wo rks. Of course the biggest move is to detach you from belief that such things could be possible. The names used for th ese Entities have survived without the slightest bit of notice by the average person, until now. The one that can control the tongue is on the path to controlling their thought, and not before then. Reading a book from the 1800’s in regards to making Spiritual contact will shine light on just how lost and off track many have been. This book proposed that you must wait for the New Moon, burn some wheat, be sure to face the west, wait for a certain star to appear, look up to the heavens and say this prayer while gripping firmly the throat of a frog.

We are now living in a time that it is almost necessary for the religious system to “re-boot” due to the amount of legends, myths, and fables that have been all rolled under the subject of Spiritual Ascension. This book to me was a final effort to get a rope around all the belief systems as they continue to merge becoming more and more diffic ult to weed through and track the origins of. I’m sure that if something is not done now, the future generations will ha ve a very difficult time telling truth from falsehood if this is allowed to cont inue.

I’ve witnessed various al terations to certain topics which take a person completely off the mark of Truth of the topics of high importance. Before we move further I will state again that I’m not at all an advocate of Christianity but it is now a fact that the Catholic and Christian religi ons have restarted a much older design and have introduced it to the world under new packaging. Some addition name changes and a sprinkle of hyperdimensional magic is all that’s needed to misl ead the masses. This makes it of value to dissect certain things that we know about the religion in order to fully perceive what is really going on today. You should keep in mind the amount of followers dedicated to each be lief system thus the direction of energy and how it flows about th e world you currently live in. Although you may have opened your mind to sear ch for whether or not there is more truth out there, many refuse to re ad anything related to the subject of Spirituality. Another portion will not read anything else unless it is the Bible, Koran, or the particular book attached to their Faith such as the Book of Mormon. In fact these religions teach that one should not read anything else less they become lead astray or should they say, led to the real truth. One is looked at as a devil when asking too many questions and they are often rebuked. There ar e the others who get lost in all of the complex disinformation produced in works such as Liber 777 and various other novels that claim to be references on the meaning of esoteric knowledge, its symbols, etc. Besides avoi ding falling asleep while reading these tales one is sure to get the feeling they are following someone who has no eyes, guide dog, or cane, they bring a whole new meaning to lost.

Caravans would collect this su bstance and peddle it as secret salts at values higher than Gold. This is th e legendary Salt worth more than Gold. This is also why the Pharaoh’s entombed themselves in Gold and were found in bask reliefs consuming it or being offere d it by the people in cones. It has always been the most common standard for currency despite the introduction of more expe nsive metals such as Titanium and Platinum. Gold symbolizes the Lion who you even hear R”oar”. The Hebrew word “Ori” means golden light, and there is also the “Or” and “Ori” in Orion the most known part of our galaxy next to the Milky Way.

What you search for first is the smallest word of importance that you can think of let’s take for example: JAIL. Now it is actually the guttural to ne and key spelling that you are searching for as everything is a vibration. That would then make the wo rd, JAEL. It is of value to go to this extent so you can see all the words that are not so positive but used everyday as such. So let us begin. AEL- Ale: This is the wo rd for the intoxicating mind numbing dr ink of poison bluntly and rightfully called Spirits. BAEL-Bail: This is not only one of the main Deitie s of the Babylonians but also the term used when you need to get released from JAIL you must be bail ed out by the bail bondsm an. It also means to run like never before. CAEL- The “K” and the “C” make th e same sound when solo thus there is a more deeper meaning not to mention “X” can be manipula ted to make this same vibration . What you have here is one of the most dangerous words. KAEL, KILL, to temporarily terminate life. DAEL-Deal: Of course everyone l oves a deal but this is what got us into the financia l mess we are in now. Think of this, in antiquity there was such abun dance barter was not even the form of transaction it was giving. We had no reason to even keep food because it grew everywhere and we loved it fresh, especially when we were on the right diets. No wheeling and dealing. EAL-EL or L: As you see this is the keyword, it is also a one Letter word which makes it a “Core Word” when pronounced. The bible sa ys “and the Elohim said, let us make man in our image”. This is the controller of the Matrix from multiple angles pe rsonifying itself as variou s Deities. L is also an upside-down 7 which is the sacred number of most belief systems.

GAEL: The Gael with their mystical Ogam script can be found in various parts of interesting history as their leader Wooten was known to discover Amer ica and parts of Canada setting up trade routes before Columbus was thought of. Wooten is where our word Wednesday or Wooten’s Day comes from. This is also the name given to a destructive wind. HAEL- Hell Hail: Again besides its obvious meaning, this is also a term used to salute various high rank officials’ especially in th e German army. Since in ancient ti mes you would name your forces according to where their power “hailed” from. As yo u see in the Bible they sa y the good Angels come in Myriads and the bad Angels come in Legions. Wh at would it mean to re-legion? Would this not mean to gather more troops to a previously depleted Legion? Even deeper how did their Legions become depleted anyway? Could it be that that variou s beings such as the Ve nusians had been defeated before and fled to our Galaxy? I beli eve so and that is why we have to make sure to not join their ranks and if we know we have joined them through one folly or another, disavow. IEL- Ill: As in not well, sick, like the so-cal led Illuminated Illuminati and their Illusions. JAEL- Pathetic these losers are using magic to impris on people thus most criminals are really victims. The Code is so heavy it is a wond er we all aren’t insane criminals even though many are and silently act it out in their mind or on video games.

QAEL-Quail-Still wondering why this is the state bird of California? RAEL-Real: This is as real as it ge ts as you see you are on the target, th is is what is really going on not the Illusion and of course their latest addition to unguided Spiritual mayhem, Rael, who is most assuredly down with the diabolical plan inciting his followers to all out blasphemy and hedonism. In this condition they can do little for the world."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80 | Page SAEL-Sale-Seal: What you will find wi th the Serpent energy since each “S” is a symbol for a serpent like Hitler’s SS. Cracking the Co de when you come to the “S” words, Swords, they always are deeply embedded with meaning. Now Sale an d Deal go together and that make s business, the art of swindling our poor fellows. On the other hand when it comes down to it magical Seals are the most powerful. The purpose of a Seal is to close something in thus trapping it to do bidding or holding it so it won’t escape. Solomon’s Seal which is the Star of David was designed to do just that, trap things. When Solomon would Seal Jinn in bottles he would put th e Star of David on top. Once again you can see that even Metatron’s cube which has hit the #1 spot in Sacr ed Geometry is none other than a hex used time and time again to keep souls which are seekin g higher truth passing back and forth between this demented dimension and Saturn. It is a mental weak ening tool as many have already admitted since its main purpose is only to weaken the cube it should never be placed in the mind. Reason 61: The Country of Canada is actually funding Rael to go about his Ministry of basically “do whatever you want there is no God”, just another hedonist cult on the surface however because they are linked with Thule as you can see by their Medallions I knew they had to be up to more. Sure enough they run an actual baby cloning facility where a mother who has suffered a miscarriage can actually have the baby. They use the Blood and DNA of the deceased baby and make a new one. Of course this is a very expensive proce dure so they attract very wealthy candidates. This is like the movie Omen wher e these evil babies were put into wealthy households to later control major companies. Earthi er way this is big time E.T. action Rael has at least a dozen surrogate mothers on staff wait ing to hatch a baby. Th eir website promotes all of this, no legal problems whatsoever, pure Zionis t breaking all the rules they enforce."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"81 | Page TAEL-Tale- Tail- We come to our favorite Reptilian appendage the ta il along with the word always used for the erroneous stories we are told especially as children i.e. Fairy Ta les, Wives Tales, and Tall Tales. VAEL-Veil: A very powerful word fr om my point of view, this is wh at creates the Illusion. The world walks about Veiled meaning unable to see the truth. WAEL-Wail-Whale: To continuously cry and our aq uatic friends known to originate on the Aquatic Moon Europa and also Sirius along with Dolphins. YAEL- Yale-Yell: To scream and also the famous Un iversity which still has th e Seal of the Urim and the Thummim, the ancient Hebraic Rune Stones. These are objects of magic used by the Levite Priest. This is also the home of Skull and Bones code number (322) March 22 turn of the Equinox. Reason 62: The knowledge of the organic cube was taken from Egypt now given the title the Flower of Life. The Egyptians used this to visually encase matter within in it. Then it was used to move things, especially large objects, around with their minds. Meditati ng on this Geometric Shape incorrectly will help solidify the Cubic frame of the body we are already trapped in thus it is not the chariot. The real purpose for these shapes is an Art ca lled Tesseract, which is the shape you see on the right. This is for bringing things into this dimension from the 4th. 6 Protons 6 Electrons 6 Neutrons, our body is the Carbon stru cture of the Cube, the Beast, but not our Spirit. The Flower of Life later became Metatron’s Cube when the lines were made straight."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 | Page ZAEL-Zeal: It is noted in the Bible a man named Phin ehas showed “Zeal” meaning in this case lots of aggressive energy to rain destruction upon the Gentiles and go to murder for God and this was shined upon. There are numerous ancestral tr ibes with an abundance of blood on their hands. If we chose to follow their religions we will share their same fate. Keep in mind ma ny indigenous tribes claim to learn the worship of the serpent from Atlantians wh o arrived on their coasts with abnormal powers after the destruction of their city in the late month of Aether wh ich is our October, Aeth is pronounced, Eight. October is our 10 th month but Octo means eight. This shows you how purposely off the Gregorian calendar is. As I sa id above 2012 is happening now. As you see with this simple (4) letter word th at we have examined there is a lot more to be extracted from language. Due to the Truth itself ne ver being written nowhere near its entirety, this provides one of the only ways to extract the manifold story of wh at happened here on Earth, it survives in the language. Societies like the Druids never wr ote anything down thus everything of value Reason 63: The Name was placed under the Breastplate and would cause it to glow opening communication to the Tetragrammaton. Lucifer also had his body encrusted with special s tones ."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"83 | Page was committed to memory. As it stat es in several places the memory banks of man and woman were a lot more vast then they are now, they did not have to write things down. Even looking in Egypt it has been discovered that even the Hieroglyphs where a product of latter times in Egypt, the original inhabitants left no written record s just Djedhi Priests. This lend s more credit to the results of magnetic shifts which is extensive memory loss. I beli eve if a person does not have a strong sound aura, magnetic shifts can erase most past, present, an d future information pertaining to the person. People that can really see Aura s can read things off a persons Aura, not just the mood of the person. It is known that information like where they have been, who their descendants are, and various other deeply enligh tening things about their character. When examining the controllers of this system I did come across extens ive information indicating that pole shifts could now be caused by the technology in their possession which had been used before in previous times to reverse the effects of a natural pole shift. Seeing 2012 line up as the Zionist Code it would indica te not only the ability to possibly cause shifts but also the ab ility to traverse the space time continuum. Most make the mistake of calculating what everyone in the world is capable of based on their personal intelligence level not realizing there are men who spend their every waki ng moment solving complex problems of Quantum Physics and various forms of Scienc e. One who spends their time in the club and drinking should not believe they are on the same caliper as these grea t minds, that is the ego that would believe such foolishness. It makes sense that they are doing noth ing in vain and have trul y discovered something far beyond the imagination of the common slacker. Reason 64: Our Ance stors had at times larger brains and greater memory capacity. This is never talked about because of course it would destroy the Th eory of Evolution. These skulls date back millions of years ago. The Bible starts the fi rst Creation of man at roughly 8,500 years ag o, what a hindering lie. Sometimes when you are dreaming you may even see people you knew in elementary school however if you are asked while conscious if you remember them in such detail the answer for most will be no. Because so many quadrants of the brain are powered down ultimately most people are walking about with a ba d case of amnesia. When one forgets who they are they become clones behaving like everyone else."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 | Page These topics are never covered and our strictly ou t of the box. A long debate will go on amongst individuals questioning whet her or not time travel is possible. Sometimes they will go a little deeper and report things like the Phila delphia Experiment where it was pu rported a major project took place to create a jump hole between 1 940 and 1980 approximat ely. Few ever make it to the point of questioning what was being done with this “Time Gate ”. Let us ask the questi on, with the ability to traverse time still under the laws of physics wh at would the Elite want to change? That is a big question but to me there is one simple answer, they would want to make them selves rule as long as possible and anything that could disrupt that they would thwart somehow as long as possible. Reason 65: The date 2012 is actually the numeric Code for Zion used across encrypted machines like the German Enigma and the Code of the Psyconaut. The 2 is a Z, S, or N as you can see the obvious similarities, the 01 is binary and can be interchanged and finally th e N. Tis true they will reach completion at least by 2012 although 2010 is the “vivid” beginning of the shift. The Elite used Zion as the logo for the Olympics scheduled for Babylondon in 2012. They are bluntly pushing forward."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85 | Page We will talk a little of traversing space and time and how one can get in a position to even be able to accomplish such a feat unle ss they were Spiritually incline. It is known that if you are carrying a low vibration you cannot physically travel through higher vibratory fields wi th the body, obviously, but you can get to other Planes, Pl anets and various territories with capable ships. This is what is meant by the term “External Merkab a”. When the space race began it was Russia and th e U.S. Let us start looking at all of the Russian Territory known as “the Great Bear” as under one very divisive Monarchy in which the people are expendable. Let us include even Germany in this although many think the Russians don’t like the Germans that was so mething created by their mutual governments to formulate a plan of divide and conquer which the Elite do everywhere, they are all still Aryans. VENE VINI VECE we just call it “The V”. Reason 66: On the left a fresh ju mp gate installed right outside of downtown Detroit without the least bit of curiosity, of course who’s looking at Detroit these days . On the right the jump gate on Stargate SG1 equipped with Enochian writing. You should begin to see how fact and what seems at times to be fiction blur together. Everything we can think does in fact already exist. Reason 67: Russia, a long standing Occult and Technological Powerhou se made it to the Moon first with ease. Their space technology was far more superior than the U.S. as they had already made deals with the Gizans. One would need to keep in mind Russia had one of the first Inner Circles. True they lost many people in depressions and civil wars but their Elite continued to increase their ranks, again, the people are expendable to them. Lennon, Trotsky, Stalin, Gorbac hev, Putin and many others fed from Mother Russia like Vampires at a blood bank. Not to mention that’s where those that choose Plasma as their diet get it from, no time to be hunting people in the night when you have to be in a fortune 500 meeting in the morning."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 | Page The race was to the moon, as they say. One sh ould start thinking what was really happening on the Moon since we know a silly race isn’t the reason these two Juggernauts take off on a goal. Furthermore trust they would use every “Channel” th ey could to be sure they could make the trips with the least amount of error. They would need star maps, statistics, temperatures, pressures, permissions and various ot her guides. Many think we just logically came across this information through trail and error which would create enormous time issues for explaini ng how fast we prepared for the mission. Here is what really happened. In the Spiritual circles of Thule during Third Reich NAZI Germany the greatest magicians of all time had come together. Blavatsky was only a co mponent of this group. Me n like Dietrich Eckart, who trained Hitler, where far above her. Madame Bl avatsky possessed an array of esoteric goodies she picked up from the Black Tibetans during her trip to Agharta/Shamba llah. In such a male dominant society Blavatsky entransed the mind of various key individuals with obviously not her physical charm. Books writing her off as a quack are disinformation. She begins her Book “Isi s Unveiled” with a stout beginning making her allegiance in BATH KOL ISIS known. Reason 68: Madam Petrova Blavatsky mother of the Society of Thule recruited the best Magicians of the time. She made contact with th e Black Tibetans known as the “Green Gloves” found later scattered throughout defeated Nazi Germany in houses where they had committed mass suicides. The “Green Glove s” were hyperdimensional Ti betan Masters. They showed Blavatsky Shamballah/Agharta, th e Inner world. She made the pa cts with them and thus the T hird Reich became the heav y instrument of the D ark Tibetans all ali g ned with the Gizans."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"87 | Page This is how the Swastika of the Black Sun got into circulation in Germany. Since once again we are in a binary world we also have another Sun direct ly on the opposite side of this Sun. You have to be in special locations to see it, th ey refer to it as a Sun Dog. The Black Sun is the opposite energy, a taker of life for strength rather than a giver. Ma dame Blavatsky had Master El Morya, St. Germaine, Koot Hoomi, Sanat Kama ra, Sananda, Aliester Crowley, McGregor Mather, Frater Achad, Krishnamurti, Leadbetter, and Besant all Immortal Masters of Astral Travel and devoted members of Great White Brotherhood. With this arsenal Thule hatched a deeper plan in conjunction wi th the Paranormal Division of the Third Reich. Deros, their co ntact who wrote the new Emerald Ta bles of Thoth, dwelled in the underground city of Agharta. The Pa ranormal Division was said to receive more funding than Hitler’s total Armament Division due to its importance to the Reich. They lay burdened with the task of gathering all the powerful Shrines from around the world which eventually ended up in the vaults of the British Museum. Those who have done study on holy artifacts will note that most of them are in the British Museum, not in their original place of or igin, they won’t allow it. Many of these objects do strange things when placed back on their corresponding leylines. It is known yo u can only get into the vaults of the British Museum if you are a memb er of The Golden Dawn. The Golden Dawn was a Society setup by Thule in which Aliester Crowley was made head of, he ha d Frater Achad as his apprentice. Crowley and Mathers were always in comp etition with one another, this is how Blavatsky penned them against each other to broaden their potential. Th ese two Adepts birthed the greatest horrors mankind has witnessed in this era. Many of their works were publis hed by Blavatsky’s Lucis Trust, again another obvious clue she was part of the Lu ciferian agenda. Reason 69: Rare images of a Sundog, the view of our Binary Sun sometimes even appearing as three suns. These are government facilities fully s taffed located far away from civilization on the poles which are the only places you can see this phenomena. These places don’t get visitors often and if they do they are not civilians."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88 | Page Aliester was far more sadistic then McGregor it was he the Beast decided to incarnate in. That did not go without the key use of Mc Gregor who had a gift for language s. McGregor was set to the task of translating the Keys of Solomon from ancient He brew to Latin and Englis h. This had never been done and it was awaited by every Magician of the time, especially since not many had access to the libraries in the British Museum. Afte r translation McGregor’s life was very short and his scribe admits he had been affected by some curse which the book even warns of called the “Reflux Current”. Dan Brown is schedule to release his rendition of The Keys of Solomon to follow up his Angels and Demons. I sure hope you are off th is Plane when this hi ts the media and people in their curiosity download the original book, which is also availabl e for free. The Beast has incarnated in several men such as Jack Parsons the creator of the nuclear bomb who was also a Satanist, Albert Pike the 33 ̊ Mason responsible for bringing new forms of the co rrupted Brotherhood to th e U.S. and of course Crowley who set Leviathan free. As they completed the circle of ce remony all was silent, everything th at needed to be said was said, the order, perfect, the incense, in me asure, the offerings received, in ve stments they waited and as time past they assumed the ritual to be barren. Then th ere was a flash of energy as the portal opened, a green trapezoid, many collapsed with the sudden ch ange in temperature as the deep cold permeated the room, they had done it, they had unleashed the Ancient Forbi dden One. What ha ve they done, they have released Leviathan who is C”thul”u. Aliester Crowley’s ritualistic experiments in Loch Ness. Reason 70: The Holy Grail and the Spear of Longinus, which was said to pierce the side of Christ, where both seized by Hitler. These artifacts are ch arged with energy due to the belief millions of people put in them. Childhood st ories of Knights, Princesses, an d Dragons all serve to mold the mind for future indoctrination. Most of these it ems had much different hi stories. The real Grail was not even the Chalice it was a succession of women carrying pure bloodlines, like Mary."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"89 | Page I will take a moment to elaborate on this book th e Keys to Solomon since I personally believe it will play a huge role in th e reality shift of this dimension for a few reasons. When Dan Brown released The Davinchi Code it was instantly a Best Seller , meaning the media pushed it to the top fast. He followed up with Angels and Demons and that solidified his career, th ey had the perfect Puppet Icon. Anything else he releases people are going to swarm to. They warm ed everyone back up again when they did the Davinchi Code Movie with everyone’s favorite Mr. Forest Gump Tom Hanks. This gave Dan more prestige. Now they are finished with th e Angels and Demons movie and the subtitle is Revenge of the Nephalim which you can do your own b ook on all of what that entails by now. So next of course will be the Keys to Solomon. The original book, the Key to Solo mon, does not read like a story book it is strictly Talismans, Prayers, Repentances, Evocations, and illustrations of Ceremonial Magic. It is not wise to speak against anything you do not understand. This book I Innerstand very clearly as a horrible danger. Why? During the time I was a fresh Pastor I was fa scinated with Solomon, he was who I chose as my Archetype as many men of the cloth often do. Solomo n has all the wisdom and most affectionately all the ladies, something abolished afte r Solomon’s time but still it allo ws the deprived Pastor to dream a little. I wanted to read everything Solomon wrote especially since it actually says in Proverbs Solomon wrote over 5000 books. I wondered why if So lomon wrote 5000 books we only had (3) Psalms, Proverbs, and the Song of Solomon one of which was not written by Solomon but by Lemuel. Some say Lemuel, Solomon, and Jedidiah were all the same person. I began to search and came acro ss two more books, The Testaments of Solomon and the Keys to Solomon. Both were full of demons. In th e Testament of Solomon, Solomon is actually interrogating demons under the powe r of the Ring which he says was given to him by YHVH. The Keys to Solomon had the names of demons inscribed in the Talismans that it instructed you to make. Of course I didn’t know the name s were those of Demons failing to do the translation from Hebrew to English at the moment in addition my Dictionary of Angels by Gustav was still on the way. But that wasn’t going to stop me from exploring a li ttle of Solomon’s wondrous Talismans eh. Reason 71: Left to Right Crowley, Pike, and Parson the fleshly Hosts of the Beast."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90 | Page In short after doing all of the rigorous work of constructing a Talisman for wisdom this is what happened. First I will note that some of the ritu als in the book involved animals blood which made me think a little deeper about So lomon, however, their were plen ty that did not involve blood and since there was also a warning in the beginning of the book about using anim als blood I came to the terms that someone had maliciously put the spells th ere since they were towards the back of the book. When I would fall asleep with the Talisman or B ook around me I would be transported to another world. Once I realized I was watchi ng the dream I could begin to cont rol it thus starting the lucid phase. From there some monstrous form would appear and we would do battle of which I noticed the Seals from the Key to Solomon played a heavy roll in trapping these Demons once they had been subdued. Sustaining any kind of bl ow from them would resu lt in real physical damage in this world. On one occasion a Demon got hold of me and slam med me before I could br eak the dream. When I woke up I had the pain and the bruises, after th at I learned not to get grabbed. All along I was imagining I was doing the Lords work, in the Army now. The dreams could always be broke by Holy Names in which I kept a complete arsenal in memory. I also noted their where a lot of other people there all invol ved in doing something in this strange world full of Spirits. The Demons got bigger and bigger and I se emed to get better and better at dealing with them and then the Dictionary arri ved. I was horrified to find that the Talismans contained the names of Demons. Wh at I now know is that all the De mons I was fighting I had evoked and if I had lost they could have done damage to my soul . I will tell the reader now, I was born on the 22 nd which is a Master Number so I have a buffer that allows me to dissect these things without immediate danger to my soul due to positive intent, however, I kn ow beyond doubt many have been taken by this book, maybe my work about it will reach the peoples ha nds in time so they can steer clear of it. Back to the plans of Thule. With the Talismans of Solomon in hand they began to travel the opposite Plane which anyone trained in Lucid Sleep ca n do. In this Plane you can go to various places and the main feature is you can call forth Beings and they appear. Apparent ly they called forth the Enochian Enchained sons of Cain and they appeared to them. They consulted with them about world domination and how it could be br ought about. They gave them firs t a special language of power to use amongst themselves in conjunct ion with Vril power. They gave them the strategy for using young minds as processors in (“Universe City’s) Universities. The idea wa s to use the brightest minds to develop devices to create external Merkaba. This vehicle could be us ed to travel dimensions, a real time machine. The alchemis t became the physicist. Following this in the “seen” wo rld we find Germany at the head of jet propulsion technology. The Allies and Axis where in the bed together behind the scenes, but in plain view they pretended to be enemies. The Black Su n Cults, White Brotherhoods, Lucife rian, Saturnalian, Atlanteans, and Venusians all had a mutual cause, Galactic domination.

In many of the ancient paintings it shows what appears to be Spaceships in the atmosphere during the crucifixion of Jesus. Those ships bare the 8 pointed Star of Ilu. These Ilu are very advanc ed, which is why they co ntrol the world. Jesus was a “NAZA”RITE a special sect of whom Samson and almost all Prop hets of the Bible belonged to; this is the Rites of NAZA who all le ave this world at 33 years old. The part of the Oath of the Nazarite is to never cut your hair. Samson and Jesus both left the world at Age 33. When the German Scientists came to the U.S. they joined up with NASA the “S” of course is a backwards “Z”. They formed the new NAZI party wh o now have many angles they work from because they have unlocked the ability of hyperdimensional travel. Always remember the technology they show us in the open is the old stuff, look how long the Militar y was using microwave technology before they decided to let everyone else give it a spin introducing the Microwave into the home. When the Microwave hit the market people were amazed, look how fast it he ats things, at a price of course, “Ra”diation which will always cause some form of cancer or tumor most times undetected. This means large pro-peace movements similar to the times of the Hippies may have been removed from our memories. There may have been a lot more uprising in history then currently Reason 73: The Hyperdimensional Being known as Aiwass channeled through Crowley gave him a coded language of power to us e amongst the Psyc onauts which they came to be known as. Aiwass is also the sign of the Single Bolt in Ancien t Germanic which can be found in (Letters and Numbers). Aiwass was the classic “Gra y” alien sent by the dark side as an extraterrestrial imposter. They are more similar to Golem, two part Beings created by So rcerers that just follow orders.

Five senses, 5 fingers on ea ch hand etc. There is an actual seam running do wn the middle of the body showing we are two five fold sides put to gether. What is happening now is most people are operating on 3 senses versus the 5 senses they thin k they have. How this occurs is many people think they see but in fact they are not seeing true reality just illusion , some taste but they need seasoning to even enjoy the food not to mention the kind of f ood they eat for nourishment. Some would rather talk thus they don’t hear well, and others touch but don’t feel the energy of what they are examining. For each person the mixing and matc hing is different. The drawback is if we can’t operate on all five senses not only can we not “unlock” the 6 sense, which is how you feel when all five senses are being used at their height simultaneously. In additi on it takes the six senses to unlock the 7 th and so on. As explained above the perception of va rious dimensions is within the am ount of senses you have. A good example of this is when the 3 rd eye is open you are immediately perceptive of another dimension. To clarify the statement of many languages bein g backwards I will bring forth a few facts: Fact one is that all holy languages, as they are called, like Arabic, Hebrew , Amharic, Aramaic, and Sanskrit are written from right to left. Engl ish, Latin, French, and Spanish, also known as the Latin Vulgate, are all written in the opposite direction from left to right. The reason for this is the direction you read and write plays a heavy role in th e direction your mind is moving since the mind turns more of a wheel in thought. Also this effe cts what side of the brain you pred ominantly use. Many of the words in these languages, especially the Vulgates, when looked at backwards or sounded out the vibration when taken literal gives you the actual origin of th e word and its manifold in volvement in the erosion of the intelligence of the Human race. AMOR is the word for love in Spanish. AMOR is the son of Venus. When you look at it backwards it spells ROMA which is of course ROME. This proves that when you turn the word backwards you don’t get the opposite meaning you just get more of the me aning. That is another valuable key to learn. Since letters are truly Numb ers lets say ABC is 123. No matter how you move the words around it will still equal 6. In English LOVE comes from JOVE wi fe of Jupiter. We can conclude a J is also an L just facing the other direction. At times what will be uncovered will be shocking and hard to believe, if you remain patient and strengthen your courage you wi ll see that this will become the ke y to your emancipation and self empowerment. The system in place redundifies to the lowest degree, once you are on the trail you will find multiple connections. The Art of magic itself involves an accurate syst em that cannot be altered too much or else it will have no effect. Much power lies in repetition this is why so many words are often spelled the same, but each is given a different me aning to increase its use. For this reason it is easier to spot them once you know the basic parame ters does this make sense, since, cents, sins?"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 | Page If you may think for one moment that your mi nd is not directional consider for a moment that the eyes see everything upside down first.

As we may at time s forget we are actually standing on a globe that rotates and our feet are stuck to it by gravity less we ju st float off in space so in fact we are at times up side down. If we are only using the tw o eyes as a gauge to authenticating higher life forms we will remain disappointed at our discoveries, on e must use other abilities in conjunction with their eyes. Such as the third eye or Pineal Gland. Most have calcified Pineal Glands due mainly to fluoride intake, meat, processed starches and artificial sugars. To reverse this one will need to ingest good amounts of Gota Kola, Alfalfa, Parsley, Wood Betony, an d Mugwort. Gota Kola is by far the most effective of all these. Reason 79: The eyes are easy to be tricked, in fact ma ny places in our Matrix have Optical Illusions over them so you cannot perceive what is really there with you naked eye. As seen in folklore they often spoke of hidden doorways to other dimensions. Focus your eyes on the dot in the center of this Illustration.

There Worlds have run far longer than most can fathom especially since we have a hard time remembering what we did last Saturday. I call this the war against the machines except it didn’t involve the Terminator it was the Terminal they used. The computer has the feature of a huge memory bank. I’ve seen computer hard drives into the Terabytes which is at least 999 Gigabytes. The Cray 6, a government computer, ha s in its memory banks the dial tone of every phone in the United States. It’s funny that to our ears when you pick up the phone the tone sounds the same as any other phone but in fact they are all different. Part of what is happening to our short term me mory, which is very important because it makes the transfer to our long term memory, is we stor e on computers everything we should remember on our own thus our memory wilts down because it is unused. Even numbers of our close family members are stored in the phone memory banks not our personal memory. Now people change numbers so much it becomes no use in remembering their number. When we stop logging numbers and watching them, an entire would of fact is clos ed to us. If you could w atch the random numbers of the day your every step would be guided in perfection. Numbers are what we call the “Master Language” there will always be a 1,2,3 in every cultur e thus it is the stronges t language. As you see in the Kabbalah and the Abjad there exist numeric magi cal cubes, boxes that equa l the same amount no matter which way you add them. In short we lost the battle of the machines on various levels, this is Reason 80: When looking at Gates like the one pictured in Reason 66 in Detroit you will never see anything enter or exit the Gate they remain on a frequency none detectable by the eye, this is not ve ry hard, they have mastered invisibility because of the inaccuracy of the two eyes, the Third Eye however cannot be easily fooled.

There is no reason for one to accept the truth of the future if they want to remain on Earth, thus they will believe nothing you tell them. Th ese people are making plans for several years in advance as if they knew of the hour We would release their so uls. Many make plans in vain their highest goals are riddled with limits and they have forgotten that we are not the body. We shall put a barrier betwixt them so none may cr oss, on one side they will see what they forfeited and on the other they can see what they escaped, contemplate this in wisdom. Real Gurus travel the Buddhic and Devachanic Planes that many already inhabit, they are doing the bidding for the Beings who control the Regions. They’ve promised to serve them during their initiations. I’m speaking here of the initiated Yogi, Guru, Llama, etc. as far as the Pastors the Holy Ghost suffices for them and the Witches ha ve their 13 Covens. Paranormal feelings and experiences do not denote that you have reached the True Path and one should carefully access all of what is happening in the surroundings when they begin to occur, especially in the future, they will be widespread as many activate. Due to the level of mind control and suppr ession of thought many individuals never get the opportunity to truly ponder this stuff in fear th at they may be struck by lightening for offending the Gods thus they beco me stuck on the step of what appears to be an enormous religious Pyramid fully animated. I’ve wanted at times to feel the charge of lightening so I will present the facts and you remain as the judge. Reason 82: Many people have confused Spirituality with monetary prosperity in which the two are almost complete opposites. Consumption is the enemy of compassion. If you notice the main trait we have been given as Humans is reason, this keeps us from acting like insects and animals being at times purely instinctual. When one charges money to give a Seeker knowledge they are in gross error and the Truth will elude them even if it is in plain view, many will not believe this. Their deeds are written thus We will declare them back faithfully to them on that Day in which it will be too late to balance. That day comes for everyone at some point it is the only guarantee in this world."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"101 | Page It becomes obvious that if the Gods could do some thing about this world to make it better they would have done it a long time ag o before many innocent humans an d animals have pe rished many of whom are now extinct. I feel I am in the position to make these statements because I have traveled many paths to their completion somehow escaping the irreversible initiations. As many great men have put it, if you need to be in itiated into it, it cannot be whol esome for the people. Was not our first command to give freely of what is the best for us to our neighbor who ar e like mothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers to us? So why keep a secret from them? Indeed these men and women have something that needs to be kept a secret due to its abhorred nature. Reason 83: There is an inclination within us all, no matter how minute, that wishes to be part of something mystical and elite. These leechers of life feed upon that craving that exist within us as a residue of who we really are, ex cept they distort the image to their favor. A Midget standing on a giants shoulder can see much further than the Gi ant however if the Giant fails to see the Midget below him the Midget will be tram pled beneath his feet. Joining se cret societies always gets one trampled.

At great lengths I wanted to believe the wo rld was perfect because “G od” was perfect and this was the highest form of teaching. Th en true knowledge rebutted and said we are the active creation in which the Creator passes knowledge through, if we ca n no longer see what is in plain view and use our senses to react against it, if it be judged harmful to innocence, then we have forfeited our gift which is the right of good choice. The Creator is perfect howe ver the creation is started from a state where it must learn perfection amongst many other things. Part of the practic e is repairing society with the ability that is bestowed upon us. One may write, paint, teach, scul pture, speak, fund, volunteer, and many more things to bring about pe rfection that will at least reflect on their own personal self which is the world, but we cannot sit back an d do nothing, this is insolence. We have above us now rulers that are killing everything we love with their filth like oil. Has one sat down lately and thought about how many family members and close friends we have lost to this system from all the diameters it take s hold of such as its medical pois ons? They are the real causalities to a silent war that takes place on the battlefield of Illusion where we sometime s forget to look around us to see those that have fallen. It is easy to ignore it as long as it wasn’t someone that you may have known, but when it is your Uncle that gets called to the meaningless war, your Aunt who dies in the Twin Tower Ritual, your Sister wh o gets abducted into a Cult, your Brother who overdoses, or your Baby who is born deformed due to the chemicals they gave you as the Mother, then you feel like doing something, and it is then you will find you are alon e. No longer do we rally together I saw a woman speak to a stray dog and then look at me and say nothing. Reason 84: Their Oath is to k eep silent; the ritual keeps the Oath in place.

Hope fully we find others who know this strange land less we perish in it with no story of our existence. My Pre-Adamic Life A little old lady that did everything the Bible told her to do had an issue with God. Good old Mother Love was praying for the inno cent girl next door to be healed but instead the little girl got sicker and God forbid, she died. Being a Pastor I was faced with dealing with this situation. Of course the ones who play the role as Spiritual leaders are ta ught to stay on their toes and have some default answers always ready. If all else fails a solemn “It is Gods Will” will suffice but of course you only use that one in emergencies, creativity is key. Adding more fluff I came up with “Everything is by the will of God and He does what He pleases which will ulti mately work out for the good because everything God does is good”, nice one eh? Since God does both good and evil as it states in the Bible what can you really do but just hope they haven’t read that one and co me back wanting more answers. Most Christians have never read the complete Bible thus they lack the big picture. When th ey get into the vicinity of the Pastor it’s seldom question time just time to shake hands and smile. P”raise” the Lord brother! Why would the Lord need to be raised? Could that be what the final plan is, to raise thei r Lord, we will see. Reason 85: The silent battle still goes on with oil. The Elite have placed war and disease at the forefront while the contamination still continue s in the background. The Arabs discovered oil looking for water, how ironic, be fore then they considered the desert cursed. After they found the oil they perceived it as a gift from their God to make them rulers of all lands especially over their brother Israel thus they suffer from mental delusion and greed prostrating ritualistically at 90 degrees as if We hear them not knowing the Most High examines the Heart and the knowledge of man is foolishness on Height."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"104 | Page I learned default answers that I picked up along the way from other Ministers that were quite sinister. Of course I had to learn all these things if I intended to be a good Pastor and bare fruit. We will skip for now that the Christian God is a male which is the obvious clue that it isn’t the Most High. The Ultimate Creator being gendered is erroneous seei ng that it would have to be way more than a He or She to create multiple universes, but we will go with it for now not wanting to begin digging into history “His Story”. So this God did not find it important to save a family from grief and increase an old ladies faith. He would rather not heal the child and leav e the old lady hanging on a limb which made no sense to me. We will examine what happens here more closely as we take this journey together into the doghouse. I would like to state that it is clear th at only one of two things are happening. Either the God cannot do it because of lack of power or it does not want to just wave its hand and remove the problem for some unknown and strange reason called the W”ill”. After all, th e God described in the Bible has so much power it can just wa ve its pinky and poof a better world. The easier route would of course be to heal th e child, which would build the old ladies faith even more, thus possibly convincing the parents of the sick child to attend church. But that is often what does not happen in fact seld om any real miracles anymore, but lots of new cars, why? My personal favorite was always “God gave me a new car” I would think oh really did he give you a gas card for that new Hummer to? As you can see Pastor Bomær just wa sn’t cut out to carry the cloth after awhile and if I hadn’t already made con tact with Shekinah and va rious other unexplained Beings, by that point I would have been out the d oor. Due to the paranormal experiences I had with Reason 86: The Phoenix is used in the Occult Sy mbolism due to a hidden st ory of all the Saviors that have descended to the Unde rworld will rise and return.

The Americ an eagle was going to be a Phoenix but this was deemed too obvious since Europe has always used the Phoenix as its insi gnia and they did not want the settlers to know that the British were silently orchestrating the development of the Americas. The Phoenix is also the hidden sign of the Phoenicians who designed much of our corrupted language; this is wher e we get the term Phonetics."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"105 | Page these Beings inside of the church I was able to at least come to the conclu sion that there was still something alive invisibly orchestrating itself in the church. It wasn’t a ll Catharsis as they would like to make you believe, Spirits actually made contact. So then I learned a valuable lesson which is what looks Good does not always come from Good. First off because the language is backwards when you say God you really say Dog, don’t laugh this is something very serious “Sir ius”. Many people have always been curious as to why God’s Name backwards spells dog. For a moment while carrying the Cross I tried to make sense of it so I leaned on the notion that the Dog was God’s opposite beca use Dogs were very bad. This made no sense whatsoever since many Dogs are ve ry kind and plus there are much more evil things than Dogs described in the Bible like Demons or the Devil which would be more like Gods opposite. I could only conclude for awhile that they all begin with D. Let us just think for a moment, if you where an all intelligent God and you intended for your Name to always mean good, you shou ld probably make it something like YAY, that way no matter if a person pronounced it backwards or forwards they would still get the same thing, right? Surely the Creator of multiple universes re-s plendid and furnished would know th is if his lowly creation could figure it out. Not to mention th e Creator of everything cannot be confined within Names, Numbers, Vibrations, emitted from the human mouth and if it did it would be much too powerful for us to assimilate and then reproduce. It would be worth it to conclude th at the Gods, who are separate from the Most High, know exactly what they ar e doing down to a quantum level. Reason 87: This is the Dog Star Sirius A, the star of Illumination for many Secret Societies including the Egyptians. They called it Sothis its symbol is the 5 po inted Star. There is also Sirius B called the pup or esoterically “Great Five” this is Anubis, 5 was the Sacred number of Atlantis."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106 | Page As I began to look at a lot of th e terminology being used in certai n places it seemed to take me closer to the truth as long as I wa s willing to take it literally. Our ability to discern what is happening is deteriorating because we think ev erything is just a coincidence even though there is no such thing. It is of value to make note of th e syncs or déjà vu’s of your life, also dreams. This is how the Unseen Ones communicate without swooping down on you in full flight scarring the crap out of you which would not accomplish the purpose intended. Many ask why the Most High does not just come down here and straighten things out? We say, “Shall the Creation ask the Creator why did you ma ke me this way”? Some even further claim that “He” did. I will venture out for a quick moment to imagine what the Mo st High is. This of course is very unwise since I’m now trying to comprehend such a storehouse of catamount vesants of condescend Aeonic beams, the Wise, with five puny senses and to add insult to injury I have to use English words, but here it goes. PURE UNRESTRI CTED ENERGY, thus if the Most High arrives anywhere near our Galaxy well welcome to the next life beca use nothing can withstand such force based on common sense, Phys ics, and Mathematics. Anything that has come saying it is the Most Hi gh is a Deceiver and the truth cannot be found with them and their works prove it along with their words. Notice that when people “Pray” as the word indicates they actually are saying they are be coming the victim and are being hunted, that is after all what pray is, so who is the predator, could it be a wolf? Were the Pastor st ands is called the Pulpit, but what is being pulled into the pi t? They call themselves Saints wh ich is an anagram for Satins? All books of power indicate the Most High is inside of you so why do so many people when they pray imagine that God lives outside of them, possibly in th e sky? This becomes one of many errors we make when we channel our energy to make contact. As it teaches in religions wher e chakra systems are at least discussed, focusing internally and concentrating on certain energy centers located in your body is one sure way to Enlightenment. On ce you have accomplished that you begin to manipulate the energy through your Chakras which are the organs of your soul. Full activati on of the Chakras will bring an individual to clear unadulterate d contact with the Most High. The real miracle is performed by the one who has trained their mind to bring about such phenomena without the assistance of an external Be ing of invisibility causing the phenomena to take place. This does take a certain leve l of dedication that many have tr ied to get around. The result of cutting spiritual corners has always been an even greater setback to on es growth. There is no easy way because it is not hard, it has just been made to seem like it is. Once finally emanci pated from being dependant upon the rules and false impedances of natural growth you will clearly see our purpose here is to become complete. Not fused and packed together with followers who posses nothing of their own creative thoughts and are just reciting like ro bots what they learned from those before them that where also incorrectly being lead about behaving like clones.

Our Planetary Ether is saturated with multip le Beings on various frequencies above what the untrained eye can see. The ear can detect some of the Beings which will sound like a ringing in the ear. These Beings have developed an outer Aura incasing their body that makes them invisible thus they ca n carry out their work on the mate rial realm without notice. Their voices are whispers that people imagine as their ow n thoughts unless they ar e Guided. The prayer of the individual which is often known before the re quest is even made is taken into account and a design begins, this is one of the powers of the All Seeing Eye. We have way too much evidence linking the Christian faith to Atlantian, Egyptian, and Sumerian Rites sometimes be ing directly plagiarized from the origin als. What I am saying in this case is if a person does their research , which can be done on the internet , and they still do not find the above statement to be true, they co uld be a victim of mind control which is okay we can work through that. Let us remember that the secr et to mind control is never letting the person realize they are under its influence.

Let us examine why it could be possible that th e term God is more of a hidden term which traces to the land of Canaan and many other trails . Throughout our recent hi story lots of attention has been put on the land of Canaan. This is th e so-called Promise Land of the Hebrews. Most literature on Canaan is very non-descriptive as to the people that originally lived there and this of course is done on purpose. There religious beliefs, artifacts along with its true name often remain hidden and obscure. After much Guidance pieces began to come together. Reason 88: Every part of the physical mind has been mapped, one will have to work with their spiritual mind to avoid delusions."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108 | Page According to the story when the cursed Cain slew his brother Able he wa s marked with a sign so that all who see Cain would know that he had been marked by God thus they could not destroy Cain. It should seem odd that althou gh Cain has killed his brother he is then given a symbol of great protection, just another one of those Bible concoctions where the true story is an esoteric mystery embedded with hidden symbolism thus taking it literally makes no sense. They do so much of this in the Bible it’s a wonder the book is legible at this point. Generally the member is trained heavily in blind faith to counteract the feelings which occu r when continuously uncovering inconstancies. Enoch son of Cain who wrote more literature relating to the “Fall” for a profound reason noted that this was the double cross. This cr oss was used in Gnosticism taught in Gnosis, Crete. What is also odd is according to the Bible at this point only 4 people have been created one of which is dead. So Adam and Eve and Cain are the only people spoke of. Here is the scripture: Genesis Chapter 4:16-17 And Jehovah set up a sign for Cain in order that an yone finding him would not strike him. With that Cain went away from the face of Jehovah and took up residence in No d the Land of fugitiveness to the East of Eden. Afterward Cain had intercourse with his wife and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Then he engaged in building a city and called the city’s name by the name of his son Enoch. Once Cain is evicted it says he left into the la nd of Nod, the land of fugitiveness, and he knew a wife. This mysterious land of Nod I have traced to the land of Canaan which became Palestine than Israel. In Palestine they have di scovered caves completely excavated by what appears to be a very advance race for the time that must have been of great stature according to how the caves were laid out. Our biblical story of Abraham also starts of f in Ur of Chaldea and Abraham when leaving Ur enters Canaan where he experiences his first encounte rs with the God of the Bible. This is also the reason the Children of Israel deemed Canaan the land that wa s promised to them through the covenants made with Abraham by Je hovah that had to be fulfilled. Beside the Bible’s report the record reflects th at after the destruction of Atlantis the few that survived set out on ships. It goes on to say many of them reached land in the area we now know as Canaan. They began rebuilding their Empire warring with the various people currently inhabiting the land. It goes on to report that many sailed furthe r into indigenous territori es inhabited by various Indian tribes. Many of these tribes recorded the a rrival of the Atlanteans and report that they taught them various sciences, ma thematics, and of course a new reli gion. Being more te chnologically and spiritually advanced the natives began to worship th em as Gods and knew them as Feathered Serpents because of the religion they taught and the appearance of their Deity.

Earth is also ou r current reference point, if it is removed it is possible our memories will be disposed of when we reincarnate again. This is of course if we continue to reincarnate after what happens in the future. The best most could hope for is another repeat of life with no memories in which I’m not rea lly up for. We must admit Earth life is dangerous after awhile in our current atmospher e of illusion. It is easy to bring about so many excesses we not only destroy things around us , but we also bring about the degradation and degeneration of our Souls. Experience is not the only thing the soul needs to grow; in fact experience is a relatively small portion when you consider the Soul can eat Elem ents, Essence, and Gaseous things found in the atmospheres. We must now build a superhighway down the Path of Truth. Why? During the invasion of the Anu known also as Ana, life forms from an other constellation called Nibiru came to Tiamat/Earth to subdue it. Tiam at known as the Dragon fought the Annunaki who fought back using highly advanced weapons that ultima tely split Tiamat. This is the story in the Bible of the Dragon fighting the Angels. Many of ou r religions are Annunaki propaganda. Their main interest was our natural elements especially the Spirit of man and woman termed, the Gold. Several situations ensued amongst these Beings even a mutiny amongst themselves. These Beings are responsible for the Nephalim stories of the Bible, they altered a race of what appeared to be then pure spiritual Beings of various types, into spirit forms incased in flesh in which they could slave and master over. There was said to be a few amongst them that did not like the way humans were being abused and thus they began to teach “their favorites” the ways of enhancing their bodies by linking them to their spirit to become as powerful as the Annunaki, if not even more powerful since we had the spirit element in us given by the Most High. These myster ies of enhancing the body later became known as “the Wisdom of the Serpent”. The correct term would be “the Wisdom of the Spirit” who many relate to the serpent because of its spiraling movement and fiery nature. As things began to intensify word got back to Anu the leader of the Annunaki about the humans and their new abilities. Anu sent Marduk in a ship which is Planet X to handle Tiamat called the Great Serpent and her offspring th e humans once and for all. This sh ip the size of a Planet similar"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110 | Page to George Lucas’s Death Star ente red orbit around our Sun as the 12 th Planet in the 10 th position from the Sun hence its name Planet X. This marked the last crossing of Nibiru. Marduk used a weapon known in the Tablets as a Net called also the Net of Indra. This is some ty pe of atmospheric net that keeps souls trapped on Earth/Tiamat not allowing th em to continue their e volution. Marduk who is Ra set up the Pyramid systems whic h I explained above as the first Ma trix. Ra then became ruler of the Underworld which is the place where souls go when they remain trapped in the net but have expired their current physical body t hus they are waiting on a new one, this is re-incarnation, a curse. You can clearly see the Egyptian God Anubis se rves Anu and is one of them. The Queen of England, who is the ruler of this world, has insti lled the worship of Ra, Anubis, and the rest of the Annunaki pantheism under various Sumerian, Egyptian, and Hebraic gu ises. This is why religion is now so limited except for the few wh o become high initiates. It is them their duty to continue to suppress us. They are doing this at the bidding of th eir God Anu who they say is returning with Planet X by 2012. There are many more in high places who also serve Ra such as the Arabs in Dubai. Reason 89: Parliaments are tools for the Annunaki , they run mystery sch ools, governments, and practically the entire globe. I have yet to fi nd anyone who opposes this force. They are supremacist such as the ideas the Talmud discusses about Gentiles thus if you are not in leagues with them, you are only a resource that can be abus ed. Christianity was hatc hed to seem as if it opposed all of this however it wa s just another plan to keep hu mans powerless thus continuing to stall anyone from activating by denying th em information of Chakras. We will face the Annunaki in what will appear to be the first extr aterrestrial contact on Ea rth, currently it seems Earth will face utter destruction and enslavement by them, however the Mo st High holds the key Element of setting such plans to ruin. You mu s t at least individually entreat the Most High."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"111 | Page The Annunaki themselves appear to be originally Reptilian, however, th ey have blended with various life essences and thus their appearances va ry. In addition the Annunaki themselves seldom interact with humans directly, they use their un derlings who are humans infused with Annunaki genes and in that state they are wholly indebted to the Annunaki and are co ntrolled by them through a mentally collective cellular connection. Other names of the Annunaki and their offspring are Anakim, this is wh y Anakin Skywalker is Dark Vader in the Star Wars Series. They are the Celtic Tuatha de Danaan Sons Dan or the Danu. They are offspring and servants of Sumarian E.A. (pronounced Aya) . This is why the new name for our planet is “Ea”rth, three wise men came from the “Ea”st, and th e major Christian celebration is called “Ea”ster. They are the Sumerian EL, Akkadi an ILU, Babylonian ELLU , and English ELF called by their worshippers the “Shining Ones” or is it Sinning Ones? They alte red man, a downgrade, calling them Lulu meaning “mixed one” and Ad apa, “model man” who the Hebrews call Adam. According to the Sumerian text Ti amat’s seas were full of souls that could be harvested. This is the hidden meaning behind the Fisher King and Jesu s being called “the Fisher of Men”. When Planet X divided Tiamat into two parts sh e released an ocean of souls or co smic essence into the cosmos. The Greek version of Tiamat was Demeter which is where we get the term Diameter, the cutting or dividing a circle in two, or spli t. This is how we beca me separated from our other half. The Egyptian termed these two parts th e Ka and the Ba. Ka’bah. Reason 90: Indara is se en in this rare Plate carrying the Double Cross/Net. Indara is Cain and plays the role of Ra/Marduk.

I was enlightened and made aware of what is transpiring and since my eyes have been open, I would rather die on my feet than live on my knees. The Annunaki see the Earth bound souls as slaves, criminals, deviates, prisoners of war, detested social and racial groups, non-conformist and undesirables. Hammur abi’s Code, which later became the Ten Commandments found also in the Eg yptian Book of the Dead became the guidelines issued to this race of souls to give them rules and conformity. Vari ous plans have existed to keep us from reaching our real potentia l through the Art of Conviction. Ninharsag the Sumerian Hathor or Isis was called the Great Cow. Legend says she is the true power behind E.A./Aya. She was ca lled the Carpenter, the Coppersmit h, and the Lady Potter. Later her name was changed to Gabriel fe minine such as Gabriella. Gabrie l appeared to the Virgin Mary alerting her of the birth of the Christ Child Je sus. In 600 A.D. she vi sited Muhammad dictating Koran to him. She is a Seraphim , meaning serpent of Raphim or Rephaim another Nephalim Hybrid connection. Gabriel used the caduceus rod to translate the soul of Chri st along with “the Holy Ghost” into the body of Mary. It helps to see this as advanced technology of Spirit insemination.

For some this may be true but let us not forget that Abraham had a father also and wh ile they where all in Ur of the Chaldeas you had Nubians populating Africa, Asians in the Orient, and various other races that had never heard of Abraham. The Bible speaks of in Genesis a Man and Wo man created on the 6 th day in the Image of God and another set created on the 8 th day from dust. The difference between these two creations was one had spirit/compassion, while the ot her was very base. This is the main drawback of the genetic manipulation. Many underlings are of the other race of Adams of whom care more for material prosperity and could care less about a dying world, helping ch ildren, etc. Still others are now mixed with both. There is obviously a silent wa r going on between at least 2 separate races. Looking deeper into the K-9 affiliations to clarify the Dog itself is a domesticated Wolf so what we are really dealing with here are Wolves which fits the term, Wolves in Sheep’s clothing. Sheep’s clothing is a metaphor for a huma n body. In Canaan which has its r oots in the words Cain, Canine, K- 9, and others relating to the Canine species there had obviously been some interaction with the Wolf later domesticated into the Dog. This interaction can be looked at no different then the Chinese and the Dragon in which they claim in there ancient tal es where their original descendants. To explain many things that have drawn a blank to most historians it may be ne cessary to look further into the true meaning of the Animist invo lvement in various Nations. Following the pagan tradition many would leav e their young in the w oods around packs of wolves to see if they would take the baby as their own. Of course this lead to hundreds of babies being torn apart by packs wolves. It is said some were tak en into the pacts of wolves and the she-wolf would care for them. It is said at times when seeing these youth full grown in the forest they had inherited all the traits of the wolf, just as the shaman follow ce rtain animals around to gain their traits.

In the old days they became revered, feared and worshipped. It can be proven that many of these Beings make up the tales of Ancient Mythology when Centaurs, Cyclops, Cthulhu, and various other part man/part God/part animal creatures were roaming about, this was known as the abomination . In addition it states in the ancient text that when these Creatures died they ha d Souls thus they did not perish but roamed upon the face of the Earth and man called them evil Spir its and they could be evok ed. This is the accounts that can be found in the books of Enoch the first man to write about the God of the Bible and what was taking place during those times. Interesting en ough his books did not make it into publication and remained in the esoteric circles for hundreds of years.

Real Zodiac does give a pretty accurate layout of yo ur character but we have the ability to change our ways permanently thus altering our DNA, this is the marvel of the Human race. Considering how long this charade of playing God has been going on, th is may be the first time at least in this segment that such knowledge of the inner workings of our society has been placed in our hands. Not to mention this is probably the first time a mass of people are at a com prehension level to at least grasp what is happening. In the history of man the ma sses have been powerle ss with little intellect. The Human mind which I mentioned before is mo re like a wheel turnin g. When we get set into habits it creates a groove in the brain. Deeper grooves are ha bits that have been practiced for longer periods. This is where terms like “stuck in a cycle” or “getting into the groove of things” come from since a cycle can also be looked at as a wheel. It has been also observed that it takes 22 days to make or break a habit, good or bad, which has the effe ct of allowing the grooves to flatten back out. So the Human mind becomes a record with grooves playing often times the same vibrational song everyday. The first thing you realize during astral travel is that you ar e not the body, you are more like the Alien on the movie Men In Black that is very sm all but powerful sitting in the operations seat of a giant body, something like an orga nic Montauk chair. The other thing you will notice when you look down upon your body is that obviously your memo ry and senses are not contained in your body because you are still using them. This is one secret of obtaining Higher Character, even if you have not astral traveled before, knowing that you are not the body re leases you from the many expectan cies of normal life and gives you another framework, the soul, to build upon. When you have dreams if you notice the shear detail that is involved in the environmen t you realize that we are a lot more than they are letting on about. We are capable of doing amazing things. There is even a part in our mouth that makes 3 different types of saliva for different situati ons. It becomes obvious that we are not in a Ford with the standard parts we have been fashio ned with bells and whistles that we ha ve not even explored. This knowledge of enhancing the body has been held selfishly by the Elite Alchemist but now we are hacking Morpheus/Orpheus and in a moment he will tell us everything. Most are completely unconscious of who they were in former lives. Sometimes we catch glimpses of it in dreams, often smells and soun ds remind us of something that we remember but cannot wholly identify. The Sacred Order of the Ma ry’s in fact had unlocke d the secret of certain essential oils that had the ability to regress anyone smelling them into memories of their past. The loss of collective life memory ha s everything to do with how strong your Spirit is when it departs from this world. We are living in a time where if you look deep enough you can find most of this information. This is all we need and possibly all we will get.

I will take this time to tell you that you should not become a warrior when you begin to discover what is going on and anger or vengeance mo ves you to combat it directly. You should always keep your weapons in your mind and not in your hand. Warrior also means a person who worries/worrier so much once they figure out how much strength and cunning the other side possesses that they actually send energy to the negative forces when they become overwhelmed and behave foolishly. Remember what we face as a society is somethin g that we all must confront at some point; one person can not fix this world on their own but each person can do thei r part in getting out information of the Truth. This way those who are st ill confused can make up their mind as to which side truly resonates with them so they can go about it fully an d not half heartedly. The whole construct of this Book is not to down any religion ra ce or belief syst em. It should be seen as a detailed observation and not a judgment. In the Book of Revel ations it says “how I wish you were hot or cold but you are lukewarm and I shall vomit you out of my mouth”. This means that individuals should not straddle the fence, whatever they are going to be they should get on with it.

In the unknown you can be found because you have not yet discovered your true self obviously because you are not even flying or at least floating yet. I give this pointer very sternly; fear is indeed the mind controller. You are stopped at times from learning anything more because of the internal feeling of death and the lies about what really happens after death. Many people hold on to their religious preferences because they feel it will save them in the end even though they break most of the rules of the religion. It would suffice to know that when you die you go to the place corresp onding to your mentalit y or frequency hence the term Judgment or a Judging of the Mental.

It is unclear what happens to your body he re, some say it continues as if it ’s you and behaves just like you through residual memories action and reacti on, people never know you are really gone. ☺ In Egypt where much of this is amplified we find the Cult of Isis. Many believe with the masculinity of the Pharaohs the women played only ro les as normal Queens call ed by them, Ferts. In all actuality the Egyptian Empire functioned as a Trinity and the fe male part of the Trinity became absorbed under Isis. To maintain it as a Trinity all the other Gods and Goddesses were summed up under the main ennead. Cleary Osir is-Horus-and Isis make up the Eg yptian Trinity. Sin, Shamash, and Ishtar make up the Babylonian. Isis represen ted Ninhursag, Nin-Ella, Inanna, Ishtar, Ma’at, Mare, Mary, Mut, Nephthys, Hathor, Nut, Diana, As teroth, Astarte, Aphrodit e, Athena, Tuart, Bast, Usertesen, Ida, Mylitta, Baalat h, Anahita, Ashur, Aasith, Kodesh , Sophia, Sothis, Sodet, Shekina, Magdelina, Europa, Ganeym ead and many others. This became possible because it was the so-called God “S” “female energy” that equated to the enlightened portion of Spiritual training so when an Initiate came in contact wi th the actual Spirit of the religion it often personified itself in one of these Goddesses who all remained under the same umbrella. This is why even to this day Isis unde r many forms is worshipped heavily. Our statue of liberty is a rendition of Isis. Her main sign is ($) which is the word ISIS compressed into one symbol. Some of the countries of their origin are Assyrian Ishtar, Phoenician Ashtoreth (Astarte), Syrian Atargatis (Derketo), Babylonian Belit (Mylitta) Arabia n Ilat (Al-Ilat). Again their home is the Asteroid Venus, Sirius, and the Pleiades. Their species seems to be comple tely foreign hiding under the guise of Illuminating Warrior Goddesses. In the ancient text it sa ys a fragment landed in the rive r Euphrates shaped like an egg. Somehow those who interacted with this egg became infu sed and infected with its essence. Those infected became the firs t communicators of the knowledge an d message these Beings brought to Earth. These are also the Beings movies like “the V” and “the Knowing” are describing. They have an agenda to take over the world comp letely and they have major assistance from just about every main religious and social group. This is due in part to the powerful role th ey play in religion. The natural instinct for man to gravitate towa rd a “Mother Goddess” figure comes from the separation of our other half. The wa nt to interact with this magical feminine Being is played on and exploited by these imposters, some of whom are respon sible for the initial split or Maya as it is more properly called. In addition for the woman, since th e God “S” is androgynous, he gives her the Son of the Sun. She begins to see this as her husband, protector, and father figure. Most women are deprived of one or the other if not both in today’s common society. There is obviously not just one faction doing all this.

Immaculate Conception is really the Deity having some ty pe of intercourse with the woman producing an offspring. This offspring then attempts to become ruler of the world in his father, “the King’s”, steed. Many of the hyperdimensional Beings want the title “Lord of the Earth”, so they never cease these “divine conception stories”. This ha ppens now through the royal families such as Prince William becoming the ne xt King. Their family history however is riddled with the involvement of various Forces.

She of course was in no position to do such a thing being fully initiated herself and remember their oath is to keep silent. Howe ver, they are allowed to push propaganda and disinformation. Once again the Goddess as we know it was a play on words. There is actually a symbolic story being told about Adam and Eve in the garden with the Serpent. It is known that this story should not be taken literally but has a much deeper me aning. It started with this uneasy feeling that there was something that wa s a big secret about the word women. You find Omen in the remaining part of the name meanin g a deep hidden meaning. Eve is the root to the word evening. The Hebrew version is even weirder since the name used for Eve in Hebrew, Haveh, actually means serpent. According to the original Zohar, a major root of the creation story, it makes it clear that the Serpent in the Garden was a female serpent not a ma le like it is commonly be lieved. Pre-Adamites or “before Adam” were Masculine Spirit Beings calle d Sons of the Sun who took physical form and mated with these women. These female Serpents kn own as the race of Namaah and Lilith, caused Chief Angels like Aza and Azrael to fa ll from their post and mix with them. The Zohar continues to blame AMALEC as th e wicked Seraphim whil e Metatron is called literally “The Good Serpent ”. This is incredible, it admits Metat ron is actually a serpent and goes on to admit that Enoch became Metatr on once he was translated to heaven thus Enoch was also a Serpent. Several times the tribe of Shem makes it clear to indicate th ey are inbred with serpents. This makes it concrete that the Enochians are linked to th e Serpents. It says “the Priest came forth from the dead Sophanim who died in labor. The baby was born with the sign of th e Priesthood which was a lustrous (scaly) hide. The baby ha d just been brought forth but sa t upright immediately and showed the sign of the Priesthood and they where struck with terror.” In the many Hebrew texts where it says"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"122 | Page “He created Man”.

In legend Isis is always with Anubis a dog-fa ced God sent to be her protector. Nepthys Isis’s sister is said to be a female dog also. What is also interesting about this tail were their strange relations with one another. It is said that Osiris mated with Nepthys by acci dent birthing Anubis. Nepthys was Isis’s sister thus connecting Isis to also being part dog part serpent. The child between Osiris and Isis became Horus/Horse/Mane/, Isis did not suckle the ch ild but instead allowed th e child to suckle from Anubis the Dog. Isis relocated to Byblos and wept th at she could not bring Osiris back to life after he was cut into 14 pieces by his brot her Set, until a certain time sinc e the 14 pieces signified the 14 phases of strength of the Moon.

On the Masonic tracing board at the top of the middle pillar sits a seven pointed star known as the Star of the Pleiades also called the Seven Sisters or Seven Hathors. It becomes evident that there is actually a group of female spirits, who are immortal, that are enlisted by the God “S” who have been attemptin g to steer the destiny of the Human race, these women are better known as the Fates. These Fates are the key women who mated with the Nephalim and produced the offspring of heroes and villains with various fo rms and powers.

In Hindu teachings one is taught to work from the root Chakra up, thus much of their teachings are based on Tantrics and the manipulati on of sexual energy. Many are now saying the proper ancient teaching was from the crown Chakra down thus the person escapes the traps of getting stuck in an animalistic carnal phases wh ich often happen when lower chakras are turned on before the higher ones.

There has been a large amount of research on the Reptilian portion of the brain. It makes us only think of survival, food, clothes, shelter and basic instinct. It begins to deactivate the much more creative Human portion of the brain that conceives beyond daily life into Art, Feeling, Creativity, and Expression. When you can operate in both worlds you can m ove things around because time does not exist in the other world like it does here. When you come back into this world th ings manifest immediately which is called keeping a foot in both worlds and was shown being done in Eg yptian art. This world could be naturally reached through the dream state if there weren’t so many nets and webs that ones astral body gets entangled in when they go to sleep thus keeping them from traveling beyond the immediate globe of influence. This is why the Maya depicted 2012 as being the end of the Illusion because all this would be found out. The gig is up. Reason 113: The Maya, more corre ctly known as Maia which is one of the seven stars in the Pleiades did much of the Leyline work for the Se rpents. Other tribes like the Aztecs, Yucatán, Toltec, Incas, Tezcaucans, Peruvians and Araucannia ns all built Pyramids or other structures on the Leylines and began human an d child sacrifice by instructio n of their perceived Masters."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"150 | Page People tend to forget that th e Maya also predicted their own destruction 500 ye ars before it happened, this occurred because they where taught to believe in destiny so much they could not avoid it. The shear fact that Destiny has Ti ny at the end of it turns me off; this word is too small for me to dissect. Our future should never be associated as such, it’s despicable this kind of degrading. Their extensive knowledge of time was given to them by the Serpent. This is mainly evident because it wasn’t even a time chart for Earth’s processions but Sirius. They are often seen in sculptures and pictures bowing down to these Serpents who gave them this fa ulty system of time. Let us think clearly, the one who gave us time was the culprit known as the Watc her or “Watch” just like a time piece this is another name for the Nephal im. We find lots of hope also in the indigenous tribes many of whom had unlocked the ability to disappear totally from a reality in a blink of an eye which can be done when groups of people get together and pull all of their energy in collectively, thus creating a Gate to other worlds formed within the collective mind of the group. I will take this moment to elaborate on the damage of the split mind. First with the mind split there will always be some type of internal duality within the indi vidual, a constant pulling from one side to the other depending upon what time of the season it is. This Duality was remarked by the ancients as the two Horses pulling your chariot as can be seen on the #7 Ta rot card. Unless you could get them to run together, they will go in separate directions eventually rippin g you in two. This other side has a lot to do with being complete in our th inking; it is given the te rm masculine or feminine depending on you sex. There is no space in this book to elaborate on what is masculine and what is Reason 114: The Maia long coun t calendar functioned as a clock of the Universal time of Earth’s evolutionary development based on the energies of Sirius/Sothis. As you can see on the right this watch maker obviously is in the know."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"151 | Page feminine because of the complexity of the individu al Creation, but there are a couple things that can be of value to consider. Feminine energy is intuitive whil e masculine energy is analytical power of reason and strength. Women say men need to be more se nsitive to their surroundings in order to get in tune, which is true. There is seldom any response by men on what wo man get to do. This is what I’ve learned, if we “sense” all the time without “analyzing” we will just go with the flow of life. That current flow of life in our present world condition is actually going in the opposite direction of progress, it is headed towards decay as anything material will, it just is, and this is something that has happened before. It is also true when we become too analytical all we ha ve is mountains of data that are not attached to feeling thus higher senses cannot be activated so there can be no power to do anything about your findings. Especially when it comes to divining th e “real truth” or the “root ” of what is going on in your individual life so it can be adjusted properly so you can have a stable foundation. For males it is of value to know that females make at least 50% more paranormal contact than males. One main reason these Beings can communic ate with woman better th an men is because they possess a womb, this is known as a “Soul Matrix”. The fluid is highly magnetic and as any Yogi can tell you there is actually brain tissue around the stomach region, in short the stomach area is the keeper of Chi/Force/Power this is where it is harnessed and st ored. Women have a high ge nerative cycle of this magnetic fluid in their Menstrual Blood or Plasma which is also a high energy substance. This was known by the Knights Templar as Sangrail which they would drink in their rituals of the Holy Blood the Holy Grail/”Mag”delena. Unfortunately this also results in more women be ing used to harness the Reason 115: The Chariot is the body comprising two different sides that are the energy +/- just like a battery. When the sides are balanced progress is made, when one side is unbalance there will be no movement as one side will always pull or drain the other.

As the “New Age” woman develops more analysis she will ag ain deal a heavy blow to the Wicked One who is no match for the Fury of Woman but is ever seeking to use her prowess. Men are no better, without the feminine side they personally need to see the physical result of their Spiritual practice, if it be an y, in order to believe. Due to many practicing for personal gain they only engage in the arts that produce fast and vivid results. This form of magic is the most dangerous as it is not a graceful energy but a magic based on re ceiving not giving thus various pacts are formed by men with lesser Spirits whose prese nce can be felt easier because they are dense slow moving vibrations, Chaos Magic. This is called the Gambling of the soul which is wh y gambling is forbidden by wise men. Even the numbers on the Rolette tabl e added up equal 666. What gambling does is it allows the person to jump to a higher phase in th is material world without proper preparation. If a person has many bad habits and they happen to “strike it rich” the latter condition is far worst than the former, they now have money to feed their every corrupt desire. Reason 116: This type of propaganda is being directed at the young women so they can imagine Witchcraft is a coven of woman sticking together. In all actuality it is to place one under the service and spells of the Horney Gods, this reflects in how women’s bodies are desecrated and disrespected by these cults. These are also called Corn Gods which is a term coined in Egypt were there entire economy depended on Corn at times. As you watch the “Orn” continue it is obviously wicked like we talked about with the “Or” you have words like Torn, Porn, Morn, Worn, etc. all implicating the culprit once more."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"153 | Page The balance comes in play when you are open to the emotional, sensual side of the world thus giving you extra perception, while your analytical mind is able to plac e it in its proper category due to previous experience and research. Th ese two become the perfect self sustained match being capable of handling energies the proper way, ex pelling darkness and elaborating on the true light. It is also of value to realize that to become a te acher you will need both of these in order to deal with the “two states of mind” if you expect to mend them. I will also rema rk that masculine and feminine Reason 117: This is Baphomet the Horned God of Mendes. When inverting the Pentagram this Being and Legions of others are evoked. As yo u see with the propaganda above Witches and Warlocks use both sides of the Pentagram and bo th sides bring about va rious energies we will call Negative Feminine and Negative Masculine. These are extremely unbalanced distorted energies.

You will find many individuals with a mix and match of these traits and it will be your task, if you ch oose it, to replace what is missing like a Surgeon. With that being said do make a mental note that SIR wh ich is a title given to a member of the high court and SUR normally used as the root of words like Surgeon along with SER as in Serpent, SAR as in Sargon, and SOR as in Sorcerer all are head serpent terms meaning that this is the common acronym they refer to themselves by on this dimens ion. Also keep in mind most Surgeons have no idea of the root of the word, nor do they care. The Ca duceus is the only hint at times they get that the whole medical institution is none other than a Lab belonging to the Hybrid Serpents set up for the various manipulations of the huma n body such as vaccines. This also gives us a better resolve about choo sing the proper companion. There is seldom a bigger hindrance when you are on the first levels of the Path than the “un-si gnificant” other. Many times two people have paired up for a prolonged period and are now only together because of the amount of time they have been wi th each other. I overheard a person once say, “We ll we have been together for 6 years and I owe it to try and make it work”. When leaving this Earth there will be just you, unless your mate is on the same frequency. Of course in this li fe we desire to find compatible partners, however if we are persona lly just beginning to learn the tr uth of things, how can we expect our “old selves” to had chose anything good and balanced for us? I was able to sum the whole relationship paradigm with this mode of thought. If he or she is concerned about their soul and its growth then there is a chance the relationship will work. If they are not concerned then the other conscious party will most assuredly be dragged down. This will come about often times not in the intent of the idle indi vidual, but rather the thin gs they engage in. For example, if you are cleansing your mind and body seeking more clarity and a mate comes home after being in a bar for hours they are actually carrying a great deal of negative energy. When you share a bed with them you are even more vu lnerable than they are since they as a vessel no longer matter to the Spirits, it is your fresh energy the Spirits want, they already have the other individual. Even deeper than this, as long as you are “yoked” to them you are not only carrying them, but also the load that each of you acquire through life along with yourself. So in short if a person does not care about their soul, which is of the highest value, how can they care about you? Although there may appear to be something there, it is not complete thus it will falter at a certain point, most assured when you need it mo st. The weak link on a chain only breaks when extreme pressure is applied. This is the danger of the Illusion, many people are pretending, and this makes them very unstable in certain key areas. One of the main tactics of th e Deceiver is to match you, the Seeker, with an unbalanced mate that may only have an exte rior show of compatibility. This is why lustful pictures, flirtatious men and women, risqué scenes, and various types of propaganda all are put in place to distract the Seeker and convince them to first try to find eternal happiness outside of themselves which is not possible.

In writing I can leave no moments to think but that is pretty profound.

Especially since it is not condoned but promoted by the only person the child may know as its guide at such a young age. I’m not saying this needs to change, I believe its to late for that, most children now run their parents, what I am bringing light to is the resu lts of such things.

Of course being that it would be the last place that you would ever look. As you see the Great Pyramids are four sided pyramids not three. If you notice everything around you such as doors, windows, rooms and even work cubicles have all adapted the 4 sided 2D or 8 sided 3D cuboid shape or box. There are certain words I call “power words” li ke instead of going ba ckwards we should be going forwards but what are the “Four Words”. Ar e there Four Words that give us foreknowledge “Four Knowledge”? We are even told that our ancest ors or forefathers “Four Fathers” made history. The Tetragrammaton (YHVH), which is the Hebrew world that remains as the root to many esoteric Names such as JeHoVaH and YaHWeH, consists also of only Four Words. As we continue to see there is something diabolical going on here with the 4 wh ich in sacred geometry is a 2 Dimensional square, 4 dimensional cube, and 8 dimensional Octagon this is how worlds connect. All words like Dionysus, Dios, Diana, Diamond, Die, Divide, Diabolical, an d Diablo, are all intertwined and related with a story in antiquity. The “D” itself in the English language is the symb ol of a circle divided in two. If you open you breaker box right now and look at the manufacturer of the breaker you will see the company Square D, the logo is a D inside a square . They control everything related to power, as will be shown. The esoteric Masonic studies were focu sed on what they called squaring the circle. Since all organic life contains no straight edges and is always curved and circular this was the art of trapping organic life and holding them in various forms of stasis. Tra pping natural organic matter like me and you in Inorganic Cubes like the cubi cles we are sent to work in everyday and the houses we are given to live in or sometimes foolishly build ourselves in the wrong designs. Putting ou rselves into cubes and calling them home, this is another fine example of subtle programming.

Not to mention many of the Pyramids where completely coated wi th a substance that was washed away during the last flood , this substance allowed these gre at structures to reflect the Sun’s energy giving them the ability to become like larg e solar panels generating various energies depending upon the tuning. In deeper writings it states that the Gods would land their ships on the top of these structures and they would serve as charging station s. Those traveling the desert could navigate their way by the shining light of the Great Pyramid which could be seen for thousands of miles. The much older Hindu Paranas and Vedras describe detailed accounts of ships used by hyperdimensional Beings. When the Gods visited Eart h they would arrive in large ships which were in other written accounts as large flying beasts beca use they made such monstr ous noises, obviously the sound from the engines. Then they would set themselves up in th e temples man had built for them, lounge, and get served.

Right at the time were people think there isn’t even a Most High. Right at the time Deities, People , Beings and every created thing is in motion, a click happens that expands or contracts the experience, it is up to you to choose. The Egyptians actually admitted that there was a Most High Being greate r than the Gods but because they had not made contact with it, probably because of there dominant attitudes, they choose to obey the Entities that they were already familiar with. They are called “Familiar Spirits”. It becomes clear with the sign of Aquarius that the water bearer is dumping out a bucket of water upon the earth thus cleansing the earth fr om its current pesky inha bitants and getting it prepared for the next edition. The Gr eat Pyramid itself in Egypt is sa id to have had 18 inches of special coating washed away from its surface. Many peop le look at the Pharaohs of Egypt and try to grasp how such an ancient empire was so far advanced. You will also see how the Feline which is the Sphinx plays an important role. The sign of the Lion ess is used in modern symbolism relating to the ruling Monarch. Female, Fertility, Feline, and Feminine all begin wi th “Fe” for a reason. As you see on the crest of England the ruling power personifies itself as a Lion which can also be mapped in the cosmos by the constellation Leo. The females were hidden by di rect order and the female role remained hidden and protected or simply put, veiled. As can be seen in Egyptology the Egyptian Female Goddess Ma’at was the third eye of all Egyptian Gods also known as Wadj et. This means that the eye on top of the pyramid is actually the eye of Ma’at. They keep the Female Sphinx in fr ont of all their main lodg es for protection against various Spiritual forces the Elite are at war with. Egyp tians kept large amounts of cats in their temples. Cats carry lots of Prana and are very sensitive to ot her life forms. They are known to contain an Astral Spirit that can be trained. As you will be delighted to find out, since it gives you power and strength to know, this is none other than one of “Ma’s Tricks” or simply the Matrix that we are caught up in now. The Egyptian worshipped Matter as the primal cause. Our word for matter comes from the word Ma’at. The Atlantians perfected the ability to take matter, which is fl esh formed and fashioned into a human body, and then take a soul and anim ate the body with the soul. The matter was their creation and the soul was of course the creation of the Most High. To do this they would have to pull souls from lower dimensions, other worlds, or wherev er they could get souls. Finding souls was like mining for Gold.

You can trace the most recent use of this soul tampering to the Sumerian Annunaki who are now professing they are the Creators of man and woma n and created them to be slaves. The true story is the Danu also known as Tuatha de Dannan, the Tribe of Dan, the Danites who where known to be giants did discover the secret to DNA/DAN. The old Celtic doctrines speak of the Danu and some of their origin in which they are clearly part of the Atlantean Club which explains how they also had the knowledge of how to alter humans. They are also known as simp ly AN. The “A” in the English language is the symbol of Atlantis omitting the crossing of the A. The crossing makes it a pyramid with a capstone. It was normally written to look li ke an upside down V whic h still meant 5. Mary’s mother was named Ann, she was carrying the lineag e of the bloodline so they could erect a world savior that all would eventually bow to no matter ho w many they needed to cr eate, this has been going on at least since Mithras. How the Elite work is they expand their rule like a pyramid and elect many consorts in a system of hierarchy. Then they co nsolidate all of the power that they pull from the people back into the main Deity and close the top th rough the Hierophant, seldom distri buting anything of true value. When Beings come to a new Planet they first set up a Gate. When gates are destroyed, which has been happening, a Being can no longer come into this dimension, trapping those who originally came through the Gate on the Planet until they are able to reconstruct the gate on the proper Leyline and Reason 124: The Egyptians symbolized the spirit as a snake. In this glyph they have already trapped the spirit inside of these holding tu bes, they are now placing the spirits in the clones/matter/golem so they may be endowed with the intelligence and reason of the soul thus they make better servan ts rather than organic machines which need to take orders before they will engage."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"165 | Page make the “jump” back to their original Planet.

The Great Pyramids wormhole/zero point co nfiguration is probably how continuous reincarnation or should I say “soul snatching” is happening on Earth. Necr omancy obviously became primitive when new ways to harvest departed souls wa s discovered. There are sm aller cult groups still practicing Goetia the old way. Due to the inform ation already known abou t the Pyramids, if you happened to come out of your body while in the vicinity of the Pyramid, it would eventually suck you in like going down a sink; this is called a vorte x/wormhole/black hole. When that happens you would come out somewhere and as I mentioned briefly it seems the Pyramid could be tuned to determine were those entering its Vortex woul d come out. Those with strong spirits have the “thrust” to trust they can jettison away from the whirlpool.

When you begin to look into these matters you find an inner network of people from various nationalities and backgrounds all “in the know”, which allows them to be more mentally, financially, and physically superior than the average person. When the Twin Towers collapsed, which wa s the Tower Card #16, the consciousness of the Planet shifted starting in OZ/NY. The Twin Towers themselves were giant tuning forks with the base of th e structure infused into the chambers that kept the Gold Reserve.

For those families that lost a loved one they are torn between this conspiracy and that co nspiracy.

Thousands of lives are lost everyday due to plans that we could interpret , interrupt, and prevent if we would wake up and learn how the spiritual world functions, along with its signs and symbols.

In Dubai it is clear by the architecture they are expecting the arrival of a Being. Since the Annu naki bloodlines trace mainly through the regions of what is now the Arab world it is almost guaranteed they are expect ing the return of Marduk and have gathered the Gold as instructed. These Beings are at the root of the mental and physical enslavement that has faced man and woman, it is also their bloodlines the Elite are attempting to keep preserved. It is also clear the Annunaki are masters at keeping their identity unknown. Although the Sumerian tablets are some of the oldest writings discovered, stories of the Annunaki which ar e contained on Cuneiform Tablets did not start to really leak until after 9/11. Zachar ia Sitchen wrote extensive books on their workings, these books did not get much attention from thos e who did not already kn ow about the Sumerians and the Annunaki until recently.

Its apparent that the inte raction with the Annunaki males and the Earth females seems to parallel Genesis, especially since all these storie s are Sumerian and of course the Sumerians had the Fallen Angel story first. These Angels were actually advanced winged Reptilians. There is definitely a link here. Furthermore these bloodlines have now cl aimed to be the Blue Blood Elite that have been ruling like tyrants, Blue is th e color of the Serpents blood. Magdalena was said to be the twin sister of Jesus who was carrying the bloodline. She was married into the House of Windsor/Hanover/Mero/Got h/Viso etc. these are all Blue Bloods. Finally the Grail became Princess Diana and as planned she bought forth Prince William of whom many are implicating as the Anti-Christ.

When Princess Diana began to date Doti Fayed it seemed the Royal House was very sore about this, or was all this part of the plan to mix th e Reptilian Bloodlines with Annunaki? Another name for the Annunaki is Annu”doti”. When Diana’s auto psy came forward it stated she was pregnant with twins before her death.

The Sume rian Tablets that proceeds the one in common publication states that Allalu made the journey from the home Planet of the Annunaki first in order to find a Planet that contained the resources to sa ve their World.

After lengthy travel thro ugh the solar system Tiamat was discovered and Allalu set a course to enter the atmosphere in which ended in a crash landing into the ocean. With atmosphere suits he came upon land not knowing if the air was yet breathable. Once Gold was found Allalu send communication back to the home Planet of his find. When I think of all this the movie Predator come s to mind again. Apparently the second to arrive was Anu, Allalu’s brother who challenges him for the new foun d territory by a wrestling match. It says Allalu lost this match and was exiled along with his trusty co mpanion. Later it says that Allalu challenged Anu again and lost a second time.

All main religions use these Beings as their backbone and seldom teach self empowerment through the manipulation of body energy. They say “true you can reach higher st ates, but not without the aid of so-and-so”. There are two separate doctrines, one for you and one fo r them. Generally if the Spirit is alive it will manifest that is the doctrine of th e Elite. The people are taught to re main in blind faith never seeing the God and only maintaining a one sided dialog with a crucified Lord. All real Prophets, Yogis, and Brahmas maintained vivid contact with the Spiritua l realm. The doctrine of the Elite gives them power which is instilled by communing with these Beings. The belief system for the commoner leaves them powerless. As they say th e more prayers go up the more blessings come down. “Be Lessed”? These are the words that have to be analyzed by the individual believer if they expect to discover why they are still waiting on something that should have already come. So the truth behind Israel is they are evoking the assistance of Entiti es they discovered while playing with written Kabbalah alon g with some creepy residue from Ancient Egypt all the way back to the Groves of Ur. Although thousands of people from different countries are protesting the Gaza situation they find their governments doing nothing because in secrecy they are all working on a plan that has NOW the name of the NWO or simply OW N a.k.a ZIONISM. “Own” is actually the correct pronunciation of the word we know as “ON”. “ON” was Oanes the main Deity worshipped in Babylon and Heliopolis. The “ON” ha s embedded itself so deep into our words we find when we need a light we must turn it “ON” thus a false light is created. All units of energy contain the word “ON” in it because “ON” is a type of power for the Elit e for example Neutron, Proton, Electron, Tachyon, and Orgone, to name only a few. The real mind control is people are not dealing with their Spiritual condition they are holding on to Spiritual beliefs that they in fact live contrary to everyday. Many Spiritual beliefs contradict each other all in the same book and since the sub-consciou s mind has picked this up by more of intuition, it is generally not dedicated to religion, while th e conscious mind which beco mes diseased by the ego, is.

When one takes a look at the Bible in the Old Testament you are immediately confronted with a God who demands large sacrifices of animals. Still many fail to make the connection that animal sacrifice is Black Magic. Those closely involved in the inner order tend to have dark characteristics because they must participate in these senseless sacrif ices of cruelty. I noticed even in the Islamic faith an animal must be sacrificed during weddings, ho lidays, and various occasion s. Why do we continue such practices? The ancient law even says if it can run from you don’t eat it, look upon it, can it feel pain, now see yourself taste death. The Creator ma de many things for man and woman to marvel and cherish so their character may be plea sing and entertaining to you.

That becomes as easy as looking at the name Solomon to see how all this connects. When the works of Solomon were introduced it involved the e voking of demons. The more popular book is the Keys to Solomon removed from hi s sepulcher. Solomon himself proc laims in the Bible that he built the Temple with the assistance of demons in which he had subdued and put unde r control with a ring that was given to him by the God of the Bible. “Sol” is Latin for the Sun, “Om” is Sanskrit for the alternate Sun, and “On” is Sumerian/Babylonian fo r Oanes. Many adepts learn that the name is a sign of collaboration between three different Br otherhoods that decided to combine forces and knowledge to achieve complete dominance over the world. Solomon brought it all together. Solomon not only wandered after Ashtoreth he also sacrificed once a year to Bel. Jewish works further claim that Solomon was rebuked for doing these things but was absolved nonetheless. While Solomon was ruler Kings an d Wise Men came from all over just to hear his words and see his accomplishments thus many were induced into a deeper ve rsion of mysticism that involved commanding the lower Genii. When one thinks the Solar Deities are the Evil ones and the Moon Deities are the nice ones they still haven’t gotten the picture. All of these Energies seek to master what will serve them often times by foolin g the worshipper into actually beli eving they are in control. As I was told by someone very wise Demons are strong en ough to hurl men far lengths, they are not your companions and you cannot trust them. They are je alous and seek respite un til the Day if you but knew Iblis (Satan) said he was made of Smokeless Fire, stronger than flesh, thus he would not be a friend to man. Failing to realize we are created in the Image of the Most High showed he lacked reason and was deluded by pri de so We stripped him of his Jewels and his Beauty and placed him in the darkness. Indeed we where made aware that when trying to du plicate the power of our Most High Majesty ” the imposter Nakash”, pointed all th e people who found themselves no t sure of their origin, to the direction of a dying Sun who is Shamash called also Samael. Yes it was that dismal light which proclaims itself as sustainer of this Earth and rise s every morning in full 90 degrees. This faint hue the “uncounted” perceived as the Sple ndid One incessantly wanting to make their God visible and not seeking sensibility and reason. Even great Egypt was caught worshiping only what they perceived in clear view impatient they where and they failed utte rly, trapped in the world of no return thus they beckon others to join them in mi sery. They are still known by the wise and chaste to be misguided death dealers residing even now by ritual and pact in the lowest places. Their abode is nothingness they are leechers of life and feast on those wh o are misled into the want s of material matter. Just as always the female role is kept secret. It was actually Saba/Sheba who is Balkis who taught Solomon the Wisdom of the Stars. Sa ba actually means Star or Seven thus the Seven Stars or Pleiades. The Koran tells of a people called the Sabians who would make good converts. I found that Saba was more of a energy like Sothis, and not an actual wo man. Sheba was a temple in Ethiopia not a physical Queen.

Several mind control “Triggers” were used when the Elite made th e moves to make Barack Obama President. In several movies that made it to the box office before Barack came into the spotlight they showed the President of the United States as an African American.

Wi th these instructions what is now modern Christianity was given more form . The Ethiopic books of the Bible predated all other works.

Some of the Secret organizati ons were known to possess the secr et of bringing one back in contact with their double.

This would solve one of the biggest issues we face with deciphering who is on what si de because this shows that although both of these Sects appeared to worship the Sun, Planets, and Serpents it is in al l actuality some worship Serpents, and others Amphibians. Still others worship the Horned Gods like the Ra m, Ramses, Ra, Mendes, Tet, etc. The Bible says that the dragon had seve ral heads and they began to devour one another until two remained. Of course we find th e tales of Solomon in much of th e Hebraic lore and in the Masonic Rites in which they confess that So lomon was the first Master Mason. The Temple itself was known as the “Double Square”. When locating the ancient depictions of the re al Solomon, which are very hard to locate, I came across two, one by the Russians, and the other by the Rastafarians. Solomo n is depicted in both the motif and the bask relief as half man half reptilian or amphibian. Religions like Islam, Catholicism, Christianity, and Juda ism all support and defend Solomon as the wisest King, so it is better to throw them all in th e bag together. When reading work s like the Testament of Solomon which details his dealings with ne farious demons who are ma de to confess their crimes and then put in service of building the temple, it becomes obvi ous all who studied the Gnostic doctrines of these groups became Magicians, Wiza rds, called then Wizar and vari ous other types of Mystics.

Either the same Spirit has possessed the same individuals that look similar to each other, as strong Spirits are known to change the facial appearance and sometimes bodily features of the Host.

It becomes obvious that the God of the Bible promotes the Israelites to kill in order to obtain what clearly belonged to someone else before they invaded. This becomes no different then what the so- called founding father of the Americas did to the in digenous that were there first. Even the Hebrew Book of Light states that the Children of Israel who wandered around the wilderness and never made it to the Promise Land were those who found favor with the true God thus th ey gained an attachment to the wilderness and nature verses a city flowing with Milk and Honey. Milk and Honey were just symbolism for the Cow and the Bee th e two animals sacred to the Egyptians. We now see returning to the Promise Land was more like becoming the Egyptians for the Hebrews based upon the way they are ruling now. There is absolutely no excuse for such barbaric behavior unless of course you are serving a blood thirsty Deity which brings up the point again about sacrifice. How can it escape a person’s judg ment that if something is asking you to slaughter thousands of cattle and various other animals into a huge furn ace of fire it could possibly not be something negative? Putting yourself in the moment is key. Throwing a living cow in a furnace 10 times heated would sound horrible. Just think of thousands of them back to back mooing to the Moon like crazy. This would not smell like the drive through at Burg er King since the fur was not removed. Some will say “Well Jesus did away with animal sacrifice” and I will say so we moved on to child sacrifice? This God now tells his so-called only son to sacrifice himself? No parent in their right mind would participate in such demonic activity , thus many in history not in thei r “right” mind did, this is the drawback of only using your “left” mind. This does not come up only once but at least twice in the modern Bible where Abraham is also told to sacrific e Isaac paying no mind to the strict rules against child sacrifice in the Bible. For the God to even use this as some test seems unethical and hypocritical. The behavior of an individual will ultimately determine what they are about, so through treachery and subterfuge the world has been set in array. Once the prophecy is fulfilled of Greater Israel it indicates it will be time for their next move which is to rebuild the third temple of Solomon in Jerusalem using the demons again of course. The New Jerusalem is spoken of in Revelations coming down from the sky and that cannot be fulfilled un til the third Temple is complete. What remains of the last Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem is only th e Wailing Wall which is why the Zionist are so fond of it. Obama was even instructed to pay a trip to it yamiluke and all. The proposed location of the new temple is where the Dome of the Rock, a sacred Islamic Mosque, sits now.

On the flip side unless the Dome of the Rock is removed and the Temple of Solomon rebuilt, New Je rusalem cannot descen d from the Mount. This of course the Zionist will not stand for and neither will the Muslims. So this equals a no win situation for these two brothers who have been fighting forever and the clock is ticking down for them both. They have also dragge d everyone else into their battle through religion although they refuse to give the masses the full details of what took place on Tiam at the enemy of Ma rduk.

They now use “El”evators so if the Guided do not rally behind the one with the Idea which comes before the Name then they will not see “ABAD” eternity, without end and may find their Companions in the Fire which is Purification.

Brahman and his wife Saraswati can also be found in the Hindu Paranas which is mu ch older than the Bible an d of course the Koran. The Brahman’s were a group of Bein gs that leaned more toward the masculine side and may be some of the first Sun worshippers th emselves being Sons of the Son which meant endowed with “discovered” immortality.

Beings that are aware of this are far more advanced th an those who cannot rememb er past lives. Imagine what another 100 years of memory would do for your perspective of things. The Bible’s composition itself is a hodgepodge of several ancient books and powerful works accomplished by various individual s, especially of Sumerian origin , all combined in one final novel next to the Koran. Both of thes e books say pretty much the same thing. The Koran is a book of repetition, repeating the same poet ic words over and over in various ways about the penalties for not serving Allah. It pretty much boils down to being completely oblitera ted by fire and demons that ripe the flesh apart, then brought back to life, and obliterated again for the sake of the pain. This is to take place for an eternity; talking about scare tactics. Other penalties for si ns are described in such ghastly detail the Believer is generally in fear of Allah. Both religions maintain they have delivered the final book and all other books that do not bear witness should not be entertaine d by the Believer. The Koran bears witness to the Old Testament and what it calls the Injil which is the New Testament as being authentic works of the same God, thus whir ling the two faiths together even tighter. Both Books claim to be storehouses of Numeri c and Alpha Numeric Code s in which only those who are trained in Kabbalah or Abja d can decipher. I read the Bible three times from cover to cover and it was only until the third ti me that the book “unlocked” one must agree that most Christians have never read the complete Bible. They may have come close, but skip books like Leviticus and “Numbers”. In these books there is lengthy detailing of numbers especially in the section concerning the building of the Temple. All these numbers are actually the Codes that can be deciphered to bring forth immense amounts of Gnostic information. A ll letters in Hebrew double as numbers so the numbers actually spell words. Those words were the names of various Energies related to controlling whatever was being discussed in that particular scripture in some symbol ic way. For example if it was 13 bushels of wheat, whatever that translated to in He brew was the God or Goddess of wh eat lets say IS.

When studying Islam I noticed certain incons istencies right away. Th e main one being the story concerning the intelligence level of Prop het Mohammad. It is sa id that Mohammad could neither read nor write and this put special emphasis on the Miracle, the Koran, purported to be given to him by an the Angel Gabril/Gabriel. After all, it lends a lot more credibility if a man who can neither read nor write all of a sudden appears with on e of the greatest Spiritual works of the time, rich in poetic meaning and Spiritual dialog. The original Book was said to be nume rically equivalent to the number 19 and was never translated into the vulgar languages. This book remains protected by the Sudanese till this day. Many anomalies exist within the book itself like all the chapters wh en added up produce a number divisible by the number 19. How many times Allah is mention in the whole Koran that number is divisible by 19. The first chapter Al-Fatiha when said correctly causes the tongue to touch the roof of the mouth 19 times. It exceeds a normal person’s capability after awhile to keep the consistencies of 19’s going. Even our modern comput ers could not do it since a story is also unfolding while the perfect numbers roll in place. This be came the sign of the Mu slims that Muhammad was Guided and in contact with the Great Deity Allah through His Ho st the Angel Gabril. The Angel Gabril is known to be the of th e Moon Gabriel. It seems where mo st of the Scholars and Spiritual leaders of today get lost is thinking that these religions are so separate. Also in question is the mandatory ceremony of Aqiqah established by Muhammad himself which consist of a sacrifice to Allah in the name of the child, two he-goats for a boy, and one he-goat for a girl. This incantation must be said during the sacrifice and feast “O Allah! I offer to thee instead of my own offspring life for life, blood for blood, head for head, bone for bone, hair for hair, and skin for skin. In the Name of the Great Allah, I do sa crifice this goat”. Why does it appear that Allah would even want a child to be sacrificed and some thing must expiate that? This is something that continues to reoccur in the histor y of mans involvement with these Gods. All of this I believe shows the reasoning of mankind is deluded. Even the people who are said to be the most devote in purity. If there is a God that wants us to sacrifice our childr en to Him then we have a war at hand. I’m saying this after millions of children have already been sa crificed and thousands continue to disappear. Who will face this foe? Bomar has fasten ed his Armor and who will join him? In Islam it says that Muhammad married Khadejah who was a rich businesswoman who choose Muhammad to run all of her busine ss dealings because he was a wiz with numbers. This begins to shake the foundation of Muhammad being illiterate se eing that if he knew ho w to add and subtract he also knew how to read and write, remember Arabic also has the same letter s for numbers. There was no doubt two Mohammads existed during that time . One was teaching pure Monotheism and the other was an invention of a man na med Musalymit, a political leader who saw the charisma of the real"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"197 | Page Muhammad and attempted to entice him to be a political leader. Muhammad, they said, would have no of it so Musalymit became hi s sworn enemy ultimately succeedin g in getting Muhammad poisoned or was it the other Muhammad?

We are no t the body it is only the vehicle to traverse this dimension and it is sluggish an d moveth about like a sq uare wheel going uphill. The Ka’bah itself in history was used at various times for idol worship although it is said the Mohammad came to do away with such things. The Ka’bah had been destroyed several times by razes, fires, and natural causes through history. On thos e occasions it was always men from Egypt of High Nobility who paid to rebuild it. The connection be tween Egypt and the Ka’bah is very heavy. It is known better as “the Shrine” and ha s been an object of veneration for hundreds of years. Laws exist such as if you walk around it 70 times all your sins are forgiven, if you pray in special section you get a better position in Paradise. As children these storie s can be fascinating but as adults we should know better. No amount of times walking around a cube will expiate you from wrong doing; life itself is the biggest example of that. Things are taken at times from the Ka’bah and sold, like the water from the well of Zem Zem and dust from the covering. Reason 145: A great deal of “Illumination” came from the Arabs and their affiliations with the Genies and Jinns called also in Hindu, Jaan meaning Devils. The religions of the world all connect and it is only the blinded that hold fast to their faith while talking about another. The true belief is internal. Pictured here Ila-Al-Ilahu, the Muslims are forbidden to carve images of the God for purposes of secrecy and sanctity. They used designs and their rich language to express what they viewed. Notice the Swastika on the Medallion. We see the same thing with Rael. Are you beginning to see that the inner circle is not as separate as they claim? It is the people who are divided defending the Gods as if they need the protection of Man, offering to them as if they eat food and spend money."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"198 | Page On of the most sacred parts of the Ka’bah is th e Stone Jewel placed in the corner as seen above.

Islam contains so many Sects from Sunni, Shiite, Sufi, Wahab, etc. its inner circle of mysticism remains unable to be included in the general religion itself. By this I mean the Arab world abounds with Sorcery, and many such practices however it is easy to pin that on the individual not the Believer since the Koran forbids such things. I believe one of the Four Gates of the world to be contained here. The belief in one God is also found in this faith however I question if the 1 God has a 5 letter name that is tossed about before acts of vengeance. Likewise the sacrifices are senseless and should be treated as such ."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"199 | Page recovered them were sa id to gain magical powers. This does so und a little more like a camp fire tale however there are 12 known Synerg y Crystals that are said to enhanc e the human ability, they are Moldavite, Danburite, Tanzanite, Azuztulite, Phenacite, Herderit e, Tibetan Tektite, Satyaloka Quartz, Petalite, Brookite, Natrolite, and Scolecite. Most of these stones are Meteorites that have fallen from space throughout time. Whether they came out of the crowns of Angels could be metaphoric. They are made of fore ign elements hardened into glass while entering our atmosphere. In Catholicism there are four great Angels Mich ael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel of whom the latter is sometimes swapped for other Angels but at le ast the other three stay the same. If you go to a Baptist church they will assure you they have nothing in common with Ca tholicism yet when the main prayers are taking place the names of the Angels are sometimes mentioned and they are of course the same. In Islam the same thing happen s and even in the New Age movement one often receives emails from someone who has channeled the Arch Angel Michael who sends light into the grid as we make our transcendence into the beyond and all that mumbo jumbo. So what does this tell you? It’s obvious that if the main workers for the religions have remained the same then all of the religions are in some way linked to the same source. Even deeper yo u will find that the name Michael means “one who is like God”. If I remember correctly there was only one who pretended he was like the Most High and We hurled him fr om space. Some may believe this is a stretch to advocate that Michael may be a Fallen Angel, ho wever, let us think again where th e term Angel really comes from. Reason 147: This is a well known painting of the Angel Gabril and Mohammad that has survived since antiquity. It strikes me as odd th at Gabril has black wings, which signifies a fallen Angel. In addition to this in several texts many men who went to the East to be come mystics say that Baphomet and Mahomet where the same Be ing and were worshipped in mystic Islam. A Muslim would call such statements sacrilegious however Baphomet also has black wings. It seems that all the old religions are tied to horn ed Gods some way or another, the Age of Ram."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"200 | Page First off it should be mentioned that in the Hebrew doctrines they classify their Angelic Beings as Aralim, Chesmalim, Aphanim, Ophanim, Malachim , Chioth Haqudush, etc. This means they do not group all their Spirit forces toge ther and just call them all Angels in fact that term is foreign to them. This is because in encountering these Bein gs through evocation the Magicians and Cabbalist learned that many of them were ve ry different from the others so they categorized them as such. Again the term Angel comes from the word Angle. It appe ars only Fallen Angels respond when evoked. In other writings it says many tribes wandered after what they called the Chaldean Baalim, although it has not been determined that all the “IM’S” mentio ned above can be grouped under that one title it seems highly possible. In other cultures Angels are given names such as Sukallin and Amesha Spentas. The main concern is the actual uses given fo r these Beings. It describes that some reveal treasure, some make women fall in love with you, so me give you amnesty etc. I would highly consider again why would a High Vibration Being want to gr ant a human undeserved fa vors just because they knew how to do a ritual. There is of course much more at stake when entering into leagues with these types of Spirits and most have unleashed a never en ding karmic sea-saw for tampering with spiritual forces for selfish means. Reason 148: Since their plans have reached completion they are now prepared to tell the world bluntly about their involvement with Angels, Demons, Baalim, Gregori, Nephalim, Rephaim, and who knows what else. We can assume there are always things that will not be talked about until they happen, just as its never good to tell anyone your desires before they come to pass. Be watchful of these Watchers. Some things I have put direct emphasis on and may have been a little repetiti ve, I have done this on purpose so that it may sti ck with you. Spirituality and Science as a couple have first birthed monsters just as Cain was the first child of Adam and Eve. It is these mons ters that have become very strong thought form s moving about on their own will and totally uncontrollable by those who originally brought them forth.

The biggest hint is the Ethernet cable, why is it given such a Name? Ether itself means Spirit so why is a te rm like that being used in comparison to computers? Since the Ozone “Oz Zone” layer is melting there is no telling what the potential is if it’s dissolved. Favor is often disguised as misfortune. Reason 149: These shapes are created by Advanced Sound Devices used by the Elite to place frequencies into the Earth grid.

That type of control is mind control in its purest degr ee very hard to notice due to its subtlety and necessity.

It is the same false light that says it has come to Illuminate those wh o are humble and worship it. Light in the Latin is Luce named after Lucifer the bright mourning star or Venus. The stra tegy they are using is to give you two choices in which both are no good. The word Democratic tak ing its root from the Arabic word Demos or Demon and Republican taking its root from the word Reptile or Rephaim. So the choice is Reptiles or Demons you choose. To prove this one simply has to note how many times leaders and Presidents have been photographed making th e sign of Baphomet the Goat God of Mendes. Due to bloodlines of the Presidents of the U.S. having Merovingian origin they are defini tely blue blood reptilian hybrids walking around the White House and Parliament hailing from the Orion constellation, Venus, Agharta, Mars, Vulcan and who knows where else.

I’m sure many reading this are familiar with David Icke’s work so it is unnecessary to re iterate what he has been explaining for years in detail thus I have been mainly covering how the blending took place. Reason 152: Here is what commonly happens. Because the Light cannot comprehend the Darkness many who do not have such strong evil inclinations refuse to believe anyone, especially their leaders who have such charisma, could be involved in such a vile plot of enslaving humanity. The recent Zeitgeist movie, obviously directed by the Elite, shifts the blame of our current world state on the by product of humanity making the wrong decisions in regards to how the Planet is preserved, thus their solution is the “Venus” Project. Anything related to Venus you will find the Dark Lord in th e midst of. This is why it gives you power to know such things so you cannot be easily fooled as the masses often are. The same companies that were talked about on the first Zeitgeist were those who funded it, they have no shame in admitting that. Highlight the problem, provide a solution ."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"204 | Page First off the term itself is Animist. An Animist is a person that emulates worships, and sometimes mates with animals in or der to gain the ability of that pa rticular animal. In Africa there was no limit to how many tribes we re Animist and much of the inform ation on how to do such things came from Africa. The ancients played a dot-to-d ot with the stars in the heavens making animal outlines in the constellations based on the energy th ey “felt” was emitting from the stars. One of the main tribes known to do this were the Nubians from the Temple of Sheba discussed earlier. It is true the actual Garden of E.DIN was so mewhere in Kush the lush land of Nubia where the 4 Rivers flowed and the Queen of the South was in position as ruler over the “horn” of Africa. Remember Nubia had all the gold mines th at made the Pharaohs rich beyond their imaginations, that is of course when they could su bdue it and collect Tribut e. The Nubians proved to be a challenge as the Annuals re cord lengthy wars between the Nu bians and Egypt. Even Alexander the Great, the Legendary “Two Horn”, known by the Arabs as Dul Qurnain who built the wall to keep the hordes away from the Holy Land wa s turned back at Nubia when faced with Candace commanding Elephants in legions for war. This I be lieve fueled much of the “animosity” between the Europeans and the darker Nubians which they later enslaved and dragged the Americas. In the end Nubia took over Egypt completely ri ght around the time it was due to crumble anyway, just as Obama has taken over the U.S. The Nubians later inherited the “new version” of Christianity by Missionarie s infesting their country. It is said in Arabian Prophecy that the Nubians will rise again and destroy the Ka’bah and it will neve r be restored. Ethiopia has Ether as its root, the people have smooth dark beautiful skin, silky hair, and lulling eyes. The first stories of the serpent who were called Nagas, were in Nubia first and then they mi grated to Persia. They are called by the Nubians Negusi, which is a we ll respected last name in th eir country till this day. Reason 153: The Naga are more in the image of the Serpents described in Japan and China rather than bipedal hybrids. As I said before the Serpent races are as vast as our own possibly a lot more diverse. It is clear man has inhabited this Planet, along with the serpents for thousands of years intermingling, we easily forget the Dinosaurs. Will there ever be a truce?"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"205 | Page Walt Disney put so much work and emphasis on Animation because he was deeply involved in creating the framework for the new wave of animal istic mind control that began on a person as a child. Let us examine one story of the biggest cart oon maker in history Walt Disney. The story itself begins before Walt Disney steps on the scene but has to do with a certain man that Walt Disney was well acquainted with. This man grew up in Russia du ring hard times. In order for one to even seek the audience of the Queen or the Royal Court in these times, you had to discover something exceptionally useful for the Empire. If you were no t of wealthy stock this was the only way to turn around an otherwise miserable life for you and your family as the Black Pl ague swept over the land. This gentleman deemed he would do it through th e Occult and soon enough he discovered what was later called Phantasmagoria with the tag line “Optical Illusions and Mechanical works of Art”. "},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"206 | Page Since I’m really in this for the children I have a special assignment to dethrone this Devil Disney. If we pull together as a peop le it should be because of things like this that hurt children no matter the color or race. He not only used Pedophil ic suggestive mind control techniques in his films, his organization, obviously run by the Dark Lord hi mself, continues to put forth mind altering media that gets worse as time goes on. Phantasmagoria is the Art of evoking Demoniac Spirits which obviously Disney knew all about since he wrote Fant asia. Taking a look at that movie now with your eyes open will reveal an entirely different pictur e versus what you may have perceived before. In the English language the play on the word “K id” is obvious. A kid is a baby goat. In the days when Phantasmagoria first began they lacked the T.V. so they accomplished it by smoke, pre-recorded sounds of actual torture, an d lights. Showed above, ma ny participants claimed they had never seen or heard anythi ng so horrifying. They could not tell if the Demons were real or still a part of the light show. Of course the demons we re real. On the back of many Disney titles it still contains the Trademark Phantasmagoria meaning this special art was us ed while making the film. Of course people thought this was incredible becoming lovers of horror. That was all an outward scheme and many suffered mental and sp iritual damage while trenched in the frames of Wonderland. This brings us to the Gregorian Chants. A long time ago it was discovered that when singing certain twisted hymnals you could actually bring th e lower forms forth by so und. One would have to be a Master at singing these hymns perfectly and to this end the Masters of the Gregorian Chants were created. When you are listening to certain mu sic from Gothic times always featured on the soundtracks of Disney film s and many others, it is actually the Gregorian Chants playing at least in the background. Remember Gregori is another name for the Fallen Angels and is actually the creature Nimrod is always seen holding in his hand. I cannot put enough emphasis on how powerful sound is and how it effects humans, animals, and even other Beings. The Chants have lead to possession in humans just as the Serpent can be charmed with a flute. Rap is now wrapping up the mind of the youth so their minds are so tied up they are immobilized, but not for long. Sound is also a key ability we can use. A frequency can be fired at the body causing all shells, lower life forms, to break free from the body. It is at that moment a person knows that they were actually on them. One can never know what it is like to be clean until they are truly washed, but not in the blood of a lamb , come on look what they are saying. This is not just a figure of speech, the sub-co nscious mind has to make sense of it all and it does it literally. Reason 155: People are made to believe Disney wa s a big kid like we all wish to be playing in a fantasy world of Castles of Medieval lure with Dr agons, Princesses, and tal king mice. Disney, along with other very sick men positioned themselves to be the corrupters of the innocent youth.

We will just call them th e “V”. The V as a symbol is the Roma n numeral 5. Five is more properly called “Penta” the “Pent” on Penta has the same meaning as the “Pent” on Ser”pent”. The original origin of the word “Pent” is a feather thus the wo rd “Serpent” actually mean s “feathered snake”. This also links to our main strategic defense buildi ng the Pentagon which still means “feathered dragon/snake”. If you remember the movie The V the story line goes that some reptilian like Beings from another Planet came to Earth saying they could help us with technology but in all actuality they had come to take over our Planet an d enslave everyone. They did this by infiltrating the government replacing various key people with clones until they could make willing servants of the rest. The only force opposing this was “The Resistance” the name of my first website before I even knew all of what I know now. During the times of Oracles unity between th e woman and the serpent was elevated and many women became worshippers of the God “S”. On e of the most popular was Europa who was worshipped in Sidon. The time center of the Eart h the Serpent wrapped itself around they call him Ouraborus. Europa moved to the isla nd of Crete to establish a full se rpent worship and occult training center. If you don’t believe this is a fact I will tell you a secret. The word is actually “Se”Crete” which also means venom that comes from the pores, a wh ite puss or emission. The island of Crete also contains a place known as Gnosis and of course th is is where the whole Gnosticism movement began which is where you find more roots of the Serpen t. When looking at a stat ue of the Goddess Europa you will see her holding snakes in each hand. She is simply another part of the pyramid and the “Is” in Gnosis is the sign that Isis is present. Know Isis/Know Sis? JESUS/IOSUS/ISIS/OSIS/OSIRUS/SIRIUS.

There is now one group of Masters of the Gregorian Chants that even perform in Las Ve gas, people think it sounds just like good Opera. One of the Four Pa triarchs of Catholicism was Gregori; he was with no doubt incarnate Gregori. He wrote the Hymnals, also keep it mind it was the evil Gregori who created the Calendar we are on, the Gregoria n Solar Calendar. It is also known that when the Arabs visited the Russians to see if they wo uld pay for mystical secrets the Russians made a large Banquet for the Shah, the actual menu I will be sure to pu t in the second edition, if there is one. While the Shah was stuffing himself the Russians were playing the Gregorian Chants in the other room.

This of course starts as a baby the moment that yo u exit the womb of your mother. Wh ile a child is in the womb it is in all actuality seeing in 5D. The reason this is possible is due to the baby looking through the water Reason 157: Indeed Old Ouraboru s knows many things but it is a Deceiver trapped in the abyss of the Universe and will never ascend.

Is it not better to be an ant when you need to eat and a mountain when you wish to rest? I will give you some advice, never serve anything that has been created and you will get far. Keep the Most High as your focal point only and you will fare well in the future. If you come to a fork in the road, go straight .

Anyone that ha s seen Spirits often note that they appear more superfluous with no clear edges and at times gaseous. This is what the ba by is seeing so it becomes easy for them to recognize the mother. They are looking more at the mothers design or pattern rather than her actual physical appearance. When the child is born the damage begins through the procedures the doctors are using. Remember that Doctors are under the Oath of Ca duceus and have sworn to uphold many things detailed in the Oath that most Doctor s don’t even understand what they really mean. It is almost like putting your right hand over your heart and pledging your allegiance to the flag. You don’t really know what you just did, but that will not stop it from having an effect . WHAT YOU DON’T KNOW CAN HURT YOU. If the eye on a stove is on but you do not know it and put your hand on it, will it still burn you, of course. This is by no means saying that all Doct ors are initiated into some Serpent mystery school and intend to kill off the youth, of course that would be extreme, but what they do has an effect and this is its ultimate inte ntion whether they know it or not. Those that created the backbone of the studies en tailed, along with the procedures of medical care, were completely aware of what they set out to do as far as hindering the mental, physical, and Spiritual growth of people seekin g their help. This has been done through their constant introduction of new medicinal “potions” more properly called “poi sons”. Along the way many practitioners notice several things that can be done much better and some even switch to becoming Naturopathic Doctors. Most remain involved and when they become Doctor s they simply be come prescribers of medication not healers. It becomes as easy as locating th e symptom and then prescribing the drug. The drug company will be sure to let them know which drug takes care of what along with at times free vacations if they promote the drug. I don’t need to remark here abou t the many side effects of drugs, however, there is greater damaged done to the actual Chakra system of the person than anything else. For example when a person experiences heart problems Re juvenators know that there is some type of blockage in the heart Chakra. This could be due to a lost loved one, intense stress, or variou s situations related to the heart. The correct healing method is to begin working on th e persons heart Chakra so they can get clearance. This removes the Spiritual ailment from the soul wh ich will in turn remove the physical ailment from the body. The physical ailm ent itself is just another method the body uses to tell a person about a mental or spiritual problem when it is not getting a solution for it. This fact was known heavily in the mystery school s of the ancients, especially Egypt. These types of treatments free a person however and that is no t the goal. They would rath er begin to administer medicines that actually block Chakra centers giving the person a fals e sense of temporary relief. There are many more Chakra centers than just 7 and ea ch play a unique roll. Blocking them will bring temporary relief but cause lo ng term damage over time."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"211 | Page Another example is when one takes an Aspirin fo r headaches the Aspirin tells the brain to kill the headache sensation. This does not fix the reason why the headache originally occurred. When you do this too many times whatever was initially causing the headac he will choose another center to convey the information of the problem which could th en be the stomach. So the person may begin to experience stomach aches, then they will take something like Pepto Bismal which is more like a liquid Aspirin that dulls the stomachs senses blocking the Chakra and not curing the original problem. This goes on and on until the person is now taking drug s for everything, which will of course increase the problem. After awhile the over-the-counter drugs cease to work and the person finds they are very sick being totally polluted by over-the-counter drugs. So they move on to stronger prescription drugs. When a baby is born the incandescent light loc ated on most birth tables does extensive damage to the child’s retina. This begins the process of stopping the child from naturally seeing other dimensions thus other life forms. Full spectrum lights are the only li ghts found not to cause damage to the eyes. If the child remains able to see other dimensions when it gets older it can easily see that this world is an Illusion.

Of course the agenda is to take this ability away from the child. Next they begin the shots which lower the child’ s vibration dramatically through the injection of viruses that are foreign to the sy stem. All vaccines contain the actual virus it is designed to prevent in lower dosages in order to so-called “develop” your systems immunity to it. It also means the virus is now in your body at low levels and that can’t be good for the natural system especially as a child. Not to mention the Doctors hands all over the babies head during the time the “sof t spot” is still fresh. Many doctors are stressed and have been delivering several babies in one day. Some even smoke cigarettes between deliveries and when they touch the child’s soft spot all of that energy is transferred to the child. The delivery procedure has now reac hed a state of barbarism with the advent of the Caesarian Section/Caesar/Sea Snake.

Has one never noti ced that the nursery rhymes from long ago still survive today being played by thes e chime boxes? The famous “Go to sleep, Go to sleep, go to sleep little baby,” you can hear it even now. With this thing spinning over the babies head in a circular motion using certain sounds the baby is tuned even more. One can imagine the results of thousands of hours the baby spends alone with this insane toy in the cube. As the tot begins to get older it is introduc ed to cartoons. The word begs one to ask what exactly is being “Tuned”. A quick search will show that “Car” was actually a blood thirsty Deity that abused children but is that such a stretch to what’s really going on in an innocent children’s cartoon? When the cathode ray tube was in vented many men including Disney used it as a catalyst to the next level of mind control th rough Hexagonal Color Embedding. Next the Widescreen Digital Television was introduced. The key is the “aspect ratio” which is a way to “open the mind” of the viewer. When a person is viewing a widescreen their eyes become slightly cock ed in separate directions in order for them to be able to view the whole screen. Those studying Me taphysics know that the position of the eyes equate to different states of consciousness. When your eyes are spread wide your third eye is stretched open. This is a much more effective portal for mind control. Even now many tribes maintain that they are descendants from Serpent races, however, what they are always excluding is that the Serpent races ge nerally cross bred with them in a forcible manner. These types of Serpents, which ar e not your common garden snake, do not stay on the surface but remain in underground cave rn systems; few report actually encountering th ese Beings face-to-face although some have, like myself. I will tell you they are Shape Shifte rs and take on a Humanoid form however it still becomes evident by the shape of their skull and brow, which is something like a diamond, that they are Reptilian. It would be of value to know that the Serpent races are far more advanced than we are at this particular moment. They bought many things that made them appear as Gods to the indigenous people who were discovering a new world after the flood. These Entities were so far ahead they had already a ccomplished hyperdimensional spac e travel. The Serpent races are resource gatherers and it is known they have been robbing the Earth and other Planets in this system of various resources since day one. They have interfered “Enter Fear” with our natural cycle. Pyramid means Fire “Pyra” in the Center. This symbolizes the flame or fiery nature of the Serpent.

Many of the members of the Serpent races during these times simply burrow deeper into the ground towards the center of the Earth in order to escape the damage that is wreaked on the surface.

The mistake many Magicians have made when being offered Immortality is not considering these two things. 1. We are already immort al and if we were not purposely made to forget that profound fact, we would know that. 2.

Master knowledge is knowing that the move ments of things hold great external knowledge, but there are parts of that knowledge that should never be placed internal as it will effect the Host as something foreign, changing the en tire makeup of the Host. Imagin e if the Sun never rose again, would people sleep all the time because it was dark ? Of course not, however, people still consider when the Sun goes up and then back down one day ca n be counted. They age th emselves with ideas of their birthday but we will not stray to far down the pa th of the wisdom of agel essness. It is known that the Moon bett er known by the ancients as “S in” was placed into our solar system at some point in time however it was not or iginally here. Many of the indigenous tribes who had already made contact with other constellations had maps that did not include the Moon on them. Then at a certain time in history all of a sudden th e Moon begins to appear on astrological outlines. One should innerstand the effects of this partic ular Moon on this Eart h. The Moon controls “Moo”ds. The Moon controls tides, the Moon controls growth and t hus decay, and most importantly things like gravity and magnetic en ergy. I noticed when the Moon eclips es it is easy to get out of the body. So it is easy to see that there would be a big difference in the energy of our world if the Moon was not here. Many do not know that the change woul d actually be positive. Many have done studies on the notion that the Moon was somehow towed here and by the size of many of the ships belonging to these Entities that is entirely possible. So I know you may be saying the Moon, okay mayb e it could be towed because it is not hot but nothing can tow the Sun. Today you will find info rmation on a top secret project known as the Lucifer Project. In this project an attempt is being made to detonate a plutonium payload into Saturn thus causing it to go Super Nova and become a Sun. Other Planets have also been considered. This was already put into trial when NASA detonated the Cassini Space Probe with Plutonium on board into Jupiter creating a whole the size of Earth. The idea was to create a chain reaction; it is good that did not succeed or maybe it did. It would then appe ar as if we had two Suns in our sky and we would begin to receive lots of Plan etary energy through the rays emitting from the new Son. One would have to look deeper into things to understand where man received this type of knowledge from.

Our word Ice comes from Isis in their theories men are Suns an d women are Ice, not Moons, two opposites. This entire matter becomes a little more difficult to exac tly pinpoint due to the fact that most of us have never traveled into the cosmos thus all the informati on we receive is second and third hand and surely altered. The Elite of course have neve r been famous for telling the truth. There are Planets and Bein gs that have long since graduated beyond such petty things as what we are now experiencing on Earth th us we take notes from them.

There is The World, You, and the Outer Forces. You must consider your Arrival, Transition, and Breakthroughs. Your states are Physical, Emotional, and Intellectual. Being conscious of how you perceive things thro ugh all of these channels is key. One can easily see that dissecting the Gnostic story in the Bible takes heavy pondering. It would be good to remember that when the Bible came in to wider circulation in 1611 most people could not read. The Bible was kept as a Talism an or something of the sort that was believed to ward of evil by having it around. This is the clear indicator th at when they begun swashb uckling lands and beating the people into submission they where in no position to exam ine anything about Iesu, Nazarites, Grails, Illuminati, Jesuits or anythi ng of the sort. They were following blindly their lusts for riches and rank. So truly it is only recently that the Bibl e has ever been properly dissected by someone who is none partial and not in fear of death and excomm unication, after all that is already happening. The path our parents chose was generally what their parent chose and so on down the line. Another point is what takes place in the Universiti es. This is normally where lots of trickery begins. Often times many embark on professions that really contain no skill without the aid of some type of Machine. This is the other part of the war against the Machines. A false sense of intelligence is created when a person learns how to operate lets say an Electron Micros cope or Array Device. Without this device howeve r there would be no place for their particular skill. Having the ability to operate it proficiently falsely elevates them in mental status. The person usually cannot build these devices from scratch because they lack the knowledge and especially the equipment for fabrication. If they ever go into a country where the basic skills like agriculture, irrigation, construction, and other core abilities are required they will go from Rocket Scientist to Janitor. Nothing they have learned is really of value; they have not learned or understood the true in ner workings to things. This is very similar to how many people view th e world, all the real information about what really controls things they simply don’t possess, that’s now about to change. We have witnessed this with the fall of Silicon or should I say “Silly Con”. In places like the United States the Elite find the people very hard to control now and much too independent. This is why jobs have been moved to places like India and China where the people are much more passive and less opinionated due to thousands of years of Domi nant Monarchist rule. Even now there are plans being discussed about a population decrease. You can imagine the Elite have made the people build a world to its capacity and now they want to enjoy it all for themselves and remove those that are not a part of their groups from the more pristine places. In the event ther e is all out chaos they will watch from the Moon. All major cities are located on energy centers, the middle of the vorte x being given the name “Down Town” alluding to the center of a vortex. Peop le are naturally attracted to these energy centers like pigeons, so they tend to pile up in cities. When looking at state s like Texas you see miles and miles of unused fertile land that could ease the tension of the masses if they were allowed to inhabit these"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"220 | Page territories. When going to some of these places you will find one or two people own thousands of acres that they are doing nothing with. What kind of buffoonery is this when a person can just come and say “this is my land and if you want it, it will cost you “X” amount of dollars” when that land was stolen from the original inhabitants in the first place. In various countries were there are limited resour ces and harsh weather, if borders did not exist they could easily inhabit other part s of the world. The Elite have crea ted a false sense of prejudice that makes the people hate each other but love their Leaders and I”cons”. When the United States joined World War II which seemed to turned the tides, the stage was set for America to appear as if it had saved the world from the terrible Anti-Christ Hitler . Nothing could be further from the truth. As thousands of soldiers died on both sides the rulers of many countries began to orchestrate the division of the people, drawing new borders and boundaries. When the war was over high rankin g officials from the Nazi part y depending on rank went to other places to enjoy their plunder. Hitler and members of the Theosophical Society went into Antarctica after long stays in Argentina sipping th e finest wine from Argentinean Vineyards. They eventually returned to the Hyperborean entrance to the Pole. Other officials went from Argentina and traveled through South and Central America thro ugh the extensive cavern systems located there also. The only ones who did not get an upgrade where the regular people who succeeded in only killing each other. They received a war torn nation that had been reduced to rubble, a sound hatred for their neighbor, and a seculari sm that has yet repair itself. While the Elite laugh and toast a job well done they began anot her phase. The Theosophical Society set up right in the United Nations and proclaimed itself the reli gion of the future. This will be how the world is prepared for the Beast, the Dragon, and the Fals e Prophet. Thule/Cthulhu is the brain behind the New Age Movement and the return of the Golden Age of Aquarius. All decisions are made by the Ascended Masters of Thule and th ose decisions are then passed to their proper representatives in the U.N. This is already going on so this is not a warning of something to come. This is something that is alread y happening. The 800 Billion borro wed by Obama was to allow those high enough on the Pyramid to go abroad, change ov er the currency, and set up elsewhere before they snatch the carpet from underneath th e U.S. They are only waiting for the green light that most in the inner circle have secured themselves. When the U.S. market crashes the spiritual leaders of the world will come together once more like th ey did in 1986 is Assisi Italy at St. Francis Basilica. They will once again play the show of all coming together and the belief in the same God. Then they will unveil God’s new representative to everyone. Th e Power behind this individual will be Sanat Kumara I anagram this as “A Mark Satan” th ere is a U “You” left over. When these Beings come on the scene if one did not prepare before you saw their ac tual arrival, it is too late.

I tell you the truth people will wander astray when th ey see these signs and wonders which can be done through spiritual powers or technolo gy and they have both . Look at how they sh ow up for Chris Angel and he doesn’t have an ilk of charisma compared to the Ascended Masters. In all works it speaks of this time when humans will have a final moment in making a choice to give there freedom and souls up for what will appear to be an answer to their problems. It will appear there are no other options for those who do not begi n to prepare now. Most wi ll accept it no problem as they see their leaders and Icons direct them to it, just like they did when they wanted to endorse Obama, that was a test run, but not without its draw backs. It will last for only a moment if it is a second and then they will see why they should ha ve listened to all the redundant warnings that everyone keeps getting and ignori ng on some level or another. I believe this also to be a pivotal point in ou r future existence on a level extending into our afterlife. This is all happening now in you primary reality, so no matter who tells you “it’s a hologram” or “it’s your perception”, if I pinch yo u will it hurt? Our world needs us to begin to act like who we really are. Simply imagine if you were “fully activa ted” all Chakras on, could you not make a difference that would echo across the world?

One should just ask for Knowledge, Wisdom, and Innerstand then you ca n decipher anything. Knowledge is all the information, non-partial, Wisdom is the ability to sort through that information and find the perfect calibration for your life, Inne rstanding is coming to terms with why all things happen and thus you escape Duality.

I know my reason; I’ve given the reader now several to determine theirs. This is only to give you a fuller life of meaning rather than the redundant cycle of time where humans are harvested for energy and go about Feeding, Fearing, and Fornicating until they perish back into atoms. This system which exist has with it certain secretes that allow it to carry on as such. We can call them the rules of the Matrix in wh ich some can be bent and others br oken. This is also the secret to the “ME’s”. One of those ME’s is called the Tablet of Destiny and remains in the possession of the Elite. It was said that whoever ha d it could control many things. Th ese ME’s where the names, relics, and even spirits of power. Amongst all the Gods stories it describes a pl ot by the Female Goddess Inanna to obtain the Tablet of Destiny from the Go ds by cunning. In the society of the Annunaki the female of their breed are not allowed to rule. Wi thout taking you through the whole story which can be found in the Sumerian tablets it will suffice to say that one female of their species gained control over the Tablets of Destiny. Isis in legend slips a Serpent on Ra to poison him and he cannot cure himself. Isis then makes Ra promise to give her His tr ue creative name in this case an actual Spirit or Ba of Ra. Ra agrees and Isis cures him and then the power is transferred to her bosom. This Ba/Spirit has now been placed in a st one called the Stone of Scone.

In secret societies and religi ous circles various types of worship and sacrifices take place that continue to give these relics power.

The Brazen Serp ent was a Symbol of Christ. Abraham was a type of God the Father, and Isaac a Symbol of Christ the Ram of Sacrifice. Eve slew mankind, but the Virgin Mary gave them life.

The rock smitten by Moses was Christ, and Moses smote it longwise and brea dthwise to symbolize the Cross. Moses’ rod was the Cross, the water that flowed fr om the rock was the teaching of the Apostles. The darkness brought upon Egypt for three days symb olized the darkness of the Crucifixion. The Amalekites symbolized the devils, Aaron and Hor, who held up Moses’ hands, symbolized the two thieves who were crucified with Christ. Thus the entire Bible feeds from one story placed in several allegories and parables. I bore of the Riddler who does nothing more then confuse what is simple. A man develops the fertilizer while a woman makes the egg. Many ne ver sit and think how mystical this is that an actual egg is inside of the woman’s body at various stages. Now we get to the meat of things. The Adepts know that when a woman is due to bring forth a special child the fertilized egg itself contains the child before it “hatches”. The period of incub ation that takes place before it cracks open is called “ruling from the Egg”. How many remember the tale of the Goose who laid the Golden Egg? Of course that ta le had a hidden meaning. There is an egg that is about to hatch as some already have and inside those eggs are things I’m not even at leisure to discuss, si nce We have shined light on more than enough to keep one up thinking long into the night. I will say that those who will come from these eggs will be different then the normal human and possess abilities that we can unlock, but most do not use at this moment and trust you will need them. You can see this all as a way used to give you a sense of urgency. Reptiles lay eggs thus they have to wait for the eggs to hatch, some take longer than othe r depending upon what is being brought forth.
