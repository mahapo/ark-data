Furthermore, what can one expect in the coming years, and even in the next couple of hundred years? It is not enough to examine everything from a strictly political or cultural perspective, since reality also includes extrapolitical, extracultural and potentially even extraterrestrial factors. And, in addition, any kind of problem, whether sociocultural or planetary, cannot be truly solvedfrom the same state of consciousness in which it was created. Over the past several years since the first volume of Matrix III was completed, it has become quite evident that exposition of the paradigm was not complete. Perhaps the extradimensional nature of doing Matrix IV contributed to that realization. Yet, as I have previously indicated, it is no longer enough to know what is going on. In order to learn, expand and evolve individually and as a species, we must truly understand how and why these things have come about. OtheMise, not only is the species condemned to repeat the same things over again, but there is also the growing reality that we cannot repeat the same things again and survive intact as a viable, evolving species. Many may be under the impression that the game is over, that humanity is doomed or deserves to be swept away by some extraterrestrial, geopolitical or planetary factor. Or, that humanity is an ''infe~tation'~ overpopulating the planet. After studying the matter intently for several years, I am totally convinced that neither of these notions is either appropriate or represents the actuality that is, in fact, in progress. As was indicated in Matrix IF', there exists sufficient evidence that there will be a period ahead where the planet will be less populated, that interaction will gingerly begin to occur with other humanoid species, and that development of alternate technological and non-technological ways of doing things in harmony with this planet will occur'. Absolutely no doubt. The indicators are in Matrix IV and also in Matrix II, where the co-existing \"done deal\" manifested as the presence of the Essessani give us an intuitive insight into the fact that humanity does evolve and, combined with the insights in Matrix N, that the planet does become ecologically restored, and that life does move on to other more productive and creative levels. All of this is not some hypothetical, idealistic pipe dream borne out of fantasy. It is, in fact, already a done deal. Let us \"catch up\" to it, with a sense of passion and commitment, not only to each other, but to the planet and the glory of creation. Although one cannot gain a true appreciation of the multi-hierarchical spectrum of activity only through a simple analysis of cultural progression and events, it becomes necessary to stand back from a more expansive perspective and examine the questions voiced at the beginning of the introduction. Once having accomplished this, it then becomes possible to examine the continuation of the paradigm of Matrix III, and perhaps the totality of the Matrix series, with an entirely new understanding. After two years of work, this book is finally complete. Use it wisely .Peace to you and yours. vhb 1 Which is, in fact, the theme and paradigm of Matrix V."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The Premise of This Work I am sure most people wonder why nothing seems to get better in daily life, despite all efforts made by those with the best intentions. People wonder why voting doesn't work, why political solutions don't work and why the death and disease rate in society keeps on getting worse. People wonder why wars are fought, why seemingly innocent men, women and children die, and why society seems to be getting more and more violent, chaotic and authoritarian. People wonder about the profision of control freaks and the idea of personal fieedom and its apparent erosion. People wonder if all of this reflects a chaotic progression of events or .... if it is being done in accordance with a plan that is somehow intentional. People wonder if there is a basis for everything that is being done in the world today. People wonder if the plan for everything happening is political, ideological or conceptual, and what lies behind all of it on the deepest levels of thought. So did I. Up until now, it has not been possible to probe deep enough to uncover the basic ideas behind what is happening, the premises that control the reality picture that those who maintain themselves as \"elite\" use to justifj7 their actions. It is a reality picture that is based on false premises and false science, and people need to be educated so that the unmasking of the uale horse will induce its dis~lacement, allowing all of us to proceed into a better world, a better life style and an evolving future. Violent action is not an oution. Violent action makes you one of them. Conscious, focused action in doing what you prefer to do in an evolving direction, rather than trying to stamp out what you do not prefer, will simply and completely displace the old paradigm. Elitists will no longer be able to pull the wool over the eyes of an awakened planet, a planet ready to evolve and join the rest of the universe. Elitism is on the way out. Cooperation and mutual aid is on the way in. We do not need a One World Order. We do need a One World Communitv. The former will insure our extinction. The latter will mean our collective survival. It is not idealism. It is a realism that is patterned after nature and the universe. There is no option, After the initial section in the book describing how and why things got to this point, it then becomes the task to show how current planetary happenings fit into the framework and to prove, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that those perpetrating the current cultural paradigm know exactly what they were doing and did it intentionally in order to implement the current suppressive framework which they have thrust upon the planetary population. The current paradigm reflects a long period of suppression of ideas and substitution of those ideas for ones promoting an agenda based on ego aggrandizement, identification with the physical body, image, and psychological manipulation based on fear, security, sensation and power. Reading the first volume of Matrix 111 is a prerequisite to this second volume, otherwise you will not achieve a total understanding of what is being put forth in this volume. We'll show you the premise and the thought patterns, then the data. You're smart enough to put them together. It will take about three generations to straighten the planet out after the current paradigm is displaced. Let us all work together to build a better world for our children and generations to come; generations that are not separate fiom themselves or the universe of which they are a part."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 .

Initially, I thought that a simple analysis of a chronological linearity should evoke some recognizable patterns that would yield a series of clues. After compiling over 200 pages toward that end', it was evident that some patterns of activity were present, yet the basic cause of the behavior of governments, those who determine themselves to be the elite, and the activities within society epitomized by culture in the United States remained at arms length. After two years of research and months of discussion with some of my more erudite compadres2, I think we have come up with some definitive answers. It is not enough to simply extend the research embodied in the first volume of Matrix IU. In order to extricate ourselves as a society fiom the wearisome position we are in, we must totally understand what underlies the cultural position in which we find ourselves, since problems cannot be solvedfiom the same state of consciousness in which they were created. If we stand back far enough, we ought to be able to see where it all began, where it is and where it is all going on a cultural level. Discussions in Matrix IV were quite relevant to the hre in general, especially in reference to the progression of consciousness. However, it is the present and the immediate fbture that concern people the most. Let's give it a whirl. The Paradigm The word paradigm refers to a system of belief: Paradigms that underlie the way a society thinks, or is lead to think, believes, or is lead to believe, and also embody a conception of its past, present, future and the continuity of existence. Obviously, what the public is led to believe does not accurately reflect the truth. It cannot, when you have a segment of society that believes it is better than the rest of society. If you want to see revisionist history, science and truth - go the public library. This has become pretty transparent, even to many of those thoroughly steeped in social consciousness. Types of Paradigms Inherent in a Culture With all of this in mind, an examination of the institutions of society and the end products of the paradigm ought to lead back to the origin of the paradigm. Paradigms that define the whole of existence are called basalparadigm?, and these are at the very root of socialparadigms, which are paradigms that model existence as perceived by a qecific ' The chronology discussed is found at the end of this volume of Matrix III. The conceptual discussion on basal paradigms, as well as the progression of paradigms as discussed in this chapter, could not have been accomplished without the kind assistance of Dr. Dan Hall and Dr. Bruce Lipton, to whom I am deeply indebted. A deeper discussion of these matters is embodied in the new book entitled Avoiding Extinction by Dr. Dan Hall. Basal paradigms begin as conjectures and speculative thought patterns, often caused by unusual events."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Comparative Concepts of Elitism ELITISM: In Nature L ELITISM: In Contemporary estem Society (After Darwin SUPPRESSION FOR THE BENEFIT OF WHOLE GROUP FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELITE GROUP MUTUAL COOPERATION \"Live and Let Live\" MUTUAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCE EQUITY ENRICHMENT OF SPECIES COMPETITIVE STRUGGLE \"Survival of the Fittest\" \"Live and Let Die\" I ETHNIC \"CLEANSING\" & RACISM I HOLOCAUSTS GENETIC IN-BREEDING and DISEASE EVOLUTION DEVOLUTION PROGRESSION EXTINCTION -- (c) 1995 Leading Edge Research"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO society through the filter of the basal paradigm. Within the social paradigm are group paradigms that are models of existence held to be true by groups within a society. The National Security Council, the Bilderbergers, the United Nations, the Royal Society of England, the American Medical Association, various religious groups, scientists, political parties, biologists, the American Cancer Society, the Mafia, the American Psychiatric Association are examples of sociological groups that maintain unique models of existence. A elite4 group is one that considers itself to have the only valid model of existence. There are innumerable group paradigms within a society, yet all the group paradigms today that embody those considering themselves elite are variations having their roots in a faulty basal paradigm, an interpretation of existence not reflecting that which operates in nature and the universe. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that the most accurate model of existence does not support a type of elitism, thus the most accurate basalparadigm is not the one that is currently operating in society. It is also the one which is the most suppressed. Since beliefs do not reflect experience or truth5, belief systems also do not support an accurate basal paradigm. It is historically direct knowledge mounded in actual experience which most accurately reflects the true nature of existence. This is one reason, as an example, why Gnosticism has been so viciously suppressed. It is also the reason why the inherent knowingness within people makes literature about aboriginal society and quantum knavingness in such demand today. The personal paradigm of the individual is comprised of what is perceived to be the paradigm most comfortably supporting the individual perception of existence. It is no secret that individuals can be coerced into accepting a group paradigm as reflecting their personal paradigm, especially when the social paradigm supports abnormal psychologrcal, mental and physiological states of being or beingness, leading to subversion of healthy \"tribal\" customs and associations that make up a truly well-balanced society. The profbsion of gang activity in society is a reflection of this subversion, yet the 4 An example of \"elitism\" in nature is the leader of a wolf pack. Elitism in nature concerns leadership for the betterment of the group. Elitism in human society concerns suppression of a nonelite for the benefit of the fav, usually referred to as an oligarchy. First of all, a belief is convincing yourself of something you have yet to know and understand through experience. In befiez one places attitudes and trust in something which has not founded itself in truth within your being. If something is actually within experience, it does not require belief Belief causes a person to be vulnerable and subject to manipulation. Whatever a person believes, he or she will convince themselves that it is true, especially in order to avoid experience. If someone asks you if you believe something, are they not asking your support for their beliel, otherwise they would not argue with you if you reply in the negative. Secondly, most people do not understand the relationship between experience, wisdom and wth. Experience happens in polarity. If one owns the experience, then wisdom (which does not have a polarity) is acquired on a deeper level. The combined experiential wisdom becomes embodied as personal truth. All the personal truths of all conscious beings in the universe is Truth, which is also functionally synonymous with the overall expression of the Universal Intelligent Matrix underlying all realities - also synonymous with what is anthropomorphically referred to as \"the Creator\" of which all conscious entities are a part. Since one can only know something by becoming it, this explains the social replacement of experience with the preference for belief systems, and the suppression of Gnosticism, or processes of direct knowing, which requires no intercessor."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Basal and Proto-Basal Paradigms of Western Civilization ABORIGINAL I JUDEO-CHRISTIAN MONOTHEISM CENTURY SClENTlSM (, PARADIGM ) - (Transformism) - 1 1 st CENTUR f YNTURY PARADIG? 7 OF QUANTUM PHYSICS 8 (c) 1995 Leading Edge Research 4"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO reason for the subversion is what this discussion is really about. In order to trace the subversion inherent in our society, we must return to the root paradigm and examine the path society has taken through separatist basal paradigms to this point in our existence, with the understanding that the paradigms constitute a progression with merpg boundaries. Aboriginal Consciousness: The Root Paradigm The original root paradigm could be called aboriginal consciousness. It was a state typified by direct knowledge obtained fiom the environment. An example would be the aboriginal knowledge of exactly what specific animal traveled on the unseen side of a hill two weeks ago, and the subsequent verification of that fact upon subsequent examination of the site. The modern concept of remote viewing has its origin within this frame of reference, and the general description of the state has been referred to as void consciousness. Within this fiame of reference, all knowledge is considered to have its origin within the environment by virtue of \"The Great Spirit': who oversaw a basic polaric interplay between the Sky (father) and the Earth (mother), and all things existed within harmonious creation. The First Basal Paradigm: \"The White Horse\" As time went on and civilization grew larger, migration and natural catastrophies created a separationfi.om total hannony with the universe. The fact that natural disasters and warfare began to take place created the idea that some things in the universe were not sacred - the enemy was not sacred. Disasters were thought to have their cause as some tribal transgression, a falling short in the presence of \"The Great Spirit.\" All living things were still included in the Creation, but some living things did not seem to live in a sacred way. There were incongruities in nature. The Second Basal Paradigm: \"The Red Horse\" The second separatist basal paradigm occured in the Greco-Roman period of history, where \"The Great Spirit\"was replaced with plural God Creators who ran a multi- Deistic universe which also included the concept of embodied advanced beings. Where the knowledge of the universe was previously found in the environment, now it found its source in oral tradition, typified by the Homeric epics. Within this fiame of reference, personal advancement was through virtue, and the universe was ruled by \"the Gods\" through divine command and aIIowance. The Third Basal Paradigm: \"The Black Horsen The third separatist basal paradigm was the Judeo-Christian paradigm of monotheism, where the universe was ruled by a patriarchal Father, with the source of all"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO I OLD WORLD ORDER SYSTEM OUTPUT SALVATION A I I PROCESS (CREATION) 4 m - Via T Obedience - PERFECTION + DEGRADATION b \"MORAL (EDEN) \"isobedience - MEMORY I DAMNATION OUTPUT I EGALITARIAN NEW WORLD COOPERATIVE SYSTEM (Proto-2lst Century System Co-opted by Darwinism) INPUT PROCESS (CREATION) I as \"Sublime Author\" NATURE I IB&@) I+ I PURWSEFUL EVOLUTION \"BOOK OF NATURE\" - Divine Order) - (c) 1995 Leadmg Edge Research"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO knowledge as the Torah or Bible. Within this fiame of reference, humans were seen as disobedient exiles subject to divine command. The concept and idea of satanic opposition also arose within this paradigm in order to give organized religious movements a justification for all sanctioned activities. It was the period of theocratic monarchism which still exists today, albeit in a much reduced form. The result of this paradigm was that man lived in a 'fallen world and had to undergo \" moral struggle\" in order to obtain 'tedemption\" by virtue of \"the one God who was the Creator. Species in nature existed because of 'thine will.\" The third basal paradigm was a reaction to the second paradigm of multiple gods within the Greco-Roman paradigm. The First Proto-2lst Century Paradigm (Co-opted by Materialism) The personages of Newton and Descartes manifest themselves and a mind-body split occurs. Truth through science becomes the operant paradigm. 'Evolution\" as a concept is introduced, fbrther implying the concept of 'human evolution.\" Jean Baptiste Lamarck arrives at the first theory of biological evolution, called 'transformism\", which ended up being displaced because of its support of egalitarian republianism, which rendered 'Church and King\", the old order, obsolete. Transformism is condemned as being anthropomorphic by the new Church of Scientism, science as a religion, as not being in accordance with materialistic orthodoxy. Had it been allowed to manifest, transformism would have accelerated the expression of egalitarianism planetwide. It is suppressed in the 20th century primarily through the work of the German August Weismann., considered to be the 'father of neo-Darwinism\", who succeeds in convincing his peers that the proof of Darwinism could not be found in the visible world but only in the microscopic world. This leads to the concept of the primacy of DNA and genetics as the 20th century progresses. The Fourth Basal Paradigm: \"The Pale Horse\" The fourth basal paradigm characterizes the 20th century - an era of materialism where science essentially becomes a religion, dependent on adherance to a single interpretation of reality (reductionism) based on Darwinism and Malthusian patterns of thought with respect to biology, medicine and society. The period is marked by the rise of Malthus, Hobbes, Darwin, Wallace and B.F. Skinner. Nature is viewed as \"unplanned and dangerous.\" The Creator is viewed as separate fiom humans. The neo-Darwinistic primacy of DNA and genetics is paramount, characterizing an extention of eugenic concepts developed earlier in the paradigm. Sociologically, the theocratic monotheism of the third basal paradigm is replaced by technocratic totalitarianism, with control over genetics and thought as a political agenrta, using biochemical and electronic control over the human mind and behavior to achieve political en&. Malthusian thought patterns propagandize the notions that populations are out of control, planetary resources are limited, and that the planet must be managed by a technocratic elite. Political thought patterns manifest in various forms of socialism (national socialism in Germany, international socialism in Marxist Communist Russia, and global socialism using the face of international corporate capitalism,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO INPUT NATURAL SELECTION ---+ (Variability) REACTIONARY NEW WORLD ORDER SYSTEM Based on Darwin-Malthus Paradigm OUTPUT PROCESS (CREATION) 1 Via Obedience Via Disobedience + Darwinism Biology + LOSING Social Darwinism OUTPUT WINNING UPCOMING NEW WORLD COMMUNITY ITRUE SCIENCE I A v - MEMORY 4 (Holographic Nature (c) 1995 Leading Edge Researc"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO headquartered in the United States) and democracy (see the 1928 original definition on the illustration page), combined with a push toward high technology, leading to technocratic totalitarianism with the intention that \"national security\" should be replaced with \"global security\". Society functions chiefly through coercion and intimidation, with media propaganda emphasizing ego defense mechanisms and orientation toward the elements of security, sensation and power. Allopathic medicine functions as a co-factor supporting Malthusian principles of indirect killing and genocide, while yielding high financial profits. Contemporary Western civilization may be said to begin in 1859 with the publication of the Origm. This book and its sequel, The Descent of Man became the Gospel of Science--science's equivalent of the New Testament. Darwinism became, in other words, encoded in the new, emerging basal paradigm. Darwinism is lacking in scientific merit, as we know. Thus the Darwinization of the paradigm resulted inevitably in a splitting of the realm of science. Scientists who honored the tradition of \"hypotheses non fingo\" (no hypotheses without proof) continued the usehl work of \"pure science.\" Scientists willing to put their hearts, minds and mouths in the service of unprovable doctrines formed the priesthood of the new religion of science . . . Scientim. Scientism is today the West's current dominant religion. At the heart of it is a number of doctrines (the equivalents of church canons) stemming fiom the original Darwinism, from Social Darwinism (the evangelical application of Darwinism to social theory), and from our current orthodoxy, \"Neo-Darwinism.\" Geneticists as the New Priesthood With the full emergence of the new paradigm, Materialistic Scientism, the honor once accorded to the priests was t.ransferred to the scientists. Most celebrated among the scientists today are the geneticists. The \"genetic engineers\" are the priests, the exorcists, of our time. Today, virtually all \"dyshnctional behavior\" and all disease is viewed as having a genetic origin. How do we fix behavioral disorders? How do we fix diseases? We summon the genetic engineers. We fmd and correct the genetic defects that are the source of the problem. The 2nd Proto-2lst Century Paradigm (In Progress) Toward the latter half of the fourth basal paradigm, new concepts begin to emerge by virtue of the discoveries of quantum physics, through the work of David Bohm, Bentov and others. Instead of the fourth basal paradigm emphasis on knowledge through genetics, the 2nd Proto-2lst century paradigm stresses knowledge as coming fiom within the implicate order. Other areas in science bring equivalent concepts, with the work of Rupert Sheldrake and the morphogenetic field, as well as the work of Pribram. Creation begins to be seen as a \"learning laboratory\". Instead of the Primacy of DNA, the new stress is on the Primacy of cellular dynamic medicine."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO IT'S YOUR CHOICE ...

Sir Isaac Newton (1 642- 1 727). \"Hypothesis non fingoy'--\"I don't make hypotheses.\" Newtonian physics and scientific methodology are strictly materialistic. Newton split the world of thought into metaphysical (which he defined religion) and physical (the realm of science). Su~~ressed: Scientific organicism. Rene Descartes (1 596-1650), \" Cartesian philosophy,\" maintained that all knowledge was hndamentally subjective, dependent upon a primary filter called 'thinking.\" From the point of view of Descartes, all we can be sure of is the fact that we think. This yielded the famous quotation \"Cognito, ergo sum9'--\" I think, therefore I am.\" Descartes view of the world as a machine was a precursor to the modem view of the world as an organism. Hobbes, Thomas (English philosopher, 1588- 1679). Wrote the work Leviathan, which introduced the concept that the state must be a great intimidating force. This stance was subsequently referred to as leviathanism. Hobbes viewpoint supported absolute monarchism, and held that \" the state of Nature is constant war, each against all.\" Hobbes believed that government must be granted absolute authority as \" peacekeeper': and that government arises by the agreement of individuals who believe they need a peacekeeper. For Hobbes, neither morality or law exist before they are 'Wed into being\" by a sovereign monarch who represented, in a way, 'Societies designated driver.\" In his most famous work, Leviathan, Hobbes argued that religion should be reduced to a Yepartment of state.\" Hobbes was condemned by Parliament in 1666 as a \" minion of the Beast,\" and was not permitted thereafter to publish anything on subjects relating to human conduct. The term \" Hobbism\" or \" Hobbesian\" became the popular synonym for the concepts of irreligion and immorality. \" Levianthanism\" became a political reality in the 20th century with the emergence of state socialism, the modem monolithic state. [For a contemporary restatement of Hobbism, see Crime and the Sacking of America-fie Roots of Chaos, by Andrew Peyton Thomas (Washington, D.C.1 London: Brassey's, 19941 In his Questions Concerning Liberty, Necessity, and Chance (1656), Hobbes elaborated a theory of psychological determinism. His writings provoked immediate opposition. Hobbes considered philosophy a practical study of two kinds of bodies: natural and civil. The latter, \"made by the wills and agreement of men,\" he called \"the Commonwealth.\" He declared that natural bodies include everything for which there is rational knowledge of causal processes. Hobbes took a mechanistic view, explaining things in terms of the movement of bodies through space. He also considered human thought as an action of bodies. Since everyone is subject to physical and mathematical laws that allow no exceptions, one's apparent freedom is simplv the absence of external constraint.

Once that happens, the monarch's decrees are absolute in all areas of life, including the family and religion. Hobbes concluded that rebellion against the state breaks society's basic contract (social contract) and is punishable by whatever penalty the monarch may exact in order to protect his subjects from a return to the original state of nature. The ideas of Thomas Hobbes were challenged by both the parliamentarians and churchmen of his day; some considered trying him for heresy. Hobbes, after experiencing the ruinous English Civil War (1642-48), took the doctrines of internal and external state sovereignty to their limits. The Hobbesian sovereign (what he called the \"Leviathan\"), who absorbed by virtue of the social contract all the natural rights of his subjects save self- defense, was an absolute lawgiver in the strictest sense. For Hobbes neither moralitv nor anv kind of law exists before it is willed bv a sovereian to whom subjects are obliaated bv - a contract of obedience. The Hobbesian sovereign, then, is the creator not only of positive law but of standards of right and wrong, of a civil religious doctrine, and even in part of public opinion. Moreover, if, as Hobbes asserted, the state creates moralitv and law and humans must submit to it _for their selfi~reservation, then all iustice will exist onlv within closed sin~le-state qstems. and the relations between those states, existina - in a moral and legal void. will be like the relations between humans before the social contract. The very creation of a supreme state, then, implies the possibility of its hostility to other similar states if medieval natural law and the Roman ius gentium are discarded. For Hobbesians, the doctrine of internal sovereignty, which places states in a \"state of nature\" while it puts humans under true (positive) law, gives rise by logical necessity to external sovereignty. States, then, being perfectly independent, can be bound only through their own wills, that is, in the same way that individuals are bound to a particular state, through contract or treaty. From Hobbes stem modem ideas of international relations. Malthus, Rev. Thomas R (1 766- 1 834). Malthusianism. Economist, pessimist, educator and one of thefirst \"intelligence analysts, \" Maithus published his most influential work, An Essay on the Principle of Population, in 1798. The \" principle9'in question is the idea that \" human populations tend to increase at a geometrical rate, whereas the means of subsistence (food) grows at only an arithmetic rate.\" Malthus argued that the standard of living of the masses cannot be improved because \"The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man.\" Population, he asserted, when unchecked by war, famine, or disease, would increase by a geometric ratio but subsistence only by an arithmetic one. Malthus' theory has no factual scientific basis, but hnctions as a substrate that is propagated worldwide through ~olicies based on a belief in Social Darwinism. Nevertheless, it was adopted as a thought pattern and became a prevailing conviction among members of the ruling classes in the 19th century, and was included by Charles Darwin as a key component of his evolutionary theory. In 1803, after his work was criticized by William Godwin as reductionistic (viewing all from only one perspective), Malthus published a revised edition of his work, in which he added \"moral restraintw--late marriage and abstinence--as a factor that might limit population growth, and he provided 'tmpirical evidence\" to back up his theories. In the middle of the 19th century neo-Malthusianism emerged, a movement that, partly influenced by Robert Owen, advocated birth control for the poor."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The appearance of Dr. George Drysdale's Elements of Social Science in 1854, and the founding of the Malthusian League in 1877, laid the foundation of the movement. In Britain and continental Europe, Malthusian leagues were formed, and the Dutch league opened the first birth control clinic in 188 1. An English clinic was started by Dr. Marie Stopes (1 882-1958) in 1921. In the United States, Margaret Sanger's first clinic (1916) was closed by the police, but Sanger opened another in 1923. Her National Birth Control League, founded in 1915, became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942 and then, in 1963, the Planned Parenthood-World Population organization. Many of the 'less developed countries\" are 'bncouraged to promote birth control programs, often tied to 'technical': 'BducationaI': and financial assistance fiom various United Nations agencies and the International Planned Parenthood Federation. A series of World Po~ulation Conferences has sought to strengthen the focus on population control as a major international issue. The\" Malthusian League\" institutionalized what had been a \"behind closed doors\" commitment of European rulers--to implement the Malthusian mandate to \"increase the mortalig rate of the poor.\" The concepts fostered by Malthus are used by worldwide self-declared elitists to justifL suppression, manipulation and reduction of populations through pre-conceived warfare and biochemical influence, according to pre-arranged mandates. It is all based on false scientism. Malthus argued that the human population, density must eventually outstrip its food supply and thus be held in check by starvation or by warfare or disease that food shortages might cause. In his second edition he allowed the possibiity of natural restraint- -that is, some form of birth control. Charles Darwin read Malthus and 'iealized\" that the same truth held for all biological populations and that their densities should be held in check by limited resources, disease or predation, or fighting. He reasoned that individuals with the best traits to face these pressures would leave behind the greatest number of descendants, thus causing the gradual evolution of the population and the species. Since the tie of Malthus, however, the human food-supply has also been growing at an exponential rate, mainly through the application of technology. Moreover, as demonstrated by A. M. Carr-Saunders in his 7he Population Problem: A Study in Human Evolution (1922), all primitive human groups practiced population restraint, which sometimes went as far as infanticide, and were thereby able to hold their densities at an optimal level relative to their food supply. the influential German social theorist Karl Marx insisted that each society has its own law of population growth. Another factor is that there is plenty of capability to produce food on the planet, but that the distrubution of resources is manipulated to intentionally cause planetary problems. \"Malthusian\" is synonymous with governmental policies of \"malign neglect ''of the masses, and frequently appears in public policy under the politically correct phrase 'laissez faire.\" In 1805, Malthus was appointed to the chair of political economy (the only one existing at the time) at Haileybury, the college of the East India Company (well known for drug trafficking), where fbture officials of the Company were trained before assuming duties in India and elsewhere. The East India Company, especially because of its trafficking in opium, was in many ways an economic imperialistic extension of the Crown. Under a charter by James I, it was empowered to seize and confiscate ships and goods of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO other traders of any nationality. Piracy. The Company insured the subjugation of India, and maintained control there until 1857, when it failed to quell the Sepoy Rebellion. Subsequently, the Crown assumed the rule of India, whether the people wished it or not (totalitarian monarchism). The service of Malthus to the East India Company and Crown would be describable in today's terminology as 'Intelligence analysis.\" Malthus' expertise was in population and population trends. In 1808, for instance, he wrote about 'the extraordinary growth of the Irish population\" [which the Crown despised because it feared the growing Irish population as a threat to British dominance] in these terms: \"Among the subjects peculiar to the state of Ireland, which have been comparatively but little noticed, is the extraordinary phenomenon of the very rapid increase in population. The causes of the rapid increase, among a people groaning under a penal code [British] of singular severity, and oppressed [by the British], in a manner which history does not fUrnish a second example, cannot fail of exciting our astonishment and curiosity. The introduction of the potatoe into Ireland, and it's becoming the general food of the population, seems to have formed this particular case. If the rate continues, Ireland will contain twenty millions of people in the course of the present century, and we need not insist upon the result. With such a physical force, it is quite impossible that it should remain united to Great Britain, without sharing, in every respect, the full benefits of its constitution.\" [Occasional Papers of T. R. Malthus-On Ireland, Poplation, and Political Economy, ed. Bernard Semmel. (New York: Burt Franklin, 1963),p.34] Ireland never got the opportunity for a population increase during the 19th century, because within 40 years of this Malthusian analysis, it was hit by a mysterious potato famine. Tens of thousands starved and died, hundreds of thousands left Ireland, and the population never recovered. [Ed. It is quite interesting that in the 20th century Margaret Thatcher, who has a background in chemistry, spent enormous Crown revenues in order to institute fluoridation programs in Ireland. ,Fluorides have been known for 40 years to affect the brain and stem behavioral resistance to authority.] American Revolution: (1775-1783) The American Revolution, much to the consternation of the British, resulted in the creation of the first egalitarian republic. The main philosophical source was Deism, which acknowledges the existence of an external God but which maintains that the word of God is to be found in Nature, rather than in the Bible. Jefferson, Paine, Franklin and Washington were Deists. Deism is definable, interesting to note, as a 17th and 18th century expression of Gnostic Christianity. Jefferson, and most other Deists, confessed a devotion to the teachings of Christ. However, most did not accept the doctrines of the various Christian churches. Washington went so far as to refbse to take his hat off in church. Further, he denied that the American System was constructed in any sense on the basis of Christianity. French Revolution (1 789- 1804). Like the American Revolution, the French Revolution was inspired by Deistic thought, especially that of Jean Jacques Rousseau. Napoleon once said, 'Without him, the French Revolution would not have occurred.\" Unfortunately, Napoleon was no Washington.

Where Western civilization as whole is concerned, the chief effect of the French Revolution was to terrify monarchs and monarchists. A dire threat to the ruling powers had arisen--the masses, and something had to be done about that. The masses must be controlled Hobbism and Malthusianism became the philosophies of preference. Both were combined with Darwinism. Dominant: Materialistic biology and evolution. Charles Darwin (1 809- 1 882) postulated that the ordering principle in evolution is 'hatural selection,\" or 'Survival of the fittest.\" In the plant and animal worlds, vast number of individuals are produced and 'tieployed into an environment of incessant struggle. Those possessed of advantages of any kind tend to be the 'tvinners.\" The special characteristics of the winners are inherited by the next generation, and so the new generation starts from a higher plane. The concept of natural selection replaces the concept of divine Providence as the ordering principle of existence. The process of natural selection is viewed as strictly mechanical. The environment provides obstacles, and those individuals successful in overcoming the obstacles are designated as \"the fittest.\" SUDD~~SS~~: Organic [holistic] biology and evolution. Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1744- 1829), founder of biology and modem evolutionarys science. Lamarck maintained that biological evolution was a result of interactivity between the individual and the environment, with the individual playing an active role. The principle of order in existence has as much to do with \"individual selection\" as \"natural [environmental] selection.\" Schematic Glossary for Chart #2 Key Figures, Philosophies in the rise of Materialistic Scientism & Church of Scientism Herbert S~encer British Philosopher (1820-1903): The Social Darwinist [i.e., one who applied Darwinian biology and evolutionary theory to social and political institutions] most influential in the United States, Spenser was an exceedingly ambitious self-made materialistic philosopher who endeavored to ue all scientific knowledge, the record of this endeavor being his multi-volumed work, Synthetic Philosophy. Though he took issue with the principle opf Natural Selection [ see The Inadequacy of Natural Selection], he was a champion of Malthusian Darwinism. According to Richard Hofstader, \"His categorical repudiation of state interference with the 'natural,' unimpeded growth of society led him to oppose all state aid to the poor. They were unfit, he said, and should be eliminated.\" Hofstader continues, quoting Spencer, \"The whole effort of nature is to get rid of such, and to make room for better ...

He was elected as president of the Royal Society in 1883. Two years later he retired from public life on account of ill health, but continued to write and publish until the time of his death. The Roval Society: The oldest scientific society in Great Britain and the most famous in the world. The full title of the organization was \"The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge.\" It was incorporated with the sanction of Charles I1 in 1662. Within a year after incorporation, the Society entered into active correspondence on learned questions with philosophers and scientists of France, Germany, Spain and Italy. In 1664, it began publication of Transactions. Within ten vears of incorporation the Society was considered semi-official by the British Povernment. According to the 1927 edition of the World Book Encyclopaedia, 'the society practically controls the British Meteorology Department, the National Physical Laboratory, several scientific trust funds and the governing bodies of many British public schools.\" Sir Isaac Newton was in his time a president of the Royal Society. The fact that the British Empire was able to become so all-pervasive and all-powerful as it was, was due in no small measure to its superior intelligence system, the Royal Society being an important component. British Intelligence per se was established in the reign of Elizabeth I. Social Daminism: Social Darwinism was a late-19th-century sociological theory that was based on the theories of biological evolution and natural selection put forth by biologists Charles Darwin and Alfied Russel Wallace and on social philosopher Herbert Spencer's theory of sociocultural evolution \"survival of the fittest.\" The school originated with the appearance of Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics (1 872) and reached its most radical formulation in the works of the Austrian sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838-1909), notably in his Der Rassenkampf (The Racial Strum, 1883). Bagehot sketched the historical development of social groups into nations by means of intergroup struggles; Gumplowicz formulated a universal law to the effect that all social evolution was a product of group conflict. Social Darwinists argue that societies--like organisms--evolved by a natural process through which the most fit members survived or were most successfbl. The theory went hand-in-hand with political conservatism; the most 'Successful social classes 'here supposedly composed of people who were biologically superior. Social Darwinism was also used to support imperialism--peoples who viewed themselves as culturally superior, being allegedly more fit to rule those that they deemed less advanced. In the United States the foremost publicist of the theory was William Graham Sumner.

The concept embraces all efforts to apply Darwinian biology and evolution to human society. Given the fact that Darwinism rapidly became the orthodox biology and evolutionary science, Social Darwinism underlies virtually all of the social sciences. One key premise is that 'the masses are unprincipled, dangerous to themselves, society and the planet.\" There are basic schools of thought regarding an 'hppropriate\" response to this condition: (1) Laissez faire,--do nothing for the masses except that which will accelerate their self-destruction; and (2) exercise complete control over the masses, and at the same time refne the scientzjic means to \"handle the problem of the masses\" at a fundamental level, e.g., the genetic level. Historically, laissez-faire did not work. The masses proved \"far more cunning\" than the elites supposed. Thus, option (2) became the standardpolicy; in political terms, this option translates into \"state socialism.\" State socialism is not the bright-eyed optimistic socialism of those who invented socialism, the 'htopian scientists\" according to Marx. State socialism is a direct political expression of Social Darwinism. Sir Francis Galton (1822-191 1). A cousin of Darwin's, Galton is the 'rather of eugenics.\" In his acquisition of the doctrine of Natural Selection from Alfied Wallace, Charles Darwin unwittingly stole 'the devil's pitchfork.\" Cousin Francis endeavored to make the 'Pitchfork into a scientific instrument, to breeed better crops of humans by means of scientific techniques. In 1883, Galton coined the word 'kugenics,\" meaning 'good birth,\" to describe his work, and published several books on the subject, including Hereditary Genious-Its Laws and Consequences, Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development, and Natural Inheritance. He distinguished between two types of eugenic processes: Negative eugenics seeks to prevent the multiplication of those considered unfit; and positive eugenics seeks to encourage the multiplication of the fit. Hitler's 'tace purification\" and the 'kthnic cleansing\" in Bosnia are examples of the former. [See Eugenics] On one occasion, Galton expressed the hope that eugenics would become 'the religion of the future\" [Stefan Kuhl, The Nazi Connection-Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), p. 161. Kuhl cites anthropologist Roger Pearson's Race, Intelligence and Bias in Academe (1 99 1) as a comprehesive defense of eugenics,which is defined therein as 'the practical application of genetic science toward the improvement of the genetic health of fbture generations.\" The movement of eugenics was politically and scientifically influential in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in Great Britain, Germany and the United States. The word eugenics was originally taken in 1883 by Galton to mean \"the science of improving the stock.\"In his view, the eugenics movement should aim to give 'the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable.\" Galton was convinced that preeminence in various fields was principally due to hereditary factors. He was thus inclined to opDose those who stressed environmental determination of either intelligence or character; he also advocated breeding restrictions. Interest in the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO role of heredity led Galton to introduce the method of twin studies to examine the different contributions of nature and nurture. He also inquired into racial differences and was one of the first to employ questionnaire and survey methods, which he used to investigate mental imagery in different groups. Francis Galton is often often regarded as the father of mental testing and differential psychology. History shows that Galton's theories were later promulgated through the policies of Camegie who, with the Rockefeller cartel, took over educational testing in the United States and creation of teacher colleges to staff universities and colleges with personnel who would promote Prussian educational motifs. Galton was the key personage where the application of Darwinian doctrine of 'hatural selection\" to society is concerned. Galton is considered the \"father\" of \"scientific selection.\" Ernst Haeckel (1 834- 191 9): Regarded as the greatest German biologist of the latter half of the 19th century, Haeckel was the 'Yudas goat\" responsible for leading the German scientific community into acceptance of Darwinism. The following appears in Darwin's Autobiography: \"Dr. E. Krause has given a good account of Professor Haeckel's services in the cause of Evolution. After speaking of the lukewarm reception which the Origin met with in Germany on its first publication, he goes on to describe the first adherents of the new faith [sic] as more or less popular writers, not especially likely to advance its acceptance with the professional or purely scientific world. And, he claims for Haeckel that it was his advocacy of Evolution in his Radiolaria (1862), and at the 'Versammlung' of Naturalists ar Stettin in 1863, that placed the Darwinian question for the first time publicly before the forum of German science, and his enthusiastic propagandaism that chiefly contributed to its success.\" [pp. 277-781 Su~~ressed: Symbiotic Evolution, i.e., evolution through the establishment of cooperative [rather than competitive] relationships among organisms. See discussion in the main narrative of Petr 'Prince\" Kropotkin's Mutual Aid-A Factor of Evolution. In the 1880's and 1890's, Kropotkin published a number of excellent papers challenging the Hobbesian Darwinism of Huxley et al. Kropotkin was ignored. Karl Marx (1 8 18-1 883): A German social theorist, Marx has the unenviable title of the \"Father of Communism.\" Manrist Communism is a form of state socialism premised on the hypothesis (HobbesiadDarwinian) that historical process is essentially a matter of class struggle. The struggle ends, Mm supposed, when the working class (proletariat) becomes the ruling class. According to Brackman: 'Marx, living in obscurity in mid- Victorian London, was aware of the Linnean Society's extraordinary meeting and its explosive aftermath. Marx attended Huxley's lectures on the Wallace-Darwin theory of evolution and, a fiiend of Marx later recalled, 'spoke of nothing else for months.' For that matter, Marx wrote Freidrich Engels, his collaborator, that the new theory provided a basis in natural history for class struggle.\" [A Delicate Arrangement, p. 2741 With the aid of Friedrich Engels he produced much of the theory of modem Socialism and its derivative, Communism. Marx's father, Heinrich, was a Jewish lawyer who had converted his family to Christianity partly in order to preserve his job in the Prussian state."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Karl himself was baptized in the Evangelical church. As a student at the University of Berlin, young Manc was strongly influenced by the philosophy of G. W. F. Hegel and by a radical group called Young Hegelians, who attempted to apply Hegelian ideas to the movement against organized religion and the Prussian autocracy. In 1845, Marx jotted down some notes, Theses on Feuerbach, which he and Engels enlarged into a book, The German Ideology (1932; Eng. trans., 1938), in which they developed their materialistic conception of history. They argued that human thouaht was determined social and economic forces, particularlv those related to the means of production. They developed a method of analysis they called Dialectical Materialism, in which 'the class struggle\" leads to changes in society. In the cases of the Soviet Union and Red China, Communism was translated quickly into technocratic totalitarianism, the technocrats being members of the \"scientific\" Communist Party. Su~uressed: Idealistic socialism (all forms). The term \"socialism\" was first used in England in 1833 with reference to an organization called the 'Association of All Classes of All Nations.\" The first socialist party (Social Democrats) appeared in Germany in 1863 with a very simple program--a \"democracv,\" which means literally 'hle of the people\" [as opposed to rule by aristocracy or capitalistic oligarchy, the current U.S. system]. Socialisms of all kinds are based on the Hobbesian premise of struggle, the State of Nature as a constant struggle, and the only solution being the handing over of allpower to a Government that will \"own\" and manage the means of production. In other words, socialism is simply a latter dav version of monarchism, with the difference that the sovereimtv is vested in the State rather than in the monarch. Idealistic socialism theorizes that the creation of the said State can be accomplished without violence (i.e., cooperatively); Mamian (materialistic) socialism ridicules idealistic socialism as \"utopian,\" and regards violence as a necessary means of political evolution. Like Dawinism, Marxism emerged as 'the orthodoxy\" in its field-political science. In the process, idealistic socialism was suppressed, along with anarchism [which means opposition to hierarchical orders, ~t opposition to order], and various European versions of egalitarian republicanism. At the present time, the & economic system in Europe worth imitating is egalitarian rather than socialistic. This is the so-called \"Mondragon\" system developed in the Basque region of Spain. The system is comprised of over 500 producer-owned cooperatives, one of them being a bank. (19th century British socialists Beatrice and Sidney Webb declared that 'producer co-ops could never work,\" and that idiotic view became socialist doctrine in the 20th century.

The North maintained that the Union was indissoluble, even though President Lincoln acknowledged the right of revolution: \"This country, with it's institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary right to dismember it and overthrow it.\" The South maintained, on the basis of the doctrine of \"States Rights,\" that the Union was very dissoluble, being no more than a combination of independent commonwealths. The disagreement between North and South was complicated greated by the issue of slavery, a ghastly influence fiom the British Empire. From the point of view of \"founding philosophy\" (Deism, etc.), the North had the progressive position, but at the same time, the position of the South had validity. The existence of slavery was a prima facie violation of egalitarian republicanism, as it was a basis of a class system in a country that had outlawed classes. To avoid confronting the issue, the South defined the blacks as \"property,\" rather than as human beings. Nevertheless, the political position of the south had merit, as the republic was in fact shifting fiom its original egalitarian basis to an oligarchical (elitist) basis. The South was on the way to becoming the economic slave of the North. All questions of \"karmic justice\" aside, the South was correct in its insistence that an agreement of political union is conditional upon the continuing agreement of the parties involved. Agreements made by one generation are not written in stone for all subsequent generations to follow. Thomas Paine, in ?&e Rights of Mm, had been most convincing on the issue. In this connection, the example of Jefferson is most interesting. Jefferson always down-played the importance of the federal government; in summarizing his life, for instance, he indicated that his most important contribution to humankind was his founding of the University of Virginia. In any event, the chief result of the Civil War was that the United States shzfted from its egalitarian basis, and fell more into the hands of the oligarchs. The current self- image of the United States as \"Great World Power\" would be regarded bv the Founders as an aping of the old British Empire. The egalitarian spirit is very favorable to the growth of true science [many of the Founders were inventors as well as law makers]. We will never know how many brilliant young scientists were killed at Shiloh, Vicksburg and Gettysburg. Perhaps one who could have offered a successfid rebuttal of Darwinism.

He was a scholar as well as an adminstrator, and among the books he wrote is one called Constitutional Government in the United States. For all his erudition, Wilson failed to grasp the essential feature of the American System-that sovereipnv is vested in the people. An elitist by nature and background, Wilson believed that sovereignty belongs 'h the hands of the experts,\" and he was of course encouraged in this belief by Colonel House (who is also discussed in this narrative), who became, curiously, a kind of father figure to Wilson. Wilson's paternalism (elitism) was a weakness, the Achilles' heel that gave House and others an opportunity to manipulate him. In Europe, Wilson is remembered as founder of the League of Nations. The United States Senate, objecting to participation in the League of Nations on the grounak that it involved a surrender of national sovereignty, rehsed to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, which established the League as part of the overall peace plan--a plan which also levied penalties against Germany many felt were unwarranted. A separate peace was made with Germany in 1921. In an effort to build popular support for the League of Nations, Wilson undertook a strenuous national speaking tour. He collapsed midway in the tour, and never recovered. From the time of Wilson's collapse (1919) to the end of the administration (1921), the country was in the capable hands of Edith Wilson, the president's wife. The War of the Nations World War Q: In terms of the prevailing social theory (Social Darwinism), the First World War was a grand test of firness and an important regulator of populations (Malthus). Even the least involved of the nations, the United States, had 25% of its male popualtion between 18 and 3 1 in uniform by the time of the armistice. From the point of view of Colonel House and associates (global socialists), the war was ')xoof unto the world\" that nations, like individuals, are unprincipled, dark and dangerous, and that a mechanism of 'International governance7' is 'kequired\" in order to 'btain world peace.\" Of course, wars and conflicts are contrived in order to provide \"proof\" of this definition of society to society. The global socialists achieved what they set out to achieve--the League of Nations, a mechanism \"international governance,\" which was the precusor to the 'United Nations.\" It must be remembered always that the character of an institution is a reflection of the paradigmh) on which it is based A 'United Nations\" based on materialistic scientism is one thing (a world police organization); a 'United Nations\" based on the emerging. paradigm (scientific holism) would be a very diierent organization, something more on the order of a grand cultural and technological exchange forum, and a mechanism for rebuilding beautzjid cultures (such as the Cambodian or Tibetan culture) that were largely destroyed in our era. The Great De~ression (1929-1941): The Great Depression was economic war. The aggressors were the global socialists, who controlled key economic institutions (such as the Federal Reserve), and the targets were any and all powefil people and enterprises that stood in opposition (or potential opposition) to the program of global socialism.

The main achievement of the Second World War was (from the point of view of the globalists) the discrediting and destruction of national socialism. Nazi Germany was financially supported by elements in the United States, as history records, in order to create an extreme form of national socialism, which would 'tiemonstrate\" to all the world that \" a national socialistic elite\" cannot be trusted. National Socialism is a monster. (Similarly, the 'Cold War\" concluded with the appearance of the 'breaking apart\" of an extreme of international socialism in the guise of the Sovet Union. All that is left is global socialism). 'The Svnthesis\" (1947): At a conference held at the school where Woodrow Wilson was once president, Princeton University, biologists from various nations arrived at a consensus that the ofJicia1 evolutionary theory of the West would be the mthesis of classical Darwinism and modem genetics--'Nee-Darwinism.\" In the words of Niles Eldredge: \" The Society for the Study of Evolution was founded in 1946. A milestone conference was held at Princeton in 1947, during which geneticists, paleontologists, systematists, and other biologists got together and agreed, in effect, that the Neo- Darwinian paradigm was both necessary and, in the main, mfJicient to explain evolution ...\" [Reinventing Darwin, p.281 It was not a 'inilestone\" conference, but a \"millstone\" conference; the millstone of Neo-Darwinism was hung around the neck of all those who had survived the 'tlrowning in blood that followed the triumph of classical Darwinism. The smoke of battle had hardly cleared, the upper air currents were still laden with the radioactive dust composed of the remains of the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . . . and the \"elite of biology\" confirmed as both necessary and correct the great principles that had put the world to war, the doctines of Hobbes, Malthus and Darwin.

It goes without saying that they can be as influential in the dismantling of Darwinism as they were in its establishment). Asa Gray (1 8 10-1 880): The foremost American botanist of the late 19th century, Gray became Darwin's leading disciple in the United States. In 1842, he accepted a life appointment at Harvard, and from that post preached 'Darwinia\" to the world. For many years, Gray's botany textbooks were not only the standard books in American high schools, they were the only botany texts used at that pre-college level. Gray, a close friend of Darwin's, was implicated (unwittingly) in the alleged Darwin-Lyell-Hooker conspiracy. Ernst Mavr (b.1904): A Gexman-born American biologist steeped in the traditions of continental biology, Mayr held the Louis Agassiz chair at Harvard for a very long time. He continued the tradition of Asa Gray, becoming America's 'tiean of Neo-Darwinism.\" He has been retired for some years, but is still active as a writer, promoting the \"gospel\" of 'hatural selection.\" Mayr is best known for his work in the pseudo-sciences of classification, population genetics (consequences of heredity on a population), and evolution. His major works include Evolution and the Diversity of Life (1976), Populations, Species and Evolution (1970), and Taward a Nav Philosophy of Biology (1988). B.F. Skinner (1904-1990) Skinner originated Skinner was the developer of the chief mode of 'psychology\" taught in American colleges and universities in the 1970's and 1980's--Skimerim behaviorism, which reiects the view that human beings are fiee agents. He argues that all people are controlled, and it is merely a question of who is to do the controlling. Skinner believed that scientists were better qualzjied to exercise this control than were the agents of business, politics, and religion. From the behaviorist viewpoint, it is irresponsible not to try to control human behavior through science and education. It is a major substrate of thought in the United States. Skinner adopted the radical view that \"mind\" is mythical. Unlike the methodologists he included consciousness in psychology, because conscious events are observed, but he rejected reference to nonconscious \"mental\" states. For Skinner, behavior was controlled bv the environment fincludin~ the ~rivate environment of consciousness). not @v internal forces. Skinner and the philosopher Gilbert Ryle rebelled against the idea of an intractably private inner sense and its equally private objects, and thev denied the verv existence of consciousness in the stronp sense vromulzated bv Lock Descartes. and the introspective vsvcholoaists.

After eugenics (namewise) was 'tliscredited as a result of the Nazi \" race purification\" programs (when it then went underground disguised in other forms), Scientism required a new 'hcademic base of operations\" for its continuing interest in the development of people and population control technology.

The new academic base of operations was provided by Skinner"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO when at Harvard through his two major works, Walden Two and Beyond Freedom and Dignity. Skinner classified 'Inherited ideas\" of individual freedom and dignity as 'Self- serving mythology that is no longer affordable on a planet facing exhaustion of resources,\" a theory which has no basis in fact. Mismanagement of planetary resources is a characteristic of socialist political Jystems. What is required, according to Skinner, is a \"technology of behavior,\" a scientific means of controlling the fbndarnental determiners of life--genetics and culture. Skinner believed that the bre of the species was dependent on manipulation of genetics. The factors of mutual aid, cooperation and the evolution of consciousness never entered his mind. Skinner's main contribution to the Church of Scientism was his contribution of a pseudo-philosophical basis for the Church's latest 'Salvational program,\" Neo-eugenics, i.e., 'Save the human species through genetic engineering and through mind control programs. William Graham Sumner (1 840-1 91 0): Surnner advocated the concept of 'Survival of the fittest\" in society. Hofstader summarizes Sumner in these terms: \"The most vigorous and influential social Darwinist in America ... Sumner not only made a striking adaptation of evolution to conservative thought, but also effectively propogated his philosophy through widely read books and articles, and converted his strategic teaching post in New Haven (Yale University) into a kind of social Darwinian pulpit. He provided his age with a synthesis which, though not quite as grand as Spencer's, was bolder in its stark and candid pessimism. Sumner's synthesis brought together three 'beat\" traditions of Western capitalist culture: the Protestant ethic, the doctrines of classical economics, and Darwinian \"natural selection.\" Correspondingly, in the development of American thought, Sumner played three roles: he was a great Puritan teacher, an exponent of the classical pessimism of Ricardo and Malthus, and an assimilator and popularizer of evolution.. .\" [Social Darwinism and American Thought, p.5 11 During the Civil War, wealthy fiiends (William and Henry Whitney) secured a substitute to fill in Sumner's place in the Union Army, and provided Sumner with the fbnds to study theology in Geneva, Gottingen and Oxford. In 1872, Sumner was elevated to the post of Professor of Political and Social Science at Yale College, where he developed a wider following than any other teacher in the history of Yale [p.53]. Sumner derived the major premises of his social philosophy fsom Herbert Spencer. Like Darwin, he went to Malthus for the first principles of his system. In all, Sumner [and later Yale Univerisity] played a key role in the synthesis of traditional religion and Scientism. Currently, Yale in an important center for genetics and genetic engineering. The Council on Foreim Relations: Established on July 29, 1921 in New York City, the CFR was founded by a group feeling the need for a 'borld government\" (global socialism). The founders included Colonel Edward House, Walter Lippmann, John Foster Dulles, and Allen Dulles (who would later become director of the CIA). Money for the founding of the CFR originated fiom the houses of Morgan and Rockefeller, Bernard Baruch, Paul Warburg, Otto Kahn, Jacob SchifT and others.

Edward Mandell \"Colonel\" House (1858-1938): Colonel House was a Texas plutocrat who blue~rinted the conversion of the American Svstem to state socialism. He was the 'kingmaker\" behind Woodrow Wilson, and for many years Wilson's chief advisor. House was one of the most influential men in 20th century American history, and one of the most shadowy. At the prompting of House, a direct line was established between the White House (and the Colonel House) and British Intelligence, in the person of Sir William Wiseman (1885-1962), and this connection became the precursor of the OSS and the CIA. Via this line, the British worked successfblly to influence the United States to enter the First World War. A group of 'kxperts7'put together by House and called 'The Inquiry,\" a precursor of the Council on Foreign Relations, accompanied Wilson to the peace conference at Versailles. Colonel House also played a key role in the development and passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which resulted in the transfer of control of the money system (a public resource under the Constitution) to private banks. Supposedly, the Federal Reserve System was established 'to stabilize the economy'kn economy that in fact had been deliberately de-stabilized by those wishing to institute the Federal Reserve System. Fifteen years after it was established, those in control deliberately precipitated the collapse of the American economy in order to present an \"I told you so\" picture to the American public. This triggered a worldwide economic depression. Currently, the people of the United States owe the consortium over $4 trillion. When the Federal Reserve System was established, the United States had no debt. Lack of understanding of these basic principles is how the American people can be drawn into discussions about 'balancing the budget\", when it fact all it would take to totally elite the national debt to the Federal Reserve would be to renationdue the Federal Reserve System under United States control. In his final years, Wilson repudiated House and regretted the passage of the Federal Reserve Act. Wilson had killed that which he loved the most, the American Republic, and that lcnowledge no doubt added to the great emotional agony President Wilson endured in his last years.

Another key individual was Alfred Ploetz, Social Darwinist and founder (1904) of the German Society for Racial Hygiene. Ploetz looked to Galton as his scientific mentor. \"Blood and Iron\" Militarism: Not until 1860's were the German states unified into Germany, by Karl Otto Eduard Leopold Bismark-Schonhausen, usually referred to simply as \"Bismark,\" (1 8 15-1 898). Bismark set the tone of the new German empire in 1862, when he said, \"Not by speeches and resolutions of majorities are the mighty problems of the age to be solved, but by blood and iron.\" The \"Iron Chancellor\" originated these measures for the working classes; it was the foundation for state socialism. His methodology is sometimes referred to as \"paternalism.\" The Germany military at the turn of the century, educated in the \"school of Blood and Iron,\" took to Social Darwinism like tanks to battle (an appropriate parallel to \"ducks to water.\") One key military opinion leader in early 20th century Germany was retired General Bernhardi, who is quoted in chapter three: \"If it were not for war, we should probably find that inferior and degenerate races would overcome healthy and youthful ones of their wealth and their numbers.\" The generative importance of war lies in this, that it causes selection, and thus war becomes a biologrcal necessity. Combines race science with Bismarkian militaristic paternalism, and we have the formula for the Third Reich, personified in Adolph Hitler. German-American Eu~enics Liaison (1 9 19- 193 9): Under the highly punitive terms of the Versailles Treaty, Germany was physically contracted and stripped of her colonies. In Social Damhistic terms, this contraction was not simply a punishment, it was a death sentence. Any country [that subscribed to Malthusian beliefs] that did not \"have room to dump its surplus population,\" would perish. Blocked in terms of discharging its \"surplus population\" into colonies, Germany was compelled to find an internal solution to the \"population problem.\" It was no alleviation that vast numbers had perished in the First World War. The blood of the noblest had been shed, it was believed, and \"the blood of the degenerates\" now threatened to inundate Germany. Race scientists found in America the model they were looking for--the precedent of sterilization and other means of control of \"undesirable population\" on a significant scale. In 1923, Fritz Lenz, a German physician-geneticist who became a leading ideologue in the Nazi race purification programs, complained bitterly that Germany, under the Weimar Constitution (which prohibited the infliction of bodily alterations on humans), prevented widespread use of vasectomy techniques, and that Germany had nothing to match the eugenics research institutions in England and the United States. During the 1920's and 1930's, there was a significant flow of eugenics information from the United States to Germany, which was later used by Hitler to provide his genocidal programs with the appearance of scientific legitimacy.

During the period of Hitler, the Kaiser Wilhelm Society (KWG), Germany's most prestigious scientific institution, focused a great deal of its attention on eugenics. The KWG operated between 19 1 1 and 1945. If Hitler had won, it would now be the \"Vatican\" of Scientism. See Science, Technology and National Socialism, by Monika Renneburg and Mark Walker (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993). Note especially an essay by Herbert Mehrten (\"Irresponsible Purity,\" etc.), which makes the very important point that \"pure science\" is no valid justification for participation in scientrfic work involved in destructive or questionable politicalprograms. \"Pure science\" is then defined as irresponsible. The Nuremburg Trials: As showcase for the display of righteous indignation, the Nuremburg trials were very effective. As a means for determining the causes behind the horror perpetrated by the Third Reich, the trials were an abject failure. A few notorius leaders of the Third Reich were condemned and disposed of. Most of the scientists associated with the Reich were quickly assimilated into the scienrific and intelligence establishments of the Allies. The scientific vision underlying the Third Reich--Social Darwinism--was of course never brought to trial. A few fanatical puppets of the pdgm were slain.

In 1861, he abolished serfdom throughout the Empire, setting fiee more than 20 million men. Further, Alexander also provided a state system of loans whereby fieed men were able to purchase small fanns. The Russian Revolution (1 905- 19 17): Typically, the Russian czars were paternalistic, and intransigent when faced with opposition. Revolt broke out in 1905, inaugurated by a series of strikes. In an attempt to break a strike in St. Petersburg, the government killed more than 500 people, many of them women and children. The writing was on the palace wall ... the government of the czar would not be tolerated much longer. Like Louis XVI, Czar Nicholas attempted to maintain his regime while at the same time allowing for the expression of popular sentiment.

The ministers connected with the old regime were deposed, and a few were imprisoned. There was remarkably little loss of blood. Alexander Kerensky became head of the provisional republican government, July through November 19 1 7. Kerensky attempted to continue the war, went to the front himself, but failed to stop the Russian retreat. His authority was then greatly diminished. The Bolshevik Revolution (November 191 7): The name Bolshevik, which means the majority, was adopted by the followers of Lenin in 1905, when they split from the Social Democratic party. The Bolsheviks were joined by radicals of the Peasants Revolutionary party, and the two combined to overthrow the provisional government and create a 'Soviet republic.\" Lenin made separate peace with the Germans. Decrees were issued placing workmen in control of factories, private ownership of land was abolished, and mines, forests and waterways were taken over by the state. Marxism-Leninism became the official 'Scientific\" basis of the world's first state socialist government. Thus was born modem totalitarianism. Stalinism (1924-1953): Lenin died in 1924, and his place was taken by one of the greatest mass-murderers in history-Joseph Stalin. 'Stalih,\" meaning 'Steel,\" was an adopted name. Stalin was the personification of Leviathanism--he ruled by terror. He murdered indiscriminately. No one was safe. He was especially watcfil for anyone who might challenge him, and as a result he practically destroyed the leadership of his military forces. Consequently, when the German nation reemerged under Hitler as the most powerfbl nation in Europe, Stalin was compelled to enter into a non-aggression pact. Stalin's one positive claim to fame is that when Hitler turned on the Soviet Union, Stalin managed to rally a counter-offensive. Stalin, and the Russian winter, stopped the Germans. As a national hero, Stalin became even more murderous. It is believed that he was responsible for the death of more than 60 million people. The subject of Stalinization of the former Soviet Union is so painful, I find it difficult to go into detail. For those interested, I recommend a film called 'Stalin\" and the works of Aleksandr Sohhenitsyn, especially Re Gulag Archipelago. The Cold War (1945- 1990): What is called the 'Cold War\" began with an event that was cold only in the sense of ~thk!S~ne~~-the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. The dropping of these bombs, an act which implicated the United States (for the first time, overtly) in the mass destruction of civilian populations, was meant (so we are informed these days) as a 'barning\" to the Russians. The Russians apparently got the message. Under Stalin and his successors, the Soviet Union emerged ina very short time as a monolithic militaristic empire. The net result of the Soviet Union's long confrontattion with the 'Free World\" was collapse. The Soviet Union was not defeated by America, as a great many think. It was defeated by global socialism."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Another aspect of this is that the Soviet Union, specially the Bolshevik Revolution was in great part fbnded from the United States, as was the buildup of Nazi Germany. Again, the only way to institute global socialism, was to create extreme forms of the ypes of socialism that they desired to eliminate. This is why both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were fbnded by the Eastern Establishment in the United States. The \"Cold War\" was just a sham for public consumption. Gorbachev, who has never renounced Mamism, was 'imported\" into the United States by the Reagan-Bush administrations, who had as their objective global socialism, in order to participate in the political effort to dismantle the national military capablity of the United States, and to assist, while at the taxpayer- fbnded \"think tank (Gorbachev Institute) at the Presidio in San Francisco, in the dissolution of United States national sovereignty. Note that our current president Clinton spent time in the Soviet Union. It does not take a rocket scientist to understand the current political program. The 'Cold War\" was a sham because nuclear war assured mutual destruction and a nuclear winter from which the planet would never recover, and secondly, as the work of Bruce Cathie has shown, nuclear devices will not work except at specific earth grid locations at specific times, thus a 'billy nilly\" nuclear exchange is not possible to achieve. The destruction of the United States could only be achieved by \"communizing it,\" while at the same time the destruction of the Soviet Union could only be achieved by \"capitalizing\" it. The end result is that global socialism takes control. Unfortunately, those who promote global socialism do not hlly realize that it, too, is a system that cannot work--it can only promote the destruction of the human species. If an extreme of national socialism didn't work (Nazi Germany), an extreme of international socialism didn't work (Soviet Russia), what must by definition become an extreme (global socialism), cannot work. Only mutual aid, cooperation, and scientific holism will bring this planet into a new age and into a position to intermingle on an interplanetary scale.] Additional Persons and Derivative Concepts Behavioral Genetics: Behavioral genetics is the study of organisms by means of both behavioral and genetic analysis. Genetic analysis describes the genetic endowment of each species and is used to study the individual differences in the expression of a trait, in this case behavior. Behavior-genetic analysis is a method to determine how much a particular behavior trait is genetically influenced. Democracy: Early definitions of 'tlemocracy\" were seen in the work of Edmund Burke, as expressed in the 1928 U.S.Army Training Manual: 'A government of the masses. Authority derived through mass meeting or any form of direct expression. Results in mobocracy, attitude toward property rights is communistic (escalating property tax), ultimately negating property rights. The attitude toward law is that the perceived (orchestrated or coerced) will of the majority shall regulate, whether it be based on deliberation, or governed by passion, prejudice, and impulse, without restraint or regard to consequence. Results in demagogism, license, agitation, discontent and anarchy.\""},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Other sources (the Unseen Hand ) note that : 'h democracy is controlled at the top by a ruling oligarchy (rule of a few men), who hire demagogues (those hired to create anarchy or social discontent). As the oligarchy seeks more control, democracies convert into anarchy and eventual dictatorship, when the oligarchy imposes total control over the population (totalitarianism).\" Most sources seem to recognize that 'tlemocracy\" is a shadow of old-world 'tnonarchist\" concepts of the 'lower social classes\" and, according to Alexander Fraser Taylor, that '' democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can exist only until voters discover they can vote themselves a liberal gift out of the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that a democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal policy, always to be followed by a dictatorship.\" In its modern sense, 'tlemocracy\" was first used by opponents to describe egalitarian republicanism (e.g. the early American system). Democracy implies 'tlasses\" and 'tule by the commoners\" (as an elite body), as opposed to rule by aristocracy (another elite body). For this reason, the word democracy is not a suitable description of the American system as orginally designed, which abolished classes. Today, an ill-informed Bill Clinton recently made the public comment that 'the United States is the world's oldest democracy,\" making it obvious that he does not comprehend the concept of the United States as an egalitarian constitutional republic, but instead prefers a 'IAass\" system (note the constant political references in the media to the 'iniddle class') and socialism as a prelude to the \"new world order\" - global socialism. Determinism: Determinism is: [I] a word describing any theory which identifies a certain factor or factors as the causes (determiners) underlying the phenomena being analyzed, e.g., the ''sexual determinism7' of Sigmund Freud. A theory focusing on only one cause is often criticized as reductive determinism. Skinnerian behaviorism, for instance, is a form of reductive determinism focused exclusively on the role of external motivators/reinforcements (rewards, penalties) in determining behavior. Reductive determinism is characteristic of pseudo-sciences, such as genetics, behaviorism, etc., and does not reflect true science. [2] the theory that all human action is caused entirelv &y preceding events. and not bv the exercise of the will. In philosophy, the theory is based on the metaphysical principle that an uncaused event is impossible. The success of scientists in discovering causes of certain behavior and in some cases affecting its control appears to support this principle. Phvsical determinism is the theory that human interaction can be reduced to relationships between biological, chemical, or physical entities; this formulation is bdamental to modern sociobiology and neuropsychology. The historical determinism of Karl Maxx, on the other hand, is transpersonal and primarily economic. In contrast to these two formulations, p.ycholoaica1 determinism--the philosophical basis of psychoanalysis--is the theory that the purposes, needs, and desires of individuals are central to an explanation of human behavior. The recent behavioral determinism of B. F. Skinner is a modification of this view, in that Skinner reduces all internal psychological states to publicly observable behavior. His stimulus-response account also uses modern statistical and probabilistic analyses of causation."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Egalitarian Republicanism: 'Republic\" comes from the Latin res publica and means simply 'public affairs.\" In the past, a form of government replacing monarchy was called a republic, thus the dictionary definition 'h government having a chief of state who is not a monarch.\" Today, the term 'tepublic\" is erroneously used to describe virtually any kind of nation and its government. There are two basic types of republics -- elitist republics, those in which the ultimate power (sovereignty) belongs to an elite, and egalitarian republics, such as the early American republic, in which sovereignty lies with the people. In the elitist system, citizens are subjects. In the egalitarian system, citizens are 'to- owners\" of the system, or co-sovereigns. During the existence of the United States, the government was subverted from its original egalitarian form into an elitist form which included the concept of democracy. See Democracy. Eugenics: Eugenics, a pseudo-science concerned with the control of hereditary traits through selective human mating, is also defined as the deliberate control, by law or social pressure, of the perpetuation of human genetic traits. Charles Darwin's theory (1859) of evolution by 'hatural selection\" initiated modem eugenics as both a science and a social movement. By influencing reproduction, societies can affect both the direction and the rate at which human genetic evolution occurs. Sir Francis Galton, cousin of Darwin, was the intellectual father of modem eugenics, a word he coined in 1883. As a social movement, eugenics encompasses all efforts to modifi selection in order to brim about genetic chanae in a desired direction. Galton contended that the purpose of eugenics was not to copy the blind way in which selection often operates, but to deliberately change selection in a humane way. Eugenics programs are classified as positive if their aim is to increase reproduction of individuals considered most valuable to society. In general, rapidly developing disciplines and technologies such as genetic counseling, genetic enpineering, and amniocentesis enable couples to take the lead in making their own decisions to achieve euaenic goals. Negative eugenics programs seek to decrease reproduction by individuals with genetic traits perceived to be undesirable. Most commonly this has taken the form of compulsory sterilization of such individuals. German Nazis, who learned eugenic techniques in the United States in the 1920's and 193OYs, later took these practices to a ghastly extreme in support of their theory of Nordic superiority to other races. A number of eugenic conferences were hosted in the United States during the 20th century, and eugenic practices continue in various covert forms. The 1927 edition of the World Book Encyclopaedia, written in the United States during the time when eugenics was overtly being discussed, makes the distinction (Vol. 4, p.2090) between the concepts of positive eugenics, defined as encouragement of the multiplication of 'the fit,\" and negative eugenics, defined as prevention of multiplication of 'the un-fit.\" It also makes the distinction that negative eugenics requires considerable application of law, because 'the unfit ... can only be controlled by such policies as segregation, sterilization, etc.\" All of these elements were rampant in the United States until the late 1960's. Today, negative eugenic policies can be seen in the potential laws meant to exclude those with negative genetic predipsition, as implemented in the pseudo-sciences genetics and genetic engineering."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Feuerbach, Ludwig: b. July 28, 1804, d. Sept. 13, 1872, was a German philosopher noted for his highly critical psychological analysis of religious belief and for his contribution to materialism. A theology student at Heidelberg and Berlin, he was drawn into philosophy through the influence of G.W.F. Hegel. Feuerbach became a symbol for German liberals. His philosophical anthropology became a new point of departure for Hegelians such as Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx. The German idealist Hegel maintained that reality is the result of thought; Feuerbach maintained that thought is the result of reality. Hegel believed in the primacy of an absolute reason that realized itself through nature and humanity; Feuerbach believed in the primacy of human reason, which creates the only authentic reality a person can know and the only selfhood he or she can use. Hegel had placed reality in abstract thought; Feuerbach placed reality in people. Fichte, Johann Gottlieb: b. May 19, 1762, d. Jan. 27, 1814, was a German transcendental idealist philosopher. His Addresses to the Geman Nation (1807-08) strongly influenced the development of German nationalism. Crucial to the metaphysics of Fichte is his concept of the creative ego. According to him, this ego is neither subjective nor personal but, instead, is the universal and absolute ego fiom which all objective reality is derived. In actuality, objective reality, the explicate order, is derived from the implicate order, not from the ego. Fichte's work was essential to the development of a sinister form of German national \"egoism\" inherent in Nazism. Genocide: Genocide (Greek genos, \"race,\" and Latin cide, \"killing\") is the persecution or destruction of a national, racial, or religious group. Years before the word \"genocide\" was coined by the Polish-American scholar Raphael Lemkin in 1944, genocide was practiced by the Russians in their pogroms against the Jews, by the Turks, who slaughtered thousands of Armenians, and by the German Nazis, who systematically killed ethnic groups including Jews, Poles, and Gypsies. A more recent example is the slaughtering of the Bosnians by the Serbs in 1994-1995. In 1945 the NUREMBERG Tribunal, which tried Nazi war criminals, declared that persecution of racial and religious groups was a crime under international law. In 1948 the General Assembly of the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which took effect in 195 1. The nations that ratified the convention agreed that genocide was a matter of international concern. even if committed bv a ~overnment within its own territory. Any nation can ask the United Nations to take action to prevent or suppress acts of genocide. The United States is a sirmatoy of the Genocide Convention. but the US.

Locke, John: b. Aug. 29, 1632, d. Oct. 28, 1704, was an English philosopher and political theorist, the founder of British empiricism. Lockets Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690) is one of the classical documents of British empirical philosophy, and a principal statement of empiricism, and, broadly speaking, was an effort to formulate a view of knowledge consistent with the findings of Newtonian science. He held that ideas"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO come from two sources: sensation, which provides ideas about the external world, and reflection, or introspection, which provides the ideas of the internal workings of the mind. Locke maintained that the state of nature was a happy and tolerant one, that the social contract preserved the preexistent natural rights of the individual. Mill, John Stewart: political theorist John Stuart Mill wrote Principles of Political Economy (1 848). Mill was unable to deny the possibility of a Malthusian-Ricardian world of resource scarcity, but he was equally unwilling to confirm its inevitability. He had some confidence that humanity could check population growth while discovering and better utilizing resources. Mill also introduced a concept that would be especially relevant to the 20th century, the notion that personal solitude and natural beauty might be impaired through population growth and industry. The work of these three economists, especially Malthus, continues to influence environmental thought. Population Genetics: Population genetics describes, in mathematical terms, the consequences of heredity on a population (rather than on an individual). The system by which individuals mate determines how the genes are combined to form the genetic makeup of certain traits. Populations evolve by responding to changing environments through natural selection. The evolutionary response results from a a change in the frequency of gene alleles. (An allele is one of a group of genes that determine a specific trait, such as a gene for red flowers and one for white flowers.) A change in the frequency of alleles is initiated by a gene mutation that produces a new gene in one individual. This new gene affects evolution in the population, however, only if its frequency increases in successive generations and becomes spread throughout the population. Three researchers- -William W. Castle (1903), an American scientist, Geoffrey Hardy (1908, a British mathematician, and Wilhelm Weinberg (1908), a Gennan physician--independently found that the frequencies of genes in a population remain constant and their proportions stay the same unless certain evolutionary forces affect the population. The importance of mutation for the evolutionary process lies in its producing individuals with new structural and finctional traits. These individuals, as is true of all other members of the population, are exposed to natural selection, which determines whether the new alleles will increase or decrease in frequency in future generations. The various evolutionary forces studied in population genetics have been used in programs designed to increase food production, both plant and animal. Mutagenic agents are used in some plant programs to increase the amount of genetic variability in experimental populations, and then desirable traits are selected. Presumably, therefore, mutagenic agents can also be used to negatively affect experimental populations, including human populations (cause degenerative disease for financial profit, etc.) Sociology: The concept of \"civil society\" as a realm distinct from the state--as expressed in the writings of Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and later political thinkers of the Enlightenment--anticipated the subsequent focus of sociology, as did the philosophies of history of the Italian Giambattista Vico and the German G. W. F. Hegel with regard to the study of social change. The first definition of sociology was put forth by the French"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO philosopher Auguste Comte. In 1838, Comte coined the term sociology to describe his vision of a new science that would discover laws of human society resembling the laws of nature by applying the methods of strictly factual investigation that had proved so successfid in the physical sciences. The philosopher Herbert S~encer in England soon took up both Comte's term and his mission. Several near-contemporaries of Comte and Spencer who never called themselves sociologists are today also counted as founding fathers of the discipline. Karl Manr is the most important among them, but their number also includes Henri de Saint Simon, Alexis de Tocqueville, and to some extent John Stuart Mill. These men were largely speculative thinkers, although a quite different tradition of empirical, chiefly quantitative reporting of social facts also developed in the 19th century and later became incorporated into academic sociology. Not until the 1880s and '90s did sociology begin to be recognized as an academic subject. In France, Emile Durkheim, the intellectual heir of Comte, taught sociology at the universities of Bordeaux and Paris and founded the first real school of sociological thought. In Germany, not until the first decade of the 20th century was sociology recognized as an academic discipline, largely owing to the efforts of Max Weber. German sociolow, in contrast to the attempt to model the field after the physical sciences dominant in France and the Enghsh-speaking countries, was in large part an outgrowth of far-ranging historical scholarship; of a dialogue with Marxism; and of the human-centered focus of German philosophical idealism. The first two emphases were central to Weber's work, and the last predominated in the efforts of Georg Simmel to define sociology as a distinctive discipline. It was in North America that sociology embedded its deepest roots, originally under the influence of Herbert Spencer's efforts to apply the Darwinian idea of evolution to human society. One of the key American Spencerians was William Graham Surnner, who is believed to have taught the first course in sociology at Yale University as early as 1875. The first sociology professorship on the Eastern seaboard was held (1906) by Lester Ward (1 84 1 - 19 13), a more critical Spencerian, at Brown University, although the first department of sociology had earlier been established (1893) at the Universitv of Chicano. Following the emergence of a coherent Chicago school after World War I, that city remained the center of American sociology until the 1940s. Despite its European origins, sociology during the first half of the 20th century became primarily an American subject. After the decline of broad evolutionist theories in the Comtean and Spencerian mode, American sociology grew heavily empirical, quantitative, and oriented to the study of particular social problems. such as crime, marital discord, and the acculturation of immigrants. An exception was the influence at Chicago of George Herbert Mead, a pragmatist philosopher who had studied in Gerrnanv and whose stress on the roots of mind, self, and society in linguistic communication gave rise to an approach named symbolic interactionism by the sociologist Herbert Blumer, one of Mead's students. In the 1930s, Talcott Parsons of Harvard University introduced the ideas of the European sociologists Durkheim, Weber, and Vilftedo Pareto in a major work (ne Structure of Social Action, 1937) that singlehandedly overcame the parochialism of American sociology. At Harvard, Parsons constructed an elaborate theoretical system that attempted to account for virtually everything in human society. In the 1960s he was assailed by Mills and others, including a new generation of academic Marxists, for his"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO allegedly conservative bias reflected in his relative neglect of group conflict, social change, and the role of power in society. In the 1970s the currents of theoretical influence began once again to flow in a westward direction out of Europe. Jurgen Habermas, the heir of Germanv's FrankfUrt school of neo-Marxism, emerged as a master synthesizer, the role Parsons had played in the first postwar decades. French neo-Marxist structuralism also became an influence. Sociobiology: Sociobiology, or the study of animal and human social behavior in terms of evolutionary biology, holds that the theory of evolution by natural selection applies to behavior in the same way that it applies to structure andphysiology. Accordingly it relies upon the principle that genes are able to influence behavior and will be selected if the behaviors they encourage contribute ultimately to the reproductive success of the individuals carrying those genes. The \"fitness\" of an organism or a gene is a measure of the ability of that organism or gene to project copies of itself into fbture generations. Because natural selection would influence genetically controlled behaviors, sociobiologists believe that individuals will tend to behave in ways that maximize their fitness. Totalitarianism: Totalitarianism is a form of government in which all societal resources are monopolized by the state in an effort to penetrate and control all aspects of public andprivate life. This control is facilitated hpropaganda and by advances in technolom. It was first used to describe the organizational principles of the National Socialist (Nazi) party in Germany. Totalitarian regimes are characterized by distinctive types of ideology and organization. Totalitarian ideologies reject existing society as compt, immoral, and beyond reform, project an alternative society in which these wrongs are to be redressed, and provide plans and proms _for realizing the alternative order. These ideologies, supported by propaganda campaigns, demand total conformity on the part of the people; Totalitarian fonns of organization enforce this demand for conformity. The political structure penetrates the entire country through regional, provincial, local, and \"primary\" organization. A paramilitary secret police ensures compliance Information and ideas are effectively organized through the control of television, radio, the press, and education at all levels. In short, totalitarian regrmes seek to dominate all aspects of national lve. In this respect totalitarianism differs from older concepts of dictatorship or tyranny, which seek limited--typically political--control. In addition, totalitarian regimes mobilize and make use of mass political participation, whereas dictatorships seek only pacified and submissive populations. Finally, totalitarian regrmes seek the complete reconstruction of the individual and society; this is todqy reflected in the series of attempts to transfer national sovereignty to global organizations. (examples: Hitler's 'iace purification\" programs, the Republican 'Contract with America': the Democratic 'National Health Plan\", the New Deal and the 'New Covanent') .Dictatorships attempt simply to rule over the individual and society. The United States, originally meant to be a Constitutional Egalitarian Republic, has over time degenerated into a partial National Socialist Totalitarian Dictatorship managed by Oligarchic International Corporate Capitalism.

Hall, Ph.D With permission for Matrix III Volume 2 In the conclusion of his remarkable book The Nazi Doctors--Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide, Robert Jay Lifton writes of a visit to Auschwitz: \"I went to the camp a few years ago and was shown the many exhibits maintained there, exhibits that leave nothing to be added concerning the evil human beings can do to other human beings. But the one that lefi the most profound impression on me was the simplest of all: a room full of shoes, mostly baby shoes.\" Genocidal campaigns are not new. They occurred before the Holocaust; and they are occumng at this moment.What distinguishes the Nazi \"race purification\" extermination program fiom other genocidal campaigns is its \"scientific\" character. At a mass meeting in 1934, Nazi Deputy Party Leader Rudolf Hess stated, \"National Socialism is nothing but applied biology.\" \"The entire Nazi regime was built,\" Lifion writes, \"on a biomedical vision that required the kind of racial purification that would progress fiom sterilization to extensive killing.\" As early as the publication of Mein Kampf (1924-26), Lifion indicates, \"Hitler had declared the sacred racial mission of the German people to be 'assembling and preserving the most valuable stocks of basic racial elements [and] . . . . slowly and severely raising them to a dominant position.' . . .\" Where did the \"biomedical vision\" of Hitler and his party originate? The primary sources were: Darwinian biology and evolutionary theory; Social Darwinism, the evangelistic dissemination of Darwinism; and a pseudo-science called \"eugenics.\" In the first several decades of the twentieth century, eugenics was considered by many as humanity's best hope for the future. It played the role now played by \"genetic engineering.\" It was applied Darwinism. The following outlines, briefly, the nature of these related sources: Today, our orthodox theory of biology and evolution is \"neo-Darwinism.\" Neo- Darwinism combines what is called \"classical Darwinism\" with modern genetics. classical Darwinism dates fiom 1859, the year in which Enghsh naturalist Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, subtitled (note careMy) me Preservation of the Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. Despite the fact key premises underlying Darwin's theory were unproven scientifically, the theory was embraced by numerous scientists and intellectuals as if it was gospel -- the Gospel of Science. In a relatively short time, the Origin replaced the Bible as western civilization's preferred authoritative text on the subject of the nature of lie on Earth. In 1 87 1, Darwin published the even more controversial The Descent of Man."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO The major premises of Darwinism may be summarized as follows: (1) The first premise, the concept of the evolutionary transformation of one species into others, was derived fiom the \"Transformism\" of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who founded evolutionary science in 1809 with the publication of Philosophie Zoologique. In his History of Creation (1873), evolutionist Ernst Haeckel writes, \"To him [Lamarck] will always belong the immortal glory of having for the first time worked out the Theory of Descent, as an independent scientific theory of the first order, and as the philosophical foundation for the whole science of Biology.\" Indeed, the very term \"biology\" was coined by Lamarck. Darwin became acquainted with the work of Lamarck through his fiend and mentor, the eminent geologist Charles Lyell. Volume I1 of Lyell's Principles of Geology, which contains a long exposition of the Lamarck theory, was received by Darwin in South America in 1832, in the first of his five years engagement as ship's naturalist on the H.M.S. Beagle. (2) The second premise of Darwin's theory is that \"natural selection\" is the cause of divergence in species, i.e., the origin of species. The first published mention of the idea of Nature-as-selector is in Rousseau's \"Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality Among Men\" (1755). In a discussion of the conditions of life in ancient Sparta, Rousseau writes, \"Nature used them precisely as did the law of Sparta the children of her citizens. She rendered strong and robust those with a good constitution and destroyed all the others.\" A more immediate source was the evolutionary theory of English naturalist Alfied Russel Wallace, who committed to paper a theory of evolution by natural selection prior to the completion of Darwin's work. In June of 1858, Wallace submitted to Darwin an unpublished work titled 'On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely fiom the Original Type.\" Shortly thereafter, Darwin wrote to Lyell, \"Your words have come true with a vengeance -- that I should be [could be] forestalled. You said this when I explained to you here very briefly my view on Natural Selection depending on the struggle for existence. I never saw a more striking coincidence; if Wallace had my M.S. written out in 1842, he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters . . . . \" Had Wallace simply published his manuscript, he would have had priority with regard to the concept of evolution by natural selection. Instead, priority went to Darwin. The questionable means by which priority was confened on Darwin are discussed in a fascinating book by Arnold Brackrnan titled A Delicate Arrangement. Darwin's understanding of natural selection derived fiom his work with breeding. The breeding of plants and animals Darwin called \"artificial selection;\" the breeding that occurs in \"the wild\" he called \"natural selection.\" Early in the Origin, Darwin defines natural selection in these (anthropomorphic) terms: \"Natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing . . . . every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO that is good; silently and insensibly working . . . . at the improvement of each organic being . . . .\" In effect, Darwinism replaces the traditional belief that order in nature is the result of a divine presence (God) with the idea it is the result of a natural presence (Natural Selection). (3) The third premise in Darwinism is that the drive behind evolution is the sexual- reproductive instinct. Given the tremendous influence of this drive, life is an incessant struggle for existence: \"A struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all organic beings tend to increase. Every being . . . must suffer destruction . . . otherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the product. Hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life. . . .\" The basic premise (\"the high rate at which all organic beings tend to increase\") and the \"principle of geometrical increase\" are, as Darwin indicates, \"the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdom. . . . \" The Malthus in question is the Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus (1 766-1 834), famous \"pessimist\" and author of one of the most influential essays in modem times -- the \"Principle of Population\" (1798). In this essay, Malthus argues that because \"all animated life [tends] to increase beyond the nourishment prepared for it,\" there can never be real progress or happiness for mankind. Give man a little more bread than usual, he'll breed more than usual, wiping out his little gains. Populations increase by geometrical progression, Malthus asserted, while the means of subsistence increase by only mathematic progression. Thus man is doomed to procreate himself into destitution. Malthus, one of the founders of the \"dismal science\" of economics, painted visions of a &re filled, inescapably, with starving and diseased multitudes. Before Malthus and his nightmarish visions, the rulers of Europe looked upon large populations as assets; after the \"Principle of Population,\" they began to view the same populations as liabilities, potentially disastrous liabilities. The revolution in America and the abortive revolution in France had made it very clear that masses can be lethal to the ruling classes, and Malthus provided just the perspective the rulers of Europe were looking for. The masses are totally unprincipled. Populations must be strictly controlled. In 1789, the first year of the French Revolution, the European country with the largest population was France. The statistics were on the wall, and the rulers of Europe were not slow in reading them. In the opening half of the nineteenth century, throughout Europe, members of the ruling classes gathered to discuss the newly discovered \"~o~ulation problem\" and to devise ways of implementing the Malthusian mandate, to increase the mortality rate of the poor: \"Instead of recommending cleanliness to the poor, we should encourage contrary"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO habits. In our towns we should make the streets narrower, crowd more people into the houses, and court the return of the plague. In the country we should build our villages near stagnant pools, and particularly encourage settlements in all marshy and unwholesome situations,\" and so forth and so on. The Reverend Malthus, who took the understandable precaution of publishing his \"Population\" essay anonymously (in 1798), is the prototype of the Nazi-style social theorist. \"Malthusianism,\" as it was called, found adherents throughout Europe, but few of these dared to express their opinions outside the private chambers of fellow believers. By the end of the century, however, the Malthusians were out of the closet. In Germany, \"racial scientists\" openly advocated the killing of unwanted members and segments of the population. One of these scientists, Adolf Jost, \"issued an early call for direct medical killing in a book published in 1895 . . . Be Right To Death @as Recht auf den Tod).\" Jost argued that for the sake of the health of the social organism, the state must take responsibility for the death of individuals. Adolf Jost was a mentor to Adolf Hitler, who agreed 100 percent. \"The state must see to it that only the healthy beget children,\" Hitler said. \"The state must act as the guardian of a millennial future. . . . It must put the most modern medical means in the service of this knowledge. It must declare unfit for propagation all who are in any way visibly sick or who have inherited a disease and can therefore pass it on.\" Between the first decade of the nineteenth century and the last, what was it that occurred that made Malthusianism \"respectable?\" Darwinism. Specifically: Darwin's adoption of the \"Malthus doctrine\" as his third premise. In the third premise is a foundation of the Third Reich. In effect, if not intent, Darwinism is Malthusianism, re- presented in the guise of true science. Under the banner of Darwinism, \"The Only True & Sacred Biology & Evolution,\" the Malthusians and their masters were able to wreak havoc in our civilization. Among their legacies are the ravages of the imperialists in the late nineteenth century, the lethal socialisms that have plagued our century, the world wars, holocaust after holocaust, and very possibly one or more of the serious diseases which now afnict humanity. **************** In Palo Alto, early 1994, I attended a lecture on evolution by a distinguished Stanford professor. The professor began his lecture with the bald statement, \"Today, the science of evolution is synonymous with Darwinism.\" The professor paused, smiled. There were no challenges fiom the audience, and so he continued, repeating the \"truisms\" of Darwinism, truisms that are not true but only seem so because they've been repeated so often. Unlike any other scientific theory I know of, Darwinism has survived rehtation after refutation. In 197 1, Norman Macbeth, a Harvard-trained lawyer who made the study of Darwinian theory his avocation for many years, published quite a good critique of Darwinism -- Darwin Retried. One of Macbeth's major concluding points, which is well documented, is that most Darwinists have little confidence in their own theory. The eminent Karl Popper calls the book \"an excellent and fair, though unsympathetic retrial of"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Darwin.\" (What \"sympathy\" has to do with science I do not know.) It is 1995, almost twenty-five years later. Darwinism is still our orthodox biology. In 1986, Australian scientist Michael Denton published Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, a thoroughgoing critique of Darwinism which concludes that the much-celebrated theory is \"the great cosmogenic myth of the twentieth century.\" \"One might have expected,\" Denton writes, \"that a theory of such cardinal importance, a theory that literally changed the world, would have been something more than metaphysics, something more than a myth.\" Practically in the same breath, Denton remarks that \"Darwinism remains . . the only truly scientific theory of evolution.\" Denton's confbsion is understandable. It is difficult to believe that a theory with so little merit could have become so profoundly entrenched in our science -- and in the conventional wisdom. Isn't science supposed to fiee us fiom myth? Darwinism may remain the teflon orthodoxy for another twenty-five years. That should not dissuade us fiom the vital work of critique. So far, we've analyzed Darwinism into its three basic premises. How valid (strong) are those premises? (1) The strength of Darwinism is in the first premise, the Larnarckian premise of the evolutionary transformation of one species into others. Lacking sufficient datq Lamarck viewed the evolutionary line as strictly linear. Species A produces B, B produces C, C produces D, and so on. In 1855, Alfied Wallace re-articulated the premise, arguing that the evolutionary line may be branched, i.e., Species A may produce C as well as B, B may produce D, E and F, etc. Further, Wallace argued, evolutionary steps are not necessarily \"progressive\" (more and more perfect), as Lamarck had maintained. The Wallace articulation came to be known as \"the Sarawak Law.\" Every species has come into existence coincident both in time and space with a pre-existing closely allied species. The long and short of it is: When the Lamarck-Wallace premise fell into Darwin's hands, it was in good shape scientifically. It was, and is, a valid premise, supported by much evidence. (2) Darwin's second premise, that natural selection is the cause of divergence in species, is what is called an \"empty generalization.\" It sounds good, but it tells us nothing. If I were to tell you that the cause of divergence in species was the \"environment,\" would you find that an adequate explanation? No, of course not. \"You must be more specific,\" you would say. \"What is it, specifically, in the environment that causes divergence?\" \"Natural selection\" is no more specific than \"environment.\" It is not difficult to understand why so many scientists have accepted the premise of natural selection uncritically. It does seem to be an explanation more in the scientific direction than \"Zeus,\" for instance, of \"Jehova.\" Nevertheless, natural selection is simply a \"false scent\" that takes us nowhere, except deeper and deeper into the woods. Darwin himself was uneasy with the term. In the sixth and last edition of the Origin, he says that survival of the fittest is a \"more accurate\" expression of what he had previously called"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO natural selection. Interestingly, the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was coined not by Darwin, but by philosopher-evolutionist Herbert Spencer some seven or eight years before the publication of the Origin. By 1872, the phrase had become the common catchword (slogan) for Darwinism. Darwin laid claim to it (\"selected\" it, we should say), preferring it over the meaningless natural selection. Further, the concept of natural selection was tied too closely to Alfred Wallace, the talented young evolutionist who had been totally eclipsed by Darwin. (When the famous theory of evolution was first presented, it was called the \"Darwin-Wallace\" theory. A correct title would have been the \"Wallace-Darwin\" theory.) The phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was the product of one of Darwin's most ardent apostles. Mr. Spencer was quite delighted Darwin adopted the phrase. (3) Darwin's third premise -- the so-called \"Malthus doctrine\" -- has no scientific validity, and it never did. In the modem jargon of critique, we would call the Malthus doctrine an example of \"reductive, or simplistic, sexual determinism.\" (Sigmund Freud is whipped routinely by contemporary commentators for having fallen into the trap of sexual determinism.) The idea that \"all animated life\" is governed exclusively by the sexual- reproductive drive was suggested to Malthus by early eighteenth century reports regarding goats that had been released by buccaneers on certain of the Galapagos islands circa the 1670s. The reports indicated that the goats had multiplied to the point that scarcely a bit of vegetation was left. Malthus read the reports and concluded that human beings, if left to their own devices, would do the same thing. They would reproduce themselves right out of house and home, to the point the entire population would be left without a can of beans. This conclusion is the pseudo-scientific basis of the \"Malthus doctrine\" that Darwin so enthusiastically embraced, and amplified -- by his declaration that it \"applied . . . to the whole animal and vegetable kingdom. \" Any form of reductive determinism is the intellectual equivalent of a tar pit. Malthus was trapped in his own tar. In later life, he endeavored to correct the erroneous doctrine, but by then, it was too late. The doctrine had become a part of our common stock of \"true ideas about the way things are.\" Thus it is that Darwin writes with such certainty, that \"There is no exception to the rule, that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate, that if not destroyed [Italics mine], the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair . . . .\" \"Even slow-breeding man has doubled in twenty-five years,\" Darwin continues, \"and at this rate, in a few thousand years, there would literally not be standing room for his progeny.\" This \"Malthus-Darwin doctrine,\" let us call it, was the basis for much hysteria in the ruling classes of the last century. The Malthus-Darwin doctrine clearly suggested that the human population of the planet had become a problem. \"If not destroyed,\" to use Darwin's phrase, this population would soon leave the planet as barren as the goat-infested Galapagos islands. The Malthus-Darwin doctrine had no scientific"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO basis whatsoever; it was based on the erroneous reasoning of Malthus. Darwin should have known better. Perhaps he did. Whatever the case, the doctrine was a big hit with the rulers of the last century, a strong incitement -- sanctioned by science -- to over-run the planet before others did so. Suddenly, the nations of Europe found themselves with \"surplus populations.\" The Age of Imperialism was born, as nation after nation entered the race to acquire foreign lands and foreign countries, not because of greed, but because of national survival. The nations that would survive into the future would be those in possession of vast tracts of land for the dumping of surplus population. In a very short time, all of Afiica was carved up by the European nations. Aboriginal peoples of that continent who objected to slavery were slaughtered. Many great tribes -- tribes that for thousands of years had existed in balance with their environment -- were eradicated in the \"Afiican Holocaust.\" Imperialistic competition for \"empire\" (i.e., colonies throughout the world) was probably the principal reason for World War I. In 1901, Arthur Dix, the editor of two Berlin journals, writes, \"A timorous people, which knows not how to use its elbows, may of course put a stop to the increase in its population -- it might find things too narrow at home. The superfluity of population might find no economic existence. A people happy in its future, however, knows nothing of an artificial limitation; its only care can be to find room on the globe for a livelihood for other members of its own race.\" In Britain as Germany's Vassal (1912), German Social Darwinist (and retired general) F. Von Bernhardi writes, \"In the interest of the world's civilization it is our duty to enlarge Germany's colonial empire. Thus alone can we politically, or at least nationally, unite the Germans throughout the world, for only then will they recognize that Gennan civilization is the most necessary factor in human progress. We must endeavor to acquire new territories throughout the world by all means in our power, because we must preserve to Germany the millions of Germans who will be born in the We, and we must provide for them food and employment. They ought to be enabled to live under a German sky, and to lead a German life.\" Given such attitudes -- not only in Gennany, but throughout Europe -- war became inevitable. It was inevitable for another reason as well: War was viewed by Bernhardi and his many Social Darwinist colleagues in Europe as \"an indispensable regulator\" of populations. \"If it were not for war,\" Bernhardi writes, \"we should probably find that inferior and degenerate races would overcome healthy and youthfbl ones by their wealth and their numbers. The generative importance of war lies in this, that it causes selection, and thus war becomes a biological necessity.\" The German word for \"colonies around the world in which to dump surplus populations\" was \"Lebensraum\" -- living space. For the Germans, the loss of the First World War meant, among other dire things, the loss of their lebensraum. The punitive reparations demanded by the victors was a serious matter; far more serious was the fact that Germany was physically contracted and stripped of her colonies. This contraction of Germany was, from the point of view of the Darwinists in that country, a death sentence."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO With the empire-building option blocked (momentarily at least), German social planners began to focus more exclusively on internal' options for guaranteeing the survival of the German race. In 1923, Fritz Lenz, a Germany physician-geneticist who became a leading ideologue in the Nazi racial purification program, complained bitterly that Germany under the Weimar Constitution was falling far behind America in the all-important field of eugenics, the science of improving the race by means of \"selection\" of degenerate individuals and groups for sterilization: \"Lenz complained that provisions in the Weimar Constitution (prohibiting the infliction of bodily alterations on human beings) prevented widespread use of vasectomy techniques; that Germany had nothing to match the eugenics research institutions in England and the United States (for instance, that at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, led by Charles B. Davenport and funded by the Carnegie Institution in Washington and by Mary Harriman).\" Mary Harriman was the widow of the railroad tycoon E. H. Haniman. Both E. H. Hamman and Andrew Carnegie had been great admirers of Herbert Spencer, who was the chief conduit in America for Darwinian dogma. In historical context, \"eugenics\" may be defined as applied Darwinism. The founder of eugenics is Francis Galton, a cousin of Darwin's and the author of several highly influential books on heredity, including Hereditary Genius (1869), Inquiries into Human Fadties (1 883), and National Inheritance (1889). Not long after Galton published the last-named book, a group of so-called \"racial scientists\" became quite active in Germany. (Also influential in the formation of the group was German Social Darwinist Ernst Haeckel, who declared that the various races may be defined as separate species.) One of these scientists was Adolf Jost, previously cited as the author of The Right to Death (1895). The main thesis of this book is that the final solution to the population problem is state control over human reproduction. The book is couched in the rhetoric of (Darwinian) natural rights. The state has a natural right and a sacred responsibility to kill individuals in order to keep the nation, the social organism, alive and healthy. Later advocates of state-medical killing, such as law professor Karl Binding of the University of Leipzig and Alfred Hoche, professor of psychiatry at the University of Freiburg, would stress the therapeutic value of destroying \"lie unworthy of life.\" The destruction of such life is \"purely a healing treatment.\" Between the world wars, sterilization became the most preferred tool for the control of population. The fact the Weimar Constitution did not allow sterilization was no small matter; Social Darwinistic scientists and their followers saw it as a dire threat to the nation. \"If the power to fight for one's own health is no longer present,\" Hitler wrote, \"the right to live in this world of struggle ends. \" To understand why sterilization was such an important issue for the Social Darwinists, we need not look far. \"In civilized man,\" Ernst Mayr (America's dean of Darwinism) writes, \"the two components of selective value, adaptive superiority and reproductive success, no longer coincide. The individuals with above-average genetic endowments do not necessarily make an above-average contribution to the gene pool of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO the next generation.\" Indeed, Mayr continues, \"shifiless, improvident individuals who have a child every year are certain to add more genes to the gene pool of the next generation than those who carefilly plan the size of their families. Natural selection has no answer to this predicament. [Italics mine) The separation [in] the modern society of mere reproductive success from genuine adaptedness poses a serious problem for man's fiture.\" In other words: When humans are in the state of nature, their numbers (and their quality as biological organisms) are effectively controlled by natural selection. In the struggle for existence, the fittest usually win, and the weakest usually lose. The winners get to pass on their winning genes; the losers get to skulk away and die. When man becomes \"civilized,\" however, the game changes. The weak are no longer destroyed. Indeed, the weak are protected by unnatural do-gooder religions and philosophies. They are given advantages they have not earned. They have nothing to do in life but reproduce, and reproduce they do -- \"a child every year,\" according to Mayr. While those who are unworthy of life proliferate right and lefi, the genuinely superior find themselves more and more restricted, more and more disadvantaged in the evolutionary struggle. Thus it is Mayr issues his dark prognosis . . . this situation \"poses a serious problem for man's future.\" Mayr's view is essentially a contemporary re-statement of the old eugenics propaganda. When Hitler and his Nazis commenced their programs of sterilization and extermination, they were operating on the firm conviction that for the sake of the German people and the hre of man, National Socialism must take over where Natural Selection left of In Darwinism -- both classical and neo-Darwinism -- natural selection is the only ordering principle in nature. If the principle of natural selection is thwarted by misguided man, what is the inevitable result? Disorder, degeneracy, and destruction. In a great many ways, the Nazi movement was a crusade against what they perceived as degeneracy, a crusade in the name of the new god . . . Science. The legacy of the Malthus-Darwin doctrine is sad indeed. The mandate it gave our plers was, \"Control population and progress . . . or perish.\" From this mandate arose two political strategies that were to make the twentieth century the most cruel and barbaric on record. One of these strategies was strictly Malthusian: \"Do nothing for the masses except that which accelerates their destruction.\" This was called \"laissez-faire\" . . . don't interfere. The other strategy saw in totalitarianism, the complete control of society by the state, the only satisfactory answer to the population problem. Most of the \"socialisms\" of our century fall in this category."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Jean Baptiste Lamark ROUSS~~U - 1 775 \"The Sarawak Law\" Theory of Decent Tranformism \"Discourse on the Origin and ..

(2) Less than 11% of the Earth's ice-free land area is used for agriculture. (3) Somewhere between 8 and 22 times the current world population could support itself at the present standard of living, using present technology. (4) This leaves 50% of the Earth's land surface open to wildlife and conservation areas. The lower limit of 8 times the current population (about 44 billion) has been considered as being perfectly workable.' In addition to the fact that many new strains of food have been developed that can boost food production, there are other indications that food would not be a problem. In the September 1976 issue of Scientific American, Dr. David Hopper asserted that the worlds \"food problem\" does not arise from any physical limitation on potential output or any danger of unduly stressing the environment. 27ze limitations on abundance are to be found in social andpolitical structures of nations and the economic relations between them. In fact the planet, during its least populous years, suffered from hunger and famine. It was only when state political controls receeded in the late 19th century that hunger also began to receed. With the rise of Communism, welfare states, fascism and international corporate capitalism (all forms of Darwinist Socialism), many of the destructive controls preventing adequate growth and distribution of resources returned. Since absolute cooperation and free-market planetary economic is counterproductive to global socialist and capitalist goals, it is quite apparent that the myth of overpopulation is a form of attack on this same free market, even though no more lawlessness and evil use of men and materials exists than under Socialism. It is curious that many densely populated countries with relatively free economies are thriving, and are seldom mentioned in the \"over-population\" debate, while sparsely populated nations with oppressive governments are 'plagued with problems relating to population.\" Taiwan, with a population density of five times that of China, produces 20 times as much Gross National Product than China. Similarly, Singapore, with a density of 1 1,910 per square mile, enjoys a per capita GNP of $8,782, while Ethiopia, with a density of 10 1 per square mile, has a per capita GNP of $12 1. The real problem is that big government is the greatest obstacle to the social advancement of the human race. ' According to Dr. Kasun, 'better yields andlor the use of a larger share of the land area would support over 40 billion persons.\" Former Haward Center for Population Studies Director Roger Revelle estimated that the agricultural resources of the world were capable of providing an adequate diet (2,500 kilocalories per day) for 40 billion people, and that it would require the use of less than 25% of the Earth's ice-free land area. Revelle estimated that the lessdeveloped continents were capable of feeding 18 billion people, and that Africa alone was capable of feeding 10 billion people, or twice the current world population, and more than 12 times the 1990 population of Africa."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Media Propaganda Portraying Water Distribution as a Non-Political Problem, - - Avoiding the Issue of Lack of Cooperation and Mutual Aid, and Expressing Malthusian Dictates Which Have No Scientific Merit World Bank: Population squ-eezing water supply The Associated Press 8-74>' WASHINGTON - The world will spend $600 billion during the next decade to augment water reserves, as demand spurred by urbanization and agriculture outstrips available supplies, according to the World Bank. \"We are warning the world that there is a huge problem looming out there,\" said Ismail Serageldin, a bank vice president. \"Unless cur- rent trends are reversed, we will have a worsening water crisis around the planet\" Water is abundant in many parts of the world, but some 80 countries are experiencing water shortages serious enough to threaten agricul- ture, said a World Bank report, re- leased Sunday.

The Prussian philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1 762-1 8 14), described by many as a philosopher and a transcendental idealist, wrote \"Addresses to the German Nation7' between 1807 and 1808, which promoted the state as a necessary instrument of social and moral progress. He taught at the University of Berlin fiom 18 10 to his death in 18 14. His concept of the state and of the ultimate moral nature of society directly influenced both Von Schelling and Hegel, who took an similarly idealistic view. Using the basic philosophy prescribing the \"duties of the state\", combined with John Locke's view (1690) that \"children are a blank slate\" and lessons fiom Rousseau on how to \"write on the slate\", Prussia established a three-tiered educational system that was considered \"scientific\" in nature. Work began in 1807 and the system was in place by 18 19. An important part of the Prussian system was that it defined for the child what was to be learned, what was to be thought about, how long to think about it and when a child was to think of something else. Basically, it was a system of thought control, and it established a penchant in the psyche of the German elite that would later manifest itself into what we now refer to as mind control. The educational system was divided into three groups. The elite of Prussian society were seen as comprising .5% of the society. Approximately 5.5% of the remaining children were sent to what was called realschulen, where they were partially taught to think. The remaining 94% went to volkschlen, where they were to learn \"harmony, obdience, freedom fiom stressfbl thinking and how to follow orders.\" An important part of this new system was to break the link between reading and the young child, because a child who reads too well becomes knowledgable and independent fiom the system of instruction and is capable of finding out anything. In order to have an efficient policy- making class and a sub-class beneath it, you've got to remove the power of most people to make anything out of available information. This was the plan. To keep most of the children in the general population fiom reading for the first six or seven years of their lives. Now, the Prussian system of reading was originally a system whereby whole sentences (and thus whole integrated concepts) were memorized, rather than whole words. In this three-tier system, they figured out a way to achieve the desired results. In the lowest category of the system, the volkschelen, the method was to divide whole ideas (which simultaneously integrate whole disciplines - math, science, language, art, etc.) into subjects which hardly existed prior to that time. The subjects were &her divided into units requiring periods of time during the day. With appropriate variation, no one would really know what was happening in the world. It was inherently one of the most brilliant methods of knowledge suppression that had ever existed. They also replaced the alphabet system of teaching with the teaching of sounds. Hooked on phonics? Children could read without understanding what they were reading, or all the implications."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO In 18 14, the first American, Edward Everett, goes to Prussian to get a PhD. He eventually becomes governor of Massachusetts. During the next 30 years or so, a whole line of American dignitaries came to Germany to earn degrees (a German invention). Horace Mann, instrumental in the development of educational systems in America, was among them. Those who earned degrees in Germany came back to the United States and staffed all of the major universities. In 1850, Massachusetts and New York utilize the system, as well as promote the concept that \"the state is the father of children.\" Horace Mann's sister, Elizabeth Peabody (Peabody Foundation) saw to it that after the Civil War, the Prussian system (taught in the Northern states) was integrated into the conquered South between 1865 and 191 8. Most of the \"compulsory schooling\" laws designed to implement the system were passed by 1900. By 1900, all the PhD's in the United States were trained in Prussia. This project also meant that one-room schoolhouses had to go, for it fostered independence. They were eventually wiped out. One of the reasons that the self-appointed elite brought back the Prussian system to the United States was to ensure a non-thinking work force to staff the growing industrial revolution. In 1776, for example, about 85% of the citizens were reasonably educated and had independent livelihoods - they didn't need to work for anyone. By 1840, the ratio was still about 70%. The attitude of \"learn and then strike out on your own\" had to be broken. The Prussian system was an ideal way to do it. One of the prime importers of the German \"educational\" system into the United States was William T. Harris, from Saint Louis. He brought the German system in and set the purpose of the schools to alienate children from parental influence and that of religion. He preached this openly, and began creating \"school staffing\" programs that were immediately picked up by the new \"teacher colleges\", many of which were underwritten by the Rockefeller family, the Carnegies, the Whitney's and the Peabody family. The University of Chicago was underwritten by the Rockefellers. The bottom line is that we had a literate country in the United States before the importation of the German educational system, designed to \"dumb down\" the mass population. It was more literate that it is today. The textbooks of the time make so much allusion to history, philosophy, mathematics, science and politics that they are hard to follow today because of the way people are \"taught to think.\" Now, part of this whole paradigm seems to originate from an idea presented in Be New Atlantis, by Francis Bacon (1627). The work described a \"world research university\" that scans the planet for babies and talent. The state then becomes invincible because it owned the university. It becomes impossible to revolt against the State because the State knows everything. A reflection of this principle can be seen today with the suppression of radical and practical technologies in order to preserve State control of life and prevent evolution and independence. The New Atlantis was widely read by German mystics in the 19th century.

All of them drawing in talent and developiong it for the purposes of State power and stability. The Birth of Experimental Psychology in Germany By the middle of the 19th century, Germany had developed a new concept in the sciences which they termed \"psycho-physics\", which argued that people were in fact complex machines. It was the ultimate materialist extension of science that would parallel the mechanistic view of the universe already under way. This new view of people became more or less institutionalized in Germany, and by the 1870's the \"field of experimental psychology was born. The ultimate purpose of experimental psychology was to discover the nature of the human machine and how to program it. The main proponent of this new experimental psychology in Germany was Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), who is today widely regarded as the \"father\" of that field. He is described by orthodoxy as having \"freed the study of the mind from metaphysics and rational philosophy.\" Presumably in favor of irrational philosophy. Wundt obtained his PhD in medicine from the University of Heidelburg in 1856, and embarked on the study of sensory perception. His most famous work was \"Contributions to the Theory of Sense Perception\" , done between 1858 and 1862. It is described by orthodoxy as the first work of experimental psychology. In 1875, Wundt was appointed to a chair in philosophy at Leipzig, where he instituted a laboratory for the \"systematic, experimental study of experience.\" Back then, the phase \"get a life\" was not in vogue, and evidently he didn't have much interpretable experience of his own. In 1873, he began a year-long writing project which resulted in \"Principles of Physiological Psychology\", which became a \"classic\" that was subsequently reprinted through six editions over the next 40 years, establishing psychology's claim to be an \"independent science\". Wundt also wrote on philosophical subjects such as logic and ethics, but as he did not subscribe to \"rational philiosophy\", his writings presumably yielded irrational interpretations of both areas. It is conceivable that his warped view of humanity and the universe contributed in some small way to the eventual Nazi penchant for experimenting on those they didn't like, producing for them an irrational experience they would never forget. American students of Wundt who returned to the United States between 1880 and 1910 became the heads of Psychological Departments at major universities, such as Harvard, Cornell, and the University of Pennsylvania, to name a few. Wundt trained James Cattell, who on his return to the United States trained over 300 PhD's in the Wundt world view. The system of \"educational psychology\" evolved from this. Funded by the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations, the Wundtian system gains control over educational testing in the United States for soldiers of World War I."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The \"Educational System\" Expands The wave of immigration which began in 1848, combined with the visibility of revolutions taking place all over Europe, helped foster uncertainty in the public mind. Laws requiring compulsory schooling were then legislated. It was all very Hegelian. We wouldn't want those little tykes to become reactionaries, would we? In 1890, Carnegie wrote a series of essays called The Gospel of Wrath, in which he claimed that the capitalistic free enterprise system was dead in the United States. It really was, since Carnegie, Rockefeller and Morgan, by then, owned the United States. It was about 1917 that a great \"Red Scare\" was instituted in the United States in order to set up a reactionary movement intended to get the public to accept the idea of compulsory schooling - Prussian compulsory schooling, of course. The implimentation of the German educational nightmare in the United States met some initial resistence. In Carnegie's home town of Gary, Indiana, the system was implemented between 1910 and 19 16, mostly through the efforts of William Wirt, the school superintendent. It involved no academic endeavor whatsoever. It worked so well in supplying willing workers for the steel mills that it was decided by Carnegie to bring the system to New York City. In 1917, they initiated a program in New York in 12 schools, with the objective of enlarging the program to encompass 100 schools and eventually all the schools in New York. William Wirt came to supervise the transition. Unfortunately for Carnegie, the population of the 12 schools was predominently composed of Jewish immigrants, who innately recognized what was being done and the nature of the new \"educational system\". Three weeks of riots followed, and editorials in the New York Times were very critical of the plan. Over 200 Jewish school children were thrown in jail. The whole political structure of New York that had tried this scheme were then thrown out of office during the next election.-A book describing this scenerio, The Great School Wars, was written by Diane Ravitch on the subject. Curiously, William Wirt was committed to an insane asylum around 1930, after going around making public speeches about his part in a large conspiracy to bring about a controlled state in the hands of certain people. He died two years later. In order to make sure that the independence of the one-room schoolhouse and the penchant for communities to hire their own independent teachers would cease, the Carnegie group instituted the concept of \"teacher certification\" - a process controlled by the teaching colleges under ~arnegie and Rockefeller control. No one knew that the Communist revolutions were fbnded from the United States. The buildup of the Soviet Union, as well as that of Nazi Germany, would also be fbnded later from the United States in order to get a reactionary public to bend to the will of controlling political factions. It was a plan that worked well in the 1920's, and worked well again in the 1950's in the p,sychological creation of the \"cold war\", providing fbndiig for the buildup of the military, industrial and pharmaceutical complex. The \"non-thinking\" American public never suspected a thing. Such a thing would have been \"unbelievable.\""},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Because the United States was owned by wealthy businessmen, a synthetic fiee enterprise system was created and anti-trust laws were passed to prevent anyone else fiom gaining power. Everything that had already been consolidated was \"grandfathered out of the law. It was a brilliant scheme, and it worked very well. Earlier in the century there were \"school boards\" in every town. Between 1932 and 1960, the number of school boards dropped from 140,000 to 30,000. Today there are about 15,000 - all controlled by extensions of the Carnegie-Rockefeller educational complex. In 1959, with the advent of the \"sputnik\" and the public realization that \"another country was ahead of us\", the embarassed educational system was forced to temporarily create a ~ynthetic focus on science which produced a generation of scientists and technicians in order to resolve the apparent decifit in the public mind.' In retrospect, in 1889 the U.S. Commissioner of Education assured a prominent railroad man, Collis Huntington, when he protested that the schools seemed to be over- educating (producing too many engineers and people who could think), that schools had been scientykally designed not to over-educate. It was a reference to the German system of education inculcated into the United States between 1806 and 18 19. A short period of space exploration followed, culiminating in a moon landing, and then the public show was generally scaled back to just above oblivion.

The immediate reduction of world population, according to the mid-1970's recommendation of the Draper Fund, must be immediately afFected. c. The present vast overpopulation, now far beyond the world carrying capacity, cannot be answered by hre reductions in the birth rate due to contraception, sterilization and abortion, but must be met in the present by the reduction of numbers presently existing. This must be done by whatever means necessary. d. The issue is falsely debated between a political and a cultural approach to population and resources, when in fact, faced with stubborn obstruction and day-to-day political expediency which make most of the leaders of the most populous poor countries unreliable, the issue is compulsory cooperation. - e. Compulsory cooperation is not debatable with 166 nations, most of whose leaders are irresolute, conditioned by localist 'kultures,\" and lacking appropriate notions of the New World Order. Debate means delay arid forfeiture of our goals and purpose. ' Historical research revealed that the Cobden Club is an organization created by British Intelligence member Louis Mallet, grandson of Jacques Mallet Du Pan, which still persists today. The Cobden Club led the fight to overturn Abraham Lincoln's economic program in the late 19th century. Louis Mallet's son Bernard Mallet was the private secretary of Britain's Lord Balfour, and became the president of the British Eugenics organization. .Bernard Mallet was the honored guest at Averell Harriman's race science celebration at the me& Museum of Natural History in 1932, just before Hitler's Nazis took over Germany. The Mallets were one of two oligarchical families which held hereditary seats in the Council of 200 ruling Geneva, Switzerland. The Brother of Theologian Allen M. Dulles, Petit Dulles, married into the Mallet family marrying Julia Mallet-Prevost. The activities of Averell Harriman during the Nazi period between the 1920's and 1930s are stored in a warehouse in Brooklyn and, according to former defense secretary Clark Clifford, whose law firm represented Harriman, those papers and the papers of the Dulles Brothers are barred and sealed for all eternity from public viewing.

Messrs. Chamberlain and Daladier, heads of the governments of England and France, calmly offered the Brazilian Amazon to the Fuehrer.\" Hitler reportedly observed that since the Amazon was in South American, the United States would cite the Monroe Doctrine and reject a German occupation of Brazilian territory. Chamberlain and Daladier responded that the proposal had Washington's backing. * The U.N.

Capitals and italics are ours. After a review of the 'benefits\" that a wartime footing provided for American society, the cornmitee discussed 'Substitutes for War\" that would presumably provide similar benefits to the military/industrial/chemical/pharmaceutical (MICP) complex, which in turn projected its 'heeds\" as those of society. The proposed 'kubstitutes\" would be phased in as other factors were phased out. Economic Surro~ates for War (ESW) According to the commitee, Economic Surrogates for War must meet two primary criteria: (1) Surrogates .must be wasteful, in the common sense of the word, and the magnitude of the waste must be sufficient to 'heet the needs of a particular society\" and destroy a minimum of 10% of the Gross National Product and (2) Surrogates must operate outside the normal supply-demand system. In essence, all surrogates must be things that the MlCP complex can gradually phase in as other operations are phased out. The ESW were mainly seen in terms of general social welfare programs, and they were listed as: Health Drastic expansion of medical research, education and training facilities, hospital and clinic construction, and the general objective of Complete government-guaranteed health care for all\". Education The equivalent of the foregoing in teacher training, schools and libraries, the drastic upgrading of standards, with the objective of making a professional degree available to all.

Poverty The genuine elimination of poverty, defined by a standard consistent with current economic productivity, by means of a guaranteed annual incopme or whatever system of distribution will best assure its achievement. Now, the ESW mentioned above were obiected to by the cornmitee primarily because 'Bs an economic substitute for war, it is inadequate because it would be far too cheap.\" In fact, they insisted that 'the maximum program that could be physically effected along the lines indicated could approach the established levels of military spending only for a limited time - less than ten years.\" According the the report, 'the social welfare programs as a substitute for war would be self-liquidating': despite the application of 'tubitrary controls\".

They may or may not serve their ostensible postmilitary purpose of settling international disputes.\" Furthermore, 'h well-armed international police force, operating under the authority of such a supranational 'court', could well serve the fimction of external enemy.\" But, 'this would constitute a military operation inconsistent with the premise of an end to the war system,\" and 'the obvious destabilizing effect of any global social welfare surrogate on politically necessary class relationships would create an entirely new set of transition problems at least equal in magnitude.\" The report hher notes that \"credibility, in fact, lies at the heart of the problem of developing a political substitute for war. An effective political substitute for war would require 'alternate enemies'.\" Environmental Pollution 'It may be that gross pollution of the environment can eventually replace the possibility of mass destruction by nuclear weapons as the principle apparent threat to the survival of the species.

The problem of timing the transition to a new ecological balancing makes the feasibility of substitution less certain. It must be remembered that the limitation of war in this function is entirely eugenic. As a system of gross population control to preserve the species it cannot be faulted. Current trends in warfare - the increased bombing of civilians - suggests that improvement is in the making.\" 'There is no question but that a universal requirement that procreation be limited to the products of artificial insemination would provide a fully adequate substitute control for population levels. Such a reproductive system would have the added advantage of being susceptible of direct eugenic management. It's predictable further development - conception and embryonic growth taking place under laboratory conditions - would extend these controls to their logical conclusion. The ecological functions of war under these circumstances would not only be superceded but surpassed in effectiveness.\" 'The indicated intermediate step - total control of conception with a variant of the bill' via water sup~lies or certain essential fooaktuffs, oqfet bv a controlled 'antidote' - IS ALREADY mDER DEP7ZOPMENT.\" 'Since the eugenic solution cannot be acheived until the transition to the peace system takes place, why not wait?

The article examines geneticist Leroy Hood, who has a Ph-D in Immunology from Calforinia Institute of Technology and an M.D. from Johns Hopkins University. As a high school student, Hood was so advanced that he ended by teaching his biology class. After getting his doctorate from Caltech in the 1970's, he launched into the field of genetics. Dr. Leroy Hood was the first to use gene therapy on mice, injecting DNA from healthy mice into mouse eggs from mice with a degenerative nervous system problem reflecting inability to manufacture myelin protein. Not only was the new, corrected gene passed on to the offspring of the cured mice, it was also passed on to subsequent offspring. In 1981, Hood helped found Applied Biosystems in Foster City, California. In 1983, Applied Biosystems merged with Perkin-Elmer, who produces biomedical instrumentation systems, including the new Model 373 DNA Sequencer, essential to research conducted by the Institute for Genomic Research, who has cwrently sequenced parts of 85% of human genes. Now, the work Hood did with the mice was thefirst case of reversing a genetic defect through the intentional manipulation of damaged genetic material. According to Barbara Koenig, who directs Stanford University's Center for Biomedical Ethics, \"scientists lik Hood have been 'almost lionized* by the public, even when their 'biologized' understandmg of individuals is limit in^ and reductive.\" The article makes the point that \"it's bad enough that our own DNA should be tampered with. How much worse will be be when the proposed alterations will be made not only to the somatic cells, exclusive of the gonads, but to the gem-line cells, any changes to which would be passed on to descendents. Those prospects raise not only the nightmarish specter of euaenics, but fears about weakening the human organism altogether by narrowing the gene pool.\" According to Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, \"monoculturing, narrowing the gene pool, leaves species less able to survive in changing environmentts and thus more vulnerable. Whenever you eliminate anything in an organism, you disrupt something else.\" Rifkin, with physicist Daniel Levles, wrote me Code of Codes in 1992, on the implications of the human genome project. As far as Dr. Leroy Hood is concerned, \"over the next 25 years, we'll have identified over 100 genes that predispose people to 'the most common diseases': cardiovascular, cancerous, metabolic, immunologic.\" [Ed. Note that of these areas, as shown in this work, are all caused by external environmental factors ignored by Neo-Darwinism;this fact is SLIDD~~SS~~ by the push to genetically mod13 the human population]. Hood continues, \"we'll be able to do a DNA fingerprint on each individual: the computer will read out your potential &re health history, and we'll have preventive measures that will let us intervene whenever there's aprobability, that you'll get one of these disease- multiple sclerosis [real possible cause: mercury amalgam'J, rheumatoid arthritis [relationship to vaccination and fluoridation programs], cardiovascular disease [actual relationship to nutrition and diet], or whatever.\" Hood continues, \" your entire genome would be read out, faulty penes - found, and then 'corrected* by one or another type of gene 'therapy'.\""},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO I What has this got to do with Microsoft?

Pre- dictably, Third World populations have borne the brunt of new drug experimentation and resulting population control policies. Experimental contraceptives were sponsored by SEAT0 in Bangladesh. Women in Puerto Rico and Mexico were used to test contraceptives without their consent. Depo-Provera was used ex- perimentally on 8000 women in San Pablo. Mexico; 120.000 in Sri Lanka; and 250.000 in Bangladesh. Policies of sterilization of native people have been pur- sued throughout the world. Since 1960 US AID has been a major funder of Third World population control, providing half of the money for internationally funded birth control programs and family planning services, including the Pill, IUD, and sterilization. BIRTH CONTROL (BC) PILLS - The physiological effects produced by oral contracep tives resemble changes that occur during pregnancy. As in pregnancy. hormones alter not only the reproduc- tive system but also many other body functions as well. Thus a simulated pregnancy which continues for more ' than 9 months extends long-term physiological risks beyond the normal duration of pregnancy. The risk of dying from blood clots is 7 times greater for women on Birth Control pills. Women over 30 are especially prone to this complication. In the Third World, the combination of long-term pill use into later life and the rise of cigarette smoking among women will predispose large numbers of women to severe clot- ting disorders. Clotting may result ir. strokes, blindness, heart attacks, and pulmonary embolism. People who have experienced even mild clotting tendencies prior to BC pill use should avoid the drug altogether. In order to determine a patient's medical history. a close question- ing and physical examination by qualified health per- sonnel is required. It is unlikely !hat all Third World women receive this individualized, time consuming screening. Blood pressure elevations into the abnormal range occur in more than 5 percent of pill users and some in- crease is fmnd in the majority of women. Hypertension associated with BC pill use carries the same well established mortality as high blood pressure from any cause. Blood pressure should always be checked two months after BC pill use is started. When elevations oc- cur. the contraceptives should be contra-indicated. In reality. BC pills are dispensed without any provision for blood pressure monitoring. Many other problems are associated with BC pills. There is a doubling of the risk of gall bladder disease. which is already high in women of childbearing age and can be a fatal disorder in areas where sterile surgical conditions are not always available. A former- ly rare liver cancer is found much more frequently in BC pill-users. The risk of contraction increases with higher estrogen pill-use, long duration of use, and older age of the user: precisely the setting for pill use in much of the Third World. BC pills also cause an increase in blood sugar in up to 25 percent of users, who develop criteria for diabetes. BC pills should never be given to women with breast cancer. Rates of this disease are not known in the Third World. but in the US about 1 in 20 women develop breast cancer at some point in their life. In areas where periodic medical care or patient education are not available. this disease could easily be overlooked. Many women fail to resume menstruation promptly after pills are stopped. For some it may take months or years to become fertile, while others are permanently sterile. Predisposition factors include low body weight. late- onset of menstruation, and irregular bleeding before BC pill use - cmllitions which are quite com- mon among Third World women. BC pills also deplete the body of vitamin Be and folate. Usual dietary sources for these vitamins cannot compensate for these losses, so that some doctors in the US recommend routine supplementation. Given marginal Third World diets, severe deficiency could result, producing anemia and seizures. Erratic use of BC pills has the paradoxical effect of in- creasing fertility. When women are not properly in- formed about this consequence not only is pregnancy more likely to result, it is less likely to be suspected. Continued exposure of the fetus to BC pills results in a higher incidence of cardiovascular and other birth defects. BC pills should not be used after delivery because they inhibit the quantity of breast milk produced and decrease its content of protein, fat, sodium. calcium, potassium, and magnesium. This effect is greater with the higher dose pills used in LDCs. Although it is now well established that breast milk is the preferred source of infant nutrition. family planning programs providing BC pills to lactating mothers necessitate a dependence on supplemental formula feedings which may be dangerous to infants. BC pills also are considered ill advised for women with undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding and sickle cell disease, conditions which again are prevalent in the Third World. Moreover. use of BC pills in conibina- tion with such common medications as ampicillin, some major anti-TB medicines, and many antiseizure drugs, may lead to bleeding or pregnancy. As more experience is gained about the hazards of these drugs, especially in their most potent forms, it has become clear that their use should be limited to cases with minimum risk, not as population-wide methods. Thus BC pills may be appropriate for closely supervised individual cases. but unsupervised mass distribution campaigns may be extremely dangerous to women and children. The National Tima.

In laboratory tests it caused cervical cancer in monkeys and breast cancer in beagle dogs. It is thought to cause irregular menstrual disturbances, long-term or permanent sterility, a reduction in the body's resistance to infection. and progressive weight gain. In addition. DepProvera may be harmful to the children of nurs- ing mothers who are given the shots, and may interfere with immunoglobulins in human milk as well. \"Side ef- fects may include congenital heart defects, abnormal development of the penis or vagina, and the possibility of genital cancers later in life\" [Minkin. Mother Jones (MDVI(IX):3536]. Depo-Provera must be given to millions of women over the course of decades before its carcenogenic eflects can be judged. Dr. Malcolm Pons. Director Intsrnrtional Fertility R-rcb fbgrarn According to Upjohn. DepProvera has been given to 10 million women and accounts for one percent of the company's annual sales. From 1971-76. Upjohn ad- mitted spending $4 million to secure contracts for the sale of its drugs in 29 Third World countries; the sale of Depo-Provera increased dramatically. Today, however. the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) and the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) are the two largest buyers of the drug. The US has been the major source of funds for both programs. While the US, due to FDA regulations. cannot buy Depo-Provera as a birth control device and send it abroad. US AID can support the IPPF in London. which in turn buys the drug from Upjohn's subidiary in Belgium. Yet, when confronted with the reality of US funds being spent on Depo-Provera. AID officials claim that they cannot dictate how the IPPF should spend its funds. In 1979. AID. through the IPPF, supplied Depo- Provera to 378.000 women in Mexico. Sri Lanka. and Bangladesh in experimental research projects. AID directed the UNFPA to purchase 600.000 doses for Ban- gladesh and 1 million for Thailand. Now. AID is reportedly set to support the widespread distribution of Depo-Provera to developing countries. Dr. Malcolm Potts, medical director of the IPPF (1969-78) and now director of the International Fertility Research Program, spearheads the \"Depo-Provera for the masses\" campaign. He insists that the drug must be given to millions of women over the course of decades before its carcinogenic effects can be judged. \"We are not going to know whether Depo-Rovera is safe.\" he ekplains. \"until a large number of women use it for a very long time. . . You cannot prove a drug is safe until you use it\" [MJ-VI(IX):37]. The agencies conducting these population control programs assert that the women who receive DepctPro- Vera do so of their own free will. When there is no con- sensus of opinion among the experts and when little ac- companying information is passed on to women in these programs, it is difficult to believe that the women truly understand the possible immediate and long-term consequences of the drug. DEPO-PROVERA IN SOUTH AFRICA AND ZIMBABWE In South Africa, where white demographers are in- creasingly concerned about the accelerating black birth rate, DepProvera is being forcably administered to black women by government-funded family planning agencies. Dr. Nthato Motlana, one of South Africa's leading Black physicians, charges that \"there is no such thing as 'informed consent' he&. The agencies are adminis- tering Depo-Provera shots to young black girls without even asking their consent.\" Until very recently a similar practice existed in Zim- babwe. Under white rule. Depo-Provera was the most widely used contraceptive among Black women. To- day, some 100.000 women continue to be injected. Prime Minister Mugabe's government. however, has decided to phase out DepProvera use within two years, as it considers the drug unsafe. This decision has caused the resignation of the white director of Zimbab we's Family Planning Association. D DEPO-PROVERA AND AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES Depo-hovera is currently being given to Aboriginal women in Western Australia through the Aborininal Medical Service and the Health and-~edical ~e&ces Department's Community and Child Health Section. These agencies are responsible for the health services for most of the approximately 50.000 Aborigines in the state. In the white Australian community. where the dangers of DepProvera are better known, it is rarely used; however. more than 20 Aboriginal women who had been given injections told a reporter that they had no idea of the potential risks. The fact that Aboriginal women have a genetic'tendency to develop diabetes on modern diets poses an additional hazard in their using DepProvera: research has shown that DepProvrtra poses special hazards for diabetics and pre-diabetics. The Aboriginal Medical Senrice claims to have used DepProvera for 7 years on an average of four to five women per month. The Western Australia Family Plan- ning Association claims to use DepctProvera on \"men- tdy retarded women and those who forget to take the pill.\" These agencies can easily obtain as much Depo- Provera as they want from the State Health Depart- ment. Forty-two percent of the inmates at Nyandi, the Western Australia maximum security unit for teenage girls, are Aborigines. Depo-Provera is used routinely there on girls judged \"promiscuous\" or mentally retarded. But why is birth control necessary in a unisex. maximum security facility? Is DepctProvera be ing used instead as a tranquilizer? Indications are that the drug is being misused. 0"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO At an IPPF-sponsored clinic in Thailand. 60.000 women received injections.

Recent studies. including a confidential WHO report, have shown that there is a marked increase of breast and ce~cal cancer among young women in Thailand, particularly at Chiang Mai, where Depo-Rovera is or has been used by 56 percent of the women. Complica- tions can take 30 years to develop, either in the women or their children. But. as Depo-Provera has generally been used in areas where follow-up is difficult, these complications have been ignored. In one Thai camp individuals were given bounties for each woman they brought in for Depo-Provera injections. In many Thai refugee camps. according to ICRC per- sonnel. Cambodian women, often members of hi tribes. are required by the authorities to have an injec- tion before they marry. A member of the delegation of the ICRC in Thailand claims that 59 percent of the women who received *Provers had no idea what the shot was for, and only 15 percent were asked beforehand if they were pregnant. In one camp, a volunteer reports. individuals were given bounties for each woman they brought in for injections. Often young boys were slipped through program. and women were processed more than once. When questioned about the possible negative effects of Depo-Provera on refugee women. Thai authorities say that they have been using it for years and see no reason why refugee women should be treated differently than Thai women. It is commonly accepted that Depo-Provera belohgs to the class of drugs which can cause birth defects as well as serious medical problems for women. However. the drug is often given to pregnant women. and Upjohn even promotes it for nursing mothers. The effects of DepProMra can be insidious. In Thailand researchers found that nearly 15 percent of the lactating mothers receiviag injections had a reduc- ed milk supply. If we consider that DepRovera is often given to the poorest group in most countries. those already nutritionally at risk, the implications of such findings are grave indeed. Nor do the social effects stop there. In Bangladesh, after 1 year of use, 60 percent of DepProvera users ex- perienced side effects described in The Lancef as \"menstrual chaos.\" Abnormal bleeding is a potential health problem and this is significant in cultures where women are excluded from important areas of social life , as long as they show signs of menstrual bleeding. STERILIZATION As with other forms of population control. the poor. those politically less powerful, such as those from ethnic minorities or tribal groups, are often considered the prime sources of unwanted population growth. In fact, they may simply be the easiest or most expedient populations to control. Statistics on sterilization are dif- ficult to find and even harder to confirm. In the mid-1970s the President of United Native Americans estimated that of the total US Indian population of 800.000 as many as 42 percent of the women of childbearing age and 10 percent of the men were steriliied. Another spokesman believes that there are only 100,000 American Indian women of childbear- ing age still able to have children. One of four US Indian children will not be raised by its parents. Only one of ten adopted or foster Indian children is raised by Indian parents. Other sources estimate that as many as 32 percent of all Black women in the US are sterilized by the age of 30. In the US most women are sterilized iust after giving birth. They consent while heavily sedated. They are not given the 72 hours, required by US law, between con- sent and the operation. The Committee to End Sterilization Abuse reports that Peace Corps programs sterilized Quechua women in Bolivia without their knowledge or consent. From 1963-65 a Rockefeller Foundation grant funded the sterilization of 40.000 Colombian women. US AID funds indirectly supported the sterilization of a million Brazilian women between 1965 and 1971. Today, sterilization programs are underway in Manaus, Brazil. WHO is using a birth control substance lasting 3-5 years on women in Thailand although there hove been no long-term animal studies of its effects. SILASTIC IMPLANTATION - This birth control device is a solid, timerelease substance that is injected under the skin through a large hypodermic needle. The implant. a timereleased syn- thetic progesterone, can make a woman infertile for periods of from three to five years. There have teen no long-term animal studies of this substance. In 1960. WHO began to experiment with the drug on women in Chiang Mai Province. Thaiiand, O DALCON SHIELDS ' In 1974, after reportedly causing the deaths of 17 women. this intrauterine birth contro! device (IUD) was banned in the US. In the US these IUD's have led to serious uterine infections in more than 200.000 women. The overseas sales of the product increased in 1972. Before 1974 the manufacturer offered US AID'S Office of Population a 48 percent discount on this IUD to be used overseas in official AIBsponsored population control programs. The company's bulk rate wai due to the bulk packaging of the unsterilized devices (the Lip - pes Loop was also supplied by US AID in unsterilized form). Furthermore. only one set of instructions (in . French. Spanish, and English) was given per 1000 shields, although they ended up in at least 42 countries on five continents. Only one inserter per 10 shields was supplied. By 1974 criticism within the US was so severe that AID issued an international recall. An AID official admitted that half of the nearly 700.000 shields distributed were not recovered. D"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO DRUG EXPERIMENTATION SHIFTS OVERSEAS Over the last twenty years, much of the medical ex- perimentation once done in the US has been shifted abroad. The reasons for this shift are numerous - public concern in the US has led to tighter regulations, the value of the dollar has declined. favorable tax and other economic incentives, including government sup port. have lured research and development (R&D) in- vestments overseas, and many drugs are developed which will never be used in the US. NEW REGULATIONS Between 1959 and 1966, there. was a significant decrease in drug innovations in the US. Triggered by the public's response to the thalidomide tragedy, amendments to the Food and Drug Act were finally enacted in 1962 which required proof of the efficacy and safety of new drugs based on tests involving human subjects (Phase 1 testing). Some analysts believe that these amendments reduced by half the number of new chemical entities introduced annually, despite a fivefold increase in pharmaceutical R&D spending dur- ing that period. New Single Chemicals Produced in the US. 195466 1959-63 1963-18 1960-45 1964-17 196141 196523 1962-28 1966-13 After 1962, it became increasingly expensive to test drugs domestically. Thus. US firms began to spend more money on foreign R&D. In the 1970s, budgets for such spending nearly doubled while domestic R&D spending leveled off. According to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA). US drug companies spent 8.7 percent of their 1970 R&D budget in foreign countries: in 1978 the figure had climbed to 16.8 pet- cent. From 1974 to 1975 alone. the dollar amounts of foreign R&D budgets of US drug companies nearly doubled. Concommitant with the 1962 amendments to the Food and Drug Act was the concentration research still undertaken within the US on an inexpensive, captive population, namely, prison inmates. By 1975, from 80 to 90 percent of Phase 1 testing in the US was con- ducted on prisoners. the remaining 10 to 20 percent on students and the ill. Four years later. following increas- ed public awareness, no more than 15 percent of all new drugs were tested on US prison populations: a 1980 article in Food, Drug. and Cosmetic Low Journal [35(9):511,521] stated that \"Phase 1 studies are hardly ever done with prison subjects anymore.\" The prison programs declined in part as a result of prodding from the federal government Furthermore, many state legislatures had banned prison research years before, and in other states prison officials had adopted regulations forbidding it. Adverse publicity made prison research politically untenable. Also, the American Correctional Association had established a ban on medical research as one of the standards that in- stitutions must meet to receive ACA accreditation. It is believed that all federal agencies ceased doing prison medical research in 1976, when an inmate suit brought by the National Prison Roject of the ACLU led to the cessation of research on tropical disease at the Maryland House of Correction. During the ten years or so prior to these suits, many drug companies ter- minated prison research to avoid bad publicity, even though they had not been directly accused of wrong- doing. As pressure was broughi to end Phase 1 testing in prisons, pharmaceutical companies were already look- ing abroad for human subjects. Phase 1 testing in developing countries was in progress at an early stage. as prison populations in the US were still more expen- sive than alternative populations. For example, a move to Canada can result in significant savings in testing costs. Other nations impose fewer restrictions on testing although apparently none permit the use of prisoners in Phase 1. non-therapeutic testing. In 1973.. for the first time more initial human studies of new chemicals occurred outside the US than within. Many of these tests were conducted with patients and volunteers. The prospect of quick clinical trials was one factor that lured many firms into overseas research. The United Kingdom, for example, has no federal regulations covering studies on normal subjects. The shift to ovexseas experimentation was increased when in 1973 a regulation was proposed. and passed in 1975. which allowed some results from studies in foreign countries to be accepted by the FDA. From 1974 to 1975. R&D budgets of US drug companies abroad near- ly doubled. \"Currently there is virtually no available data on the amount of R&D money targeted for Phase I testing abroad.\" Thus a relativelv clear picture emerges - sinnificant- ly increased pharmaceu&al R&D speiding onan inter- national scale but substantially reduced numbers of new drugs reaching the market. At the same time. the participation of prisoners in Phase 1 testing dropped drastically. Increasingly, alternative populations have been employed, especially citizens of developing coun- tries. DRUG EXPERIMENTATION ABROAD There is greater latitude for pharmaceutical research on human subjects in most other countries than in the US. The cost of volunteers in underdeveloped countries may be competitive with the expenses incurred in con- ducting research on prisoners in the US. Certainly the cost is less than hiring nonprison volunteers' in this country, In many countries greater secrecy is possible - both with regard to trade secrets and.to possible errors or abuses in the research process. Public pressure, which for lack of access to information failed to address the problems of prison research in the US until the early 1970s. is even less likely to be an effective force where distance, national boundaries, and the veils of foreign affairs and perhaps even of national security work together as barriers to public scrutiny. Currently there is virtually no available data on the amount of WD money targeted for Phase 1 testing abroad."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO --- Public scrutiny of experimental programs, whether in prisons or in foreign coutries, is a necessity, for it pro- vides an element of control that is not otherwise available. That such scrutiny is essential is a lesson clearly taught by the experience with prison research in the US. The history and impact of secrecy with regard to prison testing within the US has involved not only the industry. but the regulatory agency intended to monitor the pharmaceutical experimenting, manufac- turing. and markg)ing processes. According to an FDA official, Phase I testing abroad identifies \"bad human results\" of a given drug. . . .Only one in ten drugs tested abroad is ever submitted to the USFDA in a New Drug Application. The responsibility for safeguarding human subjects cannot rest with the researchers. Since legal sanctions against testing vary. some American scientists have taken their research projects abroad to escape stringent US restrictions. Once a research project involving human subjects has been located outside the US. it is the responsibility of the foreign government to ensure that protective policies, including the requirement of informed consent, are met. The tenuous chain of responsibility and accountability from testing site back to the pharmaceutical manufacturers makes it unlikely that US companies can be required to assure proper. noncoercive procedures for the informed consent of human subjects in foreign countries. Abuses can be disavowed. Although the FDA is still reluctant to accept data from foreign Phase 1 testing, the data can be used to support safety and efficacy investigations conducted in the US. In particular, preliminary investigations on human subjects in foreign countries can determine whether a chemical offers sufficient potential for profit and therapy to merit recognized Phase 1 testing. Accor- ding to an FDA official, such initial studies could serve the purpose of identifying at an early state any \"bad human.results\" of a given drug, thereby avoiding fur- ther problems without the risk of media coverage and litigation encountered in the US. Only one in ten drugs tested abroad is ever submitted to the US FDA in a New Drug Application. 'INTERNATIONAL CODE OF ETHICS Among the international statements of ethics regar- ding medical research on human subjects are the Nur- emberg Code of Ethics in Medical Research and the Declaration of Helsinki. The Nuremberg Code includes a clear requirement of consent in human experimenta- tion. The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that \"the person involved should have the legal capacity to give consent lad ahodd ba so situated as to be able to exercise frw wer of choice. without the in- tervention of ray dement of%rce. fraud. deceit. duress, over- reaching or other ultimate form of coastmint or coercion\" (Note 43. 1). Yet for example researchers have found that most pa- tients receiving ex~rimental cancer dru~s in the US to- day \"know little about the drugs they are given and understand even less about the risks of serious side ef- fects\" (The Boston Globe, 20 October 1981). The Declaration of Helsinki, based on the Nuremberg Code, was adopted by the World Medical Association in 1964. On the issue of coercion the Declaration pre vides that \"the subject of clinical research should be in such a mental. physical, and legal state as to be able to exercise fully his power of choice\" (Note 44, 111-3-G). An additional clause regarding prisoners who \"being captive groups should not be used as subjects of ex- periments\" was deleted, liirgely because of opposition from the American medical community. Given the trend to transfer R&D to foreign countries. the question must be asked where public pressure will originate and how public scrutiny can be assured so that the principles articulated in the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki will actually protect human research subjects from coerced. or uninformed, consent to experimental procedures. In 1976 the National Commission noted that pm hibiting research on prisoners in the US might deflect drug research overseas, but that this would only be a relative increase over a considerable amount which was already being conducted abroad. The question was then raised whether it would be ethical to shift risks to subjects in other countries when the benefits would be distributed in the US. Would we not, asked the Com- mission, be taking advantage of people living in the economically depressed countries? This issue can no longer be consigned to the realm of conjecture, for it is the current reality. Just as prisoners in the US opted for sickness as participants in biomedical experiments in order to achieve a slightly healthier level of day-to-day survival. so, too. will Third World residents become the human subjects of pharmaceutical research. \". . .if drugs are to be tested in other countries, they should be related to diseases in those countries.\" The potential for abuses on an international scale is staggering and requires an international response. The creation of an international review board might be one way to pierce the shrouds of secrecy behind which abuse can thrive. There should be steps taken to ensure noncoerced consent by all volunteers. Projects design- ed to directly benefit the participant population should be developed. For example, if drugs are to be tested in other countries, they should be related to diseases in those countries. Does coerced participation only damage the in- dividual, or does it assist the survival of the group, of which he or she is a member? It is most appropriate for this judgment to be expressed by inmates at the Mary- land House of Correction: \"There is no moral way to justify forcing people, already without the minimum necessities to live decently in this country, to bear this added burden.\" This same concern must be extended to include the populations of the world. 0 Condensed from a paper by Andrew Stewart Franklin Pierce Law Center"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO MEDICINAL DRUGS IN THE THIRD WORLD The most frequently used remedies for health prob- lems in the Third World are drugs and vaccines. Evans, Hall, and Warford, in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) [305(19):1120], write. \"In looking to the future. . . [health] problems may [result from the] ex- cessive and irrational use of drugs.. .\" The phar- maceuticals industry is a big foreign exchange earner for developed countries. Developing countries, where 70 percent of the world's population live, produce only 7 percent of the drugs they consume. The average expenditures on drugs is from 40 to 60 percent of total health care expenditures. From 1965 to 1976, international commerce in pharmaceuticals in- creased from $1.2 billion to $4.5 billion. Today it is in the tens of billions. In Latin America. drug sales amount to more than $1.5 billion annually, and are doubling every five years. Twenty multinational firms dominate the entire Latin American market, and in Brazil and Colombia control 88 percent of it. About half of all deaths in Third World countries are of children less than five years of age. Diarrhea. respiratory infections, and infectious diseases (e.g.. dip theria, measles. and whooping cough) are the major causes of death. These ailments can be effectively con- trolled by inexpensive measures used in developed countries [NE JM 3OS(l9): 11 171. Instead, the budgets of many Third World countries go to the purchase of ex- pensive drugs often of dubious utility for the majority of the people. Dr. Milton Silverman, pharmacologist (U-Cal) and author of Prescription for Death, says The pharmaceutical industry has done hr more ood than harm. . . But it is not perfect; and the pncticcr that 1$ave been worrying about. . . are no trifling problem. It concerns hun- dreds of thousands of people a year in the Third World. and it is a blemish on an industry which is grossing ules in the tens of billions of dollus a yw (Richter. Pcstidda and Pi: For Expod Only. 1981:4-53. Multinational firms have taken advantage of the in- creasing concern for health care in developing coun- tries. Firms have admitted to spending millions of dollars in promotion and \"gifts\" to secure contracts with government health services. Once companies have secured contracts they sell drugs that are banned or restricted in other countries, and dump drugs on Third World markets whose expiration dates are near. In Tan- zania, for example, a British doctor found a 45-year supply of a Hoechst antibiotic that has a shelf life of 2 years under ideal conditions and probably only 6 months in the tropics. In addition. companies mark up the price of their product many times its cost; mark-ups in Colombia have been reported as high as 6000 per- cent. Multinationals promote their products not only to governments but also to individual purchasers. In Colombia there is a drug promoter for each doctor; in Brazil there is one for every three doctors. In an attempt to increase sales, pharmaceutical com- panies change the maximum recommended dosage of drugs whenever possible. Wellcome, for example, sells its migraine drug Migril with a maximum of 10 mglwk in the US. 12 mglwk in the UK. and 24 mglwk in Africa and Asia. Glaxo's combination antibiotic, Gueanimycin Suspension Forte, has a maximum dosage twice as high in LDC's as it has in the UK. Moreover, drug companies frequently understate a drug's side effects and in many instances misrepresent a drug's efficacy. For example. Glaxo's version of Meclizine (Bonine), Ancoloxin, was sold in Malaysia in 1979 for control of morning sickness although research has caused the US FDA to recommend it not be used for pregnant women. In the US. Bonine is recommended for motion sickness; perhaps Malaysian authorities simply misread the in- dications. In addition to restricted drugs, birth control devices and medical equipment (such as X-ray machines) banned or severely restricted in the US are often ship ped abroad. The US Food. Drug. and Cosmetic Act of 1938, which does not allow the exportation of drugs that are banned in the US, is easily circumvented. Because these regulations do not apply to drugs pro- duced by foreign subsidiaries, developing countries can still provide convenient markets for products that could not be exported directly from the US. Investment by US pharmaceutical firms in other countries increased in the 1970s -precisely when more drugs were banned in the US. (See also Drug Experimentation Shifts Overseas.) It was at this time that the international traf- ficking in drugs began to expand dramatically. Tracking foreign investments by US drug firms is rather like a shell game: now you see it, now you don't - but mainly you don't. European firms, unen- cumbered by legislation. are, by and large, free to ex- port unapproved drugs manufactured domestically, and in effect can ship abroad any substance that they can sell. Furthermore, some substances, such as an- tibiotics, which are not officially classified as drugs, can be banned in the US and still sold abroad. (In Mex- ico. for example. 2178 brands of antibiotics are sold. in- cluding 144 brands of ampicillin and 196 of tetracyc- line, both of which are available only by prescription in the US.) Evans. Hall. and Warford (NEJM 305(19):1121-22) write, The im rtance of drugs to the quality of health care. to the crdibfiy of community health workers. to the dewlo ment of iatrogenic disease (for example from toxid or antibotic- rasirturt microorl(misms) md to the cost ofXdth services makes it imperative that developing countries establish better mechanisms for assessing drug requirements md for purchar- ing. quality contml. storage. and distribution of drugs. Ex- perience in Tanzania and Ghana indicates that savings up to 2 rt ofthe budget for pharmaceuticals could ba achiev- y promotang ~eneric alternatwes and introduction of con- trols .gunst overproduction. Yet, Third World countries will not or cannot police all the imports. A 1976 Ford Foundation study found that 36 countries did not require drug registration before marketing began; 61 others (including Brazil) in- sisted only that the drug be licensed and sold in the ex- porting country. Even tightly restricted drugs are licensed and sold. Pharmaceutical companies can im- port drugs banned in the US into these 64 countries simply by routing them through countries which re- quire no registration. For example. Guatemala, which has few restrictions, \"exports\" drugs to Brazil that are banned for use in countries where they were manufac- tured. Officials in some countries are willing to accept the health risks that certain drugs represent. Ghanan of- ficials, for example. see the country's population explo- sion as potentially more dangerous than the risks of birth control pills with high estrogen levels. Given that"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Medicine sold in the public market - Isiro. northeastern Zwre O Edward Tronick. AnthrePhoto population control is necessary. what needs to be measured is the relative health costs of each available form of birth control. Yet, politicians and planners decide on the national choice of contraceptive methods, whose short-term ef- fects may be dangerous and whose long-term effec:s re- main unknown. Such decisions have their greatest im- pact on the poor who. in much of the Third World. are ethnically distinct from the ruling elite. Thus this type of population control can be seen as another example of a dominant ethnic group strengthening its control over other groups. The research efforts of the pharmaceutical com- panies are geared to the needs of the industrialized countries. In some of the more advanced Third World countries. such as Mexico and Argentina. less than one percent of drug companies' sales are spent on research. Under these circumstances. the Third World receives technology that. even when useful, does not fully meet its needs. For example. although millions suffer from Chagas disease. schistosomiasis. trypanosomiasis, and onchocerciasis, little money or effort is spent to find cures. There is little incentive on the part of drug com- panies to develop new therapies when people are will- ing to pay. often the equivalent of a family's weekly food bill, for useless or multiple courses of inap propriate medicines. To date. attempts to confront and change the interna- tional drug trade system have been ineffective. Some countries have attempted to counter the high cost of im- ported medicines, the dumping of thousands of brands. and the inappropriateness of imported medicines for local ailments by nationalizing the pharmaceuticals in- dustry. India is a case in point. There, however. serious problems have arisen. There is little quality control - some formulations containing only one percent of the ingredient they are supposed to contain. others have none. Some contain higher proportions than the for- mulation is to have. Many times no expiration date is fixed on the product. Finally. Third World phar- maceutical companies do not have the resources and rarely the personnel and facilities to develop medicines appropriate to local ailments. Many paople in.the Third World still die for lack of medicines, thougb drugs for illnesses of the wealthy are readily available. In August 1979. 93 babies in a single maternity clinic in Bogota died for lack of medicine. One physician in Tanzania has complained about the promotion of luxury drugs when malnutrition is so much more critical. \"Our people do not need vitamins. They need calories, they need protein. they need food. They are starving to death. Inducing them to spend their little money on vitamins is indecent.\" 0 Nepal: The Cure is Worse than the Disease Almost all drugs have side effects which are undesire- able. When modern medicines are misused the cure may often be worse than the disease. In some cases. this may be avoided by knowledge of the predisposing risks such as genetic makeup. concurrent use of other drugs. organ disease (especially kidney or liver), previous allergic reactions to chemically related drugs, etc.. so 'that doses. intervals, or formulations may be adjusted for the individual or other drugs substituted. Third World drug suppliers often have little ex- perience with these problems. In a remote area of Ne- pal. a patient thought he had conjunctivitus. A iocal drug supplier recommended the use of antibiotic eye drops for ten days. During the firs! three days of therapy the problem steadily worsened; his eyes became red and swollen. there was constant tearing. and the cornea became cloudy. causing blurred vision. The man returned to the \"pharmacy\" where he was . advised to double the dose. Over the next week. he developed a fever. severe eye pain, and the zornea became opaque. resulting in blindness. After he discon- tinued the therapy, the fever and pain subsided, but his vision never returned. He had suffered from an irrever- sible allergic reaction to an unnecessary medication. 3 The Abuse of Antibiotics The overuse of such antibiotics as penicillin and te tracycline has dramatically reduced their effectiveness. In the US, some doctors overuse antibiotics, prescrib- ing them for such ailments as the common cold, for which the drugs are not effective. In the Third World. antibiotics are a cure-all: and are mostly available without prescription. Repeated exposure of bacteria to drugs can result in the development of resistant strains. These resistant bacteria can then spread throughout the population. Thus, treatment for some diseases is now more difficult and expensive. For example. one type of penicillin. 100 percent effective in the 1940s against the common Staphylococcus aureus bacterium. is now only 10 per- cent effective. Doctors at the New England Medical Center in Boston recently called for international controls to halt the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. When an antibiotic is no longer effective, others must be developed to deal with the new resistant forms of the disease. According to Dr. George lacoby. Jr.. an associate professor of medicine at Harvard. these methods often cost more and have side effects. For ex- ample. the nm drug needed to successfully treat Staph- ylococcus aureus bacterium is 10 times as expensive as the original penicillin. Reduced effectiveness of these drugs costs lives. In the Third World. Dr. Jacoby said. \"If you don't hit the bacteria with the right antibiotic the first time you don't get a second try. The infant dies.\" 0 [Source: The New York Times 6 August 1981)"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO SOME DRUGS COMMONLY MISUSED IN THE THIRD WORLD ADRLAMYCIN - This toxic chemotherapeutic agent was being sold as an antibiotic on a shelf next to such antibiotics as stretomycin by a street vendor in Rangoon. Burma. in 1979. The drugs were sold for the same ailments simply because the names sounded alike. CHLORAMADINONE ACETATE - Banned in the US and Canada because it contains pentazocine (talwin). which is considered addictive. The labels of four brands sold in Latin America claim the drug does not produce physical or phychological dependence. CHLORAMPHENICOL - An antibiotic. this drug is rarely used in industrialized countries; in the Third World it has been used liberally for common infections when less toxic antibiotics would have been preferable. It is said to cause aplastic anemia (a fatal blood disease) in one of 20.~0.000 cases. Its use was blamed for the death of 20,000 in 3972-73 when a typhoid epidemic broke out in Mexico City. Chioramphenicol was be- lieved to be the cure for typhoid and 100,000 sick pet+ ple were treated with it. Some 20.000 died when it proved ineffective because free use of the drug had pro- duced a resistant strain of typhoid. No hazards were listed on products sold in Colombia and Ecuador. In Latin America the drug is promoted and used for such trivial illnesses as acne and athletes foot. Nine brands are sold in Malaysia and 30 in Thailand. Advertisements stress its versatility; one brand in Thailand suggests the drug for 50 conditions including measles, chicken pox, tonsillitis. and skin disease. In Africa and Asia the drug is recommecded for pneumonia, and liver and stomach diseases. This drug is sold freely. There are no controls in labeling, packag- ing, or indicating the expiration date. CHLOROFORM - Prqducts containing' Chloroform are banned in the US. Canada and most of Europe because they have been linked to liver and kidney damage in humans. In Malaysia, Chloroform is found in at least 6 cough mixtures and 2 brands of toothpaste. CLIOQUINOLlENTEROVIOFORMlMEXASE/MEX- AFORM - In the 1960s. this anti-diarrheal medication was linked to subacute myelwptic neuropathy (SMON'), a crippling, sometimes fatal disease of the ner- vous system leading to blindness, other eye disorders. and paralysis of the feet and legs. In Japan, SMON reached epidemic proportions. affecting an estimated 10,000 to 20.000 people. Clioquinol. taken in normal or high doses over long periods of time. was found respon- sible. In Peru, parents are reported to give the medication to their children on a weekly basis. Although the drug is banned in a number of countries end severely restricted in others it is still available, under 14 dif- ferent brand names with 13 different sets of instruc- tions (one brand contains no instructions). Ciba-Geigy. the principal manufacturer, has US $40 million in sales per year. CLONIDINE - Sold as Catapres, this drug can control high blood pressure. If the drug is delayed for 12 hours or more after it should be given it can cause extremely high blood pressure and even cerebral hemorrhage. In some Third World countries there is no warning on the label. DIANABOUMETHANDROSTENOLONE - This anabolic steroid is severql) restricted in the US and contra-indicated for pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children. It is known to stunt the growth of boys and to cause permanent sex changes in girls. In Colombia. Dianabol is sold as an appetite stimulant for children. The African equivalent of the Physician's Desk Reference says that the drug is for the \"promotion of growth in underdeveloped children.\" Recommended doses for children are also listed in Asian and Mexican doctors' manuals, but no mention is made of its possi- ble dangers. DIPYRONE - Banned in the US and much of Western Europe because it can cause serious or fatal blood damage called agranulocytosis - a disease which decreases the body's ability to produce white blood cells for fighting infection. Dipyrone is used in the Third World to combat pain and fever; it is about as ef- fective a painkiller as aspirin. The drug is sold over the counter, in newspaper kiosks, and even in bars, in Mozambique, Brazil. Mex- ico. Central America, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia. There are more than 100 brand names sold in Latin America, 20 in Malaysia, 28 in Thailand, and 9 in Tanzania. Some brands carry warnings, but many do not. In 1976, a British M.D. reported that enough dipyrone was sold in Tanzania that it was likely that 630 people would die. (Reportedly 1 in 100 dipyrone users contract agranulocytosis, of whom half die.) Although dipyrone was supposedly removed from the market in Bangladesh in 1980, studies show that the manufacturers spent USS140,OOO in advertising that year to clear their stocks. FRUSEMIDWUROSEMIDULASIX - A drug which reduces excess fluid in the body. it can cause dehydra- tion and is suspected of causing birth defects. In Bangladesh a drug company representative attempted to persuade a doctor to use the drug on malnourished children suffering from kwashiokor, a condition which causes the body to retain fluids. HEXACHLOROPHENE - This drug took the US market by storm in the 1960s when it was used in toothpaste, deodorant. baby powders. and fruit and vegetable sprays. In one year it netted $53 million in vaginal sprays alone. In 1972 baby powder was held responsible for a strange neurological disease causing the deaths of more than 30 infants in France. Apparent- ly this drug can be absorbed through the skin, and tests showed that miniscule doses fed to rats could produce major brain damage. As soon as the US marked the drug \"by prescription only.\" a Winthrop Products li- quid soap, Fisohex (Phisohex), containing hex- achorophene became available in Colombia where it is now one of the most popular liquid soaps."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"MATRIX III - VOLUME TWO Culturally Conditioned Nutrition Patterns and Physiological Degeneration The Protein Gambit From the time of early childhood, humans are constantly reminded about \"getting enough proteid'in the diet. Every child is 'tducated\" about 'the basic four food groups\" promoted by the National Egg Board, the National Dairy Council, and the National Livestock and Meat Board. There seems to be an odd preoccupation with introducing foreign animalproteins into humans, to the exclusive of normal dietary intake of available proteins. In a similar manner, a large number of vaccines injected deliberately into humans are based on foreign animalproteins, and we will examine the ramifications of that later on. The belief that animal protein is better than plant protein appears to be based on research in 1914, when Osborn and Mendel did some of the earliest research on protein requirements. Since overt experimentation on humans is discouraged, experiments on rats were conducted. Osborn and Mendel found that rats grew faster on animal protein than they did when they ate plant protein. Of course, rat physiology is different than humans and extrapolation fiom one species to another is often questionable. Nevertheless, they took these results and declared that animal protein, composed of meat, eggs and dairy products, was classified as a 'Class Kprotein. Plant proteins were classified as \" Class B\" proteins.1 These ideas of rigid classes of proteins were discarded in England in 1959, but the American public is still encouraged to accept this dogma.' Scientists who really seem to understand human physiology do not totally agree on the precise figure for human daily need for protein, but established scientific research put the figure somewhere between 2% and 8% of the diet. These figures contain built-in safety margins and are recommended allowances that are more than adequate for 98% of the population.3 Human mothers milk, containing human protein and antigens, has a maximum of 5% protein. In comparison, bovine (cow) milk has 15% protein. Rat milk has an astounding 49%.4 With what we know about plant protein content, it easily provides all the protein humans require. Even if we ate nothing but potato (1 1% protein), we would get more than enough protein for our needs,' but not necessarily all the nutrients we need.

The companies and interests who sell animal protein (meat, fish, cheese, eggs, chicken, etc.) have for many years disseminated cultural propaganda which raise the amount of protein 'you need by 30%, which of course creates a multi-billion dollar industry which also consumes more than 33% of the fiesh water in the United States and leaves behind billions of pounds of animal waste and human disease in its wake. The fact that plant protein is entirely sacient for humans was emphasized at an annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement in Science, at which the eminent nutritionist Dr. John Schaflenburg said, 'let me emphasize, it is difficult to design a reasonable experimental diet that provides an active adult with adequate calories that is deficient in protein.\"6 This brings to mind another aspect of the propaganda of the meat and dairy industry, that an increase in human activity requires a corresponding increase in animalprotein consumption. According to the National Academy of Science, there is little or no evidence that muscular activity increases the need for protein.7 The Result of Excess Protein in the Human Diet The average diet in the United States, culturally encouraged by the media who is lobbied and paid by the meat and dairy industries, contains severely high levels of protein, and there are corresponding medical conditions that arise as a result of this \"normal\" American diet. Since quantities of protein above the 2-8% required has to be processed by the kidneys, it puts additional and unnecessary stress on the body. Along with the process of calcium crystal formation, the kidney also undergoes a gradual process of degeneration, hypertrophy and infammation.' Medical researchers no longer deny the association between excess protein consumption and osteopormis. In a report published in the British journal Lancet, Dr. Aaron Watchman and Daniel Bernstein made si@cant commentary on work sponsored by the United States Department of Health, as well as work done by Harvard University, which called the association of meat based diets with the increasing incidence of osteroporosis \"ines~a~able.\"~ In fact, the most imporant co-factor of osteroporosis is excess dietary protein. The correspondence between excess protein intake and bone reabsorption is direct and consistent. Even with very high calcium intake, the more protein in the diet the greater the ScharfEenburg, J., Problems With Meat, Woodbridge Press, 1982, p.90. 7 National Academy of Sciences, Recommended Dietary Allowances, 8th edition, Washington, D.C., 1974, p.43. * Coe, F., \"Meat and Renal Stones.\" Internal Medicine News, Vol 12.

In other words, the more protein in our diet, the more calcium we actually lose, regardless of how much calcium we take in. The result is that high-protein diets in general, and diets based on meat and dairy products in particular, lead to a gradual but dehite decrease in bone density and assist the development of osteoporosis. The general correlation between the development of osteroporosis and protein intake has also been observed elsewhere on the planet. Statistics tend to show that osteoporosis is most common in those countries where dairy products are consumed in large quantities. This tendency is present in the United States, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. High Protein Intake and Lower Serotonin Production The human body makes use of certain amino acids found in the diet and converts them to specific neurotransmitters. Three primary amino acids in the diet that are important are tyrosine, lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) and tryptophan. The conversion sequences are as follows: Tyrosine + Dopa + Doparnine + Norepinephrine 3 Epinephrine Lecithin + Choline + Choline Acetyltransferase .) Acetylcholine + Cholinesterase Tryptophan + Tryptophan Hydroxylase ..) 5-Hydroxytryptophan + Serotonin Serotonin is an important substance that inhibits aggression and violence. Most proteins encouraged in the diet contain amino acids other than tryptophan. A high protein meal reduces the plasma ratio of tryptophan to the competing amino acids, and less tryptophan is carried across the blood-brain barrier to the neurons. This fact has socially developed to where those who have a high protein diet (meat, dairy, eggs) are more aggressive. Thus, the high protein diet is encouraged in various sports. Some years ago, a chemical company that made pure tryptophan for inclusion into over-the-counter tablets manufactwed a contaminated lot, resulting in the death of several people. The FDA used this as an excuse to ban Tryptophan for sale to the public, removing an important modulator of aggression from public use. This had to be a set-up, because there are scores of other things out there that kill people every day and the FDA ignores them. The Dairy Industry Gambit In an effort to conceal the true nature of what is happening, and to preserve the financial profit margin, the dairy industry fraudeulently claims that bone loss is due solely to a diminished intake of dietary calcium. It is quite interesting to note that the only -I0 Johnson, N., et al \"Effect of Level of Protein Intake on Urinary and Fecal Calcium Retention,\" Journal of Nutrition, Vol 100, p.1425, 1970; Allen, L., et al, \"Protein-Induced Hypercaicuria: A longer term study\" American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Vo1.32, p.741, 1979; Solomon, L., \"Osteoporosis and Fracture of the Femoral Neck,\" Journal ofBone and Joint Surgey, 50B, p.2, 1968."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"MATR.IX III - VOLUME TWO &dies that supp0x-t this contention are those sponsored and paid for by the National Dairy Council (founded'in 1915 by dairy farmers), who continue to push the consumption of dairy products containing toxic substances, animal bacteria and viruses, as well as useless nutritional value, on a public conditioned since birth to accept the 'party line.\" The National Dairy Council (NDC) ironically proposes to the public that 'bones lose calcium because there is not enough calcium in the diet, so drink milk!\" Modem nutritional research clearly indicates a major flaw in this perspective. It is also criminal fraud. Even if bovine milk were good for humans, it no longer represents a viable product once processed by the dairy industry. Experiments have been done feeding calves processed milk. They sickened and died. This policy of the NDC, in addition to the propaganda of the meat industry, could also be considered criminal negligence and even criminal homicide. Somewhere aroud 25% of women 65 years old in the United States have bone mineral losses that are really severe, often with bone material density loss than approaches 50-75%. Almost as many deaths are caused by osteoporosis than cancer of the breast and cervix combined.\" While dairy products are not the total cause of this problem, they are one of the most significant co-factors in the diet. Consumption of eggs and meat, which are acidic foods, cause calcium to be withdrawn fiom the bone structure in order to balance the general systemic pH of the body, which in its natural healthy state is intended to be slightly alkaline. It is a common scientific fact that people who do not eat meat and dairy products are relatively free from osteoporosis. Another reason they are able to get away with this is that the process of decreasing bone density is hard to detect until it reaches a severely advanced stage. Even in relatively advanced stages of osteoporosis, the calcium level in the blood is usually normal, because calcium is withdrawn from bones to adjust the level in the blood. Other Problems Due to Excess Protein Consump'tion Various studies have also shown that high animal protein diets measurably shorten the life span of different animals. These findungs corroborate world health statistics that show that human meat-eating populations do not, as a rule, live as long as vegetarian populations. l2 It is currently estimated that those who can afford it are eating 20% of their total calories in protein, which guarantees a negative mineral balance, not only or calcium, but of magnesium, zinc and iron. Getting one's protein fiom a diet including quantities of meat lends itself to other problems. According to medical research, meat-eaters have higher rates of cancer than do vegetarians. Colin Campbell, a professor in the divison of Nutritional Science at Cornell University, and ironically the senior advisor to the American Institute of Cancer Research, said, \" there is a strong correlation between dietary protein intake and cancer of the breast, \" Barzel,V., Osteoporosis, Grune and Stratton, New York, 1970.

There is considerable evidence that narrowing of the arteries, otherwise known as arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis, is not a conquence of aging, but is rooted in the dietary intake of saturated fats and cholesterol.. The first evidence of this growing problem surfaced during the Korean war, when it was discovered that 77% of U.S. soldiers had blood vessels already narrowed by these deposits. As a result of this wartime discovery, a worldwide study was commissioned fiom 1963 to 1965 which focused on patterns of heart diease and stroke. It was called the International Artherosclerosis Project (IAPP, and under the auspices of the project an examination of arteries in over 20,000 autopsied bodies took place. The findings suggested that people who lived in areas where consumption of saturated fat and choleserol existed also suffered more heart attacks and strokes. Other massive studies soon followed which confirmed these results.

The only organic lifeforms able to handle a diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol without developing substantial arteriosclerosis are the natural carnivores that have a relatively straight digestive tract. Studies at the Maiominides Medical Center, according to Dr. William S. Collins in an article in Medical Counterpoint, indicate that carniverous animals have an almost unlimited capacity to handle these substances, whereas the human body has a very restricted capacity in this manner. Despite all of this scientsc evidence, much of which is kept out of the public eye, the lobbies that support these industries in the United State still push for increased consumption of the very foods that contribute so heavily toward medical problems. It is unfortunate that these industries have such powefil allies in medicine, which is a business that depends on the suppression of this data fiom the public in order to extend their financial line of profit. The Great Cholesterol Gambit These same industries follow the same pattern seen no matter which paradigm we are examining - the psychosocial, chemical, biological or electromagnetic manipulation of human consciousness. They set up interconnected innocent-sounding factions or concerns in order to provide the public with some form of bland assurance that public health is a legitimate concern to them. A good example of this that fits right into the discussion is called the National Commission on Egg Nutrition (NCEN). In 1971, after the American Heart Association (AHA) stood its ground on the subject of dietary cholesterol and heart disease, the egg producers formed NCEN for the specific purpose of fighting medical evidence that they were, in essence, committing activities that constituted criminal negligence in the promotion of a known health hazard. They took our expensive ads in the Wall Street Journal stating \"there is absolutely no scientific evidence that eating eggs, even in quantity, will increase the risk of heart attack.\" It was a bold-faced lie constituting criminal fiaud. The AHA did not hd this terribly amusing, and asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prohibit the NCEN fiom printing blatantly \"false, deceptive and misleading advertising7'. Naturally, to save face, the NCEN responded with a lawsuit, and a court battle followed in which the NCEN tried to defend their false advertising using the First Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees free speech. The judge, however, was not amusing at this vain attempt at Constitutional humor, and himself referred to the NCEN advertisements \"false, misleading, deceptive and unfair.\" There exists a substantial"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"body of competent and reliable scientific evidence that eating eggs increases the risk of heart attacks and heart disease. This evidence is systematic, consistent and congruent in nature. l3 Undaunted by their ideological defeat in court, the egg industries continued to search for other devious ways to promote their unhealthy product. Now, it is well known that the human body itself produces a fonn of cholesterol from basic enzymes and amino acids to use in internal cellular processes. Cellularly, this naturally-produced cholesterol bears no relationship or resemblance to the cholesterol in chicken eggs, but the egg industry attempted to make the comparison anyway, claiming that \"the cholesterol in eggs was necessary for bodily function.\" The courts were not amused by this either, and quickly put a stop to it. However, even today, the NCEN, meat and dairy producers supply \"educational materials\" to schools that assert \"cholesterol is indispensable to human lifeprocesses, which takes advantage of the legitimacy in the public mind of the concept of \"educational materials.\" The court, while deliberating this latest NCEN advertising ploy, found that there is not a single case in human medical history of anyone suffering fiom a deficiency in dietary chole~terol.'~ All this is amusing, because prior to the claim by the egg industry that \"cholesterol is good for you\", they ran a campaign in which they placed flyers in egg cartons declaring \"eggs don't raise cholesterol.\" Stupid is as stupid does. In a similar vein, the National Dairy Council (NDC) has active chapters in 128 cities in the United States, and invests millions of dollars each year for the sole purpose of getting the public to spend money on dairy products. It is interesting that milkprudixts are priced by federal law in such a way that provides the dairy industry more profit on products that have higher fat content. This the NDC pushes those products which make the greatest contribution to heart disease and strokes. Lobbying in the same way that the tobacco industry did, the dairy industry makes =re that their criminal activities become sanctioned by statutory law, make the government (which turns a blind eye to this) an equally liable partner in collusion with these industries. How many Congressmen get donations fiom these industries? Another organization promoting continuation of this overtly criminal practice is the National Livestock and Meat Board, who has historically run campaigns in an attempt to discredit the American Heart Association, and have tried to make it appear as if the \"vast majority of reputable scientists\" never heard of this \"supposed\" connection between saturated fat, cholesterol and heart disease. Examples of Collusion Between the Government and Dairy-Meat Industries In 1961, the American Heart Association publicly urged Americans to substitute products containing \"polyunsaturated fats\" for products containing saturated fats in their l3 NW York Daily News, \"Orders a Stop on Egg Claims,\" Dec 12, 1975, p.62. l4 According to Dr. Robert Lwy, Director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institutte, \"there is no evidence that lowcholesterol diets are harmful, or that dietary cholesterol is an essential nutrient in any human condition.\" 113"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"diet. The dairy industry was not amused, and colluded with the Federal Drug Administration, who arranged for a new law that said that no product could be labelled as polyunsaturated, even if it was 100% polyunsaturated. In 1982, during the infamous Reagan-Bush administration, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was about the publish an article in its magazine Food which was mildly critical of diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol. The meat, dairy and egg lobbies got wind of this and brought the matter to the attention of Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng, who was a former president of the American Meat Institute, and the article was deleted fiom that issue of Food. Eventually, Lyng weasled his way upward and became the Secretary of Agriculture, which placed him in an even better position to oversee what the government told the public and what it did not. The point is, the fact that Lyng worked with or knew industries whom he was bound by law to regulate placed him in a position of conflict of interest. He should have never been allowed to become part of any agency regulating these industries. It is a common pattern that permeates every government on Earth, especially in the United States. The public is not calling the government to task on these issues. Any regulatory body should be staffed by people who have never, or will ever, have contact with representatives of those they oversee. Anything else is unethical. Then again, the entire government of the United States, including Congress, is unethical in this way, isn't it? It stays that way because the people of the United States do not take them to task, en masse. Do it, and do it now. The 1984 Government Study on Cholesterol In 1984, the government announced the result of a ten-year study costing over $1 50 million on the subject of cholesterol. It concluded \"the more you lower cholesterol and fat in your diet, the more you reduce the risk of heart disease.\"\" Some people say the government indulged in collusion far too long. More than 20 years earlier, the AMA was quoted as saying, \"a vegetarian diet can prevent 97% of our coronary occlusions.\"'6 It is also a matter of record that Dr. Charles Glueck, director of the University of Cincinnati Lipid Research Center, one of the centers. that participated in the ten-year study, noted that \"for every 1% reduction in total cholesterol level, there is a 2% reduction of your risk of heart disease.\" Columbia University cardiologist Robery Levy, who directed the entire study, stated \"if we can get everyone to lower cholesterol by 10-15% by cutting down on fat and cholesterol in the diet, heart attack deaths in this country will decrease by 20 to 30%. This would save more lives in one year than are lost to motor vehicle accidents over a ten year period. - IS Walles,C ..., \"Hold the Eggs and Butter: Cholesterol is proved deadly and our diet may never be the same,\" Time Magazine, March 26, 1984, p.56.

He replied, \"up to 50 percent\". Dumbfounded, McGovern asked, \"how can you assert the vital relationship between cancer and diet and then submit a preliminary budget that only allocates slightly over 1% of your knds to this problem?\" Dr. Upton responded, \"that is one question which I am indeed concerned about myself'. Organizations like the National Cancer Institute do not encourage much focus on prevention, because there is vastly more profit to be made in treatment. Attention is further drawn away from prevention by food industries whose products are known to be involved, and they keep pressure on a spineless government, Congress, and public \"health\" organizations to keep them from informing the public as to what is known about dietary prevention. In essence, people are not informed how to keep dietary-related cancer fiom happening. Willful1 criminal neghgence? Yes.

During the Senate hearings on diet and cancer, it was determined that the dietary factors responsible are principally meal and wintake. Dr-Mark Hegstead, a nutritional scientist fiom Harvard University, was called in by the Federal Trade Commission to detennine whether the same diets that caused heart disease also caused cancer. He testifled that the same diet is \"now found guilty in terms of many forms of cancer: prostate cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, cancer of the colon, and others ...\" In light of these developments, the meat, egg and dairy ihdustries have joined hands with the tobacco industry to do whatever they can to confuse the issue and make the public think \"anythmg can cause cancer\".

The meat industry countered by claiming that the people were genetically predisposed to get colon cancer. Studies were undertaken by the National Cancer Institute where people that did not eat meat and did not have colon cancer were brought to the United States and fed the standard American diet.

'They are playing with our chil- dren's lives,\" Nole said. They don't care who it hurts. Tm so tired of this. Even if there was another outbreak, it wouldn't change their thoughts. No one cares, no one really cares.\" .On a 26-15 party-line vote, the Re - publicandominated cornmi ttee ap proved a delay in implementing the regulations as part of the agricul- ture appropriations bill. Just months after the Washington state outbreak, then-Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy traveled to the state and promised to move quickly to adopt new meat and poul- try inspection procedures. But the administration moved slowly, and its new regulations wouldn't start being phased in until'next year. The current system of meat and poultry inspection is based primari- ly on sight, touch and smell. The pm posed regulations would involve mi- crobial tests and institute a system to identify potential food safety haz- ards and build in science-based pre- ventive controls. The proposals would affect about 2,900 plants nationwide. Republicans, led by Rep. James Walsh of New York, insist there is little agreement on the new regula- tions, which could spawn a round of lawsuits. This is just a modest approach to get the groups talking: Walsh said of his proposal for a delay to negotiate rules. Rep. Norm Dicks opposed Walsh's proposal, citing Agriculture Depart- ment data showing that food-borne pathogens account for 7 million cas- es of illness per year and up to 7.000 deaths. Ofthose, the department es- timates that 5 million cases and more than 4,000 deaths may be as- sociated with meat and poultxy pd ucts. 'Kids die because of this,\" Dicks said.

When it was discovered that the intake of polyunsaturated fats could accomplish this, many felt that the answer was to replace the intake of saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats. However, what they did not realize is that polyunsaturated fats lower the level of cholesterol in the blood by hiving it out of the blood and into the colon. l8 Relationship of Fiber Consumption to Colon Cancer Researchers have discovered that the less fiber in a person's diet, the more likely colon cancer (depending on the diet) is likely to occur. Since meat. eggs and dairy products are high in fat and provide absolutely no fiber at all, they are prime candidates for production of dietary-related cancer. The human intestine has a very hard time handling the putrefjmg bacteria, high levels of fat, and lack of fiber that characterize these foods. The human intestine is convoluted, and requires fiber to move things along. In contrast, the intestines of a carnivore are almost straight tubes, which shorten the transit time for material and do not require fiber to move things along. Vegetarians need to aware that not only meat, eggs and dajl fats are he1 to health, but also vegetable fats such as salad oils and margarine. Certain nuts, seeds, olives and avocados contain fats which should be consumed in moderation. Diabetes and Diet Although millions of people undergo problems with diabetes, they are not generally aware that their problems could greatly be relieved by adjusting their diet. Diabetes is the 8th leading cause of death in the United States, because diabetics are extremely vulnerable to arteriosclerosis and are highly prone to heart attacks and stroke. Most diabetics eat the standard diet that most other people eat. As a result most of them, during a seventeen year period which follows discovery of their diabetic condition, undergo major health problems, including heart attack, kidney failure, strokes, and blindness. In Lancet, the British medical publication, Dr.Inder Singh reported a study in which 80 diabetic patients were restricted to very low fat diets - 20 to 30 grams per day - and forbidden any sugar. By the time six weeks had elapsed, more than 60% of the patients no longer required insulin.

Wdfbll criminal negligence? Yes. There is a rare and very serious form of diabetes called childhood onset diabetes which in many ways is a different disease. It is a situation in which the pancreas has been injured and cannot make enough insulin, or in some cases any insulin at all. Despite this kind of problem, maintaining a meat/egg/dairy fee diet and havingfiber in the diet reduces the need for external insulin by as much as 30%. Diabetes and the Presence of Trace Minerals in the Diet In 1972, Dr.Walter Metz informed the Council for Advancement of Science that he was willing to bet that a majority of diabetes-prone patients at two VA hospitals, if given supplementary amountds of chromium in their diets, would be able to better handle their body glucose. The point was to test a theory that chromium deficiency contributed to the condition. The work of Dr. Metz has never been contested. Chromium is apparently one of the trace minerals, along with zinc, that is essential to the proper fbnctioning of insulin in the body. According to Kiihnau and Von Holt, zinc is necessary for the binding of insulin to the islets of Langrahans in the pancreas - binding which is necessary for the hnctional and morphological intergrity of B-cells. In the advanced treatise on Mineral Metabolism, C.L. Comar and Felix Bronner also call attention to the zinc-insulin relationship. Cobalt and selenium may also be involved, since they vary in concentration with both glucose and insulin administration, according to Dr.D.Behne, of Berlin's Hahn- Meitner Institute. The clinicaI importance of such findings was underscored in an article on juvenile diabetes appearing in the April 1971 issue of Nutrition T-, which suggested that the metabolism of trace elements such as chromium and zinc may be altered in those who have this condition. Since the dubious practice of refining wheat flour leads to a marked loss of such trace elements, this is an area which needs to be addressed. Both trace elements are available in a plant based diet. Other Degenerative Conditions Impacted by Alteration in Diet Elimination of sugar, meats, eggs, dairy products and fats in the diet, plus the inclusion of fiber and adoption of more of vegetarian diet, can improve at least the following conditions: Hypoglycemia, Multiple Sclerosis, Ulcers, Constipation and Intestinal Problems, Obesity, Arthritis, Gallstones, Hypertension, Anemia, Asthma and ~almonellosis.~~ \" Singh, I.,\"Low Fat Diet and Therapeutic Doses of Insulin in Diabetes Mellitus,\" Lancet, 263:422, 1955. 20 ~ollenbeck, C.,\"The Effects of Variations ... \", Diabetes, 34: 15 1, 1985 Olevsky, $.,\"Reappraisal of the Role of Insulin in Hypertriglyceridema,\"American Journal oJMedicine, 57:551, 1974 Miranda,P.,\"High-"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"MATRIX ID: - VOLUME TWO The Use of Valuable Plant Protein to Produce Hazardous Animal Protein Because 90 percent of the protein invested in feeding livestock is lost to the environment, it is extremely wastell.

In contrast, growing grains, vegetables and fruits for human consumption uses less than 5% of the raw material used for the production of meat. If the whole planet were to eat according to the practices used by the United States, the entire petroleum reserve of the planet would be exhausted within 13 years.

It has not become clear in the public mind that the nature of the \"foods\" they provided with are the source of a whole plethora of physiological problems. As a result of this public apathy, immense profits are being made at the expense of human beings. Consciousness is the only answer to this problem. Einstein once said that the answers to problems do not come fiom the same state of consciousness that created them. That is the key, and the growth in consciousness begins with awareness about the nature of what is happening. Virtually ALL the credibility of the mass media about food, and the companies that supply food, is based on public ignorance. Refined Sugar Products and Their Effect on the Body and Mind All natural substances, when refined and purified synthetically, undergo a basic change in character. Refined sugar is an excellent example. Because refined sugar causes physiological changes in the body of a temporary pleasant nature (which mask significant degenerative effects), it has been relatively simple to .push this substance on an unsuspecting population. It is estimated that refined sugar production is approximately 200 billion pounds per year, and personal consumption, in well-to-do countries, often exceeds 100 pounds per year. Consumption of processed foods (which are laced with sugar) cost the American public more than $54 biiion in dental bills each year, so the dental industry reaps huge profits from the programmed addiction of the public to sugar products - not that the public is being given much of a choice in the selection of processed food. In 1948, a $57,000 ten- year study was awarded to Harvard University by the Sugar Research Foundation to find out how sugar causes cavities teeth and how to prevent it. In 1958, Time magazine reported the findings, which were reported in the Dental Association JmmaI. They discovered there was no way to prevent the problem and their hndiig immediately disappeared. Physiological symptoms from over-consumption, according to the best medical evidence available, produces diabetes, obesity, and heart problems. Coronary disease has been regarded as a complication of diabetes both coronary disease and diabetes have a common cause - the consumption of white refined sugar and white refined flour. Of all the foods processed by humans, refined carbohydrates lie sugar and flour and altered the most. In order to get five ounces of refined sugar, over 2.5 pounds of sugar beets are processed, removing 90 percent of the fibrous material. The result is an eight-fold concentration of sucrose. Yes, sugar is made_fi-om natural ingredients (sugar cane or sugar beets) so is heroin. The word \"carbohydrate\" is the security blanket for the sugar pushers, and it is deliberately misleading. On packaged ingredient labels sugar (as a refined carbohydrate) is lumped in with all the other carbohydrates in order to hide the effective sugar content from the buyer. In addition, chemists use the word \"sugar\" to describe an entire group of"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"substances that are similar but are not identical. The substance called glucose is a sugar found in hits and vegetables that is the key material in the metabolic processes of all organic life fonns. It is always present in the blood and is often referred to as \"blood sugar\". Dextrose is derived synthetically from starch,fructose is found in hit, maltose is a sugar present within malt and fermented products, lactose is a natural sugar found in milk, and sucrose is a refined synthetic sugar made fiom sugar cane and the sugar beet. When plants containing sucrose are refined, they are stripped of their life force, vitamins and minerals. What remains is a sterile, pure carbohydrate that the human body cannot use. When ingested, there is incomplete metabolism, resulting in the formation of toxic compounds, such as pyruvic acid and sucrose structures containing five carbon atoms. The pyruvic acid accumulates in the brain and nervous system and the abnormal sucrose structures accumulate in the blood, interfering with the nonnal respiratory processes of the cell and depriving them of oxygen. In order to even absorb this 'jpre- digested\" carbohydate, the body has to deplete its store of vitamins and minerals (thiamine and B vitamins), creating an imbalance. Sugar is, in effect, an antinutrient it increases the need for nutrients in the body. A shining example is a pre-sweetened cereal with vitamins added to it. The product is entirely self-defeating and injurious to the body. Rearing this to some degree, the Federal Trade Commission made sugar advertisers cease their claims that sugar was an \"energy builder\" and a \"nutrient\". If sugar consumption continues, a gradual process of cell death occurs that leads to a degenerative condition. Since upwards of 70% of the human diet is composed of refined carbohydrates (refined sugar, white flour, polished rice, macaroni, and most breakfast cereals), it is not hard to understand why the population is developing a host of degenerative diseases. Truth in advertising would be the end of three major television networks, five hundred magazines and several thousand newspapers, plus several thousand parasitic businesses that thrive off a deluded public and depend heavily on false, misleading and deceptive practices. This is to some degree recognized, but is anyone taking their Congressmen to task and demanding some action? Obviously not. The more you see a product advertised, the more of a ripp-off and health hazard it represents. Coca-Cola, for example, contains substances that are known poisons it also causes degeneration of the teeth and stomach lining it's the \"real thing\". About 45 companies, including the American Sugar Refining Company, Coca-Cola, General Foods, General Mills, Nestles, and Pet Milk have as their \"front organization\" a group called The Nutrition Foundation. It would appear that fiom the evidence and historical record, the mass media and advertising companies always tell you the opposite of what is actually the case - in other words they lie to you. Because those lies involve the physiological degeneration of the human population, it constitutes criminal neghgence and a situation of deliberate genocide (albeit a long-term slow genocide) that is not immediately recognized by the \"now\" generation. They can get away with it because the human body can tolerate a lot of abuse before it becomes obvious that something is wrong, but why allow abuse to continue in the first place?"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Just as the military industrial complex will not promote research into the effects of the electromagnetic emanations they produce on the human being, in truth, so it has been with the case of refined sugar products. In 1957, Professor E.V. McCollum published A History of Nutrition in order to write the work, he reviewed over 200,000 published scientific papers. He found that between 18 16 and 1940, there was not one controlled experiment within the framework of establishment science peflonned with refined sugar to indicate the health eflects on human physiology. Sugar taken every day in processed foods produces a continuously over-acid condition, and more and more minerals are required fiom deep in the body in an attempt to rectify the balance. Eventually, so much calcium is taken fiom the bones and teeth that decay and a condition of generalized weakening manifests itself. During the process of continuous sugar consumption, especially with todays processed foods, excess sugar in stored in the liver in the form of glucose until the capacity of the liver to do so is reached. During this process, the liver becomes somewhat enlarged, and excess glucose is returned to the blood in the form of fatty acids, which are stored in the inactive muscular areas of the body, which is everywhere they people gain weight (stomach, buttocks, breasts, thighs, etc). When these areas have been filled to capacity, the fatty acids are then sent to organs (heart, kidneys, etc), which causes them to begin a process of degeneration. Abnormal blood pressure begins to occur, the brain fbnctions are affected, the structural quality of the cellular structures within the blood decline, an overabundance of white cells occurs, creation of new tissue declines, and the immune system is affected. One of the keys to orderly brain hnction is glutamic acid, and this compound is found in many vegetables. When sugar is consumed, the bacteria in the intestines which manufacture B vitamin complexes begin to die - these bacteria nonnally thrive in a symbiotic relationship with the human body. When the B vitamin complex level declines, the glutamic acid (nomally transformed into \"go\" \"no-go\" directive neural enzymes by the B vitamins) is not processed and sleepiness occurs, as well as a decreased abiity for short term memory function and numerical calculative abi~ities.~ The removal of B vitamins when foods are \"processed\" makes the situation even more tenuous. The activity of removing precious vitamins from food during processing, which makes it mtritionally worthless and a medical hazard, and then establishing a multi-billion dollar market on \"supplementary vitamins\" in order to furlher compound the already bulpng medical pro$ts gainedfrom people eating the food, constitutes another intentional criminal act. Processing one hundred tons of brown rice, removing all the nutrients, yields seventy tons of white polished rice it lessens the quantity of real food and replaces it with a lesser quantity of a substance which is a physiological hazard. The fact that polishing rice removed the essential nutrients was known in 1912, after the experiments by Dr.Casirnir Funk at the Lister Institute in London. 22 This is one of the keys for understanding the effect of MSG on the human brain, discussed later. 123"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Deliberate Use of Refined Sugar to Assist Degenerative Disease You can immediately see the effect that consumption of refined sugar has on a population, and since these effects are known, the distribution of refined sugar to a population constitutes a criminal act. In Vietnam the U.S. Government instituted a very successfbl program of selling the Vietnamese processed polished rice (which you can see at the supermarket) as a replacement for their whole grain rice which contains the B vitamin (thiamine) complex. Immediately the general health of the -etnamese began to suffer, especially when they were exposed to American processed foods and soft beverages. The combination of white rice and white sugar was a lethal combination for the Vietnamese. U.S. medical officials in Vietnam in 1971 pretended to be stumped, and decided to announce that a mysterious disease was being coming rampant and a vaccine had to be found. Warnings were broadcast over radio and television and millions of leaflets were dropped. The Vietnamese government was then stuck with the bill for blood plasma and IV fluids which the U.S.Government airlifted in to \"solve the problem\". I remember it because I was there when this was going on. Refined Sugar, Diabetes and Hypoglycemia Dietary causes are not the only cause of a malfbnction of body insulin production, but dietary relationships are what we will focus on here. From World War I to the Vietnam era, physical examinations of draftees points to a steady increase of diabetes among teenagers and the population in general. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, as well as a major contributor to disability and death from disease of the kidney and the heart. The current estimate of those with diabetes in the United States is more than twenty million people. The number of people suffering from pre-diabetic symptoms, hypoglycemia (low blood glucose, very often the precursor of full diabetes) is estimated to be over 100 million people the number is going up each day because of the criminal practices of the American food industry and the spineless government beseiged with payoffs and constant lobbying for increased profits. According to a September 1973 letter from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (an organization that exists, like others, to ensure the exact opposite), unpublished data shows that out of 134,000 people interviewed in 1973, 66,000 (49.2%) reported the symptoms of hyperglycemia (sweating, shakiness, trembling, anxiety, rapid heartbeat, headache, weakness, and occasionally seizures and coma). According to the Journal of the American Medican Association in 1973, \"the majority of people with these symptoms do not have hypoglycemia\". The fact they they do not state what they have is significant, yet they cannot claim to know unless they really know what is happening and they are not telling anyone. Since the HEW study remains unpublished the AMA can claim not to know about it, and say that the claims of widespread hypoglycemia in the United States are \"not supported by medical evidence\", since the HEW study reported statistical epidemiological"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"evidence. The patients reported the evidence, not the doctors. Therefore, it is not \"medical\" evidence. Hippocrates never described a case of diabetes. The only country where actual statistics relating to diabetes and the consumption of sugar is Denmark. In 1880, the average Danish citizen consumed over 29 pounds of refined sugar annually. At that time, the recorded death rate fiom diabetes was 1.8 per 100,000. In 19 1 1, consumption more than doubled to 82 pounds per person, and the death rate from diabetes rose to 8 per 100,000. In 1934, sugar consumption rose to 113 pounds per person and the death rate fiom diabetes rose to 18.9 per 100,000. Before World War 11, Denmark has a higher conscumption of sugar than any other European country. It is interesting that one out of five people in Demark also have cancer. In Sweden, annual consumption per person of refined sugar rose fiom 12 pounds in 1880 to over 120 pounds per person in 1929. One out of six people in Sweden has cancer. The conclusion is inescapable: as refined sugar consumption increases, the incidence of fatal disease increases to match it. The discovery of synthetically produced insulin meant that the pharmaceutical industry had another financial windfall, and the surge in refined sugar production in the United States in the 1920's ensured that the profit would escalate dramatically. Taking too little or too much insulin can cause insulin shock. In 1924, low levels of glucose in the blood were declared to be a symptom of excessive insulin. Dr. Seale Hanis of the University of Alabama began to notice symptoms of insulin shock in many people who were neither diabetic not taking any insulin. These people were diagnosed as having low levels of glucose in their blood (diabetics have high levels of glucose). Dr. Hanis pointed out that the cure for low blood glucose was self-government of the body by giving up refined sugar, candy, coffee and soft drinks. Needless to say, neither the medical establishment nor the food industry was amused by this fact, because patients with hyperinsulin situations could never be made to be dependent on the medical system when they could take care of the problem themselves by watching their diet. Furthermore, in 1929, Dr.Frederick Banting, the discoverer of insulin, informed the medical establishment that the way to prevent diabetes was to cut down on \"dangerous\" sugar bingeing. There is sufficient evidence that the introduction of externally applied insulin by the medical establishment really exacerbates the problem in that it really does not seem to solve anything. A case in point is England, where the deaths because of diabetes in 1925 were 112 million people. After the introduction of insulin shots in 1925, deaths rose to 1 15 million in 1926, and have continued to rise: 13 1 million in 1928, 142 million in 1929, and 145 million in 1931. In the 1930's researchers in the United States discovered that Chinese and Japanese who take rice (natural, not polished) as their principle food had very little diabetes. They also noticed that Jews and Italians had a high incidence of diabetes, as their sugar intake was correspondingly higher. Other statistics in the United States show that the outbreak of"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO diabetes dropped sharply during World War I when sugar was rationed (except it was not rationed to the soldiers who were doomed anyway and the military incidence of diabetes went up). Refined sugar was introduced to Japan after the U.S. Civil War, and the Japanese used it as a medicine. By 1906, 45,000 acres of sugar cane were cultivated in Japan. As the Japanese consumed more sugar, the onset of \"western\" diseases increased. When we eat, the process of digestion coverts food into glucose, which is camed in the blood to the pancreas, where the increased blood glucose level stimulates the production of insulin to balance the glucose level. The insulin is carried in the blood to the liver, where excess glucose is coverted to glycogen, which is then stored in the liver. A decrease in blood glucose, on the other hand, stimulates secretion of cortical hormones in the adrenal gland and hormones in the pituitary gland (ACTH) which raise the blood glucose level by converting some of the stored glycogen in the liver to glucose. In a healthy bodt, the blood glucose level is maintained by the interplat of ins- cortical hormones, and ACTH. Consumption of refined sugar products (as well as honey and fiuits) overstimulates the pancreas, causing over-production of insulin, coverting too much glucose into glycogen, depressing the blood glucose level and producing a condition of hyperinsulinism, or hypoglycemia. As the pancreas tires of producing insulin to counteract the consumption of sugar, the blood sugar begins to rise sigdicantly. When the insulin supply becomes inadequate in this manner, the liver cannot effectively convert excess glucose to glycogen. This condition is known as diabetes. The fact that the recommendation exists in the medical community for a diabetic to consume glucose tablets or sugar cubes when they feel an incident of insulin shock coming on is incredible and counter to established scientific data on the physiological operation of the human body, yet the public mutely accepts this in a blind trust of those \"who know better than we do\". Mass media commercials continually create the atmosphere that the public is a collective bunch of imbeciles, and one that suggests that the medical community and the pharmaceutical companies only care about the welfare of the public. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare should be renamed for what it really stands for, based on its activity and accomplishments over the years: The Department of Disease Production, Mind Control of the Young and Sociological Dependency. In 1960, Japanese doctor Nyoiti Sakurazawa noted, \"no Western doctor can cure diabetes, even thtrty years after the discovery of insulin. Physicians have continued to recommend insulin, condemning diabetics to walk with an insulin crutch for the rest of their lives, yet on the 25th anniversary of the discovery of insulin, the inefficiency of insulin as a treatment or cure for diabetes was publicly admitted. In the meantime, millions of diabetics have paid millions of dollars for this ineffective remedy. The number of diabetics is increasing every day. Once they begin taking insulin, they can expect to feed the pockets of the doctors and pharmaceutical corporations as long as they live.\""},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"In 1964, Sakurazawa said, \"I am confident that Western medicine will admit what has been known in the Orient for years: sugar is without question the number one murderer in the history of humanity - much more lethal than opium or radioactive fallout. Sugar is the greatest evil that modem industrial civilization has visited upon the countries of the Far East and Africa (genocide) ... foolish people who give or sell candy to babies will one day, to their horror, that they have much to answer for.\" In 199 1, according to the 1993 World Almanac and Book of Facts, the United States exported $12.1 million dollars of sugar and imported $7 13 million dollars worth of sugar, much to the delight of the medical and pharmaceutical industries, and the detriment of the population. Increased sugar consumption and the resulting symptoms of hypoglycemia have also contributed toward an increasing number of accidents on the highways of the world - the carnage continues.

The Introduction of Chemical Food Additives into the Food Supply and the Effect on Human Behavior and the Brain Food additives are substances added to processed food to allegedly improve taste, color, smell, flavor and preservability. In many cases, \"processed foods\" represent wholesome food that has been degraded through processing, often resulting in \"foods\" that contain substances that have cumulative toxic effects that produce disease and degeneration in humans that eat them. Additives; some of which are cumulatively toxic, are added to conceal the poor quality and nature of the food provided for us while at the same time effecting the human brain and behavior. Although substances that affect the human body in this way must by law be regulated, lobbied loopholes by food manufacturers allow consistent assault of the mental capacity of children and adults, promote and encourage aberrant behavior patterns and interfere with the capacity to learn and process infoxmation. 23Abrahamson, E.M, Mind Body and Sugar Journal of the American Medical Association, 83:729, 1924 Himsworth, H., Clinical Science, 2: 1 17, 1935 Frederidrs, C., \"Low Blood Sugar and You\" Campbell, G., Nutrition and Diseases, 1973 New York Times, \"Ailment Striking Young in V~ctnam\", July 22, 1973 r)rrffy, W.,% Sugar Blues*, 1975 Deer, D., The History of Sugar Strong, L., The Story of Sugar, Collum, E., A History of Nutrition Robetu, H., \"Sugar Unmasked as a Highway Killer\", Prevention Magazine, March 1972 Medjcal World News, January 197UMarch 1973 Pria, W., \"Nutrition and Physical Degeneration\" Academy ofApplied Nutrition, 1948; Dope Incorporated and the Unseen Hand."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"MATRIX III - VOLUME TWO The Canyon Verde School Study on Additives Mer the use of saccharin was marginally addressed in 1976, many people began to look at the use of chemical food additives more closely. After a school nutritionist met with student resistence on food guidelines, a study was conducted 1982 at the Canyon Verde School in California. The study was performed by students, who used three groups of rats to demonstrate the effect of additives. The control group of rats was fed natural food and clean water. The second group was fed natural food, clean water and hotdogs. The third group was fed sugar-coated cereal and fruit punch. The fourth group was fed doughnuts and cola. It was immediately apparent that the different diets had different effects on behavior in the three groups. The rats receiving natural food and clean water remained attentive and alert. The rats receving natural food and hotdogs became violent and fought aggressively. The third group of rats subsisting on products containing sugar-coated cereal and fruit punch were nervous, hyperactive and behaved aimlessly. The fourth group subsisting on doughnuts and cola were unable tofinction as a social unit. They were feafil and had trouble sleeping. The Effect of Paternal Consumption of Additives on Newborn Behavior During the 1982 study with four groups of rats and food consumption, many of the rats became pregnant in each group. The students had the opportunity to see the extended result of diet on newborn organisms. The newbom rats displayed the same traits as the mothers in each separate group, which meant that (1) chemical additives may have passed to the newborns in the mothers milk, or (2) chemical adiitives may be capable of passing though placental membranes, or (3) chemical additives may be capable of passing through the blood-brain barrier, as the fetal organisms shared the same blood with the mother. Change of Diet and Reversal of Physiological Symptoms When students in the Canyon Verde Study reverted to natural food for the groups who had received food with additives, it took several weeks for the rats to return to a natural state of behavior. It is unknown whether this same time period applies to humans, especially after sustained consumption of these chemicals by the time a child becomes an adult, but there are encouraging indications that symptoms can be reversed by altering human diet. When the children at Canyon Verde school began eating foods without chemical additives (BHT,BHqTBHQ and artificial flavors and colors), profound changes began to take place. Students formerly disruptive and hyperactive became civilized, calm and attentive.24 We will discuss some of these other additives in detail later. 24 It is these same students who would be candidates for psychological therapy and intervention with psychotropic drugs such as Ritah, Cylert or Dexidrine, when all the time the problem was in the gi& of the children.

Three years before the Canyon Verde study in 1979, the schools in New York City made a basic change in the school lunch program that excluded foods with a high sugar content, as well as eliminating foods with two synthetic coloring chemicals. Within one year, the scores on standardized California achievement tests went up 8%. The school system then banned all synthetic food colorings and flavoring. The scores went up another 4%. Threee years later in 1983, all foods containing BHT and BHA were removed from school lunch programs. The scores increased an additional 4%. This means that school lunch programs are decreasing the mental capacity of children by at least 16%. Food Additives and Hyperactivity in Children A school study on rats and the experience of the students in New York City is not the only indicator that artificial colors and preservatives are causing behavioral hyperactivity in children. Lancet, the journal of the British Medical Association, despite its allopathic orientation, reported that these substances are capable of producing hyperactivity. The journal once focused on Yellow NOS, chemically known as tartrazine, and the preservative benzoic acid, commonly found in processed foods. These two chemicals produced dramatic reactions in 79% of children.25 Although a direct reference could not be located, it is claimed that the Surgeon General of the United States claimed that 8,000 people die of cancer each year from synthetic chemicals in food. Testing of Additives: A Commentary If manufacturers bother to test synthetic chemical additives at all, they test them on animals which are insulated from the enviromental co-factors that 'people are normally exposed to which are known to aggravate cancer and other degenerative disease. Given that sufficient research has been conducted worldwide on the physical and psychological effect of these chemicals, combined with the known fact that they are immune from regulation because of loopholes, one can only conclude that they continue to be added to processed foodr deliberately in order to increase the likelihood of degenerative dsease requiring medical intervention, producing financial gain and incentive for the medical complex, which constitiutes criminal negligence and, in some cases, deliberate criminal homicide for those who directly die as a result of these chemicals.

Artificial Sweetners When sugar is mutely recognized by medical doctors and patients alike as being the source of some problem, artificial sweetners are often recommended. These synthetic substances have been widely documented as causing a variety of problems in those that are sensitive to them (lack of sensitivity in others may be due to the fact that any symptomology that might be caused by them is overwhelmed by symptoms caused by other factors) it is analogous to replacing heroin addiction with methadone addiction. The proaramrned addiction to sweetness takes a lot to overcome. The fact that it cannot be overcome easily by a population that is basically unconscious is no surprise. Saccharin In 1977, Canada's Health Protection Branch (the equivalent to the FDA), released a major study indicating that saccharin causes bladder cancer in rats. This prompted the FDA to \"propose\" a ban. Studies carried out by the National Cancer Institute (which relies on the existence of cancer for its own existence) \"indicated\" that saccharin use \"is not associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.\" The National Academy of Science also echoes that position. It might be stated that the effect of saccharin on the unborn fetus is unknown. It is a well known fact that today, more people make a living fiom cancer than die of it - and the death rate is increasing. Cyclamates In 1937 a scientist at the University of Illinois, as the story goes, happened to lay a lit cigarette on a pile of crystal-like powder he was experimenting with. When he picked up the cigarette and inhaled he noticed that the powder on the cigarette tased sweet. What scientist Michael Sveda had discovered was the sweet taste of cyclamates, acid derivatives 30 times sweeter than sugar. Abbott Laboratories in Chicago became aware of this and began to market cyclamates in the early 1950's. It reigned as the foremost sugar alternative until 1970, when the FDA banned it after learning it caused bladder tumors in laboratory animals. In 1973, Abbott asked the FDA to allow cyclamates back on the market. The FDA, after reviewing Abbotts research, indicated to Abbott that it had not indicated to a \"reasonable certainty\" that cyclamate was safe for human consumption. Not one word was said about the biased conflict of interest in allowing Abbott to present safety data on its own product. In 1982, Abbott \"arrived at more data and again petitioned the FDA to allow its sale, oblivious of any potential risks inherent in the compound. The FDA called on its"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Cancer Assessment Committee (CAC) to review the data. In 1984, the CAC concluded that 'the evidence on cyclamate indicated it was safe7'. It is not known if members of the CAC were paid by Abbott, or influenced in any way to disregard known scientific information, in order to come up with this criminally negligent decision. However, a separate review of cyclamates by the National Academy of Sciences in 1985 stated that while cyclamate 'tlid not appear to be carcinogenic in and of itself: 'Some evidence suggsted that it may promote the growth of tumors when it combines with other carcinogens.\" Abbott Laboratories is still in the process of petitioning the government to reintroduce cyclamates into the food supply. Sucralose The substance called sucralose is approximately 600 times sweeter than regular sugar (sucrose). Sucrolose is a derivative of refined sugar, making it even more insidious insofaras its effect on the body. In 1992, the FDA was in the process of studying a petition for use of sucralose in 15 foods and beverages, including hit spreads, milk products and salad dressings. At the same time officials in Canada, Australia and the EEC were also considering its use. The current status of sucralose is unknown. Mamfacturer: Johnson & Johnson.

Stevia Leaves (natural) and the extract Stevioside Currently used in 10 countries, including Japan, Paraguay and Brazil, stevioside is an extract fiom the leaves of the stevia plant. The leaves are 300 times sweeter than sugar. The leaves are known to be non-toxic and benign. The stevia is a South American shrub also grown in Asia and parts of California. Indian tribes in South American have ued stevia for centuries as a digestive aid and as a topical dressing for wound healing. Recent studies indicate that it can increase glucose tolerance and decrease blood sugar levels. Stevia gained great popularity in the 1980's in the United States. Celestial Seasonings used it as a flavoring for many of their teas. In 1986, without warning, the FDA came into their warehouse and seized their stock of stevia. No reason was given for the seizure; the company was simply told they could not use it in their teas.The extract stevioside is presumed safe, although it slightly alters the taste of food and can leave an aftertaste. In 199 1, the FDA banned stevia, claiming it was \"an unsafe food additive': even though it is available in many other countries, presumably to prevent it fiom competing with aspartame and other synthetic chemical sweeteners. The American Herbal Products Association (AHPA) has petitioned the FDA to lift the ban on stevia, based on the fact that stevia is not a food additive, but a food with a long record of safety.26 26 Despite the apparent ban, stevia is still available: White Stevia powder is available from The Body Ecology Diet in Atlanta, Georgia, at 800-896-7838 or 404-266-1366. Two ounces of powder are about $20 plus S&H and lasts about 5-9 months.

It is marketed as \"Sunette\" in a sugar substitute called \"Sweet One\", and is found in foods such as pudding and gum. Soon after the substance was approved in 1988, during the Bush administration, critics charged that some evidence suggested it might cause tumors in rats. When the FDA reviewed the studies conducted on the sweetener (studies paid for by the maker, which constitute a conflict of interest, invalidating the safety of the product) it found that \"over time\", rats who consumed AK \"ended up with no higher incidence of tumors than would be expected to occur naturally during their lifetime\".

It is estimated that as many as 20,000,000 people cannot metabolize phenylalimine, and this inability is genetically inherited by children. The inability to metabolize phenylalinine can lead to mental retardation in children. This means a risk of retardation for millions of children. A multi-billion dollar enterprise, this substance is said to be \"refined\" from \"natural\"substances. Like other \"refined\" substances, it represents a health threat to the general public. No long term studies have been performed to evaluate the physiological effects of this substance, yet the public is lead to believe it is absolutely safe. Technically, the chemical is called aspartame, and it was once on a Pentagon list of biowarfare chemicals submitted to ~on~ress.** Aspartame is in over 4,000 products worldwide and is consumed by over 200 million people in the United States alone. What follows is a skeletal examination of the chronology related to aspartame. A more detailed chronology is given later in this chapter based on information provided to us by the Aspartame Consumer Safety Network. Aspartame is produced by G.D. Searle Company, founded in 1888 and located in Skokie, Illinois. It is about 200 times sweeter than the refined sugar that it is meant to replace, and it is known to erode intelligence and affect short-term memory.

It is an rDNA derivative made fiom two amino acids, L-phenylalanine, L-aspartic acid and methanol. Originally discovered during a search for an ulcer drug in 1966, it was \"approved by the FDA in 1974 as a \"food additive\". Approval was followed by a retraction based on demonstrated public concern over the fact that the substance produced brain tumors in rats. According to the 1974 FDA task force set up to examine aspartame and G.D.Sea.de, \"we have uncovered serious deficiencies in Searles operations and practices, which undermine the basis for reliance on Searle's integrity in conducting high quality animal research to accurately determine the toxic potential of its products.\" The task force report concluded with the recommendation that G.D. Searle should face a Grand Jury \"to identifjr more particularly the nature of the violations, and to identifjr all those responsible.\"29 In 1976, an FDA \"task force\" brought into question all of G.D. Searle's aspartame testing procedures conducted between 1967 and 1975. The final FDA report noted faulty and fiaudulent product testing, knowingly misrepresented product testing, knowlingly misrepresented findings, and instances of irrelevant animal research. In other word, illegal criminal activity. Understandably scared, Searle officials sought to suppress the FDA findings and obstruct justice. They turned to Nion and Ford administration operative Donald Rumsfeld and elected him \"chairman of the Searle organization.\" In 1977, the Wall Street Journal detailed the fact that Rumsfeld made efforts to \"mend fences\" by asking \"what Searle could do\" in the face of the changes. Also in 1977, Dr. Adrian Gross, a pathologist working for the FDA, uncovered evidence that G.D.Searle might have committed criminal fraud in withholding adverse data on aspartame.30 The FDA requested that U.S. Attorney Samuel Skinner be hired to investigate Searle's aspartame testing procedures in January 1977. Samuel Skinner was the federal prosecutor responsible for convincing the Grand Jury to investigate whether Searle willfblly and criminally withheld data that cast doubt on the safety of aspartame. In February 1977, Skinner met with Searle attorneys at the Chicago law firm of Sidney & Austin. Suddenly, newly elected President Carter announced that Skinner would not remain in office, and Skinner thereafter announced that he would be hired by Sidney & Austin. Obviously, Skinner then had to recuse himself from the Searle prosecution. The case was taken over by U.S. Attorney William Conlon, who essentially sat on the case, despite complaints from the Justice Department, which was urging that a grand jury be convened to prosecute Searle Company for filsifjmg Nutra-Sweet test data. Failing to preform his duty, Conlon also joined Searle's law firm in January 1979. Skinner's defection fiom the FDA might have been prompted by the results of the review of the Searle studies. David Hattan, deputy director of the FDA Division of 29 The Guardian, England, July 20, 1990. The Guardian also published articles that prompted the NutraSweet Company in Deerborn, Illinois to file a lawsuit for libel, maintaining that \"safety issues were resolved long ago\". The Guardian cited documents submitted to a British government committee reviewing artificial sweeteners. 30 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Toxicological Review and Evaluation, concedes that anyone reading the orginal FDA investigation reports is likely to be \"shocked\" by what they reveal. He says that the ensuing review of the Searle studies, in which he was involved from the time of his arrival in 1978, was one of the most thorough in the agency's history. It included an unprecedented hearing before a public board of inquiry composed of experts fiom outside the agency. Arthur Hayes, Jr., then Commissioner of the FDA appointed by Reagan, agreed with Searle and the FDA's Bureau of Foods (now the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition) that \"an appropriate analysis of the data showed no significant increases in tumor incidence in rats exposed to aspartame or DKP, one of the breakdown products of aspartame. The board of inquiry rejected concerns that aspartame's components could cause neurological damage.31 In 1981, under pressure from the soft drink lobby, FDA Commissioner Hayes approved the initial use of aspartane in dry foods and as a tabletop sweetner, discounting public complaints as anecdotal and ignoring three FDA scientists32 who voiced the fact that there were serious questions concerning brain tumor tests after having done an in- house study. Hayes was widely profiled as a man who believed that approval for new drugs and additives was \"too slow\" because \"the FDA demanded too much information.\" Hayes also ignored the fact that the biased scientific studies paid for by Searle were faulty.33 Afer leaving the FDA, Hayes took the post of senior medical consultant for the public relationsfinn retained by ~earle.~~ A subsequent inquiry \"found no improprieity\". In July 1983 it was approved for use in soft drinks in the United States, followed three months later by approval in Britain by the Ministry of Agriculture. All this was done despite the fact that the Department of Defense knew that aspartane was neurotoxic and harmful to human health. These facts were deliberately suppressed by the government. It is also interesting that in 198 1 FDA scientist Dr. Robert Condon, in an internal government document, said \"I do not concur that aspartame has been shown to be safe with respect to the induction of brain tumors.\" All safety was thrown aside because of pressure fiom Searle. Considering the connections the drug companies have to the medical and intelligence community, it would not be surprising that there were other factors involved in the pressure to adopt aspartame into the diet of the population. In 1984, the Arizona Department of Health began testing soft drinks to ascertain the level of toxic deteriorization by-products in soft drinks. It was determined that soft drinks stored in elevated temperatures promoted more rapid deteriorization of aspartane into \" Food Magazine, Vol 1, No.9.

The FDA decided to ignore these results. Public complaints about the effects of aspartane began to come in. People complained of headaches, dizziness, vomiting, nausea, blurred vision, seizures, convulsions and a host of other reactions to aspartane. Also in 1984, the Centers for Disease Control made the j-audulent announcement that \"no serious, widespread\" side effects of aspartame had been found. It was an outright lie, and this announcement was quickly followed by another from PepsiCo that it was dropping saccharin and adopting aspartame as the sweetener it all its diet drinks. Others followed suit, despite the January 1984 broadcast on CBS Nightly News where & chief scientist for the FDA task force investipatina - Searle vublicly stated that SearZe comDanv officials made \"deliberate decisions\" to cloak amartame 's toxic effects. When a human comsumes \"Nutra-Sweet@\", it breaks down above 85\" not only into its constituent amino acids, but into methanol, which further breaks down into formaldehyde, which is carcinogenic35 and very toxic, as well as formic acid and a brain tumor agent called diketopiperrnine (DKP). In a meek attempt to ward off hrther public inquiry, the FDA in 1984 announced that \"no evidence has been found to establish that asparkme's methanol by-product reaches toxic levels\". Thir was a direct lie. since Medical World News re~orted in 1978. six years earlier. than the methanol content of agartame is 1.000 times greater than most _foods under FDA control. Furthermore, the methanol in aspartame is \"free methanol\", which is never found in nature. Methanol in nature is always accompanied by ethanol and other compounds which mitigate the - methanol when introduced into the body. In 1985, Searle Company was bought by Monsanto, the maker of other insidious substances that manage to find their way into human food, including Bovine Growth Hormone (BGH). Senator Metzenbaum, commenting on the FDA relative to the aspartame issue in 1985 said, \"the FDA is content to have Searle conduct all safety tests on aspartane. That's absurd.\" In 1986, the Wmhington Post reported that the Supreme Court rehsed to consider arguments that the FDA had not followed proper procedures in approving aspartame, despite arguments that the product \"may cause brain damage.\" (Supreme Court obstructing Justice). Since Clinton-qpointed Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is a former attorney for ~onsanto~~ .it is unlikely that hundreds of millions of people will find redress. There are also indications of ties between Monsanto and elements in the CIA. In August of 1987, the University of Illinois, a recipient offindingfrom Monsanto, issued a study \"exonerating aspartame of causing seizures in laboratory animals.\" The fact that they were paid by Monsanto automatically invalidates the results. U.S. Senate hearings in 1987 showed that G.D.Searle used \"psychological strategy\" to get regulators 35 Formaldehyde is also a prime ingredient in vaccinations/irnmunizatiom given to humans. 36 Extraordinary Science, Vol7, No.1, Jan/Feb/Mar 1995, p.39. 135"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"at the FDA \"into a yes-saying habit\" to \"bring them into a subconscious spirit of participation.\"37 More than half of 69 medical researchers polled by the FDA in 1987 said they were concerned about aspartame's safety.)* In 1989, the FDA received over 4,000 complaints fiom people who described adverse reactions. Because the FDA conveniently lists aspartane as a \"food additive\". it removes the legal reauirement for adverse effect reporting to any Federal agency and the necessitv for safetv monitoring processes. Research also indicates that aspartame. when combined with glutarnine products (such as MSG. widelv used in foods) increase the likelihood of brain damaze occurring in ~hildren.~' Some of the more interesting developments in 1989 surfaced in the Palm Beach Post on October 14th where an article by Dr. H.J.

It is interesting to note that afrer Samuel Skinner lefr Sidnev & Austin, Searle 's law jkm, he was apointed Secretary of Transportation. Hence, he was in charge of the FAA, just in time to head off complaints fiom pilots affected by aspartame. His wife was employed by Sidney & Austin. Later as George Bush's Chief of Staff in 1991, during the Gulf War, he was in a position to head off all inquiries relative to asparatame, no matter where they were directed - to the FDA, FAA or Department of Defense. This constitutes criminal neghgence and racketeering. George Bush, of course, was an ex-director of the Central Intelligence Agency. On July 20, 1990, an article in the national British newspaper The Guardian, entitled \"NutraSweet test results 'faked\"', revealed that the British government had finally been persuaded to review the safety of aspartame after \"receiving a dossier of evidence highlighting its potential dangers.\" According to The Guardian, the dossier alleged that laboratory tests were falsified, tumors were removed fiom laboratory animals and animals were 'restored to life' in laboratory records4'. The dossier against NutraSweet was compiled by Erik Millstone, a lecturer at the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University and author of two books on food additives. It was based on thousands of pages of evidence, much of which was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.

An example from the report: \"Animal A23LM was alive at week 88, dead from week 92 through 104, alive at week 108 ind dead at week 112.\" Lab animals were not permanently tagged to avoid identification mixups.

Animals were allowed to decompose before post mortem exams were conducted."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"COT, Committee on Toxicity, was at the time looking into consumption of artificial sweeteners and did not possess the key documents covering alleged mishandling of the safety tests which Millstone was asked to provide. The British Ministry of Agriculture and Department of Health have never revealed the evidence upon which approval was given in England for the distribution of aspartame, maintaining that \"these are matters of commercial confidence.\" The British government does not testing of its own but relies on safety tests provided by the manufacturer, which of course constitutes a codict of interest. The 1990 article quoted the British Department of Health as saying \"NutraSweet is not a health hazard on the available evidence, but people do suffer 'ideosyncratic reactions' to food additives.\" Interestingly, it was pointed out that three out of 14 members of the Committee on Toxicity have direct or indirect links with the artificial sweetener industry, according to David Clark, the Labour Party Agriculture spokeman, who requested a Parliamentary Answer to address questions of conflict of interest. Aspartame is also sold in England under the product name \"Canderel.\" In 1990, the market for asparatame in England was estimated at £800 million. During the 1991 Gulf War, all military personnel were provided fiee supplies of aspartame-laced soft drinks together with experimental vaccines, nerve gas antidotes and personal insecticides. They were also treated to direct biochemical warfare compounds. The result is Gulf War Syndrome, which is communicable and deadly, and 50,000 military personnel and their dependents are wasting away before our eyes. Criminal negligence? Of course. Criminal conspiracy? Yes. Genocide? Probably - we're waiting to see. Independent tests on animals have shown that amartme alters brain chemicals that also affect behavior. The chemical nature of aspartame was also shown to defeat its own alleged \"purpose\" as a \"diet aid\", since high doses instill a craving for calorie-laden carbohydrates. Then, the aspartame-carbohydrate combination further increases the effect of aspartame on the brain.42 Interestingly, even the American Cancer Society confirmed that users of artificial sweeteners gained more weight than those who didn't use the products, hrther undermining the supposed \"purpose\" for the existence of aspartame in the food.43 Haven't we heard this kind of criminal fraud before?

The FDA and the Centers for Disease Control continue to receive a stream of complaints from the population about aspartane. It is the only chemical warfare weapon available in mass quantities (should keep the cone-heads happy) on the grocery shelf and promoted in the media. It has also been indicated that women with an intolerance for phenylalinine, one of the compoents of aspartame, may give birth to infants with as much as a 15% drop in intelligence level if they habitually consume products containing this dangerous substance? The March 1995 issue of The PaclJic Flyer published a pro-aspartame article in which it stated, \"the Federal Aviation Administration conducted its own cognitive research and, according to experts, found no contraindications that would prevent pilots, or anyone, from ingesting aspartame.\" This flies in the face of consistent reports fiom pilots who maintain they have suffered severe and dangerous repercussions in the air after drinking soft drinks containing aspartame. Virtually every time, symptoms disappeared when aspartame-laced drinks were dis~ontinued.~' Over 600 pilots have reported this problem. So, the faked Searle tests remain. The FDA bases its findings on the faked Searle tests, and the Journal of the American Medical Association, examining the FDA findings, based on the faked Searle tests, announced \"the consumption of aspartame poses no health risk for most people.\" Searle officials argue that the use of aspartame as an artificial sweetener \"has been officially approved not only by the FDA, but by foreign regulatory agencies and the World Health Organization\" - based on Searle-sponsored aspartame research, not independently conducted tests. The major selling point of aspartame is as a diet aid, and it has been demonstrated that the use of this product actually causes people to consume more food. Normally, when a significant quantity of carbohydrate are comsumed, serotonin levels rise in the brain. This is manifested as a relaxed feeling after a meal. When aspartartame is ingested with carbohydrates, such as having a sandwich with a diet drink, aspartame causes the brain to cease -~roduction of serotonin, meaning that the feeling of having had enough never materializes. You then eat more foods, many containing aspartame, and the cycle continues. Monsanto's profit fiom its NutraSweet Division was $993 million in 1990. The symptoms of aspartame intoxication include severe headaches, nausea, vertigo, insornina, loss of control of limbs, blurred vision, blindness, memory loss, slurred speech, mild to severe depression often reaching suicidal levels, hyperactivity, gastrointestinal disorders, seizures, skin lesions, rashes, anxiety attacks, muscle and joint pain, numbness, mood changes, loss of energy, menstrual cramps out of cycle, hearing loss or ringing in the ears, loss or change of taste, and symptoms similar to those in a heart attack.

A: \"Aspartame does not cause memory loss. The question may well have been based on anecdotal information, such as reports to the FDA Adverse Reaction Monitoring System (ARMS), which has been maintained since 1984. Linda Tollefson, DVM, of the FDA Division of Marketing Studies has written, \"It is not possible to overcome the inherent biases of anecdotal reports, and this limitation underscores the need for controlled scientific studies to resolve questions regarding aspartame and adverse reactions.\" Numerous such randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have been conducted with aspartame during the past 20 years. There has been no observation of memory loss. Such studies included children with attention deficit disorder, children with known epilepsy, children and adults who were thought to have seizures related to aspartame, adults who were convinced that aspartame was related to allergic disorders or headaches, and pilots. Based on the results of these studies, there is no scientific basis to believe that aspartame causes adverse experiences, including neurobehavioral disorders and memory loss.

Let's look at the preceeding statements: Statement I: The statement that aspartame, and sugar, have no effect on childrens behavior is clearly not the case, based on reams of experiential data and scientific reports. I don't know who these people are trying to fool more, the public or each other. The evidence presented in a partial list of studies previously proves article in the WU to be absolute bunk. Statement II: The first thing that strikes me is the comment that adverse reports about aspartame constitute \"anecdotal\" information. The word \"anecdotal\" means simply \"an unpublished account of a personal event containing little known facts\". In other words, if you experience a reaction to a drug, and word of the reaction needs to be suppressed from the public, even though it is valid information reported with an established adverse event reporting system, then the people who are trying to suppress the information will notpublish it. Because it is not published, even if the information is absolutely true, the word \"anecdotal\" is used by allopathic medicine and materialist science to dismiss that which does not fit into their paradigm. Secondly, the author of the article fails to mention that aspartame breaks doh into methanol, or wood alcohol, which is toxic to humans, at temperatures above 85 degrees. Thirdlv, the familiar phase \"because it is in the body already\", which has been used before in defense of irrationality, does not apply to the combination of L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine (aspartame), over and above the fact that phenylalanine is not described as being in the body naturally, but only as a consequence of its presence in things we should not be eating anywcry. Two wrongs to not make a right. Furthermore, the stated use of brain damaged humans to evaluate if aspartame causes memory loss is a bit ludicrous. The facts are already in. The studies have been done. The maker of aspartame has already been slapped on the hand for doing fraudulent studies. So, my dear AMA, don't give us that crap about 20 years of studies, double-blind and placebo-controlled bullshit regarding aspartame. Statement III: This is a good one, indeed. The fact that this doctor is a consultant to the maker of aspartame automatically dsqualzjies him from making any"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"valid comment because of conflict of interest. He is paid to say good things about aspartame. The scientific evidence refbtes everything these people are saying. The fact that U.S., Canadian, British and German medical schools have been charged to \"study anecdotal allegations\" and have \"not been able to substantiate the claims\" simply means that those charged to do this are guilty of incompetance, criminal neglect, conspiracy and racketeering - it doesn't mean that the truth is not true.It is a fact that \"asking the fox to guard the henhouse\" has never worked. Furthermore, there is no way that this MD could have possibly \"reviewed the world literature\", which is also a commonly used phrase by participants of many kinds of coverups. First of all, the \"world \"literature\" he is refemng to, I am sure, is literature compiled by U. S. Canadian, British and German doctors who are part of the problem. I have earlier provided part of the \"world literature\" that dismisses what this doctor says in its entirety. You will find great numbers of U.S, Canadian, British and German scientists all through the paradigm of the psychosocial, chemical, biological and electromagnetic manipulation of human populations. Lastly, there is no world standard for publication of scientific information, no standard language for publication and no standard place where it is all collected, so how could this doctor \"review world literature\"? Stupid is as stupid does. Commentary on Scientific Testing of Aspartame in Animals to determine Fetal Effects Much testing on the safety of chemical substances is done on rodents, specifically rats. Rodent physiology is quite different than humans, and rodents metabolize chemicals differently. Rats in the aspartame tests had to be fed 60 times more aspartame to approximate the equivalent effect on humans. Tests using rodent species relative to aspartame have also been conducted with guinea pigs, because much of the brain development occurs in utero, much like humans, and the guinea pig metabolizes phenylalanine in a manner more similar to humans than rats. During experiments published in 1989 by Diana Dow-Edwards et al, in Neurotoxicology and Teratology, Vol 1 1, entitled \"Impaired Performance on Odor Aversion Testing Following Prenatal Aspartame Exposure in the Guinea it was revealed that fetal aspartame exposure during gestation disrupts odor-associative learning patterns. In other words, the fetal brain was affected negatively by aspartame in areas responsible for learning tasks, e.g, the amygdala. This particular scientific experiment was conducted at the Laboratory of Cerebral Metabolism, Department of Neurosurgery, State University of New York, Health Science Center, Brooklyn, New Yorlc, and the Department of Psychology, San Diego State University, San Diego, California. Even though the experiments were conducted on guinea - - -- 48 This report is on file at Leading Edge. 142"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"pigs, the report mentioned that aspartame, particularly phenylalinine, has been shown to be developmentally neurotoxic even in rats. Aspartame and Seizures: Scientific Research There have been many reports of seizures in humans which have been initiated by consumption of aspartame. The pro-pharmaceutical faction calls these reports \"anecdotal\", essentially meaning that it is a phenomenon whose knowledge must be suppressed to preserve the \"status quo\". A double-blind controlled study conducted at the Kingston General Hospital and Queens University Medical School in Ontario, Canada, entitled \"Asparteme exacerbates EEG spike-wave discharge in children with generalized absence epilepsy7' revealed that the duration of spike-wave discharge per hour was significantly increased after aspartame,49 with a 40% increase in the number of seconds per hour of EEG recording that the children spent in spike-wave discharge. The report was published in the May 1992 issue ofNeurology, Vol42, page 1000. In other words, aspartame has an effect on the electrical activity of the brain in humans. The ieport also revealed that \"aspartame might be a proconvulsant, lowering the threshold for chemically induced convulsions.\" A True Life Story of the Effect of Aspartame on the Unborn Child A very interesting report was published in the Fall 1989 issue of the Association of Birth Defect Children, Vol 14, relating the story of Karen Mills in Georgia. Her son Brandon was born with serious neurological impairment and developmental delays. Karen was exposed to excessive doses of aspartame and phenylaliie during her pregnancy. \"According to my obstetrician, I had a very normal pregnancy. .I was in very good health, did not smoke, drink alcohol or take any drugs. I had a prenatal test to rule out any genetic bihd defects they can test for and had sonograms early and late in pregnancy. At the time of pregnancy, I had not seen any proof of hdl effects of aspartame and no comsumer warning was given on the use of NutraSweet products during pregnancy. In order to avoid sugar intake and weight gain, and the fatigue resulting after drinking sugared beverages, I chose to drink beverages containing NutraSweet. I drank on the average four to six 12-02 cans a day, including Diet 7-Up and Diet Coke, NutraSweet sweetened tea and lemonade. Six weeks into my pregnancy, I also started. taking capsules containing 500 to 1000 mg of phenylalinine a day, because I had read that this amino acid could help relieve fatigue. Brandon was born by C-section without any birth trauma or lack of oxygen. I was one week post fill-term and was not in labor when the C-section was done.\" \"Brandon has severe neurological problems, causing vocal chord paralysis and swallowing dysfunction. A heart condition was apparent at birth and decreased 49 At a dosage of 40mgkg.

His muscle spasms and vocal chord paralysis are caused by the brain signals to the muscles being \"static\" or distorted. He is also diaphoretic, meaning that he has excessive perspiration. Recently, Brandon has been diagnosed as severely retarded due to the severity of the neurological problem. He has had numerous MRI tests, CAT scans, X-rays, a genetics study, and blood tests. I am suspicious that NutraSweet could be a contributing factor in Brandon's situation since there are no physical or genetic causes revealed for his neurological problems. I hope than Brandon's situation can be a reason to focus more testing on NutraSweet regarding the possible effects it could have on a developing fetus during pregnancy.\" Senator Howard Metzenbaum was a very vocal critic of aspartame and has chaired hearings on its safety. Metzenbaum put Karen Mills in touch with Dr. Louis J. Elsas 11, the Director of Medical Genetics at Emory University School of Medicine. Dr. Elsas has co-authored numerous papers on aspartame research. According to Dr. Elsas, considering the amount of aspartame and phenylalinine Karen was taking, Brandon's developing brain cells could have been chronically exposed to 500-600uM phenylalinine. @hero-moles) The PKU Syndrome: New Evidence of Extended Genetic Effects It is well known that certain individuals are unable to metabolize phenylalinine in their diet. These people are termed phenylketoneurics, and the condition is termed an autosomal recessive diease called PKU. This condition causes excessive levels of phenylalinine to build up in the blood, which can damage the nervous system and cause retardation. Babies born with PKU must be placed on diets which restrict levels of phenylalinine found in the ordinary diet, and must avoid any products containing aspartame. About one in very 50 people carriers the gene for PKU, even if they do not have the disorder themselves. Whereas 20 million people in the United States have been assessed to have PKU, according to the genetic extension of the problem, as many as 50 million people may have a problem. Why? Because new research indicates that even if an unborn child does not have PKU, but carries the gene for the disease, he/she might be affected by excessive exposure to aspartame during prenatal development. If a woman who carries the gene for PKU marries a man with the same recessive gene, she could give birth to a baby with the condition. If she consumed too much aspartame during pregnancy, her baby could be born retarded. The most distrubing research of all is found in recently published studies of the effect of phenylalinine on the normal human brain. These studies show that elevated levels of phenylalinine cause significant, wide-spread EEG slowing in neurologically normal subjects. The effects are reversible when the phenylalinine levels are lowered. Additional research by Dr. Woodrow Monte, the director of the Food Science and Nutrition Lab at Arizona State University, shows that when aspartame breaks down in the body, it releases"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO methyl alcohol (a brain toxin) into the bloodstream.

Aspartame sensitivity for those Prone to Mood Disorders In 1993, a study was published in the Journal of Bzological Psychiatry, Vol 34, entitled \"Adverse Reactions to hl>EUtame: Double Blind Challenge in Patients from a Vulnerable Population\", done by Walton, Hudak and ree en-~aite\" . According to the study, \"the FDA and multiple clinical studies attest to its safety, yet reports of adverse reactions abound. It has been reported that 66% of such reactions involve neurologic or behavioral symptoms, particularly headaches. Two widely quoted studies that have failed to duplicate these reactions (Leone et al, 1988; Steinman and Kunkle, 1988) have been criticized on methodological ground, and because they were supported by grants fiom the NutraSweet Company.\" Anyway, back to the study: \"This study was designed to ascertain whether individuals with mood disorders are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of aspartame.

When they approached NutraSweet to obtain aspartame for the stuc&, the company refised to grve them any. They ended up purchasing analytically certified USP grade aspartame from Schweizerhall, Inc in Piscataway, New Jersey. The statement that \"the FDA and mutiple clinical studies attest to safety, yet reports of adverse reactions abound,\" ought to tell you something right away. That the FDA conducted no studies of its own but based its approval on corporate intimidation is a known fact. Why else would two top FDA officials, after going along with the program, go to work either for Searle, or a Searle-connected company? ?'he-fact that according to a \"Senate investiaation \" this constituted \"no impro~ietv\" suaaests either somethina is seriouslv wrona with the ystem. or that a cover-uv and criminal conmirant exists. or &&. The \"clinical studies\" were bought and paid for by NutraSweet. Two of those bought-and-paid-for studies, Leone et a1 (1988) and Schiffinan et al (1987) are often quoted as attesting to the safety of the compound. There are plenty of studies that do not attest the the safety of this compound. Now, when one examines the Leone study of 1988 that was fbnded by Searle, it is presented as a \"long-term\" study. So is the Searle-hded study of Schihan, although they consider \"long term\" as being \"1 or 2-day challenges\". Data in the Walton study showed that most symptoms begin to appear afrer the time period. represented by the studies that attest to safety have tran~pired.~' This means that tests hnded by Searle which attempt to show the safty of aspartame are rigged to avoid the period when effects manifest themselves - this is of course fraudulent research, over and above the conflict of interest factor. Data from the Walton report reveals that 63% of the depressed patients expreienced memory loss with aspartame (0% on the placebo), 75% of the patients experienced an increase in nausea, 25% reported an increase in temper, 37% experienced an increase in depression. In the patients with pre-existing depression, with no change produced by a placebo, 13% exerienced the manifstation of negative thought pattern, a This presents an interesting parallel to the Evidentiary Standards for Vaccine Damage Compensation, which spec@ cut-off periods for adverse vaccine reactions that are less than known time periods in which adverse reactions occur.

Use of Aspartame By Pharmaceutical Companies Aspartame is not only used in food, per se, but is also used in pharmaceutical products.

In the study, seven infant monkey's were fed aspartame mixed with milk. One died after 300 days and five others experienced grand mal seizures. Searle deleted the negativefindirig before they submitted Dr. Waisman's study to the FDA as evidence of aspartame's safety. Later in 1975, when an FDA Investigative Task Force discovered that Searle had withheld information, Searles incredible and convoluted reply was that \"the' study was done by an independent scientist and therefore was not valid,\" and that \"there was no evidence that aspartame caused seizures.\" The conceDt that safety studies done by manufacturers are not valid never entered the picture. The fact of the matter iS that studies on safety must be done by independent unconnected scientists in order to be valid. One gets the impression that the hierarchy at Searle must have been sucking on too much aspartame to come up with the convoluted logic they use as an excuse to poison the population. Dr. Waisman \"died unexpectedly\" in March of 1971, before he could complete all of his studies. However, the testing that was doneby him was considered \"pivotal\" by the FDA in 1975 that it prompted the creation of the aforementioned Task Force. As one might expect, the FDA \"lost all interest\" in Waisman's work by 1980. After Waisman's untimely and unexpected death, Searle awarded a grant to Ann Reynolds \"to do a primate study to refute Waisman's findings.\"\" However, Reynolds only evaluated aspartic levels in plasma and not aspartame neurotoxicity or seizure potential, which reflected Waisman's actual findings. Evidently, the conspiracy was too much, because Reynolds rehsed to testify at Congressional Hearings. Because the use of primates was a key to uncovering the damaging potential effect of aspartame on humans, primates were never used again in subsequent tests paid for by Searle. Most of the studies subsequently submitted to the FDA used rodents, which must be fed sixty times more aspartame to approximate the equivalent intake effe~ in humans, '2 Dr. Waisman is a physician, biochemist and professor of matrics at the University of Wisconsin, a Director of the University's Laboratories for Mental Retardation Research and an expert on PKU. 53 If a company manufactures a product which is independently found to be harmful, and then pays for a fraudulent study to prove it isn't hannful, isn't that a criminal conspiracy as defined by Blacks? Of course."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO over and above the fact that rodent metabolism is different than humans and biochemical effects cannot accurately be extrapolated to reflect human exposure. Rodent physiology is geared toward the consumption of substances that would immediately damage humans, so it takes more of some substances to affect them. What affects a rodent will affect a human even more. In 1970, the FDA banned cyclamates. It was also a time when the subject of Saccharin was under public discussion, leaving a gap to be filled by aspartame. In 1971, Dr. John 0lneyS4 informed Searle that aspartic acid caused holes in the brains of mice he was testing. Ironically, Ann Reynolds, the researcher hired by Searle to refbte Waisman's research work, confirmed Olney's work in a similar study. She would not work for Searle again. Dr. Olney and consumer-interest attorney James Turner met with Searle representatives in early 1974 to discuss Olney's 1971 study. The Searle representatives, in characteristic convoluted logic, grounded in conspiratorial denial, stated that Olney's animal studies \"raised no health problems.\" Later in 1974, the FDA \"approved the \"limited use\" of aspartame on humans. Searle did not even notify the FDA of Olney's tests until afrer the FDA \"approved NutraSweet. In fact, no tests were submitted to the FDA by Searle that would have ruled out neurological damage. In other words, the FDA approved aspartame even though it had not been proved safe for human consumption. This violated the FDA's own internal policy that it must be established \"to the FDA's satisfaction\" that a product is safe for human consumption. Searle had one or more moles in the FDA. It is clear that the FDA was intimidated into becoming a willing partner in this aspect of the plan to neurologically damage the world population to stimulate allopathic corporate profits. It still is a willing partner today. In contrast to David Kessler's comment that the FDA is the \"arbiter of truth\", they are and continue to be the arbiter of lies, deceit and criminal conspiracy. Searle had submitted 13 tests in an attempt to establish that aspartame did not cause genetic damage, but memos from public records show that FDA scientists who reviewed the tests found serious deficiencies in all of them. These same FDA scientists, some who have been mentioned previously, were pushed aside. The FDA then violated the public trust and announced that \"the tests could be relied on to establish the safety of aspartame,\" despite the fact that documents clearly show the admissions of existing problems with the Searle research and the veracity of the tests. After approval was granted in 1974, certain factions in the FDA became suspicious because of the appearance of adverse side effects in the population. It is this suspicion that led to the 1975 Hearings. The 1975 FDA Task Force on Aspartame The 1975 Task Force was formed, headed by the FDA lead investigator, Philip Brodsky, and assisted by FDA toxicologist Dr. Adrian Gross. They were assigned the \" ~r.0lne~ was a research psychiatrist at the Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine. 151"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"examination of the original test materials submitted by Searle. After 16 months of investigation, they submitted a 15,000 page document with a summary of over 80 pages. According to the report of the Task Force, \"we have uncovered serious deficiencies in Searle's integrity in conducting high quality animal research to accurately determine or characterize the toxic potential of its products. We have found instances of irrelevant or unproductive animal research where experiments have been poorly conceived, carelessly executed or inaccurately analyzed or reported. The cumulative findings of problems within and across the studies we investigated reveal a pattern of conduct which compromises the scientzjic integrity of the studies.\" It has already been mentioned that Searle removed animals who developed tumors as a result of aspartame from the study, cut out the tumors and returned them to the study as \"healthy\". In most cases, the tumors were not even examined for malignancy or reported to the FDA. When questioned about these irregularities, SearIe representatives stated, \"these masses were in the head and neck areas and prevented the animals fiom feeding.\" Additionally, some of the tumors reported in the original autopsy notebooks were deleted from the final report submitted to the FDA. As mentioned before, animals first reported as dead were reported to be alive later. Ironically, the Task Force was only directed to discover whether Searle had lied about the data in its tests. They were not directed to examine the methodology since the FDA had already accepted the validity of the the tests. It was a useless exercise to politically appease certain factions who complained about the fraud. The results of the Task Force Investigation of Aspartame and several other Searle drugs were presented and discussed in a Senate Subcommittee on Labor and Public Welfare on April 8, 1976. Senator Edward Kennedy, a member of the Senate Subcommittee, stated \"the extensive nature of the almost unbelievable ranges of abuses discovered by the FDA on several major Searle products is profoundly disturbing.\" The FDA decided to investigate 15 other questionable studies submitted by Searle. This is when things began to break down. A five member FDA task force, headed by FDA inspector Jerome Bresler, were given three studies to examine. The other I2 studies were given to um5, a private group in Rockville, Mqland, to whom Searle had previously paid $500,000 to validate their studies, which guaranteed that the investigation on those 12 studies would be quashed. So, this means that whoever doled out the studies was part of the conspiracy to silence opposition to aspartame. The FDA team examining the three studies, however, came up with some very interesting conclusions. Some of the test animals had developed manu uterine tumors that Searle admitted were due to DKP, one of the breakdown products of aspartame. Some of the blood tests 55 Universities Associated for Research and Education in Pathology (UAREP). 152"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"by Searle had been falsified. Searle also claimed equipment breakdown was the reason that substituted results from unrelated everiments into the aspartame tests. It was also discovered later that UAREP pathologists charged with examining test results withheld negative findings ?om the FDA. In 1977, the FDA requested that U.S.Attorney Samuel Skinner conduct a Grand Jury investigation of the tests on aspartame and Aldactone, both Searle products. We explained before what transpired with Skinner, who removed himself from the case within 60 days of the assignment and announced his upcoming employment with Searle's law firm. The Justice Department had instituted proceedings against Searle in 1975 based on findings in animal studies for Flagyl and Aldactone, both of which involved false reporting of tumorogenic properties. Both drugs are still on the market today, causing malignant tumors in the population and profits for the medical-pharmaceutical complex. Dr.Marvin Legator, Director of Environmental Toxicology at the University of Texas, who helped pioneer the mutagenicity testing at the FDA, is quoted as saying \"all of the Searle tests are scientificallv irresponsible and dismacehl.\" IronicalZv. the FDA used guidelines recommended bv Searle in develovina the indusq-wide FDA standma% for Good Laboratov Practices. We also mentioned that William Conlon, Senior Assistant U.S. Attorney was assigned to the Searle case in 1977, took no action, and was subsequently employed by a firm working for Searle. Is Searle a front for a covert intelligence operation dabbling in science? How else could top government organizations be coerced into abandoning public safety? Is this why Searle was eventually purchased by Monsanto, a company with known connections to U.S. intelligence organizations? You decide. Mr. Thomas Sullivan was appointed U.S.Attomey on July 1, 1977 and took no action on the Seirle case, despite a letter fiom Richard Merrill, Chief Counsel to the FDA, reminding him of the repeated requests to start legal action against Searle. Also in 1977, Donald Rumsfeld, a former member of Congress and Chief of Staff in the Ford Adhrinistration, was hired as the president of Searle. Rumsfeld said he could handle aspartame as a \"legal, rather than scientific problem.\" In 1980, shortly after Reagan came into power, Rumsfeld was quoted as saying that \"he would call in all of his markers and that no matter what, he would see to it that aspartame would be approved that year.\" It sounds like a criminal intelligence operation and racketeering to me. Why would they want to distribute a chemical with known neurotoxic effects, \"no matter what\", into the food supply of the world population? Rumsfeld was paid $3.5 million in salary and bonuses between 1979 and 1984. As president of Searle, Donald Rumsfeld hired John Robson as Executive Vice President of Searle. Robson was a former lawyer with Sidney and Austin, Searle's law firm, and also served as Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, then connected to the Department of Transportation. Rumsfeld hired Robert Shapiro, Robson's Special Assistant at the DOT, as General Counsel for Searle. He eventually became head of Searle's NutraSweet Division. Rumsfeld hired William Greener, Jr., a former spokesman in the Ford White House, as Chief Spokesman for Searle. What a crew."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"In 1978, Howard Roberts, the acting director of the FDA Bureau of Foods, was given the position of Vice-president of the \"National Soft Drink Association\", which today markets a huge volume of soft drinks doped with aspartame. Several interesting research projects having to do with aspartame came to a close in 1978. Some of them bore interesting results. Studies at the Department of Psychology, Northeastern Illinois University, found that (1) aspartame causes reproductive dysfunction in male and female animals, (2) aspartame causes endocrine dysfunction in the pituitary, thyroid, ovaries and testicles, (3) aspartame causes an increase in body weight and (4) it causes a decrease in locomotor function. The first two items appear to support a Malthusian population control paradigm, in that they interfere with the birth of humans to either preclude birth, or allow birth of disjknctional humans requiring medical intervention and profiteering by the medical industrial complex. The same year in 1978, the Proceedin~s of the National Academy of Sciences completed a study which revealed that aspartame causes a rise in blood phenylalinine which has the potential to affect fetuses of mothers who carry the PKU gene (we discussed part of this already), causing them to have a lower IQ and a higher incidence of developmental abnormalities. In 1979, an article was released in Science which pointed out that free methanol, (one of the internal breakdown products of aspartame) is linked to fetal alcohol syndrome and diminished intellectual capacity in newbom rats. Dumb that population down. An article in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1979 revealed that elevated levels of bloodphenylalinine levels in PKU women result in a high incidence of birth defects. It is interesting that Dr.Danie1 Azamoff, head of Searle's R&D Division, stated that rats eating \"the required amount\" of DKP (aspartame breakdown product) had a statistically significant number of tumors in their wombs. In 1980, the National Collaborative Study for Maternal PKU recommended that during pregnancy, blood phenylalirnine levels should not exceed 6 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. Translated, a 150 pound pregnant woman should not receive more than 409 mg of phenylalimine per day. In truth, she should not receive any, but we'll put that astute observation aside for the moment. Over 20 years earlier in 1963, researchers Kang and Paine reported in the Journal of Pedzatrics that normal metabolism is altered during pregnancy and phenylalinine may rise to triple pre-conception levels. Within three years, the FDA would raise the minimum acceptable daily intake of aspartame to an amazing 50 mgkglday, which translates to 17 cans of diet drink for a 150 pound person - an amazing 3,230 mg of aspartame per day. A two-liter bottle of Diet Coke contains 1200 mg of aspartame. Back to the sequence of events. Meanwhile, Searle was pressing for an expanded use of aspartame, tiring of the \"limited use\" designation the FDA had given them. In 1980, during the administration of ex-CIA director George Bush, the FDA suggested that a Public Board of Inquiry be formed, made up of three scientists instead of the Administrative Law Judges normally used. A Public Board of Inquiry was impaneled in 1980, and it consisted of Peter J. Lampert, M.D., Professor and Chairman of the Department of Pathology at UCAL San"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Diego, Vernon R. Young, Ph.D., from the University of Nutritional Biochemistry at MIT, and the Chairman, Dr. Walle Nauta, Institute Professor at the Department of Psychology and Brain Science at MIT. The board said they had to rely on findings of the UAREP members of the 1977 Task Force because they were denied access to the complete Task Force reports by FDA ofJiciaZs. Intrigued with the misrepresentation and anecdotal reports of safety fiom Searle, and aggravated by an incompliant FDA, they voted unanimouslv to recommend banning amartme for human consumption. According to Dr. Nauta, \"the evidence suggested that aspartame might induce brain tumors. The fact that the legally required Public Board of Inquiry did their job properly and found aspartame to be potentially hazardous irritated everyone else, and a five-member \"Commissioners Team of Scientists\" was impaneled. Three members were asked to investigate the brain tumor issue and two others were asked to look at the problems of neurological damage, mental retardation and endocrine problems. After examining all the scientific data, these three members expressed serious concern because the data showed that aspartame caused all of these problems. The remaining two members, apparently without examining much data, expressed satisfaction that \"aspartame did not seem to cause any brain damage.\" This would have meant a majority opinion against aspartame for a second time in a row, which could not be tolerated, so a sixth member was \"appointed to the team, apparently to make it look like a deadlock. The end result was that three members who had actually examined the data pronounced aspartame dangerous and the remaining two members (and the add-on pro-aspartame yes-man) pronounced it \"safe\". This conspiratorial effort to achieve what appeared externally as a \"deadlock\" carried great weight in getting ''111 use\" of aspartame approved by the FDA. Not everyone was happy with the conspiracy. Dr. Jacqueline Verrett, whom we have mentioned before, was extremely critical of the way the \"review\" was done. She stated, \"it was pretty obvious that somewhere along the line, the Bureau officials were working up to a whitewash,\" and that \" the Bureau of Foods, under Howard Roberts, discarded or ignoredproblems and deficiencies outlined by the Team Report.\" In part, she stated \"It is unthinkable that any reputable toxicologist, giving a completely objective evaluation of the data resulting fiom the study, could conclude anything other than the study was uninterpretable and worthless, and should be repeated, as the sqfety questions remain unanswered.\" Sounds like a criminal conspiracy to me. Despite the effort to get Searle's petition for \"111 use\" approved, it was denied in 1980. It is interesting that the effect of both aspartame, aspartate (a salt of aspartic acid) and glutamates (ie., MSG) may not be apparent until the cumulative effect breaches a physiological threshold. At least, that is what the scientific evidence seems to indicate. A report released in 1980, published in NeurobehavioraZ Toxicology and entitled \"Brain Damage in Mice from Voluntaxy Inyestion of Glutamate and As~artate\" revealed that aspartate is glutamate's close structural analog: \"We cannot take comfort, therefore, in the fact that humans have been exposed for many years without apparent harm. If harm did"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"occur, we would not detect it except perhaps years later, in the fonn of obesity or neuro- endocrine disturbances such as are known to occur in rodents following glutamate treatment in infancy.\" Searles strategy would become obvious the next year. After a 1981 memo fiom Satya Dubey, a Senior FDA Statistician, that stated, \"the brain tumor data was so worrisome that he could not recommend approval of NutraSweet\", Dr. Arthur Hayes, Jr was appointed the new FDA Commissioner by the new President, Ronald Reagan. After Reagan was in office, Searle resubmitted its request for \"full use\" on the human population. Oddly, Reagan himself voiced doubts about aspartame. He was quoted as saying, \"we quit using the stuff 'cause we don't know what's in it.\" It would appear that Reagan wasn't the only one historically confused. In the push for approval, Searle's own representatives couldn't get their stories straight. Denise Ertell, Searle's Public Agairs Director, said \"Phenylalinine is a fermentation by-product of soybeans and corn, and aspartic acid is a total synthesis fiom hydrocarbons, petrochemical derivatives\". This is interesting, because Fairbanks and Copel, nutrition counselors for Burson Marsteller, Searle's Public Relations finn, said that \"neither one is a petroleum derivative\". Gerry Gaul, Searle's Vice-president of Nutrition and Medical AfTairs, said, \"Phenylalinine might not come fiom soybeans and corn.\" What a crew. So, in 1981, Reagan appointee Arthur Hayes overruled the Public Board of Inquiry's recommendation that \"aspartame not be approved for marketing until further animal testing was conducted to resolve the brain tumor issue\", and granted Searle approval of aspartame for use in dry foods and as a table sugar substitute, ignoring the fact that, according to law, if tests are found to be inconclusive, an additive is not supposed to be approved by the FDA. Hayes cited as supporting research a study done by a Japanese firm, Ajinomoto, who was a Searle licensee, just@ his decision, even though this study had never been reviewed or examined. Commissioner Hayes violated the law and public trust and became an accessory to criminal conspiracy and criminal neglrgence. Approval of the use of aspartame worldwide in 60 countries is based on the fiaudulent tests conducted by Searle. Searle and the FDA frequently point to the fact that aspartame has been \"approved in 60 countries\" and by the notorious World \"Health\" Organization as evidence of safeq. Robert Shapiro, head of NutraSweet, confirmed that the approvals had \"essentially\" been based on the inconclusive and controversial tests that Searle had submitted to the FDA. Dr. Alexander Schmidt, FDA Commissioner from 1972 to 1976, said in a 1984 interview that \"Searle's tests were poorly conceived, carelessly executed and inaccurately reported \" So, it would appear that the allopathic medical facilities in 60 countries and the WHO are part and parcel of the effort to neurologically \"stick it\" to the world population. All of this is quite plausible, based on the total picture of evidence presented historically in all of the paradigms. As previously mentioned in the beginning of the discussion on aspartame, the FDA approval of aspartame as a \"food additive\" makes it exempt ?om continued safety monitoring (thus insuring the coverup), and Searle (and its parent company Monsanto) is"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"not obligated to monitor adverse reactions associated with NutraSweet, not submit reports to the FDA or anyone else of such adverse reactions. By 1985, over 16,000,000 pounds of this biochemical warfare compound had been added to the world food supply. Since it was originally \"discovered\" while searching for a \"new ulcer m', aspartame obviously falls into the categorically of a drug. FDA criteria which defines a drug includes anything that \"structurally or functionally affects the body or mind\". So, aspartame is a drug that has had its label as a drug removed in order to ensure its addition to the world food supply. According to a memo dated August 20, 1973, by Martha M. Freeman, M.D., FDA Division of Metabolic and Endocrine Drug Products, sent to Dr. C.J. Kokosi, Division of Toxicology, concluded that the administration of amartame, as reported in studies a hiph dosape levels for prolonaed oeriocis. constitutes clinical investipational use of a new drup substance. In 1982, Senator Heflin, Chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, proposed an amendment altering laws covering the U.S. Patent extension for aspartame. Senator Hatch led a five minute discussion on the Senate floor advocating the extension. The Patent for NutraSweet was extended by an amendment to the Orphan Drug Act, enacted specifically with Searle in mind. It is no secret that Senator Robert Byrd, who brought the amendment up for vote on Heflin's behalf, Representative Henry Waxman, who sponsored the Orphan Drug Act, Senator Orrin Hatch, and Senator Howard Heflin all received campaign contributionsfrom Searle, maker of aspartame. In 1983, the National Soft Drink Association, dedicated to putting sugar and phosphoric acid into human physiology, had a momentary attack of conscience and wrote to the FDA, \"warning\" them that aspartame breaks down in unexplained ways in warmer climates (a factor that would have later significance in the Persian Gulf War). Two months before FDA Commissioner Hayes left office (because of an investigation of his acceptance of gratuities from General Foods, a major user of aspartame), he' approved the use of aspartame in soft drinks. No firther resistance was heard from the National Soft Drink Association, who proceeded to include aspartame in all diet soft drinks. Upon leaving office, Hayes accepted a position as \"Senior Medical Advisor\" to Searles' Public Relations firm, Burson Marsteller, representing NutraSweet and seven major users of aspartame. Here in 1995, after 12 years, there is no surprise at the \"mysterious\" rise in brain disease all around the world, especially in the United States. It is certain that the aluminum ions leached off by the phosphoric acid in the soft drinks also contributes to this, as do the fluorides often present in the water to make the soft drinks. A real chemical cocktail for the brain. Will we end up with a nation where everyone expresses themselves like Dan Quayle? Probably. It is amazing how many FDA officials have taken jobs connected with the aspartame industry. In addition to all of the above, between 1979 and 1982, more FDA officials joined the club: S.M. Pape, Sherwin Gardner, Mike Taylor and Albert Kolbye, to name a few. Anthony Brunetti, the FDA Consumer Product Officer who drafted the notice"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO approving NutraSweet in soft drinks, later accepted a position with the Soft Drink Assn as a \"science writer.\" Arizona Legislature Bars State Regulation of Food Additives Preventing the Public from Excluding Dietary Neurotoxins In 1984 Dr. Woodrow Monte, whose report on aspartame is included in Matrix III, asserted that \"there are no human or mammalian studies to evaluate the possible mutagenic or carcinogenic effects of chronic intake of methyl alcohol (a component of aspartane. Dr. Monte attempted to force a petition on the state of Arizona to ban aspartame, but amazingly, the Arizona State Legislature used a rare maneuver to change State Law without public notice, barring state regulation of FDA-approved food additives. The measure passed under the misleading (and ironic) title of a \"Toxic Waste Bill.\" Dr. Monte's efforts to force Arizona restrictions on NutraSweet were crushed by Searle. Interestingly, Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt's former Chief of Staff. Andrew HeMitz, was hired by Searle as a lobbyist. So were Charles Pine, Roger Thies and David West. Between 1979 and 1984, Searle hired up to a dozen lobbyists. A UP1 inqury traced over $200,000 in campaign contributions relative to Arizona officials from Searle. Babbitt was later appointed as Secretary of the Interior in the Clinton Administration. By 1984, 7 million pounds of aspartame were being pumped into the bodies of Americans annually. The USDA estimated worldwide use at 82,950,000 pounds, with sales of $600 million. In 1984, aspartame was approved for use in children's chewable vitamins (as if the chlorinated and fluoridated water, sugar, vaccines, and diet drinks weren't enough). By 1985, sales reached over $1 billion. Sale figures for aspartame are no longer available to the public. In 1987, NutraSweet petitioned the FDA for approval to insert aspartame in baked goods and to supply it for baking uses. The petitiion is still pending. The company claims it has perfected a way to stop aspartame from breaking down under oven temperatures. If they have, it must be composed of an entirely new chemical structure - a structure that has not been approved for human use by the FDA. The \"Aspartame Technical Committee\" The infamous ATC consists of NutraSweet Company, Ajinomoto Company (Searle's Japanese licensee), Coca Cola Company, Pepsico, Royal Crown Cola Company, Seven-Up, General Foods and other manufacturers and users of aspartame, who grant research funding for the purpose of generating fraudulent assurances of safety for aspartame. The International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), a tax-exempt group awarding grants to research scientists, is also involved. Samuel Molinary, Co-Chairman of ILSI's Panel, is Searle's former Director of Scientific Affairs and is now a research director for Pepsico. Peter Dews, a Harvard University psychology professor named to ILSI's original Board of Trustees in 1978, has served as an ILSI consultant ever since. Dews has stated that NutraSweet is safe."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Research Studies Beginning in 1984 In 1984 the FDA, Dr. Richard Wurtman (Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT) and Dr. Woodrow Monte (Director of Science and Nutrition Laboratory at Arizona State University) received over 1,000 complaints relative to aspartame consumption. The most numerous complaints were dizziness, visual impairment, disorientation, ear buzzing, pancreatitis, tunnel vision, loss of equilibrium, severe retinal hemorrhaging, menstrual flow changes and depression. In 1985, Dr. Louis J. Elsas, M.D. (Director of Medical Genetics, Emory University School of Medicine) did a study which found the effects of phenylalinine on two groups ranging in age from 8 to 24 years involved interference with reaction time, and also reduced the uroduction of adrenaline-like chemicals in the brain. He stated that both premant women and infants should not consume -fad contain in^ aspartame because of the deer of it causinp brain damage to the _fetus or infant. Keith Comers, M.D, (from the Children's Hospital in Washington, D.C) reported a case of two children suffering extreme agitation when consuming the amount of aspartame equivalent in a 6 oz serving of Kool-Aod sweetened with NutraSweet. Dr. Roger A. Colombe (fiom the Center for Environmental Toxicology, Utah State University) demonstrated in a study that it is possible for aspartame to produce nervous Vstem and behavioral effects, particularly in children and susceptible individuals. Dr. Ronald Gautieri and Dr. Michael Mahalik (fiom the Department of Psychology, Temple University) demonstrated in a study that aspartame produced brain dysfunction in newborn mice. William Pardridge, M.D. (fiom the University of California, Los Angeles), together with Dr. Richard Wurtman, testified before a Senate Cornmitee on Labor and Human Resources, urging that labeling requirements for aspartame be amended to include quantity, maintaining that children might suffer brain damage fiom excessive intake of aspartame. Aspartame consumed at the same time as carbohy&ates would have double the eflect on the brain as cwpartame alone. In 1986, Dr. William Pardridge restated that the two constituent amino acids in aspartame, aspartic acid and phenylalinine, are neurotoxic, and that there is a drop in IQ of babies born to mothers with elevated phenylalinine levels. In 1986, the Quarterly Report from the Department of Health and Human Services reflected approximately 3,000 known complaints about aspartame, mostly relating to brain function and behavior, that have been evaluated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control (and Prevention - recently added in 1995). A 1986 issue of Food Chemical News revealed that the Community Nutrition Institute petitioned the FDA to ban the use of aspartame, presenting many cases of seizures and visual problems. The petition was denied. In 1987, James Turner, a comsumer interest attorney, stated \"individual scientists cannot do their best and most objective work when financially beholden to the companies who stand to make millions or billions of dollars based on the outcome of their research.\" One Searle-supported aspartame researcher is reported to have received $1.3 million for his laboratory. 159"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The General Prevalence of Mood Disorders in the General Population We have seen that aspartame, besides creating mood disorders, has an especially severe effect on those who have preexisting mood disorders, including depression. How prevalent are mood disorders in the United States alone? How many people could be affected just on that account? An interesting study was conducted by the Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, the National Institute of Medical Health, Duke University Medical Center and the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital in support of the National Depression Screening Day Project.' One of the operative methods of surveying the degree of depression in the general population was to set up an automated telephone screening survey. The survey lasted two weeks. A total of 1,812 participants called the system. Of these, 278 were students and faculty at a large midwestern state university, 725 were employees of a large northeastern high-technology firm, and 809 did not identify which site they were calling fiom. The telephone questionnaire was hlly automated and utilized touch-tone responses, and consisted of a 20 question multiple choice Zung Depression Scale. No technical problems were experienced during the two week survey. Of the 1812 callers, 1597 (88.1%) completed all questions. Of these, 522 callers (32.7%) met criteria for minimal or mild depression, 412 callers (25.8%) met criteria for \"moderate or marked\" depression and another 194 (12.1%) met criteria for 'Severe or extreme\" depression. The majority of callers scoring positive for depression had received no previous treatment for depression. The AMA analysis of the survey yielded the observation that the rate of positivity for depression was 70.6% of the people contacted. This percentage was compared to the 1993 studies conducted under the program, which yielded an amazing 76.6%. By extrapolation, out of a total population of 250 million in the United States, over 187 million people would potentially qualify as meeting the criteria for depression. Most of the population of the United States is potentially suffering fiom mild to severe emotion depression. If the rate was even 20%, that would involve over 50 million people. As the allopathic system treats symptoms instead of causes, self- responsibility (adjusting nutritional intake) is the only thing that will make a real difference in people's lives. The chemical cocktail known as the \"diet\" must be abandoned and replaced by a healthy regimen. In the United States, depression is a considered by allopathy as being a major mental health problem, with an estimated cost to the United States alone in 1990 of approximately $43.7 billion, which is approximately equal to the economic burden of coronary heart disease. According to the American Medical Association, the cost to the health care system of lack of recognition of depression is high, since depressed patients are among the highest users of health care in the United states.' The implications relative to the high use of aspartame in the U.S. alone are immense.

ABSTRACT Aspartame (L-aspanyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester). a new sweetener marketed under the trade name NutraSwecte, releases into the human bloodstream one molecule of methanol for each molecuic of aspartame consumed. This new methanol source is being added to foods that have considerably reduced caloric content and. thus, may be consumed in large amounts. Generally, none of these foods could be considered dietary methanol sourccs prior to addition of aspartame. When diet sodas and soft drinks, swmened with aspartame, are used to replace fluid loss during exercise and physical exertion in hot climates. the intake of methanol can exceed 250 mgl day or 32 times the Environmental Protection Agency's recommended limit of consumption for this cumulative toxin'. There is extreme variation in the human response to acute methanol poisoning, the lowest recorded lethal oral dose being 100 mg/ kg with one individualsurviving a dose over ninety times this levelu. Humans. due perhaps to the loss of two enzymes during evolution. are more sensitive to methanol than my laboratory animal; even the monkey is not generally accepted as a suitable animal modeP. There are no human or mammalian studies to evaluate the possible mutagenic. teratogenic. or carcinogenic effects of chronic administration of methyl alcohoPJ. Tbe average intake of methanol from natural sourcrs varies but Limited data suggests an average intake of considerably leu than 10 rng/dapy'. Alcoholics may average much more. with a potential range of between 0 and 600 mg/ day, depending on the sourct and in some cases the quality of their beverageslJ. Ethanol the chic antidote for methanol toxicity, is found in natural food sources of methanol at concatrations 5 to 500.000 tima that of the toxin (Table I). Ethanol inhibits metabolism of methanol and allows the body time for clearance of the toxh through the lungs and kidney+f. The question asked is whether uncontrolled consumption of this new sweetener might increase the methanol intake of amin individuals to 8 point beyond which our limited knowledge of acute and chronic human methanol toxicity can beextrapolated to predict safety. *NuuJmt is a trademark of G.D.

Table 1 shows that under normal conditions these individuals would only be expected to consume between 1 and 7 mg of methanol a day from these sources. Even if an individual consumed two juices in the same day or a more exotic juice such as black currant, there would still be some protection afforded by the ethanol present in these natural juices. Conrumption of aspartame swcttcned drinks at levels commonly used to replace lost fluid during exercise yields methanol intake between 15 and 100 tima these normal intakes (Table 1). This is comparable to that of Winos\" but without the metabolic rcpr~eve afforded by ethanol. An alcoholic consuming 1500 calories a day from alcoholic sources alone may consume between 0 and 600 mg of methanol each day depending on his choice of beverages (Table 1). The concumption of aspaname sweetened soft drinks or other beverages is not limited by either calories or osmolanty. and can equal the daily water loss of an individual (which for active people In r state like Arizona can exceed 5 Liters).

Glutamates can cause a nerve to swell 90 seconds after contact. The mechanism for this is not entirely clear, but it is generally thought that exposure to glutamates causes a calcium influx in the nerve cell. The most common glutamate used in food is monosodium glutamate (MSG), one of the world's most widely used food additives. According to Dr. John Olney, a psychiatrist at Washington University in St.Louis, 'bver twenty years ago glutamate was show to cause brain damage to infant animals. Since then, it has become increasingly evident that glutamate and closely related substances are neurotoxins that can cause human neurodegenerative disease^.\"'^ As mentioned previously, MSG in combination with aspartame can be especially damaging. Not only may glutamates and aspartates cause degenerative nerve damage in adults, but there is growing evidence that the immature brain in children is more vulnerable than the brain of an adult since nerve myelination has not progressed very far. See the chapters on vaccines and vaccination. Monosodium glutamate was developed in 1908 by a Japanese chemist. In 1925 James E. Larrowe, who owned a milling company in the United States, contacted Suuki Spice Company in Japan for help in disposing of glutamate-containing waste water fiom sugar beet processing. Prior to 1918, glutamate waste water had been a source of industrial potash, but by 1925 it was beginning to pile up in waste tanks. Larrowe got no firm advice fiom Suzuki, so he went to Carnepje Mellon Institute of Industrial Research and also to Johns Ho~kins University where Dr. Elmer McCollum advised him to use the waste water to manufacture monosodium glutamate (MSG). Larrowe changed the name of his company to Amino Products Corporation, which was eventually sold to the International Minerals and Chemicals Company. By 1930, production of MSG in China reached 400,000 pounds per year. In 1933, Japanese production reached 10 million pounds per year. In 1948, the processed foods industry was introduced to MSG at a conference in Chicago as a solution to the problem of poor-tasting food containing other additives. Both the canned and fiozen food industries eventually became the largest users of MSG. One of the first major indications that something was seriously wrong with MSG occurred in 1957, when Dr.D.Newhouse and Dr. J.P.Lucas did rat studies which revealed that ingested glutamates result in rapid irreversible destruction of retinal cells. After the observation was validated, Dr. John Olney of Washington University did fbrther studies with rodents that revealed that MSG damages dendrites in the brain, causes damage to the hypothalamus, causes obesity, behavioral disturbances, endocrine changes, stunted bodies, seizures and infertility. If MSG could 'Solve\" the rodent population problem, it could also 56 Societyfor Neuroscience 19th Annual Meeting, Phoenix, Arizona, October 1989. 175"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"help 'Solve the population problem for humans\" - in theory, that is. Damage to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain critical for both memory and learning5', is unquestionable. MSG Effects on the Reproductive System Dr. Olney's discovery about how MSG affects the hypothalamus is extremely important, because the hypothalamus controls growth regulation, puberty onset, many of the endocrine glandsw, appetite, sleep cycles, waking patterns and the biological clock. Dr. Olney did other studies on various species of animals concerning MSG, and it was found that MSG, when fed in doses similar to that in human diets, destroys hypothalamic neurons. In animals, destruction of these neurons causes them to be short in stature and to have revroductive problems (MSG is therefore qualifies as a population control co- factor). Later experiments determined that MSG causes the hypothalamus to excrete excessive amounts of luteinizing hormone, associated with an early onset of puberty. Many of these endocrine efJects are not immediately apparent and manifest later. In 1968, the New EnglandJoumal of Medicine published a study on the effects of MSG in humans, a documented symptoms which included headache, flushing of the skin, asthma and life-threatening heart irregularities. The effect on humans also included extreme mood swings, irritability, depression and paranoia. In other words. MSG is technicallv a behavior modification hg. In 1969, Dr. Herbert Schamberg at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine began a careful study of MSG after cases of 'Chinese Restaurant Sydrorne\" began to manifest, with symptoms of tingling and tightness in the chest among those who ate Chinese food heavily laced with MSG. He discovered that symptoms can occur with ingestion of less than 3 grams. Schamberg published a paper in Science stating that MSG can 'produce undesirable effects in the amounts used in the preparation of widely consumed foods.\" Dr. Olney and others testified before Congress concerning the dangers of MSG. It was then than manufacturers decided to exclude MSG from baby foods in 1969. In 1974, Dr. Olney demonstrated that MSG, when fed to pregnant Rhesus monkeys, could cause brain damage to their ofl~prin~.~' Despite the fact that Congress was informed in 1969 that MSG could be hazardous to the developing human fetus, no action has been taken in the last 26 years by anyone, and MSG has been added in increasing amounts into human food.

Apparently, the amount of MSG in a single bowl of commercially available soup is enough to cause blood glutamate levels to rise higher in human childen than levels predictably causing brain damage in immature animals.5g The next major study of MSG was in 1977, when a noted researcher at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Lime Reif-Lehrer, conducted a study involving 1,529 people. More than 30% reported symptoms after consuming MSG-tainted food. Later in 1977, a questionnaire was published in the Proceedings for the American Society for werimental Biology which revealed that 30% of adults and 20% of children have some reaction to foods containing MSG. This points to the fact that billions of people are affected worldwide by MSG as its use is international. An account of MSG toxicity was published in the American Journal of Medicine in 1978 detailing the case histories of two persons who developed both physical and psvchiatric symptoms, including severe depression, whenever they ate foods containing MSG. It was revealed that emotional disturbances can begin within 48 hours after MSG is consumed. Many end up with symptoms being treated allopathically with psychotropic drugs. One of the most serious problems with MSG is the effect on children in schools. Along with artificial colors and flavorings, MSG simply adds to hyperactivity and other chemically caused behavioral problems already made worse by consistent vaccinations. There are no federal regulations or policies which prohibit the use of MSG in the National School Lunch program or any of the USDA federally fbnded programs. More than 80 million pounds of MSG are used yearly in the United States.

More on the Mechanism of Excitotoxin Effect on the Brain Processed human foods contain three primary brain cell toxins: glutamate, aspartate and cysteic acid. They are called excitotoxins because they 'kxcite\"neurons due to their chemical similarity to neurotransmitters. Natural variations of glutamate and aspartate are in fact found normally in the spinal chord, and are subject to a very delicate level within the body. Excess levels are immediately removed by counterbalancing mechanisms that transfer excess glutamate back into surrounding glial cells, which \" Olney, J.W., 'Excitotoxic Food Additives: Functional Teratological Aspects\" , Progressive Brain Research, Vol 18, 1988, p.283. It is important to note that an amount of MSG that raises blood glutamate level 20 times in a child only raises it fourfold in mice. AN initial glutamate studies were done with mice in order to minimize the appearance ofeflect on humans. All the while, scientists knew that MSG would contribute to the neural degeneration of the population. Furthermore, rhesus monkeys are more resistant to the effect of excitotoxins than mice or humans, because of the poor absorption of glutamate in monkeys."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO surround the neurons and supply them with energy. When the concentration rises above a critical level, they become neural toxins to cells containing receptors for them. Excessive glutamate levels will not only kill the neurons with the receptors for glutamate bur will also kzN any neurons that happen to be connected to it, even if that neuron uses .another type of receptor. This fact is very important relative to the contribution glutamates and aspartates make toward development of both Alzheimer's syndrome and Parkinson's disease. Experimental evidence has shown that within 15-30 minutes after being exposed to excessive levels of glutamate, such as that acquired by eating processed foods, neurons suspended in tissue culture swell up like balloons. The organelles begin to degenerate and the chromatin begins to clump. Within three hours these neurons are dead. However, when lower doses of MSG are used for two hours, and then removed, the cells remained viable for 18 to 24 hours, after which they suddenly died. Apparently, glutarnate acts as a trigger that opens the sodium channel on the cell membrane and allows calcium to enter the neuron, triggering an enzyme called phoqholipase C within the cell, which then triggers the release of arachidonic acid, damaging the cells interior. The arachidonic acid is attacked by two enzymes called lipoygenase and cyclo-oxygeenase, further triggering an explosive release of free radicals (superoxide and hydroxyl radicals) which brings on cell death. The normal concentration of antioxidants in the brain is not enough to handle the excess free radicals produced in this way. Since humans concentrate ingested glutamate in their plasma in higher concentrations than any other animal, this fact must figure into the equation as to why glutamates have been increasingly added to human processed food, despite scientiic evidence presented to Congress, in order to achieve the desired neurological degeneration in line with both Malthusian population reduction inandates, allopathic fund generation and neurological behavior modification programs. - Some Questions ... After reading extensive literature on the MSG problem, I have some questions. Why was the FDA pamphlet concerning 'konsumer facts about glutamate safety\" compiled and published by the Glutamate Association? Why was the phamphlet quietly withdrawn when this was pointed out? Why was the FDA Food Protection Committee composed of members who were finded by the food industry? Why did most of the committee members charged with investigating glutamate safety have strong financial ties to the glutarnate and food industry? Why are studies that purportedly demonstrate the safety of MSG end up in toxicology journals that are editorially controlled by either the authors of those studies or their cronies? Why has the FDA accepted such studies uncritically? Because the effects of MSG are known, this equates to a criminal conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"MATRJX I11 - VOLUME TWO Fraudulent Testing for Safety of Glutamates In 1971 a Dr. W.A. Reynolds and coworkers published a report that they were \"unable to confirm Dr. Olney's previous findings\" that MSG fed to infant monkeys consistently resulted in injuries to specific areas of the hypothalamus. They maintained that large doses of MSG fed to newborn monkeys \"had no toxic effect\" on infant monkey brains. Dr. Olney became suspicious of the study because in his experience, large doses of MSG fed to animals always caused the animals to vomit. No mention was made in the Reynolds study indicating any vomiting. If there was in fact vomiting, it would invalidate the study because the MSG would not have been absorbed. Later at a public hearing, Dr. Olney asked Dr. Reynolds if the monkeys in her study vomited up the MSG. In fiont of a large audience, she admitted that the monkeys had done so. Yet, when Reynolds report appeared some months later in Science magazine, the publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, no mention of the vomiting was made. A cover up was in progress. Dr. Olney wrote Science magazine asking why thus vital data was omitted. They refered his latter to Dr. Reynolds. This time, she denied that the animals had ever vomited. In 1975, Reynolds published another paper admitting that the monkeys had vomited after feeding them large doses of MSG, and also asmitting that these monkey's were under anesthesia for the experiment using phencyclidine. It is a well known scientific fact that phencyclidine is one of the most potent known antagonists for glutamate receptors, and is known to totally prevent MSG lesions of the hypothalamus, resulting in total invalidation of Reynolds experiment. Furthermore, slides taken by Reynolds of monkey brain tissue were taken @om areas of the brain known to be not affected by MSG. Reynolds used these photographs to offer \"proof' that MSG was safe. In all probability the Reynolds study was paid for by the food industry, who stands to loose a great deal of money should the truth be known about MSG.

The petition asks that consumers have full disclosure of the MSC in foods and that groups considered by FDA to be most at risk from MSG consumption receive appropriate cautionary information. MSG is a food additive with many reported harmful side effects, some of which can be debilitating, or life threatening. According to the petitioners, the FDA has ignored public health concerns in ever of the food industry. Spobperson for the group, Jack Samuels, himself MSC-sensitive, stated that it haS been identified with far more ill effects than merely the \"post-restaurant syndrome\" experienced by many. MSG, which has been found to be used in large quantities in some restaurants as a flavor enhancer, may cause tingling, tightness, numbness, headache, diarrhea or fatigue within two hours after eating in as much as a third of the population. However, some may suffer life-threatening reactions including severe asthma, heart fibrillation, and severe depression. Many people do not recognize where the source of their symptoms originated. Reactions to MSG are dose-related, i.e., some people react to even very small amounts of MSG while others usually only react to larger quantities. The FDA has been aware of complaints about MSG sensitivity since 1%8. Indeed, FDA does require that MSG be labeled as monosodium glutamate when added to food in its 99% pure form. However, most of the MSG used in foods is below the 99% concentration level, permitting it to be labeled as \"natural flavor,\" 'flavoring\" or some other term that does not adequately warn people that MSG is present. The goal of the petition is to incite the FDA to take immediate action to change its regulations pertaining to MSG, requiring that all food labels list the amount of MSG present, accompanied by a simple caution to those groups most at risk The following caution was recommended by the group: \"CAUTION: this product contains monosodim glutamate (MSG) and may adversely affect pregnant women, infants, childml, wonten of child bearing age, and individuals with affitioe (mood) disorders.' The MSG caution that the petitioners advocate precisely mirrors the conclusions and recommendations of the FDA's 1992 FASEB MSG study. MSG has no nutritional value and it has never been determined to be safe in any FDA proceeding.

Most of these substances have been developed since World War I1 and include pesticides, growth and sexual stimulant hormones, insecticides, tranquilizers, radioactive isotopes, herbicides, antibiotics, appetite stimulants, and larvicides. What happens when these enter the human body when these animals are eaten? The FDA allows thousands of unapproved drugs to be sold for veterinary use on animals destined for human consumption. Some drugs identified as causing tumors in animals have been allowed by the FDA to be used by farmers. According to Dr. Gerald Guest, director of the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine, a provision of the Delaney anti-cancer clause of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act stipulates that \"a carcinogenic compound can be used in food-producing animals if the drug will not harm the animals and no residue of the compound will be found in any edible tissues of the animal when tested by the approved methods.\" However, in many cases, no methods for monitoring the retention of drugs in animal tissues were sensitive enough to detect low levels of chemical contamination. Now that analytical methods have become more advanced, the Delaney anti-cancer clause is getting in the way. Hence, the tendency of the government to hover between laxity and negligence with regard to this matter. At the beginning of 1986, the House Government Operations Subcommittee accused the FDA of failing to protect consumers fiom traces of veterinary drugs in meat, dairy products and eggs, of neglecting its legal obligations by allowing the sale of thousands of unapproved animal drugs, and of failing to restrict or ban some drugs identiied & causing tumors in animals. The Subcommittee recommended that the FDA \"establish an independent office to insure that regulations regarding animal drugs were implemented and failed to indict anyone or hold the FDA or the government accountable for decades of laxity in this manner. The Use of Hormones on Animals Used for Human Food In the United States cattle industry, six hormones have been sanctioned by the government for use with animals destined to be consumed by humans. All are designed to increase the growth rate of animals in order to maximize profit. Three hormones are natural human hormones, specifically testosterone, progesterone and estradiol. They are injected under the skin in order to provide a time-release action. One hormone genetically engineered Known as bovine somatotropin or bovine growth hormone (BGH), it is produced by Monsanto, American Cyanamid and two other companies, and came under public scrutiny around 1989. It is still the subject of heavy debate. The two remaining hormones, zeranol and trenbolone, are also synthetic.

The FDA maintains that BGH is safe \"because is is produced by the cows pituitary gland and has always been present in milk.\" Yes, but the BGH produced is genetically engineered, and there is no reliable scientific unbiased data available on human safety. Tests for safety done by manufacturers who stand to make a large financial profit are not considered to be valid as they constitute a conflict of interest. Considering the testimony from the FDA veterinarian, published in the New York Times, we have another problem here. Premature Sexual Maturation of Human Children Due to the Use of Veterinary Hormones In 1982, two years after the Reagan-Bush administration was elected, the February issue of the Journal of the Puerto Rican Medical Association reported on a growing number of cases of premature sexual development of children, which included cases of children from one to five years old, male and female, with enlarged breasts, accelerated puberty, vaginal bleeding in five year old girls, and other similar problems. If this happened to one of your children, how would you They discovered that when they took these children off meat and fiesh milk, the symptoms would often regress. According to the report, it was \"clearly observed in 97% of the cases that the appearance of abnormal breast tissue was related to the consumption of whole milk in the infant group and to the consumption of local whole milk, poultry and beef in the older group. Obviously, regulations regarding livestock are not as well enforced in Puerto Rico as in other parts of the United States, so the dose might have been higher, but these substances are also present in varying quantities in all meat, egg and dairy products in the continental United It is apparent by the research reports that the concept of drugs and other substances in animals affecting humans has been known about for almost 30 years, yet these substances and many more are added to animal feed and injected into animals today in the United 40 Dr.Gary Smith, Department of Animal Science, Texas A&M University.

It also tends to cut down on the population, which is one of the premises of Matrix HI, especially the second volume herein. Even in the continental United States, we are seeing more and more premature sexual development in our children. Along with this, doctors are also seeing an expanding assortment of sexual abberations. Other countries are also experiencing the same trend. Analysis of the problem in Britain resulted in the determination that hormone traces in the meat of chemically fattened livestock are causing British school girls to mature sexually at least three years earlier than in the past. Invariably, doctors (not knowing what the problem really is) blame the problem on a &sfirnction of the child's endocrine system, which is not the case at all. The problem does not stop with children. Both adults and children in the United States are experiencing a plethora of behavior disorders connected to uncertain and confirsed sexual identities that arise partiallyjkom externally iduced hormonal imbalances. We are seeing an increase in sexual abuse of children.

This is discussed in another chapter. DES and Its Effect on Humans After World War 11 diethylstilbestrol (DES), a female hormone, was introduced into the livestock industry to artificially fatten cattle, chickens and turkeys between 1947 and 1959, when its use was technically banned. You might remember that DES was responsible for incredible birth defects some years ago in humans. Since DES provided an easy way to increase the profits of the meat industry, it was hailed as a \"miracle\". 'The fact that farmers who used DES on their animals came down with symptoms of impotency, infertility, elevated and tender breasts, and changes in their voices was ignored. Despite this, tons of DES were administered routinely to animals whose flesh is destined for human consumption. It was discovered that DES causes cancer. Lab animals developed cancer £tom daily doses of DES as low as one-quarter of a hundred-millionth of an ounce. Federal Drug Administration biochemist Jacqueline Verret reported that the National Cancer Institute was assuring Congressmen that \"it might be possible for only one molecule of DES in the 340,000,000,000,000 present in a quarter pound of beef liver to trigger han cancer. \"46 Indeed. 45 Eufopes concern about hormonal implants surfaced after a scandal in Italy in which a baby food maker injected hormones into beef, made baby food from it and babies of both sexes developed breasts. 46 Verret, J., and Carper, J., \"Eating May be Hazardous to Your Health \", Simon and Schuster, 1974, pg 170 Schell, O., Modem Meat, Vintage Books, Random House, 1985."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"After a fierce battle, it was finally made illegal to administer DES to livestock, but the meat industry continues to ignore the law, and does it anyway.

Antibiotic Drug Use in Animals and Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria in Humans There are approximately 750 drug products approved for use in food animal^.^' Antibiotics comprise a signrficant comer of the market, especially those approved for use in synthetically increasing the growth rate of animals. The scope of antibiotic use is absolutely stunning. Among the antibiotic drugs approved for use on animals are bacitracin4*, bambemycins, chlortetra~ycline~~, erythromycin, lincomycin, monensin, oleandomycin, oxytetracycline, tylosin, virginiamycin, penicillins0, tetmcyclineS1 , and nitrofiranss2 (nitrofirazone, firazolidone). Almost 50% of the antibiotics in use in the United States are used on animals.53 It is now known, but generally ignored by the FDA, USDA and food industry that the use of antibiotics with food animals results in the development of anti-biotic resistant bacteria, rendering human treatment with other anti- biotics ineflective. That is exactly what is happening out there, isn't it? Both animals and humans now have this new problem to deal with. The medical, pharmaceutical and food industries are literally \"making a killing.\" 47 About 30% of the chickens, 60% of the cattle and 80% of veal calves and pigs are routinely given drugs in their feed. 48 Bacitracin can cause an allergic cross-reaction in humans that may prevent the effective use of other antl'biotics for the treatment of infection, especially neomycin and streptomycin.

Research on the effect of Sulfamethazine on animals is distrubing. A study by the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) revealed that the substance, even in moderate doses, can cause thyroid cancer in rodents. Sulfamethazine has been used since the 1950's to treat the respiratory problems food animals acquired because of their living conditions and the effect of other drugs used on them. Sulfamethazine is supposed to be discontinued in animals at least fifteen days before slaughter, but evidence suggests this rule is not complied with. In 1988 the FDA informed manufacturers of Sulfamethazine that data from the NCTR was undergoing peer review. After the NCTR data passed review, FDA commissioner Dr. Frank Young stated that the FDA might either lower the legal limit for Sulfamethazine residues or decide that the use of Sulfamethazine in food producing animals was a heath hazard. So, the FDA knew in 1988 that Sulfamethazine was hazardous and could promote the development of thyroid cancer, and the carcinogenic drug has been in the food supply for about 40 years without opposition. Nothing happened for a year.

In Hopewell, Virginia, people suffered anxiety, tremors, and severe motor disturbances caused by the pesticide Kepone (chlordecone). All in all, these epidemics affected thousands of people and established clearly that toxic chemicals in the environment can cause neurolog7c andpsychiatric illnesses. Somewhere around 70,000 chemicals are used commercially. Research indicates that the effect of most of them is unknown, as they have never been assessed in terms of safety in the human environment. Several hundred are known to be neurotoxic. Less than 10% of the total number of chemicals in use have been tested for neurotoxicity, and resources are not available to perform these tests. The fact that 63,000 chemicals are permitted in the human environment without testing constitutes criminal negligence. Technically, neurotoxiciQ is the capacity of a chemical, biological, or physical agent to cause adverse finctional or structural change in the nervous system. According to current FDA standards, any substance that causes a functional or structure change in the systems of the body must be regulated (unless, in foods, it is designated an additive). The fact that these chemicals are not regulated, despite the presence of these regulations, translates to deliberate sanction of neurotoxic substances in the environment, which constitutes convincing proof of criminal conspiracy, criminal gross negligence, and criminal homicide on the part of the military, industrial, pharmaceutical and intelligence 'hdustries\", worldwide, against the planetary population, under color of law and government. Possible effects of biological and chemical toxicants on the nervous system are quite varied. Neurotoxicity can occur at any time in the life cycle, fiom gestation to old age, and its manifestations can change with age. The developing nervous system in the fetus, babies, young children and adolescents is extremely vulnerable. The results of early injuries to the nervous *em may become evident only as the nervous system"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO matures and ages.' It is for this very reason that those who poison the food, water and air deliberately are not immediately held accountable. Any time you hear companies deny long tern effects (chemicals, electromagnetic fields, etc), you know you are on the right track to detecting a time-dependent, cumulative process (TDCP) that is being taken advantage of by the system in order to produce financial gain at the expense of the population, covertly. All of this is not some sporadic paranoid fantasy. It is a matter of record and history. Anyone who spends enough time researching these subjects will immediately recognize the patterns inherent in the system of insanity governing this planet. We spend over 3,000 hours a year researching these things, amongst others. The observation that some neurological and psychiatric disorders have their origin in the environment is not new. The association between lead accumulation in the body and subsequent neurological problems has been known since Roman times. The fact that the tetraethyl lead in gasoline produces toxic psychoses when inhaled was noted in 1946. In 1954, the association between suicide, depression and contact with carbon disulfide in workers was documented. The association between neuropathy and contaminated cooking oil in Morocco was in 1959. In 1964, behavioral anxiety, irritability and pathologic shyness was lied with exposure to elemental mercury. The list seems endless. The Nervous System and Toxicant Access The nervous system is composed of cells of several types, each with its own hnction and characteristic vulnerabilities. Several unique features of the nervous system intluence its reaction to toxic agents, including interference with nerve regeneration, the structural anatomy (especially with long axons), the interconnections with other cellular structures, the dependence on glucose as an energy source, the mechanisms in highly specialized neuronal subsystems, and the wide variety of highly localized neurotransmitter and neuromodulation systems. In addition, environmental toxicants can disturb the complex interactions between the nervous system and other organs. The accessibility of a particular part of the nervous system to a specific chemical is a fbnction of both the tissue and the chemical itself Many chemicals are kept fiom entering the brain by what is called the 'blood-brain barrier,\" which is the collectively of the tight junctions formed by endothelial cells surrounding capillaries that supply brain tissue, and by endothelial cell and astrocyte interactions. The importance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in all the paradigms discussed in Matrix III demands a definitive discussion of it. The BBB as a totality is composed of a 400 mile network of capillaries. If the walls of these capillaries were laid flat, the BBB would cover an area of 1000 square feet. ' Rodier et al., 1975. In 1986, Calne et al. Hypothesized that various environmental agents contribute to Alzheimers, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by depleting neuronal reserves to an extent that becomes observable in the context of aging. For instance, a syndrome combining the symptoms of ALS and Parkinson's has a high incidence in Guam, and results from the early ingestion of large amounts of Sago palm. The seeds of these cycads contain a chemical with neurotoxic properties. The total extent to which chemicals in the environment contribute to medical and psychiatric problems is unknown."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The Blood-Brain Barrier The capillaries in the BBB are more discriminating than those elsewhere in the body. While allowing passage of oxygen and other essential chemicals, the anatomical arrangement shields the brain fiom toxins in the circulatory system and fiom biochemical fluctuations that would be overwhelming if the brain had to continually respond. A steady chemical environment is important in the brain because specific levels of neurotransmitters are important for survival of the brain and body. The BBB fortunately blocks many allopathic drugs fiom access to the brain. The BBB can be crossed by lipophilic substances, and has a series of specific transport mechanisms through which required nutrients, hormones, amino acids, peptides, proteins, fatty acids and other molecular arrangements reach the brain. Toxicants can gain access to the brain if they are lipid soluble2 or if they structurally resemble substances normally taken up by the nervous system. The BBB is less effective in immature biological organisms than in adults - another reason why the young are so vulnerable. In fact, it is totally absent in parts of the brain, such as around the olfactory nerve, which runs directly fiom the nose to the fiontal cortex3 - a fact that every cocaine addict knows so well. Some cells in the nervous system cannot reproduce themselves once damaged and cannot be replaced. Many of these cells are ordinarily present in excess numbers as a buffer against damage, and substantial loss does not immediately affect hnction or behavior. Again, this is why the effects of many substances introduced into the environment are not noticed right away. The temporal distance between the cause and efJe increases until cumulative effects break the threshold of noticeability. This principle, as I explained before, is taken advantage of by the biological, chemical and electromagnetic sources of pollution to avoid accountability for the problem. This is why I mentioned that denial of long-term cumulative effect, as a concept, is a fiont to avoid codkontation on this issue. Look for it. Back to the issue. The exact degree of redundancy in specific brain areas, i.e., the number of excess cells acting as a buffer, is not known, but there are indications that the degree of \"buffering\" decreases with age. So, both the very young (because of the immaturity of the nervous system) and the old (because of the generalized atrophy of the brain and the loss of the \"buffer\" over time) are the most susceptible to environmental influences. The end result is a non-linear dose-response relationship, which is not surprising, since most body systems are non-linear in function. All cell membranes are composed chiefly of lipid molecules. The lipid content of the newous system is especially high - the myelin sheaths constitute 25% of the brain's dry weight. Cross-reference this fact to the chapters on vaccines and vaccine-caused social psychopathy. More data on chemicals and lipids is discussed later. Broadwell, 1989."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The interaction between exposures to neurotoxicants and age-related cell loss, then, explains the fiequently seen delay in manifestations of toxic consequences. If several processes (electromagnetic or chemical damage, normal aging, and cellular death) are proceeding simultaneously, it is difficult to isolate 'the lone assassin\" responsible for finctional impairment. Manifestations of neurotoxic response can be progressive, with small fbnctional deficits becoming more serious as the latency period expires. Because of the nature, structure and function of the human body, it becomes almost impossible to define the onset of impairment. The demarcation between an \"unimportant\" environmentally-induced change and a 'health-damaging\" change is unclear. A small change might be a marker of exposure, a moderate change might signal preciinical disease, and a large change might (and usually does, as in cancer or leukemia) indicate advanced degeneration. With few exceptions (e.g., proteins), substances that are carried in the bloodstream can pass from capillaries to surrounding extracellular fluid (in nearly all regions of the body). That is not true in the central nervous system4 Chemical access to cells varies in different regions of the nervous system and at different stages of development. Besides the area of the olfactory nerve previously mentioned, the circumventricular area of the brain has no BBB. In developing animals monosodium glutamate (MSG) selectively kills cells in the mate nucleus and the retina, where the barrier is insufficient to exclude it. The subject of MSG as a food additive is discussed elsewhere in this book. Other areas have incomplete barriers, e.g., the dorsal root ganglion is vulnerable to penetration. Most nuclei in the nervous system, particularly the central nervous system (CNS), have relatively intact barriers and thus are protected fiom some classes of chemicals. Although those barriers exclude many chemicals from the brain, some neurotoxic chemicals can gain access to the CNS via normal uptake mechanisms, if they are structurally similar to endogenous substances normally taken into the brain. Such variable protection places some anatomic regions at particular risk and gives rise to different expressions of neurotoxicity in response to various agents. Pharmaceuticals, Drugs and the Nervous System Some materials, particularly pharmaceuticals, produce diierent responses in the nervous system at diierent doses or have adverse side effects at \"therapeutic\" doses. For example, tricyclic antidepressants perform the desired allopathic function at a low dose, but higher doses produce life-threatening effects. Antipsychotic drugs can produce disabling motor disorders. Some antibacterial drugs can result in loss of hearing and balance5. Some substances 'Valued\" for their relatively selective neurotoxicity, such as ethanol, are particularly likely to have simultaneous neurotoxicity. Plainly put, alcoholics Bet. et al., 1989. 5 Lim, 1986; Boettcher et al., 1987; Dayal et al., 1984."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO also suffer brain damage. The encephalopathic effect of all vaccines was noted by the AM. in 1926, especially in reference to the DPT vaccine. Today, vaccines are routinely given to babies and young children before brain myelination is completed. Refer to those chapters for specifics. Exposure to Chemical Mixtures and Interactive Effects Exposure to combinations of chemicals can produce interactive effects. An example would be the cumulative exposure to both occupational and environmental solvent^.^ The general population is exposed to chemicals with neurotoxic properties in foods, cosmetics, perfbmes, colognes, aftershaves, household products7, furniture, drugs (both prescribed and otherwise), vaccines (aluminum and mercury adjuvants), water (halogen and petroleum compounds), and naturally occurring neurotoxins in fish and plants in the environment.' The very fact that there is a multitude of voluntary and unintentional exposures to neuroactive substances that characterize the daily lives of most people ought to be a good reason to test the other 63,000 chemicals for neurotoxicity, wouldn't you think? Again, the very fact that nothing is done about it is telling. In general terms, neurotoxic injury involves functional or structural change. The diierent vuinerabilities or various cells to injury by a given toxicant and the normal roles of susceptible cells determine the biologic markers of effect or clinical manifestations of exposure to a particular neurotoxic chemical. For example, myelin degeneration after exposure to triethyltin or hexachorophene is manifested as spasticity. The effect on neurons in the hippocampus are associated with learning and memory deficits. Many classes of toxicants, such as chlorinated hydrocarbons pesticides and industrial solvents, dissolve read& in lipids. Since molecules dissolved in membrane lipids are relatively protected firom enzymatic degradation and sheltered from the general circulation, lipids act as depots where various toxicants can accumulate and reach high local concentrations. Toxicants can gradually leach out of lipid depots, such as liver and adipose (fat) tissue, to such an extent that the exposure of the nervous system itself to a toxic chemical last much longer that the external exposure of the organism, The Potential Magnitude of Environmental Neurotoxicity In 1977, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimated that firom 1972 to 1974, there were 197 chemicals to which a million or more Americans were exposed in their occupational setting for all or past of each day. In a Cranmer and Goldberg, 1986. ' The National Research Council estimates 15% of the population experiences hypersensitivity to common household chemicals. Allergic reactions and hypersensitivity affect 35 million Americans. In 1994, the National Academy of Sciences reported that 95% of chemicals used in fragrances are synthetic compounds derivedjkom petroleum. The cosmetic industry is unregulated by law and exempt from listing product ingredients. Over 5,000 natural and synthetic compounds are involved."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO rev& of secondary sources in the research literatureg, it was found that more than 33% of those 197 chemicals had demonstrated the potential for adverse effects on the nervous system. Since the collection of data necessary to estimate the overall magnitude of the problem would point too many fingers toward the source of the problem, it has not been done. As mentioned before, only 10% of the 70,000 chemicals in commercial use have been tested for neurotoxicity. Even among the most extensively regulated classes of chemicals (drugs) and the marginally regulated chemicals (pesticides and food additives), the information needed for a thorough health-hazard assessment was. available on only 5- 18%. Few compounds have been assessed for selective toxicity to vulnerable groups in the population, i.e., the young and the old. Furthermore, there is little information on the nature and extent of human exposure to even the materials that have been tested and identified as neurotoxic. Is that criminal negligence, or what? Of the 588 chemicals listed by the American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (an oxymoronic-sounding organization) in 1982 as both widely used in industry and having toxicological significance, 167 (28%) had neurologic effects as one basis for recommendations on maximal exposure concentrations. Work by 07Donoghue in 1986 indicated, on the basis of a small, unselected sample of chemicals, that 5% of all industrial chemicals are neurotoxic (excluding pesticides, which are by fhction neurotoxic). In 1987, Diener noted that 07Donoghue's calculation could be an underestimate and should not be considered a firm basis for extrapolation of risk until broader and more systematic surveys of the neurotoxicity of chemicals in commercial use have been undertaken. Of course, that will either never happen, since it would mean the end of certain factions in the military/industrial/pharmaceutical complex. The EPA certainly isn't going to do it, for an end to toxicity would void the necessity for its existence. Prudent ~ublic policy would dictate that all chemicals and pharmaceuticals be tested for safetv and neurotoxicitv bv independent labs o~erated bv people not connected to Tone outside the lab. To have the government oversee the Drocess and have the manufacturers conduct these tests constitutes both bias and a conflict of interest. The fact that thisprocess has been allowed to continue constitutes criminal conspiracy, negligence and homicide, in many cases. Why do you think that legislation was put forth in 1995 to limit liability awards? The cat has to get out of the bag eventually. It's preemptive damage control. Examples of Neurotoxic Mechanisms The range of examples in literature of neurotoxic mechanisms is rather large. A sampling of the mechanisms involved can be seen in the pyrethoidr, synthetic analogues of pyrethrins, the active substance in the flower of the Chrysanthemum. These insecticides, made from the dried flowers, were used extensively until the end of World Wm II. During and after the war, mostly with expertise derived fiom scientists transferred fiom Nazi Germany's biochemical warfare program10 under Operation Paperclip, neurotoxic insecticides such as DDT, lindane, dieldrin, parathion and malathion (sprayed over Anger, 1986.

In the 1960's the biological persistence of these neurotoxins became evident. Many pyrethrin derivatives were synthesized after W.W.II and tested as insecticides. The pyrethroid insecticides now in use are characterized generally by potent insecticidal activity, relatively low acute mammalian toxicity, little known chronic mammalian toxicity (although information is not complete), and environmental biodegradability. Among insecticides, both pyrethroids and organophosphate-carbamate anticholinesterases have been studied most thoroughly for their mechanisms of action. Pyrethroids can be classified into two large groups. Type I pyrethroids include allethrin, tetramethrin, pemethrin and phenothrin. Type I1 pyrethroids include newer compounds, such as deltamethrin, cyphenothrin, cypemethnn, and fenvalerate. The two types of pyrethroids cause somewhat different types of mammalian poisoning. Poisoning by Type I pyrethrins is characterized by hyperexcitation, ataxia, convulsions, and eventual paralysis; poisoning with Type II pyrethroids is characterized by hypersensitivity, tremors and paralysis. Despite slight differences in the symptoms, both have the same major target site: the sodium channel of the nerve membrane, i.e., the channel directly responsible for generating action potentials. Only a small fraction of sodium channels need to be mod@ed to cause severe signs of poisoning. In contrast, a toxicant like n-hexane (a glue solvent) causes diiess and irritation of the eye, throat and skin. Biopsies of humans and carehl morphologic studies of rats have demonstrated that n-hexane results in neurofilament-filed swellings of arons, swollen nerves, with subsequent degeneration distal to the swellings developing over time, especially in the peripheral nervous system as opposed to the CNS. Other neurotoxic actions may involve formation of toxic by-prhcts, such as pyrroles, which may lead to cross-linking of neurofilarnents, causing formation of neurofilament masses too large to pass through the constrictions in axonal diameter that occur at every node of Ranvier. See illustrations for depiction of nervous system components. Trends in Neurodegenerative Brain Disease Neurodegenerative diseases and those associated with advancing age are becoming more prevalent as the population ages. Brain tumor incidence has increased in parallel to improved survival rates for patients with other cancers, which later can spread to the brain. According to the National Cancer Institute, eachyear 15,000 people are diagnosed with cancer that begins in the brain, and cancer qreads to the brain in 150,000 others. A link to the AIDS syndrome relative to petroleum derivatives (benzene, vlene, etc) permitting thymus infestation by parasites, cutting down T-cell production\", seems to be supported by the fact that 30,000 people with the syndrome now have the brain infections cryptococcoal meningitis (caused by a hngus) and toxoplasmosis encephalitis (caused by a protozoan organism); both are caused by infestation by primitive,~r~anisrns~~. \" Hulda Regehr Clark, Ph.D, \"The Cure for HIV and AIDS\", ISBN 0-9636328-3-3.

In 1885, a German bacteriologist Paul Ehrlich discovered that a dye called Evan's Blue, when injected into a animal, appeared throughout the bloodstream but was excluded by the brain. Since that time, allopathic investigators, in true reptilian form, wondered how this mechanism worked. In 1969, Thomas Reese and Milton Brightman, neurobiologists at the National Institutes of ~ealth,\" viewed the process through an electron microscope. They saw that cells forming capillary walls elsewhere in the body were pocked with vesicles and portals called fenestrations, but the capillary walls of the blood-brain barrier have few vesicles, no portals and continous junctions forming a tight sheet that curves to form the capillary tubule. Capillary regeneration processes also perpetuate the barrier when new epithelial cells align, forming the characteristic tight fit. It is thought that the cells called astrocytes, previously mentioned, the supportive neuroglial cells that wrap around the capillaries, might exude a substance that regulates the specialization that allows this process to take place. As mentioned previously, lipid soluable substances readily move across the blood- brain barrier. Many psychoactive drugs are lipid soluable. Heroin, the refined form of opium, traverses the BBB over 100 times faster than its precursor, morphine. Some psychoactive drugs, such as Valium, simply dissolve in the lipoid of the membrane and cross it, without binding to a specific receptor. Nicotine, cocaine and alcohol readily pass fiom blood to brain. A substance called mannitol is frequently inhected into patients. It has the effect of temporarily shrinking the endothelial cells of the BBB, providing a 15 minute window when an injected substance can be allowed to pass to the brain. Mannitol is frequently used to deliver chemo \"therapyy' drugs, but the downside is that other substances normally excluded fiom the brain also rush in - the results can be very negative. Researchers at Brown University and CytoTherapeutics Corporation in Rhode Island are experimenting with an implant containing cells genetically engineered to release large amounts of specific proteins, including nerve growth factor (NGF) and dopamine.14 Biochemical compounds are also being used to force open the BBB. Alkermes Inc in Cambridge, Massachusetts has developed what they call a \"receptor-mediated permeabilizer\" or RMP, consisting of a family of compounds based on bradykinin, a peptide that dilates blood vessels. It has the effect of loosening junctions enough to allow certain other molecules through. RMP derivatives have been used to permit antibiotics to soak into the brain in an attempt to treat cryptococcal meningitis. Chemotherapy drugs, which are mostly water soluble, have been transported using RMP methodology. l3 More properly, in view of the evidence, called the National Institutes of Death and Degeneration. 14 Experimental Neurology, July 1993. 197"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 -

Heavy metals involved include mercury, aluminum, lead, chromium, bismuth, iron, cadmium, arsenic, cerium, antimony, cobalt, copper, gallium, gold, manganese, nickel, platinum, silver, tellurium, thallium, tin, uranium, vanadium and zinc. In the first volume of Matrix ZZI we discussed both aluminum and mercury in some detail, including some cursory data on the relationship between Alzheimer's syndrome and aluminum deposition in the brain. We will supplement that information with new information gained since the publication of volume one, as well as information on some of the other compounds, as well as data on processes of detoxflcation in order to get rid of heavy metals in your system. Contamination with Mercury Compounds Background Mercury is a highly toxic metal that is more dangerous than lead, cadmium and arsenic in relation to its effect on the body. The basic psychology and mentality associated with the use of metal implants as a 'tlental aid began in the year 18 19. The fact of its use at that time is believed to have been entirely practical - the malleability of an amalgam made with mercury (45-60%) was quite attractive in terms of its bonding power and mechanical reliability. The fact remains that mercury is even more toxic than lead or arsenic. The use of it today in over 80% of the cavities that develop in the United States, primarily because of the degenerative diet of processed foods and ironically the use of fluorides by dentists on adults, despite mountains of scientific information gathered since 1926 that indicates its toxic effect on the brain and the body, is not justified. The fact that the American Dental Association and establishment science knows it is having this effect, and is ~romotinp; its use. contributes toward the Drocess of slow deteriorization of the po~ulation while at the same time uroducinp; lame ~rofits for a s~ecial interest grout>. - ironically, crimes punishable by death under the Crime Bill of 1994 and United Nations rules under the category of genocide'. Despite the existence of over 1400 scientific articles dealing with the toxicology of mercury, the problem continues. Hundreds of millions of people endure sub-clinical illness, degradation of immune system capability, and neurological damage because this practice is condoned by the population. A simple list of symptoms include premature aging (similar to that caused by fluoride), cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disturbances, allergies and psychological/behavioral effects often The United States is exempt from the March 1988 UN Genocide Treaty, as it signed only under the proviso that ''no nation shall sit in judgement ofthe United States.\" Any form of genocidal activity is technically legal in the US under UN mandates - thus, the Nazi biomedical genocide continues."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The Use of Mercury Implants in Dentistry The use of mercury amalgam for dental purposes quickly followed its invention by a chemist named Bell in 1819. By 1826, its use had expanded to England and France. A dentist named Taveau invented a 'Silver paste\" for tooth fillings, combining melted silver coins and mercury. It was first introduced in the United States in 1833 in the city of New York. Dentists rebelled. They refined to use the 'Silver\" because it caused immediate symptoms of mercury poisoning. It only took ten years before most dentists denounced the use of the material because of its poor filling qualities and its toxic nature. In that year, 1840, most dentists in the United States contributed towards the formation of the American Society of Dental Surgeons. At the first dental college in the United States, the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, all members were required to sign a pledge promising not to use mercury in fillings 'because the use of lithodeen mineral paste and all other substances of which mercury is an ingredient were hurthl both to the teeth and to all parts of the mouth.\" In 1859, a group of wealthy businessmen formed the American Dental Association. The ADA promoted the use of mercury anialgam from the very beginning. A Chronology of Research and Studies Active scientific research relative to the effect of mercury implants was stimulated in the early 20th century by the general change in the health of the population. German chemist Dr. Alfred Stock researched mercury poisoning in 1926 and proved that the 'Silver\" amalgam filling was a source of mercury vapor contaminating the human body. The research was generally suppressed, and years of patient poisoning transpired. In 1935, the work of Stock in Germany proved that some of the mercury vapor coming from dental amalgams entered the nose, was absorbed by the mucosa and passed rapidly into the brain. It was found in the olfactory lobe and in the pineal gland. The first issue of Environmental Reseach magzine in 1967 (p323) featured the research of L. Magos, \"Mercury-blood interaction and mercury uptake by the brain afier exposure\". His experiments with mice indicated that elemental mercury reaches the brain after inhalation. We already know that mercury amalgam continuously gives off vapor. Mercury vapor inhaled has an incredible heavy metal absorption rate between 70 to 100 percent. Since mercury oxidizes into its elemental form once in the brain, the blood-brain barrier works in reverse, preventing the escape of elemental mercury from the brain. In 1980, the WHO admitted, 'The most hazardous forms of mercury to human health are elemental mercury vapor and the short-chain alkylmercurials.\"* The FDA in 1976pronounced \"acceptance\" of the mercury amalgam, due to the fact that 'It had been in use since 1840.\" It was added to the Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) listing of pre-1930 drugs. It is still there, because of pressure fiom the ADA The 1980 WHO publication \"Recommended Health-based Limits in Occupational Exposure to Heay Metals \". 210"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO and dental lobby groups, who fear massive retribution should the true nature of dental practices become known to the general public. Revelations about the use of mercury amalgams would cause a vast series of lawsuits, and possible demands for no-cost replacement of amalgam fillings by less toxic composites - there are currently no safe non- toxic dental fillings materials, although some plastic compounds are only mildly toxic. In 1979, perhaps as a reaction to the FDA ruling, research began appearing that documented the fact that mercury vapor is constantly released fiom fillings, especially when the fillings were stimulated by chewing, brushing, or subject to swingings in temperature. Three times a day there are periods when mercury leaching into the body is at a peak. Every time you eat and brush your teeth. By 1984, autopsy studies were published that demonstrated that the amount of mercun, found in brain and kihev tissue direct& relates to the amount of mercury amalaam~fillinas in the teeth. Research at the University of Calgary School of Medicine demonstrated that mercury fiom dental fillinas could be found in the blood and tissues of preanant mothers and their babies within a-few d@vs of insertion. Perhaps as a reaction to those reports, the National Institute of Dental Research held an international workshop on the \"Biocompatibility of Metals in Dentistry\". The 1984 Workshop on Biocompatibility of Metals in Dentistry The workshop on biocompatibility was held in Chicago in July 1984. It was sponsored by the American Dental Association and held at the national headquarters building. When it was over, it was apparent that the ADA was slowly giving way to the increasing pressure from the results of scientific research. The usual policy of the ADA had been such that they denied any possibility of negative effect from the presence of mercury amalgam in the mouth. Now, the ADA publicallv admitted that mercury vapor is releasedjFom amalgam fillings during the process of eating. They also admitted that analysis of blood or urine does not show the true higher level of mercury toxicity in the b*. The ADA fbrther qualified their statement by saying, 'the amount of mercury vapor released is 'so small' that it cannot be considered a health hazard except in a few individuals who are 'hypersensitive to mercury' - the incidence of such sensitive people is estimated to be 1% of the population.\" We might at this point comment on this statement by the ADA: (1) The American Dental Association admitted that mercurv amalgam is a health hazard for \"mercury sensitive\" individuals. Ifl however, after making this statement in 1984, they did not immediately put a general screening policy for all dental patients nationwide to check for 'mercury sensitivity ', they would probably be guilty of gross negligence, having knowingly pennittedpeople to have amalgam inserted without testing for sensitivity you adinit is there constitutes"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO knowingly implanting a hazardous toxic substance. This constitutes criminal activig. Obviously, this is the case fkom 1984 to 1994. (2)The ADA stated that the number of people who were sensitive to mercury was estimated to be 1%. Estimated by who? Theypresented absolutely no scientzfic data to back up this statement. In fact, literally hundreds of scientific studies indicate otherwise. Here, the ADA was guilty of presentation of fraudulent and unsupported data. The ADA later admitted that the figure was an \"opinion\" of a presenter. (3) As the existence of the ADA has been integrated into public awareness, the standard public perception is that ADA statements represent scientific truth. The ADA knows this, and they also know that a conditioned and ignorant public will rarely question any statement made by the ADA. When the ADA utters false statements that put the public health in jeopardy by permitting implantation of a toxic substance in the body, they are considered to be party to a criminal act. Having a third party dentist do the deed does not excuse the ADA from guilt in this case. Dentists spend years going to approved schools and a lot of money. Dentists that go against the ADA could loose their license to practice. This constitutes a form of extortion and racketeering punishable under RICO. I suppose the same would be true for the other connected agencies. In Ocober of 1984, a group of dentists, physicians and scientists formed the International Academy or Oral Medicine and Toxicology. One of the items first on the agenda was to address the ADA statement that mercury amalgam was 'Safe\". The ADA felt that the 'Workshop on Biocompatibility\" had rearmed the 'Safety\" of dental amalgam. A committee was formed to determine the validity of the ADA position. Afier a year of study, a critical evaluation was produced and mailed back to the ADA. The recommendation of the IAOMT was that 'the governments of the United States and Canada declare an immediate prohibition on the further use of dental mercury amalgam fillings until primary scientific documentation can be provided proving that the mercury released from dental fillings is not harmfir1 to the public.3 In 1985, a study at Oral Roberts University involved pediatric dental patients between the ages of five and twelve. The object of the study was to measure levels of mercury vapor in the mouth before and after installation of amalgam fillings. The study concluded that 'tlental amalgam restorations and mercury vapor exposure were shown to be related\" and 'thewing increases the evaporation of mercury fiom dental amalgams that are only 1 week old.\"4 A fbrther study in August 1985 measured the mercury content in International Academy of Oral Medicine, #6 15-40 1 9th Avenue SW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2P 3C5. 4 Ernler and Cardone, \"An assessment ofmercuy in mouth air \", Oral Roberts University, March 1985."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO the air of the mouth before and after chewing gum. The study revealed that once you stop chewing, it takes another 90 minutes before the oral mercury level returned to the pre- chewing level.' The 1990 CBS \"60 Minutes\" Program on the use of Mercury Amalgam On December 16, 1990, the CBS \"60 Minutes\" television program did a major story on the amalgam issue. That one program generated the second highest response for additonal information in the history of the program. Most who viewed the program thought that it would produce a change in the system. Instead,' it prompted a vast campaign to counter the knowledge given to the public. In response to the 1990 \"60 Minutes\" program and the immense public response, the American Dental Association and 'tesponsible\" government agencies invested 'huge\" sums of money to counter the tremendous effect of the program. Special letters and news releases were sent to every dentist in the United States demeaning the scientific information presented on the program and assuring the dentists that 'halgam has been used for 150 years and therefore had to be safe.\" They also countered with press releases to all the major media, and even fabricated a program for the dentist entitled 'What to tell your patients when they ask about amalgam.\" Also in 1990, the first controlled research on the effects of amalgam implants were published. The research cited significant effects of mercury amalgam on various tissues and organs in experiments with monkeys and sheep. We review the study on sheep later. Also in 1990 the EPA, in recognition of the toxicity of mercury vapor, banned the use of mercury in latex interior paints. In March 1991, the FDA recommended 'further studies\", and consumer groups and legislators began introducing informed consent legzslation where dentists would be required to inform patients of the content of amalgam fillings (implants) and the potentially hdl effects of mercury. In Mcly 1991, a medical research team at the University of Kentuclj established \"a probable relationship of mercury eqourre fiom mercury amalgam fillings to both Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease. We will review the University of Kentucky study later. University of Georgia microbiologists have determined that mercury from wings inhibits the eflectiveness of antibiotics (which probably should not have been used in the first place). In 1991, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that exposure to mercury fiom amalgams is higher than that of other environmental sources, and that each amalgam filling releases fiom 3.0 to 17 micrograms of mercury every day while chewing food. Americans average about eight fillings. The WHO audited all available scientific data on the subject and concluded that - - Vimy M.J., and Lorscheider F.L. \"'Intra-oral mercury releasedfi.om dental amalgam \", Journal of Dental Research , Vol 64: 1069-1071, 1985, and \"Serial meaurements of intra-oral air mercury and the estimation of daily dose @om dental amalgam \".

In August of 1991 the Washington Dental Disciplinary Board, in an effort to stem the growing awareness of the toxicity of mercury amalgam, proposed 'tiental ethics\" legislation that would have made it 'bnethical and a punishable offense for any dentist to replace a 'clinically serviceable' dental amalgam filling for health purposes.\" The proposal did not pass. Even today, for a dentist to recommend removal of fillings for health reasons places his or her ADA license at risk. In February 1992 at the annual meeting of the Society of Toxicology, medical students presented five studies demonstrating adverse health effects of mercury exposure fiom amalgam fillings. Also in 1992, the California State Senate passed an informed consent bill regarding the use of dental amalgam, and the German Federal Department of Health banned the manufacture and sale of some dental amalgam materials. In 1993, the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology (IAOMT) developed a Certification Program for Biocompatible Dentistry. Dentists certified by the IAOMT will have 'tlemonstrated proficiency in replacing amalgams safely and properly. Swedish researchers discovered that gastrointestinal hction improves after amalgam is removed. A citizens petition requesting a ban on the use of amalgams is filed with the FDA. The Swedish Health and Welfare System demanded in 1993 that the Swedish government submit a five-year plan for permanently discontinuing the use of amalgam. Also in 1993, the State of California passed a law requiring the Board of Dental Examiners to develop, distribute and update a fact sheet describing and comparing the risks and efficacy of the various types of dental restorative materials. Prior to this, a dentist risked losing his or her license if such detailed information was given to a patient. It was considered unethical to resent both sides of the dental mercurv issue to a ~atient! In January of 1994, the govement of Ontario demanded a probe of mercury dental fillings. In February, Sweden announced a total ban on the use of mercury amalgam fillings. Dr. Fritz Lorschieder, professor of physiology at the Calgary Medical School, stated ')given the evidence, the continued use of mercury dental amalgam fillings is indefensible.\" (Second Opinion, William C-Douglas, M.D., ed. 1350 Center Dr. Ste100, Dunwoody, Georgia 3033 8). The 1994 British \"Panorama\" Broadcast on the Use of Mercury Amalgam On July 11, 1994 the British channel BBC-1 featured an episode of the documentary program \"Panorama\" that dealt with the amalgam issue. Interviewed on Panorama was Dr. Lars Friberg, Chief Advisor to the World Health Organization (WHO) on metals poisoning. He told the documentary crew that 'the use of mercury in dental fillings is not safe and should be avoided.\" The program also reported on new scientific research which demonstrated clear links between the mercury released fiom dental fillings and serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Dr. Friberg told Panorama that he 'Uid not know why\" the British Dental Association considers mercury levels in amalgam 'safe', and that '1 think they are wrong.\" He was concerned particularly about deposition of mercury in the brains of children fiom fillings. According to Dr. Friberg, 'ke know that children are especially vulnerable to the amalgam. We know that it takes a few years after birth until the brain is developed and we know the brains in children are much more sensitive than those of adults. I think that you should try to avoid the implantation of toxic metals in the mouth. There is no safe level of mercury, and no one has actually shown that there is a safe level. I say mercury is a very toxic substance. I would like to avoid it as far as possible. Panorama investigated a number of new independent studies, some as yet unpublished, which point inexorably towards the health risks of amalgam fillings. The first is a new study by Dr. Boyd Haley, Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Kentucky. This study discovered that small quantities of mercury fiom amalgams can produce changes in the brain that are identical to changes caused by Alzheimer's disease. The mercury inhibits the efficiency of tubulin, a protein vital to brain cells. According to Dr. Haley, 'To the best that we can determine with these experiments, mercury is a time bomb in the brain. We need to have an effect - if it's not bothering someone when they are young, especially when they age, it could turn into something quite disasterous. I still have one amalgam filling. When I had the others replaced, I had them replaced with non-amalgam fillings. I would not make the statement that mercury causes Alzheimer's disease, but there is no doubt in my mind that low levels of mercury, present in the brain, could cause normal cell death that could lead to a dementia which would be similar to Alzheimer's disease.\" Panorama also reported on a unique ongoing study of a group of nuns by Dr. William Markesbery, Professor of Pathology and Neurology and Director of the Sanders Brown Center for Aging at the University of Kentucky, which is investigating the $nJ between mercury and Alzheimers. Dr. Markesbery told Panorama, 'Mercurv is a toxic substance. It is a neurotoxin - that is to sav it causes nerve cells to degenerate if there is enough mercury Dresent in the brain. The major problem in Alzheimers disease is the degeneration of nerve cells. It is possible that mercury could add to the degeneration of nerve cells - to the death of nerve cells. The reaction of the British Dental Association to the 1994 Panorama program was predictable. The BDA told Panorama that they were unaware of the work of Haley and Echeverria, and also unaware of the work of Professor Aposhian at the University of Arizona, who discovered that 66% of the mercury deposits inthe body come fiom fillings. They rejected the work of Dr. Drasch as \"not proving that mercury deposits in the borjl are hazardous to health - a position that is transparently ludicrous and scientilically false. In fact, Mr. John Hunt, Chief Executive of the BDA told Panorama that he 'believed amalgam was safe''. The BDA fact sheet made available to dentists states 'the scientific evidence available to the BDA does not justifL banning the use of amalgam in young"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO children.\" Says Hunt, 'I've treated my children with amalgam and have no doubt that when they have their own children, they will do the same.\" Asked about any link between Alzheimer's and mercury, he said, \"As far as I know, there is no association with mercury and Alzheimer's. We rely on expert advice. nere is no evidence to suggest that merely because mercury is found in the kidneys of the fetus and young children, that it is a hazard to health. I don't see why we should necessarily worry the population at large if there are no proven arguments one way or another. The fact that it is there and it is detectable doesn't mean to say that it's potentially doing any damage. You can probably find a whole lot of substances in the brain that perhaps should not be there.\" As Forrest Gump says, \"stupid is as stupid does.\" The Effect of Mercury Compounds on Dental Personnel An unpublished study revealed by Panorama illustrated that dentists themselves are sufferinp neuro1og;ical damape from daily handling of amalgam. Dr. Diana Echeverria, a neurotoxicologist at the University of Washington, working with the cooperation of the American Dental Association, has shown that under rigorous testing, dentists exhibit classic sims of mercury voisoning. Dr. Echeverria believes that the mercury dose dentists receive is not substantiallv different fiom that received continuallv bv their patients with metal fillinas - in their mouths. She told Panorama, 'The kinds of things that we have found are losses in function associated with the ability to manually move very small things with your hands. A manual dexterih, problem. Another distinct feature of mercury poisoning is the inabilitv to concentrate. The November 18, 1988 issue of the Wall Street Journal reported that research in Sweden had revealed that the ~ituitaq glands of Swedish dentists contained 40 times the average level of mercuy found in the general ~opulation. The article also mentioned that in the United States. 70% of dentists with elevated mercury levels suffer fiom de-vression, anxietv and insomnia. Mercury Amalgam Filings and Periodontal Disease Dental fillings and prostheses are common causes of gingival inflammation. The fact that toxic mercury is used to fill teeth causes more problems. Mercury accumulation results in a depletion of fiee-radical scavenging enzymes gluthione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catala~e.~ The connective tissue matrix is particularly sensitive to fiee radical damage. The use of saiium fluoride destroys connective tissue and collagen structures within the gum. The status of the collagen matrix of the periodontium determines the rate of diffusion and permeability of inflammatory mediators, bacteria and their byproducts, and destructive enzymes fiom the oral cavity.

Vitamin E alone has proven to be of some help with peridontal disease, and its anti-oxidant effects are particularly needed if mercury amagam fillings are present. In animal studies, the toxic effect of mercury appears to be somewhat offset by supplementation with vitamin E.' Mercury is cytotoxic, which means that its acts as a toxin or an antibody and has a specific poisonous effect on the cells. Bleeding gums and alveolar bone loss, which results in loosening of teeth, are both classic signs of mercury toxicity. Of course some of these symptoms are aided by bacteria. In 1978, a German study was conducted (Till) with germ free animals and mercury amalgam. It was found that mercury in amounts released fiom amalgam fillings could produce the same signs, in addition to inflammation of the tissues which surround the tooth. Mercury Amalgam Fillings in Pregnant Humans: The Placental Bamer and the Fetal Brain Another piece of research featured by Panorama was conducted by Professor Gustav Drasch, a forensic toxicologist ar the University of Munich in Germany. This research shows that mercury from a woman's amalgam fillinss crosses the placental barrier and travels into the brain of the unborn child. According to Professor Drasch, \" Well, I think the implications are serious. It is a question of whether or not we have to restrict the application of dental amalgam to women, not only in child bearing age, but before. If for instance, a girl of 15 gets an amalgam filling, this fibg lies in her mouth for 10 years. All this time this filling releases mercury. If this girl got pregnant when she has the filling, the mercury passes to the brain of the child. It's really the question that is being discussed in Germany right now, to speak about restriction of amalgam fillings for women from, let me say, 15 to 50 years.\"Learning disabilities also seem to be characterized by a general pattern of high levels of mercury in the body. American Dental Association Recommendations to Dental Personnel Handling Mercury Amalgam When the metals of dental amalgam are mixed together to produce 'filling material': not all of it is used. This 'Scrap amalgam\" is considered a toxic waste disposal hazard by OSHq the EPA and the ADA. The American Dental Association has published rigid recommendations to dental personnel for the handling of dental amalgam and the disposal of 'Scrap amalgam\". The recommendations were published in the Journal of the 7 Kim, J., and Shklar, G., \"The eflect of vitamin E on the healing on the healing of gingival wounrls\", Journal of Periodontal Res, 1983, #54, pp 305-8. 217"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO American Dental Association under the category of Recommendations in Dental Mercury Hygzene in 1984 issue 109, pages 617-619.

The scrap should be covered bv a sulfide solution such as X-rav or photomaphic fixer solution. A no-touch techniaue of handling amalgam should be used. Skin that is exposed to mercurv should be cleaned. Precapsulated allov should be used. A face mask should be used to avoid breathing amalgam dust.\" Seven years ago in 1988 the EPA labelled scrap dental amalgam is a hazardous waste. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandates that a \"materials handling sheet\" must be present in every dental office. Once used amalgam is removed fiom a patient's mouth, it becomes hazardous waste. Dentists are subject to fines of thousands of dollars if they do not follow strict procedures. An Amalgam Manufacturer's Warning Kerr Manufacturing Company provides the following statement on their amalgam product, \"WARNING: Allov amalgam capsule products contain mercury. Since mercury is a potentially hazardous substance. proper care should be taken to prevent exposure to mercury. The wearing of gloves. good ventilation and proper disposal is essential.\" Remember that warning as your dentist fills a tooth and small pieces of amalgam fall on the tongue, lips and face - and go down your throat.

It was discovered in 1964 that each individual micro-dose of mercury behaves independently in the body relative to processes of absorption, deposition in tissue and excretion.* Further experimentation resulted in the discovery that there seemed to be three distinct phases in the process of elimination of mercury fiom body tissues.' How long does mercury persist in the body? Studies by Sugita in 1978 indicates that the biological half-time of the slowest component of the three phases would be 18 to 20 years in the forebrain and midbrain.'' Furthermore, there was evidence that when the dose is small, the biological half-time is longer than after a large dose. In other words, how long it lasts is inversely proportional to the dose size. Studies by Bernard and Purdue in 1984 suggest that the slowest component of elimination would take 27 years.\" Chronic exposure to micro doses of mercury will cause a process of accumulation in various organs over the lifetime of an individual. There appears to be no level above which symptoms can be expected, or below which symptoms cannot occur. l2 Age and Mercury Content in Brain Tissue Studies published in Germany in 1984 suggest a clear correlation between age and mercury content in brain tissue. l3 A study done in Sweden at the Department of Hygeiene in 1986 by Lars Friberg, one of the most capable researchers on mercury, was published in the Swedish Medical Journal. The study showed that mercury in the central nervous system (CNS) can be related to the number of fillings in the mouth. The study also showed a directly proportional relationship between the number of amalgam fillings and the amount of mercury deposited in the cortex. Considering that mercury has a half-time of some 20 years in areas of the brain, there a lot of people in serious trouble. Dr. Friberg was quoted as saying, 'There are no permissible limits on this. It is known that mercury is one of the most poisonous substances that exist.\" In other words, there is no scientific evidence anvwhere which Droves that the level of mercury found in the human brain is safe 'Rothstein A., and Hayes AD., \"The turnover of mercury in rats exposed repeatedly to inhalation of vapor\".

If they know about it and do it anyway, it proves that it is intentionally being done to reap the financial benefit from a population that is rotting away before their eyes. Theoretically, it could fall under the genocide laws the United States has so cleverly sought to exempt itself from. In a staggering parallel to the other paradigms in Matrix 111, out of more than $88 million in dental research scheduled for 1985 and 1986, only $48,000 was spent investigating the \"biocompatibility\" of mercury amalgam fillings. Detection of Mercury in the Human Body Mercury in the body is sometimes measured by its presence in creatine, a substance found in blood, urine and muscle tissue that is a measure of kidney function. Mercury levels are typically measured in micrograms per gram (mcg/g) of creatine. Ten minutes of chewing by a person with a mercury amalgam filling will release 4 mcg/g into the system, or 0.4 mcglmin fiom each filling15. Symptoms begin to appear with levels as low as 40-50 mcg/g, but between 50 mcg/g and 100 mcg/g is generally the range for sub- clinical illness, manifesting itself in the form of delayed response in nerve conduction, brain wave activity and verbal skills. A person living in a house recently painted with latex paint containing mercury (banned by the EPA in 1990) can show urine mercury levels as high as 11 8 mcg/g. At 400 mcg/g contamination there will be mild to moderate nerve and brain disease, with the person exhibiting psycho-behavioral symptoms including depression, irritablity, memory loss, signs of disturbed kidney function, minor tremors and other neurological problems. Sub-clinical illness is transformed into overt clinical illness at a level of about 750 mcg/g. The smallest amount of mercury that will not cause damage is unknown. l6 In fact, the release of mercury fiom dental amalgams makes the predominent contribution to human exposure to inorganic mercury, including mercury vapor, in the general population. l7 Amalgam fillings lose 72% oithe mercury content in 5 years. 14 Friberg L., Kullman L.,Birger L., Nylander M., \"Mercury in the central nervous vstem in relation to amalgam jillings\" Lakartidninaen Vo1.83, Issue 75 19-521,1986. IS Dental researchers at the University if Iowa in 1979, using a mercury vapor analyzer and new measurement techniques, found that chewing does release tiny amounts of mercury vapor from fillings, which ran counter to the prevailing belief that no vapor escapes once the mercury has hardened. Levels of mercury in the blood and urine correlate with the number of amalgam fillings. Furthermore, autopsies have indicated that there is more mercury in the brain tissue of corpses with fillings, proving that mercury finds its way into the brain and body tissues from amalgam fillings.

Correlation Between Mercury and Multiple Sclerosis There is some degree of evidence that the presence of mercury in the brain is a co- factor in the development of multiple sclerosis. Interestingly, patients having multiple sclerosis are found to have mercury levels eight times higher than neurologically healthy controls. It is a matter of scientific fact that inorganic mercury is capable of producing symptoms that are indistinguishable fiom those of multiple sclero~is.'~ Categories of Mercury-induced Pathology Physicians, dentists and toxicologists who have treated the increasing number of people with problems associated with mercury have identified six general categories of pathology: (1) Allergies. Mercury combines with allergens to more readily rupture white blood cells than with allergens alone, (2) Immunological diseases, (3) Collagen diseases (fbrther accentuated when dental fluorides are administered, (4) Cardiovascular diseases, (5) Neurological degeneration and (6) Psychological and behavioral disorders caused by systemic physiological or neurological damage. It is also interesting that each of the first five areas uses the element manganese - the action of which is blocked by mercury. Physiological Toxicology of Mercury in the Human Body Mercury atoms have a distinct tendency to combine with organelles within the neuron, eventually killing it. Because of this tendency, mercury rates as a primary co- factor in dementia, especially as expressed in Alzheimer's syndrome. How do the mercury ions end up in the brain in the first place? Because amalgam fillings contain mercury, silver, zinc, tin, copper and nickel, electrolytic action is induced in the mouth, which frequently maintains an acid pH. Electrical charges induced free metallic ions which escape both in liquid (saliva + mercury atoms) and vapor form. Bacteria, both in the mouth and the intestinal tract, interact with elemental mercury to form methyl mercury compounds, which are more than 100 times more toxic than the original mercury in the fillings. Mercury vapor which makes its way into the nasal sinuses makes its way to the brain via axonal transport when mercury ions become part of the electrical transport '* International Conference of Biocompatibility of Materials, Colorado Springs, Nov 1988.

Vapor inhaled into the lungs enters the bloodstream via the capillaries and spreads systemically throughout the body. Curiously, when a pregnant human female also has mercury amalgam fillings, the fetus tends to absorb systemic mercury in a process ironically designed to protect the mother. Unfortunately in this situation, the human baby emerges with a red blood cell count 30% higher than the mother, and as mercury readily combines with hemoglobin the baby is more highly contaminated with mercury. This presents an additional cofactor for learning disabilities and minimum brain damage, to which vaccines (especially DPT) contribute once the baby is born. Hemoglobin and hemocrit eleva~ion from mercury exposure, combined with depleted oxygen transport because of the tendency of mercury to displace oxygen by taking its place in hemoglobin, results in fatigue - chronic fatigue. It is certain that mercury is a co-factor in chronic fatiguelimmune depression syndrome, as reversal of fatigue related symptoms and immune depression is known to have been mediated within two weeks of amalgam removal. Animal Tests of Systemic Mercury Absorption In 1989 and 1990, tests were conducted with pregnant sheep in which radioactive mercury amalgams were inserted. Each sheep had 12 molars filled. Radioactivity was detected within two days in the jaw bone, lungs, and intestines. Within 140 days, mercury was detected in the liver, kidneys, spleen, thyroid and pituitary glands, as well as in other tissues. Mercury was also detected in lambs born to pregnant mothers in the tests, and the milk of the mothers contained mercury at levels eight times higher than in the blood. The sheep were fed twice a day, allowing the chewing action to release mercury. The amalgams implanted in the sheep were smaller than those typically implanted into humans, indicating that human-size implants cause an even greater problem. This study on sheep was featured in an episode of 60 Minutes on CBS. Dentists in charge of the American Dental Association (ADA) predictably reacted to publication of .the study and the presentation on 60 Minutes, as detailed earlier in this chapter. Doctors at the ADA complained that \"sheep chew more than humans\" and that unlike humans, the sheep had all 12 fillings installed at once. However, at the 1992 Seattle Conference of Clinical Toxicologists, a Dr. Lorscheider reported finding similar data on mercury toxicity in monkeys, which chew the same as humans, and found evidence that standard methods used by dentists to measure mercury exposure (blood, urine) do not look for the presence of mercury where it resides the most - in tissues and organs. Other speakers at the Seattle Conference supported these findings. Further Data on the 1991 University of Kentucky Study correlating Mercury Deposition as an Alzheimer Co-factor Scientists at the University of Kentucky examined autopsied brains of ten Alzheimer's patients, compared with ten age-matched non-diseased controls, and found increased ratios between mercury and selenium, as well as increased ratios of mercury and zinc. Selenium and zinc are utilized by the human brain in a process that serves to protect"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO the neurons fiom mercury.The brains of Alzheimer patients had higher levels of mercury, especially in the cerebral cortex and areas relating to memory retention. Studies conducted in 1990 and 1991, however, showed results that were even more interesting relative to trace element imbalances in Alzheimer patients. The 1991 Study on Trace Element Deficiencies in the Alzheimer Syndrome Brain In a study similar to the University of Kentucky that analyzed autopsied brains of Alzheimer patients and age-matched disease-fiee controls,20 trace element concentrations were analyzed using a technique called instrumental neutron activation analysis. The elevation of mercury in the Alzheimer patient was the most noticable difference, especially in an area of the brain called the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), a primary area involved with retention of memory. This research yielded other interesting results which may indicate additional mechanisms relating to mercury-caused neurological alteration in the brain. It was noticed that (1) the interaction of mercury with the essential trace elements selenium and zinc, which diminish in the presence of mercury, result in a deficiency of these two essential elements and lead to cellular dysfunction, (2) cell membranes of neurons become bound up with mercury, interfering with enzyme activity and causing increased membrane permeability and leading to an altered ability to regulate the flow of elemental or molecular ions, morphological changes or cell death2' (3) mercury binds to tubulin, a protein subunit of microtubules in the bra#, causing cytoskeletal abnormalities which fbnctionally clog the microtubules between brain cells, and (4) a decrease in protein synthesis, as well as RNA and DNA levels, takes place, cutting down the informational transfer for the growth of new brain cells, inhibiting the growth of new brain cells. All in all, mercury in dental amalgams destroys the existing brain, the existing memory and prevents new brain cells fiom being made. The fact that this research is known and the process is allowed to continue indicates that it is being done intentionally. By the year 2020 we will have 60 million people in the United States over the age of 65, 12 million of whom will probably have Alzheimers syndrome from deposition of mercury and aluminum, according to the latest projections. The 1990 Brain Research Study on Alzheimer's and Heavy Metals A study carried out in 1990 by three psychiatrists23 was conducted to determine the trace elements composition and imbalances in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's. 20 Bjorkland, G. \"Mercury as a potential source for the etiology of Aizheimer's disease.\" (1991). Could this be a cwert reason why both mercury and aluminum salts are used as adjuvants in vaccines? Tubulin is a protein substance that is essential for the formation of neurofibril matrix between neurons consisting of finger-like dendrite spines believed to play a part in long-term memory. If tubulin processes are interfered with, neurofibrillaxy tangles are produced - which is exactly what is found in the brain of Alzheimer patients. Studies with rats have also confirmed this mechanism 'and the role mercury in this process. 23 Wenstrup et al, \"Trace element imbalances in isolated subcellular hctions of Alzheimer's disease brains\", Brain Research, Vol553, p125-13 1, 1990."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The brains fiom ten autopsied Alzheimer's patients and 12 control patients of the same age without Alzheimer's were evaluated. The most significant imbalance of metals found in the Alzheimer patients was an elevated mercury level and an elevated level of bromine. Levels of mercury were especially sigmficant in the cerebral cortex, especially in an area called the nucleus basalis of Meynert, a primary center of memory retention. Short term memory loss is initially the most common complaint. Researchers have also found significant levels of mercury in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are also structures that relate to memory. Mechanisms of Neural Alteration from Mercury Intensive scientific research on this subject has revealed the nature of neural alteration that occurs because of the long-term presence of heavy metals, especially mercury, in the human brain. (1) The elevation of mercury in the brain interferes and inhibits protein synthesis, and causes a general reduction in the neural levels of DNA and RNA, which are the carriers of genetic information, (2) Since mercury binds to a substance called tubulin, a protein subunit of microtubules that run between brain cells, the microtubules become cloggedz4 , (3) Mercury binds with the cell membranes of the neurons themselves, interfering with sodium and potassium enzyme function, causing excess membrane permeability, especially in terms of the blood-brain barrier25, which promotes entry of materials into the brain that would not ordinarily be a problem. It is for this reason that vaccines contain adjuvant compounds containing mercury (and aluminum). It is one of the revelations that supports the concept that the medical industrial complex has known about this all along and has been intentionally pumping heq metals into the population. (4) Mercury interacts with trace elements zinc and selenium, causing shortages of these important trace elements which subsequently diminish neural and immune system capabilities. There is no doubt in the minds of scientists that mercury, acquired mostly from seafood (fiom industrial pollution) and mercury amalgam dental implants, plays a definitive role in neurological deteriorization in Alzheimers syndrome. Interesting Parallels with the Early German discovery of Mercury Effects and the Inculcation of the Prussian Educational System in the United States It is interesting that much of the early (1920's) definitive research that determined the effect of mercury on the brain was done in Germany, indicating that mercury implantation might have later been included as part of the generalized plan to inhibit 24 In fact, when mecury binds with tubulin, it results in neurofibrillary tangles between neurons instead of clear microtubules. Neurofbrillary tangles are always seen in the brain of Alzheimer's patients. Extensive studies have also been conducted on rats to check this evidence.

It is also interesting to note that the Prussian system of education inculcated into the United States was designed to reduce the thought capacity of the general population, while preserving an elite one percent at the top. Coincidence? I don't think so. It is also interesting, in light of this, that Germany has banned the use of mercury amalgam implants, but the German-based scientific technocracy in the United States encourages it. They can ban mercury in paint (1991) but they can't ban it from the mouth. Federal Drug Administration Collusion in the Mercury Coverup One of the interesting statements by the American Dental Association is that \"the Food and Drug Administration in 1987 classfled mercury amalgam as a Class I dental device.\" The FDA rules state that all \"dental devices\" must be certified as safe and effective. Class I is the safest. Class II requires general performance standards. Class 111 requires special controls to insure a reasonable degree of safety. The fact of the matter is that the ADA statement is not accurate. Research indicates that the FDA does not certlfy mercury amalgam as safe - only the alloy that the dentists mixes with it. Amazingly, the FDA certifies liquid mercury itself as a Class I \"device\". The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that \"the mailable research evidence is not specific enough or strong enough to make sound pronouncements about the human health rishfi.om &ntal amalgam. The potential for efJects at levels of exposure prochrced by dental amalgam restorations has not been adequately studied.\" According to FDA mandates, a device where imfJicient information exists must be classified under Class Ill. The fact that mercury liquid is class~fied as Class I and amalgam itself actually remains unclassiped, means that the manufacturer is not required to furnish proof of sqfety. Without scient~pc proof provided by the manufacturer, complaints about mercury amalgam end up nowhere. In 199 1, the FDA Dental Products Panel agreed with the HHS determination that \"sufJicient scientific &fa does not exist to allow a conclusion\" as to whether mercury amalgam is a health risk to patients.\" A Health and Human Services report in 1993 refers to the existance of hundreds of complaints about adverse reaction to mercury amalgam as \"anecdotal\" and \"bogus.\" Conspiratorial criminal negligence? Yes. The only thing to be gained is the gradual mental degeneration of the population. But, why would they want to do that? The Swedish Conclusion Several determinations made by Sweden in 1986 and the 1990's have already been mentioned, but one determination not yet mentioned occurred in 1987. Sweden's National Department of Health engaged an expert committee in 1987 to review the safety aspects of mercury amalgam. According to the committee, '?om the toxicological point of view, mercury is too toxic for use as a filling material, and dentists should use other materials as soon as they are available.\" It is this determination which contributed heavily to the Swedish ban on the use of mercury in dental restorations."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The American Dental Association position on amalgam is condemned by the International Academy of Oral Medicine The ADA's \"Special Report\", in fact, is so ludicrous that it attracted the attention of the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology, who in 1990 published a \"Scientific Response to the American Dental Association's Special Report and Statement of Confidence for Dental Amalgam7' in their publication In Vivo, No. 9. According to the International Academy's response, \"It is the conclusion of this Academy that the ADA S~ecial Re~ort misinforms dental ~atients regarding the potential risks. and could leave dentists ar risk of legal liablity and guilty of negligent misrepresentation. Given the inconsistencies between scientific facts and this ADA Special Re~ort. the International Academv of Oral Medicine and Toxicologv has serious concerns regard in^ the ADA's lack of scientific rigor and the tendency to misinform the dental profession and. therebv, the ~ubiic at large. regarding the established scientific facts about amalgam safety. This failure has resulted in inadequate protection to the public and inade~uatelv Drotects the membership of the ADA fiom personal liability due to amalgam usage.\" The American Dental Association Promotes Poisoning the Population as an \"Ethical Act\" The American Dental Association does not care. They recently changed the \"ADA Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct\" to say, \"the removal of amalgam restorations from the non-allergic patient for the alleged purpose of removing toxic substances from the bo&, when such treatment is performed solely at the recommendation or suggestion of the dentist, is improper and unethical.\" In other words, to the ADA a dentist is \"being unethical\" if he dares to remove a toxic substance from the body, implying that the ADA considers implanting toxic substances as being \"ethical.\" What kind of a mind set would consider it ethical to poison 100 million people a year? The mind set born in the biomedical technocracy of Nazi Germany and imported to the United States. Since the toxic effect of mercury amalgam was known in Germany in 1926 (just as the fact that vaccines produce encephalitis was known by the AMA in 1926 and published in their journal of that year), one can only conclude that to knowingly poison 100 million people a year is contributory to genocide and constitutes a criminal offense. When will the people band together as a community and \"just say no\" and demand a halt to this process? Written Consent to Be Poisoned Another by-product of ADA dictates is that it puts the dentist in a very tenuous positions. Dentists are prohibited from making scientific knowlege available to patients, which has them essentially violating their own code of ethics and violating the right of the patient to hlly informed consent. California has now passed legislation to require dentists to acquire written informed consent fiom patients. If patients are truly given accurate scientific information, why would anyone consent?"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The American Dental Association on Mercury Amalgam April 1990 ADA Journal Special Report: 'When Your Patients Ask About Mercury in Amalgam\" 1. \"Scientific studies of dental amalgam in tooth restoration have been carefdly conducted for more than 100 years.\" Note: The implication of the above statement is that they have been studying the safety of mercury amalgam for 100 years. No such studies exist. Only studies of strength and durability have been done. The reason? Mercury is toxic and it is impossible to have a valid study that proves it to be non-toxic. When dentists first grouped together in 1830 and formed the American Society of Dental Surgeons, dentists were required to sign a pledge afbning the scientific reality of the toxicity of amalgam fillings. In general, dentists who were kicked out of the ASDS because they used the cheap and toxic amalgam ended up forming the Amercan Dental Association in 1859. A German study in 1926 affirmed the toxicity of mercury amalgam.' Why does the ADA persist in its unqualified endorsement of a toxic substance? Because of its contribution to human disease and the coffers of the medical, pharmaceutical and chemical industries, and of course the pocket of the dentist. 2. \"Amalgam restorations continue to be shown safe for the vast majority of dental patients. For the vast majority of patients, the benefits of using amalgam restorations fhr outweigh any risks.\" Note: This statement is a direct fabrication. No one has ever or will ever show that mercury amalgam fillings are safe. Ironically, the beneBts to the medical industrial complex outweigh any risks to the patient. The whole issue of the use of toxic substances and suppression of effects is an issue of gross criminal negligence and criminal conspiracy. 3. \"If there were any proven health hazard, dentists would immediately stop using amalgam.\" Note: A study published in the December 12, 1990 issue of the CRA Newsletter of 10,000 dentists revealed that only 39% are concerned about mercury amalgam implants but 94% continue to insert them into patients. Why? So as not to buck the ADA and draw attention to themselves. The ADA receives over $27 million in annual dues fiom 140,000 members (72% of all licensed dentists). It contributed $897,000 to both Republican and Democratic candidates in 1988 - specific candidates that would help defend the continued use of toxic fluoride and mercury implants. Another survey conducted in 1990 found that half of all Americans think mercury_fi.om amalgams is dangerous. It is a well known fact that dentists deliberately price non-amalgam fillings higher than amalgam fillings in an effort to keep the mercuv being pumped into the population.

The ADA statement is deceptive fraud and negligent. 9. \"Eventually, the body rids itself of mercury through the urine, but there is always a very low level of mercury present in the human system.\" Note: The presence of mercury in the body actually depresses the viability of the kidneys - as much as 60%.

Unless a patient is truly allergic to dental amalgam, dental researchers caution concerned patients to have their amalgam restorations replaced.\" Note: The above statement misleads the public by equating absence of allergic reaction with safety, which is absurd. It is also interesting that the 1974 ADA approved textbook said, \"a toxic reaction from absorption of mercury from dental amalgam has been reported in a number of cases.\" Anyway, mercury poisoning is the problem - not allergic reaction. Allergic reaction to mercury, according to published studies, increases with the length of time of exposure to mercury. Mercury poisoning begins right away. 1 1. \"The strongest and most convincing support we have for the safety of dental amalgam is the fact that each year more than 100 million amalgam fillings are placed in the United States.\" Note: This sounds like a statement from Forrest Gump. The implication here is that something that poisons a person slowly over time, because its effect is not necessarily immediate or obvious, qualifies it as safe. It is a stupid, ignorant statement indicative of a very childlike mentality. The degree of the crime does not excuse or justi@ the crime. 12.

Research indicates that mercury will penetrate the blood-brain barrier around the brain - the thin membrane which acts to separate the blood fiom the functional elements of the central nervous system. The blood-brain barrier, as well as being a physical barrier to undesirable metabolic materials outside the brain, also has other regulatory functions which control passage of select biological substances fiom the blood to the nervous system. Impairment of the blood-brain barrier can occur with absorption of less than 1 part per million (4 .Oppm) of mercury ions. The impairment occurs literally within hours of exposure, permitting entry of substances in the blood that would otherwise be excluded. 2 Studies of biochemical changes in the nervous system resulting fiom mercury seem to indicate a selective inhibition of protein and a great reduction of amino acids being incorporated into brain tissue. . . 3. All mercury compounds cause the same type of structural damage to the brain, but to different extents. 4. Methyl mercury released fiom amalgam produces complex changes in the metabolic response of the brain, suggesting impairment of metabolic control. The alterations in brain metabolism occur at doses far below those prhcing toxicity in rats. 5. Human autopsy studies have revealed brain damage in persons exposed to both organic and inorganic mercury compounds. 6. Neurological disturbances fiom mercury amalgam consist mainly of mild tremor, failure of muscle coordination and irregular movement, sensory and visual loss of acuity. 7. The central nervous system appears to be the first to exhibit functional disturbance. The toxic effects are produced after the body converts the elemental mercury vapor into murcuric ions. 8.Progressive constriction of the visual fields, o$en progressing to blindness, has been reported repeatedly in almost all signtficant exposures of humans to mercury. 9. Even at low concentrations, methyl mercury inhibits the synaptic uptake of the neurotransmitters doparnine, noradrenaline and serotonin. These substances are effectively prevented from getting into the CNS and performing their functions. It is interesting to note that Parkinsons disease results from an impairment of dopamine in the brain. A study in 1981 reviewed six cases of mercury exposure and subsequent development of Parkinsons disease. 10. The effect on the kidneys fiom mercury is well documented in scientific literature. Mercury, therefore, is \"nephrotoxic\" (toxic to the kidneys). Pathological"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO biochemical damage was found in the kidneys of various animals who had been exposed to mercury in concentrations below those levels presently considered as ''safe\" by WHO. Another significant fact is the animals appeared to be outwardly healthy. 11. Chronic exposure to mercury may cause an excess of serum proteins in the urine which may progress to nephrotic syndrome, a condition characterized by massive edema, heavy proteinura and peculiar susceptibility to infections that break into and modzh the course of any pre-existing disease. 12.Mercury fillings can contribute to a higher level of mercury in the blood. 13. Mercury adversely affects the hnctioning of the heart. In many cases the vascular response to norepinepherine and potassium chloride is blocked by the presence of mercury compounds. Mercury also blocks the entry of calcium ions into the cytoplasm. 14. Exposure to mercury compounds has been found to increase cardiovascular impairment. 15. Electrocardiograph (ECG) readings are abnormal in cases of organic mercurial poisoning. 16. A study in 1983 reported that chronic mercury exposure in rats led to interference with catecholamine (adrenaline, epinephrine, dopamine, norepinephrine) reactivity levels. 17. Mercury appears to have a pronounced effect on the endocrine system. Endocrine substances are excreted by various glands in the body, and these glands control or iduence almost all of the body processes. Some of the endrocrine secretions are hormones (steroids, peptides, and amino acids). The steroid and peptide hormones have a half-life varying fiom 5 to 100 minutes and circulate in the blood plasma. Some of the glands that excrete endocrine sybstances are the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, parathyroid, pancreas, gonads, pineal body and the paraganglia. Research indicates that the pituitary and thyroid glands display an amazing afJinity for the accumulation of mercury. Concentrations of mercury in the pituitary and thyroid glands were much higher than that found in the kidney, brain or liver tissues in humans. Evidence seems to indicate a drastic decrease in the production of thyroid hormones when mercury is in evidence. Low mercury concentations result in hormonal shifts and thyroid dyshnction. 18. The teoid gland will absorb an increasing amount of nuclear radiation fiom all sources under the influence of the pesence of mercury 19. Animals poisoned with methyl mercury exhibit stress intolerance and decreased sexual activie. The data indicates im-wirment of the adrenal and testicular steroid hormone secretions. The level of mercury in tissue required to cause the endocrine abnormalities is lower than those levels associated with overt neurological dysfunction."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO 20. Methyl mercury is known to diminish sexual activity in birds and mammals. It also causes subnormal -fertiliv and spermatogenesis (sperm production) in rats and impaired growth. 21. Mercury can produce contact demititis and Addison's disease (reduced fbnction of the adrenal glands. Some of the symptoms are progressive anemia, low blood pressure, diarrhea and disgestive disturbances. 22. Mercury has distinct effects on the immune system, especially the white blood cells (leukocytes) referred to as lymphocytes, of which there are two types, T cells and B cells. T-cells are produced in the thymus gland and B-cells are thought to be produced in the bone marrow. High frequencies of chromosomal aberrations have been observed in lymphocytes exposed to mercury ions. In other words, the presence of mercury alters the genetic code in the immune system. Other effects of mercury on white blood cells include chromosomal breakage, alteration of mitosis (cell reproduction) and death of white blood cells, as well as a drop in T-cell production. 23. Methyl mercury has an injurious effect on the fetal nervous system even at levels far below that considered to be toxic in adults. The concentration of methyl mercury in fetal blood is about 20% higher than that of the mother. Still births and the incidence of fetal birth defects exhibit positive correlation with background levels of mercury. 24. Symptoms of congenital disease from methyl mercury include: intelligence disturbances, prirnative reflexes, disturbances in body growth, speech ficulties, limb deformity, and hyperkinesia (hyperactivity resulting from brain damage). Abnormally small heads and mental retardation were present in 60% of cases. 25. During the 1971 incident in Iraq where mothers were exposed to methyl mercury through contaminated food, mothers were studied for a five year period following the exposure. Defects in babies whose mother had been exposed to methyl mercury included CNS damage, cerebral palsy, a greater death rate among babies, delayed mental development, delayed motor development, small head circumference, exaggeration of reflexes and delayed speech development. 26. The reaction of adults during the 1971 Iraqi incident included headache, sleep disturbances, dizziness, irritability, emotional instability, mania and depression.

Approximately 80% of all tooth restora- tions employ this Hglsilver dental amalgam (6). The traditional view in dentistry maintains that the Hg component of dental amalgam becomes inert once the fillings have been allowed to set for several days, and that long-term danger to the patient from Hg vapor is therefore remote (7). Hmver, more recent clinical studies in subjects with amalgam fillings wllo chewed gum for 10 min have de~nonstrated that quite substm- tial amounts of Hg vapor are released into intra-oral air from dental amalgam, being sixfold higher than pre- chewing levels (8). The intra-oral Hg vapor concentra- tion remained elevated during 30 min of continuous gum chewing; and after cessation of chewing, the mouth Hg vapor concentration declined slowly to pre- chewing levels over a period of 90 min (9). Control sub- jects with no amalgams had insignificant intraoral air Hg vapor levels that did not change as a function of chewing (8). Brushing the teeth with commercial tooth- paste will also stimulate thc rclca.. of Hg vaywr from amalgam surfaces (10). Although a positive correlation has been demonstrated between the number of dental amalgams and the levels of Hg vapor in the mouth (8, 9), it remains uncertain how much of this Hg is ab- sorbed into body tissues.

The results of this study clcarly demonstrate that sub- stantial quantities of Hg from amalgani will appear in various body tissues as early as 29 days after placement of a~r~iilga~n fillings in tceth. This Hg can bc rcatlily visualized by scintigrapliy and can bc easily quantified by analysis of tissue radioactivity. T11c cxpcrimc~~tal dc- sign of this in vivo isotope study has the advantage that all of the Hg measured originates only from dcntal amalgam and cannot be attributed to food, water, or background environmental sources. Our findings indicatc at lcast tl~rce principal sites Tor absorpion of Hg from amalgam. First, the lungs ab- sorbed Hg as did thc cilia lining thc traclica hccausc of cor~ti~iud brcatliirrg of intra-oral air hat had a Hg vapor concentration ranging from 19-50 ~g/m'tl~rough- out tliis study. In humans, approximately 80% of in- haled elemental Hg vapor is aborbcd into blood and becomes available for tissue retention (15). Second, the gastrointestinal tract contained a large amount of IIg likcly due to mixing of intra-oral Hg vapor, amalgam niicroparticles, and dissolved mercuric ions with saliva and food bcfqre swallowing. About 10% of the elcrnen- tal Hg in the human gastrointcstinal tract can be ab- sorbed into blood (16). Even tliough the ellicicncy of Hg absorption in the gut is low, large amounts of Hg in fccu seen in the present study may signify a substantial pathway for uptake of Hg in its elemental or vapor forms. Amalgam microparticles containing Hg would not like1 y be susceptible to gut absorption. Third, some tissues in the jaw such as gum mucosa and the tooth root and surrounding bone also absorbed Hg. The Hg absorbed into the jaw could be transported from bone marrow directly into bid by venous routes radio- graphically demonstrated for human circulation (17). The highly vascularized oral mucosa may likewise afford a route lor some Hg vapor transport dircctly into the systemic circulatio~i. We arc confident that the Hg uptake observed in this animal was not the result of procedural contamination during dental surgery because serial blood measure- ments taken for 24 h after surgery had no measurable radioactivity.

After the Hg released from dental amalgam is ab- sorbed into Mowl, the two principal target organs of rapid accumulation arc kidney and liver. Based on or- gan miglits for kidneys (250 g) and livcr (1000 g) in the adult cm, the total Hg conccrltratcd in the kidney in this animal was 1.86 rng, and in the liver it was 0.77 mg, aftcr only 29 days. Even during this relatively short time, the brain and smral endocrine glands (pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, and ovary) also showed evi- dence of Hg accumulation from the dental amalgams. 2644 Vol. 3 Dcc. 1989 The FASEB Journal HAHN El AL."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Si~se HgMver fillings rcmain in human teeth for 8-10 years, this would allow an extended opportunity for body tissues to be continuously cxposcd to Hg. Other investigators havc recently reported that Hg conccntra- tions in autopsied human brain and kidney are sig- nificantly higher in those subjccts with dcntal amal- gams than in subjccts with no amalgams (In). Each molar tooth of this shcep contained approxi- mately 425 mg Hg, only one-half the amount or Hg used in the average human occlusally involvcd molar filling. In humans, occlusally involved Hglsilver dental fillings frequently encompass additional tooth surfaces such as buccal, lingual. mesial, arid distal asl~cccs. Thus, such complex human tooth rcstorations have a greater surface arca exposed to grinding forces from which Hg may vaporize. This is in contrast to occlusal restorations in this sheep that are limited only to the oc- clusal surface and are totally supported circumfcrcn- tially by solid tooth structure. The natural ovinc molar is multiridged for forage grinding. Technical reproduc- tion of these ridges to their original exact functional oc- clusal Icvel in thc amalgam fillings was not possible. Therefore, the restorations were purposely overcarvcd, which created a concave occlusal surfacc, ensuring that the amalgams would not be functionally too high and thus subject to abnormally rapid wear. None of the Hg/silver fillings were lost from the mouth during the course of this study. We believe the shccp is a suitablc cxpcrirncntal model for the purpose of our investigations because it exhibits molar chewing mechanics that are similar to those of humans. Moreover, intra-oral air Hg vapor levels in the sheep are very similar to those reported in humans with the same number of amalgams (9). Al- though sheep may chew more than the average human does, it is likely that humans who arc chronic gum chewers or who exhibit bruxism (chronic grinding of teeth) would have daily periods of chewing that are cotnl)arablc to sliccp fcd two lncals per day. 'I'lic slrccp body might also compares favorably with humans, and tl~c shcep is the most widely uscd obs~ctrical modcl in research today. In other studies of sheep that werc not imagcd (19), we have established that Hg vaporized from dcntal amalgam fillings will progressively accumulate in both maternal and fetal tissues as a function of time. and tissue Hg levels will remain elevated in ucperimcnts run for as long as 140 days. Exposure of newborn lambs to milk suckled frotn ewes with dental amalgatns results in Hg uptake into tissues of the young. In North America 5.4% of the population display contact hypersensitivity to Hg (20). The pathogenesis of a variety of immediate or delayed Hg-induced hyper- scnsitivitv reswnses bv tlic immunc systcni rcsultitig in glomeru~bnepLitis h& been postul&d (21). ~x6ri- mental evidence sunwrts this contention because HE is capable of inducin; autoreactin T lymphocytes &d specific autoantibodies resulting in Hg-induced auto- immunity (22, 23), indicating a potential lor Hg to precipitate antibody-mediated tissue injury and auto- immune diseasc. l'iie kidney and cndocrinc glands arc known sites of autoimmune disorders,, which brings into question the long-term implications of Hg concen- tration in thcse tissucs from dcntal amalgams as dem- onstrated by the present study. Our laboratory findings,in this investigation are at variance with the anecdotal opinion of the dcntal profession, which claims that amalgam tooth fillings arc safe. .Experimental evidence in support of amalgam safety is at best tenuous (2). From our results we con- clude that dcntal amalgams can be a major source of chronic Hg exposure.

ZIFF Private Practice Orlando, FL Adv Dent Res 6931-134, September. 1992 Abstract-Since all dental restorative materials are foreign substances, their potential for producing adverse health effects is determined by their relative toxicity and bioavailability. as well as by host susceptibility. Adverse health effects to dental restoratives may be local in the oral cavity or systemic, depending on the ability of released components to enter the body and, if so, on their rate of absorption. The medical scientific community is now in general agreement that patients with dental amalgam fillings arc chronically exposed to mercury, that the average daily absorption of mercury from dental amalgam is from 3 to 17 mimgramsper day. and that the amalgam mercury absorption averages 1.25-65 times tbe average mercury absorption from dietary sources(WorldHea1th Organization, 1991).Thehealth significance of this chronic mercury exposure is now king investigated by several medical research groups.

Investigations have documented the harmful effects of various dental 1 materials. including amalgam. on dental pulp tissue. This topic will not be addressed. since proper handling and pulpal protection have minimized this problem. It has been well-documented in the dental literature. beginning with Chase (1878), that electrical cumnts arc &mated when amalgam fillings are placed in teeth. Investieationsconducted in Sweden failed to find a comla~ion - between the degm of electrical current generated by dental amalgams and the occumnce of gemral oral and systemic symptoms thought to be attributed to \"oral galvanism\". There have been no investigations of the potential impact of these vagrant cumnts on oro-facial neuromuscular function. EFFECTS OF DENTAL AMALGAM ON PERIODONTAL DISEASE It has been well-documented and referenced that claqsic signs - of chronic mercury exposure include gingivitis, alveolar bone loss. loosenine and loss of teeth. bruxism. metallic taste. oral ulce&n. & excessive salivation (Shafer et al., 1958:) Several early reports amibuted periodontal pathology to elcctrogalvanism resulting from dissimilar metals. Phillips (1973) has stated. \"When contacting dissimilar base metal alloys an present in the on1 cavity. &ctacular examples of tomion and soft and hard tissue destruction have been rcponed.\" This position was affirmed by Lemons at the 1984 NIDR Worlcshopon the Biocompatibility of Metals inDmtistry WR, 1984): Thefm formal investigationof theeffect of dental amalgam on the periodontal sauchu~ was by Zander (1957). Clinical and histologic examination confmed inflammatory response in gingival tissue adjacent to amalgam fillings. The author concluded: \"Clinical observations of a chronic inflammatory reactionof thegingivaltisswar~ndrestmtimsarr confinmd by the present mvestigati on...These is no doubt that not only dental calcuius but also the materials used in restorative dentistry may be aconeibuting factor in gingivaldiscasc\"; and 'In patients in whom such clinical m~toms as chronic - gingivitis. rrcumnt mcrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and periodontal pockets do appear, such conditions can sometimes be mated successfully only by removal of gingival tis-ues to below the margin of dental ~~torations.\" These finding were confirmed by App (1961). who concludcd: \"The amalgam restoration produced a chronic inflammation of the adjacent gingival tissues. The tissue response to amalgam is the same as the time response to calculus. Since calculus is an etiological factor in periodontal disease and the sulcus epithelium responds to amalgam as it"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO 132 Z~FF ADV Dim Rn SEINIBU 1992 does to calculus, these restorative materials must also be considered etiologic factors in periodontal disease.\" At this point. it was not certain if the adverse effects wen a result of plaque accumulation on the amalgam fillings or from components in the fillings themselves. Trott and Sherkat (1964) conducted aconuolled clinical study on 82medical and dental students. Oral hygiene was strictly monitored. and the study miteria ruled out several factors which cancausegingival disease, either alone or in combination. Thirty-five of the 82 subjects had significant gingival disease. Results showed a correlation between gingival disease and amalgam fillings as compared with contralateral amalgam-free sites in the same subjects. These Findigs were colrfymed by Sanchez Sotrcs er 01. (1969). who conducted a histologic analysis of gingival tissue adjacent to amalgam fillings and of control tissues. The inflammation intensities were 1.6 for control tissues, 1.8 for tissues adjacent to polished amalgam, and 2.5 for tissues adjacent to unpolished amalgam. The authors concluded that the inflammation resulted from chemical factors, rather than from the mechanical characteristics or textureof the restorations. Trivedi and T alii (1973) alsoconducted a histologicanalysis of gingival tissue adjacent to dental ~cstoratives, including amalgam. An inflammatory reaction occumd at 625% of the tissue sites in contact with amalgam, and proliferation of epithelium occurred in 68.7% of the sites adjacent to amalgam. Turgeon et al. (1972) conducted a clinical investigation on 16 children between the ages of 11 and 17. Thiiy amalgam Class II fillings provided 32 expuimental papillae and 44 proximal surf- to,be studied. Comsponding conorlatd sites without amalgam fillings sewed as controls. Their fmdings were: \"Clinical procedures involved in restoring posterior teeth with Class II amalgam restorations caused an immediate gingival intlammation chanrctaized by aythaM and incrclsedcrevicular depth, but without signir~cant migration of the epithelial attachment.\" After eight months. the experimental areas showed significantly more erythema than did the control areas. Frcden ef al. (1974) biopsied gingival tissue adjmt to dental amalgam fdlings and wntmltissue in contact with intact tooth structure. The tissues were analyzed for mercury content by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotomeby. All of the biopsies which had been in contact with amalgam fillings showed markedly higher mercury contents than did the control biopsies. Mercury content in subject si was 19-380 pglg (mean = 147) and 1 - 10 pglg (mean = 3) \"R i control sites. Using three independent criteria, Goldschmidt et al. (1976) confumed that from 1V to 104 molar conanoations of corrosion product ions liberated fromdental amalgam produced injurious effects on human gingival fibroblasts in virro. Inhibition of amino acid incorporation into protein-likematerial was seen with eluates of amalgam and with ionic solutions of most metals comprising dental amalgam. Mercury, silver, copper. and zinc ions in 105 molar concenrrations caused damage. Compound cytotoxic effects occurred at 1w molar wnccnaation. Fisher cr al. (1984) confumed several earlier reporu in finding alveolar bone resorption to be significantly higher - under Class 11 amalgam fillings than in control sites after four years. Fifty-four paired interproximal amalgam fillings. extended subgingivally vs. umxtended, were placed in 43 subjects and compand with control sites. The rate of alveolar crest resorption for the unextended Fillings was similar to that of controls but was significantly higher for those amalgams extended subgingivally. Siblerud (1990) wmparcd oral health parameters of 50 subjects with amalgam fillings with those of 51 subjects without amalgams. Amalgam subjectsdisplayed moregingival bleeding, periodontal disease, metallic taste, and foul breath than did the amalgam-free group. An additional 86 subjects were surveyed before and after amalgam removal. In this group, 86% of the bral cavity symptoms were either eliminated or improved after amalgam removal. DENTAL AMALGAM AND ORAL LICHEN PLANUS Finne er 01. (1982) tested 29 patients with oral lichen planus for contact allergy to dental materials and found 62% of the subjects to be allergic to mercury. All of the subjects had amalgam fillings. The amalgams wen removed in four of the subjects, with total mission of the lesions occurring in three of these and c01lsidcra61e improvemt in the fourth. Mobadcen ct al. (1984) found 16% of 67 subjects with 4 lichen planus to be allergic to mercury. Of the 67 subjects, 64 had amalgam fillings. Bolewska eta!. (1990) found high levels of mercury in lichen planus lesions adjacent to amalgam fillings. DENTAL AMALGAM AND MERCURY ALLERGY Djuassi and Bemva (1%9) investigated the incidence of allergy to dental amalgam mi its compomnu in 180 subjeas with amalgam fillimgs and 60 controls with no amalgams. None of the controls exhibited positive reactions to amalgam or its components. Ofthe subjects. 16.1% exhibited an allergic response to amalgam and 1 1 .O% were alicrgic to mercury. Of subjects with amalgam fillings for up to five yean. 58% showed positive reactions, while 2252% of the subjects with amalgam fillings formorethan five year shad positivereactions. White and Brandt (1976) patch-tested 3% dcntal students and found a weakcornlation of increasing incidence of mercury allergy to length of time subjects had amalgam fillings. Of subjects having amalgam fillings for two yeas or less. 3.8% had positive mercury patch tesu, while 6.0% of those with amalgam fillings for more than five years wuc positive. Miller et al. (1987) tested 171 dental students and found a greater cornlation to the number of amalgam fillings subjects had than to the length of time the fillings wen in place. The prcmtage of subjects testing positive to mercury ranged from 26.9% to 38.7% by class. CLINICAL REPORTS OF DENTAL AMALGAM AND SYSTEMIC PATHOLOGY The medical scientific community is now awarc of the chronic exposurc to mmury that patients receive from dental amalgam fillings.. Controlled investigations arc now under way. and"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO some preliminary results have appeared in medical and dental journals. Attempts to correlate che pathophysiologic effects of mercury from dental amalgam to measurements of mercury in blood or urine will not be addressed, since the National Institute of Dental Research formally acknowledged these parameters to be invalid in I984 (NIDR. 1984.) Ahlquist er al. (1988) reported no difference in 30 specific questionnairesymptoms in 1024 women with amalgam fillings. The subjects weredivided into two groups, one with fewer than five surfaces of amalgam and the other with 20 or more surfaces of amalgam. The number of amalgam surfaces was determined by panoramic x-rays, and there was no control group of amalgam-free references. Lavstedt and Sundberg (1989) surveyed 1204 subjects by means of 14 questions and four clinical tests. Subjects were divided into five groups, with mean numbers of amalgam surfaces being 6.4, 21.1, 32.6, 39.2. and 37.9. No positive comlations were found. Siblerud (1989) compared psychological parameters of 50 subjects with amalgam fdlings (avenge. 10.1 amalgams in males and 9.8 in females) with those of 51 subjects without amalgam fillings. Two mental health questionnaires and two laboratory tests for evaluation of tissue mercury burden were utilized. An additional 86 subjects wm surveyed by health questionnaire after amalgam removal. The findings suggested that inorganic mercury exposure from dental amalgam fillings does adversely effect the mind and emotions. In a second study. Siblerud (1990) investigated cardiovascular parameters in 50 subjects with and 5 1 subjects without amalgam fillings. Subjects with amalgams had significantly higher blood pressure. lower heart rate, lower hemoglobin. and lower hunatocrit. Hemoglobin, hematoait, and red blood cells were significantly lower when correlated to increased levels of urine mmury. The amalgam subjects had agmter incidence of chest pains. tachycardia, anemia, fatigue, and tendency to tire easily to be tired in the morning. In a preliminary study on two subjects. Eggleston (1984) reponed alterations off-lymphocyte percentages after removal of amalgam fdhgsand upon re-insmionof amalgams. Mackert .r al. (1991) investigated total numbers of leukocytes. percentage of lymphocytes, absolute numbers of lymphocytes. and lymphocyte subset populations in 21 subjects with an average of 7.8 (f 3.7) occlusal surfaas of amalgam and 16 subjects with no amalgam fillings. He found no immune system differences in subjects with and without amalgam fdlings. Molii (1990) investigated several health parameters by means of blood tests and found no comlatiw to the presence of amalgam fillings. The investigation was conducted in four parts: Pan I compared 12 subjects having a mean number of 34.6 imslgam surfaces with 12 controls having a mean number of 30.5 amalgam surfaces. All of the controls had amalgam fillings. ?he 12subjects had symptomsthought tobeattributed to oral galvanism. Part II studied two groups of dental pmomel with no indication that any subject in either group lacked amalgam fillings. Eighteen subjects in the high-urine-mercuty group had a mean urinary valueof 6.5 pglg creatinine and a mean number of 39.9 amalgam surfaces. Thineen subjects in the low-mercury-urine group had a mean urinary value of 2.0 pgl g creatinine and a mean number of 31.5 amalgam surfaces. Part I11 consisted of eight recent immigrants to Sweden, none of whom had ever had dental amalgam fillings and were in need of dental care. Amalgam fillings (16.1 mean surfaces) were placed in one sitting ineachsubject, and thesubjects were followed for three months. After amalgam placement. the erythrocyte glutathione pemxidase level in the study's lone female elevated to twice the level of the other seven subjects, so she was dropped from the study. The remaining subjects exhibited a significant increase in plasma selenium and urine beta 2-micro~obulin, but both indicators remained within the reference interval. During the short duration of this study. the plasma and urine mercury levels of the subjects failed to reach levels found in the subjects in the other three studies. In Pan IV, all amalgam fillings were removed from ten healthy subjects, with a mean number of 19.9amalgam surfaces. Parameters were compared before amalgam removal to 12 months after amalgam removal and to a control group of ten subjects with a mean number of 24.7 amalgam surfaces. Molin (1990) concluded that dental amalgam contributes to the mercury concentration in plasma md urine. but that the mercury exposure docs not influence selenium status or organ functions. CASE REPORTS OF ADVERSE SYSTEMIC EFFECTS TO DENTAL AMALGAM Cumnt documentation of case repons of adverse systemic effects of dental amalgam has also appeared. The time limitations of this pmentation do not permit discussion of wlia reports. Katsunuma er 01. (1990) rcponed r ase of exercise-induced anaphylaxis that ~omcled only aftcrnmoval of the patient's amalgam fillings. Zamm (1990) documented 22 patients with multiple sevm immune dysfunctions chat wue Rsisurnt to standard rhuapies. After rtmovd of dental amalgam filliags, an improvemult of 63% of the specific symptoms was noted. Since April of 1991. 320 Advvse Reaction Reports to dental amalgam have been filed with the United States Food and hug Administration (1991). with more continuing to be fded each day.

Case No. 7 182281 The Cow apd with the ADA and dismissed it from the case, leaving the defendant dentist, manufacturers, and distributor adrift. This information, if it ever reaches than, should send chills down the spines of amalgam-using dentists. In the face of ever increasing scientific documentation casting doubt on the safety of dental amalgam, the only defense for its use has been the unwavering support of organized dentistry. This su port has functioned lather like a security blanket, ostensibly offering assurance of proteaion. Now, comes the nve i' ation that - in a court of law - organized dentistry washes its hands of le@ responsibility for the potential adverse effects tiom the use of dental amalgam. The ADA has also issued formal nottfication that,as a voluntary professional o anization. it has no le al authority to regulate the use of any dental maw (ADA. Letter fium Executive ~lrcctor l.8 Coady. DDS.. 19 kb 1985). Ruther. the ADA has admitted that there is no scientific documentation establishing the safety of dental amalgam and the defense of safety is based only on the fact that it has been used for over 150 yean (ADA, Division of Scientific Affairs. When Your PatientsAsk About Mercury in Amalgam. JADA, 120:395-8,1990): The ho e that use of dental amalgam en be defended on-the basis that it is a legally approved dental device, a ted and classi& by the Food and Drug Adrmnstration (FDA), 1s also a hollow dream! contrary to popular belief, the%^ has nartr accepted anddassified mixed dental amalgam. Instead, the FDA has acapted \"Dental Mercury\" and \"Aplgam Allo as \"Safe and Effective\" dental devices (Food and Drug Admiitration. Dental Devices: General Rovlsm. and &ssification of 110 Devices: Fi Rule. Fedaal Regista, ~2(l55)~0082-~OlO6.l2 Aug 1987). In 1993. in the widely acknowl+ ed Public Health Svvia (PHs) doaument on dental amal . the FDA admitted that it had never accepted-and~classgcdmixeddental amalgam (United States Pvblic ~ealth cia. Jknral Amalgam: A Scientific Review and Rtmmmmded Public Health Service Strategy for RcSearch. Education and Regulation. Commit- tee to Coordinate Environmental Health and Related Progtams. Regulatory Work Group Report (FDA). Pagcs V1-2. 1 993). Interestingly, the*ADA also refuses to certify mixed dmoll amalgam. Like the FDA,-the-ADA. certifies \"Dtntal Macury\" and \"Amalgam Alloy\" seprately. not requiring biocompatibility testing for either produa (American Dental Association. ANSYADA Specification No. 1 \"For Alloy for Dtntal Amalgam\"; ANSYADA Specification No. 6 \"For Dental Menwy.\" 21 1 E. Chicago Ave., Chicago, IL 6061 1). it should not surprise anyone that the Chairman of the FDA Dental Device Panel that recommended this policy to the FDA in 1980 was also the Direaor of the ADA Council on Dental Materials; Instrumm.and Devicts (CDMIE) at the time (Faod and hug Admiimtion. Medical Device Classification Procdurts. Federal Register, 40(97)21848-2185 1.19 May 1975). This same puson -John W. Stanford, PhD. - has wrim a letter stating that dental amalgam is a \"readon product\" mamhcmrcd-b-y thc &mist (ADA. Later from John W. Stanford, W.D., Direaor, Council on Dental MatcriaLs. Instruments and Equipment, 22 May 1986). Thaefon, according to Dr. Stanford, mixed dental amalgam cannot be certified by the ADA and is solely the rcs nsibii of the dentist. Once again not surprisingly, tht FDA has also put the same wording-into writing (Food ankg AListration. Lctta from Lillian Ym, R.D.. Director. Division of Ob-Gyn, ENT, and Dental Devices, ma of Device Evaluation, 2 April 1991). The ADA. by the way, has not hesitated .to artifj; OW \"&-dtion products;'-such as composites; cements and irnprtssmn materials. - All of this adds up to one conclusion, if there ever is a legal liability for placing dental amalgam into humans, the practicing dentist has been left holding the bag! This is funher compounded by another faaor. The FDA has categorized mercury-as a-\"druga-in its +tiom for First Aid Mataials: Since scientific documentation has clearly proven that mercury is released from in VIVO dental amalgam on a daily basis and does accumulate in human tissues over time, the ~lacunent of dunal amalgam constitutes implantation of a time-nleased hiahlv toxic drur! into humans. This articular if~g, mucuj,'bXbctn kientifically pmin to be more neurotoxic than l&d;cadmium,-or even arsenic (Sh RP; Obusteiner,EJ. Metals and Nwotoxic Effects. J Comp Pathology. 91 235-244.198 1 b). Legal precedent has established that in any other medical . . ciraunstance, this cannot be done without informed consent. -. ' The statement \"the ADA owes no legal due of can to protea the public from allegedly dangerous produas used by dentists,\" which was filed in the legal brief by the ADA, raises another important question. That is. who does have the legal duty of can to protect the public? The answer is obvious - besides the practicing dentists themselves - the Boards of Dentistry of the sevd states! This has been established by law, by the State Dental Practice Act in each state."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO To this point, Boards of Dentistry in many states have totally ignored the burgeoning published scientific evidence uesuonin the safe of dental amalgam. Their argument has been. soldy and ud~ively. the. position of organized lentistry. h e ADA %a s even blished encouragement to Boards of Dennsuy to discipline denusts opposed to the use of dental mercury (ADA. 198finnual Session. JADA. 1 M:Z, Jan 1987). Now that the ADA bas formally and legally removed itself from responsibility for the use of dental amalgam, the Boards of Dentistry have no defense for disciplining mercury-fret dentists. Indeed, in view of the FDA's refusal to t and classify dental amalgam, the Boards are faced with defending punishment for opposition to a dental device that s no legal acceptance. In view of the incnasing tendency for Dental Boards in some states to discipline mercury-free dentists, the situation with the Boards is specially important. Some dentists have been severely, and mgically, punished. Instead of disciplining dentists opposed to dental amalgam, the Boards of Dentistry amally have a athe This duty has been establiihe~h state! Unforhmtely, these same laws have clauses obviously designed to protect the Boards (and the dental establishment). For example. Board members art usually immune from civii rosecuuon. unless \"malice\" can be dmrly proven. As a result, the Boards of Dentistry have evolved into a conception &t they arc above the law. They believe, quite apparently, that they can do whatever they wish, so long as it is in accordance with organized dentistry. Now. in the case of dental amalgam, this \"security blanketn from organized dentistry has been eliminated. The Boards of Dentistry must now face the prospect of addnssmg the documented scientific evidence on amalgam-derived mercury exposure without the benefit of supporting scientific documentation or estabiishment position. Cony the belief of memben of the Boards. the arc not above the law.

The Board must then defend its actions from charges of malfeasance and misfeasance in office, without benefit of scientific documentation or the support of organized dentistry. The final element in this issue is that of Standard of Care.\" In the event of charges of \"malpractice.\" the Standard of Care concept has been very potent. However, in the case of use of dental amalgam. a new factor is evolving. The scientific documentation has dearly established that munvy from invivo dm1 amalgam fillings continuously transfers to body tissues and accumulates with time. Published medical research is now showing that this mercury exposure is not without risk. Tbe Standard of Care defense for use of dcnd amalgam now amounts to this: \"I am not llty of eg ply patient with amalgam mercury because mo~ of the dentists in my area .arc deg the same thing.\" &ether ths specious argument holds up m Covm of irw rcmam to be seen: the Courrr dm&. ************ CANADIAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION BLAMES GOVERNMENT FOR DENTAL AMAM;AM! The Canadian Dental Association (CDA) sent an astounding letter to its membership on 21 June 1995. The opening pangraph stated: \"The Canadian Dental Association has learned that more questions may soon be raised by the news maha about the safety of dental amalgam. This may come m the wake of release of news, cordmed by the German Dcnd Association, that Gumany is lacing furtha limitations on the use of amalgam, includin banmg its use for pregnant women as of 1 July 1995. dosa to home, amalgam safety may again k qucsti~ntd fofowing the release of a Health Canada report scheduled to be made public m July.\" The last sentence is in reference to an announcement that Health Canada ma lithe number of amalgam fillinp is cidiuri can hie (reported in Bio-Rda Nrlmcr, l1(3):6, May 19YS). dh this imp, the CDA has apparently admitted that the intention of Hcalth Canada caanot be stopped.

This advii has mt been heeded. Instead, Health Canada has only recently launckd a review of the literature. The rrscarchu reviewing this issue is attempting to establish a rrcommended total daily intake for mcrcury. With this, his report may recommend placing a limitation on the munbu of amalgam fillings an individual should receive.\" Accompanying the letter, the CDA included a new \"wrapamund\" addendum to its current position on dental amalgam, which cltarly attempts to demonstrate a responsible coxem on its part ova the years and pointing to the Canadian Government as being unresponsive regarding the safety of dental amalgam issue. 'Ibe addendum also accuses the scientific community of playm a role \"in the dissunination of one-sided and incomplete information in xcccnt years.\" Thii information, the later statd pmvides a vq laorthy isommendation, specifically, \"an increased emphasis on informed consent is good advice for the dental profession to follow, whcther theproadun involves dental amalgam or any other restorative material.\" The CDA is appamt.ly warning its manbadup to anticipate a drastic change in the status of the use of dental amalgam and trying to plead that this is the fault of everyone else but them."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO -- ~ --- Journal d Orlomolecular Medicine Vol. 6.

On March 15,1991, the Food and Drug Administration convened a hearing on the \"Potential Toxicity of Dental Amalgam\". 1. was one .of the .invited .speakers. The following is based on thespeech I delivered at that meeting. .. My purpose in this presentation is to make three points: 1. Mercury jrom dental amalgam in- ducessyrnptoms in a sensitivegroup ojthe population that has also been observed to be sensitive to xenobiotic substances. [Xenobiotic substances are substances which arejoreign to the natural state ojan organism. Examples of such foreign sub- stances are petrochemical vapors, chlori-- nated hydrocarbons, sulfites, and metals which are not metabolically useful.) 2. This sensitive group serves as a mar- ker that warns of the potential danger of dental mercury to the rest of the population who are also at risk but may not yet exhibit symptoms. 3. Dental mercury should be banned. 1. Symptomatology The following is a small sample of common symptoms that I have observed, to jm~r0v-e when mercury fillinns are- -umnwUatigue, headache, central ner- vous system dysfunction, inappropriate coldness, sugar intolerance, sugar cravings, gastrointestinal disturbances, myalgia, ar- thralgia, rhiniiis, dermatitis, asthma, and genitourinary dysfunction.l These symp- toms are so varied and seemingly discon- nected that misdiannosis or no diagnosis is more often the rule. These and many other symptoms can also be produced ak willin these sensitive patients by exposure to xenobiotic substances. These symptoms of nenoti~tic ir.:c!tr- ance often develop after dental mercury has been inserted into a patient's mouth and remit after the filling has been re- moved. The duration of time before the onset of symptoms subsequent to the inser- tion of dental mercury and the duration of time before the remission of symptoms after the mercury has been removed varies from individual to individual due to ene ~lymorphism.

This clitrically effect rchtionship indicates that the pro- tective mechanism against xenobi~tic~oi- soning has been compromised by the presencc of mercury in the tissues.

In some cases evcn the smallest amount of table sugar will produce a temporary \"high\" followed by one to two days of symptoms such as those mentioned above. These symptonls gradually improve to some ex- tent over a one to two year period after. complete removal of dental mercury. The following is one of the possible explana-' tions for this observed phenomenon. Thiamlne is important in the decar- boxylaticn process of cellular respira- tion.' 4 There is a critical step at the entrance hto the aerobic oxidation cycle (Krebs cyde) from the anerobic (Embden- ,Meyerhof) pathway. This step involves - ?-Us. Coenzyme A contains a sulfhydryl group (-SH). These \"-SH\" groups are s-e&.beinginactivatrd hoimuct mercury isavailable, and only limited atr.ounts of functional coenzyme A will be ;:milable. Adding ;nore thiamine will enhance an impaired area of the metabolic cycle and a compensate for its inefficiency by pushing the reactio;'; \"to the right\". as follows: The patient wii! more efficiently utilize what- ever limiter! amounts of still unpoisoned coenzyme .-\\ are available by a greater amount of thiamine provided to the decar- mercury and arsenic interfere wi& thia- mine-dependent enzymes (and exces~thia- *can be protective, to some extent, agalnsi poisoning from both metals). Ar- senic poisoning can imitate thiamine defi- ciency disorders, as it interferes with the thiamine-dependent conversion of pyru- vate to acetyl coenzyme A.6 These relationships also add weight (but no absolute proof) to the concept that thiamine colalhbuaktnina-pdictive. way to determine if mercury intoxication - 1s present and benefit could ensue from the removal of amalgam dental fillings. Such benefit from taking thiamine isa frequent finding in my practice. Clinical Cases of Dental Mercury Poisoning that Parallel Laboratory Investigation 1. The T-4 helper cellsperform a major function -ogical protective process that defends against invading pa- thogenic organisms and cancer cells. David ! Eggleston, D.D.S., at the University of Southern California School of Dentistry showed that when he removed the mercury amalgam fillings from four volunteers, thc_~umberd T-4 helper cells increased bv 5OLHe was then'able. to depress the level of T-4 helper cells by 50% by reinsert- ing mercury fillings. When he finally removed these last mercury fillings and replaced them with a non-mercury substi- tute, the T-4 helper cells recouped this 50% loss.' The following two clinical case studies parallel Dr. Eggleston's laboratory work and show thatdental mercury do& sup- press the immune response. Cue of Mr. J.S.

Within one month after these fillings were removed, his condition star!ed to abate. By three months he was en tire1 y [ree of furuncles, and the antibio- tics were stopped. He has been off antibio- tics and has remained free from furuncles this last year-and-a-half. Over the last year his chronic eczema of 30 years' duration 1 has practically disappeared, and he is now able to eat foods that were previously allergenic, if they are not eaten in excess. 1 Case of Ms. A1.C. This is a 22-year-old woman who at age 1 I levelopedg varietv ofsvmnlr\\mcw . . hich later became 'so that she had to leave college. Numerous medical investigations failed to revcal the reason for her illness. History revealed that her illcess started at age 11, one year after she recommended that her nine mercurftill- ings be removed. -The following notes are from a letter I received from Ms. M.C. when she was five weeks mercury-free: sleeping well - I wake uprested. fatigue gone, physically stronger, meatal acuity recovered, food reactions less severe. pain on side no longer constant or extreme, memory restored, no more diarrhea, headaches rare and not severe, appetite improved, no longer constantly cold, co-ordination returned, immune sys- tem strengthened - bad cut healed quickly with no invection. (Ms. M.C. alwaysdevel- oped an infection whenever her skin was brtken. She described that even when she used prophylactic topical antibiotics, she still developed infections. This represents a cranifestation of immune dysfunction. Eggleston is rightl) Her complexion im- proved, menstrual problems were all but eridicated, her overall health improved, not only physically and mentally. but also emotionally, and her self-confidence was .restored. 2. The rapidity with which mercurv gervame body is;demonstrated in the following experiment. Fritz Lorscheider, Ph.D., of the University of Calgary School of Medicine, inserted ordinary mercury Within 29 days, mekurv could be found in every organ in the shee~s' bodies.' A parallel case study that clinically confirms this experiment is that of Ms. S.B. This 22-year-old female was in good health until age 20. Within weeks of having a single_mercurv filling installed, she developed a progressive illness. Most of her symptoms were similar to those of Ms. M.C. (above). Iadvised her to have this single mercury filling removed. Within 17 days after removal, she reported that her symptoms started toabate. By three months her general health had improved, and she was able to eat most foods without diffi- culty, provided they were not eaten in excess. 1 reported to the Food & Drug Administration 30 similar cases.out of the hundreds that I have seen. =were filed - - - as \"Adverse Reaction w'.

Xenobiotic Intolerance and the Cy tochrome P-450 System Euidence of Xenobiotic Intolerance in the General Population A segment of the population is intolerant to xenobiotic substancesd. My findings reveal that this segment often develops . intolerance or has existing intolerance aggravated by the presence of dental mer- cury. It appears that the cytochrome P450 enzyme system may be involved in this hypersensitivity via its \"assigned\" role as a protective mechanism against poisoning from xenobiotic substances. The ability of a subset of the population Lo resist toxicity from exposure to xeno- biotic chemicals is, among other things, m-rtional to the quantitv and a- gf cytochrome P450 present. There are individual d~tterences in these two factors, and the effective protection in a population varies with the frequency distribution curve. The intensity of clinical symptoms of xenobiotic intolerance similarly varies with this curve and is a function o- -m,\" 47 r9 50 5' making for a wide variety of confusing symptoms. Work at the Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis at the National Institutes of Health demonstrated that theseextremes in xenobiotic intolerance in individuals exist, and that these extremes are a function of the effectiveness of cytochrome P450, which is a result of genetic differences.52 The Metabolism oj Debrisoo&e Setves as a Prototype for Other Cases oj Xenobiotic Intolerance The occurrence in the general popula- tion of a human autosomal recessive td for P450dbl is abut one in twelve.51 The P45Ua61ernyme presides over the hydroxy- lation of debrisoquine, an antihypertensive agent used in Europe and Canada but not 1.1 the United States (hence the Xb\" suffix). This enzyme also inactivales a variety of other xenobiotic molecules. Individuals with this defective gene me- iabolize the debrisoquine at 1/10 to 1/200 1 of dental mercury. Dental mercury further compromises these individuals by adding to their meta- bolic burden by inactivation of the thio groups that protect their cytochrome P450 system. These -tally comp_ro.m&l jndividuals will be damaged by even so-' called \"small quantities\" of mercury. It is tantamount to compounding a misdemea- nor into a felony. My clinical observations confirm this relationship: that there is a similar wide variety in the ability of. individuals to resist poisoning from chemicalsanddental mercury. Thirty yearsof observations have convinced me that these two grou~s. the chemically sensitive and the mercury sen- sltlve, are In tact onwup. Some Specifics About the . Cyfochrome Pl5O System This system contains a variety of en- zymes, all with thecommon characteristic of containing an oxveen-bi ' All of these enzyme- oxidative (elemransfa) rearaThe mechanism by which cytochrome P450 system protects against xenobiotic sub- stance involves a two-phase reaction: Phase I - Oxidation of' o he xenobiotic molecule; Phase 11 - The, oxidized inter- mediate form of the xenobiotic molecule is hydrated or conjugated with glutathione or glucuronic acid or sulfaie. The result is a water-soluble end product that can be excreted through the kidneys. Laboratory Conjirmation oj the Clinical Observation that Mercury Aggravates and Induces Xenobiotic intolerances It is well known that there arc protective -SH groups, i.e., protective thio groups which function to protect the cytochrome P-450 system.53 54 Theaffinity of mercury' for -SH groups is ten times greater than its affinity for oxygen and chlorine.55 Mercury will bind firmly to and inactivate these I critical -SH groups, which protect the cytochrome P-450 system.5' 54 It is by this process that the unique vrotective function of the rate found in the normal population. of these -SH group;is lost due to mercury Thus they are much less able to deal with poisoning and the cytochrome P-450 en- exposure to this and other. xenobiotic zyme system becomes compromised. - I - srrbstances.

YetJraudu- lant dental mislabeling persists, with the -tanard that these amalgam lillings are called \"silver\" because they are silver- colored. Why not call them mercury fill- ings? Mercury is the same color. To call them \"amalaam\" fillings is even m. It is the eauivalent of - calling the a \"soup\" ol mehs without mentioning%e ingredients of the soup. \"Soup\" means nothing to the average consumer. The following are some clinical obse yalionsthat the indentical symptoms foun in these two groups (the xenobioticall intolerant group and the mercury-intoler ant group) are in fact the symptoms of single group. The xenobiodcally sensitiv 3 group routinely develops many syraptoms from exposure to mercury following either a simple dental cleaning or the removal of a mercury filling. The mercury \"normally' released during these procedures provides an indicator system for identifying this mercury-sensitive group. Dental Cleaning and Amalgam Polishing During the abrasive cleaning process mercury is released and then absorbed by the patient. I have used dental cleaning as"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO a diagnostic test for mercury intolerance by observing that significant symptoms are routinely produced in this group short- ly after the cleaning and may last up to two weeks. ~tter the cleaning process symptoms are further produced by exposure to small amounts of mercury that aresubsequently released when the mercury fillings are polished. This -removes a layer of previously reacted metal that was in a higher state of oxidation (i.e., it was less reactive and thus more stable). The polish- ing reveals the shiny unreacted, unoxidized and more reactive metal below. Following the cleaning process, this shiny, more reactive metal is additionally released by mastication over the next few weeks. The ?elease of mercury provides symptoms throughout this period. The Process o/ Removal of Mercury Fillings via .Dental Drilling A cloud of mercury vapor and particles is dispersed by the abrasion of the drill. Even with all the precautions taken by using multiple simultaneous suctions. it has been my experierlcc that this group ol xenobiodcally intolerant patients routine- ly get markedly ill from exposure to mer- cury. The symptoms of mercury poisoning are identical to the symptoms developed fro;m exposure to xenobiotic chemicals. I have seen these symptoms last from days to weeks after removal of a single mercury filling. That these symptoms from cleaning and drilling are due to mercury poisoning is proven to my satisfaction by the fact that - ~dministration of selenium prod- abrupt relief of svmpum~ within how The protective effect of selenium against mercury is the most likely reason for this beneficial effect. Selenium and the \"Tuna Obfuscalion\" Some mercury advocates say that there is more mercury in tuna than from dental mercury exposure. They leave out the important fact that the tuna protects itself from poisoning by selectively absorbing two molecules of selenium for every mole- cule of mercury.22 2s Thus, & consuw despite the presence of the mercury. No such protection via a selenium antidote is afforded by the dental mercury filling. Diagnosis The method I use to determine that a clinical-pathological relationship exists between dental mercury and xenobiotic sensitivity is as follows. I am a dermatolo-_ gist. Dermatologists are unique1 y able to zerve the skin as a visible and objective indicator of disease. The skin shows us a relation between the presence and severity of an external eruption vis-a-vis the prt- sence and severity of an internal disease. , The patient's skin condition and his internal medical symptoms get better and worse when I remove and then reintroduce a causative agent, such as an inhalant, a food, or a chemical. Thus, as a dermatolo- gist, I am able to clinically identify the responsible substances causing the disease and then produce and verify a cure.

Because of its strong affinity to oxygen, aluminum never occurs as a metal in nature but is found only in the form of its compounds, such as alumina. This strong affinity to oxygen also explains why it withstood all attempts to prepare it in its elemental form until well into the 19th century. The metal's name is derived fiom alumen, the Latin name for alum. In 1761 the French chemist Guyton de Morveau proposed the name alumine for the base in alum, and in 1787 Antoine Lavoisier identified alumine as the oxide of a then-undiscovered metal. In 1807 Sir Humphry Davy assigned the name alumium to the metal and later agreed to change it to aluminum. Shortly thereafter, the name aluminium was adopted to conform with the -ium ending of most elements, and this spelling is now in general use throughout the world, except in the United States (where the second i was dropped in 1925) and Italy (where alluminio is used). The role aluminum plays in human physiology is not known. The metal is ingested through food and water. Aluminum has been detected in the brain cells of Alzheimer's Disease patients. Physical Properties of Aluminum Aluminum, symbol At, is a silvery-white metal in Group mA of the periodic table. Its atomic number is 13, its atomic weight 26.9815. It constitutes between 8 to 14% of the Earth's crust, depending on the location. It is ductile, nonmagnetic, and an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. The density of aluminum at 20 deg C is 2.699 g/cu cm (0.1 lblcu in); it melts at 660.24 deg C and boils at 2,450 deg C. Aluminum is widely used in many kinds of products because a combination of properties gives it special advantages over other materials. Aluminum's electrical alloy has the highest conductivity per pound of any commercially sold conductor. Because aluminum is only one-third as dense as copper, it supplies about twice the conductivity per pound. For this reason more than 90% of the transmission and distribution lines in the United States are made fiom aluminum. Aluminum is an excellent conductor of heat as well. It is about 1.8 times as thermally conductive as copper by weight, depending on the alloy, and about 9 times as conductive as stainless steel. For this reason it is widely used in automobile radiators; cooling coils and fins; heat exchangers in the chemical, petroleum, and other industries; and heater fins in baseboard and other types of heaters. The aluminum industry, founded in 1854, is the newest of the nonferrous metal industries. In the United States, commercial production began in 1859 at a cost of $1 7 for a pound. Not until the late 1880s was a method found to bring prices down and permit aluminum to be used in a wide range of applications. The aluminum industry is now worldwide. 265"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The United States is the world's largest aluminum producer, followed by Canada, Australia, Norway, Brazil, and Germany. The United States is also the world's largest aluminum consumer. The U.S. aluminum industry consumes 1% of the nation's energy, largely in the form of electricity. The amount of electricity used per pound of metal in smelting, which accounts for about two-thirds of the industry's total energy consumption, has decreased steadily, and today the average is about 7 kwh. Aluminum can be recycled for less than 5% of the energy required for producing virgin metal. U.S. aluminum-can recycling provides over half the aluminum used in making new cans, and recycling of aluminum scrap equals almost half of total aluminum production. In 1963, the United States produced about 11.5 billion aluminum beverage cans. In 1985, over 70 billion were produced. The phosphoric acid in soft drinks, which leaches aluminum fiom the walls of the can, guarantees that each can of beverage delivers aluminum metal to the drinker. In addition, one of the most toxic by-products of aluminum manufacture, sodium fluoride, is added to many public water supplies. Aluminum in the Human Diet The majority of the human population in the industrialized nations ingest a minimum of 30 to 50 milligrams of aluminum metal per day. An examination of labels on consumer products will reveal that many of them contain the metal. Most foods contain aluminum products. Beverage cans, aluminum foil in contact with food, aluminum pots and pans and aluminum in drugs (including most antacids) insure that the cumulative load of aluminum in the human body eventually reaches critical level. Aluminum in consumer drugs is a big problem. Aspirin is commonly buffered with aluminum hydroxide, aluminum glycinate and other aluminum compounds. Vaginal douches contain potassium aluminum sulfate, ammonium aluminum sulfate, and alum. Antacids contain aluminum hydroxide, magaldrate, dihydroxyaluminum, and aluminum oxide. Antidiarrheal drugs contain aluminum magnesium silicate and kaolin, an aluminum salt. Cake mixes, self-rising flour, processed cheese, baking powder, food starch modifiers, pickling salts and anti-caking agents provide additional aluminum in the form of sodium aluminum, sodium aluminum sulfate, aluminum ammounium sulfate, and sodium aluminum silicate. Aluminum contaminates drinking water, milk and other products. Analysis of Deliberate Aluminum Dosing of Humans A curious practice arose for gold miners in Ontario, Canada, that involved deliberate inhalation of aluminum metal dust. One of the side effects of mining gold is a lung condition called silicosis, fiom the silica dust inherent in gold ore. At the McIntyre Porpupine Gold Mine, someone got the warped idea that miners should inhale aluminum dust, which would coat their lungs, and then when they coughed up the aluminum they would also expel the silica inhaled during the working day. Stupid is as stupid does.It was an absolutely insane practice - so insane that it lasted until 1980, when officials 'tiecided\" there was no evidence that the aluminum dust was doing any good against silicosis."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO In 1980, after this dubious practice was discontinued, an epidemiologist at Clark Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto, Dr. Sandra Rifat, heard about these miners and decided to study them to understand the effects levied on the men. She eventually tracked down over 1,300 men who had been miners since the 1940s. Of those, 647 agreed to participate in the study. After putting these men through cognitive tests (examining memory and logzcal thought), it was apparent that all the miners tests scored in the \"impaired\" range.26 You don't have to be a miner to inhale aluminum compounds. Dust from talcum powder, baby powder, cat-box litter, cement, asphalt mixes, tobacco smoke and ashes contain aluminosilicates. Complex ionic aluminosilicates go directly to the brain through the olfactory system.\" Much of the damage typical of Alzheimer's disease, coincidently, is found in the olfactory regions of the brain. Metal particulates are a signrficant constituent of the general atmosphere in many industrialized countries. These particulates are typically 1/50 the width of a human hair. The miniscule size of these particles enables them to join other elements floating in the blood. A darkfield microscopic examination of your blood will show heavy metals floating around. They also travel through cell walls and into the nucleus and directly affect the DNA. Yale University researchers in 1978 published a paper that estimated that 140,000 deaths a year are related to all forms of metallic air pollution compounds2*. Metallic air pollution now kills almost 300,000 people each year, and the toll is rising, despite the scientific evidence. No one is taking industry to task. The legislation during the administration of George Bush actually allowed an increase in industrial metallic particle emission, beainnina in 1995.~~ Toxic metals in the atmosphere include nickel, aluminum, titanium, beryllium, cadmium, arsenic, lead, mercury, iron, and manganese. The converted sulfbr and nitrogen oxides, plus the hydrocarbon emissions, constitute antigens that can cause cellular mutation.

It was overseen by Dan Quayle. The Council altered standards and issued operating permits to wer 35,000 polluting businesses. Quayle's Council reviewed EPA administrator William Redly's Clean Air Act proposals and added a provision to allow manufacturers and chemical companies to increase pollution levels without uublic review. In 1991, EPA General Counsel Donald Elliott wrote a memo declaring the Council's proposal to be illegal. William Reilly called for the public to be notified. The Council rejected the EPA proposal, and Bush directed the EPA to issue the rule. Reilly refused to do so, unless the Department of Justice declared it to be legal. Attorney General Ban issued a legality memo. On June 25, 1992, the new pollution rule was in. Now, under the \"Clean Air Act of 1990\", industries are allowed to actually increase atmospheric pollutants. Bill Clinton scrapped the Council of Competitiveness as soon as he got into office. It had already served its function - to subvert all existing environmental legislation that would interfere with the process of causing degeneration of the physical and mental capabilities of the population.

The Advent of Alzheimer's Front Organizations Because of the tremendous amount of accumulating evidence relating to aluminum and Alzheimer's disease, an eventual collision with the public is inevitable, along with litigation that promises to bankrupt the industries involved.31 In 1982, the \"Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association\" (ADRDA) was created. The research grant programs of ADRDA coincidently parallel those of the U.S. Public Health Service. By the end of 1990, 365 grants and awards totaling more than $18 million were funded by ADRDA. The seriousness of the problem is attracting the attention of both the government and industry - both are becoming concerned that the dimensions of the problem will become too obvious in society. In 199 1, Congress appropriated $247 million for \"Alzheimer's research\" - a 67% increase over 1990. Will \"Alzheimer's research\" do any better than 'kancer research': \"AIDS research': 'EMF research\" or any other program? No. All industries are beginning to cloak themselves in protective mantel's of financial contributions and political moves. The aluminum manufacturers have taken a lesson from the past successful activities of the tobacco industry, and are paying attention to the current troubles of the tobacco industry. The writing is on the wall. Is ADRDA an independent organization really concerned about Alzheimers and related disorders, or is it a fiont for industry destined to act as a buffer for pending public concern about the real causes? 'It is a matter of record that Edward Truschke, the executive director of ADRDq has admitted that ADRDA has received unrestricted grant monies from the Aluminum Association of Canada (ALCAN) and the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). .The international Alzheimer's disease meeting in Italy, held in July 1992, was sponsored in part by ALCAN. Research indicates that the two major aluminum companies take radically different approaches to the issue. ALCAN is aggressively hding research (which can direct the outcome of findings, of course) in order to permit the possibility of claiming (in the end) that they were looking for evidence that aluminum contributes toward Alzheimer's. ALCOq on the other hand, takes the typical approach of U.S. companies with something to lose - denial. They will not do the research because they want to be able to say that such research is not valid, and that they do not do research because they do not believe that their producted could be implicated. Interestingly and predictably, ADRDA's 'fesearch\" continues to find \"no connection\" between aluminum toxicity and Alzheimer's disease. No surprise there.32 pp -- -- 30~~te~parthic Annuals, Vol 11, 1983, p.38-59; Weiner, M., The Way of the Skeptical Nutritionist, New Uork, MacMillan, 1 98 1. \" It is perhaps with this in mind that Congress in 1995 began to work on legislation to limit damage and liability awards levied against corporations in the United States. 32 Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Assn, 70 East Lake St., Chiago, Illinois 60601, 1-800-621- 0379.

The evidence, whether they like it or not, is unrefutable. Environmental Considerations: Aluminum and Alzheimer's Disease There is an interesting parallel between the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and similar memory disorders, and the amount of aluminum in drinking water. A study published in Lancet, the journal of the British Medical Association, involved an evaluation of the geographical relationship between the aluminum content of drinking water and the prevalence of Alzheimer's over a ten year period. The study reported a 50% increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease in areas with high concentrations of aluminum. Even a small presence of aluminum in water has an These studies have been corroborated by studies done in other countries (other than the United States, in which such a study would be a conflict of interest and labelled \"irresponsible\"), especially in Norway and ~ustralia.~~ It is also interesting that studies of motorneuron diseases in Guam, where a tremendous increase in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has occurred, found parallels between ALS and high concentrations of aluminum in drinking water. Swedish studies of the Guam ALS problem conclude that mortality from motorneuron disease, especially among women, varies with the local water concentation of aluminum.36 In England, the estimate of the average adult intake of aluminum is 6mg/day, mostly from tea3', although the tannin in tea tends to reduce the aluminum content somewhat.38 Research conducted in 1988 conducted by the Medical Research Council 33The essence of this paradigm is to steer attention away from the environment, wherein lies litigation and accountability, and steer the public toward a \"genetic predisposition\" or similar arguments. 34 Researchers learned that the risk of Alzheimer's was 1.5 times higher when the aluminum concentration exceeded 0.11 mg/l than in areas where the concentration was 0.01 ma. There was no evidence of any relationship between any other form of dementia, including epilepsy, and the presence of aluminum in drinking water. The Lancet, Jan 14, 1989, pp.59-62, \"Geographical relation between AWleimer;~ disease and aluminum in drinking water.\" It is interesting that about 50% of British drinking water is also treated with iron, which is also suspected of being a co-factor in dementia. 35 Vogt, T., 'Water quality and health - a study of possible relationship between aluminum in drinking water and dementia\" Central Bureau of Statistics of Norway' 1986; Jorm A., et al., 'Differences in mortality from dementia in Australia: an analysis of death certificate data\". 36 ~ase, Y., 'Environmental controbution to the ALS process\" Neuromusculnr Diseases, New Yo*, Raven Press, 1984, p.335; Lindegard, B., \"Aluminum and Azheimer's disease\", Lancet, Feb 4, 1989, pp.267 and 268.; Yase, Y., 'Pathogenesis of ALS Lancet, Vol 2, 1972, pp292-296.

Large molecules of aluminum shift toward mineral salt species of lower molecular weight, and cross-link to form destructiev free radicals in protein complexes that become quite influential in biological processes. 38 Coriat, A., et al, \"Beware the cups that cheer\", Nafure, Vol321, 1986, p.570."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO revealed that long-term exposure to aluminum contributed to plaque deposits in the cerebral cortex and aluminum deposition in neurons.39 Aluminum in Infant Formula and Bovine Milk One wonders, after examining all the diierent areas covered in this book (vaccinations and encephalopathy, electromagnetics, etc) if orthodox science is really ignorant of the sensitivity of infants and children to environmental contamination, or know about it and they don't care because there is another agenda afoot. I am convinced of the latter. The same parallel follows with heavy metals and the physiology of young humans, who are more sensitive than adults. Any good physiologist or physician would be able to tell you that the permeability of the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is quite great, as protective mechanisms have not yet fully developed. It is this very fact that allows many of the substances in human mother's milk to systemically permeate the body of the infant. Unfortunately, the same lack of protection seriously impairs an infant who consumes infant formula, especially soy formulas, and bovine (cow) milk. Whether the pasteurization process (aluminum vats and piping) contributes to the amount of aluminum in milk, or it involves the feed the animal is eating, is unknown. A 1985 British report in Lancet documented an infant with a case of severe kidney failure where the absorption and retention of aluminum from a cow's milk-based formula resulted in clinical toxicity. By one month of age, the baby had a aluminum concentration in its brain in the neurotoxic range.40 In 1986, another British report detailed levels of aluminum in rnik formulas for infants.41 Other clinical papers followed. Research indicates that aluminum concentrations in most cow milk is 20 times greater than human breast milk (5-20 mcgli) and 100 times greater in soy-based Since aluminum is to some degree excreted by way of the action of the kidney, the undeveloped kidney in infants (especially premature infants43) guarantees greater systemic deposition of heavy metals.44 Deficiencies in zinc will also cause children to absorb more aluminum into their systems, because aluminum competes with zinc in 39 Ibid. 40 Aluminum deposition in an infants brain can cause a degree of mental retardation, learning disabilities and pave the way for early onset of Alzheimer's.

Along with aluminum foil, cookware' made of aluminum is a si@cant source of excess aluminum in the diet. Boiling water in aluminum containers, especially water containing acidic substances, causes aluminum to leach into the water and food. Water containingfluorides encourages the leaching process from aluminum cookware. Water containing lppm fluoride46, boiled for ten minutes in an aluminum pot, will increase the concentration of aluminum to 200 ppm. Prolonged boiling can increase the concentration to 600 Add acidic food (tomato sauce, for example) and it even goes higher. In addition, as we see in the chapter in fluorides, the presence of aluminum increases the negative effects of fluorides (which is why fluoride toothpaste comes in aluminum tubes). Since the scientific data has been around for some time on all these issues, it cannot be anything but intentional. Aluminum cookware has been around since the late 1920's. The Effect of Aluminum on the Human Brain In order to prove that all of this is intentional, we have to prove that it was known early enough that aluminum causes a problem. One would assume that indications of negative effect would preclude introduction of aluminum cookware. Not in the United States. If you examine Matnx III as a totality you will understand why. The fact of the matter is that German experiments done in 1897 , where aluminum was analyzed for pathological reaction in animals, showed that aluminum is a selective neurotoxin and a nerve cell poison of specific a;fJinity for the brain.48 Exposure of the central nervous system to aluminum salts produces aprogressive en~e~halo~thy.~~ 45 Settle et al., \"Effect of phytate: zinc molar ratio and isolated soy bean protein on zinc bioavailability\", Journal of Nutrition, Vol 1 1 1, 198 1, p.2223-2235. 46 The usual level of fluoride in public water supplies. 47 Tennakone et al., \"Aluminum leaching from cooking utensils\" Nature, Vol325, January 15-21, 1987. 48 Doellken, P. \"Ueber die wirkung des aluminum mit sonder beruecksichtigung der durch das aluminum verursachten lasionen im tentralnexvensystem~\" Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch Exper Path Pharmakol 4058-120, 1897. 49 Munoz-Garcia et al, \"An immunocytochemical comparison of cytoskeletal proteins in aluminum- induced and Alzheimer-type neurofibrillary tangles.\" Acta Neuropathology Vol70, 1986, p.243-248.

Someone or some group in high position, more than 70 years ago, intentionally planned to use the United States as a testing ground for all ofthis, ultimately resulting in a sociopathic society pleading for totalitarian control. They knew about the effect of mercury and vaccines in 1926. It's in the medical literature. All of this is not an accident.

Ten percent of the total population of native Guamanians die of brain disease. Fifteen percent of the natives in the Mariana Islands die of neurodegenerative disease. Why? Part of the answer is that there are high levels of aluminum in the drinking water. There are also high levels of aluminum in the food.50 The Neurological and Physiological Effect of Aluminum Deposition Aluminum is known to be a significant cross-linking agent that acts to imrnobilze reactive molecules within brain cells. It also causes fiee-radical pathology inside the neurons, bringing on molecular cross-linkage throughout the brain's tissues, resulting in neurofibrillary tangles so characteristic of those seen in autopsies of brains of those with Alzheimer's syndrome.51 The process is highly complex, and is outside the scope of our general examination. Research has been conducted to intentionally induce and replicate the sequence of symptoms of Alzheimers in animals. Using cats, and injecting 100 nanomoles (1 billionth of a mole) of aluminum chloride into the hippocampic space (brain ventricle) a dementia similar to Alzheimers developed.52 It takes very little aluminum to actually begin the process of degeneration. Progressive dementia also developed within ten days of a subcutaneous injection of aluminum chloride under the skin. Neurodegeneration is proportional to long-term accumulation and specific sites of ac~umulation.~~ Interestingly, concentrations of aluminum that are toxic to many biochemical processes are found in at leastm human neurologrcal conditions.54 Animals in these experiments typically develop symptoms within two weeks, including shaking (ataxia) and 'O Perl, D., et al., \"The association of aluminum, Alzheimer's disease, and neurofibrillary tangles\" Journal ofNeural Transmutation, Vol 24, 1987, pp.205-211; Dalton et al, \"'Aluminium and calcium in soil and food from Guam, Palau and Jamaica: implications for ALD and Parkinsonismdementia syndromes of Guam\", Brain, Vol 112, 1989, p. 45-53.

The rest is absorbed into the brains6 The absorption rate of aluminum in various tissues depends on the age of the individual. Generally, uptake of aluminum is greater the older a person becomes. Aluminum absorbed in food enters the blood and then breeches the blood-brain barrier, which is often effectively weakened by other environmental factors, such as mercury or petrochemical derivatives, and enters the brain. Very often, natural peptides present in the brain, such as beta endorphtn, actually combine with heavy metals and themselves become toxic5'.

The use of lead by human civilization approaches 4 million tons per year - a level exceeding ancient ambient levels by a factor of 500' . Lead is present in drinking water in homes that still have lead water pipe, estimated to be 20% of the home in the United States, and is present in many models of newly installed dripless faucets that are made of metal alloys which contain lead. Output of lead compounds fiom exhaust are heavier than air and eventually settle to the ground. Before they settle, they present a hazard to humans through breathing. Much of the lead in the blood of humans comes fiom the lead solder in food containers2, lead-based paints, lead water pipes and the manufacturing of consumer products3 by companies who lack stringent emission controls that eliminate heavy metals. Lead from industry and transportation that settles to the ground, especially in or near cities, can raise soil lead levels to very high levels, contaminating food grown in such soil.4 It is estimated that petroleum industry injected over 200 million pounds of lead per year into the atmosphere every year prior to 1972, when the use of leaded he1 was discouraged. Industry added another 3 billion pounds per year to the human environment. The Physiological Effect of Lead in the Human Brain and Body Obviously, no amount of lead is appropriate in the human body. Any level above 10 micrograms per 100 milliliters of blood is dangerous5. A condition known as \"lead poisoning\", where the effects become really obvious, occurs at a level of 60 micrograms per 100 ml. The most ~rofound effect of lead is _found in the brain. Once lead levels exceed 25 micrograms, a child may weer chronic memory loss and be deprived of motor coordination.

Most of the 28 states who do test for lead do not supply enough data for researchers to arrive at a total picture of the extent of the problem of lead contamination in the population of the United States. New studies show that even 10 micrograms of lead can lower a child's IQ several points, resulting in semi- retardation, or adults that have retarded thouaht cqvaci@ When lead enters the body and combines with tissue fluids, it forms a soluble disphosphate compound, since lead combines with phosphorus molecules in much the same way that calcium does. Lead diphosphate follows calcium metabolic pathways and precipitates in the bones as tertiary lead phosphate after molecular lead enters the bloodstream. Lead, like fluorides and AZT, is a protoplasmic poison with an afJinity for the gray matter of the brain, invading the neurons, damaging synapses and dendrites, and seriously reducing the number of red blood cells in the hoe. Curiously, adult human bodies absorb only about 10% of the metal to which they are exposed, while childien absorb more than 50%. Those under seven years of age are most at risk because the nervous systems and organs are still developing. Analogies With Other Toxicological Paradigms The sensitivity of the nervous system of the infant and child is also pointed out in the chapter that relates vaccination practices and resulting encephalopathy due to the immaturity of the myelin sheath.

Lead Pathways and the Importance of a Balanced Diet After absorption, much of the lead shows up in the spleen, liver and kidneys. After a few days of metabolization, the lead moves to the bones and remains there unless the individual eats a diet low in phosphates. Phosphate deficiency is a main factor in the Alzheimer's Syndrome is primarily caused by heavy metal poisoning, including aluminum, lead, cadmium and iron. 276"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO development of lead poisoning, since it forces the lead to combine with phosphates already in the body. So, poor nutrition leads to increased pathology with respect to lead. A diet deficient in phosphorus will liberate toxic lead from the bones, causing it to permeate the lymphatic system and blood stream and poison other tissues, often resulting in anemia. A diet high in calcium without a corresponding elevation of nutritional phosphates will also cause lead to migrate from the bones. Once lead has left the bones and enters the blood, it easily passes the blood-brain barrier and enters the brain. Provided there is sufficient phosphorus in the diet, Vitamin A assists the retaining of accumulated lead in the bones. A deficiency in calcium intensifies the toxicity of lead. Another reason to eat a balanced diet. Physiological Signs of Lead Toxicity The initial symptoms of lead toxicity are fatigue, irritability, abdominal pain, constipation and lack of hunger. The neurotoxic effect of lead exposure in-utero, through breast feeding, and during childhood causes developmental problems and neurological deficit. It reduces nerve cell development in the cerebral cortex, and has been specifically shown to reduce nerve cell size in the optic nerve. Lead toxicity also delays growth, impairs motor skill development, and alters the level and utilization in the brain of dopamine, norepinehrine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid, which inhibits nerve cells from overfiring. Lead toxicity has also been linked as a contributor to SIDS. In 1943, one study showed that children exposed to lead made unsatifactory progress in school due to sensorimotor deficits, short attention span, and behavioral disorders. Even relatively how levels will cause a reduced IQ. Children with the highest lead levels had the greatest risk of dropping out of school. Sociological result of lead in society: decreased mental capacity and increase in sociological behavioral problems and violence. Lead toxicity can also be a causative factor in developing osteoporosis in women. Progressive lead poisoning can develop successively as pain in the bones, gout, high blood pressure, iron-deficiency anemia, neurological problems, and numbness or tingling in the extremities. In young children progressively exposed to lead, there will be a decrease in play activity and an increase in irritability that may be falsely interpreted as a \"behavior disturbance\" requiring drugs or psychological intervention.' Exposure to lead produces clear-cut progressive and chronic encephalopathy (mental deteriorization due to brain damage) in children, which is most noticible in children over the age of three. Upon examination, these children appear to be hyperactive and often manifest aggressive behavior disorders. All of this is prone (as the footnote below delineates) to allopathic misdiagnosis, often with application of neurologically damaging drugs or psychologically damaging therapy. Stupid is as stupid does. 7 Interestingly, the same parallels occur with synthetic food additives and colorings, which can result in diminished intellectual capacity, as well as hyperactivity, psychologically misdiagnosed as 'httention deficit hyperactivity disorder\", resulting in the misapplication of drugs or psychotherapy - all the while, the problem was in the food or the environment.

With acute adult lead encephalopathy, there is progressive irreversible damage to the kidneys, often appearing many years after toxic exposure - this fact gave rise to the term \"late nephropathy\" (kidney damage). Treatment for Lead or Other Heavy Metal Toxicity The most effective treatment for heavy metal toxicity is EDTA chelation therapy. It is recognized even in allopathic medicine as being the most effective'solution. Chelation therapy, unfortunately, is expensive and time-consuming. The end result is detoxification, so the choice remains clear. During one clinical study with succimer * chelation therapy, 15 children with lead poisoning achieved a 78% decrease in blood lead levels. EDTA produces a slightly lesser decrease in blood levels and requires a higher amount of infusion. There are many kinds of chelating agents and many variations. Check with a professional chelation therapist for the best method to suit you. I personally know one such professional. Oddly, no children who know him are into heavy metal music. Curious but true.

Introduction of Leaded Fuels, Unleaded Fuels and Catalytic Converters: Production of Neurotoxic Compounds In a series of articles in Nexus during 1995, there was an extensive discussion about apparent chicanery involving the petroleum industry with regard to both the use of leaded gasoline and its subsequent replacement with unleaded gasoline and the use of catalytic converter^.^ When internal combustion engines were first developed, they ran on a highly refined product known as \"motor spirit.\" By today's standards, it was a clean fbel that produced few hdl by-products. The engines of yesterday ran at very low compression ratios because of the highly refined fuel. As consumers were entrained to desire engines with more compression and paver (not supprising in a culture where ego fbnctions of security, sensation and paver are inculcated), the petroleum companies decided to increase profits by spending less refining the product. This combination of more * Succimer is a relatively new lead-removal drug. FDA reports that clinical experience is limited to about 300 cases.

Rather than return to the production of engines with lower compression ratios or more refined fuel, companies decided to add tetraethyl lead in order to combat the \"ping\" problem. Petroleum companies have gone out of their way to claim that the lead levels in human blood have paralleled the use of tetraethyl lead.'' The Phase-in of \"Unleaded Fuel\" In addition, the cost of oil low in sulfur and nitrates that was easy to process began to skyrocket. Companies decided to pursue oil high in nitrates and sulfur, refining it using the same old processes, and this lead to higher atmospheric levels of surphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide - smog. Instead of using refining processes to remove the contamination in the fuel, companies decided to opt for the catalytic converter. In order to use the converter, though, cars must bum unleaded he1 as to not render the converter, containing -q useless. Unleaded fuel, in order to combat the \"pinging\" problem that was the cause for the original addition of tetraethyl lead (which created significant airborn lead contamination in the environment), needed to contain other substances to combat the \"ping\". For this reason, unleaded gasoline contains MmE (methyl-tert-butyl ether), an anti-knock substance to replace tetraethyl lead. MBTE is dubbed an oxygenate, and it has been especially used in the winter months. Other substances added to gasoline are aromatics: benzene, toluene, xylene, dimethylbenzene and mesitylene. All of these so- called \"ring compounds\" are extremely carcinogenic and make up about 40% of the fuel composition. Furthermore, substances called olefnes are added - organic double-bond compounds - which when burned yield toxic compounds, one of which is 1,3-butadiene. The EPA has targeted both benzene and 1,3-butadiene as two of the top five air pollutants. The Production of Nerve Gases from the Catalytic Converter Now, engine oil contains a substance known as U)TP (zinc dithiophosphate) in order to increase the longevity of engine oil. Now comes the problem. When M7BE and WP interact, phorsphoric ester and similar compoun& are created which fit into the same group of chemicals as Sarin, Tabun and E-605 - nerve gases. Since chlorine compounds are also used as additives in both gasoline and engine oil, when these compou& are passed over platinum in the catalytic converter, phosaene gas begins to come out the exhaust. Phosgene ( COC14) was a poison gas used in World War I. According to Dr. Hans Neiper, who consulted a qualified fill professor at the Medical School ar Hannover, Germany, besides phosphoric esters and phosphines, the MTBE-ZDTP reaction could generate enols, which block vital human enzymes. Diesel fbels do not contain MTBE. lo Although the use of tetraethyl lead has contributed to the overall load of lead in the blood, the most significant loading of the blood has been due to lead content in foods (from the solder in cans, only recently scaled back in 1991) and in water supplies. 279"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Chemical Toxins Table - Metals Metallic Substance 1 Common I Toxicological Sources Aluminum Cadmium Cans, foil, antacids, pots and pans, baking powder, some cheeses, deodorants, utensils, plant foods, tap water, gardening additives, bufferd aspirin, bleached white flour, refined junk foods Batteries, cigarette smoke, coffee, gasoline, metal pipes, plastics, refined foods, solders, steel, water contaminant Chlorine Water disinfectant.

As mentioned in the first volume, fluoride is in your toothpaste and in the water not because it is beneficial, but because someone decided that you should be medicated. In the first volume ofMatrzx III, we saw that the same people in the United States who backed Germany's rise to power (and saw their use of fluoride to behaviorally modzb certain groups of people) are using fluoride in the United States and other countries for the same purpose - to offset the questioning of authority and to create long-term medical problems for financial gain of the medical and pharmaceutical indusrstry. Many chemicals are added to the water supply \"to counteract pollutants\" (and some of these cause more harm to human physiology than good), but fluoride is an exception - it is put there intentionally to behaviorally rnodzb the population. Let's examine the nature of fluoride in a little more detail. More on the Nature of Fluorides One of several compounds is used to add fluoride ions to the public water supply. Sodium fluoride, the most fiequently used, is one of the most lethal forms of what are called halogen salts. In some cities, the fluoride is added in the form of sodium silicofluoride. Another form of fluoride, calcium fluoride, is also used. Whatever the compound used, the purpose is add fiee fluorine ions \"to act on the enamel of the teeth of children below the age of 12, in an attempt to harden it against the invasion of decay.\" As mentioned in volume one, this philosophy is based on erroneous information, and we will go into the background of this erroneous information in a little more detail in a little while. Sodium fluoride is a compound that has many industrial uses. Merck's Index, the standard reference book of the pharmaceutical profession, lists the industrial uses of fluoride compounds as \"an insecticide, particularly for roaches and ants.\" Under the heading \"Human Toxicity\", the Index says \"Severe symptoms result fiom ingestion of 0.25 to 0.45 grams, and death results fiom ingestion of 4 grams. Sub-lethal symptoms are nausea and vomiting, abdominal distress, diarrhea, stupor and weakness. Lethal symptoms consist of muscular weakness, tremors, convulsions, collapse, dyspnea, respiratory and cardiac failure and death. Chronic symptoms are mottling1 of tooth enamel and osteosclerosis.\" 1 Mottling characterizes chronic fluoride poisoning ofthe teeth 282"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Dental Fluorosis An article in the Journal of the American ~ental ~ssociation~ revealed that Grand Rapids, Michigan, whose water supplies were fluoridated in 1945, showed 23% tooth mottling among children as the result of fluoridation.

Since mottling is permanent disfigurement, and there is an unending accretion of new cases in all fluoridated water areas, it is only with time that we can witness the full tale of this afflicti~n.\"~ Fluorides as a Toxic Protoplasmic Poison Fluoride has been described by Dr. Charles A. Brusch, former director of the Massachusetts Medical Center in Cambridge, as a \"hi&& toxic proto~lasmic pison that is 15 times stronger than arsenic.\" The US. Dispensary, 24th edition (used by pharmacists) states further that 'Ifluorides are violent poisons to all livin~ tissue because of their precipitation of calcium. They cause a fall in blood pressure, respiratory failure and general paralysis. Continuous ingestion of nonfatal doses (as in the water supply and fluoride in toothpaste) causes permanent inhibition of growth.\" Calcium metabolism is also affected by fluorine. Since bone picks up 30 percent less calcium in the presence of fluorine, it produces an increasing level of osteoporosis. We will examine more about fluoride and the bones later. Fluoride is an insidious poison, toxic and cumulative in its effects, even when ingested in minimal amounts, and that fact remains unchanged no matter how many times it is repeated in print that the fluoridation of the water supply is safe. Why has the American Dental Association and the U.S. Public Health Service suppressed this information? I think you know the answer to that question by reading the previous volume of Matrix 111, but let's take a closer look at the history of the idea of fluoridation of the water supply. The Beginning of the Fluoridation Movement For many years, the dental condition known as \"mottled teeth\" has been recognized in both human beings and in domestic animals in many parts of the American Southwest. In 1930, it was discovered that natural fluorine in the water was the cause. From 1930 to 1940, public health researchers and industrial engineers sought to devise methods for the removal offluorine or mitigation of its toxic eflectsflom domestic water supplies. Odd that the U.S. \"Public Health\" Service would later campaign for its dition to the water supply, isn't it? The explanation for that, as mentioned in volume one, was that a gentleman named Oscar Ewing ( a lawyer for Alcoa Aluminum, who was seeking ways to get rid of toxic fluorine by-products fiom the manufacture of aluminum) was appointed director of the US Public Heath Service. A way was found to dump the toxic fluorides into the water supply by taking advantage of misinformation resulting fiom an Journal of the American Dental Association, Vol. 68, 1962.

Shortly before World War I, Hereford, Texas was heralded as the \"town without a toothache\" because of the excellent condition of the teeth of the children. An assumption was made that the natural fluorine in the water was responsible for this, despite the fact that the teeth of many of the children were mottled in appearance. The possible effects of the superior mineral content of the foods in the area and the fact that the region produced a lot of citrus hit high in vitamin C was ignored there were even studies done by MIT that proved that animals fed the food from the area developed only half as much tooth decay as those fed food fiom New England. The MIT study also found that riboflavin, a non-toxic B vitamin, was effective in preventing dental decay. The precipitous conclusion regarding the relation of fluorine to dental health quickly led to agitation (headed by Oscar Ewing and the Aluminum Trust) for mass application of arhficial sodium fluoride to domestic water supplies in an effort to duplicate the supposedly \"favorable effect\" of the fluorine found in natural waters. The result was that millions of people are compelled to partake of toxic fluorine. While the strong afltinty of fluorine for calcium results in deposition in dental tissues and increased hardness (brittleness), it is conducive to periodontal disease, including grngrvitis andpyomhea. This is precisely why the American Dental Association promotes the use of fluoride - it helps to increase the profit margin of dentists. Remember that fluoride is a protoplasmic poison? There was a study by Dr. H.K. Box, a periodontist of international reputation at the University of Toronto, who checked the status of a number of people who had been using naturally fluoridated water for several decades and found appalling periodontal (gum) disease, with marked morphological changes, such as enlargement of the roots and narrowing or closure of root canals and pulp chambers, indicating premature agrng of the tooth structure, making extraction very dif£icult. Many of these cases had severe gum disease and premature need of dentures. Natural vs. Artificially Fluoridated Water The proponents of water fluoridation claim that water to which industrial fluorides are added at one part per million (lppm) has the same effect as water in which fluorine is naturally present. They also maintain that a fluorine ion is a fluorine ion no matter where it comes from. All that is simply not the case at all. Leading water toxicologists and biochemists do not question the identity of the fluoride ion, but maintain that in naturally fluoridated water (calcium fluoride) there are other minerals which unite with it and affect its absorption and toxicity. The naturally occurring calcium-fluoridated water has been proven to be 85 times less toxic that sodium-fluoridated water. For obvious reasons, the effect on dental decay of other minerals in water has been denied by the proponents of using industrial fluorine compounds in drinking water.

In a 1957 AMA report is was stated \" It is too early to know what the effects of artificial fluoridation will be. What is reported as a reduction in dental decay may in fact be a delay in recognition of decay, and reasons given for believing that artz$ciaIly fluoridared water will have the same eflects as water with naturalfluoride are not valid \" The claim that fluoridation is one of \"nature experiments\" is not valid, because the salts put into the water supply, sodium fluoride or silicofluoride, are industrial products never found in natural water or in organisms. They are notoriously toxic to the degree that they are used to poison rats and insects . .. and humans. The Claim of Fluorine as a \"Nutrient\" One of the other tenets that the proponents of the use of industrial fluorine in the public water supply use is the assertion that \"good teeth require fluorine supplements in the diet\". This rather bizarre thought pattern is in fact denied by a number of scientists who have conducted research on this very subject. An article by Drs.Mauer and Day in the August 1957 Journal of Nutrition, reported that animals in their laboratory in a highly purified fluorine-pee diet showed no signs of a fluorine deficiency, much less any tooth decay. Decay-free teeth have been observed in areas where there is no fluorine in the water. On the other hand, the 1957 records for New Britain, Connecticut (where the use of industrial fluorides had been in use for 6 years) showed that some of the children's teeth had been damaged beyond repair where the water is fluoridated, even when the percentage of industrial fluorine is kept at or below 1 ppm, mottling is produced in 10-15% of the children examined. Mottled teeth are teeth showing symptoms of fluorosis, and the enamel of mottled teeth is brittle and subject to mechanical injury which is difficult or impossible to repair. Fluorine is classified as a trace mineral by nutritionists. Very small traces are deemed desirable, for some reason, in the diet. There is no such thing, however, as a \"fluorine deficiency symptom.\" Even in communities where the water is completely free of calcium fluoride (natural fluoride), residents get enough fluorine in their diet. An analysis of some common foods indicates the following average calcium fluoride content (keeping in mind that some areas medicate the drinking water with 1 pprn fluoride already): Food Parts Per Million Beef Beets Butter Cheese Corn Mackerel Peanuts Wheat Yams 2.0 pprn 1 7.7 pprn 1 SO pprn 1.62 pprn 2.10 pprn 26.0 pprn 1.36 pprn 7.2 pprn 8.2 pprn"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO In an article in the Belgian Dental Journal for March-April 1960, Dr. L.N. Peacock said \"Ninety percent of the enamel in human teeth consists of calcium phosphate with a trace of calcium fluoride, 4.5 percent of calcium carbonate and 1.5 percent of magnesium phosphate. It is obvious that the double salt of calcium phosphate and calcium fluoride is the most important part of the tooth structure. The calcium and phosphorus atoms are well supplied to children by intake of milk products and the magnesium atoms by the intake of vegatable and fiuits. Owing to the present-day refining and processing of foods, it cannot be expected that there will be an adequate atomic packing of tooth structures, resulting in structures which are easily broken down by contact with refined sugars, which are the main cause of dental decay. The author has no faith in adding inorganic fluorides to the drinking water as a decay-preventing measure, but relies on a supply of fluorine from the complex organic molecules obtained from vegatables and fish.\" In fact, the most important cause of dental decay is a deficient diet, not a deficiency in fluorine. Serious consideration should be given to the results of experiments conducted by Dr. A. Aslander in Stockholm in 1958 (Tooth Formation in the Light of Plant Nutrition) that indicates that food supplementation with bone meal has a most profound decay protective effect in children. Bone meal is a wholesome food there is evidence that fluorine is not an absolutely essential nutrient. One of the more interesting theories regarding the reason that some people are fiee of cavities is that the saliva itself may contain an antibacterial substance the research comes as a result of the work of Dr. Gordon E. Green of the Henry Ford Hospital that was presented at the ADA meeting in November 1962. According to Dr. Green, one percent of the US population is cavity fiee because of the nature of their saliva. \"But a Small Amount of Fluoride Can't Hurt You ...\" Claims made by the food industry that additives cannot harm humans or have any cumulative effects is also pmoted by proponents of using toxic fluoride compounds in the public water supply and toothpaste. For the food industry, according to the FDA, calculations of the amount of additive chemicals which may be added to food are based on the amount which is toxic \"to the average person\". After the toxic amount is determined, it is divided by 100 to determine the amount \"which will be safe for almost everybody\". It is unfortunate that this procedure, which uses aberrant logic, is not applied to the addition of toxic fluoride to substances human consume directly. Like some food additives, the fluorides fiom artificially fluoridated drinking water build up in the body. Dr. Jonathan Forman, formerly a professor at Ohio State University and former editor of the Ohio State Medical Journal, explained this to the Medical-Dental Committee on Evaluation of Fluoridation. In the transcript of the meeting, Dr. Forman is quoted as saying \"It is now known that such vital organs as the kidneys, thyroid, the aorta, 4 The issue is not just one of \"concentration\" - it is the substance itself. Viewed from another scientifically valid perspective, fluorine has a certain \"frequency\" as a substance which is incompatible with biological organisms."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO liver and lungs, as well as other organs, can be the sites of unusually high fluoride build- up. No matter how small the amount of fluoride in the diet, a part of it tends to accumulate in the body. When the water supply is fluoridated, the intake of the individual is considerably increased and the accumulation in the body increases accordingly. There is no clear-cut pattern as to the degree of retention among individuals. Further, it accumulates in certain organs in an unpredictable way. Some individuals may store up to 100 times more fluoride in certain tissues than others. This has given rise to concern over fluoride's vossible role in chronic disease. Fluoride is an enzyme poison and medical authorities recognize that disturbances of the enzyme system are a cause of disease.\" In addition, it might be mentioned that fluoride in some drugs - calcium preparations, steroids, tranquilizers, vitamins and in certain babv foods exceeds by itself what is called \"the safe daily dose\". In fact, fluorides are used in biological laboratories to block the action of enzymes, and can be used in this manner because it can interfere with so many diierent enzymes. Fluorides switch off enzymes by attacking its weakest links - the delicately balanced hydrogen bonds surrounding the active site.' Fluorine Pollution in the Environment In urban areas, we regularly inhale almost 20% of the so-called \"safe dose\" on a daily basis. Dr. F.B. Exner of Seattle once published a heavily documented report, Economic Motives Behind Fluoridation, in which he lists innumerable industrial uses of fluorides which result influoride air pollution. Superphosphate fertilizer is one of them, with chronic fluorine poisoning in the region of manufacturing plants commonplace. Insect svravs may contain up to 7ppm of fluorine, and these are used on fiuits and vegatables destined for human consumption. Although \"fluoridationists\" claim there is only 0.3 milligrams per day of fluorine in the average total diet, Dr. Exner quotes a Department of Agriculture (another criminally negligent agency) toxicologist, Dr. Floyd DeEds, as claiming that the daily intake of fluorine fiom baking powder alone might amount to more than 2.5 milligrams. Although aluminum is the chief culprit, the manufacture of practically all metal seems to produce fluorine wastes which are dumped into rivers as the easiest way to get rid of them. Wherever there is a factory creating pollution, people, animals and vegetation suffer for it. Crops coming fiom such regions assay as containing many times the 1 to 1.5 ppm that government authorities have stated as the \"acceptable tolerance for fluorine\". According to Dr. Exners report, there is a possibility that a large portion of the American population is already ingesting far too much fluorine in its daily diet, without any addition to its water supply.

Fluorides are highly toxic, quite aside from the tendency to cause or promote cancer. A few grams will kill you.\" In Great Britain, Dr. R.A.Holman of the Royal Institute of Pathology discussed fluoride poisoning in an article in the April 15, 1961 issue of the British Medical Journal. He noted that the long-term efJects of sodium fluoride ingestion needed much more investigation, and continued, \"Fluoride is a well-known inhibitor of several enzyme systems, and can form spectroscopically recognizable compounds with the enzyme catalase, resulting in its inhibition. Catalase poisoning has been linked with the develo~ment of viruses and the causation of a number of diseases, includina cancer. Many observers have suggested that the agents (fluorides and other toxic environmental substances) which decrease the catalase the cells may predispose those cells to tumor formation. Voisin has said, \"the method most likely to solve the problem of cancer is to ask why the cancer cell is lacking in catalase and try to prevent its impoverishment from taking place. Did the American Cancer Society ever ask that? No. They are too busy scamming billions of dollars from under the nose of a dying public who doesn't know anything. Now you do. A class action suit against the ACS for criminal negligence would be interesting to watch. Dr. Holmans article was questioned a short time after publication in a letter published in the same journal by Dr. A.J. Dalzell-Ward, of the British Central Council for Health Education. Dr. Dalzell-Ward's objections were based on the fact that workers inhaling large amounts of fluorides in cryolite dust exhibited bone and gastric symptoms, but no \"microscopically recognizable organic lesions apart from the bone changes\". Also, he noted that in the aluminum industry there were no figures (no studies were done) to link fluorides with cancer, even though the workers were proven to excrete more than 9 milligrams ofjluorine daily. It is a comment typical of what you hear by those who have a lot to loose if the truth comes out - that \"there are no figures.. .\" or \"there are no studies\". Do you seriously think that they would undertake such studies? Of course not. What Dr. Dalzell-Ward did not mention was the paradoxical effect noted by Schatz and Martin, in which calcium andfluorides sometimes interact to bring about opposite enzyme stimuli. According to their conclusions, \"more work should be done on this matter before fluorides are dismissed as a cause for cancer.\" Current scientific research seems to indicate that fluorides contribute to the deteriorization of the body, and that this serves to promote disease.

Mutagenic substances also tend to be cancer- causing (carcinogenic). Research on Fluoride-Induced Human Cancer As early as 1984, researchers in Japan were achieving some degree of understanding about fluorides consumption and human cancer. Dr. Takeki Tsutsui of the Nippon Dental College showed in 1984 that 'ffluoride caused not only genetic hage but was also capable of transforming normal human cells into cancer cells.\" In Dr. Tsutsui 's sfutj, the level of fluoride used was the same level that the United States National Cancer Institute suggested should be used in a study to determine whether fluoridation of public water supplies causes cancer. The level offluoride deemed \"safe\" by the United States in I ppm. The researchers in Japan found that cells treated with fluoride produced cancer. * The work in Japan was confirmed four years later in 1988 by researchers at the Argonne National Laboratory, who also discovered that fluoride promotes and enhances the carcinogenicity of other cancer-causing chemicals in the food and environment. Interestingly, this work confirmed studies sponsored by the United States National Cancer Institute conducted back in 1963 by Herskowitz and Norton at Saint Louis universityg.

The study compared the cancer death rate of the ten largest fluoridated cities (Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland, Washington, Milwaukee, St.Louis, San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Buffalo) with the cancer rate of the ten largest non-fluoridated cities (Los Angeles, Boston, New Orleans, Seattle, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Kansas City, Columbus, Newark and Portland) that had comparable cancer death rates from 1940 to 1950, a period of time during which neither group of cities had fluoridated water supplies. During the period fiom 1940 to 1950, the cancer rates of both groups rose identically. From 1952 to 1956, the cities on the \"fluoridation list\" began to fluoridate their water supplies. As the process of water fluoridation continued, the cancer death rate of the fluoridated cities began to far exceed the rate of the unfluoridated cities13 . By 1969, the fluoridated cities had an average cancer death rate of 225 per 100,000 people, while non-fluoridated cities had an average cancer death rate of 195 per 100,000. me &a indicates a fluoride-linked increase of cancer of 10% in only 13-1 7 years. These figures were checked and confirmed in 1979 by the United States National Cancer Institute. The increase in cancer death observed in fluoridated cities occurred primarily in people ages 45 and over; this fact is explainable because both the immune system and the normal DNA repair process (the two major defense ystems against cancer) decline with age.. In 1977, Congressional Hearings were held in which Dr. Yiamouyiannis and Dr.. Burk were able to show that the increase in deaths were due to water fl~oridation'~ . At the conclusion of the hearings, Representative Fountain and his committee instructed the United States Public Health Service (well known by now for questionable and dangerous medical advisory practices which benefit the medical and pharmaceutical industries) to conduct animal studies to \"determine whether or ~ot fluoride causes cancer\". As a result, the USPHS retained Battelle Memorial Institute (also well known for NWO technical activities and is considered by many to be part of the cancer cover-up) to perform a study on mice and rats - unfortunately rodent physioloay ai#ers considerably porn humans, making the transfer of data between species reltitively meaningless. Results of the Battelle Study on Cancer and Fluorides: Liver and Oral Cancer Despite the study by Battelle, which the USPHS thought would vindicate fluoride, interesting data about mice, rats and fluoride materialized. On February 23, 1989, Battelle released the results of the mouse study. The most curious result of the study, fiom the USPHS point of view, was that fluoride ihced the occurrence of an extremely rare l3 bid. l4 Burk, D., et al, \"Fluoridation and Cancer: Age Dependence of Cancer Mortality Related to Artificial Fluoridation\", Fluoride, Vol 10, N0.3, p102, (1977)."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO form of liver cancer, called hepatocholangio carcinoma, in fluoride-treated male and female mice15. Two months later in April of 1989, Battelle released the results of its study of fluorides and rats. The study showed a dose-dependent relationship between the incidence of oral cancerous tumors andfluorides. It is interesting to note that mice and rats yielded different results with fluoride - different types of cancer. As a response to the Battelle study, the National Cancer Institute fiom examined the incidence of oral cancer in fluoridated and non-fluoridated countries over the period from 1973 to 1987. Re National Cancer Institute stu* found that as exposure to fluoriktion increases, so does the incidence of oral cancer; sometimes as much as a 50% increase in oral cancer rates occur in fluoridated areas - this translates to 8,000 new cases of oral and pharyngeal cancer per year, needless pain and mflering and a financial windfll to the medical and pharmaceutical factions that concern themselves with treatment. If fluorides contribute to oral cancer, then why is it in toothpaste? In 1989 Dr.Yiamouyiannis used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain carcinogenicity studies conducted by Proctor and Gamble (one of the makers of fluoridated toothpaste) that were submitted to (and covered up by) the United States Public Health Service. Subsequent studies showed dose dependent cell abnormalities caused by fluoride16 . These results were reported in the February 22, 1990 issue of the Medical Tribune. Additional studzes by Proctor and Gamble scientists confinned the link between oral precancerous growth andfluoride, as well as an increase in osteomas (bone tumors) and osteosarcomas (bone cancer). In fact, the National Cancer Institute found in 1991 that the incidence of bone cancer was 50% higher in men ages 0-19 years of age exposed to fluoridated water compared to those who were not. The continued use of fluorides in toothpaste is clearly somewhere between criminal neghgence and genocide --- but the profits are immense and profits make strange bedfellows. It is estimated that over 10,000 people die each year due to fluoridation of public drinking water and fiom 30,000 to 50,000 deaths fiom various causes attributable to fluoridation ( which includes the 10,000 to 20,000 deaths attributable to fluoride-induced cancer each year)17 . Because fluoride disrupts the DNA repair entyme activity, causes genetic damage, causes cancer and damages the immune system, it can be seen that in truth fluoridation is being promoted to deliberately accelerate the aging process in the population and contribute to the welfare of the medical andpharmaceutical industries. lS Toft, J.,\"Sodium Fluoride: Individual Animal Tumor Pathology\", Battelle Memorial Institute, 1989. 16 USPHS, \"Dose determination and carcinogenicity studies of sodium fluoride in mice and rats7', Review of Fluoride, Benejits and Risks, 199 1.

The U.S. Public Health Service covered up many of the results of the studj and announced that 'ffluoride might cause bone cancer, \" and assigned former FDA Commissioner Frank Young to \"reevaluate\" fluoride. 7hey then declared to the public that 'ffluoride does not cause cancer. \" The USPHS ironically had data from the National Cancer Institute, as well as toothpaste maker Proctor and Gamble, that indicated fluoride causes bone cancer, but also chose to cover up these studies. It is a case of pure criminal negligence. The Proctor and Gamble study showed that as little as 0.5 ppm fluoride in water causes genetic damage1* , tumors andprecancerous Fluorides and Thyroid Problems A number of years ago, it was discovered that iodine deficiency contributed to a condition known as goiter. Because of the condition of the soil in the Midwestern United States, Europe and Switzerland, iodine was added to salt (check out Morton Iodized Salt in the grocery store) in an attempt to \"overcome this shortage\". In portions of the United States where fluorine is being added to the water, it may represent an additional threat to the stability of the thyroid gland. Dr. D.T. Gordonoff, professor of pharmacology in Bern, Switzerland, did some marvelous research which indicates that fluorides decrease the function of the thyroid gland by 30 to 4Opercent. The Effect of Fluoride Consumption on Bone Growth The fact that fluorides can cause brittleness and maYormatiori of bones in childien is not disputed, even by the apologists for fluoridation, but the pro-fluoridationists deny that fluoride has this effect at the standard prescribed dosage. Unfortunately for the proponents of fluoridation, bodily storage of fluorides taken in drinking water or food takes place principally in teeth and bones. Amounts stored in other parts of the body vary per unit of time depending on the individual. In a report on fluoridation to the Department of Biochemistry at the Nobel Institute of Physiology and Medicine in Stockholm, Nobel prize winner Hugo Theorell stated: \"even if the risks from the viewpoints of enzyme chemistry with water fluoridation up to lppm are not be exaggerated, the distance to toxic doses is so short that hesitation should be justiied ''O \"M.J.

It is no surprise that in an era of premeditated medical genocide and \"ethnic cleansing\", that the water in South Africa contains up to 13ppm of sodium fluoride, and that it is affecting growing childien dzflerently from the way it affects adults. The children are affected with pain in the legs, disturbances in bone growth and severely mottled teeth2'. Their bones become chalky, white and porous. For those in doubt, consult the March 1956 issue of the Journal of the American Dental Association where H.C. Hodge remarks, \"skeletal deposition of fluoride is a continuing process in which a considerable portion of the ingested fluoride, perhaps 25 to 50%, is deposited in the skeleton.\" When the long-continued ingestion of fluoride results in mottling of the teeth, it is only logical to assume the existence of remote ~ystemic effects. Such findings have been reported by Danish researchers among workers in cryolite mining who were inhaling fluorine in dust. Not only did these subjects exhibit dental defects (thickened roots and narrowed pulp chambers), but supercalcification was manifested in ostephyte (bony outgrowth) formations on bones, osteosclerosis, calcification of tendons and fixation of the thoracic wall. These same effects have been noted also in parts of Afiica and India where the natives have long been using naturally fluoridated water. Associated malnutrition seems to accentuate the effects. Another study was done in England in 1948 where bone defects in three groups of school boys were studied. Two groups were fiom districts where the water supply was practically free of fluorine. The third group was fiom the town of Launton, where the natural water supply contains lppm of fluorine (the same as the level deemed \"safe\" by the U.S. Public Health Service). X-ray examination revealed that 20 percent of the first two groups had mild non-specific spinal irregularities. In the third group, the one consuming lppmfluoride in their water, 64% were found to have spinal defects, and lesions were more severe. A study was done by Brand1 and Tappeiner where very small amounts of sodium fluoride were fed to young growing puppies for 21 months. Their bones were then examined microscopically. Deposited in the bones were crystals of calcium fluoride. The soluble fluorine salts combine with the calcium of the bones, causing increased brittleness. The bones of the fluorine-fed animals were chalky, white and fiagile, as were the teeth.

The quantity of fluorine deposition was parallel with the progression of the calcification. They also proved that the deposit offlorine on teeth and bones starts through the placenta as early as the embryo period, and then takes place through the mothers milk through the infancy period, and through food, as well as directly through the inside of the oral cavity. As fluorine is a known active enzyme poison, it is known to affect cell division (mitotic) in the fetus, resulting in anatomical anomalies (teratism). Fluorides were used as an ergme inhibitor in a study by J.D. Ebert that was published in 1959 on the metabolic pathways by which organs in an embryo are formed. In low concentrations, he found that sodium -fluoride blocked almost completelv the regions destined to form muscle. primarilv affecting the heart muscle.

Could there be a connection between these facts and the rise in still births in cities withfluoriaiztion? In research conducted on the incidence of Mongolism in cities in Wisconsin, Illinois and the Dakotas published in 1959 in the official publication of the French Academy of Medicine, it was found that as the percentage offluorides in the water rose, there was a parallel rise in the incidence of Mongoloid births the age of the mothers giving birth to Mongoloid babies also declined with rising fluoride levels. It is interesting that. in the first three years of fluoridation, New Britain, Connecticut experienced a 150% rise in still births, while in nearby Waterbury (uduoridated), the stillbirth rate remained the same during the same time period. Acceleration of Strontium 90 Absorption Due to Physiological Presence of Fluoride Salts As early as 1959, the knowledge existed that the presence of fluoride in human bodies hastens the absorption of radioactive substances present in the environment. In a report to the Atomic Energy Commission's Division of Biology and Medicine entitled \"The Metabolism of Alkaline Earth Metals by Bone\" by F.W. Lengemann, professor of chemistry at the University of Tennessee on March 23, 1959, it was scientifically shown that the presence of fluorine and other environmental substances such as lead and cyanide in the human body increased the ratio of strontium 90 to calcium in bone. Keep in mind that the U.S. Government, during this time period and for years afterward, conducted numerous above ground nuclear tests. In addition, radioactive substances are routinely released into the atmosphere by nuclear power plants and other government facilities. What is the relevance of this?

A year earlier in 1958, another scientist arrived at an independent conclusion very similar to Lengemann, but this time relative to the growth of cancers within the body. In October 1958, Dr. J.F. Montague, a medical doctor, published material reflecting his growing concern over fluoridation in the Journal of the International College of Surgeons connecting the presence of fluorine in the human body to cancer. Also in 1958, an interesting piece of work was done by Dr. James Kerwin, a dentist, in which it was shown that the simultaneous presence of fluorine and strontium 90 in the human body may result in a greater accumulation of both substances in which compounds like strontium fluoride are formed. Because of the low solubility of these substances, the body has a very hard time getting rid of them. His report was published in Dental Digest in February 1958. Additional Data on the Effect of Fluorides on the Adult Human Body Two years after Kerwins' report in 1960, the American Dental Association issued a pamphlet for public consumption called Fluoridation Facts: Answers to Criticisms of Fluoridation. In defense of the use of toxic fluoride compounds in public water supplies (which is a grievous crime against humanity, since it means mandated involuntw public medication), they used the logic that \"people have been known to live to a ripe old age\" in areas where the water supply is fluoridated. Unfortunately, they neglected to mention that the addition offluoride to the water supply correlated directly with the number of still births. mongoloid children brittle teeth and enlar~ed dental root structures. adverse spinal conditions. osteomalacia (softening of the bones) and osteoporosis (abnorrnallv porous and spaced structure inside bone) in the medicated population as opposed to control populations that were unmedicated (see Matrix III, Vl).

One such example that applies to the subject under discussion is that of John R. Lilliendahl, D.D.S., who wrote a pamphlet in the 1960's entitled My Reasons for Opposing Fluoridation. In this pamphlet, which discusses the issue of safety and water fluoridation, Lilliendahl says: \"Failing to demonstrate safety for fluoridation are the mortality statistic comparisons in the 32 paired cities (paired meaning fluoridated vs. unfluoridated) discussed in Public Health Reports in May 1954. In the case of the 32 cities, 5 more deaths per 100,000 observed in fluoridated areas was deemed 'insigntficant'. In the Illinois survey, 98 more deaths per 100,000 seemed 'insignificant' to evaluators. These 'evaluations' were discussed in a report entitled Mortality in Fluoride and Non- Fluoride Areas subsequently published in Health and Statistical Bulletin 21 in 1952. Criticism eventually surfaced relative to this study in technical article in the Journal of the Maine Wder Utilities Assn. in March 1956 by B.C. Nesin, which stated that \"the erratic nature of these surveys is such that a death rate of 600 per 100,000 is deemed insignificant. We have noted that studies of naturally fluoridated areas prove nothing relative to artificially fluoridated places. Since mortality statistics rarely, if ever, list chronic fluorine intoxication as a disease entity, and since physicians generally know little of the syrnptomology of fluoride poisoning, the value of mortality statistics in proving anything about it seems slight.\" In other words, there is an assertion by Dr. Lilliendahl here that not only are there no figures to prove conclusively that fluoridation is unsafe, but also there are no figures which prove it is safe. Since the proponents of fluoridation are the ones asking for its use, the burden of proof should be on them, just as the burden of proof of the safety of a food additive is on the processor who proposes it. In Canada, there were observations of this nature as early as 1959. In that same year, the Ontario Minister of Health, Dr. Dymond, announced that no hrther fluoridation would be permitted there, because \"no one knows for sure what the effect is to persons given fluoride throughout a lifetime.\" In the Edinonton Jouml of the same year, Dyrnond was quoted as saying, \"when I prescribe treatment for my patients, I prescribe a stated amount. It is not possible to prescribe a stated amount by introducing it into the water supply.\" This is the case because of the technical dficulties involved in the water fluoridation process."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Technical Aspects to Water Fluoridation Why a \"standard dose\" is impossible to achieve Many authorities have pointed out the difficulties involved in \"ensuring equal doses of fluorides\" to all members of a community simply by adding the toxic chemical to water supplies. Some people drink more water than others. Some obtain more fluorine fiom food cooked in fluoridated water. Even if the population could be \"persuaded to take a daily dose of a stated amount of water, the dosages would vary in different parts of the population. Problems also arise with fluoridation equipment. A good example of this arose in the town of Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. In Red Deer, lppm was the intended dosage of fluoride. Because of faulty mechanical operation of the fluoridation equipment, the fluoride levels in the first three months of 1961 fluctuated between .32 and 2.30 ppm. In the United States, there was a problem in Morristown, New Jersey in the 1950's when fluoridation was first attempted. Fluoridation attempts were discontinued when it was found that despite efforts to obtain a fluoridation level of 1.2ppm, actual values taken at points in the city ranged from 0.0 to .41 pprn (fortunately for the population). Concord, New Hampshire discontinued fluoridation after it was found that the sludge in the water maintains a concentration of fluorides ranging from 1,693 pprn to 4,491 ppm. In DeKalb County, Georgia, where the intended level was .7 ppm, actual concentrations were found to fluctuate between .7 and 1.0 ppm. In 18 locations in West Virginia, fluoride concentrations were found to fluctuate between .2 and 1.6 ppm. Milwaukee's fluorine concentration, when examined, was found over a period of 4 years to vary fiom .25 to 1.5 ppm. The New York State Department of Health study on this problem found that this problem happens in every location where fluoride is added to public water supplies. In the report of the proceedings of the 3rd Medical-Dental Conference on the Evaluation of Fluoridation, held on March 7, 1959 in New York City, the committee concluded that \"It is apparent that the practice of fluoridation is not the simple is not the simple, trustworthy procedure that the promoting authorities have given the profession and the public to believe. Added to the lack of control of fluorides at the consumers tap are these major uncertainties: the gross variation in individual water consumption, the varied intake of fluorides in food and the fluoride intake fiom atmospheric and occupational exposure. These unpredictable issues make meaningless any talk about \"controlled individual fluorine intake.\" Most, if not all of this research has been buried by the authorities, who maintain glibly that \"fluoride compounds are safe in the water supply\". It is an absolute lie, a distortion of the truth and constitutes criminal negligence."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Fluoridation Status of some Large United States Cities in 1988 City New York City Los Angeles Chicago Houston Philadelphia Detroit San Diego Dallas San Antonio Phoenix Baltimore San Francisco [ndianapolis San Jose Memphis Washington, D.C. lacksonville Milwaukee Boston Zolumbus Yew Orleans 3eveland Denver 21 Pas0 Seattle Uashville 3klahoma City hsas City 'ort Worth St. Louis Population 7,263,000 3,259,000 3,O 10,000 1,729,000 1,643,000 1 ,O86,OOO l,Ol5,OOO 1,004,000 9 14,000 894,000 753,000 749,000 720,000 7 12,000 653,000 626,000 6 10,000 605,000 574,000 566,000 554,000 536,000 505,000 492,000 486,000 474,000 443,000 441,000 430,000 426,000 Fluoridation Status Artificial None Artiicial Artificial + Natural Artificial Artificial Discontinued 1954 Artificial None None Artificial Artificial Artficial None Artificial Artificial Natural Artificial Artificial Artificial Artiicial Artificial Artiicial Natural Artificial Artificial Artificial Artificial Artificial Artificial Sources: Bureau of the Census, National Institute of Dental Research"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Use of Sodium Fluoride for Population Behavior Control It is a matter of record that sodium fluoride has been used for behavior control of populations. In an 'Address in Reply to the Governor's Speech to Parliament\" 24 , Mr. Harley Rivers Dickinson, Liberal Party Member of the Victorian Parliament for South Barwon, Australia made a statement on the historical use of fluorides for behavior control. Mr. Dickinson reveals that, 'At the end of the Second World War, the United States Government sent Charles Elliot Perkins, a research worker in chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and pathology, to take charge of the vast Farben chemical plants in Germany. While there, he was told by German chemists of a scheme which had been worked out by them during the war and adopted by the Gennan General Staff. This scheme was to control the population in any given area through mass medication of dinking water. In this scheme, sodium fluoride occupied a prominent place. Repeated doses of ir@nitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individual's power to resist domination bv slow~v voisonina and narcotisina a certain area of the brain, and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to povem him. Both the Germans and the Russians added fluoride to the drrnkinp water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile.\" The book Fluoride - me Freedom Flight also makes reference to the work of Perkins. The author, Dr. Hans Moolenburgh of Haarlem, Holland, relates: \" The story I read gave one the cold shivers. It told of a chemical engineer, Mr. Perkins, who related how immediately after the Second World War, he was the one the Americans put into the well-known I.G. Farben Company in Germany. There, he discovered that I.G. Farben had developed plans during the war to fluoridate the occupied countries, because it had been found thatfluoridation caused slight damage to a specific part of the brain. This damage had a very particular ef/ect. It made it more d~fficult for the person aflected to defend his freedom. He became more docile towards authority. Scientists in the camps of both proponents and opponents of fluoride have always dismissed this story as mere poppycock, but it had a life of its own and reared its head again and again. It fed the suspicions of many people that 'there was more to fluoridation than meets the eye.' As far as I know, there is no one who has done any serious research into whether the fluoridated person is really more docile, easier to rule, more impressed with authority than the non-fluoridated one. There is, however, one peculiar thing. Every Dutch doctor has a medical reference book for 1984. One chapter is entitled 'Tranquillisers'. Looking at the heading 'Major Tranpillisers', there are 27 compounds listed Seven of them are afluoride compound One of those is called Semap, and it is one of the strongest anti-p~ychotic compounds we know. This means that 25% of the major tranpillisers are connected with fluoride.\" 24 Victorian Hansard, August 12, 1987; Nexus, AuglSep 1995. 300"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO It is interesting that Dr. George Estabrooks, an advisor to the United States Government on hypnotism and psychological behavior control, later became chairman of the Department of Psychology at Colgate University. Internationally, Colgate was and remains today the most ardent producer and advocate for fluoridated toothpaste. The use of chemicals by the government to modify behavior of select population groups is not new. During the first two World Wars, bromides were administered to service men to dim the libido in an attempt to inhibit forrays into local bordellos. Today, in Australia, the military fluoridates the drinking water of the soldiers, ostensibly to protect the teeth. However, since the mythical ability of fluorides 'to prevent tooth decay7' only exists for those under the age of 12, it is certain that the real purpose is less altruistic. In volume one of Matrix 111, we discussed the role of Alcoa Aluminum in the production of fluoride, the role of Alcoa lawyer Oscar Ewing, who eventually gained control of what was to become the United States Public Health Service, his promotion of fluoridation and the use of advertising and false propaganda in an attempt to sell water fluoridation to an unsuspecting public. Interestingly, it turns out that Alcoa transferred its sodium fluoride production technology to Germany in 1939 under the Alted Agreement, and Dow Chemical Company transmitted its experience and technology to Germany during the same period. So, we have the U.S. transmit tin_^ technologv to Germanv before the war that allows Germany to experiment on select elements of the European population and then after the war Nazi scientists and the results of experiments are brought back to the United States under Operation Paperclip.

Farben developed organophosphate nerve agents, Zyklon B cyanide-based extermination gas used on the Jews during the war, and many other interesting substances. I.G.

Farben had many interconnections with companies in the United States and Britain. Consult the illustrative chart in this book.

An annual meeting w&esday featured shouting matches between the company's managers and sev- eral protesters, who demanded that I.G.

I.G. Farben's war-related factories included a no- torious synthetic-rubber plant at Auschwitz where 30,000 people worked until they died or were deemed unfit for work and sent to the gas chambers. Asubsidiary produced the Zyklon-B cyanide tablets used to gas hundreds of thousands of concentra- tion camp inmates. In 1953, I.G. Farben's assets were divided among Hoechst, BASF, Bayer and other firms, and the company remains basically as a trust to settle claims and lawsuits from the Nazi era. I.G. Farben managers say the firm has paid its debt to the victims and that its first duty now is to crediton and stockholders. But survivor groups see the continued existence of I.G. Farben - 42 years af- ter it was stripped of its assets - as an insult. Many of the 350 shareholders at Wednesday's meeting shouted at fellow shareholder Eduard Bern- hard when he demanded the company's dissolu- tion. 'I won't allow it, you blockhead,\" said Ernst Krienke, head ofthe supervisory board. Six young leftists stood up and shouted, \"Down With Fascism!\" and were wrestled out of the hall as some shareholders yelled, 'Throw them out!\" Krienke pointed out that the company paid $8 million in 1957 to the U.S.-based Jewish Claims Conference, which compensated an estimated 10,000 Western European, Israeli and U.S. Jews. It didn't pay Eastern European Jews and non- Jewish victims, including thousands of Poles. Krienke said that was because there was no bilat- eral German treaty with the eastern states autho- rizing such payments. . About 8,000 claims have been filed, said Henry Mathews, a shareholder who, like Bernhard and others, bought a small amount of Farben stock to be able to voice objections at stockholders' meetings. Krienke said the company is only worth $21 mil- lion and has no cash for such payments. The Holocaust isn't our problem, it's all of Ger- many's problem,\" he said. We're just the company that everyone hangs it on.\" .The board decided instead to ask the government to compensate the survivors and count the pay- ments against some 58 square miles of land in East- em Germany that the company claims belongs to it. Gingold and Mathews were skeptical, saying the plan was vague, put the burden on taxpayen and would take too long. %'a nothing more than astalling tactic until the last survivor dies,\" Gingold said.

The scheme of mass control through water medication was seized upon by the Russian Communists because it fitted ideally into their plans to Communize the world. I say this in all earnestness and sincerity of a scientist who has spent nearly 20 years research into the chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and pathology of fluorides. Any person who drinks artificially fluoridated water for a period of one year or more will never again be the same person, mentally or physically.\" When Major General Racey Jordan was in charge of the massive lend-lease airlift operations from Great Falls, Montana to Russia, via Alaska, he queried the transshipment of considerable amounts of sodium fluoride. He was told fiankly that it was to put into the drinking water of the prisoner of war camps to take away their will to resist.25 It is also interesting that former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has a background in academic chemistry, initiated a program involving astronomical expenditures of UK revenue on a fluoridation campaign in Northern Ireland. The United States as the Most Medicated Nation on Earth According to Chemical Engineering News in 1988, each year in the United States 80,000 tons of hydrofluosilicic acid, 60,000 tons of sodium silicofluoride and 3,000 tons of sodium fluorides are put into public water suppliesz6 . In view of all known research, it would be safe and accurate to rephrase the previous sentence and say that each year the United States Government allows' 143,000 tons of fluoride products to be added to public water supplies in order to numb, disempower, and render docile a large percentage of the population. Present estimates in 1995 run about 200,000 tons annually. Now, why on Earth would any oligarchic group (a small group) want to do this to tens of millions of people, deliberately and knowingly? General Suppression of Scientific Research on Fluorides All of these fluoride chemicals are by-products of the aluminum and chemical fertilizer industries that are considered to be hazardous wastes by the EPA. Robert J. Carton, an environmental scientist at the EPA, says the scientific assessment of the health risks of fluorides in 1985 'bmits 90% of the literature which suggests fluoride is a mutagen - causes cellular and genetic mutation.\" 27 Several scientists in the United States 25 Nexus, V012, No.27, AugISqt 1995, p.28. 26 Chemical Engineering News, Vol66, Aug lm 1988, p.39. 27 Water Fluoridation: A Case of Truth Decay. 304"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO and other countries who have done research or written reports questioning the benefits of water fluoridation, or suggesting health risks, were discouraged by their employers fiom actually publishing their findings2* In recent years, several dentists who have testified against fluoridation have been reprimanded by dental officers. The American Dental Association and the United States Public Health Service, who are supposed to be scientifically, not politically motivated, have actively discouraged research into the health risks of fluoridation of public water supplies. Public fhds have been spent to fight anti-fluoridation efforts. John A. Colquhoun, a former dental officer in the Department of Health in Auckland, New Zealand, did a study intended to show the advantages of fluoridation. He carefully compared decay rates in fluoridated and non-fluoridated regions. Unfortunately, he failed to find any difference in decay rates between the areas studied. Afer hisfinal report was written, his superviors refused to let him publish it.29 Institutions Subject to Government Extortion on the Issue of Fluorides W.B. Hartsfield, mayor of Atlanta, Georgia, stated in Dental Survey in 196 1 that \"no school, college or independent medical research institution dares to be critical of fluoridation because they receive grantsfiom the US. Public Health Service. Likewise, no big food, beverage or drug company will dare speak critically of fluoride because they are under the supervision of the FDA, a branch of the USPHS. One brewery official told me that their own research indicated grave questions about fluoridation, but they dare not speak out. As you know, the Food and Drug Ahinistration can bankrupt any national food, beverage or drug company with a little adverse comment.\" Now, why would the truth be so threatening to institutions that are supposed to protect public health and safii? Because these institutions are involved in the overall genocide against the population of the United States. The proof is a matter of historical record. That the Food and Drug Administration is a suppressive organization is a matter of record. Massive Corruption, Collusion and Conflict of Interest The same individuals promoting the addition of fluorides to the water supplies also serve on the FDA Dental Products Advisory Board. Fluoridation equipment makers, fluoride suppliers, and federal and state health department staff serve on the American Water Works Association's \"Fluoride Standards Board.\" The American Dental Association, who receives public funds, also receives hundreds of thousands of dollars fiom Proctor and Gamble, Lever Brothers, Colgate, Warner Lambert, Johnson & Johnson, and others in the fluoride business.

Countries Outside the United States Reject Fluoridation In 1977, the Minister of the Environment in Denmark recommended that water fluoridation not be allowed, primarily that no adequate studies had been carried out on its long-term effects on both human organ systems and fiesh water ecosystems. In 1978, the West German Association of Gas and Water Experts rejected fluoridation for legal reasons and because 'the so-called optimal fluoride concentration of 1 mm/L is close to the dose at which long-term damage to the human body is to be expected.\" In France, the Chief Council of Public Health rejected water fluoridation after he decided in 1980 that it was dangerous. American fluoridation spokesmen go to great lengths to deny the fact that most of the countries of medically advanced Western Europe have actively rejected fluoridation of public water supplies and the use of fluorides altogether. Fluoridation in Western Europe is now down to less than 2%. To illustrate how misleading fluoridation promoters in the United States can be, consider and article which appeared in the ADA News on January 23, 1978. The ADA article, titled \"Public Health Service (PHs) Refutes Claims of Fluoride Ban in Europe, \" discusses a pro-juoriiciation resolution which was voted on in the World Health Organization in 1969. The article states, \"Among the nations cited by anti- fluoridationists as those which have banned fluoridation, West Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia, actually supported the 1969 WHO resolution.\" What this 1978 ADA News article does not mention is that, subsequent to their 1969 vote supporting fluoridation, several of these countries reversed their stand, either by discontinuing fluoridation or by explicitly refusing to fluoridate in the first place. For example, Sweden banned fluoridation in 1971 after 11 years of testing it; the Netherlands banned fluoridation in 1976 after 23 years of 'kxperirnentation\" involving 9 million people; Norway rejected a Parliamentary bill to introduce fluoridation in 1975, and West Germany discontinued all fluoridation in 1971. Nor does the ADA article point out that, by the time it was written in 1978, the only one of the countries listed that still had any fluoridation whatever was Switzerland, which maintains a single \"experimental station.\" This Swiss 'kxperimental program,\" which serves 4% of the population, constitutes the only fluoridation in Switzerland fiom 1959 to the present. Finland also has one small 'kxperimental program,\" which has been operating since 1959, 'kerving\" about 1.5 % of the total population. In addition to all of the above, the countries of Holland, India, and Egypt permit no fluoridation of their populations. 'O Tampa Tribune, Aug 4, 1960, Phillip E.

Since that time the PHs has criminally promoted fluoridation throughout the United States, and actively promotes water fluoridation worldwide. Using a twisted logic born out of a Nazi biomedical orientation, the PHs believes that, if other countries can be convinced, blackmailed or extorted into fluoridating their populations, it would help reduce the American public opposition to involuntary medication. This is, of course, consistent with PHs attempts to conceal the refusal of most European countries to fluoridate. How, can the PHs ever dream of succeeding in their plans to intimidate other countries into compliance with the plans of global socialism to medicate the planet into compliance with a totalitarian planetary system of rule? International Fluoride Politics, Intimidation and Bribery The United States Public Health Service (USPHS), which historically has fhctioned in an Orwellian position exactly opposite to its title, exerts great influence on foreign countries through the World Health Organization (WHO), which it heavilyfinds, as well as through its numerous grants (bribes) to foreign Health Ministries, as well as to medical and dental researchers in those countries. For this reason, many European nations, desiring major research and healthcare grants from the United States, and umviling to find their awn research, avoid explicitly banning fluoridation and antagonizing the United States medical oligarchy. Instead, such a country quietly refuses fluoridation for itself whenever the question comes up. This normal policy of European countries to rqjectfluoridation without overtly declaring a ban on it has been deceptively used, on its face, by the ADA. For example, in the 1978 ADA article previously mentioned, the ADA refers to the 'histaken assumption by anti-fluoridationists that fluoridation hal; been banned in European countries.\" While the article is technically correct in denying that many European countries have banned fluoridation, it fails to point out that most European countries can and do reject fluoridation without formally banning it, i.e., without expressly prohibiting it by law. The fact of the matter is that Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece, Holland, Italy, Luxemborg, Norway, Spain and Sweden do not fluoridate public water supplies. Another very important fact never brough out by fluoridation spokesmen is that even those countries that introdice or vote in favor of a pro-fluorihtion resolution in the World Health Organization will usually not permit jluoriabon for their own people. In order to understand this apparent 'paradox,\" it is necessary to point out the following important fact. Always included, as part of the fluoridation resolution package, is the recommendation for WO finding to assist member states in their cavity-prevention program (which of course does not address the actual cause of dental caries, i.e., processed foods, etc.), even if they decide not tofluoriabte. This means that a country could not gracefully accept such \"assistance\" unless it votes for the resolution package."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO To cite another example of pressure techniques, it should be pointed out that WHO has long-assisted member nations in improving their water supply systems, independently of any considerations relative to involuntary medication of populations through the water supply itself However, the 1975 WHO fluoridation resolution contained a reminder of the Water Supply Assistance Program (WSAP), with the suggestion that water fluoridation be tied to this program. A country receiving aid under WSAP, but not fluoridating, would at least feel obligated to vote for the pro-fluoridation resolution. Further, such pro-fluoridation resolutions, which the WHO voted on in 1969, 1975 and 1978, have ahvays been 'hatered\" down in an attempt to make them acceptable. For instance, the resolutions never state that fluoridation should be implemented, but countries are subjected to a continuing plea for consideration. In 1969, when the WHO first voted in favor of such a fluoridation resolution, fluoridation promoters hailed the vote as a 'hnanimous endorsement\" of fluoridation. In fact, the promoters did not publicize the fact that the vote was taken when only about 60 of the I, 000 delegates were present (shadows of the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in the United States). Out of the 60 members present, only 45 actually voted. Most of the member nations were, in fact, not represented at all. Neither did fluoridation proponents point out the economic inrhrcements built into the resolution, for its weak non-committal wording. The ADA News article, often referred to by proponents of mass fluoridation, infers that the European countries which reject fluoridation do so against the recommendations of their respective \"health authorities': so that such rejections 'tannot be interpretated as a confirmation that fluoridation poses health hazards.\" The reply to this inference should be prefaced with the remark that, in any case, the scientific community should indeed not have the right to impose medication on the public when no 'tianger of contagion\" is involved. But, as it turns out, an extensive examination of European medical and dental journals shows the great majority of the European scientific community is in fact opposed to fluoridation. Consider, for example, Sweden, which is one of the most medically advanced countries on the planet. Sweden banned fluoridation by Parliamentary vote in 1971. The fluoridation proponents erroneously claim that the Swedish scientific community opposed this ban. In an article written by two pro-fluoridationists in the British Dental Joumal of July 18, 1972, the Swedish dental profession is attacked for not supporting fluoridation. The British government, who has a history of drugging populations in order to subjugate them, starting with the opium tra8ticking in the 17th century, have not lost their touch. The key fact remains that most medically advanced countries of Western Europe now have nofluoridation; not because they have neglected to consider it, but because of their own previous experiences with it or as a result of detailed and objective studies of the"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO scientific evidence of its hazards and biophysiological effect on both the human body and human behavior. In contrast to the United States, which is almosy 50%fluoridated, less than 2% of the population of Western Europe is subject to involuntary medication through their water supplies. The Goal of Global Socialism is PlanetaryFluoridation by the Year 2000 According to the Centers for Disease Control and the United States Public Health Service, the federal gd is 'to have universal fluoridation of ~ublic water suuulies bv the year 2000. This goal was detailed in the CDC Morbidity andMortality Report on May 29, 1992 and the American Dental Association News on January 3, 1994. It is an interesting parallel that the political agenda dictates establishment of a New World Order by 2002, moved up two years on analysis of political setbacks. Political Suppression of Scientific Information on Fluorides in the United States by Medical Journals and Associations In 1974 Sohan Manocha, now a lawyer, and Harold Warner, professor emeritus of biomedical engineering at Emory University Medical School in Atlanta, submitted a report summarizing a study of enzyme changes induced in monkeys by the consumption of water containing fluorine compounds for publication in the AMA Archives of Environmental Health. The editor passed the report around for review. It did not take long before he wrote a letter of rejection back to the authors. One of the peer reviewers had written a comment, \" I would recommend that this paper not be accepted for publication at this time, because this is a sensitive subject and any publication in this areas is subject to interpretation by anti-fluoridation groups.\"31 After the rejection of their paper, Manocha and Warner were told by the director of their department, who had been warned by the National Institute of Dental Research that the research \"would ham the cause of fluoridation,\" not to try to publish their findings in g other United States journal. Eventually the authors were granted permission to publish in a foreign journal, as indicated in the footnote below. In 1979, the American Dental Association issued a White Paper which includes the following statement, \"dntists non-cipation in fluoride promotion is overt neglect of professional re~ponsibility.\" According to an ADA spokesperson, this is still the organization's policy. Dentists who have a grain of conscience are reprimanded by their respective state dental officer.32 31 Chemical Engineering News, Aug 1, 1988, p.36.

Spokemen apparently say the report was \"thrown away because it was old, while maintaining that \"the department will be preparing another report on the subject soon.\" In 1982, John Colquhoun, former principle dental officer in the Department of Health in New Zealand was told after writing a report that showed no benefit from fluoridation in New Zealand, that the department refbsed him permission to publish it. He now teaches the history of education at the University of Auckland, and notes that \"the editorial policy of scientific journals has generally been not to publish material which overtly opposes thefluoridation paradigm.\" According to Colquhoun, scientific journals employ a referee system of peer review, and when the overwhelming majority of experts in an area from which the referees are selected are committed to the sharedparadigm of fluoridation (or any other paradigm), the ystem lends itself to preservation and continuation of the traditional belief that-fluoridation is safe and effective. Ris results in a \"sinzle-minded vromotion (materialist rediictionism), but poor-aualifv research. and an wvarent inabilifv to-flexiblv reassess in the presence qf unexpected new d6n.\"33 It is quite obvious that the same problem is apparent within the other paradigms (EMF effects, etc.) mentioned in Matrix III.

Smith, a dental surgeon from Melbourne, Australia, the editor of the New York State Dental Journal replied, \" Your paper was read here with interest, but it is not appropriate for publication at this time because the opposition to fluoridation has become virulent again.\"34 After the WHO released its study on fluorines and fluorides in 1985, it immediately drew criticism from scientific circles. In a letter from Phillipe Grandjean, a professor of environmental medicine at Odense University in Denmark (see illustration page) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on June 6, 1985, Grandjean wrote, \"information which could cast any doubt on the advantage of fluoride supplements was left out by the Task Group. Unless I had been present myseg I would have found it hard to believe.\" The 1985 WHO report was not the only thing under fire. Criticism of reports on fluorides authored by the EPA were also under scrutiny. According to Robert J. Carton, an environmental scientist at the EPA, the scientific assessment of fluorides health risks written by the agency in 1985 \"omits 90% of the literature on mutagenicity, most of which suggests fluoride is a mutagen.\"35 33 Ibid. p.36 34 bid. p.37 35 bid. p.36"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Tucson Study Finds Fluoride Promotes Tooth Decay - 1992 Those promoting the concept of water fluoridation maintain that the presence of fluoride in the human diet, whether in public water supplies, food, beverages or fiom other sources, assists in the prevention of dental caries (cavities). After conducting two years of research on the subject, contacting numerous organizations and pouring through mountains of scientific reports and documents, I could find no credible data supporting this conclusion. In fact, I found exactly the opposite was the case. It explains why the American Dental Association and the National Institute for Dental Research have always supported fluoridation of the population. Aside from the issues of cancer, mutagenicity, osteoporosis and behavior control, one of the results of fluoridation is that it actually creates more cavities in order to support the dentalprofession. Where's the proof3 According to Cornelius Steelink, professor emeritus at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona, who was intimately involved in the debate to fluoridate the water of Tucson, when the incidence of tooth decay versus fluoride content in a child's drinking water was examined in Tucson, a city with discreate geographic areas of groundwater with both high fluoride content (0.8ppm) and low content (0.3ppm), a positive correlation was revealed. Dental screening was conducted of 26,000 elementary school children. When the incidence of tooth decay was plotted against the fluoride content of the water, it was discovered that the more fluoride a child drank. the more cavities w~eared in the teeth. The fluoride debate in Tucson started when the local county board of health, soon joined by state and federal \"public health\" organizations, requested that the city of Tucson add fluoride to the drinking water. The city refmed the mattter to the subcommittee chaired by Dr. Steelink. The subcommittee also discovered that a large population of poor children would get no benefit fiom optimum fluoride in the water, as the largest factors in tooth decay (besides processed foods and sugar) were lack of access to dental facilties, poverty and poor oral hygiene. In it's final report, the subcommittee stated that 'there was no obvious relation of fluoride content in municipal water to the prevention of tooth decay in Tucson\" and 'because there are multiple causes of tooth decay, a decision to fluoridate would still leave pockets of poor dental health.\"36 Furthermore, it was reported that \"children, who lived in a fluoridated community, had 11 times the odds of developing fluor~sis.'~' Studies of young males and fluoridated water have produced some interesting results. A February 1991 U.S. Public Health Sexvice study linked fluoridated water to bone cancer in young males in Seattle, Washington and Iowa. A New Jersey Department of Health Study in November 1992 found bone cancer rates among young males to be six times higher in fluoridated than in non-fluoridated c~mmunities.~~ 36 Townsend Letter for Doctors, October 1994. 37 Clinical Pediatrics, Nw 1991. 38 Safe Water Coalition of Warhington State, West 5615 Lyons a, Spokane, Wash. 509-328-6704."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Environmental Fluoridation of Indian Tribes: A Case History It is of interest that many of the facilities producing environmental pollution containing significant amounts of fluorides are located in areas also inhabited by native peoples. Although an exhibit is included regarding this matter in Australia with the aborigine people [who operate in a diierent basal paradigm threatening to material scientism, as do American native peoples and those in many Third World countries], it is necessary to illustrate a significant case in point relative to the United States. In 1980, the Mohawk tribe, located on the New York-Canadian St. Regis Reservation, filed a $150 million lawsuit for damage to themselves and their property against the Reynolds Metals Company and the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). Between 1960 and 1975, industrial pollution devastated the tribes cattle herd and the complete way of life of the tribe. The cattle were so crippled because of the fluorides that would settle on the land, that they would crawl around the pasture on their stomachs--a pitifid sight. Birth defects were common. After five years, legal costs bankrupted the tribe, and they settled for $650,000 in damages to their cows.' The courts, however, allowed fitture action by the Mohawks for damage to their own health. The judge was apparently not in the mood to approve annihilation of the tribe by fluoride emissions--the same industrial toxic pollutant that is dumped into public water supplies as a convenience to escape complex EPA regulations for disposal of toxic wastes. This has been admitted by the EPA [see the exhibit provided in this book]. Today, the Mohawk tribe fishes in the St. Lawrence river. The catch is comprised of fish with ulcerated spinal deformities. Mohawk children also exhibit damage to their bones and teeth. No one outside the tribe seems to care. After all, hasn't the most important consideration been the annihilation of indigenous people in support of the Darwinian-Malthusian mandate? Fluorides as a Toxic Industrial Pollutant Impacting Human Physiology Although the main focus relative to the subject of fluorides is its direct administration to humans, an equally important and signrficant issue is the effect on humans from intentional2 and continuous exposure of the human population to airborne toxic industrial emissions, fluoride being the subject of immediate discussion. According to the EPA, fluoride remains one of indusQ 's lamest pollutants. In 1988, the EPA estimated at least 155,000 tons each ve9? are being released into the year by United States industrial plants. Emissions into water (over and above fluoridation of public water supplies) have been estimated to be as high as 500.000 tons a vear.

Fluorides, by the way, are not biodegradable; with that in mind it is both curious and understandable why the cumulative effect is never discussed. Environmental Sources of Fluoride Compounds The atmosphere in the United States is contaminated by fluoride emissions from the production of iron, steel, aluminum, copper, lead, zinc, phosphates (the main source for water fluoridation chemicals), plastics, gasoline, brick, cement, glass, ceramics and clay products, electrical power generation, combustion processes, and uranium processing (a double whammy for uranium worker^).^ In ten& of pollution of water, the leading industrial fluoride polluters are the producers and processors of glass, pesticides and fertilizers, steel and aluminum, chemicals and metals.' Obviously, industry and government have a powerful motive for claiming, even falsely, that \"increasing doses of fluoride are safe for the population,\" despite the absolute fact that fluoride is by far the most toxic to vegetation, animals and humans6 As a matter of fact, fluoride is one of the most toxic substances known.' The United States Department of Agriculture, who has for years been involved in dosing both the population and the environment with neurotoxins [see pesticide discussion], ironically admits that 'hirborne fluorides have caused more worldwide damage to domestic animals than any other air pollutant.\"8 How early did science and industry know that fluorides can negatively affect the environment? As early as 1901, studies found that ''jluoride compounds are much more toxic that the other compounds that are of significance in the industrial smoke problem.\"g So, evidence that industrial fluoride has been killing and crippling not only animals but humans has existed at least since the 1930 3. Not only has the United States government, as mandated by the basal paradigm, dismissed the danger and left industry fiee to pollute [causing disease and medical profit], but it has promoted the intentional addition of fluoride [industrial waste] to the drinking water of the population. The problem of fluoride pollution of crops, livestock and people was known as early as 1850 because of the emissions of iron and copper industries. Because of this, lawsuits and regulation threatened the existence of these industries in Germany and England.

In the earlier, more honest days of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the senior toxicologist in 1933, Lloyd DeEds, was quoted as saying, 'It is a well-established fact that chronic intoxication [with fluorides] may manifest itself in man as recognized abnormalities after constant, or at least frequent, exposure ... the possibility of fluoride hazard should be recognized in indusv, where this element is discharged into the air as an apparently worthless Aluminum had a critical role during World War 11, and by 1938 the aluminum industry had been placed on a wartime schedule, producing an ever-increasing by-product of toxic fluorides. Die cover-up of the efJects of fluorides was necessmy to allow the growth of US. industries and to suppress knowledge of the \"benefit\" of its behaviorally modzfiing qualities learnedfi.om the Germans. With the birth of the military-industrial complex, mandated by the basal paradigm discussed at the beginning of this book, along with its concomitant public misinformation campaigns, there was understandably a blitz to convince the unknowing American public that \"fluoride is safe, and good.\" The realization by the military-industrial complex that knowledge about fluorides had to be suppressed was mirrored in the 1939 announcement by Gerald J.Cox, a scientist fbnded by the Aluminum Company of America, that \"the present trend toward complete removal of fluoride from water and food may need some reversal.\"\" Reversal? Yes, they knew the danger of fluorides and they had begun to plan the removal of fluoride wastes fiom the environment. Well, reversal was taken to the extreme. The first 'fluoridation experiments\" were undertaken between 1945 and 1946, in true Malthusian style, on indigent, mentally retarded children at state-run schools, one of which was the Wrentham State School for Feebleminded Children. The \"experiment\" was conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Health without the knowledge of the school administration. According to 1954 Congressional testimony of school 'trustee\" Florence Birmingham, \"I found in the files a letter revealing that a health department representative had come to the school, and in a conference with administration officials, warned them that there should be no publicity on the fluoride program there.\"12 Well, we know where the Nazi expertise ended up after the war, don't we, and the methodology remained the same. The same as at Hadarnar, where the Nazi's began their killing with the indigent and mentally retarded. Interesting coincidence. The same year, in 1946, the 'bfficial fluoridation experiment': publicly slated to last 15 years and compare results with an unfluoridated city, began in Michigan. At the same time that this publicly-declared 'kxperiment\" began, six other cities were fluoridated. 'O Lloyd DeEds, \"Chronic Fluorine Intoxication,\" Medicine, Vo1.12, 1933, pp. 1-60. G. J.

In 1947, ex-ALCOA lawyer Oscar win^'^ was appointed head of the Federal Security Administration, which at the time was also in charge of the U.S. Public Health Service. Ewing, who was aware of the fluoride disposal problem of the aluminum industry, hired Edward Bernays. The \"Genius\" of the Fluoridation Plan ~erna~s'~ was a public relations specialist who specialized in \"programfning the public mind,\"15 and very soon a 'hational fluoridation campaign\" was introduced to the public, who at the same time were beginning to realize that decay problems with teeth (because of the processed food) were becoming rampant. It was a miracle solution. Feed the public fluorides, save money on processing hazardous waste, make the public more compliant and less resistant to authority by affecting their brains, and lastly, reap tremendous medical profits because of the genetic damage and general degeneration caused by the fluorides. The same rationale was applied to chemical wastes as food additives and the medical profits gained by the cancer industry, who periodically gained additional fbnds by soliciting the public in the 'kar against cancer.\" Ail of it was a brilliant plan, and it was just the tip of the iceberg. It was the old Malthusian paradigm again--to increase the mortality rate of the non-elite. As with Hitler, nobody would believe anyone could do such a thing. But it was true, and we have more than demonstrated the proof of it. Why should it be any different--thee~aradimn was the same. One of the champions against fluoridation was Frederick Exner, who accumulated volumous files that were a source of pivotal evidence in lawsuits decided against industry and promoters of fluoridation. He was the first to document government and industry complicity in the suppression of the hazardous nature of fluorides. After his death in 1978, his files were destroyed in a very \"mysterious\" fire. Despite the fact that tens of thousands of people, government, and industry have lied to us for the last 60 years, remember that it is the paradigm that is the problem. They all bought into the paradigm.

Is Bernays wrote Propaganda in 1928, and explained the 'Saucture of the mechanism which controls the public mind, and how it was manipulated by the special pleader (public relations counsel), who creates public acceptance for a particular idea or commodity. According to Bernays, 'those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute ah invisible eovemment which is the true power of our coun try... our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by mean we have never heard of, either with or without their conscious cooperation.\" [Edward Bernays, Propaganda (New York: H. Liveright, 1928), p.181 Bernays also pushed other socialist control paradigms, such as nationalized medicine. Many recognized the socialism involved, but were dubbed \"crazies\" and 'hmmies\", which was ironic, because Communism is international socialism in an extreme form."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Last Minute Bullets on Fluorides Fluorides Block Telepathic Reception in Humans I realize that the above statement is no less than amazing, but it is something I stumbled on in September 1995 quite by accident. I started out more than 25 years ago in the field of parapsychology, before I became interested in free energy devices and their suppression (which originally got me started on this whole adventure). One of the books I still have from that era, called Beyond Telepathy, by Andrija ~uharich,~ relates a tremendous amount of scientific research to do with telepathic states. An incredible piece of work, and very well documented. Anyway, Andrija discusses that fact that telepathic transmission is dependent on the sympathetic nervous system, which is activated by adrenalin-like compounds. Thus the telepathic transmission state is called a state of aclrenergra. Now, the state of telepathic reception is dependent on the parasympathetic nervous system, which released acetylcholine, and is called the cholinergrc state. In September 1995, I was reading scientific papers on fluoride, and the statement was made that fluorides are anti-cholinergic in nature. This, of course, means that a side function of fluoridation is su~pression of telepathic reception in the population I'm probably the only one who's discovered this curious fact, but I thought I would pass it on to you. Presuming that development of telepathic functions in a population is itself a function of the evolution of the morphogenetic field [Sheldrake, Matrix 111 Vol I], and such development would be a threat to the current basal paradigm [as I mentioned before with the vicious suppression in Canada of a drug that promoted telepathy], and the fact that developed drugs like telepathin, and native plants which have a cholinergic effect are suppressed in the paradigm, \"it would make good sense\" for the power elite to suppress the general awakening of the population that would occur as the morphogenetic field evolved. In a way, it sort of explains why the efJorts to suppress the human brain have been inordinately accelerated as we approach the interesting period ahead. Also, take a look at the rest of the information in the Matrix III volumes, match and sympathetic effects of various substances mentioned, and you will arrive at additional data relative to this curious and amazing discovery. More Comparisons Between Fluoridated and Unfluoridated Populations An interesting bit of news has come fiom the Netherlands comparing two cities, Tie1 and Culemborg. On November 5, 1994, Dutch television broadcast an interview with Dr. Josephien van den Berg, a dentist, who related the following. Tie1 was fluoridated in 1952, and a control city, Culemborg, was not fluoridated. No provisions were made to compare various health aspects of the two cities. In 1973, the High Court of the Netherlands, after 20 years, came to the conclusion thatfluoridation of the water supplies had been an illegal act. Tie1 then stopped adding fluoride to the drinking water. Van den Berg wanted to know it differences in health had occurred between Tie1 and Culemborg after the 20 year period ending in 1973.

In 1991, the Akron (Ohio) Regional Poison Center reported that \"death has been reported following ingestion of 16mgkg of fluoride. Only 1/10 of an ounce of fluoride could kill a 100 pound adult. According to the Center, \"fluoride toothpaste contains up to lmgtgram of fluoride.\" Even Proctor and Gamble, the makers of Crest, acknowledge that a farnily- sized tube \"theoretically contains enough fluoride to kill a small child.\" Fluorides have been used to modifv behavior and mood of human bein~s. It is a little known fact that fluoride compounds were added to the drinking water of prisoners to keep them docile and inhibit questioning of authority, both in Nazi prison camps in World War I1 and in the Soviet gulags in Siberia. Fluorides are medicallv cate~orized as ~roto~lasmic ~oisons, which is whv thev are used to kill rodents. 1 943 The Journal ofthe American Medical Association on September 18, 1943, states, \"fluorides are general ~rotoplasmic poisons, changing the permeability of the cell membrane by inhibiting certain enzymes. i%e exact mechanism of such actions are obscure. \" Fluoride consum~tion bv human beinps increases the ~eneral cancer death rate. 1975 Dr. John Yiamouyiannis publishes apreliminary survey which shows that people in fluoridated areas have a higher cancer death rate than those in non-fluoridated areas. The National Cancer Institute attempts to refbte the studies. Later in 1975, Yiarnouyiannis joins with Dr. Dean Burk, chief chemist of the National Cancer Institute (1 93 9- 1974) in performing other studies which are then included in the Congressional Record by Congressman Delaney, who was the original author of the Delanev Amendment, which prohibited the addition of cancer-causing substances to food used for human consumption. Both re~orts confirmed the existence of a link between fluoridation and cancer.

He additionally finds that a substantial number of children in fluoriciated areas sufleredfrorn dentalfluorosis. He makes the study public. There is no scientific data that shows that fluoride mouth rinses and tablets are safe for human use. 1989 A study by Hildebolt, et al. on 6,000 school children contradicts any alleged benefit from the use of sodium fluorides. 1990 A study by Dr.John Yiarnouyiannis on 39,000 school children contradicts any alleged benefits from the use of sodium fluorides. 1992 Michael Perrone, a legislative assistant in New Jersey, contacts the FDA requesting all information regarding the safety and effectiveness of fluoride tablets and drops. After 6 months of stalling, the FDA ahitted they had no &a to show that fluoride tablets or drops were either safe or effective. They informed Perrone that they will \"probably have to pull the tablets and drops off the market.\" The fact that fluoride tooth~astes and school-based mouth rinses are ~ackaeed in aluminum accentuates the effect on the bodv. 1976 Dr. D.W.Allman and co-workers from Indiana University School of Medicine feed animals lpart-per-million (ppm) fluoride and found that in the presence of aluminum in a concentration as small as 20 parts Der billion fluoride is able to cause an even larger increase in cyclic AMP levels.

It is extremely important that the Panel seriously investigate some of the major.abuses of science and scientific personnel that have occurred, if it hopes to understand the dynznics of science in a regulatory agency.

It is based on personal experience. For obvious reasons the author must remain anonymous. The handllng of Sodium Fluoride - putting it into the waterworks - caused us some concern. Before we could do any work in that area we had to undress and then put on special overalls, spec~al boots and gloves. Every part of us was sealed entirely, including the hair and head, and we wore breathing apparatus with replaceable filters and eyeglasses to protect us from the toxic dust. We were warned when handling the material that the procedures for ensuring that we were dressed properly and had the protective goggles and face mask on were strictly kept to at all times. The Sodium Fluoride was very heavy to handle. It was contained in a plastic bag within a cardboard drum weighing about 400 Ibs. We had to have a crane to lilt the drums and tip the contents into a hopper. The Sodium Fluoride was lhen automatically fed through a measuring device into a mixing chamber and then finally injected into the water main. Sometimes there were occasional problems with the feed controlling devices. The quantity of fluoride was never tested as we did for chlorine content. It was automatically assumed that the correct dosage was going into the water supply. We did not conduct any tests to indicate how much fluoride was, in lac!, in \\he water. Our only comparison was between the total amount used and the total water flow:, Chlorine. however. was tested continuousiy. automatically and also manually every morning at 9 am. If there was an emergency and the water main was dosed up, alarms would sound withtn the building and it was necessary to go down and shut those machines off. They also had relays which automatically triggered out but we still had to follow up manually. An operator was always within about ten .mtnutes of the plant. When the drums were empty,' we burnt them., in an tnanerator wtside the plant. Once this was done we had to start undressing. We would walk over to a special room, Jose the door behind us and strip off all our clothing and-equipment entirely. Thts would be dropped through a hole direct into a lorm of washing machine which gave an initial rinse. We would then shower. scrub our fingernails and all the orifices of our body as carefully as possible and then step out into another area, dry ourselves and gel dressed again. We were informed that even small crystals of Sodium Fluoride under our finger nails were enough to do us serious health damage if dropped onto our food, for example, whilst we were eating.

Kopf 104 Meridian Road Levittown, New York 11756 Dear Ms. Kopf: I 1 This is to follow-up our letter of January 17 regarding your request for information on the handling of the chemical, hydrofluosilicic acid. Hydrofluosilicic acid (fluosilicic acid) is classified as a corrosive material. It is a by-product of the action-of sulfuric acid on phosphate rock containing fluorides and silica or silicates. The hydrofluoric acid acts on the silica to produce silicon tetrafluoride, which reacts with water to form fluosilicic acid. It is highly toxic and extremely corrosive by skin contact and inhalation. Specific packaging requirements for transporting this chemical are contained in Section 173.265 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These hazardous materials regulations are promulgated and administered by the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation. Should you have additional questions on packaging, you may wish to contact their Office of Hazardous Materials Technology directly. They may be reached at (202) 366-4545. Finally, in response to your request for.more specific information in the form of a \"fact sheet,\" we would like to suggest that you write directly to the chemical manufacturer. He are pleased to be able to enclose a list of these, as taken from the 1990 Directory of Chemical Producers. He are able to provide a copy of a technical data sheet extracted from the U.S. Coast Guard CHRIS [Clremical HazarJs Response Information Systeifi] manual. This resource material is intended to provide the on-scene coordinator or other responsible officials with some of the technical information necessary to properly respond to discharges of hazardous chemicals.

Considerable quantities of sodium silicofluoride are imported. Sodium silicofluoride is normally packed in bags and drums similar to those used for sodium fluoride. OTHER FLUORlDE COMPOUNDS Ammonium silicofluoride, magnesium silicofluoride, potassium fluoride, and calcium fluoride (fluorspar), as well as hydrofluoric acid, have been used for water fluorida- tion. Each has particular properties that make the material desirable in a specific application, but none of them have widespread application in the United States. Fluorspar is used frequently in South America, particularly in- Brazil. Ammonium silicofluoride has the 'advantage of supplying all or part of the ammonium ion necessary for the production of chloramines, when this form of disin- fectant is preferred to chlorine in a particular situation. Magnesium silicofluoride and potassium fluoride have the advantage of extreme- ly high solubility, which is of particular importance in applications such as school fluoridation, where infrequent refills of the solution container are desired. In addi- tion, potassium fluoride is quite compatible with potassium hypochlorite, so a mixture of the two can be used for simultaneous fluoridation and chlorination. Calcium fluoride (fluonpar) is the least expensive of the compounds used for fluoridation and also the least soluble. It has been successfully fed by first dissolving it in alum solution and then using the resultant solution to supply both the alum needed for coagulation and the fluoride ion. However, this method of operation is wasteful because of 'fluoride loss during alum coagulation and filtration (see chap- ter 4). Hydrofluoric acid, although low in cost, presents too much of a safety and cor- rosion hazard to be acceptable for general water fluoridation. It has, however, been used in a specially designed installation. Other fluoride~compounds have been suggested for use in water fluoridation, among them ammonium and sodium biflubride. These materials have the advantages of high solubility and low cost, but their potential corrosiveness has made them generally unacceptable. The manufacturers or suppliers of the various fluoride compounds can provide technical data and specification sheets that will assist the prospective purchaser in selecting the appropriate grade of chemical for the type of feeder being used. CHEMICAL IMPURITIES Trace amounts of impurities, especially arsenic, lead, and zinc, may be introduced into fluoride chemicals during production. Normally, impurities are at levels far below that which would necessitate the establishment of maximum impurity limits.' As with all direct additives for water treatment, purchasers of chemicals must ensure that impurities are not present at levels that would deteriorite the quality of the water being treated. AWWA standards exist for sodium fluoride? sodium silicofluoride? and hydrofluosilicic acid.4 All chemicals used for fluoridation should be comparable in quality to the requirements of these standards."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO *.a0 a*., * UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WASHINGTON.

You are most certainly aware that very severe cases occur in developing countries wher.e calcium deficiency may render the patients more susceptible to fluorlde toxicity. Perhaps the problem is most severe in lndia where.every single state has areas or pockets of high fluoride. During my short stays in this country, I have seen many cases of crippling fluorosis, some with spinal cord compression. My colleague, Dr. A.K. Susheela, of the All lndia Institute of Medlcal Sclences In New Delhi. has estimated that a total of PO million people in lndia are exposed to toxlc amounts of fluorlde, about half of them experiencing symptoms at this tlme. This number is of course a very rough estimate. However, nobody would doubt that fluoride toxicity in some developing countries is a very important public health problem. Unfortunately, fluoride toxicity has been a \"faut pas\" for many years, and anybody discussing this topic would be suspected to belong to the antifluoridation movement. Thus, the recently published Environmental Health Crlterla 36 on Fluorine and Fluorides (WHO, 1980) only superficially discusses chronic toxicity, while beneficial effects and safety margins are dealt wlth in detail. As Temporary Adviser I was present at most of the Task Croup meetin8 when the document was finalized. In accordance with the official fluorldation policy, informatlon which could cast any doubt on the advantage of fluoride supplements was left out by the Task Croup.

I would like to pass a long a few tips that have gotten some responses from people who were previously pro- fluoridators. I like to use the approach that first states what everybody has agreed upon in the U.S. and progress to the more controversial. First it is agreed by all people who think themselves knowledgeable about fluoride that the effect on teeth is limited to children three years or younger. That means everybody else who is three years and one day or older is exposed unnecessarily. Second I reiterate that when using the measures of filled, partially filled and missing teeth-comparing fluoridated and non-fluoridated water supplies the world over, including the U.S.A., -there is either no significant difference - or more often, people using fluoridated water have significantly more caries. That even very small amounts of fluoride cause brittle, hard to repair teeth. Third, I cite the studies that demonstrate that the rate of hip fracture is at least double amongst people 65 or older in fluoridated areas- including the most recent studies less than one year old. That people who imbibe fluoridated water are twice as likely to be hard of hearing at age 65 or older. Fourth, I state that the act of fluoridating water increases lead exposure especially to children because of two facts- a. The fluoride added to drinking water often has up to 400 mg of lead per liter and b. the corrosive action of fluoride extracts lead from pipes and solder joints increasing lead exposure of the young. (Babies up to 3 months absorb 16 times as much lead per unit body weight than adults. Black babies and children because of genetic make-up absorb significantly more lead than white babies.)"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Fifth, I tell the story of the two large prospective studies (the best kind of epidemiology evidence available) completed in New Jersey and New York State that determined the incidence of osteosarcoma (almost always fatal) in men under 18 years of age increased by 6 to 8 fold. That an increase of this maghitude is prima facia evidence of a real ongoing effect. I remind them that one of President Kennedy's nephews had the disease. I find that people are simply not willing to believe that our government would condone the addition of a compound to the water supply that was not efficacious. This is why in my opinion it has not been possible to convince enough people of conscience to review the fluoride story. You must remember that the National Academy of Science released a report that sort of said fluoridation was OK. They do not know that the members hand-picked for the panel were known to be pro- fluoridation. They were not present when the pathologist from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology stated that any bone or tooth structure that contains fluoride is weak, crumbling and highly undesirable. They were not present when they board calculated that the amount of fluoride ingested daily was far higher than previously believed. They discovered that soft drinks including, Coke, Pepsi and Seven-Up were made by diluting concentrate with fluoridated water. That Kool-Aid, baby formula etc. also would have fluoride. They were informed that these exposures were not considered by EPA when setting the current standard. They did not allow me to explain that the levels of fluoride found in the bones of rodents who had osteosarcoma was lower than the level found in human adults exposed to allowable levels of fluoride. I was not permitted to explain that with the exception of fluoride, no other compounds including radioactive compounds, have been able to produce osteosarcomas in rodents. I hope these facts will help. Very truly yours, William L.

Dr. Bernard M. Wagner, a New York University School of Medicine professor and chairman of the NRC committee, said that the only proven harm to health from fluo- ride-laced drinking water that his panel could find was an increase in staining or pitting of tooth enamel, a condition known as dental fluoro- sis. About 10 percent of Americans experience tooth staining in a \"very mild to mild form, he said. \"The ovewhelming benefits of fluoride in water in terms of pre- venting cavities, allowing young children to have a life of good teeth and maintaining those teeth into older life. far outweighs the small percentage of our population that shows fluorosis,\" said Wagner. An Environmental Protection Agency standard of no more than 4 parts per million of fluoride in drinking water was viewed by the committee as \"appropriate.\" But the panel said this standard should be changed if new research indi- cates it. American cities began adding fluoride to their water supply in the 1940s after research suggested it would reduce dental decay among the young. It is estimated that abopt 132 million Americans now use drinking water with fluoride levels above .7 parts per million, considered the minimum beneficial level. The NRC committee said it is unable to gauge the true fluoride exposure that Americans experi- ence because the chemical is present in foods, beverages and a wide array of dental products. In addition, fluoride often is applied during visits to a dentist. As a result, said Wagner, the committee called for continued study to determine if a lifetime ex- posure to low levels of fluoride could be harmful. The committee found some stud- ies that suggested that a long-term exposure to fluoride caused an in- creased tendency toward hip or vertebrae fracture after age 80. Among the study's findings: m \"The weight of the evidence from more than 50 epidemiological studies does not support the hypothesis of an association between fluoride exposure and increased cancer risk in humans.\" = Fluoride ingestion at approved levels did not increase risk of kidney disease or stomach or digestive problems, There are \"no adverse effects\" on human reproduction from current levels of fluoride in drinking water. Animal studies that linked the chemical to birth defects and infertility involved far higher doses than people are exposed to."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Case of Mass Fluoride Poisoning in Alaska in 1992 Morning News Tribune, Tacoma, Washington, July 2, 1992 Mass fluoride poisoning blamed on pump, government BY Davld HUI@~ md dc[ends the practice of adding Of fluoride dating at least to Janu- McClatchy News Servlce fluoride to public water supplies. ary 1991.

HRUDEY, P~.D..' COLlN L. SOSKOLNE, PL.D.,~ JOHANNES BERKEL. M.D.. P~.D.: SHIRLEY FINCHAiVI, M.A.' M edia reports beginning in late 1989, concerning results from a U.S. National Toxicology Program bioassay on rats exposed to sodium fluoride in drinking water, have rekindled the debate over the safety of fluoridated water.[ This debate. which has raged for over 45 years, has been very bitter, with lack of objectivity apparent among proponents and opponents of drinking water fluoridation.' Fluoride occurs naturally in varying amounts in nonfluoridated waters and many food sources. If drinking water is fluoridated, typically to a concentration of 1 mg/L, this source has been estimated to contribute approximately two thirds of the total dietary fluoride intake, with the remainder coming from food.' Various adverse health effects have bein attributed to fluoride ingestion. Dental and skeletal fluorosis are well documented for sufficiently high fluoride doses, but evidence on carcinogenicity has been unconvincing. The U.S. National Cancer Institute initiated a cancer bioassay on fluoride in 1977,:which was taken over by the newly created National Toxicology Program (NTP). The study was completed in 1983. However, the results were declared \"inadequate\" because of mortality problems, attributed to diet, which included both the experimental animals and the controls. The study was redesigned and was completed in 1987, with the final interpretation and publication of results scheduled for 1990. A summary of these results obtained by the media led to report9 with headlines like: \"Don't Drink the Water? Brush your teeth, but the fluoride from your tap may not do much good - and may cause cancer.\" The bioassay results which led to this furor showed the occurrence of osteosarcoma among male rats at the two highest fluoride doses (4 out of 80 exposed to 79 mgl L and 1 out of 50 exposed to 45 mg/ L). No osteosarcoma was found I. Enrironmental dt Ormpa~ional Health F'rognm. 2. Epidcmiolow Promam. Depanmcnt of Hcalth Scrvim Adminulracion & Communit Medicine. Univemily of Alkm. 3.

A panel convened to review the National Toxicology Program evaluation of these results has unanimously endorsed the finding that there is \"equivocal\" evidence of carcinogenic activity of sodium fluoride in male rats, meaning that \"studies arc interpreted as showing a marginal increase of neoplasms that may be chemically related.? Public concern inevitably arises when results such as these are publicized. Extrapolation of risk prediction to humans from such animal studies is largely theoretical. However. because of the apparently specific nature of the cancers found in the rat bioassay and the knowledge that fluoride is deposited in bone, a comment on the prevalence of osteosarcoma in humans is warranted. The Alberta Cancer Board has maintained a population- based cancer registry since 1960, which incorporates all cancers.

Edmonton adopted fluoridation in 1967, while Calgary had not accepted fluoridation until it was passed in a municipal referendum in the fall of 1989. The osteosarcoma incidence data for patients with a residence in either Calgary or Edmonton at the time of diagnosis are presented in Table I. These data fail to reveal either any difference between Calgary and Edmonton, or any apparent trend over time in the incidena of osteosarcoma. Because of the relatively crude nature of the evaluation, the lack of apparent differences does not preclude the existence of subtle differenks. However, the most relevant aspect of these data for the concerned public is perhaps the low overall incidence of osteosarcoma in either city. These low osteosarcoma incidence rates (Calgary 0.29 per 1.00,000; Edmonton 0.27 per 100,000) compare equally with the provincial rate over the period 1970-1988, of 0.3 per 100,000 population. To further demonstrate consistency in the lack of any association, an analysis of the provincial impact of TABLE 111 Age Distribution of Osteosarcoma Incident' Cases, Alberta, 1970-1988 Age at diagnosis (yun) All cues Calgary Edmonton Ekewhen 1-2 0 0 0 0 34 I I 0 0 5-6 2 I 0 I 7-8 4 I I 2 9-10 4 I 2 I 11-12 9 I 2 6 13-14 9 2 I 6 215 74 22 20 32 Total . 103 29 26 48 I osteosarcoma reveals no difference between urban and rural rates. These results were obtained by combining the urban centre cases from Calgary and Edmonton and then comparing this total (n = 55, or 53%) to that for the rural remainder of the province (n = 48, or 47%). The urban-rural incidence is approximately proportional to the population distribution. Indeed, the provincial rate, excluding both Calgary and Edmonton, for the period 1970-1988, remains 0.3 per 100,000 population. The concentration of fluoride in Edmonton drinking water since 1967, has been approximately 1 mg/L while Calgary's natural background level has averaged around 0.3 mglL. These values are more than an order of magnitude lower than concentrations to which the rats in the NTP study were exposed. We recognize that with a likely latency period in excess of 25 years for osteosarcoma, any differences between Calgary and Edmonton should not be expected to become evident before 1993. If age at first exposure is a factor, excess osteosarcoma rates among adolescents, if present, should now be detectable. However, an analysis of Alberta data (Table 11) has failed to identify any such excesses; nor are any trends evident. Of course, with so rare a tumour in populations the size of Calgary and Edmonton, stable rates and statistical significance are never likely to be achieved. Table 111 reveals that most cases of osteosarcoma were diagnosed after the age of 15 years. No differences between Calgary and Edmonton are evident among the younger age at diagnosis groupings. Although these data do not allow any definitive conclusions about the role of nuoridation as a risk factor for osteosarcoma in humans, they do show that the current upper bound of any such cancer risk must, at wont, be extremely low. By the same logic, if any absolute increase in osteosarcoma incidence were to arise in the future, it should be readily apparent when compared to cumnt small numbers. Based on the evidence to date, we conclude that there is no link between fluoridation and osteosarcoma among Albertans. REFERENCES I. Marshall E. The fluoride debate: One more time.

GESSNLR, M.D., MICHAEL BELLER, M.D., M.P.H., JOHN P. MIDDAUGH, M.D., AND GARY M. WHITFORD, PH.D., D.M.D. Abstract Background. Acute fluoride poisoning pro- duces a clinical syndrome characterized by nausea, vom- iting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and paresthesias. In May 1992. excess fluoride in one of two public water systems serving a village in Alaska caused an outbreak of acute fiuoride poisoning. Methods. We SU~eyed residents, measured their uri- nary fluoride concentrations, and analyzed their serum- chemistry profiles. A case of fluoride poisoning was defined as an illness consisting of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdorcinai pain, or numbness or tingling of the face or extremities that began between May 21 and 23. Resufts. Among 47 residents studied who drank water obtained on May 21.22, or 23 from the implicated well, 43 (91 percent) had an illness that met the case definition, as compared with only 6 of 21 residents (29 percent) who drank water obtained from the implicated wen at other times and 2 of 94 residents (2 percent) served by the other S INCE the late 1940s, many communities in the United States have adjusted the fiuoride concm- :ration in their water systems to prevent dental caries.' Xumerous studies attest to the effecaveness'and safety of maintaining fluoride concentrations in the range recommended by the Public Hedth Senrice - 0.7 to 1.2 mg per liter.\"' As of 1989, a total of 941 1 public water systems in the United States provided fluoridat- ed drinking water to 135 million people,' yet only six outbreaks of acute fluoride poisoning related to over- ..':ioridation have been re~orted.~~~ Acute fluoride ~oi- rvning caused the dcath'of one patient in ~ar~ind~ and, recently, of three patients in Illinois (Flanders R, IlIinois Department of Public Hedth: personal com- munication), all of whom were undergoing dialysis therapy. In this paper we describe an outbrd of acute fluoride poisoning resulting from overffuorida- tion of a public water system.

On May 26, 1992, the Alaska Division of Public Halth w;u ootified of an outbreak of acute gasPointatid illnus in the we. The water system in section 1 had born med off on water system. We estimated that 296 people were poi- soned; 1 person died. Four to five days after the outbreak, 10 of the 25 case patients who were tested, but none of the 15 control subjects. had elevated urinary fluoride concen- trations. The case patients had elevated serum fluoride concentrations and other abnormalities consistent with flu- oride poisoning. such as elevated serum lactate dehydro- genase and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations. The fluoride concentration of a water sample from the im- plicated well was 150 mg per liter, and that of a sample from the other system was 1.1 mg per liter. Failure to monitor and respond appropriately to elevated fluoride concentrations, an unreliable control system, and a mech- anism that allowed fluoride concentrate to enter the well led to this outbreak. Conclusions. Inspection of public water systems and monitoring of fluoride concentrations are needed to pre- vent outbreaks of fluoride poisoning.

The outbreak resulted in one serious illness and one death. On May 23, a 37-year-old woman with a two-day hilory of vomiting zr.5 diarrtra was cvrcuaced by air to a regiood hospital. Her serum alaum concentnrion was 5.2 mg per ddtu (1.3 mmol per liter), and her semm fluoride conccnmrion was 9.1 mg per liter (480 pmol per bur) (the normal hang serum fluoride concenmdon in per- sons using drinking water connining 1 mg of fluoride per liter is 0.01 lo 0.03 mg per Liter 10.5 to 1.6 pmol per Liter]). She recovered without apparent requclae. On Yay 23, after 24 hours of inacm- ble vorniring. a 41-yeu-old man was found dad at home. He had attempted to remain hydrated by drinking an adm~ted 10 liten of water from water system I on .May 21 and 22. His only known medid problem was peptic ulca die. for which he took cimcu- dine. The portmoreem serum daum conccnmaon was 4.9 mg per ddter (1.22 mmol per Liter). md the urinary fluoride concentra- don (not corrected for crr~dnine content) was 55 mg per liter (2900 -pmo1 per liter).

On July 11 the bill barely made it through the senate health committee Wen Senator Tim Leslie's arm was twisted to vote yes, and A8733 was on it's merry way to senate appropriations when samettiing happened prompting Jackie Speier to pull the bill: LEGlSLATIVE LIABILITV.

It was two words whispered to a senator: -PERSONAL UABt~: Elected officials can be held liable for their actions when it affects the health and wetfare of individuals, and water fluoridation is one of those issues. The inuendo of \"personal li8biIv killed the momentum and brought AB7 33 to an abrupt halt. In 1994, the spector of personal liability killed the same fluoridation bill in Pennsylvania. The water districts complained about the possibility of being sued by consumers at risk from ingesting fluoridated water. Another aspect that came into the Pennsylvania scenario was the fad that as of 1989 fluoride was declassifed as an essential nutrient and again became an unapproved new pencription drug by the US Food and Drug Administration. Fluoride's new status placed the water districts in further jeopardy of tort litigation for dispensing a prescription drug (a prescription is required to purchase' fluwide). Upon being confronted with these facts, the authors of the Pennsylvania bill proceded to confer with attorneys and create an immunity clause to protect the water districts. It seems thet by creating an immunity clause. the legislatars accepted any and all personal end criminal liebility. The action became what is know as an intentional tort. me Pennsylvania fluoridation bill died a quiet death in committee, 1 994."},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Today, Jackie Speier faces even mwm insurmountable problems. All of the research and statistical data on artificial fluoridation is invalid. The ctinical research performed regarding the health effects of fluoride is executed with a phafKIa~e~ti~al grade of sodium fluoride, and the statisticial research data is acquired from naturally fluoridated areas. Neither the clinical nor statisticial research take into account the grades and types of fluoride used for water fluoridation which are the toxic waste byproducts of phosphate fertlizer manufacturing and aluminum smelting operations. The industrial grade fluoridation agents contain many contaminates which are also toxic fluorides: 1)LEAD FLUORIDE, 2) ARSENIC FLUORIDE,' 3) MERCURY FLUORIDE, 4) CADMIUM FLUROIDE, 5) URNAIUM FLUORIDE, 6) ALUMINUM FLUORIDE, ECT. while the pharmaceutical grades are all but free of these contaminates. The magnesium and calcium fluorides that are common to naturally fluoridated water are 20-25 times less toxic than manufactured fluorides. Jackie Speier is aware of these facts as well as all the senators on the senate health committee and Govenor Pete Wilson. However, Speier is conferring with the attorneys at the Oflice of Legislative Council to find a way to circufnvent tort law and get A8733 passed. However, more problems lay down the road: FEDERAL LAWS. The law regulating the use of toxic substances, The Toxic Substances Control Ad, 1976 states that the manufacturers of chemical compounds, must provide research data proving that Umir products are safe to the environment and to humans. Not om manufacturer of industrial grade fluoridation agents can make any such claim. Another fector about artificial fluorides that hasn't been addressed in the courts and the legislative mmittees is: The addition of fluoride violates the Safe Drinking Water Ad. The Sa* Drinking Water Act prohibits the hderal gowmment horn mandating floridahon. The US Environmental Protection agency only regulates the amount of the fluorides' Maximum Contaminate Leves (MCL) at 4 parts per million in drinking wetor. Wm fluaridation, the state assumes ell tort rsspmsibility. Water n~oridati~ is not a health issue. Dental carries are not an health issue. The reasons gtven for fluoridating the drinking water are that paor children cannot afford fluoride treetmetnts. To ened every small portion of the population, the 1 Califorina State Legislatun, is willing to spend millions of dollars orit of the General ~ I Fund to fluwidate the states' drinking water when the endeavor will waste 99.99% of the money allocaed because most of the fluoride goes down the drain. One 8.5 or 1 tub of fluoride toothpaste mntains enough fluoride to supply s child under sir yesn old for almost three years, children six yean and older for 1.5 years. What is water fluoridation about? Steve Speigle, USEPA attorney, said, \"me EPA emugages industries to find markets Ibr their recovered pollutants.

Tudor Oevies, in a 1995 letter to the author stated, \" In the United States, there are no Federal standards applicable to additives, including those intended for wster fluoridation.\" In 1988, the €PA relinquished control wer water treatment chemicals to a non-profit corporation, National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), to establish voluntary praducl standards.

It would appear that a conflict of interest exists. Another equally troubling conflict of interest is that the Federal Gavemment supplies grants up to $100,000.00 for comrnunites to nuoridate water supplies while fluoridation is a violation of the Sa& Drinking Water Ad & Toxic Substams Contrd Ad. As the lawyers at the Office of Legislative Council for the California State Legislature bum the midnight oil in an attempt to pawn the liability onto some unsuspeding state agency, in the name of public health, another more omnious cloud threatens the state and the legislators' cotfures: TOXC TORT mAmh/. There are a myriad of health problems associated with weter fluoridation and fluorides in general: Hip fractures in post menopausal women, stress fractures, dental fluorosis. osteasamma ( fatal form of bone cancer that occurs in young males) and people with diabetes and kidney ailments should not drink fluoridated water. As far back as 1984, the Journal of Legal Research recognized the potential for TOXIC TORT UTIGATKIN, and in Volume 7, Issue 5, they published a short article stating: \"Despite the salutory effect in teeth protection and bone treatment, it is 'increasingly suspeded that chronic fluoride intake, even at low lwels can cause health problems. This will undoubtedly result in clients showing up in law H~ces who he been diagnosed with some ailment due to fluoride intoxication Toxic tort researchers should be aware of this and develop6 intewiew tools for their firms which will help pinpoint the source of the causitivs fluoride.. . . \" Today, fluoride rematch has opened me doors to toxic tort litigation: 1) Neural toxbty, 2) tho inmesing prevalence of dental Iluomsis m both nuorkfated and non-nunidated smes, 3) osteosames, end 4) hip and stress hdvms. Fluoride is also associated with infertility in animal end human studies. A 1994 FDA statistiil study (Exposum to High FluoMe Comntrations in Drinking Water is assoc~ated Wh Demased BiRn Rates, Stan C.

Alcoa immedietely warned the Aborigines to move; they apparently could not wait for a negotiated settlement. The Abom that did not move were arrested. A week earlier, on 4 December. five conservationists had been arrested as they tried to stop bulldozers from clearing nearby heathlands. These arrests marked the culmination of a four-month conflict pitting Aborigines and conservationists against Alcoa and the state and national governments in Victoria. The dispute centered on Alcoa's plans to build. near the town of Portland. Victoria. one of tha world's largest duminum smelters. with an annual capacity of 530.000 tom of aluminum by 1988. Alcoa pmposed to locate the smelter in an area of wetlands and heath which included sacmi lands and ercheeological sites of historical and cultural importance to the Aborigines. ?be smelter would also threaten the ecology of the neighboring wetlands and coast. endangering several species of rare animals and . plants. including a unique variety of spider orchid. Wially. two sites were under consideration. The western site was an area of clearad grazing land; the eastern one was part of a stretch of heathland bordering Portland Bay (see map). The eastern site, favd by Alcoa and eventually approved by the Victoria gover- nment. appears to be socially and environmantally the less acceptable choice. The Ministry for Conservation's preliminary en- vironmental assessment of the project was based on 124 statements submitted by government departments. conservation groups. and individuals regarding the smelter site. One hundred and nineteen submissions opposed the eastern site chosen by Alcoa. Among those organizations disagreeing with Alcoa were the Ministry for Conservation's enviro~lental studies division. the National Parks Service. the Department of Crown Lands and Swey, the Victoria Archaeological Survey and the %yal Botanic Gardens and National Herbarium. Reflecting these views. the h4iuistry's preliminary essessment concluded that, in order \"to protect the scenic value of the coastline. and to retain a major pert of the heathland. the smelter should be on the western location.\" lhis mcoxpmendation. however. was reversed in the publidled en-te1 msessmmt. While tbe . . peekmrnary report indicated that the two sites would offer no substantial difference in air dsions or their effect on Portland. the published report. relying on un- specifid \"new\" information. irdicated that the western site would have a more adverse effect than the eastern om. What this effect is. or the extent of the Memm between the two sites. was unstated. The Crown Lands Department's submission offered a ume likely ex- planation, calling the plblished report an attempt \"to justify an apparent prior decision to construct the smelter on the eastern site rather than effectively examining all the propods to reach a logical dacision on the ap mte location.\" Anothm posaib1~ explanation is that ladnmbg inteT%4ts. dismayed by the impending precedent. lobbied against the loss of even 400 hectares of grazing land. Aborigines regard the heathlands of the eastern site as sacred lands. Numerous sites contain Aboriginal relics. including a rare shell midden. and an apparent chert-tool \"factory\". The Aborigines use these relics and sites when teaching traditional culture to their children. Under Victoria law. disturbing a relic violates the Archaeological and Aborigipal Relics Preservation Act of 1972. However, attempts by Aborigines to block con- struction in the heathland area through the courts were unsuccessful. Hop~ng to satisfy the Aborigines and their supporters. Alcoa offered to build a museum to house any artifacts or relics turned up during the construction process. This offer was bitterly rejected by the Aborigines, who claimed 'ht a museum is e warehouse for curiosities from the past. and to put these relics in one would be to deny them their place in contemporary Aboriginal culture. While. the legal battles continued, a small gmp of Aborigines set up a camp on a madway in the Alcoa site. From that point they could observe and hinder attempts by Alcoa and its contrectors to develop the site on the heethland. The camp also served as a reminder of the Aborigines' traditional attachment to that land. At first. the Alcoa officials or police could not expel or arrest the protestors. as the road wes technically Crown land and thus open to Aborigines. The Aborigmes were able to prevent grading of the road by lying in front of the grader's wheels. but at the same time Alcoa officials were buming off part of the heethland to facilitate construction. Once Alma obtained legal right to the mad. the arrasts quickly followed. The Australian government's willingness to create optimum conditions for the development of new large acale industries is reflected in the situation at Portland. First. they apparently ignored the Archaeological and Aboriginal Relics Preservation Act of 1972. Second. they classified the smelter as a \"new business\" rather than as a mining venture. thereby allowing Alcoa to avoid the legal requirement of W/a Australian ownership in mines. A \"new business in the manufacturing sector.\" as the smelter is officially classified. requires only the minimum Australian involvement \"appropriate to the dr- cumstances.\" TO make sure this minimum was met, the Australian government agreed to consider Alcoa as 4910 Australian-kd [due tithe stakes held in the company by the Western Mining Corporation and other in- stitutional investors). ALCOA'S SMELTER SITE"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Finally. they reversed the recommendation of the environmental effects assessment. and were generally lenimt with Alcoe on the issue of environmental quality. ~oving the smelter does not alleviate its adverse effects: they are simply shifted from one area to another. The government's legitimate concern with the air quality of Portland is offset by their lack of concern for the smelter's effects on the heathland. As the smelter is currently planned. Alcoa could not build it in the United States. for two reasons. First. it would be too close (1.5 km) to the nearest house: in the US. the minimum distance is 2 km. Second. the quality of the emissions from the smelter would be unacceptable. Alcoa has proposed emissions as high as 1.3 kg of fluoride per ton of aluminum produced: the US limit is 1 kg per ton of aluminum. The Hunter Valley smelter being built in Australia will be limited to 0.76 kg/ton. and while some US smelters release as little as 0.52 @/ton, most are below 0.8 kglton. The Australia and Victorian governments' concern with the air quality at Portland could be satisfied by imposing standards which are more strict than those currently proposed. Acceptance of Hunter Valley's 0.76 @/ton limit as a national standard wouid prevent the creation of \"pockets of pollution\" in areas with less stringent requirements. If Uus were done. then locating the Portland smelter on the western site, off of the heathland and over 2 km from the nearest house. would be the logical step. This would not only protect the Aboriginal sacred sites, but also preserve the rare animal and plant species of the heathland. A larger buffer zone could be established around the smelter. thereby con- taining the most severe effects. However. by permitting Alcoe to control emission effects by locating the plant on the eastern site rather than using expensive technology to purify the emissions. the Australian government has allowed the degradation of other parts of the environment of biological and cultural importance. Since the arrests of 10 December. various unions working at the Alcoe smelter site have considered taking action to show their displeasure with the company's treatment of the Aborigines. Concerned with the parallels between the activities at Portland and those at Noonkanbah in Western Australia in early 1980. the union officials are worried that the Australian govern- ment is making a standard practice of siding with ex- tractive industries when they conflict with the interests of Aboriginal groups. The unions appear determined to prevent this. The situation at the Portland site has also prompted the formation of the Southeast Land Council. a group corn- posd of 15 representatives from tribes in Victoria and parts of South Australia. New South Wales. and the Australian Capital Territory. ?he events et Portland, when seen in the context of recent events at Noonkanbah and at the uranium mines in the Northern Territory. do not bode well for the Aborigines. While Awtralie has long been known to have huge mineral reserves. their exploitation until recently has not been economically feasibl. W~th the increase in world demand for these minerals. however. their ex- ploitation is sure to increase. Many of these minerals are on Aboriginal lands. In light of the recent agreements made by the Australian government to encourage the rapid exploitation of these minerals. their consideration of the interests of the Aborigines appears minimal. at best. In the past. Rime Minister Fraser. the Portland area representative in the House of Representatives. has been sensitive to nationel and international criticism of Australia's Aboriginal policies. The union's admirable concern coupled with the increased organization of the Aborigines, evident in the burgeoning Land Council movement, can begin to stimulate internal criticism. International pressure, however. can only be brought to bear 'if the state of the Aborigines is publicized. The situation at Portland is far from ideal for the Aborigines. and it could well be repeated at other sites throughout Australia. Apparently. only signihzant amounts of pressure. both from within Australia and around the world. can prevent this.

An additional 9 million people in 1,869 communities are using water with naturally occurring fluoride Bt levels, of 0.7 parts per million or higher. Therefore, 44 years after the first water eyetem was fluoridated, more than 55 percent of the Nation's population has access to water with a dentally significant concentration of fluoride. Adjusted fluoridation is the conscious maintenance of the optimal fluoride concentration in the water supply for reducing dental caries and minimizing the risk of dental fluorosis. The optimal concentration may be accompliehed by adding fluoride chemicals to fluoride deficient water; by blending two or more sources of water naturally containing fluoride to achieve the opt-1 concentration; or partial defluoridation, that is, removing naturally occurring exceseive fluorides 'to obtain the recornmended level. Water eysteme are considered to have optimal level of natural fluoride if they contain naturally occurring fluoride at or above the minimum recommended control range. Water eyetems and cornmunities with optimally adjusted fluoride and naturally occurring fluoride in water are listed in this publication. Adjusted water syeteme are fluoridated at the optimal level according to the average maximum daily air temperature in the community. (Recommended concentrations, according to National Interim Primary Drinking Water Regulations, 1975, are ehown in Table A.) Although the term \"natural fluoridation\" has no particular scientific or official connotation, it has been used in this publication for the sake of eimplification.

They were requested to uppate, change, and verify the information presented and to include new fluoridation installations while deleting those that were inappropriate. A request was made to update the population figures to reflect 1992 census estimates. This information was then submitted for the Fluoridation Census 1992: States were asked to report each fluoridated water system and the communities each system served; the status of fluoridation, adjusted, consecutive, or natural; the system from which water was purchased, if consecutive; the popu-lation receiving fluoridated water; the date on which fluoridation started; and the chemical used for fluoridation, if adjusted. The updated information was returned to CDC where a master file was created to incorporate the new format and to reflect changes made in the previous data provided by etate health officials. The states were informed that unless they made specific changes in their state's printout, the data on the existing printout would be used in the publication of the Fluoridation Census 1992 Summary. In essence, this publication is a report of the status of fluoridation made by the states, and the data herewith reported have been provided by the individual states.

However, typhoid is most rampant under overcrowded and unhealthy conditions. Today, the fact that chlorine is added to public drinking water has proven to be a Pandora's Box full of chemical consequences for the unsuspecting population. The use of chlorine compounds, especially organochlorines and chlorinated hydrocarbons, has proven to be a toxic legacy relative to human physiology and the nervous system. The February 1992 EPA Proposal for a Ban on Water Chlorination In a February 1992 proposal for the Clean Water Act, the EPA \"recommended examining chlorine's impact on health and the environment, allegedly \"with the possible goal of banning or restricting its use.\" The EPA \"proposed\" a $2 million one-year chlorine study that would look at the effects of chlorine and chlorine compounds in the manufacture of paper, solvents and plastics, as well as in disinfecting waste water and public drinking water.' Of course, dioxin and TCDD (See Chapter on Herbicides) are chlorinated compounds, and they continue to cause neurological damage to the population. There are no apparent plans to halt mass spraying of pesticides and herbicides, so any EPA proposal to study anything to do with chlorinated compounds will fall on deaf ears and is, in effect, a moot point. The July 1992 Statistical Meta-Analysis of Chlorinated Water and Cancer A statistical analysis in 1992 indicated that people who drink chlorinated water run a 2 1 % greater risk of bladder cancer and a 38% greater risk of rectal cancer than people to &ink water with little or no chlorine2. According to investigators, something in chlorinated water may act as a carcinogen. Robert D. Moms, who directed the study at the Medical College of Wisconsii in Milwaukee, says \"I am convinced, based on this study, that there is an association between cancer and chlorinated water.\" Morris indicated that previous studies may have lacked the statistical power to find a connection between the presence of chlorine and degenerative disease in humans. The study used a formidable statistical method called meta-analysis. They began their inquiry by using a computer to comb the medical literature for studies on chlorinated water and cancer. Their search turned up 22 studies, but only 10 met quality standards. The meta-analysis method allowed Moms' group to pool the data fiom the 10 studies, far surpassing the statistical power of any single study. The analysis turned up a significantly increased risk of developing rectal and bladder cancer for people who drank chlorinated water - a risk that went up as the dose increased. Research indicates that at least 4,200 1 Science, Vol 147, Feb 12, 1994, p. 11 1.

Scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency also indicate a connection. According to Fred Hauchman at the EPA Health Effects Laboratory in Research Triangle park4, North Carolina, \"we recognize that there could be an association between exposure to chlorination by-products and cancer.\" The reaction between chlorine and organic matter forms trihalomethanes (THM' s) . 1993 National Cancer Institute Studies on Chlorinated Water and Cancer In experiments with rodents, food containing trihalomethanes produced not only liver and kidney toxicity, but also unusually high rates of ~ancer.~ The important thing to remember is that rodents have a higher resistance to toxins than do humans, and this fact only underscores the problem with chlorines in drinking water relative to humans. The NCI study tested hundreds of mice and rats, giving them water containing chlorine, chloramine, chloroform, chlorodibromomethane, and bromodichloromethane (THM7s). Tumors of the kidney and colon normally occw in fewer than 1% of the rat population. The new research showed that 25-33% of the rats treated with chloroform, bromoform or bromodichloromethane developed kidney cancer. Between 25-90% of the rats fed one of those three THM's also developed precancerous and malignant colorectal tumors. According to Robert Morris, \"This study provides some of the clearest evidence yet of water chlorination 's carcinogeniciv, particularly its colorectal carcinogeniciv.\" In addition, Moms indicated that trihalomethanes may not be the only cancer- causing substances formed, since only about 50% of chlorination's by-products have so far been identiped. According to Stephen W. Clark of the EPA Office of Drinking Water Standards in Washington, D.C. in 1993, the NCI data \"would probably influence the new rules for trihalomethanes in drinking water being negotiated by EPA, industry and environmental leaders.\" It obviously didn't. In 1995, Congress proposed relaxing water and air pollution standards, bowing to industry pressure. The EPA is powerless and can only stand by and make unenforceable \"recommendations\", if it says anything at all.

The chlorine industry hnded a study of the adverse effects of chlorine compounds. That fact itself invalidates the study, since it represents a conflict of interest, but the 1,050 page study was issued as a \"supplement\" to the August 1994 issue to Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, and indicated \"the alarms about chlorine- containing compounds are unwarranted.\" This stance did not impress the Society on Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, who called for restricting and banning chlorinated chemicals \"that are highly toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative.\" Of course, dioxins, some pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls fit that description. The Canadian Government announced on October 25, 1994 that Canada would \"take aggressive action in dealing with chlorinated substances that pose a threat to health and the environment, beginning by eliminating the most hdl chlorinated substances.\" The United States continues to ignore the scientific facts, as curbing use of chlorinated compounds would cost the industry billions in revenue. The health of the population is not the issue. New Proposals to Add Botb Chlorine and Ammonia to Drinking Water Despite the evidence that chlorine reactivity with organic matter in water creates carcinogenic by-products, there is evidence that researchers are studying a new method of disinfecting water called chlorarnination, which a& both chlorine and ammonia to water. According to Robert Moms, \"chloramination may prove safer that simple chlorination because it yields yields fewer dangerous by-products.\" However, there is absolutely no scientific evidence that that could ever be the case. Adding chlorine and ammonia to water will still produce a reaction between chlorine and organic matter, and it will create ammonium chloride, the effect of which on human physiology is unknown on a long-term basis.

This scenario is coming true, for increasingly large areas of the United States are marked by a distinctive absence of songbirds. Pesticides are very concentrated chemicals which are intentionally designed to kill lifeforms. Some of them, like phosgene and Zyklon-B, were also used to dispatch humans. Phosgene is used today to produce chemical herbicides. Many of todays pesticides, like malathion (which was recently sprayed over population areas in California to allegedly rid the area of the medfly) and parathion are members of the nerve gas family. So lethal is parathion that a dose of 0.00424 oz will paralyze you and kill you before you could take an antidote. Many of the pesticides, especially the chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides PDT, Aldrin, Kepone, Dieldrin, Chlordane, Hepachlor, Endrin, Mirex, PCB, Toxaphene, Lindane, etc) are extremely stable compounds that do not break down for decades, and in some cases for hundreds of years. Chemicals that are banned in the United States are routinely sold to Third World countries and return in the food exported back to the United States. Not surprisingly, banned drugs are also exported to Third World countries, while at the same time drugs that are promising in other countries are banned in the United States. The nature of pesticides is such that at each successive stage up the food chain, the toxic concentration is increased. Factory farm animals build up especially high concentrations of chemical toxins for several reasons. They are fed great quantities of fish meal, feed is grown on land laced with pesticides, and they are intentionally dipped in, sprayed with, and fed many toxic compounds never encountered by animals raised in a natural environment. Most toxic substances are retained in the tissue of the animal that is consumed by humans, who are at the top of the food chain. The Environmental Protection Agency routinely publishes the Pesticides Monitoring Journal, and in 1969 the Journal reported that \"foods of animal origin are the major source of pesticide residues in the human diet.\" Studies indicate that of all the toxic chemicals in the American diet, more than 95% come from meat, fish, eggs and dairy products. The choice is yours. Since the production and use of these chemicals is quite profitable for all concerned, despite the effect on human beings, millions of pounds continue to be produced each year. Public concern in the 1970's forced the passage of the Toxic Substances Control Act, but the agency responsible for ordering tests for the 50,000 toxic substances on the market that can enter the human system have not done too much toward enforcing the act.

Is this another example of willhll criminal intent and negligence? Yes. Government Fraud, Deception, Deceit and criminal Negligence Relative to Pesticides The philosophy espoused by the Reagan-Bush administration (and continued today in the current administration, is to let the fox guard the henhouse - let the industry police itself, and the industry promotes the idea that \"all dangerous chemicals have been banned\" and \"the resurgence of deadly diseases spread by insects is because some pesticides were prematurely banned.\" An excellent example of flawed logic, tempered with no scientific information, dependent on public ignorance of the situation. It is also another example of willfbll criminal intent and negligence, fraud, deception and deceit. It is the result of criminal policies like this that prompted Lewis Regenstein to write How To Survive America the Poisoned, where he states that virtually no chemicals have been banned in all their applications by the government. DDT, having a life of hundreds of years, continues to be found in aquatic life - even at the North Pole. Dieldrin in Food TT;he chemical Dieldrin is five times more poisonous than DDT when swallowed and 40 times more poisonous when absorbed through the skin, but by the time it was finally banned in 1974, the FDA found Dieldrin in 96% of all the meat, fish andpoultry in the United States. mey also found it in 85% of all dairy products and in the flesh of 99.5% of the American people they checked. Dieldrin is also one of the most potent carcinogens ever known. In humans, low levels of exposure cause convulsions, severe liver damage, and rapid destruction of the central nervous system. After a World Health Organization (TWO) anti-malerial program committed the pre-meditated criminal act of using Dieldrin, workers began foaming at the mouth, went into convulsions and died. Others who were only minimally exposed suffered convulsions for months. While Dieldrin is not (as far as we know) applied any more to the soils on which livestock feed is grown, it still exists in that soil due to previous application, so Americans ' Barringer, F.,\"Thirty More Regulations Targeted for Review\", Washington Post, Aug 13, 1981, pg A-27 Brown, M., \"Reagan Wants to Ax Product Safety Agency\", Washington Post, h4ay 10, 1981 \"Stockman moves to Kill Consumer Safety Panel\".

Dioxin in Food Everyone has probably heard of Dioxin, a component of Agent Orange, because of the apparent health effects experienced by people who were in Southeast Asia during the time period when it was used, as well as the effects on their children. The effects of Dioxin manifest themselves in many ways, including birth defects in children born to those exposed. Birth defects include missing bones, twisted limbs, holes in the heart, deformed intestines, partial spinal chords, shrunken fingers, brain damage, and missing rectum. Incredibly, the two active ingredients of Dioxin (24-D and 245-T) are spruyed today (1993) on land used to grow food for livestock. According to Dr. Diane Courtney, head of the Toxic Effects Branch of the EPA National Research Center, Dioxin is \"by far the most toxic chemical lcnown to mankind.\" She also testified that Dioxin is present in beef and dairy products from cattle that have grazed on land treated with (245-T). Despite the scientific proof, Dow Chemical Company, manufacturer of the chemical, maintains that Dioxin is \"about as toxic as aspirin\". Birth defects have been noted at Dioxin concen- trations as low as one part per trillion. It is also carcinogenic, but it usually kills the host before tumors appear. There were some 40,000 deformed children fathered by men exposed to Agent Orange in Southeast Asia. The Dow Chemical Company claim that Dioxin is harmless is rWy ludicrous. From 1965 to 1968, 70 prisoners, mostly black, at the Homlesburg State Prison in Philadelphia, were the subject of test by Dow Chemical Company of the effects of Dioxin. Their skin was exposed deliberately to Dioxin and they were then monitored in order to observe the results. Almost a parallel to the Tuskegee study, the subjects developed lesions which, according to Dr.Albert Kligman, the doctor in charge at the University of Pennsylvania, lasted for four to seven months and remained untreated. It was the second such experiment conducted by Dow Chemical - the previous one was carried out on 51 prisoners - a captive audience. Obviously, Dow Chemical Company is guilty of criminal conduct and crimes against humanity. Highland, J.,\"Corporate Cancer,\" Environmental Defense Fund, Washington, D.C.

To kill a million people would take about one fluid ounce. The fact that Dioxin itself is not a defoliant, and the fact that it was added to Agent Orange, constitutes a criminal act of chemical warfare and an attempt at contributory genocide on the part of the user to work on \"the population problem.\" It was 1961 when Operation Ranchhand commenced in Vietnam, and from 196 1 to about 1 964, Agents Orange, Blue, Pink, White, and Green were sprayed from the area of the Mekong Delta near Saigon all the way up to the DMZ. It is interesting that during the Vietnam war, Pentagon people were busy doing research on blood types of Asian groups. They were no doubt in the process of developing chemical ethnic weapons, designed to take out certain people in the quest for world domination and the decimation of the human population. In the November 1970 issue of Military Review, geneticist Carl Larson pointed out the possibility of designing chemicals to attack specific populations. Larson felt that observed variations in drug response pointed to the possibility of great innate differences in vulnerability to chemical agents between different populations. The British also used it over Malaya. In 1966 Assistant Secretary of Defense Dixon Donnelley, in a letter sent in behalf of President Johnson to twelve physiologists protesting the use of Agent Orange (laced with Dioxin), stated that Agent Orange and similar chemicals were used extensively in most countries of both the Free World and the Communist Bloc, and that \"they are not hdl to people, animals, soil or water.\" It was an outright lie within twenty years, Vietnam veterans managed to win a settlement fiom Dow Chemical and other companies for extensive physical damage they had incurred fiom their exposure to Dioxin, a byproduct of Agent Orange. Since Dioxin has severe effects on the human immune system, it is certain that some of these effects are being categorized as \"AIDS\" symptoms in order to artificially raise the number of \"AIDS cases\" to just* increased Wig and huge profits for pharmaceutical companies, who look for the \"cure\".

Heptachlor is carcinogenic at the lowest levels tested (lppm) in laboratory experiments.\" Hearings began in November 1974, and Velsicol spend tens of millions of dollars on legal maneuvers in the end, several company officials were indicted by a federal grand jury. Heptachlor is still used today in many applications, and continues to poison humans6 Again, during the Reagan-Bush administration, the Department of Agriculture discovered that, as part of its school lunch program, it had sent 40 thousand pounds of Heptachlor contaminated ground pork to school systems in Louisiana and Arkansas. By the time they had realized this, over 14 thousand pounds had already been consumed by the children.' Tests to determine the existence of these substances in food are very expensive and are rarely performed. In April 1986, inilk contaminated with high levels of Heptachlor had to be recalled in Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. Also in April 1986, beef supplied by the U.S.D.A to California elementary and high schools had to be recalled because of Heptachlor contamination. In December 1986, Banquet Foods admitted that a total of 200,000 chickens had to be destroyed in Arkansas because they were found to be contaminated by Chlordane, a derivative of Hepta'chlor. Arkansas authorities also found Heptachlor contamination in the breast milk of 70% of nursing mothers examined.

In 1976, it was determined that Michigan residents ate over 5 million pounds of hamburger contaminated with PBBs. The PBBs \"somehow\" became mixed in with livestock feed which was dispersed throughout the state.

Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) in Food Like its sister chemical PBB, PCBs have an extended biological longevity. More than 1,000,000 tons of polychlorinated biphenyls have been produced in the United States. PCBs have been found in significant concentrations in remote parts of the planet and in the deepest and most remote parts of the ocean. A few parts per billion can cause birth defects and cancer in animals. Primates have developed fatal cancers and give birth to deformed babies after ingesting doses as low as one part per million. It's in the food that people eat.g Sterilizing the Population With PCB's A recent government stu& found PCB's present in 100% of the sperm samples tested They also found a correlation between high PCB levels and low sperm count. PCB's are considered one of the chief reasons for the staggering fact that the average sperm count of the American male today is only 70% of what it was 30 years ago. Tests done at several major universities have found that nearly 25% of toaizys college students are sterile. Only 35 years ago, the sterility rate was less than 0.5 percent (one half of 1 percent). PCBs were first introduced by Monsanto Company. Three years after production began, the faces and bodies of 23 out of 24 workers in the plant had become disfigured. Since then, more than 750,000 tons of these poisons have been produced. They can be found today in every body of water in the United States, in the snows on both poles, and in tissues of all life in the ocean. Fish, by EPA estimate, can accumulate up to 9 million times the level of PCBs in the waters in which they live. Livestock in todays factory farms are fed huge quantities of fish meal. Half of the world'sfish are fed to livestock, who then pass on the PCBs, along with all the other toxins, to human beings.''

Because of its heavy use, Dichlorvos ends up on the cattle, and thus enters the meat supply humans consume. Common sprays having Dichlorvos as a main ingredient are Fly-Die, Duo-Kill, and Vapona, as well as a host of other products.

Since detection of toxic chemicals requires complex laboratory equipment and a great deal of time and expense, not much is actually done.

'* A Human Breast Milk Analysis A nursing mothers body draws on the fat reservoirs of the body to make milk, and stored in those same fat reservoirs are virtually all of the toxic chemicals she has ever ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through her skin. The EPA has concluded that American breast fed infants ingest nine times the permissible level of Dieldrin and ten times the maximum allowable level of PCB. In 1981, the breast milk of 1,000 Michigan nursing mothers was tested, and residues of chemicals so toxic that they cause birth defects were found. The less a women eats meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products, the less concentration of undesirable chemicals will be in her milk. The 1976 EPA analysis of vegetarian mothers found levels of chemicals to be far less than average. Mothers milk has more advantages for the infant than not, especially if it is relatively chemical fiee. The milk of a vegetarian mother contains only 1-2% of the contamination of non-vegetarian mothers. Estrogenic Chemicals: An Introduction In 1962, Rachel Carlson wrote, 'We know that even single exposures to [these chemicals], if the amount is large enough, can precipitate. acute poisoning. But this is not the major problem. For the population as a whole, we must be more concerned with the delayed eflects of absorbing small amounts of the pesticides that invisibly contaminate our world.\" Today, delayed effects of absorbing small amounts of what are called estro~enic com~ounds are \"coming home to roost.\" In 1991, an international group of scientists met at Wingspread in Racine, Wisconsin, to discuss the effects of DDT and other organochlorine compounds on sexual development in wildlife. Their concern was precipitated by increasing numbers of birds, fish, shellfish and mammals with sexual abnormalities, including decreased fertility and hatching success, gross birth deformities, metabololic and behavioral abnormalities, demasulinization of males, defiminization of females (female to female pairing and males with female .sex organs), and compromised immune systems.

Hormones are produced by the endocrine system, which consists of cells, tissues and organs that create and secreate organic chemicals, hormones, that regulate other kin& of cells and systemic processes in the body. Cells affected by particular hormones contain receptors for those hormones - the sort of 'lock and key\" concept you might have heard of in discussions about neurotransmitters and the brain. A small amount of hormone attaches itself to a receptor site, triggering major chemical changes in tissues, organs and the body as a whole. The endocrine system itself, for females, is responsible for starting the menstrual cycle. It regulates cell division and organ dzflerentiation in the developing fetus. In birds, it has the additional fbnction of regulating the pattern and timing of migration. In mammals, it has the additional fbnction of regulating hibernation. The abenal gland, pancreas, thyroid, pituitary, ovaries and testicles are examples of endocrine glands in humans. Estrogenic compounds mimic sexual hormones, chiefly estrogen, and thus interfere with normal development of individuals exposed before, or shortly ajler, birth. Abnormalities are most often found in the offspring of exposed adults rather than the adult itself, although the increase in environmentally caused cancers, tumors and brain diseases are a clue that something is going on. Because the allopathic medical system denies environmental effect and tries to direct liabiity for physiological problems toward 'Viruses\" or 'kenetic predisposition\" in order to deflect public attention from corporate accountability, it is sure that they see the writing on the wall. Note the trend in 1995 to formulate national legislation to limit damage awards for corporate bungling. In humans, the effect of apparent exposure might not be apparent for years. While some abnormalities are obvious at birth, other problems caused by environmental chemicals do not surface until later in life. In order to escape liability and accountability, corporate capitalism tends to deny the existence of long term or cumulative effects, and this is apparent throughout all of the paradims discussed in Matrix III. A simple example of a delayed effect is seen in the daughters and sons of mothers who were given DES by the allopathic medical system, who suffer from increases rates of cancer and abnormalities of the reproductive system. As an aside, all of this might be considered 'hn accident\" - that corporations and world power structures were not aware of the capabilities of these substances. I maintain that research indicates that they were aware of the effect of these substances, early on, and that dssemination of environmental chemicals was deliberately not curtailed in order to prohuce the effect it is havrng on the population.

While the 'Wingspread Statement\" focused on animals and speculated that similar harm could come to humans, a report released in April 1995 says that male reproductive health is deteriorating in many countries, and the most likely culprit is exposure to low levels of industrial chemicals present in food, water, air and many consumer products; most cosmetics, pehmes and aftershaves contain neurotoxic substances. The report, entitled 'Male Reproductive Health and Environmental Chemicals With Estrogenic Effects': was conducted by the Danish equivalent of the EPA in Copenhagen. It says, 'it is now evident that several aspects of male reproductive health have changed for the worse over the past 30-50 years.\"It cites a striking decline in speann counts, increased incidence of testicular cancer (now the most common cancer among young men in many countries), a rise in hypospadias (malformation of the sex organs), and a trend toward increasing incidence of undescended testicles. The incidence in these disorders originated 20 to 40 years ago - when Rachel Carson was busy writing Silent Spring. Dioxin, which we have already covered briefly and will cover in more detail later, is estrogenic and has been linked to endometriosis in women (a painfbl condition in which tissue which lines the uterus (endometrium) become attached to other pelvic organs. DDT has been linked to breast cancer, and PCBs (also estrogenic) have been linked to endometriosis in women and diminished penis size in men. As might be expected, the U.S. Chemical Manufacturers Association fhded a report disputing the Danish study, claiming the 'industrial estrogenic chemicals do not plausibly contribute to an increased incidence of breast cancer in women and male reproductive problems.\" Of course, they are lying to protect themselves, for the litigation would wipe out the whole industry if the public as a whole realized the truth and acted on it. Consumer Products as a Source for Estrogenic Chemicals The Danish Report identifies many consumer products as possible sources of estrogenic chemicals, including pesticides, detergents, cosmetics, paints, and plastic packaging materials, including food wraps. Some specific chemicals to watch out for include many of the 109 types of PCBs, dioxins, furam, alkylphenols (the breakdown products of alkylphenol polyethoxylates, which are widely used in cosmetics, detergents, herbicides and paints), herbicides (2-4-D, alachlor, amitrole, atrazine, metribuzin and triflwalin), fungicides, malathion, and many chemicals found in plastics. Regarding the latter, the Danish report states, \"Phthalates, used to make plastics flexible, are the most abundant man-made environmental pollutant^'^ , and human intake per day via various routes is measured in tens of milligrams.\" Some plastics contain up to 40% phthalate esters by weight, which leach out over time.

Phthalates activate receptors for estrogen, the primary female hormone. Many enivironmental pollutants subsequently bind to estrogen receptors. The common food additive BHA\", butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) appear to be both estrogenic and carcinogentic, and in a 1994 British study16 it was shown that these substances stimulated the growth of breast cancer cells in culture1', conclusions also backed up by studies in the United States and spain'*. The chemical bisphenol-A (BPA), present in polycarbonate flasks and beakers used in labs, also mimics estrogen. BPA plastics are used in many molded consumer products, incluing tubing, prosthetic devices, and appliances. Manufacturers in the United States have the capacity to make more than 1 billion pounds of BPA annually. According to an article in Science ~ews'~, polycarbonate manufacturers are aware of their products potential to shed BPA. Manufacturer's consider a concentration of 10 parts per billion (ppb) to be safe, however research has established that BPA exhibits hormonal activity at concentrations of just 2ppb to 5ppb20. This has been interpreted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences as suggesting that estrogenic eflects can occur in the absence of confinnation by chemical analytical methd - at concentrations that are below analytical measurement2' . The phthalate DBP serves as dispersing agent in some insect repellents, and appears in plastic piping and food wraps. The British team in 1994 headed by Susan ~oblin~~~ found that there are up to 500pg of DBP per kilogram of food wrapped in plastic. The phthalate BBP not only goes into items like vinyl tile, but is also put into paper and cardboard designed for contact with liquid, diy and fatg fd. This explains how butter and margarines and up laced with BBP at concentrations exceeding 45mgper kilogramz3. All of these substances have been established as seriously affecting humans, have their origin with petrochemicals, and are still allowed by those controlling the petrochemical and food industries to impact the population.

Oscar Ewing, was the major advocate of adding sodium fluoride, an EPA-designated hazardous waste and a by-product of aluminum manufacture, to the public water supplies in the United States.

According to the EPA in July 1995, a host of pollutants has been identified that 'fbnctionally mimic estrogens in animals''. According to L.

One of the chemicals identified was vinclozolin, which is a ~ystemic fungicide used to protectBit, vegatables and ornamental plants. The indications are that a vast number of chemicals, both in the food and the environment, are in effect demasculinating and feminizing the male population. Vinclozolin works by binding to and blocking the androgen receptors in reproductive tissue. Most experiments have been done with rats, but since these types of chemicals are put in the human food chain, the implications become quickly obvious. Not only does the fungicide bind the the androgen receptors, but the breakdown products in the body bind to them jrom I0 to 100 times more effectivelJ' .

Soto indicates that these chemicals have a cumulative effect on the body, and notes that the cost of producing afiture generation that cannot reproduce cannot be estimated. Some environmental agents that affect reproduction are not estrogenic. Some substances, such as the systemic hngicide benomyl, cause the premature release of cells that would have become sperm. Benomyl is used on everything from rice and tomatoes to apples and grapes.

According to Skakkebaek, the rate of testicular cancer continues to grow. Skakkebaek himself did an analysis of previously published studies on semen quality. The data indicated a fall of sperm density from 113 million per milliliter in 1940 to 66 million per milliliter in 1990. It was also noted that the volume of sperm has also dropped an average of 19%. What appears to be a 'tvorrisome trend'', as far as orthodox science is concerned, in actuality is a planned event geared to support a Malthiusiun population rediction mandate. In order to prove that, we must be able to prove that the effect of some of these chemicals was known in the past. Why would they have started tracking sperm density in 1940? British studies have documented a near doubling of the number of boys born with at least one undescended testicle. In the 1950's, it was about 1.6%. In the 1970's it grew to 2.9%\". The undescended testicle cannot produce sperm, because sperm production must occur below 98.6 degrees. EPA research indicates that some substances like TCDD, the most environmentally permanent dioxin, do not overtly feminize rats but slightly emasculate both sexual behavior and reproduction - changes which result in large effects on sperm count3'. In addition, birth registries in England and Wales document that congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract (hypospadias) doubled between 1964 and 1983. The work of Skakkebaek has identzed an apparent link between undescended testicles at birth and testicular cancer in adulthood. All of these phenomena have been reported in women who received DES, a synthetic estrogen, during pregnancy. Even though it was known in the 1950's that reproductive abnormalies were accelerating, no effort was made to definitively define the problem - or, efforts were derailed by the pharmaceutical and chemical cartels as it represented both a threat to profits and a potential for accountability and liability. Environmental Estrogens and Breast Cancer Breast cancer has also been on the increase in industrialized society. While it has been determined that carcinogenic substances disrupt genetic bnctions in the cell, as well as break and mutate DNA, a number of laboratories around the world have been investigating other environmental mechanisms to explain the rise in breast cancer. Findings indicate that the chemical cocktail of estrogenic agents in the environment has a part to play in the rise of breast cancer by stimulating breast cell proliferation and interfering with metabolism of estradiol. 28 Science News, Vol 145, Jan 22, 1994, p. 145. 29 Ibid. 30 Toxicology and Applied Phannaology, March 1995."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Study discovers * a/ estrogen, cancer link he ~ssociated Press G, '1 J BOSTON - Women who take es- trogen for several years after menopause appear to raise their risk of breast cancer by nearly half, a stuQ found Older women once took estrogen for only a few years to ease the hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and the new study confirms this is safe. But many doctors now keep women on hormones for many years, even for life, because of es- trogen's demonstrated abiity to ward off heart trouble and frac- tures. The latest research suggests such lengthy use may do more . harm than good for some women \"It clearly raises the need to re consider the risk and benefit if a woman is go to use hormones for more than % years,\" said Dr. Graham A Colditz of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the study's principal author. Some earlier studies bave aiso found links between estrogen and breast cancer; others have not The latest report, published in Thus- day's New England Journal of Medicine, is the largest to examine the question It was based on the Nurses' Health Study, which has followed 121,700 women nurses since 1972. Estrogen's benefits may still out- weigh its hazards for women who are at high risk of heart trouble and brittle bones. However, for those whose risk of these problems is low, the study says the increased chance of breast cancer may make hormone supplements a bad gam- ble. The study found that woinen who took either estrogen alone or estro- gen plus another hormone, prog- estin, for more than five years had a 46 percent higher risk of breast cancer than did those who never used the therapy. The risk varies depending on the woman's age. The researchers cal- culated that a Wyear-old woman who has used estrogen for at least five years has a 3 percent chance of developing breast cancer over the next five years if she keeps taking the treatment. If she had never used hormones after menopause, her risk over the same period would be 1.8 percent The study also found that long- term users' increased risk of breast cancer drops back to normal within two years of stopping hormone The News Tribune, Wednesday, July 19,1995 Report: Estrogen cuts colon cancer risk WASHINGTON - Women using estrogen replacement drugs aRer menopause reduce their risk of colon cancer by about half, researchers say. The finding adds to a growing list of effects, good and bad, from hormone ther- apy.

'This is a big re duction in a disease that is the third most-common cancer among women.\" About 70,000 women are diagnosed annually with colon cancer and about 30,000 die of the disease, said Newcomb. The study will be published today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

In a study reported Monday, women who took no estrogen from 60 to 66 years old showed ''typical age-related declines in visual memory\" over the six years, while those' on hor- mones showed no decline, said psychologist Susan Resnick of the National Institute on Aging. Resnick looked at women who were tested every few years since 1978 as part of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study. She compared scores of 117 estrogen users and 174 nonus- en on a test that predicts onset of Alzheimer's dii. Current hormone users did better. Then she selected 18 women who started using-hormones by 66. She matched them with 18 who scored the same at 60 but didn't take estrogen in the next six years."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO FDA Total Diet Studv of American Foods and Contaminants Pesticide Pesticide Product #sam~les # Residues # Formulations Remarks Buttennilk Chocolate Milk Low Fat Milk yogurt Skim Milk Ice Milk Margarine Milk Shakes Yogurt w/fiuit Butter Cottage Cheese Evaporated Milk Half-and-Half Ice Cream Processed Cheese Sofi Cheeses Whole Milk Beef Broth 16 Chicken Noodle Soup 16 Pork and Beans 16 Spaghetti, Tomato S. 16 Tomato Soup 16 Vegetable Beef Soup 16 Frozen Fried Chicken 16 Frozen Chicken potpiel 6 Lasagne - 16 Macaroni & Cheese 16 Spaghetti wlmeat 16 French Fries 16 Frozen Pizza 16 Apple Pie 16 Chocolate Pudding 16 Gelatin Desserts 16 Caramels 16 Chocolate Milk Mix 16 Danish Pastries 16 Doughnuts 16 Sandwich Cookies 16 DDT, Penta Industrial 1 Pesticides DDT, Dieldrin, Heptachor DDT, Penta Octachlor, Penta DDT,Dieldrin, HCB PCB, Penta DDT,Dieldrin, malathion DDT, Dieldrin, Endosulfan DDT,Dieldrin, Heptachlor DDT, Dieldrin, Heptachlor DDT, Dieldrin, malathion DDT, Dieldrin,Octachlor DDT, Dieldrin, Octachlor DDT, Dieldrin, Lindane Listeria bacteria DDT, Dieldrin, Lindane Sulfamethazine, Heptachlor Penta Malathion, Penta Dieldrin Diazinon DDT, MalathioqParathion None DDT, Diazinon DDT, Diazinon,malathion DDT, Malathion DDT, Malathion, Penta DDT, Malathion DDT,Teteachlor Benzene DDT, Dieldrin, Heptachlor DDT, Heptachlor, Lindane DDT, Octachlor, Lindane PentalTributyl Phosphate Dieldrin, Malathion Dieldrin, Lindane Dieldrin, DDT, Octachlor DDT, Malathion, Octachlor DDT, Dieldrin, Lidane"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Pesticide Pesticide Product #samples # Residues # Formulations Remarks Chocolate Cake 16 6 1 8 DDT,EDB,Malathion Chocolate Chip Cook 16 68 12 DDT, Dieldrin, Lindane Coffee Cake 16 60 1 1 Dieldrin, Heptachlor Milk Chocolate 16 93 14 DDT, Dieldrin, Heptachlor 1 Pumpkin Pie 16 54 13 DDT, Heptachlor, Dieldrin Brown Gravy 16 16 4 Malathion, Penta Honey 16 8 3 Penta, BHC, EDB,Antibiotics Italian Salad Dressing 16 9 4 Dieldrin, Penta Mayonnaise 16 9 4 Dieldrin, Penta Pancake Syrup 16 3 1 Penta Sugar, White 16 9 3 Tributyl Phosphate, Penta Corn Chips 16 26 7 Toxaphene, Malathion Fruit Jelly 16 20 6 Malathion, Carbaryl Ketchup 16 3 8 7 DDT, Penta Dill Pickles 16 65 12 Dieldrin, Heptachlor Peanut Butter 16 183 17 Dieldrin, Toxaphene Potato Chips 16 5 3 10 DDT, Dieldrin 16 0 0 Olive Oil Virtually fiee Sesame Oil 16 0 0 Virhially free Corn Oil 16 20 8 Malathion, Dieldrin Margarine 16 19 2 Penta, Diphenyl Phospate Cottonseed Oil 16 10 2 DDT, Dieldrin Soybean Oil 38 20 7 DDT, Malathion Coffee 44 3 5 7 Various Tea (bag) 16 1 1 Penta Instant Coffee 16 1 1 Tri 2-ethylhexyl phosphate Wine 16 44 4 Carbaryl, Dichloran Apple Juice 16 15 3 Carbaryl, Dimethoate Apples 16 80 20 DDT, Phosmet, Phosalone Apricots (Residues of Azinphos-methyl, Captan, Carbary1,Diazinon) Artichokes (Residues of Endosulfan) Blackberries (Residues of Captan, Rovral, Dichlofluanid, Fenthion) Blueberries (Residues of Captan, Botran, Row& DDT) Broccoli 16 45 12 DDT, Dieldrin Cantaloupe 16 58 17 Dieldrin, Lindane, Carbaryl Green Bell Peppers 16 83 22 Dieldrin, Penta, Carbaryl Honeydue Melon (Residues of chlorothalonil, Dieldren, Endosulfan) Jalapeno Peppers (Residues of Acephate, Carbaryl, Malathion, Monocrotophos) Kale .

Other refinements were made during the second World War and then extended into civilian peacetime in terms of the spraying of biochemical warfare weapons, pesticides, insecticides and herbicides on the mass civilian population \"to control disease and pests.\" Viewed from inside a short linear time span while totally in social conciousness, this rationale might be viewed as semi-plausible, but viewed outside of social consciousness over an extensive linear format, combined with other information, it becomes quite clear that another agenda is being implemented. It is-an agenda that when assembled, proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that the initial operative premise is true - that human populations are being deliberately dosed with toxic substances in order to increase general physiological degeneration, boost medical and pharmaceutical financial profits, and fullill elitist Malthusian population reduction mandates fiom existing populations. Where's the proof of this premise? Is there any proof any of it is intentional and deliberate?

Dow chemical is the worlds largest manufacturer of phenol, a carcinogenic substance which gave Dow its start.

Dow became a major producer of these chemicals). Phenoxy herbicides profoundly affect nucleic acid metabolism, disrupt the synthesis of RNA and DNA, and suppress synthesis of gene-regulating enzymes.

Used to kill rice crops) Historical Developments, 1940 to 1972 Back in 1880, Charles ~arwin~ proposed proposed that plant growth is regulated by a chemical, which he termed \"auxin\". The chemical, indoleacetic acid, would be isolated 60 years later in 1940. Attempts to synthesize similar compounds led to the development of the phenoxy acids, 24D and 245T. Miniscule amounts have the ability to stimulate plants, despite the deposition of lethal chemicals in plant tissue. Slightly greater amounts disrupt cellular and genetic structure. Since the deliberate killing of enemy plant crops had been practiced since Roman times, scientists sought to develop the lethal potential of these substances. In 1941, the lethal potential of 24D and 245T was studied by Dr.E.J.Kraus at the University of Chicago, which also had a contract with the U.S.Army for research in chemical warfare. Within two years, in 1943, Kraus presented his report to the National Sciences Committee on Biological Warfare. In 1944, Kraus was transferred to Camp Detrick (later Fort Detrick), the Army's Biological Warfare Testing Center in Maryland. A close neighbor to the Detrick installation was the USDA research station at Beltsville. The participation of the USDA in domestic biochemical warfare would later figure prominently in the implementation of Malthuisian policies in the U.S., as we shall later see. In 1948, some of the first experiments were conducted with phenoxy herbicides in \"forest management\" in the Pacific Northwest by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the United States Forest Service (USFS), and Oregon State University (OSU) on land near Five Rivers in the Siuslaw Naeonal Forest. These experiments demonstrated wide drift of the aerially applied 24D. The military demonstrated much interest in these results. By 1955, the USDA was actively involved in US.

Either the chemicals had affected his mind or he was implementing someone else's agenda. The latter proved to be the case. How Newton got ahold of surplus government stocks of dioxin-laced Agent Orange and was able to spray it over private lands (despite the results of the Senate Hearing, the USDA reports, the Dow reports and the decision of the Mrak Commission) remains a mystery. It may become clearer as we move on with the discussion. On April 15, 1970, the secretaries of Agriculture (USDA), Interior, and HEW announced suspension of the registration of 2,4,5-T for aquatic, home and recreational use, followed 15 days later by a notice of cancellation of regstration for all uses on food crops intended for human use. Since rice was one of the major food crops treated with 245T, Dow Chemical challenged the cancellation. While the advisory commitee deliberated (the fact that they had to \"deliberate\" at all about such an issue is telling), regulation of pesticides was transferred by Presidential order fiom the USDA to the EPA. In 1971, the advisory commitee (composed of those with connections to the food and chemical industries) submitted its report to EPA administrator William Ruckelshaus, concluding that 245T \"was unlikelv to constitute a hazard to human health.\" Only one member of the committee, Dr. Ted Sterling, dissented. Despite the recommendation of the biased commitee, Ruckelshaus continued the ban on 245T until the legal requirement for a public hearing could take place. Dow Chemical objected, and successfully challenged the EPA Relationships to Environmental Health, U.S. Dept of Health, Education and Welfare, December 1969.

During those 8 years, Dow Chemical marketed and promoted the use of dioxin-containing 245T, a chemical that had been withdrawn fiom use by the military since 1970. Major amendments to the FERA were passed by Congress in 1972 that required \"review and re-registration of all pesticides after EPA-determined efficacy and safety tests.\" Unfortunately for the population of the United States, Congressional oversight of this amendment remained in the agriculture committees of Congress, which were pro- chemical. Mass Herbicide Spraying on the Population and Government Agency Involvement In the United States, it is. technically illegal to perform pesticide experiments on human beings without their informed consentg . There is a distinction, however, between experimental activity and operational activity. Experiments done by the U. S . Government over population centers with biological weapons have been known for some time. The chemical experimentation, especially with chemicals that can sterilize the population and induce neurotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects, are not so well knownlO. Arizona Research indicates that spraying of the select elements of the United States population with 24D-245T mixtures (Agent Orange) or selective applications of 24D or 245T began about 1965. From 1965 to 1969, for example, the U.S.Forest Service (USFS) began a herbicide program in the Tonto National Forest and sprayed thousands of acres near Globe, Arizona with Agent Orange and 245TP, or Silvex, the same chemicals being sprayed over South Vietnam at the time. No residents of the sprayed areas were notified, either before or after the spraying.

When trees began to die, the USFS told residents that the trees were affected with a \"mysterious disease.\"\" A major investor in the herbicide program was the Salt River Hydroelectric Project (SRHP), who stood to gain from the water runoff when all the plants died. All animal life perished in the sprayed areas. Trees and plants died. People sickened and died, and the areas became poisoned for decades. Spraying of the Globe area began to intensify in 1966. In June 1969, families living in Keller Canyon in the Globe area found helicopters flying directly over their houses and faxms spraying Agent Orange. Farms animals became blind, deformed, paralyzed and bled from every conceivable orfice. Helicopters deliberately sprayed families. The Arizona Department of Health found the same chemicals in the Globe, Arizona municipal water supply. Billie Shoecraft, author of Sue the Bastards, was sprayed directly while standing in front of her house. She slapped a $4.5 million lawsuit against the U.S. Forest Service and four herbicide manufacturers. Since the phenoxy herbicide program was so important to the USDq the chemical industry, the military and a major hydroelectric company, scientists and politicians who were called into the area to investigate were unable or unwilling to get involved, much less to listen to the testimony of \"scientifically unknowledgable residents\" and \"anecdotal reports\" of injuries, cancers and generalized mayhem caused by the spraying. By 1970, residents were so frustrated that sii families filed another lawsuit against the Salt River Project, four chemical companies and a helicopter company. For I1 years these families held out for a court hearing. By 1980, only Dow Chemical remained of the sii defendents named in the case.

Oregon Oregon was seemingly involved with the first \"testing\" of phenoxy herbicides back in 1948. However, major spraying of watersheds, population areas and faxm animals in Oregon began simultaneously with spraying in Vietnam, Arizona and several other states in the mid 1960's. One of the major areas affected in Oregon is the area around Siuslaw National Forest, where the U.S. Forest Service began spraying with a mixture of 24D and 245T - Agent Orange - very often on lands owned by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), ostensibly under the control of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The U.S. Forest Service refbsed all proposals from residents to use alternative methods of \"controlling brush.\" \" Shoecraft, Billie, Sue the Bastards!, Phoenix, Franklin Press, 1971, p.450. l2 DOW apparently had the gall to market a beer in Canada for a while, but stopped when dozens of people began dying after drinking it."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The bbCATS\" Case: 1976-1978 In April 1976, after more than a decade of spraying, Citizens Against Toxic Sprays (CATS) was joined by the Oregon Environmental Council and filed a suit in federal district court in Eugene, asking for an injunction against spraying throughout the Siuslaw National Forest, mainly that the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) submitted by the U.S. Forest Service was inaccurate and misleading relative to the nature of 24D, 245T and 245TP. What the litigants discovered is that there is no law that can be invoked to stop government agencies or anyone else from spraying toxins on populated areas. In May 1976, the litigants appealed to federal judge Otto Skopil for a temporary restraining order to suspend spraying operations until the case had been decided. It was denied, as the spraying contracts arranged by the USFS had alrea& been signed and it would have cost more monet to break them. The USFS immediately proceeded with the spraying. Those who signed the affidavits against the USFS had their property and water supplies sprayed immediately. County road crews in spray trucks joined the helicopters in their genocidal task. Meanwhile, the lawsuit proceeded. The Industrial Forestry Association (IFA) joined the USFS as arbitrators, although the IFA was represented by a law fhn who also represented Dow Chemical when the company would announce its intention to get involved in a case against it. Litigants in the case were tailed constantly by people with cameras. FBI agents appeared in the area, asking questions about CATS members. Now, the fact that the FBI was involved means that some faction in the federal government was determined to ensure that phenoxy herbicides would be sprayed, no matter what. The Case The spraying of phenoxy herbicides was challenged by the people on the grounds that (1) scientific evidence exists that phenoxy herbicides are harmful to life, and (2) the Environmental Impact Statement @IS) submitted by the U.S. Forest Service disregarded the nature of phenoxy herbicides, and (3) the EIS gave the impression that spraying was safe and would have no environmental impact on people or animals. The Litigants: The People, represented by CATS and the Oregon Environmental Council. The Defendants: The U.S. Forest Service, OSU, the EPA, Dow Chemical Company, and the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, who had supplied most of the technical information in the EIS. The People submitted a large number of scientific documents testifjing to the toxicity and environmental effect of phenoxy herbicides; affidavits fiom residents relating damage to health, crops, land and livestock fiom forest spraying; detailed testimony on the feasibility of manual brush control as an alternative to herbicides; testimony fiom forest workers on the effect that spraying chemicals had on their health. In addition, the People had at their disposal on site a vast selection of scientific documents."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO The hearing was predictably strange. Judge Skopil, on several occasions, referred to the defense lawyers as \"Dow lawyers\", and was amused when they objected. An OSU scientist did not recognize the title or text of a scientific paper published in his name. The EPA had engaged Dr. Logan Noms fiom OSU to take samples in the Siuslaw Forest during the spraying. Dr. Noms acknowledged that his sampling yielded positive results for dioxin contamination, yet he did not submit the information to the Forest Service. According to Noms, \"only negative results were considered sound.\" Dr. Patrick O'Keefe, a chemist fiom Harvard, testified for the people. O'Keefe said that the samples collected from the Siuslaw Forest under the Dioxin Monitoring Program showed high levels of TCDD. His testimony was in stark contrast the the defense witnesses, who maintained the safety of herbicides. O'Keefe blew away the contention of the USFS that TCDD could not accumulate in the environment. Dr. O'Keefe also testified that he had collected human milk samples fiom mothers in the area that showed TCDD contamination and had submitted them to the EPA. The EPA never released this information, and it was only discovered after a Congressional FOIA request. I3 Predictably, all defendent parties challenged the human milk sample results. In the end, Judge Skopil found that the 1976-77 EIS failed to acknowledge the extreme toxicity of TCDD. Skopil granted a permanent iniunction apainst the use of 235T and 245TP. He noted that the EIS contained no relevant discussion of herbicide alternatives, substitution of other kinds of herbicides, and that the EIS was totally inadequate. However, Judge Skopil stated that his decision related onlv to 245T and 245TP. not to-forest use of 24D. He made is clear that his decision was based on \"the Forest Services blatant lack of regard for the consequences of their spray program on the health of human beings-\" The USFS could not spray 245T or 245TP until they had prepared a new EIS that included all information about health effects and alternatives. Skopil's opinion was fled on March 7, 1977, cancelling the spray program for that year. In April 1978, the USFS submitted a new EIS which contained information on the health e#ects of herbicides and discussion of alternatives. Although Skopil conceeded that the new EIS used language which chose to downplay effects, and noted that \"the Forest Service should understand that materially misleading statements and conclusions can be just as fatal to an EIS as omissions and false statements.\" Since the USFS had technically complied with the letter of the law insofaras EIS content, Skopil was forced to approve the USFS plan. Skopil entered into the record a plea for the USFS to act more responsibly. We must make it clear at this point that it was not the responsibility of Judge Skopil to make the decision of whether herbicides should be sprayed, only to review the EIS. It was now legal for the USFS to proceed again with herbicide spraying. They did it with a vengeance. Keep in mind, now, that the government has known the effect of phenoxy herbicides on the population for decades and is doing it anyway. The question is, \" Statesman Journal, Salem Oregon, \"Mother's milk yields a trace of dioxin\", Feb 17, 1977; O'Keefe, Patrick. Supplementary Testimony in Cl TS v.

It is known a great number of secret negotiations transpired between the EPA and Dow Chemical Company which prevented the completion or public disclosure of riskhenefit analyses. Since the late 1960's, animal experiments demonstrated that phenoxy herbicides affect reproductive success and cause degenerative disease. Since the government has known this since then, it can only be concluded that the spraying existed to intentionally affect human reproduction capabilities andproduce degenerative disease. Now, who might benefit from this policy? After the suspension of the use of 245T and 245TP, the U.S. Forest Service substituted 24D and piclorarn in its Siuslaw National Forest spring applications in 1979, and proposed spraying within a mile or less of private homes, including watersheds for domestic water supplies. Complaints to the District Ranger about these plans were met with assurances that spray plans would be revised to avoid contamination of water supplies. However, the watersheds were sprayed anyway. Within weeks, 60% of the pregnant women in the Five Rivers Valley suffered miscarriages. Children were coming down with meningitis. Letters were written to the EPA, the USFS and the local health department complaining about the spraying. The EPA responded, saying that they would issue questionnaires for residents to complete and that they would be looking for the occurrence of pregancies and spontaneous abortions. So, residents found themselves unwittingly participanting in an \"EPA study\" - a study designed to be a prospective and continuing at least through 1980. Since the EPA already knew the effects of phenoxy herbicides, it can be concluded that \"epidemiological studies\" constituted a delaying tactic designed to allow programs to continue, while presenting the \"impression\" that concern existed, until other substances can be brought in that no one has information about and used for the same purpose. It is a government pattern that is quite familiar. By late 1979, birth defects were running rampant, with neural tube defects showing up very prominently. In September, thirteen physicians petitioned Lincoln County Commissioners to institute a moritorium on the use of phenoxy herbicides until the pesticide useres and producers could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the chemicals were safe for human exposure. The Commissioners refbsed to act on the petitions, believing that the county had no jurisdiction over state and federal activities in the county.\" Ballot measures were then proposed by residents, but were soundly defeated because the chemical industry fbnded political opposition. Indications that Herbicide Spraying is Connected to Military Chemical and Biological Warfare Programs In January 1981 (remember that this is during the administration of George Bush, former director of the CIA), the U.S. Forest Service announced its plans to triple the acreage to be sprayed, using 24D, piclorarn, Roundup and Krenite. Residents were outraged. The USFS EIS did not even address chemical effects yd alternatives to use - a requirement firmly established by the 1976 CATS case.

This is equivalent to the \"Determination of Non-Sigmficance\" used by cellular companies when erecting cellular towers. The USFS was now absolved of a legal obligation to study and disclose the effect of its actions. It was a brilliant political tactic. A lawsuit was filed against the USFS, the EPA and the BLM, petitioning them to jointly prepare an EIS which would adequately address health and safety issues. A temporary restraining order was also sought to prevent the USFS from awarding spraying contracts until the case was decided. The request for a restraining order was denied by a federal district judge because the plaintiff had no proved that irreparable harm would occur. The suit had the effect of curtailing 1981 USFS spraying in the Five Rivers Valley and reducing spraying in the rest of the Siuslaw National Forest. The case was still pending in 1982, delayed by government re@al to provide the plaintiff witth EPA evaluations of safety testing on forest chemicals, or connections between testina laboratories and the military chemical and biolopicol wmfme command.\" The -connections are now becoming clearer. How many scientists originally connected with Operation Paperclip were originally connected with development of these programs? The Nazi mentality is evident here, as are the policies of Social Darwinism and Malthusian-based population control policies - all based on false scientific paradigms which have absolutely no veracity. A Connection Between Phenoxy Herbicide Spraying and the CIA becomes evident By 1981, residents in Oregon began to arm themselves against efforts to spray neurotoxic and mutagenic phenoxy herbicides over populated areas. Spray trucks began to ignore the \"No Spray\" signs posted by residents.16 Helicopter crews were confronted by citizens. A year earlier in 1980, citizens began trashing helicopters from Evergreen Helicopter Company connected with spraying. In May 198 1, helicopters were increasingly burned and destroyed by irate citizens. As destruction of an aircraft is a federal crime, local newspapers issued rewards for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators. No one who destroyed aircraft was ever located or prosecuted. l5 Merrell v. J.R. Block, et al., U.S. District Court, Oregon, Civil No. 81-6138-E. A series of Freedom of Information requests revealed that the US.

It is also interesting that the govement's National Center for Toxicological Research has been identified as a cover for the Pine Bluff Arsenal in krkansas, a major center for the production and development of chemical and biological warfare weapons. Many labs who were charged with determining the safety of phenoxy herbicides falsified and suppressed evidence that these substances were harmful , confronted with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, in order to allow spraying to occur unimpeded. l6 The Coastal Monitor, Newport, Orgeon, \"County roadcrews ignore 'no spray' signs\", May 1981; Statesman Journal, Salem Oregon, \"Five Rivers residents block herbicide truck\", May 14, 198 1."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Death By Government Now, Evergreen is a company with known CIA connections.

The implications are obvious and grave. Indications are that the spraying is still continuing. The spraying of neurotoxic malathion in California has produced great concern, as has the use of organochlorine pesticides. In the face of corporate and government CBW testing and dissemination of carcinogenic chemicals in the environment, combined with the \"mock surprise and wonder\" expressed by the allopathic medical system at the growing load of cancer cases and brain tumors in the United States, citizens find themselves with no legal recourse against the problem except that which is considered \"unacceptable\" by those who would murder us all in the name of false science and elitism to achieve a political objective fostered by ego aggrandisement and preoccupation with death, wealth, power and greed. \"What is largely responsible for the death toll is the belief in power as a tool ... power kills .. . the more power a government has, the more it kills.

Rumrnel, in Death by Government Elements of Fraud and Falsification of Chemical Testing In 1976, the FDA discovered serious discrepancies in the testing of phamaceuticals and chemicals in tests performed by major laboratories in the United States. These tests were the basis upon which substances are registered and approved, and are also the basis for approval in Canada and other counties. The EPA was informed about these discrepanies, but withheld the information from the public until 1977. The nation's largest laboratory involved was Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories (IBT), a subsidiary of Narco Chemical Company. IBT conducted over 25,000 tests on food additives, colors, drugs, cosmetics, agricultural chemicals and herbicides between 1969 and 1976.18 On the basis of IBT data, products were registered for use by the EPA and FDA, and tolerance levels of pesticide residues in human food were established. The FDA audit disclosed deliberate falsziJcation of testing reports in many of over 4,000 tests involving 123 pesticides and 160 applications for foodpesticide resihue tolerance levels allowed in food. 17 Statesman Journal, Salem, Oregon, \"New Evergreen chief hopes to build stronger financial base for expansion\", March 7, 1982. l8 The Toxic Mist: The Use and Abuse of Pesticides 396"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The EPA, when it finally released the fact that all of these tests had been falsified, publically deemed these fraudulent activities \"deficiencies.\" In 1977, EPA adminstrator Douglas costle19 , however, conceeded that \"the EPA is dependent on receiving accurate tests data in its (process ofl regulation of pesticides. If that data is deficient, there can be no assurance that the public health and the environment is being properly protected.\" The EPA was not forthcoming on any of the details until an agricultural reporter managed to cajole an EPA employee in 1980 to release details on just how serious the problem was. The EPA employee, who was later reassigned because she gave out the information, indicated that 99% of IBT's long-term studies were invalid, 94% of the carcinogenicity studies were invalid, 79% of the reproductive effect studies were invalid, 64% of the neurotoxicity studies were invalid, 44% of the mutagenicity studies were invalid, 75% of the studies to determine effects on wildlife were invalid, and 42% of the studies to determine chemical residue tolerance levels in human food were invalid. The EPA, however, would not identify the chemicals involved. A 1978 Wall Street Journal articleZ0 revealed that former IBT president Frisque had ordered shredding of hundreds of records requested by the EPA, including seven long-term studies on the cancer-causing potential of substances used in plastics, herbicides and artificial sweeteners. The article also quoted an EPA official as saying that the EPA was looking in to \"eight or nine\" other testing labs at the time. This is what was reported publicly in the paper. However, in response to a 1981 Freedom of Information (FOIA) request, the EPA conceeded that out of 82 laboratories audited after the 1976 FDA discovery, 25 labs had serious deficiencies, with data from 10 considered totally invalid, and 22 others routinely destroyed lab reports containing raw data. In other words 57% of the 82 labs produced fraudulent data. In June of 1981, a Federal Grand Jury indicted four former IBT officials on charges of falsifjing test results on chemicals and drugs between 1969 and 1976, as well as falsifjling reports both the FDA and EPA. Even in 1982, the EPA refbsed to reveal what chemicals were \"tested\" by any one of these labs or which ones constituted invalid results. One IBT official indicted was Paul Wright, who worked for IBT fiom March 1971 to September 1972, and then got a job with Monsanto as \"manager of toxicology.\" Registration of Monsanto's herbicide \"Roundup\" was based on fraudulent data from IBT. Agencies Regroup As a direct result of the IBT investigation, as well as the exposure of 47 other laboratories putting out false test data, the EPA asked 235 chemical companies to re- examine 4,363 tests supporting the registration of 483 different pesticides and herbicides, including 245T, 24D and 245TP (Silvex). Of course, complete .evaluation of all the chemicals and drugs involved would take an estimated 50 years, and all the while the EPA press release \"Deficiencies in pesticide safety tests reported by EPA\" Aug 25, 1977 20 Wall Street Journal, Feb 21, 1978."},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO registrations at EPA and FDA based on the admittedly false tests continue until the complete picture is resolved after the year 2000. As mentioned before, as a result of the publicity generated by the FDA discovery of 1976, Congress in 1978 amended FIFRq instituting a new a novel concept called conditional registration, which provided that new or already registered products (under the falsified IBT or other lab data) could gain a synthetic status of registration and usage before adequate testing took place. This constituted a political ploy that acquiesced to the chemical and pharmaceutical companies who, through political action committees lobbied (pressured) Congressional members and contributed money to campaign coffers (bribes). The lobby of the National Forest Products Association did the same thing in 1978 and \"suggested an another amendment to Congress for the FIFRq which Congress passed, making it possible for certain pesticides and herbicides to be granted a synthetic \"minor use\" exemption permitting them to be used in any unpopulated areas surrounding communities, farms and recreational areas. In March 1978, it was clear that the admission to the public by the FDA and EPA that tests on 25,000 products didn't matter. No action was taken and no one was prosecuted except for the four IBT officials, who received a slap on the hand. The credibility of both the FDA and EPA was now permanently damaged. To outsiders, the inaction by the FDA and EPA was inexplicable. Other 1978 amendments to the FIFRA provided for \"public disclosure of health and safety data\" on active ingredients of registered pesticides. On the surface, it was an amendment that seemed to indicate a move in the right direction. In actuality, it meant nothing, since chemical and pharmaceutical companies are corporate \"entities\", and actively sought and obtained injunctions against FIFRA disclosure provisions on the grounds that FIFRA \"violated their 5th Amendment Constitutional rights\". They claimed that health and safety information was intellectual property of commercial value\" and that government release of such information would constitute ''tml~~tfil taking of property without due process of law.\" So, corporations considered themselves \"individual citizens of the United States protected by the Constitution. This quirk in corporate interpretation has never been successfblly challenged. The 1978 FlFRA amendment providing for disclosure of health and safety data on active ingredients (such as it is), exempted disclosure of health and safety data on so-called \"inert\" ingredients, many of which are extremely toxic and biologically hdl. Details about inert ingredients are legally held from public scrutiny. Eventually, corporate injunctions obtained against FIFRA-sponsored release of information were overturned by an appellate court, and upheld by a 1981 Supreme Court decision.

Now, why would these companies want to conceal the toxic nature of what they were doing from public scruntiny? How can the public deal with these companies on a level they will understand? One interesting tool is the \"shareholder resolution\". Security and Exchange Commission regulations require that any corporate shareholder can submit proposals on policies and practices of corporations for consideration by all shareholders at corporate annual meetings. It's the law. In 1980 and 1981, several church and religious groups who were significant shareholders of Dow Chemical Company asked Dow shareholders to support a resolution directing DOW Chemical to establish an independent review committee (like asking the fox to guard the henhouse) to evaluate the existing and potential health consequences of 245T and derivative chemicals, as well as make recommendations on the justification of continued production of these herbicides and similar pesticides. The shareholders based their resolution on the 1979 EPA emergency suspension of 245T, two studies perfbrmed by the National Cancer Institute that found dioxin to be carcinogenic, and the fact that corporate data for Dm Chemical revealed that money expended by Dow in defending phenoxy herbicides exceeded the income that Dow received #om phenoxy herbicides. In addition, phenoxy herbicides accounted for only 2/10 of 1% of total chemical sales. Now, why would a company spend more money to defend a product than they made on a product, for a product that constituted only .2% of its sales, unless there was another age& that the pr&ct met - an agenda that did not entirely involve Dm Chemical? The shareholder resolution upset Dow Chemical and they issued a statement to the shareholders in opposition to the resolution, claiming that the original 1976 EPA hearings served the same purpose and such activity now would be redundant. The resolution was defeated in 1980. The 198 1 Annual Corporate Meeting for Dow Chemical Company was not without its drawbacks. A former consultant to Dow, Dr. Marvin Legator, who was then the director of the division of toxicology for the University of Texas Medical School, spoke at the meeting in support of the proposed resolution. It was the last time he would be invited to say anything. Legator supported the resolution with a verbal rendition of Dows own policies for monitoring chemicals with carcinogenic and mutagenic effects, as well as citing two studies from Sweden and New Zealand implicating 245T as a cause of cancer and birth defects. Legator's words fell on deaf ears. To confiont Dow at the annual meeting was inadvisable. Amazingly, Dow executives claimed that the two NCI studies cited in the resolution actually supported Dow's position on 245T (the NCI studies supported the toxic and carcinogenic nature of 245T). Dow referred to a British government report (based on IBT data) which concluded that 245T was safe. Dow neglected to inform the constituency that the British Trade Union Congress, which had a membership of 12 million people, refitted the British government study on the same day it was released.

In the end, the 198 1 resolution was defeated for a second time. The Experience with Vietnam Veterans and Agent Orange The early defoliation program in Vietnam was termed Operation Hades. The extension of that program was termed Operation Ranch Hand. In 1977, a caseworker at the VA hospital in Chicago began to notice that veterans had various medical problems which fit a pattern. Vets complained of numbness in the hands, rashes, bih defects in children, heart conditions, chronic fatigue, irritability and other marked symptoms. All the veterans complained about being exposed to chemicals while in Vietnam. By the time she had accumulated 57 cases, her supervisors became aware of her efforts to conduct an epidemiological review. She was told in no uncertain terms to stop her investigation. She then contacted WBBM television about the problem, and a one hour special program, structured as a debate, was arranged. Affected veterans were invited to be on the show. One female veteran who had filed a claim against the government for damages for Agent Orange poisoning told of four pregnancies lost through miscarriages and spontanous abortions. Residents of Globe, Arizona appeared on the special and told of the 245T spraying, the birth defects and problems with the government. Owners of horses in Missouri appeared on the program and related stock deaths from authorities spraying dioxin-contamined oil \"to keep the dust down.\" Officials fiom Dow Chemical Company also appeared on the show, as did government officials. Disclaimers by these officials was undermined by expert testimony fiom Dr. Matthre Meselson, a toxicologist fiom Haward. The television dosumentary triggered intense local public interest, and word spread nationwide. Veterans with similar symptoms could finally pinpoint the sources of their problems. Groups arose nationally. As a consequence of the 1977 documentary, a host-of national groups met in St.Louis and formed the National Veterans Task Force on Agent Orange in 1978. The Veterans Administration maintains a policy, relative to Agent Orange, is that veterans must prove exposure and casuality (connectedness to the chemical). Outwardly, this is against VA regulations, which require that any reasonable doubt involving a veterans claim to be resolved in favor of the veteran. The main source of this discontinuity appears to stem fiom, general governmental policy relative to veterans rights as well as the influence of the chemical cartels on the govemment. First of all, veterans have of'ten tried to take legal action in order to gain medical assistance and compensation relative to the problem. In the legal case Feres v. United States, decided by the Supreme Court in 1950, it was decided that military members must be denied the right to sue the government for admittedly negligent acts which occurred on active duty. It essentially denies the military access to the judicial system. The conceptual extension of this policy, relative to chemical manufacturers, has been termed the contract law version of the Nuremburg Defense: the chemical company, as a government contractor, may be immune fiom legal action because of mistakes for which the government itself cannot be held responsible."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO On June 26, 1979 the first public hearing on Agent Orange was held before the Sub-Committee on Oversight and Investigation (SCOI). Witnesses charged the VA with failing to study the Agent Orange problem, withholding veteran medical records and inadequately examining veterans with claimed Agent Orange-related medical problems. It was also pointed out that decision-making at the VA was carried out in secret, barring veterans themselves fiom participating in policy formulation. In December 1979, Congress passed Public Law 96-15 1, the Veterans Health Program Extension and Improvement Act. It made the VA theoretically responsible for conducting an epidemiological study of Vietnam veterans, especially those involved with Operation Hades and Operation Ranch Hand. Unfortunately, the VA interpreted this very narrowly, and the eventual proposal for an epidemiological study was limited to a short term examination of those involved, and did not take into account those with chronic and extensive exposure - which constituted most of the people with the problem. Most of those with problems were those troops who were concerned with maintenance of roads and transportation, as well as those whose duties put them near roads and rivers where defoliation took place and defoliated material burned. It was also in December 1979 that President Carter created the Interagency Working Group (IWG) in response to growing public concern about herbicides and dioxin. It would prove to be an empty gesture. The election of 1980 interfered with completion or publication of the report. The IWG included representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense, and the Veterans Administration. It included observers from the EPA, USDA, the Department of Labor, the White House Office of Science and Technology and the Office of Technology Assessment. In other words, the IWG was made up of all the agencies involved in the coverup and suppression efforts. The IWG did not initiate a new expanded study, but instead relied on the small limited VA study of Operation Ranch Hand personnel done as a reaction to PL 96- 15 1. It also relied on unverified Department of Defense evaluation of military exposure records, despite an existing General Accounting Office report that the DOD study was \"inaccurate in its report on ground troop locations and likelihood of exposure.\" In other words, the IWG continued the coverup by utilizing data which minimized the probablity of finding a great number of problems to be solved. When it was all over, the IWG suggested \"expanding the epidemiological study mandated by Congress in PL 96- 15 1 .\" This \"needs more study\" recommendation fiom the IWG was not welcomed at the VA, and they showed no willingness to change any policies with respect to those affected by phenoxy herbicides. In fact, the VA became more obstinate. They reaffirmed VA policy as requiring scientific proof of a definite linkage between exposure to herbicides and specific liability. Of course, it is impossible for any epidemiological study to produce such data, since the records required to prove it were concealed, suppressed or destroyed by the military.

In order examine the roots of the dictate relative to the issue, it is necessary to examine several earlier mass spraying programs. The Gypsy Moth Eradication Program In 1957, the USDA prepared to embark on an ambitious program \"to eliminate the gypsy moth\", widely acknowledged to be a threat to trees in northeastern forest regions, stripping trees of leaves, but only sometimes causing trees to die. The USDA proposed a well-coordinated regionwide spraying campaign to aerially spray a mixture of DDT suspended in oil. This program was explained to the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Agriculture by M.L. Clarkson, chief of the USDA Division of Plant and Pest Disease, as being the \"final solution\" to the problem of the gypsy moth.*' According to Clarkson, total eradication might require ten years of spraying. DDT by that time was known to have a devestating effect on wildlife. The USDA assured Congress that application of DDT was \"safe.\" Contradictions between USDA assurances and the apparently non-random pattern of wildlife mortality prompted the New York Times to question \"the government's moral and legal right to 'spread poison' over private property without permission of the owner in the absence of an overriding public health hazarde2 The 1957 Gypsy Moth program proceeded, leaving in its wake a vast a trail of death and destruction with indigenous wildlife. Residents of Long Island, New York, filed suit near the end of 1957 in an attempt to prevent future spraying programs. In order to win the lawsuit, residents had to demonstrate that (1) the USDA had no authority to undertake mass spraying programs without regard to land use or and (2) that DDT was without doubt a health hazard and that people were adversely affected by the spraying of DDT. The non-jury trial opened in February 1958, with the plaintiffs maintaining that the spraying program upset the balance of nature and ultimately produced unintended consequences worse than the original pest infestation and, firthennore, that the federal government had no right to apply such hazardous materials indiscriminately and that the private citizen had a right not to be sprayed. Dr. Malcolm Hargraves of the Mayo Clinic testified that experiments on laboratory animals strongly suggested an erosion in human tolerance to DDT as absorption rates increased, which might cause jaundice and aplastic anemid.

The Public Health Service, you will recall, is the same agency that promoted the addition of toxic sodium fluoride to public water supplies. The PHs presented \"field studies\" that contradicted laboratory evidence about toxic and chronic chemical effects of DDT, and Hayes declared that PHs examinations of workers at DDT manufacturing plants, and of prisoners who received over 200 times the \"normal\" daily dosage of the chemical, \"showed no ill effects.\" Hayes maintained that \"the amount of DDT absorbed by citizens was \"so small as to not be mea~urable.\"~' So, we now see that the government had done Phase I1 testing on prisoners, so they knew the eflect of DDT on hman physiology, yet they felt the need to lie to the court about these effects. Now, the judge in the case was named Bruchhausen (German). On June 23, 1958, Bruchhausen argued that government ~olice powers allowed it to undertake mray cam~aim - \"on behaZf of the -public ~ood.\" Government police powers? Where have we seen this phase used before? During the investigation of the vaccination paradigm. Bruchhausen, in the face of compelling scientific and experiential evidence to the contrary, declared that he found \"no compelling evidence to declare DDT a health hazard\" and that \"DDT was harmful neither to man nor wildlife when applied properly.\"26 Now, why would the judge lie in the face of compelling evidence to the contrary? Because mass spraying programs involve another agenda which overrides the physiological health of the public. The Long Island suit was eventually appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1959, and the result was the same. The court ruled that the cause of the complaint was moot and therefore nonjudicible. Plaintiffs in future mass spraying programs would encounter similar rulings, making it almost impossible to stop mass spraying of the population without temporary injunctions, which were almost impossible to acquire due to the predisposition of traditional deference to the \"expertise of executive agencies.\" Where plaintiffs could demonstrate evidence, using expert testimony, that pesticides caused damage to people and wildlife, courts declared the cases to be moot, since most cases came to trial afier the spraying had ceased. The \"Fire Ant Eradication\" Program The fire ant migrated fiom South America through the port of Mobile, Alabama in the 19207s, spreading gradually. By 1955, it was indigenous to parts of nine southern states. A National Research Council report found the sting of the ant to be no greater than the sting of bees or wasps2' According to a study in 1958, the primary food for the fire ant consisted of the boll weevil, an insect extremely harmfhl to cotton crops grown in the 25 New York Times, Feb 25, 1958, p.45. 26 New York Times, June 24, 1958, p.33. 27 Committee on the Imported Fire Ant, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Report by the National Research Council, 1 967. 405"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO South, and other insects. So, the fire ant in fact was a potentially valuable resource to Southern cotton farmers.28 Despite the fact that the \"threat\" fiom the fire ant was profoundly different fiom that presented by the government by the Gypsy moth, the government response to the existence of thefire ant would be of equal or greater magnitude. The USDA \"war against the fire ant\" continues to this day, despite opposition from evert biologists and environmental scientists. Why? It is interesting that prior to 1957, USDA entomologists womed little about the fire ant, and confined their activity to research studies that appeared to confirm the relatively minor status of the insect. In fact, the USDA's own ranking of control priorities in 1957 failed to mention the fire ant m a sign@cant pest.30 Department of Agriculture studies showed that the fire ant did not particularly bother farm workers and that land values were not affected by ant infestation. Why, then, did southern USDA officials suddenly, despite their own evidence, begin to support a massive federal eradication program? The USDA Acquires Authority to Spray Without Congressional Authorization On March 19, 1957, several southern House members requested the initiation of a broad campaign against the fire ant. Since existing statutory authority at the time allowed the USDA to undertake \"control programs\" only under specific congressional authorization. It was proposed to amend the Agricultural Organic Act of 1946 and grant the USDA broad authority \"to control or eradicate insect pests, particularly the fire ant.\" The proposed legislation would allow the USDA \"to control pests\" without spec* congressional a~thorirmion.~~ The eradication program thus began in later 1957. The USDA, with no justification or explanatory rationale, maintained that \"treatment of the fire ant problem\" required qvplication of granulated deldrin. chlordane. and heptachlor, all persistent hydrochloridated pesticides known to be at least 40 times more toxic than DDT. Some 20,000,000 acres were to be involved, and \"contingency hnds were to be made available\" to \"take care of emerging outbreak^.\"^^ The Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, Ervin L. Peterson, maintained that \"all infestations must be treated without regard to location, land use, or ownership33 . Now, if the actual evidence suggested that the fire ant was in no way a threat, why would the 58 Hays, K., \"The Present Status of the Imported Fire Ant...\", Journal of Economic Entomology, Vol 51, 1958, pp. 11 1-1 12. 29 In fact, a television program, National Geographic Explorer, featured \"the battle\" on TBS, 8/13/95.

It is only explainable by the presence of another agenda. Thus, the Fire Ant Eradication Act, Senate Bill 1442, was approved by Congress with minimal debate or opposition in less than 90 days. It was an event that was even more amazing considering that debate about the eradication program involving the Gypsy Moth was causing great public controversy during the same time period. Eisenhower signed the bill into law without comment on May 23rd, oddly the same day that the New York Times ran an editorial that supported federal research on the relationship between pesticide application and the affect on wildlife. Ironic, isn't it? In late 1957, the USDA announced that its new \"eradication program\" would take three years and that some 20 million acres \"required treatment.\" An immediate media propaganda blitz began to engender public support, and government authorities doused the public with press releases, motion pictures and government-inspired stories in order to eliminate resistence to the upcoming mass spraying on the population of neurotoxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic chemical toxins. One Southern newspaper joined the propaganda blitz, announcing \"no one knows how many people have been killed by ants.\" It was a rhetorical statement that was absolutely true, but was used to inspire fear in the population. Congress appropriated $2.4 million to begin the program, despite the existence of three studies by Harvard biologists that warned that the program would only serve to devestate the ant's natural predators, and that too little was known about dieldrin's toxic or chronic eflects to use it with confidence.34 Now, why would the government lie to the public, despite even the evidence provided by Harvard biologists? The fire ant eradication program was originally designated to be finded through a joint effort split between the states involved and the federal government, represented by the USDA. As the mass spraying program expanded, the horrendous effects on the wildlife became increasingly apparent. During 1958, the USDA treated some 900,000 acres with granulated dieldrin and heptachlor. The National Audubon Society argued that continuing field inspections showed alarming rates of wildlife damage and pleaded with the Whitten Subcommittee to suspend appropriations for the program. Congress ignored the devestation and appropriated another $2.4 million for another year of spraying. By late 1959, after another 800,000 acres had undergone \"treatment,\" USDA's intransigence in the face of wildlife devestation began to infuriate both state and national wildlife interests; a Georgia veterinarian reported the sudden death of over 100 cattle soon after dieldrin was sprayed, and reported of similar devestation to farm animals began to come in fiom throughout the region. Farmers in Georgia by mid-1959 rehsed to contribute fbrther monies to the program. In Texas, faced with growing opposition from both farmers and general landowners, the USDA literally gave heptachlor away to any property owner who would use it. The USDA continually assured the public that \"heptachlor can be applied at no danger to livestock, pets or birdsn3' , despite the obvious evidence that both dieldrin 34 ~ew York Times, Dec 27, 1957, p. 11. 35 In October 1959, the FDA announced its intent to establish a zero tolerance for heptachlor."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO and heptachlor were killing wildlife in massive numbers. In other words, the USDA continued to lie to the mblic. knowins? full weN that the public had no recourse. Silent Spring, Attempts at Reform and Pesticide Politics Following the publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, detailing the environmental abuse fostered by chemicals, it became evident that establishment criticism of the new public awareness about chemicals fell neatly into two camps. The chemical industry and agricultural businesses decided that in order to offset the bad publicity created by Silent Spring, the public needed to be \"educated and \"reminded of the benefits of pesticides to society\", despite the fact that there ultimately were none when the cumulative effect of these toxic chemicals was considered. The manufacturing industry conducted systematic advertising campaigns that hinted \"doom and gloom for the world food supply\" should pesticides and herbicides actually be eliminated in what the industry called a \"worst case scenario.\" In addition, the fact that scientists supporting the USDA and government (NAS-NRC) had been caught with their collective pants down meant that the \"assault on professional reputation\" had to be countered, especially because it had been neatly pointed out by Carson that many members on government panels created to regulate these chemicals worked for or were paid for by the industry - a situation that still exists today. To these scientists, despite the veracity of Carson's observations, it was an attack on their \"scientific neutrality\" which, of course, didn't exist in reality and does not exist today. In a masterpiece of psychological \"displacement\", the chemical industries viewed attacks on their credibility, and on their program of poisoning the public, as \"a sinister plan to create the false impression that business is grasping and immoral.\" They objected to the reduction of the use of agricultural chemicals as \"an attack on the food supply, potentially reducing it.\"36 Of course, the most \"sinister\" element of the attack was the public. Now, if it was an individual who behaved this way, it would have been cause for psychological commitment. A corporate entity, however, is an individual of a different order - an entity who is not liable to institutionalization. From 1963 until about 1969, after the publication of Silent Spring, the chemical industry offered a vast array of \"expert studies\", each claiming to be the \"definite analysis\" on pesticides, in an attempt to debunk claims by rival studies. These pluralistic studies seemed to be divided into two main perspectives. The first held that federal pesticide policy inadequately deals with mounting human healh and environmental dangers and therefore requires major revisions. The other held that \"public fears about pesticides are misplaced\" because the \"alleged hazards\" are \"miniscule, compared to the benefits\", and 36 Based on a letter written to Houghton MBlh, publisher of Silent Spring, from Velsicol Chemical Company (who also produced herbicides for distribution wer Vietnam) when they discovered their two main chemical products, chlordane and heptachlor, were criticized in Carsons soon-t&-published book. After the letter from Velsicol, the publisher independently conducted its own toxicological investigation and confirmed Carson's information. Velsicol then dropped its threatened lawsuit, which was aimed at stoping the public from have access to the information in Silent Spring. (Silent Spring, p.49)."},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO no overhaul is necessary. The result of these dualistic sqaubbles, both purposely aimed at the public at the same time, was to put the public into a state of chronic indecision, muddling public understanding of the real stakes involved in the issue. Science became fbrther politicized. To make matters worse for the chemical industry, President Kennedy appointed an independent Science Advisory Committee, outside the influence of the National Academy of Science (NAS) and the National Research Council (NRC), to examine the issue of pesticide regulation. The President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) recommended a series of administrative and legal changes that cumulatively had the potential of tightening regulation ,beginning with stronger action-forcing mechanisms linked to the notion of agency coordination and cooperation. The PSAC found that the Federal Pest Control Review Board (FRCRB) had been inadequate for the task at hand, and that FRCRB objections to USDA mass spraying programs had failed to mitigate the devestating effect on the environment. The PSAC determined that more research, both on the effects of pesticides and on non-chemical control technologies, was essential, as was a federal monitoring program to track the sale, production and use of the vast quantities of chemicals applied each year. One of the provisions of FIFRA was that pesticides must be registered even if the FDA filed a protest at the apparent safety of a chemical. These so-called \"protest registrations\" were considered by PSAC to be a loophole without merit. The PSAC acknowledged \"the social benefits\" of pesticide use - a conclusion that did not surprise environmentalists. Proponents of stricter federal regulation used the PSAC report to support the widely held contention that the USDA was ill-suited for pesticide regulation. The PSAC proposed that the FDA register all pesticides used for non-agricultural purposes. Since the line between agricultural and non-agricultural chemicals was thin, the PSAC proposal constituted a threat to USDA and agricultural appropriation subcommittee power over pesticide policy. Based on the publication of Silent Spring, the PSAC report and subsequent reports from the NAS and NRC, released in 1962, legislators in Congress perceived statutory reform to be the answer to apparent regulatory shortcomings. In fact, between 1963 and 1964, Congress held almost a dozen separate committee or subcommittee hearings on pesticide matters. Six bias emerged in the House in 1963 and three in the Senate. The reform proposals either sought to eliminate loopholes in FIFRA and strengthen federal regulation, or demanded advance USDA consultation with the Department of the Interior and the HEW on all registrations and pest control programs. Unfortunately, true change could only come from within the well entrenched committees on agriculture - a fact that was very apparent to proponents of reform. Federal agricultural officials balked at proposals that tightened the more gaping holes in the regulatory framework. The Senate Bill S 1605, proposed by Ribicoff and Pearson, provided that \"trade secrets\" and chemical formulas be kept secret, but allowed for public access to health and safety data. This was a rather empty proposal, as health and safety data was based on data provided by the manufacturer. Manufacturer data could not be trusted to accurately reflect the true nature"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO of compounds, since the very existence of companies depended on the sale of those products. For a company to claim a product was dangerous would be a conflict of interest. This basic fact of life - conflict of interest - has never been adequately addressed, as it chips away at the very structure and existence of corporate control of economies and the control of the population therein. The Senate passed RibicofF s bill intact in October 1963, but the House Committee on Agriculture immediately tightened dissemination of information in line with USDA and industry efforts to preserve the status quo. The House version eventually became law. Despite all the Congressional meanderings purporting to control the excesses of the government, incidents continued to occur. In late 1963 the State of Louisiana called in the Public Health Service to investigate a massive fish kill downstream fiom a Velsicol Chemical plant in Memphis. It published a report in March 1964 indicating that the cause was a chemical called endrin released fiom the Velsicol plant. In an attempt to divert attention fiom Velsicol, HEW Secretary Anthony Celebreze called a multi-state conference \"to determine the cause(s) of the accident\", despite the fact that the PHs had already determined the singular cause as being a release of endrin fiom Velsicol. The USDA began an \"in~estigation~~ of its own, and in June 1964 announced findings that mysteriously contradicted the PHs analysis. According to the USDA, \"none of the evidence was scientifically adequate to just% withdrawal of endrin, aldrin or dieldrin fiom farm use.\"37 Velsicol executives charged the PHs with \"gross error7', despite the fact that the PHs investigation of the mass fish kill and the Velsicol discharge was legitimate. The fact that Senator Everett Dirkson (R-Ill.) also condemned the PHs for \"wild accusations that unjustly crucified Velsicol and the chemical industry in general\" made it obvious in whose pocket the Senator resided. In 1969, the Mrak Report was released. It was a comprehensive study of pesticides and their impact on the environment. The report recommended against blanket suspension of pesticides, but concluded that there was adequate evidence concerning potential hazards to man and the environment to require corrective action. The report called for a phased elimination over two years of all but \"essential\" uses of DDT, and recommended a national shift away fiom all persistent pesticides. Of course, this did not stop exportation of DDT to Third World countries and subsequent return of contaminated products to the United States. More than 79% of DDT production went for export. Canada had already banned DDT and other nations were following suit. The Mrak panel advocated changing the \"zero tolerance'' clause in the 1958 Delaney Amendment, making the strange statement that \"rapid technological advances made the idea of zero residues simple untenable.\" They argued that a single government agency should insure effective monitoring of the total environment, but stopped short of recommending specific shifts in existing agency jurisdictions. This recommendation would later form the cognitive basis for the creation of the EPA. Another important development to note was that Congress in 1969 passed the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which required that federal \" U.S. House of Representatives,USDA Appropriations FY1965,88th Congress, 2nd see, 1964, p.437. 410"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO agencies must consider environmental actions before undertaking new actions. NEPA created a cabinetolevel Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) to develop national environmental policies. NEPA created the concept of the environmental impact statement. Between 1969 and 1970, 3 1 separate proposals to either ban certain pesticides or rework federal regulation of pesticides were referred to the House Committee on Agriculture. No action occurred beyond hearings. In 1970, more than 13 separate environmental organizations were registered, including the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) formed in 1970 by several northeastern lawyers. By 1971, almost 70 environmental organizations had established offices in Washington. In 1970, the Sierra Club v Hickel case established the concept of \"class action\", allowing plantiffs to file on behalf of entire sectors of society, even if those represented knew nothing about the dispute.Unfortunately, the courts have ahvays sided with the pesticide producers and the USDA, again indicating that another higher-level agenda is present within the issue.38 In December 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) came into being, with a singular goal of protecting the environment. This role would automatically bring it into conflict with other agencies who were fronts for various agenda that did not consider the environment or the health of the population. The EPA's first administrator was William D. Ruckelshaus. It is interesting that after the creation of the EPA, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed suit in federal court to require that the EPA cancel the organochlorine chemicals aldrin and dieldrin. The EPA, however, still depended on Congress for hnding - that was its weak point, as Congress was loaded with those in the pocket of the chemical and agricultural industries. This would be the major oversight that would effectively render the EPA useless. Succeeding administrators, chosen by Presidents more closely allied with U.S. Intelligence agencies, would continue to subvert the EPA internally over the next two decades, rendering it impotent. The same procedure was carried out at the PHs, the FDA and other federal agencies that could conceivably have an impact on the hidden agenda which augmented the coiporate and military- industrial infrastructure of first the United States, and then the planet as a whole. Why a Ban on a Chemical is not a Ban on a Chemical The apparent ban on DDT was filled with myriad loopholes. The announcement of intent to cancel DDT applied only to uses stated in the ban, not a ban on the chemical itself - which is what the public was led to believe. Secondly, the ban applied only to certain products in interstate commerce. Cancellation of a specific use for a chemical under the impotent FlFRA forced the manufacturer only to indicate forbidden uses on the label, but the product itself remained on the market. Farmers were encouraged to use DDT on crops not designated for DDT under pretense of buying it for crops where its use 38 As you might have guessed from the initial presentation in this chapter of incidents involving phenoxy herbicides, environmenal legislation and political activity relative to herbicides and pesticides really accomplished nothing in the en4 for the USDA and other federal agencies became even more involved in mass spraying programs, deeply affecting the environment, watersheds and population."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO was permitted. When you consider that the USDA was the \"enforcer\" of such \"bans\", it is not surprising that no efective policy was possible to limit the mass spraying programs and uses of chemical pesticides and herbicides by the government on the land and population of the United States. Announcement of cancellation of a product does not immediately stop the use of products if the manufacturer objects. EPA suspension of the actual manufacture or use of a product does not prohibit sale of that product. Cancellation processes set long appeal processes into motion that were originally designed to protect the manufacturer from the possibility of capricious bureaucratic action. In addition, each separate use for a chemical was guaranteed a separate appeal. For DDT, it would have meant over 300 separate legal proceedings. Though manufacturers had to establish both the efficacy (use~lness) and safety of a product during initial registration (which in itself is a conflict of interest built into the system by corrupt politicians in the pocket of the industry who crafted the legislation), in cancellation proceedings the burden of proof is paradoxically shzfid to the federal government. Each use, in essence, was considered innocent until proven guilty, and manufacturers can continue to produce and sell the product until all appeals are exhausted - a process that could take years. As a result, the EPA had to compromise on its original mission to protect the environment and came under the influence of the chemical industry and its webwork of legislative constraints. After the Supreme Court decision in Union Carbide v. Costle in 1981 which ruled that the public has a right of access to data on chemicals, industry lobbyists swarmed over Washington with proposals to either eliminate public access completely to chemical data or narrow disclosure substantially. The EPA worked a compromise with the chemical industry, allowing the public to look at \"selected data\" without the ability to copy it. The chemical industry sought to expand the definition of \"trade secretsy' to include both all new chemicals and the analytical tests used to determine toxicity. The implications of this policy are obvious. With no access to chemical data or methods to determine toxicity, the industry would be entirely free to release newly developed neurotoxins with absolute abandon. Under these proposals, the EPA would have the power to define the word \"new\" as applied to the chemical under consideration.

According to research, exposure to repeated doses may overcome the ability of the human body to detoxifL or eliminate the active chemicals in malathion enough to prevent adverse effects [neurotoxic] fiom occurring. Estimates were that repeated spraying would depress AChE levels in individuals as much as 20%. Malathion breaks down into malaoxon, which is more toxic than malathion. Experimental studies have shown that male reproductive systems can be affected. Studies in rats have shown testicular atrophy.

On July 25, 1986, the EPA released a 53-page document entitled ?Lists of Chemicals Used as Inert Ingredients in Pesticides.\" The list included 1282 entries, though some 296 were deleted awaiting further review. Some of the inert5 were included on more specific lists, which EPA released simultaneously. List 1, or \"Inerts of Toxicological Concern,\" induded 57 items. List 2, called lnerts With a High Priority for Testing,\" numbered 62 chemicals. List 4, 'Minimum Risk Inerts; amounted to 271 entries, of which 160 did not appear on the 53-page list. List 3 was not specifically identified, so the remaining 1052 items were assumed to be List 3. EPA first published its inerts policy as an April 22, 1987 Federal Register Notice, which also updated some of the lists. List 1 was presented with the same name and same number of items, although not all the chemicals listed were the same. List 2, renamed 'Potentially Toxic InerWHigh Priority for Testing,\" now numbered 67 chemicals. While no List 4 was printed in this document, it was referred to as \"Minimal Hazard or Risk,\" and said to amount to about 300 items. List 3 is mentioned as including 'approximately 800 inerts\" that have 'no basis for listing ... on any of t&e other three lists.\" Updates to the lists appeared in EPA's November 22, 1989 Federal Register Notice on inerts. List 1 was changed to include only 40 items. List 2 had 62 entries, but was corrected in the June 29, 1990 Federal Register to read differently, and therefore had 64 entries. List 4, still un- published, was changed. The previously released List 4 was now referred to as List 4q while a new List 4B was created. List 4B was not given a title, but included 2 items that EPA believed under 'current use patterns ... will not adversely affect public health and the environment.\" List 3, never published nor released in any coherent form, nonetheless received some modifications, as well as a new name, -Inerts of Unknown Toxicity.\" On November 19, 1990, EPA released the 296 items which they had deleted from the July 25, 1986 53-page list of inerts. In the process, EPA stated this list was not at all 'complete.\" Not only was the 1986 list not complete (as later verified by the July 23, 1991 release of a new 'complete\" inerts list), but the list had a number of duplicate entries, incorrect matching5 of chemical names and Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers, and other errors. As noted he, the EPA released a new 'completem List of inerti on July 23, 1991. Unlike the 1986 list, EPA claims this list only includes items which are indeed found in a registered pesticide product. The 1986 list purported only to TdentifL chemicals that are used or may have been used as inert ingredients.\" The, 1991 list, with 1820 entries, is substantially larger than the previously released inerts lists combined (ie., the 1986 \"complete\" list of 1282 items, plus the 160 items on List 4 that did not appear on the 1986 list, for an old total of 1442 inerts.) The 1991 list claims to be 'inclusive of previously published Lists 1, 2, and 4, as well as those inerts which were to be compiled as List 3.\" But many items from previous lists are not includ- ed on this new List because EPA believes they no longer occur in any pesticide .formulation.

Dear Mr. Minister, 1 May 1981 During the week of 6 April 1981, a detachment of 100 Anti-narcotics Police, under the command of Capt. Luis Enrique Flores moved into the Alto Guajim in search of marijuana and other drugs. To accomplish this, Capt. Flores did not hesitate to abuse, torture, rob, loot, destroy private property, illegally enter and in general abuse his authority. (A brief description of robbery and looting follows.) Besides the priviouly mentioned excesses, in countless Indian huts, police robbed or simply killed their animals. thereby taking away the source of livelihood and sub- sistence. This particulary affected the poorest people. The police's zeal to find the marijuana did not en- counter any obstacles to obtaining information. Yet, abuse and violence were used on the population. When one policeman was asked how he was able to wm- municate with the people, given that many Indians do not speak Spanish, he responded that it was no problem because \"after a going over with a rifle butt, almost all of them learn Spanish.\" There were cases of individuals who were beaten with rifle butts until they vomited blood. There was also a case in which police placed a grenade in a youngster's pocket to persuade that person to talk. An unfortunate coincidence made these incidents even more serious. The police action coincided with Easter LOMOTIL - An effective anti-diarrheal medicine sold by prescription in the US. Doses slightly above the recommended level, however, can be fatal. In the Sudan. the drug was sold over the counter in containers boasting that it was \"used by astronauts during Gemini and Apolio space flights.\" It was also recommended for children as young as 12 months. PANALBAIALBAMYCIN-T - A combination an- tibiotic, first marketed by Upjohn in 1957. By 1968. sales from this product totalled $18 million, or 12 per- cent of the com~any's gross domestic income. But in 1968. 30 ~ationai ~Eadem~ of Science experts unanimously recommended that panalba, along with 49 other antibiotics, be removed from the US market. Ac- cording to their studies, 20 percent of patients developed allergic reactions to the drug. Twelve pa- tients had already died as a result. By 1970, it was forced off the US market. However. antibiotics are not classified as drugs in the US, which allows the substance to be exported, now under the name of AIbamycin-T, to 33 countries. In Mexico it is recom- mended for urinarv infections; there is no mention of toxicity or side efftkts. PHENACATIN/SOMA/FIORINAL - This drug causes kidney failure which often proves to be fatal. It is sold in Malaysia for such minor ailments as toothaches. flu. and headaches. Week, a period in which many indians return from Venezuela to visit their families in the Guajira. Many of them carry several months of savings with them, along with goods and personal possessions. On 13 April, at the site of Irruwain, near Nazareth, a bus fi lled with Indians and c,argo was looted by the police. Police officers con- fiscated radios, tape recprders, and other possessions from the passengers. This was only one of numerous in- cidents which occurred between the police and bus passengers. The reign of terror is so broad that civil authorities from the area refused to receive cornplaints from the peo- ple, sending them instead to the commander of the military post in Nazareth. Most of those affected did not want their names made public because they were afraid of repression by Capt. flores. Nevertheless, if the no- tional government offers sufficient guarantees to the population, they will be able to obtain the statements necessary to substantiate the accusations made here. Signed by 10 prominent political officials, public health officers, clergy, businessmen, and an anthropologist. The military officer in charge of Colombia's Anti- narcotics Bureau ordered an investigation and subse- quently promised to repay the Indians. Payment has not yet been made and incidents of violence against native people have not diminished. in a letter of 1 October 1981. the signees of the earlier letter wrote detailing several local incidents of violence and mentioning the threats against themselves by Cap tain Flores. This included an attempt by the police to place a small amount of marijuana into the truck of a local merchant. The letter adds that, fortunately for the man, TETUCYCLINE - In industrialized countries, this antibiotic is not used for children under 8 or women more than 4 months pregnant.

VERDIVITON - This drug is restricted in Britain and contra-indicated for anyone with a liver problem. In Bangladesh. where some 50 to percent of the popula- tion suffer from amoebic hepatitis or other ailments of the liver, the drug is contra-indicated for most of the population. It is, however. readily available there without warnings. WINSTROUSTANOZOLOL - A synthetic male hor- mone restricted in the US because it stunted the growth of children. It is intended to be used only for blood disorders in adults. However. the drug is sold over the counter in Brazil where it is recommended as an ap petite stimulant for children. In Mexico it is sold as a tonic. In Malaysia. it is sold to treat weight loss and anorexia for all age groups."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO \"an army corporal was also traveling in the car and spoke out in the face of this farce. Capt. Flores respond- ed. 'If I want to get you in trouble. I'll fill this whole car with marijuana and say that this cargo is yours.' \" It is well known that this is not the first time that the Anti-narcotics Police have provided this type of \"evidence\" against someone. The population justly feels the repression of Captain Flores, who could easily obtain \"evidence\" of arms and drug possessions to take revenge on those who have spoken out against the rob bery, kidnappings, and tortures which the troops at his command have taken place amongst the Guajiros.\" It should be emphasized that the quantities of mari- juana which Colombia exports are normally calculated in terms of shiploads - tons of marijuana bailed into huge bundles, driven in large trucks to waiting ships. and sent by freighter to the United States. Such traffic flows up and down the Guajira peninsula relatively un- interrupted. Those who would try to alter this large scale movement would face heavily armed opposition. The police know this. and it is one of the reasons why the Guajira is considered a no man's land with regard to the control of marijuana traffic. If any Guajira Indians are involved in this traffic. their contribution would be miniscule by comparison. What then is the purpose of this violence against them? Does it serve largely to demonstrate a degree of control while masking the ineffectiveness of large-scale polic- ing activities? If so, are Indians then becoming the scapegoats for a problem which Colombian authorities cannot, will not, or perhaps do not care to resol\\ie? Many argue that the \"cocaine problem\" is not Colom- bia's, but that of the US. One might then expect that chemical control of marijuana production could focus on unarmed Indian cultivators, rather than the large scale producers involved in most international traffic, thereby demonstrating a \"concern for the problem\" without affecting production. The previous CSN in- dicated that, even with limited information. it seemed likely that native peoples would be affected dispropor- tionately by the increasing international use of poisons. Colombia. unfortunately, may provide more evi- dence. E Theodore Macdonald Pesticides and Native People of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia 5 November 1981 Dear Cultural Survival, I appreciate your recent issue of Cultural Swival devoted to Poisons in the Third World. I thought I would call your attention to the dangerous connection between drug control actions involving poisons sprayed from the air and the survival of peripheral p ple of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia, South America. The Sierra is rather well known for the cultivation of marijuana, and recently the US State Department has had under consideration a plan for spraying marihuana plots there. Vigorous ground con- trol programs date from 1978, including the burning of .a reported 24,282 hectares in the Sierra [a remarkably exact figure) and a cost of 146 million dollars annually, but it is estimated that only 15% of the cultivated marihuana was affected. With this as background. the spraying of chemical herbicides has become the focus of a series of discussions and technical papers prepared by \"beltway bandits\" in the DC area. I have seen one of these papers, or at least sections of it that are \"unclassified\" which is to say do not deal with actions proposed. However, a key to the actions is provided by the bibliography to the paper. Referenced are numerous scientific papers dealing with the effects upon fruit trees, cotton, wildlife, fish and aquatic ver- tibrates and pasture grasses and soils of 2.4-D. Glyphosate Herbicide, Paraquat (the most commonly cited) as well as things talled Cationic Herbicides. MON-0573. and Dalapon. From your newsletter I know the effects of 2.4-D. From my reading 1 understand Gly- phosate to be harmful to wildlife, fruit trees, pasture grasses and fish. And we know Paraquat. The text of the paper deals with the location of gardens, housesites and waterways in relation to Indian residence in Sierra Nevada de Santa Mana O Borys Malkin. Anlhro-Photo marihuana plots. My experience in the Sierra (1972-1973) was that secalled marihuana plots are in fact extensions of normal roza. or shifting cultivation. plots in most instances - rarely are they isolated from corn, yucca and bean plots - and while they are not itemized they are contiguous. Of course such plots tend to be located near waterways, from which local in- digenous people as well as mestizo farmers draw drink- ing, cooking and washing water. In short, the policy contained in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1971 of linking continuing foreign assistance to vigorous drug control efforts will lead to the dangerous program now being contemplated for the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. State Department plan- ning and funding of such poison spraying is apparently not yet a fact; but the background work prior to plan- ning is now taking place. Given the Colombian govern- ment's history of accepting whatever drug law enforce ment technology the US provides, and its willingness to attack peasant growers [and their Indian and peasant neighbors who do not grow) rather than wealthy distributors, State Department plans and funds would probably be accepted and implemented. Consequences for indigenous peoples and their mestizo neighbors will be dire, guilt and innocence notwithstanding. I am wondering if mention of this situation and the threat to the indigenous and mestizo farmers of the Sierra it represents would not be good to mention in connection with the series on Poisons. Purposefully poisoning human communities is perhaps even more reprehensible (although less widespread) than acciden- tal poisoning, even if the ends seem worthy to politi- cians and bureaucrats.

Says Dr. Garth Nicholson, \"we have isolated a bacteria called Mycoplasma incognitas through a method called gene trackmg. The good news is that if treated, by a readily available antibiotic, most veterans have been helped. The bad news is that we are finding more and more family members that are contracting the disease from Desert Storm veterans.\" His wife, Dr. Nancy Nicholson, had more to say: \"this could be a holocaust of monumental proportions as it has been genetically enpeered, with roots right here in the Houston area. \"' Who are the Drs.

An Interview with the Drs. Nicholson R= radio station D= Drs. Nicholson R: Last winter, I caught a Houston press conference where a lady in a laboratory smock explained that mycoplasmas are natural components found in all living cells. She continued that she and her husband were doctors that had discovered that the cause of the Gulf War Syndrome (at least a component also contributing to its contagion) was a manmade, artijricial mycoplasma that had \"somehow\" been implanted in the cells of Desert Stoxm veterans.

First, the mycoplasmas that seem to cause GWS are not exactly 'hrtificial,\" but we have scientific evidence that they have been modfled. However. there is a-federal gag order out on this, so you won't hear about it on the normal news. It's frustrating because people need to know they can be helped -- but if they don't know, they are at risk. R: How did you get involved with the Desert Storm syndrome? D: Our daughter served in the 101 st Airborne Division in Iraq, on 'the deep insertions. Like many other vets, she came home with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and a number of associated ailments, including arthritis-like problems with her joints. She had problems with her hearing, vision, memory, headaches, muscle spasms, skin rashes, gastrointestinal problems, and cardiac arrhythmia. All these and a variety of other problems collectively fall under the category of \"Desert Storm Syndrome\" or 'Gulf War Illness.\" Urinary and reproductive problems are also common in women with Gulf War Illness. Severe pregnancy problems, many still births, birth defects, and many of the babies born to Desert Storm Syndrome patients die within a couple years -- tremendous problems in this category. R: This is an amazing array of symptoms. How many people are infected? D: Between 50,000 and 100,000 people. That only includes those registered at the VA Hospitals, not their family members. There may be more. R: Are these soldiers that were in deep insertions? D: Some were on 'Ueep insertions\" and some were behind the lines. For example, some Air Force soldiers decontaminated aircraft that bombed Iraqi chemical and biological weapon storage faci~ities.~ Many of those decontamination soldiers are dead and those still alive are very, very ill. Some are paralyzed. We worked with a 16-member graves registration unit. There's only one member alive, and she's in a wheelchair now and doing very poorly. R: The other 15 died? D: They're all dead. They were handling thousands of bdes, but the government has covered this up and only reported 148 combat deaths.

Mycoplasmas can be transmitted through the air.4 Every place I look, somebody's showing symptoms. We have detected the microorganism. It's very evasive and very infective, very contagious in these Gulf War veterans. The evidence indicates that these mycoplasmas have been tampered with by man. The mycoplasma penetrates the cell and proliferates. It takes pieces of the host's membrane with it so the body is set up for rheumatoid response or thyoiditis and it's a very confounding illness - perfect germ warfare, the last thing you'd expect and very difficult to diagnose. The general medical community is unaware of this - so the more it S kept under wraps, the greater the problem become^.^ The mycoplasmas are deep in each cell's nucleus and have certain DNA sequences that are extremely unusual and it is highly unlikely that these genetic sequences could have gotten into this organism in a way exceDt by man putting them there. One of the DNA sequences includes part of the HIV virus that was inserted into this micro-organism - to 6 make it more danperous and more pathogenic , but that doesn't mean that people with GWS have HIV.. . it's treatable.. . people hear \"AIDS\" and they get really upset. R: Did you study AIDS and the hanta virus? Doesn't their transfer into humans seem so unnatural, that something almost had to be engineered? D: Absolutel~. You only expect a naturally occurring virus to have 'homology': similarities, to other viruses. We look at the DNA sequence of HIV-1 and there's homology to so many different naturally occurring viruses (more than 50), that it doesn 't appear to be a naturally occurring event. The GWS mycoplasma also gives L'AIDS-like\" symptoms because it can also cause immunosuppression. When a patient is imrnuno- suppressed, he's left wide open for a variety of other opportunistic infections and diseases. Patients become more susceptible because they have this underlying mycoplasma infection - which I call 'the great impostor\" and 'beat masquerader\". It hides and manifests itself in some many different ways that most people just treat the symptoms if they don't know that thisparticular organism ispresent. And, it is difficult to detect. We had to go to forensic techniques, but it & detectable and treatable. Some people think the mycoplasma is a co- factor to the MV virus, A person who has HIV and contracts these mycoplasma infections probably won't survive. But, other people who have only the mycoplasma infection can live -- iJthey are given the proper treatment. We have a publication in the Joumal of the American Medical Association on a small study of 73 soldiers who have GWS. Fifty-five of those soldiers recovered afker multiple treatments with the antibiotic Doxycycline. So, we know that there are probably two With Over 100,000 people contaminated, it now is a potential death sentence for the entire population of the United States. The pollution of the air, food and water isn't fast enough to meet Malthusian demands. At this point, what certain factions of the United States technocracy are involved in is genocide of the population of the United States on an even more accelerated basis.

But, it requires several cycles, sometimes years . . . We are told the Iraqis operated under the Soviet War Doctrine. If so, they probably used several infectious and chemical agents. As a result, many of the Gulf War soldiers were heavily exposed to indigenous chemicals and a variety of other agents in the air and clothing. This caused a multiple chemical sensitivity problem. Unfortunately, because of these chemical sensitivities, maw veterans cannot take the powerful antibiotics needed to help them. because they react against them like they are foreim chemicals - so, we have a double problem with those soldiers. R: Do Doxycycline or Sibrofloxin actually kill the mycoplasma, or do they just \"put it to sleep\"? D: You will cany the mycoplasma for the rest of your lije, but whether you relapse depends on your own immune system. The earlier you get the antibiotics the better chance you have of not relapsing. The longer you possess the illness, the harder it is to get rid of it. R: How did you discover the antibiotics? D: (Nancy Nicholson) I almost died from the illness in 1987. I had all the symptoms. I went down to 70 pounds. I was partially paralyzed, my thyroid was affected, I had encephalitis, meningitis -- I had just about everything. I didn't think I was going to make it. I had a near death experience - which people can mock - I was told I wasn't going to die but I had better promise that when I get better, if I ever heard of anyone else sick in the future, I had better speak out, even if it meant putting myself up to danger and ridicule. So, I try and keep that word. About that time, we tried Doxycycline. R: How did you come across that? D: An article in the New York Times called 'Mycoplasma Incognitos\" listed all my symptoms, so I called the author, Dr. Shiloh, who was at the Anned Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington. He never told me (and I didn't find out until much later) that he had been worhng in my own deparbnent at Baylor College of Medicine - but oflsite.' So, at this time he was very open (except about having worked at oust on*). In 1987, he tested me and said that I had it, so that's how we found out. Then, in 1992, when out daughter came back from Desert Storm with an almost identical illness - that was a big tip-off. So, because Dr. Shiloh had given me so many clues several years before Desert Storm, we were able to figure out what they had done. - 7 Which is where Nancy Nicholson probably contracted the disease at the Baylor lab.

D: Harassing those who are tying to help. Mostly, denying there's even a problem. They have put out a lot of misinformation indicating these veterans have 'post traumatic stress syndrome\" and \"other emotionalproblems\" unrelated to disease, when in fact they have real, physical problems. Some of them are in wheel chairs, some are paralyzed. You cannot imagine the range of different diseases. We have found that Chronic Fatigue S'drome is an infectious disease possibly caused by mycoplasmas. R: What is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?

There are also documented immunologic problems. In extreme cases, encephalitis and meningrtis can develop, and some soldiers get false idcations of auto-immune disease like multiple sclero~is.~ The problem is International. Scientists were imprisoned in the Midde East for not going along with the germ wai$are. I've experienced a ten-year character assassination, professional assassination in my work. I cannot just@ any of this with science. It's evil, that 's all I can tell you. It 's a spiritual battle.

It's latency period depends on the immune system of the individual.

Eugenics Programs Since the 1940's Admitted by Department of Justice One of my close friends, a Director of Special Investigations in the Justice Department, has confinned that there have been secret eupenics directives in prominent East coast laboratories since the late 1940's. I've had corroboration from scientists who were on some of these projects, so it's a horrzfiing thought. But, I cannot explain it any other way, that people should be so callous with our soldiers. Every other experiment that's been done since the late 1940's involved soldiers. For some reason, the people who give these orders think they are immune to the disease and can escape it. But, someone might carry the infection and not feel anything, or not have any symptoms, and then pass it on to the next generation, or come down with it 10 years later. Probably, nab+ is immune. Evidence of Prisoner Testing of GWS Mycoplasmas And, now you don't have to be a soldier to get sick. Because the mycoplasmas are contagious, we 're talking about civilians. We're working with some prison personnel at the Huntsville group, headed by Sally Meadly. They had an array of symptoms similar to those that we're seeing in the Desert Storm vets. In Huntsville prison, is there are several hundred people affected and diagnosed with anything fiom MS to ALS.\" U%en I'd done their profile using our genetic tracking, the profile was very similar. A couple of years ago, there was an unusual outbreak of an illness in Palestine, Texas where there's also a prison facility. They hushed that up, but we were able to talk to the physician, and he did use Doxycycline. Biological Blowback That connection between Desert Stom Syndrome and prisoner illnesses helped us start to piece together dupliczties and the spider web of connections between politics and science. High level people got sick, so they started leaking information to us. We put it together, because after we helped many people who were high level military intelligence and Delta Forces - and my own experience of most likely having been in the department where the work was initiated -- we were able to piece the information together. R: Could the \"ebola\" flesh-eating bacteria in Africa be a biological warfare agent? D: All of a sudden, all these illnesses are cropping up. I can't prove it, but its highly suspicious that there was an outbreak of Ebola in West Virginia. That is what the move 'O A neurological denenerative disorder also called Lou Gehrig's Disease. 429"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO 'Outbreak\" was about. Knowing what I know from people who worked at Fort Detrick and who are high up in the agencies nothing would surprise me because of the amount of genetic tampering. I strongly suspect there's been tampering with the Leprosy bacteria and with anthrax gene sequences. So, although we can only speculate, you have to assume there may be tampering with anything that is deadly. None of this has been exposed in the media because there is practically a news blackout on this. Both my wife and I have given interviews for major news networks, but they have been pulled. It's very frustrating, because we wanted to help everyone. You have to draw the line at political agendas - the welfare of the people should be ~rimarv. particularly our soldiers . . . it 's a tremendous betrayal. l1 R: Why would the government suppress this information? Is the cover-up to help make these \"world police actions\" seem more palatable to the American people? D: It 'sprobably more serious than that. We can only speculate, but in the 1 ate 1960's, we passed federal laws banning the development and deployment of biological weapons. We ratified international treaties in the early 1970's essentially banning the use of biological weapons.12 Unfortunately our biological development has probably gone on unimpeded even afler signing those treaties. But, we didn't know enough amount the cells to begin with -- that's why these experiments are completely ill-advised. Dr. Paul Burg won the Nobel Prize and advised against these experiments in the early 1970's. They literally excluded him from the loop and went 111 speed ahead on the recommendations of Dr. Joshua Letterburg and Dr. James Watson - who had very unusual agemhs in relation to the Human Genome Project. We believe that the Human Genome Prqiect-Tunneled a bunch ofmonev - that should have pone -for basic research -for medical benefits - into makina destructive weqons and bioloPica1 warfme research. It's contemptible. We don't know about how our cells work, and these people never should have played God. It goes against everything that we, as a people, stand for. But, there's also the question offinancial liability. If people that were exposed to these biological weapons canprove they were exposed, there's a certain amount of civil liability. Remember the Agent Orange problem of Vietnam? Every veteran exposed to Agent Orange (dioxin compound) had one heck of a time txying to convince the government that they were ill. Because of that court battles bagged out for toyears or more. \" Now, who would want to betray the people and military of the United States, yet be ~0~e~te.d to the highest levels of U.S. Government and the intelligence agencies? I am sure you have an idea, and the connections with the past three presidential administrations. '' As pointed out elsewhere in Matrix III Vol2, the United States also signed a genocide treaty, but only with the provision and caveat that no nation could ever sit in judgement of the United States. This now allows genocide to be perpetrated without fear of retribution. It is remarkably similar to something the Nazis would do during World War 11, and uses the same deceptive logic.

So, b~ keepinp - this disease under wrws, the government virtua1Iv marantees that the contapion will mread? D: That's true -- they're still handling it just like they handled Agent Orange. R: If Iraq used biological weapons in the Gulf War, where did Iraq get the necessary research hta?

However, it seems that everybe was involved Mina Bachoff is Moscow's Administrator for the human genome project, so you have Russia involved; the United States is involved leading the west; you have Iraq; the United Kingdom; Israel was involved -- everybody, everybody. However, not too many people worked on mycoplasmas for the last 20 years so it's easy to trace who was doing the research. R: Then how did Iraq get that biological weapon? Is it possible that the United States or a close ally is responsible for unleashing this disease? D: Ok, let's speculate. We strongly suspect that the mycoplasma's that we've detected in Gulf War veterans were probably 'hodified\" in this country, in Houston, and sold illegally to the Iraqis. R: That's why the government is not going to talk? D: Correct. It's very interesting that two weeks before Desert Storm, the US. Commerce Department put a hold on all mycoplasmas or genetically modified mycoplasmas for shipment to the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission - which tells us they had alred shiv~ed it.

However, the French help their soldiers exposed to the Gulf War illness. They wrote to us and said they knew about the antibiotics but they were diplomatically tied. We've helped the British. Both Nancy and I were on BBC. The story is not being covered up in Britain. In Australia we were on television. We've been on TV in Italy because the Vatican is very concerned about this, particularly the Pope, who in his splendor of truth wrote that certain acts are inherently evil and this is one of them.

You know, we wish we could stay totally away fiom the politics, but it impacts on everything. R: What kind of \"political agenda\" are you facing now? D: We can only hypothesize, but it appears that although American soldiers were victims of biologcal and chemical warfie, the official government line is that no chemical or biologicals were used against our soldiers. Unfortunately, it doesn't look that way, and to keep that official line going, they have to deny that out soldiers are sick - and that's just what they are doing.

Likewise, it a government cover-up to shield Bush and his associates is condemning thousands, perhaps millions of American citizens to the same disease ... it is hard to imagrne the kind offirestorm that is coming. Iraq Admits Production of Biowarfare Substances The Iraqi government admitted in July 1995 that they produced biowarfare weapons.I5 According to the admission: 'Iraq has admitted for the first time that it secretly produced deadly bacteria before the 1991 Persian Gulf War in sufficient quantity to kill millions of people. A remote desert factory produced an immense quantity of the bacteria that cause botulism and anthrmc.16 However, Iraq denies using these substances as germ warfare agents in the Gulf War, but maintains they were preparing to use germ warfare prior to the Gulf War.\" l4 The Spotlight, July 3, 1995. Is Dallas Morning News, July 6, 1995. l6 The fact that members of the U.S. military were forced to be injected with experimental anthrax and botulism vaccines, proves the government knew about the Iraqi biowarfae program well in advance of the war. The war itself was a directive from the Rothschilds, who own the Kuwati oil fields, to have Bush remove the Iraqi's from the region. Bush is also believed to have had investments in the area. 433"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO - - iNBC News Reports on Chemical and Biological Weapons Used on US Soldiers in the Gulf War by lraq On October 13th at 9:OOpm Tom Browkaw, on NBS Newsmagazine program \"Now\", did a series on apparent chemical and biological weapons use on United States military personnel by Iraq during Operation Desert Storm.

My oral statement is based upon the report we are issuing today, ODeration Desert Storm: Ouestions Remain on Possible Ex~osure to Reproductive Toxicants. I ask that it and my prepared statement be included in $he record of this hearing at the conclusion of my oral remarks. Since their return from the war in the Persian Gulf, many veterans have complained of a variety of health problems including reports of an increased number of birth defects and other reproductive problems. It,is now known that before, during, and after the war, U.S. troops were exposed to a very wide variety of potentially hazardous substances. These include but are not limited to the following: diesel fuel used as a dust suppressant at encampments, smoke from the burning of human and other waste with fuel oil, shower.water contaminated with fuel, investigational drugs and vaccines to protect against chemical and biological weapons, pesticides and insect repellents, and the smoke from the oil-well fires at the end of the war. My testimony today, and our report, is focused on the potential for reproductive effects from these and other substances. The work we did was in response to questions the Chairman posed to us this past January. I summarize those questions and our responses as follows. ASSESSMENTS OF REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS BEFORE THE WAR First, What assessments were performed before the gulf war to determine the potential for exposure to reproductive toxicants? We found that the assessment process that the Department of Defense (DOD) uses for reproductive toxicants was incomplete. During DOD's material acquisition process for equipment, it performs general health hazard assessments that may identify reproductive toxicants, and it relied on .the Environmental Protection Agency's normal processes for screening pesticides used in the gulf war. However, not included in DOD's assessments were potential reproductive effects from various individual compounds present in the working environment of deployed troops and from the possible synergistic effects of exposure to combinations of hazards. These potential effects are currently unknown. REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS PRESENT DURING THE WAR Second, What reproductive toxicants, if any, did DOD actually identify? We found that the DOD's health hazard assessment process generally endeavors to identify potential reproductive toxicants that are internal to the weapon system"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO development process. However, in addition, we found several reproductive toxicants that were external to that process and that were not identified by DOD. These included reproductive toxicants from the oil-well fires. We found a total of 21 reproductive toxicants (listed in appendix I at the end of my statement). All these substances were, of course, known to be present in the gulflregion, and prior scientific research had identified them as potential reproductive toxicants. However, up to this point, it has not been pointed out that these specific substances present in the gulf region are known reproductive toxicants and that an unknown but potentially large number of U.S. troops were exposed to them. However, we did not ascertain cause-and-effect relationships between exposure to these 21 toxicants and reproductive dysfunctian reported by veterans of the war. Also, the concentration levels of these compounds are unknown and so are the exposure rates: for specific units. EDUCATION AND PROTECTION AFFORDED TROOPS DURING THE WAR Third, What protection and education were provided to military personnel to avoid reproductive toxicants during the war? We found none directed specifically at reproductive toxicants. However, some activities covered by DOD directives to protect against other hazards may have also minimized exposure to the reproductive toxicants present. Yet, as we reported earlier, some of the protective facilities, equipment, and training were not adequate. DOD did provide some guidance to troops on the toxic hazards of the oil-well fires. However, because these fires were unanticipated and widespread, it was not possible to adequately protect service members from them. This is important because we found that several substances in the oil-well fires are known reproductive toxicants. I MONITORING FOR REPRODUCTIVE DYSFUNCTION AFTER THE WAR Fourth, How are veterans now being monitored for reproductive dysfunction? On this point, we found several major shortcomings involving certain ongoing and planned studies as well as the Veterans Affairs (VA) and DOD registries. 'u.s. General Accounting Office, O~eration Desert Storm: Army Not Adeauatelv PreDared to Deal With DeDleted Uranium Contamination, GAOINSIAD-93-90 (Washington, D.C.: January 1993), and U.S. General Accounting Office, Chemical Warfare: Soldiers Inadeauatelv Eaui~ved and Trained to Conduct Chemical Omrations, I GAOINSIAD-91-19? (Washington, D.C. : May 1991). I"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO To begin with, monitoring has not addressed all forms of reproductive dysfunction. For example, the VA registry examinations did question veterans about birth defects and whether women were pregnant while in the gulf, but the registry did not cover other issues such as infertility, miscarriage, and additional possible forms of reproductive dysfunction. The VA has recently decided to revise its rebistry questionnaire to include questions on infertility and miscarriage. However, the VA has not decided whether the 20,000 veterans who have already responded to the earlier, less complete, questionnaire will be queried. If they are not, it is possible that data will not be collected from the very veterans who are most likely to have had adverse reproductive health effects. Also, a study conducted jointly by the VA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Mississippi State Department of Health assessed a high rate of birth defects reported by reserve units in Mississippi. As described to us, this unfinished study concludes to date that there was not an abnormally high incidence of birth defects among this group compared to a group consisting of the overall population of the Atlanta metropolitan area and similar data from California and Iowa. One of our concerns regarding this study is the possible lack of comparability between a group of military reservists and the population of urban areas such as Atlanta. While the CDC data constitute a standard set accepted among experts, it is reasonable to question whether the Mississippi reservists might have been a healthier set of individuals than the general population found in urban areas such-as Atlanta. In this case, the Mississippi reservists would be expected to have a lower rate of birth defects than the rate predicted from the Atlanta comparison base rather than an equivalent rate. A second concern is that the small size of the Mississippi group makes it difficult to detect differences in rates of birth defects unless they are of fairly large magnitude.

I RECOMMENDATIONS 1 Based on our work, we have four recommendations. 1 First, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should direct that I the VA use its revised and expanded questionnaire to reregister I the 20,000 veterans who have already had a VA registry examination. Second, the Secretary of Defense, working in concert with the Envir~nmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services, should ensure that DOD makes additional I scientific inquiry into the possible synergistic effects of multiple exposures to hazards found in the Persian Gulf. Third, the Secretary of Defense should explore approaches to collecting baseline data on birth outcomes, infertility, and miscarriage rates among active duty and reserve military personnel so that these data are available for future studies. I This information should also include baseline data on exposure levels to ascertain when exposures of reproductive toxicants rise to dangerous levels in future conflicts. Fourth, DOD should develop procedures to better ensure that troops are informed of possible reproductive toxicants before 1 future deployments and to monitor exposure levels to such I hazards. 1 That concludes my testimony, Mr. Chairman; I will be happy I to answer any questions you or the members of the Committee may have."},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Appendix I This appendix lists potential reproductive and developmental toxicants GAO found to be present in the Persian Gulf area of U.S. armed forces deployment during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

Within one year American phvsicists were using X-rays in clinical medicine. What were physicists doing in clinical medicine? The production and use of X-ray machines was undertaken mostly by electrical engineers, without any standards, and no one realized the true damaging potential of X-rays on human tissue until 1896, when the New York Medical Record published accounts of hair loss, lesions and reddened skin that sloughed off So, here we have it established that within one year of the discovery of X-ravs, it was known that it aficted human tissue neaativelv.

This raises the question, if it was known to be so harmfbl, why was it continued? [Ed. Remember Malthus? Increasing the mortality rate of the non-elite?] By the 1930 's, so many people had fallen victim to the misuse of X-ray's that a book, American Martyrs to Science Through the Roentgen Rays, was published by Dr. Percy Brown, a Boston radiologist who himself died of cancer in 1950.~ As is seen by the footnote, this book was published in 1936.

Forty percent of credentiaied operators failed tests given them. Later in 1981, Congress passed a law requiring states to establish federally apprwed programs for training and licensing operators.

In 1973 the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute cosponsored the establishment of 27 Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Projects with the goal of \"examining\" 250,000 women. The entire program was repeated each year for five years. In 1977, Dr. John C. Bailer I11 published an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine warning that the Health Insurance plan study, which had 'brompted so much faith in mammography,'\"ad not in fact demonstrated a increase in survival rates among the women under 50 who had been given the X-ray radiation In fact, Dr. Irwin Bross and Leslie Blumenson of Rowel1 Park Memorial Laboratory in Buffalo estimated in 1977 that, based on dosage levels, twice as many deaths as cures could result porn breast cancer \"screenings. \" Bross called the whole program \"a disastrous mistake that would produce the worst epidemic of cancer in medical history.\" At a meeting sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, Bross accused the American Cancer Society and the American College of Radiology of \"subjecting 250,000 American women to X-ray dosages equivalent to death warrants with a I5-year delay in execution.\" Radiation Dosage of Unborn Children Two months after Wilhelm Roentgen's 1895 discovery of X-ray radiation, the first X-ray picture of a fetus in utero was taken. It became common practice to use X-rays to detect multiple births or abnormal conditions of the fetus, and the practice of dosing unborn childen with rdation continued for 60 years. It was not until the mid-1950's that the first survey was done on the effect of X-rays ion unborn children. In 1955, a statistician at the University of Oxford in Britain, David Hewitt, noted that in the few years before 1955 there had been more than a 50% increase in the number of British children dying of leukemia. ARer persuading health officials to interview the mothers of over 1,600 children who had died of cancer in the previous two years (using an equal number of healthy mothers and children as controls), a cause for the excess cancers emerged. The mothers of the children who had cancer has received pelvic X-rays while they were pregnant. Obviously, neither the nuclear industry or the medical community appreciated this revelation. One of the health officials who conducted the study in Britain, a Dr. Stewart, came under criticism and lost her funding at Word. Despite this, Stewart kept on working, and in 1958 concluded that a fetus exposed in the first 90 days of development was ten times more likely to develop cancer than an unexposed fetus.

Spurred on by the work of Stewart, the Harvard School of Public Health conducted a study of 700,000 children born between 1947 and 1964 in 37 major maternity hospitals in the northeastern United States. Dr. Brian MacMahon, who headed the study, found that cancer mortality was 40% higher among children with mothers who had been dosed with radiation. In 1963, MacMahon told a committee hearing conducting an investigation into atomic bomb testing fallout in Utah that 'he must consider very seriously the possibility of cancer production by lm doses of radiation such as encountered in X-ray diagnosis and fallout.' Now, despite the 1963 warning to Congress, all the studies conducted previously, and all the knowledge that the government itself had accumulated about the hazards of nuclear radiation in any form, little was done to notzjj the public about the effect of medical radiation on the unborn fetus for an amazing Byears. The year 1970 was the last year in which the federal government analyzed X-ray records on a national scale. In that year, it found that 23% of the 3.5 million pregnant women in the United States-some 800,000 women-were exposed to X-rays. In 1975, a study of 68,000 single deliveries estimated that pelvic X-rays were given in 4,500 cases. A 1 976 telephone survey in New York indicated that women of childbearing age were ofien not asked beforehand if they were pregnant. Estimates in 1982, during the administration of ex-CIA director Bush, it was still estimated that at leat 6% of all pregnant women are dosed with pelvic radzation, despite the fact that the Bureau of Radiological Health and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists launched a campaign two years earlier in 1980 to begin to warn the public of the dangers of drugs and radiation on the unborn child. The funds for this public education program were reduced each year after it began New Toys - New Radiation Dosage Programs The use of radiation on humans adds to the income of doctors and medical institutions. Much of the newer technology, which is very expensive and requires much usage in order to reap a return on investment, involves hannfid radiation. For instance, the advent of computerized axial tomography (CAT) scanning introduced a powerfbl new source of radiation, ranging as high as 4,500 millirems for some scans. By the early 1 98OYs, more than 2,000,000 Americans underwent CAT scans each year. These machines are not only used for 'Scans': They are also used for radiation 'therapy\", which can run as high as $36,000 per year. 7 Fallout, Radiation Standards and Countermeasures, U.S. Congress, Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, Subcommittee on Research, Development and Radiation, August 20-22,27, 1963,p.595."},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Add Another Carcinogenic Inducement to the Dentist's Office As if the use of mutagenic fluorides and mercury amalgam in the dentist office wasn't enough, the use of dental X-ray radiation on patients increases the predisposition toward denegerative systemic diseaase. Radiation can create mutations in cells which the fluorides can then activate into full blown cancer. Fluoride is a known cancer activator. The average skin does per dental X-ray film is about 910 millirems, nearly three times the whole-body dose fiom background radiation. A full mouth series can involve 16 or more individual exposures and can deliver a substantial doese of radiation to the mouth cavity and bone structure. A survey done in 1976 in New York found that 89% of dentists ordinarily included a full set of mouth X-rays during a patients first visit. Nearly 50% of the dentists repeated X-rays of the mouth at least once a year. In 1981, the National Council on Health Care Technology Conference on Dental Radiology agreed that dentists reply too much on X-rays. The Chest X-Ray Program The presence of tuberculosis originally provided an excuse to dose men, women and children with radiation to look for it. However, as early as 1965 the Public Health Service called for an end to routine chest X-rays as a means of detecting TB, because TB was on the decline. Interestingly, the Public Health Service admitted in 1965 that 95% of the ~eoule with active tuberculosis had been identified without X-rqv screening If so, why were mobile X-ray vans going around the United States dosing people with radiation to look for tuberculosis? Despite these facts, X-raying of chiZ&en with mobile units continued unabated until 1972, when the Public Health Service was jeirred by the American College of Radiology and the American College of Chest Physicians in a call for discontinuation of the mobile unit program. The mobile van program was curtailed somewhat, but the total paradigm of chest X-rays was not. In 1977, over 37 million chest X-rays were performed in hospitals across the United States. In 1979, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals announced that it no longer required routine X-ray examination upon admission to the hospital. In 198 1, the government eliminated its program of routine chest X-rays for 160,000 government employees. X-rays continued to be prescribed in an ever-increasing cascade in facilities all across America, many of them required as a result of the insurance programs, who require X-rays before a patient will be reimbursed for treatment. Medical malpractice laws are also a strong incentive for doctors to require numerous doses of radiation far in excess of real medical need, in hopes of establishing a \"record with which to defend themselves in case of legal action. The \"Logic\" of the U.S. Medical System It is about as logical to use X-rays, which cause cancer,, on a cancer patient for 'therapy\", as it is to use toxic chemotherapy drugs, which are carcinogenic and destroy the immune system, on a patient with a depressed immune system.

In 198 1, two 'health spas\" in ~ontana' were found to be advertising 'the benefits of radon gas': known to be hazardous to humans, in curing 'tirthritis, sinusitis, migraine, eczema, asthma, hay fever, psoriasis, allergies, diabetes and other ailments.\" Advertisements for the health resorts failed to mention the fivefold increase in lung cancer associated with breathing radon gas, well-established during observation of uranium mine workers. I wonder who owned and had stock in those health spas. Death for the Slaves of the U.S. Uranium Mining industry That the process of digging for certain ores would evoke a terminal illness has been knaon since the 16th century. Early potters used pitchblende, a uranium ore, as a source for pigment. Mine workers for 400 years suffered lung problems and an early, painful death. The condition that resulted as a result of this mining was identified as lung cancer in 1870. In 1939, it was determined by Peller that the lung cancer rate among those miners was 20 times higher that among control subjects in Vienna. The source of the problem was radon gas, which in turn decays into isotopes of polonium [also used in smoke detectors], bismuth and lead, some of which exist for quite a while as breakdown products of radon. Only a miniscule amount will cause cancer. Such dangers were known when men were sent to dig uranium in the early days of the nuclear program in the 1940's in the United States, as well as during the uranium mining operations until the ear& 19 70 's. * Observed in pamphlets from the Meny Widow Health Mine, Basin, Montana, and the Sunshine Health Mine, Boulder, Montana.

Since the plague of lung cancers for generations of mine workers was totally avoidable, why did the US. govemment let these men continuously die a horrible death? I suppose the answer lies somewhere in the realm of why the same government financially supported the buildup of National Socialism in Germany and Marxist Communism in Russia, and then absorbed the scientific research gained from the blood of millions into its own programs to be used against its own citizens? Probably. But, in the final analysis, this historically accurate portrayal of the govemment does not so much condemn the people involved, but the Malthusian-socialist mandate--the paradigm itself, as the reason why all this continues to occur around us on a daily basis. In 1960, the Public Health Service gave the statistics on uranium mine workers to Joseph Wagoner, a doctoral graduate of the Harvard School of Public Health. By 1964, Wagoner demonstrated a fivefold increase in cancer in mine workers. When the new standards appeared in 1971, Wagoner felt they were not adequate. Mines would often turn the radon gas ventilators off during lunch break, when the miners were on the surface, and begin blasting. When the workers returned, they would receive radon levels more than 17 times the legal standard. The extreme doses were never recorded in company files. In 1980, Wagoner quit the Public Health Service after 20 years. According to Wagoner, uranium mining as practiced in the United States remains the moral equivalent of genocide. Pollution of the Human Environment by the Nuclear Industry Oncec the miners have returned the ore to the surface, it is ground into as fine powder and mixed with acids. The acids dissolve the desired isotopes. The remaining material is referred to as 'tailings,\" which still contain 85% of the radioactivity of the original ore and over 99% of the original volume. It is a tremendously wasteful mass-to- mass process of extraction which would not be tolerated in any other enterprise, and it results in high quantities of hazardous waste which must be stored. Most works of literature state that there is no way to render it neutral, but we saw in the January 1995 issue of the Leading Edge that MRX technology, which uses laser light, is a practical way of safety and quickly neutralizing the material. We also saw proof that it was offered to the government, who reksed to entertain the idea. Why would the government refuse a safe, quick and effective way to neutralize nuclear waste? Both the acids, nody called 'liquor'', and the tailings are stored. On July 16, 1979, exactly 34 years to the day from the first test of a nuclear device in the deserts of the American southwest, a dam broke in Church Rock, New Mexico, releasing several hundred million gallons of 'liquor\" and 1,100 tons of mill wastes down upon Gallup, New Mexico and into the western Rio Puerco river, carrying toxic metals that could be detected Wassennan and Solomon, Killing Our Own: The Disaster of America S Experience with Atomic Radiation (Delacorte Press, 1982), p. 150."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO 70 miles downstream. The accident, which occurred 14 weeks after the accident at Three Mile Island, was one of America's largest nuclear disasters. Virtually no one outside of the areas where it happened remembers it, because it was not publicized, and the owners of the facility at Church Rock were United Nuclear Corporation, a Virginia-based firm with assets of hundreds of millions of dollars and strong influence in the New Mexico government. The virtual press blackout was not unexpected. The waste that broke out of the dam at Church Rock contained Thorium 230, which is as toxic is plutonium and has a half-life of 80,000 years. It collects in human bone marrow, the liver, and lymphatic tissue, and even minute quantites can detect cancer. The accident will be a cancer threat for tens of thousands of years. An investigation of the accident proved that it was preventable--that problems with the dam were known a year before the accident. No one did anything about it. Why? When the time came for 'kleanup,\" the state ordered United Nuclear to monitor pools created when the spill overflowed the banks of the Rio Puerto. The company chose to 'inonitor\" the uranium content of the pools. However, this was subterfbge on the part of the company, since the uranium had already been removed during the processing of the ore. Why did the company chose to monitor the pools for an element it knew would least likely exist in the pools? Investigators from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission showed that the radiation levels in the pools were 100-500 times natural background radiation. A doctor working with Indian children, Dr. Jorge Winterer, noted that children along the river played in the pools. Winterer publically brought out the facts about the subterfbge on the part of the company, and came under personal attack. He and his family were told to leave New Mexico, \"where they would be better The mine and mill were back in business in less than five months. The same pond was in use, and constant seepage of up to 80,000 gallons a day was routine. The company put up signs warning of contamination, but animals consumed by humans who wander into the area can't read. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission acknowledged that at least 15 accidental release of uranium tailings happened between 1959 and 1977, including seven dam breaks, six pipeline failures and two floods. In at least 10 occasions the release reached a major water source.\" In the fall of 1977, an internal NRC memorandum revealed that the NRC had underestimated radon emissions from tailing piles by a factor of 100,000.

Yet, because of the political aspect of the nuclear industry, nothing is done about the storage problems or the thousands of still-born children in mining families. The use of tailings for building materials was widespread throughout the 1950's and early 1960's. Despite repeated warnings fiom independent experts, the Atomic Energy Commission did not investigate the possibility that such tailings could harm people. In Grand Junction, Colorado alone, at least 270,000 tons of tailings were used in construction of the town. The leukemia rate in Grand Junction is twice the state average. More women of childbearing age are suffering than men.13 The Malthusian legacy continues. The pattern with the problem of nuclear waste and industries involved with it can be seen with virtually every other industry that causes human suffering. Industries maintain that tightening standards for safety would be too expensive. This can be seen within the paradigm of chemical industries, electromagnetic emissions and other areas covered under the auspices ofMatrix III. All the patterns and responses are the same. All the excuses are the same. The inaction is the same. The result is the same--death, degeneration and disease for millions of people, production of financial profit for the industries involved and the medical community, and suffering and misery for the American population. Thomas Malthus maintained in the 19th century that the elite had to increase the mortality rate of the non-elite. It is still taken quite seriously by the government of the United States and International Corporate Capitalism, in its quest for institution of Global Socialism. The people continue to die to satisfy that objective. Re-read the legal definitions at the beginning of this volume for criminal gross negligence, genocide and criminal conspiracy. Atomic Bomb Testing in the United States and Population Reduction Much of the focus has been on genetic damage caused by fallout fiom U. S. above ground atomic tests. More signdieant, however, is the systemic damage done to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy. In 1969 Dr. Ernest Stemglass, a graduate of Cornell University and a former employee of the Naval Ordnance Laboratories, published an article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists contending that some 375,000 American infants had died as a result of atomic bomb testing. His thesis rested on the idea that as medical technology was advancing, the rate of infant mortality dropped, essentially by a constant percentage each year. When the atomic bomb testing began, the rate of decline of infant mortality slowed. When the testing stopped, the rates began to drop as they had before, in keeping with continued medical advances. The total death rate caused by the atomic bomb testings, particularly from aerial dispersion of Iodine 13 1 which passes the placental membrane and affects the prenatal thyroid gland, is estimated at 375,000 infants, who suffered stunted growth, congenital deformities, hypothyroidism, brain damage, deformities and death.14 This is not some crazy abstraction.

Pauling indicated that a single radioactive fallout product, radioactive carbon 14, from a single years bomb testing, could cause 425,000 embryonic and neonatal (before one month of age) deaths, over 170,000 stillbirths and childhood deaths, and result in another 55,000 children being born with '&oss physical or mental defects.\" l5 Each year of bomb testing would Sect 650,000 people. Hiroshima and Nagasaki directly affected about 200,000 people and no doubt killed millions through cancer and leukemia through generations. Why has the United States been using this and other programs (chemical, biological and electromagnetic) to conduct the genocide of its own country? The proof is historically there, absolutely without question. The reasons were explained at the beginning of this volume. The paradigm must change, and change now. The charges levelled by Dr. Sternglass were quickly addressed by the Atomic Energy Commission, who chose Arthur Tamplin at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory to refUte the charges. Tamplin dissected Stemglass's study and 'tiecided\" that the case had been overstated. Tamplin said each bomb killed 4,000 American children. The rest of the 375,000 cases had been 'uue to social factors, including poverty.\" l6 How impoverished is a fetus during its first 90 days? Not very. The Atomic Energy Commission asked Tamplin to omit reference to the 4,000 deaths per bomb before he published his report in Science. The charges levelled by Dr. Stemglass have never been adequately refuted, but he has been attacked mercilessly since then. The atomic industry has devoted a lot of money and time to attack his work-which was apparently impeccable.\" Why? Because it reveals the truth, something which has been suppressed at every turn. In 1979, Dr. Emest Stemglass and Stephen Bell, an educational psychologist, presented a paper before the American Psychological Association suggesting that the atmospheric testing was linked to a decline in the SAT scores among American teenagers. The effects were particularly strong in Utah, where scores plunged 26 points.'' The paper obviously met with strong criticism fiom the nuclear industry. However, a 1980 study commissioned by the US. Navy substantiated the thesis. The Navy was concerned that the complexity of its technology was exceeding the ability of recuits to manage it, and it worried about an obvious decline in the mental abilities of American youth. According tyo the Navy study, it was agreed that radiation probably played an important role. Two of the Navy researchers, Bernard Rimland and Gerald Larson, hdicated that 'Stemgiass and Bell provide very convincing and disquieting evidence closly linking the SAT score decline to IS Linus Pauling, \"Genetic and Somatic Effects of Carbon-14,\" Science 128, No.3333, Nov 14, 1958. 16 Arthur Tamplin, \"Infant Mortality and the Environment,\" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Vol 25, December 1969. \" As a tenured professor with patents of his own, Stemglass has been financially beyond the grasp of the nuclear industry, leaving them with only his reputation to attack.

For almost 100 years, the toll of death and dying because of its deliberate proliferation has been a calculated effort to undermine the human population on a genetic and embryonic basis. Other fonns of nuclear power, such as aneutronic or protonic power (that does not emit radmtion or produce nuclear waste) could have been developed-why the development of the \"dirty\" version? Proliferation of Nuclear Facilities and Radiation Leakage In the fall of 1969, Go& and Tamplin published findings linking cancer deaths to radiation releases fiom nuclear reactors. In 1970, Dr. Ernest Stemglass began to look at infant mortality rates in communities where reactors existed. He soon found that in many cases, there was a significant rise in infant deaths in nearby counties and areas downwind from reactor sites. The findings of Dr. Stemglass were given further credibility in July 1971 by Dr. Morris Degroot, chairman of the Department of Statistics at the Carnegie- Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh. His statistics indicated a tentative correlation between reactor emissions and health problems around the Brookhaven reactor on Long Island, New ~ork.*' Degroot also studied the reactor at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, and noticed a rise in infant mortality there. Nine miles downwind in the small town of Aliquippa, Sternglass found a 20-year high in infant mortality rates. Rises were also evident in fetal mortality, underweight births and leukemia. In April 1973, the governor of Pennsylvania appointed a high-level commission to look into the problem. The commision found that the utility company, Duquesne Light, had been derelict in its responsibility to monitor radiation. A stronger statement was levied by another member of the commission--there appeared to be a strong suspicion of dishonesty in reporting releases. Unfortunately, and perhaps predictably, because future work depended on towing the party line, the commission eventually found 'ho sufficient evidence\" to confirm charges of an escalated infant death rate. However, death rates in the area had been lower before the plant opened. Thus, the rise of death rates relative to the state average actually represented a rise that could be attributed to the reactor. The same pattern would be seen at Three Mile Island. Parallel Developments at Three Mile Island Babcock and Wilcox, famous makers of steam boilers, received its first order for a nuclear reactor in 1966 fiom Metropolitan Edison, a subsidiary of General Public Utilities, who decided to build a reactor complex on Three Mile Island, ten miles southeast of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

By the time the second TMI unit opened in January 1979, residents of the area began to notice a milky white substance drifting down out of the sky fiom the power plant every time it was in operation. Also coincident with the operation of the TMI facility was the general disappearance of squirrels, rabbits and birds. An increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in humans was noted. These were the same problems noted at Shippingport. On March 28, 1979, TMI #2 had a near meltdown, with unknown quantities of radiation escaping into the local area. Estimates were made by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that 16 million curies of noble gases and 14 curies of Iodine 13 1 had been released. No one really knows. Reports of biie reproductive events concerning animals happened for years afterward. Infant human deaths doubled in the months following the TMI incident. Eighty- eight infants died. Infant mortality in the state of Pennsylvania exceeded the average U.S. rate.Within a five-mile radius, the ratio of infant deaths per live births rose by a factor of seven. The rate within a ten-rnile radius of TMI doubled. The State of Pennsylvania claimed to have an explanation.

Fortunately, all paradigms based on deceit eventually fall, aided by the plethora of data which &aces as a result of the social negativity such paradigms generate. The subject of vaccination is a good example, and we will take the data heretofore presented in volume one and amplify it, based on an overall reassessment which integrates what we have learned since then. Let us start with an examination of the subject of human immunity to disease. Natural Human Pathotropic Immunity Natural immunity can be considered the sum total of immunity to disease inherent in biological immune defenses not artiicially induced, and is comprised of active immunity, acquired through normal infestation of intestinal and respiratory systems after birth, and passive immunity, generally consisting of antibodies acquired fiom maternal blood and breast milk. The human immune system is hrther characterized as having specific responses, such as the production by the body of specific antibodies to counter specific foreign proteins or antigens, and non-specific responses, which consist of the general systemic response to undesirable substances. Included in the general repertoire of non-specific response is the skin, the mucous membranes of the respiratory and digestive tracts, reflex"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO actions of sneezing and coughing, natural antibodies, complement proteins, interferon1, the process of phagocytosis (cells devouring other cells), the effect of fatty acids, inflammatory response2, the action of reticulo-endothelial cells, the action of lysozyme and other enzymes, the response of respiratory and intestinal celia, the effect of stomach acid on bacteria, and secretions that contain antibodies themselves, such as secretory immunoglobulin, which assists the process of phagocytosis - an example being the action of white blood cells on pathogenic organisms. The human body maintains several lines of defense against the invasion of foreign proteins and subsequently produced toxins. The first line of defense is the skin, which is primarily composed of a protein-based material called keratin. The skin also secretes various oils, fatty acids and lactic acids which inhibit the general growth of bacteria, although many body flora that inhabit both the skin and the interior of the body are relatively innocuous, given that the immune system is in a normal condition, and many body processes are assisted by their existence. These organisms that exist in symbiosis with human anatomy are sensitive to antibiotics and synthetic materials administered by current medical practice. Disturbance of the delicate balance can lead to overpopulation of pathogenic organisms. The proliferation of candida albicans caused by administration of commercial antibiotic drugs is an example, as is the diarrhea and bleeding caused by obliteration of intestinal flora by antibiotics. Since the maintenance of internal organisms is an essential part of the human immune response, the death of these organisms weakens the overall immune system capability. The white cells in the body, the leukocytes, are generally divided into two groups, the granulocytes, which include neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, and the non- granulated lymphocytes and monocytes. Neutrophils constitute the most prevalent type of granulocyte, and have a nucleus containing a number of lobes. Because of the segmented nature of the nucleus, neutrophils are also called polymorphomclear leukocytes. They have an interesting property in that they have the abiity to form physical barriers against pathogenic organisms. The eosiniphil comprises about 2% of the leukocytes in the bloodstream, and appear to be connected with defense against parasitic infection and allergic response, rather than against microorganisms and toxins. Basophils also have a role to play in allergic response, and contain histamin and heparin. A firther form of the leukocyte is the monocyte, which has the capacity to ingest foreign particles and bacteria. The monocyte appears to be active in conditions presented by tuberculosis and hgal infections. Another natural line of defense is the lymphatic system. Most cellular structures in the body are bathed in lymph, a clear fluid which acts as a general dumping ground for 1 Interferon also causes xnany viruses to go into latency. Inflammatory response occurs when tissue is injured. The process starts when connective tissue blocks the lymph channel to check microbe spread, enlargement of injured cell capMes enables tramport of neutrophils to the site of injury, and the release of C-reactive protein, natural antiies, Igh4, interferon, properdin, and complement."},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO unwanted substances, later filtered out through the liver and kidneys. The lymph moves through a series of ducts and glands by virtue of a specialized series of muscular contractions, many of which are generated during the act of physical exercise. It is the lymphatic system which contains the aforementioned reticulo-endothelial cells which trap and ingest various organisms within the lymph. These cells also form the lining of several important organs, and are also present within the liver and spleen. When a foreign protein structure is located, connective tissue traps the foreign structure and lymphocytes are dispersed to engulf the offending organism. In the circulatory system are macrophages, specialized white blood cells that ingest and disrupt organisms found in the blood. After rnacrophages perform this action, processed antigens appear on the surface of the macrophages membrane. It is these processed antigens leftover fiom the destruction of organisms that are sensed by the T-cell lymphocyte?, prompting them to send out substances called lymphokines, which in turn alert B-cell lymphocytes to produce an antiboc3, in response to the processed antigen, otherwise taken as a processed foreign protein. Each B-lymphocyte has approximately 100,000 immunoglobulins on its surface4 . Antibodies produced by the B-cells are sometimes called immunoglobulzns, designated by the symbol Ig, and are released as the B-cell is stimulated by the presence of foreign antigens to transform into a plasma cell which manufactures the specific antibody required for the foreign antigen. There are generally five types of immunoglobulins. The first antibody, I@, reproduced in response to a foreign antigen is a large molecule found typically in the blood which stimulates the process of phagocytosis. The process of passive immunity involving maternal blood given to the fetus involves the antibody IgG, which is responsible for activating the macrophages. It can directly destroy many antigens on contact, and is the most abundant immunoglobulin in the body. Membranes in the respiratory tract, urinary tract and intestines produce IgA, which is produced directly at the site of an attack on a membrane by a foreign antigen. When the human body is experiencing an allergic reaction, IgE is released. The last immunoglobin identified, IgD, is not well understood, and is found in minimal qu&tities in the blood, as well as on the surface of B-cell lymphocyte membranes.' T-cell lymphocytes originate in the bone marrow but mature in the Thymus gland. When they mature, they are released into the lymphatic and circulatory system. It is the T-cells which maintain a molecular memory, much of which is genetically based, of past foreign protein structures. It is this memory which causes the production of additional T-cells, some of which directly consume antigens. Other cells, called T-helper cells produce hormones which signal to other cells that a conflict is in progress. When the battle is over, cells called T-suppressor (killer) cells release hormones which alert the immune system that the threat is over. The process of memory of past antigens is part of specific immunity. Chaitow, Leon, \"Vaccination and Immunisation: Dangers, Delusions and Alternativesn, p.28. A highly recommended work on the immune system is Essential Immunology, by Ivan Riott, the 8th edition of which is published by Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1994, 448 pages. It is an expensive book but is well worth the time to acquire if you really want to get a good understanding of these processes. 48 1"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Another line of defense involves complements, substances manufactured in the linings of the intestines, the liver, spleen and microphages. The main substance is known asproperdin, and its hnction is the neutralization of viruses and bacteria. The reticulo-endothelial cells mentioned earlier comprise another line of defense known as the reticulo-endothelial system, and produce specific sunstances involved in phsiological defense, primarily proteases, which play a role in detoxification of h-1 substances. In addition to the immunologzcal defense system mentioned above, the body maintains a chemical defeme ~stem. The blood itself, by virtue of its chemistry, is to a great degree bacteriostatic and virucidal, but this depends very heavily on correct nutrition which produces optimum levels of vitamin C and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), in addition to other substances. In fact, the optimum response of the immune system is said to depend heavily upon adequate levels of vitamin ~6~. The very fact that most vitamins are removed fiom processed foods and replaced with synthetic vitamins made from petroleum ought to tell you that processed foods have a significant role to play in immune system depression, and that it is being done knowlingly. The level of vitamin C in the blood can make the vital difference in human response to toxic vaccines, especially in infants, who often go into immunological shock. Alcohol and tobacco use, besides the obvious toxic consequences, reduce the level of vitamin C in the bloodstream, and are heavily promoted. Vitamin C in the bloodstream also plays a role in detoxification of heavy metals such as lead. It is estimated that the average individual in todays society requires vitamin C supplementation of 400-600 milligrams daily.' For additional data on the impact of human diet on disease, refer to that chapter. During the early 1950s there was an unusual chain of events relative to the health status of Aborigines in Australia. A New South Wales doctor by the name of Archie Kalokerinos spent seventeen years in the outback, and was appalled by the death rate in Aborigines from all kinds of bacterial and viral infections. In analyzing their diet, which consisted primarily of sugar, bread, and sausage, he made the determination that they were deficient in Vitamin C. Since they did not \"show normal signs of Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy)\" other doctors, displayed their immense lack of intelligence, declared that a Vitamin C deficiency was not indicated, ignoring entirely the diet of the people. Kalokerinos concluded that the death rates of Aborigines could be cut in half by allowing them various supplementary vitamins. Subsequent blood analysis by the skeptic doctors proved the deficiency in Vitamin C. In 1970, the Australian government stepped up their vaccination programs, and the results proved disastrous for the children. The infant death rate in the Northern Territory doubled within one year. By 1971, the death rate in some areas was approaching 50 Chaitow, pp.24-25. ' Ibid. Dr. Jefhy Bland, Linus Pauling Institute for Science and Medicine. 482"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO percent. Kolokerinos concluded that the malnourishment of the children contributed to an even weaker immune system; when a vaccination was given, the result was fatal. Investigation into the apparent and purposefbl decimation of the Aborigine people during this period, by what was essentially an exercise in bacteriological warfare against a specific group of people, provided information that the government's vaccine program purposely excluded any medical examination before vaccines were given, any case history of the Aborigine, and no checking of any dietary deficiencies. Subsequent deaths were fiom acute Vitamin C deficiency precipitated by the vaccination. If some infants survived the first vaccination, they would be lined up within another 30 days for another one. The Australian government denied that any relationship existed between the injections and the subsequent death of children. Because of this incident, it was discovered that high doses of Vitamin C reversed toxic and deadly effects of experimental injections. The Concept of Vaccination and Synthetic Immunity Vaccine: 'B preparation containing protein antigens and toxins, commonly bacteria, viruses and chemicals, used with the intent of inducing artificial immunity against a specific disease, mimicking the process of naturally occurring infections by artificial means, producing infection and production of antibodies, commonly with physiological side effects, with the aim of preventing full-blown clinical disease of the type that would be theoretically contracted without injection of the vaccine, provided that living standards, hygiene, acquired immunity, maternal care and natural immunity partially or completely fail in order to allow the disease to occur.\" The composite definition above is not one you will find in a medical journal, but is one assembled fiom a functional analysis of the conceptual paradigm of vaccination. Websters Medical Dictionary simply defines a vaccine as: 'hatter or a preparation containing the virus of cowpox in a fom used for vaccination, or a preparation of killed microorganisms, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms that is administered to produce or artificially increase immunity to a particular disease.\" Vaccination itself, according to Webster's, is defined as 'the introduction into man or domestic animals of microorganisms, active or latent viruses or bacteria, that have previously been treated to make them harmless for the purpose of inducing the development of immunity to a particular disease.\" Within the paradigm of vaccination, active immunity is achieved fiom the physiological reaction to the foreign antigens in the vaccine, and passive immunity is defined as that achieved with the injection of immune serum containing human or animal antibodies. Compare the concepts of arti$cial active and passive immunity in the vaccination paradigm with those given for natural immunity earlier in this chapter. The use of injected toxic vaccines by-passes the natural defense systems of the body and exposes the individual to more risks than benefits - at least this is the overall consensus by qualiied experts. If you ask any doctor the question of whether the idea of immunity by vaccine is the same as immunity by disease, they will answer \"of course\"; the actual facts"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO indicate otherwise. Another way of asking the question is \"is the 'immunity' gained by injection the same as 'normal' or \"pathotropic\" immunity?\" Vaccination as a procedure is based on several medical assumptions, all of which constitute a mind-set and belief system that not only fails to &ess knavn scientific knowledge, but one that forms the basis, on upper levels, for deliberate suppression of that knowledge and maintenance of a medical orthodoxy that insures its own continuance by promotion of disease conditions in the human community. These \"medical assumptions\" are: (1) a belief that disease agents are the only or primary cause of certain conditions, (2) a belief that the body can build a defense mechanism against such agents and prevent clinical illness with a lack of adverse consequences, and (3) a belief that this can be arbitrarily achieved by the administration of a certain form of the disease agent. Classification of Vaccines Vaccines are generally divided into two main groups, those made from bacteria and those made from viruses. Furthermore, vaccines contain either killed or live bacteria or viruses. Within the paradigm, those vaccines using organisms must be weakened or attenuated, 'So as not to cause disease in the recipient.\" There are several ways that viruses or bacteria are commercially attenuated. The most frequent procedure is by the method of serial passage, which is to pass the organism through animal cell cultures a number of times. Vaccines incorporating viruses may be passed through animal cells literally hundreds of times before it is declared to be attenuated. The type of animal cell that a virus is passed through depends on the type of virus. The measles virus, for example, is passed through successive groups of chicken embryo cells, polio viruses are passed through monkey kidney cells, rubella virus is passed through duck or rabbit cells, and yellow fever is passed through rodent cells or chicken embryo cells. Live vaccines have the capability of reproducing in the host human. The impact of injection of foreign animal protein complexes into humans will be discussed in detail later. Vaccines designated as 'killed vaccines\" are those containing viruses or bacteria that are 'Inactivated by the use of radiation, heat or chemicals, resulting in altered whole cells or viruses, split or fragmented cells or viruses, all chemically extracted, synthetic molecular structures, or what are known as toxoids. The physiological response to a killed vaccine is the production of antibodies that continue to circulate throughout the body. A great number of situations have arisen in which supposedly killed vaccines still contain live components. This happened in 1955 with the administration of Salk polio vaccine that produced a number of cases of paralytic polio. The preparation contained fonnalin, a carcinogenic germicide that was thought to have inactivated the virus. Obviously, it did not work. Let us not forget that all vaccines are experimental in nature. Viral Vaccines Viruses themselves are non-living pieces of nucleic acid surrounded by a coat of protein. When a virus enters a cell, it makes use of cellular enzymes and duplicates itself."},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO They can be active or assume a latent, passive infective condition within the cell, waiting for the right conditions to activate. Viruses can remain undetected and latent for years within the body, only to suddenly manifest themselves explosively. Viruses can infect plants and animals, as well as bacteria. Duplication of the virus within a cellular structure often results in the death of the host cell, and viral particles are released through broken cell membranes and infect other cells. Viruses also have the capability to combine with the genetic material in the host cell chromosomes without killing the host cell. The nucleic acids RNA and DNA are spiral-shaped protein chains that express heredity codes transferred genetically and direct the formation of various protein substances. Nucleic acids contain individual packets of information which are species-specific. The \"D\" in DNA and the \"R\" in RNA have characterigics which are dependent on the kind of sugar molecule associated with it. DNA exists predominantly in the nucleus, but is also represented in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria. RNA is also present in the cytoplasm. When viral RNA or DNA combines with the genetic material in the cell itself, the viral genetic material can become part of the host cell genetic code, altering the genetic structure of the cell. When the altered cell duplicates, the encoded viral genetic material may affect cellular processes in such a way as to produce abnormal cells, which sometimes become malignant or cancerous. Another designation applying to viruses is the slow virus, characterized by extremely long periods of latency and very often fatal. Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, characterized by dementia and motor convulsive disorders, is an example of a well-known slow virus, as is Kuru, a virus that plagued a cannibalistic tribe in New Guinea. Since viral particles blend easily with cellular genetic material, it is quite likely that generations of vaccination is a co-factor contributing to the general decline in the immune system of the general population. It is interesting to note that the oxymoronic World Health Organization in Geneva has a program called 'Health for All by the Year 2000\" that 'tiemands a significant increase in the production of viral vaccines and other biologically active substances without a reduction in potency.\"8 Furthermore, they have decided to develop cell line seed banks for use in vaccines for baby hamster kidney cells and African green monkey kidney cells known to contain simian virus 40 (SV-40). Natural vs Invasive Viral Entry Processes Normally, the natural portal of entry of a virus into the body appears to be when it lands on a mucous membrane lining, which itself possesses certain types of defense mechanisms. The actual immunity conveyed by these membranes is due to the local production and release of IgA, which is a membrane or glandular anti-body, and it is more abundant in those tissues than in blood. The apparent action is that the IgA coats or wraps ''Abstracts, Continuous Cell Lines as Substrates for Biologicals\", National Clarion Hotel Meeting, May 1988, Virginia, paper#4 1. 485"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO a virus, thereby neutralizing it. The process of injection, on the other hand, permits a viral entry through a route that is different than the natural portals, decreasing the appropriate antibody response and bypassing the body's first line of defense. This is common knowledge, which makes the deliberate use and intent to use injection processes an even more dubious approach; it can result in nothing but an increase in the general ill health of the population, which of course guarantees a line of income for quite some time, due to the long-term effects incurred. This is another case of criminal activity, knowledge of which is kept fiom the general public. Normal Processes of Viral Penetration Respiratory viruses enter through the surface cells of the respiratory tract. Unless the individual has a strong pathotropic (surface membrane) immunity, which is usually not long lived, invasion will occur. Higher amounts of internal protection fiom the defensive abilities of the membrane may be offered if high amounts of circulating IgG is present in the blood. Next, the virus may enter through the lymphatic glands in the digestive tract. The tonsils are major guardians in this area. Presumably, this is why medical edict required their removal, as an \"organ with no apparent function\", for so many years in this society. In the case of vaccine and smallpox virus, cell-to-cell transmission of the viral particles occurs - this cause progressive death of the tissues involved (necrosis) which is then unaffected by the presence of anti-bodies but apparently arrested by sensitized immune lymphocytes. Presumably, this is achieved by a graft-type rejection of the infected cells whereby virus synthesis is interrupted and already-formed viruses are neutralized by anti- bodies. Other mucous membrane penetration is through micro-lesions created during anal intercourse, inoculation into the womb by intercourse during the menstrual period, direct injection into the blood stream, through micro-lesions in the gum tissue in the mouth caused by the use of tooth-brushes and dental floss, and ingestion of fragments (bone, etc.) within food, which injure the intestinal lining. Abnormal Viral Penetration By Injection Viruses directly injected into the blood stream below the skin level avoids the proper immunogobulins and the naturally occuning oleic acid mantle, and are neutralized or blocked by circulating antibodies. We are talking about viruses that are not the result of genetic engineering. The body produced only one type, IgA, as the first line of defense, and this is against arthropod or insect-borne viruses which are carried by blood-sucking and stinging vectors injected directly into the blood or lymph. In other words, nature provides appropriate protection against predatory viruses as long as they attack through their natural routes. The problem comes in when viruses normally meant to run this gambit are injected, as when commercial immunizations are administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously."},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Bacterial Vaccines One of the primary vaccines made fiom bacteria is the diphtheria vaccine. Horses are injected with diphtheria bacteria and then bled, producing antiserum. Another preparation using diphtheria bacteria is called toxin-antitoxin mixture, combining both the toxic components and the antidote in one preparation, and a number of serious reactions prompted the development of a diphtheria vaccine prepared fiom toxoidr, which are toxins theoretically rendered non-poisonous by combining it with a chemical agent. Diphtheria toxoids came into existence in the 19207s, using carcinogenic formaldehyde (used to emblarn bodies) as the chemical agent in the vaccine. The DPT vaccine, which we will discuss later, combines the toxoids of diphtheria and tetanus with the whole cells of pertussis bacteria to form a single vaccine which has proven to be quite lethal to humans, especially infants with immature immune systems and unmyelinated nerves, and has resulted in death, encephalitic paralysis and brain damage. DPT vaccine is produced by taking tetanus bacteria and adding it to a broth of dextrose, beef heart infusion, salt and casein. Diphtheria bacteria are added to a similar broth. After the poisonous toxins are produced in each of the vats, the broth is filtered and carcinogenic formalin is added in an fbtile attempt to attenuate the toxoids. Poisonous methanol alcohol is then added to precipitate the toxoid, which is dried to a powder and mixed with glycerine. Pertussis bacteria are chemically killed by adding a poisonous mercwy-based chemical called thimerosal, and aluminum hydroxide or potassium sulfate is added. The result is called DPT vaccine, which is injected into human children after testing on mice to determine the strength at which 50% of a test lot of mice survive. The result will be discussed later in detail, but the neurological disorders produced by such activity are of the puzzle of why crime is so rampant in our society today. This fact is discussed in another chapter which illustrates that despite the fact they have known vaccines produce minimum brain damage since 1926, and they have known that this MBD produces aberrant behavior leading to criminal activity, they ignore that fact and do it anyway. Hegelian production of social aberration to justifiy greater social control. Simple. Serial Passage of Vaccine Components Through Animal Cell Lines According to the vaccination paradigm promulgated by medical companies, the passage of viruses through animal cell lines is necessary in order to reduce the toxicity of the viruses to humans. This belief is contraindicated by historical evidence. Back in the 1940's there was a campaign in French West Afiica to immunize population groups to yellow fever virus. The virus was passed through mouse cell cultures 258 times, and the mice who were paralyzed had their brains ground up and dried, and this preparation was used to 'inoculate\" over 100,000 people in 1944. This resulted in over 100 cases of brain damage (meningioencephalitis) and 18 death^.^ Murphy, J. \"What Every Parent Should Know About Childhood Immunization\", p.35. 487"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The SV-40 Virus Contamination of Vaccine Cultures In 1960 it was discovered that millions of polio vaccine doses produced in the early 1950's from monkey kidney cells were infected with simian virus 40 (SV-40), which was found in both Salk and Sabin polio vaccines. SV-40 is resistant to the 'heutralizing effects\" of the carcinogenic germicide formalin added to the vaccineslO, and was passed on to millions of people who now have SV-40 as part of their genetic structure. SV-40 is one example of a DNA polyoma virus. Polyoma (many tumor-causing) viruses cause prolonged infection where tissue is destroyed, integrate into the hosts genetic material, are capable of mutating a cell, may reproduce afier coming into contact with a \"helper\" virus, enable the separate replication of the viral genome, can generate immune responses, and they can induce malignancy. Scientists are amazed at how little genetic information these viruses carry in proportion to the damage they can cause. Also, with polyoma viruses, it becomes impossible to detect the viral genome once it has been integrated, and it may reappear if the transformed cells are fbsed to others which are naturally permissive for SV- 40 or other polyoma viruses.There have not been many statistical studies done, for obvious reasons, to determine all of the long term effects of polio immunization; it is known that polio vaccines injected into humans before 1962 contained SV-40. This was documented in an article in 1969 in Science Magazine, a Journal Of The American Association for the Advancement of Science. It was an article by Dr. Joseph Fraumeni entitled \"Simian Virus 40 in Polio Vaccine: Follow-up of Newborn Recipients\". It stated that SV-40 virus was an unrecognized contaminant if virus vaccines prepared in monkey kidney cell cultures prior to 1962. However, the SV-40 virus was recognized by Dr. Hillman in 1960, which does not explain the two-year gap in \"lack of recognition\" and suppression of this information that followed. Legalese defines the word contamination, with respect to vaccines, as something external to the manufacturing process, and does not permit the public dissemination of the fact that the SV-40 virus already existed in the cultures used to prepare the \"polio vaccine\". SV-40 is an oncogenic (cancer-causing) virus. According to the report, \"from 1960 to 1962, polio vaccine in various forms and regimens was given to 1077 newborn infants at the Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital, in a study to assess the feasibility of introducing active immunity to poliomyelitis in the presence of maternal antibodies. Normal term infants were assigned with parental consent to one of six study groups. An attenuated poliomyelitis vaccine was given orally to 925 infants; some received very high concentrations of S-40 within a few hours of birth. The remaining 152 children were injected with large doses of inactivated polio vaccine which had smaller concentration of SV-40 than the oral preparations. Later in infancy, all the chidden received \"booster\" injections of attenuated or inactivated polio vaccine, or both, which presumably contained SV-40. Since 1964, we have made periodic efforts to determine the death rate among the vaccinated children, who were from an urban, low socioeconomic, highly mobile, predominantly Negro population. \" lo Murphy, p.36 488"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO An analysis of the above reveals staggering gaps in logic that support the premise that it may well have been done deliberately to study the negative effects of the vaccine. The study purports to have been performed in order to \"evaluate antibody formation\" in newborn vaccines, but in defiance of the orthodox definition of an empirical study, no control group was used or selected so that such an evaluation could take place. Follow- ups were made to determine death rate and not state of health. The parental consent forms detailed no risks involved with the experiment that would bar the parents fiom signing. The health state of vaccines at the time of the report was not mentioned. Clearly, either total incompetence or negligence was involved, or the study was done to assess the known negative results to those vaccinated. Evidence points to the latter, and this constitutes a criminal act. SV-40 is also a DNA virus. A study on DNA viruses was completed in 1966, and the results of the study were published in a 1967 edition of the American Journal of Pathology; the results clearly showed the known connection between such viruses and cancer: \"A number of viruses containing DNA have been shown to induce tumors when inoculated into newborn animals. Members of the papovavirus group, mouse polyoma, and simian virus 40, all adenoviruses, are now recognized as oncogenic (cancer-causing) when tested by this method\". An article by M.A. Israel, 'Molecular Cloning of Polyoma Virus DNA in E-Coli\", published in Science Magazine in 1979 described the use of Polyoma DNA in molecular cloning into E.Coli for the purpose of ongenicity (production of a cancer-causing virus). It only takes 10 or 20 particles of polyoma per cell to cause malignancies. Matrix III volume one describes in detail the research done at the National Cancer Institute in producing cancer-causing viruses under the guise of cancer research. Research indicates that there is an unusual feature to these viruses, in that the tumors they eventually cause appear to be virus-pee, making it impossible to detect viral causation in tumors induced by these viruses. Over 500 million people have been inadvertently innodated with SV-40. SV-40 an Integral Part of Genetically Engineered Products When a genetically engineered product is manufactured, a probe, plasmid or vector is an essential part of the process; these can be defined as a specific kind of molecular structure that permits the passage and insertion of one type of DNA into the genetic material of the organism used to manufacture the genetically engineered substance. Some of the newest genetically engineered products for sale are those \"vaccines\" against \"AIDS\". Most of these vector probes contain SV-40 or portions of SV-40 as part of their structures, SV-40 being a very important active component in the process. Any review of the various symposia conducted on genetic engineering makes it clearly obvious that it is an important factor in recombining viruses and genetic material (recombinant genetic engineering). Due to the influence of the SV-40 base, various other viruses are eagerly assimilated. Sometimes, in genetic literature, SV-40 is called \"plasmid pMV104, which"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO uses SV-40 as its origin but hides the immediate relationship with SV-40 fiom public perusal. The action of the presence of Sv-40 material is analogous to that of DMSO, in that it acts like a \"wheelbarrow\" to carry other substances into an otherwise well- protected cellular body; this is the main reason why an individuals' subsequent reaction and susceptibility to environmental pollutants after injection with a vaccine. Supporting these lines of thought, an article in the January 6, 1962 Science News- letter indicated that \"common human viruses act as carriers in causing cancer by interacting with cancer-causing chemicals; this has been indicated by experiments which show that cancer-causing substances that are present in too small a quantity by itself will become active and create tumors when combined with single doses of virus. Malignant tumors appeared in five type of injected mice.\" The viruses mentioned were ECH09, B-4, Coxsackie, and Poliovirus 2. The article fbrther indicated that \"viruses may also activate other cancer causing substances besides chemicals in the environment, such as DMBA, AF, and DBA.\" The Use of Animal Cell Line Substrates for Human Vaccines In our current cultural situation, medical drugs are generally dividied into three categories: (1) Pharmaceuticals, (2) Biologicals and (3) Genetically Engineered Products, which now include sera (plural of serum), vaccines and blood derivatives\". Most vaccines are manufactured using what are called contimous cell lines (CCL), usually animal tissue based, which provide the raw materials having specific biological properties which serve as the substrate for production of genetically engineered (biotech) drugs. In the past, vaccines were made solely fiom individual lots of animal tissues or human disease by products.The main aspect of CCL that is attractive to vaccine manufacturers is an infinite lifespan and a high growth rate, but the problems are \"biochemical, biological and genetic variability in terms of the production of transforming proteins and potentially oncogenic (cancer-causingj DNA, contaminating viruses and predisposition to tumors in animals.\" l2 J.B. GrifEths fiom the United Kingdom gave a presentation in 1988 in which he stated \"it is now generally accepted that continuous cell lines are acceptable as substrates for the production of biologicals, provided that the manufacturing process yields no detectable risk attributed to the cell subtrate.\" l3 Three French doctors in 1988 warned of hazards fiom introducingplasmid DNA into mammalian cells, \" since part of the regulatory genetic elements used in the expression vectors (plasmids) is often virus-derived, and the presence of these DNA sequences in the final product represents a potential risk.\" l4 \" Dr.J.P.

As a result, outbreaks of cancer occurred in primate laboratories worldwide. In one experiment documented in the Journal of the American Veterinary Association, human blood laced with leukemia was deliberately injected in gibbon monkeys under the guise of \"malaria experiments\", and watched as the speed of action and the severity of the virus increased with the program of infecting more and more animals. During a period between 1969 and 1973 a leukemia epidemic affected 900 inbred Hamadryas baboons at an experimental animal station in Soviet Georgia. These monkeys were then shipped to Litton Bionetics in Kensington, Maryland, a laboratory that had such a bad containment record that even the National Cancer Institute called it \"grossly irresponsible\", according to an article in a 1979 Science Journal. Other violations of containment were reported an another infamous laboratory run by Litton: the Frederick Cancer Research Center. In 1971 and again in 1973, researchers were \"surprised\" at the occurrence of two epidemics of leukemia in gibbons which happened \"unexpectedly\" at the Medical Research Lab of SEAT0 in Bangkok, Thailand. From November 1969 to November 1982, a continuous AIDS-like illness was observed among primates worldwide. The illness had the following symptoms: diseased lymph nodes, enlarged spleen, fever, diarrhea, weigh-loss, and infection with microorganisms. These scientists were perfectly aware that transmission of a virus fiom a species that is a natural host to a species that is not, causes mutations and an increase in virulence, but did the experiments anyway, with total disregard for others in the society. In the Primate Research Center in Beaverton, Oregon, the population of black macaque monkeys, between 1978 and 1983, contracted what scientists referred to as \"simian AIDS\". The high peak for the epidemic was in 1980, at the start of the Reagan- Bush administration. Of course, we all know about the Ebola Reston incident fiom the book Xke Hot Zone. Vaccination and Genetic Change: Mobility of Genetic Material Between Life Forms One of the indications that vaccinations may in fact be changing the genetic structure of humans became evident in September of 1971, when scientists at the University of Geneva made the discovery that biological substances entering directly into the bloodstream could become part of human genetic structure. Originally, Japanese bacteriologists discovered that bacteria of one species transferred their own specific antibiotic resistance to bacteria of an entirely diierent species. Dr. Maurice Stroun and Dr. Philip Anker in the Department of Plant Physiology at the University of Geneva, began to accumulate evidence that the transfer of genetic information is not confined to bacteria, but can also occur between bacteria and higher plants and animals. According to an article in WorldMedicine on September 22, 1971, \"Geneva scientists are convinced that normal"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO animal and plant cells shed DNA, and that this DNA is taken up by other cells in the organism.\" In one experiment, scientists in Geneva extracted the auricles of frog hearts and dipped them for several hours in a suspension of bacteria. Afterward, they found a high percentage of RNA-DNA hybridition between bacterial DNA extracted fiom bacteria of the same species as that used in the experiment and titrated DNA extracted fiom the auricles which had been dipped in the bacterial suspension. Bacterial DNA had been absorbed by the animal cells. This phenomenon has been dubbed transcession. There is evidence that this kind of phenomenon is happening all the time within the human body. It is conceivable, for example, that heart damage following rheumatic fever could the the result of the immune system reacting to its own cells producing a foreign RNA complex after absorption of foreign DNA. In Science magazine, November 10, 1972, bacterial RNA was demonstrated in fiog brain cells after a bacterial peritoneal infection. In the April 1973 issue of the Journal of Bacteriology, transcription of spontaneously released bacterial DNA was found to be incorporated into cellular nuclei of fiog auricles. Studies by Phillipe Anker and Maurice Stroun have indicated spontaneous release of DNA material fiom mammalian cells, spontaneous transfer of DNA fiom bacteria to higher organisms, spontaneous transfer of DNA between cells of higher organisms, release of RNA by mammalian cells, and biological activity of released complexes containing RNA. Malignant Cellular Transformations Caused By Foreign DNA There is evidence that fieely circulating foreign DNA can cause malignancy. In a 1977 issue of lntemational Review of C'ology, Volume 5 1, Anker and Stroun discuss the possible effects of foreign DNA causing malignant cell transformations. When foreign DNA is transcribed into a cell of a different organism, \"this general biological event is related to the uptake by cells of spontaneously released bacterial DNA, thus suggesting the existence of circulating DNA. In view of the malignant transformations obtained with DNA, the oncogenic (cancer-causing) role of circulating DNA is postulated.\" The discovery in 1975 that viruses causing cancer in animals had a special enzyme called reverse transcriptase makes the problem even more interesting. These kind of viruses are called RNA viruses. When an RNA virus has the reverse transcriptase enzyme within its structure, it allows the virus to actually form strands of DNA which easily integrate with the DNA of the host cell which it infects. Studies by Dr. Robert Simpson of Rutgers University indicate that RNA viruses which do not cause cancer can also fom DNA, even without the presence of reverse transcriptase. DNA formed in this way fiom an RNA virus is called a provirus. It is known that some non-cancerous viruses have a tendency to exist as proviruses for long periods of time in cells without causing any apparent disease. In other words, they remain latent. Some examples of common RNA viruses that do not cause cancer, per se, but have the capacity to form proviruses are influenza, measles, mumps and polio viruses. In the October 22, 1967 British Medical"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Journal, it was brought out by German scientists that multiple sclerosis seemed to be provoked by vaccinations against smallpox, typhoid, tetanus, polio, tuberculosis and diptheria. Even earlier, in 1965, Zintchenko reported 12 cases in which MS became evident after a course of antirabies vaccinations. Remember that millions of people between 1950 and 1970 were injected with polio vaccines containing simian virus 40 (SV- 40) transferred from contaminated monkey kidney cells used to culture the vaccine. It is impossible to remove animal viruses from vaccine cultures. You are reminded that SV-40, the 40th virus to be discovered in simian tissue, is a cancer-causing virus. Immunization programs against influenza, measles, mumps and polio are in fact seeding humans with RNA and forming proviruses which become latent for long periods in throughout the body, only to re-awaken later on. Post-polio syndrome is a good example of this problem. Other examples may include the so-called mesenchymal and collegen diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and lupus erythmatosis, where antibodies are formed by the immune system against the person's own tissues - tissues which have been impregnated with foreign genetic material. According to a special issue of Postgraduate Medicine in May 1962, \"although the body generally will not make antibodies against its own tissues, it appears that slight modification of the antigenic character of tissues may cause it to appear foreign to the immune system and thus a fair target for antibody production.\" Two years later in 1964, studies were conducted on the polyoma virus, a tumor-producing DNA virus. It was discovered that the persistent genetic DNA material in the polyoma virus brought about malignant transformations in hamster embryo cell cultures. This was reported in the November 23, 1964 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Even common non-tumor viruses, including those in smallpox vaccine and polio virus 2, can act as carcinogens. It was reported in Science on December 15, 1961 that these common viruses acted as catalysts in prhcing cancer when given to mice in combination with known organic carcinogens in amounts too small to inchrce tumors themselves. This means that some vaccinations will induce cancer, when combined with the growing problem of environmental pollution fiom toxic by-products of agriculture (pesticides on and in food) and industry. Of course, this information is hidden fiom the public, which is why the FDA, EPA and the agricultural industries can get away with \"sanctioning\" small amounts of pollutants in food, water and air. The connection has not been made public, much to the joy of the chemical industry, the National Cancer Institute and the growing cancer industry, which continues to fraudulently solicit public donations to just* its own existence. As an aside, it has aireadybeen admitted that polio vaccinations have caused 100% of all polio in the United States since 1980 and the predominant cases of all paralytic polio since 1972 (Science, April 4, 1977). It is suspected that the Salk and Sabin vaccines, made of moneky tissue culture, have also been responsible for the major increase in leukemia in the United States. The use of viruses, bacteria and animal tissue cultures in mass immunization campaigns, considering that this information has been known for 20 years, constitutes an intentionally created hazard to humans. The global impact on the wide range of genotypes"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO relative to human beings is difficult to assess, but the outcome is definitely negative, and permitting the seeding of latent proviruses in humans, knowingly, can have no other rationale other than future medical profiteering, and constitutes a criminal conspiracy of vast proportions which is tatamount to a genocidal policy against the population, further constituting crimes against humanity, which is internationally punishable by death. But, of course, especially in the United States, this fact is ignored and suppressed fiom public knowledge, despite a 1984 plea by some U.S. physicians to the United Nations in a report. The fact that this goes on with the 111 knowledge of the world medical community makes this an international conspiracy where the population has no recourse, given that vaccinations are becoming mandatory and a prerequisite for many social programs. Persistence of long-term viruses and foreign proteins and their relationship to chronic and degenerative disease was also pointed out by Dr. Robert Simpson of Rutgers University in 1976, when he addressed science writers at an American Cancer Society seminar, saying \"these proviruses could be molecules in search of a disease.\" Dr. Wendell Winters, a virologist at the University of California noted, \"immunizations may cause changes in slow viruses and changes in the DNA mechanism.\" Although host cells containing latent viral particles operate more or less normally, they begin to synthesize viral proteins under the guidance of the viral DNA, eventually creating the circumstances for various autoimmune diseases, including diseases of the central nervous system, which unfortunately add to the growing load of aberrant social behavior patterns. Some Things to Ponder A few interesting facts and questions to ponder: much of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) produced in the world is prepared using ground up kidney cells fiom Afiican green monkeys, at least for the last 30 years. It was Albert Sabii himself who detected the SV- 40 virus in polio vaccine. Why did he cover it up? The very first muss oral polio vaccination campaign took place in Ruwanda and parts of the. northeastern Belgian Congo (Zaire) fiom 1957-1958. Over 250,000 were given the oral vaccine. Today, this area is rampant with AIDS. This same OPV, produced by Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, was used in Leopoldville (now known as Kinshasha, Zaire, site of the earliest HIV sample), capital of the Belgian Congo. Interestingly, Zaire was also the site of the 1995 outbreak of Ebola. Ruwanda was the site of the mass murder and genocide perpetrated by the mentally aberrant Tutsi's on the Hutu tribe, resulting in the death of 250,000 people, hacked to death and dismembered, in 1994. Could the aggression have been created by generations of virus-laden experimental vaccines producing post encephalitic problems? In 1967, 31 vaccine technicians and laboratory workers contracted Marburg virus after working with tissue fiom Afiican green monkeys, which also contains simian virus 40 (SV-40) and other toxic organisms too expensive to screen out, such as simian herpes (I3 virus). It might be mentioned that SV-40 has been linked to leukemias and degenerative brain disease. Yellow fever vaccine is grown on chicken embryos contaminated with avian leukosis virus, a retrovirus causing cancer in chickens.15 In 1986, the World Health l5 Brittanica Book of the Year, 1960. 494"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Organization (WHO) advised that it was permissible for the vaccine to continue to contain avian leukosis, since it was difficult to obtain leukosis-free chicken embryos. In the August 20, 1987 issue of Nature, page 660, a new leprosy vaccine made from armadillos was described, in addition to the fact that the vaccine also contained \"foreign proteins, DNA and unknown retroviruses that may produce delayed hannfuul egects.\" The Bottom Line on the Bottom Paradigm When you taken into consideration the fact that many viruses, including cytomegloviruses (CMV) are parasites of virtually every animal species, and a major feature of CMV parasitism and many animal viruses is the latent state in which they exist after the primary infection is resolved, and that they can be reactivated in the body (in vivo) under the influence of various stimuli (primary examples being environmental chemicals (especially those derived from petroleum), heroin, cocaine, nitrates, nitrites and inhalant drugs of abuse, or other vaccine injections of foreign proteins, toxins, bacteria or viruses), the use of anirnal cell lines to make human vaccines is criminally negligent, never mind the fact that injection of foreign proteins and toxins directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the natural defense systems of the body is also criminally negligent. The evidence suggests that a methodical system has existed for knowingly and selectively transferring slow and dzflcult-to-detect dseases from other species into the human race. As a method for population control, to weed out those considered to be \"useless eaters\"? To produce disease and then profit fiom treatment which is just as deadly as the disease? You decide. Isn't it interesting that Burroughs Wellcome company in England is the source for both immune-system-destroying amyl nitrate \"poppers\", used in bath houses by homosexuals and promoted as \"air fiesheners\" by media magazines, and the preferred \"AIDS treatment\" AZT, which is a deadly cellular toxin and also destroys both the immune system and the human being involved? It is interesting to note, therefore, that since humans have been receiving animal viruses in vaccines, and viruses (including CMV) are present in immune deficiency syndrome (\"aids\") in humans, and known animal viruses and viral components are oncogenic (cancer-causing), and can cause all the \"symptoms\" of AIDS, and this has been going on since the 1940's (when polio vaccine cell cultures were first contaminated with simian virus 40 (used as a genetic carrier in all genetic biotech products having viral particle components), and this was well known in the medical field but suppressed from public knowledge, and ultimately the same people who politically control the pharmaceutical, biotech and vaccine companies also control the medical establishment, as well as benefit fiom fbnd-raising (i.e., American Cancer Society ,etc.) for \"diseases\" that never get resolved, you have a very large conspiracy that is worth trillions of dollars to keep from public scrutiny. That's the real bottom line. Research bears all of this out. You are now informed, and if you don't believe that something of this magnitude can be possible, do the research and you 'I1 see that it is absolutely the case. If you comment on this without checking it out, which might involve a little work, there is nothing credible you can say.

It is also fiaud. Suppressed Information Gained By a Study of the Polio Plague, Sugar and Salt Consumption, and Ripping of DNAIRNA The incidence of polio as a rampant plague increased 400 percent, according to Dr. Wfiam Koch, after the process of injection with serums, vaccines and penicillin in the 1950's. In addition, the Wer sociological encouragement of the spread of the disease was found by several medical researchers to parallel the mass marketing of sugar-related products for consumption. Sugar is extremely bad for the body, and prepared the bodies to hction as more acient breeding grounds for the polio epidemic soon to arrive. This was brought out briefly in 1948 by Dr.Sandler at a Veteran's Administration Hospital in North Carolina; release of this information was curtailed after its initial announcement brought down the incidence of polio in North Carolina by 90%. Afterwards, people resumed their previous habits and the incidence slyocketed. Sandler was censured therafter. Between 1977 and 1980, an article came out in a major medical journal that detailed the effort to raise $10 million in hdmg for intd pressure on the Surgeon General of the United States in order to stop. him from revealing to by public, by virtue of package labeling, that the combination of & and sugar b re-~re~ked foods cause replicative and structural Mure in DNA and RNA within the human bodv.

Rubella is a rather innocuous (benign) infectious disease caused by a virus. Most of the population contract this condition as a matter of course and develop a life-long immunity to the effect of the virus without recourse to the paradigm of synthetic immunity via injection of viral components.

It is estimated that as of 1980, over 83,000,000 doses of rubella vaccine have been injected into the population.17 The number of cases seems to remain stable at about 30 to 40 per year, out of a population of 250,000,000. Despite the use of the rubella vaccine, the number of infections in women of childbearing age has remained the same1*, indicating a defde paradigm.

Many had to seek medical attention and some were hospitalized to test for rheumatic fever and rheamatoid arthritis. In New Jersey, this same testing program showed that 17% of all children vaccinated dweloped arthralgia and arthritis. An estimated 340,000 childfen in New Jersey were crippled as a result of the rubella vaccine.

In 1971, there was a rubella epidemic where over 1,000 preschool and elementary children in Casper, Wyoming contracted rubella. Over 83% of the elementary school children and 52% of the preschool children had been \"vaccinated against rubella virus.\" It is a well known fact that the appearance of infectious diseases after the introduction of vaccines for that disease is chronically under-reported in the United mainly because such reporting would constitute a con£lict of interest. It is considered \"unethical\" by the medical profession to report problems that would reflect badly on the medical profession. Strangely, it is not considered \"unethical\" to suppress syrnptomological data indicative of hazards fiom ones work that would constitute knowledge that would benefit the population. Incredibly, the medical profession insists on vaccinating pregnant women with the rubella virus vaccine. Despite the fact that pregnant women are viewed as the \"high risk\" group as far as exposure to rubella virus is concerned, between 1979 and 1982 there was a great effort in the United States to inject women of childbearing age with the rubella vaccine.\" Interestingly, there was a parallel increase in cases of congenital rubella @ome in women of childbearing age from 1981 to 1982. In 1975, a review was published regarding the general experience with the rubella virus vaccine since its introduction in 1969. It was claimed that there was a decline in reported cases of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome, and that the vaccine provided protection. Curiously, it was also admitted that those \"vaccinated could suffer reinfection fiom the virus, and that there was a \"small but significant incidence\" of adverse reactions and a \"potential\" risk to women who are vaccinated during pregnancy.31 The fact that these supposedly \"intelligent\" human beings can't understand that reality undermts their own paradgm is absolutely incredible, especially when it is known that natural rubella infection is almost always benign and confers better immunity than the vaccine, and that rubella vaccination is not justified in young children, who have undeveloped nervous system32 that are extremely sensitive to vaccine components.

A 1985 study investigating the mechanism of \"vaccine failure\" in ~anada~~ concluded that there was \"a generalized lack of understanding of the nature and sigdicance of altered immunologic responses caused by rubella vaccine programes.\" But, they'll continue them anyway. In 1983, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization in Canada recommended that \"the rubella vaccine34 should be given routinely to all children of both sexes at 12 months of age or as soon thereafter as possible, preferably in combination with measles and mumps vaccines3', and should be given to all female adolescents and women of childbearing age. There are no known adverse effects following administration of vaccine to immune women.\" Rubella vaccine was contraindicated in pregnant women. These statements seem to disregard known scientific information. If you inject a person with one of these vaccines, loaded with foreign proteins, non-human viral particles and carcinogenic substances, and these substances lie around latent in the system for years, doesn't this present a potential hazard for an unborn child to come? Of course, but these facts are deliberately disregarded, and the public just stands by, mute and hypnotized by this incredible line of pseudo-scientific jargon. Again, why the emphasis on injection of human females, if in their eyes the human females are the most susceptible to damage - unless the upper echelon of the medical community, who has the knowledge of the effect of latent viral particles, the actual content of the vaccines, etc., is deliberately making the attempt to cause long-term degenerative disease in generations to come, thereby assuring the long-term existence of the pseuo-scientific 19th century medical paradigm. Yes, the \"reptilian bastards\" are at it again. In 1984, there was a study of the impact of rubella vaccination done in Australia that indicated that after 13 years of rubella vaccination, there was a notable increase in the proportion of rubella sero-positive pregnant women. Rubella vaccination of girls 12- 14 years old started in 1971. Interestingly, the study showed that 61% of girls were alrew immune to rubella before vaccination and that 76% of men were immune at 18-23 years of age.36 The deliberate injection of vaccines was unjustified within their own paradigm as indicated, yet it was done anyway. A study done in 1983~' on doctors, nurses and other hospital personnel indicated an average of 53% were not vaccinated against rubella. Over 22% of doctors in general and 9% of obstetricians had not chosen to be vaccinated with the rubella vaccine. The majority of screening hositals did not take measures to make general vaccination mandatory, regardless of the category of employee. Interesting.

It indicated a \" casual relationship\" between rubella vaccine and acute arthritis in 13-15% of adult women. However, they said, \" the evidence does not provide for reliable estimates of excess risk of chronic arthritis following rubella vaccine.\" Excess risk? Why take any risk at all? The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine continues to be administered and continues to cause problems in the population. In a 1991 issue of Doctor Weekly, congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) was reported in two babies of mothers who were vaccinated as teenagers with rubella vaccine. Orthodoxy on Rubella According to standard orthodox immunological description, \" rubella infection may be associated with significant morbidity (diseased states) in adults and is associated with a high degree of fetal wastage or anomalies if contracted in the early months of pregnancy. Because there is no evidence that persons who have previously received the vaccine or had rubella are at any risk of local or systemic reactions fiom receiving live rubella vaccine, testing for susceptibility before vaccination is unnecessary..\" \" Obviously, these statements are inaccurate, based on the evidence, and constitute fraud.

As many as 40% of vaccinees in large scale field trials (experiments) have had joint pain. Arthralgia and transient arthritis occur more fkquently and tend to be more severe in susceptible women than in children. Transient peripheral neuritic complains, such as paresthesias and pain in the arms and legs have occurred. There is no increase risk of these reactions for persons who are already immune when vaccinated. The vaccine virus is not transmitted fiom vaccinees to pregnant susceptible' contacts. Rubella vaccine should not be given to women known to be pregnant, not should a vaccinated women become pregnant within 3 months of a vaccination, because of theoretical risks to the developing fetus fiom rubella vaccine infection.

It is characterized by a self-limiting infection of short duration, moderate severity, and extremely low fatality which has maintained a remarkably stable biological balance over centuries. The period fiom first exposure to the appearance of symptoms is about 10 days. The characteristic feature of measles infection is the development of multimcleate grant cells, both epithelial giant cells (which appear in the respiratory lining) and what are called reticuloendothelial giant cells, which generally occur in lymphatic tissues, including the tonsils, lymph nodes, thymus and the spleen, for up to five days before the appearance of an external rash. The second stage of measles is characterized by this rash, which seems to occur about the 14th day after exposure, appearing first on the trunk and then extending to the lower extremities.The rash then fades and disappears, and improvement starts within two or three days as the antibodies disappear in the blood. The acute phase of the disease last for about 7 days. About 90% of all measles patients were 5 to 9 years old before the introduction of measles vaccines. By 1955, before the introduction of vaccines, the death rate fiom measles had declined 97.7%, and measles was beginning to disappear. Most human children acquired measles before they reach puberty. Many studies have been done of the epidemiology of measles. One such study was done on measle patterns in Baltimore, Maryland on cases fiom 1900 to 193 1. It was concluded that when 68% of children less than 15 years of age were immune to measles, epidemics did not This is basically the concept behind \" herd immunity\" . It is interesting to note that despite the fact that in the United States measles vaccines are given to 98% of the population, measles epidemics still occur at three to four year intervals, uninfluenced by vaccination pattern. The fact that these epidemics always occur, despite 98% vaccination compliance, means that the vaccination against measles in ineffective and a hud. Why, then, do they continue to promote the vaccine when it is useless? Why do the epidemics continue to occur? Why did they vaccinate for measles in the first place? Co-factorial Subversion of the Human Immune System It is also a well-known fact that naturally contracted measles is an important phase in the maturation of the human immune system. Why would anyone want to create a vaccine to stop or delay an important and well-documented phase of human immune Jystem development acquired through natural contraction of a mild disease? In 1963,"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO several kinds of \"vaccine\" were introduced with the intention of preventing naturally contracted measles. These vaccines included live attenuated measles virus and measles virus that had been \" inactivated with formalin, administered to almost 1,000,000 people between 1963 and 1967. Soon after the introduction of these vaccines, vaccinated children began to contract atypical measles, which is an especially vicious form that resists treatment, as well as a milder form of the virus with little or no rash which has the effect of causing children to develop chronic diseases, including cancer, later in life. It is a curious matter of record that cancer patients appear to have a particularly small number of infectious childhood diseases in their medical history. In 1985, studies found evidence of a relationship between measles with a lack of rash and increased incidence of degenerative and autoimmune diseases.43 An interesting study began in 1961 in Cincinnati which followed 386 children who had received three injections of vaccine containing \"killed measles virus. Of these 386 children, 125 had been exposed to measles and 54 of them developed the disease.44 A study in 1967 described the manifestation of atypical measles in 10 children who had received inactivated measles virus vaccineflve to six years earlier. Nine of the children developed pneumonia which resisted all treatment. Serious reactions occurred in children first injected with inactivated virus and then re-injected with live virus vaccine^.^' Despite the continuing episodes of serious local and systemic reactions to measles vaccines, and the obvious lack of effectiveness, medical officials continued to declare that measles vaccines were safe and effective. This constitutes fraud and criminal negligence. Medical authorities blamed the reports of vaccine failure and atypical measles on \"improper storage\" and \" children vaccinated at too young an age\", refusing to believe that the vaccine was the problem. Those in upper echelons knew what was happening all along, but the majority of the medical community suffered from deliberately suppressed information, as did the general public. In 1973, reports of severe neurological disorders due to measles vaccination began to roll in. One such report described 80 cases of neurological disorders which began within 30 days after injection with measles vaccine. The fact that 45 of these children experienced neurological problems between 6 and 15 days after injection was a clue to the fact that more than a \" casual\" Sink between the vaccine and the neurological problems existed. Interestingly, this \"two week\" period seems to also apply to DPT and polio vaccines, as far as symptomological response is concerned. Zkis is why the cut-offpriod for reporting adverse eflects from vaccines has been established - to avoid the period when most adverse events actually occur. Measles vaccine can cause fatal conditions such as ataxia (lack of coordination), retardation, hyperactivity, aseptic meningitis, seizures, paralysis,46 and generalized encephalitis.

Those who socially manuvered themselves to be declared \"medical authorities\" continue to voice the \" benefits\" from alleged \" protection\" given by \" vaccines\", yet they are indifferent to the fact that measles epidemics continue consistently in llly vaccinated children. In the 1970's adults began contracting measles for no apparent reason. This never happened before the introduction of measles \"vaccines\". In 1978, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health announced \" a new effort to free the United States from measles by 1981,\" and a new vaccine initiative was launched. You will remember that the typical age of the measles patient before the introduction of measles vaccine was 5-9 years old. After the introduction of vaccines, 64% were older than 10 years of age. The average age during the outbreak at the University of California was 20-24 years - 91% of those had been vaccinated against measles. After 198 1, the United States was hit repeatedly by major epidemics, thanks to the new vaccine \" initiative,\" and most epidemics were in lliy \" vaccinated\" communities, with atypical measles presenting itself as a continuing problem. Adults, and now babies under 2 years old, thanks to the vaccines, were contracting measles. Furthermore, compulsory measles vaccination programs were always done with vaccines which had always been found to be ineffective during outbreaks of measles. As has been the consistent pattem, medical authorities sought a semantic solution to the paradox. In 1984, they declared that a child that is in the state of being immunologically sensitized, but not immune, is in a state of \"inadequate immunity.\" Ironic, isn't it? The answer to a failed vaccine, and a failed vaccine concept, was to vaccinate more. This circular logic persists to this day, because people can't join together and \"just say no.\" In 1985, medical authorities had the audacity to state that \" sustained transmission in a totally vaccinated community has not been demonstrated\" and \"the major reason for failure to achieve elimination of measles appears to be the fact that some persons for whom vaccine is indicated have not been vac~inated.~\" This was a deliberate falsehood, and they went unchallenged. Meanwhile, the measles virus vaccine continued to do its part undermine the general immune system of the population. Now, since natural immunity to measles and its contribution to the development of the human immune system had been thwarted, and generations of children with this so- called \" inadequate immunity\" would grow into adults with no placental immunity to pass 47 Menkes, J.H, 1980; Wei7.man et al, 1982; Bannister, 1978; Posner, 1987. \" Frank, et a1 \"Major impedments to measles elimination\" American Journal of Disabled Children, 1985, Vol 139, ~881-888."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO on to their children, who would contract measles at an age when babies are normally protected by maternal antib~dies.~~ Measles Infection and Mitigation with Vitamin A There is evidence that measles virus infects and damages epithelial tissues throughout the body, and in the process severely diminish the concentration of Vitamin A in the body. In a study published in 1987, children under 2 years old receiving Vitamin A supplements of 200,000 IU orally immediately on admission with measles survived those who did not by a factor of 7.\" Vitamin A is essential for proper performance of epithelial tissues. Another interesting development is that some children seem well protected and survive measles vaccine, but have an increased risk of death fiom a variety of other diseases in the years following administration of measles vaccine,51 conceivably because the level of allergic sensitization of the population is being steadily enhanced by the number of mandated vaccination programs. Racial Sensitivity Differences to Vaccines and Subsequent CNS Manifestations Another interesting fact is that some races suffer more neurological damage fiom diseases like measles and whooping cough (andfiom the vaccines) and greater intellectual impairment and subsequent behavioral disorders. A 1964 controlled study in Baltimore found that blacks suffered disproportionately fiom diseases like whooping Blacks are also known to suffer more than whites fiom conditions that are the product of encephalitis, such as epilepsy and asthma,53 sometimes as much as 2.5 times in the case of asthma. Dyslexia is also higher in American blacks than in white^.'^ AU of this might seem to indicate that part of the overall plan of post-vaccinal disease might be racially motivated. It is interesting, considering this point, that all of the experimental vaccine programs of the World Health Organization have been initially performed in Africa. ~lso, the fact that black babies are predisposed to low birth weight and prematurity matches interestingly with the known fact that both conditions are also related to demyelination of immature nervous systems, predominantly because of vaccine damage.55 Of course, it would be human nature to try to mitigate post-vaccinal behavior disorders with drugs, which the government also conveniently supplies to inner city communities. Curious, isn't it. It is also curious that the hypersexuality which often parallels post-vaccinal minimum brain damage (MBD) is so inherent within the development of inner-city \"rap\" music - 49 Lennon et al, \"Maternally derived measles immunity in an era of vaccine-protected mothers\" Journal of Pediatrics, Vol 108 No.1, p.671-676.

Of course, such trends in black susceptibility would be noticable at an early stage of mass vaccination. They were. In 193 1, the chairman of the White House Committee on Communicable Disease Control (WHCCDC or wick-dick), George Bigelow, noted the \" higher fatality rates among Negroes and American Indians\" but theorized that they were \"more likely due to living conditions than to inherent hypersusceptibility.'756 Inherent hypersusceptibility? Sounds like they knew in 193 1 what was going on, doesn't it. It is also a fact that people forced into a socioeconomic situation of poor nutrition and a deficiency in vitamin A would suffer more severely from measles, especially atypical measles, adding to the problem. During the major measles epidemic in the United States in 1989, measles occurred in large numbers in black and hispanic preschool children living in the inner city. The 1989 measles epidemic in Chicago really brought out the racial statistics. The epidemic affected over 2,000 people. Afiican Americans suffered 71% of the cases, Hispanics 23% and the remaining 6% occurred in Caucasians. Over 32% of the cases were in infants less than 15 months old, well below the minimum age for receiving the vaccine, and well below the pre-vaccination era of 5-9 years old.\" As a result of the Chicago epidemic, the health department curiously lowered the minimum age for receiving a vaccination twice, finally dropping it to 6 months of age, which ironically guarantees the maximum neurological damage from the viral vaccine, the subsequent neurological problems, the subsequent behavior disorders, and the institution of\" publically demanded subsequent social control mechanisms when things get out of hand. See how it works yet? Oddly, the same pattern was followed during the measles epidemic in 1967, and again the epidemic went on unchanged. Disregarding this historical evidence, why did they do it again in 1989, unless another aged exists underneath this rather insane behavioral manifestation by medical authorities. Orthodoxy on Measles \"Measles is often a severe disease. Measles elhination in the United States have resulted in record low numbers of reported measles cases. While the number of reported measles increased in 1989, chances remain low that indiviakals will be epsed to natural measles. Most persons born before 1957 are likely to have been infected naturally and generally need not be considered susceptible. A single dose of live, attenuated measles vaccine induces antibody formation in at least 95% of susceptibles vaccinated at 15 months of age or older. A second dose is expected to induce immunity in the 5% who do not respond to the first dose. Primary vaccination may be associated with mild fever and transient rash. Central nervous system conditions including encephalitis and encephalopathy (minimal to severe brain damage) have been reported, however the % Wilson, G., The Hazard oflmmunization, London, Athlone Press, 1967.

There is no evidence of a greater risk of reaction to live measles for those who have previously received live measles vaccine or had natural measles. Although recipients of killed vaccine may be more likely to experience local and systemic reactions after revaccination with live measles vaccine, these individuals should be revaccinated to avoid the severe to avoid the severe atypical form of disease which often occurs after their exposure to natural measles. Live measles vaccine is now produced in chicken embryo cell culture. Persons with a history of anaphylactic reactions should be vaccinated only with extreme caution. The replication of live measles vaccine virus may be enhanced in patients with immune deficiency diseases and by the suppressed immune responses that occur with leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, antimetabolites and radiati~n.\"~~ Mumps Mumps are also a rather benign childhood viral disease which seems to contribute to development of the human immune system. Women, for example, appear to be less likely to contract overian cancer if they had mumps during childhood59. Adults who contract mumps, however, can sustain severe neurological damage. The scenario with mumps is very similar to that of measles, in that a policy was followed of suppression of clinical symptoms by vaccine administration. Mumps appears to cause a very mild meningitis or meningoencephalitis that manifests itself up to 23 days after infection, with possible encephalitic symptomology including drowsiness, irritabiity, dizziness, convulsions, psychosis and axatia, but more commonly enlargement of the parotid salivary gland and occasional enlargement of the testicles in 20-30% of adolescent or &It malesM. The first vaccines were tested in the 1950's, and were produced by American Cyanamid Chemical Company using chicken embryos with the virus inactivated using formalii. The vaccine was first tested on institutionalized orphans and mental patients fiom one to eight years old. Interestingly, one of the three institutions participating in the test had never had a case of mumps. After the vaccine was introduced, the first cases of mumps appeared within 90 days and continued to manifest themselves during the entire testing period. Another case of the vaccine causing the disease. There were indications in 1967 that the viral vaccine was causing the disease in children. A study was conducted using live attentuated viral vaccine on children, many of whom contracted clinical mumps within 16 days of being inje~ted,~' and the outbreak continued for several months.

Furthermore, 65% of those tested showed antibodies for mumps already in their systems before the vaccine was needlessly administered. In 1980, reports surfaced of atypical mumps in previously vaccinated children during general viral outbreaks,62 with symptoms including fever, appetite loss, nausea, and a generalized rash. The atypical mumps occurred when wild natural mumps virus circulated among unvaccinated children - a normal event associated with immune system development in humans. All the children contracting atypical mumps had been injected with viral vaccine five to seven years earlier. In 198 1, an outbreak of mumps occurred in Massachusetts. Out of 33 children involved, 29 had been injected with mumps virus, and 97.4% of unvaccinated children in the locale did not contract mumps.63 Since 1986, there has been an increase in the incidence of mumps in the United States, with many of the new cases among high school students - far above the age when natural mumps was contracted before the start of murnps/MMR vaccine use.64 The conclusion by some medical people was that \" not enough people had been vaccinated\", a statement which is not supported by published information on the incidence of mumps and the rate of vaccine injection, with over 80,000,000 doses of mumps virus vaccine already- pumped into the population. In fact even when vaccine compliance was low, the incidence of mumps was As compliance increases, so does the incidence of mumps, oh resulting in quite substantial outbreaks. Medical personnel increase the problem by fostering mass vaccination campaigns during epidemics they themselves initially cause with the vaccines66 - another pattern with similiaries relative to other vaccines. It is absolute criminal negligence. In 1989, it was finally determined that it was the strain of virus used in the vaccine that caused mumps meningitis.

It was concluded that mumps, as naturally contracted, is a generally mild disease, tending to occur early in life, with no documented mortality. The need to inject individuals with viral vaccines was not clear, but it was eventually decided that injection of children with MMR vaccines was \"cost effective.\" Other instances have been cited relative to mass immunizations with mumps and subsequent outbreaks, or lack of them. From 1967 to 1977, both the incidence of vaccination for mumps and mumps outbreaks were low. Ten years later in 1987 a mass vaccination campaign for mumps was started in Chicago for no apparent reason - there were no reports of mumps. Immediately after the campaign mumps went rampant in Chicago for seven months, primarily affecting those 20 years old and older. One of the most disturbing trends with mumps, like other diseases, is the shift fiom children toward adults, who are more susceptible to complications of testicular and ovarian infection. Medical personnel creating a disease epidemic again? Yes. Part of the population control program? Maybe. All of this clearly illustrates what is really happening. Why would these people be so determined to continue this policy, despite all of this published evidence, unless it was a conscious intentional act geared toward creation of disease, subsequent profit, and prolongation of their warped paradigm? Orthodoxy on Mumps \"Mumps is primarily a disease of young, school-age children. Vaccination against mumps is not a requirement for entry into any country. Susceptible children, adolescents and &Its should be vaccinated with a single dose of vaccine unless vaccination is contraindicated. Combination with measles and rubella vaccines should be considered. Mumps vaccine can be of particular value for children approaching puberty and for adolescents and adults, particularly males, who have not had mumps. Persons can be considered susceptible unless they have documentation of previous vaccination on or after the first birthday, physician-diagnosed mumps, or laboratory evidence of immunity. Many persons in the U.S. will receive two doses of mumps vaccine as a result of the new two- dose schedule for MMR vaccination which is now recommended in the United States to control measles. Because there is no evidence that persons who have previously either received the vaccine or had mumps are at any risk of local or systemic reactions fiom receiving live mumps vaccine, testing for susceptibility before vaccination is unnecessary. \" Forsey et al, \"Mumps vaccines and meningitis\" Lancet Vol340, p980, 1992. 510"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO Diphtheria Diptheria is an acute infectious disease caused by a bacterium characterized by development of a membrane on the epithelium of the throat which causes soreness. The membrane development may interfere with breathing. Diphtheria is serious but it is an extremely rare disease. In 1980, the number of cases in the United States numbered less than 5. In Nazi Germany, diphtheria vaccine injection was made mandatory in the late 193OYs, resulting in a 17% increase in the disease and over 600 deaths. The disease rate fell after injections were stopped. During an epidemic in Chicago in 1969, a full 25% of cases had already been injected with diphtheria vaccine, and 12% showed 111 immunity. The evidence suggests the vaccine was worthless and contributed to the incidence of the condition. Diphtheria vaccine is a toxoid vaccine which includes the actual toxins produced by the Diphtheria organism, slightly modified through treatment with heat or chemicals. A bacterial toxin homes in on specific organs of the body. In the case of Diphtheria, the organ is the adrenal gland. Diphtheria antitoxin is produced by injecting Diphtheria toxins into a horse. Blood, containing animal viruses, proteins foreign to humans and the reactive substances from the horse immune system in response to Diphtheria toxins, is removed from the horse and allowed to clot. The antitoxin serum which weeps out of the clot is then treated with an antibiotic and is subsequently injected into humans as \"vaccine\" to theoretically enable the human to deal with subsequent toxins produced by theoretical &re contact with the Diphtheria bacteria. The only other way to create supposed antitoxins in humans is to inject weakened Diphtheria bacteria into them. The first vaccines outside of Gemany for Diphtheria were generally introduced about 1939. Between 1939 and 1942 it became evident that, paradoxically, the presence of Diphtheria antitoxin in human blood did not prevent contraction of the disease, and finhermore there were people working in Diphtheria clinics who were unvaccinated for Diphtheria who had the organisms in their blood who never showed symptoms of the diseaseen Despite the existence of these paradoxes, vaccines were disseminated and appeared to have a remarkable effect on the incidence of the disease in Britain in the short term period between 1940 and 1955. When the disease is examined on a larger time scale, it is evident that the largest drop in Diphtheria occurred between 1865 and 1875, before the bacteria had even been isolated, indicating the spread of the disease was on the way out all by itself. The antitoxin was first used experimentally around 1900, and coincided with a large drop in recorded cases. Orthodoxy does not have much to say, except \"Diphtheria remains a serious disease throughout much of the world. Most cases occur in unimmunized or inadequately immunized persons.\" No level of antitoxin provides absolute protection.73 However, current recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend DT doses at 2,4,6 and 12-15 months of age, well before the immune system and neurological myelination processes have progressed. 72 Chaitow, L., Vaccination and Immunisation , Essex, England, pp42-43.

The organism, which is found in soil and the intestinal tract of some farm arnimals, usually enters the body through an open wound. The incubation period for the microorganism varies fiom one day to three weeks. Treatment is harsh, and involves the use of artificial airways, muscle relaxing drugs, antibiotics and antitoxins - in short, hell on earth for whomever contracts the condition. Since 1976 there have been less than 100 cases in the United States, and the majority of these have been in individuals over the age of 50. Between 1982 and 1984,9 cases occurred in children. No deaths occurred in anyone under 30 years old. The vaccine compliance rate is about 95% with school age children. Prior to widespread vaccines for this condition, there were about 500 cases per year. It has never been adquately addressed to whether individuals should unequivocally receive the vaccine without receiving an injury first. The tetanus vaccine is another toxoid vaccine. It elicits a reaction of swelling, redness and abcesses in 3-13% of those receiving the inje~tion'~, and allergic reactions have been documented with repeated exposure75. Long term side effects are currently unknown. Vaccination is given in a series of four injections which appears to provide protection for 10 years. There is no known reason to inject infants with the tetanus toxoid, especially because the infant immune and nervous systems are not developed and the true effect on the system of the toxoid is unknown. Children under two years old are not at risk of contracting tetanus, according to the available research. The first injections should not be given earlier than 12 months of age, and then every 10 years thereafter. Serious wounds might demand tetanus immune globulin, made fiom human tissue sources, which contains antibodies to the tetanus bacterium; this must be provided within 48 hours or less after any serious injury. If in doubt, contact a qualified health professional. Tetanus toxoid or immune globulin (TIG) can be acquired not in combination with any other vaccine, but of course you never know what else is in the vaccine you receive.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, is an infectious childhood disease caused by the presence in the body of a bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is characterized by a spastic cough consisting of short respiratory bursts followed by a long inhalation, often accompanied by vomiting and expulsion of periodic mucus plugs from the respiratory tract. The cough has a characteristic \"whooping\" sound. The disease can last as long as six weeks, no matter what treatment is applied. Complications can include cerebral bleeding, fever, convulsions, brain damage, pneumonia, emphysema, collapsed lungs and death. The disease still occurs as a common childhood disease, although the severity of the disease seems to have diminished somewhat over time. Before 1940, most children suffered some fonn of the disease. Several thousand cases a year still manifest themselves. Between 1976 and 1985, between 4 and 11 deaths occurred per year fiom pertussis. For parents, it can be a terrifying experience to see your child under the influence of this bacterium. More complications occur from receiving the pertussis vaccine than from the disease itself, as we shall see. Several books have been written about pertussis vaccinen, especially in combination with diphtheria and tetanus vaccine in a trivalent mixture dubbed 'DPT'. Most adverse reactions to vaccines reported to the National Registry involve reaction to DPT vaccines, and the DPT vaccine is estimated to cause some degree of minimal brain damage in all chil&en, some more than others, and is ultimately the most signifcant vaccind cofactor in the signzjicant upswing of abberant behavior in the population for the past several generations, even modlfjnng genetic structure. We discuss this progression in a special chapter in this book, and we will discuss DPT later in a separate section. Pertussis vaccine has a historical reputation for causing neurological damage in the human brain, ranging fiom very mild outwardly imperceptible damage which later manifests itself in more severe symptomology, to more severe brain damage, retardation or death. The vaccine can produce learning disabilities, attention deficit disorders and behavioral problems, and many reactions do not manifest themselves until later. This causes some difliculty in proving temporal relationship to the vaccine, at least in the eyes of medical orthodoxy, and is most often the reason why they continue to get away with injecting the population with this dangerous vaccine, since orthodox medicine deliberately establishes a cutoff time for reporting that occurs before most symptoms manifest themselves, providing a temporal buffer which undercuts the true volume of reaction to the vaccine and assures continued administration of the vaccine to the population. Typically, an initial seizure manifests itself soon after injection, followed by a continuing pattern of seizures lasting for weeks, followed by obvious mental and/or motor retardation during the months or years that follow.

The idea of the study was to once and for assess the risk involved with vaccines for pertussis by examining cases where people were hospitalized following injection. The response of medical orthodoxy to the controversy was that the vaccine \"brought out symptoms that would have occurred anyway,\" which of course was a transparent attempt at spin control. DPT and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) Three recent studies have found a temporal association between infant death, including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and administration of DPT vaccine, of which pertussis is a main component.78 Not surprisingly, orthodox medicine rejected the results of the studies, despite the obvious nature of the problem. The American Academy of Pediatrics \"Task Force on ~ertussis\"~~, who had a obvious conflict of interest, concluded that \"there is no convincing evidence for a causitive role for DPT in SIDS\" after reviewing these studies, plus four other ones, that scientifically and statistically demonstrated a clearcut temporal connection between DPT and SIDS.'~ There is clearcut evidence that when Japan raised the pertussis vaccine age to 2 years old, SIDS virtually disappeared.81 Japan has the lowest infant mortality rate in the world. The United States ranks 20th since it enforces injection of children under two years old. In March of 1979, the Tennessee Department of Health reported to the CDC that since November 1978, four infants who had been vaccinated with DPT died within 24 hours. Why did they wait four months to make the report? All the children who died received their first DPT and oral polio vaccine (OPV). Between August 1977 and March 1979, 52 \"deaths of infants from SIDS or unknown causes \" were recorded. In 1982, at the 34th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, William C. Torch referred to the Tennessee deaths and over 200 reported SIDS cases. In his published abstract, he wrote that 66% of the first 70 cases had been ''immunized'' prior to death. In the DPT - SIDS group, 6.5% died within 12 hours of DPT injection, 13% within 24 hours, 26% within 3 days, 37% within 1 week, 61% within 2 weeks, and 70% within three \" Bd, Ablon, and Weiss, \"Possible temporal association between DPT vaccine and sudden infant death syndrome\" Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, Vol 2, 1983; Torch, W, \"DPT immmbzation: a potential cause of the sudden infant death syndromen Neurology, Vol32, 1982; Waler, Jick and Perera et al, \"DPT immunization and sudden infant death syndrome\" American Journal of Public Health Vol 77, 1987. 79 AS a side note, it is well known that in this society, everything is the exact opposite of what it appears to be, and a \"task forcen always seems to represents an organized effort between a number of parties, in secret, to undermine attempts to get at the truth.

SIDS deaths outside of vaccination normally occur in the autumn or winter, but was non-seasonal in the DPT group. His conclusion was that \"DPT vaccination may be a generally unrecognized major cause of sudden infant and early childhood death, and that the risk of immunization may outweigh its potential benefits. A need for re-evaluation and possible modification of current vaccination procedure is indicated by this study.\" Predictably, Torch was heavily criticised for his study and his conclusions. Damage and spin control was quickly implemented, and several \"studies\" quickly followed which concluded that there was \"no evidence of a casual link between DPT injections and SIDS.\" These studies, in turn evoked some critcism, and the game has been going back and forth. Meanwhile, babies and young children are being mercilessly killed. In 1986, Connaught Laboratories, a maker of DPT vaccine, included on their package insert, \"SIDS has occurred in infants following the administration of DPT. One study has showed no casual connection.\" In 1991, Wyeth Laboratories, another maker of DPT vaccine, included in the package insert that \"the occurrence of SIDS has been reported following administration of DPT. The significance of these reports is unclear.\" Pertussis Vaccine Trials One method of scientific investigation on efficacy of a substance is to do trials which involve a test group, which is given the substance, and a control group which is given a placebo, consisting of sugar water or a neutral substance, or nothing at all. All too often, either the trials themselves or the results are falsified in order to produce a speczfic result, especially when those conducting the trials are beiig paid by those who wish a specific outcome, subverting the scientific method. Obviously, any experiment or result falling in this category is completely invalid. Also invalid is any safety experiment which is funded by those who have a hcial interest in the outcome of the experiment. Safety tests must be done by an independent party with no connections to anyone with an interest in the outcome. Thus, all tests for sajety of drugs or vaccines done by or paid for by companies who make the drugs or vaccines involve a conflict of intrest and potential hancial gain - the results must always be questioned, especially in the face of exisfing controversy relative to the product in question. The pertussis vaccine, because of its insidious characteristics, has been the subject of some really imaginative coverup efforts by medical authorities. Trials conducted in the United States in 193 1 by the AMA seemed to indicate that the vaccine did not make a sigdicant difference, and the Council and Pharmacy and Chemistry recommended withdrawal of the pertussis vaccine as unreliable.** Trials on the value of pertussis vaccine, relative to its abiity to prevent pertussis, were conducted in England from 1942 to 1944 on children attending welfare clinics and day nurseries. The results, published in 1945, indicated that the vaccines were ineffective, because no 82 The AMA did not become fully entrenched in the medical-industrial complex until the 1940's.

In trials conducted in Oxfordshire, of those who developed whooping cough, 12.5% had been vaccinated and 14.1% were ~nvaccinated.~~ In 1987, during 28 months of surveillance on the persistence of pertussis on Novia Scotia, 526 cases of pertussis were identified. Of the patients that came down with pertussis, 91% had received at least three doses of pertussis vaccine.84 \"Doctored \"Pertussis Trials and Possible Bacterial \"Doping\" of Vaccines British medical authorities, disappointed that the pertussis vaccine was not being implemented as planned, decided to conduct a mass trial of over 8,000 children. Half of the children were to be the test subjects who were injected with the pertussis vaccine. The control group, instead of being left alone or given a neutral placebo, were injected with a mixture of four bacteria.'* The control group injected with the four bacteria were designated as the \"unvaccinated group\". Twenty percent of the children fiom both groups were monitored fiom 24 to 72 hours after injection. Only reactions to the pertussis vaccine group were noted. Local or systemic reactions in the control group were ignored. The rate of pertussis was 18.2% in those vaccinated with pertussis and 87.3% in the \"control\" group. Was the four-bacteria mixture a covert test for a means to induce a higher rate of pertussis? Obviously, the \"control\" group was not a true control group in this test, since the \"unvaccinated group was \"vaccinated with a solution containing bacteria which also functioned as foreign proteins to the control group, artificially lowering their resistance, in order to artificially produce results that would show the \"unvaccinated\" group to be more prone to get pertussis than those receiving the pertussis vaccine. In 1986, the Swedish medical authories conducted trials of Japanese acellular pertussis vacciness6 on 3,800 children, six to eleven months old. The children were divided into two groups of 1,400, each of whom were given the two test vaccines, and a group of about 950 babies, the control group, who were given a \"placebo\". The \"placebo\", instead of being a neutral substance, was a solution containing a tissue fixative (formalin), thiomersal (a preservative containing mercury) and aluminum phosphate. All these chemicals are the typical substrate for many vaccines - in other words, it was the vaccine solution without the pertussis bacterium. So, we have three groups: Vl,V2 and P1 (vaccine 1, vaccine 2 and placebo). Within 24 hours, there were members of all three groups that experienced systemic vomiting (avg 4%), fever ( avg 5.4%) and drowsiness (avg 6.7%) with two doses of vaccines and placebo. This was quite interesting, because it indicates that the substrate itself is capable of causing neurological symptoms, and it is a common substrate for many vaccines, not only pertussis. Vomiting, persistent crying and drowsiness usually sigtllfy brain swelling or encephalitis. A fifteen month followup was done with all three groups (Vl,V2,Pl), and it was found there was no correlation between - --- 83 McFarlan et al, British Medical Journal, 1945. 84 Halperin et al, 1989, Journal of Pediatrics, Vol 1125, p.686-693, \"Results of Nova Scotia meill..\" 85 A mixture of Staphylococcus, Streptoaxcw, Corynebacterium hofmanni and Neisseria catarrhalis. 86 Sweden stopped using \"whole cell\" pertussis vaccine in 1979.

However, we got something more out of this study - that the substrate containing mercury and aluminum compounds, as well as formalin, produced neurological damage in a percentage of children, especially babies, whose nervous system is relatively unprotected. The pertussis bacterium simply aggrevates the reaction fbrther and takes advantage of the situation created by the substrate. Why has no one realized this before? Sensitization of the Immune System by Repeated Vaccination and Production of Systemic Invasive Bacterial Infection The Swedish test of the Japanese acellular pertussis vaccine also produced some other interesting results. Eleven babies in groups V1 and V2, those who received the two types of acellular pertussis vaccines, also contracted systemic bacterial infection^.^^ Four babies died. Five babies in PI, the placebo group, contracted systemic bacterial infections, but none died.88 This indicates that the substrate, combined with the bacterial and viral antigenic components as a \"vaccine\" is even more biologically h-1 in ways beyond the pertussis component. The majority of bacterial infections surfaced after the second dose of vaccine, and is compatible with the observed peak occurrence of invasive bacterial infections between 6 and 11 months of age - just when most babies acquire their second injection of trivalent DPT. The fact that repeated injection of antigens can lead to hyperimmunization is well kno~n,~~and can lead to myrocarditis, or enlargement of the heart. The Swedish trials ended in 1987. In the end the Swedish National Bacteriological Laboratory witMew the application for licensing of a Japanese pertussis vaccine, and noted that the efficacy of the acellular vaccine was probably lower than the whole-cell pertussis vaccine abandoned in 1979. When one considers the type of systemic bacterial infections fiom the vaccine, it raises the legitimate question as to whether vaccines are assisting in the rising incidence of meningitis and Haemophilus influenza B in industrialized countries. Are they deliberately \"doping\" vaccines with other substances to create other problems \"to be conquered\"? How would we know, since medical authorities and the upper echelons of the medical industrial complex have historically demonstrated that they cannot be trusted? Is there any casual evidence that this might be the case? In 1 99 1, a study on Alaskan native children yielded data which provided evidence of a casual link between DPT injections and invasive bacterial injections.g0 The highest incidence of invasive bacterial infection occurred after the 3rd injection - a process '' The infiions fiom the vaccinated group also included meningitis, pneumonia and Haemophilus flu.

Why else would American doctors be oblivious to encephalitic effects of vaccines administered to young babies in the United States? Why do they \"have trouble\" reviewing world literature and seeing that pertussis vaccine does not protect against pertussis? It's incredible, yet true. It has to be a criminal conspiracy at the highest level. The Connection Between Pertussis Vaccines and Hib Influenza Meningitis Systemic infections associated with Haemophilus Influenza B (Hib) are appearing more and more frequently in the United States, England, Australia and Scandinavia. It is strongly associated with most cases of meningitis, penurnonia, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis and pericarditis. Three quarters of all foxms of Hib occur in children less than 18 months old and the rest in children more than 24 months of age. Analysis of meningococcal disease indicates a 400% increase since 1942. Between 1942 and 1965 the incidence fell and then started to climb after 1965. This trend can be directly correlated with the introduction in the 1940's of ma.w vaccination for pertussis and the subsequence variance in compliance and public a~ceptance.'~ The increases in bacterial meningitis have been in babies 3 months and older. Have you noticed that Hib and its vaccine is being stressed in 1994 and 1995? Is it a process of using one vaccine \"doped with contaminants and chemicals to create the next \"crisis\" and the artificially created \"need for the next vaccine? The total package of evidence is very persusive and supports this overall conclusion. You must decide, based on your research and the evidence presented.

Incredibly, in the face of their own conclusions, they released a report that concluded \"there is no demonstrated association between DPT vaccination and SIDS, because sudden death @er pertussis vaccination is too rare to be detectable in the context of presently available series. \" There are 10.000 cases of SIDS in the United States each vear. The conspiracy runs deep. In the 1990 Journal of the American Medical Association an editorital clearly labelled vaccine- induced encephalopathy 'ti myth': ironically accusing the American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) 'hd other well-meaning physicians\" of 'joining forces with parents groups and lawyers.\" Ironic, because the AAP was the one who recommended in 1992 that babies in the United States should be given five doses of pertussis vaccine. It is interesting how the AAP changed their tune within two years. The end result of this insanity led to the formation of the National Vaccine Injury Program. Another bit of irony is that finally in 1992, the Institute of Medicine admitted that \"the evidence is consistent with a casual relation between DPT vaccine and acute encephalopathy, dejined in the studies reviewed as encephalopathy, encephalitis or encephalomyelitis, and the evidence indicates a casual relation between DPT vaccine and anaphylaxis, between the pertussis component of DPT vaccine and protracted, inconsolable crying.\" In other words, brain damage in progress. Harvard Medical School and Federal Drug Administration Tests on DPT Vaccine Almost 50 years ago in 1948 two Harvard Medical School scientists, Randolph Byers and Frederick Moll, carried out tests on DPT vaccines at Children's Hospital in Boston and concluded that severe neurological problems followed administration of DPT vaccines.\" The results of the tests were published in Pediatrics, a respectable medical journal. They were ignored by the medical and pharmaceutical community, who had a vested financial interest in continuing the practice.

Again, toxoids are defined as the toxins emitted by organisms when they grow in a culture. Tetanus toxins are produced in culture consisting of beef heart infusion, containing by nature animal bacteria, viruses and antigens foreign to the human body, as well as dextrose (sugar), sodium chloride (salt) and casein (a bovine milk by- product). Diphtheria toxoids are produced in a similar manner. They used to be produced fiom antibodies gained from blood of horses injected with diphtheria bacteria. After it has been determined that a sufficient amount of toxic by-products have been produced, the cultures are filtered to obtain a reasonably clear solution containing the toxic cellular by- products of the bacteria, plus animal viruses and foreign protein antigens. Formalin is added to cause any particles left to clump. Formalin is a derivative of formaldehyde (a carcinogen used to embalm bodies).\" Wood alcohol, methanol (toxic) is added to cause the toxoid particles to precipitate into a fine powder. Whole cells of deadly pertussis bacteria that have been killed by thimerosal ( also known as merthiolate), a mercury compound, are added to the mixture. Over 35mg of thimerosal will kill a rabbit. Thimerosal also destroys the 'hotency\" of the vaccine, aEects growth patterns of human cells it comes into contact with, and inhibits the action of human white blood cells, inhibiting the process of phagocytosis.97 Thimersol is five times more toxic to human cells than it is for Staphlococcus bacteriag8 and, as a mercury compound, produces an allergic reaction in the body.\" A substance called an 'hdjuvant\", which initiates reactionary antibody formation, is added. Common adjuvants are aluminum hydroxide and aluminum potassium sulfate.100 The mixture is then put into vials for injection into children. In the body, the formalin coating dissolves, releasing all bacterial and viral particles fiom animal culture sources. The thimerosal and adjuvant chemicals irritate the body tissues and increase the action of accompanying bacteria and viruses, as well as the reaction of the immune system to the foreign protein antigens, severely damaging neurological membranes, especially in babies and children, where the myelin sheath has only partially protected the nervous system, resulting in mild to severe neurological damage, production of learning disabilities and other nervous system disorders, or death, especially upon subsequent injections where the % An experiment was once done injecting a 10% solution into the leg of a mouse.

This bit of research prompted Trueta and Hodes to make the suggestion that the factors which influence the severity and localization of polio might somehow mow the pattern of blood vessels in the nervous system, increasing the permeabii of the blood-brain bamer, giving polio easier access to both the brain and the nervous system. Experiments with formalin and other substances illustrated that these type of substances caused engorgement of blood vessels in areas corresponding to areas of paralysis. Their research, and subsequent work, has confirmed that some of the substances such as formalin that are routinely added to vaccines have the effect of increasing the severity of disease and the probablity of death, depending on the bacterium or viruses that are injected with these chemicals.

In other words, pertussis vaccine is able to accelerate latent infections into active acute infections. Since medical authorities fail to thoroughly examine people injected with vaccines, they cannot detect latent infections which can be reactivated by injection of vaccines and accompanying chemical preservatives and bacteriostatic drugs. Total Annual DPT Statistics for the United States DPT vaccines, no matter what the formulation, appear to have a devestating effect on the neurology of American children.

If 33,000 postmen shot themselves in the head each year, would there be notice taken of it? The fact that the slaughter and injuries have not stopped is due more to lack of mass awareness of the dimension of the problem. Efforts at Population Control Using Tetanus Toxin as a Carrier Leading Edge Research is a member of the National Vaccine Information Center, and as such we have access to a continual flow of valuable data and information concerning activities within the vaccination paradigm. One of the more interesting things to arise in 1995 was the revelation that the World Health Organization (WHO), in concert with the Centers for Disease Control, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Bank, the United Nations, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Population Council, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Great Britain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany and several universities, including those at Helsinki, Uppsala and Ohio State University, have been workzng for nearly 25 years on an anti-fertility vaccine using hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) tied to a tetanus toxoid vaccine. Two decades of medical journals have detailed their progress. By injecting a woman with hCG, using tetanus toxoid as a carrier, the woman's immune system not only produces antibodies against tetanus, but also produces anti-bodies against hCG. When the woman subsequently becomes pregnant, the hCG antibodies will cause her to abort her baby because there will be too little hCG (normally needed to maintain a pregnancy) in her body.

Acting Phillippine Health Secretary Jaime Galvez Tan estimated that \"fiom 1986 to 1990, immunization has averted 15,300 cases of neonatal tetanus.\" Quite a record after you shoot up millions of people, isn't it? WHO 'hams\" that 'because up to 5 million women were not 'immunized', 300 to 400 more babies will contract tetanus and die.\" Wait a minute, isn't something out of whack with the ratios here? Only 1 out of 12,500 babies is at risk? You mean a risk for .00008 percent of the population justifies injecting millions of people? There is obviously another agenda here. Actually, the first discovery that tetanus toxoid vaccines contained the hCG hormone was made in Mexico in the autumn of 1994, when members of the Comite Pro Vida de Mexico became suspicious of the protocols for the Mexican campaign: all males were excluded fiom the program and only women of reproductive age (1 5-45) were to be vaccinated. A member of the Comite happened to be a member of Human Lie International's World Council for Life and Family, who alerted HLI about the vaccine. Now, another issue is the fact that women, especially teenage women, were not informed about the hCG in the vaccine or about the risks from tetanus vaccine itself. In the Physicians Desk Reference, it describes the tetanus toxoids as being \"for adult use\" and that 'prior to the administration of this vaccine, health care personnel should inform the parent, guardian, or adult patient of the benefits and risks of vaccination against tetanus.\" In fact, people that are injected with vaccines, when they are given data at all, are given that data afier they are given the vaccine. This does not constitute informed consent. It constitutes negligence and fiaud, since vaccine benefits are largely anecdotal to begin with. \"' :Ottawa got blood tainted by HIV\" Ottawa Citizen, April 4, 1995.

Secondly, all the programs involve ethnic minorities who, if they were provided the cooperative assistance to upgrade their living conditions, would not need to be concerned about tetanus in the first place. Rather than upgrade the living conditions, world organizations preserve the status quo and then treat the symptoms of poor living conditions. Typical allopathic response to life, isn't it?

A New Proposed Guideline for Truth in Research No agency,company or entity which owes its existence to, or gets fbnding fiom, the fact of a social presence of a problem, can be allowed to be involved in an evaluative mode in any way relative to a solution to that problem, for a solution would mean its non-existance and the act involves conflict of interest. Nor can any company which owes its existence to, or gets fbnding from, the fact of a social presence of a problem be involved in any way that would contribute to the production of law or legislation, for an actual solution would launch the agency, company or entity into non-existence; the company must have the problem exist to exist itself, thus any action taken by such an entity must always be a conflict of interest. Nor can those who produce a product for public consumption define or research contraindications to that product, for that would be an internal conflict of interest and provide for litigation against the producer of the product. Thus, producers of a product are forced to cover up, deny, or redefine contraindications for self-protection and maintenance of income fiom that product. Nor can a company fund a study to prove safety of its product, for results in the negative would be a conflict of interest. All studies of this nature have no legitimacy. Actual solutions to problems require elimination of the source of the problem, instead of treatment of the symptom of a problem. Studies related to safety and efficacy must be done by independent parties not in any way connected to the producer of the product, the industry that the product lies within, or any agency, company or individuals connected in any way with the producer of the product in the past, present or future."},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Legal Considerations Relative to the Vaccination Paradigm The whole issue of vaccinations is paradoxical in that it is a complex one relative to legal matters, but it is relatively straightforward on its face. One would think that one would have a say about the disposition and care of one's health, but the truth is that the State views the matter quite differently. The most quoted legal case on the matter is one in 1905, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, but there are considerations put forward by the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade that initially need examination. Roe v. Wade, of course, dealt with the right to abortion. The Supreme Court chose Justice Blackmun to deliver the majority opinion in the case. According to Blackmun: \"The Court's decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. A state may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and protecting potential life ... It is not clear to us that the claim asserted that one has an unlimited right to do with one's body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the right of privacy previously articulated in the Court's decisons. The Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the past.' The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right to privacy, however the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. Only personal rights that can be deemed as \"fundamental\" or \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\" are included in this guarantee of personal privacy. The \"right\" has some extension to activities relating to maniage, contraception, family relationships, child rearing and education.\" In the Roe v. Wade case, the court found that the woman's prima facie right to abort her pregnancy could be defeated only by 'kompelling\" state interests - interests which varied with the particular trimester of pregnancy. This Compelling\" state interest also figured heavily into the Jacobson v. Massachusetts case, where the state felt it was compelled to ignore the fact that Jacobson and his son, who refbsed second injections of a smallpox vaccine, had become ill after the first injection. Jacobson took his case to the Supreme Court, where he maintained that the smallpox vaccination was in violation of his personal liberties under the 14th amendment, that fines or threats of imprisonment for refbsing to be vaccinated constituted unreasonableness and oppression, as well as an assault upon his person. He also focused on the unreliability of the vaccine to prevent smallpox in all cases and, using himself and his son as examples, the inherent dangers the vaccine presented to one's health. Furthermore, physicians at the time could exempt a child from vaccination if it was considered a threat to health. Adults were not allowed the same exemption. Since the law did not recognize medical testimony that would have proven that small pox vaccination would have endangered his health, any such evidence had to be excluded. The Supreme Court took the position that the individual liberties of a Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905) on vaccination; Buck v. Bell (1927) on sterilization. 527"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO single person are not absolute and must give way to reasonable restraint, in certain circumstances, when the safety, welfare and comfort of the majority are of issue, and the interests of the society are subordinate to the wishes or convenience of the few.This decision was rendered in 1905, and is the one used to support the policy. In 1905, the general data relative to the safety of the process of injection of foreign antigens was not known. Nevertheless, legal procedure falls back on this case in order to prevent the issue fiom coming to the surface, preventing the integration of currently known scientific data which would overturn the 1905 ruling. Furthermore, the Supreme Court stated the issue of whether the vaccine \"was the best method of preventing smallpox\"( whether it worked to prevent disease) was not the issue. The issue was that the common belief in the mass population that it worked was the issue. The Court went on to say: \"While we do not decide and cannot decide that vaccination is a preventative of smallpox, we take note that this is the common belief of the people of the State, and with this fact as foundation we hold that the statue in auestion is a health law, enacted as a reasonable and proper exercise of police power.\" The Supreme Court followed these remarks by saying that it did not hold absolute that an ahlt must be vaccinated (for smallpox) if the indivihal could demonstrate that he was an unfit subject for vaccination and that this \"unfitness\" could seriously impair his health or cause death if vaccination were given. In the case of Zimmennan v. Freeman, the Supreme Court maintained that \"compulsory vaccination laws, which deal with the health and safety of its citizens, take precedence, and the compulsory education statutes are subordinate to vaccination statutes. In other words, 'be don't care if they learn anything, as long as they can be medicated.\" The mandates for vaccination are based on what is called Compelling state interestn2, which rests on the concept of 'police power\" that lies subordinate to the constitution. However, vaccination laws may come under what is called the 'Vagueness Defined by Blacks Law Dictionary as an interest which the state is forced or obliged to protect. It is also employed to justify state action under \"police power of state\" ' Defined as the power of the state to place restmints on the personal Mom and property rights of persons for the protection of public safety, health and morals, or the promotion of the public convenience and general prosperity. Police power is subject to limitations of the federal and state constitutions, and especially to the requirement of due process. Police power is also defined as the soveriegn right of a government to promote order, safety, security, health, morals and general weke within constitutional limits and is defined as an essential attribute of government. The \"police\" per se, is defined as the branch of government which is charged with the preservation of public order and tfanquility, the promotion of the public health, safety, and morals, and the prevention, detection and punishment of crimes.

This would constitute~mdulent coercion of the public in order to maintain a procedure hazardous to the public health and safety. This is my view of the problem. Certainly the members of the Supreme Court arefilly aware of the issues behind vaccination - hence the statement that \"we do not decide and cannot decide that vaccination is a preventative .\" Since the Supreme Court admits that the principle behind vaccination is \"the common belief of the people of the Staten, and simultaneously (as seen in Griswold v. Connecticut) that \"Th State mav not, in the spirit of the First Amendment, contract the spectrum of available knowledae\", it would seem that a paradox exists where the Supreme Court is, in essence, sanctioning suppression4 of \"available knowledge\" in order to perpetuate a common belief that it uses as the rationale to permit continuation of vaccination policies.

From Switzerland there have been reported cases of meningitis.\" New York State Journal of Medicine, May 15, 1926. Technically speaking, encephalitis is defined as a brain inflammation1, and is a sub- class of a category of disease known as encephalopathy, generally defined as brain disease; physicians do not make a systematic distinction between these concepts, and they are used as synonyms. Physicians have always known that encephalitis can be caused by vaccinations/immunizations. One of the remarkable aspects of encephalitis is that it spawns a great variety of physiological, neurological, mental, behavioral and emotional symptoms. It can be seen by the quotes that preface this chapter that it was known as early as 1926 that encephalitis could readily be caused by vaccines. Encephalitis that appeared in an otherwise healthy human being after vaccination was initially considered to be \"atypical\", but it was realized that these \"atypical\" cases could in fact mimic meningitis, viral encephalitis, poliomyelitis and practically all acute diseases of the nervous system. This is true of encephalitis induced by anv vaccination. For example, let's look at DPT vaccines. According to studies in 1965 by Margaret Pittman, one of the most prominent pertussis vaccine researchers in the United States, pertussis vaccine (the \"P\" in the DPT vaccine) is one of the most dangerous childhood vaccines. It is a vaccine made from Bordetellapertussis, the same bacterium that causes the disease, and is unique in its marked ability to modii biological responses. One of the manufacturers of pertussis vaccine, Connaught Laboratories, stated in a 1986 package insert for pertussis vaccine that \"systemic reactions such as fever occur quite frequently. Respiratory dzflculties have been observed Moderate to severe systemic events such as a fever of 105\" or higher, and persistent inconsolable crying lasting three hours or more, unusual high-pitched screaming, collapse, or convulsions occur. More severe neurologic complications, such as a prolonged convulsion or an encephalopatly, occasionally fatal, have been reported Ana&hyIactic reactions have been reported Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has occurred in infants following adninistration of DPT.

The initial symptoms of post-vaccination encephalitis may be minimal, but this does not prevent other effects from manifesting later on, or mean that minimal brain damage has not occurred. Any researcher who ignores or rejects the possibility that vaccination can cause the most serious neurologic disorders in the absence of a marked acute reaction on an immediate basis is faced with fmding grounds for distinguishing post-vaccinal encephalistis from encephalitis due to other causes. A patient manifesting the typical long-term effects of vaccination is probably a victim of vaccination, even if no acute reaction was observed immediately subsequent to vaccination. 2 Relative to postencephalitic symptomology. ~edicall~ called \"opisthotonic posturing\", it often accompanies episodes of violent screaming and pain.

Encephalitis from causes other than vaccines is known to produce severe neurologic damage in the absence of an acute reaction.

Their article caused a bit of a sensation in scientific circles because of the basic inability of professions to imagine what the connecting thread among these disparate conditions could be.13 We now know that vaccinations are the connecting thread, but for physicians and professionals to openly admit that would mean the loss of their professional license and livelihood which, of course, would serve them right for participating in this insidious process in the first place. It must be strange to be trapped in that vicious circle of professional deceit. The fact that something was going on became apparent in 1943, when world famous child psychologist Leo Kanner described 11 cases of a new mental i~lness'~ in young people which he termed \"inborn autistic disturbances of affective contact\". Initially known as early infantile autism, these first cases emerged in the United States at the same time as vaccination against pertussis (whooping cough) was becoming increasingly widespread. One of the outstanding features of the autistic child was self-absorbed alienation, or the inability to relate themselves in the normal way to people and situations fiom the very beginning as infants, living in a world of their own. This also manifests itself as a gross and sustained impairment of emotional relationships with others, aloofhess, abnormal behavior toward other people as persons, difficulty in mixing or playing with other children. As these children become older, they appear to have almost a mechanistic finction and seem to be without emotional awareness of social interaction or empathic relatedness. No doubt, vaccinations seem to be the ultimate origin of the \"blind date fiom hell\" which we have all experienced at one time or another, and this emotional emptiness is typically what we see today with young people and the preceding several generations subject to vaccines. The longer the problem goes on, the worse everything becomes on a social level.

As the neurological basis for all of this was gradually understood, the characteristic alienation, withdrawal and ego weakness (initially seen as a casual observation) were discovered to be the effect of a sense-perception disorder. Ordinarily, when we receive information through the senses, we extract meaning and organize it in the form of concepts or ideas. These are stored in the memory and recalled when necessary. In this way, sense perception and memory assist in the acquisition of everience. Minimum brain damage, however slight, has an effect on this process. Severely autistic children seem to have a preoccupation with sensory impressions, and are unable to organize them into functional patterns. Furthermore, the process of maturing involves moving beyond concrete sense perception into the world of abstraction. This process is impacted by situations where immature development and organization of the fiontal and temporal lobes has taken place, hence the person affected cannot create and manipulate the symbols which normal people use to represent and act upon external reality. Testing of austistics has also disclosed damage to both the brainstem and cranial nerves. Thus, neurological research demonstrates that developmental delay reflects an actual biological delay in maturation of the brain and nervous system. This can manifest itselfin the failure to develop abstract reasoning and the relative inability to process symbolic information. In the 1960'~~ there was .a tremendous upsurge in childhood autism, and parents went in droves to psychiatrists. This increased prevalence of autism matches and reflects the expansion of mandated vaccination programs during the same time period. Today, autism is a real growth industry. The same parallels can be found in every country on the planet. But what does this have to do with most people, you ask, since most people do not appear to be classified .as autistic? The answer is that post vaccinal encephalitis manifests itself on a sliding scale of minimum brain damage that also manifests as other physiolog7cal and psychological conditions. Hyperactivity began to manifest itself within about a decade after the first cases of childhood autism began to appear in the mid-1950's. In 1963, the U.S. Public Health Service listed nearly 100 symptoms and signs associated with hyperactivity, and changed the designation to minimal brain &sfunction. The expression \"minimum brain damage\"(MBD) is more accurate, since dyshction is a consequence of actual brain damage.

It is probably the most common single entity seen in child guidance clinic^.\"'^ Even the Ivy League schools had something to say about MBD. A study at Yale Medical School in 1984 revealed that MBD is \"perhaps the most common and time-consuming problems in current pediatric practice.\"1g Even the AMA admits the severity of the objective problem.20 It is estimated that MBD affects up to 20% of school children *I, and is at this point referred to as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, which the schools are treating with Ritalin and other stimulant drugs.u These drugs themselves can induce hrther damage in children with MBD.\" Children who have MBD often have a limited attention span, even when of normal or superior IQ, and they do poorly in school because they are distracted easily and fail to complete work in the allotted time, often resulting in the label \"absent-minded\". MBD children may also have an excessively long attention span, and can spend a long time on a project until they are completely done. It is possible for children to grow out of MBD, but this happens only in very mild cases; attention span difficulties and other problems, however, can continue into adult life. There is no cure once MBD has occurred. Medical and psychiatric approaches to MBD, as mentioned, involve heavy use of drugs to suppress or modify symptoms of MBD. In the same way that researchers found that autism was associated with many nervous symptom problems in 1982, they found that MBD syndrome was associated with mental retardation, seizures, cerebral palsy and other neurological signs and problems which do not readily fit into behavioral or emotional categories, despite the concerted effort to fit them into such categories. Because autism is essentially an MBD problem, all the problems associated with it are also reflected in other MBD categories. That is, the MBD syndrome is also associated with left-handedness, clumsiness, seizure disorders, etc. '' Wender, Paul H., Minimal Brain Dyfinction in Children, New York, Wiley Interscience, 1971. l9 Shaywitz, S.E, \"Diagnosis and Management of Attention Deficit Disorder: A Pediatric Perspective\", Pediatric Clinics ofNorth America Vol3 1 NO 2, April 1984, pp.429-457. 20 The Journal of the American Medical Association in 1988 called MBD \"the single most prevalent disability reported by elementary schools and one of the most common referral problems to child psychiatry outpatient clinics. It is probably the most researched problem in child psychiatry\". Which of course explains why they will not admit the link to vaccination, as too much money is being made by treating a neurological deficit as only a psychological aberration. 21 Coulter, H., \"Vaccination, Social Violence and Criminality: The Medical Assault on the American Brain\", North Atlantic Books, 1990, p.60. Ritalin is the generic name for Methylphenidate. Children with existing MBD can develop Tourette Syndrome, involmtary tics, after taking Ritalin. Tourette Syndrome is a non-benign condition that makes the individual's life insupportable, causing many to commit suicide, and these new symptoms due to Ritalin can also be irreversible.

Another survey revealed that 13% of 20 year olds were lefties, compared to 5% of persons in their fifties.\" Sleep disturbances are also very common in this population25, and the emergence of MBD around 1955 also coincided with the emergence of this problem. Of course, it was viewed as strictly a psychiatric problem to be controlled with therapy and brain-altering drugs, fbrther damaging the brain and psyche of all concerned. Since 1970, a new condition in adults arose, labeled \"delayed sleep phase syndrome\" - inability to fall asleep before the early hours of the morning. MBD children grown up. In addition, urinary control problems accompany this MBD ~ondition.~~ Children, adolescents and adults with MBD can also have appetite disorders, refbsing to eat even when hungry. Those suffering from anorexia nervosa may in fact suffer from MBD, together with Psychosocial concerns about appearance. Anorexia can also be caused by the very amphetamines given to children to control hyperactivity. MBD children may also suffer fiom bulimia, also a condition which, like anorexia, came into prominence in the 1960's. Surveys indicate that 15% of adolescent girls in the United States experience serious problems with either anorexia or bulimia. Interestingly, hyperactivity seems to predominate in MBD males and eating disorders in MBD females - at least as visible physiological problems. Very often, the psychological and behavioral problems are much more severe. The Problem of Allergic Reaction to Vaccination As early as 1938, the relationship between allergies, vaccination and encephalitis has been a topic of medical investigation.*' In 1954, it was additionally' noted by researchers that the common factor in the pathology of encephalitis fiom vaccination was \"anaphylactic hypersensitivity.\"28 Stanford University performed experiments in 1983 which gave indications that children with existing allergies many overreact to pertussis vac~ine.~ It is interesting to note that 80% of autistic children and adults have severe allergies, as well as high levels of serotonin in the brain, released during the process of allergic and anaphylactic reaction. One of the most serious allergies is to products containing wheat or gluten. It is \" There is a possibility that the epidemic of vaccine-induced sub-clinical encephalitis since 1945 has generated a disproportionate incidence of left-handedness and ambidexterity in the under forty or under thirty age groups. 25 Kaplan, B.J., \"Sleep Disturbance in Preschool-Aged Hyperactive and Nonhyperactive Children\" Pediatrics, Vol7, 195 1, p.60-68. 26 Over 11 million adults are thought to have this problem.

It is interesting to note that the autoimmune diseases - rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, erythematosus, allergic rhinitis, wheat allergy (celiac disease), pernicious anemia and others also came to prominence in the 1950's. In 1970, researcher G.A. Rosenburg theorized that 'h autoimmune allergic mechanism has been postulated as the cause of post-vaccinal encephalitis, possibly with an initial invasion of the nervous system by a virus, with a subsequent antigen-antibody reaction\". In 1982, Israeli scientists found autistic children to have a 'bell mediated immune response to brain tissue\", suggesting that a neural autoimmune reaction may play a p&t in the pathogenesis of autism. Researchers in both France and the United States have found the immune system of autistic children to be hypersensitive. Of course, all this is 'Mer the fact\". It either does not occur to these researchers that the true source of the problem is the vaccination process, or they suspect it and are &aid for their lives or jobs, which of course depend on the true cause being hidden in the first place. The Mechanism of Encephalitic Damage from Vaccines One of the keys to understanding what is happening is to understand that the myelii sheath, the fatty protective coating around the nerves, spreads through the nervous system in developmental stages. The myelin sheath, in some nerves, does not even begin to grow until the child is at least eight months old. In fact, the growth of the insulating sheath proceeds at different rates in different areas in the nervous system for the first 15 years of life. In some areas, growth of myelin continues until the mid 40's. What does this mean? When cultural vaccination programs initiate neurotoxic processes in early childhood, it severely affects the development of the nervous system by impacting growth of the nervous system. Myelination processes begin in the phylogenetically older parts of the brain, such as the brain stem, and then moves to the areas of the nervous system that have developed recently in humans. Obviously, the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebral cortex are the last to be protected. The sheath is necessary for the development of the nerves, so when the cultural vaccination programs inject hdl toxins into a newborn infant or children, the myelination process is interrupted to one degree or another and MBD occurs. In 1947, Isaac Karlin suggested that stuttering was caused by 'delay in the myelinization of the cortical areas in the brain concerned with speech.\"30 In 1988, research by Dietrich and others using MRI imaging of the brains of infants and children from four days old to 36 months of age have found that those who were developmentally delayed had immature patterns of myelination. It has also been found that impairment of these processes can alter neural communication without necessarily causing severe CNS damage.31 So, 30~arlin, B.J, \"A Psychosomatic Theory of Stuttering\" Journal of Speech Disorders Vol 12, 1947, p.319.

Babies and children pay the price, and society pays the price when these individuals grow up and begin to exhibit aberrant behavior, affecting social structure, increasing crime and necessitating more authoritarian social control mechanisms. We can see that the assocition between post-encephalitic syndrome and either demyelination or incomplete myelination of the brain is pretty straight forward. In might be mentioned at this point that polio, or poliomyelitis, involves a breakdown of the myelin shealth, which causes paralysis. We also know that encephalitis, whether caused through disease or as a result of vaccination, can cause demyelination of the nerves, and that this has been known since the 1920's. The exact role of the allergic reaction in encephalitis was not completely understood until about 1935, with the discovery by Thomas Rivers of the phenomenon known as \"experimental allergic encephalomyelitis,\" or (EAE). Up until 1935, it was assumed that encephalitis was caused by some viral or bacterial infection of the nervous system, and a search began in the 1920's for some organism that might cause the problem. Rivers was able to produce brain inflammation in laboratory monkeys by injecting them repeatedly with extracts of sterile nod rabbit brain and spinal cord material, and this made it quite apparent that encephalitis was an allergzc reaction. This explains the association of allergies and autoimmune states with prior cases of encephalitis. In 1922, the smallpox vaccination program caused an outbreak of encephalitis, with a secondary result of Guillain-Barre Syndrome, an ascending paralysis ending in death. For some reason, the fact that the vaccinations were directly connected was hidden fiom the public until 1942.~~ In 1953 it was realized that some of the epidemic children's diseases, measles in particular, were demonstrating an increased propensity to attack the central nervous system. This indicated a growing allergic reaction in the population to both the diseases and the vaccinations for the diseases. In 1978, British researcher Roger Bannister observed that the demyelinating diseases were getting more serious \"because of some abnormal process of sensitization of the nervous system.\" I submit that the process of increased sensitivity was a normal occurance - it could only be seen as abnormal if the connection between the vaccines and the sensitization process, which by then should have been obvious with the research conducted, was deliberately ignored. The fact of the matter is that it is a matter of record that it was known that vaccinations produced encephalitis since 1926. The sensitization of the population was being enhanced by vaccination programs. Someone had to know, since the comection was a matter of record. Now, people who suffer fiom certain degrees and aspects of MBD are less likely to have success in getting along in society. Not unexpectedly, as the number of MBD people increases and the number of people unable to relate to others because of degradation of the nervous system increases, the number of unsuccessfbl social interactions leading to unacceptable social behavior will also increase. A look at the statistics proves this to be the '' Neal, J.B, Encephalitis: a Clinical Study, New York, Grune and Stratton, 1942. 544"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO SAT Scores v Crime General Trends 1950-1990 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 .4 SAT Scores + Crime"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO case. At the end of this chapter is a general chronological breakdown reflecting these trends. Some of the statistics are as follows: The murder rate doubled between 1960 and 1980, fiom four per 100,000 people (4:100,000) to 8:100,000. In 1987, there were over 20,000 murders in the United States. The largest increase was between 1960 and 1970. The murder rate in Western Europe remained at an even 1: 100,000. The general figures for crimes of all categories went from 4,000: 100,000 in 1971 to 6000: 100,000 in 1980. It has stabilized around 5,000: 100,000. Between 1970 and 1980, the number of arson incidents rose 325%. In 1933, the incidence of violent crime (murder, rape, robbery) was 200: 100,000. By the 1940's it had declined to 100: 100,000, but by 1963 it was back to the 1933 level. Since 1963, it has climbed steadily, reaching 500: 100,000 in 1978 and 650: 100,000 in 1987. You really cannot blame all of this just on the concept of poverty, since it is three times higher today than in 1933 and six times higher than in the 1940's. The crimes are also taking on an air of real brutality, even those performed by females. In 1969 only 12% of female adolescents committed violent acts. By 1979, it had risen to 48%. Child abuse started to become a public problem in during the Bush and Reagan administration in the 1980's. In 1986, there were 2.1 million reports of child abuse in the United States - a 200% rise since 1976. The prison population has doubled since 1970. In California, it tripled between 1977 and 1988, after only 10 years. Today the ratio of people in prison is 250: 100,000 (in comparison, it was 29: 100,000 in 1850. The characteristics of murder changed from being predominately one between people who knew each other before 1963, but after 1963 it began to accelerate to where people are murdered by people they don't even know, more often than by someone they do know. It was noted in 1988 that adults with a history of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are predominant in the felon popoulation in prisons.33 A large majority of the prison population involved in serious crime appear to have been categorized as hyperactive in their youth. Hyperactivity often declines in MBD affected individuals, and is replaced by aggressiveness and a hair-trigger tempe?4, with MBD individuals as adults showing destructive impulsive behavior. Other common features with violent criminals are short attention spans, dyslexia, general learning disabilities, dysgraohia, dyscalcula (inability to perform basic calculations), defective sequential memory, and reading disabilities, all of which contribute to a condition of social incompatibility. It is interesting to note that in 1970, it was found that 33% of children with conduct disorders were reading disabled. Students are graduated fiom high school with a reading level equivalent to that in second or third grade. The schools cannot cope with the increased number of MBD students, and are graduating them just to get rid of them.

In 1928, A British physician noted that changes in morals and character in patients who have had encephalitis reveal \"a curious uniformity\". All those who were neurologically damaged react their own inability to successfully interact with society with aggression, impulsive unreflective behavior and irrationality. Adolescents within the vast spectrum involving MBD are often drawn to drugs and alcohol by the need to offset hyperactivity, or by an inherent realization that they somehow do not feel normal, unable to cope with life's ordinary stresses. The pertussis vaccination program was rather sporadic in the 1920's and 1930's, becoming widespread during and after World War II. The appearance of autism and learning disabilities reflects the growth of the vaccination program. Vaccinations yielded the first autistics in the early 1940's. Learning disabilities emerged eight or ten years later, when the children of this same generation were seen to have chronic difficulties in school. The learning disabled children of the early 1950's were brothers and sisters of the autistics of the early 1940's. The generation born in 1945, and thus exposed for the first time to widespread vaccination, came of age in 1963, when they reached the age of 18. The year 1963 also marked the beginning of the general decline of intelligence in the United States - a fact revealed when the generation in 1963 took entrance examinations for college and the military. In 1963, the average SAT verbal score was 478 and the math was 502. It began to decline until by 1980 the verbals score was 424 and the math 466. The scores today are the lowest ever recorded. Tests given to military recuits in the 1970's showed their mental capacity to be signrficantiy lower than recruits between 1941 and 1945. In 1977, a panel was convened to ascertain the reasons for the IQ decline, and 79 hypotheses were advanced. None proved to explain the problem. The vaccination problem was not one of the 79 hypotheses. A national study in 1988 found that mathematical ability has virtually vanished in American adolescents. Half the applicants for college cannot read at the 10th grade level or solve eighth grade problems in mathematics. In 1965, Congress passed the Immunization Assistance Act. More and more states extended their vaccination programs and made them obligatory. By 1970, physicians encountered a whole new group of neurologically defective four and five-year-olds. A 1986 National Health Review Survey found that between 1969 and 198 1, the prevalence of \"activity-limiting chronic conditions\" in children younger that 17 had increased, for no understandable reason, almost 44%. Almost all of the increase occurred between 1969 and 1975. Most of these conditions are readily associated with post encephalitic syndrome. All of the childhood respiratory diseases increased 47%, childhood asthma 65%, mental and nervous system disorders 80%, personality and non-psychotic mental disorders went up over 300%, diseases of the eyes and ears increased 120%, with hearing loss increasing 129 percent.

If it happens, it was planned that way\" - FDR"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Psycho-Chemical Treatment of MBD Children In 1922, Samuel Tory Orton did a study which made a connection between neurological damage and subsequent behavioral problems1. This major insight, which might be quite obvious today, was suppressed right after World War II when the growing influence of the Rockefeller-based petroleum industry, which also supported Nazi Germany with hds and supplies enabling them to rise to power2, began to realize that neurologically caused behavioral patterns could be a source of income for the petroleum- based pharmaceutical industry, some of which had its roots with the I.G. Farben complex and its American subsidiary. Furthermore, psychiatry and psychotherapy, as well as general psychology, mostly fiom Germany, combined with the growing pharmaceutical industry to completely bury the growing cause of behavioral problems and replace it with psycho-pharmaceutical treatment of syrnptomology. Also imported into the United States towards the end of World War 11 was all of the technical expertise on psychotechnical manipulation acquired fiom Nazi experimentation on prisoners.3 The source of behavior and conduct disorders in the population would gradually move after World War 11 fiom simple matters of 'hltural adjustment\" to neurophysiological problems caused by growing environmental pollution fiom the chemical industry and fiom biochemical experimentation on the population4, compounded with a growing interest in electromagnetic mind control protocols. Since the protocols of experimentation and control of the neurology of the population had to be hidden, the resultant effects had to be blamed on '~sychological maladjustment\", and treatment by drugs and therapy, lest the true causes and their effect on human neurology be discovered, in which case massive litigation against and persecution of the establishment would begin, forcing termination or alteration of experimental protocols and loss of psychosocial control that would spread internationally. With the foregoing in mind, and especially in reference to treatment of those neurologically damaged by vaccine technologies, we see that childhood and adolescent post-encephalitic disorders, as exterior symptoms and behavioral manifestations, succumb to psycho-babble, and are now benignly referred to as attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar \"syndromes\", all treatable by therapy and drugs. Samuel Orton, who worked on the relationship between stuttering and dyslexia in the 1920's and 19307s, realized that \"emotional disturbances\" originate in \"neurologic reality\". It is this link between mental illness, neurology and subsquent behvioral manifestation which was broken as described. The Unseen Hand, Epperson, 1985, Publius Press, Tucson, Arizona, Chapter 24, WWII, pp264-284. Some 55,000 Nazi intelligence, national security, psychosocial and scientific personnel came to the U.S. Which produced an ever-growing number of minimally brain damaged individuals. Furthermore, in recent decades, any neurological interpretation of mental illness, combined with the cultural pawbgm of body identification (the body is the person) and its subsequent derivative that the brain is the source of consciousness relative to the individual entity, reflects a conservative political stance that promotes a basic unwillingness to assist the low-income social groups whose inferior economic status (created by the power strum by design) gives rise to \"emotional\" disabilities requiring politico-medical intervention. It doesn't occur to anyone to curtail future cases by curtailing vaccination programs."},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO The Worldwide Use of Methylphenidate (Ritalin) on MBD Children We have already reviewed the manifestation of minimally brain damaged children, the causes and symptomology. As if the predisposition of the medical and psychological community to treat external manifestations of neurological behavior disorders with drugs wasn't enough, the neurological changes caused by MBD predispose those affected to seek consolation in alcohol and drugs, which research has shown to be ultimately provided by the State. Adding to the State-provided illicit drugs are the State-provided psychotropic drugs destined for the allopathic 'treatment\" of the State-caused neurological problems, outwardly defined as ADHD and other variations reviewed in the constantly upgraded Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders @SM-111-R, recently upgraded to the DSM-IV). Among the preferred treatment drugs is Ritalin, or methylphenidate hydrochloride, which is chemically related to amphetamines, which has the paradoxical effect of mitigating hyperactivity, while covertly causing additional neurological damage insuring the necessity for a constantly varying series of treatments. Ritalin is manufactured by Ciba- Geigy, who in 1971 decided to market the drug in the United States. This decision was critisized by the Swedish Medical Association, who had banned the use of Ritalin in Sweden ten years earlier because of widespread abuse. According to Ciba-Geigy: \" The mode of action in man is not completely understood, but Ritalin 'presumably' activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce its stimulant effect. There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby Ritalin produces its mental or behavioral effects in children, not conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate top the condition of the central nervous system. That Ciba-Geigy can admit they are marketing a psychotropic drug they don't understand that produces mental and behavioral effects in children without conclusive evidence of the effect on the central nervous system is quite telling. In addition, they also admit: \"Sufficient data on safety and efficacy of long-term use of Ritalin in children are not yet available. Patients requiring long-term therapy should be carefully monitored. Ritalin should be given cautiously to emotionally unstable patients, such as those with a history of drug dependence or alcoholism. Chronic use can lead to psychic dependence with varying degrees of abnormaltty. Frank psychotic episodes can occur. There have been reports of Tourettes Syndrome and toxic psychosis. \" Notice above they are saying that 'hufficient data on safety and efficacy of long- term use of Ritalin in children are not yet available.\" Not yet available? How long does it take? Ritalin has been in use almost 30 years. Secondly, 'patients requiring long-term Physicians Desk Reference, 1991, p.865.

They have had it for 30 years and have not established safety or effectiveness for long-term use but they encourage patients to have long-term therapy? This seems to follow the pattern of all pharmaceutical drugs and manufacturers, doesn't it? Casual, criminal negligence and indifference - as long as the financial profit is there or until enough people suffer fiom the product. Let's continue with the word from Ciba : \" Ritalin is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for a stabilizing effect in children with a behavioral syndrome characterized by the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms: moderate to severe distractibilty, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Specific etiology of the syndrome is unknown. Learning may be impaired. \" ' Nothing like a 'total treatment program\" with a 30-year-old drug with unknown effects on a child's central nervous system. The indications for use of Ritalin are listed by Ciba as: Attention Deficit Disorders (previously known as Minimal Brain Dysfunction in Children). Other terms being used to describe the behavioral syndrome include Hyperkinetic Child Syndrome, Minimal Brain Damage, Minimal Cerebral Dysfunction and Minor Cerebral Dysfunction.\" It is assumed you see the connection to previous chapters by now. As previously mentioned, the up-and-coming name tag for this syndrome is Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).' Interestingly, after reviewing everything available at state libraries and computerized medical databases, there are several predictions possible on a social basis should this psychotechnical abuse continue. ADHD is moving toward being defined as a 'genetic disorder\" or a 'biochemical imbalance\" requiring treatment with psychotropic drugs. The bio-medicalization of education. If ADHD becomes legally defined in this way, it will label six to 12 million children as handicapped, as well as biochemically and genetically flawed. It will put millions of children on a highly addictive Class 11 drug that has not shown any positive long tenn beneficial educational, social or behavioral effects. Despite the effort to classifL individuals in this way, no evidence could be located anywhere that proves a biochemical or genetic cause for the disorder. We know what the true cause is. To avoid Wer confirsion, instead of ADAD or ADD, we will refer to the manifested syndrome as MBD. In 1992, MBD was recognized as the most common neurobehavioral disorder of children. Estimates with or without the element of hyperactivity range fiom 10-20% of all 7 Ibid. p.866. 8 Ibid. p.865.

Allopathic medicine, with its reptilian 'Slash and bum\" orientation towards drugs, surgery and radiation, must maintain itself in the face of a growing awareness in the population of the true nature of its approach to health. Allopathic medicine historically uses several techniques to do this. The nature of allopathic medicine is grounded in pseudo-scientific biological misinterpretations of 19th century medical practice, and by propaganda maintains the mass belief system of the population as close to the 19th century paradigm as it can. One of the components maintaining this mass belief system is fear, and one of the techniques for maintaining the fear is to come up with new medical 'problems\" for insertion into the public mind - medical application of Hegelian philosophy. Cause a problem coverty, present a solution that represents an element of gain that does not resolve the problem, and look for the next opportunity. The upper echelons of the medical community, supported by mainstream foundations, chemical and pharmaceutical companies and the medical industrial complex, know the causes for most of todays problems. Discovery of these true causes within the mass mind of the population would be hazardous to their health, so syndromes are marketed and promoted as singular 'tliseases7'in the context of the 19th century allopathic paradigm in order to conceal the causes and maintain financial gain. As was mentioned earlier, there is definitive proof that the medical comm~nity'~ knew about vaccinal encephalitis in 1926, and that that the causes of MBD are known today, but since allopathic medicine focuses on symptoms, the causes remain unaddressed. Let's look at some bullets: P Collective symptoms are marketed as singular diseases. Vaccination paradigms plus chemical irritation cooperate to cause MBD, but it is marketed as a disease requiring additional treatment using drugs and psychotherapy, fbrther damaging the patient. The general decline in the immune system of the population is because of the 'Injection\" of chemicals and biological weaponry into society, assisting the syndrome of \"AIDS\" which is marketed as a disease having a singular cause which has never actually been proven. The treatment is fbrther administration of toxic compounds, killing the patient. P The definitions of these 'tliseases\" are micromanaged and adjusted to maximize profit and financial gain. The criteria for ADHD currently involves having a certain number of symptoms fiom a list. The criteria for AIDS originally involved having a certain number of symptoms fiom a list. The criteria for GWS involves having certain symptoms fiom a list.

Appearance of Resistance and Cracks in the ADHD Syndrome Paradigm In accordance with the experiential maxim 'you can't fool all the people all the time'', many professionals are starting to question the externalized MBD paradigm of ADHD. Most notably, work has been done by the Chesapeake Institute preparing executive summaries of research done on the ADHD paradigm, and some interesting questions from health professionals are starting to emerge. Many of the questions stem fiom growing evidence that supports what we already know - that ADHD is a symptomology which reflects neurological abnormality, not a psychosocial disorder, but they are still missing out on the cause of the problem because the true facts are being suppressed by the upper echelons of the medical industrial complex. For instance, in 1991 a piece entitled 'Neurological Basis of ADHD lS was quoted as saying: \" Table 1 lists a number of neuroanatomically-based hypotheses about the brain regions that may be involved in ADHD. Generally these hypotheses implicate subcortical structures believed important in arousal and the regulation of motor control, or they propose the involvement of both subcortical and cortico-frontal systems. Laufer, Denhoff and Solomons (1957 also proposed that midbrain structures (thalamus, hypothalamus) may be involved in ADHD. However, specific structures and neurotransmitters involved are largely unknown and research into the contributions of hormones related to the hypothalamus has not been fruitful.

It is relevant to note that in none of the neuroimaging studies have the brain scans appeared to be clinically abnormal; the brains of children with ADHD look normal. As suggested by the imaging and postmortem studies of dyslexics, these differences may be related to prenatal deviations in cellular micrration and maturation. One might ask, what could create prenatal deviations in cellular migration and maturation? The response of an immature immune and nervous system to attack by injected foreign antigens and exposure to carcinogenic vaccine adjuvants? The evidence seems to indicate that this is the case, but the deviations don't have to occur prenatally, since the same effect manifests itself in infants who experience post-vaccinal MBD. The fact that the symptoms are being deliberately passed off as the cause is an essential part of the allopathic paradigm. Children with MBD manifesting external ADD grow up to be adolescents and adults. It is estimated that as many as 15,000,000 adults fall into this category, although the true figures for post-vaccinal MBD probably come closer to 80 million in the United States alone.

That consensus, presented at the World Summit for Children in New York, was that new and combined antigens and stabilisers could help guarantee more, better, and affordable vaccines for children. The Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI) was launched last year to accelerate vaccine development and make use of these technologies to produce heat-stable, non-parenteral multi-antigen vaccines that might be given just once, early in life, to protect agamt a dozen or more diseases. The substance of the initiative began to take form last month in Geneva, at meetings of its management advisory committee and standmg committee. The CVI strategy devolves from the observation that there have been too few incentives to encourage the application of science to imrnunisation programmes. The initiative's objective is to ensure that nations of the developing world have an adequate supply of affordable, safe and effective vaccines against important diseases. Thus product development is the central focus of the initiative and is supported by parallel efforts to enhance research, production and delivery systems. A task force, employing analysis of feasibility and of economic costs and benefits, will determine how to set priorities and choose investment targets for CVI. A \"situation analysis\" will be used to assess the global vaccine market and suggest how United Nations agencies and bilateral donors who support immunisation programmes in developing countries might use their purchasing power and market share to iduence vaccine developers to meet the needs of the developing world. The World Health Organisation will investigate how new multivalent vaccines can be incorporated into the immunisation schedules of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation. Other task forces will inquire into technology transfer to manufacturers in developing countries and into the inclusion of commercial vaccine producers as collaborators in CVI. Small teams will be assembled to manage the development of specific vaccine projects under CVI.

In 1791, Eberhardt Gmelin reported on the case of 'kxchange personalities7'. He treated a German woman who would suddenly 'kxchange\" her personality, language, and manners with a personality who spoke perfect French and behaved like an aristocratic lady. As the French personality, the woman retained memory for all that happened in her French state, whereas she was amnesic for this same behavior in her German personality. Gmelin was able to switch her back and forth between these two personalities with a wave of his hand.2 It was one of the first reported cases where a therapist established control over an MPD patient. Benjamin Rush, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and chief surgeon of the Continental Army, collected case histories of dissociation and MPD for his lectures and writings on physiological psychiatry. Rush penned the first attempt at a textbook on psychiatry in the United States, and theorized that the origin of MPD involved a curious split in hemispheric interaction. During the period fiom 1880 to about 1920, there was a flourishing interest in multiple personality disorders. A relatively large kmber of cases were reported, particularly in France and the United States. That MPD is considered to be a dissociative phenomena led to increased discussion about the nature of consciousness itself. It was also a period of a great many conferences and meetings, many of which devoted extensive time to sessions on dissociation. A plethora of cases stand out. Several unusual ones deserve mention. Eugene Azam (1 822-1 899) studied the case of Felida over a period of 35 years and published her case in 1887 with a preface by Charcot. Felida had two prominent personalities and a third personality which would appear from time to time. Her first personality was amnesic for the behavior of the second, whereas her second personality remembered her entire life history. The third personality, who suffered fiom attacks of anxiety and hallucination, would emerge on occasion. At one point, the first personality appeared with an unexplained pregnancy that could not be explained. The second personality emerged and took re~~onsibility.~ A strikingly similar example of an unxplained pregnancy in MPD was reported in 1984.' Reviewers of MPD all seem to comment on the waxing and waning in the numbers of case reports over the last two centuries.

A few cases continued to be reported in journals during the 1930's and 194OYs, but added little new information. In the 1970's, individuals with MPD started appearing out of the woodwork and case reports of MPD became increasingly commonplace. The publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980 by the American Psychiatric Association, which created many new categories of mental disorders, admittedly for insurance billing purposes, conferred a certain legitamacy upon MPD that no othre form of \"proof of existence\" could. The period from 1980 to 1995 saw a rapid growth in the number of cases reported, not necessarily because MPD was quantifiable in terms of the DSM-I11 or DSM-111-R (revised), but because there genuinely were more people appearing with bona fide MPD disorders. The reason for the increased numbers oif MPD cases was unknown. Some clinical features of MPD have changed over time. The most striking of these is the difference in the numbers of alternate personalities reported for earlier cases and the numbers found in modem patients. Many of the very earliest cases are dud personalities, a condition that is very rarely encountered in modem patients. When more than one 'hlter\" was present, usually no more than four distinct personalities were identified. An interesting trend toward increasing numbers of identified alters. In 1978, the mean number of alternate personalities was 9.7.' By 1984, the average number of alternates was 15~. Many therapists now report patients having 50 or more alternate personalities. A second feature of MPD that has appeared to evolve over time is the slowly emerging association of the disorder with traumatic childhood experiences. The existence of a traumatic experience producing alternate personalities was described by Janet and Morton Prince in 1906' and Walter Prince in 191 7' , who cited specific physical abuse episodes for his patient Doris. Goddard in 1926 was the first to report sexual abuse as a possible precipitant.9 Morselli in 1930 was the first to report a history of incest connected with an MPD patient.10 Until the late 1970's, however, the majority of case reports did not include a history of clearly identified childhood trauma as part of the case history, though many of the early cases did identifl childhood environments characterized by extremely authoritarian, religious, or perfectionistic standards. l1 Although the incidence of Allison, Ralph, ''Psychotherapy of multiple personality\" Annual Meeting of the APA, May 1978.

Government or military personnel, began to accelerate after about 1980. The Pardigm of CIA Use of MPD Personalities The core feature of MPD is the existence of alter personalities who exchange control over an individual's behavior. The 'Uters\" appear to be discrete states of consciousness organized around a \"prevailing affect': a sense of self (including body image), with a limited repertoire of behaviors and a set of state-dependent memories. The interesting attributes of MPD memory structures were noticed early on by U.S. Intelligence personnel, particularly the CIA, who envisioned MPD \"sleepers\" as a form of 'Manchurian candidate\" able to penetrate strange and unusual environments where the primary personality would be so altered that reactive memory would be oblivious to the strangeness, yet alternative personalities, apparently impervious to technical memory erasure techniques, could preserved intelligence data in nested psychic gestalts accessible by similarly nested code words and phases when the \"sleeper\" could be recovered. The CL4 has openly admitted MPD experimentation, but insists that it terminated such programs in 1960. The production of MPD personalities, as far as research has determined, involved ritual sexual abuse of children, use of mind-altering drugs and various forms of negative aversion conditioning centered around cult activity involving \"satanic\" ritual and belief systems. But, where is the overt proof that this actually happened, other than in the results gradually emerging fiom various psychotherapy sessions? We'll get into that later, but first let's discuss the various attributes assignable to MPS alter personalities. The Alter Personalities In 1984, various APA workshop work with the emerging MPD problem arrived at a cohesive definition for an \"alter\" personality as 'hn entity with a firm, persistent, and well-founded sense of self and a characteristic and consistent pattern of behavior and feelings in response to a given stimuli. It has a range of fbnctions, a range of emotional responses, and a sigdicant memory of its own existence.\"13 Most MPD patients have some alter personalities who meet this definition, as well as a number of what are apparently personality \"fiagments\" who are similar to I11-fledged personalities except that they lack the depth and breadth of a fbll personality, and have a limited range of Sects, behaviors and life history. l4 l2 Browne, A., et al., \"Impact of child sexual abuse: a review of the research\" Psychological Bulletin, V0199, 1986, pp.66-77. l3 Kluft, RP., \"An introduction to MPD\" Psychiatric Annals, Vol14,1984, pp.19-24. l4 Ibid. 56 1"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO At least 50% or more of MPD patients have 'hlters\" who see themselves in diametric conflict with the \"host\" or 'fprimary\" personality. This group of personalities, sometimes referred to as \"internal prosecutors\" will 'Sabotage the patient's life and may inflict serious injury to the body in attempts to kill or harm the \"host\" or other personalities. There also may be \"suicidal personalities\" who are driven to kill themselves, and these often have the single-minded dedication to their task of suicide and have no awareness of the host or other personalities. At least, the psychological data on this alter interestingly matches reports of alters of identical function used in intelligence operations. It is this alter that is often called on, by virtue of programmed code-words, to eliminate the individual once an intelligence operation is complete and the \"sleeper\" loses its usefulness. Most MPD patients have an array of \"protector\" and 'helper\" personalities. who serve as a functional counterbalance to the 'persecutors\" and \"suicidals\". In female MPD cases, the \"protector\" personalities are often male alters who will emerge if they believe the body is in danger or threatened by circumstances similar to previous trauma. In therapy settings, it is necessary to contact this alter and assure it that no harm is intended to the patient. The \"protector\" personalities also apparently serve as part of an internal system of \"checks and balances\" to counteract some of the self-destructive alters. A special subset of the 'fprotector personality'' is the \"internal self-helper,\" first identified in 1974. These alters are typically passive, emotionless and provide information and insights into the inner workings of the system. It is fiom these internal self-helpers that the insight into CIAINSA use of individuals for covert operations, and some of the code phrases and words, first emerged. The \"memorv trace\" personality is an alter who has a more or less complete memory of the individual's life history. It is a source of historical information on past events and the activities of the other personalities. At least half of all MPD patients appear to have \"cross-gender\" alters, meaning child, adolescent or adult alters of the opposite sex from the host. Unfortunately for the patient, some of these 'kross gender\" personality may overtly cross dress. They may be responsible for the 'bni-sex\" appearance of many MPD patients. Female MPD patients frequently have short har and wear clothing that allows their male alters, who tend to serve in masculine roles, to emerge comfortably. In male MPD patients, the female personalities are often older, 'kood mother\" figures who attempt to provide counsel. In male MPD cases, female alters appear in about 75% of cases. In most MPD cases, there are personalities that express \"forbidden impulses': often markedly sexual in nature. These promiscuous alters may !ead turbulent sexual lives, leaving the bewildered \"host\" wondering how the situation arose. This is especially interesting when the promiscuous alter picks up a male partner and then another alter appears, leaving the host personality, usually fiigid, to contend with the advances of the \"stranger\". The host personality often interprets the outcome of this internal setup as \"rape.\" 562"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO Other alters involved in the MPD scenario are described as \"administrators\" (fbnctionally organizing otherwise fiagmented alters, ofien described as cold, distant and authoritarian), \"autistic\" (alters generally infant or child), \"special ability7' (alters with special skills, often alter-fragments organized by the 'hdministrators'), \"anesthetic or analgesic\" (alters which trace their orgin to painfbl physical or sexual abuse, who deny feeling pain and are activated when the body is inured by self or others), \"imitators or imposters\" (alters that mimic other alters, handling situations the mimicked alter cannot - they drive the therapist crazy), demons and spirits\" (alters arising in those having hosts with original fundamentalist religious belief systems, usually malevolent alters), and the \"ori~inal personality\" (alter identified by the other alters as the 'original' from whom all alters are derived). Research seems to indicate that the 'briginal\" is the identity which developed just after birth and split off the first new personality in order to help the body survive a severe stress. The 'briginal\" is typically not active and is often described by other alters as having been \"put to sleep\" or otherwise incapacitated at some much earlier point. The host personality is not the \"original\" personality in most patients. All of this is a situation in which Abbott and Costello would ask, \"who's on first?\" Nevertheless, clinical description of the alters seems to match reports in the field related to neurolinguistic codification of alters created through intelligence programs fiom about 1950 through at least 1970. Degrees of Interawareness among Alter Personalities The alters possess varying degrees of awareness of each other. The host personality generally does not know about the existence of the alters, although 'internal self-helpers\" and 'hemory trace\" alters will claim knowledge of the entire system of alternate personalities. Alters may know a subset of other alters, but not all of them. This property has been clinically termed \"directional -awareness\". Surveys by the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) found that 75% of MPD patients had at least one alter who denied all knowledge of the other alters, and that 85% had an alter who claimed to know all of the others.'' Information Permeability Between Dissociative Bamers The dissociative barriers that separate the alters are more permeable for some types of information than for other types. The more traumatically or emotionally charged an idea or affect is, the more it will tend to be isolated within an alter and segregated &om the larger domain of consciousness. Uniqueness of alters and the barriers between them tend to disappear for emotionally neutral or non-affect laden material. This tendency tends to compartmentalize emotionally charged information - a fact taken advantage of in terms of intelligence programming of MPD persons for operational intrusion into unusual scenarios. The compartmentalization is apparently accessed through nested codification \" Pumam, F.W., \"The scientific investigation of multiple personality disorder\" .

Attitudes of Alters Toward the Physical Body Many of the alters seem to have a rather cavelier attitude toward the safety and well-being of the physical body that they share. Alters who recognize that they share the body with other alters often do not seem interested in the health of that body, and provide explanations to justify that seeming indifference. Some of the explanations are quite intriguing - \"the original abuser mistreated the body, so the alter feels the same': 'the alter exists outside the body and views it as a place to come for interaction with the physical world': and 'It is not their body, and they would change it (sex) if they could.\" An interesting variant is that many of the alters see the body as being different after they \"inhabitnit. Some see the hair as a different color, some see the body as thin when it is fat, etc. A really interesting variant in MPD lore, which has occurred often enough to establish it as a viable variant, is that when one alter is in charge, the body will be diabetic. When another alter takes over, there is no trace of diabetes present. Other variations of this mirror the ability of consciousness to alter the physical characteristics of the body. This is something that drives mechanistic psychiatrists crazy themselves, and they often go into denial about the whole thing. Of course, we know better. Alter Switches and Switching Processes Switching is the process of changing fiom one alter to another, and is obviously a core process in MPD. Therapeutic efforts must incorporate knowledge of switching and the recognition of switches. Otherwise, changes in behavior are misunderstood, and any leverage gained through recognition and confrontation of alters fades away. A switch may be stimulated by a process buried within the internal dynamics of the MPD system, or elicited by events in the immediate environment, including words, phrases or events that mimick a core event that may have given rise to an alter in the first place. As an MPD patient undergoes treatment, control of switches by the patient often manifests itself. Since many alters are unaware of other alters and view \"life\" as a series of 'hppearances\" and 'tlisappearances\" in which they often 'bake up\" or '$0 to sleep\", there is a certain adaptive logic to the switching process, so that an alter appropriate to the external circumstance is called out in most cases. The multiplicity of alters is often masked by the ease at which the MPD patient switches alters in ways that appear appropriate to changing external situations. Hence, the very existence of alters may only be apparent to those who observe the individual across a wide variety of different settings. In times of stress, however, alters may emerge who are inappropriate to the situation, resulting in serious problems. Switches can be overt or covert, the latter often being diflicult to detect, and it is often only after one has observed a number of overt switches that covert switching is likely to be recognized.

The degree of differentiation between the alters (how different the alters are) obviously affects the perception that a switch has occurred. Are one of you following this? A second factor that appears to influence the perception of a difference by an observer is familiarity and past experience with alters. Very often, a radical change in facial expression can betray that fact that a switch has occurred. Sometimes, it can be as subtle as a distinctive change in the eyes - often not a quantifiable change. Postural and motor behavioral changes occur with transition of alters. Changes in voice and speech, as well as dress and grooming, may indicate a switch. Switching itself can take a fraction of a second or can last minutes - sometimes longer. Transient facial twitching often accompanies a switch. Some switches have been mistaken as epileptic seizures. Alter Names Alters may be named by the external or internal function they perform (e.g., 'the driver,\" 'the maid,\" 'the gatekeeper') for a alter who performs the internal fbnction of controlling which alters can emerge at a given time. They may be named for the affect that they manifest (e.g., 'the angry one,\" 'the sad one\" ), or an actual external person in an authoritative position one of the alters identifies with (e.g., \"Dr. Green\"). Most of the attributes of an alter collapse into a single morpheme, or name. Sometimes they will have a first, last and middle name, or they might be a derivative of the legal name. Many MPD Jystems, in turn, can have 'hmamed alters that go by the \" name\" of 'ho one,\" 'hobody,\" or 'ho name.\" In many cases, what appear as unnamed alters will turn out to have names after all. Many alters are unwilling to reveal their names because the knowledge of the name will allow an external person to call them out. Alter Numbers Research seems to indicate that the absolute range of the number of alters range from two, in the case of dual personalities (now rare), to reports of hundreds of alter personalities - not only a therapeutic nightmare, but a real adventure for the individual involved. The fact that some people who manifest MPD are involved in abduction scenarios complicates the issue ever further. An NJMH study found a significant correlation between the number of different wes of childhood trauma reported and the number of alters,16 suggesting that the more traumatized a person was, the more alters the mem will contain. The lower the age at which the trauma occurs the more alters are likely to appear. This tends to be supported by clinical findings we have examined. The number of alters in the system is directly proportional to the probability of sociopathic behavior, externally directed violence, and suicide attempts. l6 Putnam et al, 1986."},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Layering of Alters One phenomena noticed by therpists (and one implied or directly stated in descriptions of CIA methodology) is the nesting or layering of alters. Some alters overlie each other or are buried beneath other alters. An overtly recognizable alter can mask several covertly active alters not externally manifest - these covertly active alters are often tied to a specific trauma or life issue. Lack of recognition of nesting can cause previously fised alters to re-dissociate. It is an important discovery made in 1984. Often integration of alters itself will open up certain 'hiches\" in the system, holes as it were, which can be filled by alters previously dormant or inactive. It is common psychiatric interpretation that layering is part of the defensive process of dissociation that binds pain and horror by fragmentation and storage in such a way that it is difficult to reassemble, however, research indicates that the layering or nesting process is one that is so well understood by intelligence agencies that it can be crafted in any way necessary to set up a specific system to store information, parallel to an equally nested series of coded initiators for various alters. Groups of related alters often exist, often tied by the same trauma and therefore sharing the same origin. Complex MPD patients with large numbers of alters may carry several diierent \"family groupings,\" and often the various groups may be in conflict with each other. Dating someone who turns out to have MPD must be the literal 'blind date from hell.\" Key or Cue Words Interestingly, reports of CIAINSA keyword systems relative to MPD individuals have a certain viability. The existance of the use of key words to elicit specific alters was first noted in 196417, only four years after the CIA elaimed they terminated the program in 1960. The use of \"cue words\" is an important technique for facilitating the hypnotic process. Since hypnosis, drugs and trauma are essential for deliberately creating MPD individuals in line with mission objectives, it is not surprising that the existence of cue words became evident early on. \" Morton and Thorna, \"A case of multiple personality\", American Journal ofClinica1 Hypnosis, Vol 6, 1964, pp.216-225."},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO THE GREENBAUM SPEECH ON RlTUAL ABUSE, MPD AND MIND CONTROL Herein is the lecture by D.C.Hammond, originally entitled \"Hypnosis in MPD: Ritual Abuse,\" but now usually known as the \"Greenbaum Speech,\" delivered at the Fourth Annual Eastern Regional Conference on Abuse and Multiple Personality, Thursday June 25, 1992, at the Radisson Plaza Hotel, Mark Center, Alexandria, Virginia.

First, let me ask how many of you have had at least one course or workshop on hypnosis? Can I see the hands? WonderfUl. That makes our job easier. Okay. I want to start off by talking a little about trance-training and .the use of hvpnotic phenomena with an MPD dissociative-disorder po~ulation, to talk some about unconscious exploration, methods of doing that, the use of imagerv and svmbolic imageq techniques for managing uhvsical symptoms. input overload, things like that. Before the day's out, I want to spend some time talking about something I think has been completely neglected in the field of dissociative disorder, and that's talking about methods of profound calming for automatic hyper-arousal that's been conditioned in these patients. We're going to spend a considerable length of time talking about ~e-rewession and abreaction in working through a trauma. I'll show you with a non-MPD patient -- some of that kind of work -- and then extrapolate fiom what I find so similar and different with MPD cases. Part of that, I would add, by the way, is that I've been very sensitive through the years about taping MPD cases or ritual-abuse cases, part of it being that some of that feels a little like using patients and I think that this population has been used enough. That's part of the reason, by choice, that I don't generally videotape my work. I also want to talk a bunch about hvpnotic relapse- prevention strategies and =-integration thera~y today. Finally, I hope to find somewhere in our time-fiame to spend on hour or so talking specifically about ritual abuse and about mind-control prowamming and brainwashing - how it's done, how to get on the inside with that - which is a topic that in the past I haven't been willing to speak about publicly, have done that in small groups and in consultations, but recently decided that it was high time that somebody started doing it. So we're going to talk about specifics today. [Applause] In Chicago at the first International Congress where ritual abuse was talked about I can remember thinking, \"How strange and interesting.\" I can recall many people listening to an example given that somebody thought was so idiosyncratic and rare, and all the people coming up after saying, \"Gee, you're treating one, too? You're in Seattle\" ... Well, I'm in Toronto.. .Well, I'm in Florida.. .Well, I'm in Cincinnati.\" I didn't know what to think at that point. It wasn't too long after that I found my first ritual-abuse patient in somebody I was already treating and we hadn't gotten that deep yet. Things in that case made me very curious about the use of mind-control techniques and hypnosis and other brainwashing techniques. So I started studying brainwashing and some of the literature in that area and became acquainted with, in fact, one of the people who'd written one of the better books in that area. Then I decided to do a survey, and"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO fiom the ISSMP&D [International Society for the Study of Mulptiple Personality and Dissociation] folks I picked out about a dozen and a half therapists that I though were seeing more of that than probably anyone else around and I started surveying them. The interview protocol, that I had. got the same reaction almost without exception. Those therapists said, \"You're asking questions I don't know the answers to. You're asking more specific questions than I've ever asked my patients.\" Many of those same therapists said, \"Let me ask those questions and I'll get back to you with the answer.\" Many of them not only got back with answers, but said, \"You've got to talk to this patient or these two patients.\" I ended up doing hundred of dollars worth of telephone interviewing. What I came out of that was a grasp of a variety of brainwashing methods being used all over the country. I started to hear some similarities. Whereas I hadn't known, to begin with, how widespread things were, I was now getting a feeling that there were a lot of people reporting some similar things and that there must be some degree of communication here. Then approximately two and a half years ago I had some material drop in my lap. My source was saying a lot of things that I knew were accurate about some of the brainwashing, but it was telling me new material I had no idea about. At this point I took and decided to check it out in three ritual-abuse patients I was seeing at the time. Two of the three had what they were describing, in carefbl inquiry without leading or contaminating. The fascinating thing was that as I did a telephone- consult with a therapist that I'd been consulting for quite a number of months on an MPD case in another state, I told her to inquire about certain things. She said, \"Well, what are those things?\" I said, \"I'm not going to tell you, because I don't want there to be any possibility of contamination. Just come back to me and tell me what the patient says.\" She called me back two hours later, said, \"I just had a double session with this patient and there was a part of him that said, 'Oh, we're so excited. If you know about this stuff, you know how the Cult Programmers get on the inside and our therapy is going to go so much faster. \"' Many other patients since have had a reaction of wanting to pee their pants out of anxiety and fear rather than thinking it was wondefil thing. But the interesting thing was that she then asked, \"What are these things?\" They were word perfect -- same answers my source had given me. I've since repeated that in many parts of the country. I've consulted in eleven states and one foreign country, in some cases over the telephone, in some cases in person, in some cases giving the therapist information ahead of time and saying, \"Be very carefbl how you phrase this. Phrase it in these ways so you don't contaminate.\" In other cases not even giving the therapist information ahead of time so they couldn't. When you start to _Fnd the same highly esoteric information in dtfJerent states and dzflerent countries, porn Florih to Califmia, you start to pet an idea that there's something go in^ on that is verv lam vent well coordinated, with a weat deal of communication and svtematicness to what's happening. So I have gone fiom someone kind of neutral and not knowing what to think about it all to someone who clearly believes ritual abuse is"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO real and that the people who say it isn't are either naive like people who didn't want to believe the Holocaust or -- they're dirty. [Applause] Now for a long time I would tell a select group of therapists that I knew and trusted, information and say, \"Spread it out. Don't spread my name. Don't say where it came fiom. But here's some information. Share it with other therapists if you find it's on target, and I'd appreciate your feedback.\" People would question -- in talks -- and say, you know, they were hungry for information Myseg as well as a few others that I've shared it with, were hedging out of concern and out of personal threats and out of death threats. I finally decided to hell with them. If they're going to kill me, they're going to kill me. It's time to share more information with therapists. Part of that comes because we proceeded so cautiously and slowly, checking things in many dflerent locations andfind the same thing. So I'm going to give you the way in with ritual-abuse prograrnminq. I certainly can't tell you everything that you want to know in forty-five or fifty minutes, but I'm going to give you the essentials to get inside and start working at a new level. I don't know what proportion, honestly, of patients have this. I would guess that maybe somewhere around at least$& percent, maybe as high as three-quarters, I would guess maybe two-thirds of your ritual-abuse patients may have this. What do I think the distinguishing characteristic is? If they were raised from birth in a mainstream cult or if they were an non-bloodline person, meaning neither parent was in the Cult, but Cult people had a lot of access to them in early childhood, they may also have it. I have seen more than one ritual-abuse patient who clearly had all the kind of ritual things you hear about. They seemed very genuine. They talked about all the typical things that you hear in this population, but had none of this programming with prolonged extensive checking. So I believe in one case I was personally treating that she was a kind of schizmatic break-off that had kind of gone off and done their own thing and were no longer hooked into a mainstream group. [Pause] Here's where it amears to have come from. At the end of World War 11, before it even ended, Men Dulles and people fiom our Intelligence Community were already in Switzerland making contact to get out Nazi scientists. As World War II ends, thev not onlv pet out rocket scientists. but thev also pet out some Nazi doctors who have been doing - mind-control research in the camps. They brought them to the United States. Along with them was a young boy, a teenager, who had been raised in a Hasidic Jewish tradition and a background of Cabalistic mysticism that probably appealed to people in the Cult because at least by the turn of the century Aleister Crowley had been introducing Cabalism into Satanic stuff, if not earlier. I suspect it may have formed some bond between them. But he saved his skin by collaborating and being an assistant to them in the death-camp experiments. They brought him with them. That started doin2 mind-control research for Militant Intellipence in militant hospitals in the United States. The people that came, the Nazi doctors, were Satanists. Subsequently, the boy changed his name, Americanized it some, obtained an M.D. degree, became a physician and continued this work that appears to be at the center"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO of Cult Programming today. His name is known to patients throughout the country. [Pausel What they basically do is they will get a child and they will start this, in basic forms, it appears, by about two and a hay after the child's already been made dissociative. They'll make him dissociative not only through abuse, like sexual abuse, but also things like putting a mousetrap on their fingers and teaching the parents, \"You do not go in until the child stops crying. Only then do you go in and remove it.\" They start in rudimentary forms at about two and a half and kick into high gear, it appears, around six or six and a ha& continue through adolescence with periodic reinforcements in adulthood. Basically in the programming the child will be put typically on a gurney. They will have an IV in one hand or arm. They'll be strapped down, typically naked. There'll be wires attached to their head to monitor electroencephalograph patterns. They will see a pulsing light, most often described as red, occasionally white or blue. They'll be given, most commonly I believe, Demerol. Sometimes it'll be other drugs as well depending on the kind of programming. They have it, I think, down to a science where they've learned you give so much every twenty-five minutes until the programming is done. They then will describe a pain on one ear, their right ear generally, where it appears a needle has been placed, and they will hear weird, disorientinp sounds in that ear while they see photic stimulation to drive the brain into a brainwave pattern with apulsing light at a certain frequency not unlike the goggles that are now available through Sharper Image and some of those kinds of stores. Then, after a suitable period when they're in a certain brainwave state, they will begin programming uroptammin~ oriented to self-destruction and debasement of the person. I am seeing a patient at this point in time about eight years old who has gone through a great deal earlv proarammin~ which took lace on a militan, installation. That's not uncommon. I've treated and been involved with cases who are part of this original mind-control project as well as having their programming on military reservations in many cases. We find a lot of connections with the CIA. This patient now was in a Cult school, a private Cult school where several of these sessions occurred a week. She would go into a room, get all hooked up. They would do all of these sorts of things. When she was in the proper altered state, now they were no longer having to monitor it with electroencephalographs, she also had already had placed on her electrodes, one in the vagina, for example, four on the head. Sometimes they'll be on other parts of the body. They will then begin and they would say to her, \"You are angry with someone in the group.\" She'd say, \"No, I'm not\" and they'd violently shock her. They would say the same thing until she complied and didn't make any negative response. Then they would continue. \"And because you are angry with someone in the group,\" or \"When you are angry with someone in the group, you will hurt yourself. Do you understand?\" She said, \"No\" and they shocked her. They repeated again, \"Do you understand?\" \"Well, yes, but I don't want to.\" Shock her again until1 they get compliance. Then they keep adding to it. \"And you will hurt yourself by cutting yourself. Do you understand?\" Maybe she'd say yes, but they might say, \"We don't believe you\" and shock her anyway. \"Go back and go over"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO it again.\" They would continue in this sort of fashion. She said typically it seemed as though they'd go about thirty minutes, take a break for a smoke or something, come back. They may review what they'd done and stopped or they might review what they'd done and go on to new material. She said the sessions might go half an hour, they might go three hours. She estimated three times a week. Programming is under the influence of drugs in a certain brainwave state with these noises in one ear and them speaking in the other ear, usually the left ear, associated with right hemisphere non-dominant brain functioning, and with them talking, therefore, and requiring intense concentration, intense focusing. Because often they'll have to memorize and say certain things back, word- perfect, to avoid punishment, shock, and other kinds of things that are occurring. This is basically how a lot of programming goes on. Some of it'll also use other typical brainwashing kinds of techniques. There will be very standardized types of hypnotic things done at times. There'll be sensory deprivation which we know increases suggestibility in anyone. Total sensory deprivation, suggestibility has significantly increased, from the research. It's not uncommon for them to use a great deal of that, including formal sensory-deprivation chambers before they do certain of these things. [Pause] Now let me give you, because we don't have a lot of time, as much practical information as I can. The way that I would inquire as to whether or not some of this might be there would be with ideomotor finger-signals. After you've set them up I would say, \"I want the central inner core of you to take control of the finger-signals.\" Don't ask the unconscious mind. The case where you're inquiring about ritual abuse, that's for the central inner core. The core is a Cult-created part. \"And I want that central inner core of you to take control of this hand of these finger-signals and what it has for the yes-finger to float up. I want to ask the inner core of you is there any part of you, any part of Mary,\" that's the host's name, \"who knows anything about Alpha, Beta, Delta, or Theta.\" If you get a Yes, it should raise a red flag that you might have someone with formal intensive brainwashing and programming in place. I would then ask and say, \"I want a part inside who knows something about Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Theta to come up to a level where you can speak to me and when you're here say, 'I'm here.\"' I would not ask if a part was willing to. No one's going to particularly want to talk about this. I would just say, \"I want some part who can tell me about this to come out.\" Without leading them ask them what these things are. I've had consults where I've come in. Sometimes I've gotten a Yes to that, but as I've done exploration it appeared to be some kind of compliance response or somebody wanting, in two or three cases, to appear maybe that they were ritual abuse and maybe they were in some way, but with carefbl inquiry and looking it was obvious that they did not have what we were looking for. Let me tell you what these are. Let's suppose that this whole fiont row here are multiples and that she has an alter named Helen and she has one named Mary, she has one named Gertrude, she has one named Elizabeth, and she has one named Monica. Every one of those alters may have put"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO on it a program, perhaps designated alpha-zero-zero-nine a Cult person could say, \"Alpha- zero-zero-nine\" or make some kind of hand gesture to indicate this and get the same part out in any one of them even though they had different names that they may be known by to you. Alphas appear to represent general programming, the first kind of things put in. Betas appear to be sexual programs. For example, how to perform oral sex in a certain way, how to perform sex in rituals, having to do with producing child pornography, directing child pornography, prostitution. Deltas are killers trained in how to kill in ceremonies. There'll also be some self-harm stuff mixed in with that, assassination and killing. Thetas are called psychic killers. You know, I had never in my life heard those two terms paired together. I'd never heard the words \"psychic killers\" put together, but when you have people in different states, including therapists inquiring and asking, \"What is Theta,\" and patients say to them, \"Psychic killers,\" it tends to make one a believer that certain things are very systematic and very widespread. This comes fiom their belief in psychic sorts of abilities and powers, including their ability to psychically communicate with \"mother\" including their ability to psychically cause somebody to develop a brain aneurysm and die. It also is a more future-oriented kind of programming. Then there's Omega. I usually don't include that word when I say my first question about this or any part inside that knows about Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta because Omega will shake them even more. Omega has to do with self-destruct programming. Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. This can include self-mutilation as well as killing- themselves programming. Gamma appears to be system-protection and deception programming which will provide misinformation to you, try to misdirect you, tell you half- truths, protect different things inside. There can also be other Greek letters. I'd recommend that you go and get your entire Greek alphabet and if you have verified that some of this stuff is present and they have given you some of the right answers about what some of this material is, and I can't underline enough: DO NOT LEAD THEM. Do not say, \"Is this killers?\" Get the answer fiom them, please. When youtve done this and it appears to be present, I would take your entire Greek alphabet and, with ideomotor signals, go through the alphabet and say, \"Is there any programming inside associated with epsilon, omicron,\" and go on through. There may be some sytematicness to some of the other letter, but I'm not aware of it. I've found, for example, in one case that Zeta had to do with the production of snuff films that this person was involved with. With another person, Omicron had to do with their linkage and associations with drug smuggling and with the Mafia and with big business and government leaders. So there's going to be some individualism, I think, in some of those. Some of those are come- home programs, \"come back to the Cult\", \"return to the Cult\" program. Here's the flaw in the system. They have built in shut-down and erasure codes so if thev pot into trouble thy could shut something down and thev could also erase somethinq. These codes will sometimes be idiosyncratic phrases, or ditties. Sometimes they will be numbers maybe followed by a word. There's some real individuality to that. At first I had hoped if we can get some of these maybe they'll work with different people. No such luck. It's very unlikely unless they were programmed at about the same point in time"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO as part of the same little group. Stuff that I've seen suggests that they carry laptop computers, the programmers, which still include everything that they did twenty, thirty years ago in them in terms of the names of alters, the programs, the codes, and so on. Now what you can do is get erasure codes, and I always ask, \"If I say this.code, what will happen? Doublecheck. \"Is there any part inside who has different information?\" Watch your ideomotor signals and what I've found is you can erase programs by giving the appropriate codes, but then you must abreact the feelings. So if you erase Omega, which is often where I've started because it's the most high risk. Afterwards I will get all the Omega, what were formerly Omega alters, together so that we will abreact and give back to the host the memories associated with all the programming that was done with Omega and anything any Omega part ever had to do in a fractionated abreaction. They use the metaphor -- and it is thsir metaphor -- of robots. and it is like a robot shell comes down over the child alter to make them act in robotic fashion. Once in a while internally you'll confiont robots. What I found from earlier work, and so I speed the process up now because I confirmed it enough times, is that you can say to the core, \"Core, I want you to look -- there's this robot blocking the way in some way, blocking the progress. Go around and look at the back of the head and tell me what you notice on the back of the head or the neck.\" I just ask it very non-leading like that and what's commonly said to me is that there were wires or a switch. So I'll tell them, \"Hold the wires or flip the switch and it will immobilize the robot and give me a yes-signal when you've done it.\" Pretty soon you get a yes-signal. \"Great. Now that the robot is immobilized, I want you to look inside the robot and tell me what you see.\" It's general& one or several children. I have them remove the children. I do a little hypnotic magic and ask the core to use a laser and vaporize the robot so nothing is left. They're usually quite amazed that this works, as have been a number of therapists. [Pause] Now there are may dfflerent lavers of this stuff, and this is the problem. Let me come over to the overhead and give some ideas about them. What we have up here are innumerable alters. I'll tell you one of the fascinating things I've seen. I remember a little over a year ago coming in to see some cases, some of the tough cases at a dissociative- disorders unit of a couple of the finest of the MPD therapists in this country, who are always part of all the international meetings, have lectured internationally. We worked and I look at some of their patients. They were amazed at certain things because they had not been aware of this before. As we worked with some of the patients and confirmed it, I remember one woman who'd been inpatient for three years, still was inpatient. Another who had one intensive year of inpatient work with all the finest MPD therapy you can imagine -- abreactions, integrations, facilitating cooperation, art therapy, on and on and on, journaling, intensively for one inpatient year followed by an intensive year of outpatient therapy two, three hours a week. In both patients we found out that all ofthis great work had done nothing but deal with the alters up here and had not touched the mind-controlprogramming. In fact it was not only intact, but we found that the one who was outpatient was having her therapy monitored every session by her mother, out+"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO state, over the telephone, and that she still had intact suggestions that had been give to her at a certain Suture time to kxll her therapist. Now one of the things that I would very carefblly check is, I would suggest that you ask the core, not just the unconscious mind, ask the core, \"Is there any part inside that continues to have contact with people associated with the Cult? Is there any part inside who goes to Cult rituals or meetings? Is there a recording device inside of Mary,\" if that's the host's name, \"a recording device inside so that someone can find out the things that are said in sessions?\" This doesn't mean they're monitored. Many of them just simply have it. \"Is there someone who debriefs some part inside for what happens in our therapy sessions?\" I have the very uncomfortable feeling fiom some past experience that when you look at this you will find the larpe uro~ortion of rituaEabuse victims in this countrv are havin~ their on~oinp thera~v monitored. I remember a woman who came in about twenty-four years old, claimed her father was a Satanist. Her parents divorced when she was six. After that it would only when her father had visitation and he would take her to rituals sometimes up until age fifteen. She said, \"I haven't gone to anything since I was fifteen.\" Her therapist believed this at face value. We sat in my office. We did a two-hour inquiry using hypnosis. We found the programming present. In addition to that, we found that every therapy session was debriefed and in fact they had told her to get sick and not come to the appointment with me. Another one had been told that I was Cult and that if she came I would know that she'd been told not to come and I would punish her. If anything meaningful comes out in a patient who's being monitored like that -- fiom what I've learned thus far, they're tortured with electric shocks -- my belief is if they're in that situation you can't do meaningfir1 therapy other than being supportive and caring and letting them how you care a lot and you'll be there to support them. But I wouldk't try to work with any kind of deep material or deprogramming with them because I think it can do nothing but get them tortured and hurt unless they can get into a safe, secure inpatient unit for an extended period of time to do some of the work required. I have a feeling that when you make inquiries you're going to find that probablv greater than fifi percent of these vatSents, if thev're bloodline. mean in^ mother or dad or both involved, will be monitored on so me onpoinp basis. pause] Now when you come below the alters, you then have Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta, so and so forth, the Greek-letter ~ronamming and they will then have backu~ Dromams. There will typically be an erasure code for the backu~s. There may be one code that combines all the backups into one and then an erasure code for them, simply one code that erases all the backups. So I will get the code for, let's say, Omega and for all the Omega backups at the same time. After I've asked \"What will happen if I give this,\" I will give the code and then I will say, \"What are you experiencing?\" They often describe computer whirring, things erasing, explosions inside, all sorts of interesting things. I've had some therapists come back and say, \"My Lord, I had never said anything about robots she said something about robots vaporizing.\" I remember one therapist who'd been with me in several hypnosis workshops and consulted with me about a crisis MPD situation. I told her to inquire about Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta. She did. She got back to me saying,"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO \"Yeah, I got an indication it's there. What is it?\" I said, \"I'm not going to tell you. Go back and inquire about some of this.\" We set an appointment for a week or so hence. She got back with me and said, \"I asked what Theta was and she said, 'psychic killers.' I asked her what Delta was and she said 'killers.\"' Okay. So I told her about some of this stuff for a two-hour consult. She called back and she said, \"This seemed too fantastic. I heard this and I thought, 'Has Cory been working too hard?\"' she said, I'm embarrassed to admit it, but she said, \"I held you in high professional regard, but this just sounded so off in the twilight zone that I really thought, 'Is he having a nervous breakdown or something?\"' She said, \"But I respected you enough to ask about this.\" She said, \"I asked another MPD patient and she didn't have any of this.\" So in this patient she started describing things and how she worked, for example, with an erasure and she was describing things like robots vaporizing and kinds of things. She said, \"I hadn't told her about any of these things.\" Well, here's the problem. There are different lqers and I think some of them are desirmed to kee~ us aoina - in circles-forever. They Fgured we probably, in most cases, wouldk't get below the alters which they purposefilly created. The way you create Manchurian Candidates is you divide the mind. It's part of what the Intelligence Community wanted to look at. If you're going to get an assassin, you're going to get somebody to go do something, you divide the mind. It fascinates me about cases like the assassination of Robert Kennedy, where Bernard Diamond, on examining Sirhan Sirhan found that he had total amnesia of the killing of Robert Kennedy, but under hypnosis could remember it. But despite suggestions he would be able to consciously remember, could not remember a thing after was out of hypnosis. I'd love to examine Sirhan Sirhan. It appears that below this we've got some other layers. One is called \"Green Promamitzing\" it appears. Isn't it interesting that the doctor's name is Dr. Green? One of the questions in a way that does not contaminate is afker I've identified some of this st- is there and they've given me a few right answers about what some of it is, \"If there were a doctor associated with this programming and his name were a color, you know, like Dr. Chartreuse or something, if his name were a color, what color would the color be?\" Now once in a while I've had some other colors mentioned in about three or four patients that I felt were trying to dissimulate in some way and I don't really believe had this. In one case I got another color and I found out later it was a doctor whose name was a color who was being trained by Dr. Green almost thirty years ago and he supervised part of the programming of this woman under this doctor. I remember one woman couldn't come up with anything. No alter would speak up with anything. I said, \"Okay,\" and we went on to some other material. About two minutes later she said, \"Green. Do you mean Dr. Green?\" We found this all over. There appears to be some Green Programming below that and I suspect that you get down to fewer and more centralprograms the deeper you go. Well, all Green Programming is Ultra-Green and the Green Tree. Cabalistic mysticism is mixed all into this. If you're going to work with this you need to pick up a couple of books on the Cabala. One is by a man named Dion Fortune called \"Qabala\" with a \"q,\" Dion Fortune."},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO Another is by Ann Williams-Heller and it's called \"The Kabbalah.\" I knew nothing about the Cabala. It was interesting. A patient had sat in my waiting area, got there considerably early and drew a detailed multicolored Cabalistic Tree over two years ago. It took me two months to figure out what it was. Finally, showing it to somebody else who said, \"You know? That looks an a&l lot like the Cabala Tree\" and that rang a bell with some esoteric in an old book and I dug it out. Bat was the background of Dr. Green. Now the interesting thing about the Green Tree is his original name was Greenbaum. What does \"greenbaum\" mean in German? Green Tree, Ultra-Tree and the Green Tree. I've also had patients who didn't appear to know that his original name was Greenbaum, volunteered that there were parts inside named Mr. Greenbaum. Now let me give you some information about parts inside that may be helpful to you if you're going to inquire about these things, because my experience is one part will give you some information and either run dry or get defensive or scared and stop. and so you punt and you make an end run and you come around the other direction, you find another part. I'll tell you several parts to ask for and ask if there's a part by this name. And, by the way, when I'm screening patients and fiddling around with this, I throw in a bunch of spurious ones and ask, \"Is there a part inside by this name and by that name\" as a check on whether or not it appears genuine. For example. \"In addition to the core,\" I ask, \"is there a part inside named Wisdom?\" Wisdom is a part of the Cabalistic Tree. Wisdom, I've ofien found, will be helphl and give you a lot of information. \"Is there a part inside named Diana?\" I mean I may throw in all sorts of things. \"Is there a part inside named Zelda?\" I've never encountered one yet! Just to see what kind of answers we get. I try to do this carefully. Diana is a part that, in the Cabalistic system, is associated with a part called the Foundation. You will be fascinated to know that. Remember the Process Church? Roman Polanski's wife, Sharon Tate, was killed by the Manson Family who were associated with the Process Church? A lot of prominent people in Hollywood were associated and then they went underground, the books say, in about seventy-eight and vanished? Well, they're alive and well in southern Utah. We have a thick file in the Utah Department of Public Safety documenting that they moved to southern Utah, north of Monument Valley, bought a movie ranch in the desert, renovated it, expanded it, built a bunch of buildings there, carefully monitored so that very few people go out of there and no one can get in and changed their name. A key word in their name is \"Foundation.\" ?'he Foundation. There are some other words. The Foundation is part of the Tree. So you can ask, \"Is there something inside known as The Foundation?\" I might ask other things to throw people off \"Is there something known as the Sub- Basement?\" Well, maybe they'll conceive of something. Or \"Is there something known as the Walls?\" There are a variety of questions you can come up with, to sort of screen some things. I've also found that there will often be a part called \"Black Mae,'' a part called \"Master Prowammer,\" and that there will be computer operators inside. How many of you have come into computer things in patients? There will typically be comvuter overatom: Computer Operator Black, Computer Operator Green, Computer Operator Purple. Sometimes they'll have numbers instead, sometimes they'll be called Svstems Information Directors. You can find out the head one of those. There'll be a source of some information for you. I will ask inside, \"Is there a part inside named Dr. Green?\" You'll find that there are, if they have this kind of"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO programming, in my experience. Usually with a little work and refiaming, you can turn them and help them to realize that they were really a child-part who's playing a role and they had no choice then, but they do now. You know, they played their role very, very well, but they don't have to continue to play it with you because they're safe here and in fact, \"If the Cult simply found out that you talked to me, that they you had shared information with me, you tell me what would they do to you?\" Emphasize that the only way out is through me and that they need to cooperate and share information and help me and that I'll help them. So all these parts can give you various information. Now they have tried to protect this very carehlly. Let me give you an example with Ultra-Green. 1 discovered this -- by the way I used to think this programming was only in bloodline people. I've discovered it in non- bloodline people, but it's a bit different. They don't want it to be just the same. I don't think you'll find deep things like Ultra-Green and probably not even Green Programming with non-bloodline people. But let me tell you something that I discovered first in a non- bloodline and then in a bloodline. We were going along and a patient was close to getting well, approaching final integration in a non-bloodline and she suddenly started hallucinating and her fingers were becoming hammers and other things like that. So I used an affect-bridge and we went back and we found that what happened was that they gave suggestions, that if she ever got well to a certain point she would go crazy. The way they did this was they strapped her dawn and they gave her LSD when she was eight vears old. When she began hallucinating they inquired about the nature of the hallucinations so they could utilize them in good Ericsonian fashion and build on them and then combine the drug-effect with powefil suggestions. \"If you ever get to this point you will go crazy. If you ever get Wy integrated and get well you will go crazy like this and will be locked up in an institution for the rest of your life. They gave those suggestions vigorously and repetitively. Finally, they introduced other suggestions that, \"Rather than have this happen, it would be easier to just kill yourself.\" In a bloodline patient then, as I began inquiring about deep material, the patient started to experience similar symptoms. We went back and we found the identical things were done to her. This was called the \"Green Bomb.\" B-0-M-B. Lots of interesting internal consistencies like thatplgv on words with Dr. Greenbaum, his original name. Now in this case it was done to her at age nine for the first time and then only hers was diierent. Hers was a suggestion for amnesia. \"If you ever remember anything about Ultra-Green and the Green Tree you will go crazy. You will become a vegetable and be locked up forever.\" Then finally the suggestions added, \"And it'll be easier to just kill yourself than have that happen to you, if you ever remember it.\" At age twelve then, three years later, they used what sounds like an Amytol interview to try to breach the amnesia and find out if they could. They couldn't. So then they strapped her down again, took and gave her something to kind of paralyze her body, gave her LSD, an even bigger dose and reinforced all the suggestions. Did a similar thing at the age of sixteen. So these are some of the kind of booby traps you run into. There are a number of cases where they combined powedbl"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO drug effects like this with suggestions to keep us from discovering some of this deeper level stuff. What's the bottom line? Your guess is as good as mine but I can tell you that I've had a lot of therapists who were stymied with these cases who were going nowhere. In fact someone here that I told some basic information about this to in Ohio a couple of months ago said it opened all sorts of things up in a patient who'd been going nowhere. That's an often common thing. I - - think that we can move down to deeper levels and if we deal with some of the deeper level stuff it may destroy all the stuff above it. But we don't even know that yet. In some of the patients I'm working with we have pretty much dealt with a lot of the top-level stuff I'll tell you how we've done some of that. We'll take and erase one system like Omega. Then we -will have a huge abreaction of all the memories and fe&ngs in a fractionated abreaction associated with those parts. I typically find I'll say to them, \"Now that we've done this are there any other memories and feelings that any parts that were Omega still have?\" The answer's usually \"No.\" At that point I will say, \"I usually find at this point in time the majority, if not all, of those parts that used to be Omega no longer feel a desire or need to be different, realizing that you split off originally by them and want to go home to Mary and become one with her again.\" I use the concept often now -- which came from a patient -- of going home and becoming one with her. \"Going back from whence you came\" is another phrase I'll use with them. \"Are there any Omega parts inside who do not feel comfortable with that or have reservations or concerns about that?\" If there are we talk to them. We deal with them. A few may not integrate. My experience is most of the time they'll integrate and we may integrate twenty-five parts at once in a uolvhnpmented complex MPD. I think it is vitally important to abreact the feelings before you go on. Also for many patients it hasn't seemed to matter the order we go in but I've found a couple where it has. If it doesn't seem to matter I'll typically go Omega, then Delta because they have more violence potential, then Gamma to get rid of the self-deception stuff. What I will do before I just assume anything and do that, is once we've done Omega and showed them that success can occur and something can happen and they feel relief after, I will say to them, \"I want to ask the core -- through the fingers -- is there a specific order in which programs must be erased?\" You know maybe it doesn't matter but most of the time I found \"No.\" There are cases where we found \"Yes.\" I recommend doing one or two or three of those because they'll produce relief and and a sense of optimism in the patient. But then I would recommend starting to probe for the deeper level things and getting their input and recommendations about the order in which we go. Question? Q: What has been the typical age and typical gender of this type of person? Dr.H: I know of this being found in men and women. Most of the patients I know with MPD ritual abuse that are be in^ treated are women, however. I know of some men being treated where we've found this."},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO A while back I was talking to a small group of therapists somewhere. I told them about some of this. In the middle of talking about some of this a11 the color drained out of one social worker's face and she obviously had a reaction and I asked her about and she said, \"I'm working with a five-year-old boy,\" and she said, \"Just in the last few weeks he was saying something about a Dr. Green.\" I went on a little further and I mentioned some of these things and she just shook her head again. I said, \"What's going on?\" She said, \"He's been spontaneously telling me about robots and about Omega.\" I think you willFnd variations of this and that they've changed it, probably every few years and maybe somewhat regionally to throw us off in various ways but that certain basics and fundamentals will probably be there. I have seen this in ~eo~le UD into their _forties includinp -- ~eovle - whose parents were very. verv hiph in the CC4. other sorts of thinas like that. I've had some that were oriainally part of the Monarch Proiect which is the name of the aovemrnent - Intelli~ence project. Question in the back? Q: I'm still not grasping how one starts, how you find out how to erase. How do you get that information? Dr.H: I would say, \"I want the core, if necessary, using the telepathic communication ability you have to read minds,\" because they believe in that kind of stuff, \"so I11 use it.. .\" I was trained in Ericsonian stuff, \"...to obtain for me the erasure code of all Omega programs. When you've done so, I want the yes-finger to float up.\" Then I ask them to tell it to me. \"Are there backups for Omega programs?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay? How many backups are there?\" \"Six,\" they say, let's say. It's diierent numbers. \"Is there an erasure code for all the backup programs?\" \"No.\" \"Is there an erasure code that combines all the backups into one?\" \"Yes.\" \"Obtain that code for me and when you've go it give me the yes-signal again.\" It can move almost that fast in some cases where there's not massive resistance. Question? Q: Yes, can you tell me what you know about the risks to the therapist? [Laughter] Dr.H: You would have to ask. Q: Yeah, I'd like to know that. What kind of data do you have given that you've had contact with large numbers of people. Not just threats but also any injury, any family problems that have arisen. That's one question. A second one is are you aware of anybody that you've treated - or others -- with this level of dissociation and trauma that have recovered? Integrated? Whole and happy? Dr.H: Okay, I have one non-bloodline multiple, complex multiple who had this kind of programming where they have a lot of access to the patient as neighbors and where the doctor . . . . by the way, you 'Ilfind physicians hem'& involved. They've encouraged their own to go to medical school, to prescribe drugs to take care of their own, to get access to medical technology and be above suspicion. There have been a couple, in fact, in Utah who've been nailed now. We now in Utah have two full time ritual-abuse investigators"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO with statewide jurisdiction under the Attorney General's Office to do nothing but investigate this. [Applause] Okay? In a poll done in the State of Utah in January by the major newspaper and television station, they found that ninety percent of Utahans believe that ritual abuse is genuine and real. Not all of them believe it's a frequent occurrence but some of that was imparted from two years of work by the Governor Commission on Ritual Abuse, interviewing, talking, meeting people, gathering data. Now when people say, by the way, \"There's no evidence. They've never found a body,\" that's baloney. They found a body in Idaho of a child. They've had a case last summer that was convicted on first-degree murder charges, two people that the summer before that were arrested where the teenaged girl's finger and head were in the refiigerator and they were convicted of first-degree murder in Detroit. There have been cases and bodies. Back to risk. I know of no therapist who's been harmed. But patients inform us that there will come a future time where we could be at risk of being assassinated by patients who've been programmed to kill at a certain time anyone that they've told and any member of their own family who's not active. If that would come about is speculative. Who knows for sure? Maybe, but I don't think it's entirely without risk. A question in the back? Q: It seems to me that there seems to be some similar& between these kinds of prommminp and those ~eo~le who claim that thev1ve been abducted bv suaceshi~s and have had themselves bhvsicallv robed and rmromammed and all of that sort of thing. Since Cape Canaveral is across the Florida peninsula fiom me and I don't think that they've reported any spaceships lately, I was just wondering is there any sort of relationship between this and that? Dr.H: 1'11 share my speculation, that comes from others really. I've not dealt with any of those people. However, I know a therapist that I know and trust and respect who I've informed about all this a couple of years ago and has found it in a lot of patients and so on, who is firmly of the belief that those people are in fact ritual-abuse victims who have been programmed with that sort of thing to destroy all their credibility. someb body's coming in and reporting abduction by a flying saucer, who's going to believe them on anything else in the future? Also as a kind of thing that can be pointed to and said, \"This is as ridiculous as that.\" All I know is that I recently had a consult, a telephone consult, with a therapist where I had been instructing her about some of this kind of stuff. When we were consulting at one point in the fifth or sixth interview she said, \"By the way, do you know anything about this topic?\" I said, \"Well, not really\" and shared with her what I shared with you. I said, \"If it were me being with this guy ...\" that she'd been seeing for a couple of months, I said, \"I would ask inside for the core to take control of finger-signals and inquire about Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta.\" She proceeded to, do all that, got back to me a week later and said, \"Boy, were you on target. There is a part inside named Dr. Green. There's this kind of programming.\" Yes?"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO Q: What's the difference between this kind of program and cult-type abuse and Satanic abuse in the kind of cults with the candles and the ... Dr.H: This type of programming will be done in the cults with the candles and all the rest. My impression is this is simply done in people where they have great access to them or they're bloodline and their parents are in it and they can be raised in it from an early age. If they are bloodline they are the chosen generation. If not, they're expendable and they are expected to die and not get well. There will be booby traps in your way if they aren't non- bloodline people that when thev pet well thev will kill themselves. I'll tell you just a little about that. My belief is that some people that have ritual abuse and don't have this have been ritually abused but they may be may be part of a non-mainstream group. Satanism comes in as the overall vhilosophv overridinp all of this. People say, \"What's the Dumose of it?\" Mv best mess is that the ournose of it is that thev want an armv of Manchurian Candidates, ten of thousan& of mental robots who will do prostitution. do child vornomavhv, smu~ple drups. enpage in international arms smupplinp. do snuff films, all sorts of verv lucrative thinps and do their biddim and eventuallv the mepalomaniacs at the top believe thev'll create a Satanic Order that will rule the world. One last question. Then I'll give you couple of details and we need to shift gears. Q: You have suggested and implied that at some point at a high level of the U.S. Government there was support of this kind of thing. I know we're short of time, but could you just say a few words about the documentation that may exist for that suggestion? Dr.H: There isn't great documentation of it. It comes from victims who are imperiled witnesses. The interestina thin^ is how manv veovle have described the same scenario and how manv veoole that we have worked with who have had relatives in NASA. in the CU and in the Militarv. includinp verv hid-uvs in the Miliiruv. I can tell you that a friend and colleague of mine who has probably the equivalent of half the table space on that far side of the room filled with boxes with declassified documents fiom mind-control research done in the past which has been able to be declassified over a considerable -- couple of decades - period and has read more government documents about mind control than anyone else, has a brief that has literally been sent in the past week and a half asking for all information to be declassified about the Monarch Project for us to try to find out more. Now let me just mention something about some of the stuff that my experience is in several patients now that you may run into late in the process. I know I'm throwing a lot at you in a hurry. Some of it is completely foreign and some of you may think, \"Gosh, could any of this be true?\" Just, you know, ask. Find out in your patients and you may be lucky and there isn't any of this. Somewhere at a deep level you may run into some things like this. Let me describe to you, if I can find my pen, the system in one patient. One patient I had treated for quite a while, a non-bloodline person. We had done what appeared to be successfbl work and reached final integration. She came back to me early last year and"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO said she was symptomatic with some things. I started inquiring. I found a part there we'd integrated. The part basically said, \"There was other stuff that I couldn't tell you about and you integrated me and so I had to split off\" I had done some inquiring about things like Alpha, Beta as a routine part of it and found they were there and I said to this part, \"Why didn't you tell me about this stuff?\" She said, \"Well, we gave you some hints but they went right over your head.\" Says, \"I'm sony, but we know that you didn't know enough to help us but now we know you can.\" So the stuff started coming out. It was interesting. She described the overall system -- if I can remember it now -- as being like this. The circle represented harm to the body, a system of alters whose primary purpose was to hurt her including symptoms like Munchhausen's, self-mutilation, other kinds of things. Each of the triangles represented still another different system. She said, \"With the exception of me,\" this one part, \"you dealt with the whole circle with the work that we did before but you didn't touch the rest of the stuff.\" Okay. In the middle of all this was still another system consisting of the Cabalistic Tree, which some of you are aware, looks approximately likethis with lines in between and so on and so forth. There's a rough approximation. That represented another system. Then once we got past that she implied that this entire thing was somehow encompassed by, what do you call it, an hourglass. I kept thinking we were at final integration then I'd find some other parts. This person had an eagle-eye husband that was watching for certain things that we found to bereliable indicators. So often I would get evidence of dissociation within a few days. It would suddenly be picked up. You know, what we found was I continued to find evidence of dissociation and I'd find parts. Finally this part, as I got angry with him and said, \"Why when I give these ideomotor inquiries am I getting lied to?\" This part said, \"Because you don't understand. You're going to get us all killed.\" We started talking and then she basically said, \"It's been programed so that ifym succeed and think ymtve succeeded, you will fail. Khey build it in as a way to laugh at you, that ifym ever get us integrated, we will die.\" Here's what she said, this part said, \"I'm one of twelve disciples,\" and I've seen this in others, twelve disciples within this hourglass each of whom had to memorize a disciple-lesson which were basic Satanic kind of premises, philosophies of life like \"be good to those who hurt you, hate those who are nice to you,\" on and on and on. There may be two or three sentences like that associated with each that they had to memorize them. They said, \"We are like grains of sand falling and when the last grain of sand falls, there's Death.\" I said, \"Is Death a part?\" \"Yes. When the last grain of sand falls the Sleeping Giant awakens.\" The Sleeping Giant was Death, who was then to kill them on Day-One or Day-Six after awakening unless certain things were followed and we did some of those. Well we also found Death had a sister as a backup, used with mirrors to create the sister part. We had to get past and deal with that too. Death had certain things that they said had to be done to integrate. I started to say, \"Oh, come on, they lied to you before.\" She said, \"Wait a minute. This what they said you'd say. They said that no doctor would ever believe that they had to go these extremes to get us well and that's part of the reason they'd fail.\" I said, \"Well, tell me, tell me again.\" She said, \"I have to be dressed all in red. I have to have Demerol onboard, have taken Demerol. A code has to be given and it has to be in a room that's totally dark. It has to happen on Day-One or Day-Six after this part's been awakened.\" I said what I'd have to lose? I had a psychiatrist give her a little Dernerol. We"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO used the code. My office didn't have any windows anyway. It was pretty easy. Oh, and there had to be four, I think, candles lit. Well, fine. So we did it and everything went well. Maybe it would have gone well if we hadn't done it, but I decided not to take the chance and to trust the patient maybe. Well, so we go on and then we find another part. There's Death And Destruction, another backup also with a sister that we had to get through. In fact, I think there were two backups there. Interestingly, the very last part was an extremely nice part, made especially that way so that they wouldn't want to lose them because they would be so adorable and so loving and so sweet that they wouldn't want to maybe get rid of them. Then we found that she continued to have these feelings with this last part left now of darkness and blackness inside. What did we find? A curtain. She said, \"They assumed that if you ever got to this point, you would,\" and along the way, by the way, we had encountersd this stuff about the LSD stuff, the Green Bomb programming. The message was that she said, \"There is a curtain behind which are the remaining feelings and memories, but it can't be opened fiom the middle. It's lie a stage curtain. It has to opened this way,\" that it can't be opened. They assumed that you would try to deal with all the feelings. That can't be opened until you've dealt with that last part and they've integrated. So far it looks like we've got integration that's holding. So I found Death And Destruction and the Hourglass in non-bloodline. \"The Tree and the Hourglass,\" this patient informed me, \"were made of sand because we were meant to die. We're expendable. We're the unchosen generation.\" I've heard variously that it's crystals or blood that fills the Hourglass in bloodline people. By the way, you can do real simple things like turn the Hourglass on its side so nothing can fall out, so time stands still to be able to do certain kinds of work. Spread the grains of sand on the seashore so that they can't be numbered and the time will not be counted. Got that idea fiom a ritual-abuse victim who had seen some of this kind of programming done that another therapist was seeing. So those would be just a few other hints about things that may be helphl or meaningfid. We're talking about very intensive things and at deep levels to to me this give us two things. One thing it gives to me is hope because it gets to material and it makes progress like nothing else we've ever seen with these people who have it. The second thing it does for me is it demoralizes me, too, because although three years ago I had a pretty good idea about the extent and breadth of what they'd one to these victims, I had no real appreciation for the depth and breadth and intensity of what they'd done. I want to come back to the other question over here now. The other question is how many of them can get well? We don't know. In most things in the mental health profession we accept two-thirds of the patients are going to improve, maybe seventy percent. There's very little we can get everybody well. I think one of the sad things we have to face is that many of these patients will probably never be well. My personal belief is that if they are being messed with their only hope of getting well is if they can somehow get out of contact. Now I know patients who've gone to other states and simply had deep-level alters pick up the phone and call and said, \"This is our new address and phone number\" so that"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO they could be picked up locally. I mean in an inpatient unit for an extended period of time. If they are in a Cult from their area and they are still being monitored and messed with, my own personal opinion is we can't get them well and can't offer more than humanitarian caring and supportiveness. Lots of therapists do not like to hear that. That's my opinion. I believe that if somehow they're lucky enough to be wealthy enough to have protection, to have somehow gotten away in some way and we can work with them without being messed with, that they have a chance to reach some semblance of normality and livability with enough intensive work. My own personal belief is I don't think anybody with this kind of programming is well in this country yet. There are some who are well along the way. I've got a couple who are well along in their work and have done a tremendous amount, but they're clearly not well yet. Q: Could you speculate on the relationship between this stuff and the fantasy games that have been proliferating, Dungeons and Dragons and that sort of thing? Dr.H: Well, there are a lot of things out there to cue people. You want to see a great movie, interesting movie, to cue people? Go see \"Trancers II.\" You can rent it in your video shop. Came out last fall. One night in sheer desperation for something at the video store, you know? Nine o'clock on Friday night. Everything's gone. I rented a couple of movies and one of them is that. Fascinating. They're talkrng about Green World Order. Yes, \"Trancers 11.\" And who is the production company? Full Moon Productions. I couldn't see much cuing in \"Trancers I,\" but who's the production company in \"Trancers I\"? Alter Productions. There are lots of things around that are cuing. There's an interesting person in the late sixties who talked about the Illuminati. Have any of you ever heard of the Illuminati with regard to the Cult? Had a patient bring that up to me just about exactly two years ago. We've now had other stuff come out from other patients. Appears to be the name of the international world leadership. There appear to be Illuminatic Counsels in several parts of the world and one internationally. The name of the international leadership of the Cult supposedly. Is this true? well, I don't know. It's interesting we're getting some people who are trying to work without cuing who are saying some very similar things. There was an old guy in Hollywood in the late sixties who talked about the infiltration of Hollywood by the Illuminati. Certainly what some patients have said is all of this spook stuff, horror stuff, possession and everything else that's been popularized in the last twenty years in Hollywood is in order to soften up the public so that when a Satanic world order takes over, everyone will have been desensitized to so many of these things, plus to continually cue lots of people out there. is that true? Well, I can't definitely tell you that it is. What I can say is I now believe that ritual-abuse prommminp is wides~read. is svstematic, is vew owanized from highlv esoteric information which is uublished nowhere, has not been on any book or talk show, that we have found all around this country and at least one forekn country.

Q: Do you have any techniques for decreasing your level of uncertainty that a patient is or is not being still tampered with, \"messed with,\" as you said?"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Dr.H: Just that I would ask several of the parts I've inquired about, Core, Diana, Wisdom, Master Programmer, several parts inside I would ask about these sorts of things and I will keep asking it. As you do additional work and get a bit further, I would ask again to find out. In the back? Q: I wonder if you've heard or you know of the Martin Luther Bloodline? Dr.H: The what? Q: Martin Luther Bloodline? Dr.H: I know nothing about Martin Luther Bloodline. I'll give you one other quick tip. Ask him about an identification code. There's an identification code that people have. It will involve their birth date. It may involve places where they were programmed and it will usually involve a number in there that will be their birth order, like zero-two if they were second-born. It will usually involve a number that represents the number of generations in the Cult, if they are bloodlines. I've seen up to twelve now, twelve ~ener~ons. Q: I have seen a lot of the things you've been describing today in several patients. I wanted to ask you a question about the Seven Systems. You mentioned something about systems here. Are there Seven Systems? Dr.H: There has been that described in some patients, yes, the Seven Systems. Q: Could you say what that is or a little diagram? Dr.H: I don't think we know enough to know what it is, honestly. I think it may have to do with Seven Cabalistic Trees. Q: Have you ever had any evidence where any of these people have beenad and there have been anything of their body-parts that might be related to this, private parts in particular? Dr.H: Well, there are certainly people that have had tattoos, that have had a variety of other kinds of things, some of which have been, you know, documented in cases, but I mean to say, well, maybe they did that to themselves or had it done consciously to really prove something, not that occurs to right off the bat. Let me just take this one last question back and we need to go on to other material because we're never going to get through it all. I'll just ask you to hold your question.

It's controversial. My personal opinion has come to be if they're going to kill me, they're going to kill me. There's going to be an awful lot of information that's been put away that'll go to investigative reporters and multiple investigative agencies, if it happens, and an awful lot of people like you , I hope, that if I ever have an accident will be pushing for a very large-scale investigation."},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The Transition from Mechanistic to Quantum Society The Mechanistic World View Today's perception of social and political philosophy, in all it's \"modernity\", is a mechanistic perception formed in direct response to the philosophical and scientific concepts of the seventeenth century that produced the pattern forming the basis for today's \"science\". This perception is reinforced by constant exposure to these underlying themes in the media and culture around us. The greatest proponent of the mechanistic world view was Isaac Newton, a member of the influential British Royal Society, who extended his viewpoint to include what he perceived as \"problems in moral philosophy\". French scientists in the 18th century tried to extend his ideas to questions of history and spirit. The power of Newton's mechanistic view drew nearly every influential social, political and economic thinker of the 17th 18th and 19th centuries to use them as a model. Thomas Hobbes, John Stuart Mill and John Locke turned to mechanistic physics for inspiration and example in their writings on state and society. The deterministic laws of history expounded by German Karl Marx, the mechanistic and reductionist theory of evolution of Darwin and Wallace, Freud's reductionist \"scientitic model\" of the self, and Rev. Thomas Malthus' pessimistic view of human lie all took root from the mechanistic concept of the universe. Mechanism, or the mechanistic view, has the following components: (1) Mechanism stresses itn unbridgeable gulf\" between human beings and the physical world. Human consciousness has no place in Newton's vast \"world machine\". Nature is perceived as something to be conquered and used. Of course, this is one of the main sources of out current ecological crisis. (2) Mechanism stresses hierarchy- It structures existence according to ever-ciescendig units of analysis. In mechanistic societies, power and organization are structured in the same ladder of ascending and descending authority. (3) Mechanism stresses isolated, separate and interchangable parts. Everything in Newton's universe is ultimately reduccible to so many individual atoms and the forces acting between them, so called atomism. Atomism encourages a model of relationship based on conflict and con_fi.ontation, on part against part. This was seen in Hobbes mechanistic proposal that \"life is a struggle, each against every man\". In fact, atomism underlies the modem cult of the \"expert\", the detached individual who is very knowledgeable about isolated bits of information or experience but is imorant of the whole of which these bits are a part. The expert is often alienated from the situation or"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO community in which he practices his expertise. This alienation was extended even hrther in society by virtue of the Industrial Revolution. The idea put forth that \"life was a struggle, each against all\" was taken to a new atomistic low by Malthus, who put forth the notion that the elements of population needed to be controlled by a \"select elite\" and, after observing goats, the reductionist notion that humans were motivated by one factor - sexual reproduction. Furthermore, Malthus proposed another erroneous notion - that the population would increase geometrically and eat itself into oblivion and that population reduction mandates needed to be imposed by the 'Ute': Passive population reduction consisted of population neglect, which allowed the in~astructzrre supporting the existence of population to collapse without maintenance, plus indirect killing by the creation of condztions that would promote death of the non- elite. We see this today embodied in the \"treat symptom instead of cause\" principle of allopathic medicine, which views the human body mechanistically and suppresses all medical treatment except on& that which is allowed within the mechanistic view - drugs, surgery, radiation and other 'inass to mass\"approaches to life. In fact, modem society is a culture of death. The deliberate environmental pollution, deliberate withdrawal of vitamins and nutrients in processed food and their replacement by petroleum derivative synthetics, the deliberate addition of synthetic behavior-afEecting chemicals to the food and water, and the deliberate undermining of any attempt at conective action all support the indirect killing proposed by Malthus. Malthusian thought patterns provided a rationale for the \"elite\" to maintain themselves as such, and populations became a threat instead of an asset. (4) Mechanism stresses the single point of view. In science, when a single theory is the only theiry, then science essentially becomes a religion - scientism. The single point of view infers the concept of an \"absolute space-time fiamework\". In Newtonian physics, there is only one reality at a time. You will immediately recognize this as the basis for the social reality in Western Civilization, typified by the United States, where the true multidimensional nature of the universe is viciously suppressed in order to preserve the status quo, which is based on false science and false premises about reality. Furthermore, this 'Single point of view7'is taken advantage of by the media. When the media produces a continual series of conflicting viewpoints, it deliberately and knowingly performs the fbnction of throwing the mind of the population into chronic indecision. The either/or of \"absolute choice\" became the chosen way of dealing with reality. A statement is either true or false, a course of action is either good or bad. There can only be one truth, one best course of action. Paradox, multiplicity, difference and plurality cannot be accomodated. Presentation of conflicting viewpoints is paralytic. Because innovation and progress is suppressed to maintain what is essentially a 'low-tech\" society compared to the technology actually in hand by the government, it fits the mechanistic model very precisely. Strict determinist \"laws\" actually correspond to a very narrow spectrum of physical reality."},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Because of the impact of Malthusian thought, which maintained that large populations were a threat, acquisition of land for resources became a major motivating factor in 20th century warfare. While still in this is being supplanted by the drive for corporate capital, and still again by the drive for the mind of the population. Population control, including control of behavior (Skinner) and thought, is a Malthusian mandate. The size of the population is constantly being touted in the media. In fact, all of these thought patterns are not at all based on fact. It has been calculated that Earth can comfortably hold over 44 billion people, if the resources are cooperatively managed. Cooperative management and mutual aid, combined with the release of previously suppressed non-polluting technology, combined krther with a shift in the mental patterns into more altruistic modes, will ensure a peaceful move into space for a large segment of the planetary population. As pointed out in Matrix IV, future life progressions and other data indicate that the population of the planet will decrease within the next several decades by virtue of a series of alterations in both planetary geology and other factors, which is all the more reason to maximize the health and welfare of the population we do have. We do not have too many people on the planet. We have too little common sense. Fractal Evolution An Extract fiom Avoiding Exhnction, also by Leading Edge ~esearch' \"A decade after Mandelbrot published his physiological speculations, some theoretical biologists began to fmd fractal organization controlling structures all through the body. The standard 'exponential' description of a bronchial branching proved to be quite wrong; a fractal description turned out to fit the data.. . .\" -James Gleick In the view of the Darwinists, the endlessly exquisite designs of nature are the result of an interplay of two factors--random genetic mutation and Natural Selection. Genetic mutation proposes, Natural Selection disposes. The question of \"design\" in nature was one that troubled Charles Darwin all his professional life. In the year following the publication of the Origin, he writes to Asa Gray: \"I am conscious that I am in an utterly hopeless muddle. I cannot think that the world, as we see it, is the result of chance; and yet I cannot look at each separate thing as the result of design.\" Darwinist Ernst Mayr, for one, is well aware of the design dilemma. \"No consequence of Darwin's theory of natural selection was a source of greater dismay to his ' Avoiding Extinction: The Transitioning of Humankind porn the Present Nightmare to the New Enlightenment, Dr. Dan Hall, Leading Edge Research, 1995. $24.95 ppd Foreign add S 10. 168pages.

Those who studied the countless superb adaptations of animals and plants had been most gratified by the explanation that such perfection was clearly the result of design by the maker of this world.\" In fact, Darwin did not eliminate design fiom nature, as he himself indicates in his letter to Gray. Darwin and his followers succeeded only in challenging the traditional idea that the source of all design is God. After citing many examples of fantastic design in nature, Mayr goes on to say, \"But when we ask how this perfection is brought about, we seem to find only 4 arbitrariness, planlessness, randomness, and accident ....\" If Mayr and his fellow Darwinists find in nature only \"arbitrariness, planlessness, randomness, and accident\" that is a reflection on their ability, not on the capability of nature. Today, any graduate student asked to develop a paper on the subject of design in nature would invariably wind up looking into fractal geometry and mathematics. Fractal geometry, as its name implies, is a geometry focusing on the description of geometrical structures, and structuring, in fiact[ion]al space. Until 1975, we didn't have a fiactal geometry. Our only geometry was the familiar Euclidean geometry, which goes back over two thousand years. The Elements of Euclid (circa 300 B.C.) summarized in thirteen volumes the mathematical knowledge of ancient Greece. Up into our own century, Euclid's books of geometry were taken as the final, authoritative word on the subject. Euclidean geometry deals with whole rather than fractional realities. Plane geometry concerns planar (one- and two-dimensional) structures, and solid geometry describes volumetric (three-dimensional) structures. 'New geometry's always begin,\" writes James Gleick, \"when someone changes a hndamental rule.\" Fundamental supposition would be a better term than rule. Gleick continues: \"Suppose space can be curved instead of flat, a geometer says, and the result is a weird curved parody of Euclid that provides precisely the right fi-amework for the general theory of relativity. Suppose space can have four dimensions, or five, or six. Suppose the number expressing dimension can be a fiaction .... suppose shapes are defined, not by solving an equation once, but by iterating it [repeating it] in a feedback loop.I1 French mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot made a number of the above suppositions, and the result was the birth in 1975 of \"fractal\" (fiactional) geometry and mathematics (Les Objets Fractal). The original stimulus behind Mandelbrot's work was an interest in irregular (seemingly \"chaotic\") patterns. Cotton prices over a long period of time, frequency of earthquakes, flooding conditions .... all seemed to occur with a regular irregularity. What was the principle of order within the chaos? 4 Mayr, p. 32. Gleick, p. 226."},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Mandelbrot's \"studies of irregular patterns, \" Gleick indicates, \"and his exploration of infinitely complex shapes had an intellectual intersection: a quality of self-similarity. Above all, fractal meant self-similar.\" \"Self-similarity is symmetry across scale. It implies recursion, pattern inside of pattern. Mandelbrot's price charts and river charts displayed self-similarity, because not only did they produce detail at finer and finer scales, they also produced detail with certain constant measurements.. . . 'I 7 The physical world, the explicate realm, is structured along the lines of fiactal geometry. The basic underlying idea is the idea of repetition ,of structure in different scales of magnitude. The common example is a coastline. A photograph of a section of coastline from a blimp will show the same ragged contours as a photograph of the whole coast taken fiom a space station. A photograph of a one-foot-long section of the same coast will also show the same contours. The various coastlines are \"self-similar,\" each similar to the others in shape, but different in magnitude. Mandelbrot and those who took up the tools he provided found endless evidence of the fact that the creation, the explicate realm, is designed via fractal mathematics. In light of these findings, the idea of Mayr and other Darwinists that the perfections of nature are the result of \"planlessness\" is simply ludicrous. The physical realm is structured like \"Chinese eggs,\" eggs nested within eggs. \"A decade after Mandelbrot published his physiological speculations,\" Gleick writes, \"some theoretical biologists began to find fiactal organization controlling structures all through the body. The standard 'exponential' description of bronchial branching proved to be quite wrong; a fiactal description turned out to fit the data. The urinary collecting system proved fractal. The biliary duct in the liver. The network of special fibers in the heart that cany pulses of electric current to the contracting muscles.. . . 11 8 \"How did nature manage to evolve such complicated architecture?\" Gleick asks, rhetorically. \"Mandelbrot's point is that the complications exist only in the context of traditional Euclidean geometry. As fractals, branching structures can be described with transparent simplicity, with just a few bits of information ....\" \"Fractal mathematics\" is comprised of the simple formulas by which conversions are made--fractal to fiactal. The seemingly infinite complexity of the Mandelbrot set is based on the simple formula z + z2 + C. Take a number, multiply it by itself, and add the original number. lo Gleick, p. 103. ' Ibid. Gleick, p. 109. Gleick, pp. 109-110. 'O Gleick, p. 227."},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO \"By the 1980s,\" Gleick writes, \"a home computer could handle arithmetic precise enough to make colorfbl pictures of the [Mandelbrot] set, and hobbyists quickly found that exploring these pictures at ever-greater magnification gave a vivid sense of expanding scale. If the set were thought of as a planet-sued object, a personal computer could show the whole object, or features the sue of cities, or the size of buildings, or the size of rooms, or the sue of books, or the size of letters, or the size of bacteria, or the size of atoms. The people who looked at such pictures saw that all the scales had similar patterns, yet every scale was different. And all these microscopic landscapes were generated by the same few lines of computer code.\" A decade or so after the publication of Les Objets Fractal, as Gleick observes, a number of biologists (and not just \"theoretical biologists\") began the work of re- understanding the body in terms of fractal engineering. Today, the fractal approach is being used to better understandig every component of the human body. Neuroscientist Ary Freeman, for instance, maintains that a kind of \"ordered unpredictability\" lies at the heart of the brain's ability to perceive the world. \"Studying the electrical activity of the brains of rabbits trained to recognize various smells, Freeman finds that the animals' brain waves shift to a diierent pattern of chaotic activity as each smell is inhaled.\" l2 \"Paul Rapp of the University of Pennsylvania has found similar results in humans. When his subjects were asked to count backward fiom 100 by sevens, their brain-wave patterns suddenly shifted into a chaotic state that marked intense concentration.. . . \" l3 The Freeman and Rapp references are fiom a recent article titled \"The Mathematics of Human Life,\" by William F. Allman. We sense Allman's excitement as he comes to realize the 111 dimensions of the fiactal phenomenon: \"The body's overall structure bears the signature of the chaotic processes that shape it--right down to the DNA molecule that serves as its genetic blueprint .... The fiactal nabre of DNA appears to play a role in its ability to pass on biological information that controls development of the various parts of the body. Because fractals represent a midway point between randomness and predictability, DNA's fiactal structure may represent a compromise between encoding the maximum amount of information, while still being extremely resilient to damage.. . . o 14 The Work of Dr. Bruce H. Lipton In the early eighties, the Darwinian orthodoxy still reigned supreme, and consequently it was assumed that the secrets of biological evolution would be discovered \" Gleick, p. 231. IZ William F. Allman, \"The Mathematics of Human Life,\" U.S. N&S & World Report, June 14, 1993: 84-85. 13 Allman, 85."},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO as the result of research in genetics. Most biologists interested in evolutionary process were guided (or misguided as it were) by the doctrine of the primacy of the DNA. For these researchers, fractal geometry was of interest as it might apply to understanding the nature and workings of the DNA. The above reference to the \"fractal nature of DNA suggests the sort of conclusions that came from the orthodoxy. Among the more unorthodox biologists interested in fractal mathematics was University of Virginia-trained anatomist and cell biologist Dr. Bruce H. Lipton. As indicated in earlier chapters, improvements in electron-microscopy during the fifties had made it possible for researchers to get a really look at the cellular membrane. Lipton's career as evolutionist began when he redied that consciousness is not something encoded in the genes (the position of the orthodoxy) but something that is \"transduced\" by the IMP system of the cell membrane. The biological basis of consciousness, Lipton maintains, is the IMP (integral membrane protein) unit, a stimulus-response mechanism in which the \"receptor\" is the stimulus receiver and the \"effector\" the response activator. \"So,\" Lipton says, \"we get into a really interesting understanding of consciousness here. The fbndamental unit of consciousness happens to be a protein receptor and protein effector in combination. If you separate either of these two proteins fiom each other, then the unit of that perception is not made. If you cut the receptor off, no signals come in, or jf you cut the effector out then there's no response to the signal. In either case, you break the perception pathway.\" 15 The biological primacy of the membrane over the DNA is demonstrated, Lipton indicates, by the simple fact that if the IMP receptors are cut off, then the cell goes comatose and dies, whereas if the nucleus is taken out of the cell, the cell continues to operate normally, until such time as it requires new parts. New parts are supplied by the cell's Parts Department--the genome. Consciousness does not originate in the genome (the \"ghosts in the machine\" hypothesis of the Darwinists), it originates in the environment; it is transduced (processed) by the cellular membrane, and various of the signals that are so processed activate creative processes in the genome. If we view the cell as itself a stimulus-response mechanism, a kind of super IMP, then the cellular membrane would be the stimulus-receiver component and the genome the bottom-line response component. By consciousness, we refer to a process that occurs in any organism, fiom the prokaryotic cell to the human being-the process of receiving signals (fiom outer environment and inner domain) and translating those signals into appropriate biological responses. Clearly, as Lipton indicates, there is a wide spectrum of awareness, \"fiom the hypothetical organism that can see one percept--meaning it would have just one receptor Is The Biology of Consciousness--An Introduction to Fractal Evolution, unpublished dratt, June 1993. 594"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO and effector, so it can see only one thing, to a human being, who has an enormous range of awareness and enormous versatility in terms of response.\" l6 In keeping with orthodox doctrine, many biologists define consciousness as a strictly human phenomenon. That is not our definition here. There are great differences between the signal reception-response expressed by a unicellular organism and the signal reception-response expressed by the human being, but these differences do not juste the hypothesis that there is no relationship between awareness at the cellular level and awareness at the human level. Indeed, fiom the point of view of methodology, such an hypothesis--a \"negative hypothesisw--is invalid. It's possible to prove that which is, but how is it possible to find evidence for the non-existence of something? \"God does not exist, and here's the proof.. . \" If Darwinism should have taught us anything, it is the fact that evolution expresses continuig with change. First there is a something, and then the something becomes something else. The exact nature of the something else is determined by the nature of the something and by certain other factors that come into play to modify the something. By the standard of continuity with change, so convincingly expressed by Darwinism, we would suppose not that human consciousness is a \"special phenomenon\" (an idea which \"smacks of' the Biblical doctrine that man is a special creation), but that human consciousness is an evolved form of lower consciousness. Our presumption is that human consciousness is an evolved expression of cellular consciousness. That presumption is a starting point, and not necessarily the best possible starting point. It may be that Itzhak Bentov is correct in his understanding that we humans operate via two distinct consciousnesses-the rudimentary consciousness (the collective cell consciousness) and the higher consciousness, an emanation of our higher selves. I' In our present context, however, the main focus is on specific means by which organisms became \"smarter. \" Means of Cellular Consciousness Expansion Lipton identifies three primary means by which consciousness evolved, fiom unicellular consciousness to human consciousness. The first means was increase of cellular membrane surface area. Nature had to figure out how to make the prototype cell (the prokaryote) into a smarter cell--a cell with greater consciousness capability. Again, the cellular mechanism of perception is the IMP network. IMPS require access to the external environment and to the inner domain, and thus they cannot be stacked. The cell membrane contains only one layer of IMPS. This means that if the IMP (consciousness) capability of the cell is to be increased, then the surface area of the membrane must be increased. l6 Ibid. I' Ikhak Bentov, A Cosmic Book-On the Mechanics of Creation (Rochester, VT. Destiny Books), pp. 25-29. 595"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Expansion of cell membrane surface area was accomplished in two ways, through the development of an internal skeleton (the prokaryotic cell has an exo[outside]skeleton) and through the internalization of all systems not requiring a face-to-face contact with the external environment. In the case of the prokaryote, all systems (including the DNA) are on the membrane surface; in the case of the eukaryote (final stage cell), only the \"nervous system\" is on the surface. The other systems are internalized as organelles. How are organelles formed? Lipton: \"In evolution, functional groupings of plasmalemmal [membrane] IMPS invaginated and detached fiom the cell surface. These internalized portions of the plasmalemma provided for the formation of discrete membranous organelles, including the nucleus. Organization, fbnctional integration, and mobility of the organelles was provided by the cytoskeletal matrix.\" l8 Integration of Outputs What the evolution of consciousness next requires, as part of what we might call the \"membrane expansion program,\" is the development of the optimal program for the integration of inputs. The IMP receptors receive signals (inputs) and the effectors activate the output functions that transduce the signals into behavior. In addition to receptors and effectors there is an intermediate protein called a processor protein, or \"G protein,\" Processor proteins interface between receptors and effectors, and given their positions they have great potential for directing and re-directing incoming frequencies. In the words of Bruce Lipton: \"A processor can hook a receptor to one output, and another processor can hook the same receptor to a different output-so that one incoming signal can be split by the processor into multiple functions. Over evolution the processor proteins are co- ordinated, or co-ordinate themselves, in such a way that the processor sub-system has tremendous versatility in terms of its abiiity to 'get the most' out of incoming signals. The sub-system might be able, for instance, to use just one incoming sigial to provide a wide variety of biological functions.\" What the processor protein sub-system represent's, Lipton says, is \"a mechanism of expanding the consciousness not just by increasing the numbers of receptors and effectors, but by integrating them into functional biological repertoires. \" 19 The Fractal Ladder Once nature perfected the cell, which is to say maximized its capability for receiving and processing signals, then there was, according to Lipton, a momentary pause in the evolutionary process. If nature was to continue with the work of building greater and greater consciousness capabilities into the biological realm, she had to come up a new - '* \"Histology Introduction-From Cells to Tissues: A Brief Review of Evolution,\" academic course pamphlet, undated, p. 3. 19 Lipton , Biology of Conscioumess."},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO format. The cell format had been completed. What would be the next step? What was the solution that nature came up with? Dr. Lipton recalls the moment in 1983 when he discovered the answer to that question: \"I was sitting in my laboratory looking at a eukaryotic cell through an electron microscope. I was reiterating in my mind the common understanding that all the physiologic systems that can be found in the human being are in the eukaryotic cell when it really struck me .... the cell I was looking at was a fractal of the human being. Alternatively, the human being is a fractal of the cell--a version on a greater order of magnitude.\" From that moment, Lipton the anatomist and cell biologist became Lipton the evolutionist. \"Evolutionary process is not that very very long uninterrupted upward inclined plane that the Darwinists suppose it is,\" Lipton says. \"In terms of simple structures, evolution is more like a ladder-a fractal ladder which takes us, 'us' being the material realm, into higher and higher consciousness. The single cell--from prokaryote to eukaryote-is one rung of the ladder. After this rung was completed, nature took a bunch of state-of-the-art [eukaryotic] cells and combined them into the first multicellular organism. That first organism was the beginning of a new fiactal rung, a rung that is completed with the completion of the humanbeing. We humans are the eukaryotes of our fractal level. \" In the years following his realization, Lipton accumulated more and more information supportive of the hypothesis that fractal mathematics and geometry are at the formative heart of biology and evolution. \"The story of evolution at the level of the single cell is largely the story of cell membrane expansion,\" Lipton says. \"The more membrane surface, the more IMPS can be packed in. At the level of the multicellular organism, the maximizing of cellular membrane surface area is achieved through 'fiactal packing.' The way to get the most surface area into any given three-dimensional space is by means of fractal structuring.\" l4' The third primary means of consciousness expansion, Lipton reasons, is the combination of fractal rung end products into the proto-products of the next fractal step. The eukaryote is the end product of the single cell fractal rung. When it was completed, the next step was the combination of eukaryotic cells into the first multicellular organism. Human beings are the end-products of the multicellular rung. What marks the completion of this rung? Level of consciousness is the measure. Probably, the key marker of completion is the development of \"creator consciousness,\" the understanding that we \"create our own realities. \" Currently, we (humans) are very much in the process of discovering the facts of our \"creation consciousness,\" all that to do with the various programs (paradigms) on which we run. The book you are reading at this moment participates is this discovery process. What we call Darwinism is a basal paradigmatic program, one on which Western civilization has operated on for over a hundred years. It is not so much scientific program"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO as a political program. If the masses are convinced that existence is without purpose or plan, that \"anything goes\" and \"anything can happen,\" then of course what's needed is strict top-down controls. Thus we have the so-called \"New World Order,\" which is understood by many as an elitist conspiracy to control the world through control of economics, politics, and ultimately genetics and thought. In endeavoring to explain the origins of New World Orderism, critics invariably point to secret societies, some of which have been around for a very long time. Zle bottom-line source of whatever problems we might have as a civilization is the basal paradigm(s) we operate upon. Look at the paradigm, not at the people. People are in a real sense merely puppets of their paradigms. At least, this has been the case until recently. Now, we as a civilization seem to be really getting the idea that we and the creator energy are in some sense synonymous. Yes, we are fractals of the Creator. This is the meaning of the idea that man is made \"in the image\" of God. This is the message of Christ (and of other great spiritual leaders)-a message that humankind was not ready to receive, not until now. Embracing the understanding that what we call physical existence is, as it were, computer modeled by means of fractal mathematics is a key to the reconciliation of Western religion and science--of metaphysics and physics. Whatever label we might care to give the implicate order doesn't really matter, so long as we have a reasonably accurate understanding of \"the way it all works.\" The Christ message and the New Physics message point in the same direction, toward \"participatory Creatorism.\" Another important implication of fractal biology and evolution is that at long last, we have solid support for the Gaia hypothesis that the planet is one organism. The human being is a fractal of the single cell, the planet is a fractal of the human being. If existence is structured along fractal lies, then it is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that Earth is a single organism. If our planet is a single organism, then what is Homo sapiens? What is the role of humans? As suggested earlier, the probable role of humans with regard to the planet is akin to the role of immunity cells in the body-\"to serve and protect.\" The Biblical idea that humans are meant to be the \"stewards\" of the planet is an early (and very correct) expression of the understanding that humans are immunity cell equivalents. It's important to note that immunity cells are not simply the cops of the body. They are, in the words of Bruce Lipton, \"the cells of evolution.\" They have the ability to embrace the new things--the unknown--to learn those new things. They are the experts -- the Sherlock Holmeses. Further, they are little creators .... the creators of genetic blueprints for organisms that can protect the body against antigens."},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO If we are the protectors, it is certainly incumbent on us to complete our training soon. We may already be in the process of being tested. Not long ago, I attended a lecture by a most colofil and gifted Hopi by the name of Robert Morning Sky. Morning Sky claims that his grandfather and five other young men were the rescuers of an extraterrestrial whose ship crashed in August of 1947, not long after the famous Roswell crash. From this alien, Morning Sky says, much information was learned as to the true history of this solar system and this our planet. \"Star Elder\" told the young men who rescued him (all from different tribes), that the gods of old, the \"olden gods\" of Sirius and Orion, are coming back to renew their claim of ownership of Earth (Terra), and to renew their claim of mastery over humankind. If we humans do not know who and what we are, then we will continue to be what we've always been--fm animals. An interesting story.. . . incredible perhaps, but interesting in its timing. Just as we humans are coming to realize who and what we are, we are going to be tested by the appearance of some very interesting extraterrestrial \"antigens.\" What will these antigens say when we as a civilization have gone beyond master-slave games into the realization that we are the planet? In the words of a popular song, \"we are the world.\" Probably, what they will say is, \"We're certainly glad you had the smarts to figure that out. In that you're evolving quite nicely now, we won't have to re-cycle you and start all over.

This became imperative in Europa during the time of Santa Hermandad, Holy Office or Inquisitions. The Manchus in China also persecuted Taoists in the 16th century. So, for the record, we are NOT a Masonic, radical, revolutionary, or paramilitary group. We ARE only an ancient Hermetic Gnostic Magickal Order concerned with the intellectual and spiritual evolution of mankind. The so-called \"Books of the Order\" are the Emerald Tablet of Hennes, the Pyramid Scrolls, the I Ching, the Tao-Te-Ching and Hua-Hu-Ching of Lao-Tm, the T 'ai Chin Hua Tsmg chih2, Theogonia ~eometrid and the Coder urensis4. These seven books are the foundation of the Order. The true GnosisS is contained in one single Tablet - the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistos, the ancient Ionian Sage. Unlike purported, spurious translations of the Emerald Tablet which comprise many verbose, meaningless pages, this sacred document contains in one single page the entire havledge of the universe. It's language is symbols, glyphs and coded Alchemical lexicon. The original tablet was created by Hermes himself, and was made of sand that had been alchemically changed into Emerald - hence the name. It disappeared \"mysteriously\", but has been preserved in our main temple for thousands of years - that in itself was a \"miracle\" arranged by Hermes himself. It is the source of the true Gnosis, and a translation in German, English, Russian, Chinese and Turkish was made available for the first time in 1970 by our Order. Previously, the only available translation from ancient times was in classical Greek or Arabic. The so-called \"Emerald Tablet of the Chaldean Recension\" is a duplicate, a copy of the original, not in Ionian Gnostic symbols but in Chaldean symbols. Hence, something was lost in the translation, but has been restored by our Order in 1970 and made available to a few select individuals that could use the information wisely.6 It was released in Chicago, the location of our North American headquarters, for the USA. But now, it is moving to the West Coast, as dictated by the high chiefs of the Order, the location having been meticulously selected by the Mega Arkons themselves. It is worthwhile to note that all the Ancient Mystery Schools and Temples were located in great mountains, near great mountains or, when no mountain was available, an artiticial mountain was constructed. That was the primary reason for constructing the Pyramids of Giza. Why were mountains - the Himalayas, the Andes and the Alps - so sacred and special to the ancients? Mountains are not only great repositories of condensed gravitational energy due to their great mass, but also they create local distortions in the space-time continuum that, combined with Earth Grid Energy, make anti-gravity easily attainable and provide for local time warps necessary for Magickal initiations and astraetheric travel. This is possible because of the focusing of centrifugal components of \"The Secret of the Golden Flowern by the immortal Lu Tung-Pin. A manual on Meditation. ' A rare Greek treatise by PythagoradProclus on Sacred Geometry. 4 A classic from Ur, a rare Babylonian manuscript on astrophysics and science. Gnosis = To Know, in terms of Ancient Wisdom. 6 An accurate representation is found in the text of Unified Field, Part 8, Leading Edge #72."},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO the Coreolis force related to Earth spin. Furthermore, large mountains are accumulators of \"cosmic energy\", that fancy, nebulous New Age tern. Basically, \"cosmic energy\" is nothing other than higher-order cosmic rays composed of Takyons and Ante-matter7, not the lower-order radioactive particles that are harmful to humans, animals and plants. At mountains, an exchange of Gravitons and electrical charges occurs within the ionosphere, much the same as electron-positron emission and absorption occur on sharp metallic points. That is why the air in the mountains is so fresh, cool and invigorating. It contains an excess of electrons - negative ions - in the air surrounding its folds. Unlike deserts, where there are mostly positive ions, in forests and near waterfalls and mountains there is a profbsivity of electrons and negative ions, as well as fresh air to breathe. Perhaps the artificial \"mountains\" of Giza were also built to maintain a gravitational as well as electrostatic balance. The last reason, of course, is that great peaks in the Andes, Himalayas, Alps and other places are interconnected by an immense network of underground tunnels built by ancient civilizations that lived here thousands of years ago. It is not generally known that Mt. Everest, Aconcagua, Illimani, Mt.Hood, Mt. Rainier and Mt. McKinley are all interconnected by this immense network of underground tunnels that also connect with the Giza and other pyramids throughout the world. Maybe now it becomes clear why great Mystery Schools were located near these gravitational colossi! The most important archeological discoveries this year (1994) have been made in Egypt, at the Sphinx. In October 1994, while endeavouring to repair the side of the Sphmx, a worker discovered an ancient tunnel. Professor Zahi Hawass, chief antiquarian, said the passage was extremely old, dating to Pharonic times. Exploration of this passage will be done in February 1995, provided the authorities don't change their mind. As it is now, Egyptologists stand on very shaky ground due to the discoveries of \"maverick\" Egyptologist Anthony West and colleagues, who found water erosion on the sides of the Sphinx dating from at least 10,000 years ago, when the plain of Giza was a rain forest, not a desert. I think everybody should see the documentary video released in 1994 called \"Mysteries of the Sphinx\", which summarizes the research of West and associates. To see Egyptologists feel embarrassed and cornered by the evidence is worth the price of this excellent 85-minute videos. It seems that the Hall of Records is about to make its appearance ! To close, I wish to point out that our researchers doing presentations are both native Americans, or foreign-born, like myself, but they all have lived in and visited the US to study and become familiar with all the scenarios going on, both in fiont and behind the scenes. The emphasis is on the United States, because it is a trend-setter in technology, especially Tactical technology. That is why we have focused our attention on Western research primarily, for it affects the whole world. We must know what the secret plans of governments and military are, so we can protect ourselves wisely. 7 Ante-matter is not the same as Anti-matter.

However, we do not dare change their peculiar idiosyncrasies, for that is their privilege of expression. We cannot and do not edit what a human being says or how they say it, even if it is \"incorrect\". After 2,000 years of \"good grammar\" and \"syntax\", people still cannot communicate with each other, and war seems to be \"the only answer\" to frustrated spoken or written words.

Welcome to Chicago! This is the second year in the history of our Hermetic Gnostic Order, both the 1.0. and O.O., that we have had our annual meetings outside Europa. This is so because we see that, per our own historical annals, the times are indeed indicative of great change and forthcoming global turmoil, both political as well as cosmic. I am sure you all know what I am talking about. In behalf of Herr Professor Doktor N., who will be here with the Mega Arkons for the Equinox event, I extend a warm BienvenWelcome to you, especially our distinguished visitors fiom the far East and CCCP. As Dr. H indicated, this may be the last time we meet in scientific and Magickal conclave as a large group, 55 visitors and our local US 9, a total of 64 -- I Ching Ba Kua coincidence, perhaps? As you all know by now, 1994 has been very eventful and coloufil for our groups worldwide. It has been tragic for some of our members, since two of their close friends and associates departed to the Inner Planes prematurely. Last year, because of Ex Cathedra pronouncement by the Mega Arkons (Chief Hierophants), it was decided to make some of the technical details of the meeting available to a selected public in the international research community - unorthodox community, I must emphasize - not the academicians and orthodox community, of which some of us are members of, but quite De Congnito (secretly and anonymously) as decreed by the strict rules of the Order. We have been monitoring underground publications in both the US and abroad, and we decided to publish said extracts and selections in Enghsh, German, Polish, Turkish, Russian and Chinese. This year we have added Hindi to our multilingual editions, thanks to Sri Dr. S., who is also a Tantric Yogin and Master of Sanscrit fiom Baranashi (Benares). As English is becoming a Hieractic language, we feel that those conversant with English will get the info fiom the American publication, but our Eastern Brethren, where we have Great Schools, Temples and Tradition - they need their own tongue to Editor note: At this rate, I will be walking on water in about 30 days. Thanks guys. 604"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO know that is going on in the Western world. You chaps fiom Odord that speak Sanskrit, Namaste ! We have also been monitoring and kept a close watch on individuals in various countries, researchers that have connected with the Hermetic Gnostic current in one way or another, and whose research has the flavour of Ancient Wisdom coloured with modem science. We have found five individuals that meet these requirements. Some are known, some are unknown and chose to remain so. These persons are Dr. Jose Arguelles, an associate of the great Chinese I Ching scholar, the late Alex Kigh Diegh, a phenomenal authority on calendrical non-linear time. For years he published the I Ching Book of Days, a masterpiece. Now, Dr. Arguelles is the foremost authority in Mayan Calendrics. The next one is Dr. Rupert Sheldrake, a Britisher like myself, and perhaps the most controversial bio-scientist today. The British journal Nature called him \"a renegade scientist, a heretic.\" Nature's editor on the BBC said: \"His works should be condemned because he is a heretic -- like Galilee!\" This is on record - can you imagine that? Atomic Age? He is of course the author of the theory of morphogenetic fieldsloand morphic resonance, a sort of \"Unified Field of Biology\". In a capsule, his heresy is that information (consciousness) exists outside the body and in-forms the DNA! The other chap is a research associate of a fiiend of one our members of the Outer Order, a Greek chap by the name of Kostas T. Lambrakis, PhD, ScD., who has advanced the most outrageous and controversial theory yet about Unified Field Theory based on the Einstein-Bohm paradigm. He argues that Hilbert-and-Bohm Imaginary Space is more real that the Real Vector Phase Space of Quantum Mechanics, and that Consciousness is, in essence, the Bohm Super-Quantum Potential, hence Wte Holographic Information Continuum, hence Universal Intelligence, hence God! And, therefore, Consciousness is the U-g Factor of All Fields -- which are imaginary constructs! \" Then follows the enigmatic Carlos Castenada, who is by now a Shaman, Brujo or Nagual. His works are superlative, and his dream research truly verging on the Hermetic Gnosis. His teacher, Don Juan, I might add, was a pupil and disciple of our own 1.0. member, the South American Shaman fiom Peru, X.X. We feel his influence and teachings will be of great help to the masses, especially the dream work, when the Swce- Time Continuum shifls beain to occur. Fiy, the last chap is a Chinese scientist who is very close to discovering the secret of Antigravity and Free Energy, but must remain anonymous. We are keeping close tabs on these individuals, for they have tapped the True Gnosis. What the Order does is to see that these researchers receive the information and inspiration they need to flourish. lo For more extensive information on morphogenetic fields, see Matrix III, Volume 1, and Dr. A, Rupert Sheldrakes' classic book \"The Resence of the Pad: Morphk Resonance and the Habits of Nature\", 1988, Vintage Books, New York, ISBN 0-394-75990-7, $10.95. \" The Unified Field and Consciousness has been an ongoing series featured monthly in the US in The Leading E&e.

We will discuss that seems to be of immediate benefit to our own research endeavours in both physics, paraphysics, metaphysics and cognate sciences. Of great interest to the biophysics and neuroscience community is the amazing brain research and theories derived therefrom. Also a few theoreticians have advanced outrageous, radical departures from even unorthodox research. The work of our Russian colleagues, the pioneer research on cell morphology by the American biophysicist/materials scientist Tomas Landh, the controversial brain research of the American neurologist Richard Cytowic, the theoretical exploits of Consciousness mediated by quantum mechanical wave phenomena in microtubules by Professor Penrose of Oxford, and the Takyon-mediated models of superluminal perineural transport in psychic phenomena of Dr. Lambrakis, and, the nebulous applications of the marriage of silicon neural networks with biological neural networks of US classified brain research. Also, the amazing research of the military researcher, Dr. Eldon Byrd, and the novel concept of biological trauma'' by Samuel Lentine. One research endeavour that has been a dilemma to discuss or talk about is the present status of arti$cial intelligence, cybernetics, computer microchip research, and the electronic computerised communications and information networks, such as the 1ntemet13, and similar information networks, because they are heavily intricated with military, intelligence and defence de-ents involving national security of many nations. To make matters worse, some of these projects are either dzrectly or indirectly associated with very unusual brain and genome research. This leads into the realm of genetic engineering, and this seems to be a \"hot\" topic in many quarters. Some of the implications of these projects are so bizarre as to sound unbelievable, and even smack of science fiction.14 However, we have decided to discuss some of these topics following the \"computer hackers credo\", that is really quite sensible, that \"information wants to be free!\" So, we shall see how that flows in the context of this week's meetings. I say, for all you chaps -- and ladies -- that have been involved in military protocols and maneuvres, we will simply say when the time for said discussion comes: \"Cany on, blokes!\" and quietly add, \"May the Great Spirit guide you!\".

This year, since the locale for our meeting is Chicago, the Chairman will naturally be a local member, in this case, the most illustrious Dr. D, who was a very young man when he first met the tenured Herr Professor Doktor Einstein in Princeton. He has a very profound knowledge of two things: relativity and acoustics, especially Baroque music, for he is a very accomplished organist. Thank you for your patience with my long introduction. I seldom get to see and talk to such a numerous gathering of great scientists and initiates under one roof in this faraway suburb of Chicago. It is my pleasure to welcome you. And now, ladies and gentlemen, our chairman for the week, Dr. D. ( loud applause and multi-lingual cheers). Dr D: Thank you, Dr. A, for your meticulous introduction. I'd say it was not long, but extremely informative in setting the tone and mood for this unique meeting. Will Dr. B. please have the visual aids, projectors and video equipment ready? Thank you. At this point, we invite you to pick a special folder and notebook with the schedule of events and speakers for the week. We will commence immediately with the first speaker, then we will have a coffee break. Any questions? Yes, Mrs.Dr.L? Mrs.Dr.L: What is that dark purple glow around the entire house and garden that extends all the way to the access roadway? To the outside street? Dr D: Ahhh! Mrs. Dr. L is obviously clairvoyant! It is a Takyonic Force Field created by a special Delta-T and Delta-Wye Transforms, Unified Field Devices. You see, we don't use commercial electricity. We have our own special magnetic motors, and our power supply is not 60Hz. It is much higher. This type of electricity is called electrum. That feeling of coolness and calmness you feel is the protective force field, Tesla field if you will. This was the brainchild of Dr. G, the nuts and bolts engineer who designed the field converter motors and electrical wiring, appliances, and converters for all our installations. This seemingly luxurious mansion is really our research laboratory. Does anyone see the force field? Ah, yes, Ms.Dr C and a few others. I'm glad you noticed it. We always use it. You will also notice the windows are slightly tainted with a special vacuum-deposited thin film.

This year is Chicago, maybe because of famous Pizza Italiana or Mexican food, yes? Very clever, ya? (General laughter and jokes) Ladies and gentlemen, you all have been following the technological developments via our monthly private Ordus Charta communication, but let me discuss items that we could not discuss at the time that are of foremost importance to us, especially in the light of what Dr. A said in his introduction in regards for the 1995 world events. Besides the pizza, we met here because of Dr. N's crucial plans for the Order, and also because some of us wanted to visit and sniff around (laughter) with some fiiends at Batavia, Argonne and U of C\" , totally unofficially, of course. As Dr. A indicated, we may not be able to do so leisurely in the future. It seems Chicago is a time bomb just waiting . . . To begin, the Clementine moon mission revealed most unusual info, which was promptly censored by NASA., but, as always, the news leaked out. Those gigantic crystal structures, a couple of hundred meters tall, are none other than Gravitational Landau Wave Transducers. I'm sure our Soviet colleagues agree on that. Since, as un-romantic as it may sound, the moon is not a true satellite of Earth, but merely a highly sophisticated spacecraft, built of steel and titanium, it was concluded that it was placed there as a gravitational stabilizer for Earth. By whom? Obviously by a pre-eminent and extremely advanced civilisation. It is obvious that there is atmosphere in there, because of the dust, the undulations in the flags (suggesting wind), the footprints, and the EM/IR spectra, which reveals molecular vibrations of oxygen, nitrogen and carbonic anhydride (carbon dioxide). Landau waves are quantum mechanical relativistic phenomena related to gravitational pressure, in its most general, simple foxmulation. What is most interesting is that crystalline structures can be, probably are, electromagnetic gravitational transducers (EMGT) that most likely stabilize the wobble and Chandler nutations of the Earth. Ya. I think that the crystals were synthetically grown, and are most likely silicium di-oxid, or quartz. This has tremendous implications in the use of synthetic crystals as gravitational and anti-gravitational EMGT. Therein, ladies and gentlemen, lies the secret of antigravity. In crystals! That is why most \"UFOs\" have fined- tuned crystals as their critical EMGT in addition to their magnetic motors. Maybe, some craft only use crystals as motors. Klatu Barada Nikto? We wonder how Richard Hoagland is going to handle this one. He is playing a very low profile lately. Wonder why ... Please bear this in mind. Crystals and sound may be a simple way to create antigravity in the lab bench. Of course, this also links crystals to scalar waves, soliton waves, takyon waves and technology thereof Remember this, ya? Maybe the New Age belief in crystals as \"good luck charms\" and \"cosmic energy condensers\" may not be too far off IS University of Chicago. 608"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Now, let's talk about electronic surveillance technologv. You all saw or read \"Mark fiom Michigan's\" video/info16. Well, in Germany, Israel and the CCCP, new technology has developed that now with microcrystal transceivers you can listen to anyone, anywhere in the world. Example, you drop the microcrystal in the Piazza di San Pietro and you can hear any conversation of the Roman Curia, the Pope or the servants in their quarters while sitting at a monitor in Sidney! Can anyone locate the microcrystal transceiver? No! Only the one who placed it -- if he remembers exactly where! It is practically impossible to track or find its location, for its signals go to a satellite first! The Israelites are the inventors of this gem, and it only works on one single frequency, but not in the Hertzian EM spectrum. Solitonic Scalars! The Amerikaners NRONSA have a similar, but bulkier transceiver for video surveillance, about 5mm wide. It is rumored that every house will have one of these for absolute video surveillance. For audio, the ordinary telephone does a 24 hour surveillance on anyone while on the hook, its normal position. Taps are past history. Also, there is a function in all TV's that can be turned on remotely if a King or a President needs to address the country in an emergency.'' There are also eavesdropping surveillance hctions even zf the TV is disconnected and un~hmd fiom the AC socket. Ladies and gentlemen, they have not missed one single small detail, and all of this was planned in the 1950 's and 1960 's! Next, the surveillance of currency. cash. gold and silver bullion/coins is truly masterful! Many countries, like Germany and England, have a metallic strip on the notes that is easy to locate. Removing it renders the note valueless. However, in Amerika, since there has been worldwide counterfeiting of US dollars, the method is now different. They have inserted a coded strip of platinum-mylar composite in situ. All denominations have that now. Where do people put their money in their homes? In their steel safes, right? So, a \"seeing eye\" was developed to \"see\" what is inside steel walls. An x-ray laser micropulse, which diverges to about 90cm (36in), is sent to locate the safe. Then a narrower beam is sent where the safe is and the \"read density\" function is activated. Thus, the modulated beam can read the density of coded strips and kn6w how many $100s, $50s, $20s, gold bars, silver coins, etc., you have in your safe. If you don't have a safe, and you hide your money \"under the mattress\" or elsewhere, it is even easier to locate. Since all this technology involves phase conjugation non-linear electromagnetics, all of this takes place in about one to three minutes fiom a vdauto parked 1000 feet fiom your house! Phase conjugation means that the wave you send is self-referencing and returns immediately almost at the speed of light. Obviously, they wanted to use this technology for the IRS boys, but only the NRONSAfCIA have exclusivity to this amazing technology. The same thing can be done fiom a helicopter. Some of these machines are l6 See Leading Edge #64.

If they locate lead boxes/containers, they know you are trying to hide something. So? They can have IRS officers come unexpectedly and force you to open your safe and impound your funds. Worse yet, they can come a open your safe easily, or even steal it. Remember, they are highly skilled super-technological professionals. And they are extremely intelligent. They are not called \"intelligence agencies\" in vain! This is how they secretly locate, raid and rob the drug lords. They are the intelligence \"robin hoods\". They do steal fiom crooks and keep it for their own agencies. They are masters at this. You'll never hear this on the news, and no crooks or Mafioso is going to report it to the police, ya?

The average Hans Smith is not their target - only people they suspect or know they have lots of cask stashed away. I think there is a new law in Amerika that says you can't have more than $3,000 cash, or something like that.'' Other countries are also instituting similar laws. Check and see how much is allowed.

Can they take children's money too? Dr G: Well ... I don't think they would steal piggy banks, but the IRS might !(laughter again). You see, Dr. C, it is the adults they want to control absolutely. Children then are naturally controlled by proxy. But, interesting point, many professionals and adults have \"dropped out\" of the system. Some are radicals, others are religious fbndamentalists, others paramilitary rebels, terrorists, or simply just patriotic citizens - patriots! If you drop out of the banking system, the best way to \"hide your cash\", or gold bullion, since so many people invest in gold, the thing to do is (a) rent a safety box in a bank and (b) don't hide your money in your apartment or house if you live in as big city, or any city. You can't hide it there anywhere! Move to the suburbs or the country. Here we have to borrow the lore of Ancient Magicians and blend it with high-tech -- Babylonian style!

In Washington State, in Clark County, Vancouver, the satellite spotted about 58,000 septic tanks that were defective or leaking, and this info was promptly related to the County Health officials for their use.lg In other words, ladies and gentlemen, now we have heavenly Federal spying via satellites at state and county levels. This is the next form of control and enforcement of the ridiculous and outrageous ordinances being passed all over the country and the county level. The aerial infiaredfthermal topographic and depth scans/photos can also monitor and detect underground sewer hnctions and provide a precise record on a monthly basis, which includes not only the cities but the countryside as well. So, you can't get away from the government agencies even if you live in the forests! Lo and behold! No matter where you are, you will be required to buy a permit even if you are building a dog house, for with their satellite monitors, they can spot and construction change within feet, even inches of resolution! 1984 again? Oregon is now being monitored as well. For some reason, the Pacific Northwest is the testing ground for satellite surveillance operations. It could be because of the tactical importance of Fort ~ewis~' and the nuclear submarine base. In the midwest, near Chicago, the deserted Great Lakes U.S. Navy base, capable of housing an entire mid-size city, has been reportedly prepared as a future \"concentration camp\" with eight foot fences with the barbed wire facing in! Officially, but secretly, Chicago is already under martial law, as was announced by \"Mark from Michigan\" last year. Other abandoned military bases in the country are secretly being refiubished for similar \"emergency uses\" in the future. As an afterthought, you all remember the 1993 video \"Montauk Revisited\"? Well, mister Preston was right! There is a new electrical wiring coded 1990 in the base, and definite activity in the underground levels 80 feet below. It was checked by Dr. E that visited the spot with his \"wife\" and \"baby\" equipped with sensitive seismographic equipment in the carriage. How creative we are getting, no?

The IBM PC is a different story, and that has to do with Intel microchips and a scenario that cannot be discussed in this format. As for TV interference, that has to do with the HAARP\" boys. To conclude, remember the great emphasis on Opto-electronics and Photonics in the past few years by AT&T and the Ma Bell boys? Well, with fiber optic cables operating today, the 1.5 to 2 inch cross-section contains many thousands of optic fibers as thin as a human hair, each capable of carrying thousands of phone conversations simultaneously. It is now being proposed by the same boys that allphones, computers, TV's, electronic mail and satellite communications be conducted through these fiber optics via telephone cables. Wonderfbl idea that will save millions, right? Wrong! Why? Because today all telephone conversations are monitored and routed through AT&TYs Boulder, Colorado headquarters. But, what else do we know that is in Boulder? The FCC and NBS'~, that with AT&T form the Unholy Trinity! There it is, the diabolical plan: absolute electronic monitoring and control of the entire worlds communications by AT&T and the ~o~s~~ Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! Anyway, so much for surveillance technology. In closing, I just want to remind you ,that it is imperative that you remember that the greatest intruder to your privacy is the telephone and the TV, and to a lesser extent, the radio. Last year we 'discussed the effects of telephone electronics on the brain and the danger of answering machines. This continues to be a first class danger and intrusion on the brain, psyche and spirit of a human being. Every time you make a phone call, AT&T benefits fiom it, and in essence what you are doing is that you, the public, are paying for your own electronic mind control and brain stagnation by using the phone system! As you all know and have been asked by the Order 'l During the week of December 11,1994, reports of massive failures of IBM Pentium series 486, 586 and some 686 computers have been reported around the country. These have only been on the market for two years. Consequently, Intel stock plunged. '' Electromagnetic interference @MI).

It's not by accident."},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO not to do, we use phones minimally, and with specially constructed electronic filters and protective force fields around the phones. We never use answering machines or fax machines2' for many reasons, but especially to prevent spying by the Boulder, Colorado Boys! Dr K: What are the specific dangers of phones and TV's to the brain, psyche and spirit? Is 50 Hz AC any worse? Dr G: Mein Seele! What a question! The pulsing electromagnetic fields, combined with the static magnetic field from the powerfbl cobalt-samarium magnets in the earpiece (auricular transducer) affect the thalamus, hypothalamus, pineal, pituitary and amygdala directly. It somehow slows down the neurotransmitter chemistry or rapidity of thinking processes. Surveys show that most people hold the telephone receiver on the right ear, so the fields focus on the right brain2*, the intuitive, psychic processor. The phone is so close to the diencephalon area, it does flood these delicate organs with the EMF and sonic fields from the electronic circuits. It was also discovered that acoustical harmonics with coded information were being sent through the dial tone and background hissing present at all times in telephone circuitry. It is possible that electronic programming is being used via the telephones. As for TV, by now all transmissions, especially in Amerika, contain subliminal information, both optically, acoustically and electronically via electronic signal compression - the mysterious \"black line\" every 34 frames or so.29 Videos, including cartoons for children, are intended to numb the brain, and suppress spiritual inquiry.30 These were precise protocols that were instituted in the 1950's under Project Silent Weapons Technology (SWT). It has been conclusively proven by our research and Soviet research that certain colour frequencies combined with sound affect the neurotransmitters in the brain.31 The pulses, intensities and modulations are the key. The Soviets have used this superlatively in their LIDA machines. American police use the red-blue pulsating flashing lights to induce (a feeling of) intimidation and fear.32 There is a lot more to this, but this is enough. Ah, ya! Certain European and Asian countries use 50 Hz instead of 60 Hz. This is not as \"bad*, because 60 Hz AC contains a'fi.epencv that is a precise 27 Copies of every fax and telephone call are accessible by the government through the Boulder, Colorado complex. Local phone companies also typically maintain recordings of every conversation you have for a minimum of two weeks after they are made. 28 Presumably, cellular telephones also make use of these effects See Matrix III V1. 29 Reference buzzsaw signals in Matrix III V1 and Leading Edge #77 Dec 1994. 30 Seemingly analogous is the use of fluorides in public drinking water to promote compliancy and create a situation where people become afraid to challenge authority. 31 Notice how people are falling so hard for light-sound technology, despite the FDA pretense of raiding one establishment in Washington State. The action simply made more people buy the units. It's all a psychological game. Are you playing it? 32 Actually, one could carry the discussion on the use of red and blue lights by the police as a ''restimulation of implants\", genetic or otherwise, based on some of the early work of Hubbard, where people and their implant history were traced back over extremely long periods of time. The sighting of flashing light inculcation bars by those abducted over the last 20 years also reflects the use of this technology.

Should we use no phones, watch no TV, don't go to the cinema, or listen to the radio? Dr G: Ya! Absolutely! Just become telepathic! You see, I understand the situation of those with families and kinder (children). Since all of you are scientists and initiates, you must use your knowledge to outsmart the system. Most of us now use short wave radio, for, surprisingly enough, it is seldom monitored any more. The emphasis of surveillance and control today is in TV, computers and electronic mail. A bit of trivia - did you know that the U.S.Congress does not use electronic mail and computerised communications? They still use the old IBM Selectric typewriters. Same with many other governments in the world. They don't want surveillance! Have you noticed the advertising campaign for Grundig shortwave mini radios? That is telltale! Short wave communication is widely used in AM late and early morning talk shows worldwide. That is how we obtain unusual info. We also have our own codes for communication. To close, just minimise your phone usage. When you want to talk and want privacy, unplug the phones and your TV! If you suspect intrusion fiom the TV screen, cover it with aluminum foil! That should do the trick! Finally, I want to categorically state that the same phenomena occurs with computer screens --VDT's. However, this is a much more involved scenario that can't be discussed in this format.33 Just remember that Dr. N has asked all of us not to use computers with VDT screens any more. Please abide by that dictum. It is of categorical importance and urgency. Unless you have specific protection, don't use VDT computers. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Dr B: I say, did you study at Oxford? You have a slight Oxfordian intonation.. . Mrs.Dr.L: Yes, I did study in Oxford, but not medicine, but physics under the eminent Professor Roger Penrose. My accent is probably Beijing-Oxfordian and my German, only God knows! (general laughter and applause). Let me begin By first mentioning to you that the American Medical Association (AMA) and the FDA have started a strong and secret campaign to eliminate Oriental type of medicines in the US; many Chinese doctors and acupuncturists in this country are being harassed and their precious herbs confiscated, but you don't hear this in the news. You also hear that they made Germanium, Gerovital GH3 and Melatonin capsules \"illegal\", and withdrew them fiom the market. Many distributors were raided. Next on their list is SOD and various herbs and natural remedies. This is alarming indeed, because England and France are very permissive of alternative medicines, but the US is paranoic about it. My American contacts inform me that Kessler, the new FDA boss who cracked down on the tobacco industries, is the one tactician chosen for gaining public confidence and then imposing horrendous regulations to \"protect the American public\".34 Do keep an eye on him. He is not to be trusted. His real boss is not in Washington, but in New ~ork.~~ I visited various \"Chinatowns\" this year, and confinned fiom Chinese nationals that they had difficulty getting their shipments of herbs fiom Hong Kong, Taipei, Taiwan and China. Natural remedies are in shortage in all US \"Chinatowns. \" Let me begin with a discussion of the most novel brain research tools available today. I will go quickly through the ones already known, but discuss in detail the most important one today. May I have the first slide, please? ( slides are shown ). As you have seen, those (brain research tools) are standard Computer Aided Tomography (CAT or CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Positron Emission Computerised Tomography (SPECT) and, of course, the usual EEG. Unfortunately, all of these techniques are intrusive and potentially dangerous, because the intense magnetic fields focused on the brain to create \"positron excitation emission7' are merely exciting or intruding upon the hydrogen atoms of your brain, which is 95% water! It has been reported that people that undergo CT,PET,SPECT and similar intrusive techniques see light flashes, coloured lights, hear voices, and even see visions.36 Some even have Kessler was quoted as saying, \"the FDA is the arbiter of tmth. The American public does not have the knowledge to choose health care Trust us.\" 35 The Rockefeller Medical complex is headquartered in New York. There has not been one FDA administrator who has not had a conflict of interest with the medical and pharmaceutical industries.

Also important is Walter Bowart's new researchers edition of"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO nightmares many nights thereafter. It is understandable that the very processes attending brain functions may be affected this way, for no one has done any research on the long term or even the short term aftereffects of these techniques. Most likely, they have not been reported. I say, if your hydrogen atoms are intruded upon by kilogausses of pulsating magnetic fields, it is going to affect the neural networks and brain functions somehow -- not to mention the hypefinctions not known or acknowledged by orthodox medical science! Even in China today there is controversy about these Western medical diagnostics. Some Chinese doctors are in favour of it, but most nationals won't even go close to these \"demons\". My personal experience with it is that they definitely affect the flow of Chi -- it creates vortical flow. Now we come to my favorite tool, Magnetic Electroencephalography or MEG. This is absolutely non-invasive and non-intrusive. It uses a superconducting quantum interfering device, or \"SQUID, and its main characteristic is that it is extremely expensive! (Laughter) Yes, indeed, millions of pounds Sterling! But more importantly, it provides precisely updated, per millisecond intervals, information from brain processes in real time, so precise measurements can be made in situ for quantitative computations. This is truly an asset for theoreticians lie myself and others in this audience. Unlike EEG, which has many artifacts and errors to contend with (hence no precise quantitative measurements), with MEG we can compute microsecond, microvolt and microamp events accurately. The only precaution needed is that the rooms that house these instruments must be absolutely insulated from external fields, and compensations for the Earth's own geomagnetic field are more accurately and easily done. Both tools, EEG and MEG, can be used complementarily to do precise observations, cum quantisation, of subtle cerebral processes and hctions, non- intrusively, by recording the electricallmagnetic impulses produced by certain neurons in the cerebral cortex. Recall that EEG was mostly a diagnostic tool to monitor cortical electrical activity - the exo-cortical behavior. But, nothing could be studied about the endocortex, midbrain and central brain electridmagnetic phenomena - until now. The EEG senses electrical voltageslpotentials only. MEG is ultrasensitive to magnetic fields only. Since electric fields are orthogonal (at 90') to the magnetic field vectors, per standard theory, EEG records both radial and tangential components of any given brain signal. That is why EG needs about 126 electrodes/channels to map all regions of the exocortex. However, EEG emphasizes the radial component. MEG ignores the radial and records only tangential components. This means it can pick up the fissures and folds of the brain, a feature impossible to the EEG. The MEG, on the other hand, uses a helmet housing the SQUID sensors, accurately positioned over the head using precise topological reference points. Eggheads and Hotheads are most difficult to analyse! The information outputs of the MEG can be precisely monitored, recorded, analysed, and stored on magnetic tape for Wre \"Operation Mind Control\", availabie from Flatland, P.O.

DrM: . ::n this magnetic information fiom the brain be obtained fiom afar, that is, by remote control? Mrs.Dr.L: Yes it can, but with different sensors. I think our Russian colleagues can answer that more precisely. Do you care to answer that, Dr Z? Dr 2: Nyet. Not now. Thank you. Mrs.Dr.L: Let me continue, then. Precise positioning of the SQUID sensors can be accomplished both metrologically or sonically using a small acoustic probe. Once this is done, the neuromagnetometry (NMM) can be commenced. But, what is the practical use of NMM? Well, two main areas of research. Spontaneous brain activity (SBA), such as breathing, heartbeat, coughing, scratching, nose picking (laughter) and most autonomic hctions, including some natural reflexes. The second function is evoked response ~ulses (ERP), similar to the evoked response potentials (ERP) of EEG, such as the telltale, \"electronic truth serum\" P300, P200, etc., pioneered by our Russian fiends. Let me illustrate one of the outstanding findings with this technique by Professors Kaufinan and Williamson of New York University. Subjects were shown various visual imagery composites and their MEG outputs updated in millisecond intervals. Then, subjects were blindfolded and asked to rhyme words - in other words, analytical thinking was induced. Amazingly, in both cases a pronounced suppression of alpha waves was noticed. The supression continues for three intervals of 500, 100 and 700 ms, respectively. These cycles correspond to visualization of the word, gleaning its meaning, and searching the \"memory bank\" for a similar sounding word, The implications are obvious. When we are assailed by rich visual imagery, profise levels of Beta waves are produced, Alphas are suppressed, because of extreme stimulation to the visual cortex. Furthermore, stimulation to the visual cortex is suppressed by blindfolds, and profise alphas ensue. However, if the subject starts thinking, then the Alphas are suppressed, and you are back in Beta. Perhaps that is why thinking, while a left brain function, ruins intuition, which is a right brain function. This is particularly noticeable in the martial arts. The great Chinese and Japanese masters always say, \"Tai- Chi and Kata is Pure Intuition and Feeling. Thinking ruins the flow!\" The great Japanese Aikido grandmaster Morihei Uyeshiba yelled to his students, \"Don't think, just do it!\" '' Translational Fourier-based recordings of thought patterns are also a fact, because such patterns are transmitted on a regular basis to restimulate aberrant behavior patterns in mass population to provide a rationale for control and domination - dl this in the realm of electronic mind and behavior control.

'' This factor can provide for remote surveillance of a body emitting the specific signature, or the resonant transmission of frequencies producing pathogenic reaction in that body, in order to produce disease or death - conversely, the process can be used to augment biological health, perhaps to ovemde long-term resonant signatures produced by electromagnetics, contrary to those who promote Dasein ohne Leben."},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO A few years ago, researchers in Vienna did a comprehensive mapping of the functional organisation of the motor cortex, and found characteristic, yet distinctly reproducible micromametic_fiel& that preceded voluntarv activifv by 3 0-50 milliseconds. In other words, they measured the intent before the action was executed -- precisely. I got a copy of all their data and did preliminary calculations and found, just as the eminent Dr. Robert E. Becker had predicted, information traveled close to the speed of light while the intent was reaistered. The motor cortex process and muscular movement occurred at the usual ionic-transport slow speed. Therefore, it has been quantitatively and unequivocally proven that intent is a luminalvrocess that bmses the ordinary neural networks of the brain. New mechanisms are needed to explain what precedes the evoked action potentials. No one has proposed any mechanisms to explain intent signaling in the neuroscience community - no one yet.

You see, it is not really the AMA and FDA alliance behind this last outrageous plan, but this comes straight fiom the National Reconnaissance Organization (NRO), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) headquarters, and it is linked to satellite electronic surveillance protocols.40 41 Anyone in a state of profound, self-induced trance or altered state of consciousness will not respond to their own subliminal programming and mind control protocols.42 That constitutes \"loss of control\", and that they cannot tolerate.43 So, since, per New Age fads, most people rely on external device? to attain altered states of consciousness, then the logical thing to do is eliminate these devices fiom the market completely.45 On the other hand, individuals using drugs to attain altered states of consciousness are literally \"sitting ducks\" for immediate control46, because their brains have already been chemically prepared with special \"additives\" introduced on all drugs4' by the very process of \"refining\" these drugs for public consumption world wide. This was the very basis of the earlier MKULTRA project, using drugs. Later, this became refined to MKDELTA, Delta here meaning sleep brainwave cycle and, finally, the electronic protocols of today4', including Woodpecker, Buzzsaw, videodrome4' and \"holy signals\".

That also affects Chinese practice, because the diagnostic method using the three pulses has always been regarded by the AMA as \"highly suspect of quackery\". Also, I may add that my research has proven absolutely with the Mega Arkons and Dr. N have been emphatically telling is - that profound states of altered consciousness that are self-induced by the techniques taught to us in the Order, and also transcendental meditation, Zen meditation, Taoist Golden Flower meditation, and Flower of Life Merkaba meditation, do make an individual immune to external subliminal programming. Unfortunately, only great masters and advanced Yogis are able to resist the electronic mind control intrusions using scalar wave technology. Our only protection against that powerfbl intrusion is equally strong Scalar, Solitonic and Takyonic force fields.50 And that we can easily do with our own available technology. Other folks worldwide are less fortunate -- unfortunately! Let me continue. I already discussed the importance of the magnetic component of brain activity in studying and monitoring brain processes and functions accurately and precisely. Further research by our Russian colleagues has also shown that with proper parallel computing algorithms, one can plot three-dimensionally the magnetic field configuration and spatio-temporal time-varying fields of the midbrain's thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, pituitary and pineal functions in real time! This is unprecedented, because it shows that, as we all here have learned in our Hermetic Gnostic Order's teachings, the so-called \"Cave of Brahma\", Dr. N's favourite \"hang-out\" (laughter), is indeed the magnetic and acoustic resonance chamber, its shape being a topological complex analogue of an ellipsoi&l, prolate spheroid and a torus. In American lingo, I think that is called, a doughnut inside an egg? (Laughter) May I have the cine film strip please? Thank you. (Short film showing computer graphics is shown). This shows a real-time plot of the nested magnetic fields around my own head. This piece of research was a little favour fiom a British colleague that likes to work nights. They call it the \"Dracula Shifl\" (laughter). The white lines of the overall contour, the green the Hypothalamus plus Thalamus field, the red the Hippocampus plus Arnygdala cycloid-shaped field (semi-circular), and the dumb-bell shaped blue is the Epyphisis (Pineal) and Hypophysis (Pituitary) combined fields. I wrote this algorithm myself with the help of Professor Penrose -- another unofficial favour -- to map the magnetic fields using both the SQUID sensor helmets and a special helmet designed by Dr. Z having Delta-T and Delta-Wye transforms, having specially designed magnetic coils and sensors. This way we could pick up Pico and Nanogauss fields (billionth of a Gauss). The combined information is displayed here in three-dimensional coloured graphics. Notice the external white-lied shape is like an egg. Inside, almost at the centre, is the toroidal shape of the Hippocampus-Amygdala combined fields, the red contours. The central tube-like \"sausage with trumpet-like open ends7' looks like what? Anyone?

Notice that these amazing geometries are the synergistic eeffect of the magnetic fields of these six organs surrounded by the ventricles, under the roof of the choroidplexus and corpus callosum. Notice what happens if I subtract the field of even a single organ, let's say the pineal gland. See how it changes the entire structure?\" And, if1 add the contribution of the marnillary body, it only widens the tube, right? And if we add the field from the reticular formation, the master circuit network, relay and switchboard of the brain where all waves are originated, what do we get? Next frame, please? We get a tunnel merging with the main ellipsoidaljield. In the screen, it is the orange coloured grid. To summarize, what is our Mid-Brain or Inner Cavity? It is a relativistic spatio- temporal cavity with local enfolded hyperspatial bridges that undergoes harmonic resonances to magnetic and acoustical stimuli. The implications are almost astronomical, if I may use the term, because a model and mechanism based on this novel scientific information implies that our human brain is in reality none other than a biolopical mace- time enera, transducer. As such, it creates not only space, but also time. Our ancient Chinese ancestors maintained that \"the Tao was in our head\", in other words, all the Universe was in our head! My own inference from this study is that space and time are essentially biologically modulated, perhaps even formulated, for my equations show that possibility. Should this intuitive scientific insight be correct, then it would demolish physics, biology, philosophy and theology in a single, clean blow. Incidentally, I showed this filmstrip and discussed my theory and equations with Professor Penrose, who seemed interested at first, but very politely declined any mher Of course, by injecting enough disabling co-factors into the environment, the power structure is making sure that the public does not have access to burgeoning psychic abiities and telepathic interchange. They'd rather you use your cellular phone."},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO comment or association with me thereafter.52 I think he realised the impact of this novel theory. He is still convinced that quantum mechanics is the answer to explain brain functions and consciousness. I disagree. I think it is General Relativity and Unified Field a la Einstein, pure and simple. Quantum phenomena is not the cause, but merely the effect, and creation is not statistical. It is wholeheartedly deterministic, not left to chance, but to precisely formulated potentials, not fields. The potentials are the cause, the fields are the effects. In simple terms, pure magnetism and sound are the potentials. Electricity is the field. Magnetism and sound do not \"travel\" as such, for they are inherently enfolded in space and are everywhere. It is the disturbance that travels. On the other hand, electrical charge, hence electricity, does travel, because it needs a physical medium. It is obvious that we still don't understand either magnetism or the true nature of sound. To close, I would like to just mention experiments being done combining the novel science of sonochernistrv and neurophvsics. Amazing altered states of consciousness have been attained by some privately fbnded researchers using sound and light, a combination of physics and Yoga. From stereochemistry, the precise molecular structure of certain alkaloids have been obtained, and their vibrational isomorphic hdamental vibrational frequencies determined. Example: Ammonia, W, molecules vibrate at 40,000 cps. LSD vibrates at about 11,000 cps. A tone was obtained from this vibrating molecule, and a large poster of its molecular structure was made. By focusing on the chemical formula on the poster and playing the sound hannonic/tone of the LSD molecule, a fabulous psychedelic trance was experienced by eight volunteers, men and women. No side effects, unpleasant emotions or after effects were experienced. The subjects remained in the Theta brainwave through the entire three hour experience. Many OOBE, time travel, and \"clairsenses\" experiences were reported and monitored. The experiment was repeated at other times with close controls, and similar experiences were reported. The information from these experiments was truly, truly amazing, fabulous, fantastic -- to put it mildly. The psychokinetic and telekinetic feats were, I think, unparalleled in the history of parapsychological research. A new biochemistry and pharmacology can emerge from this study. I have passed this information to our Russian colleagues for future study, for it is their specialty -- paraphysics and biological radio. Ironically, the CIA and KGB are familiar with two alkaloid substances known as telepathine and astraline. The former is in the chemistry handbook, the latter is new. Interesting names! Thank you my fiiends. (Standing applause). Dr D: Thank you Mrs. Dr. L for a superbly informative presentation. It is almost mind- boggling for us non-medical type to understand the intricacies of the brain. Obviously, your research is light years ahead of the orthodoxy. Any questions before we move on to the next speaker? Yes, Dr. A? a Which lends itself to the notion that any scientist who is employed, on tenure or steeped in academia, cannot truly function as a scientist, since truth and revelation does destroy structure and provide novelty - the average scientist, afraid of losing funding and afraid of professional censure, cannot publically ackowledge any degree of developmental truth which would collapse a set of major paradigms upon which employment depends. After all, Penrose doesn't want to be a Sheldrake, does he?"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Dr. A: Please explain how the cerebral magnetic fields of the mid-brain change as a hnction of ASC's, altered states? Mrs.Dr.L: Ah, so. Very good. What my associates and I did is to go into various trance states induced by the techniques that we all know here (A) Dee~ ZenITaoist meditation, absolute stillness, (B) Tai-Chi moving meditation, and (C) Tantra Toga Cobra Breathing - pulsed powefil breath, Yoga Asana (lotus posture). I was the subject tested. In (A), all metabolic processes cum homeostasis are slowed down pronouncedly. The brain emitted EEG peaks in the Alpha-Theta range (1 1,9,7, and 5 cps, at the lowest). Great Masters can descend all the way into Delta, 0.1- 4cps. he amplitudes varied between 60 and 275 microvolts, root mean square averages. The magnetic fields were actually at a maximum, especially when eyes were closed, ranging fiom about 9.5 to 48.5 Picogauss (lo-' gauss). The diagrams you saw in the cine film were made with measurements of this part (A). In (B), the metabolic processes are increased, but homeostasis is optimised. Brainwaves are almost totally Alpha, but some Beta spikes were observed. Again, a Great Tai-Chi Master would be totally in Alpha, maybe even some Theta. The magnetic fields were somewhat elongated in the Y-axis, meaning the length of the space-time tube. This meant that space-time hnctions are altered when doing Tai-Chi correctly. It is said in Chinese lore that Tai-Chi Masters can arrest, even reverse their aging process, and cause local distortions of space-time, hence their ability to literally propel opponents \"flying through the air\", 12 feet into the air, like the legendary master in the remote Changu province. Somehow, magnetism and Chi are related, and are controlled by the brain via intent and breath. In (C), the brainwaves are almost totally composed of very unusual spikes that could be Alpha or Beta. The magnetic fields were pulsating, or oscillating, which means some non-linear DC pulses created expansion and contraction of'the magnetic field. Curiously, it appeared as if it became alive and began to \"breathe\", and the pulse was about 6 to 8 cycles per second. My interpretation is that here space-time is being pulsed, and time is being accelerated, but externally, not internally. In other words, the outside time-flow seems to be going faster. Any other questions? Yes, Ms Dr. J? Ms.Dr.J: What is the best way to optimise one's own brain functions, especially in adults like us? Also, I understand you're a grandmother and won't reveal your age. To me, you look like you are about 22 years old! What's your secret? Mrs.Dr.L: Thank you for the complement. My answer to that is to be like a child, laugh a lot - and this group are all clowns, especially those loud Russians, back there (great laughter and cheers), and eat Chinese food, especially vegetables, eggs, and a lot of sea weed. Also, I practice Tai-Chi and Chi-Kung every day. In China, we walk many kilometers every day. Now, as for brain functions, as Dr. N said, do not watch TV or movies, don't use computers or telephones, and practice your Yoga and"},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO visualizationlimagination exercises daily. Study of Sacred ~eometry~~is the best stimulation for the brain, for the Sacred Forms, angles and diagrams have their space-time analogues in the Mind, Soul and Spirit. You saw how the brain forms Sacred Geometry magnetic field patterns in our film. That is very significant. Some Hermetic Gnostics of early Christianity thought that Angels derived from Angles. You see? Finally, never, never, never smoke cigarettes or take drugs. That damages the Thymus and Pituitary, and causes premature aging. Also, don't drink coffee - it interferes via purines in brain neurotransmitters. Drink tea. Dr R: Will you explain how movies, TV, TV screens, computer VDTs and , I suppose, all VDTs in scientific equipment affect the brain, and I understand, the chromosomes, DNA and genes as well? Mrs.Dr.L: That is a tremendous question! The effect on DNA, chromosomes and genes has been discussed in the open scientific literature, but it is quite controversial. I believe Dr. D has most of the papers and references in our technical files, so you can secure copies of those. I will summarise this way. It seems that the EMF from the VDT does interact and interfere with brain functions by entrainment of the 60 Hz AC of commercial electricity. In other words, the synergy between the Reticular Formation and the Thalamus is responsible for the Alpha spikes that indicate that during a normal day, the brain takes a \"dip\" into Alpha 30 times per minute while you are awake. Nobody knows why this is so, but I think it has to do with replenishment of Vital Force - Chi - and a balance between the rational and intuitive functions. Entrain-ment prevents that, for it keeps you all the time ar 60 or 50 Hz. Movies and videos contain not only decadent material, but also subliminals and encoded secret information. There is another more noxious scenario that I am not at liberty to discuss. I have to clear that with Dr. N. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes my presentation for today. See you at dinnertime. (Applause) Day Two- Dr. A: Good morrow, ladies and gentlemen!

I wish to inform you that you were all a part of an experiment yesterday. (Laughter) Dr.2: You call this Amerikanish hospitalishe? In CCCP only experiment is to see how much vodka you drink. That also gives great dreams! (wild laughter and raucous comments) Ms.Dr.C: I am glad we have such a live group of scientists here. Laughter is our greatest cathartic, as you all know. I just hope that was not a nervous laugh! ( more laughter) The reason what this is so important is that unbeknownst to you, we run a \"double blind\" experiment yesterday to do in vivo research. This is perfect time and group for that. I am one of the three researchers involved in this brain wave research. The other researcher is back in England, and is not part of this group. Only Mrs.Dr.L and I knew about this experiment. We will discuss that later. Now, I wish to have the lights and projector ready. Thank you, Dr. B. I wish to start with a discussion of the revolutionary research of Herr Professor Doktor Tomas Landh, a biophysicist and bio-materials scientist. He has advanced a new theory based on solid evidence that conflicts meatlv with current views on cell morpholom, especially neuronal brain cells. Current theory is based on two-dimensional models of thin microtome sections of cells viewed under optical or transmission microscopy, which states that \"the cell's membrane is a spherical double layer of fatty lipids having their liophobic ends pointing inward, and liophyllicS4 ends pointing outwards with protein structures at either surface or squeezing through the membrane. Show the first slide. Next slide. You see here, this shows the protoplasm in center and looks like round circles, ya? Doktor Landh is not arguing cell function, but more the structural topology of its true geometry. Mer reviewing thousands of published fotos in histology literature for the past 35 years, he is convinced the current view is incorrect. What he did, is use transmission electron microscopy (TEM), but scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with very special dry-fieeze techniques to preserve actual cell morphology without preparation artifacts. He then performed a mathematical topological analysis (MTA) to correlate hypothesis with observations, and found that cells, far fiom Sl Commonly, \"hydrophobic\" and \"bydrophyllic*, water-hating and water loving, respectively. 625"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO being spherical 3-D little balls, ya?, were in reality very complex 3-0 aggregates following aprecise topological law known as Periodic Minimal Surface (PMS), not to be confbsed with female PMS, ya? ( roaring laughter ) I will skip the details, but Doktor Landh has postulated that the actual cell morvholoav and cell continuum is not a random svherical confiauration, but a vrecise crvstalline awepate of cubic-shaped cells whose membranes show a six-fold svmmetnt! Traces of the Egyptian Flower of Life symmetry, maybe, ya?55 Furthermore, the cvtoskeleton or vrotein skeleton of the cell grows in a spiral pattern. vent similar to DNALUNA peometq. I wish to have the next five slides, Dr. B. You see how the cell growsfrom a two-dimensional circle to a cubic aggregate ifyou apply the rules of topology, ya? You see also the repeatingpattem, like a crystal, ya? This cubic shape is probably dictated by hnctional cellular requirements, and determines the actual cell behavior. Finally, his last phenomenal discovery was that, as a materials scientist - like the Amerikan Dr. William Tiller - he was very familiar with metallic and metalloid microstructure. When he saw the high-angle SEM's at low resolution and high angle, he noticed the pattern resembled what material scientists call a photonic cystal, a lattice structure of atoms or molecules that is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation, or mt, ya? So he realised, of course! That explains the work of Herr Doktor Popp from switzerlandS6 and his photon cell experiments. In other words, the cells are morphologically arranged like a PMS structure that maximises its surface per unit volume for absorption of energy. It _follows, therefore, that cells. eveciallv neuronal cerebral cells. are crvstalline electromagnetic transchrcers - in other words, they respond to light, ya?57 That explains why not only exodermal (skin) cells, but deep endodermal cells, including (those in) the pineal gland, are sensitive to light. The current view maintains that light photons do not affect metabolism. Doktor Landh's research contradicts that, and categorically shows how cells are structurally and morphologicaly equipped to act as light transducers, ya? That is the conclusion of our own research. ( standing ovation and applause ) Ms Dr. C: Dankershen. Thank you, respected colleagues. You know, we may just be a biological black hole! ( more laughter) Now, let me go into the second topic of my talk. I wish for the lights, please. Thank you., Dr. B. This topic of brain research verges almost on paraphysics, the favourite topic of our CCCP colleagues. ( cheers) A Polish researcher, Dr. Richard Cytowic, has been researching an unusual phenomenon known as gmesthesia, a condition where one sense overlaps with another, such as \"tasting colours\", \"smelling colours\", \"tasting words\", \"feeling sensations and emotions in vivid colours\", such as sexual orgasms (loud laughter). Background question - how can we do that? ( more laughter) \" See Matrix IV for further information and explanation. ss Editor Note: Dr. Fritz Popp (see Matrix III V1) did research detailing the photonic emissions and electromagnetic interaction relative to DNAIRNA. Which also lends a new view to the existence of pyramidal-shaped cellular structures within the brain - specifically, cells shaped like two pyramids base to base - exactly the same configuration as the Delta-T antenna. Get it? 626"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO The phenomenology of svnesthesia cannot be explained by the present neurological model of the brain that maintains that the cortical regions are responsible for most physical senses. The rational cortex is responsible for sensory perception. This view can't explain svnesthesia. Instead, Doktor Cytowic argues that it is the limbic Vstem or \"emotional brain\" with its neural networks beneath the endocortex that has channels of communication with other parts of the brain via the endocrine and hormonal systems. It follows fiom his research that the dominance andpre-eminence of the cortex over the limbic system is not pefinctory, and the limbic system is not subordinate to it. It appears that it is actually the \"central control\", the CPU, to use computer language, of the overall brain function. This would intimate that finctionally, the corticalfinctiom and limbic finctions are nested, or \"multiplexed\", and that information and dbta acquired by the brain can be, or is, processed by parallel computation, ya? The important implication is that this phenomenon of gmesthesia suggests that & learninp process could be directly linked to emotions, rather that to sensory stimuli alone. The common feature of so-called \"synesthetic~\"~~ is that they have phenomenal memories, amazing visualisation abilities, like seeing vivid shapes and colours, and also remarkable psychic abilities, such as precognitions, deja-vu, clairvoyance, telepathy and remote viewing and sensing. But, unfortunately, these abilities are regarded as \"abnormal\" or \"strange7'. So, they play these down and hide them. Ah, I forgot. These people don't do very well in math, and they often get lost on the streets - poor orientation. The experimental conclusions, conducted on subjects under controlled laboratory conditions, forced Dr. Cytowic to make a courageous statement: \"synesthesia takes place in the left side of the limbic system, deep in the temporal lobe.\" This confirsed everyone in the neurological community. But, we know that what he is talking about is the so-called \"hyperfbnctions of the limbic system\", as yet unrecognised, unaccepted and non-existent to orthodox medical and psychological sciences. Traditional neurology proposes a hard-wired circuitry of neuronal networks mediating neurological functions. The new view requires and proposes new electrical channels of communication. This has been dubbed \"volume transmission\" in contradistinction to the traditional \"wiring transmission\" mediated by the normal axons, synapses, dendrites and spikes. Some Eastern researchers, by contrast, regard that \"synesthesia\" is a \"normal\" condition we are born with, but culturally is \"blotted out\" of our neural functions. Only a few individuals manage to maintain this function as adults, who have retained this phenomenon as a conscious awareness - even if it appears strange! Ironically, the purpose of training in transcendental meditation ('I'M) in the Siddhis program, the Magickal training in Hermetic Orders, like our own, and various types of Yogas, is to arouse these \"synesthetic functions\", for they verge very closely with the phenomenology of \"psychic powers\".

Now, I wish to explain the experiment. I wish for Dr. B to have the cine filmstrip ready for show. Thank you. About five years ago, the topic of the effect of electromagnetic fields on humans became very notorious due to the books and articles by Mr.Paul ~rodeur~', who wrote the most controversial articles to this day in the very popular New Yorker magazine. Since then, he wrote other books and made video films. Simultaneously, but with less notice, researchers in CCCP and Germany were investigating effects of lights, colour and pulsing light, and colour flashes on the brain of animals and humans, as well as on the rnind/psyche. I will not go into detail, because new technologies emerged fiom said endeavours, including the brainwave altering machines in France, Germany, and their American counterpart, like today you see advertised (Zygon,Voyager,etc). New technologies emerged, based on light and sound, based on the research of Drs. Thomas Budzynski and Igor Lozanov. I believe Dr.2 and fiiends know them personally. Anyway, the main theoretical construct behind the so-called \"psycho-acoustical stimulation\" and \"luminal brain entrainment\", the technologies behind those devices, was the new and revolutionary theory of the \"holographic quantum mechanical brain\", or the \"Bohm- 59 The paradigm in Matrix V1 proposes a model for tbought, brain attenuation thereof, and processes where thought descends into particulate mass. See New Yo* magazine for 1989, June 12, June 19 and June 26. Paul Brodeurs' three-part article entitled \"Annals of Radiation\", about EMF hazards."},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Pribrarn Model\", for short. We have copies of those research papers if anyone wants them.61 See Dr. D, ya? The area explored by Dr. Budzynski was the Theta, or \"twilight state\". To quote him directly, \"the areas ranging between 4 to 7 cps and the hypnagogic state\", or spont&us imagery that supposedly emanates fiom Jung's LLpersonal and collective unconscious\" when the mind is suitably stimulated. Jung used active imagznation and mandalas to reach the \"unconscious''. Modem technolom uses electromametic and acoustical stimulation. The fields of \"subliminal psycho&\" and \"psycho& of the unconscious\" postulated by Carl Gustav Jung are the keys to understanding this Jynergy of brain and psyche. To summarise the brain phenomenology behind these novel technologies of light and sound, brain entrainment occurred by (because of) the auricular and occular pieces of the machine, and the effect was the alteration of the (levels of the ) neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine and beta endorphins by Alpha and Theta induced states. They published data, which we critically analysed, and found to be incorrect and misleading. But, then, these are market in^ endeavours. not scientific. However, we did experiment using the very machines on the market and found most interesting information. We were our own volunteers, or \"guinea pigs\" - something all scientists should do instead of using animals. ( applause) After we recorded and obtained all the info we needed and plotted cerebral magnetic-fields using the protocol developed by Mrs. Dr.L., we noticed that all three of us, plus four other volunteers, had the same heam for two or three nights in a row. So, we decided to investigate further. We had the available data, so we gave the three devices to Herr Doktor G., the mad scientist with his electronic sniffers (laughter), and he analysed each device down to the silicon microchips! We will not discuss the electronic details. That stuff is beyond our scope of expertise, but what we &d find is that there are multiple electronic _fbnctions be in^ formulated bv the machines that apparently were not in the oriPinal set of ~romams or firnctions advertised Very curious indeed. Further research by Dr. G revealed that these devices were ~owedul receivers for some -form of sirmals that were not straight electromametic waves - perhaps higher order electromagnetic^^^, such as scalar waves. 7Rev seem to become more ~ronounced when these machines were close to an o~erating Wset or comuuter WTscreen. Keep that info in mind for later. Two or three days later, I had a dream about the DNA and RNA molecules dancing to beautifbl music, but when a strange sound was heard, the music stopped, and the DNA and RNA molecules started to go crazy and fight amongst themselves. I awoke frightened, but I recorded the dream in detail. Later in the day, I read a paper describing a new technolom of DNA and RNA alteration based on radio fiequencies called \"in vivo 61 This has been discussed during the past year in the Unified Field and Consciousness series in Zibe Leading Edge. \" See M& 111 for a review of higher order EM functions and discussion themof.

But that night, when my husband and I were reading and listening to music of Mozart, his flute and harp concerto, I fell asleep on the armchair and had the dream about the DNA and RNA molecules dancing again, but this time so beautifully, it was almost like a real-life ballet I was watching. Then, I woke up and realised the dream Sound affects the resonance _frequencv of the DNA and RNA molecules. Certain speczjic frequencies, timbres, pitch, and characteristic musical themes create either harmonic resonance or dis-harmonic resonance. Naturally, Mozart, Bach, Vivaldi, Telemann and the old masters' music is very beautifbl and harmonious, where \"modem music\" is highly questionable. In collaboration with Mrs. Dr. L, we found light and colour frequencies that were geometrical harmonics of the Theta brainwaves emitted during lucid dreaming. We used Fourier and Wiener transforms to create optical patterns and enfolded them in the colour graphics showing the cerebral magnetic fields you saw in the cine filmstrip. We also determined some resonant vibrations of the sound corresponding to melatonin, the neurotransmitter secreted by the pineal, and responsible for sleep-dream cycles. We found it, and chose a harmonic in the near ultrasonic spectrum, and recorded it onto the soundtrack of the cine filmstrip. We projected it, and 50% of this group had the dream about the audio-visual stimulus that entrained your brain in about 6 minutes. Wonderfbl, ya? Of course, the implications are truly amazing, as this can be used for wonderful, non- intrusive, non-invasive healing applications, for it affects the DNA and RNA immediately and expediently, per our own research. The simplest and most immediate application would be for a person to construct a symbol or mandala following Jung's or Yoga instructions, select a musical piece that one truly loves, preferably harp or flute, like the ancient Egyptians or Greeks, contemplate it while listening to the music, and then go to sleep. Repeating this for a week or so will immediately affect the DNA, RNA and immune system, and healing will occur almost \"miraculously\". Dr. M: Have you tried this technique on sick people already? Ms.Dr.C: Ya vol, we have indeed tried it on many people. Mrs. Dr. L, in her own medical practice, quite confidentially of course, has tried it with 100% success, both in China and the West. Of course, she used Chinese music in China and Mozart in the West. We are using two pieces by Mozart as our control music. The harp and flute double concerto and the Clarinet Quintet in A, K58 1, which will be played here Thursday night. We are doing fbrther research in this topic, but very confidentially, because of you all know who, ya? Ya! This may prove to be a blessing to mankind, because this simple process addresses the DNA, RNA and immune system directly, and according to Mrs.Dr.L, also the thymus and pineal glands. Interestingly, it is the locus of the Upper Tan-Tiens and Triple Warmer in Chinese ancient medicine, the Cauldrons and transducers of Chi, or Life Force. Fortunately, both Mrs. Dr. L and I have orthodox medical degrees, and wear the \"white coats of medical approval\" ( laughter). \" As synchronicity would have it, we received data on MRX technology just before receiving the data for this presentation."},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO What we do is to make sure our research patients \"entertain\" themselves drawing symbols of their dreams in full colour, admiring them before they go to sleep, and listening to the music tapes of Mozart or Master Ludwig von Fu-Man-Chu (roaring laughter). There are some patients in the research hospital to whom we can talk frankly about this technique. Most people respond quite enthusiastically about it, and of course, when they are healed, they tell others about their \"secret\"! We are collecting fantastic information and feedback. We are also experimenting with monotonic harmonics, or single frequencies, that may be disguised as \"background noise\". Very clever, ya? Any questions? Dr. R: Are you exploring the application of magnetic fields directly to the brain for inducing cerebral hypefinctions, like induced psychic powers, astral phenomena and time travel, besides healing? Mrs.Dr.C: Absolutely! We know government agencies have been doing that for years, but we do have totally different goals. Of course, we are all bound by the strict rules of the Order of absolute non-interference. We can't even help our own families unless they want to be helped. Remember, out Oath of Secrecy is absolute! Alateia nosi is!^^ One \"pet project\" we have is to help our young children to be \"deprogrammed\" from the influences of schools, TV and radio media, videogames, etc. We do this by inhczng creativig in them to create their own symbols and mandalas by playing the music while they are going to sleep. We have four children - three of primary school age. I am sure most of you have children as well, so this may be of great benefit to our own siblings. However, the magnetic field research requires very special helmets, which Hen Dr.G is building for us. We only have one now, and we need at least two more.

We have selected extracts fiom five videos by three very unusual American unorthodox scientists, which you must know fiom our Order's extensive yearly technical packages you all get. These three scientists are Lt.Col Thomas E. Bearden, Dr. Alfked Bielek and Dr. Preston Nichols. All three have been involved with the famous, or infamous, Montauk Project, Project Phoenix, and Dr. Bielek with the Philadelphia experiment (Project Rainbow). The video is about one hour long. If you want to grab some pop corn, I'm sure Dr. D wouldn't mind. Pop too. You may need it. Dr.Z: What means pop korn? And pop? (Dr.D: Oh, no! Not again! It is like Caviar and Vodka, Igor!) (laughter) Dr.E: If you have questions during the video, don't hesitate to ask. We'll stop the frame. Lights, please, Dr. B? Ok, here we go. This is Tom Bearden speaking about scalar electromagnetics. ( video is shown ) Dr.Z: I wish to explain something. The \"woodpecker\" transmitters are three, operating now. One in Riga, Latvia. This transmits to Europe and Amerika. The second, near Kamenogorsk. This transmits signal to Asia. The third in very far away place, other side of CCCP, in Siberia in Chikotskoye Nagorye. This transmits signal to Amerika, North and South. These are all ELF with modulation information contained inside radio waves. Go on. I wish to say that Kapitan Bearden is not correct, because there are also Amerikanshe 65 Agdn, see Leading Edge #63 and #64. 632"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO Teknicians in Soviet Union working on secret instaIIations with top Supreme Soviet ~ureau~ennission.~~ Also, with KGB. Before, NKVD. Dr.E: Thank you, Dr. Z. That is good information to know. Go ahead, Dr. B. Okay, now we have Dr. Al Bielek talking about Einstein's relativistic physics, but with Unified Field Theory concepts, per Blue Book Grudge report disclosures. Notice how two orthogonal (90') magnetic fields created by a Tesla conical coil create a third field due to resonance. These mutually orthogonal pulsating fields are able to rotate the space-time vectors so as to create changes in time flow. Ok, now this is Dr. Nichols, the electronics wizard fiom the Montauk Project. He is talking about relativistic physics in relation to the creation of local distortions of the space-time continuum to create hyperspacial or higher order electromagnetics. That antenna he talks about is the famous Delta-T antenna. You can see it looks like two pyramids connected at the base. Remember this configuration when we talk about special Delta-T magnetic sensors.67 Most of the information is discussed in detail in his book, The Montauk Project. Also, more details are found in Chapter 7 of Matrix III by Val Valerian, a copy of which is on the table with the rest of the reference books mentioned. These books are all available in the U.S., but in English only. No translations are available - not yet, anyway. Ok. Now we are going to take a break and return for the formal presentation of this topic on all its aspects. Lights, please, Dr. B? See you in about 15 minutes. Yes, Dr. S? Dr.S: Can we obtain copies of these videos in European foxmat? I know many people who would like to see these! Dr.E: I will have to check that with Dr.D. I will let you know, Ok, Dr.S? Now, let's take a coffee, no, a tea break! Break Dr.E: Well, that was a refreshing break! Now, I want to discuss the most important points about brain research specificallv related to behavior modiication. mood alteration L61n other words, there are US scientists working in Russia on mind control projects that affect the American population, besides working on their own US projects. 67 Which brings to mind another visualization relative to the counter-rotating tetrahedronal fields of the Merkabah, which could be seen as a Delta-T formation with the top and bottom components rotating in opposite directions, creating a spacetime distortion in the center where the human being is generating it using emotion which, if done properly, causes the body to shift in space-time to another reality system. Many of the substances in daily life, such as tobacco, fluoride, etc, affect space-time fields generated by various neumnal structures, thereby prohibiting development and inquiry into hyperfunctions. In this society, they are also used to firmly focus perceptive fields in lower brain structures to ensure fdon of control and domination paradigms to preserve power structures. According to some sources, implants are used by some species to prevent slave species from \"warping outn and escaping imprisonment. All these paradigms have been in use since ancient times and do not have their ultimate origin on Earth.

Dr.Z already discussed, brilliantly, I may add, the latest confidential research on the inducement of paranormal functions via a novel technology yesterday afternoon. The reason why I'm going this route is that imperative to know and understand the neural mechanisms linkim Psvche and Soma, hi& that react to electromametic fields68. and how thev are traumatised or intruded -. This, I may add, is so urgent a matter, per Dr. N himself, that he personally reviewed the information presented by Dr. Z and my own research. This urgency has to do with the forthcoming events in 1995. Our very survival depends on how well we learn to protect ourselves from assault. Let me begin reviewing the work of the eminent Dr. J.M. Delgado, the 'father of electronic mind control.\" He has been maligned a lot, but his brilliance and ingenuity deserves acknowledgement at least fiom scientists such as ourselves. He started with great and noble ideals, as most scientists do, and then got seduced by elitists and the CIA, who gave him unlimited funds to conduct his (by now) \"classified\" research. I have studied his research thoroughly, and I have all his scientific publications and data - and then some more. He worked primarily alone. His four main hypotheses69 were: (A) there are fbndamental brain mechanisms responsible for all intellectual, emotional and artistic functions, (B) these mechanisms can be detected, analysed and influenced either chemically or electrically, (C) predictable behavior and mental responses can be induced by direct manipulation of the brain, and @) we can substitute intelligent and purposeful neuronal functions for blind, automatic responses.70 The only difiiculty he had was in \" Remember: electromagnetic fields have both a \"real\" three-dimensional component, and a \"imaginary\" hyperspatial component. To understand how this second component, which is psychoactive, was conceded, refer to the material in MIltrir III which details how Maxwell's Equations, which utilised quaternion notation and contained both ComDonents, were changed by several scientists after Maxwell's death to a singular form within 3-dimensions only, expressed in vector notation. Taking a more esoteric leap, knowing what we dl know about reality structures at this present time, one way this could have happened is that the minds of these men were manipulated by some faction having advanced technology that would cause the idea and emotional impetus to change the equations to simultaneously appear in the minds of three men. Since we do know that certain factions used radio communication long before Marconi, it is quite conceivable that an interface existed between the world power structure and factions quite external to them. On the other hand, it could also be a resonant aspect of the morphogenetic field as related to the fields of the planet itself which forms a matrix for impression of resonant thought patterns from another Source. Of course, anything is possible. Though we do know a lot, there is a lot more to learn in making known the unknown. Life is what happens after you plan things, isn't it? Another thought pattern about this impetus to control and manipulate, mentioned in MIltrir N, is the aspect of energy acquisition as implied in the book Cekdne Rophecies. Unable to acquire energy from the Universal Source, entites are forced to energy parasitism through the use of control, manipulation, electronics, drugs, radiation, etc. - all the time a mechanistic mass-to-mass approach which only recognizes ego aggrandisement, dl the while never recognizing the fact that they are the source of their own undoing. Silly wabbit! Kids need equality in consciousness and love, not psychotherapy, drugs and mind control. Motto: Be impeccable to your Self. Remember thut sometime, vou will see it all in reverse and experience vourself fiom the emotional mint of other entities with whom vou have had interadon. Ya? Which in fact were also belief svsfents. Perhaps the most insidious belief system, based on previous historical thought patterns, which dictate the removal of will from members of a population."},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO proposing a suitable neurophysiological model for \"love\" within his mechanistic concept of the mind, which to him was \"essentially the brain\". He was a romantic Spaniard and a showman, but his heart \"felt in love\" with control, not with love.71 He used classical music to study brain hnctions of spatiotemporal artistic perception. He also studied carehlly the neurochemical and neurophysiological aspects of anger and rage72by noting the patterns of neuronal discharges. He coined the phrase \"neuronal fields\" to refer to the area of synergistic electrochemical activity surrounding firing neurons. He made the important discovery that raae has sinale neuronal discharpes. but it creates multi-level behavioral regonses in the rest of the organism of the su&iect e-riencina raae. Likewise, it fleets other individuals nearby bv a strange _form of \"induced resonance\", \"harmonic resonance\", to use the word paradoxically! He did these experiments with monkeys, and later, it is rumoured, using political prisoners or \"~olunteers\".~ What is important is that the neurophysiology, neurochemistry and psychology of angerlrage was thoroughly studied by Delgado. Once one understands anger, then it is easy to devise technology to control it. You all remember the famous films showing the \"electronic matador\" Delgado stopping an angry charging bull, fiozen in its tracks by the simple push of a button. Well, that was in the 1960's using implanted electrodes. T+, the technoloay has advanced so _far that it can even be done bv remote control - in another countiy ! But why these experiments? The answer is obvious! To stop anm mobs charging against the government cold in their tracks. And, of course, to do the reverse. To create an anq mob to charge against anyone, even their own compatriots, fellow soldiers or even neighborhood riots. Remember Watts and the Chicago riots? Why would people ransack their own neighborhood and stores? I think you are getting the picture. 74 Electronic stimulation of the brain (ESB). That is what Delgado termed his newly created technology in the 1960's. Since then, a great deal has been researched in the areas of neurochemistry, neurophysiology and attending fbnctional psychologies - and vice versa. Indicating that Delgado was steeped in both social consciousness and body consciousness, didn't know himself or who he was, and Yell prey\" to his own ego defense mechanisms as a defense for inner insecurity based on his sew-perceived inability to satisfy cultUraI modalities of ego aggrandisement, especially when presented with unlimited funds and his inner terror of bath himself and the CIA. Ya? Again, redlecting the paradigm of the time - preoccupation with behaviors faered by lower order brain structures and the manipulation thereof. \" Apparently, most of the Uvolunteers\" in US mind control programs, under the guidance of the CIA, eventually constituted a cmve uuriience which included the mentdly ill, inmates in prisons, and unwitting people on the street - just like Montauk 40 years inter and other apparent programs where tens of thousands of children and adults vanished into oblivion under the paradigm of \"national insecurity\" and control. \" Immediately, the Los Angeies riots come to mind. There were witnesses to electronics vessels off the LA coast for three days prior to the outbreak of the riots, black helicopters were seen for days before the riots even broke out that traveled in triad formation with microwave antennae and evidence of other advanced electronic gear, and witnesses to the fact that gangs were literally \"hired\" by government operatives to pillage and carry the spoils off as a reward; gangs were supplied with materials to start fires, government operativeslsleepers were themselves participating in the arranged chaos. A Hegelian scenario if there ever was one, courtesy of Uncle."},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO Soon after Delgado started his advanced research, the behaviorist Skinner provided \"amazing\" information about behavioral science, modification and control. His writings were extremely controversial, as were his experiments - in which he used his own children. '' His main thesis was that \"humans are not really free, but totally dependent and controlled by their environment.\" In other words, environment dictates behavior. This is blatant in Western culture where our very own surroundings affect our mood. So, he argued that \"man can only be free if he can be liberated from the tentacles of his environment.\" This, of course, Delgado saw as the golden opportunity to help mankind. Unfortunately, the intelligence agencies and governments had a totally different agenda. The so-called Delgado-Skinner protocols were duly appropriated, refined and meticulously developed to ultimately create the \"ideal society\" composed of \"ideal citizens\", all electronically programmed to exhibit \"ideal\" and \"good behavior. No crime, no s~bversion.'~ Everyone lives happy in a pychoczvzIzsed society. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the ultimate end (objective) of the New World Order! To close this section, let me state to you that today, in the 'go's, there is a technology that can electronically mimic any neurotransmitter, peptide, hormone, enzyme, or protein to induce any given specified behavior77 in any individual whatsoever. In simple terms, you can electronically induce any behavior and emotion you desire in any individual or individuals, anytime! An example of a large scale field test was the fear introduced in the Iraqis in the Gulf War. We showed the specific details last year in a documentary film, he by Are there any questions? Yes, Dr. M? Dr.M: Are you saying that this technology can go against the will of the individual and create havoc in society? Dr.E: Yes, sir! This is the unfortunate truth, even though there already is havoc in society. Xhis technoloov can rnanirnlate anvb*. number ofpeo~le, of colour, race or national There are no international barriers. Remember the classical experiment of Delgado, the one on a \"volunteer\"? He made him slap his own face repeatedly! The subject then said something like: \"I guess your electricity is stronger than 75 One of Skinners first subjects was his own daughter. She killed herself in her '20s. 76 Of course, complimentary biological and chemical functions are simultaneously introduced - an example being that fluorides in drinking water were used by the Germans and Soviets both to keep concentration camp inmates compliant and submissive to authority. It is the only reason why it exists in the US water supplies, along with 700 other chemicals. The claim about fluorides and dental health is a ruse.

Possible because of genetic variances between different racial groups. Tuskeegee was just a beginning."},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO my.will, Dr. Delgado!\" Also, remember from last year's meeting that there are ethnic, racial, cultural and gender (meczfic) electromametic sirnatures that government researchers have obtained. If DNA and pigments dictate race and colour, then there is an electromagnetic signature for each type. The Genome Project and similar projects are related to this endeavour of cataloging people genetically. They alreacjl have done it electronicalty! We have a mixed racial group here, so our signatures would of course reveal that difference. So, spiritually we may all be equal, but racially we have different electromagnetic signatures, each characteristic of its DNA, phenotype, etc. Ok, Dr M? . Mrs Dr.L: Will you explain the details of this electromagnetic signature and the technology behind it? Dr. E: Wow! That's a biggie! Molecular neurochemistry and genetics are not by specialty, but I will give it a try. With due respect to Mrs. Dr. L, biology is to me what math is to most college students. I could never get close to those labs with dead cats and other animals. I am a nuts and bolts guy. I don't fhction very well around blood! Or without it, I guess. Ok, let's see. Let me make a very long story very short. You medical types know precisely how racial and colour patterns are fashioned in humans, so I won't discuss it, for I know very little of it. However, the melanin, which is very sensitive to electromagnetic radiation, especially W, has a distinct absorption spectrum whose pattern has been studied in detail. This pattern also has an emission spectrum, for anything that absorbs energy also emits energy. It is the emission pattern of the skin of different races, colours and ethnic groups that have a characteristic electromagnetic signature around the body. This is known as the information band or morphogenetic fields0, to use Sheldrake's term, that surrounds every living organism in the Universe. Rigourously, this electromagnetic signature is not really the electromagnetic energy associated with the electromagnetic spectrum. It is a higher order of EM energy, associated with scalar waves, solotonic or takyon waves. It is definitely not photonic waves, per the EM spectrum. This information band or morphic fieid is in essence what the ancients called the Akasha field, or halo. Today, it is called the \"aura\". There is no orthodox technology that can detect, measure or register this information band. That is why \"it does not exist\" for orthodox physics81 and medicine as well. Only psychics, clairvoyants and some members in this group are able to see these information bands which, incidentally, is multilayered. However, there is a special technolorn that uses ultraviolet-ineared harmonics and optical phase coniuaation that, rumour has it, is alien technology, that can actually detect, measure, quantise and analyse this information band or morphic field. I have never seen one of these machines, but a colleague of mine lent me his photos of an actual subjects information bandlmorphic field. I have it here in these frames. Dr.B, will you pass these two photos around? Thanks. You will notice they have a bluish background and there are density gradients as the band projects away fiom the The first diagram showing energy bands around humans and access frequencies was published in Matrix IL '' Since orthodox science was locked out of this area by government technocrats, who held the knowledge as \"classified information necessary for national security\"."},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO body. It is about 12-14 cm wide, approximately. These are monochromatic, but the energy densities can be accurately measured -- as in the earlier emission and x-ray spectrographic densitometers. It would be interesting to contrast it with what clairvoyants see. Perhaps Mrs. Dr. L would care to comment on that later? I hope I have answered your question, madame. Mrs Dr.L: Yes, you have, very well. Thank you Dr. E. Now, my comment. The two photos are truly remarkable. The body does look indeed like a radiator of energy in the photos. It is quite accurate, but it does not show another fine layer that exists beyondthe inner granular information band, shown here as various gradients of blue. Do you care to comment on the photos, Ms. Dr. C? Ms.Dr.C: Ya! They are beautfil! What a difference from those New Age colour Polaroid's that show mostly thermal, molecular and ionisation effects, or the Kirlian plasmas. These are masterpieces, ya! But, I agree with Mrs. Dr. L. The layer corresponding to the Akashic subtle body or Spirit Body is missing! I'm sure they can't detect it. It is purely higher order, 6th order, takyonic. This scalar or solotonic must be 4th order or so, maybe 5th but no higher.82 We see also the subtle hyperbolic fields around the chakras, absent here in the photo, because they are photonic, 3rd order. I also noticed that the subject is a woman, even though the physical body contour is not resolvable. It is black. This can be concluded from the substructure pattern in the inner layer next to the body. A man's substructure is coarser. I like it. Can we buy one of these machines? Maybe we could spy on our children by remote control, ya? ( laughter ) Dr E: I don't think they are for sale in the Sears catalogue ( laughter). Oh, oh! Yes, Dr. z ? Dr. 2: My fiiends and I think photos are very he. Have you used image analysis with algorithm to obtain 3-D image in real time to see motion? We have done something like that in laboratory in CCCP. It shows thinking process. Dr E: You mean you can read a person's thoughts, what a person is thinking? Dr. 2: Nyet. No, not what a person is thinking, not this machine, but which of four level subtle bodies is active in what person is thinking at moment, yes? As Madame Dr. C noted by bio-radio vision (Clairvoyance), we know there are 4 bioplasma bodies around body physik (physical body), and foto shows that. But, we see substructure with our machine that is acoustic type of vibration, but we see in real time. I say in foto, foto shows that information band contains information in bioplasma substructure, because bioplasma is information, yes? ( laughter ) 82 With this in mind, it is interesting to note that many highly secure underground facilities have surveillance equi@ment which can and dws detect the presence of an individual in the out-of-body state - we have run into this before. They have EMIscalar boobytraps to confine those in that state who stray into the \"wrong places\"."},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Dr. E: I see what you mean. ( more laughter ), Yes, Ms. Dr. C? Ms. Dr. C: I have worked with Dr. Z. I think what he is saying is that if you analyse the original information band with a certain type of machine programmed with a special real- time algorithm, you can determine by looking at the sub-structure which of the four subtle bodies the individual is using in \"thinking\", ya? The mental, emotional, intuitive or etheric body. Is that correct. Herr Doktor Z? Dr. Z: Yes, yes, Bravo! That is what I said! ( laughter ). Dr. E: Thank you, Ms. Dr. C, for helping me to understand the question. No, Dr. Z, we have not analysed the information band in real time - we don't have the algorithm. In fact, we don't have the machine! ( laughter) As I said, the photos were taken by somebody else in their laboratory. However, I find it very interesting what you are saying that & information band consists of a substructure that is of acoustical nature. That would confirm what Colonel Bearden maintains - that the human brain is a special form of scalar wave transducer. The scalar waves may then be of the evancescent, or 2nd order longitudinal waves, outside the electromagnetic spectrum. This may explain why the only so-called Rife machine that works is the is the one used by Dr. Rife himself, that was equipped with an Abrams acoustical -pulse aenerator. Bearden maintains that those were scalar evanescent waves. Very interesting indeed. Yes, Dr. S? Sri Dr. S: Thank you, my friend. I wish to say that last night, after Dr. 2's presentation, five colleagues and I who are also clairvoyant, concluded that the chakras that are direct& connected to their remective subtle bodies by means of bidirectional berbolic - channels. or mini Einstein-Rosen bridges. do remnd to their res~ective sound freauencies. or \"tonal mantraf. We all know that in this group. However, my dear colleagues, Dr. E, Dr. Z and Mine Dr. C just confirmed scientifically what Indian Yoga has taught for millennia about the subtle bodies and chakras. I think the reason why the body of the subject in the photos appears as black shadow with no detail in it is that the thermal component of energy radiating fiom the body, which is only 1st order EM energy, was filtered out with intiared absorption filters. When you remove heat and light fiom the human body, what you have left is the Void, vacuum, or Dirac Sea. In Sanskrit we call that the Mahabindu. All you are able to see then, or what the machine is recording, is merely the subtle energy that holds mass together - gluonic forces. The photos don't show very much detail of substructure, but there is substructure in the first three levels, because that is different in the two genders, man and woman. That is why Dr. C could tell it was a woman. However, the 4th order subtle body does not show substructure as such. It is a continuum. In Yogic terms we call that Ahha, which is roughly translated as Spirit -that has no sex - neither man or woman. Dr. Z discovered this scientific phenomenon in his research, but only clairvoyant Siddhis can actually see this, and is a bit different from the photos, because you can actually see seven subtle bodies, and their respective hyperfine structures, which incidentally extend all the way to the atomic, nuclear and sub-nuclear levels - more precisely, the quantum relativistic level."},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Dr. E: Thank you very much, Sri Dr. S. I am interested in your information. I'm curious about the connexion between the subtle bodies and the atomic quantum relativistic level. Could you expound that some more, please? Sri Dr. S: Well, it is your presentation. ( laughter ) Maybe I will say a thing or two when you are finished. Dr. E: That will be great. We physicists and engineers tend to get too involved with nuts and bolts, and sometimes forget where all these equations, particles and technology originally come fiom. As you say, fiom Akasha. Ok, let me continue. Where was I? Oh yes, electronic mind control - back to reality! ( laughter) We spoke about electromagnetic signatures, DNA and genes, racial genes, Genome Project, etc. Now, let me wrap this up, and move to the next section of my presentation. We have seen now that the neurochernistry, neurophysiology and bioelectromagnetics of given behaviors have been thoroughly researched by Delgado and other researchers for the past 20 years or so, and most recently by Dr. Eldon Byrd of the Naval Weapons Research Center, under ONR grants, and others. You may wonder, why is the government and military so interested in brain research? You will know now why this secret and classified research is light years ahead of what is known in academia and written in books and magazines for the masses. By now you all know that the same extensive research has been done on pathogens, viruses, bacteria and other disease-causing organisms. Just look at our own scientific literature and research for the past three years! All of this extensive info is contained in enormous databases waiting to be used on a large scale when the time is ripe, and the time is now. With great horror we have seen the return of ancient plagues in India, South American, Afrika and an epidemic of the age-old tuberculosis - consumption, for the romantics - and the new ones, such as the genetically engineered AIDS, CFS, Candida Albicans, Legionnaires disease and toxic shock, just to mention a few. Are these just coincidences, dormant bugs revived, genetic engineering with electronic catalytic mutations, or punishment fiom God for our sins? Let me now shift a bit fiom a scientific perspective to a strateaic perspective and the tactical im~lications of all the scientific concepts and technolorn I have discussed so far. Where does it fit in the grand scheme of political, military, economic, and social strategies of the One World Order agenda, and, I might also add, the alien agendas? Let me take a drink of water before I start - actually double shot of whiskey would be more a propos! ( in the background, the audience yells \"NO! Vodka! Vodka!\", and laughter and jokes follow) I am sure you are all intimately familiar with all the latest scenarios in the world, but let me emphasize what's been happening in the United States since meeting last year (1 993). Excellent condensed information is available in Matrix II and III, and Leading Edge research magazine. We have copies on the table with reference books. Only English is available, though. As you know, the UNCED Meeting in Brazil in June of 1992"},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO consolidated the plans and established the protocols for world ovulation control throuph - penocide. g3 7his has been the primav-vumose of the geneticallv enzineered dames. We will dub these \"techno-plagues\", or \"TPs\". The main strategy to rid the world of undesirable, inferior races\" and people that are regarded as \"useless feeders\" is to do so by introducing \"TPs\" to targeted countriesg4 : Afiika, India, and South America. China would be included, but the superiority of their medicine prevents that. They would control it very quickly, yet Western medicine with their mere 35% cure (rate) pooh-poohs Chinese medicine with their 95% cures. Funny! So, TPs initially introduced in contaminated foocistuffs and drinkina water reservoirs is the initial modus operandi. In the United States and worldwide, homosexuals have also been targeted. This was introduced through Hepatitis B vaccines etc. The second method of population control was via \"telegeodynarnics\", namely, by creatin~ natural disasters, like earthquakes, tidal waves, hurricanes in designated overpopulated Third World areas.

Cross reference: Senator Gephardt's contact number alleged to be that found on the copy spirited out of the conference.

Notice you have the presence of the 1933 Nazi paradigm of Dusine Ohne Leben (Existence without Life) - the one they used in public mass media propaganda films to justify the euthanasia of mental patients at su major psychiatric hospitals in Germany. The hospital at Hadamar is perhaps the most famous. The same view is ultimately backed by the paradigm of Cecil Rhodes. The bond between Germany, US and England is a key. Ya? It would seem Mexico City, with a population of wer 1 million, is just such an expendable city. So much for NAFTA, again, simply a ruse/step to a higher level. \" For further amplification of these topics, see LE #63 and #64,1993 Conference. Fort Lewis also had the apparent distinction of hosting, at one time, the mathematician Von Neumann, of Montauk fame.

As you know, the One World Order boys are divided into two groups: (A) World Bankers, Elitists and Cultural, Religious and Political Intelligentsia on one side that want absolute control via total economic control of the world's monies and natural resources and (B) Military, Intelligence and Scientific Technologists that supposedly work for the first group. This group is the one that interfaces with the alien Ets. This year (1994) a very subtle, yet pronounced feud is going on between the two great giants of European Nobility, namely, between Prince Philip of Edinburgh, one of the most powerfbl world figures and the successor to the throne, Prince Charles. Prince Philip does not want Charles to be the successor, probably because he is too liberal.

Should this preferred market collapse, the One World Order plans would collapse immediately and create total havoc in the world economies. A real worldwide collapse, totally out of control!

Japan is becoming more powefil, both economically and technologically; China is becoming \"an alarmingly strong power\". Meanwhile, Russia is in shambles, the US is in shambles economically, and the Davros Protocols of 1993 and 1994 are just not working as planned. Even though Maurice Strong's global agenda of World Ecology is working well, and the Rockefeller Protocols of \"Federal, State, County and Municipal Ordinances\" is slowly but surely infiltrating every American city, no matter how small, the bankers and financiers are getting desperate and about ready to pull the plug, as it were, on the world economies in 1995. This is forthcoming, with or without their control. In a recent secret meeting -- similar to ours -- of the worlds key power-lords, including Clinton's boss, but not Mr. Clinton, the Technocrat Lords, the far right, finally gave the Elitists-Politicians-Bankers (EPB) the ultimatum.92 In essence, what was said was, \"look fellows, we have been waiting for your stupid financial plans and strategies to work for about 10 years. It ain't working, fellows. It is time to use our methods, our way! Remember, we always get results quickly!\" They are referring to the Iraq war, of course. So, the bottom line? Well, the EPB's are now very scared that the Far Right is going to take matters into their own hands, and there is nothing they can do to stop them, because thev have technoloaical vre-eminence!

( dead silence ) Any questions? Dr. B: Is that why there have been so many people seeing \"angels\", \"light beings\", \"spirits\" and other instances of what could be either religious or psychic experiences? What about the \"channeling\" phenomenon of the past five years?94 Dr. E: Well, yes and no. As was mentioned earlier, there is a project sardonically called \"Hoiv See\". It is being conducted by the Vatican and the CIA. Strange bedfellows! The New Age fad about contacts with angels, archangels and saints is part of another, more sinister scenario yet, which I am not at liberty to discuss here. The channeling phenomenon is also related to this sinister plot. Yet, there is some very genuine information being given to the public through this medium of channeling. I cannot disclose what the Source is, but it is mostly for the benefit of the New Age community that is very ignorant of science, naive, gullible, and almost stupid when it comes to tactical matters. They are in great danger, because they have been targeted for very precise protocols - a la Montauk - because thev are unable to differentiate a aenuine osvchic. oaranorma1 or religious experience-from one that is induced either hologrqhicalZv or bv virtual realiv manivulations of a very advanced type, not the commercial Mickey Mouse stuff, if you pardon the expression, trash! They all think that spirit is taking to them. Little do they know who this \"spirit\" really is, and what it is up to. At this point, I want to mention two specific books that I think every New Ager should read. One is \"Bringers of the New Dawn\" by Barbara Marciniak, and the 2nd book of \"me Montauk Project\" by Preston Nichols.

Unfortunately, I do know, all of us here know, the Source of that grand scale intrusion, but there is nothing we can do to help those that don't want to be helped. The only thing we can do is give them information, and refer them to legitimate research from where they can draw their own conclusions. I apologize, Dr. B, forgetting carried away with your question, but it did touch a soft spot in me. You see, my ex-wife and two daughters are heavily involved in the New Age movement. In fact, my oldest daughter is now \"channeling\" in California. Her material is very Vie, but she thinks the same thing about \"my truth\". Well, enough of that! Let me continue. I have already discussed the various technical aspects of the various protocols that are now being instituted for a large scale, final \"jield test\", a \"dkess rehearsal\", ifyou wzll, on selected nations in the world, because the EPBs are not delivering what they have promised over 10 years ago (1980+): total economic control of 94 Referring to the increase, since 1988, of hoards of individuals \"channelingn"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO the world.

Unless you have special protective force fields, devices, extreme conscious awareness and advanced metal Yoga training, do not be exposed to it, or do so minimally.

And, especially for our distinguished visitors, beware of American shopping malls! Dr. B, please explain that to out Russian fiiends -- in Russian, please! Is there a word for \"shopping mall\" in Russian and Chinese? I hope not! ( laughter ) Once you knao this is happening, it automatically alerts your mind and psyche that you are treading on dangerous territory. We will deal with subliminals first Ifyou are consciouslv aware that there is encrypted subliminal information (embedded) in visual or aural (sound) stimuli, and give a verbal command to yourself and deny permission to register the information, there will be no assault or (at best) a minimal influence on your mind. This is for reading books and listening to music fiom the radio. As Preston Nichols said in the video, \"knowing it is haopening. how and whv it is ha~pening is vour first and greatest defence against intrusion.\" You already are in a state of alertness and awareness. Secondly, knowing the theory and mechanisms of how AC electricity, Hertzian and non-Hertzian waves and thoughtforms can intrudeg5 upon our brain and mind/psyche, we can create conditions to protect our information band from receiving noxious stimuli, for the higher order interactions with the outside world occurs there. This could be done in two ways -- well, actually three. First, you could move to Mars. ( laughter) Not really, but you could move to a far, far away place to eliminate all external cultural audio-visual stimuli. Some folks have done that. They are called \"hermits\", \"monks\" and \"recluses\". It is not feasible for us. The next thing to do is to create vour own environment in your laboratories and, most importantly, in your home, where you sleep. There are a few exceptions! ( laughter) If you live alone, like I do, there is no problem, but if you are mamed and have a family, it is very tricky. If you family knows about it and cooperates, it's great, but if they don't, as in my case, you have to either allow them to do what they want, or protect them secretly. This is categorical with teen agers, and a must with infants and small children. Get rid of commercial radio and television, and install your own video educational programme at home.

And, if any technology would see and detect it, then they are the Overlords of the Universe. We are safe with them. As for personal protective devices when we go to the marketplace or to a concert - - or baseball or soccer game, we recommend a device we have been testing for about a year, the brain-child of Dr. Larnbrakis and his associates. We are in contact with him through a fiiend of one of my students, who knows him. He does not know about us, but we know about his work. He and his associates publish their papers in the Leading Edge monthly. We have copies of all his research papers for distribution. Very interesting and quite different from mainstream science. Dr. B has several copies. The device is a so-called Takyon Capsule, which is a Unified Field device, which creates a Tensor-Spinor Field around the body using the information band itself! Very clever device. It is used as a medallion or necklace around the neck. It is very effective, compact and inexpensive -- the price of a semi-he watch. It also has a hnction that can create a dome-shaped force field with a simple insert and protocol. We have ordered these devices for all of this group, courtesy of Dr. N himself.

Finally, to sum up, I wish to point out that there is another very alarming scenario that has to do with ''alien1ET intervention\", but I am not at liberty to discuss that in here. I wish to point out, however, for out few colleagues in the astrophysics and astronomy fields, that your radiotelescope and astronomical ancillary equipment is also being monitored. So, be aware of that. Communication by electronic mail is absolutely out! Use letters, telepathy or, like our Babylonian ancestors, homing pigeons!

There are products out there which advertise that they involve takyons - we have found none that actually do other than the device we speak of. There are even products made of glass.

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Dr. D, please? Thank you. That is all. Dr. D: Thank you Dr.E. That was magnificent. It is important to remind the audience, however, that the scenario discussed by Dr. E has one most alarming piece of data he forgot to mention. If a national emergency occurred in which electrical power would be lost locally or widely across the nation, it would not a#ect the electronic mind control operations. Why? Because they have provided for such an occurrence, and knowing that panicflooting might ensue, they made sure that they would have their own power supply. They have their own diesel megawatt generators positioned strategically across the country, maybe even the world. Furthermore, they are using scalarphase conjugation waves strictly, which do not attenuate with distance whatsoever. Their phase conjugate \"mirrors\" or resonators are the microwave towers installed every 15-30 miles throughout the United states.\" This also links up with microwave communication with satellites. Do you now understand the importance of the cellular telephone microwave towers that have erupted worldwide between 1990 and 1994? So, you see, they are completely prepared for any tactical situation or emergency. The second protocol is the one in which they themselves purposely create a power failure that eliminates all electricity and communications, including telephones. men, they take over very quietly and swzjUy. Some \"field tests\" have already caused \"bla~kouts'~ in large cities to study possible scenarios. The protocol is that they have an electronic function that when activated incapacitates and 'yeezes\" any firearm whatsoever f?om jimctioning - anywhere. No details can be discussed now. Just be aware of that. This will suprise the hell out of paramilitary types, if you pardon the expression. Either they zap their brains or their firearms. They can easily do either one or both. It has already been field tested in Iraq and elsewhere. Remember that electronic mind control can also terminate life hnctions by zapping the brain. What to do in case of either scenario?

Now, we will hear what I think is the most urgent topic in this week's technical meeting. The presentation will be by our distinguished colleague, Dr. M, Professor Emeritus of Astronomy and former colleague of Prof XX in England. I urge you all to take notes on this topic, for this is perhaps the most controversial topic of the century. World governments know about this, and it is highly classified, and only a chosen few astrophysicists, physicists and medical researchers are nr Which include the GWEN network, cellular and \"personal\" communications, etc 647"},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO involved in this project. This may explain the very strange, controversial and highly classified HAARP project. Ladies and gentlemen, pennit me to present Dr. M. (applause ) Dr. M: Thank you, Dr. D. I say, this is a difficult topic to present, because of its controversial nature that polarised the astronomical community when it was first introduced in 1954 and subsequently confirmed around 1958. It was promptly classified for obvious reasons. No less than Prof Albert Einstein was involved in the project that consisted of a panel of merely five scientists, myself included. After Einstein's death in 1953, three more were invited to join and one resigned, because he did not agree with our findings. We were all under oath of confidence then. Today, this project has included the US and two other military groups, but it is still classified, and understandably so. Let me begin. My collaborator, Dr. E, will assist me with the audiovisual aids. Lights, please. May I have the first slide? This is a photograph of the members in the original panel. They are all scientists. I believe you know all of them. The sixth one was the official liaison for the various observatories and meetings. Two have died; there are three of us fiom the original panel. Thank you, Dr. E. Lights, please? First of all, I have to give a very brief introduction about electromagnetic theory with respect to what we know today as the \"electromagnetic spectrum\". May I have the second slide, please? Here is the functional spectrum shown vertically as increasing fiequenciesg9. The area of our particular interest is not even shown in most spectra, because it is beyond even gamma rays. It is the region corresponding to cosmic rays, and high gamma's of about id2 Hz. So, we made our own spectrum starting with W (ultraviolet), then X-rays, Gamma and Cosmic rays. Bear this in mind. Also, according to present theory, all of this spectrum consists of quantum photons of electromagnetic energy. As to whether \"cosmic rays\" are photons, it is still not clear. In fact, we don't know what \"cosmic rays\" truly are. Suffice it to say they are Beta particles, Gamma rays, Protons, and God knows what! This is the realm of \"cosmic ray energy physics\". However, this is not to be codused with the New Age term of \"cosmic energy\" and other mumbo-jumbo terminology. Lights, please? In this group we need not go hrther than that. You all know physics. During the 1950's, two separate phenomena were studied in detail: the precession motion of the Earth that behaves as a gyroscope, and the mysterious \"cosmic rays\". Cosmic rays are the most mysterious particles in the Universe today! What is important is that all these particles, except Gamma's, are highly ionised and cause ionisation likewise, in our atmosphere due to their extreme energy. Cosmic rays can go through the Earth like a bullet through butter. Their energy is of the order of 10\" EV (electron-volts), the ideal dream of all particle physicists! When M3 1 Andromeda nebula and the M45 Pleaides cluster were first resolved, a very unusual phenomena was observed in the Pleaides cluster. I won't go into details, but a very unusual belt of radiation was theorised to exist around it. The observations and 99 It would probably help to have the charts in Matrix 111 or LE #77 open at this point. 648"},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO theoretical calculations indicated at this time an invisible radiation belt was of the order of high-energy Gamma rays. There was disagreement at the time, but when Einstein was cautiously approached to give his opinion, he not only agreed with our hypothesis, but he offered valuable suggestions for reinterpreting the data and reformulating new equations using relativistic corrections. By then we were absolutely positive of our findings, but then the implications were astounding. Professor XX decided to form a small panel, and invited Einstein as a consultant. He agreed, even though he realised we were going out on a limb proposing such an outlandish theory. But Einstein's was a truly great mind, and open to \"crazy\" ideas like his own in 1905. So he helped us. Unfortunately, a few months later he died, so we lost our great consultant. However, by 1960 satellites were launched, and infrared and ultraviolet astronomy would allow us to see what was up to then impossible. So, in 1961, our hypothesis was verified, and when the radiation belt was discovered via satellite instrumentation, we celebrated and got royally drunk! However, we sobered up quickly, because we now knew the implications of our theory and had confirmation of this radiation belt. I wish to digress here for a very important point. We had also approached the great Professor Fred Hoyle to consult about our findings. Not only did he stay up all night reading our confidential papers, but he agreed wholeheartedly with our findings and encouraged us greatly, even when we told him that our information fell on deaf ears in the astrophysical and astronomical community. Then he told us a secret. He had been aware of this very radiation belt, and had approached it fiom a different angle, but his intuition told him that his theory would be regarded as \"science fiction\" at best. Then, he got the flash of writing about his theory in science fiction story. In fact, the book was about to be released by then, 1957. As soon as it got published, we devoured the book. It was a superlative work describing our theory, but in a somehow anthromorphised manner. We highly recommend all of you to read Sir Fred Hoyle's \"fiction\" story. It is titled ''B Black Cloud\". It is the work of a genius, but with real facts behind the fiction. It is also the manifesto of a maverick in the astrophysics community that never accepted the \"Big Bang\" as such, but a steady state creation. His latest 1993 book on the origins of life is, in my opinion, destined to become a classic. Now, we take a leap in time, and go to the 1980's, where another scenario was brewing, namely the detection of an ominous radioactivity belt around the Earth's atmosphere. I need not tell you who put it there. We all know.'00 It was the atmospheric detonations and nuclear testing of our imbecile governments! Further studies by the Chilean and other observatories revealed though spectroscopic analyses the existence of a paseous awepate that had begun to c~?,stallise. -fonnina organometallic com~ounds that were mametic in nature. and also ~otentially flammable. almost IosiveZy so. Some of these orpanometallic com~ounds have similar composition to firlminatina com~ounds used in militarv ordinance explosives. To make matters worse. the mametic \"cloud\" was also attracting the radioactive belt closer to the Earth. We made precise calculations, and when we were absolutely certain, we approached the Naval Observatory of the ONR. A loo We are probably talking about Project Argus in the 19609s, where some military scientists had the brilliant idea of detonating hydrogen bombs in space around the Earth, and did so."},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"MATRIX 111 - VOLUME TWO high-ranking admiral told us, \"gentlemen, we know about it. I must urge you to remain silent, for the project is highly classified. Nevertheless, he invited us to join the project and introduced us to those working on the project already. To make a long story short, by now, 1985, they knew about our own project about the M45 Pleiades radiation belt, and he also urged us to \"classi@\" the project, even though no one in the scientific community paid an ounce of attention to \"such a ridiculous theory\". It was already forgotten by them. However, the military was extremely aware of it, because the USAF and Navy have perfbrmed extensive scientific studies on atmospheric physics and radio-astronomy, for obvious reasons related to \"tactical national security\" The politics and red tape were intolerable, and eventually I resigned, both from my academic post and my research contract with the Naval Observatory and ONR. Meanwhile, the danger hovering around Earth was getting closer and closer. Likewise, the solar system was slowly but surely approaching the Manasic ring in M45, and its precarious radiation belt. To make matters worse, the insane UFO community had gotten hold of the information about this belt in M45, and dubbed it \"the Photon Belt\". And, to add to the public confbsion, in the 1990's started the absolutely insane craze of the New Age community with their \"channelled ludicrous information about \"the belt\". We have, of course, read all the mumbo-jumbo being written on the subject, but nobody really knows the scientific truth behind it -- except for the military, and by now some government officials. I don't mean to demean or insult anyone, and, with due respect to Dr. E's New Age ex-wife and daughters, we have to categorically state that all their information is incorrect, pure dogma and empty illusions of \"being transformed into 'Galactic Beings' of 4th density\". If this occ~rs'~' according to our calculations, we will all glow in the dark if we get close to the radiation belt in M45 Pleiades. Unfortunately, we just don't know or understand the nature of this radiation belt, and if it is a form of radiation we know, or if it something totally new. For one thing, if there is a negative electromagnetic pulse, it will create havoc on all our electrical systems due to interference. If it creates a positive electromagnetic pulse of positrons, then, yes, all electricity will be neutralised on Earth. But, that includes human beings, because our brains and nervous systems operate on electricity. So do plants and animals. So, at this point, we really don't know what to expect, scientifically speaking, of course. The Order, on the other hand, knows what is coming. So, ladies and gentlemen, it is interesting to contrast what orthodox science knows, or does not know, with what our own Hermetic Gnosis informs us to expect. Just remember, though, that five world governments know about this forthcoming phenomenon, possibly, disaster. Let me now to what seems to be a most imminent and \"closer\" scenario that is driving the military \"mad, because they know the implications of this event, and they are doing desperate efforts to prevent it fiom happening. I will spare you all the intricate scientific details, but concentrate more on the practical aspects of what to expect. You will have noticed that in the past five years, the scientific literature is full of reports of unusual high Gamma rays from \"God knows where\". These are also classed as \"cosmic lo' The approach of the M45 radiation belt. 650"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO rays\". Simultaneously, but not reported in the journals, is the tremendous increase in radioactivity at the level of our own airplane routes worldwide. Now, this is due to the crystallised organometallic, magnetic explosive cloud in the high atmosphere - the latest reports locating it in the area of the high-level aurora region. between 500 to 650 Krn above sea level, just next to the ionosphere. Are you getting the picture of the project on \"aurora atmospheric research\" dubbed HAARP? The real reason behind the HAARP ~roiect is a desperate attem~t to disverse the hi& explosive and radioactive cloud ap~roachin~ the Earth and threatening the whole world now. I hope scientists are wrong in their predictions of disaster, but if the governments and military are desperately making attempts to stop this event, it must be close to the disaster scenario predicted by our colleagues in the 1980's. It is true that the H' poses &gers to ~lobal communication and ecoloa! but the other danper is of a areater magnitude, for it may incinerate the whole Earth's surface in a matter of +s. mmqvbe even hours. I would like to stop here, so we can contemplate this information and clear our minds of alarming thoughts. Thanks. Break Dr. M: Let me continue. While all of this is occumng above us in the heavens, the present status of Mother Earth is nothing less than alarming. I don't wish to be the \"harbinger of doom or bad news\", but the truth must be known now, before it is absolutely too late. Who knows, it may be too late now! As we all know here, we research scientists are usually ignored by the rest of the scientific community, the government, and the public in general. Only the military hears what we have to say, and they do that, anyway, to know what we are doing, in case they can \"use us for tactical or military purposes\". Oftentimes, scientists are \"seduced\" by the military and intelligence agencies, who are always the only ones always interested in our science and have unlimited fbndslo2for research. That happened to Delgado, the Montauk scientists, the Oppenheimers, the Tellers, and so on. Only the great Einstein and David Bohm were wise enough to say no! That is why they fired Prof Bohm fiom Princeton, and that was a blessing, for otherwise today we would not have the (concept of) the holographic implicate order in quantum mechanics. I was not so smart. I persisted until the pressure started to ruin my health, and I finally resigned before they \"retired me the way they do when they \"retire\" dissident or \"obsolete\" scientists that know too much.

Furthermore, unknown to most orthodox earth and physical scientists -- except the military, of course, the planetary earth grid is affected is adversely afXected by the removal of trees, because great trees are natural resonance cavities for the earth grid energy that emanates at cross points. Without those nodal points, we do not condense atmospheric Takyons for the synthesis of the Life Force.

Professor Philip Callahan, in his most unusual research, has discovered this fact, and has since dropped out of the orthodoxy. Now he is helping the Egyptian government to restore \"fertility\" in the formerly rich valleys in the lands of the Nile, today tenibly barren and infertile.

A colleague of mine theorises - and I hope he is wrong - that all the abuse we have inflicted on planet Earth has contributed to the erratic behavior and anomalies of the geomagnetic field, and that the e~atic wobble + Chandler nutations (in other words, the pole wanderings + oscillations) have tilted the Earth fiom its normal orbit by about 22\". If this continues, the Earth may undergo great oscillations that could send it into convulsions, or (cause it to move ) rapidly away fiom the Sun. If the former occurs, the Earth could literally explode \"like the planet Krypton\", or, if the latter occurs, in a matter of days the Earth could attain below fieezing temperatures, down to 120\" below zero! As with the crystallised organometallic cloud, created by man's chemical and radioactive pollution, this last scenario was also created by man's greed and stupidity. And, since \"science\" did nothing to prevent it, they dismissed it as \"science fiction\", and laughed about it. Well, soon we may not be laughing any more. We may be crying bitter tears! I wish to stop at this point, so we may engage in questions and answers on this scenario that is here and now and affects us all. So, let me open the podium for questions. (Dead silence and long pause) Yes, Dr. P? Dr.P: First, thank you for a superlative and very sobering presentation. Now, which of the two events is likely to occur sooner - the crystalline radioactive explosive cloud, or the M45 Pleiadian radiation belt? And, secondly, has the hypothesis of your colleague been discussed, confirmed or rebuked by other astrophysicists? Dr. M: I'll answer your last question first. The hypothesis has been discussed with others, but everyone in the orthodox community laughed about it. They though it sounded like level contribute to a detonation? Could this synchronistically be the same thing that happened on Mars? Will they ever find Elvis Presley? (Just kidding). Could MRX (see elsewhere in this issue) be an answer? As for the existence of a \"post apocolypticn society living in a poisonous atmosphere, future life progression studies by Dr. Chet Snow, and the OBE experiences of Robert Monroe, oddly enough, indicate parallel reality structures, 200 to 300 years ahead, that incorporate domed living structures. Remember: \"never clone alone in a dome homen, attributed to Dr. Wertha Fookowi, in the 2lst century novel \"Sleepless Agoinn."},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO \"Jor-El of Krypton\", the Superman science fiction story. However, Dr. YY and a young theoretician, Dr. WW, from the Naval Observatory (ONR) and myself feel the data and his calculations are sound. Three others have read the papers, and they also agree. It is very plausible. As for the time frame? As I said, about three years. However, and I will only make the statement once, the Nm and Air Force are aware of it. and have discussed this with an alien woup that can he@ stabilise the erratic pvroscovic behavior of the planet via their amazina technolom. Now, as for the M45 and atmospheric clouds, we are already under the influence of the Pleiadian Manasic belt, and the high Gamma's reported in 1993 and 1994 are undoubtedly from that. There have been major power failures already, not too well publicised, of course, but we have had mysterious black-outs, and also many high- reliability computer failures as well. The explosive cloud in the atmosphere is being bombarded with terawatts of power (HAARP) in an attempt to disperse it, or repel it. It has been slowly approaching the (surface of the) Earth for about 10 years, but attained a critical distance in 1993. It could accelerate and approach the Earth's ionosphere in about a year (1995), maybe less. It is not a textbook type of phenomenon, and nobody truly understands its inner structure, or dynamic mechanisms. So, that is an unstable situation. Ms Dr. U: What can we do ourselves to help the planet, to offset the destruction of trees, chemical pollution, and to help the Earth grid in our various countries, on a collective basis? Dr. M: Not very much, unfortunately. It is too late to plant trees, which nobody is really doing, except for logging companies that are merely \"mining the Earth\", planting only one kind of tree, to be cut again in 20 to 30 years. In this group of scientists, we could all join the efforts and research of Dr. Callahan, and construct \"artificial Earth grid resonators\", like the Hieronimus towers, Callahan towers or \"cosmic tubes\", if you pardon the expression, by using higher-order electromagnetics, like scalar and takyonic transducers, to create localised resonances at specific grid crosspoints. This will help the Earth at least at the local level. It will also minimise the danger of local seismic movements, or earthquakes, because it releases vortical flows of Earth grid energy, which is what causes the natural earthquakes. The ancient Chinese and Egyptians mastered this science and protected their temples this way by building specifically constructed towers, obelisks, and domes at precise grid crosspoints. Today, this can be done using simple technology. The key is the precise placement of these tubes and the Takyon converters. The Germans, the Chinese, the Israelis, the British and the Americans have such tubes amongst the unorthodox research community - the psychotronics and radionics community. Some use electrical batteries - others use \"fie energy\" devices. Primitive people use stones, and those, amazingly, do work well. Otherwise, just take care of yourself. Dr.Z: You forgot CCCP, Dr. M. We also do have kosmic tubes like that. Also, in Czechoslovakia. If all this can happen, then what is best way to protect ourselves and family? What is government doing here? In CCCP, doing nothing!"},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"MATRIX I11 - VOLUME TWO Dr.M: I say, I wish to defer that question to Dr. E. You want to answer that, Dr. E? Dr. E: Ok, I will. That is a hard one to answer. Let me just tell you what the government has been doing here. It is not (generally) known, but it is a fact that every major critical military installation in this country - West Point, Annapolis, the Air Force Academy, etc., has an exact replica of their facilities deep underground, in case of any emergency of any sort. Furthermore, in the past 10 years, the military has bought and stored entire warehouse of food to last them for about 20 years. They have their own water filtration plants in underground facilities, and as you know fiom our past meetings, not only does Mrs. Maurice Strong have the largest collection of seeds in the world stored away safely, but also the military has vast stores of wheat, grain and seeds. You think Russia got the grain before? Wrong. They got some, but the rest is stashed away by the government in case of any geological disasters, not war, just natural disasters. They know what is really going on, but, as Dr. M indicated, they publicly deny it, and the orthodox and academic scientists ridicule the possibilities of world geological and cosmic disasters as preposterous or science fiction! I think we would be wise to follow their example, but be very quiet and discreet about it. They certainly are! Mrs Dr. C: What about that rumoured phenomenon about the space-time continuum warp and time flow shift that was discussed with Herr Professor Dr. Albert Einstein and the cosmologist Dr. George Garnow in the 194OYs, and that was recently discussed by Dr. XX in Poland? Dr. M: (silence) Dr. A., would you like to answer that? Dr. A: Yes, indeed. Unfortunately, we are not at liberty to discuss that here. But, let me just say that one of our colleagues wrote a script for a movie that was made in New Zealand as science fiction. He and Drs. XX and XXX wanted to inform the world of the dangers that they were exposing the Earth to by playing with the Earth grid without sufficient understandig. It was submitted anonymously, as was \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", and the film is virtually unknown on the continent. It is called \"The Quiet Earth\". It is available in video in the USA. Most of it is true, except the romance, and , most importantly, the key to survival. Such a space-time shift is hinted at in the movie. That is all I can say about it. You ail know the technique. Thank you. That is all. Dr. M: I think this is also the last question. More discussions can be held tonight in the workshops. Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your undivided attention.

The usually neglected interaction between the electric dipole of the water molecule and the quantized electromagnetic radiation can be treated in the context of a recent quantum field theory formulation of collective dynamics. The result is that coherent interactions between electric dipoles and the radiation field can generate ordered structure in microscopic domains of the order of 100 microns in size. These domains are the basis of the memory properties of water, in that water \"remembers\" and retains frequencies to which it is exposed. This also explains why homeopathy works, spreading frequency changes throughout the water in the body. Magnetic fields which are able to influence these microscopic domains in water are biological stressors. <--- WHY HOMEOPATHY WORKS"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"MATRIX III - VOLUME 2 RESEARCH ON EMR EFFECTS ON BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS and BIOELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH RESULT A feature essential for a liquid is that length will not define a resonant frequency, only the precision with which frequency can be specified. Dilution and succession will therefore only increase the precision of the frequency determined by coherence and hopping rate. Thus, there should be a limiting frequency resolution of the order of tens of milli-hertz; resonant frequency of aboyt 6lrHz in highly potentised preparations and 30kI-b in lower potencies. Water has a helical structure which permits magnetic field interaction. The bond angles of the water molecule lead naturally to a basic pentagonal structure which forms naturally into a dodecahedron (12-sided near spherical cavity) at the interface of collapsing bubbles formed by the succession of homeopathic potency. Only those dilution ratios which correspond to the planes of symmetry of a dodecahedron produced effects in Benvenist's experiments. A pearl-chain of dodecahedrons would also provide a helical structure, and this would make the hndamental 'bit' for information storage. The fundamental action of homeopathic potency on a living organism is essentially the 'seeding' of the frequencies of specific resonant modes in the multi-mode, multi-frequency dielectric resonator which is constituted by the organisms morphology. Any block of dielectric always has at least one propagating EM mode, and without any need for 'metal walls of a cavity resonator'. This accounts for the observed properties of metabolically pumped coherent oscillations in living systems. REFERENCE Del Giudice, Preparata and Vitiello (1988) Dr. Wolfgang Ludwig, .

The study was one of the first to suggest that the importance of the magnetic fields lies also in extremely low power alternating fields with frequencies which resonate with, and reinforce, biological wave- lengths. Magnetic field bioeffects depend not only on the strength of the field but also the frequency of the alternating field. Depressive illness and suicide were found to be statistically increased just as much among patients living near underground HV lines. The DNA helix was found to resonate with microwaves.

In 1979, private and public concern prompted an investigation by Congress in 1979. The Congressional report showed that rather than inform the embassy employees, the US Government chose to remain silent and allow the employees to hnction as guinea pigs. In 1976, the US finally decided to install protective screens. Originally, the signal detected was thought to be too weak to hnction in terms of eavesdropping. In the 1960's, equipment was devised to measure the radiation being beamed at the embassy. In 1963, continuous recording of data began. According to the 1979 Congressional report, between August 1963 to May 1975 the frequency of the signal ranged from 2.56 to 4.1 Ghz and the intensity remained about 5pW/cm2 at the strongest point of the beam. In January and August of 1973, two additional beams were detected. This continued daily, and boosted the intensity of the signals at times to 18~wlcm~. When protective screening was installed in February 1976, the intensity dropped to QI 2pW/cm2, at which it remained until bombardment ceased in January 1979. It reappeared briefly in 1983. In March 1988, the a F irradiation began again, this time primarily in the 9-1 1Ghz range, producing power levels of 0. 1pw/cm2 outside the building and 0.0lp~/cm2. (Microwave News, Mar/Apr 1988). Around 1965, growing concern by a number of scientists prompted the State Department to carry out the first of a number of studies involving embassy personnel. A project was started by the George Washington University School of Medicine, headed by Dr. Cecil Jacobson (Cytogenic Evaluaiion of Mutagenic Exposure), which took blood samples fiom 71 embassy employees before, during and after exposure. Employees studied had a higher-than-average lymphocyte count. Both Moscow ambassadors assigned to the embassy during the period died from cancer and leukemia. The final and most extensive epidemiological study was initiated in June 1976 by Johns Hopkins University. Analysis of medical records of some 3,100 embassy employees and 2,336 dependents (1,468 children) yielded interesting results. Females showed a higher-than- average death rate fiom malignant neoplasms. Males showed a significantly raised rate of protozoal intestinal diseases, benign neoplasms, diseases of the nerves and peripheral ganglia. Females also had a significantly higher rate of protozoal intestinal diseases as well as complications of pregnancy and childbirth. The children had significantly higher rates of mumps, anemic blood diseases, heart disease and respiratory infections. For the U.S. Government to admit that the weak Moscow signal caused health effects would also result in the admission that the 10m~lcm~ U.S. \"standard\" was inadequate, unleashing potential claims and litigation nationwide. Four ex-employees of the embassy sued the U.S. Government and received out-of-court settlements.

It produces individualism that is immediately expressed as republican nationalism, dedicated to ending all hereditary control and dictatorship over the lives of people. The Rennaissance Period becomes de-structured again by the old families in Europe. England eventually becomes the source of the movement to destroy nationalism (initially through conquest and establishment of the British Empire) and individualism, expressed in the Communist movement. Eventually, two world wars would be planned to restore rule by the oligarchy. 1400 European power centers coalesce into two camps: the Ghibellines, who supported the Emporors Hohenstaufen family, and the Guelphs, from Welt the German prince who competed with Frederick for control of the Holy Roman Empire. The Pope allied himself with the Guelphs. All modem history stems directly from the struggle between these two powers. The Guelphs are also called the Neri, Black Guelphs, or Black Nobility, and supported William of Orange in his seizure of the throne of England, which eventually resulted in the formation of the Bank of England and the East India Company, which would rule the world from the 17th century. All coup d'etats, revolutions and wars in the 19th and 20th centuries are centered in the battle of the Guelphs to hold and enhance their power, which is now the New World Order. The power of the Guelphs would extend through the Italian financial centers to the north of France in Lombardy (all Italian bankers were referred to as \"Lombards\". Lombard in German means \"deposit bank\", and the Lombards were bankers to the entire Medieval world. They would later transfer operations north to Hamburg, then to Amsterdam and finally to London.

First, it made each individual primarily a federal citizen of the municipal corporation of the District of Columbia. Secondly, it combined the Senate and the House in terms of function, so they are now operating for the benefit of private commercial law. Until the 14th Amendment, the House functioned for private commercial benefit and the Senate functioned for non-commercial public municipal law benefit- for the benefit of the individual under Republican law. In addition, the 14th made each person responsible for the public debt by making them beneficiaries of the \"public trust\" the 14th Amendment established. The 14th Amendment was in fact instrumental in shifting citizenship of each American from being primarily a state citizen, to being a citizen of the private corporation of government. One thing to remember is that the 14th can only exercise jurisdiction over those who chose voluntarily to participate. One day before the 14th Amendment was passed, Congress passed 15 Statute at Large, which provided for a person to remove him or herself from the jurisdiction of the 14th Amendment Public Trust if they so desire. All of this set the stage for private law to be used outside the constraints of the Constitution to financially enslave the population and destroy the Union of the Republic.

Pavlov wins the Nobel Prize for his discovery of a process of organism conditioning through external stimuli in a precisely controlled external environment. Western and European science focus on the conditioning stimuli. Soviet scientists focus on the aspect of external environment. Both aspects would later blend in an overall mind control paradigm in the latter 20th century. Heavy research would be conducted in Germany, which later contributed to development of a mind control infrastructure in the U.S. based on a mechanistically-based synthetic enviroment tied to body consciousness, temporal structure, drugs and electronics. Soviet contributions would add to the molding of the underlying psychological sub-structure. China would also adopt the paradigm as a basis for control of their vast population of 1 billion. John Watson has achieved an experimental basis for the behaviorist school of psychology with his experiments in \"molding the infant mind\".

As the process of water Juoridation continued, the cancer death rate of the fluoridated cities began to far exceed the rate of the unfluoridated cities. 1952 San Francisco begins to fluoridate its public water supplies. 1952 Congressional representative from Nebraska, Dr. A.L.Miller, who was also the Chairman of the Special Committee on Chemicals and Foods, comments on the fact that within 3 months the USPHS, who did not endorse fluoridation of public water supplies, suddenly reversed course and promoted it very heavily. Dr. Miller said he could not find any public evidence that the AMA, the ADA and other health agencies had done any work at all on researching the safety, but were in fact just endorsing each other's opinions in support of' the program. Miller noted that all scientific experts in biochemistry had advised the \"go-slow\" sign relative to fluoridation of public water. Dr. Miller expressed the fact that he wondered whether of not ALCOA and its subsidiary companies might not have a deep interest in getting rid of waste products fiom the making of aluminum.

The report continues in discussion of several possible mechanisms which allow these effects. A companion paper, \"A Direct Mechanism for the Direct Influence ofMicrowave Radiation on Neuroelec~ic Function\", is also produced by R. J. MacGregor for the RAND Corporation. In the report, he notes that power densities of close to 100,000 mwlcm2 can produce auditory halluncinations in a field that would be averaged as low intensity and non-thermal. According to MacGregors model, this would produce a depolarization of brain tissue of 2.0-3.0 mv, where he concludes that neuroelectric effects should exhibit a maximum effect in the microwave range.

It was discovered that enkephelins operated within the nerve tracks that signal chronic pain to the brain, and that some enkepheli receptors were found positioned to direct nerve impulse traffic from one nerve to the next, along primary paths of perception, emotion and pain. Later in 1976, in Britains National Institute for Medical Research, the peptide beta-endorphin was isolated fiom the pituitary of a monkey. It had an analgesic potency 100 times that of morphine and 40 times greater than enkephelins. Beta endorphins were split into Alpha and Gamma, the difference being only one amino acid. While Gamma produced a sensitivity to pain, Alpha produced analgesia. It was then postulated that Beta endorphins could act like a switch to balance reaction to pain. Lower blood sugar regulates certain neuro- transmitters and controls certain hormones, all leading to certain behavioral effects fiom speed-learning to flight-or-fight and pain suppression.

The original findings of Dr. Andrija Puharich about Soviet transmitters and brain entrainment are confirmed by the U.S. (according to Dr. Puharich at the Sixth Ozone World Congress). The U.S. Government goes even further in their research and discovers an ELF frequency that causes cancer. The ELF frequency modifies the function of the RNA transferases so that amino acid sequences are scrambled and unnatural proteins are produced. The ELF exerts its effect through nuclear magnetic resonance which changes the spin-coupling constants within chemical chains, especially those with couping constants around 8 Hz. A powefil carcinogen, ethylene dioxide, has coupling constants around 3-5 Hz. Formaldehyde has a coupling constant around 41 Hz. Parrish et al have found that the spin-spin coupling constants for water in malignant brain tumors range fiom 4.8 to 13.4 Hz. Coupling constants in normal gray matter range between 8.6 Hz and 1 1.3 Hz. Thus, malignancy shows a spread of frequencies from low to high ELF with respect to normal brain EEG, and carcinogens have a wide spread from about 3 Hz to about 41 Hz. A single ELF frequency can produce cancer. Dr-Arthur Guy conducts a 2-year study at the University of Washington entitled \"EfSects of Long-term Low-Level RFEiposure on Rats\".

In an appearance before Congress, he said that China \"now has more than 10 million disabled persons who could have been prevented through better controls.\" Pregnant women diagnosed as carrying infectious diseases or abnormal fetuses would be \"advised\" to terminate the pregnancy. China's one-child per family population policy has been criticized for its use of coerced abortions to terminate second or third pregnancies. Five years ago, authorities in northwestern Gansu Province passed regional legislation prohibiting the mentally retarded fiom having chuldren. Any mentally retarded woman found to be pregnant was subject to mandatory abortion. The provincial authorities were said to be seeking to sterilize as many as 260,000 women. The United States, in contrast, has in the past pennitted eugenics laws. In the early 20th century, as many as 16 states authorized the sterilization of the mentally retarded, epileptics and those judged to be insane. Some laws included confirmed criminals, alcoholics, syphilitics, moral degenerates and prostitutes. Richard Moms, a sociologist who wrote \"Evolution and Nature\", points out that in 1958, sterilizations had been ordered for more than 60,000 Americans who fell in various categories.

EXHIBIT 54 12-16-93 Evidence of HIV Immunity Holds Promise of Vaccine (USA TODAY) Discussions about AIDS and the immune system are underway at the Institute of Medicine in Washington, D.C. Scientists agree that the evidence for natural immunity is intriguing but still largely anecdotal. Scientists are examining several known types of immune system responses to HIV. Some people infected with HIV for 10 years or more show few signs of immune system damage. Some people that have been infected for a long time have some immune impairment, but have stablized without developing AIDS. Some people who have probably been exposed to the virus have not become infected at all. Some high risk people who test negative on the standard HIV antibody test show no other sign of exposure. Some people who have apparent exposure have no antibodies in their blood, but only in the urine. According to Mario Clerici of the National Cancer Institute, all of this suggests that it's not always true that you get sick and die when exposed to the virus. Records show that some prostitutes in Kenya who regularly have sex with infected men remain disease free. EXHIBIT 55 12- 12-93 Officials Lift Ban on Unboiled Water in D.C.

The CIA and the State Department collaborated with a secret Honduran military unit known as Battalion 316 in the 1980's that was involved in kidnapping, torturing and executing its own people, the Baltimore Sun reported after a 14 month investigation. U.S. officials during the Reagan administration deliberately misled Congress and the public about Honduran military abuses. The CIA was instrumental in developing, training and equipping Battalion 3 16, members of whom were flown to a secret location in the United States for training in surveillance and interrogation. And, beginning in 1981, the U.S. secretly provided hnds for Argentine counterinsurgency experts to train forces in Honduras. 5/27/95 \"Army starts treating veteran's wife for symptoms linked to gulf war\" Gannett News: Kimberly Martin, 26, describes her skull as \"caving in\". She has a breast disease that typically is hereditary - defjmg her family history. Because of cysts on her ovaries and fdopian tubes, \"everything is inflamed and irritable.\" Martin, the spouse of a Persian Gulf War veteran, finally is getting medical care under an order fiom Secretary of Army Togo West. Military officials deny that Martin's case is precedent-setting. Her husband, no longer in the Army, is 32 years old and suffers numerous problems - heart, chronic fatigue, memory loss, chronic gastritis and colonitis - that he suspects were caused by exposure to mustard gas during the 1991 war. That exposure was sexually transmitted to Kimberly, the Martin's believe. More than 50,000 veterans have told the VA they fear they are sick. Another 20,000 are on a Pentagon registry. According to Kimberly Martin, \"One great concern is my skull. There are four different areas that are deteriorating and caving in like an over-ripe melon, which causes me great pain and discomfort. I went to see a-neurologist, and he couldn't explain why this is happening. I now have fibrocystic breast disease, but that is supposedly only a hereditary disease. Neither side of my family has ever had a breast disease. My abdomen is so bloated at times I look pregnant. I receive - - extreme headaches every day, and rashes, which include little white bumps that appear on my hands, behind my ears, on my arms, and on my chest. My skin sheds between my fingers all the time. My eyes are photosensitive. My husband was a paratrooper and in great shape. I knew I was healthy and in great shape, because 1 was & aerobic-instmctor at Fort Bragg, North Carolina before he went to the Gulf.

A federal judge in San Francisco rebuffed the Clinton Administration's attempt to let the government prosecute drug defendents while separately seizing their property. The ruling bars what has become almost standard practice in the 'war against drugs': prosecuting drug defendants in criminal court while at the same time using civil procedures to seize their property. This practice violates the constitutional ban on double jeopardy, which says that people cannot be punished twice for the same crime, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said last September. On May 30th a majority of the 24- judge circuit rehsed to hear the Clinton administration's plea to have a larger panel reconsider. The panel invited the government to pursue the same seizures in criminal court, where prosecutors must prove \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" the property was used to commit the crime or bought with the proceeds. (This puts a halt to money-making schemes by local law enforcement departments nationwide, who arrest people and profit from sales of their property) EXHIBIT 13 1 6/2/95 (Under Briefs, California) Seattle-Post Intelligencer.
